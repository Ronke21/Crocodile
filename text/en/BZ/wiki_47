<doc id="739076" wikidata="Q16835712" url="?curid=739076" title="Duchy of Estonia (1561–1721)">
<text>The Duchy of Estonia (; ; ), also known as Swedish Estonia (), was a dominion of the Swedish Empire from 1561 until 1721 during the time that most or all of Estonia was under Swedish rule. The territory was eventually ceded to Russia in the Treaty of Nystad, following its capitulation during a plague outbreak in the Great Northern War.

The dominion arose during the Livonian War, when the northern parts of present-day Estonia — Reval (Tallinn) and the counties of , , and — submitted to the Swedish king in 1561, and in 1581. It is also colloquially known as the &quot;good old Swedish times&quot; () by Estonians, but this expression was not used before the following Russian rule, in the beginning of which the situation of Estonian peasantry declined rapidly; to gain the support of the German Baltic nobility, Russia gave them more power over the peasantry.

<text>San Rafael del Norte is a municipality and a town in the Jinotega department.

The town is located north of Managua, the capital of Nicaragua. Elevated at over 3,000 feet, it is the highest town in Nicaragua, which attracts tourists from many countries for hiking, swimming and vacations.

==Description==
San Rafael del Norte lies to the North of Jinotega, about a forty-minute bus ride along a road that is paved. The Catholic Church in town is home to several murals illustrating the usual tenets of the Catholic faith. One, in particular is noteworthy. The mural showing the Temptation of Jesus in the desert has achieved a local notoriety because many observers have noted that the face of the devil strongly resembles that of current Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega. As the mural was painted in the 1960s, this similarity is either prescient or coincidental.
The murals were painted by a Swiss Artist, who was invited by Brother Odorico D&#x27;Andrea, an Italian priest who came to San Rafael del Norte in 1953. He was responsible for building health centers, bridges, as well as projects which provided drinking water and electrification. After his death in 1990, his body was found to be corrupt, which is usually considered one of the signs of sainthood. His stone casket lies in Templo Tepayec, a monument at the end of the main street through town, with a very visible set of steps leading up to it.
The small town of San Rafael del Norte is famous for being the birthplace of Blanca Aráuz, Augusto C. Sandino&#x27;s wife. This national hero, who fought against the American intervention on Nicaragua, fell in love with her in 1927 while she was a telegrapher in town. Blanca&#x27;s family house is currently a museum with historical objects, such as newspaper articles, Sandino&#x27;s letters and American weapons. This museum recently closed because the roof of the house caved in.
Another famous inhabitant of this town has Odorico D&#x27;Andrea. This Italian priest got here in 1954 and played an important role in the development of San Rafael del Norte. He help organizing health centers, providing clear water and electricity to people, among other things. D&#x27; Andrea, who died in 1990, was buried at the Virgen del Tepeyac church, which also offers nice views of the city.
This priest also gave an important impulse to the renovation of San Rafael del Norte&#x27;s church, located in the center of the town. The building is notorious for its colorful stained glass and impressive size, which contrasts with the size of the town itself.
Furthermore, there is a private natural reserve in this municipality: El Jaguar, commonly known and visited for its many trails, which are suitable for birdwatching tours. It also has lodging options for tourists and a biological station for students and biologists. Another interesting site if the coffee farm called Kilimanjaro, where visitors learn about the coffee production, arrange a horseback ride, among other activities. It is possible to stay overnight at this farm.

<doc id="739081" wikidata="Q158325" url="?curid=739081" title="Lathyrus latifolius">
<text>Lathyrus latifolius, the perennial peavine, perennial pea, broad-leaved everlasting-pea, or just everlasting pea, is a robust, sprawling herbaceous perennial flowering plant in the pea family Fabaceae. It is native to Europe but is present on other continents, such as North America and Australia, where it is most often seen along roadsides.
== Morphology ==
&quot;Lathyrus latifolius&quot; has winged hairless stems, and alternating blue green compound leaves consisting of a single pair of leaflets and a winged petiole about long. The leaflets are narrowly ovate or oblong-ovate, smooth along the margins, hairless and up to long and across. There is a branched tendril between the leaflets.

=== Racemes ===
Short racemes of 4–11 flowers are produced from the axils of the leaves. The flowers, which are unscented, are about across with a typical structure for &quot;Faboideae&quot;, with an upper standard and lower keel, enclosed by lateral petals. There are 5 petals, which are purplish pink, fading with age. There is a green calyx with 5 teeth, often unequal. The blooming period lasts about 2 months during the summer and early autumn.

=== Seeds ===
The flowers are followed by hairless flattened seedpods, about long and wide, with several seeds inside. The seedpod, which is initially green, gradually turns brown, splitting open into curled segments, flinging out the seeds. The seeds are dark and oblong to reniform in shape.

== Reproduction ==
&quot;Lathyrus latifolius&quot; can reproduce vegetatively from its taproot and rhizomes, or by reseeding.

== Cultivation and habits ==
&quot;Lathyrus latifolius&quot; is a perennial herbaceous vine (climber), which can reach 6 feet or more by means of twining tendrils, but in open areas sprawls. It is frost-hardy, long-lived, and slowly spreading. The foliage becomes rather ragged and yellowish by the end of summer.

It requires partial to full sun, and loam or clay-loam soil that is moist, mesic, or slightly dry. Unlike the related annual sweet pea, &quot;Lathyrus odoratus&quot;, with which it may be confused, it has no scent. While grown as a garden plant it may be pervasive and difficult to remove. Because of this, this species is often considered to be a weed despite its attractive appearance.

Numerous cultivars have been selected as garden subjects, of which the following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:
== Relations to insect life ==
Bumblebees pollinate the flowers. Butterflies visit the flowers for their nectar, but do not pollinate. &quot;Epicauta fabricii&quot; (Fabricius blister beetle), the caterpillars of &quot;Apantesis phyllira&quot; (Oithona tiger moth) and some herbivores feed on the leaves. However, the seeds are poisonous.

<text>Dungeon Keeper 2 is a strategy game developed by Bullfrog Productions and published by Electronic Arts in 1999 for Microsoft Windows. In the sequel to &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;, the player takes the role of a &#x27;dungeon keeper&#x27;, building and defending an underground dungeon from the would-be heroes that would invade it, as well as from other keepers. In the campaign mode, the player is charged with recovering the portal gems from each area in order to open a portal to the surface. The player can also construct a dungeon without strict objectives, and multiplayer is supported over a network.

The game carries over many ideas from the original and adds new elements including units, rooms, and objectives. Development was carried out by a team of around fifty people, who focused on the graphics on multiplayer. A PlayStation version, and a sequel, &quot;Dungeon Keeper 3&quot;, were in development but cancelled. &quot;Dungeon Keeper 2&quot; received positive reviews: reviewers lauded the graphics and artificial intelligence, although some reviewers criticized its similarity to the original. The game was later released on GOG.com, Origin, and Steam.

The kingdom of Harmonia, ruled by King Reginald, has been under siege from dungeon keepers for a while, and his wizards have devised a device known as a Portal Gem to confine evil creatures to the underworld, while still allowing good forces access. Reginald has twenty Portal Gems, each assigned to a realm and safeguarded by its guardian. These devices have forced even serious dungeon keepers into retreat. An evil warrior known as the Horned Reaper (or &quot;Horny&quot;) believes he has the ability to remove Portal Gems from Harmonia, and has enlisted the player&#x27;s assistance in conquering its realms so he can claim the Portal Gems.

== Gameplay ==
The sequel to &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;, &quot;Dungeon Keeper 2&quot; carries over many gameplay aspects, and adds new ones. Like the original, &quot;Dungeon Keeper 2&quot; places the player in the role of a malignant overlord bent on world domination. The player controls the world with a hand, performing actions such as moving creatures around the map, casting spells, and interacting with specific items. All the underground lands in the kingdom must be conquered to recover the portal gems. The kingdom itself takes the form of a large table containing a 3D map where the player selects where to attack from the highlighted regions. There are twenty main levels in the campaign. Some levels have multiple versions with differing methods of attack, allowing the player to choose the method and sub-region.

Generally, the player starts out with a Dungeon Heart and some Imps. The Dungeon Heart has the same purpose as the original game: it serves as the dungeon&#x27;s life force. If destroyed, the player loses. In &quot;Dungeon Keeper 2&quot;, the heart has additional functions: regenerating mana (used to cast spells), doubling as a gold-storage area, producing Imps, and sending certain creatures to investigate threats it detects. Gold is the currency used to construct rooms, traps, and doors, and pay minions. Gold is obtained primarily by digging gold and gem seams, the latter providing an unlimited supply. This is performed by the Imps, the main workforce of the dungeon, who dig and claim tiles for the player to control. Another main task Imps perform is the fortification of walls adjacent to tiles owned by the player, although this no longer makes them impenetrable to enemies, but merely makes digging take longer.

The primary rooms include the Lair, Hatchery, Training Room, Library, and the Treasury. These have the same purpose as the first game: they function as a resting place, feeding place, training area, research area, and gold storage area respectively. The only major difference is that the Training Room can only train creatures up to experience level four. Further experience can only be gained through real combat, such as fighting in the new Combat Pit, where creatures fight against one another. The higher a creature&#x27;s experience level, the stronger and more powerful they become. The highest experience level is level ten, and creatures cannot achieve levels nine or ten via the Training Room or Combat Pit.

Other rooms include the casino, where creatures gamble for either pleasure or to be exploited for gold. The Workshop, where traps and doors are produced, and the torture chamber, where creatures are tortured, can convert enemy units into friendly units. Traps include the Sentry trap, which shoots nearby enemy creatures, the Fear trap, which scares enemies away, and the Alarm trap, which alerts its owner if it detects enemy creatures nearby. Doors block enemies while still allowing its owner&#x27;s creatures to have a passage. They come in various forms, such as Wooden, Braced, Secret, and Magic. Secret doors imitate walls, and Magic doors defend themselves by shooting enemy creatures. Bridges connect areas and facilitate transport over water and lava tiles. Lava harms most creatures and burns Wooden Bridges, but Stone Bridges are immune to it.

Creatures are attracted via Portals. Which ones come depend on the dungeon&#x27;s composition. Each has its own abilities (such as spells they can cast), expertise, and job preferences. Creatures include Bile Demons, Warlocks, and Salamanders. Like the first game, creatures can be slapped with the hand to make them work harder, at the cost of their health. Certain creatures, such as Skeletons and Vampires cannot be attracted via Portals. They are obtained by their corpse decomposing in a Graveyard, and dying in captivity respectively. Certain sacrifices in the Temple, a room where creatures pray, also yield the acquisition of certain creatures. Creatures frequently enter combat (each follow one of four combat strategies) against creatures belonging to enemy keepers, or heroic forces defending the realm. Heroes enter the level via Hero Gates. The heroic forces are composed of different units of keepers: heroes include Wizards, Giants, and Guards. Most creatures have a heroic counterpart: for example, the Wizard is the counterpart of the Warlock. Heroes and rival keepers&#x27; creatures can be converted to the player&#x27;s cause in the torture chamber after being captured and imprisoned. Creatures dislike their heroic counterparts, and their company may make them angry, which can lead to rebellions. Rebelling creatures either leave the dungeon, or defect to another keeper or the heroes, and may take other creatures too. Other things that can annoy creatures and cause rebellions include lack of food, not getting paid (creatures require payment on a regular basis), and being slapped.

Spells are cast using mana, not gold as in the first game. Spells include healing creatures, creating Imps, and summoning all creatures to a particular location. There are two grades of each spell, upgraded in the Library, the higher grade version being more powerful. For example, an upgraded Create Imp spell summons a level four Imp, whereas the normal version summons a level one Imp. As with the first game, the player can possess a creature and interact with the world from its perspective of using its abilities. A special spell is the ability to summon Horny to assist the player for a short period. In the Campaign mode, it requires the assembling of the talisman, pieces of which are obtained through the discovery of bonus levels. Mana vaults may be scattered across certain levels; these may be claimed to increase mana generation. Other magical items are special items that provide a specific benefit to the player. These include healing all creatures, revealing the map, and locating a hidden level. There are five hidden levels based on mini games such as golf, bowling, and duck shooting.

In the campaign mode, the objective of each level is the acquisition of the Portal Gem, usually in the possession of the heroic guardian of the realm, although it is sometimes in the possession of a rival keeper. Whoever has the Portal Gem must be defeated, so Horny can enter and claim it. The final level involves defeating King Reginald, overlord of the entire realm of Harmonia. Some levels have more specific conditions relating to this goal: for example, there is one level in which the player races against the clock to obtain the Portal Gem in the possession of a rival keeper before the heroes invade and try to do the same. If the heroes recover the Portal Gem, the player loses. Other game modes include My Pet Dungeon and Skirmish. In My Pet Dungeon, the player constructs a dungeon without campaign-style objectives, and can control if, when, and how heroes invade. Instead, there are criteria based on the dungeon composition and related activities, and there is no requirement to proceed to the next level on completion. Skirmish involves competing against computer-controlled rival keepers, and the player can customize conditions such as which rooms and spells are available. Multiplayer is supported over IPX and TCP/IP and is otherwise similar to Skirmish. A patch added elite creatures (stronger than their normal counterparts) to the latter three modes. Elite creatures are attracted by constructing rooms with very specific tile arrangements.

== Development ==
Bullfrog Productions developed &quot;Dungeon Keeper 2&quot; with a team of around fifty people. The team included people involved in the original &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;, including Richard Ridings and programmer Alex Peters. Electronic Arts wanted to capitalize on the original game&#x27;s success. Producer Nick Goldsworthy believed the key to success was carrying over aspects of the original game and adding new things. A project manager from Mitsubishi assisted the team in management of attaining milestones, and according to Goldsworthy, this taught the team a lot about the practices employed by major companies regarding game development.

It was known the game needed to use 3D graphics with hardware acceleration to keep up with trends. The goal was to have a 3D renderer good enough for deathmatch. The team was also aiming to have a software renderer for lower-end computers. The team used Direct X to improve the lighting effects.

The audio was implemented by five team members. The music was composed by Mark Knight, and Nick Laviers was head of audio. The methods used was similar to those used by the BBC for their radio effects.

David Armor and Shintaro Kanaoya headed the level design, working with the flow of the tweaked user interface created to reduce ambiguity when looking after the dungeon. In fact, the interface was redesigned more than ten times due to feedback from various groups because the team wanted the public to understand it. Testers played levels without any invading forces, which led to the development of My Pet Dungeon. An important feature to improve was the multiplayer, and great deal of effort was put into it.

&quot;Dungeon Keeper 2&quot; was released for Microsoft Windows by Electronic Arts in 1999 on 25 June in the United Kingdom, 28 June in North America, and 8 July in Australia. Goldsworthy believed Peter Molyneux, producer of the original game, would be pleased with the sequel. Indeed, Molyneux stated that he &quot;liked what they did with it&quot;, but also said that it was not precisely what he would have done and that his focus would have been &quot;expanding that sense of creating the greatest dungeon&quot;. A PlayStation version was in development, but cancelled. The first patch, which added levels, fixed bugs, and tweaked gameplay, was released in August.

&quot;Dungeon Keeper 2&quot; is available on GOG.com and Origin.

== Reception ==
&quot;Dungeon Keeper 2&quot; received favourable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. The improved graphics in particular were noted. Trent C. Ward of &quot;IGN&quot; complimented the &quot;amazing&quot; graphics and commented that it looks better than the first game, but criticized the lack of major changes. Greg Kasavin of &quot;GameSpot&quot; too praised the graphical improvements over the original, and also highly commended the sound, but criticized the lack of gameplay changes compared to the first game. The gameplay was praised as &quot;outstanding&quot; by William Harms of the American &quot;PC Gamer&quot; magazine, but he also commented that multiplayer has glitches and oversights such as not being able to get back to the main menu after a game. Jason Cross of &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; commended the gameplay and echoed others&#x27; views on the graphical improvements, but criticized the high system requirements. A reviewer from &quot;GameRevolution&quot; liked the graphics, scenarios, and humor. Another reviewer who liked the graphics was Chad Foster of &quot;Gamezilla&quot;, who also commended the &quot;incredible&quot; detail, and the &quot;realistic&quot; sounds. Robert Coffey of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; praised the dark humour, but criticized the short campaign. Blake Fischer of &quot;NextGen&quot; said, &quot;Although still fun, &quot;Dungeon Keeper 2&quot; is nowhere near as inspired as its predecessor.&quot;

A reviewer from British magazine &quot;Edge&quot; praised the artificial intelligence, describing it as &quot;extremely impressive&quot;. It and the graphics were again praised by &quot;PC Zone&quot;″s Charlie Brooker, who was also among the reviewers to criticize the game&#x27;s similarity to the original. Nevertheless, &quot;Dungeon Keeper 2&quot; was named as a PC Zone classic. A reviewer from &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; was also among those who eulogized the graphics, and he did likewise with the replay value, and the multiplayer, describing it as &quot;one of the best ever on PC&quot;. Another reviewer who complimented the improved artificial intelligence was John Houlihan of &quot;GameSpot UK&quot;, who described the game as a &quot;more than worthy sequel&quot;. &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot;″s reviewer also lauded the graphics and gameplay, but considered the scenarios repetitive. The British &quot;PC Gamer&quot;″s reviewer said the game was what &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; &quot;should have been in the first place&quot;, and cited the entertainment, innovation, and addictiveness as why the game is &quot;pure Bullfrog&quot;, but criticized the combat because he believed it was a case of putting all creatures in and hoping to win.

The game sold 70,685 copies in the U.S. by April 2000.

The staff of &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; nominated the game for their 1999 &quot;Best Real-Time Strategy Game&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings&quot;. They wrote that the game &quot;may have walked away with the crown&quot; on a less competitive year. The game was awarded the Editor&#x27;s Choice award from &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, and, in 2000, a Best Voice Acting award. It was also nominated for the &quot;Strategy Game of the Year&quot; award, which went to &quot;Homeworld&quot;.

== Cancelled sequel and spiritual successor ==
In the Extras menu, players can see a teaser trailer for &quot;Dungeon Keeper 3.&quot; Ideas such as the merging of the underworld and overworld were planned for the sequel, but Electronic Arts began focusing on other franchises such as &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. In August 2000, Bullfrog announced that the development of &quot;Dungeon Keeper 3&quot; had been cancelled.

In 2015, a spiritual successor called &quot;War for the Overworld&quot; was released and developed by Brightrock Games.

<doc id="739090" wikidata="Q7534489" url="?curid=739090" title="Skelmanthorpe">
<text>Skelmanthorpe, known locally as Shat, is a village in the Denby Dale civil parish, in the metropolitan borough of Kirklees, in West Yorkshire, England. It is south-east of Huddersfield. According to the 2011 census, the village had a population of 4,549.

The village sits on the south (right) bank of the first river-like flow, from three small headwaters (uniting in the northwest corner of the parish), of the Dearne.

==Name==

The village was recorded as &quot;Scelmertorp&quot; in the Domesday Book in the year 1086 AD. The name derives from the Norse personal name &quot;Skjaldmarr&quot; and &quot;thorp&quot;; thus having the meaning of an &quot;outlying farmstead of a man called Skjaldmarr&quot;.

Locals know it as &quot;Shat&quot;, which appears to be an abbreviation of &quot;Shatterers&quot;, the name by which the locals are known. Local labour was taken on during construction of the railway to break or &#x27;shatter&#x27; rocks as well as work on the excavations. These unskilled labourers were referred to as Shatterers. The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actress Jodie Whittaker has explained the origins of the term and referred to herself as a &quot;Shat lass&quot;.

==History==
The village was probably founded during the Viking invasion in the 9th century, as they moved inland from the North Sea. There is no record of the village in the earlier Roman times.

The entry for Skelmanthorpe in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 states:

&quot;Manors &amp; Berewick. In Turulsetone and Berceworde and Scelmertorp, Alric and Aldene had nine carcucates of land to be taxed, and there may be five ploughs there. Ilbert now has it, and it is waste. Value in King Edwards time 4 pounds. Wood pasture one mile long and as much broad.&quot;

The comment &quot;and it is waste.&quot; is the result of the Harrying of the North of 1069. William the Conqueror had difficulties subduing his northern subjects, leading to the order to &quot;spare neither man nor beast, but to kill, burn and destroy&quot; being issued. This left Skelmanthorpe and much of Yorkshire a wasteland for about nine years.

The first recorded owners of the village were Alric and Aldena in the 11th century, mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. Following the Norman invasion of England in 1066 the village was given to Ilbert de Laci by the new king. The de Laci family owned the village for the next 300 years, until through the marriage of Alice de Laci in the 14th century, the village came into the possession of Thomas, Earl of Lancaster. The village remained in this family and after the marriage of Blanche of Lancaster to John of Gaunt, the village became the property of their son Henry (King of England).

During the 1770s, Skelmanthorpe Feast was a riotous affair with bull and bear-baiting and organised dog fights on the village green. A quote from John Taylor, who compiled a biography of Skelmanthorpe-born preacher Isaac Marsden (1807–1882), records that &quot;Public houses were crowded with drunken revellers, who caroused all day and made night hideous with quarrels and disturbances ... Among these scenes of revelry were mountebanks, showmen, fortune telling Gypsies, vagabonds and thieves from every quarter.&quot;
Skelmanthorpe Feast now happens every year on the field next to The Chartist and across the road from what was the Three Horse Shoes public house and is now shops.

In November 1874 a number of skirmishes were fought between the native villagers and Irish navvies. The navvies had been brought in to construct the railway, and fighting broke out between them and the locals on a number of occasions and locals being refused work on the line. A small group of locals threw stones at the navvies, who responded with mattock shafts and spades. The fighting lasted for most of the day eventually ending in the afternoon. Police were called in from Huddersfield but arrived after the disturbances had finished.

In 1934 a cinema was built, it was the sole use of the building for almost 30 years. In 1961 wrestling was introduced to increase revenue. A reduction in audiences in 1968 resulted in the cinema closing and the building became a bingo hall until 1970 when the building closed. After five years it reopened as the Savoy Squash Club. In June 2010, part of the club was redeveloped as a Youth and Community Centre with a car park, outdoor 5-a-side court, sports hall with a stage, meeting room and cafe.

===Industry===
Similar to many village in the area, agriculture was the primary industry of Skelmanthorpe until the 19th century when weaving took over as the dominant occupation. Many of the older buildings in the village show signs of having been used as weavers cottages in the past. As late as 1890, there were 200 hand looms in cottages in Skelmanthorpe.

Number 6, Queen Street was preserved by Leslie Robinson a local historian as the Skelmanthorpe Textile Heritage Centre, complete with hand loom and all the associated equipment. Leslie became frail and in 2011, Richard Brooke, Tony Weatherby and David Collins created the Friends of Skelmanthorpe Textile Heritage Centre to assist with the running of the centre. Following Robinson&#x27;s death in 2015 The Friends applied to the Heritage Lottery Fund to purchase the centre from his estate. The centre is now owned by a charitable trust. It opens on the second Sunday of the months between March and December to give free guided tours and loom demonstrations. It also opens for four days in September during the English Heritage Open Days.

=== Survey of English Dialects ===
Skelmanthorpe was a site in the Survey of English Dialects. The recording taken was notable both because of the rich form of dialect used and because it discussed a local sighting of a ghost. This stood out in the survey, in which most recordings were of villagers discussing local industries.

=== Governance ===
Skelmanthorpe became a civil parish in 1876, on 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished and merged into Denby Dale. In 1951 the parish had a population of 3425.

==Buildings and services==

===Schools===
Two schools are in Skelmanthorpe:
* St Aidan&#x27;s Church of England Academy
* Skelmanthorpe Academy 

Both of these are First schools, serving children up to Year 5 (rather than Year 6 like most primary schools).

After the first school, children move on to Middle School (usually Scissett Middle School) for 3 years before moving on to Shelley College.

===Churches===
Skelmanthorpe has five churches:
*Church of St Aidan – (Church of England – Anglican)
*Skelmanthorpe Methodist Church
*Trinity Evangelical Church
*Skelmanthorpe Wesleyan Reform Church (now closed and demolished)
*Saville Road Hall (Christian – non-denominational)

===Fire station===
The fire station was constructed in 1956. It currently houses one pump and one area support unit along with 21 personnel and is designated as a retained fire station.

==Sports teams and facilities==
The village has had its own cricket team since around 1876; the current cricket pitch dates from 1900.

The village also has its own junior and senior football teams that play in the Huddersfield leagues respectively.

There are two crown green bowls clubs within the village. One club is based at the Windmill Pub on the outskirts of the village and the other club based in the centre of the village. Each club have their own bowling green.

Following a petition from local young people fundraising allowed the construction of a small skatepark which opened early 2006. Residents from the area complained about the noise and the skatepark has since been moved. It is now at the bottom of the football field.

Parkgate Sports and Community Trust have won the right for a new sports complex to be built at Parkgate.

== Transport ==

===Railway===

For more than 100 years (from 1879 until 1986), Skelmanthorpe had a railway station on the Clayton West branch line that ran along the northern edge of the village. The line was closed to passengers in 1983 and the track was removed in 1986.

The disused trackbed of the former branch line was later used for the Kirklees Light Railway, a minimum-gauge railway designed as a tourist attraction, which opened as far as Skelmanthorpe in 1992.

The nearest railway stations now are Denby Dale (2.2 miles) and Shepley (3.1 miles); both stations are on the Penistone Line with trains in both directions to Huddersfield, Barnsley and Sheffield

===Buses===
Skelmanthorpe is served by bus services to Holmfirth and Wakefield on the X1 service and Huddersfield and Denby Dale on the D1 Denby Darts service. Team Pennine is the bus company that runs these services through the village.

===Roads===
The main road through the village is the B6116, Which connects to the A629 and A636.

==Notable groups and residents==

<text>KSTW (channel 11), branded Seattle 11, is an independent television station licensed to Tacoma, Washington, United States, serving the Seattle area. Owned by the CBS News and Stations group, the station maintains studios on East Madison Street in Seattle&#x27;s Cherry Hill neighborhood, and its transmitter is located on Capitol Hill east of downtown.

As the first station to sign on in Tacoma (and second in the Seattle metropolitan area overall), KSTW initially signed on in March 1953 as KTNT-TV, the area&#x27;s CBS affiliate under the ownership of the &quot;Tacoma News Tribune&quot;. The station lost the affiliation when Seattle-licensed KIRO-TV signed on in 1958; both stations shared the affiliation for two years after their owners agreed to settle an antitrust lawsuit over the switch. The station became KSTW in 1974 when it was acquired by a forerunner of Gaylord Broadcasting; it subsequently became one of the strongest independent stations in the country over two decades, reaching regional superstation status with widespread carriage on cable television systems in Washington and neighboring states/provinces. KSTW rejoined CBS in 1995 during a nationwide affiliation shuffle; two years later, the station became a UPN affiliate via a three-way deal involving it and KIRO-TV, which led it to join The CW when UPN shut down in 2006, carrying the network&#x27;s programming until 2023, when CBS withdrew its eight affiliates from the network after selling its ownership stake to Nexstar Media Group.

KSTW is available on cable television to Canadian customers in southwestern British Columbia on numerous cable providers such as Shaw Cable and TELUS Optik TV in Vancouver, Victoria, Nanaimo, Kamloops, Penticton and Kelowna.

==History==

===Early history===
The construction permit for the station was issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on December 10, 1952. Chief Engineer Max Bice immediately ordered equipment through General Electric, and the equipment was delivered within 45 days. The antenna was in Milan, Italy and it was shipped by rail car to Tacoma. The transmitter arrived in Tacoma from Syracuse, New York, on February 9, 1953. It was installed on the next day, and work progressed rapidly. The original studios and transmitter house were located at South 11th Street and South Grant Avenue. The station tested with a 30,000-watt signal and received reports of reception from up to away.

The station began broadcasting March 1, 1953, in Tacoma as KTNT-TV, named after its founder, the &quot;Tacoma News Tribune&quot;. At the time, it was a primary CBS affiliate and sister station to KTNT radio (AM 1400, now KITZ, and FM 97.3, now KIRO-FM). During the late 1950s, the station was briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network. On February 21, 1954, KTNT received permission from the FCC to increase the transmitter&#x27;s power to 316,000 watts, and to move the transmitter to a new tower near View Park, Washington just south of Harper on the Fragaria Access Road. Parts of the old transmitting equipment were loaned to Portland, Oregon&#x27;s KGW-TV, due to the damage from the Columbus Day Storm of 1962.

In February 1958, KIRO-TV (channel 7) took to the air as the Seattle–Tacoma market&#x27;s exclusive CBS affiliate. After being informed by CBS that its affiliation would be discontinued, KTNT-TV filed an antitrust lawsuit against CBS and KIRO-TV, on claims the network had a pre-existing agreement to affiliate with KIRO-TV when and if it ever went on the air. CBS agreed to settle the suit in 1960 by taking on both KIRO-TV and KTNT-TV as primary affiliates. This arrangement lasted until September 1962, when channel 7 became the sole CBS station for western Washington. Channel 11 was left to once again become an independent station, the second in the market after KTVW (channel 13, now KCPQ).

During the late 1960s, the station also occasionally carried NBC prime time programs preempted by Seattle SuperSonics games on KING-TV (channel 5). For one month, in May 1967, the station was also an affiliate of the United Network (also known as the Overmyer Network), a short-lived attempt to create a fourth commercial television network nationally. During the decade, KTNT also presented horror movies under the &quot;Nightmare!&quot; banner in the early 1960s on Saturday nights, airing around 10:30 p.m. before sign-off.

===New ownership===
Due to new newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership restrictions enacted by the FCC in the early 1970s, the &quot;Tacoma News Tribune&quot;″s ownership of the KTNT stations were under threat of potential FCC divestiture. As a result, KTNT-TV was sold to the WKY Television System, forerunner of Gaylord Broadcasting (now Ryman Hospitality Properties), in 1974; the new ownership changed the station&#x27;s call letters to KSTW (standing for Seattle–Tacoma, Washington) on March 1. With the new ownership and call letters came a new slogan, &quot;Good Lookin&#x27; 11&quot;, as well as a new logo—a stylized &quot;circle 11&quot; with the circle modified to accommodate the &quot;11&quot;. Later in the decade, KSTW became a regional superstation. At its height, it was available on nearly every cable system in Washington, as well as parts of Oregon, northern Idaho, and much of British Columbia. The station also carried many daytime CBS programs preempted by KIRO-TV (including game shows such as &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; and &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;) during the 1970s. From 1976 to 1979, John Lippman worked at KSTW, building a news department.

During the late 1980s, KSTW branded on-air as &quot;KSTWashington&quot; and, as it did in the 1960s and 1970s, ran the traditional fare of cartoons, off-network sitcoms, westerns, old movies, and a local 10 p.m. newscast. It was also the over-the-air home of the Seattle Mariners and SuperSonics. Although it was one of the strongest independent stations in the country, it passed on the Fox affiliation when that network launched in 1986; that affiliation was picked up by KCPQ. This was mainly because most of the smaller markets in KSTW&#x27;s cable footprint had enough stations to provide a local Fox affiliate, making the prospect of KSTW as a multi-market Fox affiliate unattractive to Gaylord.

In 1993, Gaylord agreed to affiliate KSTW, and its sister stations KTVT in Fort Worth, WVTV in Milwaukee and KHTV in Houston, with the new WB Television Network, at that time projected to launch late in the summer of 1994. However, delays in the network&#x27;s launch led to Gaylord suing to void the affiliation agreements in July 1994, which was followed a month later by a breach of contract countersuit by The WB. In the meantime, CBS found itself without an affiliate in Dallas–Fort Worth when its longtime affiliate there, KDFW, switched to Fox (it was later purchased outright by that network). CBS approached Gaylord for an affiliation with KTVT. Gaylord agreed, on condition that KSTW be included as part of the deal. CBS agreed, partly because at the time, KSTW was the only non-Big Three station in Seattle with a fully functioning news department.

As a result, CBS returned to channel 11 on March 13, 1995, in what was to have been a ten-year affiliation agreement. (Some CBS shows that were preempted by KIRO, such as &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, had already been shown on KSTW starting in the fall of 1994, which was already occurring with KTVT.) The WB ultimately signed with KTZZ-TV (channel 22, now KZJO) weeks before its eventual January 1995 launch. With the CBS affiliation, KSTW was dropped from cable systems in areas of Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho, due to the presence of Spokane&#x27;s KREM-TV. Even as a CBS affiliate, KSTW still ran a number of off-network sitcoms, and initially only programmed two half-hour newscasts, at 6 and 11 p.m. Although it carried an 11 p.m. newscast throughout its run with the network, daytime newscasts aired in various timeslots during KSTW&#x27;s third tenure with CBS, eventually settling at 6 a.m., 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. KSTW used the same vertically parallelogrammed &quot;11&quot; logo and on-air branding as its Dallas sister station KTVT during this time.

The station was put up for sale in October 1996, with Gaylord stating in its earnings report that &quot;its financial results have not met expectations.&quot; On January 20, 1997, Gaylord announced that KSTW would be purchased by Cox Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, for $160 million. The deal was finalized on May 30, 1997 (Gaylord held on to KTVT until 1999, when it was sold to CBS outright). Cox had plans to expand the news department at KSTW and make it more competitive with the other stations in the market. However, rival KIRO-TV had been put up for sale just weeks before KSTW, as the Belo Corporation&#x27;s merger with the Providence Journal Company gave it ownership of KING-TV (Belo could not hold on to both KING-TV and KIRO per FCC ownership rules at the time).

Paramount Stations Group, meanwhile, was in the process of selling off the non-UPN stations it had inherited from Viacom, including KMOV in St. Louis—Paramount and Chris-Craft Industries launched UPN in January 1995, the same month The WB went on the air. As a result, on February 20, 1997, a three-way station trade was arranged, in which Paramount/Viacom would swap KMOV to Belo for KIRO-TV, which would then be dealt to Cox in exchange for KSTW and $70 million—a deal that came as a shock to KSTW employees. The two Seattle stations retained their respective syndicated programming, but exchanged network affiliations once again, with KSTW becoming a UPN affiliate, and KIRO returning to CBS. The deal was finalized on June 2, 1997.

KSTW began to air UPN programming on June 30, 1997, along with sitcoms, movies, cartoons, a few first-run syndicated shows, and the return of the 10 p.m. newscast it had prior to the CBS switch. The station canceled the 10 p.m. newscast in December 1998. Viacom acquired CBS (its former parent) in 2000, bringing CBS and KSTW under common ownership, and making KSTW and the aforementioned KTVT sister stations once again. The cartoons on KSTW had disappeared (as a result of UPN ending the &quot;Disney&#x27;s One Too&quot; block in August 2003), and more first-run syndicated talk and reality shows moved to KSTW. In July 2001, KSTW moved their studios from Tacoma to Renton; despite the move, KSTW remains licensed to Tacoma to this day.

===CW affiliation===
On January 24, 2006, Time Warner and KSTW parent CBS Corporation (which split from Viacom the previous month; the two would remerge in December 2019) announced they would shut down The WB and UPN, and launch The CW Television Network, which would largely feature programming from both networks; KSTW was announced as the Seattle station for the new network; the station rebranded as &quot;CW 11&quot; on August 11, ahead of the network&#x27;s launch on September 18, 2006. Tribune Company-owned WB station KTWB-TV (later KMYQ, now KZJO) became an affiliate of MyNetworkTV.

In November 2006, after cost-cutting measures were put in place by CBS, it was announced that KSTW would become a &quot;hosting station&quot;, with master control located at the facilities of the company&#x27;s San Francisco duopoly of KPIX and KBCW.

===Return to independence===
On October 3, 2022, Nexstar Media Group acquired majority ownership of The CW. Under the agreement, CBS was given the right to pull its affiliations from KSTW and its seven other CW stations. On May 5, 2023, CBS announced that it would exercise that right and KSTW would cease airing The CW&#x27;s programming at the end of August and become an independent station. The CW affiliation in Seattle went first to the 4.2 subchannel of KOMO-TV, then to KUNS-TV on January 1, 2024.

==Programming==
===Sports===
The station was the on-air home for the NBA&#x27;s Seattle SuperSonics in the early 1970s, and again from the early 1990s until 1999. It also aired Seattle Mariners games for most of the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. The station also carried TVS&#x27; World Football League telecasts in 1974. The station also carried the NASL Seattle Sounders from 1974 to 1981 and the MISL Tacoma Stars from 1984 to 1986.

===Children&#x27;s programming===
From 1954 to 1974, KTNT&#x27;s local children&#x27;s programs featured a personable host named &quot;Brakeman Bill&quot; McLain. From 1988 to 1994, the station carried &quot;Ranger Charlie&#x27;s Kids Club&quot;, the last children&#x27;s show in the region to be filmed before a live audience. The show featured a forest ranger accompanied by a puppet raccoon named Rosco; the show won an Emmy Award. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; cartoons were incorporated into the show.

===Newscasts===
KTNT/KSTW has offered local newscasts throughout most of its history. Its news department began when the station signed on in 1953 as a CBS affiliate. In 1976, KSTW moved its 11 p.m. newscast to a prime time slot at 10 p.m. In May 1990, the station debuted an 11:30 a.m. newscast, which was ended on July 23, 1991, due to low ratings. After KSTW rejoined CBS in March 1995, the station made extensive changes to its news schedule: the 10 p.m. newscast moved back to 11 p.m., and newscasts were added in various other timeslots: besides the 11 p.m. news, it initially only ran one other half-hour newscast, at 6 p.m. On July 31, 1995, the station debuted an hour-long 6 a.m. newscast; in early August, the 6 p.m. newscast was dropped due to low ratings in favor of an hour-long 5 p.m. newscast (the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, which originally aired at 5:30, then moved to the 6 p.m. timeslot Seattle stations have traditionally scheduled the network newscasts).

Both newscasts were removed on March 11, 1996, in favor of newscasts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. emphasizing health and consumer features. During this time, KSTW was among the first stations to use the &quot;11 at 11&quot; branding on its 11 p.m. newscast (as did Gaylord&#x27;s station in Dallas–Fort Worth, KTVT, using a modified &quot;11 on 11&quot; branding on its 10 p.m. newscast); this format included the top stories and a weather forecast in an 11-minute first segment, with the next segment serving as an in-depth &quot;Northwest News Extra&quot; report. After being sold to Paramount Stations Group, the station&#x27;s 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. newscasts were immediately cut. Initial plans for June 9, 1997, included expanding the 11 p.m. newscast (the only newscast to have remained largely unchanged from March 1995) to an hour (pushing the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; to midnight) in preparation for its return to the 10 p.m. timeslot, but those plans were retracted and the 11 p.m. newscast remained unchanged with no change to the &quot;Late Show&quot; start time. The late evening newscast reverted to the 10 p.m. timeslot after the switch to UPN on June 30.

KSTW&#x27;s news department was shut down on December 4, 1998, as a result of cost-cutting measures mandated by then-parent company Viacom; the move came after the company canceled newscasts on its UPN stations in Tampa–St. Petersburg and Boston. News returned to the station in March 2003, as it began to carry a 10 p.m. newscast produced by KIRO-TV under a news share agreement. The newscast was dropped on December 19, 2003, but returned on June 28, 2004, before being canceled again, this time permanently, in June 2005; from then on until July 2022, the time slot was filled with syndicated programming.

After dropping traditional newscasts, KSTW aired two specially focused news programs on Sunday mornings: the business-focused program, &quot;South Sound Business Report&quot; (produced by Business Examiner and also broadcast by Tacoma PBS member station KBTC-TV), as well as &quot;Northwest Indian News&quot; (produced by local cable channel KANU TV-99), which focuses on the Native Americans in the Northwest. In 2013, KSTW debuted a public affairs program on Sunday mornings called &quot;The Impact&quot;, produced by Washington state&#x27;s public affairs channel TVW. All of these programs have since gone off the air.

Local newscasts returned to KSTW after 17 years on July 18, 2022, with the debut of &quot;Seattle Now News at 10:00 on CW 11&quot;. The newscast was produced through CBS News and Stations, and ended on August 31, 2023.

==In popular culture==
The callsign and channel number for KSTW were co-opted by The CW to create a fictional representation of the station with a news department for the Seattle-set &quot;iZombie&quot; (which aired from 2015 to 2019), though not with &quot;CW 11&quot; branding, but retaining the station&#x27;s callsign font, and a completely different image from that of the real KSTW.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KSTW shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 36 to VHF channel 11.

===Former translators===
KSTW no longer has any over-the-air translators. KSTW&#x27;s last remaining translator, analog translator K62FS (channel 62) in Port Townsend, was permanently shut down on December 29, 2011. The FCC required that all television transmitters occupying channels 52 to 69 to vacate those channels by December 31, 2011. KSTW had already applied to change the broadcast channel and to broadcast in digital so as to use channel 51; however, on August 21, 2011, the FCC issued a freeze on processing applications to use channel 51; that channel would eventually be removed for TV use as part of the spectrum incentive auction. According to an online posting by KSTW, there are no other channels on which this translator can broadcast in digital, resulting in the permanent shutdown of the transmitter. KSTW also had low-power translators serving certain areas of Seattle, all of which have been shut down.

<text>In Greek mythology, Endymion (; , &quot;gen&quot;.: Ἐνδυμίωνος) was variously a handsome Aeolian shepherd, hunter, or king who was said to rule and live at Olympia in Elis. He was also venerated and said to reside on Mount Latmus in Caria, on the west coast of Asia Minor.

There is confusion over Endymion&#x27;s identity, as some sources suppose that he was, or was related to, the prince of Elis, and others suggest he was a shepherd from Caria. There is also a later suggestion that he was an astronomer: Pliny the Elder mentions Endymion as the first human to observe the movements of the moon, which (according to Pliny) accounts for Endymion&#x27;s infatuation with its tutelary goddess. Consequently, Endymion&#x27;s tomb has been attributed to two different sites. The people of Heracleia claimed that he was laid to rest on Mount Latmus, while the Eleans declared that it was at Olympia.
However, the role of lover of Selene, the Moon, is attributed primarily to the Endymion who was either a shepherd or an astronomer, as either profession provides justification for the time he spent gazing at the Moon.

== Mythology ==

Apollonius of Rhodes (3rd century BC) is one of the many poets who tell how Selene, the Titan goddess of the Moon, loved the mortal Endymion. She found Endymion so beautiful that she asked his cousin, Zeus, to grant him eternal youth so that he would never leave her. Alternatively, Selene so loved how Endymion looked when he was asleep in the cave on Mount Latmus, near Miletus in Caria, that she entreated Zeus that he might remain that way. In some versions, Zeus wanted to punish Endymion for daring to show romantic interest in Hera (much like Ixion). Whatever the case, Zeus granted Selene&#x27;s wish and put Endymion into an eternal sleep. Every night, Selene visited him where he slept, and by him had fifty daughters who are equated by some scholars (such as James George Frazer or H. J. Rose) with the fifty months of the Olympiad..

According to a passage in the &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot;, the sophist and dithyrambic poet Licymnius of Chios (probably 4th century BCE) told a different tale, in which Hypnos, the god of sleep, loves Endymion and does not close the eyes of his beloved even while he is asleep, but lulls him to rest with eyes wide open so that he may without interruption enjoy the pleasure of gazing at them.

The &quot;Bibliotheke&quot; claims that:

Calyce and Aethlius had a son Endymion who led Aeolians from Thessaly and founded Elis. But some say that he was a son of Zeus. As he was of unsurpassed beauty, the Moon fell in love with him, and Zeus allowed him to choose what he would, and he chose to sleep for ever, remaining deathless and ageless. Endymion had by a Naiad nymph or, as some say, by Iphianassa, a son Aetolus, who slew Apis, son of Phoroneus, and fled to the Curetian country. There he killed his hosts, Dorus and Laodocus and Polypoetes, the sons of Phthia and Apollo, and called the country Aetolia after himself.&quot;

In a similar vein, a scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius wrote that, according to Hesiod, Zeus allowed Endymion to be the keeper of his own death and to decide on his own when he would die.

According to Pausanias, Endymion deposed Clymenus, son of Cardys, at Olympia. Describing the &quot;early history&quot; of the Eleans, Pausanias reports that:

: The first to rule in this land, they say, was Aethlius, who was the son of Zeus and of Protogeneia, the daughter of Deucalion, and the father of Endymion. The Moon, they say, fell in love with this Endymion and bore him fifty daughters. Others with greater probability say that Endymion took a wife Asterodia—others say she was Chromia, the daughter of Itonus, the son of Amphictyon; others again, Hyperippe, the daughter of Arcas—but all agree that Endymion begat Paeon, Epeius, Aetolus, and also a daughter Eurycyda. Endymion set his sons to run a race at Olympia for the throne; Epeius won, and obtained the kingdom, and his subjects were then named Epeans for the first time. Of his brothers they say that Aetolus remained at home, while Paeon, vexed at his defeat, went into the farthest exile possible, and that the region beyond the river Axius was named after him Paeonia. As to the death of Endymion, the people of Heracleia near Miletus do not agree with the Eleans for while the Eleans show a tomb of Endymion, the folk of Heracleia say that he retired to Mount Latmus and give him honor, there being a shrine of Endymion on Latmus.

Pausanias also reports seeing a statue of Endymion in the treasury of Metapontines at Olympia.

Propertius (Book 2, el. 15), Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Tusculanae Quaestiones&quot; (Book 1), and Theocritus discuss the Endymion myth at some length, but reiterate the above to varying degrees. The myth surrounding Endymion has been expanded and reworked during the modern period by figures like Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and John Keats (in his 1818 narrative poem &quot;Endymion&quot;).

The satirical author Lucian of Samosata records an otherwise unattested myth where a fair nymph named Myia becomes Selene&#x27;s rival for Endymion&#x27;s affections; the chatty nymph would endlessly talk to him when he slept, waking him up. This annoyed Endymion, and enraged Selene, who transformed the girl into a fly. In memory of Endymion, the fly still grudges all sleepers their rest.

==Background==

No explicit narrative has survived. In the &quot;Argonautica&quot; (iv.57ff) the &quot;daughter of Titan,&quot; the Moon, was witness to Medea&#x27;s fearful night-time flight to Jason, and &quot;rejoiced with malicious pleasure as she reflected to herself: &#x27;I&#x27;m not the only one then to skulk off to the Latmian cave, nor is it only I that burn with desire for fair Endymion she muses. &quot;But now you yourself it would seem, are a victim of a madness like mine.&quot; Lemprière&#x27;s &quot;Classical Dictionary&quot; reinforces Pliny&#x27;s account of Endymion&#x27;s attachment to astronomy and cites it as the source of why Endymion was said to have a relationship with the moon as she passed by.
The mytheme of Endymion being not dead but endlessly asleep, which was proverbial (the proverb—&quot;Endymionis somnum dormire&quot;, &quot;to sleep the sleep of Endymion&quot;) ensured that scenes of Endymion and Selene were popular subjects for sculpted sarcophagi in Late Antiquity, when after-death existence began to be a heightened concern. The Louvre example, discovered at Saint-Médard-d&#x27;Eyrans, France (&quot;illustration above&quot;), is one of this class.

Some believe that he was the personification of sleep, or the sunset (most likely the last one as his name, if it were Greek rather than Carian can be construed from &quot;to dive in&quot; [Greek en () in, and duein () dive], which would imply a representation of that sort. Latin writers explained the name from &quot;somnum ei inductum&quot;, the &quot;sleep put upon him&quot;.)

The myth of Endymion was never easily transferred to ever-chaste Artemis, the Olympian associated with the Moon. In the Renaissance, the revived moon goddess Diana had the Endymion myth attached to her.

<text>Microsoft Flight Simulator 98, abbreviated commonly as FS98, is a flight simulator video game. It was released in September 1997 for Microsoft Windows.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Flight Simulator 98&quot; (version 6.1) is generally regarded as a &quot;service release&quot;, offering minor improvements, with a few notable exceptions: The simulator now also featured a helicopter (the Bell 206B III JetRanger), as well as a generally improved interface for adding additional aircraft, sceneries, and sounds.

Other new &quot;out of the box&quot; aircraft included a revised Cessna 182 with a photorealistic instrument panel and updated flight model. The primary rationale for updating the 182 was Cessna&#x27;s return to manufacturing that model in the late 1990s. The Learjet Model 45 business jet was also included, replacing the aging Learjet 35 from earlier versions. The Dynamic Scenery models were also vastly improved. One of the most noticeable improvements in this version was the ability to have independent panels and sounds for every aircraft.

A major expansion of the in-box scenery was also included in this release, including approximately 45 detailed cities (many located outside the United States, some of which had been included in separate scenery enhancement packs), as well as an increase in the modeled airports to over 3000 worldwide, compared with the approximately 300 in earlier versions. This major increase in scenery production was attributable partially to inclusion of the content from previous standalone scenery packs, as well as new contributions by MicroScene, a company in San Ramon, California who had developed several scenery expansions released by Microsoft. The scenery files for &quot;FS95&quot; are forwards compatible with &quot;FS98&quot;.

This release also included support for the Microsoft Sidewinder Pro Force Feedback joystick, which allowed the player to receive some sensory input from simulated trim forces on the aircraft controls.

This was the first version to take advantage of 3D-graphic cards, through Microsoft&#x27;s DirectX technology. With such combination of hardware and software, FS98 not only achieved better performance, but also implemented better haze/visibility effects, &quot;virtual cockpit&quot; views, texture filtering, and sunrise/sunset effects.

==Reception==

By November 1997, &quot;Flight Simulator 98&quot; had shipped one million units, following its September launch. It received a &quot;Gold&quot; award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) in August 1998, for sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The VUD raised it to &quot;Platinum&quot; status, indicating 200,000 sales, by November.

Pete Deemer for GameSpot said &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 is an impressive feat. With a few exceptions, gone are the glaring flaws of the previous version; coupled with its technological innovations, the sum of the parts is a unique flight experience of unprecedented realism.&quot;.

Denny Atkin for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; summarized: &quot;Overall, though, this is a worthwhile update for FLIGHT SIMULATOR fans who have fast 3D cards.&quot;

Dave Mathieson for &quot;PC Zone&quot; summarized: &quot;[...] Flight Sim 98 is the most realistic sim around of any type, and the sheer size of this version, combined with lovely graphics, make it a bit of a must for anyone even remotely interested in flying planes.&quot;

During the AIAS&#x27; inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator 98&quot; won &quot;PC Simulation Game of the Year&quot;, along with nominations for &quot;Computer Entertainment Title of the Year&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Software Engineering&quot;.

<text>Managua () is a department in Nicaragua. It covers an area of 3,465 km2 and has a population of 1,559,774 (2021 estimate), making it the country&#x27;s most populated department. The capital is the city of Managua, which is also the capital of Nicaragua. The department has two coastlines, on the Pacific Ocean and on Lake Managua, but does not border Lake Nicaragua. The Nahua chiefdom of Tekwantepek was located in the Managua department. According to Spanish conquistador and historian Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, Tekwantepek was one of the last chiefdoms in present-day Nicaragua to fall to the conquistadors and their central-Mexican allies. The chiefdom&#x27;s name is a combination of the Nawat words &quot;tēkwani&quot; (jaguar), and &quot;tepek&quot; (hill), therefore the translation of Tekwantepek is &quot;hill of jaguars&quot; or &quot;jaguar hill&quot;. The municipality of Ticuantepe located in the department is likely named after this chiefdom. The Indigenous inhabitants of Managua are the Chorotegas and Nahuas.

<doc id="739105" wikidata="Q329017" url="?curid=739105" title="Richard Roberts (engineer)">
<text>Richard Roberts (22 April 1789 – 11 March 1864) was a Welsh patternmaker and engineer whose development of high-precision machine tools contributed to the birth of production engineering and mass production.

==Early life==
Roberts was born at Llanymynech, Powys, on the border between England and Wales. He was the son of William Roberts, a shoemaker who also kept the New Bridge tollgate. Roberts was educated by the parish priest and early found employment with a boatman on the Ellesmere Canal and later at the local limestone quarries. He received some instruction in drawing from Robert Bough, a road surveyor, who was working under Thomas Telford.

Roberts then found employment as a patternmaker at Bradley Iron works, Staffordshire and, probably in 1813, moved to a supervisory position in the pattern shop of the Horsely Iron works, Tipton. He had gained skills in turning, wheel-wrighting and the repair of millwork. He was drawn for the militia and to avoid this made for Liverpool, but finding no work there he shifted to Manchester, where he found work as a turner for a cabinet-maker. He then moved to Salford working at lathe- and tool-making. 

Because the militia was still seeking him, he walked to London where he found employment with Henry Maudslay as a fitter and turner. At Maudslay&#x27;s he absorbed his master&#x27;s philosophy of &quot;the importance of accurate machine tools where hand-work was replaced by mechanisms&quot;. 

By 1816, when defeat of Napoleon had removed the threat of the militia, it was safe for him to return north, he had set up at Manchester as a &quot;turner of plain and eccentric work at No 15 Deans Gate&quot;. The lathe was upstairs in a bedroom, driven by a big wheel in the basement turned by his wife. Roberts soon moved into New Market Buildings at Pool Fold, and was described as a &quot;Lathe and Tool Maker&quot;.

== Machine tools ==
Roberts built a range of machine tools, some to his own design, the first being a gear-cutting machine. For checking the dimensions of the gears he adapted the sector, which he developed for sale to other engineers. Roberts adopted rotary cutters, which he had seen used at Maudslays. This is one of the earliest records of a milling cutter used in engineering. In 1816 he made the first reliable wet gas meter. In 1817 he made a lathe able to turn work . This had a back gear to give an increased range of speeds and a sliding saddle to move the tool along the work. The saddle was driven by a screw through gearing which could be disengaged when the end of the cut was reached. Also in 1817 he built a planing machine to allow the machining of flat surfaces. Previous to this flat surfaces were laboriously made by hand with the fitter using hammers and chisels, files and scrapers to get a true surface.


Following the success of his power loom, in 1825 he invented a slotting machine to cut keyways in gears and pulleys to fasten them to their shafts. Previously this was done by hand chipping and filing. The tool was reciprocated vertically, and by adopting Maudslay&#x27;s slide rest principle, he made the work table with a universal movement, both straight line and rotary so that the sides of complex pieces could be machined. Later he developed the shaping machine, where the cutting tool was reciprocated horizontally over the work, which could be moved in all directions by means of screw-driven slides. Examples of his machine tools, including the oldest existing metal planer, are in the collections of the National Museum of Science and Industry, London.
Roberts also manufactured and sold sets of stocks and dies to his range of pitches, so other engineers could cut threads on nuts and bolts and other machine parts. Roberts&#x27; inventions had a seminal influence on other machine-tool engineers, including Joseph Whitworth, when he came to Manchester, a decade later. His efforts have been largely overlooked by later writers until now.

==Textile machines==
Roberts moved his business in 1821, to the Globe Works in Faulkner Street. Whilst there he improved a reed-making machine, originally invented by the American Jeptha Avery Wilkinson, and in 1822 he patented a power loom. This was made entirely of iron and being precision-made was able to operate at high speed. They were turned out at the rate of 4,000 per year by 1825. In 1824 he invented his most famous machine, the self-acting spinning mule, and patented it in March 1825. These were made in hundreds, and Roberts made extensive use of templates and gauges to standardise production. By 1826 he was working in Mulhouse, Alsace with Koechlin &amp; Co where he contributed to the building of textile machinery for the French cotton industry.

==Sharp, Roberts &amp; Co.==
When developing his textiles machines, Roberts took as partners Thomas Sharp, an iron merchant, and his brother John Sharp, Robert Chapman, Thomas Jones Wilkinson and James Hill. They formed two firms, Sharp Hill &amp; Co and Roberts, Hills &amp; Co, and in May 1826 these were amalgamated to form Sharp, Roberts &amp; Co. The firm later became well known for making locomotives. In 1834 Charles Beyer joined the firm and contributed to its success in locomotive building as Roberts soon delegated most of the locomotive design work to Beyer.

Roberts was a prolific inventor and manufacturer, ranging over turret clock-making, to road vehicles, to iron ship building, to a punching machine, operating on the same system as the Jacquard loom, for punching the rivet holes in the iron plates making up the railway bridge over the river Conwy in North Wales.&lt;br&gt;
His Alpha turret clock won a prize medal at the Great Exhibition of 1851. He was not a particularly successful businessman, and Sharp, Roberts &amp; Co. closed in June 1852 (by which time the more successful Sharp, Stewart and Company were formed).

==Death and legacy==
Roberts continued as a consulting engineer and inventor until his death, taking out 18 patents. In 1860, aged 71 he moved to London, where he became financially distressed. Various friends, almost all engineers, raised a fund to help him, but he died in his daughter&#x27;s arms in London on 11 March 1864 aged 74. He was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London. His daughter later received a civil list pension in recognition of her father&#x27;s achievements.

He has been described as the most important British mechanical engineer of the 19th century. According to biographer Richard Leslie Hills, his main contribution was the introduction of improved machine tools without which high standards of accuracy could not be achieved. This laid the foundation of production engineering as we know it today, leading to the interchangeability of standard parts and mass production. The Roberts mechanism, a linkage for generating approximate straight-line movement, is named after him.

<text>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002, also known as FS2002, is a video game released in October 2001, and is the 8th installment of the &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; video game series. A version called &quot;Professional Edition&quot; was released at the same time as standard edition that added two aircraft, a flight instructor feature, and an editor to create buildings and aircraft.

==Gameplay==

FS2002 (8.0) improved vastly over previous versions. In addition to improved graphics, FS2002 introduced air traffic control (ATC) and artificial intelligence (AI) aircraft enabling users to fly alongside computer controlled aircraft and communicate with airports. An option for a target framerate was added, enabling a cap on the framerate to reduce stutter while performing texture loading and other maintenance tasks. In addition, aircraft feature a 3D virtual cockpit, creating in effect a view of the cockpit from the viewpoint of a real pilot. The external view also featured an inertia effect, inducing an illusion of movement in a realistic physical environment.

== Alterations due to September 11 attacks ==
Microsoft removed the scenery of the original World Trade Center from the game to respect the victims of the September 11 attacks shortly before it was released.

==Reception==
===Sales===
In the United States, &quot;Flight Simulator 2002&quot; debuted at #12 on NPD Intelect&#x27;s computer game sales rankings for October 2001, at an average retail price of $70. It was absent from the top 20 by November. By the end of 2001, the game&#x27;s domestic sales totaled 130,954 units, for revenues of $9 million. Internationally, the game received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

===Reviews and awards===
&quot;Flight Simulator 2002&quot; won &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s 2001 &quot;Best Simulation&quot; and the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; &quot;PC Simulation&quot; awards. The former publication&#x27;s editors wrote that the game &quot;narrowly prevailed&quot; against &quot;IL-2 Sturmovik&quot;, and commented that its winning despite having no &quot;guns, missiles or explosive pyrotechnic effects of any kind is remarkable testimony of the bleeding-edge quality of Microsoft&#x27;s benchmark product.&quot; &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; and &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; all nominated &quot;Flight Simulator 2002&quot; as the top simulation of 2001, but these awards went instead to &quot;IL-2 Sturmovik&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s editors called &quot;Flight Simulator 2002&quot; &quot;an excellent iteration of the esteemed series,&quot; and a game that &quot;took on the daunting task of increasing the detail level of the entire world at least a hundredfold.&quot;

<text>Walker Lake is a natural lake in the Great Basin in western Nevada in the United States. It is 11 mi (17 km) long and 5 mi (8 km) wide, in northwestern Mineral County along the east side of the Wassuk Range, about 75 mi (120 km) southeast of Reno. The lake is fed from the north by the Walker River and has no natural outlet except absorption and evaporation. The community of Walker Lake is found along the southwest shore.

Its name in the Northern Paiute language is Agai Pah, which means &quot;trout lake.&quot; Walker Lake and the surrounding area play a significant social and cultural role for many Northern Paiutes whose ancestors inhabited the area around the lake and depended on the lake&#x27;s fish and bird populations for food.

Throughout the 20th century, Walker Lake supported over 50% of the economy of Mineral County through tourism and recreation. From fishing derbies to boat races, water skiing to an annual Loon Festival, the lake was a key part of Mineral County and Walker River Paiute communities. 

More than a century of upstream irrigation diversions of the Walker River have left Walker Lake in a state of ecological collapse. As inflows have decreased and more water evaporated, the concentration of salts in the lake has increased dramatically. Walker Lake no longer supports fish life. Since the 1850s, Walker Lake has declined by 90% in terms of volume and more than 50% in terms of surface area.

Walker Lake is the focal point of significant restoration, conservation efforts, and litigation. Through the Walker Basin Restoration Program, former irrigation rights are being acquired and protected in instream for environmental benefit. The program delivered water to the lake in 2019 for the first time and aims to restore Walker lake to a state that supports fish and bird life. Mineral County and the Walker River Paiute Tribe have both brought litigation to protect Walker Lake and flows to the lower Walker River. These efforts have established the public trust doctrine in Nevada, though the lawsuit has yet to improve flows to the lake.


== History ==
The Walker River Paiute Tribe lived seasonally at the mouth of the Walker River at the time of European arrival. In Numu, their native language, the Walker River Paiute refer to themselves as Agai Ticutta, or &quot;Trout Eaters&quot;, speaking to the cultural importance of Lahontan Cutthroat Trout to the tribe. Since before European colonization, the lake has been home to annual festivals celebrating the harvests of pine nuts and, historically, fish.

The original boundaries of the Walker River Reservation contained Walker Lake, though subsequent allotment to white settlers removed the lake from the reservation.

As early as 1885, the impacts of irrigation diversions on Walker Lake had been noted by the United States Geological Survey:

&quot;Captain Simpson reports the Walker River at its mouth to be wide and from to deep on June 7, 1859. A measurement of the volume of the river about from its mouth, June 4, 1881, gave per second as the rate of flow. In October of the following year, its bed was dry, and little, if any, water reached the lake from this source. This decrease during the dry season is due in a great measure to the extensive use of its waters for irrigation in Mason Valley&quot;.

These diversions have resulted in a severe drop in the lake&#x27;s level. According to the USGS, the level dropped approximately between 1882 and 2016. By June 2016, the lake level was above sea level, the lowest lake elevation since measurement began in 1882. As of 2022, Walker Lake has decreased by 90% in volume and more than 50% by surface area. A lake that was once 1/2 the area of Lake Tahoe is now 1/4 the area.

The lower level of the lake has resulted in a higher concentration of total dissolved solids (TDS). As of the spring of 2016, the TDS concentration had reached 26 g/L, well above the lethal limit for most native fish species throughout much of the lake. Lahontan cutthroat trout no longer occur in the lake and recent work by researchers indicates that the lake&#x27;s tui chub have disappeared. The decline of the lake&#x27;s fishery is having a dramatic impact on the species of birds using the lake. By 2009, the town of Hawthorne canceled its Loon Festival because the lake, once a major stopover point for migratory loons, could no longer provide enough chub and other small fish to attract many loons.

==Conservation efforts==

Since the 2002 establishment of the Desert Terminal Lakes Program, Walker Lake has been the focus of significant restoration, conservation, and research. In approximately the first decade of the program, more than 100 peer-reviewed academic journal articles, presentations, posters, and research projects were made possible through federal funding.

Early research-informed conservation goals suggest a TDS level of 12,000 mg/L would support native fish life and allow migratory birds to flourish. To accomplish this goal, approximately of increased flows each year into Walker Lake are necessary. In 2009, legislation established the Walker Basin Restoration Program and gave the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation responsibility and authority for the program.

The Walker Basin Restoration Program restores and maintains Walker Lake while protecting the agricultural, environmental, and recreational interests of the basin. The program works with willing sellers in the Walker Basin to acquire water rights, rehabilitate former farms and ranchland, and reduce water use in the basin.

In 2012, NFWF filed its first application to protect water rights in-stream to Walker Lake. A seven-year legal battle ensued, and the first water was delivered to Walker Lake in 2019. As of 2022, the program had acquired more than per year of water rights, though only approximately 25% of that water has been protected in-stream due to protracted administrative and legal processes.

The program has completed more than 20 transactions and donated land to the Mason Valley Wildlife Management Area and Nevada State Parks. In 2018, the Walker Basin Conservancy donated more than and of the East Walker River to the State of Nevada to create the Walker River State Recreation Area.

The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation has been acquiring water rights to benefit the lake and has submitted applications to the Nevada State Engineer to transfer the water downstream to benefit the lake. In 2016, the Flying-M Ranch was acquired by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The purchase price was $19.4 million. Along with the Pitchfork and Rafter 7 Ranches, this property comprises the new State Park.

==Litigation==
Walker Lake is the traditional home of the Walker River Paiute Tribe. The Walker River Reservation was created in 1874 and specifically included acres to be farmed. In 1924, the United States in its trust capacity for the tribe filed suit claiming that the Tribe&#x27;s reserved rights to the flows of the Walker River were being impaired by upstream diversions. The 1936 Walker River Decree adjudicated water rights in the Walker Basin in California and Nevada. The decreed rights exceed the natural flows of the Walker River in most years, and the Decree grants no rights to flows into Walker Lake.

In 1994, Mineral County intervened in ongoing litigation over the Decree to claim that flows to Walker Lake were in the public interest and to re-open the decree to grant Mineral County rights to minimum flows of per year into Walker Lake. In 2013, the Nevada District Court granted the motion for a hearing. In 2018, the Ninth Circuit court certified questions to the Nevada Supreme Court, including [1] Does the public trust doctrine apply to rights already adjudicated and settled under the doctrine of prior appropriation and, if so, to what extent? and [2] If the public trust doctrine applies and allows for reallocation of rights settled under the doctrine of prior appropriation, does the abrogation of such adjudicated or vested rights constitute a “taking” under the Nevada Constitution requiring payment of just compensation?. The Nevada Supreme Court ruled that the state does have a public trust responsibility and has no statutory authority to re-balance water rights in the system. This has been construed as both a victory for environmentalists in the recognition of the public trust doctrine for Nevada&#x27;s waters and a major setback to increasing the flows to Walker Lake.

== Geography ==

Walker Lake is the namesake of the Walker Lane, the geological trough in which it sits that extends from Oregon to Death Valley and beyond. It was named after Joseph R. Walker, a mountain man who scouted the area with John C. Frémont in the 1840s.

The lakebed is a remnant of prehistoric Lake Lahontan that covered much of northwestern Nevada during the ice age. Although the ancient history of Walker Lake has been extensively studied by researchers seeking to establish a climatic timeline for the region as part of the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository study, this research has raised many puzzling questions.

== Recreation and infrastructure ==

The Walker Lake State Recreation Area, now known as Monument Beach, is located along the western shore of the lake. The Hawthorne Army Depot, the world&#x27;s largest ammunition depot, fills the valley to the south of the lake. U.S. Route 95 passes along the western shore of Walker Lake.

<text>The Science Power Platform (SPP; , &quot;Sci-Energy Platform&quot;, also known by Russian initialism NEP) was a planned Russian element of the International Space Station (ISS) that was intended to be delivered to the ISS by a Russian Proton rocket or Zenit rocket (it was originally designed to be part of Mir-2) but was shifted to launch by Space Shuttle as part as a tradeoff agreement on other parts of the ISS.

==History==
It would have provided additional power for the ISS as well as roll axis control capability for the orbital facility. If the Science Power Platform had been delivered to the ISS, it would have been attached to the zenith port of &quot;Zvezda&quot;, a position currently occupied by &quot;Poisk&quot;. The SPP would have had eight solar arrays and a robotic arm provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) dedicated to maintaining the SPP.

The SPP&#x27;s robotic arm (European Robotic Arm) was still added and is currently a part of the station, and launched together with the Russian &quot;Nauka&quot; Multipurpose Laboratory Module on 21 July 2021, after many delays.

An agreement was reached in March 2006 by the Russians and NASA in order to provide part of the power the Russian segments need from the four American solar arrays. Originally the SPP should have made the power supply of the four Russian modules independent from the power supply of the rest of the station. The already-made pressurised hull of a static test article for this component is now being used for the Russian Mini Research Module 1, which launched on STS-132 in 2010. &quot;Rassvet&quot; is docked to the &quot;Zarya&quot; nadir port.

RKK Energia, the manufacturer of the Russian Orbital Segment components, has proposed something similar to the original ISS plan with the addition of a nodal module (with six docking ports) and two additional science/energy modules called Science Power Module 1 and 2 to the segment around 2013-2015. The Science Power Modules would perform similar functions and would have solar arrays similar to the SPP, but unlike it the truss structure would be much smaller. As of 2021, the Science Power Module(s) (unknown whether one or two modules) is still being considered, but nothing has been launched. The nodal module, named &quot;Prichal&quot;, docked to the ISS on November 26, 2021.

<text>Mountain Corps Norway () was a German army unit during World War II. It saw action in Norway and Finland.

The corps was formed in July 1940 and was later transferred to Northern Norway as part of &quot; Armeeoberkommando Norwegen&quot; (&quot;army high command Norway&quot;). Its first action was taking part in Operation Renntier (&quot;reindeer&quot;), the occupation of Finnish Petsamo to protect the nickel mines there from USSR. In June 1941 the corps attacked from Petsamo to Murmansk in Operation Platinum Fox (German: &quot;Unternehmen Platinfuchs&quot;). The attack failed and the corps never reached its goal.
In April and May 1942 the corps faced one of its toughest challenges. Over a period of three weeks, the Soviet 14th Army attacked, trying to defeat the Corps. But there was another enemy - on 4 May 1942, a devastating, 90-hour-long polar storm took its toll on the soldiers.

In November 1942 the corps was renamed the XIX. Gebirgs-Armeekorps or XIX Mountain Corps.

In 1944 the corps finally had to retreat back to Norway, where it surrendered in May 1945. From November 1944 onwards the corps was also sometimes known as Armeeabteilung Narvik.

<text>Masaya () is a department in Nicaragua. It is the country&#x27;s smallest department by area (611 km2) and has a population of 397,632 (2021 estimate). The capital is the city of Masaya. It is famous among Nicaraguan people for its nickname, &quot;La Cuna Del Folklore&quot; which translates to (The Cradle of Folklore). It is also the site of the Masaya Volcano, an active 635m volcano which last erupted in 2016. The Indigenous inhabitants of Masaya are the Nahuas and the Chorotegas, and was the location of the pre-Columbian Nahua chiefdom of Masatepek. The Nahuas dominate the cultivation and production of cocoa beans in the municipality of Masatepe.

<text>Chuquicamata ( ; referred to as Chuqui for short) is the largest open pit copper mine in terms of excavated volume in the world. It is located in the north of Chile, just outside Calama, at above sea level. It is northeast of Antofagasta and north of the capital, Santiago. Flotation and smelting facilities were installed in 1952, and expansion of the refining facilities in 1968 made 500,000 tons annual copper production possible in the late 1970s. Previously part of Anaconda Copper, the mine is now owned and operated by Codelco, a Chilean state enterprise, since the Chilean nationalization of copper in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Its depth of makes it the second deepest open-pit mine in the world, after Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah, United States.

==Etymology==
There are several versions of the meaning of &quot;Chuquicamata&quot;. The most widely known seems to be that it means the limit (camata) of the land of the Chucos (chuqui). Another interpretation is that it means metal (chuqui) tipped wooden (camata) spear. A third interpretation is that it means the distance (camata) that a spear (chuqui) was thrown by an Atacameño to determine the size of the copper orebody that a god intended to give him. Yet another theory is that it means &#x27;Pico de Oro&#x27; or &#x27;Peak of Gold&#x27;.

==History==
Incas and Spanish explorers exploited the mineral deposits of Chuquicamata during the pre-colonial and colonial periods, and Chilean and English companies mined the brochantite veins from 1879 to 1912. The opencast was the biggest pit in the world during the 1990s, but has since been surpassed by the Escondida mine, which is now the world&#x27;s largest producing mine, with 750,000 metric tons of annual productions (5.6% of the world&#x27;s production in 2000). Copper has been mined for centuries at Chuquicamata, as evidenced by the 1899 discovery of the &quot;Copper Man,&quot; a mummy dated to 550 A.D. The mummy was found in an ancient mine shaft, apparently trapped by a rockfall— It is also related that Pedro de Valdivia obtained copper horseshoes from the natives when he passed through in the early 16th century.

Mining activity was relatively small scale until the War of the Pacific, when Chile annexed parts of both Peru and Bolivia, including Chuquicamata. At this time, a great influx of miners were drawn into the area by what was termed the &#x27;Red Gold Fever&#x27; (La Fiebre del Oro Rojo). Soon, Chuquicamata was covered with mines and over 400 mining claims at one point.

It was a wild and disorganized camp. Title claims were often in doubt due to the defective 1873 Mining Code and matters were further complicated after the capture of Calama during the 1891 Chilean Civil War when rebels confiscated mines belonging to loyalists. Many miners lived in makeshift and lawless shanty towns around the mines, including Punta de Rieles, Placilla, and Banco Drummond. These settlements provided miners with alcohol, gambling, and prostitution and murder was an almost daily occurrence. The army had to be sent in to maintain order as late as 1918. The towns were eventually buried under the waste dumps to east of the mine.

These early operations mined high grade veins like the Zaragoza and Balmaceda veins, which contained concentrations of up to 10-15% copper, leaving low grade disseminated ore. One attempt was made to process the low-grade ore in 1899-1900 by Norman Walker, a partner in La Compañia de Cobres de Antofagasta, but the attempt failed, leaving the company deeply in debt. Mining was never really fully developed at this time because of a lack of water, isolation, difficulty communicating, lack of capital, and fluctuations in the copper price. Nevertheless, larger mining companies eventually emerged, organized as commercial companies rather than mining operations to work around problems with the mining code. These companies started to buy up and consolidate small mines and claims. In 1951, a young Che Guevara documented visiting the mine with Alberto Granado in his memoir The Motorcycle Diaries, describing it as &quot;[...] a scene from a modern drama. You cannot say that it&#x27;s lacking in beauty, but it is a beauty without grace, imposing and glacial.&quot;
===Modern mine===
The modern era started when an American engineer named Bradley finally developed a method of processing low-grade oxidized copper ores. In 1910 he approached the lawyer and industrialist Albert C Burrage, who sent engineers to examine Chuquicamata. This was the beginning of copper mining by the Chile Exploration Company of the Guggenheim Group. Their reports found that the mine showed promise, and in April 1911, he started to buy up mines and claims, mainly from the larger mining companies, in association with Duncan Fox y Cia., an English entrepreneur.

Since Burrage did not have the capital to develop a mine, he approached the Guggenheim Brothers. They examined his claims and estimated the reserves at 690 million tonnes of 2.58% grade copper. The Guggenheims also had discovered a process for treating the low grade ores developed by Elias Anton Cappelen Smith and were immediately interested. They organised the Chile Exploration Company (Chilex) in January 1912 and eventually bought out Burrage for US$25 million (or $ million today) in Chile&#x27;s stock market. E. A. Cappelen Smith, consulting metallurgist for M. Guggenheim&#x27;s Sons, worked out the first process for the treatment of Chuquicamata copper oxide ore around 1913 and led a team of engineers operating a pilot plant in Perth Amboy, New Jersey for a year.

Chile then went ahead with the development and construction of a mine on the eastern section of the Chuquicamata field, gradually expanding it to include the rest of the field over the next 15 years. A leaching plant was planned with a capacity to produce 50,000 tons of electrolytic copper annually. Among the equipment purchased were steam shovels from the Panama Canal. A port and an oil-fired power plant were built at Tocopilla, to the West and an aqueduct was constructed to bring water in from the Andes. Production started on May 18, 1915. Production rose from 4,345 tonnes in the first year to 50,400 tonnes in 1920. The Guggenheims sold the mine to Anaconda Copper in 1923, and production increased to 135,890 tonnes by 1929 before the Great Depression hit and demand fell.
For many years, production came from the oxidized capping of the orebody, which only required leaching and then electrowinning the copper, but by 1951 the oxidized reserves were primarily exhausted. The company then built a mill, flotation plant and smelter to treat the enormous reserves of underlying supergene copper sulfides. These secondary sulfides arise from the leaching of the overlying ore and its re-deposition and replacement of the deeper primary (hypogene) sulfides.

In 1957 the Exotica deposit (South Mine) was discovered beneath tailings, and turned out to be the largest known deposit of exotic copper. This led Anaconda to build an oxide plant, concentrator, smelter, refinery, and town next to the mine, as well as a power plant in Tocopilla.

In 1971, the mine was nationalized and operations were then assumed by CODELCO.

For many years it was the mine with the largest annual production in the world but was recently overtaken by Minera Escondida. Nevertheless, it remained by far the mine with the largest total production (approximately 29 million tonnes) of copper until the end of 2007 (excluding Radomiro Tomić). Despite over 90 years of intensive exploitation, it remains one of the largest known copper resources. Its open pit is the world&#x27;s largest at long, wide and over deep and its smelter and electrolytic refinery (855,000 tonnes p.a.) are among the world&#x27;s largest. Chuquicamata is also a significant producer of molybdenum.

Chuquicamata is now amalgamated with the currently operational Radomiro Tomić mine to the north (on the same mineralized system), Ministro Hales mine to the south (formerly Mansa Mina) and the recently discovered &#x27;Toki cluster&#x27; of copper porphyries to form the &quot;&#x27;Codelco Norte&#x27;&quot; division of Codelco.

==Geology==
Chuquicamata belongs to the broad class of porphyry copper deposits. Practically, the entire Chuquicamata orebody is hosted by the Chuqui Porphyry Complex, made up of East, Fine Texture, West and Banco porphyries. These Cu-Mo porphyry systems formed during the Eocene-Oligocene and exhibit classic &quot;zoned alteration-mineralization features. A regional fault zone gave rise to hydrothermal activity which concentrated metal and sulfide minerals. The West Fault is a major fault that separates Chuquicamata into western and eastern parts. This fault is part of the Cenozoic West Fault System in Chile, extending several hundred kilometers in a general north-south to northeast strike direction. The Chuqui Porphyry Complex lies in the mineralized east part of the pit. In contrast, the barren Fortuna Complex lies in the west part.

A large proportion of the copper at Chuquicamata occurs in veins and veinlets filling faults and fault-related shatter zones. Pyrite is present everywhere, and chalcocite and covellite appears as both supergene and hypogene minerals. Molybdenite is conspicuous at Chuquicamata, almost all of it carried by quartz veins.

==Economic effects==

Copper mining has long been the most consistent Chilean export, and currently accounts for almost one-third of all foreign trade, down from a peak of almost 75%.

Copper has been mined in the land area between central Chile and southern Peru since the colonial period, but it was not until the 20th century that copper reached the same level of importance as other mineral exports such as saltpeter or silver. Before World War I, saltpeter was collected from abundant deposits of caliche in the Atacama Desert, and Chile was the primary source of nitrates in the world. After the war, the world market for saltpeter, Chile&#x27;s main export at the time, collapsed because of the production of artificial nitrates, first synthesized in Germany through a combination of the Haber process and the Ostwald process. As a result, Chile&#x27;s economy shifted toward dependence on the copper industry. During this period, copper was described as &quot;Chile&#x27;s salary&quot;.

By the late 1950s, the three largest copper mines in Chile were Chuquicamata, El Salvador mine, and El Teniente. Chuquicamata and El Salvador were owned and operated by the Anaconda Copper Company. These mines gave rise to largely self-contained and self-sustaining settlements, complete with housing for workers, water and electrical plants, schools, stores, railways, and police forces.

In 1971, Chile&#x27;s newly elected president Salvador Allende nationalized the Chuquicamata mine. Anaconda lost two-thirds of its copper production. After the Chilean military overthrew Allende in a CIA-backed coup in 1973, the new military government paid Anaconda $250 million in compensation.

After graduating from Hargrave High School in Huffman, Texas, in 1991, he attended Galveston College and Lewis–Clark State College in Idaho. He began his career in the minor-league system of the San Francisco Giants. During the season, Foulke was one of six prospects (along with Bob Howry, Lorenzo Barceló, Mike Caruso, Ken Vining, and Brian Manning) traded to the White Sox in exchange for Wilson Álvarez, Danny Darwin, and Roberto Hernández in what became known as the White Flag Trade.

In 1998, Foulke found a home in the White Sox bullpen, primarily serving as set-up man for closers Matt Karchner (who was traded to the Chicago Cubs in the middle of the season) and Bill Simas. In 1999, Foulke established himself as one of the league&#x27;s best relief pitchers, posting a 2.22 ERA in 105.1 innings of work over 67 games, however, he was still used primarily as a set-up man. His stellar season even netted him a vote for the 1999 AL Cy Young Award.

In 2000, Foulke again was an important piece of the White Sox bullpen. Though Bob Howry entered the season as the team&#x27;s primary closer, Foulke was seeing more and more time closing out games, and by April&#x27;s end he had recorded 4 saves (in 1999, he didn&#x27;t notch a save until June). As Howry continued to struggle, Foulke inherited the closer&#x27;s role and flourished, saving 34 games for the White Sox in 2000, and was a major reason the White Sox won the AL Central title.

On December 3, 2002, Foulke, along with catcher Mark Johnson, minor league pitcher Joe Valentine, and cash, was traded by the White Sox to the Oakland Athletics for closer Billy Koch and two minor leaguers. During the 2003 season with the Athletics, Foulke would distinguish himself as a closer, leading the league in saves and games finished, being named to the All-Star team and winning the American League Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award. However, it was Foulke who also gave up the game-winning double to David Ortiz in Game 4 of the American League Division Series that year.

Foulke was granted free agency on October 27, 2003, and signed with the Boston Red Sox.

===2004===
Foulke continued his dominance in his first year with the Red Sox, saving 32 games in 39 opportunities while racking up 79 strikeouts and a 2.17 ERA across 83 innings. In the 2004 postseason, Foulke appeared in 11 of 14 games, throwing 257 pitches over 14 innings. He would rack up 19 strikeouts and over the entire stretch would only allow exactly one earned run. While Foulke was marvelous (1.80 ERA) in the World Series, his most crucial work was in the American League Championship Series against the Yankees, when he pitched in five games and didn&#x27;t allow a run. With the Red Sox down, 3–0, in the series, Foulke threw 100 pitches over the next three days to help his team force Game 7. Foulke was on the mound when the final out was made in the 2004 World Series. He induced Édgar Rentería (who would be his teammate the next season) of the St. Louis Cardinals to hit a one-bounce ground ball back to him which he flipped to first, thus clinching the Red Sox&#x27; first World Series Championship since , ending the Curse of the Bambino. Fox commentator Joe Buck famously called the grounder with:

For the first half of the 2004 season, Foulke wore his Red Sox cap with an American flag patch on it to show support for American troops in Iraq. In July 2004, Foulke agreed to remove the flag patch to comply with MLB rules prohibiting individual players from altering their team&#x27;s uniform.

===2005===
Despite being the hero of the previous postseason, Foulke struggled to keep his job as closer as he battled knee injuries throughout 2005. His ERA ballooned to over 5.00 and he eventually lost the role of closer to Mike Timlin.

====&quot;Johnny from Burger King&quot;====
On June 28, 2005, after struggling with injuries and a 6.03 ERA to that point, Foulke lashed out at Red Sox fans, who were booing him.

&quot;They&#x27;re not going to make it any harder than it is for me to go home and look in the mirror&quot;, Foulke said about the booing that rained down from the stands on a sticky night in the Fens. &quot;Like I&#x27;ve told you guys plenty of times, I&#x27;m more embarrassed to walk into this locker room and look at the faces of my teammates than I am to walk out and see Johnny from Burger King booing me. I&#x27;m worried about these guys, not everybody else.&quot;

Foulke&#x27;s perceived lack of respect for Red Sox fans made him a target for both fans and the Boston media alike. His baseball heart was also questioned because he said he did not care if he was a closer, but clarified, &quot;I love to pitch. I don&#x27;t care if I pitch in the second inning, the fourth inning, the ninth inning, the 10th inning. I didn&#x27;t ask to be a closer. It&#x27;s just the job that I do.&quot;
The media also had a field day when they found out that Foulke demanded a new truck as compensation for his weekly interviews with Dale &amp; Holley on WEEI.

===2006===
The Red Sox had high expectations for Foulke in 2006, after two knee surgeries in the offseason. Manager Terry Francona was hoping to put Foulke back in the closer role, but after an inconsistent spring and early regular season games, Francona was quick to go to Jonathan Papelbon as the closer. Foulke pitched mainly as one of the team&#x27;s middle relievers, along with Mike Timlin, Julián Tavárez, and Rudy Seánez. Foulke continued to struggle, with an ERA of 5.63. On June 12, 2006, Foulke was put on the disabled list with right elbow tendinitis. Foulke was activated from the 15-day DL on August 18. In November 2006, Foulke opted for free agency.

===2007===
Foulke signed a one-year deal (with an option for a second year) with the Cleveland Indians for the 2007 season after passing a physical in January. However, Foulke announced his retirement on February 16, 2007, before ever putting on an Indians uniform. He cited pains in his elbow and injuries from the previous two seasons as the primary reason for ending his ten-year career. Pitchers and catchers reported one day earlier and the first spring workout was not scheduled until February 17. The announcement came as a shock to most people, as Foulke was slated to compete with Joe Borowski to fill the vacant closer&#x27;s role.

===2008===
On February 8, 2008, Foulke returned from retirement and signed a one-year contract with the Oakland Athletics, for whom he had previously closed in 2003.

===2009===
Foulke played for the Newark Bears in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.

==Scouting report==
From 2000 to 2004, Foulke was one of the top closers in baseball. At the peak of his career, he had an effective 87–91 MPH fastball and what many people considered to be one of the best circle changeups in the sport (which he could get down to 76 MPH, making for a 12–14 MPH difference in the two, a sign of a good changeup.) However, later in his career, his fastball ranged from 84–86 MPH while his changeup remained at 76 MPH. While solid against right-handed hitters, he is particularly lethal against lefties. His strikeout pitch is usually an inside circle changeup.

Foulke had good control, as evidenced by his career strikeout-to-walk ratio of 3.70. While he did not hold runners on base particularly well, he covered his position adequately and threw accurately to the bases. In 2004, he completed a fifth straight season without committing an error (71 total chances in 307 games). In addition, his unusual throwing motion provided him with the ability to mask his changeup well, though runners on base could easily see his grip from his exposed hand and potentially tip his pitches to teammates at bat.

==Personal life==
Foulke&#x27;s son Kade was raised in Florida and played both hockey and baseball before choosing to focus on the latter sport during high school. Before honoring his commitment to play college baseball at Galveston College, Kade Foulke played for the Brockton Rox.

Foulke&#x27;s father served in the United States Air Force.

<doc id="739127" wikidata="Q939297" url="?curid=739127" title="David Unaipon">
<text>David Ngunaitponi (28 September 1872 – 7 February 1967), known as David Unaipon, was an Aboriginal Australian preacher, inventor, and author. A Ngarrindjeri man, his contribution to Australian society helped to break many stereotypes of Aboriginal people, and he is featured on the Australian $50 note in commemoration of his work. He was the son of preacher and writer James Unaipon.

==Biography==
David Ngunaitponi was born on 28 September 1872 at the Point McLeay Mission on the banks of Lake Alexandrina in the Coorong region of South Australia, Unaipon was the fourth of nine children of James, a preacher, and Nymbulda Ngunaitponi. Both parents were speakers of Yaraldi, and members of the Portaulun branch of the Ngarrindjeri people. Unaipon began his education at the age of seven at the Point McLeay Mission School and soon became known for his intelligence, with the former secretary of the Aborigines&#x27; Friends&#x27; Association stating in 1887: &quot;I only wish the majority of white boys were as bright, intelligent, well-instructed and well-mannered, as the little fellow I am now taking charge of.&quot;

Unaipon left school at 13 to work as a servant for C.B. Young in Adelaide where Young actively encouraged Unaipon&#x27;s interest in literature, philosophy, science and music. In 1890, he returned to Point McLeay where he apprenticed to a bootmaker and was appointed the mission organist. In the late 1890s he travelled to Adelaide but found that his colour was a bar to employment in his trade and instead took a job as storeman for an Adelaide bootmaker before returning to work as book-keeper in the Point McLeay store.

He was later employed by the Aborigines&#x27; Friends&#x27; Association as a &quot;deputationer&quot;, in which role he travelled and preached widely in seeking support for the Point McLeay Mission. Unaipon retired from preaching in 1959 but continued working on his inventions into the 1960s.

===Inventor===
Unaipon spent five years trying to create a perpetual motion machine. In the course of his work he developed a number of devices. He was still attempting to design such a device in his seventy-ninth year.

Unaipon took out provisional patents for 19 inventions but was unable to afford to get any of his inventions fully patented, according to some sources. Muecke and Shoemaker say that between &quot;1910 and 1944 he made ten ... applications for inventions as varied as an anti-gravitational device, a multi-radial wheel and a sheep-shearing handpiece&quot;. Provisional patent 15,624 which he ratified in 1910, is for an &quot;Improved mechanical motion device&quot; that converted rotary motion which &quot;is applied, as for instance by an Eccentric&quot;,
into tangential reciprocating movement, an example application given being sheep shears. The invention, the basis of modern mechanical sheep shears, was introduced without Unaipon receiving any financial return and, apart from a 1910 newspaper report acknowledging him as the inventor, he received no contemporary credit.

Other inventions included a centrifugal motor and a mechanical propulsion device. He was also known as the Australian Leonardo da Vinci for his mechanical ideas, which included pre World War I drawings for a helicopter design based on the principle of the boomerang and his research into the polarisation of light; he also spent much of his life attempting to achieve perpetual motion. In his old age, he went back to his birthplace, where he worked on inventions further.

===Writer and lecturer===

Unaipon was obsessed with correct English and in speaking tended to use classical English rather than that in common usage. His written language followed the style of John Milton and John Bunyan.

Unaipon was the first Aboriginal author to be published, after he was commissioned in the early 1920s by the University of Adelaide to assemble a book on Aboriginal legends. His first article, &quot;Aboriginals: Their Traditions and Customs&quot;, was published on 2 August 1924 in the &quot;Sydney Daily Telegraph&quot;, after which he wrote numerous more articles. He published three short booklets of Aboriginal stories in 1927, 1928 and 1929. In this time he wrote on topics covering everything from perpetual motion and helicopter flight to Aboriginal legends and campaigns for Aboriginal rights.

His employment with the Aborigines&#x27; Friends&#x27; Association collecting subscription money allowed him to travel widely. The travel brought him into contact with many intelligent people sympathetic with the cause of Aboriginal rights, and gave him the opportunity to lecture on Aboriginal culture and rights. He was much in demand as a public speaker.

Unaipon was the first Aboriginal writer to publish in English, the author of numerous articles in newspapers and magazines, including the &quot;Sydney Daily Telegraph&quot;, retelling traditional stories and arguing for the rights of Aboriginal people.

Five of Unaipon&#x27;s traditional stories were published in 1929 as &quot;Native Legends&quot;, under his own name and with his picture on the cover.

Some of Unaipon&#x27;s traditional Aboriginal stories were published in a 1930 book, &quot;Myths and Legends of the Australian Aboriginals&quot;, under the name of anthropologist William Ramsay Smith. They have been republished in their original form, under the author&#x27;s name, as &quot;Legendary Tales of the Australian Aborigines&quot;.

==Other work==
Unaipon was a recognised authority on ballistics.

Unaipon was also involved in political issues surrounding Aboriginal affairs and was a keen supporter of Aboriginal self-determination, including working as a researcher and witness for the Bleakley Inquiry into Aboriginal welfare in 1928, and lobbied the Australian Government to take over responsibility for Aboriginal people from its constituent states. He proposed to the government of South Australia to replace the office of Chief Protector of Aborigines with a responsible board and was arrested for attempting to provide a separate territory for Aboriginal people in central and northern Australia.

In 1936, he was reported to be the first Aboriginal person to attend a levée, when he attended the South Australian centenary levée in Adelaide, an event that made international news.

Unaipon&#x27;s stance on Aboriginal issues put him into conflict with other Aboriginal leaders, including William Cooper of the Australian Aborigines&#x27; League, and Unaipon publicly criticised the League&#x27;s &quot;Day of Mourning&quot; held on the 150th anniversary of the arrival of the First Fleet, arguing that the protest would only harm Australia&#x27;s reputation abroad and would cement a negative public opinion of Aboriginal people.

==Honours and awards==
At the age of 81, Unaipon was awarded a Coronation Medal in 1953 celebrating the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

In 1985 he posthumously received the FAW Patricia Weickhardt Award to an Aboriginal Writer.

==Personal life==
On 4 January 1902 he married Katherine Carter (), a Tangane woman who died in 1928, but theirs was not a happy marriage.

Unaipon was inquisitively religious, believing in an equivalence of traditional Aboriginal and Christian spirituality. He was most influenced by Anglican and Congregational churches. During his travels to public speaking events, he was often refused accommodation due to his race. He said &quot;...in Christ Jesus colour and racial distinctions disappear...&quot; and that this thought helped him at such times.

==Death and legacy==
Unaipon died in the Tailem Bend Hospital on 7 February 1967 and was buried in the Raukkan (formerly Point McLeay) Mission Cemetery. He was survived by a son.

===Fifty-dollar note===
In 1995, Unaipon was featured on the first $50 polymer banknote. In 2018, the $50 note was upgraded, and the design enhanced to include representation of his Ngarrindjeri identity.

In late 2008, Aboriginal activist Allan &quot;Chirpy&quot; Campbell, a great-nephew of David Unaipon, failed in an attempt to negotiate a settlement with the Reserve Bank of Australia for using an image of Unaipon on the banknote without the permission of the family. Campbell&#x27;s argument was that the woman (who had since died) originally consulted by the Reserve Bank was not related to Unaipon. Campbell, who said that there was no evidence that the woman from whom permission was obtained in 1994, Melva Linda Carter, was in fact Unaipon&#x27;s great-niece, as she claimed. He was seeking  million in compensation, which he said he would use to establish a charity for mentally ill children. He was continuing to advocate on Facebook on this issue as of 2015.

===Other recognition===
Many tributes were paid to his life and work.

In 1988, two literary awards were created to honour Unaipon&#x27;s contributions:
* The David Unaipon Literary Award, an annual award presented for the best of writing of the year by unpublished Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander authors
* The David Unaipon Award for Aboriginal Writers, a national award

Also in 1988, the annual Unaipon lecture in Adelaide was established.

In 1992, Unaipon Avenue in the Canberra suburb of Ngunnawal was named after him.

In 1996, the Unaipon School, later named the David Unaipon College of Indigenous Education And Research, was established at the University of South Australia. It closed in 2015 when it was deemed unnecessary to have a separate campus for Indigenous students, and a different structure for catering for Indigenous students was adopted.

In 2004, An interpretive dance based on Unaipon&#x27;s life, &quot;Unaipon&quot;, was created and performed by the Bangarra Dance Theatre.

<doc id="739131" wikidata="Q17085795" url="?curid=739131" title="Thermae Bath Spa">
<text>Thermae Bath Spa is a combination of the historic spa and a contemporary building in the city of Bath, England, and reopened in 2006. Bath and North East Somerset council own the buildings, and, as decreed in a Royal Charter of 1590, are the guardians of the spring waters, which are the only naturally hot, mineral-rich waters in the UK. The Spa is operated by YTL Hotels.

The main spa building, the New Royal Bath, was designed by Grimshaw Architects and is constructed in Bath stone, enclosed by a glass envelope. It has two natural thermal baths, an open-air rooftop pool and an indoor pool, and a large Wellness Suite with two aromatic steam rooms, an Ice Chamber, Infrared Sauna and a Celestial Relaxation Room. It also has a cafe, three relaxation areas, and 27 spa treatment rooms, including the 18th century Hot Bath, in which water-based massage such as Watsu takes place. The separate Cross Bath is a grade I listed Georgian building containing one open-air thermal bath.

==History==
One of the city&#x27;s main attractions has long been its famous hot spa water, fed by the area&#x27;s hot springs. The Bath springs are the warmest geothermal springs found in the UK. These natural geothermal mineral springs fed into the Roman Baths complex, which was responsible for the prominence of Bath in the Roman period, as well as for the later development of Bath as the country&#x27;s leading eighteenth and early nineteenth-century health resort. In the middle of the 20th century, the city&#x27;s swimming pool sourced its water directly from the King&#x27;s Spring through one of three pipelines beneath the River Avon. However, the old municipal hot pools were closed in 1978 after the discovery of an infectious organism in one stratum of the aquifer. After that date, bathing was prohibited.

==Development==
With the approach of the year 2000, money from the National Lottery-funded Millennium Commission was made available towards a major project to reopen a safe commercial spa once more, supplemented by funds from subscribers and from the local authority.

Originally planned to open in 2002, and despite a formal opening with the aid of the Three Tenors in 2003, the project ran seriously behind schedule and over budget as a result of a variety of legal disputes with contractors: the project&#x27;s budgeted costs spiralled from an estimated £13 million in September 1996 to a final cost of £45 million.

==Present day==

Thermae Bath Spa eventually opened to the public on 7 August 2006, ending a 28-year period during which the waters remained unavailable for bathing.

The spa is largely sited in a new &#x27;Glass Cube&#x27; building by Sir Nicholas Grimshaw, near the site of the ancient Royal Bath, which has been interlinked with historic Georgian spa buildings such as the nearby Hot and Cross Baths. The building is in a strongly contemporary style in contrast to its Georgian surroundings. The complex houses both traditional and modern spa facilities.

A 2014 survey indicated the spa attracted an extra 260,000 visitors a year to Bath, who contributed an extra £15 million a year to Bath&#x27;s economy.

<doc id="739132" wikidata="Q600292" url="?curid=739132" title="Cupola (ISS module)">
<text>The Cupola is an ESA-built observatory module of the International Space Station (ISS). Its name derives from the Italian word &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;dome&quot;. Its seven windows are used to conduct experiments, dockings and observations of Earth. It was launched aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s mission STS-130 on 8 February 2010, and attached to the &quot;Tranquility&quot; (Node 3) module. With the &quot;Cupola&quot; attached, ISS assembly reached 85 percent completion. The &quot;Cupola&quot; central window has a diameter of .

== Overview ==
The &quot;Cupola&quot; provides an observation and work area for the ISS crew giving visibility to support the control of the space station remote manipulator system and general external viewing of Earth, celestial objects and visiting vehicles. The Cupola project was started by NASA and Boeing, but canceled due to budget cuts. A barter agreement between NASA and the ESA resulted in the &quot;Cupola&quot;″s development being resumed in 1998 by ESA.

The &quot;Cupola&quot; is important to astronauts aboard the ISS, who enjoy using the module to view and photograph the Earth. &quot;Cupola&quot; replaced the Russian &quot;Zvezda&quot; for such photographs. Previously they looked out of small portholes, or at best the window in the US &quot;Destiny&quot; laboratory. The &quot;Cupola&quot; is berthed onto the Earth-facing port of the &quot;Tranquility&quot; module. Because of its shape and multi window configuration the &quot;Cupola&quot; has been compared to the cockpit window of the Millennium Falcon.

== Design and construction ==


The International Space Station &quot;Cupola&quot; was first conceived in 1987 by Space Station Man-Systems Architectural Control Manager Gary Kitmacher as a workstation for operating the station&#x27;s Canadarm2 robotic arm, maneuvering vehicles outside the station, and observing and supporting spacewalks. He likened the use as similar to that of the Shuttle Orbiter Aft Flight Deck. There were to have been two Cupolas, one on either end of the racetrack shape formed by the station modules and nodes. It was initially named the &quot;windowed workstation&quot;, to distinguish it from other computer-based workstations inside of the station and from which the crew could operate the station&#x27;s systems.

Once the idea was initially accepted, a number of people went to work. Human factors specialist Frances Mount began to develop the rationale and operational scenarios for the &quot;Cupola&quot;, and got considerable support from Chief Astronaut John Young and Shuttle Commander Gordon Fullerton. Charles Wheelwright, who had defined the specifications for every window on every prior United States crewed spacecraft, began to define the design specifications of the &quot;Cupola&quot; windows. Laurie Weaver, who had just started with NASA as a student intern, began to work on a series of different configurations for the &quot;Cupola&quot;. She started with Kitmacher&#x27;s idea, based on the Shuttle Aft Flight Deck, in this case two Aft Flight Decks mounted back to back, placed atop a short cylinder. An inexpensive mock-up made of PVC tubes was built and tested underwater, where critical dimensions could be measured to ensure that two crew members in zero-g would have adequate access. Then she built a series of small cardboard models, looking at a variety of different alternative shapes. The different configurations and their positive and negative attributes were presented at a series of Crew Station Reviews over the next year in which participants rated each. The &quot;Cupola&quot; that evolved was octagonal in shape, with eight similar windows around the periphery, four quadrant windows overhead, and mounted on a cylinder. The module was designed to fully contain at least two crewmembers &quot;floating&quot; side by side in zero-g neutral body posture. About this time, Kitmacher and designer Jay Cory applied the term &quot;Cupola&quot; for the first time. Kitmacher wrote the requirements and the name into the Man-Systems Architectural Control Document and into the requests for proposals for Work Package 1 at MSFC and Work Package 2 at JSC. Later, Kitmacher went on to lead the Man-Systems group, leading the first lunar outpost and moonbase studies and the &quot;Cupola&quot; reappeared on several of his rover and module designs.

Because of confusion between the responsibilities of the two contracts, both Boeing, which won Work Package 1, and McDonnell Douglas, which won Work Package 2, bid to build the &quot;Cupola&quot;. The McDonnell Douglas design was basically the same as NASA&#x27;s, but Boeing&#x27;s was smaller — a hexagon, with a single large circular overhead window, and a much shorter cylinder. The Boeing design had been considered but previously discarded, because it was unable to accommodate two crew members completely, and would instead require the crew to dangle their legs and bodies in the Node to which the &quot;Cupola&quot; would be attached. This design was the one ultimately built.

===Manufacturing===
Components of the &quot;Cupola&quot; were initially fabricated in California, and the windows in New York in the late 1980s, but as budgets were cut, the &quot;Cupola&quot; was a favorite target. Several times it was fought back into the program only to be cut again as not technically required. More than once the responsibilities for fabrication were bartered to one international partner and then another in exchange for Shuttle launch services and resources that the United States would provide on board the station in orbit. The &quot;Cupola&quot; made the rounds to Brazil and then finally wound up with ESA and the Italians in 1998, who completed it in 2003. Even then, the launch of the &quot;Cupola&quot; was repeatedly delayed until it finally made it into orbit in February 2010. The delivery method also changed from the &quot;Cupola&quot; being mounted on a SpaceLab pallet accompanying &quot;Kibo&quot;&#x27;s external facility to being mounted on the European built &quot;Tranquility&quot; module as it was delivered.

The original barter agreement had ESA building two cupola modules for the ISS. This was later amended to just one. The ESA-built &quot;Tranquility&quot; module and the &quot;Cupola&quot; together cost nearly $409 m.

With final design and assembly by the Italian contractor Alenia Spazio (now merged into Thales Alenia Space), it is nearly 3 metres in diameter and 1.5 metres tall. It has six side windows and a top window, all of which are equipped with shutters to protect them from damage by micrometeoroids and orbital debris. It features a thermal control system, audio, video and MIL-STD-1553 bus interfaces, as well as the connections needed for installing one of the two identical workstations that control the robotic manipulator Canadarm2.
The &quot;Cupola&quot;″s outer framework was built by the Vereinigte Schmiedewerke in Hattingen, Germany. It is made from forged aluminum, with an inner skeleton made from steel plates and bars welded together; which add strength against the pressure. Several companies including Alcoa and Tata Steel Europe were contracted for the manufacturing. A protype is today exhibited in the Henrichshütte, LWL-Museen für Industriekultur.

Each window is composed of 4 separate layers (&#x27;panes&#x27;): An outer debris pane, two 25 mm pressure panes, and an inner scratch pane. Each pressure pane and debris pane is made from fused silica glass. The panes can be replaced in-orbit after an external pressure cover has been fitted.

The window shutters are manually controlled. Each window has a knob with a direct mechanical linkage to the outside shutter assembly. O-rings are used to prevent air leakage.

== Installation ==
&quot;Cupola&quot; was launched aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; on mission STS-130, on 8 February 2010. It was berthed to the forward port of the &quot;Tranquility&quot; module for launch, and was later transferred to the nadir-facing port of &quot;Tranquility&quot; by the Canadarm2, once &quot;Tranquility&quot; had been berthed to the &quot;Unity&quot; Module of the ISS. The installation of the &quot;Cupola&quot;, along with &quot;Tranquility&quot;, marked one of the last main components to be added to the International Space Station.

<doc id="739147" wikidata="Q5385815" url="?curid=739147" title="Ergodic literature">
<text>Ergodic literature is a term coined by Espen J. Aarseth in his 1997 book &quot;Cybertext—Perspectives on Ergodic Literature&quot; to describe literature in which nontrivial effort is required for the reader to traverse the text. The term is derived from the Greek words &quot;ergon&quot;, meaning &quot;work&quot;, and &quot;hodos&quot;, meaning &quot;path&quot;. It is associated with the concept of cybertext and describes a cybertextual process that includes a semiotic sequence that the concepts of &quot;reading&quot; do not account for.

== Concept ==
Aarseth&#x27;s book contains the most commonly cited definition of ergodic literature:

In ergodic literature, nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text. If ergodic literature is to make sense as a concept, there must also be nonergodic literature, where the effort to traverse the text is trivial, with no responsibilities placed on the reader except (for example) eye movement and the periodic or arbitrary turning of pages.

In addition to the above definition, Aarseth explained ergodic literature as two-fold: a normal text and a machine capable of producing several manifestations of a text. One of the major innovations of the concept of ergodic literature is that it is not medium-specific so long as the medium has the ability to produce an iteration of the text. New media researchers have tended to focus on the medium of the text, stressing that it is for instance paper-based or electronic. Aarseth broke with this basic assumption that the medium was the most important distinction, and argued that the mechanics of texts need not be medium-specific.

Ergodic literature is not defined by medium, but by the way in which the text functions. Thus, both paper-based and electronic texts can be ergodic: &quot;The ergodic work of art is one that in a material sense includes the rules for its own use, a work that has certain requirements built in that automatically distinguishes between successful and unsuccessful users.&quot;

== Cybertext ==

Cybertext is a subcategory of ergodic literature that Aarseth defines as &quot;texts that involve calculation in their production of scriptons&quot;. The process of reading printed matter, in contrast, involves &quot;trivial&quot; extranoematic effort, that is, merely moving one&#x27;s eyes along lines of text and turning pages. Thus, hypertext fiction of the simple node and link variety is ergodic literature but not cybertext. A non-trivial effort is required for the reader to traverse the text, as the reader must constantly select which link to follow, but a link, when clicked, will always lead to the same node. A chat bot such as ELIZA is a cybertext because when the reader types in a sentence, the text-machine actually performs calculations on the fly that generate a textual response. The I Ching is likewise cited as an example of cybertext because it contains the rules for its own reading. The reader carries out the calculation but the rules are clearly embedded in the text itself.

It has been argued that these distinctions are not entirely clear and scholars still debate the fine points of the definitions.

The concepts of cybertext and ergodic literature were of seminal importance to new media studies, in particular literary approaches to digital texts and to game studies.

==Examples==

Examples given by Aarseth include a diverse group of texts. All these examples require non-trivial effort from the reader, who must participate actively in the construction of the text.

<text>The Russian Research Module (RM) was to be a Russian component of the International Space Station (ISS) that provided facilities for Russian science experiments and research.

==History==
The original designs of ISS featured two research modules shaped like a rounded &quot;Zarya&quot; Functional Cargo Block, but Russian budget problems caused one of them along with the Universal Docking Module to be cancelled early in the program, leaving only one Research Module. This Research Module was scheduled to be built and launched in 2010 or later. In 2007 it was decided that, due to the continuing budget problems, the last Research Module was to be cancelled as well.

According to the schedule the module with scientific designation for the Russian Orbital Segment became the FGB-2 based Multipurpose Laboratory Module &quot;Nauka&quot; approved after the cancellation of the original RM1 and RM2.

Additionally the Russian Orbital Segment contains two smaller modules, initially named Mini-Research Module (MRM) 1 and 2. The MRM1 &quot;Rassvet&quot; implements the Docking and Stowage Module of the original design and is based on the canceled Science Power Platform pressurised compartment. Rassvet was launched in 2010 by STS-132 on board the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; by NASA. MRM2 is one of the names for the original Docking Compartment 2 module &quot;Poisk&quot;, that was canceled, but later scheduled again for 2009 launch by Progress M-MIM2.

RKK Energia, the manufacturer of the ROS components, proposes to execute a similar plan to the original ISS proposal with the addition of the nodal module &quot;Prichal&quot; in 2021 and two additional science/energy modules to the segment around the mid-2020s, though it has decided to launch the modules as their own space station.

<doc id="739150" wikidata="Q573852" url="?curid=739150" title="Uluburun shipwreck">
<text>The Uluburun Shipwreck is a Late Bronze Age shipwreck dated to the late 14th century BC, discovered close to the east shore of Uluburun (Grand Cape), Turkey, in the Mediterranean Sea. The shipwreck was discovered in the summer of 1982 by Mehmed Çakir, a local sponge diver from Yalıkavak, a village near Bodrum.

Eleven consecutive campaigns of three to four months&#x27; duration took place from 1984 to 1994 totaling 22,413 dives, revealing one of the most spectacular Late Bronze Age assemblages to have emerged from the Mediterranean Sea.

==Discovery==
The shipwreck site was discovered in the summer of 1982 due to Mehmet Çakir&#x27;s sketching of “the metal biscuits with ears” recognized as oxhide ingots. Turkish sponge divers were often consulted by the Institute of Nautical Archaeology&#x27;s (INA) survey team on how to identify ancient wrecks while diving for sponges. Çakir&#x27;s findings urged Oğuz Alpözen, Director of the Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology, to send out an inspection team of the Museum and INA archaeologists to locate the wreck site. The inspection team was able to locate several amounts of copper ingots just 50 metres from the shore of Uluburun.

==Apparent route==
With the evidence provided from the cargo on the ship it can be assumed that the ship set sail from either a Cypriot or Syro-Palestinian port. The Uluburun ship was undoubtedly sailing to the region west of Cyprus, but her ultimate destination can be concluded only from the distribution of objects matching the types carried on board. It has been proposed that ship&#x27;s destination was a port somewhere in the Aegean Sea. Rhodes, at the time an important redistribution centre for the Aegean, has been suggested as a possible destination. According to the excavators of the shipwreck, the probable final destination of the ship was one of the Mycenaean palaces, in mainland Greece.

==Dating==
Peter Kuniholm of Cornell University was assigned the task of dendrochronological dating in order to obtain an absolute date for the ship. A branch loaded on the ship was determined to exhibit tree-rings as late as 1305 BC; but given that no bark has survived it is impossible to determine if it had further, younger rings. It has been assumed that the ship sank not long after that date. Kuniholm later cautioned that the low quality of the sample does not allow an &quot;especially strong&quot; dating. After a radiocarbon calibration of the entire Anatolian dendrochronological sequence, Kuniholm suggested a new date, ca. 1327 BC.

Manning et al. made Radiocarbon dating tests on several samples of plant material from the site. A sample from the cedar keel of the ship was construed as providing a terminus post quem for the construction phase. Other samples, including perishable items from short-lived species, like rope and dunnage, were construed to have come on board the ship in the phase of the last voyage. The two phases constrained each other, and Bayesian statistics was used to produce date ranges of varying probabilities. The most likely date of the sinking of the ship was rounded up to 1320±15 years.

Based on ceramic evidence, it appears that the Uluburun sank toward the end of the Amarna period, but could not have sunk before the time of Nefertiti due to the unique gold scarab engraved with her name found aboard the ship. For now, a conclusion that the ship sank at the end of the 14th century BC is accepted.

The origins of the objects aboard the ship range geographically from northern Europe to Africa, as far west as Sicily and Sardinia, and as far east as Mesopotamia. They appear to be the products of nine or ten cultures. These proveniences indicate that the Late Bronze Age Aegean was the medium of an international trade perhaps based on royal gift-giving in the Near East.

According to a reconstruction by various scholars, the Uluburun shipwreck illustrates a thriving commercial sea network of the Late Bronze Age Mediterranean. In this case, a huge mixed cargo of luxury items, royal gifts and raw materials. Based on the findings, it has been suggested that Mycenaean officials were also aboard accompanying the gifts.

==Vessel==

The distribution of the wreckage and the scattered cargo indicates that the ship was between long. It was constructed by the shell-first method, with mortise-and-tenon joints similar to those of the Graeco-Roman ships of later centuries.

Even though there has been a detailed examination of Uluburun&#x27;s hull, there is no evidence of framing. The keel appears to be rudimentary, perhaps more of a keel-plank than a keel in the traditional sense. The ship was built with planks and keel of Lebanese cedar and oak tenons. Lebanese cedar is indigenous to the mountains of Lebanon, southern Turkey, and central Cyprus.
The ship carried 24 stone anchors. The stone is of a type almost completely unknown in the Aegean, but is often built into the temples of Syria-Palestine and on Cyprus. Brushwood and sticks served as dunnage to help protect the ship&#x27;s planks from the metal ingots and other heavy cargo.

==Cargo==
:&quot;This is a list of the cargo as described by Pulak (1998).&quot;
The Uluburun ship&#x27;s cargo consisted mostly of raw materials that were trade items, which before the ship&#x27;s discovery were known primarily from ancient texts or Egyptian tomb paintings. The cargo matches many of the royal gifts listed in the Amarna letters found at El-Amarna, Egypt.

*Copper and tin ingots
**Raw copper cargo totaling ten tons, consisting of a total of 354 ingots of the oxhide ingot type (rectangular with handholds extending from each corner).
**Out of the total number of ingots at least 31 unique two-handled ingots were identified that were most likely shaped this way to assist the process of loading ingots onto specially designed saddles or harnesses for ease of transport over long distances by pack animals.
**121 copper bun and oval ingots.
**The oxhide ingots were originally stowed in 4 distinct rows across the ship&#x27;s hold, which either slipped down the slope after the ship sank or shifted as the hull settled under the weight of the cargo.
**Lead-isotope analysis indicates that most or all of the copper is sourced in Cyprus. 
**Approximately one ton of tin (when alloyed with the copper would make about 11 tons of bronze).
**Tin ingots were oxhide and bun shaped.
**In 2022 one third of the tin was found to come from the Mušiston mine in Uzbekistan. The other share likely came from the Kestel mine in Turkey&#x27;s Taurus Mountains. The ingots suffer from corrosion and likely contamination. However, unlike some other tin ingots from the eastern Mediterranean, they do not fit the profile of tin from Cornwall, and generally compare to ores from Sardinia. More recent research disputed these results.
*Canaanite jars and Pistacia resin
**At least 149 Canaanite jars (widely found in Greece, Cyprus, Syria-Palestine, and Egypt).
**Jars are categorized as the northern type and were most likely made somewhere in the northern part of modern-day Israel.
**One jar filled with glass beads, many filled with olives, but the majority contained a substance known as Pistacia (terebinth) resin, an ancient type of turpentine.
**Recent clay fabric analyses of Canaanite jar sherds from the 18th Dynasty site of Tel el Amarna have produced a specific clay fabric designation, and it is seemingly the same as that from the Uluburun shipwreck, of a type that is exclusively associated in Amarna with transporting Pistacia resin.
*Glass ingots
**Approximately 175 glass ingots of cobalt blue, turquoise, and lavender were found (earliest intact glass ingots known).
**Chemical composition of cobalt blue glass ingots matches those of contemporary Egyptian core-formed vessels and Mycenaean pendant beads, which suggests a common source.
*Miscellaneous cargo
**Logs of blackwood from Africa (referred to as ebony by the Egyptians).
**Ivory in the form of whole and partial hippopotamus and elephant tusks.
**More than a dozen hippopotamus teeth.
**Tortoise carapaces (upper shells).
**Murex opercula (possible ingredient for incense).
**Ostrich eggshells.
**Cypriot pottery.
**Cypriot oil lamps.
**Bronze and copper vessels (four faience drinking cups shaped as rams’ heads and one shaped as a woman&#x27;s head).
**Two duck-shaped ivory cosmetics boxes.
**Ivory cosmetics or unguent spoon.
**Trumpet.
**More than two dozen sea-shell rings.
**Beads of amber (Baltic origin).
**Agate.
**Carnelian.
**Quartz.
**Gold.
**Faience.
**Glass.
*Jewelry, gold, and silver
**Collection of usable and scrap gold and silver Canaanite jewelry.
**Among the 37 gold pieces are: pectorals, medallions, pendants, beads, a small ring ingot, and an assortment of fragments.
**Biconical chalice (largest gold object from wreck).
**Egyptian objects of gold, electrum, silver, and steatite (soap stone).
**Gold scarab inscribed with the name of Nefertiti.
**Bronze female figurine (head, neck, hands, and feet covered in sheet gold).
*Weapons and tools
**Arrowheads.
**Spearheads.
**Maces.
**Daggers.
**Lugged shaft-hole axe.
**A single armor scale of Near Eastern type.

==Excavation==
The Institute of Nautical Archaeology (INA) began excavating in July 1984 under the direction of its founder, George F. Bass, and was then turned over to INA&#x27;s vice president for Turkey, Cemal Pulak, who directed the excavation from 1985 to 1994. The wreck lay between 44 and 52 meters deep on a steep, rocky slope riddled with sand pockets. Half of the staff members who aided in the excavation lived in a camp built into the southeastern face of the promontory, which the ship most likely hit, while the other half lived aboard the &quot;Virazon&quot;, INA&#x27;s research vessel at the time. The excavation site utilized an underwater telephone booth and air-lifts. The mapping of the site was done by triangulation. Meter tapes and metal squares were used as an orientation aid for excavators. Since the completion of the excavation in September 1994, all efforts have been concentrated on full-time conservation, study, and sampling for analysis in the conservation laboratory of the Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology in Turkey.

<text>Nueva Segovia () is a department in Nicaragua. It covers an area of 3,491 km2 and has a population of 275,291 (2021 estimate). Nueva Segovia is also home to the indigenous Chorotegas and Nahuas. The capital is Ocotal.

==History of Las Segovias==
Las Segovias is a region encompassed by the five departments of northern Nicaragua: Estelí, Jinotega, Madriz, Matagalpa, and Nueva Segovia. The natural boundaries, are bordered on the north by the mountains around Dipilto, Jalapa and Mozonte, which extend to the Coco River. On the southern border, the area is bounded by the mountains around the towns of La Trinidad and San Nicolás, which sweep downward to the valleys between Sébaco and El Sauce. Towards the east the river valleys bordering La Concordia, Jinotega, San Sebastián de Yalí and Wiwilí de Jinotega form the demarcations of the natural boundary.

Finally, on the west the boundary extends from the slope of a mountainous triangle which extends to the coastal plain adjacent to the Pacific Ocean encompassing Estelí, San José de Cusmapa, and San Juan de Limay.

In pre-Columbian times the region was inhabited by Native American people known as Mayangnas and Matagalpas. Later arrivals include the Nahua from Mexico and the Chorotega peoples from Cholula. One of the first regions of Nicaragua to be colonized by the Spaniards, the conquistadors established the city of &quot;Vieja&quot; and later &quot;Antigua&quot;, to implement the &quot;Corregimiento&quot; system over the indigenous inhabitants. The &quot;corregidor&quot; served as a type of mayor to administrate a district, exploiting the local populations to mine gold and other minerals for Spain. The Spanish period decimated the indigenous population reducing its numbers from estimates of 75,000 people to 4,500 at the end of their occupation.

After gaining its independence, Nicaragua drafted the Constitution of 1858, which established seven departments: Chinandega, Chontales, Granada, León, Matagalpa, Nueva Segovia, and Rivas. The Department of Jinotega was created from Matagalpa in 1892. Simultaneously, the Estelí Department was created from Nueva Segovia. Nueva Segovia was further divided in 1936 with the creation of the Madriz Department.

In 1926, during the United States occupation of Nicaragua &quot;Las Segovias&quot; became the center of the guerrilla warfare led by Augusto César Sandino, who established a network of espionage agents and collaborators from the local population. In 1933, during the negotiations for peace in the region, Sandino asked newly elected president Juan Bautista Sacasa to create a large autonomous department covering the area of &quot;Las Segovias&quot;. Sandino&#x27;s plan would have allowed him to administer the department and manage the civilian and military authorities. The government rejected the plan, giving the rebels only a small colony on the banks of the Coco River, where the former troops were allowed to farm.

<text>Baron Christoph Freiherr Fellner von Feldegg (13 October 1779 – 10 May 1845, Leipzig) was an Austrian army officer and naturalist.

Fellner was born in a noble family in Krumau, Bohemia, where his father was a princely forester in Schwarzenberg. Fellner went to a military academy in Vienna and in 1808, became a sub-lieutenant in an army battalion and fought in the Battle of Aspern-Essling under Archduke Karl. He also served in the Regiment de Vaux in 1813 where he distinguished himself. In 1815 he was knighted in the Military Order of Maria Theresa. Feldegg fought in the Napoleonic wars and in recognition of his many gallant deeds was created a Baron in 1817. He served in Dalmatia, eventually becoming Colonel and Commanding Officer of the 6th Battalion of Chasseurs.

Feldegg took a special interest in the birds of Dalmatia and accumulated a large collection of natural history specimens. He was a correspondent of C. L. Brehm, John Gould and Hermann Schlegel, and served for a time with the ornithologist Dr Karl Michahelles. His collection was donated to the Natural History Museum in Prague.

Feldegg had a number of birds named after him, including a subspecies of the Lanner falcon &quot;Falco biarmicus feldeggi&quot; and the black-headed wagtail, &quot;Motacilla flava feldegg&quot;, the Balkan and Black Sea sub-species of the yellow wagtail.

<text>Rivas () is a department of the Republic of Nicaragua. It covers an area of and has a population of 183,611 (2021 estimate). The department&#x27;s capital is the city of Rivas. The indigenous inhabitants of Rivas are the Nicarao, and was the location of the pre-Columbian Nahua chiefdoms of Kwawkapolkan and Kakawatan.

==History==
In the pre-Columbian era, Rivas was home to the Nahua nations of Kwawkapolkan, and Kakawatan, as well as neighbouring Chibcha tribes. Kwawkapolkan was the most powerful chiefdom in pre-Columbian Nicaragua, ruled by chief Macuilmiquiztli, and translates to &quot;place of capulín trees&quot; in Nawat. It&#x27;s a combination of the Nawat words &quot;Kwawit&quot; (tree), &quot;kapolin&quot; (capulín), and &quot;-kan&quot; (a locative meaning &quot;place of&quot;). Kwawkapolkan extended from Rivas down to Bagaces in central Guanacaste in Costa Rica.

Kakawatan was another Nahua chiefdom in Rivas, ruled by chief Wemak who was Macuilmiquiztli&#x27;s cousin. Wemak also had a warrior son named Eskuat, though he wasn&#x27;t mentioned by Spanish sources again. The name &quot;Kakawatan&quot; is a combination of the Nawat words &quot;kakaw&quot; (Cacao), &quot;at&quot; (water), and &quot;-tan&quot; (locative suffix meaning land/place of). Therefore Kakawatan translates to &quot;land of cacao water&quot;, referring to chocolate drinks, one the most important aspects of Nicarao culture. This tradition is still practiced in the communities of Rivas among the descendants of the Nahuas both indigenous and mestizos alike.

Chibcha minorities lived and thrived within Kwawkapolkan and Kakawatan alongside the Nahua majority. Chibchas also served in the Nahua chiefdoms armed forces to further integrate into Nahua society, as military service provided social advancement and assimilation. The cultivation of potatoes in Kwawkapolkan and Kakawatan also suggests cultural diffusion between the Nahuas and Chibchas, as the Chibchas introduced potatoes to Nicaragua from South America which did not reach northern Mesoamerica. Before and during spanish contact, Kakawatan and Kwawkapolkan had a military alliance and were in a constant state of war with the Chorotegas, the Kingdom of Nicoya, and later fought together against the Spanish. Kwawkapolkan and Kakawatan sent their armies as far north as Carazo during their wars against the Chorotegas, and as far south as the Nicoya Peninsula and southern Guanacaste during their military campaigns against the Kingdom of Nicoya and the Huetares.

==Overview==
Rivas is known for its fertile soil and beaches. Throughout the department, there are many sugar cane, plantain, tobacco, and other crop plantations. The department borders Lake Nicaragua to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The southern part of the department borders with Costa Rica. A small fishermen village, called San Juan del Sur, has turned into a popular tourist attraction because of its access to beaches in the area. Another major tourist attraction is Ometepe, a large volcanic island inhabited by about 32,000 people (2005 census). Nawat Nicarao people still inhabit the department.

<doc id="739166" wikidata="Q2358071" url="?curid=739166" title="Inverse Galois problem">
<text>In Galois theory, the inverse Galois problem concerns whether or not every finite group appears as the Galois group of some Galois extension of the rational numbers formula_1. This problem, first posed in the early 19th century, is unsolved.

There are some permutation groups for which generic polynomials are known, which define all algebraic extensions of formula_1 having a particular group as Galois group. These groups include all of degree no greater than . There also are groups known not to have generic polynomials, such as the cyclic group of order .

More generally, let be a given finite group, and a field. If there is a Galois extension field whose Galois group is isomorphic to , one says that is realizable over.

==Partial results==
Many cases are known. It is known that every finite group is realizable over any function field in one variable over the complex numbers formula_3, and more generally over function fields in one variable over any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Igor Shafarevich showed that every finite solvable group is realizable over formula_1. It is also known that every simple sporadic group, except possibly the Mathieu group , is realizable over formula_1.

David Hilbert showed that this question is related to a rationality question for :

:If is any extension of formula_1 on which acts as an automorphism group, and the invariant field is rational over then is realizable over 

Here &quot;rational&quot; means that it is a purely transcendental extension of formula_1, generated by an algebraically independent set. This criterion can for example be used to show that all the symmetric groups are realizable.

Much detailed work has been carried out on the question, which is in no sense solved in general. Some of this is based on constructing geometrically as a Galois covering of the projective line: in algebraic terms, starting with an extension of the field formula_8 of rational functions in an indeterminate . After that, one applies Hilbert&#x27;s irreducibility theorem to specialise , in such a way as to preserve the Galois group.

All permutation groups of degree 16 or less are known to be realizable over the group PSL(2,16):2 of degree 17 may not be.

All 13 non-abelian simple groups smaller than PSL(2,25) (order 7800) are known to be realizable over 

==A simple example: cyclic groups==
It is possible, using classical results, to construct explicitly a polynomial whose Galois group over formula_1 is the cyclic group for any positive integer . To do this, choose a prime such that ; this is possible by Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem. Let be the cyclotomic extension of formula_1 generated by , where is a primitive -th root of unity; the Galois group of is cyclic of order .

Since divides , the Galois group has a cyclic subgroup of order . The fundamental theorem of Galois theory implies that the corresponding fixed field, , has Galois group over formula_1. By taking appropriate sums of conjugates of , following the construction of Gaussian periods, one can find an element of that generates over and compute its minimal polynomial.

This method can be extended to cover all finite abelian groups, since every such group appears in fact as a quotient of the Galois group of some cyclotomic extension of formula_1. (This statement should not though be confused with the Kronecker–Weber theorem, which lies significantly deeper.)

===Worked example: the cyclic group of order three===
For , we may take . Then is cyclic of order six. Let us take the generator of this group which sends to . We are interested in the subgroup } of order two. Consider the element . By construction, is fixed by , and only has three conjugates over formula_1:
: , 

Using the identity:

one finds that
: ,

Therefore is a root of the polynomial

which consequently has Galois group over formula_1.

==Symmetric and alternating groups==
Hilbert showed that all symmetric and alternating groups are represented as Galois groups of polynomials with rational coefficients.

The polynomial has discriminant

:formula_15

We take the special case

Substituting a prime integer for in gives a polynomial (called a specialization of ) that by Eisenstein&#x27;s criterion is irreducible. Then must be irreducible over formula_16. Furthermore, can be written

:formula_17

and can be factored to:

:formula_18

whose second factor is irreducible (but not by Eisenstein&#x27;s criterion). Only the reciprocal polynomial is irreducible by Eisenstein&#x27;s criterion. We have now shown that the group is doubly transitive.

We can then find that this Galois group has a transposition. Use the scaling to get

:formula_19

and with

:formula_20

we arrive at:

which can be arranged to

Then has as a double zero and its other zeros are simple, and a transposition in is implied. Any finite doubly transitive permutation group containing a transposition is a full symmetric group.

Hilbert&#x27;s irreducibility theorem then implies that an infinite set of rational numbers give specializations of whose Galois groups are over the rational field In fact this set of rational numbers is dense in 

The discriminant of equals

:formula_21

and this is not in general a perfect square.

===Alternating groups===
Solutions for alternating groups must be handled differently for odd and even degrees.

====Odd degree====
Let

:formula_22

Under this substitution the discriminant of equals

:formula_23

which is a perfect square when is odd.

====Even degree====
Let:

:formula_24

Under this substitution the discriminant of equals:

:formula_25

which is a perfect square when is even.

Again, Hilbert&#x27;s irreducibility theorem implies the existence of infinitely many specializations whose Galois groups are alternating groups.

==Rigid groups==
Suppose that are conjugacy classes of a finite group , and be the set of -tuples of such that is in and the product is trivial. Then is called rigid if it is nonempty, acts transitively on it by conjugation, and each element of generates .

 showed that if a finite group has a rigid set then it can often be realized as a Galois group over a cyclotomic extension of the rationals. (More precisely, over the cyclotomic extension of the rationals generated by the values of the irreducible characters of on the conjugacy classes .)

This can be used to show that many finite simple groups, including the monster group, are Galois groups of extensions of the rationals. The monster group is generated by a triad of elements of orders , , and . All such triads are conjugate.

The prototype for rigidity is the symmetric group , which is generated by an -cycle and a transposition whose product is an -cycle. The construction in the preceding section used these generators to establish a polynomial&#x27;s Galois group.

==A construction with an elliptic modular function==
Let be any integer. A lattice in the complex plane with period ratio has a sublattice with period ratio . The latter lattice is one of a finite set of sublattices permuted by the modular group , which is based on changes of basis for . Let denote the elliptic modular function of Felix Klein. Define the polynomial as the product of the differences over the conjugate sublattices. As a polynomial in , has coefficients that are polynomials over formula_1 in .

On the conjugate lattices, the modular group acts as . It follows that has Galois group isomorphic to over formula_27.

Use of Hilbert&#x27;s irreducibility theorem gives an infinite (and dense) set of rational numbers specializing to polynomials with Galois group over The groups include infinitely many non-solvable groups.

<text>The Institute of Nautical Archaeology (INA) is an organization devoted to the study of humanity&#x27;s interaction with the sea through the practice of archaeology.

==History==
INA&#x27;s founder Dr. George Bass pioneered the science of underwater excavation in the 1960s through work at Cape Gelidonya and other ancient shipwreck sites off the coast of Turkey. Since then, INA has expanded its scope and activities to work globally on shipwrecks and submerged sites. In 1976, the affiliation of INA with Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas gave rise to the graduate Nautical Archaeology Program there. Hundreds of archaeologists have received their training at Texas A&amp;M and today, after more than four decades of the Nautical Archaeology Program&#x27;s existence.

INA is a not-for-profit group founded in 1972 and recognized by the U.S. Government in 1973. Today it has members all over the world and counts among them professional archaeologists, students, and many others from all walks of life.

==Mission==
INA&#x27;s mission is to bring history to light through the science of shipwrecks. INA&#x27;s members apply standards of science and art to locating, excavating, recording, preserving, and publishing shipwrecks and other archaeological sites of maritime significance all over the world. They do so to add to humanity&#x27;s understanding of seafaring&#x27;s role in the development of civilization. Three-quarters of the earth is covered by water, and in the fabric of human history, the most pervasive thread is our association with the planet&#x27;s oceans, rivers and lakes.

The Institute of Nautical Archaeology works for the public to share what nautical archaeologists do, with anyone with an interest. INA is also committed to the preservation of the world&#x27;s shipwrecks and other archaeological sites, but specifically to finding the most significant sites and excavating them to unlock their secrets.

INA&#x27;s professional and volunteer members and affiliates have conducted fieldwork in Africa, Asia, Australia, the Americas, and Europe. They have worked on the world&#x27;s oldest known shipwrecks, and on wrecks as recent as World War II. Their work has improved the understanding of ancient trade in the Mediterranean, the development of the ship, shipbuilding in the Ancient World, the saga of European expansion into the New World, and wars for the control of the Americas.

<doc id="739177" wikidata="Q1073511" url="?curid=739177" title="Tekken 4">
<text>is a 2001 fighting game developed and published by Namco for arcades. It was developed for Namco&#x27;s System 246 hardware and then ported to the PlayStation 2 home console in 2002. It is the fourth main installment in the &quot;Tekken&quot; series as the sequel to &quot;Tekken 3&quot; (1997), and the fifth overall following the non-canon title &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot; (1999). The game harbored many gameplay revisions, such as the series-unique ability for the player to move about before the round begins and the introduction of walled stages.

There are up to twenty-three playable characters, of which six are newcomers, including Steve and Christie. Placing distinction on the plot in the console version, the tone of &quot;Tekken 4&quot; was noticeably darker than other installments in the series. The game notably features the canonical return of Kazuya Mishima, whose story reveals that he was revived following his death 20 years prior and has entered the King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 to take back the Mishima Zaibatsu from his father Heihachi Mishima and seek out his son Jin Kazama.

&quot;Tekken 4&quot; received generally favorable reviews. The gaming community reception or reception of established veteran players was initially mixed, with competitive players pointing out its juggling and traditional gameplay replaced by realism such as uneven floors and walls and more aggression and poking, akin to fencing. However in recent years, &quot;Tekken 4&quot; has recovered to the point of being widely praised, and this is largely for its innovation in gameplay, atmosphere, and attention to detail. The story was especially praised. Some gamers and reviewers have called it the pound-for-pound best game in the series. Its sequel, &quot;Tekken 5&quot;, was released in 2004.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Tekken 4&quot; introduced significant new gameplay changes from the previous games in the series, finally going for more realism. It added significantly more gameplay features and modes than its predecessor Tekken Tag Tournament. For the first time, it allowed players to maneuver around an arena interacting with walls and other obstacles for extra damage. These &quot;environmental hazards&quot; in turn allowed players to juggle opponents for consecutive combos and allowed the designers to implement a &quot;switch maneuver&quot;, which let players escape from cornering and turn the tide in their favor. The game engine had been tweaked to be more focused on the environment, causing the characters to move more slowly and fluidly than in &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot;. The balance was also better in Tekken 4 than in Tekken Tag Tournament. Finally, the game introduced a brand new graphics system, that featured increased lighting, dynamic physics, and smoother surfaces.

The console version of &quot;Tekken 4&quot; includes a beat &#x27;em up minigame available from the outset, called &quot;Tekken Force&quot;. Similar to the previous minigame found in &quot;Tekken 3&quot;, it presents the player with an over-the-shoulder perspective as they fight wave upon wave of Heihachi&#x27;s &quot;Tekken Force&quot; through four stages, facing Combot, then Kuma, then Kazuya, and eventually facing Heihachi himself, with his clothing changing if Heihachi is selected to fight himself. The player can pick up health and power-ups while fighting waves of enemies. In the minigame it is discovered that the Tekken Force possesses different ranks in the organization, evident in different amounts of stamina, strength, and skill. A new Story mode in the home version unlocks cutscenes when played, in contrast to previous installments in which such cutscenes were unlocked from playing the Arcade mode. The modern practice mode also developed in Tekken 4, with life bars as well as the near full move list now available in practice. There were also new modes such as pure defensive training to diversify the practice mode and make it more accessible to newcomers. The game also features the usual combos and hack tips to unlock certain win pose animations, which were completely different and have not been changed since the first game.

==Characters==

The arcade version features a total of 21 characters, consisting of 16 returning and 5 new ones, including the Irish-English boxer Steve Fox who is revealed to be the son of Nina Williams. The returning characters include some who did not make the cut in the 19-year time skip between &quot;Tekken 2&quot; and &quot;Tekken 3&quot;. The console version adds two characters (one returning and one new), both palette swaps of existing ones. 10 characters are available by default, with the rest being unlocked by clearing Story Mode multiple times.

===New characters===
* Christie Monteiro: A Capoeira student in search for her friend and teacher, Eddy Gordo.
* Combot : A general purpose robot created by the Violet Systems who is able to mimic other characters&#x27; fighting styles.
* Craig Marduk: An undefeated Vale Tudo fighter who had killed Armor King and is joining the tournament under the lure of Armor King&#x27;s student King II
* Miharu Hirano : The best friend of Ling Xiaoyu.
* Steve Fox: A young boxing champion who seeks to find out about his past.
* Violet : The alter-ego of Lee Chaolan.

==Plot==
Two years after the King of Iron Fist Tournament 3, Heihachi Mishima and his scientists have captured samples of Ogre&#x27;s blood and tissue to splice with Heihachi&#x27;s genome, to make him immortal. The experiment fails since Heihachi lacks the necessary Devil gene. His grandson, Jin Kazama, possesses the Devil gene but has been missing since the previous tournament. Meanwhile, Heihachi learns that the body of his son, Kazuya Mishima, who also had the Devil gene and whom Heihachi killed by throwing into a volcano twenty-one years ago, is in storage in the labs of the G Corporation, a cutting-edge biotech firm and the Mishima Zaibatsu&#x27;s sole corporate rival. Heihachi sends his Tekken Forces to raid the G Corporation facility to retrieve Kazuya&#x27;s body, but the mission fails when the forces are wiped out by Kazuya himself, who was secretly restored to life a few days after his death and kept hidden from the world since. Unknown to Heihachi, Jin has been in a self-imposed training exile in Brisbane, to unlearn the Mishima karate style and master traditional karate, loathing anything to do with his bloodline since Heihachi&#x27;s betrayal.

In an attempt to lure Kazuya and Jin out, Heihachi announces the King of Iron Fist Tournament 4, with the ownership of the Mishima Zaibatsu being the top prize. At the seventh stage, where Kazuya and Jin are posed to fight one another, Jin fails to appear, having been ambushed and captured by the Tekken Forces, and Kazuya is declared the winner by default, though he suspects his son has been abducted. He faces Heihachi in the final round and defeats him, but then goes with Heihachi to the ancient Mishima compound Hon-Maru, where Jin has been chained to the ceiling. The Devil awakens inside Kazuya, knocks Heihachi out of the room and awakens Jin, intending to absorb Jin&#x27;s Devil gene and complete himself. Jin overpowers and defeats Kazuya as Heihachi awakens and challenges his grandson. Though weary, Jin also defeats Heihachi and prepares to kill him, but he is stopped by a vision of his mother Jun Kazama. Subtly warning Heihachi that this will be the final time that he is shown mercy, Jin flies through the roof of Hon-Maru into the night.

==Development and release==
At E3 2001, Namco showed a teaser for &quot;Tekken 4&quot;. In a June 2001 investor meeting in Tokyo, Namco mentioned &quot;Tekken 4&quot; as being one of the games central to its PlayStation 2 strategy. A playable arcade demo was shown at a Tokyo event the same month, with eight of the ten announced characters playable. On August 21, 2001, Namco shared its first American locations for the arcade version. The Korean PlayStation 2 version, which predated the American and European versions by two months, introduced Korean voice lines for Hwoarang that were also used in those versions.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Tekken 4&quot; on their September 1, 2001 issue as being the most-successful arcade game of the month and was the top selling fighting game that year. It also received positive reviews overall and attracted the game to many newcomers, but only received mixed feedback from veteran players in the international gaming community at the time of its initial release. This is despite the fact that the game was still successful at the known Evolution Championships 2004 and at the Arcadia Tournament, which was the top fighting game tournament in Japan in the 2000s. The game sold even more in Japan than its successor and Tekken 6, though much less copies worldwide. However, the lower sales had less to do with the game and its serious tone, but actually in retrospective reviews had more to do with the decline in fighting game popularity in general, which coincided with the decline in arcade popularity in the early to mid 2000s when it developed into a niche market outside Japan, where it remains very mainstream to this day. The game sold over two million copies at the standard PS2 price a year later. As of 2024, Harada revealed that Tekken 4 has fully grown in stature and has already sold over 4,350,000 copies, the same amount as its predecessor Tekken Tag Tournament, despite when the games were only sold in PS2 copies and were not available in other platforms. This success also occurred when fighting game sales reached a brief nadir at the turn of the century.

&quot;Tekken 4&quot; has received an averaged score of 81.35% at GameRankings with almost 60 reviews and 79/100 at Metacritic. &quot;Edge&quot; gave it a mediocre review, highlighting the game&#x27;s experimental and pretty nature, and that overall it is a more solid and thoughtful proposition than its predecessor, but concluded that the game feels &quot;over-familiar and curiously uninspired.&quot; On the other hand, GameSpot&#x27;s Greg Kasavin referred to it as &quot;one of the better fighting games in years&quot; and &quot;an extremely solid, long-lasting, accessible, and fun-to-play fighting game that comes from one of the world&#x27;s best developers of the genre.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; named &quot;Tekken 4&quot; the best PlayStation 2 game of September 2002, and nominated it for the publication&#x27;s &quot;Best Fighting Game of 2002&quot; award.IGN&#x27;s Jeremy Dunham noted the walls and confined spaces as &quot;probably Namco&#x27;s wisest decision,&quot; and called the game &quot;a solid fighter in every sense of the word.&quot;
 A lot of these features and interactive environments remained and have influenced future fighting games, especially in Tekken 8. It was the first Tekken game to win the prestigious D.I.C.E. Award for Fighting Game of the Year. Pursuant to its known critical acclaim, it was even nominated for a BAFTA award.

The story of Tekken 4 was also heavily praised. The game itself hired new voice actors in order to portray actual cutscenes rather than a silent style of storytelling as in previous games, which was a first in fighting game history. It was considered the most serious and one of the darkest tales in the Mishima Saga, without completely abandoning some comical relief characters such as Kuma and Marshall Law. Together with this was the tone and atmosphere, which features known classic songs such as the jazz track ‘’Bit Crusher’’ at the actual Shinjuku crossing stage, airplane mixed electronic song ‘’Touch and Go’’ at the Philadelphia airport stage, and piano-grunge themed ‘’Authentic Sky’’ at the Tokyo building rooftop, among others, that added a strong atmospheric feel to the game that has never been explored in an artistic manner before. Director Katsuhiro Harada aimed for such feel for the game, in order to increase its modernity in line with the new 21st century. The game also built on the popularity of its predecessor, by exploring the story of the series’s main protagonist Kazuya Mishima, and his recent activity during the time-skip in the story. His appearance was also changed, but did not reflect his age, as he stayed young and was only made to be more heavily scarred. It accentuated his hairline and his red iris, to emphasize the character&#x27;s development toward choosing evil and embracing revenge. The artwork and the grunge theme, mixed with electronic-jazz music and gritty tones helped improve the visual aspect of the game design as well.

===Legacy===
Many critics have noted the innovations introduced in Tekken 4, such as interactive environments in stages and the first full-use of voice acting and win pose animations in fighting games. These environments, where columns are broken and the crowds play a part, have been brought back in Tekken 8. Other gamers have commented Tekken 4 was so far ahead, as the last leap Tekken has made in new ideas, to the point of calling it the best in the series. The praise for the story, music, atmosphere, and character development, as well as having the rawest and most serious tone in the series, has gone on to grow significantly in acclaim over the ensuing decades. The game also was the first exploration into an aggressive gameplay where backdashing or the habit of running backward was minimized for aggressive poking, such aggressiveness which was not explored again until Tekken 8. The game itself also lessened the number of fantasy characters to opt for a more humanist stance to the story. The game still maintained some of the ludicrous elements and humor that connected with past audiences, as well as a bit of the older electronic dance music, but not to the extent of later games. The development of the characters and the struggle between the devil gene or good and evil was also explored fully for the first time in the game. Tekken 4 also beyond its realism and immersive experience worked to eliminate juggling, and considerably lengthened the cutscenes than in previous games, which were around ten seconds long prior to Tekken 4. Harada has gone on to call Tekken 4 the best game in the series weeks after the 2024 Evolution Championship Series, in an interview with commentator and former champion Justin Wong.

<doc id="739179" wikidata="Q589359" url="?curid=739179" title="Tekken 2">
<text>is a 1995 fighting game developed and published by Namco. The second entry in the &quot;Tekken&quot; series, it was released for arcades in August 1995, and was ported to the PlayStation in 1996. The home console version introduced new, now-staple game modes to the series, as well as full-motion video endings for every character. It was re-released as a playable game within &quot;Tekken 5&quot; on PlayStation 2 (PS2) in 2005, digitally on PlayStation Network for PS3 and PSP in 2007, and on PlayStation Plus for PS4 and PS5 in 2023.

There are 25 playable fighters in the game, which includes 17 returning veterans from the original &quot;Tekken&quot; and eight newcomers, including Jun Kazama and Lei Wulong. The former boss, Heihachi Mishima, is now playable from the start as he seeks revenge in the plot, with Kazuya becoming the new antagonist. &quot;Tekken 2&quot; was a critical as well as commercial success, with about 40,000 arcade units and PlayStation copies sold worldwide, and becoming one of the best-selling PlayStation games. Critics praised its graphical visuals and light sourcing, as well as its deep system of moves and combos, and the soundtrack. It has been cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. &quot;Tekken 2&quot; was followed by a sequel, &quot;Tekken 3&quot; (1997).

==Gameplay==

The gameplay in &quot;Tekken 2&quot; is much like its predecessor &quot;Tekken&quot; with a few additions. It continues to use 2D backgrounds in its stages, an infinite playing field and a fighting system that utilizes four buttons: left punch, right punch, left kick and right kick. Distinct additions included attack reversals for some characters, back throws, chain-throws and a sidestep unique to two characters, Kazuya Mishima and Heihachi Mishima. However, Yoshimitsu has a spinning sidestep move that lowers his health. Tackles were also modified to inflict damage when running from a greater distance. Each time the game is beaten with one of the default available characters in arcade mode, the associated sub-boss character becomes selectable.

The home console version of &quot;Tekken 2&quot; introduced various modes that would become staples to the series. These include Survival mode, Team Battle mode, Time Attack mode and Practice mode. Survival mode takes the player through an endless number of matches to see how many opponents they can defeat without being defeated themselves. In addition, any health lost during a match will carry over to the next match, but the player would regain a little bit more health. Team Battle mode allows the player to select up to eight characters to participate in single-round matches. Like Survival mode, any health lost during a match will carry over to the next match, but the player will regain a small amount. The player will also keep their character for the next match until they are eliminated, in which the next character will take their place. The mode ends when all characters on either team are eliminated. Time Attack mode is similar to Arcade mode, except it is played to see how fast the player can go through it and beat records. Finally, Practice mode allows a player to train their skills in using a selected character&#x27;s moves and techniques against a training dummy.

==Characters==
The game features a total of 25 playable fighters, consisting of 17 returning veterans and eight newcomers. Characters who were clones in the original game have been made into distinct playable characters, although they still share many moves with their counterparts. Devil Kazuya, originally a bonus palette swap of Kazuya in the console version of the first game, is now a fully separate playable character with unique moves, serving as the final boss.

Ten of the twenty-five playable fighters are available by default; the other fifteen were made available via the arcade version&#x27;s &quot;time release&quot; system and individual secret codes, whilst the home console version requires the player to clear Arcade Mode with specific characters. As with the first game, the character select screen only displays the ten default fighters, with the unlockable fighters available to select by scrolling past the screen. The screen defaults the character option to Jun Kazama, but the arcade version contains a code that can toggle it to Baek Doo San and vice versa.

===New characters===
* Alex : A genetically-altered boxing dinosaur.
* Angel : A mysterious entity connected to Kazuya.
* Baek Doo San : A taekwondo practitioner whom Marshall Law challenges in the tournament to avenge his dojo.
* Bruce Irvin : A Muay Thai kickboxer who suffers from amnesia and is now serving as one of Kazuya&#x27;s personal bodyguards.
* JACK-2: An updated JACK model who replaces the previous JACK and is sent to battle Prototype Jack.
* Jun Kazama: A mixed martial artist and animal rights activist sent to arrest Kazuya.
* Lei Wulong: A Hong Kong cop practicing five form Kung-Fu, also sent to arrest Kazuya.
* Roger : A genetically-altered boxing kangaroo.

===Returning characters===
&lt;br&gt;
==Plot==
2 years after the King of the Iron Fist Tournament, the Mishima Zaibatsu, under the leadership of Kazuya Mishima, has become more powerful than ever before and is involved in many illegal operations. While his father Heihachi Mishima was rather ruthless in his endeavors, Kazuya acts completely without a conscience. He hires assassins to eliminate any of his critics and rivals, extorts money from several businesses and organizations, and smuggles endangered species to conduct genetic experiments on them. The reason for his evil deeds is that he has allowed the Devil within him to consume his soul and mind as a result of his hatred towards Heihachi.

Meanwhile, Kazuya is sentenced to being arrested by animal rights activist and operative Jun Kazama for his experiments. Heihachi on the other hand, whom Kazuya had defeated and thrown off a cliff 2 years ago, has climbed back up and is training himself, plotting to overthrow Kazuya and take back the Mishima Zaibatsu. In an attempt to rid himself of Heihachi and his enemies once and for all, Kazuya announces the King of Iron Fist Tournament 2, with a large cash prize of 1,000,000,000,000 dollars, knowing that Heihachi will appear in an attempt to get his revenge.

When Jun enters the tournament and eventually comes face to face with Kazuya, she tries to arrest him, but instead, the two can not help being drawn to one another, propelled by a mystic force beyond Jun&#x27;s control. Besides her duty to arrest Kazuya, who smuggles protected animals, she wants to free Kazuya of his evil power and drops out of the tournament as a result. 

Meanwhile, during the tournament, Heihachi defeats the opposing fighters, including his adopted son Lee Chaolan, who had sided with Kazuya and worked for him as a secretary at the Mishima Zaibatsu. Despite his victory, however, Heihachi was defeated by Kazuya&#x27;s old rival, Paul Phoenix, in the semi-finals of the tournament. Thus, Paul had earned the right to have a rematch with Kazuya.

Later on, the tournament officials reinstated Heihachi, allowing him to replace Paul in the finals when the latter was forced to forfeit after getting stuck in traffic due to a multi-car collision on the expressway and, therefore, unable to make the match on time. At some point during this time, Jun was able to cause an internal conflict within Kazuya, weakening Devil&#x27;s hold over him. 

Despite her efforts, Jun fails to prevent Kazuya from going on to meet his father, Heihachi, in the tournament finals, to which Heihachi confronts Kazuya, and they battle once again. Kazuya is too weak to overpower Heihachi because of the internal conflict between his evil side - Devil - and his good side - an unknown entity called Angel, which was brought forth after his past meeting with Jun. 

After defeating Kazuya in the finals, Heihachi throws Kazuya&#x27;s unconscious body into a volcano before escaping on a helicopter just as the volcano erupts behind him, taking revenge and regaining the Mishima Zaibatsu. In the meantime, Jun, who became pregnant after her past meeting with Kazuya during the tournament, gives birth to Kazuya&#x27;s illegitimate son Jin Kazama, resulting in her leaving everything behind to raise their child.

==Development and release==
&quot;Tekken 2&quot; development took about seven months before its release in August 1995. The updated &quot;Ver. B&quot; followed in October the same year. Each of the characters in &quot;Tekken 2&quot; is composed of roughly 800 polygons and took between three days and a week to model. Roger the Kangaroo originated as a pet project of one of the development team members, who designed and modeled the character in his free time. When he showed Roger to some of his colleagues in the development team, they pushed to include the character in the game. Adding the kangaroo character, as well as Alex the raptor and the devil, was also a way to break with the realism that was offered by rival series &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;. Much of the time developing the PlayStation conversion was devoted to rewriting the code to fit the console&#x27;s memory, which is roughly half the size of the game data used in the arcade version.

&quot;Tekken 2&quot;″s port to the PlayStation includes unique CGI endings for every character and numerous modes such as Survival, Time Attack, Team Battle and Practice mode. It contains arranged music, like the port of the first game.

&quot;Tekken 5&quot; on the PlayStation 2 features the emulated arcade version of &quot;Tekken 2&quot; (&quot;Ver. B&quot;) as a playable bonus in the Arcade History mode. &quot;Tekken 2&quot; standalone is also available for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable (both based on the PlayStation version), on Zeebo via ZeeboNet, and PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 via PS Plus Premium (also based on the PlayStation version).

== Soundtrack ==
The music in &quot;Tekken 2&quot; was composed mainly by Yoshie Takayanagi and Yoshie Arakawa. The arrangements in the console version were handled by a large team (&quot;Namco Sound Team&quot;) consisting of Yoshie Arakawa, Shinji Hosoe, Ayako Saso, Nobuyoshi Sano, Takayuki Aihara, Hiroto Sasaki and Keiichi Okabe. The ending music, &quot;Landscape Under The Ghost - KAMIMANO&quot; was composed by Akira Nishizaki and Takashi Furukawa, with Ryoko Shiraishi being the vocalist. Additional compositions in the game are credited to Hideaki Mitsui.

Official soundtrack CDs, &quot;Tekken 2 Strike Fighting Vol.1&quot;, &quot;Tekken 2 Strike Fighting Vol.2&quot;, and &quot;Tekken 2 Strike Arranges&quot;, were released by NEC Avenue in Japan in June, July and August of 1996 respectively. In 2020, &quot;TEKKEN 2&quot; (&quot;Original Soundtrack&quot;) was released by Lace Records as an LP record.

==Reception==
===Commercial===
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Tekken 2&quot; on their September 15, 1995 issue as being the most-successful arcade game of the month. It went on to become a major worldwide arcade hit. In Japan, it sold about 15,000 arcade units and became the highest-grossing arcade video game of 1996. It was also highly successful overseas, selling 25,000 arcade units outside of Japan, for a total of about 40,000 arcade units sold worldwide . In the United States, &quot;RePlay&quot; reported &quot;Tekken 2&quot; was the second most-popular arcade game at the time. It also topped the &quot;Play Meter&quot; arcade conversion kit chart in March 1996, and became one of the top five highest-grossing arcade conversion kits of 1996. In Australia, it was the fourth top-grossing arcade conversion kit in March 1996.

The PlayStation port also became a major worldwide hit. In Japan, it sold more than one million units by October 1996, and over by the end of the year, becoming the best-selling video game of 1996 in Japan. In North America, it sold nearly copies within four months. In Europe, it sold 420,000 copies by December 1996, becoming the year&#x27;s second best-selling PlayStation game in Europe.

In Germany, it received a Gold award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland for sales above 100,000 copies. Worldwide sales of the PlayStation version exceeded units by early 1998, and units .

===Critical===
The game was acclaimed by game critics, with the PlayStation version holding a 93% rating at GameRankings. Critics praised the game&#x27;s light sourcing, fluid character movement, detailed backgrounds, complex system of moves and combos, accessibility to inexperienced gamers, large set of playable characters, and the practice mode, which several critics predicted would become a standard feature in fighting games. Crispen Boyer of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; called it &quot;the best 3-D fighting game you can find for any system&quot; and &quot;GamePro&quot;, further comparing it to fighting games still in development, assured gamers that it would be at least a year before &quot;Tekken 2&quot; would be topped. It received a number of Game of the Year awards from various publications.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the arcade version of the game, and stated: &quot;It&#x27;s the style of body slamming and wrestling moves that sets this game apart from its closest cousin, &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot;, which makes it of interest. And the variation of moves and combinations surely place this game near the top of the heap, though the game is still not truly 3D in viewing perspective.&quot;

In 1996, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; ranked the game 12th on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;. In 1997, &quot;&quot; named the PlayStation port of &quot;Tekken 2&quot; one of the &quot;Top 25 PlayStation Games of All Time&quot; at number three, describing it as better than the arcade version in many regards due to added features and &quot;one of the best fighting games ever.&quot; In a 1999 retrospective review, &quot;Official UK PlayStation Magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;The very best in its day, &quot;Tekken 2&quot; is still virtually perfect&quot;. It was also listed among the best games of all time by &quot;Next Generation&quot; in 1996, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (both staff and readers) in 1997, &quot;Game Informer&quot; in 2001, &quot;GameSpot&quot; in 2006, &quot;Empire&quot; in 2009 and &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; in 2009.

Footballer David James was a notable fan of the game, crediting his passion for the game as the reason why his performance declined.

<doc id="739181" wikidata="Q1062106" url="?curid=739181" title="Tekken 3">
<text>is a 1997 fighting game developed and published by Namco. It is the third installment in the &quot;Tekken&quot; series and the first game built on the Namco System 12 arcade hardware. Plotwise, the game takes place twenty years after &quot;Tekken 2&quot; (1995) and features a largely new cast of characters, including the debut of several now-staple characters such as Jin Kazama, Ling Xiaoyu and Bryan Fury, and adds sidestepping ability to every character in-game&quot;. Tekken 3&quot; was ported to the PlayStation in 1998 with additional content, including a beat &#x27;em up mode called Tekken Force.

The game was a major hit for both arcades and consoles, selling 35,000 arcade units and 8.36 million PlayStation copies worldwide, making &quot;Tekken 3&quot; the fifth best-selling PlayStation game. Since its release, &quot;Tekken 3&quot; has been cited as one of the greatest games of all time. It was followed by &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot; (1999) and its direct sequel is &quot;Tekken 4&quot; (2001). Later, &quot;Tekken 3&quot;&#x27;s arcade version was included within &quot;Tekken 5&quot; on PlayStation 2, while the console port was re-released as part of Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Classic.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Tekken 3&quot; maintains the same core fighting system and concept as its predecessors. Three-dimensional movement is insignificant in previous &quot;Tekken&quot; games (aside from some characters having unique sidesteps and dodging maneuvers), but &quot;Tekken 3&quot; adds emphasis on the third axis by allowing characters to sidestep in or out of the background. Fighters now jump more reasonable heights than in the previous games, making them less overwhelming and putting more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping can no longer dodge every ground attack. Reversals, introduced for some characters in &quot;Tekken 2&quot;, were now available to all characters. New improvements include quicker recoveries from knockdowns, more escapes from tackles and stuns, more moves with juggling enabled, and newly created combo throws.

&quot;Tekken 3&quot; introduces a beat &#x27;em up minigame called &quot;Tekken Force&quot;, which pits the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. The concept was expanded on in a minigame for &quot;Tekken 4,&quot; and succeeded by the &quot;Devil Within&quot; campaign mode in &quot;Tekken 5&quot;. Another minigame is known as &quot;Tekken Ball&quot;, similar to beach volleyball, where the player must hit the ball with a powerful attack to pulverize the opponent, or cause them penalty damage by letting the ball fall into the opponent&#x27;s territory. 

==Characters==
The arcade version features a total of 21 playable characters. Because the game takes place 20 years after &quot;Tekken 2&quot;, only seven characters from the previous installment return, with the rest being new.

The console version adds two new characters, Dr. Bosconovitch and Gon, and also makes Anna Williams, a palette swap of Nina Williams in the arcade version, into a distinct character with her own moveset, voice clip, and ending. There are also several unplayable enemies faced only during the Tekken Force minigame. The console version only features 10 characters available by default, with the rest being unlocked by fulfilling various conditions.

==Plot==
15 years after the King of the Iron Fist Tournament 2, Heihachi Mishima has established the Tekken Force: a paramilitary organization dedicated to the protection of the Mishima Zaibatsu. Using the company&#x27;s influence, Heihachi is responsible for many events that have ultimately led to world peace. One day, a squadron of Tekken Force soldiers searched an ancient temple located in Mexico under the premise of an excavation project. Soon after arriving there, Heihachi learns that they were obliterated by a mysterious and malevolent creature known as Ogre. Having captured a brief glimpse of Ogre before its immediate disappearance, Heihachi seeks to capture Ogre in the hopes of harnessing its immense fighting power for his own personal gain. Soon after, Nina Williams was awakened from Dr. Bosconovitch&#x27;s cold-sleep machine. Various known martial artists end up dead, attacked, or missing from all over the world, with Ogre behind all of it. 

Jun Kazama has been living a quiet life in Yakushima with her young son, Jin Kazama, fathered during the events of the previous tournament by Heihachi&#x27;s son, Kazuya Mishima. However, their peaceful life is disrupted when Jun begins to sense Ogre&#x27;s encroaching presence, and knowing she is now a target, Jin is instructed to seek Heihachi if anything happens. Sometime after Jin&#x27;s 15th birthday, Ogre attacks. Against Jun&#x27;s wishes, Jin valiantly tries to fight Ogre off, but Ogre knocks him unconscious. When Jin awakens, he finds that the ground surrounding his house has been burnt and his mother is missing and most likely dead. Driven by revenge, Jin is confronted by the Devil, which brands Jin&#x27;s left arm and possesses him. Jin goes to his grandfather, Heihachi, and explains his situation to him, begging him for training to become strong enough to face Ogre. Heihachi accepts and takes Jin under his wing, as well as sending him to Mishima High School where Jin meets a classmate named Ling Xiaoyu and her pet Panda. He also met Hwoarang during a street fight in which they fought to a draw, leading to a persistent rivalry.

4 years later, Jin masters the Mishima karate style. On Jin&#x27;s 19th birthday, Heihachi announces the King of Iron Fist Tournament 3, and Jin himself prepares for his upcoming battle, having no idea that his grandfather is secretly using him, Xiaoyu, Hwoarang, and the rest of the competitors as bait to lure Ogre out into the open.
When Nina Williams was awakened from Dr. Bosconovitch&#x27;s cold-sleep machine, she suffered amnesia. Now controlled by Ogre, Nina acts robotically, with the command to assassinate Jin. 

During the tournament, Jin managed to bring Nina back to her senses by defeating her, allowing her to break free from Ogre&#x27;s control. Jin went on to narrowly defeat Hwoarang after an hours-long fight, very similar to the fight between his father, Kazuya, and his rival Paul Phoenix. Near the end of the tournament, Paul makes it to the finals after defeating the other competitors, including Kuma and Heihachi in the previous rounds. Paul enters a large temple, defeats Ogre in a fierce battle, and walks away from the tournament, thinking he is victorious. However, unbeknownst to Paul, Ogre morphs into his 2nd, monstrous form known as &quot;True Ogre&quot; after absorbing Heihachi&#x27;s fighting force when the latter had tried to capture it while it was unconscious. 

Because of this, the tournament continued as a result, with the tournament officials reinstating Jin and allowing him to replace Paul in the finals. From there, Jin confronts True Ogre in an intense fight and manages to defeat it as True Ogre completely dissolves, thus Jin succeeded in avenging his mother&#x27;s death and winning the tournament. Despite his hard-fought victory, Jin is suddenly gunned down by a squadron of the Tekken Force led by Heihachi, who no longer needs him, he personally fires a final shot into his grandson&#x27;s head. Jin, who is unexpectedly revived by the Devil within him, reawakens and dispatches the soldiers, smashing Heihachi through the wall of the temple. Jin then sprouts black, feathery wings and flies off into the night as Heihachi, who survived the fall, looks on from the ground.

==Development and release==
&quot;Tekken 3&quot; is the first game to have been released on Namco System 12 hardware, after the original two &quot;Tekken&quot; games on System 11. The animation for the combatants was created using motion capture.

The sub-bosses of the previous two &quot;Tekken&quot; games were dropped in &quot;Tekken 3&quot;, since the developers felt it would make for a deeper and more well-rounded game if they focused on the move sets and playability of the core characters rather than on adding bosses.

The music for &quot;Tekken 3&quot; was composed by Nobuyoshi Sano and Keiichi Okabe. Sano, who served as the sound director, took a big beat approach to the music with a slower tempo than the music found in previous games, as this genre had not previously been utilized in games. Game director Katsuhiro Harada initially did not understand the big beat direction, but Sano was able to convince him that it would work well in the series. During development, a tester criticized the music and wanted the music to resemble Sega&#x27;s &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;; this angered Sano, although the report was dismissed. Okabe also became ill during the music&#x27;s production.

The game had a limited Japanese release on November 28, 1996. It was followed by a wide international release in March 1997, releasing in North America on March 18, 1997.

===PlayStation===
The conversion to the PlayStation took eight months, significantly longer than the conversions of &quot;Tekken&quot; and &quot;Tekken 2&quot;, due to &quot;Tekken 3&quot; being designed for Namco System 12, making it a much more difficult conversion than the previous two games, which were designed for the PlayStation-based Namco System 11. The conversion team was, aside from a few personnel changes, the same group which created both the PlayStation and arcade versions of &quot;Tekken&quot; and &quot;Tekken 2&quot;.

The original port of &quot;Tekken 3&quot; to the PlayStation features two new hidden characters: Gon and Dr. Boskonovitch. Boskonovitch was a late addition; in early 1998 Namco said that Gon would be in the PlayStation version but Boskonovitch&#x27;s inclusion was still not certain. Anna was made into her own separate character, and given her own character select spot, voice, unique attacks, and ending. The PlayStation version features new &quot;Tekken Force&quot; and &quot;Tekken Ball&quot; modes, as well as all modes present in &quot;Tekken 2&quot;. Due to the PlayStation&#x27;s hardware limitations of less video RAM and lower clock speed, the visual quality was downgraded. The backgrounds were re-made into 2D panoramic images, the number of polygons used for each character were slightly reduced, sound effects played at a high pitch, and the game runs at lower overall resolution. Namco representatives had in fact originally stated that they did not think it was possible to convert &quot;Tekken 3&quot; to the PlayStation. By April 1997, &quot;Tekken 3&quot; was popular in the arcades, and the process of its home conversion was considered certain on PlayStation but merely a controversial consideration on Nintendo 64.

Sano and Okabe returned to compose the music for the PlayStation version, with much of the soundtrack being arranged from the arcade&#x27;s music, along with the addition of several new tracks. Other composers who participated in composing additional music include Hiroyuki Kawada, Minamo Takahashi, Yuu Miyake, Yoshie Arakawa, and Hideki Tobeta. Arakawa had previously composed for the first two &quot;Tekken&quot; games, while Sano, Okabe and Miyake would go on to work on several future entries in the series, including &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot;.

The PlayStation 2 release of &quot;Tekken 5&quot; features the arcade version of &quot;Tekken 3&quot;. The PlayStation version of &quot;Tekken 3&quot; was one of the controversial selection of 20 games included by Sony Interactive Entertainment on the PlayStation Classic, released on December 3, 2018.

==Reception==
===Commercial===
The arcade game was a major hit. In Japan, the 15 April 1997 issue of &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Tekken 3&quot; as the most-successful arcade game of the month. It went on to be the highest-grossing arcade printed circuit board (PCB) game of 1997 in Japan, and second highest-grossing overall arcade video game below Sega&#x27;s rival &quot;Virtua Fighter 3&quot; (1996). &quot;Tekken 3&quot; sold 35,000 arcade units worldwide in 1997, including 15,000 in Japan and 20,000 overseas. While &quot;Virtua Fighter 3&quot; was more successful in Japan at the time, &quot;Tekken 3&quot; was more successful worldwide. &quot;Tekken 3&quot; later became the overall highest-grossing arcade game of 1998 in Japan, above &quot;Virtua Fighter 3 Team Battle&quot;.

The PlayStation version was also a major hit. In Japan, the game sold over copies on its first day of release. In May 1998, Sony awarded &quot;Tekken 3&quot; a &quot;Platinum Prize&quot; for sales above 1 million units in Japan. According to &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot;, Japan bought 1.13 million units of &quot;Tekken 3&quot; during the first half of 1998, which made it the country&#x27;s third-best-selling game for the period. PC Data, which tracked sales in the United States, reported that &quot;Tekken 3&quot; sold 1.11 million copies and earned in revenue during 1998 alone. This made it the third-best-selling PlayStation release of the year in the United States.

In Germany, it received a &quot;Gold&quot; award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) in November 1998 for sales above 100,000 units, with the VUD later raising it to &quot;Platinum&quot; status indicating over 200,000 sales by August 1999. At the 1999 Milia festival in Cannes, it took home a &quot;Gold&quot; prize for revenues above or in the European Union during 1998. &quot;Tekken 3&quot; grossed a further €57,209,778 or in Europe during 1999, adding up to over € or grossed in Europe by 1999, and more than across Europe and the United States by 1999.

According to &quot;Tekken&quot; series producer Katsuhiro Harada, &quot;Tekken 3&quot; sold 8.36 million copies during its initial release on the original PlayStation, including in Japan and overseas.

===Critical===
According to Metacritic, the game has a score of 96 out of 100, indicating universal acclaim, and is ranked number 2 on its list of greatest PlayStation games. As of April 2011, the game is listed as the twelfth-highest-rated game of all time on the review compiling site GameRankings with an average rating of 96%.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the arcade version, and stated that &quot;&quot;Tekken 3&quot; isn&#x27;t quite the artful masterpiece that [&quot;Virtua Fighter 3&quot;] is, but is still awesome in its own right, and has moved the series even further form its &#x27;me too&#x27; roots. The fighting system has evolved nicely, resulting in some wild and effective moves and new characters, a faster responsiveness, and an impressive 3D fighting experience.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; gave it a 4.5 out of 5 for graphics and sound and a 5.0 for control and funfactor. While noting that it was visually not up with its competitor &quot;Virtua Fighter 3&quot;, the reviewer said it was stunning in its own right and features phenomenally responsive and easy controls. The game was a runner-up for &quot;Arcade Game of the Year&quot; (behind &quot;NFL Blitz&quot;) at &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s 1997 Editors&#x27; Choice Awards.

&quot;Tekken 3&quot; became the first game in three years to receive a 10 from a reviewer from &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, with three of the four reviewers giving it the highest possible score. &quot;Tekken 3&quot; is the first game to have scored a 10 under &quot;EGM&quot;″s revised review scale in that a game no longer needed to be &quot;perfect&quot; to receive a 10, and the last game to receive a 10 from the magazine was &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;. The only holdout was the magazine&#x27;s enigmatic fighting-game review guru, Sushi-X, who said that &quot;no game that rewards newbies for button-mashing will ever be tops in my book&quot;, giving the game 9 out of 10. GameSpot&#x27;s Jeff Gerstmann gave the game a 9.9 out of 10, saying &quot;Not much stands between &quot;Tekken 3&quot; and a perfect 10 score. If the PlayStation exclusive characters were better and Force mode a bit more enthralling, it could have come closer to a perfect score.&quot; He also praised the sound effects, music, and graphics.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the PlayStation version, and stated that &quot;There is no better fighting game, on this system or any other. It&#x27;s clearly superior to the previous games in the series and a stunning value for &quot;Tekken&quot; aficionados.&quot;

According to &quot;&quot; in 2009, &quot;Tekken 3&quot; &quot;is still widely considered one of the finest fighting games of all time&quot;. In September 2004, for the tenth anniversary of the PlayStation brand, it ranked No. 10 on the magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;Final PlayStation Top 10&quot;. It was also No. 177 on &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s 2009 Top 200 games of all time.

In 2011, &quot;Complex&quot; ranked it as the fourth best fighting game of all time. &quot;Complex&quot; also ranked &quot;Tekken 3&quot; as the ninth best arcade video game of the 1990s, commenting that &quot;this now classic fighter served as a welcome palette cleanser to the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;/&quot;Street Fighter&quot; dichotomy that dominated arcades in the 90s.&quot; &quot;Complex&quot; also ranked &quot;Tekken 3&quot; as the eighth best PlayStation 1 video game, commenting, &quot;When &quot;Tekken 3&quot; finally moved from our local arcade and into our living room, we knew nothing would ever be the same. With an assortment of attacks and combos to learn, along with good controls, graphics, and sound, &quot;Tekken 3&quot; was much more polished and smooth than its predecessors.&quot;

&quot;Tekken 3&quot; has also been listed among the best video games of all time by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; in 1997, &quot;Game Informer&quot; in 1999, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; in 2000, GameFAQs in 2005, and &quot;Edge&quot; in 2007. ArcadeSushi ranked &quot;Tekken 3&quot; as the &quot;20th Best Playstation Game&quot;, with comments &quot;Tekken 3 changed everything. Friends became bitter rivals. Bitter rivals became even more bitter rivals. Tekken 3 was the game you played with friends you didn&#x27;t want to be your friends anymore.&quot; The same site also ranked it as the &quot;17th best fighting game&quot;, commenting, &quot;&quot;Tekken 3&quot; was easily one of the best &quot;Tekken&quot; games ever created. Before the series became obsessed with wall splats and ground bounds, it simply had huge open 3D arenas with massive casts that may or may not have included boxing raptors.&quot; In 2015, GamesRadar ranked &quot;Tekken 3&quot; as the 59th &quot;best game ever&quot;, as &quot;it possesses one of the finest fighting systems ever, the series&#x27; well-known juggle formula percolated into a perfect storm of throws, strikes, and suplexes.&quot;

<doc id="739182" wikidata="Q1142527" url="?curid=739182" title="Tekken Tag Tournament">
<text>is a 1999 fighting game developed and published by Namco for arcades. It is a spin-off the &quot;Tekken&quot; series. Not canon to the main storyline, &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot; features nearly all the characters in the previous &quot;Tekken&quot; games and introduces a two-on-two &#x27;tag team&#x27; battle mechanic. It was released as an arcade game, before becoming a North American and European launch title for the PlayStation 2 in 2000. The arcade version ran on the same Namco System 12 board with a 32-bit engine as &quot;Tekken 3&quot;, while the ported home console version received upgraded graphics.

A follow-up, &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament 2&quot;, was released in 2011. A remastered version of the game titled &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament HD&quot; was released for the PlayStation 3 in November 2011, as part of &quot;Tekken Hybrid&quot;.

==Gameplay==
Continuing the fighting mechanics from &quot;Tekken 2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;, &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot; sees players battling in teams of two characters. At any point in the match, the player can hit a tag button to swap out with their other fighter, allowing the resting fighter to recover some lost health. The tag can be implemented in many ways, such as in between combos or utilizing special throws. At times when a resting fighter&#x27;s life bar is flashing, that character can be tagged in to be given a temporary boost in strength. Unlike other tag games such as Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Vs.&quot; series, players are defeated when only one of their fighters loses all of their health, requiring players to be strategic about tagging their fighters. In the event of a timeout, the team with the most accumulative health remaining wins the round.

The game features over 35 characters that previously appeared in &quot;Tekken 2&quot; and &quot;Tekken 3&quot;. In addition, there is a boss character, Unknown, who is similar to &quot;Tekken 3&quot;″s Mokujin in that she can randomly imitate any character&#x27;s fighting style at any time during the fight. The PlayStation 2 version added enhanced graphics and various modes, including 1-on-1 mode, in which players only choose one fighter each, and Team Battle, where players choose up to eight battles and play with the tag rules, with each new character replacing the one that was defeated (the remaining fighter must fight on his/her own). Also featured is the &quot;Tekken Bowl&quot; mode, a bowling minigame where each character has different attributes.

The arcade and console versions of &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot; differ slightly. The arcade version ran on a 32-bit engine, utilizing the graphics engine of &quot;Tekken 3&quot;. These graphics ran using the &quot;Tekken 3&quot; PCB board, based on the PlayStation hardware. The console version ran on a highly updated engine, utilizing the PlayStation 2&#x27;s graphics processor. The game does not run on a 32-bit engine, instead running on a new and updated engine highly similar to that found on &quot;Tekken 4&quot;. The background designs and BGMs differed too, as the console version has new updated tracks, while the arcade version was based on MIDI tracks with an instrumental backing. Unknown is not playable in the arcade version, but she is in the PlayStation 2 version. The arcade version also allows players to only select the alternative colors that have been added to the costumes at first, while the normally colored ones are unlocked when the bonus characters are. There are also crucial differences concerning the playability of the characters, as some moves or attacks are much more efficient in the arcade version than in the console version and vice versa.

==Characters==
As the game was made to be a compilation of previous games, it includes nearly every character from the original PlayStation trilogy games (from the original &quot;Tekken&quot; up to &quot;Tekken 3&quot;), including those who were absent from &quot;Tekken 3&quot;. All of them have improved appearance and movesets to make them on par with the &quot;Tekken 3&quot; characters. Jack-2, who was a costume swap for Gun Jack in &quot;Tekken 3&quot;, is now a separate character from his successor.

Additionally, the game adds two new characters, both of them being mimic characters: Tetsujin and Unknown. Unknown also serves as the final boss of the game. Both characters seldom appeared in future games, with Unknown resuming her role as the final boss in the sequel &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament 2&quot;, while Tetsujin was featured as a boss in the free-to-play &quot;Tekken Revolution&quot; and the mobile game &quot;Tekken&quot;.

The only characters absent from the game that were playable in previous entries of the series are the original Jack, the first King, the first Kuma, Marshall Law, Dr. Bosconovitch, and Gon (who was a guest character in &quot;Tekken 3&quot; and who did not appear in any subsequent games because Namco&#x27;s contract only allowed them to use Gon in Tekken 3).

All characters are available from the start in the PS3 remaster.

===New characters===
*Tetsujin : A metallic version of Mokujin.
*Unknown : A mysterious woman controlled by the &quot;Forest Demon&quot; who resembles a wolf. She looks like a corrupt version of Jun Kazama.

===Returning characters===

==Development==
The PlayStation 2 version had reworked upgraded graphics over the arcade original, and it was first demoed at the Tokyo Games Show alongside Namco&#x27;s &quot;Ridge Racer V&quot;. &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot; was released just weeks after the PS2&#x27;s Japanese debut, but was otherwise a launch title in North America and Europe later in 2000.

===Remaster===

&quot;Tekken Tag Tournament HD&quot; is a remastered version of &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot;, released in November 2011 for the PlayStation 3. The game comes on the same Blu-ray Disc as the 3D movie &quot;&quot; and is accessible if the disc is loaded on a PlayStation 3 (the entire package is referred to as &quot;Tekken Hybrid&quot; which also includes &quot;Tekken: Blood Vengeance&quot; and a demo version of &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament 2&quot;). It is based on the PlayStation 2 version and features updated HD visuals and Trophy support. A limited edition version of &quot;Tekken Hybrid&quot; was released alongside the standard version, which included an art book, selected soundtracks of both &quot;Tag Tournament&quot; and &quot;Tag Tournament 2&quot;, and PlayStation Home content.

==Reception==
The PlayStation 2 version received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; described the Japanese import as &quot;delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses&quot; but added, &quot;Guess we&#x27;ll all have to wait for &quot;Tekken 4&quot; to find that out.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; praised the game&#x27;s graphics and character moves. In the &quot;Features&quot; section for PlayStation 2, Prince Paul of &quot;GamePro&quot; praised it for its visuals &quot;where you could see individual blades of grass!&quot; Later, Four-Eyed Dragon said of the game in its review, &quot;Namco has always been strong in the fighting genre, and &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot; is no exception. While the game may be old in the arcades, it certainly looks and feels new for the home console, effectively utilizing the power of the PS2 with outstanding graphics, sound, and controls. This is a perfect addition to the PS2&#x27;s burgeoning library.&quot; Frank O&#x27;Connor of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the Japanese import in its June 2000 issue, &quot;The only thing preventing &quot;Tekken Tag&quot; from receiving a perfect score is its lack of innovation – it&#x27;s basically a prettier &quot;Tekken 3&quot;. However, that still makes it the best &quot;Tekken&quot; yet.&quot; Six issues later, he called the U.S. version &quot;A densely packed, gloriously rendered, and very playable fighting game. Almost but not quite a killer app.&quot; In Japan, however, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 38 out of 40.

In contrast, the remaster received a mixed critical reception, earning a Metacritic score of 65/100, based on reviews from 51 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. While the remaster was praised, many critics considered the lack of online play to be a missed opportunity, with the film and demo of the sequel receiving further criticism.

===Sales and awards===
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed the arcade version in their August 15, 1999 issue as the second most successful arcade game of the month. It went on to become the highest-grossing arcade game of 2000 there. By 2000, it had sold 19,000 arcade units worldwide, including 9,000 in Japan and 10,000 overseas.

The PlayStation 2 version sold more than 400,000 units in its first four days of release. The game was added to the list of Sony Greatest Hits games on March 1, 2002. By July 2006, &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot; had sold 1.4 million units and earned $48 million in the U.S. &quot;NextGen&quot; ranked it as the 35th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined sales of &quot;Tekken&quot; games released in the 2000s reached 3 million units in the U.S. by July 2006. It received a &quot;Platinum&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 units in the UK. The game sold 457,340 units in Japan, 1.61 million units in the US, and 300,000+ units in the UK, for a total of more than 2.367 million units sold worldwide.

During the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the PlayStation 2 version was nominated for the &quot;Game of the Year, &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Console Fighting&quot; and &quot;Animation&quot; awards, which ultimately went to &quot;Diablo II&quot;, &quot;SSX&quot;, &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;, respectively. It was nominated for the &quot;Best PlayStation 2 Game&quot; and &quot;Best Fighting Game&quot; awards at &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Best and Worst of 2000 Awards, both of which went to &quot;SSX&quot; and &quot;Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000&quot;, respectively. In 2007, &quot;IGN&quot; listed the same console version as the 23rd best game on the PlayStation 2. In 2008, &quot;&quot; stated, &quot;&quot;Tekken Tag&quot; is regarded as the best installment in the series&quot;.

==Sequel==
&quot;Tekken Tag Tournament 2&quot;, was announced at the Tokyo Game Show 2010 on September 18, 2010. The game expanded on the original&#x27;s tag mechanics, allowing for more flowing tag combos and combined moves, inherited some gameplay mechanics from &quot;Tekken 6&quot;, and featured characters from more recent &quot;Tekken&quot; games. It was released as an arcade cabinet in Japan on September 14, 2011, with an &quot;unlimited&quot; revision following on March 27, 2012. PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were released in all territories in the week of September 11, 2012, and a Wii U port followed in November 2012.

<doc id="739183" wikidata="Q2333614" url="?curid=739183" title="Tekken Advance">
<text>is a fighting game released for the Game Boy Advance. It uses sprites based on &quot;Tekken 3&quot; 3D models for its characters but the overall menus, fonts and art-style are all modeled after &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot;. It was the first Tekken game to be released on a Nintendo platform.

==Synopsis==
It is non-canonical to the &quot;Tekken&quot; storyline, but follows the events of &quot;Tekken 3&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay in &quot;Tekken Advance&quot; is similar to other games in the series, but because it is on a portable system, the inputs were simplified or removed altogether. It utilizes a single-input system, with kick mapped to the A button, punch to the B button, and the left and right triggers used for tagging and throws, respectively. The game also included a side-step feature.

Despite the simplification, &quot;Tekken Advance&quot; introduces new mechanics by implementing a wide range of &quot;stun&quot; variations such as &quot;pop stuns&quot;, &quot;crumple stuns&quot; and right/left stuns.

==Characters==
The game features most of the starter characters from &quot;Tekken 3&quot;, with the exceptions of Eddy Gordo and Lei Wulong. Gun Jack, who was unlockable in &quot;Tekken 3&quot;, is playable from the start, with Heihachi Mishima being the sole unlockable character and final boss in lieu of Ogre.

*Ling Xiaoyu
*Yoshimitsu
*Nina Williams
*Forest Law
*GUN JACK
*Hwoarang
*Heihachi Mishima (unlockable)
*Paul Phoenix
*King
*Jin Kazama

==Reception==
&quot;Tekken Advance&quot; has generally received positive reviews. It received an 8.5 out of 10 from &quot;IGN&quot;, and an 8 out of 10 from &quot;GameSpot&quot; saying &quot;It looks and feels close enough to its counterpart to succeed.&quot; GameSpy gave it a much more favourable score with 88 out of 100, calling it an impressive game for the Game Boy Advance. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave it a mediocre score with 5.83 out of 10. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; gave the game a 3.5 out of 5.

&quot;Tekken Advance&quot; was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Graphics on Game Boy Advance&quot; award, which went to &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island: Super Mario Advance 3&quot;.

<doc id="739184" wikidata="Q1052488" url="?curid=739184" title="Tekken 5">
<text>is a 2004 fighting game developed and published by Namco for arcades, before being ported to the PlayStation 2 in 2005. It is the fifth main game in the &quot;Tekken&quot; series, marking the tenth anniversary of the series. The game is set shortly after the events of &quot;Tekken 4&quot; featuring a new Antagonist named Jinpachi Mishima taking over the &quot;Mishima Zaibatsu&quot; while a sidestory focuses on the protagonist Jin Kazama as he faces several enemies from the G Corporation. The home version also contains a collector&#x27;s edition of sorts, as it includes the arcade versions of &quot;Tekken&quot;, &quot;Tekken 2&quot;, &quot;Tekken 3&quot;, and &quot;StarBlade&quot;.

The game reverts several major gameplay changes introduced in &quot;Tekken 4&quot;, such as uneven stage terrain, in favor of a more fluid gameplay akin to the older games in the series. It is also the first game in the series to feature the ability to customize characters with accessories, clothing, and other aesthetic items purchased with in-game currency. There are 32 fighters to choose from, including five new fighters as well as Jin&#x27;s alter-ego Devil Jin.

The game was upgraded to &quot;Tekken 5.1&quot;, which had mostly balance changes to the gameplay, and later received the update &quot;Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection&quot; which was released in 2005 and later ported to the PlayStation Portable (as &quot;Tekken: Dark Resurrection&quot;) and the PlayStation 3. &quot;Tekken 5&quot; was a critical and commercial success, selling over 8.2 million copies including expansion. Critics praised the return of classic gameplay features and the large amount of replay value provided by the PlayStation 2 port though the final boss was criticized for being too powerful, while Jin&#x27;s story mode was perceived as &quot;boring&quot; in comparison to the fighting game part. The sequel entitled &quot;Tekken 6&quot; was released in 2007.

==Gameplay==
New to the features is the &quot;hot system&quot; which affects the vulnerability of character while they attack. For example, a move with jumping properties, such as a hop-kick, will be completely invulnerable during most of its animation time to all of an opponent&#x27;s low attacks. It also retains its wall juggling concept from &quot;Tekken 4&quot;, but the element is effectively more difficult to abuse and easier to defend against. &quot;Tekken 5&quot; also allows players to customize their fighter for the first time, allowing them to change the colors of their outfits, buy additional costumes, and equip them with items by using money gained from playing the Story, Survival, Time Attack, the side-story &quot;Devil Within&quot;, and Arcade Battle modes.

The raised and lowered sections of floors featured in the &quot;Tekken 4&quot; levels were removed for the fifth installment. This change made gameplay throughout each stage generally similar, aside from wall placements. In addition to removing the uneven nature of the &quot;Tekken 4&quot; styled stages, the design team returned to the style of stages from previous games by having some stages without barriers by allowing them to be infinitely scrolling. For walled stages, the fights take place in fairly symmetrical boxes without any uneven walls. Floors could also crack after one of the characters hit it hard enough. Only one part of a stage can be cracked at a time, however.

Other changes over the &quot;Tekken 4&quot; design included the removal of the positional change techniques, bringing back traditional air combat and using a juggle system more akin to &quot;Tekken 3&quot; as opposed to the 4th game&#x27;s less juggle-friendly gameplay. 

===Devil Within===
The home version also includes Devil Within mode. This is the third installment and gameplay variant in the &quot;Tekken Force&quot; series (the first two instalments can be found in &quot;Tekken 3&quot; and &quot;Tekken 4&quot; respectively). Similar to &quot;Death by Degrees&quot;, &#x27;Devil Within&#x27; focuses solely on one playable character, Jin Kazama, who can also transform into Devil Jin. This is a 3D beat &#x27;em up game with platforming elements, in which players must control Jin through a series of labyrinthine levels and battle enemy armies. This mode features bosses, such as True Ogre from &quot;Tekken 3&quot;, who is not playable in &quot;Tekken 5&quot;.

==Plot==
Set moments after &quot;Tekken 4&quot;″s ending, Jin Kazama&#x27;s departure from the Hon-Maru dojo, G Corporation helicopters approach and begin deploying Jack-4 machines pods into the building. Heihachi Mishima and his son, Kazuya, battle the Jacks together until Kazuya leaves Heihachi for dead while escaping. The Jacks hold down Heihachi while one activates its detonator, creating a huge explosion that seemingly kills Heihachi. The only witness to the event is Raven, a mysterious ninja clad in black, who relays Heihachi&#x27;s death to his superiors. Heihachi&#x27;s death is declared all over the world with everyone foreseeing the end of the Mishima Zaibatsu. However, somebody else takes over the company from the shadows and business continues.

Two months later, the King of Iron Fist Tournament 5 is announced. During the tournament, Kazuya crosses paths with Raven, who recognizes him after seeing him flying away from the Hon-Maru. Kazuya defeats Raven and interrogates him. When he makes Raven talk, Kazuya discovers that he was betrayed by G Corporation, and that something was awakened from under Hon-Maru. Kazuya realizes what Heihachi has done, and speculates that, in fact, it is his grandfather Jinpachi Mishima, Heihachi&#x27;s father who was confined below Hon-Maru by Heihachi after a coup forty years ago. However, he was possessed by a vengeful spirit who granted him insurmountable power, after which he broke out of Hon-Maru during the Jacks&#x27; attacks. Ultimately, as revealed in the next game, after Jin utterly defeats Wang Jinrei in the later stages of the tournament, Hwoarang faced Jin and defeated him in the semi-finals. While Jin was lying on the ground, suddenly, he roars paranormally and produces a gale that blows Hwoarang away. From Jin&#x27;s back, two black wings spread, and Jin stands up in his devil form. Hwoarang is at his wits end. He is not able to fight back, and soon he is knocked unconscious. Presumably because Hwoarang could not continue, Jin was allowed to continue in his place, and progress through the tournament. Jin manages to defeat his great grandfather Jinpachi in the final stage, who dissolves into dust and disappears shortly after, with his wish being fulfilled. With this victory, Jin becomes the new head of the Mishima Zaibatsu, setting in motion the events of &quot;Tekken 6&quot;.

==Characters==
The game features a total of 32 playable characters, consisting of 26 returning and 6 new ones. Unlike previous games, the home version adds no new playable character, and the game&#x27;s unplayable final boss from the arcades, Jinpachi Mishima, remains unplayable in the console version. The home version also has two uncontrollable enemies fought during the Devil Within minigame: Gun Jack and True Ogre.

===New characters===
The new characters include:
*Asuka Kazama: A high school student from Osaka which practice Kazama Style Traditional Martial Arts and enters in the tournament to take revenge against Feng Wei for having injured her father and destroyed her family&#x27;s dojo.
*Devil Jin : The Devil form of Jin who uses Jin&#x27;s old move set composed of his paternal family&#x27;s martial arts.

After the release of &quot;Tekken 4&quot;, series director Katsuhiro Harada left Namco due to pressure with game&#x27;s decline in sales. Harada&#x27;s boss insisted him to keep producing more titles as he was capable of pleasing people with his work. After a year away, Harada went back to the company explaining it was due to his passion with fighting games. Namco first announced &quot;Tekken 5&quot; in E3 2004 during May. Harada aimed to make it the best game in the entire franchise to celebrate its 10th anniversary. He aimed to amplify the action elements of the games and make them more over-the-top. In regards to the handling of the game following the sales of &quot;Tekken 4&quot;, Harada claims Namco used this response to develop the game. Namco also aimed to make the game fitting for newcomers. The early success of the arcade led the team to research for more content to add in future installments. Based on the company&#x27;s revolutionary Dynamic Motion Synthesis technology, endorphin was chosen to implement an AI and dynamics simulation to create 3D character animation in real-time, thus dramatically accelerating 3D animation pipelines in games and visual effect studios. Shinichiro Yoda of Namco was optimisitic with this decision. Torsten Reil, CEO of NaturalMotion, said that they were delighted by Namco as they had already put it in test for its first trailer. The arcade cabinet of the game was notable for allowing players to use their PlayStation 2 controls over the regular arcade system. The team felt that for the first time in years, the franchise made a notable progress thanks to &quot;Tekken 5&quot;.

The game was developed to be different from its predecessor. This was mostly due to the feedback &quot;Tekken 4&quot; received to the point of being considered by some as one of the worst installments in the series. In contrast to &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot;, &quot;5&quot; runs on a System 256, a stronger arcade, allowing the team to produce more detailed backgrounds and characters. This was done thanks to the new engine provided by Namco. Early in development, Namco promised gamers there would be a minigame on action adventure style mode similar to the one provided by &quot;Tekken 3&quot;.

Harada wanted the game to be enjoyable to newcomers as a result of multiple playable characters that might be difficult to master. A blur effect was added to the visuals while several stages were given flames. Early in the production, &quot;Tekken 5&quot; was meant to have 20 playable characters, with the selected returning ones being the most popular ones. New movements were added to the returning cast. 600 items were also made for the idea of customization. Among the newcomers, Asuka Kazama stands as a replacement from the missing Jun Kazama who only appeared in &quot;Tekken 2&quot; and &quot;Tag Tournament&quot;. Despite promotion from &quot;Tekken 5&quot; claiming that the character has died in the intro, Namco Bandai denied this statement in interviews. &quot;Tekken 5&quot; also makes most characters use their own native language during cutscenes, introductions to battles and victory scenes. Producer Takai Homma was in charge of this part of the game. Homma recalls having fun in giving the characters their respective lines as well subtitles. This also led to animal characters having their own lines which have to be read. The goal of Homma was surpassing the two previous &quot;Tekken&quot; games.

The CGI studio Digital Frontier, who had previously worked with Namco on earlier games, assisted with the creation of CGI cutscenes in the game.

===Music===
The game features a large cast of music composers, including Akitaka Tohyama, Yoshihito Yano, Yuu Miyake, Junichi Nakatsuru, Satoru Kōsaki, Rio Hamamoto, Ryuichi Takada, and Hiroshi Okubo. The same team also worked on the PS2 version, with the addition of Tetsukazu Nakanishi, Keiichi Okabe, Kohta Takahashi, Kazuhiro Nakamura, Keiki Kobayashi, Nobuyoshi Sano, and Katsuro Tajima. The opening song for the PS2 version, &quot;Sparking&quot;, features vocals by Tom Leonard and Jeff Pescetto. The music encompasses many genres, including techno, rock and nu metal. Victor Entertainment released the soundtrack.

===Ports===
The PlayStation 2 port was made in order to contain everything from the original arcade alongside new content. This originated from fan response who often requested Namco that. Harada gave Kei Kudo the task of compressing the port version of the game properly. In October 2005, the game was re-released under the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; label in Japan. The game was re-released as &quot;Tekken 5.1&quot;, a free upgrade to the arcade version of &quot;Tekken 5&quot;. It includes changes to the character life bars and character select screen, and some changes in character moves to improve game balance. For example, Steve Fox&#x27;s infinite was removed, and a few other strong moves were toned down. The Devil Within was created as something only the port could carry.

Available in the version for the arcades, the PSP and the PlayStation 3 (via the PlayStation Network), &quot;Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection&quot; is an update of &quot;Tekken 5&quot;. It was officially announced at the 2005 JAMMA AM Show but news of it leaked slightly beforehand. The update &quot;Dark Resurrection&quot; would further add additional characters, more features, and customizations in addition to gameplay rebalancing. It was directed by Haruki Suzaki who aimed to turn Jinpachi into a playable character. The Japanese version took about two and a half months. The PlayStation 3 port proved difficult to port as a result of its different engine.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

&quot;Tekken 5&quot; was met with mainly positive critical response, resulting in a score of 88 out of 100 at Metacritic. Several writers found its mechanics superior to its predecessor, &quot;Tekken 4&quot;, due to the return of classic mechanics and the importance of each stage as well as faster combat. The fact that &quot;Tekken 5&quot; removed the exclusive features from its prequel was also a subject of praise. The new mechanics to customize the characters were praised and compared with the ones from &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot;. The new characters were also the subject of positive response due to the variety they provide. Additionally, the PlayStation 2 port was heavily praised for the inclusion of the first three &quot;Tekken&quot; to play, which expanded the replay value.

Negative comments focused on the &#x27;Devil Within&#x27; mini game due to poorly executed mechanics, despite giving the player the possibility of using Devil Jin for the first time, with &quot;GameAxis Unwired&quot; calling it derivative of the Tekken Force mini-game from Tekken 3 while GameRevolution compared it to the poorly received spin-off &quot;Death By Degrees&quot;. The final boss Jinpachi Mishima has often been criticized for how overpowered he can be to the point of often being rated as one of the worst bosses in gaming.

The presentation was the subject of positive response. The visuals were praised both for the improvement to the fights as well as the new CGI endings over real time cutscenes coupled with interludes and narration in the story mode, as well as improvements to bodies&#x27; textures to the point GameZone and GameSpot found it as a more faithful sequel to &quot;Tekken 3&quot; than &quot;4&quot;. The idea of having the characters speaking their native languages over English was well received. &quot;VideoGamer.com&quot; enjoyed the large amount of content player can unlock in the gallery mode too.

&quot;Tekken 5&quot; was also awarded &quot;Best Fighting Game of 2005&quot; by GameSpot, and &quot;Best PlayStation 2 Fighting Game&quot; by IGN. During the 9th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Tekken 5&quot; received a nomination for &quot;Fighting Game of the Year&quot;, which was ultimately awarded to fellow Namco fighting game &quot;Soulcalibur III&quot;.

===Legacy===
&quot;Tekken 5&quot; was ranked by &quot;Complex&quot; as the sixth best PlayStation 2 game. SNK staff member Falcoon said &quot;Tekken 5&quot; was one of his favorite games in 2005 although he did not consider himself an expert in the game. Game designer Tomonobu Itagaki heavily panned the console port of the game for lacking innovative features after several installments from the franchise. Similarly, &quot;The Rough Guide to Videogames&quot; felt the story was convoluted and that the Devil Within was poorly done. &quot;PC Mag&quot; listed Paul Phoenix&#x27;s and Lee Chaolan&#x27;s endings as two of the &quot;craziest&quot; moments in the franchise.

Producer Harada acknowledged that the game was still riddled with problems, such as characters that were too strong (for example, Steve Fox), and a gameplay that was broken in terms of fairness. This led to the patched update &quot;Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection&quot;. The fighters were also forced to remain stationary prior to the round beginning.

The game&#x27;s critical praise was matched with commercial success. As of July 2009, it has sold around 6 million copies. In retrospective, Harada believes &quot;Tekken 5&quot;, and &quot;Tekken 6&quot;, managed to attract a new large group of fans, something &quot;Tekken 4&quot; did not do relatively as much despite its positive reviews. However, Harada was not without criticism, and stated that Tekken 5 did revert the innovation in Tekken 4 by returning to classic conservative gameplay to please the older fans, which in hindsight he should not have resorted to in excess of the innovation that could have been. A sequel, &quot;Tekken 6&quot;, was released in 2007. The first CGI scene from the game also influenced the developers to create a film titled &quot;&quot; (2011) which uses this type of animation.

<doc id="739185" wikidata="Q2088074" url="?curid=739185" title="Ryuhei Kitamura">
<text>is a Japanese film director, producer, and screenwriter. Kitamura relocated to Sydney, Australia at age 17 and attended a school for visual arts for two years. In 1997, Kitamura directed and produced the short film &quot;Down to Hell&quot;, which received a positive response from students, teachers, and an award which motivated Kitamura to seriously pursue a film career. He went on to independently finance and direct his feature film debut &quot;Versus&quot; (2000). The film proved to be successful within the film festival circuit and opened doors for Kitamura to direct more high-profile films such as &quot;Alive&quot; (2002), &quot;Sky High&quot; (2003), &quot;&quot; (2004), &quot;The Midnight Meat Train&quot; (2008), &quot;No One Lives&quot; (2012), the live-action adaptation of &quot;Lupin the 3rd&quot; (2014), and several other Japanese and Hollywood productions.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ryuhei Kitamura was born in Osaka Prefecture, Japan. Kitamura spent more of his adolescent years at the cinema than school. At the age of 16, he chose to become a filmmaker since he figured he &quot;loved watching movies.&quot; The following year, Kitamura dropped out of high school, directly telling his teacher and walking out during class, and moved to Australia a week later. Kitamura chose Australia because most of his influences are Australian, such as George Miller, Russel Mulcahy, Peter Weir, and INXS. Kitamura attended a school for visual arts in Sydney for two years, after he directly asked the principal to simply let him in, &quot;he thought that I was a funny guy, so he let me in.&quot;

===Career===
After graduating, he returned to Japan to establish Napalm Films, his independent production studio. His featurettes &quot;Down to Hell&quot; and &quot;Heat after Dark&quot; were successful in film festivals, and he soon found his first mainstream success with the cult film &quot;Versus&quot;. The film launched the career of stars Tak Sakaguchi and Hideo Sakaki, and brought Kitamura international recognition when it was released on DVD outside Japan in 2004.

In 2002, Kitamura directed the short film &quot;The Messenger: Requiem for the Dead&quot; as part of the &quot;Jam Films&quot; project, as well as &quot;Alive&quot;. In 2003, he directed a feature film adaptation of the manga &quot;Azumi&quot;, and &quot;Sky High&quot;, a prequel to the popular Japanese television drama. He collaborated with director Yukihiko Tsutsumi in the Duel Project, in which the two challenged one another to produce the best dueling movie with minimal production time and budget, with &quot;Aragami&quot; being Kitamura&#x27;s contribution. Also in 2003, Kitamura served as producer for the film &quot;Battlefield Baseball&quot;, the directorial debut of &quot;Versus&quot; co-writer Yūdai Yamaguchi. Kitamura directed 2004&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, the 28th installment in the renowned kaiju franchise. The film was the first of Kitamura&#x27;s projects to hold its premiere in Hollywood. In 2006, Kitmura directed &quot;LoveDeath&quot;, before relocating to Los Angeles, California.

In 2003, he directed the in-game cutscenes for &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes&quot;, a remake of the iconic Metal Gear Solid for the GameCube. Unlike previous titles in the series, &quot;The Twin Snakes&quot; was developed by Silicon Knights and produced by Konami. The game featured similar mechanics to &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; due to having been made on the same engine. Kitamura&#x27;s direction of the cutscenes was viewed as controversial, criticism leveled at its &quot;Matrix&quot;-like action tone and unrealistic stunts performed by the characters. Regardless, it went on to receive positive reviews from video game review sites.

In 2008, Kitamura made his American filmmaking debut with &quot;Midnight Meat Train&quot; based on Clive Barker&#x27;s short horror story of the same name. The film (starring Bradley Cooper, Vinnie Jones, and Brooke Shields) was distributed by Lionsgate, and released directly to the secondary market on August 1, 2008. Despite receiving positive reviews from critics, the film was a box office failure. Kitamura&#x27;s next directorial venture did not come until 2012 with &quot;No One Lives&quot;, starring Luke Evans and Adelaide Clemens. It was shown as part of the Midnight Madness portion of the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, and received a limited theatrical release on May 10, 2013.

While promoting &quot;No One Lives&quot;, Kitamura announced that he was working on his &quot;comeback&quot; film in Japan, stating in an interview, &quot;It’s a completely different role than what I’ve done before. It’s also not a bloody movie, not a horror movie. It’s a big action movie.&quot; In November, 2013, the project was revealed to be &quot;Lupin III&quot;, a modern adaptation of the iconic manga by Monkey Punch. The film was released in Japan on August 30, 2014.

Kitamura&#x27;s 2017 thriller film, &quot;Downrange&quot;, was announced to premiere at Toronto International Film Festival in September 2017. The film follows a group of people on a road trip who are trapped on a country road by a sniper. In 2018, Kitamura directed a segment in the anthology horror film &quot;Nightmare Cinema&quot;.

===Future projects===
Kitamura is set to direct the slasher film &quot;Black Friday 3D&quot;, based on a screenplay by Joe Knetter. He is also attached to direct &quot;Marble City&quot;, a revenge film written by Tom Sjolund, as well as &quot;Gun Monkeys&quot;, from a screenplay by Lee Goldberg based on the novel by Victor Gischler. In May 2013, Kitamura confirmed that he has written the script for &quot;Versus 2&quot;, and that Tak Sakaguchi would likely reprise his role from the original film. In September 2015, it was announced that Kitamura will direct the supernatural thriller &quot;Vessels&quot; for Ubiquity Studios, set to be filmed in early 2016.

==Personal life==
Kitamura speaks English fluently. His favorite &quot;Godzilla&quot; film is &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla&quot; (1974), and his favourite kaiju is King Caesar. He has expressed admiration for fellow Japanese director Shunji Iwai, asserting that the film &quot;Swallowtail Butterfly&quot; is &quot;the best Japanese movie ever made.&quot; He has stated that his &quot;dream project&quot; would be to direct an installment in the &quot;Mad Max&quot; film franchise.

<text>Zelaya is a former department in Nicaragua. The department was located along the Mosquito Coast bordering the Caribbean Sea and was named after former President of Nicaragua José Santos Zelaya, who conquered the region for Nicaragua from the Mosquito Coast, then a British protectorate and indigenous monarchy, in 1894. The capital was Bluefields.

In 1987 it was divided into two autonomous regions:

* North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region (NCCAR)
* South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region (SCCAR)

<text>KWPX-TV (channel 33) is a television station licensed to Bellevue, Washington, United States, serving as the Ion Television outlet for the Seattle–Tacoma area. The station is owned and operated by the Ion Media subsidiary of the E. W. Scripps Company. KWPX-TV&#x27;s offices are located on 304th Avenue Southeast in Preston, and its transmitter is located on West Tiger Mountain near Issaquah.

==History==
The station signed on the air as KBGE on May 17, 1989. Its original transmitter site was atop Columbia Center; the transmitter was later moved to West Tiger Mountain. The call letters became KWPX-TV on March 9, 1998, after the station was purchased by Paxson Communications, replacing ValueVision with its inTV network until the launch of Pax on August 31, 1998. The station was never a part of the early-2000s initiative by NBC to rebroadcast local newscasts a half-hour later on a Pax station, as KING-TV already featured newscasts on sister station KONG-TV.

Until 2021, the station carried Telemundo on its seventh subchannel, before Scripps&#x27; purchase of Ion Media nullified the agreement, in order to carry their own subchannel networks. Cox-owned KIRO-TV relaunched the network in the market in the fall of 2022 over subchannel 7.4.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KWPX-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 33, on February 17, 2009, to conclude the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 32 to channel 33.

<text>The North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region is one of two autonomous regions in Nicaragua. It was created along with the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region by the Autonomy Statute of 7 September 1987 through a division of the former Zelaya Department. It covers an area of 33,106 km2 and has a population of 541,189 (2021 estimate). It is the largest autonomous region or department in Nicaragua. The capital is Puerto Cabezas. It contains part of the region known as the Mosquito Coast.

The North Autonomous Caribbean Coast has a Regional Council of representatives of different political parties, such as the Sandinistas (FSLN) and YATAMA (ethnic indigenous party), as well as all the municipalities. They hold sessions in an Assembly in Puerto Cabezas.

The North Autonomous Caribbean Coast, in addition to Mestizos, contains populations from different indigenous groups, including the Miskitos, Mayangnas, and others. The regional official languages are Creole (Miskito Coast Creole and Rama Cay Creole), Miskito, Sumo &quot;(Mayangna and Ulwa)&quot;, Garifuna, and Rama, in addition to the national official language of Spanish, most males in Puerto Cabezas speak some English from when it was a US fruit plantation.

<text>}&lt;/math&gt;
|caption=An infinite continued fraction is defined by the sequences formula_1, for formula_2, with formula_3.

A continued fraction is a mathematical expression that can be written as a fraction with a denominator that is a sum that contains another simple or continued fraction. Depending on whether this iteration terminates with a simple fraction or not, the continued fraction is finite or infinite.

Different fields of mathematics have different terminology and notation for continued fraction. In number theory the standard unqualified use of the term continued fraction refers to the special case where all numerators are 1, and is treated in the article Simple continued fraction. The present article treats the case where numerators and denominators are sequences formula_1 of constants or functions. 
From the perspective of number theory, these are called generalized continued fraction. From the perspective of complex analysis or numerical analysis, however, they are just standard, and in the present article they will simply be called &quot;continued fraction&quot;.

==Formulation==
A continued fraction is an expression of the form

:formula_5

where the () are the partial numerators, the are the partial denominators, and the leading term is called the &quot;integer part&quot; of the continued fraction.

The successive convergents of the continued fraction are formed by applying the fundamental recurrence formulas:
:formula_6
where is the numerator and is the denominator, called &quot;continuants&quot;, of the th convergent. They are given by the three-term recurrence relation 
:formula_7
with initial values
:formula_8

If the sequence of convergents approaches a limit, the continued fraction is convergent and has a definite value. If the sequence of convergents never approaches a limit, the continued fraction is divergent. It may diverge by oscillation (for example, the odd and even convergents may approach two different limits), or it may produce an infinite number of zero denominators .

== History ==

The story of continued fractions begins with the Euclidean algorithm, a procedure for finding the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers and . That algorithm introduced the idea of dividing to extract a new remainder – and then dividing by the new remainder repeatedly.

Nearly two thousand years passed before devised a technique for approximating the roots of quadratic equations with continued fractions in the mid-sixteenth century. Now the pace of development quickened. Just 24 years later, in 1613, Pietro Cataldi introduced the first formal notation for the generalized continued fraction. Cataldi represented a continued fraction as

:formula_9

with the dots indicating where the next fraction goes, and each representing a modern plus sign.

Late in the seventeenth century John Wallis introduced the term &quot;continued fraction&quot; into mathematical literature. New techniques for mathematical analysis (Newton&#x27;s and Leibniz&#x27;s calculus) had recently come onto the scene, and a generation of Wallis&#x27; contemporaries put the new phrase to use.

In 1748 Euler published a theorem showing that a particular kind of continued fraction is equivalent to a certain very general infinite series. Euler&#x27;s continued fraction formula is still the basis of many modern proofs of convergence of continued fractions.

In 1761, Johann Heinrich Lambert gave the first proof that is irrational, by using the following continued fraction for :

:formula_10

Continued fractions can also be applied to problems in number theory, and are especially useful in the study of Diophantine equations. In the late eighteenth century Lagrange used continued fractions to construct the general solution of Pell&#x27;s equation, thus answering a question that had fascinated mathematicians for more than a thousand years. Lagrange&#x27;s discovery implies that the canonical continued fraction expansion of the square root of every non-square integer is periodic and that, if the period is of length , it contains a palindromic string of length .

In 1813 Gauss derived from complex-valued hypergeometric functions what is now called Gauss&#x27;s continued fractions. They can be used to express many elementary functions and some more advanced functions (such as the Bessel functions), as continued fractions that are rapidly convergent almost everywhere in the complex plane.

== Notation ==

The long continued fraction expression displayed in the introduction is easy for an unfamiliar reader to interpret. However, it takes up a lot of space and can be difficult to typeset. So mathematicians have devised several alternative notations. One convenient way to express a generalized continued fraction sets each nested fraction on the same line, indicating the nesting by dangling plus signs in the denominators:

:formula_11

Sometimes the plus signs are typeset to vertically align with the denominators but not under the fraction bars:

:formula_12
=== The equivalence transformation ===

If is any infinite sequence of non-zero complex numbers we can prove, by induction, that

:formula_13

where equality is understood as equivalence, which is to say that the successive convergents of the continued fraction on the left are exactly the same as the convergents of the fraction on the right.

The equivalence transformation is perfectly general, but two particular cases deserve special mention. First, if none of the are zero, a sequence can be chosen to make each partial numerator a 1:

:formula_14
where , , , and in general .

Second, if none of the partial denominators are zero we can use a similar procedure to choose another sequence to make each partial denominator a 1:

:formula_15
where and otherwise .

These two special cases of the equivalence transformation are enormously useful when the general convergence problem is analyzed.

=== Notions of convergence ===

As mentioned in the introduction, the continued fraction

:formula_16

converges if the sequence of convergents } tends to a finite limit. This notion of convergence is very natural, but it is sometimes too restrictive. It is therefore useful to introduce the notion of general convergence of a continued fraction. Roughly speaking, this consists in replacing the formula_17 part of the fraction by , instead of by 0, to compute the convergents. The convergents thus obtained are called &quot;modified convergents&quot;. We say that the continued fraction &quot;converges generally&quot; if there exists a sequence formula_18 such that the sequence of modified convergents converges for all formula_19 sufficiently distinct from formula_18. The sequence formula_18 is then called an &quot;exceptional sequence&quot; for the continued fraction. See Chapter 2 of for a rigorous definition.

There also exists a notion of absolute convergence for continued fractions, which is based on the notion of absolute convergence of a series: a continued fraction is said to be &quot;absolutely convergent&quot; when the series

:formula_22

where formula_23 are the convergents of the continued fraction, converges absolutely. The Śleszyński–Pringsheim theorem provides a sufficient condition for absolute convergence.

Finally, a continued fraction of one or more complex variables is &quot;uniformly convergent&quot; in an open neighborhood when its convergents converge uniformly on ; that is, when for every there exists such that for all , for all formula_24,

:formula_25

=== Even and odd convergents ===

It is sometimes necessary to separate a continued fraction into its even and odd parts. For example, if the continued fraction diverges by oscillation between two distinct limit points and , then the sequence must converge to one of these, and must converge to the other. In such a situation it may be convenient to express the original continued fraction as two different continued fractions, one of them converging to , and the other converging to .

The formulas for the even and odd parts of a continued fraction can be written most compactly if the fraction has already been transformed so that all its partial denominators are unity. Specifically, if

:formula_26

is a continued fraction, then the even part and the odd part are given by

:formula_27

and

:formula_28

respectively. More precisely, if the successive convergents of the continued fraction are , then the successive convergents of as written above are , and the successive convergents of are .

===Conditions for irrationality===

If and are positive integers with for all sufficiently large , then
:formula_16

converges to an irrational limit.

===Fundamental recurrence formulas===

The partial numerators and denominators of the fraction&#x27;s successive convergents are related by the &quot;fundamental recurrence formulas&quot;:
:formula_30

The continued fraction&#x27;s successive convergents are then given by
:formula_31

These recurrence relations are due to John Wallis (1616–1703) and Leonhard Euler (1707–1783).
These recurrence relations are simply a different notation for the relations obtained by Pietro Antonio Cataldi (1548-1626).

As an example, consider the regular continued fraction in canonical form that represents the golden ratio:

:formula_32

Applying the fundamental recurrence formulas we find that the successive numerators are and the successive denominators are , the Fibonacci numbers. Since all the partial numerators in this example are equal to one, the determinant formula assures us that the absolute value of the difference between successive convergents approaches zero quite rapidly.

== Linear fractional transformations ==

A linear fractional transformation (LFT) is a complex function of the form

:formula_33

where is a complex variable, and are arbitrary complex constants such that . An additional restriction that is customarily imposed, to rule out the cases in which is a constant. The linear fractional transformation, also known as a Möbius transformation, has many fascinating properties. Four of these are of primary importance in developing the analytic theory of continued fractions.
*If the LFT has one or two fixed points. This can be seen by considering the equation

::formula_34

:which is clearly a quadratic equation in . The roots of this equation are the fixed points of . If the discriminant is zero the LFT fixes a single point; otherwise it has two fixed points.

*If the LFT is an invertible conformal mapping of the extended complex plane onto itself. In other words, this LFT has an inverse function

::formula_35

:such that for every point in the extended complex plane, and both and preserve angles and shapes at vanishingly small scales. From the form of we see that is also an LFT.

*The composition of two different LFTs for which is itself an LFT for which . In other words, the set of all LFTs for which is closed under composition of functions. The collection of all such LFTs, together with the &quot;group operation&quot; composition of functions, is known as the automorphism group of the extended complex plane.
*If the LFT reduces to

::formula_36

:which is a very simple meromorphic function of with one simple pole (at ) and a residue equal to . (See also Laurent series.)

=== The continued fraction as a composition of LFTs ===

Consider a sequence of simple linear fractional transformations

:formula_37

Here we use to represent each simple LFT, and we adopt the conventional circle notation for composition of functions. We also introduce a new symbol to represent the composition of transformations ; that is,

:formula_38

and so forth. By direct substitution from the first set of expressions into the second we see that

:formula_39

and, in general,

:formula_40

where the last partial denominator in the finite continued fraction is understood to be . And, since , the image of the point under the iterated LFT is indeed the value of the finite continued fraction with partial numerators:

:formula_41

=== A geometric interpretation ===

Defining a finite continued fraction as the image of a point under the iterated linear fractional transformation leads to an intuitively appealing geometric interpretation of infinite continued fractions.

The relationship

:formula_42

can be understood by rewriting and in terms of the fundamental recurrence formulas:

:formula_43

In the first of these equations the ratio tends toward as tends toward zero. In the second, the ratio tends toward as tends to infinity. This leads us to our first geometric interpretation. If the continued fraction converges, the successive convergents are eventually arbitrarily close together. Since the linear fractional transformation is a continuous mapping, there must be a neighborhood of that is mapped into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of . Similarly, there must be a neighborhood of the point at infinity which is mapped into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of . So if the continued fraction converges the transformation maps both very small and very large into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of , the value of the continued fraction, as gets larger and larger.

For intermediate values of , since the successive convergents are getting closer together we must have

:formula_44

where is a constant, introduced for convenience. But then, by substituting in the expression for we obtain

:formula_45

so that even the intermediate values of (except when ) are mapped into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of , the value of the continued fraction, as gets larger and larger. Intuitively, it is almost as if the convergent continued fraction maps the entire extended complex plane into a single point.

Notice that the sequence lies within the automorphism group of the extended complex plane, since each is a linear fractional transformation for which . And every member of that automorphism group maps the extended complex plane into itself: not one of the can possibly map the plane into a single point. Yet in the limit the sequence defines an infinite continued fraction which (if it converges) represents a single point in the complex plane.

When an infinite continued fraction converges, the corresponding sequence of LFTs &quot;focuses&quot; the plane in the direction of , the value of the continued fraction. At each stage of the process a larger and larger region of the plane is mapped into a neighborhood of , and the smaller and smaller region of the plane that&#x27;s left over is stretched out ever more thinly to cover everything outside that neighborhood.

For divergent continued fractions, we can distinguish three cases:
#The two sequences and might themselves define two convergent continued fractions that have two different values, and . In this case the continued fraction defined by the sequence diverges by oscillation between two distinct limit points. And in fact this idea can be generalized: sequences can be constructed that oscillate among three, or four, or indeed any number of limit points. Interesting instances of this case arise when the sequence constitutes a subgroup of finite order within the group of automorphisms over the extended complex plane.
# The sequence may produce an infinite number of zero denominators while also producing a subsequence of finite convergents. These finite convergents may not repeat themselves or fall into a recognizable oscillating pattern. Or they may converge to a finite limit, or even oscillate among multiple finite limits. No matter how the finite convergents behave, the continued fraction defined by the sequence diverges by oscillation with the point at infinity in this case.
#The sequence may produce no more than a finite number of zero denominators . while the subsequence of finite convergents dances wildly around the plane in a pattern that never repeats itself and never approaches any finite limit either.

Interesting examples of cases 1 and 3 can be constructed by studying the simple continued fraction

:formula_46

where is any real number such that .

== Euler&#x27;s continued fraction formula ==
Euler proved the following identity:

:formula_47

From this many other results can be derived, such as

:formula_48

and

:formula_49

Euler&#x27;s formula connecting continued fractions and series is the motivation for the , and also the basis of elementary approaches to the convergence problem.

==Examples==

===Transcendental functions and numbers===

Here are two continued fractions that can be built via Euler&#x27;s identity.

:formula_50

:formula_51

Here are additional generalized continued fractions:

:formula_52

:formula_53

:formula_54

This last is based on an algorithm derived by Aleksei Nikolaevich Khovansky in the 1970s.

Example: the natural logarithm of 2 (= ≈ 0.693147...):

:formula_55
Here are three of &#x27;s best-known generalized continued fractions, the first and third of which are derived from their respective arctangent formulas above by setting and multiplying by 4. The Leibniz formula for:

:formula_56

converges too slowly, requiring roughly terms to achieve correct decimal places. The series derived by Nilakantha Somayaji:

:formula_57

is a much more obvious expression but still converges quite slowly, requiring nearly 50 terms for five decimals and nearly 120 for six. Both converge &quot;sublinearly&quot; to . On the other hand:

:formula_58

converges &quot;linearly&quot; to , adding at least three digits of precision per four terms, a pace slightly faster than the arcsine formula for:

:formula_59

which adds at least three decimal digits per five terms.
*Note: this continued fraction&#x27;s rate of convergence tends to , hence tends to , whose common logarithm is . The same (the silver ratio squared) also is observed in the &quot;unfolded&quot; general continued fractions of both the natural logarithm of 2 and the th root of 2 (which works for any integer ) if calculated using . For the &quot;folded&quot; general continued fractions of both expressions, the rate convergence , hence , whose common logarithm is , thus adding at least three digits per two terms. This is because the folded GCF folds each pair of fractions from the unfolded GCF into one fraction, thus doubling the convergence pace. The Manny Sardina reference further explains &quot;folded&quot; continued fractions.
*Note: Using the continued fraction for cited above with the best-known Machin-like formula provides an even more rapidly, although still linearly, converging expression:

::formula_60

with and .

===Roots of positive numbers===

The th root of any positive number can be expressed by restating , resulting in

:formula_61

which can be simplified, by folding each pair of fractions into one fraction, to

:formula_62

The square root of is a special case with and :

:formula_63

which can be simplified by noting that :

:formula_64

The square root can also be expressed by a periodic continued fraction, but the above form converges more quickly with the proper and .

====Example 1====
The cube root of two (21/3 or ≈ 1.259921...) can be calculated in two ways:

Firstly, &quot;standard notation&quot; of , , and :

:formula_65

Secondly, a rapid convergence with , and :

:formula_66

====Example 2====
Pogson&#x27;s ratio (1001/5 or ≈ 2.511886...), with , and :

:formula_67

====Example 3====
The twelfth root of two (21/12 or ≈ 1.059463...), using &quot;standard notation&quot;:

:formula_68

====Example 4====
Equal temperament&#x27;s perfect fifth (27/12 or ≈ 1.498307...), with :

With &quot;standard notation&quot;:

:formula_69

A rapid convergence with , , and :

:formula_70

:formula_71

More details on this technique can be found in &quot;General Method for Extracting Roots using (Folded) Continued Fractions&quot;.

==Higher dimensions==

Another meaning for generalized continued fraction is a generalization to higher dimensions. For example, there is a close relationship between the simple continued fraction in canonical form for the irrational real number , and the way lattice points in two dimensions lie to either side of the line . Generalizing this idea, one might ask about something related to lattice points in three or more dimensions. One reason to study this area is to quantify the mathematical coincidence idea; for example, for monomials in several real numbers, take the logarithmic form and consider how small it can be. Another reason is to find a possible solution to Hermite&#x27;s problem.

There have been numerous attempts to construct a generalized theory. Notable efforts in this direction were made by Felix Klein (the Klein polyhedron), Georges Poitou and George Szekeres.

<doc id="739204" wikidata="Q291279" url="?curid=739204" title="South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region">
<text>The South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region is one of two autonomous regions in Nicaragua. It was created along with the North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region by the Autonomy Statute of 7 September 1987 through a division of the former Zelaya Department. It covers an area of and has a population of 420,935 (2021 estimate). The capital is Bluefields. Bordering the Caribbean Sea, it contains part of the region known as Mosquitia.

It is divided into 12 municipalities: Bluefields, the Corn Islands, Desembocadura de Río Grande, El Ayote, El Rama, El Tortuguero, Kukra Hill, La Cruz de Río Grande, Muelle de los Bueyes, Nueva Guinea, Paiwas, and Pearl Lagoon. Eight languages are spoken in the region, with English Creole and Spanish being dominant. The regional official languages are: Spanish (national official language of Nicaragua), Creole (Miskito Coast Creole and Rama Cay Creole), Sumo &quot;(Mayangna and Ulwa)&quot;, Rama, Miskito, and Garifuna. 

The Pearl Cays archipelago is also a part of the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region but mainly belonging to the municipality of Pearl Lagoon.

== Economy ==
=== Agriculture ===
Approximately 30 percent of the Caribbean Coast’s labor force forms part of the agriculture industry.

According to the IV National Agricultural Census prepared by the National Development Information Institute (INIDE) and, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAGFOR), products with greater production potential in the Caribbean Coast are: oil palm, coconut, pineapple, sesame seeds, irrigated rice, rainfed rice, onion cultivation, chia, chilli pepper, red bean of apante, premium red bean, premium black bean, corn, malanga, quequisque, cassava, dry land banana, sugar cane, higuerilla, cacao and robusta coffee.

=== Fishing ===
The fishery sector represents the third activity in terms of importance of incomes generation to the country. Historically the fishery has been concentrated in shrimp, lobster and some species of fishes. In 2016, the Caribbean Coast contributed to the national production of fishery and aquiculture with 24 million of pounds, and exported 76 percent with a value of US$126 million.

=== Mining ===
Mining has a tradition of more than one hundred years in the Northern and Southern Caribbean Coast Autonomous Regions. Although its participation in the international market has been modest due to historical factors, the mining sector has been growing since 2010, exporting 357 million dollars in 2016. Around 380 hectares in the North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region have been awarded under metallic and non-metallic mining concessions, most of which are located in the municipalities of Rosita, Bonanza and Siuna. 220 hectares are currently being exploited. 

=== Livestock, dairy and meat production ===
The Caribbean Coast represents 35 percent of the Nicaragua cattle industry. With an annual compound growth rate of 9 percent in meat exports and 11 percent per year in milk production over the past 8 years, Nicaragua maintains its position as the main livestock, dairy products and meat producer of the Central American region.

=== Forestry ===
The region represents an estimate of 37,394 km² of land with potential for timber production of high commercial value such as mahogany, laurel, and teak. Since 2003, there has been an increase of commercially valuable timber plantations such as teak and mahogany. In 2014-2020, investments in the forestry sector in the region has been over US$100 million.

== Infrastructure ==

Currently, around 300 km of roads are maintained. Rural roads measure approx. 2,415 kilometers of rural roads. There are 157 vehicular and pedestrian bridges.

=== Ports and airports ===
The South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region has one port for commercial use: The Bluff. The Bluff is located on the Bluefields Bay, 6 nautical miles offshore and about 98 miles north of Costa Rica. This port is only accessible by water. The navigation route that connects The Bluff with Rama is approximately 100 kilometers along Escondido River, which has been marked with navigation buoys. The port offers services to guide ships through the Escondido River and all the way to the Rama port.

=== Electric energy ===
As of 2016, 52 percent of the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region had direct access to the national electricity power grid and enjoyed an uninterrupted power supply. This represents approximately 313 communities in both regions, where about US$30 million have been invested to continue improving the quality and coverage of the energy service.

== Transportation ==
=== Air ===
The local airline La Costeña currently provides aerial transportation between Managua and the Caribbean Coast. It currently offers daily flights to Puerto Cabezas, Bluefields, Corn Island, Siuna, Bonanza, Río San Juan and Waspam. Likewise, the Caribbean Coast has three main cargo terminals located in Puerto Cabezas (Bilwi), Bluefields and Corn Island. All Airports are administered by EAAI.

<text>121 Hermione is a very large binary asteroid discovered in 1872. It orbits in the Cybele group in the far outer asteroid belt. As an asteroid of the dark C spectral type, it is probably composed of carbonaceous materials. In 2002, a small moon was found to be orbiting Hermione.

== Discovery ==
Hermione was discovered by J. C. Watson on 12 May 1872 from Ann Arbor, Michigan, in the United States, and named after Hermione, daughter of Menelaus and Helen in Greek mythology.

== Physical properties ==

The asteroid has a bi-lobed shape, as evidenced by adaptive optics images, the first of which were taken in December 2003 with the Keck telescope. Of several proposed shape models that agreed with the images, a &quot;snowman&quot;-like shape was found to best fit the observed precession rate of Hermione&#x27;s satellite. In this &quot;snowman&quot; model, the asteroid&#x27;s shape can be approximated by two partially overlapping spheres of radii 80 and 60 km, whose centers are separated by a distance of 115 km. A simple ellipsoid shape was ruled out.

Observation of the satellite&#x27;s orbit has made possible an accurate determination of Hermione&#x27;s mass. For the best-fit &quot;snowman&quot; model, the density is found to be 1.8 ± 0.2 g/cm3, giving a porosity on the order of 20%, and possibly indicating that the main components are fractured solid bodies, rather than the asteroid being a rubble pile.

Occultations by Hermione have been successfully observed three times so far, the last time in February 2004.
== Moon ==

A satellite of Hermione was discovered in 2002 with the Keck II telescope. It is about 8 miles (13 km) in diameter. The satellite is provisionally designated S/2002 (121) 1. It has not yet been officially named, but &quot;LaFayette&quot; has been proposed by a group of astronomers in reference to the frigate used in secret by the Marquis de Lafayette to reach America to help the insurgents.

<doc id="739219" wikidata="Q1261151" url="?curid=739219" title="Therapeutic drug monitoring">
<text>Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a branch of clinical chemistry and clinical pharmacology that specializes in the measurement of medication levels in blood. Its main focus is on drugs with a narrow therapeutic range, i.e. drugs that can easily be under- or overdosed. TDM aimed at improving patient care by individually adjusting the dose of drugs for which clinical experience or clinical trials have shown it improved outcome in the general or special populations. It can be based on a &quot;a priori&quot; pharmacogenetic, demographic and clinical information, and/or on the &quot;a posteriori&quot; measurement of blood concentrations of drugs (pharmacokinetic monitoring) or biological surrogate or end-point markers of effect (pharmacodynamic monitoring).

There are numerous variables that influence the interpretation of drug concentration data: time, route and dose of drug given, time of blood sampling, handling and storage conditions, precision and accuracy of the analytical method, validity of pharmacokinetic models and assumptions, co-medications and, last but not least, clinical status of the patient (i.e. disease, renal/hepatic status, biologic tolerance to drug therapy, etc.).

Many different professionals (physicians, clinical pharmacists, nurses, medical laboratory scientists, etc.) are involved with the various elements of drug concentration monitoring, which is a truly multidisciplinary process. Because failure to properly carry out any one of the components can severely affect the usefulness of using drug concentrations to optimize therapy, an organized approach to the overall process is critical.
== &quot;A priori&quot; therapeutic drug monitoring ==
&quot;A priori&quot; TDM consists of determining the initial dose regimen to be given to a patient, based on clinical endpoint and on established population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships. These relationships help to identify sub-populations of patients with different dosage requirements, by utilizing demographic data, clinical findings, clinical chemistry results, and/or, when appropriate, pharmacogenetic characteristics.

== &quot;A posteriori&quot; therapeutic drug monitoring ==
The concept of &quot;a posteriori&quot; TDM corresponds to the usual meaning of TDM in medical practice, which refers to the readjustment of the dosage of a given treatment in response to the measurement of an appropriate marker of drug exposure or effect. TDM encompasses all aspects of this feedback control, namely:
* it includes pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical phases, each with the same importance; 
* it is most often based on the specific, accurate, precise and timely determinations of the active and.or toxic forms of drugs in biological samples collected at the appropriate times in the correct containers (PK monitoring), or can employ the measurement of a biological perimeter as a surrogate or end-point marker of effect (PD monitoring) e.g. concentration of an endogenous compound, enzymatic activity, gene expression, etc. either as a complement to PK monitoring or as the main TDM tool; 
* it requires interpretation of the results, taking into account pre-analytical conditions, clinical information and the clinical efficiency of the current dosage regimen; this can be achieved by the application of PK-PD modeling; 
* it can potentially benefit from population PK/PD models possibly combined with individual pharmacokinetic forecasting techniques, or pharmacogenetic data.

== Characteristics of drugs candidate to therapeutic drug monitoring ==
In pharmacotherapy, many medications are used without monitoring of blood levels, as their dosage can generally be varied according to the clinical response that a patient gets to that substance. For certain drugs, this is impracticable, while insufficient levels will lead to undertreatment or resistance, and excessive levels can lead to toxicity and tissue damage.

Indications in favor of therapeutic drug monitoring include:
* consistent, clinically established pharmacodynamic relationships between plasma drug concentrations and pharmacological efficacy and/or toxicity;
* significant between-patient pharmacokinetic variability, making a standard dosage achieve different concentration levels among patients (while the drug disposition remains relatively stable in a given patient);
* narrow therapeutic window of the drug, which forbids giving high doses in all patients to ensure overall efficacy; 
* drug dosage optimization not achievable based on clinical observation alone;
* duration of the treatment and criticality for patient&#x27;s condition justifying dosage adjustment efforts; 
* potential patient compliance problems that might be remedied through concentration monitoring.

TDM determinations are also used to detect and diagnose poisoning with drugs, should the suspicion arise.

Examples of drugs widely analysed for therapeutic drug monitoring:
* Aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin)
* Antiepileptics (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin and valproic acid)
* Mood stabilisers, especially lithium citrate
* Antipsychotics (such as pimozide and clozapine)
* Digoxin
* Ciclosporin, tacrolimus in organ transplant recipients

TDM increasingly proposed for a number of therapeutic drugs, e.g. many antibiotics, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and other targeted anticancer agents, TNF inhibitors and other biological agents, antifungal agents, antiretroviral agents used in HIV infection, psychiatric drugs etc.

== Practice of therapeutic drug monitoring ==

Automated analytical methods such as enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique or fluorescence polarization immunoassay are widely available in medical laboratories for drugs frequently measured in practice. Nowadays, most other drugs can be readily measured in blood or plasma using versatile methods such as liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry or gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, which progressively replaced high-performance liquid chromatography. Yet, TDM is not limited to the provision of precise and accurate concentration measurement results, it also involves appropriate medical interpretation, based on robust scientific knowledge.

In order to guarantee the quality of this clinical interpretation, it is essential that the sample be taken under good conditions: i.e., preferably under a stable dosage, at a standardized sampling time (often at the end of a dosing interval), excluding any source of bias (sample contamination or dilution, analytical interferences) and having carefully recorded the sampling time, the last dose intake time, the current dosage and the influential patient&#x27;s characteristics. 

The interpretation of a drug concentration result goes through the following stages:
# Determine whether the observed concentration is in the “normal range” expected under the dosage administered, taking into account the patient&#x27;s individual characteristics. This requires referring to population pharmacokinetic studies of the drug in consideration. 
# Determine whether the patient&#x27;s concentration profile is close to the “exposure target” associated with the best trade-off between probability of therapeutic success and risk of toxicity. This refers to clinical pharmacodynamic knowledge describing dose-concentration-response relationships among treated patients. 
# If the observed concentration is plausible but far from the suitable level, determine how to adjust the dosage to drive the concentration curve close to target. Several approaches exist for this, from the easiest “rule of three” to sophisticated computer-assisted calculations implementing Bayesian inference algorithms based on population pharmacokinetics.

Ideally, the usefulness of a TDM strategy should be confirmed through an evidence-based approach involving the performance of well-designed controlled clinical trials. In practice however, TDM has undergone formal clinical evaluation only for a limited number of drugs to date, and much of its development rests on empirical foundations.

Point-of-care tests for an easy performance of TDM at the medical practice are under elaboration.

== Integration with Precision Medicine : Model-Informed Precision Dosing ==
The evolution of information technology holds great promise for using the methods and knowledge of pharmacometrics to bring patient treatment closer to the ideal of precision medicine (which is not just about adjusting treatments to genetic factors, but encompasses all aspects of therapeutic individualization). Model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) should enable significant progress to be made in taking into account the many factors influencing drug response, in order to optimize therapies (&quot;a priori&quot; TDM). It should also make it possible to take optimal account of TDM results to individualize drug dosage &quot;(a posteriori&quot; TDM). Ideally, these computational approaches will be integrated into the electronic patient record in the form of clinical decision support systems (CDSS), automatically and seamlessly linking laboratory resources and pharmacological expertise with clinicians and caregivers at the patient&#x27;s bedside. Software tools already exist and continue to be developed for this purpose. They are set to play an increasingly important role in patient treatment, in the same way that instrument piloting has become the norm in aviation.

<doc id="739230" wikidata="Q1207347" url="?curid=739230" title="Shibuya-kei">
<text>is a microgenre of pop music or a general aesthetic that flourished in Japan in the mid-to-late 1990s. The music genre is distinguished by a &quot;cut-and-paste&quot; approach that was inspired by the kitsch, fusion, and from certain music styles of the past. The most common reference points were 1960s culture and Western pop music, especially the work of Burt Bacharach, Brian Wilson, Phil Spector, and Serge Gainsbourg.

Shibuya-kei first emerged as retail music from the Shibuya district of Tokyo. Flipper&#x27;s Guitar, a duo led by Kenji Ozawa and Keigo Oyamada (Cornelius), formed the bedrock of the genre and influenced all of its groups, but the most prominent Shibuya-kei band was Pizzicato Five, who fused mainstream J-pop with a mix of jazz, soul, and lounge influences. Shibuya-kei peaked in the late 1990s and declined after its principal players began moving into other music styles.

Overseas, fans of Shibuya-kei were typically indie pop enthusiasts, which contrasted with the tendency for other Japanese music scenes to attract listeners of foreign anime fandoms. This was partly because many Shibuya-kei records had been distributed in the United States through major indie labels like Matador and Grand Royal.

== Background and influences ==

The term &quot;Shibuya-kei&quot; comes from , one of the 23 special wards of Tokyo, known for its concentration of stylish restaurants, bars, buildings, record shops, and bookshops. In the late 1980s, the term &quot;J-pop&quot; was formulated by FM radio station J-Wave as a way to distinguish Western-sounding Japanese music (a central characteristic of Shibuya-kei) from exclusively Euro-American music. In 1991, HMV Shibuya opened a J-pop corner which showcased displays and leaflets that highlighted indie records. It was one of those displays that coined the moniker &quot;Shibuya-kei&quot;.

At the time, Shibuya was an epicenter for Tokyo fashion, nightlife, and youth culture with a cluster of record shops like Tower Records and HMV, which housed a selection of imports, as well as fashionable record boutiques. British independent record labels such as él Records and the Compact Organization had been influences on the various Japanese indie distributors, and thanks to the late 1980s economic boom in Japan, Shibuya music shops could afford to stock a wider selection of genres.

Musicologist Mori Yoshitaka writes that popular groups from the area responded with their &quot;eclectically fashionable hybrid music influenced by different musical resources from around the world in a way that might be identified as postmodernist ... they were able to listen to, quote, sample, mix, and dub this music, and eventually create a new hybrid music. In other words, &quot;Shibuya-kei&quot; was a byproduct of consumerism&quot;. Journalist W. David Marx notes that the musicians were less interested in having an original sound than they were about having a sound that reflected their personal tastes, that the music &quot;was literally built out of this collection process. The &#x27;creative content&#x27; is almost all curation, since they basically reproduced their favourite songs, changing the melody a bit but keeping all parts of the production intact.&quot;

Specific touchstones include the French yé-yé music of Serge Gainsbourg, the orchestral pop of Van Dyke Parks and the Beach Boys&#x27; Brian Wilson, the lounge pop of Burt Bacharach, and the sunshine pop of Roger Nichols and the Small Circle of Friends. Wilson was romanticized as a mad genius experimenting in the recording studio, and Phil Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound was emulated not for its density, but for its elaborate quality. From él Records, Louis Philippe was heralded as the &quot;godfather&quot; of the Shibuya sound around the time he released the Japan-only albums &quot;Jean Renoir&quot; (1992) and &quot;Rainfall&quot; (1993). Reynolds adds that Postcard Records and &quot;the tradition of Scottish indie pop it spawned was hugely admired, and there was a penchant for what the Japanese dubbed &#x27;funk-a-latina&#x27;: Haircut 100 ..., Blue Rondo à la Turk, Matt Bianco. The composite of all these innocuous and already distinctly ersatz sources was a cosmopolitan hybrid that didn&#x27;t draw on any indigenous Japanese influences.&quot; 

==Development and popularity==

Flipper&#x27;s Guitar, a duo led by Kenji Ozawa and Keigo Oyamada (also known as Cornelius), formed the bedrock of Shibuya-kei and influenced all of its groups. However, the term was not coined until after the fact, and its exact definition would not be crystallized until 1993. Many of these artists indulged in a cut-and-paste style that was inspired by previous genres based on kitsch, fusion, and artifice. In the West, the development of chamber pop and a renewed interest in cocktail music was a remote parallel. According to Reynolds: &quot;What was really international was the &quot;underlying&quot; sensibility. ... The Shibuya-kei approach was common to an emerging class of rootless cosmopolitans with outposts in most major cities of the world ... known pejoratively as hipsters.&quot; Eventually, the music of Shibuya-kei groups and their derivatives could be heard in virtually every cafe and boutique in Japan. Reynolds references this as an issue with its &quot;model of elevated consumerism and curation-as-creation ... Once music is a reflection of esoteric knowledge rather than expressive urgency, its value is easily voided.&quot;

After Oyamada went solo, he became one of the biggest Shibuya-kei successes. Although his debut &quot;The Sun Is My Enemy&quot; only peaked at No. 15 on Japanese singles charts, writer Ian Martin calls it a &quot;key track&quot; that helped define Shibuya-kei. His 1997 album &quot;Fantasma&quot; is also considered one of the greatest achievements of the genre. Oyamada landed praise from American music critics, who called him a &quot;modern-day Brian Wilson&quot; or the &quot;Japanese Beck&quot;. Marx described the album as &quot;an important textbook for an alternative musical history where Bach, Bacharach, and the Beach Boys stands as the great triumvirate.&quot;

The most prominent Shibuya-kei band was Pizzicato Five, who fused mainstream J-pop with a mix of jazz, soul, and lounge influences, reaching a commercial peak with &quot;Made in USA&quot; (1994). As the style&#x27;s popularity increased at end of the 1990s, the term began to be applied to many bands whose musical stylings reflected a more mainstream sensibility. Although some artists rejected or resisted being categorized as &quot;Shibuya-kei,&quot; the name ultimately stuck, as the style was favored by local businesses, including Shibuya Center Street&#x27;s HMV Shibuya, which sold Shibuya-kei records in its traditional Japanese music section. Increasingly, musicians outside Japan—including Momus, La Casa Azul, Dimitri from Paris, Ursula 1000, Nicola Conte, Natural Calamity, and Phofo—are labeled Shibuya-kei. South Korean bands such as Clazziquai Project, Casker, and Humming Urban Stereo have been said to represent &quot;a Korean neo-Shibuya-kei movement&quot;.

Shibuya-kei&#x27;s prominence declined after its principal players began moving into other music styles. Momus said in a 2015 interview that the subculture had more to do with the area itself, which he called &quot;an overblown shopping district&quot;.

<text>Yine Sensiz (&quot;Again Without You&quot;) is the 1992 album of the Turkish pop singer Tarkan. It was released in Turkey. This was his debut album and launched him onto the Turkish pop scene, which was modest at the time. The 1992 edition was only released as a cassette. It was re-released in CD format in 1993 with three new remixes. By 1994, the album sold over 600,000 copies officially, with an additional 400,000 copies illegally.

==Marketing and Music videos==

In Turkish then album-oriented record market, it was not common the release of singles in order to promote the album. Instead, Tarkan recorded music videos for several of the album songs which were released gradually.

His first released video was &quot;Kıl Oldum&quot;, in 21 December 1992. It was directed by Mert Özmen and had two versions, one with children and another with a monkey. In 3 February 1993 the video for &quot;Kimdi?&quot; was released. Directed by Cumhur Atalay and Metin Arolat, there were also two videos made for this track: one in which Tarkan is a post-officer and the other in which he is wearing yellow trousers, like in &quot;Kıl Oldum&quot;&#x27;s video. 

After Tarkan&#x27;s appearance at &quot;Elma&quot; show, on Teleon broadcasting channel, the album&#x27;s sales skyrocketed and promotion increased. The third video released by the singer was for &quot;Gelipte Halimi Gördün mü?&quot;, in 19 April 1993. In 6 June 1993 was the premiere of the video for &quot;Vazgeçemem&quot;, which came to be one of his greatest hits. There were three videos made for this track: the one whose background is a fountain, another in which Tarkan sings in a restaurant, and a simple white backgrounded video. The CD with bonus tracks was released in 21 June 1993.

In 23 July 1993, the fifth video off the album was released: &quot;Selam Ver&quot;. This was followed in 27 August 1993 by the video for &quot;Çok Ararsın Beni (Remix)&quot;. An alternate video was filmed for the original version of the song to be released even before &quot;Kıl Oldum&quot;, but it is rumoured that it was taken off air by Tarkan. Lastly, in 10 September 1993, a video for &quot;Söz Verdim&quot; was released. Also, &quot;Sarıl Bana&quot; and &quot;Oldu Canım Ara Beni&quot; were promoted on television and their videos received some airplay.

<text>Henri Gerard Winkelman (17 August 1876 – 27 December 1952) was a Dutch military officer who served as Commander-in-chief of the Armed forces of the Netherlands during the German invasion of the Netherlands.

==Pre-war==
Winkelman was born in Maastricht as the son of Julius Hendrik Winkelman and Charlotte Henriëtte Braams. After he completed his secondary education he attended the Royal Military Academy (KMA) in Breda. His goal was to become an officer in the KNIL, the Dutch colonial army for the Dutch East Indies. During his training he adjusted his goal and became an infantry officer. He was promoted to Lieutenant in 1896.

He married Arendin Jacomina Coert in 1902 and they had two sons and two daughters. Having completed his military education, he began to climb up the ranks of the Dutch army. In 1913 he was promoted to Captain, in 1923 he became a Major and in 1931 he was given the rank of Major General and became the commander of the Dutch 4th division. In 1934 he became a Lieutenant General, but left the military shortly thereafter. Winkelman campaigned for the position of Chief of Staff of the Dutch Army, but lost to General Izaak Reijnders. Winkelman then decided to retire and was granted an honorable discharge. As a retired officer, he remained active in various ways and consulted.

The Dutch mobilised their armed forces on 28 August 1939, four days before Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland. Chief of Staff, General Reijnders, was appointed as Supreme Commander of the Dutch forces, but it was clear from the outset that his personal and professional relationship with Defence secretary Adriaan Dijxhoorn left a lot to be desired, ultimately leading to Reijnders&#x27; (honorable) discharge on 5 February 1940. After a brief meeting of the Dutch cabinet, General Winkelman was summoned to The Hague (the seat of the Dutch government) and offered appointment as the new Dutch commander. He accepted the job the following day.

==War==

Winkelman was well aware of his army&#x27;s limitations. He had 280,000 men at his disposal not enough to defend the entire country. The Dutch army possessed no tanks. There was a lack of field artillery and anti-aircraft guns. Winkelman was convinced that the Dutch army was incapable of a modern, &quot;mobile&quot; defence. Instead, he decided to keep things simple: the Dutch would only defend &quot;Fortress Holland&quot; (the North Holland, South Holland and Utrecht provinces, roughly the area now referred to as the Randstad), using traditional, static defence lines and fortified fixed positions. Winkelman did not have the illusion that the Dutch could push Hitler&#x27;s armies back into Germany. Instead, the Dutch forces should simply slow the Germans down, win time and keep Fortress Holland in Dutch hands long enough to enable the Allies to join them.

In practice, the three northern provinces (Drenthe, Groningen and Friesland) would remain largely undefended. State-of-the-art fortifications at the east end of the Afsluitdijk (the long dike connecting the Friesland and North Holland provinces) were expected to stop the German invasion and prevent the Germans from threatening Fortress Holland from the north. In the east of the country, the first line of resistance ran along the IJssel and Maas rivers. The main Dutch defence line, however, was in the very heart of the country and called the Grebbe Line, to be defended by the entire 2nd and 4th Army Corps. The Grebbe Line was to be defended until the bitter end, as the eastern front of Fortress Holland (the New Dutch Water Line, once the pride of the Dutch defence system was deemed obsolete and too close to major cities such as Utrecht and Amsterdam).

The German invasion started on 10 May 1940 at 3:55 a.m. local time. Hitler&#x27;s bold plan to drop paratroopers around The Hague, push into the city and capture the Dutch government, the Royal Family and the Supreme Army Command to force the Netherlands to its knees within 24 hours, ended in failure. In the east, the Germans crossed the Dutch borders with relative ease, but were halted near the main Dutch defences: the Grebbe Line and the Afsluitdijk fortifications. After one day of war, General Winkelman was relatively satisfied about the way his troops had reacted to the first German push. The only area where the situation was already critical was in the south: paratroopers had secured the Moerdijk bridges, south of Rotterdam and Dordrecht. Meanwhile, strong German infantry (supported by the 9th Panzer Division) had smashed through the so-called Peel-Raam Stelling and now marched rapidly through the southern province of North Brabant, threatening to establish contact with the bridge head at Moerdijk and to enter Fortress Holland from the south, effectively isolating the Netherlands from Belgium and France. An attempt, supported by French units, to recapture the Moerdijk bridges failed on 11 May. Attempts to regain lost ground in the Grebbe Line were also unsuccessful.

On 13 May, after the departure of Queen Wilhelmina to London, and with most ministers in Hoek van Holland ready to depart, minister Max Steenberghe, on his own initiative, but in name of the queen and cabinet, granted the powers of government within the European part of the Netherlands to Winkelman, and requested that the permanent secretaries follow his directions. This was later informally confirmed by the cabinet and afterwards by the queen.

The Grebbe Line fell in the evening of 13 May after a ferocious battle of three days. Meanwhile, the 9th Panzer Division had reached the Moerdijk bridges, breaching &quot;Fortress Holland&quot; and reaching Rotterdam, occupying the south bank of the river Meuse. The situation had now become strategically hopeless, but the north river bank was still in Dutch hands. Dutch machine guns made it impossible for the Germans to cross the Meuse bridges as Dutch marines put up fierce resistance in the streets of Rotterdam, much to the annoyance of Adolf Hitler, who expected to have occupied the Netherlands by now. On 14 May, he ordered that Dutch resistance be crushed at once. The bombing of Rotterdam followed and with, the Germans threatening to give major Dutch city Utrecht the same treatment, General Winkelman was forced to surrender in the evening of 14 May. The capitulation was made official the next day in the village of Rijsoord. After he signed the Dutch surrender, General Winkelman refused to officially declare that he would not resist the German forces in the Netherlands. He was therefore interned on 2 July 1940 and remained a prisoner of war for the remainder of the occupation.

==Post-war==
He was honorably discharged from the Dutch army after the war on 1 October 1945 and given the Military William Order, the oldest and highest military decoration in the Netherlands. His statue can still be seen in front of the elementary school in Rijsoord, where he signed the capitulation on 15 May 1940. An army base in Nunspeet was named after him. The name was transferred to another base (at Harskamp) as of 15 May 2007, after the former closed down. General Henri Winkelman died peacefully at his home on 27 December 1952.

<text>A minister is a politician who heads a ministry, making and implementing decisions on policies in conjunction with the other ministers. In some jurisdictions the head of government is also a minister and is designated the &#x27;prime minister&#x27;, &#x27;premier&#x27;, &#x27;chief minister&#x27;, &#x27;chancellor&#x27; or other title.

In Commonwealth realm jurisdictions which use the Westminster system of government, ministers are usually required to be members of one of the houses of Parliament or legislature, and are usually from the political party that controls a majority in the lower house of the legislature. In other jurisdictions—such as Belgium, Mexico, Netherlands, Philippines, Slovenia, and Nigeria—the holder of a cabinet-level post or other government official is not permitted to be a member of the legislature. Depending on the administrative arrangements in each jurisdiction, ministers are usually heads of a government department and members of the government&#x27;s ministry, cabinet and perhaps of a committee of cabinet. Some ministers may be more senior than others, and some may hold the title &#x27;assistant minister&#x27; or &#x27;deputy minister&#x27;. Some jurisdictions, with a large number of ministers, may designate ministers to be either in the inner or outer ministry or cabinet.

In some jurisdictions—such as Hong Kong, Mexico, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, and the United States—holders of an equivalent cabinet-level post are called secretaries (e.g., the Home Secretary in the United Kingdom, Secretary of State in the United States). Some holders of a cabinet-level post may have another title, such as &#x27;Attorney-General&#x27; or &#x27;Postmaster-General&#x27;.

==Etymology==

The term &#x27;minister&#x27; also is used in diplomacy, for a diplomat of the second class, such as in the title Minister Plenipotentiary, ranking between an Ambassador and a Minister Resident.

The term minister comes from Middle English, deriving from the Old French word , originally in Latin, meaning &quot;servant, attendant&quot;, which itself was derived from the word &quot; meaning &quot;less&quot;.

In jurisdictions that use the Westminster system of government—such as the United Kingdom and Australia—ministers or their equivalents are selected from the legislature, and usually from the political party that controls a majority in the lower house of the legislature. In jurisdictions with strict separation of powers—such as Belgium, Mexico, Netherlands, Philippines, and the United States—ministers cannot be members of the legislature, and a legislator chosen to become a minister must resign from the legislature.

Normally the leader of the majority party becomes the prime minister, or an office of equivalent function, and selects the other ministers. In the Westminster system, these ministers continue to represent their constituency in parliament while being part of the government. Individuals who are not in parliament may be appointed as a minister, usually in order to bring special skills to the government.

In the United Kingdom, a government minister does not have to be a member of either House of Parliament. In practice, however, convention is that ministers must be members of either the House of Commons or House of Lords in order to be accountable to Parliament. From time to time, prime ministers appoint non-parliamentarians as ministers. This can be done by first appointing the person to the House of Lords.

==Types of ministers and their name==
Various countries form ministries as Cabinets (see List of cabinets). Other cabinets are usually included in &quot;Politics of ..&quot;-articles

* Lists of incumbents groups lists of ministers by country

Specific ministers include:

* Agriculture minister
* Commerce minister
* Communications minister
* Culture minister
* Defence minister
* Deputy prime minister
* Education minister
* Energy minister
* Environment minister
* Finance minister
* Foreign minister
*Housing minister
* Health minister
* Industry minister
* Interior minister
* Justice minister
* Labour minister
* Prime minister
* Public works minister
* Science minister
* Sports minister
* Tourism minister
* Transport minister

Some ministers may hold multiple portfolios and lead several ministries simultaneously, while multiple ministers with separate portfolios may oversee a single ministry, or may also share both ministerial and deputy-ministerial portfolios in different ministries. A cabinet minister can sometimes be in charge of no ministry at all, and is then known as a &quot;minister without portfolio&quot;.

<text>In Christianity, a minister is a person authorised by a church or other religious organization to perform functions such as teaching of beliefs; leading services such as weddings, baptisms or funerals; or otherwise providing spiritual guidance to the community. The term is taken from Latin &quot;minister&quot; (&quot;servant&quot;, &quot;attendant&quot;). In some church traditions the term is usually used for people who have been ordained, but in other traditions it can also be used for non-ordained.

In the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church, Anglicanism and Lutheranism, the concept of a priesthood is emphasized, though in the Church of England there are nearly as many non-ordained licensed lay ministers as there are paid clergy. In other traditions such as Baptist, Methodist, and Reformed groups like Congregationalists and Presbyterians, the term &quot;minister&quot; usually refers to a member of the ordained clergy who leads a congregation or participates in a role in a parachurch ministry; such a person may serve as an elder (presbyter), pastor, preacher, bishop, or chaplain.

Ministers are also described as being a man of the cloth. With respect to ecclesiastical address, many ministers are styled as &quot;The Reverend&quot;; however, some use &quot;Pastor&quot; or &quot;Father&quot; as a title.

==Roles and duties==

The Church of England defines the ministry of priests as follows:
Ministers may perform some or all of the following duties:
*assist in co-ordinating volunteers and church community groups
*assist in any general administrative service
*conduct marriage ceremonies, funerals and memorial services, participate in the ordination of other clergy, and confirming young people as members of a local church
*encourage local church endeavors
*engage in welfare and community services activities of communities
*establish new local churches
*keep records as required by civil or church law
*plan and conduct services of public worship
*preach
*pray and encourage others to be theocentric (that is, God-focused)
*preside over sacraments (also called ordinances) of the church. Such as:
**the Lord&#x27;s Supper (a name derived from 1 Corinthians 11:20), also known as the Lord&#x27;s Table (taken from 1 Corinthians 10:21), or Holy Communion, and
**the Baptism of adults or children (depending on the denomination)
*provide leadership to the , parish or church community, this may be done as part of a team with lay people in roles such as elders
*refer people to community support services, psychologists or doctors
*research and study religion, Scripture and theology
*supervise prayer and discussion groups, retreats and seminars, and provide religious instruction
*teach on spiritual and theological subjects
*train leaders for church, community and youth leadership
*work on developing relationships and networks within the religious community
*provide pastoral care in various contexts
*provide personal support to people in crises, such as illness, bereavement and family breakdown
*visit the sick and elderly to counsel and comfort them and their families
*administer Last Rites when designated to do so
*mention prayer of salvation to those interested in becoming a believer

Four styles of minister have been identified:
*player coach, in which the pastor is a &quot;participant in all the processes that the church uses to reach people and see them transformed
*delegating, in which the minister develops members of the church to point that they can be trusted
*directing, where the minister gives specific instructions and then supervises the congregation closely
*combination, where a minister allows directional ministering from a pastoral staff member

==Training and qualifications==

Depending on the denomination, the requirements for ministry vary. All denominations require the minister to have a vocation, a sense of calling. In regards to training, denominations vary in their requirements, from those that emphasize natural gifts to those that also require advanced tertiary education qualifications; for example, from a seminary, theological college or university.

===New Testament===
One of the clearest references is found in , which outlines the requirements of a bishop (&quot;episkopos&quot;: Koine Greek , interpreted as elder by some denominations):
==Related titles and types of Christian ministries==
===Bishops, priests, and deacons===


The Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, Reformed and some Methodist denominations have applied the formal, church-based leadership or an ordained clergy in matters of either the church or broader political and sociocultural import. The churches have three orders of ordained clergy:

*Bishops are the primary clergy, administering all sacraments and governing the church.
*Priests administer the sacraments and lead local congregations; they cannot ordain other clergy, however, nor consecrate buildings.
*In some denominations, deacons play a non-sacramental and assisting role in the liturgy.

In several countries, the clergy were one of the estates of the realm, with separate representation in parliament. After compulsory celibacy was abolished during the Reformation in northern Europe, the formation of a partly hereditary priestly class became possible, whereby wealth and clerical positions were frequently inheritable. Higher positioned clergy formed this clerical educated upper class.

High Church Anglicanism and High Church Lutheranism tend to emphasise the role of the clergy in dispensing the Christian sacraments. The countries that were once a part of the Swedish Empire, i.e. Finland and the Baltics have more markedly preserved Catholic traditions and introduced far less Reformed traditions, hence the role of bishops, priests and deacons are notably more visible.

Bishops, priests and deacons have traditionally officiated over of acts worship, reverence, rituals and ceremonies. Among these central traditions have been baptism, confirmation, penance, anointing of the sick, holy orders, marriage, the mass or the divine service, and coronations. These so-called &quot;social rituals&quot; have formed a part of human culture for tens of thousands of years. Anthropologists see social rituals as one of many cultural universals.

The term &quot;rector&quot; (from the Latin word for &quot;ruler&quot;) or vicar may be used for priests in certain settings, especially in the Catholic and Anglican traditions.

In the Episcopal Church in the United States, a parish, which is responsible for its own finances, is overseen by a rector. A bishop is nominally in control of a financially assisted parish but delegates authority to a vicar (related to the prefix &quot;vice&quot; meaning substitute or deputy).

===Pastors===
The term &quot;pastor&quot; means &quot;shepherd&quot; and is used several times in the New Testament to refer to church workers. Many Protestants use the term as a prenominal title (e.g., Pastor Smith) or as a job title (like Senior Pastor or Worship Pastor).

===Clergy===

The English word &quot;clergy&quot; derives from the same root as &quot;clerk&quot; and can be traced to the Latin &quot;clericus&quot; which derives from the Greek word &quot;kleros&quot; meaning a &quot;lot&quot; or &quot;portion&quot; or &quot;office&quot;. The term Clerk in Holy Orders is still the official title for certain Christian clergy and its usage is prevalent in canon law. Holy orders refer to any recipient of the sacrament of ordination, both the major orders (bishops, priests and deacons) and the now less known minor orders (acolyte, lector, exorcist and porter) who, save for certain reforms made at the Second Vatican Council in the Roman Catholic Church, were called clerics or &quot;clerk&quot;, which is simply a shorter form of &quot;cleric&quot;. Clerics were distinguished from the laity by having received, in a formal rite of introduction into the clerical state, the &quot;tonsure&quot; or &quot;corona&quot; (crown) which involved cutting hair from the top and side of the head leaving a circlet of hair which symbolised the &quot;Crown of Thorns&quot; worn by Christ at his crucifixion.
Though Christian in origin, the term can be applied by analogy to functions in other religious traditions. For example, a rabbi can be referred to as being a clergy member.

&quot;Parson&quot; is a similar term often applied to ordained priests or ministers. The word is a variant on the English word &quot;person&quot; from the Latin &quot;persona&quot; (&quot;mask&quot;) used as a legal term for one having jurisdiction.

===Dominie, Dominee, Dom, Don===
The similar words &quot;Dominie&quot;, &quot;Dominee&quot; and &quot;Dom&quot;, all derived from the Latin &quot;domine&quot; (vocative case of Dominus &quot;Lord, Master&quot;), are used in related contexts.
Dominie, derived directly from Dutch, is used in the United States, &quot;Dominee&quot;, derived from Dutch via Afrikaans is used in South Africa as the title of a pastor of the Dutch Reformed Church. In Scottish English dominie is generally used to mean just schoolmaster. In various Romance languages, shortened forms of Dominus (&quot;Dom, Don&quot;) are commonly used for Catholic priests (sometimes also for lay notables as well) for example Benedictine Monks are titled &quot;Dom&quot;, as in the style &quot;Dom Knight&quot;. Dom or Dominus, as well as the English equivalent, Sir were often used as titles for priests in England up to the 17th century who held Bachelor of Arts degrees.

===Chaplains and padres===

Chaplain as in English or almoner (preferred in many other languages) or their equivalents refer to a minister who has another type of pastoral &quot;target group&quot; than a territorial parish congregation (or in addition to one), such as a military units, schools and hospitals.

The Spanish word Padre (&quot;father&quot;) is often informally used to address military chaplains, also in English and Portuguese (Brazil).

===Elder===
Elders (in Greek, πρεσβυτερος [presbuteros]; see Presbyter) in Christianity are involved in the collective leadership of a local church or of a denomination.
*Some Reformed/non-mainline Presbyterian denominations, Anglican and some Methodists call their ministers teaching elders as well. In Reformed tradition, Ruling elders are also ordained laymen who govern the church along with the teaching elders as the Church session.
*In the Assemblies of God and the Metropolitan Community Church Elders are the most senior leaders serving, leading, and supervising the worldwide denomination. In the Metropolitan Community Church an Elder can be a lay person or clergy.

===Types of ministries in non-denominational church===
*Such as men&#x27;s ministry, women&#x27;s ministry, youth ministry, kids ministry, singles and campus ministries, married couples ministry, because it gives each congregation member of different backgrounds and age groups to have a chance to fellowship with people in a closer life group to them.

==Leaders and pastoral agents==
Lay people, volunteers, pastoral agents, community leaders are responsible to bring teaching the gospel in the forefront helping the clergy to evangelize people. Agents ramify in many ways to act and be in touch with the people in daily life and developing religious projects, socio-political and infrastructural.

*Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses consider every baptized Witness to be a &quot;minister&quot;; the religion permits any qualified baptized adult male to perform a baptism, funeral, or wedding. Typically, however, each such service is performed by an elder or a &quot;ministerial servant&quot; (that is, a deacon), one of the men appointed to &quot;take the lead&quot; in local congregations. Witnesses do not use &quot;elder&quot; or any other term as a title, and do not capitalize the term. They do not accept payment and are not salaried employees or considered &quot;paid clergy&quot;. They support themselves financially. Appointments are made directly by Circuit Overseers under the authority of the local Branch, and Governing Body; appointment is said to be &quot;by holy spirit&quot; because &quot;the qualifications [are] recorded in God&#x27;s spirit-inspired Word&quot; and because appointing committees &quot;pray for holy spirit&quot;.
*In many evangelical churches a group (multiple elders as opposed to a single elder) of (non-staff) elders serve as the spiritual &quot;shepherds&quot; or caretakers of the congregation, usually giving spiritual direction to the pastoral staff, enforcing church discipline, etc. In some denominations these elders are called by other names, i.e.; traditionally &quot;Deacons&quot; in many Baptist churches function as spiritual leaders. In some cases these elders are elected and serve fixed terms. In other cases they are not elected but rather they are &quot;recognized by the congregation as those appointed by the Holy Spirit (Acts 20:28) and meeting the qualifications of 1 Timothy 3:1-7.&quot;

===Monsignor===
Monsignor is an ecclesiastical title of honor bestowed on some priests.

===Prelate===
*A prelate is a member of the clergy having a special canonical jurisdiction over a territory or a group of people.
*Usually, a prelate is a bishop. Prelate sometimes refers to the clergy of a state church with a formal hierarchy, and suggests that the prelate enjoys legal privileges and power as a result of clerical status.

===Father===

*&quot;Father&quot; is a term of address for priests and deacons in some churches, especially the Catholic and Orthodox churches; it is also popular in some parts of the Anglican tradition.
*&quot;Padre&quot; (Spanish word for father, used in Brazil too) is frequently used in the military of English-speaking countries.
*A priest of the regular clergy.
*A pre-Scholastic Christian writer accepted by the church as an authoritative witness to its teaching and practice (see Fathers of the Church: those who were not completely orthodox but nonetheless had a major impact on Christianity, such as Origen and Tertullian, are called &quot;ecclesiastical writers&quot; instead).
*&quot;Mama&quot; is the local native language term for English speaking Anglican priests in the Anglican Church of Melanesia. It means &quot;father&quot; in several local languages in Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands.

===Archbishop===
*In Christianity, an archbishop is an elevated bishop, responsible for all churches belonging to a religious group of a particular district.
*A bishop at the head of an ecclesiastical province or one of equivalent honorary rank.

==Issues==

There are contrasting views on the level of compensation given to ministers relative to the religious community. There is often an expectation that they and their families will shun ostentation. However, there are situations where they are well rewarded for successfully attracting people to their religious community or enhancing the status or power of the community.

The ordination of women has increasingly become accepted within many global religious faith groups, with some women now holding the most senior positions in these organizational hierarchies. There is disagreement between various global church denominations, and within membership of denominations, regarding whether women can be ministers. In 2021 excavations at the site of a Byzantine-era Christian basilica revealed floor mosaics which provide evidence of women serving as ministers, including deacons, in the church.

There was notable contention over the issue of ordination of non-celibate gay people in the 1980s within the United Church of Canada, and in the 1990s and early 21st century within the Presbyterian Church USA. The Episcopal Church, the United States branch of the worldwide Anglican Communion, was divided over the issue of ordination of non-celibate gay people. This conflict severely damaged relationships between Anglicans in North America and in the third world, especially Africa and southeast Asia, and has caused a schism in the American Anglican church.

Ministers, individually or as a class, have been accused of sacerdotalism, the assertion or belief that the minister is an intermediary between God and humanity, or between God and an individual. The view or attitude arose with development of the priesthood as a profession.

==Styles and forms of address==

In the majority of churches, ordained ministers are styled &quot;The Reverend&quot;. However, as stated above, some are styled &quot;Pastor&quot; and others do not use any religious style or form of address, and are addressed as any other person, e.g. as Mr, Ms, Miss, Mrs or by name.

===Anglican===
In Anglican churches, the style for ordained ministers varies according to their office, as below.

*Priests and deacons, from ordination onwards—&quot;The Reverend&quot;
*Priests and deacons appointed as canons—&quot;The Reverend Canon&quot;
*Deans (or Provosts) of a cathedral church—&quot;The Very Reverend&quot;
*Archdeacons of a diocese or region—&quot;The Venerable&quot;
*Bishops (diocesan, suffragan, or coadjutor)—&quot;The Right Reverend&quot;
*Archbishops (and other primate bishops)—&quot;The Most Reverend&quot;

In all cases, the formal style should be followed by a Christian name or initial, e.g. the Reverend John Smith, or the Reverend J. Smith, but never just the Reverend Smith.

These are formal styles. In normal speech (either addressing the clergy or referring to them) other forms of address are often used. For all clergy, this may include the titles &quot;Father&quot; (male) or &quot;Mother&quot; (female), particularly in the Anglo-Catholic tradition, or simply the appropriate secular title (Mister, Doctor, etc.) for that person, particularly in the Evangelical tradition; it is also increasingly common to dispense with formal addresses and titles in favour of verbal address simply by given name. Bishops may be addressed as &quot;My Lord&quot;, and less formally as &quot;Bishop&quot;. Similarly, archbishops may be addressed as &quot;Your Grace&quot;, and less formally as &quot;Archbishop&quot;. The titles &quot;My Lord&quot; and &quot;Your Grace&quot; refer to the places held by these prelates in the Church of England within the order of precedence of the state; however, the same titles are also extended to bishops and archbishops of other Anglican churches, outside England.
As Anglicanism represents a broad range of theological opinion, its presbyterate includes priests who consider themselves no different in any respect from those of the Catholic Church, some parishes and dioceses in &quot;Low Church&quot; or Evangelical circles prefer to use the title &quot;presbyter&quot; or &quot;minister&quot; in order to distance themselves from the more sacrificial theological implications which they associate with the word &quot;priest&quot;. While priest is the official term for a member of the presbyterate in every Anglican province worldwide, the ordination rite of certain provinces (including the Church of England) recognizes the breadth of opinion by adopting the title &quot;The Ordination of Priests (also called Presbyters)&quot;.

===Catholic===
In the Catholic Church, the form of address depends on the office the person holds, and the country in which he is being addressed as they are usually identical to the titles used by their feudal or governmental equals. In most English-speaking countries, the forms of address are:
*A priest is usually referred to as &quot;Father&quot;, and sometimes as &quot;Your Reverence&quot; or &quot;Reverend Father&quot;.
*A monsignor is addressed as &quot;Monsignor.&quot;
*A Canon is usually referred to as &quot;Canon.&quot;
*A bishop is addressed as &quot;Your Excellency&quot; or, less formally, &quot;Excellency&quot;. In Britain and some other countries they are formally addressed as &quot;My Lord&quot; or &quot;My Lord Bishop&quot;.
*An archbishop is also addressed as &quot;Your Excellency&quot; or, less formally, &quot;Excellency&quot;. In Britain and some other countries they are formally addressed as &quot;Your Grace&quot;.
*A cardinal is addressed as &quot;Your Eminence&quot;.
*The Pope of the Roman Catholic Church is often addressed as &quot;Holy Father&quot; or &quot;Your Holiness&quot;.
In France, secular priests (diocesan priests) are addressed &quot;Monsieur l&#x27;Abbé&quot; or, if a parish priest, as &quot;Monsieur le Curé&quot;. In Germany and Austria priests are addressed as &quot;Hochwürden&quot; (meaning &quot;very worthy&quot;) or with their title of office (Herr Pfarrer, i.e. Mr. Parson). in Italy as &quot;Don&quot; followed by his name (e.g. &quot;Don Luigi Perrone&quot;).

Religious priests (members of religious orders) are addressed &quot;Father&quot; in all countries (Père, Pater, Padre etc.).

Up until the 19th century, secular clergy in English-speaking countries were usually addressed as &quot;Mister&quot; (which was, in those days, a title reserved for gentleman, those outside the gentry being called by name and surname only), and only priests in religious orders were formally called &quot;Father&quot;. In the early 19th century it became customary to call all priests &quot;Father&quot;.

In the Middle Ages, before the Reformation, secular priests were entitled as knights, with the prefix &quot;Sir&quot;. See examples in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays like Sir Christopher Urswick in Richard III. This is closer to the Italian and Spanish &quot;Don&quot; which derives from the Latin &quot;Dominus&quot; meaning &quot;Lord;&quot; in English, the prefix &quot;Dom&quot; is used for priests who are monks, a prefix which was spelled &quot;Dan&quot; in Middle English. The French &quot;Monsieur&quot; (like the German &quot;Mein Herr&quot;, the Italian &quot;Signor&quot; and the Spanish &quot;Señor&quot;) also signifies &quot;My Lord&quot;, a title commonly used in times past for any person of rank, clerical or lay.

The term &quot;minister&quot; is used by the Catholic Church in some cases, such as the head of the Franciscans being the Minister General.

In the Greek-Catholic Church, all clergy are called &quot;Father&quot;, including deacons, who are titled &quot;Father Deacon&quot;, &quot;Deacon Father&quot;, or simply &quot;Father&quot;. Depending on the institution, seminarians may be titled &quot;Brother&quot;, &quot;Brother Seminarian&quot;, &quot;Father Seminarian&quot; or simply &quot;Father&quot;. Their wives are usually addressed as &quot;presvytera&quot;, &quot;matushka&quot; or &quot;khourriyye&quot; as in the Orthodox world and also by their first names. Greek-Catholic Patriarchs are addressed as &quot;Your Beatitude&quot;. Eastern clergy are usually addressed by their Christian or ordination name, not their surname.

===Orthodox===

====Greek and other Orthodox churches====
The form of address for Orthodox clergy varies according to order, rank and level of education. The most common forms are the following:

====Armenian Apostolic====
The form of address to the clergy of the Armenian Apostolic Church (belongs to the family of Oriental Orthodox Churches) is almost the same.

<text>Carl August Bolle (sometimes also &quot;Karl Bolle&quot;) (21 November 1821, Schöneberg (Berlin) – 17 February 1909) was a German naturalist and collector.

Bolle was born at Berlin into a wealthy brewing family. He studied medicine and natural science at Berlin and Bonn. He visited the Cape Verde Islands and the Canary Islands in 1852 and 1856, and wrote &quot;Mein zweiter Beitrag zur Vogelkunde der Canarischen Inseln&quot; in 1857.

Bolle was a founder member of the Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft (German Ornithological Society) in 1867, succeeding Alfred Brehm as chairman in 1884.

The Bolle&#x27;s laurel pigeon (&quot;Columba bollii&quot;) of the Canary Islands was named after him by Frederick DuCane Godman.

He also made contributions as a botanist, especially in the field of dendrology. His herbarium was bequeathed to the Berlin-Dahlem Botanical Garden and Botanical Museum, although largely destroyed during World War II (1943). The plant genus &quot;Bollea&quot; (family Orchidaceae) was named in his honor, but is now called &quot;Pescatoria&quot;.

<text>The Marprelate Controversy was a war of pamphlets waged in England and Wales in 1588 and 1589, between a puritan writer who employed the pseudonym Martin Marprelate, and defenders of the Church of England which remained an established church.

==Character and reception==
Martin&#x27;s tracts are characterised by mockery of Anglican dignitaries and satire against the corruptions of the Church of England. The style is &#x27;a heady mixture of nonsense, satire, protest, irony and gossip&#x27;, combined with pungent wit, &#x27;full of the language of the street&#x27;. While Martin maintained puritan doctrines as a whole, the special point of his attack was the episcopacy. The pamphlets were printed at a secret press established by John Penry, a Welsh puritan, with the help of the printer Robert Waldegrave, about midsummer 1588, for the issue of puritan literature was forbidden by the authorities.

The first tract by &quot;Martin Marprelate,&quot; known as the &quot;Epistle&quot;, was printed at the home of Mistress Crane at East Molesey in October 1588. Born Elizabeth Hussey, Mistress Crane was the widow of Anthony Crane (d. 16 August 1583), Master of the Queen&#x27;s Household, and daughter of Sir Robert Hussey (d.1546), younger brother of John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford. The &quot;Epistle&quot; is an answer to &quot;A Defence of the Government established in the Church of Englande&quot;, by Dr John Bridges, Dean of Salisbury, itself a reply to earlier puritan works. Besides attacking the episcopal office in general, it assails certain prelates with much personal abuse. The &quot;Epistle&quot; attracted considerable notice and a reply was written by Thomas Cooper, Bishop of Winchester, under the title &quot;An Admonition to the People of England&quot;, but this was too long and too dull to appeal to the same class of readers as the Marprelate pamphlets, and produced little effect.

Penry&#x27;s press, removed in November to the home of Sir Richard Knightley at Fawsley, near Northampton, then produced a second tract by Martin, the &quot;Epitome&quot;, which contains more serious argument than the &quot;Epistle&quot; but is otherwise similar.

Shortly afterward the press was moved to the Whitefriars, Coventry, the home of Knightley&#x27;s great-nephew, John Hales (d. 1 January 1607/8), and his wife, Frideswide, the daughter of William Faunt. In late January 1589, Martin&#x27;s &quot;Certain Mineral and Metaphysical School-points&quot; was printed at the Whitefriars, followed in March by John Penry&#x27;s &quot;View of Some Part of Such Public Wants&quot;, and Martin&#x27;s &quot;Hay Any Work For Cooper&quot;, a reply to the &quot;Admonition&quot;. Hales, the son of Christopher Hales and Mary Lucy, daughter of William Lucy, esquire, of Charlecote, was the nephew and heir of John Hales (d.1572).

It now appeared to some of the ecclesiastical authorities that the only way to silence Martin was to have him attacked in his own railing style, and accordingly certain writers of ready wit, among them John Lyly, Thomas Nashe and Robert Greene, were secretly commissioned to answer the pamphlets. Among the productions of this group were &quot;Pappe with an Hatchet&quot; (Sept. 1589), probably by Lyly, and &quot;An Almond for a Parrat&quot; (1590), which, with certain tracts under the pseudonym of &quot;the renowned Cavaliero Pasquill&quot;, has been attributed to Nashe. Some anti-Martinist plays or shows (now lost) performed in 1589 were perhaps also their work.

Meanwhile, in July 1589, Penry&#x27;s press, now at Wolston, near Coventry, produced two tracts purporting to be by sons of Martin, but probably by Martin himself, namely, &quot;Theses Martinianae by Martin Junior&quot;, and &quot;The Just Censure of Martin Junior by Martin Senior&quot;. Shortly after this, &quot;More Work for Cooper&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Hay any Worke&quot;, was begun at Manchester, but while it was in progress the press was seized. Penry however was not found, and in September issued from Wolston or Haseley &quot;The Protestation of Martin Mar prelate&quot;, the last work of the series, though several of the anti-Martinist pamphlets appeared after this date. He then fled to Scotland, but was later apprehended in London, charged with inciting rebellion, and hanged (May 1593). The authorship of the tracts has been attributed to several persons: to Penry himself, who however emphatically denied it and whose acknowledged works have little resemblance in style to those of Martin; to Sir Michael Hicks (by the historian A.L. Rowse); to Henry Barrow; to Roger Williams; to George Carleton by Kathryn M. Longley and Patrick Collinson; and to the Warwickshire squire and Member of Parliament Job Throckmorton, whom most Marprelate scholars now believe was the primary author with the assistance of Penry.

<text>John Penry (1563 – 29 May 1593) was executed for high treason during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. He is Wales&#x27; most famous Protestant Separatist martyr.

==Early life==
Penry was born in Brecknockshire, Wales; Cefn Brith, a farm near Llangammarch, is traditionally recognised as his birthplace. His parents were Meredydd (Meredith) Penry and Eleanor (nee Godley). He matriculated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in December 1580, being then probably a Roman Catholic, but soon became a Protestant, with strong Puritan tendencies. Having graduated B.A., he moved to St Alban Hall, Oxford, and gained his M.A. in July 1586. He did not seek ordination, but was licensed as university preacher.

==Career==
There is not much evidence for his preaching tours in Wales; they could only have been made during a few months of 1586 or the autumn of 1587. In 1562 an act of Parliament had made provision for translating the Bible into Welsh, and the New Testament was issued in 1567; but the number printed would barely supply a copy for each parish church. Indignant at this failure, Penry published early in 1587 &quot;The Æquity of an Humble Supplication&quot; &quot;in the behalf of the country of Wales, that some order may be taken for the preaching of the Gospel among those people&quot;. Archbishop John Whitgift, angry at the implied criticism, had him brought before the High Commission and imprisoned for about a month.

On his release Penry married a lady of Northampton and lived there for some years. With the assistance of Sir Richard Knightley, he set up a printing press, which for nearly a year from Michaelmas 1588 was in active operation. It was successively located at East Moulsey (Surrey), Fawsley (Northamptonshire), Coventry and other places in Warwickshire, and finally at Manchester, where it was seized in August 1589. On it were printed Penry&#x27;s &quot;Exhortation to the governours and people of Wales, and View of... such publike wants and disorders as are in the service of God... in Wales&quot;; as well as the celebrated Martin Marprelate tracts.

In January 1590, his house at Northampton was searched and his papers seized, but he succeeded in escaping to Scotland. There he published several tracts, as well as a translation of a learned theological work known as &quot;Theses Genevenses&quot;.

==Return to England and death==
Returning to England in September 1592, he joined the separatist, or Brownist, congregation in London, in which he declined to take office, though after the arrest of ministers Francis Johnson and John Greenwood, he seems to have been the regular preacher. He was arrested in March 1593 following his recognition by the local vicar at Ratcliff and imprisoned in Poultry Compter while efforts were made to find some pretext for a capital charge.

Failing this a charge of sedition was based on the rough draft of a petition to Queen Elizabeth I that had been found among his private papers; the language was harsh and offensive, but had been neither presented nor published. He was convicted by the Queen&#x27;s Bench on 21 May 1593, and hanged at St Thomas-a-Watering on 29 May at the unusual hour of 4 p.m., without being granted permission to see his wife, Eleanor, or their four young daughters, Deliverance, Comfort, Safety and Sure-Hope before his death. The signature of his old enemy Whitgift was the first of those affixed to the death warrant.

<text>Blind Date is a 1987 American romantic comedy film directed by Blake Edwards and starring Bruce Willis (in his first credited lead role) and Kim Basinger. &quot;Blind Date&quot; earned mostly negative reviews from critics, but was a financial success and opened at number one at the box office.

==Plot==
Workaholic Walter Davis is under pressure to secure a deal for his employer to manage the vast assets of Japanese industrialist Yakamoto. Urgently needing a date for the dinner celebrating the deal, Walter&#x27;s brother Ted offers him a blind date with his wife Susie&#x27;s cousin Nadia. Ted and Susie warn Walter not to let Nadia drink alcohol as she loses control.

Walter meets Nadia, finding her beautiful, sweet, and charming, but her obsessive and jealous ex-boyfriend David attacks Walter. After evading David, Walter takes Nadia to a recording studio to listen to his friend, and reveals to Nadia that he gave up his dream of being a musician for the security of a steady job. Despite the earlier warnings, he gives a reluctant Nadia some champagne. 

At the dinner with Yakamoto, Nadia quickly loses her inhibitions and acts impulsively, calling out Walter&#x27;s colleague for attempting to seduce her, mocking a waiter for his condescending attitude, and inadvertently spraying Walter&#x27;s boss with champagne. Her actions draw the ire of Yakamoto who expects women to be quiet and subservient. After Nadia convinces Yakamoto&#x27;s meek wife to divorce him and take half his assets, the deal collapses and Walter is fired.

Walter tries to return Nadia home, but they are repeatedly intercepted by David in vain attempts to reunite with Nadia. Upset, Nadia runs off to a disco, followed by Walter, and the pair reconcile while dancing. David arrives and instigates a bar brawl, during which Walter and Nadia escape. She suggests going to a friend&#x27;s party but Walter insists on taking her to her home. When Walter arrives at the address Nadia provided, a truck tows the house away, his car is stripped of parts while he is distracted, and muggers accost him, hiding a gun in his car before fleeing as the police arrive. 

Nadia sobers up and expresses regret for her actions before Walter is forced to ram the pursuing David&#x27;s car off the road. Manic from the night&#x27;s events, Walter insists on taking Nadia to her friend&#x27;s party, where he embarasses her with his dishevelled appearance and erratic behaviour. David arrives and fights Walter until the latter finds the gun. He threatens David, but the police arrive and arrest the bloody and bruised Walter.

The following morning, Nadia bails Walter out of jail. Walter tells Nadia that he never wants to see her again, but Nadia reminds Walter that he gave her alcohol despite being warned. She laments that she thought he was someone with whom she could fall in love, having initially found him sweet and generous. Feeling remorseful and with Walter facing years of imprisonment, Nadia asks David, a defense lawyer, to represent him. David accepts in exchange for Nadia agreeing to marry him, to her disgust. David&#x27;s father, Judge Harold Bedford, despises his son, and agrees to declare Walter innocent if David relocates his life as far away as possible. Susie gives Walter a note from Nadia in which she says she will miss him and asks that he start playing the guitar again. 

As the wedding day approaches, Walter injects a box of chocolates with brandy and sends them to Nadia at David&#x27;s parents&#x27;s mansion, where the event will take place. Nadia unwittingly eats the chocolates, becomes inebriated, and disrupts the wedding, refusing to marry David because she is in love with someone else. Walter arrives and kisses Nadia, to the attendees&#x27;s joy and David&#x27;s ire.

Sometime later, Walter and Nadia honeymoon on a beach. He plays the guitar for her while a celebratory bottle of Coca-Cola chills in a champagne bucket.

==Cast==

==Production==
The film was originally intended for the recently married Madonna and Sean Penn, but both backed out after the project failed to attract a director. The project moved from Handmade Films to Blake Edwards, who agreed to direct contingent on script changes. The studio agreed and the movie was re-cast with Willis and Basinger. Filming took place between May 5 and July 14 1986 in Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Culver City.

Billy Vera &amp; The Beaters appear in the bar scene, playing several songs.

==Reception==
===Box office===

&quot;Blind Date&quot; was released in the United States and Canada on March 27, 1987. During its opening weekend it grossed a total of $7.5million from 1,251 theaters—an average of $6,020 per theater—making it the highest grossing film of the weekend, ahead of &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; ($5million), in its 4th weekend of release, and &quot;Platoon&quot; ($3.9million), in its fifteenth. In its second weekend, &quot;Blind Date&quot; fell to the number 2 position with a $5.7million gross, placing it behind the debuting &quot;Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol&quot; ($8.5million) and ahead of &quot;Platoon&quot; ($4.7million). It fell to the number 3 position in its third weekend with a $4.1million gross, behind &quot;Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol&quot; ($4.5million) and the debuting &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot; ($7.8million). &quot;Blind Date&quot; left the top-ten highest-grossing films after ten weeks.

In total, &quot;Blind Date&quot; grossed $39.3million, making it the 23rd-highest-grossing film of 1987 in the US and Canada.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 24%, based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 4.60/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Blind Date&quot; has all the ingredients for a successful madcap comedy, but the end results suggest director Blake Edwards has lost his once-reliable touch.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two and a half stars out of four and wrote: &quot;There are individual moments in this movie that are as funny as anything Edwards has ever done, but they&#x27;re mostly sight gags and don&#x27;t grow out of the characters. The characters, alas, are the problem. Willis plays a nerd so successfully that he fades into the shrubbery and never really makes us care about his fate. Basinger, so ravishing in most of her movies, looks dowdy this time. Her hair is always in her eyes, and her eyes are her best feature. [...] Most of the time I wasn&#x27;t laughing. But when I was laughing, I was genuinely laughing - there are some absolutely inspired moments.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; calls it &quot;essentially a running string of gags with snippets of catchy dialog in-between&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack to the motion picture was released by Rhino Records in 1987.

<text>The Little Humboldt River is a tributary of the Humboldt River, approximately long, in northern Nevada in the western United States. It flows through Paradise Valley and drains into the Humboldt River northeast of Winnemucca. It is an intermittent stream draining a rugged area on the edge of the Owyhee Desert in the Great Basin.

It rises in two forks in northern Nevada. The North Fork rises in northeastern Humboldt County, on the northeast end of the Santa Rosa Range, and flows intermittently to the ESE along the southeast edge of the Owyhee Desert. The South Fork (40 mi/64 km) rises in extreme western Elko County north of Jake Creek Mountain and generally flows WNW. The two forks join in eastern Humboldt County northeast of Winnemucca, with the combined stream flowing southwest along the east side of the Santa Rosa Range to join the Humboldt approximately northeast of Winnemucca. However, the surface waters of the Little Humboldt rarely reach the Humboldt River.

It is impounded to form Chimney Reservoir near the confluence of its forks in eastern Humboldt County. The river has recently been the subject of environmental controversies regarding charges of overgrazing on the federal lands surrounding the river.

<doc id="739281" wikidata="Q17033985" url="?curid=739281" title="List of Wainwrights">
<text>Wainwrights are the 214 English peaks (known locally as &quot;fells&quot;) described in Alfred Wainwright&#x27;s seven-volume &quot;Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells&quot; (1955–66). They all lie within the boundary of the Lake District National Park in Cumbria, and all but one (Castle Crag) are over in height. Over two million copies of the &quot;Pictorial Guides&quot; have been sold since their publication. In 1974, Wainwright published a supplementary volume &quot;The Outlying Fells of Lakeland&quot; (1974), which includes another 116 summits (described in 56 walks); these are the Wainwright Outlying Fells.

Summiting all of the Wainwrights is a popular form of peak bagging in the Lake District, along with the Birketts. Because both lists are based on historical books, unlike, for example, the Munros, their constituents remain fixed, regardless of revisions to height or other metrics. In this regard, they are similar to the Scottish lowlands, Donalds. There are 214 Wainwrights, of which 209 are also classed as one of the 541 Birketts. Wainwrights cover a wide range of heights, from major mountains such as the highest Wainwright, Scafell Pike at , to Castle Crag, the smallest Wainwright at . Wainwright did not state any rules about what should be included in his guides, choosing instead to note his walks according to his favour and their relevance in the landscape, never himself considering the summiting of all of them to be an important accomplishment for others.

The Long Distance Walkers Association (&quot;LDWA&quot;) holds a register of walkers who wish it to be recorded that they have completed the Wainwrights. The first recorded continuous round of all 214 Wainwrights was completed by Alan Heaton between 29 June and 8 July 1985 starting and finishing at Keswick Moot Hall, with a total time of 9 days and 16 hours. Joss Naylor completed the round in 7 days in 1986 and held the record until 20 June 2014 when Steve Birkinshaw completed the round in 6 days and 13 hours, involving 320 miles (515 km) and 118,000 ft (36,000m) of ascent. Birkinshaw published an account of his run as &quot;There is No Map in Hell: The Record-Breaking Run Across the Lake District Fells&quot; (2017, Vertebrate Publishing: ). Birkinshaw&#x27;s record was broken on 20 June 2019 when Paul Tierney completed the round in 6 days 6 hours 4 minutes. On 12 to 17 June 2021, Sabrina Verjee set a new record of 5 days, 23 hours and 49 minutes. The current record was set by John Kelly on 2 to 7 May 2022 with a time of 5 days, 12 hours and 14 minutes.

==Wainwrights by height==

This list is from the &quot;Database of British and Irish Hills&quot; (&quot;DoBIH&quot;) in October 2018, and are peaks the DoBIH marks as being Wainwrights (&quot;W&quot;). DoBIH also updates the measurements as surveys are recorded, so these tables should not be amended unless the entire DoBIH data is re-downloaded; these measurements may differ slightly from the &quot;By Book&quot; section, which are from older sources.

==Wainwright Outlying Fells by height==

This list is from the &quot;Database of British and Irish Hills&quot; (&quot;DoBIH&quot;) in October 2018, and are peaks the DoBIH marks as being Wainwright Outlying Fells (&quot;WO&quot;). DoBIH also updates the measurements as surveys are recorded, so these tables should not be amended unless the entire DoBIH data is re-downloaded; these measurements may differ slightly from the &quot;By Book&quot; section, which are from older sources. It was noted in 2023 that the list had been created erroneously, giving incorrect prominence figures for non-Birkett fells. This was corrected in April 2024, and a few updates to heights added from DoBIH.

<text>The Village (marketed as M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s The Village) is a 2004 American period thriller film written, produced, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It stars Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, and Brendan Gleeson. The story is about a village whose population lives in fear of creatures inhabiting the woods beyond it.

&quot;The Village&quot; received mixed reviews and grossed $256.7 million worldwide. James Newton Howard was nominated for Best Original Score at the 77th Academy Awards.

==Plot==
In 19th-century Pennsylvania, a small, remote village lives in fear of nameless humanoid-creatures that inhabit the surrounding woods. Staffed watchtowers and tall poles with oil lamps line the village perimeter for protection. The color red is banned, as it attracts the creatures.

Following a young villager&#x27;s death due to illness, Lucius Hunt requests, and is denied, the elders&#x27; permission to travel through the woods and retrieve medical supplies from &quot;the towns&quot; to avoid similar tragedies. Later, Lucius&#x27;s widowed mother, Alice, questions his wanting to visit &quot;the towns,&quot; which the elders describe as wicked.

The elders appear to have secrets, and each keeps a locked black box containing unknown items. It is learned that as long as villagers avoid the woods, the creatures stay away. Lucius secretly ventures into the woods, though he later tells the elders and claims it was safe. Soon after, skinned animal carcasses appear in the village. One night, the creatures enter the village, leaving red paint splashes on people&#x27;s doors as a warning.

Elder Edward Walker&#x27;s daughter, Kitty, is attracted to Lucius, but he loves Ivy, Kitty&#x27;s visually impaired younger sister. Kitty later marries someone else, which allows Ivy and Lucius to become betrothed. Before they can marry, Noah Percy, a young man with an apparent developmental disability, stabs Lucius out of jealousy, seriously wounding him. As the elders consider Noah&#x27;s fate, he remains locked in a small building.

Edward defies the other elders by sending Ivy, accompanied by two young males, through the forest to retrieve medicine for Lucius, who clings to life. Before Ivy leaves, Edward tells her about his wealthy father&#x27;s murder. He then admits the creatures are actually the elders disguised as the monsters to perpetuate the legend and scare and deter younger members from leaving. He also tells her that folklore suggests that such creatures may truly exist. In the woods, the two boys become frightened and abandon Ivy. She continues on alone and is stalked by a creature, which she tricks into fatally falling into a deep hole as it attacks. The creature is Noah wearing a costume he found hidden under the floorboards. Meanwhile, Edward and his wife, Tabitha, unlock their box, which contains photos of themselves and the other elders when they were much younger. The group is standing outside a modern-day counseling center, revealing that it is actually the late 20th or early 21st century.

Ivy climbs over a high wall. On the other side, she encounters a Walker Wildlife Reserve park ranger, who is shocked that she came from the woods. Ivy gives him a list of medicines she must acquire. The ranger gathers the medication without telling his supervisor, nor does he mention Ivy.

It is learned that Edward Walker, a former history professor, founded the village over two decades earlier. He recruited people he met at a grief counseling clinic to isolate themselves from societal violence. Edward&#x27;s family fortune funds the wildlife reserve, built the village inside it, and even paid the government to make it a no-fly zone.

Ivy returns to the village with the medication, never seeing the modern world. The elders&#x27; boxes are shown to contain mementos and other items from their earlier lives; their voices are heard recalling past traumas. The elders gather around Lucius&#x27;s bed after learning that Ivy has returned and that a monster (Noah) was killed. Edward comforts Noah&#x27;s grieving parents by saying that his death will enable them to continue the farce that creatures inhabit the woods.

==Production==
The film was originally titled &quot;The Woods&quot;, but the name was changed because a film in production by director Lucky McKee, &quot;The Woods&quot; (2006), already had that title. Like other Shyamalan productions, this film had high levels of secrecy surrounding it, to protect the expected twist ending that became a Shyamalan trademark. Despite that, the script was stolen over a year before the film was released, prompting many &quot;pre-reviews&quot; of the film on several Internet film sites and much fan speculation about plot details. 
The village set in the film was built in its entirety in one field outside Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania. An adjacent field contained an on-location temporary sound stage. Production on the film started in October 2003, with delays because some scenes needing fall foliage could not be shot because of a late fall season. Principal photography was wrapped up in mid-December of that year. In April and May 2004, several of the lead actors were called back to the set. Reports noted that this seemed to have something to do with a change to the film&#x27;s ending, and, in fact, the film&#x27;s final ending differs from the ending in a stolen version of the script that surfaced a year earlier; the script version ends after Ivy climbs over the wall and gets help from a truck driver, while the film version has Ivy meeting a park ranger and scenes where she returns to the village.

==Music==
===Soundtrack===
The film&#x27;s score was composed by James Newton Howard, and features solo violinist Hilary Hahn. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score, but lost to &quot;Finding Neverland&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;The Village&quot; made $50.7 million during its opening weekend. The film grossed $114 million in the U.S., and $142 million in international markets. Its worldwide box office totalled $256 million, the tenth highest grossing PG-13 movie of 2004.

===Critical response===

On Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator website, the film has an approval rating of 44% based on 222 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The site&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Village&quot; is appropriately creepy, but Shyamalan&#x27;s signature twist ending disappoints.&quot; At Metacritic, the film holds a score of 44 out of 100 based on 40 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on scale of A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film one star and wrote: &quot;&quot;The Village&quot; is a colossal miscalculation, a movie based on a premise that cannot support it, a premise so transparent it would be laughable were the movie not so deadly solemn ... To call the ending an anticlimax would be an insult not only to climaxes but to prefixes. It&#x27;s a crummy secret, about one step up the ladder of narrative originality from &quot;It was all a dream&quot;. It&#x27;s so witless, in fact, that when we do discover the secret, we want to rewind the film so we don&#x27;t know the secret anymore.&quot; Ebert named the film the tenth worst film of 2004 and subsequently put it on his &quot;Most Hated&quot; list. There were also comments that the film, while raising questions about conformity in a time of &quot;evil,&quot; did little to &quot;confront&quot; those themes. &quot;Slate&quot;&#x27;s Michael Agger commented that Shyamalan was continuing in a pattern of making &quot;sealed-off movies that [fall] apart when exposed to outside logic.&quot;

The movie had a number of admirers. Critic Jeffrey Westhoff commented that though the film had its shortcomings, these did not necessarily render it a bad movie, and that &quot;Shyamalan&#x27;s orchestration of mood and terror is as adroit as ever.&quot; Philip Horne of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in a later review noted &quot;this exquisitely crafted allegory of American soul-searching seems to have been widely misunderstood.&quot;

The film has received some additional positive reviews since its release including Emily St. James of &quot;Vox&quot; and Chris Evangelista of &quot;SlashFilm&quot; who thought it was one of Shyamalan&#x27;s best films, Adam Chitwood of &quot;Collider&quot; who praised the ending, the performances of Howard, Phoenix, and Hurt, and the cinematography, and Kayleigh Donaldson of &quot;Syfy Wire&quot; who praised the cinematography, and said, &quot;...[the film] stands as one of the strongest representations of Shyamalan’s ethos, for better or worse.&quot; Carlos Morales of &quot;IGN&quot; argued that the film was misunderstood at the time of its release because it was mismarketed as a horror film, and also because of audience expectations that had been built up by Shyamalan&#x27;s three previous films. &quot;The real twist was that the movie they wanted wasn&#x27;t the one Shyamalan made.&quot;

In France, the &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; praised the movie, putting it in second place (tie) in their 2004 annual top list. Some other French film critics shared their enthusiasm, such as &quot;Le Monde&quot;, which described the film as a &quot;horrific post-9/11 fable&quot;, &quot;a political film disguised as fantasy, a work of great beauty shot through with primal anxieties and universal aspirations&quot;. But the general reception of the film remains mixed: &quot;Libération&quot; called it a &quot;Jansenist turnip&quot;, which &quot;pretends to worry about the isolationism of its ass-benitent heroes, but shows above all that it understands their fears and feels sympathy for them&quot;; and &quot;Télérama&quot; described the filmmaker as &quot;once again taking himself for Hitchcock&quot;.

===Plagiarism allegation===
Simon &amp; Schuster, publishers of the 1995 young adult book &quot;Running Out of Time&quot; by Margaret Peterson Haddix, claimed that the film had taken ideas from the book. The plot of Shyamalan&#x27;s movie had several similarities to the book. They both involve a 19th-century village, which is actually a park in the present day, have young heroines on a search for medical supplies, and both have adult leaders bent on keeping the children in their village from discovering the truth.

No lawsuit was ever filed over the similarity.

<text>Donald Stovel Macdonald (1 March 1932 – 14 October 2018) was a Canadian lawyer, politician and diplomat. Macdonald was a long-time Liberal party Member of Parliament and Cabinet minister. In the early 1980s, he headed a royal commission (the Macdonald Commission) which recommended that Canada enter a free trade agreement with the United States.

==Early life and education==
Macdonald was born in Ottawa, Ontario. He graduated from the University of Trinity College in the University of Toronto in 1952. He subsequently attended Harvard Law School (LLM), as well as the University of Cambridge in England (Diploma in International Law).

==Political career==
He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1962 election as the Liberal Member of Parliament for the Rosedale riding in Toronto. In 1967, he was the parliamentary secretary of Paul Martin, Secretary of State for External Affairs. He joined the Cabinet of Pierre Trudeau in 1968 and served successively as President of the Privy Council, Minister of National Defence, Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources and Minister of Finance. As Finance Minister, Macdonald introduced tougher Employment insurance rules in his 1976 budget, and wage and price controls in an attempt to control inflation in his 1977 budget.

Macdonald resigned from Cabinet in 1977 to return to his law practice. When Pierre Trudeau announced his resignation as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada following his defeat in the 1979 election, Macdonald would have declared his candidacy for the position. However, with the unexpected defeat of Joe Clark&#x27;s Progressive Conservative government on a motion of no confidence, the Liberals asked Trudeau to lead them into the 1980 election and cancelled the leadership campaign. Macdonald was not a candidate for the party leadership when Trudeau resigned again in 1984.

==Subsequent career==
In 1982, Prime Minister Trudeau appointed Macdonald as chairman of a Royal Commission on the Economic Union and Development Prospects for Canada (the Macdonald Commission). The report was released in September 1985 and recommended, among other things, that Canada enter into a free trade agreement with the United States. Progressive Conservative Brian Mulroney was Prime Minister by this time. He accepted the recommendation and pursued what became the Canada–US Free Trade Agreement.

Macdonald was appointed High Commissioner of Canada to the United Kingdom in 1988. He held that position until 1991, when he returned to his law practice in Toronto. He is also a past member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.

==Honours and awards==
In 1994, Macdonald was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. He received honorary degrees from the Colorado School of Mines, the University of New Brunswick, Carleton University, and the University of Toronto (Doctor of Sacred Letters, Trinity College, University of Toronto).

==Personal life==
Macdonald married Ruth Hutchison (dec.) in 1961, and their four daughters are Leigh, Nikki, Althea, and Sonja. Nikki Macdonald served as a senior advisor to Jean Chrétien during his time as Prime Minister.

In 1988, he married Adrian Merchant Lang, the daughter of Sally Merchant. From her prior marriage to Otto Lang, she had seven children: Maria (d. 1991), Timothy Lang, Gregory, Andrew, Elisabeth, Adrian, and Amanda Lang. They have fifteen grandchildren.

Macdonald died at his home in Toronto on October 14, 2018.

<text>Tenskwatawa (; also called Tenskatawa, Tenskwatawah, Tensquatawa or Lalawethika) (January 1775 – November 1836) was a Native American religious and political leader of the Shawnee tribe, known as the Prophet or the Shawnee Prophet. He was a younger brother of Tecumseh, a leader of the Shawnee. In his early years Tenskwatawa was given the name Lalawethika (&quot;He Makes a Loud Noise&quot; or &quot;The Noise Maker&quot;), but he changed it around 1805 and transformed himself from a hapless, alcoholic youth into an influential spiritual leader. Tenskwatawa denounced the Americans, calling them the offspring of the Evil Spirit, and led a purification movement that promoted unity among the Indigenous peoples of North America, rejected acculturation to the American way of life, and encouraged his followers to pursue traditional ways.

In the early 1800s, Tenskwatawa formed a community with his followers near Greenville in western Ohio, and in 1808 he and Tecumseh established a village that the Americans called Prophetstown north of present-day Lafayette, Indiana. At Prophetstown, the brothers&#x27; pan-American Indian resistance movement increased to include thousands of followers, and Tenskwatawa provided the spiritual foundation. Together, they mobilized the American Indians in the Northwest Territory to fight the Americans, and they remained resolute in their rejection of American authority and acculturation.

On November 7, 1811, while Tecumseh was away, Tenskwatawa ordered the pre-dawn attack on a hostile, encroaching American military force encamped near Prophetstown that initiated the Battle of Tippecanoe. The American Indians retreated after a two-hour engagement and abandoned Prophetstown, which the Americans burned to the ground. The battle did not end the American Indians&#x27; resistance against the United States, but the Prophet lost his influence, became an outcast, and moved to Canada during the War of 1812. After Tecumseh was killed at the Battle of the Thames in 1813, the American Indian resistance movement faltered and was eventually defeated. Tenskwatawa remained as an exile in Canada for nearly a decade. He returned to the United States in 1824 to assist the U.S. government with the Shawnee removal to reservation land in present-day Kansas. The aging Prophet arrived at the Shawnee reservation in 1828 and faded into obscurity. Tenskwatawa died at what is known as the Argentine district of present-day Kansas City, Kansas, in 1836.

==Early life and family==
Lalawethika (&quot;He Makes a Loud Noise&quot; or &quot;Noise Maker&quot;), who as an adult changed his name to Tenskwatawa (&quot;Open Door&quot; or &quot;One With Open Mouth&quot;), was one of a set of triplet brothers born in early 1775 to Puckeshinwa and Methoataske in a Shawnee village along the Mad River in western Ohio. One of the triplets died within the first year of his birth, but Tenskwatawa and his surviving triplet, Kumskaukau, were members of a family that included at least eight children (three daughters and five sons). Lalawethika&#x27;s early years showed no evidence of the powerful spiritual leader he would become as an adult. Instead, his sad and isolated youth was marked by numerous failures and alcoholism.

Tenskwatawa&#x27;s father, Puckenshinwa (&quot;Something That Falls&quot;), was a leader of the Kispokotha division of the Shawnee tribe. He was killed fighting against the Virginia militia in the Battle of Point Pleasant before Tenskwatawa was born. His mother, Methoataske (or Methoataaskee, meaning &quot;[One who] Lays Eggs in the Sand&quot;), is believed to be either Muscogee Creek, Cherokee, or Shawnee, possibly of Pekowi division and the Turtle Clan. Methoataske, who was frightened by the American Revolution and deeply saddened by the death of Puckenshinwa, may have gone to live with her Creek relatives and then moved west with the Kispokothas in 1779, leaving Tenskwatawa and his siblings in the care of their older sister, Tecumpeas, who was married.

Tenskwatawa, who was not as successful or brave as his brothers, was a failure &quot;at almost everything he attempted&quot; during his youth. When Chiksika, his oldest brother and a leading warrior, took his brothers out to hunt and fight in small battles, Tenskwatawa stayed behind because he lacked competence as a skilled hunter and warrior. Tenskwatawa was never able to distinguish himself as a hunter or fighter as Tecumseh, another of his older brothers. Tecumseh, who was seven years older, was an especially gifted athlete who became the favorite of most of the tribe. In contrast, Tenskwatawa was isolated, unpopular, and depressed by his lack of success. He began drinking alcohol, which further lowered his self-esteem and increased his problems. He also blinded himself in his right eye with his own arrow when he was younger. Lonely and insecure, Tenskwatawa attempted to make up for his deficiencies by boasting and making up stories about how talented and important he was. His depression and alcoholism worsened as he grew older, making him unable to provide for his wife and several children.

In 1794, nineteen-year-old Tenskwatawa was present at the Battle of Fallen Timbers with two of his brothers, Tecumseh and Sauwauseekau, but he did not distinguish himself as a warrior. Instead, Tenskwatawa viewed the battle as a chance to re-insert himself into tribal society. In his late twenties, he decided to become a medicine man and apprenticed with a tribal healer, Penagashea (&quot;Changing Feathers&quot;). However, when Tenskawatawa was unable to save his people after they fell seriously ill, probably with influenza, he became humiliated and even more depressed. By the early 1800s, Tenskawatawa had developed a reputation as a notorious drunk among the Shawnee living along the White River.

==Purification movement leader==
In 1795, after the Battle of Fallen Timbers, the Indians of the Old Northwest signed the Treaty of Greenville with the American government, in which they agreed to surrender most of modern Ohio. In return, the American government promised to allow them to retain the remainder of the Northwest Territory forever. After 1803, however, the main official in the Northwest, William Henry Harrison, began pressuring the tribes of the Old Northwest to cede more land west of the Greenville line. President Thomas Jefferson and Harrison tried to pressure the tribes into adopting Euro-American customs, especially European-style farming. They hoped that such acculturation would make the tribes more willing to cede additional land but also believed that they could force the tribes into acculturating by pressuring them to cede more of their remaining territory. To this end, Jefferson encouraged American officials in the Northwest to deliberately entrap the tribes of the region in debt to force them to cede land. Many established chiefs, such as Black Hoof and Little Turtle, encouraged their followers to adopt European customs and tried to maintain good relations with the American government. After 1803, Harrison convinced some pro-accommodation chiefs to cede large areas of land west of the Greenville line. The American government paid for these cessions with annuities, which it placed under the control of the pro-accommodation chiefs. Many Indians saw these payments as bribes to the pro-accommodation chiefs.

These land cessions were also controversial because the American government generally paid the tribes far less than the market price of the land which it acquired. Moreover, Harrison often bought land from tribes which had relatively weak claims to it, while ignoring the stronger claims of other tribes. Meanwhile, Euro-American settlers rapidly moved onto the lands which the tribes of the Old Northwest had not yet ceded. Many settlers sold alcohol to the tribes, contributing to a growing problem of drunkenness. The land cessions, along with these trends, contributed to growing discontent among the tribes of the Old Northwest and gradually undermined the authority of the pro-accommodation chiefs. The stage was thus set for the emergence of a nativist movement.

Beginning in 1805, Lalawethika had a series of religious visions that transformed his life, caused him to change his name to Tenskwatawa (meaning &quot;Open Door&quot;), and led him to reject his old ways. He experienced his first vision in May 1805, when he fell into unconsciousness during one of his alcoholic stupors and was thought to be dead. Unexpectedly reviving as his body was being prepared for burial, he recounted a powerful vision of two different worlds, one filled with ample blessings for the virtuous ones who lived as the master of life intended, while the other world was filled with pain, hardship, and terror for those who refused to follow traditional tribal ways. Tenskwatawa became known as &quot;The Prophet,&quot; began preaching and gathered a growing number of followers. He soon emerged as a powerful and influential spiritual leader. More visions followed in succeeding months, including revelations that the European invaders from the east were &quot;the children of the evil spirit.&quot;.

The Prophet&#x27;s developing purification movement caused him to urge his followers to reject European habits, such as consumption of alcohol, and to return to their traditional ways. He wanted his people to reject the white man&#x27;s customs by forbidding marriages between Indians and whites, as well as the use of Euro-American foods, clothing, and manufactured goods. Tenskwatawa also encouraged his people to follow traditional gender roles (women as farmers, men as hunters and warriors). Tenskwatawa proved to be harsh, even brutal, in his treatment of those who opposed him and his teachings. He accused his detractors, and anyone who associated with settlers, of witchcraft, including Indians who had converted to Christianity. For Tenskwatawa, Indian witches remained the most active agents of the evil spirits on earth, and he sought to identify and destroy them.

==Greenville and Prophetstown founder==
In 1805, Tenskwatawa, who evolved into an effective speaker and charismatic leader of his religious movement, formed a new community with his followers along the White River, near the present site of Greenville in western Ohio. Harrison, the governor of Indiana Territory, derided Tenskwatawa as a fraud. He wrote a letter to the Delawares urging them to challenge Tenskwatawa to &quot;cause the sun to stand still ... or the dead to rise from their graves&quot;, adding that &quot;If he does these things you may then believe that he has been sent by God.&quot; He also had the letter printed in a major newspaper. Tenskwatawa responded by correctly predicting that an eclipse would occur on June 16, 1806. This prediction strengthened his credibility and humiliated Harrison 

The Prophet detested the leaders of the United States government, including Jefferson and Harrison. Tenskwatawa also opposed some tribal leaders, such as Little Turtle, and their representatives because he felt that they had agreed to the demands of the government. When some of the tribal chiefs tried to promote compromise and conciliation with the United States, Tenskwatawa, proclaiming his obedience to the Great Spirit, lashed out against the pro-U.S. sympathizers and castigated them as wicked traitors.

While the Prophet continued to preach unity among his people, urging them to resist the government and the settlers&#x27; way of life, Tecumseh began to gather the tribes at Greenville to establish a pan-Indian resistance movement. Officials in Ohio became concerned about the increasing numbers of the Prophet&#x27;s followers. As the settlers became more hostile and planned to take action, Tenskwatawa was finding it increasingly difficult to feed his expanding village. Although there was opposition from some tribal leaders such as Little Turtle, Tenskwatawa decided to move farther west and establish a village in a more remote location to further distance his followers from the settlers.

In 1808, Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh founded a new village along the Tippecanoe River, north of present-day Lafayette, Indiana. The settlers called the Indian village Prophetstown, after the Shawnee spiritual leader. Prophetstown soon expanded into a large, multi-tribal community of the Prophet&#x27;s followers that became a &quot;powerful Indian city-state&quot; for his spiritual movement. Willig (1997) argues that Prophetstown became the largest Native American community in the Great Lakes region and served as a major center of Indian culture, a temporary barrier to the encroaching settlers&#x27; westward movement, and a base to expel the whites and their culture from the territory. Located near the juncture of two rivers, the Wabash and Tippecanoe Rivers, Prophetstown gained significance as a central point in the political and military alliance that was forming around Tecumseh, as well as the spiritual hub of the purification movement that the Prophet established to preserve tribal culture.

Under the leadership of Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh, the village attracted thousands of Algonquin-speaking Indians. Although the village endured hardships, such as food shortages, epidemics, and tribal disagreements, Prophetstown became an intertribal, religious stronghold within the Indiana Territory for 3,000 Native Americans. An estimated 14 different tribal groups comprised the confederation at Prophetstown, but the majority of its inhabitants came from Shawnee, Delaware, and Potawatomi tribes. The growing community also caused settlers in the area to fear that Tecumseh was forming an army of warriors to destroy their settlements. There were also some Tutelo as well.

One effect of the increasing pan-Indian alliance was steady pressure from Harrison and the U.S. government to establish land-cession treaties, including a pivotal one made in 1809. Under the terms of the Treaty of Fort Wayne, the tribes in the Wabash River area ceded an estimated 2.5 to 3 million acres of land to the U.S. government. While warriors continued to congregate at Prophetstown, Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh, who adamantly wanted to retain their independence from the United States, denounced the treaty. They became openly hostile to those who had signed it, including other tribal leaders, and began discussions of a possible alliance with the British.

==War with the United States==


Although historians have disagreed over whether Tecumseh or Tenskwatawa was the primary leader of the pan-Indian community that grew up around Prophetstown, Tenskwatawa remained its spiritual leader; however, his preaching grew more militant and increasingly political from 1808 to 1811. Some of Prophetstown&#x27;s inhabitants became nervous about the rising tension between settlers and natives and left the village, but Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa continued to recruit young warriors to join their movement. By 1811, white settlers in the region, Harrison, and the Indiana territorial government had become concerned about the large number of Indians gathering at Prophetstown. After ongoing negotiations between Harrison and Tecumseh proved unproductive in 1811, Harrison decided to strike first and began to assemble his military forces.

In the fall of 1811, when Tecumseh journeyed south to meet with representatives of other tribes in hopes of building a larger alliance, Tenskwatawa was left in command at Prophetstown. Before Tecumseh&#x27;s departure, the two brothers discussed possible responses to U.S. military action and agreed that Tenskwatawa would try to avoid any confrontation during Tecumseh&#x27;s absence. However, Tenskwatawa reconsidered the decision after Tecumseh&#x27;s departure and prepared their warriors to fight the settlers if they approached Prophetstown. In the meantime, Harrison and his men began their march north from Vincennes toward Prophetstown and constructed a new fort (Fort Harrison) on Indian treaty land at the site of present-day Terre Haute, Indiana, to serve as a staging area for their military forces. As Harrison&#x27;s army marched toward Prophetstown, Tenskwatawa decided to stand firm and take action.

On November 6, 1811, while Tecumseh was still in the South, a United States military force of an estimated 1,000 men under Harrison&#x27;s command approached the village. Hoping to delay a confrontation until additional warriors arrived, Tenskwatawa requested a meeting with Harrison, who agreed to negotiate. With the meeting set for the following day, Harrison and his men set up camp about a mile from Prophetstown.

Although they were slightly outnumbered and had little ammunition, Tenskwatawa&#x27;s force of 600 to 700 men attacked before dawn on November 7. This attack failed, and during the evening Tenskwatawa consulted with the spirits and decided that sending a party to assassinate Harrison in his tent was the best way to avoid a battle. He assured the warriors that he would cast spells that would make them immune to their bullets and any other harm as well as confuse Harrison&#x27;s army so they would not resist. The warriors moved out and began to surround Harrison&#x27;s army, looking for a way to enter the camp undetected. After a two-hour engagement that became known as the Battle of Tippecanoe, Tenskwatawa&#x27;s forces retreated from the field and abandoned Prophetstown to avoid capture. On November 8, Harrison&#x27;s army burned the village to the ground. Nearly one-fifth of Harrison&#x27;s forces either died or were wounded in battle (according to one source, 188 casualties; 63 of them fatalities). Harrison claimed hundreds of Indian fatalities; however, the actual number fell, according to another source, between thirty and fifty, with an additional seventy to eighty wounded. Tenskwatawa, who did not take part in the action on the field, remained out of range of U.S. bullets.

The battle did not end the Indians&#x27; resistance to the United States, but their retreat caused the Prophet, who proved to be a poor military leader, to lose his influence. Some of the Indians wanted to kill him for losing, but he survived; others sought revenge by raiding area farms and travelers. When Tecumseh returned to the Indiana Territory, he resumed his role as the Indian confederation&#x27;s military leader, but the loss at Prophetstown ended his efforts to establish a stronger Indian alliance. Tenskwatawa became an outcast, and some of his followers returned to rebuild Prophetstown in July 1812, but settler militia forces eventually forced them away. The Prophet moved to Canada and became one of Tecumseh&#x27;s subordinates during the War of 1812.

The end of the Indians&#x27; military resistance to the U.S. occurred in Canada, where Tecumseh and his warriors participated in the defence of the Canadian colonies. Tecumseh fought and died at the Battle of the Thames in October 1813. Tenskwatawa, who observed the battle from a position behind the British line, fled on horseback after the initial charge from the American forces. He remained in exile in Canada and did not return to the United States until 1824.

==Later years==
After Tecumseh&#x27;s death in 1813, Tenskwatawa retained a small group of followers, but had no significant leadership position among the American Indians in the subsequent decade. In 1824, at the request of Lewis Cass, the governor of Michigan Territory, the aging Prophet returned to the United States to assist the federal government with its plans for the Shawnee removal west of the Mississippi River. Tenskwatawa hoped his involvement would allow him to regain some influence as a leader among the Shawnee.

In 1826, Tenskwatawa traveled through Vincennes with a group of 500 Shawnee from reservation land at Wapaghkonetta, Ohio, and headed west across the Mississippi and Kansas Rivers to the Shawnee reservation in present-day Kansas. Tenskwatawa, who arrived in Kansas on May 14, 1828, established a village called Prophetstown on reservation land in the Argentine district of present-day Kansas City, Kansas.

In his final years, as his influence among the Shawnee declined, Tenskwatawa isolated himself from the majority of the tribe. A few years before his death, Tenskwatawa agreed to pose for George Catlin, who painted his portrait as a Shawnee &quot;holy man&quot; in traditional attire. Tenskwatawa departed to Kansas and lived there in obscurity for twelve years until his death.

==Death and legacy==
Tenskwatawa died in November 1836 at his cabin, a site in present-day Kansas City&#x27;s Argentine district. The White Feather Spring historical marker, erected in 1978, denotes the approximate location of his gravesite in Kansas City, which remained unmarked for decades. Tenskwatawa&#x27;s legacy was a mix of successes and failures. While he became a powerful spiritual leader with hundreds of followers in the first decade of the 20th century, his success in that effort only lasted about six years. The Prophet transformed himself from a hapless, alcoholic youth filled with failures into an influential religious leader. Tenskwatawa preached unity and helped to improve the morale of his people by encouraging them to pursue traditional ways. He also remained resolute in his rejection from his family and of the United States authority and acculturation to the Euro-American way of life. After the defeat of his people at the Battle of Tippecanoe, the Prophet spent the remainder of his life trying to regain some of his previous political power. Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh along with their followers were not successful in achieving the long-term results they wanted. They lost a difficult and violent struggle that deprived them of their lands in the Northwest Territory, largely because of the relentlessness and large-scale efforts of the United States, but their defiance was a noble effort.

Because most white Americans of his era were unfamiliar with Native American culture, they did not understand the Prophet&#x27;s religious movement. Since his death in 1836, the Prophet has been relegated to a secondary role. Those who knew Tenskwatawa after 1825, when he no longer had his previous influence as a religious leader, described him as a &quot;shallow opportunist.&quot; However, it was Tenskwatawa, not Tecumseh, who provided the spiritual foundation for the Indian resistance movement in the Midwest in the years immediately preceding the War of 1812. In the Indiana Territory, the violence that erupted between the U.S. and the pan-Indian alliance that Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh established at Prophetstown led to the relocation of territorial capital from Vincennes to Corydon, Indiana. In addition, U.S. efforts to remove Indian inhabitants from the Indiana Territory increased after the War of 1812 and led to their forced removal to reservations in the trans-Mississippi west.

<text>Baiju Noyan or Baichu (; Chagatai: بایجو نویان; ; in European sources: Bayothnoy; ) was a Mongol commander in Persia, Armenia, Anatolia and Georgia. He was appointed by Ögedei Khan to succeed Chormagan. He was the last direct imperial governor of the Mongol Near East; after his death Hulagu&#x27;s descendants inherited domains he once commanded.

== Background ==
Baiju belonged to Besut tribe of Mongols and was a relative of Jebe. His father was a mingghan commander under Genghis Khan and he inherited this contingent upon his death.

== Career ==
Baiju was a second-in-command of Chormaqan and took part in an attack on Jalal ad-Din near Isfahan in 1228. After Chormaqan&#x27;s paralysis in 1241, Baiju took over his troops and became a tümen commander by appointment of Ögedei Khan. After Ögedei&#x27;s death, Baiju started to take orders from Batu, former&#x27;s nephew. Baiju immediately moved against the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm, weakening its power at the Battle of Köse Dağ on 26 June 1243. After this battle, the Sultanate became a vassal state of the Mongol Empire and was forced to release David VII Ulu. Baiju demanded the submission of Principality of Antioch too in 1244. He made a raid on Abbasid Caliphate in 1245. He also led Mongol tumens to raid Syria in 1246.

He received ambassadors from Pope Innocent IV in 1247. Embassy was headed by Ascelin of Lombardy and found him at Sisian, on 24 May 1247. Embassy&#x27;s disrespect and Ascelin&#x27;s refusal to triple genuflection angered Baiju, he insulted the pope and demanded his submission as well. Ascelin left for Rome on 24 July 1247. Meanwhile he was replaced by new khagan Güyük with Eljigidei. His next two attempts to invade the Abbasid Caliphate in Iraq met less success in 1249–50. He again rose to prominence as Eljigidei and his entire family were purged by Batu for his opposition to election of Möngke Khan in 1251.

Under Baiju in the 1240s and 1250s, the Mongols retained their power in what is roughly modern-day Iran, and tolerated the independence of the Sultanate, Georgia, and petty states in Iran as clients, interfering with dynastic succession and extracting tribute militarily as necessary. However, the Abbasids in Baghdad and the Assassins in the Elbruz mountains maintained their independence until the coming of Hülegü, Möngke&#x27;s brother, in 1255. Baiju was supposedly reproached by Hulegu for failing to extend Mongol power further, and, indeed, was replaced by him as supreme commander as early as 1255, but served under him ably in further campaigns: against the Sultanate of Rum (to extract tribute and replace the sultan Kaykavus II) in 1256, in the assault on Baghdad in 1258, and in the advance on Syria towards Egypt in September 1259. 

It is unclear what happened to Baiju after that: when the Mongol force was heavily depleted by the departure of Hülegü in 1260, the force that remained was commanded by Kitbuqa. According to various sources Baiju was executed by Hülegü after the capture of Baghdad due to his hesitation to join Hulagu during the campaign and his secret correspondence with Caliph Al-Musta&#x27;sim.

== Portrayal in media ==

* 2015–2016 — Portrayed by Barış Bağcı in Turkish historical drama series &quot;Diriliş: Ertuğrul&quot; where he was referred to as Noyan, although Noyan was traditionally implemented as a Mongol military title.

<text>In medicine, specifically gastroenterology, the Child–Pugh score (or the Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) score or Child Criteria) is used to assess the prognosis of chronic liver disease, mainly cirrhosis. Although it was originally used to predict mortality during surgery, it is now used to determine the prognosis, as well as the required strength of treatment and the necessity of liver transplantation.

==Scoring==
The score employs five clinical measures of liver disease. Each measure is scored 1–3, with 3 indicating most severe derangement.

Either the prothrombin time or INR should be used to calculate the Child–Pugh score, not both. 
In primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), some use a modified Child–Pugh score where the bilirubin references are changed to reflect the fact that these diseases feature high conjugated bilirubin levels. The upper limit for 1 point is 68 μmol/L (4 mg/dL) and the upper limit for 2 points is 170 μmol/L (10 mg/dL).

==Interpretation==
Chronic liver disease is classified into Child–Pugh class A to C, employing the added score from above.

==Related scoring systems==
*MELD Score
* MELD-Plus

==History==
The surgeon and portal hypertension expert Charles Gardner Child (1908–1991) (with Turcotte) of the University of Michigan first proposed the scoring system in 1964 in a textbook on liver disease. It was modified by Pugh et al. in 1972 in a report on surgical treatment of bleeding from esophageal varices. They replaced Child&#x27;s criterion of nutritional status with the prothrombin time or INR, and assigned scores of 1–3 to each variable.

<text>The title Earl of Bolingbroke has been created twice, once in the Peerage of England and once in the Jacobite Peerage.
==Initial creation==
The creation in the Peerage of England occurred on 28 December 1624, when Oliver St John, 4th Baron St John of Bletso, was created Earl of Bolingbroke. His eldest son and heir apparent, Oliver St John, was in 1641 summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron St John of Bletsoe. However, he predeceased his father (killed at the Battle of Edgehill in 1642); nevertheless, the writ of acceleration means that he is formally known as the fifth Baron St John of Bletsoe. The Earl was succeeded by his grandson, Oliver St John, 2nd Earl of Bolingbroke, who was the son of Sir Paulet St John, younger son of the first Earl. The 2nd Earl died childless in 1688 and was succeeded by his younger brother, Paulet St John, 3rd Earl of Bolingbroke, who represented Bedford in the House of Commons. He never married, and on his death, on 5 October 1711, the earldom became extinct.

== List of Earls of Bolingbroke (1st creation) ==
* Oliver St John, 1st Earl of Bolingbroke, 4th Baron St John of Bletso (–1646)
** Oliver St John, 5th Baron St John of Bletso (1603–1642) (by writ of acceleration)
* Oliver St John, 2nd Earl of Bolingbroke, 6th Baron St John of Bletso (before 1634–1688)
* Paulet St John, 3rd Earl of Bolingbroke, 7th Baron St John of Bletso (1634–1711)

==Second creation==
The creation in the Jacobite Peerage occurred on 26 July 1715 when Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke, was created Earl of Bolingbroke by the Old Pretender, this title not being recognised by the British Government, although Bolingbroke returned from exile, was pardoned, and briefly returned to royal favour. He died on 12 December 1751, aged 73, his second wife having predeceased him by one year, and the Jacobite earldom became extinct. Bolingbroke and his wife were both buried in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Battersea, where a monument with medallions and inscriptions composed by Bolingbroke was erected to their memory. Bolingbroke&#x27;s great-nephew Frederick St John, succeeded him in the viscountcy.

<doc id="739304" wikidata="Q3430663" url="?curid=739304" title="Richard Cox (bishop)">
<text>Richard Cox (c. 1500 – 22 July 1581) was an English clergyman, who was Dean of Westminster and Bishop of Ely.

==Early life==
Cox was born of obscure parentage at Whaddon, Buckinghamshire, in 1499 or 1500.

He was educated at the Benedictine Snelshall Priory near Whaddon, at Eton, and at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1524. At Cardinal Wolsey&#x27;s invitation he became a member of the Cardinal&#x27;s new foundation at Oxford, was incorporated B.A. in 1525, and created M.A. in 1526. In 1530 he was engaged in persuading the more unruly members of the university to approve of the King&#x27;s divorce.

A premature expression of Lutheran views is said to have caused his departure from Oxford and even his imprisonment, but the records are silent on these sufferings which do not harmonise with his appointment as Master of the Royal Foundation at Eton.

In 1533 he appears as the author of an ode on the coronation of Anne Boleyn, in 1535 he graduated B.D. (Bachelor of Divinity) at Cambridge, proceeding D.D. (Doctor of Divinity) in 1537, and in the same year subscribing the &quot;Institution of a Christian Man&quot;. In 1540 he was one of the fifteen divines to whom were referred crucial questions on the sacraments and the seat of authority in the Church; his answers (printed in Pocock&#x27;s &quot;Burnet&quot;, iii. 443–496) indicate a mind tending away from Catholicism, but susceptible to &quot;The King&#x27;s Doctrine&quot;; and, indeed, Cox was one of the divines by whom Henry said the &quot;King&#x27;s Book&quot; had been drawn up when he wished to impress upon the Regent Arran that it was not exclusively his own doing. Moreover, he was present at the examination of Robert Barnes, subscribed the divorce of Anne of Cleves, and in that year of reaction became Archdeacon and Prebendary of Ely and Canon of Westminster.

He was employed on other royal business in 1541, was nominated to the projected Bishopric of Southwell, and was made King&#x27;s Chaplain in 1542. In 1543 he was employed to ferret out the &quot;Prebendaries&#x27; Plot&quot; against Thomas Cranmer, and became the Archbishop&#x27;s chancellor. In December, he was appointed Dean of Oseney (afterwards Christ Church) Oxford, and in July was made Almoner to Prince Edward, in whose education he took an active part. He was present at Edward Crome&#x27;s recantation in 1546, denounced it as insincere and insufficient, and severely handled him before the Privy Council.

==Under Edward VI==
After Edward VI&#x27;s accession, Cox&#x27;s opinions took a more Protestant turn, and he became one of the most active agents of the Reformation. He was consulted on the compilation of the Communion Office in 1548, and the first and second Books of Common Prayer, and sat on the Commission for the Reform of the Canon Law. As Chancellor of the University of Oxford (1547–1552) he promoted foreign divines such as Pietro Martire Vermigli, and was a moving spirit of the two commissions which sought with some success to eradicate everything savouring of popery from the books, manuscripts, ornaments and endowments of the university, and earned Cox the sobriquet of its &#x27;Canceller&#x27; rather than its Chancellor.

He received other rewards, a canonry of Windsor (1548), the rectory of Harrow (1547) and the deanery of Westminster (1549).

==Marian exile==
Cox lost his preferments on Mary&#x27;s accession, and was for a fortnight in August 1553 confined to the Marshalsea. He remained in obscurity until after the failure of Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion, and then in May 1554 escaped in the same ship as Edwin Sandys, to Antwerp. In March 1555 he made his way to Frankfurt.

Cox played a major part in what later became known as the troubles at Frankfurt. The exiles had, under the influence of John Knox and William Whittingham, adopted Calvinistic doctrine and a form of service far from the Prayer Book of 1552. Cox stood up for the Church of England service, and the exiles were divided into Knoxians and Coxians. Knox attacked Cox as a pluralist, Cox accused Knox of treason to the Emperor Charles V. The latter proved more effective as a charge: Knox and his followers were expelled, and the Prayer Book of 1552 was restored.

==Under Elizabeth I==
In 1559 Cox returned to England, and was elected Bishop of Norwich, but the Queen changed her mind and Cox&#x27;s destination to Ely, where he remained for twenty-one years. He was an honest, but narrow-minded ecclesiastic, who held what views he did hold intolerantly, and was always wanting more power to constrain those who differed from him (see his letter in &quot;Hatfield MSS.&quot; i. 308). While he refused to minister in the Queen&#x27;s Chapel because of the crucifix and lights there, and was a bitter enemy of the Roman Catholics, he had little more patience with the Puritans. He was grasping, or at least tenacious of his rights in money matters, and was often brought into conflict with courtiers who coveted episcopal lands.

The Queen herself intervened, when he refused to grant Ely House to her favourite, Sir Christopher Hatton; but the well-known letter beginning &quot;Proud Prelate&quot; and threatening to unfrock him seems to be an impudent forgery which first saw the light in the &quot;Annual Register&quot; for 1761. It hardly, however, misrepresents the Queen&#x27;s meaning, and Cox was forced to give way. These and other trials led him to resign his see in 1580, and it is significant that it remained vacant for nineteen years.

==Death and legacy==
Cox died in July 1581; a monument erected to his memory twenty years later in Ely Cathedral was defaced, owing, it was said, to his evil repute. John Strype (&quot;Whitgift&quot;, i. 2) gives Cox&#x27;s hot temper and marriage as reasons why he was not made archbishop in 1583 in preference to John Whitgift, who had been his chaplain; but Cox had been dead two years in 1583. His first wife&#x27;s name is unknown; she was the mother of his five children, of whom Joanna married John Parker, the eldest son of Archbishop Matthew Parker. His second wife was Jane Auder, the widow of William Turner, the botanist and Dean of Wells Cathedral. One of his grandsons, Richard, moved to Ireland in about 1600, and was the ancestor of the Cox Baronets of Dunmanway, County Cork.

<text>Barr Beacon is a hill on the edge of Walsall, West Midlands, England, very near the border with Birmingham. It gives its name to nearby Great Barr (the Beacon borders the Pheasey area of Great Barr) and to the local secondary school Barr Beacon School. It is historically the site of a beacon where fires were lit in times of impending attack or on celebratory occasions. The site is on green belt land and is of local importance for nature conservation, as defined by Walsall Borough Council, who have designated some 60 acres (25 ha) of it as a Local Nature Reserve.

==Ownership and management==

Barr Beacon was formerly owned by the Scott family of Great Barr Hall, nearby. Following the death of Lady Mildred Scott in 1909, the estate was auctioned off in 1918. Birmingham&#x27;s Lord Mayor made a plea for the site to be secured as a public park. Colonel J. H. Wilkinson of the Staffordshire Volunteer Infantry Brigade responded by purchasing it, then transferring it to a trust. It opened to the public on Easter Monday, 21 April 1919. In 1972, the trusteeship of Barr Beacon passed to Walsall Council. The council now manages Barr Beacon on behalf of the Barr Beacon Trust., with a management committee comprising local councillors and representatives of interest groups. During both 2002 and 2003 the site attracted an estimated 200,000 visitors.

==Views==
As one of the highest points in the West Midlands county, Barr Beacon has panoramic views. According to the Walsall Council website, visible landmarks include The Wrekin, Cannock Chase, the Lickey Hills, Lichfield Cathedral, Aldridge Airport, and Birmingham city centre, and at least eleven counties are visible, including Powys in Wales.

== Memorial ==

On one summit is Barr Beacon Reservoir, a South Staffordshire Waterworks Company covered drinking water reservoir with radio masts and on the other a war memorial consisting of a raised dais, covered by a copper-clad wooden dome supported by eight columns. On the night of 5 March 2010, thieves stole some of the copper roofing, damaging much more in the process; this happened again twice in 2011. In early 2013, the copper sheeting was replaced using green zinc-coated panels, and CCTV was installed.

<text>The Owyhee Desert ecoregion, within the deserts and xeric shrublands biome, is in the Northwestern United States. The Owyhee Uplands Byway passes through the desert.

==Geography==
An arid region of canyons, volcanic rock, sagebrush and grass makes up the ~ Owyhee Desert.

The desert is in northern Nevada, southwestern Idaho and southeastern Oregon. It is located on the south edge of the Columbia Plateau southwest of Boise, Idaho, stretching east from the Santa Rosa Range. It has a mean elevation of approximately . The Owyhee Desert is primarily drained by the tributaries of the Bruneau River and Owyhee Rivers, which then flow into the Snake River.

==Management==
Most of the land in the desert is owned by the federal government and managed by the Bureau of Land Management. It is largely used as ranch land.

In 1999, the Desert Group submitted an alternative for Owyhee resource management.

<doc id="739312" wikidata="Q1511130" url="?curid=739312" title="Jesse H. Jones">
<text>Jesse Holman Jones (April 5, 1874June 1, 1956) was an American Democratic politician and entrepreneur from Houston, Texas. Jones managed a Tennessee tobacco factory at age fourteen, and at nineteen, he was put in charge of his uncle&#x27;s lumberyards. Five years later, after his uncle, M. T. Jones, died, Jones moved to Houston to manage his uncle&#x27;s estate and opened a lumberyard company, which grew quickly. During this period, Jesse opened his own business, the South Texas Lumber Company. He also began to expand into real estate, commercial building, and banking. His commercial building activities in Houston included mid-rise and skyscraper office buildings, hotels and apartments, and movie theaters. He constructed the Foster Building, home to the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, in exchange for a fifty percent share in the newspaper, of which he acquired control in 1926.

Jones&#x27;s participation in civic life and politics began with the Port of Houston and the Houston Ship Channel. He led a group of local bankers in buying public finance bonds and was later appointed to serve as the Chair of the Houston Harbor Board. He led a local fundraising effort on behalf of the American Red Cross in support of servicemen in World War I. President Wilson tapped Jones to head a division of American Red Cross, a duty he fulfilled between 1917 and 1919. In 1928, he initiated and organized Houston&#x27;s bid for the 1928 Democratic National Convention.

Jones most important role was in the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) (1932–1939), a federal agency originally created in the Herbert Hoover administration which played a major role in combating the Great Depression and financing industrial expansion during World War II. After Hoover first appointed Jones to the board, President Franklin D. Roosevelt expanded the powers of the RFC and promoted Jones to the chairmanship in 1933. Jones was in charge of spending US$50 billion, especially in financing railways and building munitions factories. He served as the United States secretary of commerce from 1940 to 1945, a post he held concurrently with his chairmanship of the RFC. With the combined authority of these various federal posts, Jones was arguably the second most powerful person in the nation, which is confirmed by Roosevelt&#x27;s nickname for him, &quot;Jesus Jones&quot;.

After leaving Washington, Jesse and Mary Jones focused on philanthropy, working through the Houston Endowment, a non-profit corporation they founded in 1937. Though most of this giving was focused on Texas, some of it flowed to Tennessee and Massachusetts. Much of their philanthropy concentrated on education, including large gifts for a business school at Texas Southern University and another to establish Jones College at Rice University. However, they also made substantial donations to hospitals and for the arts. Many buildings in Houston are named for Jesse Jones, including a music venue in downtown Houston known as Jones Hall.

==Family history and early life==
Jesse H. Jones descended from Welsh ancestors who made Virginia their first landing place in North America, sometime in the 1650s. After settling there briefly, they relocated to the Chowan River in North Carolina, remaining there for at least a century. In 1774, Eli Jones and one of his brothers, headed west, eventually deciding to an area now known as Robertson County, Tennessee. William, one of Eli&#x27;s sons, established himself as a farmer there, and married a neighboring farmer&#x27;s daughter, Laura Anna Holman. The farm was sufficient to provide for all of the needs of the family and grow tobacco for sale, partly from their own efforts, and partly from the work of enslaved persons.

Jesse Holman Jones was born to William and Laura Jones on April 5, 1874, the fourth of five children. Jesse&#x27;s mother died on April 22, 1880, just after he had turned six. Nancy Jones Hurt, his aunt, moved in with the family along with her two sons. She was a &quot;guide, physician, and clothes-maker of all the Jones children,&quot; and &quot;a famous cook&quot;. Sudley Place was his childhood home.

In 1883, the Jones family, including Aunt Nancy and seven children moved to Dallas, Texas, partly in order for William to join his brother Martin Tilton &quot;M.T.&quot; Jones in his successful lumber enterprise. Several years earlier M.T. had resettled his family in Terrell, Texas after a stop in Illinois. Aunt Nancy remained in Dallas and enrolled the children in local public schools, while William moved to Terrell to manage the M.T. Jones Lumber Company and look after the firm&#x27;s other lumberyards in northeast Texas. This allowed M.T. to move closer to his timberlands and other interests in southeast Texas. However, William only stayed for two years and returned with his large family to Robertson County, where he acquired a new farm to work. So Jesse was back in Tennessee at the age of twelve. The new estate of William Jones included 600 acres, and the patriarch built a spacious brick house with ten rooms to accommodate his large family. According to one biographer, this house was &quot;the finest outside of Nashville.&quot; Later in life, Jesse recollected that the family farm was bountiful, providing enough meat and produce to leave a surplus through all seasons. They even shared food with less fortunate neighbors who struggled during the winter months, Jones recalled.

Jesse had been a diligent worker as a boy, caring for the farm animals, and performing many common household chores. During the summers when his family had lived in Dallaswhen he was a young teenagerhe hacked out weeds, picked cotton, and herded cattle. He did not display the same diligence for school, and later, Jesse recalled many scoldings and punishments from his teachers. His father challenged his two sons with a tobacco plot for each of them. He allotted three acres to each son and provided them both with supplies. Each of them would be allowed to keep any profits after they repaid their store accounts. He applied this experience to a job in the tobacco industry when he quit school after the eighth grade. William Jones not only grew tobacco, but also traded the crop, and he also joined a partnership, Jones, Holman and Armstrong, which processed tobacco. William put Jesse in charge of one of the tobacco factories. He was responsible for receiving (or sometimes rejecting), classifying, warehousing, and shipping tobacco. In addition, his name was on the company bank account, and he signed checks for the company&#x27;s operations.

At the age of seventeen, Jesse and his family returned to Dallas. After several attempts to find a suitable job in Dallas and the surrounding region, Jesse started working in Hillsboro, Texas, at one of his uncle&#x27;s lumberyards. He performed manual labor, but also served the office side of the business, such as bookkeeping and debt collection. Despite these varied duties, he earned the standard salary for a salesman: $40 per month. He requested a fifty percent raise, arguing that he worked day and night. His uncle refused. Jesse quit not long before the death of his father, William Jones. The will instructed that trustees manage the tobacco enterprise, while Jesse would assume control at age twenty-one. He also inherited about $2,000 in stock.

==Business activities==
===Timber and lumber===

Jesse and his brother liquidated the tobacco inventory from their father&#x27;s estate and spent the proceeds on their sisters&#x27; homes. Jesse returned to Dallas and applied for a position with the M.T. Jones Lumber Company&#x27;s downtown yard on Main Street and St. Paul. M. T. refused to hire him, leading Jones to wonder if his former supervisor in Hillsboro had reported unfavorably on him. An investigation of the Hillsboro yard, however, revealed that its manager had committed fraud. The general manager of the company, C. T. Harris, fired that manager and hired Jesse as bookkeeper for the big Dallas yard. Initially, Jesse earned a salary of $15 per weekmore than he made at the Hillsboro yard. After just six months, Harris made Jesse the manager there, raising his salary to $100 per month (). Harris made these decisions without consulting M.T., the owner of the company. Jesse ran the Dallas yard profitably, even in the face of eight competitors in the local market. In 1895, with M.T. still critical of the Dallas operations, Jesse tendered his resignation. However, M.T. audited the books of the Dallas yard and found them to be in good order. M.T. asked Jesse to retract his resignation. Jesse replied that he would take his old job back for $150 per week and six percent of the profits. M.T. agreed to Jesse&#x27;s terms.

While Jesse was still managing a lumber yard in Dallas for M.T. Jones, he decided on a financial gambit while competing for the lumber trade related to the 1897 Texas State Fair in Dallas. The association running the State Fair needed construction supplies for buildings and exhibits, but the lumber companies wanted personal guarantees from the directors. Jesse, sensing an opportunity, decided to stand out from his competitors: he extended credit to the State Fair Association, with only the backing of gate receipts. When M.T. found out about the terms of the loans and the full extent of Jesse&#x27;s gamble, he began to investigate Jesse&#x27;s activities and interrogated him about his decision. These loans were repaid quickly and the Dallas lumber yard profited from the play.

Despite these confrontations between M.T. and Jesse, by 1898, it was apparent that Jesse had earned his uncle&#x27;s trust. M.T. died that year and his will named Jesse as general manager of his substantial lumber business. The will also designated Jesse as one of five executors of his estate. He arrived in Houston in 1898, renting a room at the old Rice Hotel for $2.25 per night (). He was then responsible for the business affairs of his Aunt Louisa and his three cousins. Jesse managed a large estate:

He was now in charge of tens of thousands of acres of timberland spread over three east Texas counties and parts of Louisiana. The estate owned and operated sawmills and factories in Orange that had the daily capacity to turn hundreds of thousands of feet of raw timber into shingles, doors, windows sashes, and two-by-fours. The logistics was equally huge: felled trees had to be moved to plants, and finished products had to be delivered to lumberyards located throughout the state and beyond. With assistance and advice from trustees, Jones bought, sold, and managed the land, expanding the M.T. Jones Lumber Company even further.

In 1902, Jones started the South Texas Lumber Company. He had money he had earned from selling investments in timber and some Spindletop deals for capital. He acquired the Reynolds Lumber Company, as well as many other lumberyards in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. The company charter announced an intention to purchase raw goods (lumber), semi-finished goods (cross ties), and milled goods, such as blinds, doors, and sash. According to his own recollection, he made about $1 million in profits when he sold controlling interest in the company, liquidating most of his interests in one saw mill and perhaps 20 or more lumberyards. Other than retaining a single lumberyard, he permanently left active management of the timber and lumber business in 1911 or 1912.

===Construction and real estate===

Jones began a flurry of building activity in 1906. He contracted to build an addition to the Bristol Hotel, committing $90,000 () to the project, which would include a rooftop garden and dance floor. He also commissioned a ten-story building for the Texas Company (Texaco), and the company moved its headquarters to Houston in 1916. The same year, he constructed a new plant for the rapidly growing &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; in exchange for a half-interest in the company, which had been solely owned by Marcellus Foster. 

Jones led an effort to mitigate a local bank panic in 1907. The failure of the T. W. House Bank failed that year. As the longest established financier in Houston leading one of the oldest local banks, the House Bank collapse triggered a local liquidity crisis. Jones himself was indebted to the bank for $500,000. Jones repaid the loan early by borrowing from lines of credit on New York banks. 

In 1911, Jones purchased the original five-story Rice Hotel from Rice University although the university retained the land on which it stood. Working with Captain James A. Baker, the president of Rice Institute&#x27;s Board of Trustees, he razed the original structures and constructed the seventeen-story building, which he then leased from Rice. The new Rice Hotel leased 500 rooms, and was the center of Houston social life.

After concluding his service with the Red Cross, Jones returned to Houston and resumed his business activities. He amassed lots along the Main Street corridor in downtown Houston, acquired a tract on Elm Street in Dallas, and also invested in Fort Worth. In 1921, he expanded one downtown Houston structure into the Bankers Mortgage Building, while laying out plans for two more ten-story buildings. During this time he continued a collaboration with local architect Alfred C. Finn, with whom he had first worked on the Rice Hotel. Jones juggled his Houston program with a development initiative in New York City, and he built the Melba Theater in Dallas.

In the mid-1920s, Jones increased his construction and development activity. Two new buildings, the Kirby Theater and the Kirby Lumber Company Building went up on Main Street, while he built additions to the Rice Hotel and the Houston Electric Building. During the same period he started projects in Manhattan. The first was an apartment building on 1158 Fifth Avenue at 97th Street, followed by the Mayfair House on Park Avenue at 67th Street. A third building at 200 Madison Avenue faced J.P. Morgan&#x27;s home, with four floors leased to the first Marshall Field&#x27;s store in New York City. Jones also left his mark on Fort Worth, building the Medical Arts Building, and the Worth Hotel and Worth Theater.

In addition to his real estate and political activity associated with Houston&#x27;s Democratic National Convention, Jones continued multiple development projects in 1928 in other cities. He commissioned an eighteen-story, mixed-use building in downtown Fort Worth, leasing the storefront and two more floors to the Fair Department Store. He sited a sixteen-story medical office building on 61st Street as just one of his projects in New York. Back in Houston, several projects were under construction with no connection to the convention. Jones broke ground on the Gulf Building that year, while completing the Levy Brothers Department Store. The Gulf Building was completed the next year as the tallest structure in Houston, a distinction it held until 1963. He finished another retail building on Main Street, a four-story store for Krupp and Tuffly Shoes. He acquired his fourth hotel, a distressed sixteen-story building which he re-branded as the Texas State Hotel. Jones built in New York a 44-story office tower at 275 Madison Avenue and 40th Street, his largest project to date. He completed it in the spring prior to the Stock Market Crash of 1929.

===Banking===

As a young man, Jones found opportunities to borrow money in order to establish credit. He borrowed in excess of his need, and kept the extra cash in a savings account. However, at least two Houston bankers expressed concerns about his borrowing practices. By his own estimate, he had borrowed as much as $3 million (). The test came with the Panic of 1907. One of the largest and oldest of Houston&#x27;s banks, the T. W. House Bank, failed amidst this economic recession. The bank had a $500,000 () loan on its books in the name of Jesse Jones. Yet even during the bank panic, Jones was able to sell enough mortgage paper and draw on enough credit from other banks to repay the loan. So he stood ready to make new investments after the worst of the recession ended.

Sometime after 1908, Jones organized the Texas Trust Company. By 1912, he had become president of Houston&#x27;s National Bank of Commerce. This bank later merged with Texas National Bank in 1964 to become the Texas National Bank of Commerce, renamed to Texas Commerce Bank which grew into a major regional financial institution. It became part of JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. in 2008.

In 1931 two local banks were in danger of failing. Public National Bank faced a clientele demanding cash and Houston National Bank had too many distressed loans. Public National Bank had barely enough cash on hand to last through Saturday, October 24. The next day, Jones hosted a meeting of local bankers at his office in the new Gulf Building. He urged his banking colleagues to assist in stabilizing the two distressed banks to prevent a general panic among local depositors. Jones proposed a bailout plan of $1.25 million () to guarantee local deposits at risk, with the political support of a major local bank investor, James A. Baker. Despite a faction of bankers who wanted to let the two banks fail, Jones and Baker prevailed, with Jones buying out Public National Bank, Joseph Meyers Interests buying out Houston National Bank, and a consortium of banks and utility companies all contributing to the bailout fund. Customers of Public National Bank gained access to their accounts on October 26.

===Publishing===

Jones acquired his fifty-percent interest in the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; from Marcellus Elliot Foster in August 1906. Though Foster was the paper&#x27;s editor, Jones&#x27;s engagement in the paper&#x27;s positions was evident by the letters between the two men. For example, Jones supported Foster&#x27;s public opposition to the Ku Klux Klan, which had been a growing movement in Texas after World War I. Foster stressed his editorial independence, while Jones vowed that he was willing to risk financial loss and personal safety to side against the KKK. This relationship became strained in 1925 when Jones voiced his opposition to Foster&#x27;s support of Miriam Ferguson for governor of Texas. They were in agreement with her strong stance against the Klan, but Jones refused to support her candidacy because of the corruption of her husband during his tenure as governor.

In 1926, Jones became the sole owner of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; and named himself as publisher. At the time of the purchase, the paper had a daily readership of 75,000 and the company was valued at $2.5 million (). When Jones opened the Gulf Building in Houston, his ownership of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; facilitated publication of a 48-page special insert dedicated to his new skyscraper. In March 1930, Jones acquired a radio station and began broadcasting in Houston from the Rice Hotel. The call letters of the station, KTRH, used three letters as an acronym for The Rice Hotel. KTRH broadcast some content of the Columbia Broadcasting System, making it the second radio station in Houston to air national programs. Jones established the station to support the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, which had already seen the &quot;Houston Post&quot; establish a radio affiliate, KPRC.

==Political activities==
===Houston Ship Channel===

Jones helped to secure funding for the Houston Ship Channel. When bond sales for the Harris County Houston Ship Channel District lagged, he met with Houston bankers and extracted a pledge from each one to buy the district&#x27;s bonds proportionate to their market capitalizations. He was appointed as chair of the new Houston Harbor Board in 1913 by Mayor Ben Campbell. Jones accepted this post after rejecting several offers from the Woodrow Wilson Administration the same year. Edward Mandell House, who advocated Wilson&#x27;s nomination for the Democratic Party the previous year, suggested Jones for service to the new US President. The Wilson Administration offered positions to Jones such as the undersecretary of the treasury, two ambassadorships, and most notably, secretary of commerce. Jones confronted Mayor Campbell and other interests in regard to a wharf at Manchester, which was at that time outside the city limits. Campbell advocated spending $300,000 of Houston Harbor District revenue to construct a wharf for a local cement manufacturer. Jones opposed this expenditure, and resigned from the board with other directors when the city approved the project.

===American Red Cross===

From 1917 until the end of World War II, Jones dedicated his activities to the nation, spending more time in the federal capital than in his home town. He responded to World War I demands by leading a fundraising effort in Houston for the American Red Cross. Sixteen of his friends accepted his challenge to donate $5,000 each (), spurring the local effort to meet and exceed its fundraising quota. President Wilson asked Jones to become director general of military relief for the American Red Cross during World War I, a position he held until 1919. During his first post in Washington, D.C., his department was responsible for seven hundred Red Cross canteens and 55,000 volunteers, organization and transportation of mobile hospitals to England and France, and distribution of clothing to persons in war-torn Europe, and tendering financial assistance to families of American servicemen.,

Jones worked in an office building facing the White House, and eventually he had personal access to the president. During the coordination of Red Cross parades in various American cities, he asked that the president make a speech on the day of the parade in New York City to support fundraising efforts. Wilson was reticent and had not made an oral public address since his declaration of war against Germany. Jones, per Wilson&#x27;s request, appointed Cleveland Dodge as the presiding officer of the event, though Jones also directed Dodge to choose a venue suitable for a presidential address. On the day of the parade, President Wilson made an impromptu speech to a full Metropolitan Opera House, which included his justification for war against Germany, lauded the work of the American Red Cross, admonished Wall Street bankers against wartime profiteering, and offered an entreaty to Americans to donate money to the Red Cross.

===1928 Democratic National Convention===
On his own initiative, Jones tendered a $200,000 bid () to bring the 1928 Democratic National Convention to Houston. Other cities matched or exceeded this amount, but Jones vowed that Houston would beat the others in hospitality. When Jones returned to Texas from Washington, D.C., where he had been negotiating, local greeters mobbed the train depots in Marshall, Texas and Conroe, with a few brandishing &quot;Jesse Jones for President&quot; signs. At Union Station, 50,000 Houstonians staged a homecoming for Jones, replete with marching bands, bunting, and banners. They staged a parade from Union Station to the Jones home at the Lamar Hotel. This hero&#x27;s welcome preceded the decision by the Democratic Convention to select a site, though Walter Lippman and the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; predicted that Houston would be chosen.

===Reconstruction Finance Corporation===

After President Hoover signed the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) bill in 1932, the Republican chose Jones as one of the three to serve on its first board of directors, and managed Defense Plant Corporation. When Hoover sought advice from ranking Democrats about candidates for the board, Jones was the sole recommendation of House Speaker John Nance Garner. The Hoover RFC was an ambitious program. Upon opening, the RFC had 300 staff positions available. Soon it conveyed hundreds of millions in loans, including $300 million () to the railroads, $90 million to prop up the Chicago bank of Charles Dawes, and $65 million to Bank of America. However, Hoover sold the RFC as a program to assist smaller institutions. Bank of America retired its loan with the RFC, paying interest and principal within two years. Other loans were not successful. Jones opposed a loan to the Missouri Pacific, concerned that the taxpayers would be stuck with their bill. Without Jones&#x27;s support, the RFC board approved $23 million for the railroad, but it did not prevent the company from failing the next year.

In 1933, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt made him the Chairman of the RFC, while also expanding the RFC&#x27;s powers to make loans and bail out banks. This led some to refer to Jones as &quot;the fourth branch of government.&quot; The next year, Congress issued an additional $850 in loans, after which President Roosevelt intimated to Jones that he would have the authority to invest the new appropriations and reinvest revenue from loan repayments.

Jones criticized Hoover&#x27;s execution of the RFC as too little and too late. Congress and the new president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, created a new Emergency Banking Act on March 9, 1933. President Roosevelt announced a &quot;bank holiday,&quot; a moratorium on banking activity while federal bank inspectors examined the books in order to determine which financial institutions were viable. After the bank holiday, all financially sound banks would resume business. For persons who were unable to access their accounts, another part of the act authorized the executive branch to reorganize failed banks in order to free up frozen assets. The RFC was empowered to invest financial institution through their preferred stocks. Seventy percent of America&#x27;s banks reopened after just six days. Jones&#x27;s task as the new chair of the RFC was to reopen another 2,000 banks. He began with the reorganization of two of Detroit&#x27;s largest banks by collaborating with Alfred P. Sloan of General Motors. They formed a new bank with matching investments from the RFC and General Motors, but more significantly, the RFC covered the deposits of the 800,000 frozen accounts from both failed banks with a loan of $230 million ().

In the first three years of the Roosevelt Administration, the RFC had issued $8 billion in loans; however, these outflows were offset by $3.5 billion in revenues, including interest payments and repayments of principal. In 1939, Roosevelt appointed Jones to be the new Federal Loan Administrator while taking away his title as RFC chair.

===Secretary of Commerce===
President Woodrow Wilson offered Jones the position of United States secretary of commerce, but Jones decided instead to remain in Houston and focus on his businesses. He accepted the same position from President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940, and he served until 1945. However, according to Stephen Fenberg, Roosevelt offered him the cabinet position to bring him closer to the White House and rein in his power. This tactic did not work because Jones accepted the new post while retaining his old job as Federal Loan Administrator. Jones was also on a short list to serve as Roosevelt&#x27;s running mate in 1940. Though the nomination for the vice-presidency had been decided by the Democratic convention delegates in previous election cycles, the decisions at the 1940 convention in Chicago were being manipulated by the president. Roosevelt rejected Jones as a running mate because he considered him to be too conservative to properly serve his agenda.

===Exit from Washington===
Henry Wallace was dropped from the ticket as vice president in 1944. Roosevelt was reelected and asked Jones to resign as secretary of commerce, which he did on January 21, 1945. The next day he resigned from RFC and all other government positions. Jones released the two letters to several newspapers, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The letters criticized Roosevelt&#x27;s decision to name Wallace as secretary of commerce. Senator Josiah Bailey of North Carolina called both Jones and Wallace to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee, each on consecutive days. Jones testified on the first day that he did not believe that Wallace was a suitable candidate. He characterized Wallace as a visionary who lacked business experience. Sometime during the five hours of testimony the next day, Wallace touted his own business experience, but sought to restrict the scope of power from the Commerce Department and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which he claimed were exploited by business interests. Steven Fenberg, the author of the most recent biography of Jones, characterized him as the second most powerful person in America next to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who sometimes called him &quot;Jesus Jones.&quot;

===Zoning proponent===
Jones returned to Houston early in 1948. In January, he had already found a new political project, and used his &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; as a platform. He expressed concern about &quot;undesirable [commercial] encroachments&quot; and advocated for land use zoning as a method for protecting residential areas. Hugh Roy Cullen led the effort to prevent new zoning regulation for land development in the city of Houston. This was in response to Jones and other zoning advocates in Houston. Cullen believed zoning regulations to be socialist and un-American. Though Jones attracted attention to the zoning issue, his involvement started very late in the struggle, as he published his first opinion in the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; less than two weeks before the vote. Jones published Cullen&#x27;s opinion opposing zoning in Houston. He accused Jones of being an outsider because Jones had lived away from Houston for twenty-five or thirty years. In addition, he charged Jones with trying to run the city with the &quot;assistance of New York Jews,&quot; and vowed to resign his chair at the Board of Regents at the University of Houston. Jones published Cullen&#x27;s commentary and his own response to it in the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; two days before the zoning vote. Jones wrote that many other American cities had zoning in rebuttal to Cullen&#x27;s claim that zoning was &quot;un-American and German.&quot; Houston voted against zoning and Cullen never followed through on his threat to quit his leadership positions at non-profits.

===Suite 8F Group===
Jones was associated with a group of Houston political and social leaders known as the &quot;Suite 8F Group&quot;, named for the apartment number at the Lamar Hotel maintained by George and Herman Brown. Jones owned the hotel and resided in the building&#x27;s penthouse, upstairs from the Browns&#x27; suite. The principal members of this group were James Abercrombie, the Brown brothers, Judge James Elkins, Oveta Culp Hobby, William P. Hobby, Robert E. Smith, and Gus Wortham. Historian Joseph Pratt characterized Jones as &quot;the godfather&quot; of the group. The Suite 8F Group began their activities after World War II.

==Philanthropy and non-profits==
Prior to 1937, Jesse and Mary Jones had given about $1 million to charitable causes. In 1937, they established the Houston Endowment to organize their philanthropic endeavors. Their Commerce Company was already established as a conglomeration of most of the family business interests. They granted about a third of the company&#x27;s shares to the Houston Endowment, while appointing Milton Backlund, Fred Heyne, and W. W. Moore as the first trustees. During the first seven years, Houston Endowment focused its donations on education.

From 1932, Jones had not cashed any paychecks he earned through his various federal government positions through 1945. In 1946, he signed them all over to the Houston Endowment. At the same time Jones and his wife worked through the Houston Endowment to give this money away, much of it with a focus on education. Through the Houston Endowment, they made a $300,000 grant to the University of Virginia in honor of Woodrow Wilson. They established scholarship funds for the Texas State College for Women, Prairie View A &amp; M University, the University of Tennessee, and Texas A &amp; M University. Later they created an engineering scholarship at Massachusetts Institute of Technology honoring Bill Knudsen and an economics scholarship at Austin College honoring Jesse&#x27;s brother, John. More ten-year scholarship programs funded students attending Rice University and Texas A &amp; M, and several of the individual recipients were veterans of World War II. Another program supported nursing candidates at the University of Houston. They also made large gifts to the American Red Cross, the Houston Community Chest, the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, and the United Jewish Appeal.

In 1946, Jones joined the Board of Trustees of the Texas Medical Center.

In 1956, the Jesse Holman Jones Hospital was built in Springfield, Tennessee to replace the original hospital there.

Jones made a gift of $1 million to Rice University to establish Jones College, which opened in 1957. The name for the all-women&#x27;s dormitories honored Mary Gibbs Jones.

==Honors==

The 1902 Notsuoh Festival (Houston spelled backwards) elected Jones as its King Nottoc (cotton spelled backwards). His duty was to rule over the Tekram (market) of Saxet (Texas). This was a gag repeated in Houston from 1899 to 1915, and the week-long festival included dances and parades. The crowning of Jones as King Nottoc after living in Houston for just four years symbolized a quick acceptance into local society.

In 1925, Jones received an honorary Doctor of Law degree from Southwestern University, and another from Oglethorpe University in 1941.

Houston honored Jones with &quot;Jesse H. Jones Day&quot; on December 26, 1934. The pronouncement was made by Houston Mayor Oscar Holcombe. The Scottish Rite Temple provided the venue for a ceremony, where there was the first public viewing of a bronze bust of Jones sculpted by Enrico Cerracchio.

In 1939, the Alabama-Coushatta tribe named Jones &quot;Chief Cue-ya-la-na&quot; when they accepted him into their community. The name translates as &quot;Yellow Pine,&quot; symbolic of the tallest being within their local environment and a being which serves all members of their community.

==Personal life==

Jones resided at the Rice Hotel in Houston, but he also stayed at &quot;the Boarding House,&quot; the home of his aunt, Louisa Jones. Her house was located at the corner of Anita and Main Street, south of downtown Houston. Jones managed the estate of his uncle, M. T. Jones, and continued to act as a business manager for his aunt and his cousins for many years. Much of his social life revolved around them, too. His future wife, Mary Gibbs Jones, was first married to his cousin, Will Jones.

Jones married Mary Gibbs on December 15, 1920. They resided at the Rice Hotel until 1926 when they moved into their penthouse at the new Lamar Hotel. Alfred C. Finn designed and supervised the construction of the building, but Jones hired John Staub to design the interior for their apartment. Audrey Jones, one of Mary&#x27;s granddaughters, also lived with them. Other members of his extended family maintained apartments at the Lamar. His relationships with some of his business associates were also based on close friendships, so Jones referred to this business network as his &quot;business family.&quot;

==Death and legacy==

Jones retained the title of publisher of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; until his death on June 1, 1956, at the age of 82. His remains were interred in Houston&#x27;s Forest Park Cemetery.

The name of Jesse H. Jones is memorialized throughout Houston through many grants from the Houston Endowment. The home of the Houston Symphony is Jesse H. Jones Hall in the Houston Theater District.

Texas Southern University founded the Jesse H. Jones School of Business in 1955. After Jones&#x27;s death the Houston Endowment made donations to Rice University. They established the Jesse H. Jones Chair of Management, and in the 1970s, they granted $10 million to start the Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Management. The Jesse H. Jones Student Life Center, a recreation facility at the University of Houston–Downtown, was fully funded by the Houston Endowment. Baylor University&#x27;s central libraries include the Jesse H. Jones Library. The Jesse H. Jones Physical Education Complex on the campus of Texas Lutheran University in Seguin bears his name.

Jones contributed money to the Houston Academy of Medicine/Texas Medical Center for a new home for its library. This building is known as the Jesse H. Jones Library Building. The Jesse H. and Mary Gibbs Jones Pavilion (1977) connects Memorial Hermann Hospital to the University of Texas Medical School.

Other Jones buildings include the Houston Public Library&#x27;s Central Library building and the Great Jones Building, the former home of Texaco and briefly the location of Jones&#x27;s office. Beyond buildings, one may visit the Jesse H. Jones Park and Nature Center in Humble.

Since 1998, the World Affairs Council of Greater Houston has presented the Jesse H. Jones Award.

<text>Yehoshua Bar-Hillel (; 8 September 1915 – 25 September 1975) was an Israeli philosopher, mathematician, and linguist. He was a pioneer in the fields of machine translation and formal linguistics.

==Early life and education ==
Born Oscar Westreich in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, he was raised in Berlin. In 1933 he emigrated to Palestine with the Bnei Akiva youth movement, and briefly joined the kibbutz Tirat Zvi before settling in Jerusalem and marrying Shulamith.

During World War II, he served in the Jewish Brigade of the British Army. He fought with the Haganah during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, losing an eye.

Bar-Hillel received his PhD in Philosophy from the Hebrew University where he also studied mathematics under Abraham Fraenkel, with whom he eventually coauthored &quot;Foundations of Set Theory&quot; (1958, 1973). 

== Career ==
Bar-Hillel was a major disciple of Rudolf Carnap, whose &quot;Logical Syntax of Language&quot; much influenced him. He began a correspondence with Carnap in the 1940s, which led to a 1950 post-doctorate under Carnap at the University of Chicago, and to his collaborating on Carnap&#x27;s 1952 &quot;An Outline of the Theory of Semantic Information&quot;.

Bar-Hillel then took up a position at MIT, where he was the first academic to work full-time in the field of machine translation. Bar-Hillel organised the first International Conference on Machine Translation in 1952. Later he expressed doubts that general-purpose fully automatic high-quality machine translation would ever be feasible. He was also a pioneer in the field of information retrieval.

In 1953, Bar-Hillel joined the philosophy department at the Hebrew University, where he taught until his death at age 60. His teachings and writings strongly influenced an entire generation of Israeli philosophers and linguists, including Asa Kasher and Avishai Margalit. In 1953, he founded a pioneering algebraic-computational linguistic group, and in 1961 he contributed to the proof of the pumping lemma for context-free languages (sometimes called the Bar-Hillel lemma). Bar-Hillel helped found the Hebrew University&#x27;s department of Philosophy of Science. From 1966 to 1969 Bar-Hillel presided over the Division for Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science of the
International Union of History and Philosophy of Science.

Bar-Hillel&#x27;s daughter Maya Bar-Hillel is a cognitive psychologist at the Hebrew University, known for her collaborations with Amos Tversky and for her role in critiquing Bible code study. His other daughter, Mira Bar-Hillel, is a freelance journalist who has worked for the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. His granddaughter, Gili Bar-Hillel, is the Hebrew translator of the Harry Potter series of books.

<doc id="739318" wikidata="Q695234" url="?curid=739318" title="Charles Bonaventure de Longueval, 2nd Count of Bucquoy">
<text>Charles Bonaventure de Longueval, 2nd Count of Bucquoy (, , full name in , ) (9 January 1571, Arras – 10 July 1621, Nové Zámky) was a military commander who fought for the Spanish Netherlands during the Eighty Years&#x27; War and for the Holy Roman Empire during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

==Career in the Spanish Army of Flanders==
Bucquoy was born in Arras on 9 January 1571, son of Maximilian de Longueval, 1st Count of Bucquoy. He began serving in Spanish forces in the Low Countries as a teenager, and was a colonel at the age of 26. He fought in the Battle of Nieuwpoort (1600), the Siege of Ostend (1601–1604) and distinguished himself as General of the Artillery in the Frisian campaigns of Ambrosio Spinola. In 1606 he married Maria Maddalena Biglia, daughter of a Milanese nobleman in the entourage of the Archduke Albert and in 1607 they had a son named Charles Albert.
In 1610 he was ambassador extraordinary to France, to convey the condolences of Archdukes Albert and Isabella on the murder of Henry IV of France.

In 1613 he became a knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece. As a mark of special favour the commandery in the Order of Calatrava that he had to renounce upon entering the Golden Fleece, was transferred to his son. That year also saw his appointment as Grand Bailiff (or governor) of the County of Hainaut.

==Commander of the Imperial Army==
He travelled to Bohemia to represent Archduke Albert at the Diet of Budweis in January 1614. Shortly after his election, Emperor Matthias invited Bucquoy to take charge of the Imperial Army and he accepted the post in August 1614. He happened to be on leave in the Habsburg Netherlands when on 23 May 1618 the Second Defenestration of Prague triggered the Bohemian Revolt. Bucquoy returned to Vienna in August and took command of the imperial forces raised to put down the revolt. Short of soldiers, supplies and money, his first campaign came close to disaster more than once. Defeated by Count Jindřich Matyáš Thurn on 9 November in the Battle of Lomnice, he was unable to save the besieged town of Pilsen. While his army encamped in its winter quarters around Budweis, Thurn&#x27;s surprise march on Vienna was only halted by the severity of winter. After receiving reinforcements provided by Archduke Albert, Bucquoy&#x27;s campaign of 1619 did much to reverse the fortunes of the war. On 10 June he defeated Ernst von Mansfeld in the Battle of Sablat, thereby forcing the Bohemians to abandon their siege of Budweis.

He also commanded the imperial forces during the Battle of White Mountain on 8 November 1620. As a result of his successes, Emperor Ferdinand II gave him estates at Nové Hrady, Rožmberk and Libějovice. These estates remained in the family until 1945.

Bucquoy was killed during the siege of Neuhäusel Fortress &quot;(Hungary: Érsekújvár, Latin: Novum Castrum, today Nové Zámky, Slovakia)&quot; on 10 July 1621. One of his commanders, Torquato Conti, attempted to retrieve his body from the battlefield but was captured. Conti was later released and replaced Bucquoy as a commander of Imperial forces.

His funeral, with full honours, took place in the Franciscan Church, Vienna, on 31 July 1621.

<text>Sheng Yen (), born Zhang Baokang (), (January 22, 1931 – February 3, 2009) was a Taiwanese Buddhist monk, religious scholar, and writer. He was one of the mainstream teachers of Chan Buddhism. He was a 57th generational dharma heir of Linji Yixuan in the Linji school (Japanese: Rinzai) and a third-generation dharma heir of Hsu Yun. In the Caodong (Japanese: Sōtō) lineage, Sheng Yen was a 52nd-generation Dharma heir of Dongshan Liangjie (807-869), and a direct Dharma heir of Dongchu (1908–1977).

Sheng Yen was the founder of the Dharma Drum Mountain, a Buddhist organization based in Taiwan. During his time in Taiwan, Sheng Yen was well known as a progressive Buddhist teacher who sought to teach Buddhism in a modern and Western-influenced world. In Taiwan, he was one of four prominent modern Buddhist masters, along with Hsing Yun, Cheng Yen and Wei Chueh, popularly referred to as the &quot;Four Heavenly Kings&quot; of Taiwanese Buddhism. In 2000 he was one of the keynote speakers in the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders held in the United Nations.

==Biography==

=== Early life (1931–1959) ===
Born as Chang Baokang on January 22, 1931, in Nantong, Jiangsu near Shanghai in mainland China, he became a monk at the age of 13. During the Chinese Civil War, he went to Taiwan in 1949 by enlisting in a unit of the Nationalist Army. After leaving the army Sheng Yen became recognized as a Dharma Heir in both the Linji and Caodong traditions and became a monk again in 1959.

=== Resuming monastic life ===
From 1961 to 1968 he trained in solitary retreat in southern Taiwan at Chao Yuan Monastery. Sheng Yen became a lecturer at Shan Dao Monastery in Taipei and then completed a master&#x27;s degree (1971) and doctorate (1975) in Buddhist literature at Rissho University in Japan. At the time Sheng Yen was the only major Buddhist figure in Taiwan to have earned a doctorate from a reputable foreign university.

Sheng Yen received full transmission in the Caodong tradition in 1975 and the Linji tradition in 1978.

Sheng Yen became abbot of Nung Chan in Taiwan in 1978 and founder of the Institute of Chung-Hwa Buddhist Culture in New York City in 1979. In 1985, he founded the Institute of Chung-Hwa Buddhist Studies in Taipei and the International Cultural and Educational Foundation of Dharma Drum Mountain in 1989.

=== Propagation of Buddhardharma in the West ===
Sheng Yen taught in the United States starting in 1975, and established Chan Meditation Center in Queens, New York, and its retreat center, Dharma Drum Retreat Center at Pine Bush, New York in 1997. He also visited many countries in Europe, as well as continuing his teaching in several Asian countries, in particular Taiwan. Sheng Yen gave dharma transmission to several of his lay Western students, such as John Crook, who later formed the Western Chan Fellowship, and several other Western disciples such as Simon Child, Max Kalin, and Zarko Andricevic.

Sheng Yen&#x27;s health was poor in the last couple years of his life, although he still gave lectures in Taiwan.

===Death===
Sheng Yen died from renal failure on February 3, 2009, while returning from National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei. He had endured the illness for many years, but refused a kidney transplant. In accordance with East Asian age reckoning, the Dharma Drum Mountain organization states that Sheng Yen died at the age of 80.
Officially, according to the Western way of reckoning age, Sheng Yen died at the age of 78.

Hours after his death, tributes from eminent Buddhist monks and Taiwanese politicians and celebrities, including President Ma Ying-jeou, Vice President Vincent Siew, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, kung fu star Jet Li, and actress Brigitte Lin, began to pour into Dharma Drum Mountain monastery. As stipulated in his will, Sheng Yen forbade the use of extravagant funeral services, including the construction of memorials or monuments. Sheng Yen received a simple Buddhist ritual attended by the President and dignitaries, and was buried in the Life Memorial Garden near the monastery. His ashes were divided into five sections, with each section filled by the Abbot, senior disciples, President Ma, Vice President Siew, and other laity.

In the Chan lineage of Sheng Yen, a &quot;Dharma heir&quot; receives the dharma transmission based on his or her selfless administrative contributions to Dharma Drum Mountain and practice of Chan. However, a Dharma heir may not have had a personal experience of self-nature or Buddha-nature, the nature of śūnyatā, in which case the person would also receive &quot;yinke&quot; (Jp. inka shōmei), the seal of approval. Among the Dharma heirs, there are only a few who have both Dharma transmission and yinke.

Among Sheng Yen&#x27;s senior disciples, there are also those who have received yinke but no dharma transmission for various reasons.

<text>William Brian Binnie (April 26, 1953 – September 15, 2022) was a United States Navy officer and one of the test pilots for SpaceShipOne, the experimental spaceplane developed by Scaled Composites and flown from 2003 to 2004.

==Early life==
Binnie was born in West Lafayette, Indiana, on April 26, 1953, where his Scottish father William P. Binnie was a professor of physics at Purdue University. The family returned to Scotland when Binnie was five, and lived in Aberdeen (his father taught at Aberdeen University) and later in Stirling. When Binnie was a teenager the family moved to Boston.

Binnie earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in aerospace engineering from Brown University. He earned a master&#x27;s degree from Brown in fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. Binnie was rejected by the United States Air Force, and enrolled at Princeton University, where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering He served for 21 years in the United States Navy as a naval aviator, reaching the rank of commander. He flew the A-7 Corsair II, A-6 Intruder, F/A-18 Hornet, and AV-8B Harrier II. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in 1988. Binnie also copiloted the Atmospheric Test Vehicle of the Rotary Rocket. In 2006, he received an honorary degree from the University of Aberdeen.

==SpaceShipOne and spaceflight==
On December 17, 2003, the 100th anniversary of the Wright brothers&#x27; first powered flight, Binnie piloted the first powered test flight of SpaceShipOne, flight 11P, which reached a top speed of Mach 1.2 and a height of . On October 4, 2004, he piloted SpaceShipOne&#x27;s second Ansari X Prize flight, flight 17P, winning the X Prize and becoming the 436th person to go into space. His flight, which peaked at , set a winged aircraft altitude record for suborbital flights, breaking the old record set by the North American X-15 in 1963. It also earned him the second Astronaut Badge to be given by the FAA for a flight aboard a privately operated commercial spacecraft.

==Later career==
In 2014 Binnie joined XCOR Aerospace as senior engineer and test pilot, after working as a test pilot and program business manager for Scaled Composites for many years.

<text>Peter Siebold (born 1971) is a member of the Scaled Composites astronaut team. He is their Director of Flight Operations, and was one of the test pilots for SpaceShipOne and SpaceShipTwo, the experimental spaceplanes developed by the company. On April 8, 2004, Siebold piloted the second powered test flight of SpaceShipOne, flight 13P, which reached a top speed of Mach 1.6 and an altitude of . On October 31, 2014, Siebold and Michael Alsbury were piloting the SpaceShipTwo VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot; on flight PF04, when the craft came apart in mid-air and then crashed, killing Alsbury and injuring Siebold.

==Career==
Peter Siebold, a 1990 graduate of Davis Senior High School in Davis, California, obtained his pilot&#x27;s license at age 16. He has been a design engineer at Scaled Composites since 1996. Siebold holds a degree in aerospace engineering from California Polytechnic University at San Luis Obispo, from 2001.

Siebold was responsible for the simulator, navigation system, and ground control system for the SpaceShipOne project at Scaled. Although he was one of four qualified pilots for SpaceShipOne, Siebold did not pilot the craft during the flights later in 2004 to meet the requirements of the Ansari X Prize. Although Siebold flew SpaceShipOne to an altitude of , he did not cross the 100 km Kármán line—the international standard for reaching space.

For his contribution to the SpaceShipOne project, Siebold, along with Mike Melvill and Brian Binnie, received the 2004 Iven C. Kincheloe Award presented by the Society of Experimental Test Pilots.

Siebold became the Director of Flight Operations at Scaled. He was the pilot who flew the White Knight Two on its maiden flight on December 21, 2008. He won the Iven C. Kincheloe Award a second time in 2009, this time individually, for his work on the first WhiteKnightTwo, VMS &quot;Eve&quot;, as chief test pilot.

===SpaceShipTwo VSS Enterprise crash===

On October 31, 2014, Siebold was one of the two pilots flying the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo, VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, along with Michael Alsbury, on a test flight, which suffered an anomaly, resulting in the death of Alsbury and loss of &quot;Enterprise&quot;. VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot; crashed in the California Mojave Desert. Thrown clear of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; when it broke up in mid-air, Siebold survived a descent from about at Mach 1 speed with just a flightsuit. His parachute deployed automatically at about , and, after landing, he was taken to the hospital for treatment. He suffered from eyesight degradation and eye pains. He was unable to keep his eyes open and he did not open his right eye until emergency personnel arrived.

Siebold&#x27;s flight suit was saturated with blood from bleeding in his right arm. He did not feel any lower body injuries. As Siebold removed his parachute harness a &quot;clunking noise&quot; was felt in his chest and Siebold became concerned about a potential spinal fracture. Upon arrival at the ER his flight suit was cut away. 

Siebold experienced a non-compound four-part fracture of his right humerus. The ball of his ankle was also dislocated and fractured. He had a non-displaced fracture of his right clavicle, a small gash in his right elbow (source of the blood on his flight suit), a deep scrape on his right wrist, and multiple scrapes on the back of his right shoulder. There was considerable bruising on his right chest but he did not know how it occurred. He did not recall any bruising on his left side. He had an abrasion under his chin which he felt was consistent with the location of his chin strap, and had multiple contusions and scrapes on his face. He was diagnosed with corneal scratches and doctors removed a piece of fiberglass from his left eye during a hospital stay. The eyes did not improve so he saw an ophthalmologist after being discharged. The ophthalmologist removed some foreign matter from his left eyelid and a &quot;silver sliver&quot; from his right cornea. His eyes improved immediately post procedure.

<text>Michael Winston Melvill (born November 30, 1940, in Johannesburg, South Africa) is a world-record-breaking pilot and one of the test pilots for SpaceShipOne, the experimental spaceplane developed by Scaled Composites. Melvill piloted SpaceShipOne on its first flight past the edge of space, flight 15P on June 21, 2004, thus becoming the first commercial astronaut, and the 435th person to go into space. He was also the pilot on SpaceShipOne&#x27;s flight 16P, the first competitive flight in the Ansari X Prize competition.

==Life and career==

In 1978, Melvill met aerospace designer and Scaled Composites founder Burt Rutan when he flew to California to show Rutan the VariViggen he had built at his home. Rutan then hired him on the spot. In 1982, he was named Rutan&#x27;s lead test pilot.

In 1997, Melvill and Dick Rutan, Burt&#x27;s brother, flew two Long-Eze aircraft that they built side-by-side around the world. This &quot;around the world in 80 nights&quot; flight was called The Spirit of EAA Friendship World Tour, and some legs of it lasted for over 14 hours.

His famous 2004 flights in SpaceshipOne earned him and the entire project team the Ansari X Prize of $10 million and helped spur the beginning of the global private space race.

Later in his career, he became Vice President/General Manager at Scaled Composites.

<text>Joe Rush (born 1960) is a British artist. He is the founder of Mutoid Waste Company, a performance arts collective that has performed at Glastonbury Festival.

==Early life==
Rush was born in 1960 in London, England.

== Career ==
In 1980, Rush exhibited at The Car Breaker Gallery in Frestonia, London.

In 1984, he founded the Mutoid Waste Company, an underground travelling collective of artists. That same year, he launched the first &quot;Installation Party&quot; in the disused Kings Cross coach station. From then on, he produced installations of his pieces in environments he mutated, occupying derelict warehouses and factories.

Throughout the 1980s, he built techno-industrial sculptures at parties and festivals, and then travelled across both Western and Eastern Europe to continue the work. From making a &quot;car henge&quot; at Glastonbury (stone circle made out of cars), he progressed to using armoured personnel carriers and fighter planes in Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

After leaving Britain for many years, Rush returned to the UK where he and his crew became involved with robotics and animation, as well as organising Mutoid Waste Company projects around the world. He has displayed his art aroun the UK, for example &#x27;X-Ray Ted Mosquito&#x27; as part of Liverpool Discovers 2011.

In 2001, Rush participated in Art-Tube, a month long exhibition on a Piccadilly Line London Underground train.

In 2012, Kim Gavin entrusted to Rush the art direction and creation of the vehicles, mobile stages and props of the London Paralympics Closing Ceremony. The aesthetics of the show were praised.

In July 2018, he opened his first solo exhibition entitled &#x27;Stories From the Wasteland&#x27; at the Bruton Art Factory in Somerset.

In June 2021, Rush created an installation entitled &#x27;Mount Recyclemore&#x27;, depicting world leaders attending the G7 conference in Cornwall.

==Collaborations==

Rush has collaborated with Banksy, Damien Hirst and Vivienne Westwood.

<doc id="739346" wikidata="Q4714689" url="?curid=739346" title="Alejandro Tapia y Rivera">
<text>Alejandro Tapia y Rivera (November 12, 1826 – July 19, 1882) was a Puerto Rican poet, playwright, essayist and writer. Tapia is considered to be the father of Puerto Rican literature and as the person who has contributed the most to the cultural advancement of Puerto Rico&#x27;s literature. In addition to his writing, he was also an abolitionist and a women&#x27;s rights advocate.

==Early years==
Tapia was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Alejandro de Tapia from Murcia, Spain and Catalina de Rivera Sánchez from Arecibo. Both were descended from Spanish nobility. There he received his primary education under the guidance of the educator Rafael Cordero while studying his primary years in a school on Luna Street (Calle Luna) in Old San Juan, who was an early inspiration in his life. There he met his lifelong friend José Julián Acosta. Acosta and Roman Baldorioty de Castro were selected to represent Puerto Rico in Madrid in the occasion of the crowning of Alfonso, the son of Queen Isabella, as the next King of Spain and the trio traveled to Spain on 6 June 1869. Tapia accompanied his friend Acosta during this trip to Spain, and while in Spain, he met Rosario Diaz y Espiau and they married that year. The couple traveled to Puerto Rico and settled in Ponce that same year. They had a daughter, Catalina (Katie) Tapia Diaz, who married Albert Edward Lee, from Ponce but residing in San Juan, on 7 December 1874. They had a daughter, Consuelo Lee Tapia who married Juan Antonio Corretjer. As such, Corretjer was Tapia&#x27;s grandson in law.

Tapia worked for the State Department. A Spanish Army artillery officer challenged him to a duel when Tapia refused to yield the sidewalk to him, a challenge which he accepted; as a result, Tapia suffered a non-lethal injury in the arm and subsequently exiled to Spain, where he remained with his father for a period of time.

==Literary career==
While in Spain he completed his studies in literature in Madrid (1850–1852) and joined the Society of the Recollection of Historical Documents Relating to Puerto Rico (&quot;Sociedad Recolectora de Documentos Históricos de San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico&quot;). Tapia filed and organized important 16th and 17th century documents of Puerto Rico. He published his first important work called &quot;The Historical Library of Puerto Rico&quot; (&quot;Biblioteca Histórica de Puerto Rico&quot;) relating to those documents and his findings on them.

In 1852, the Spanish-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Fernando de Norzagaray, pardoned Tapia and returned to Puerto Rico, establishing his residence in the city of Ponce on the southern coast of the island. He was a member of the Progressive Action Political Party. Among his cultural positions was his membership in the Puerto Rican Intellectual Protective Society. He was also the director of the Youth Museum in Ponce and the founder and first president of the Ateneo Puertorriqueño. He moved from Ponce to San Juan around 1874, after founding, in Ponce, Puerto Rico&#x27;s first &quot;Gabinete de Lectura&quot; in 1870. The Gabinete de Lectura was the precursor of the Ponce Municipal Library.

==Death==
Alejandro Tapia y Rivera died in the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico, on July 19, 1882, while giving a conference at the Ateneo Puertorriqueño.

*The Royal and Distinguished Order of Carlos III from Spain.

==Posthumous honors==
His memory has been honoured in Puerto Rico. There are schools and avenues named after Tapia. The Teatro Tapia in Old San Juan, the Island&#x27;s premier dramatic stage, is also named after him. In July 2008, Roberto Ramos Perea, general director of the &quot;Archivo Nacional de Teatro y Cine del Ateneo Puertorriqueño&quot;, an archive dedicated to conserve documents and memorabilia from the theatre industry in Puerto Rico, announced that a documentary covering Tapia y Rivera&#x27;s life is planned. The filmation is part of a series of events honoring his life, titled &quot; Jornadas en Honor y Memoria de Alejandro Tapia y Rivera&quot;.

<text>The Santa Rosa Range is a mountain range in Humboldt County, Nevada, United States. Most of the range is included within the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. The highest peaks in the range are Granite Peak (9732 feet, 2966 m) and Santa Rosa Peak (9701 feet, 2957 m). The range extends for approximately 75 miles (120 km) north from Winnemucca Mountain near Winnemucca through eastern Humboldt County to the border with Oregon. The upper elevations of the southern section of the range are protected as the Santa Rosa-Paradise Peak Wilderness Area.

The eastern side of the range is a ranching district around Paradise Valley, drained by the Little Humboldt River, a tributary of the Humboldt. The Quinn River Valley is west of the range. The Owyhee Desert on the edge of the Columbia Plateau extends northeast from the north end of the range.

The range was so named on account of wild roses which grow in the area.

<doc id="739349" wikidata="Q1133376" url="?curid=739349" title="Bulletproof glass">
<text>Bulletproof glass, ballistic glass, transparent armor, or bullet-resistant glass is a strong and optically transparent material that is particularly resistant to penetration by projectiles, although, like any other material, it is not completely impenetrable. It is usually made from a combination of two or more types of glass, one hard and one soft. The softer layer makes the glass more elastic, so that it can flex instead of shatter. The index of refraction for all of the glasses used in the bulletproof layers must be almost the same to keep the glass transparent and allow a clear, undistorted view through the glass. Bulletproof glass varies in thickness from .

Bulletproof glass is used in windows of buildings that require such security, such as jewelry stores and embassies, and of military and private vehicles.

==Construction==

Bullet-resistant glass is constructed using layers of laminated glass. The more layers there are, the more protection the glass offers. When a weight reduction is needed, polycarbonate (a thermoplastic) is laminated onto the safe side to stop spall. The aim is to make a material with the appearance and clarity of standard glass but with effective protection from small arms. Polycarbonate designs usually consist of products such as Armormax, Makroclear, Cyrolon: a soft coating that heals after being scratched (such as elastomeric carbon-based polymers) or a hard coating that prevents scratching (such as silicon-based polymers).

The plastic in laminate designs also provides resistance to impact from physical assault from blunt and sharp objects. The plastic provides little in the way of bullet-resistance. The glass, which is much harder than plastic, flattens the bullet, and the plastic deforms, with the aim of absorbing the rest of the energy and preventing penetration. The ability of the polycarbonate layer to stop projectiles with varying energy is directly proportional to its thickness, and bulletproof glass of this design may be up to 3.5 inches thick.

Laminated glass layers are built from glass sheets bonded together with polyvinyl butyral, polyurethane, Sentryglas, or ethylene-vinyl acetate. When treated with chemical processes, the glass becomes much stronger. This design has been in regular use on combat vehicles since World War II. It is typically thick and is usually extremely heavy.

==Test standards==
Bullet-resistant materials are tested using a gun to fire a projectile from a set distance into the material, in a specific pattern. Levels of protection are based on the ability of the target to stop a specific type of projectile traveling at a specific speed. Experiments suggest that polycarbonate fails at lower velocities with regular shaped projectiles compared to irregular ones (like fragments), meaning that testing with regular shaped projectiles gives a conservative estimate of its resistance. When projectiles do not penetrate, the depth of the dent left by the impact can be measured and related to the projectile’s velocity and thickness of the material. Some researchers have developed mathematical models based on results of this kind of testing to help them design bulletproof glass to resist specific anticipated threats.

==Environmental effects==
The properties of bullet-resistant glass can be affected by temperature and by exposure to solvents or UV radiation, usually from sunlight. If the polycarbonate layer is below a glass layer, it has some protection from UV radiation due to the glass and bonding layer. Over time the polycarbonate becomes more brittle because it is an amorphous polymer (which is necessary for it to be transparent) that moves toward thermodynamic equilibrium.

An impact on polycarbonate by a projectile at temperatures below −7 °C sometimes creates spall, pieces of polycarbonate that are broken off and become projectiles themselves. Experiments have demonstrated that the size of the spall is related to the thickness of the laminate rather than the size of the projectile. The spall starts in surface flaws caused by bending of the inner, polycarbonate layer and the cracks move “backwards” through to the impact surface. It has been suggested that a second inner layer of polycarbonate may effectively resist penetration by the spall.

==2000s advances==
In 2005, it was reported that U.S. military researchers were developing a class of transparent armor incorporating aluminum oxynitride (ALON) as the outside &quot;strike plate&quot; layer. Traditional glass/polymer was demonstrated by ALON&#x27;s manufacturer to require 2.3 times more thickness than ALON&#x27;s, to guard against a .50 BMG projectile. ALON is much lighter and performs much better than traditional glass/polymer laminates. Aluminum oxynitride &quot;glass&quot; can defeat threats like the .50 caliber armor-piercing rounds using material that is not prohibitively heavy.

===Spinel ceramics===
Certain types of ceramics can also be used for transparent armor due to their properties of increased density and hardness when compared to traditional glass. These types of synthetic ceramic transparent armors can allow for thinner armor with equivalent stopping power to traditional laminated glass.

<text>Lucy Pevensie is a fictional character in C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; series. She is the youngest of the four Pevensie children and the first to find the Wardrobe entrance to Narnia in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;. Of all the Pevensie children, Lucy is the closest to Aslan. Also, of all the humans who have visited Narnia, Lucy is perhaps the one that believes in Narnia the most. She is ultimately crowned Queen Lucy the Valiant, co-ruler of Narnia along with her two brothers and her sister. Lucy is the central character of the four siblings in the novels. Lucy is a principal character in three of the seven books (&quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, and &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;), and a minor character in two others (&quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; and &quot;The Last Battle&quot;).

The character of Lucy Pevensie was inspired by June Flewett, a devout Catholic London girl evacuated by her convent to The Kilns, Lewis&#x27; country home in 1942, and named after Lewis&#x27; goddaughter Lucy Barfield, to whom he dedicated &quot;The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;. Lucy is described in the book as being fair-haired: &quot;But as for Lucy, she was always gay and golden-haired, and all princes in those parts desired her to be their Queen, and her people called her Queen Lucy the Valiant.&quot;

Lucy was the most faithful of the four and the closest to Aslan, and never stopped believing in Narnia. She and her brothers Peter and Edmund, after dying in a train crash in England, were transported to Aslan&#x27;s Country with the other Narnians.

==Character==
Lucy is the most sensitive and faithful out of all her siblings; which is why she is written as seeing Aslan across the gorge in &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; and her brothers and sister written as cynical and less inclined to go on blind faith. As a young child in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; in a strange house without her mother about, she is also extremely vulnerable and is looking for security, wonder and something to believe in. She is teased mercilessly by Edmund about Narnia, being accused of playing &quot;childish games&quot;. Once she &quot;knows&quot; he also has visited the land in the wardrobe and he &quot;still&quot; maintains that they were only playing a game, her anguish knows no bounds, as her faith in humanity and the security of her own beliefs about her siblings are now also under threat.

Lucy loves animals, and befriends many creatures, and is devastated in &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; to discover that not only has Narnia been invaded by the Telmarines; but that they have suppressed the many creatures and divine and semi-divine beings that made Narnia the extraordinary place it was. Her heartfelt night-time roam through the woods, craving to see the tree spirits dance and share in their communion with nature and life once again is one of the very deep moments of love, hope and disappointment that we share with Lucy in her spiritual journey. Lucy also never stops believing in Narnia and is full of courage because of her faith; and is thus more adventurous than her sister Susan. Lucy has a great desire to help others, which is symbolized by the healing cordial that was given to her by Father Christmas for others in need and only with sparing use. The lesson from Aslan on the battlefield in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; is to use this power impartially and not dwell on the needs of those she loves most.

===&quot; The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;===
Lucy&#x27;s siblings, Peter, Susan and Edmund, do not believe her about Narnia at first, but later they all find their way to Narnia.

Lucy is the first of the Pevensies to enter Narnia through a magical wardrobe in the Professor&#x27;s old house, into Narnia in the One Hundred Year Winter, under the rule of the White Witch, the evil self-proclaimed Queen of Narnia. There she meets Mr. Tumnus the Faun and, then later, the Beavers. However, her brother Edmund had also slipped into Narnia on the second occasion Lucy had entered, and encountered the White Witch while she was visiting Mr. Tumnus. Edmund, who had already jeered at Lucy about her &quot;magical&quot; country, continued to be spiteful towards Lucy by denying that either of them had been in Narnia. When the children all enter Narnia, Edmund slips away from the house of the Beavers and defects to the White Witch.

While travelling with Peter, Susan and Mr. and Mrs. Beaver to the Stone Table, they meet Father Christmas, who gives them gifts. Lucy is given a vial with magical cordial that can heal almost any injury, and a small dagger with which to defend herself &quot;a great need&quot;. Edmund, meanwhile, had tried to betray the Beavers and joined the White Witch; he had first met her and been seduced by promises of power after first entering the wardrobe when trying to follow Lucy on her second entry to Narnia.

She and her companions arrive at Aslan&#x27;s camp, and later that night, she and Susan comfort Aslan as he walks to his death – although they do not know of his fate at the time. Both girls also witness his sacrifice. While their brothers are going to war, Lucy and her sister see Aslan come back to life and help him wake the creatures in the White Witch&#x27;s castle, which the White Witch had turned to stone. They meet with their brothers at the end of the battle.

At Cair Paravel, she is crowned as Her Majesty Queen Lucy by Aslan to the throne as co-ruler of Narnia, this marking the fulfilling of the ancient prophecy and the end of the White Witch&#x27;s reign. During her reign, she is named Queen Lucy the Valiant. She and her siblings make a Golden Age in Narnia.

Years later, while hunting the White Stag through Lantern Waste, she and her siblings notice the lantern where she met Mr. Tumnus. The Pevensies return through the wardrobe into England, where no time has passed and they are children again.

===&quot;Prince Caspian&quot;===
Lucy travels to Narnia again with her three siblings. Lucy is the only one to see Aslan at first, and she has a terrible time convincing her brothers and sister as well as Trumpkin the dwarf that he had returned, echoing her trials early in the first book. However, Edmund believes her and backs her up. Aslan tells her to try again and says that she must follow him alone if they refuse to come with her. Lucy comments that Aslan has grown larger, but really she is the one who has grown.

===&quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;===
While Susan travels with Mr. and Mrs. Pevensie to America and Peter studies with Professor Digory Kirke, Lucy, Edmund and their cousin Eustace are drawn into Narnia through a magical painting in &quot; The Voyage of the&quot; Dawn Treader. This is very much Lucy&#x27;s book, written largely from her point of view. However, in the end, Aslan firmly tells her and Edmund that they have become, like Susan and Peter, too old to further experience the wonders of Narnia.

===&quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;===
The events in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; take place after the siblings are crowned, and before they return to England, in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, and Queen Lucy is a young woman who rides to the aid of Archenland. She is described by Prince Corin as being more like a tomboy, unlike her sister, Queen Susan, who is a &quot;proper lady&quot;. She helps King Lune to welcome Aravis to Anvard and helps to get Aravis&#x27;s room and clothes ready.

===&quot;The Last Battle&quot;===
In &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, she plays a minor part as she returns to Narnia again with her brothers, High King Peter and King Edmund, along with Eustace Scrubb, Jill Pole, Polly Plummer, and Digory Kirke. There, she witnesses the destruction of Narnia and lives in the new Narnia created by Aslan. In the new Narnia, all the people and animals who lived in the previous Narnia during its existence return and join together. Lucy also meets her old friend Mr. Tumnus the Faun again, and Aslan tells her about a railway accident that occurs in England in which she, her brothers, her parents, Polly, Digory, Eustace and Jill die. She and Digory, Polly, Peter, Edmund, Eustace and Jill stay in Aslan&#x27;s homeland for eternity. However, Susan remains living on Earth, her final fate undetermined.

==Portrayals==
*In the 1967 TV serial, she was portrayed by Liz Crowther.
* In the 1980s BBC serial, Lucy is portrayed by English actress Sophie Wilcox.
* In Disney&#x27;s live-action films, Lucy is portrayed by Georgie Henley as a child and Rachael Henley (her older sister) as an adult in the end of the first film.

==Other appearances==
Although reviews of &quot;The Oz/Wonderland Chronicles&quot; issue 0 indicated that Alice, Wendy Darling and Dorothy Gale shared their dorm with Susan Pevensie, a recent review of the now-released issue 1 indicates many fans are believing this is actually meant to be Lucy and not Susan.

She is spoofed in the 2007 film &quot;Epic Movie&quot;, played by Jayma Mays.
