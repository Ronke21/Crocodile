==Early life and education==

In 1971, he appeared in the film &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot;. Melvin Van Peebles directed and played the lead role, and Mario played his father&#x27;s character as a child. The film became a hit and a historical American film, because it was widely credited with showing Hollywood that a viable black audience existed and thus influenced the creation of the Blaxploitation genre.

<text>Nurse Betty is a 2000 American black comedy film directed by Neil LaBute and starring Renée Zellweger as the title character, a small town, Kansas housewife-waitress who suffers a nervous breakdown after witnessing her husband&#x27;s torture murder, and starts obsessively pursuing her favorite television soap opera character (Greg Kinnear), while in a fugue state. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play the hitmen who killed her husband and subsequently pursue her to Los Angeles.

The film premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival. The film won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Screenplay. For her performance, Zellweger won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. The film was also a commercial success.

==Plot==
In the small Kansas town of Fair Oaks, diner waitress Betty Sizemore is a fan of the soap opera &quot;A Reason to Love&quot;. She has no idea that her husband Del, a car salesman, is having a sexual affair with another woman. She also doesn&#x27;t know that her husband supplements his income by selling drugs. When Betty calls to ask about borrowing a Buick LeSabre for her birthday, Del tells her to take a different car. She manages to get the Buick&#x27;s key and drives off, unaware that a large stash of drugs is hidden in the trunk. Two hitmen, Charlie and Wesley, come to Betty and Del&#x27;s house. Charlie threatens to scalp Del if he doesn&#x27;t reveal where the drugs are, and Del reveals that he has hidden the drugs in the trunk of a Buick; Wesley then scalps Del after misunderstanding Charlie&#x27;s silent communication. The appalled Charlie shoots Del dead. Betty witnesses the murder and enters a fugue state, assuming the identity of a character in &quot;A Reason to Love&quot; who is a nurse.

That evening, Sheriff Eldon Ballard, local reporter Roy Ostery, and several policemen examine the crime scene while Betty calmly packs a suitcase. She seems nonchalant about the murder, even with the investigation going on right in her house. At the police station, a psychiatrist examines her. Betty spends the night at her friend&#x27;s house, sleeping in a child&#x27;s bedroom. In the middle of the night, she gets into the LeSabre and drives off. She stops at a bar in Williams, Arizona, where the bartender talks about her vacation in Rome; Betty tells her that she was once engaged to a famous surgeon (describing the lead character from &quot;A Reason to Love&quot;). Meanwhile, the two hitmen are in pursuit, having learned that Betty saw Del&#x27;s killing, and having realized that she probably has the car with the drugs. As they search, Charlie&#x27;s heart begins to soften towards Betty, to Wesley&#x27;s consternation.

In Los Angeles, Betty tries to get a job as a nurse while looking for her long-lost &quot;ex-fiancé&quot;. She is turned down because she has no resume or references, but when she saves a young shooting victim&#x27;s life with a technique she learned from the show, the hospital offers her a job in the pharmacy but forbids her to touch any more patients. Despite her position, Betty becomes popular with patients and their families. She ends up living with Rosa, the older sister of the young man she helped earlier, in gratitude for saving his life. Rosa is also a legal secretary and offers to help Betty find her surgeon boyfriend. She learns from a colleague that &quot;David&quot; is a soap opera character, and goes to the pharmacy window to confront Betty. Thinking her friend is jealous, Betty is impervious to the revelation.

Betty&#x27;s lawyer supplies tickets to a charity function where George McCord, the actor portraying David, will be appearing. Betty meets George at the function. George is inclined to dismiss her as an over-imaginative fan, but something about her compels him to talk to her. He begins to think that Betty is an actress determined to get a part in &quot;A Reason to Love&quot;, so he decides to play along. After three hours of her &quot;staying in character&quot;, he takes her home. George begins falling in love with Betty, and he and his producer decide to bring her onto the show as a new character: Nurse Betty. When Betty arrives on set, she falls out of her fantasy world and into real life. After two failed takes, she realizes that she is on a set and that the people she thought were real are just characters. George confronts her and Betty walks out.

Back at Rosa&#x27;s house, Betty is telling her roommate what happened when the two hitmen walk in and take Betty and Rosa hostage at gunpoint. Charlie and Wesley tie up the two women and are subsequently interrupted by Roy and Sheriff Ballard, who have also tracked down Betty. A standoff ensues until Ballard pulls a gun from an ankle holster and shoots Wesley dead, who is revealed to be Charlie&#x27;s son. Charlie decides not to kill Betty and commits suicide in the bathroom. George apologizes to Betty and offers her a job on the show, while Roy and Rosa become a couple. Betty appears in 63 episodes of &quot;A Reason to Love&quot; and takes a vacation in Rome. Betty later plans to pursue nursing as a career.

==Cast==
==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Nurse Betty&quot; received very positive reviews from critics and has a rating of 83% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 131 reviews with an average rating of 7.2/10. The consensus states &quot;Quirky in the best sense of the word, &quot;Nurse Betty&quot; finds director Neil LaBute corralling a talented cast in service of a sharp, imaginative script.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert awarded the film three stars out of four, praising its depth but noting its emotional ambiguity: &quot;&quot;Nurse Betty&quot; is one of those films where you don&#x27;t know whether to laugh or cringe, and find yourself doing both.&quot;

===Box office===
The film opened at #2 at the North American box office making $7.1 million USD in its opening weekend, behind &quot;The Watcher&quot;. The film eventually grossed $25 million at the US box office before generating more than $33 million from US home video rental,
 and turning a substantial profit.

<doc id="733827" wikidata="Q4999307" url="?curid=733827" title="Burlington–Bristol Bridge">
<text>The Burlington–Bristol Bridge is a truss bridge with a lift span crossing the Delaware River from Burlington, New Jersey to Bristol Township, Pennsylvania in the United States. Construction of the bridge started on April 1, 1930, and the bridge opened to traffic on May 2, 1931. The bridge carries New Jersey Route 413 and Pennsylvania Route 413 (PA 413).

The two-lane bridge has a total length of 2,301 feet (701 m), and is operated by the Burlington County Bridge Commission. The lift span is long.

The center span is lifted by the action of two large concrete slabs of slightly greater weight than the lifted span, which block traffic when fully down. They are set in downwards motion to lift the bridge by a very slight action of the motors, as gravity does the rest. In 2016, traffic signals and barrier gates were installed at each end of the bridge for stopping traffic when the draw span is being lifted.

A municipal garage is located underneath the rising road after the tollbooths. During times when the bridge is up for a boat passing underneath, large traffic backups are created on Keim Boulevard, the road that functions as the route to the bridge from U.S. Route 130 (US 130) and Broad Street.

The tollbooths are equipped with E-ZPass and the toll — $4.00 for cars, or $3 with E-ZPass — is paid by vehicles crossing into Pennsylvania.

New bridges for the site have been proposed, but most would require the access ramp to extend out to US 130, which would result in the destruction of historic buildings, as well as the large industrial park near the bridge.

<doc id="733829" wikidata="Q910781" url="?curid=733829" title="James Speed">
<text>James Speed (March 11, 1812 – June 25, 1887) was an American lawyer, politician, and professor who was in 1864 appointed by Abraham Lincoln to be the United States Attorney General. Speed previously served in the Kentucky legislature and in local political offices.

==Early life==
Speed was born in Jefferson County, Kentucky to Judge John Speed and his second wife, Lucy Gilmer Fry. He was a distant descendant of the English cartographer John Speed and brother of Joshua Fry Speed. He graduated from St. Joseph&#x27;s College in Bardstown, Kentucky, studied law at Transylvania University and was admitted to the bar at Louisville, in 1833.

==Career==
In 1841 Speed met fellow lawyer and future President Abraham Lincoln while Lincoln was staying at Farmington, the Speed family home in Louisville, while visiting James&#x27;s brother, Joshua (whom he had befriended while the two lived in Springfield, Illinois). During Lincoln&#x27;s stay, the two lawyers met almost daily to discuss legal matters of the day. James Speed lent Lincoln books from his law library.

Unlike his brother Joshua, James Speed opposed slavery and was active in the Whig Party. In 1847 Speed was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives. At this early point in his career, Speed was already agitating for the emancipation of American slaves. However, Kentucky voters did not share these views, and he failed to win election as delegate to the 1849 Kentucky Constitutional Convention.

From 1851 to 1854, Speed served on the Louisville Board of Aldermen, including two years as its president. He taught as a professor in the Law Department of the University of Louisville from 1856 to 1858, and would later return to teach from 1872 to 1879. He was also a member of the Louisville law firm Stites &amp; Harbison.

===Civil War era===
As the coming Civil War was increasing in likelihood, Speed worked to keep Kentucky in the Union. He also became a commander of the Louisville Home Guard. Elected to the Kentucky Senate in 1861, Speed became the leader of the pro-Union forces. In 1862 he introduced a bill to &quot;confiscate the property&quot; of those supporting the Confederacy in Kentucky.

In December 1864, United States President Abraham Lincoln appointed Speed Attorney General of the United States. After Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, Speed became increasingly associated with the Radical Republicans and advocated allowing male African Americans to vote. Disillusioned with the increasingly conservative policies of former Democratic President Andrew Johnson, Speed resigned from the Cabinet in July 1866 and resumed the practice of law.

===Postwar career===
Speed was a delegate to the National Union Convention in Philadelphia in 1866 and fellow delegates chose him as the convention&#x27;s president. However, Speed&#x27;s racial views were unpopular in Kentucky. Speed ran to become U.S. Senator from Kentucky in 1867, as President Johnson&#x27;s ally Senator James Guthrie (a Unionist and former slaveholder) retired citing health issues. However, voters instead elected Democrat Thomas C. McCreery.

In 1868, Speed ran for the Republican nomination for Vice President of the United States but the convention instead chose Schuyler Colfax.

Speed also ran for U.S. Representative from Kentucky&#x27;s 5th District in 1870, to succeed Democrat Asa Grover, who had been accused of disloyalty but was exonerated and finished his only term. However, voters instead selected Democrat Boyd Winchester to fill the seat. Speed also was a delegate to Republican National Convention from Kentucky in 1872.

He was elected a 3rd class companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States in recognition of his service to the Union during the Civil War.

==Death and legacy==
Speed died in Louisville in 1887, and is interred at Cave Hill Cemetery in that city. His family&#x27;s estate, Farmington, is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and while the farm is substantially reduced in size, the house has been restored and has become a local event venue, and the focus of living history events.

<doc id="733836" wikidata="Q823349" url="?curid=733836" title="Posse (1993 film)">
<text>Posse is a 1993 American Western film directed by and starring Mario Van Peebles. Featuring a large ensemble cast, the film tells the story of a posse of African-American soldiers and one ostracized white soldier, who are all betrayed by a corrupt colonel. The story starts with the group escaping with a cache of gold, and continues with their leader Jesse Lee (Mario Van Peebles) taking revenge on the men who killed his preacher father. The story is presented as a flashback told by an unnamed old man (Woody Strode). The title of the film refers to a group of people who are summoned to help law enforcement officers. This film was the first to be released by Gramercy Pictures.

Melvin Van Peebles, the father of director Mario Van Peebles, recorded a new song, &quot;Cruel Jim Crow&quot;, for the film. This marked his first music recording in 20 years, after his 1974 album &quot;What the...You Mean I Can&#x27;t Sing?!&quot; It led to the production of a new album, &quot;Ghetto Gothic&quot;, released in 1995. The film takes the form of an extended memory, as told by Woody Strode, who witnessed some of the events as a young boy. Strode&#x27;s opening narration, documenting early black settlers, continues his onscreen naming of individuals overlooked by history from the 1972 documentary &quot;Black Rodeo&quot;.

==Plot==

In 1898, convicted prisoner Buffalo Soldiers from the U.S. Army&#x27;s 10th Cavalry Regiment, led by Jesse Lee (Mario Van Peebles), are conscripted to fight in the Spanish–American War in Cuba. As the segregated African-American unit is barely holding its own against constant attacks from enemy troops, Jesse runs back to the command post of the corrupt and racist Colonel Graham (Billy Zane) to request that the 10th Cavalry be allowed to pull back. Colonel Graham orders Jesse to shoot a White prisoner in exchange for allowing the 10th to retreat. Unable to kill a man in cold blood, Jesse demonstrates excellent marksmanship by shooting the man&#x27;s cigar from his mouth. Colonel Graham then kills the prisoner (under the guise of desertion), and offers Jesse&#x27;s command of the 10th to Little J (Stephen Baldwin), another White prisoner (the alternative would be to face the firing squad). Graham then orders the 10th to fall back in order to begin another mission, one in which they will be required to wear civilian clothing, as opposed to their Cavalry uniforms. They are ordered to rob a Spanish gold shipment, which is a setup to give the Colonel an excuse to execute the entire 10th Cavalry as deserters. As he meets them with his own cavalry force, his aide Weezie (Charles Lane) causes a distraction, allowing the 10th to shoot the Colonel and his cavalry down.

With Colonel Graham and his troops supposedly dead, the remnants of the 10th—including Jesse, Obobo (Tiny Lister), Angel (Tone-Lōc) and Little J, along with Weezie sneak out of Cuba and Jesse leads them to New Orleans. Soon after their arrival, Little J meets a gambler named Father Time (Big Daddy Kane) and they begin playing poker, at which point Time is caught cheating. Little J helps the gambler escape and they go back to the hotel room where the others are hiding, telling them &quot;We were never here&quot; in fear that the vengeful gamblers might come for them. Doing just as J feared, the gamblers come in search of him and Father Time, only to be shot in the back by Colonel Graham and his troops, who survived the skirmish in Cuba. Angel is killed in the firefight while Little J, Father Time, and the others barely escape. They meet up with Jesse who had left earlier to finish some business in a town out West.

The newly formed &quot;posse&quot; heads West with Colonel Graham on their heels every step of the way. They eventually stop in a town where Jesse has ammunition custom-made out of gold in order to kill the demons of his past, using one to kill the man who made the ammunition—as he was one of the men who lynched Jesse&#x27;s father King David (Robert Hooks) years earlier. They make their way to Freemanville, a town founded by King David and composed entirely of African-Americans. Jesse is reunited with several old acquaintances, including his good friend Carver (Blair Underwood), who is now the sheriff of Freemanville. Carver&#x27;s deputy goes to Cutterstown, not wanting to tip anyone off that Carver is working with Cutterstown&#x27;s sheriff, Bates (Richard Jordan). He informs Bates that Jesse has returned to Freemanville. The &quot;posse&quot; enjoys the hospitality of Freemanville until Bates tells Carver that the town will burn unless Jesse is turned over to him and his deputies. Bates and a few of his deputies attack Freemanville that same night looking for Jesse. One of the deputies beats Weezie in order to get answers. Watching in disgust, Little J fights back in defense of Weezie. Outnumbered, Little J is kicked and beaten to death by Bates and his men, and Obobo and Jesse&#x27;s former mentor Papa Joe (Melvin Van Peebles) are taken to Cutterstown as prisoners. Jesse and Father Time soon rescue them by posing as Ku Klux Klan members and storming into the Cutterstown jail. Jesse kills one of the deputies, who was another one of King David&#x27;s murderers. When Bates arrive at the jail, he shoots and kills the mayor. Colonel Graham arrives right after and aligns himself with the Sheriff as a fellow &quot;friend&quot; of Jesse.

When Jesse returns, he convinces a handful of townspeople (but not Carver) to fight Sheriff Bates by telling them the Sheriff wants the land for himself to sell to the railroad when it comes through. The citizens of Freemanville fight Bates the next day when he rides in, with Jesse Lee stating that if Freemanville burns, so would Cutterstown before motioning to set off a stick of dynamite. As they begin to gain the upper hand, Colonel Graham arrives with his cavalry and a Gatling gun which he uses to cut the people down. Jesse charges the gun with a stick of dynamite, destroying the gun and killing some of Graham&#x27;s troops while Weezie and Father Time arrive onto the scene.

Meanwhile, Carver plans to flee with the deeds to all of the property in Freemanville—all of which are in his name—but is stopped by Papa Joe&#x27;s daughter Lana (Salli Richardson). Father Time shows up just in time to stop Carver from harming Lana. Time kills one of Carver&#x27;s deputies, but is killed by Carver. Before Carver can flee, he is stopped by Bates who reveals that they had a deal to split the proceeds from the land 50-50. Jesse arrives just in time to hear about the deal, and watches as Carver is betrayed and murdered by Bates. Jesse kills Bates in a showdown, finally putting his past demons to rest. Colonel Graham captures Lana and orders Jesse into the saloon, where they have a climactic fight resulting in Graham&#x27;s death and the destruction of the saloon (which Graham had set ablaze). Jesse, Obobo, Weezie and Lana watch as the townspeople fight the fire.

The story ends almost a century later with an old man (Woody Strode) being interviewed by reporters (Reginald Hudlin, Warrington Hudlin) about the black cowboys of the Old West. The man, who was a young boy when he met Jesse in Freemanville, gives the reporters a small book that Jesse had given him.

In the end, a caption goes on to tell that there had been over 8,000 black cowboys in the Old West whose stories had never been told due to omission by Hollywood and others alike.

==Reception==
The film has a 33% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated: &quot;On the one hand, this obviously talented film maker celebrates all the aggrandizing features of the genre: the laconic tough talk, the manly camaraderie, the proud posturing, the power of walking tall past the awestruck citizenry of a prairie town. On the other hand, &quot;Posse&quot; does its best to reject and avenge what it regards as the flagrant distortions of the past.&quot;

Roger Ebert described it as &quot;an overdirected, overphotographed, overdone movie that is so distracted by its hectic, relentless style that the story line is rendered almost incoherent.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a C+ and said it was &quot;a glossy, kinetic pastiche of Western conventions.&quot;

<text>Karen Armstrong (born 14 November 1944) is a British author and commentator known for her books on comparative religion. A former Roman Catholic religious sister, she went from a conservative to a more liberal and mystical Christian faith. She attended St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford, while in the convent and graduated in English. She left the convent in 1969. Her work focuses on commonalities of the major religions, such as the importance of compassion and the Golden Rule.

Armstrong received the US$100,000 TED Prize in February 2008. She used that occasion to call for the creation of a Charter for Compassion, which was unveiled the following year.

==Personal life==
Armstrong was born at Wildmoor, Worcestershire, into a family of Irish ancestry who, after her birth, moved to Bromsgrove and later to Birmingham. In 1962, at the age of 17, she became a member of the Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus, a teaching congregation, in which she remained for seven years. Armstrong says she suffered physical and psychological abuse in the convent; according to an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, &quot;Armstrong was required to mortify her flesh with whips and wear a spiked chain around her arm. When she spoke out of turn, she claims she was forced to sew at a treadle machine with no needle for a fortnight.&quot;

Once she had advanced from postulant and novice to professed nun, she enrolled in St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford, to study English. Armstrong left her order in 1969 while still a student at Oxford. After graduating with a Congratulatory First, she embarked on a DPhil on the poet Alfred Tennyson. According to Armstrong, she wrote her dissertation on a topic that had been approved by the university committee. Nevertheless, it was failed by her external examiner on the grounds that the topic had been unsuitable. Armstrong did not formally protest this verdict, nor did she embark upon a new topic but instead abandoned hope of an academic career. She reports that this period in her life was marked by ill-health stemming from her lifelong but, at that time, still undiagnosed temporal lobe epilepsy.

Around this time she was lodged with Jenifer and Herbert Hart, looking after their disabled son, as told in her memoir &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot;.

Armstrong is unmarried.

Although she had once described herself as a &quot;freelance monotheist,&quot; more recently she said, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t even call myself a monotheist anymore. ... If anything, I&#x27;m a Confucian, I think.&quot;

==Career==
In 1976, Armstrong took a job teaching English at James Allen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School in Dulwich while working on a memoir of her convent experiences. This was published in 1982 as &quot;Through the Narrow Gate&quot; to excellent reviews. That year she embarked on a new career as an independent writer and broadcasting presenter. In 1984, the British Channel Four commissioned her to write and present a television documentary on the life of St. Paul, &quot;The First Christian&quot;, a project that involved traveling to the Holy Land to retrace the steps of the saint. Armstrong described this visit as a &quot;breakthrough experience&quot; that defied her prior assumptions and provided the inspiration for virtually all her subsequent work. In &quot;A History of God: The 4,000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity and Islam&quot; (1993), she traces the evolution of the three major monotheistic traditions from their beginnings in the Middle East up to the present day and also discusses Hinduism and Buddhism. As guiding &quot;luminaries&quot; in her approach, Armstrong acknowledges (in &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot; and elsewhere) the late Canadian theologian Wilfred Cantwell Smith, a Protestant minister, and the Jesuit father Bernard Lonergan. In 1996, she published &quot;Jerusalem: One City, Three Faiths&quot;.

Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;The Great Transformation: The Beginning of Our Religious Traditions&quot; (2006) continues the themes covered in &quot;A History of God&quot; and examines the emergence and codification of the world&#x27;s great religions during the so-called Axial Age identified by Karl Jaspers. In the year of its publication Armstrong was invited to choose her eight favourite records for BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; programme. She has made several appearances on television, including on Rageh Omaar&#x27;s programme &quot;The Life of Muhammad&quot;. Her work has been translated into forty-five languages. She was an advisor for the award-winning, PBS-broadcast documentary &quot;&quot; (2002), produced by Unity Productions Foundation.

In 2007 the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore invited Armstrong to deliver the MUIS Lecture.

Armstrong is a fellow of the Jesus Seminar, a group of scholars and laypeople which attempts to investigate the historical foundations of Christianity. She has written numerous articles for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and for other publications. She was a key advisor on Bill Moyers&#x27; popular PBS series on religion, has addressed members of the United States Congress, and was one of three scholars to speak at the UN&#x27;s first ever session on religion. She is a vice-president of the British Epilepsy Association, otherwise known as Epilepsy Action.

Armstrong, who has taught courses at Leo Baeck College, a rabbinical college and centre for Jewish education located in North London, says she has been particularly inspired by the Jewish tradition&#x27;s emphasis on practice as well as faith: &quot;I say that religion isn&#x27;t about believing things. It&#x27;s about what you do. It&#x27;s ethical alchemy. It&#x27;s about behaving in a way that changes you, that gives you intimations of holiness and sacredness.&quot; She maintains that religious fundamentalism is not just a response to, but is a product of contemporary culture and for this reason concludes that, &quot;We urgently need to make compassion a clear, luminous and dynamic force in our polarized world. Rooted in a principled determination to transcend selfishness, compassion can break down political, dogmatic, ideological and religious boundaries. Born of our deep interdependence, compassion is essential to human relationships and to a fulfilled humanity. It is the path to enlightenment, and indispensable to the creation of a just economy and a peaceful global community.&quot;

Awarded the $100,000 TED Prize in February 2008, Armstrong called for drawing up a &quot;Charter for Compassion&quot;, in the spirit of the Golden Rule, to identify shared moral priorities across religious traditions, in order to foster global understanding and a peaceful world. It was presented in Washington, D.C. in November 2009. Signatories include Queen Noor of Jordan, the Dalai Lama, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Paul Simon.

In 2012, the Jack P. Blaney Award for Dialogue recognized her outstanding achievement in advancing understanding about and among world religions, and promoting compassion as a way of life. During her award residency in Canada, Armstrong gave the &quot;State of the Charter for Compassion Global Address&quot; and co-launched a compassionate cities initiative in Vancouver.

==Honours==
In 1999 Armstrong received the Muslim Public Affairs Council&#x27;s Media Award.

Armstrong was honoured by the New York Open Center in 2004 for her &quot;profound understanding of religious traditions and their relation to the divine.&quot;

She received an honorary degree as Doctor of Letters by Aston University in 2006.

In May 2008 she was awarded the Freedom of Worship Award by the Roosevelt Institute, one of four medals presented each year to men and women whose achievements have demonstrated a commitment to the Four Freedoms proclaimed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941 as essential to democracy: freedom of speech and of worship, freedom from want and from fear. The institute stated that Armstrong had become &quot;a significant voice, seeking mutual understanding in times of turbulence, confrontation and violence among religious groups.&quot; It cited &quot;her personal dedication to the ideal that peace can be found in religious understanding, for her teachings on compassion, and her appreciation for the positive sources of spirituality.&quot;

She also received the TED Prize 2008.

In 2009 she was awarded the Dr. Leopold Lucas Prize by the University of Tübingen.

Armstrong was honoured with the Nationalencyklopedin&#x27;s International Knowledge Award 2011 &quot;for her long standing work of bringing knowledge to others about the significance of religion to humankind and, in particular, for pointing out the similarities between religions. Through a series of books and award-winning lectures she reaches out as a peace-making voice at a time when world events are becoming increasingly linked to religion.&quot;

On 12 May 2010, she was made honorary Doctor of Divinity by Queen&#x27;s University (Kingston, Ontario).

On 30 November 2011 (Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day), Armstrong was made honorary Doctor of Letters by the University of Saint Andrews.

On 20 March 2012, Karen Armstrong was awarded the 2011/12 Jack P. Blaney Award for Dialogue for her work in advancing understanding about and among world religions.

In 2013, she was awarded the Nayef Al-Rodhan Prize for Global Cultural Understanding by the British Academy &quot;in recognition of her body of work that has made a significant contribution to understanding the elements of overlap and commonality in different cultures and religions&quot;.

On 3 June 2014, she was made an honorary Doctor of Divinity by McGill University.

In 2017 Armstrong was bestowed Princess of Asturias award in recognition of her investigations into world religions.

==Reception==
Armstrong was described by philosopher Alain de Botton as &quot;one of the most intelligent contemporary defenders of religion&quot;, who &quot;wages a vigorous war on the twin evils of religious fundamentalism and militant atheism&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; referred to her as &quot;a prominent and prolific religious historian&quot;. Laura Miller of &quot;Salon&quot; described her as &quot;arguably the most lucid, wide-ranging and consistently interesting religion writer today&quot;. Juan Eduardo Campo, author of the &quot;Encyclopedia of Islam&quot; (2009), included Armstrong among a group of scholars who he claimed currently conveyed a &quot;more or less objective&quot;, as opposed to polemical, view of Islam and its origins to a wide public. After the 11 September attacks she was in great demand as a lecturer, pleading for inter-faith dialogue.

Armstrong has been criticized as misunderstanding theology and medieval history, especially in conservative publications &quot;First Things&quot; and &quot;National Review&quot;.

<doc id="733846" wikidata="Q31378" url="?curid=733846" title="M. Bison">
<text>M. Bison, also known as in Japan, is a fictional character and the main antagonist of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series created by Capcom. First introduced in &quot;Street Fighter II: The World Warrior&quot; (1991) as the final boss of the game, he has since become a recurring character in the series, often serving as both a boss and a playable character.

A would-be world dictator and megalomaniac, M. Bison&#x27;s ultimate ambition is to control the world&#x27;s governments through his covert crime syndicate, . He hosts &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;″s fighting tournament and is the last opponent fought in the game. Throughout the series, several characters — including, Guile, T. Hawk, Cammy, Rose and Chun-Li — have their personal vendettas against M. Bison and have entered the tournament in the hopes of facing him personally, while M. Bison routinely sets his eyes on the series&#x27; main protagonist Ryu in order to either acquire his power or recruit him for his cause. M. Bison wields an inherently evil energy known as &quot;Psycho Power&quot;, in contrast to Ryu and Ken&#x27;s &quot;Hadou&quot;.

Despite not appearing until the release of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, Bison is widely considered to be the most iconic antagonist of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series, having served as the main villain of the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; series and &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, and having acted as the force behind the events of both the &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; series, where the main villain, Seth, is revealed to have been Bison&#x27;s unwitting pawn all along, and &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, where he is resurrected and it is revealed that the main villain, JP, was his successor.

In a variety of media, Bison has been portrayed by Raul Julia, Neal McDonough and Silvio Simac and voiced by Tom Wyner, Richard Newman and Gerald C. Rivers. Julia was nominated for a posthumous Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance.

==Conception and development==
In Japan, the character is named , derived from the star of the same name. However, during localization of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; for the English language market, Capcom&#x27;s North American branch felt that the name did not sound threatening enough to North American audiences for the game&#x27;s final boss, and thus was more suitable for the Spanish cage fighter. At this same time, another concern arose that the name of another character, Mike Bison, conceived as a parody of real-life boxer Mike Tyson, would be a legal liability for Capcom. As a result, the characters&#x27; names were changed, and the game&#x27;s final boss was dubbed M. Bison for international appearances of the character. Though the &quot;M&quot; originally stood for &quot;Mike&quot; in Japan (for the boxer character), Capcom has never explained what it stands for in Western releases, calling it &quot;part of the character&#x27;s mystery&quot;. The story of &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; acknowledged this change within the context of its narrative, claiming that all three names were aliases that Shadaloo&#x27;s leadership operated under to protect their true identities.

When developing &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;, it was decided to give him a more muscular appearance, rather than have him resemble &quot;a middle aged man&quot;, while his face was modified to appear somewhat demonic. This appearance was later carried onto the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; series, featured as his original appearance before the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; series.

The first source of inspiration for M. Bison&#x27;s design came from the character General Washizaki, one of the main villains of the popular martial arts manga &quot;Riki-Oh&quot;. Additionally, Yasunori Katō, a fictional character appeared in the &quot;Teito Monogatari&quot; series and other productions such as the &quot;Yokai Monsters&quot;, served as another inspiration source for M. Bison.

For &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, Takayuki Nakayama and the rest of the staff began to design M. Bison after the main cast were completed. His return to the franchise was planned for some time, and there were many voices on the staff calling for Bison to return; producer Shuhei Matsumoto, for instance, has been a regular Bison player since &quot;Super Street Fighter IV&quot;. Nakayama noted that the team planned to portray Bison in a different light for this entry, since the character JP is the villain for this instalment; his arcade mode delves further into this new characterization. His gameplay was also altered for his latest appearance, with his supernatural techniques being removed in favour of a more hand-to-hand approach.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Street Fighter&quot; series===
Bison first appears in &quot;Street Fighter II: The World Warrior&quot; as the final computer-controlled opponent in the single-player mode, following the player&#x27;s defeat of the other three Grand Masters. The battle takes place at a temple in Bangkok, Thailand. He became a playable character from &quot;Champion Edition&quot; and onward, while maintaining his position as the final boss until &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot;, in which a hidden character named Akuma defeats Bison and challenges the player as an alternate final boss. The storyline through the numerous versions of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; characterizes Bison as the leader of a criminal organization called &quot;Shadaloo&quot; who sponsors the World Warrior tournament.

Bison later appears in the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; trilogy, a prequel to the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; series. In &quot;Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors&#x27; Dreams&quot;, Bison appears as the final boss for certain characters and a hidden playable character available via a code. &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot;, has Bison featured in this game as a playable character without any cheat codes required. In &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot;, released in 1998, a powered-up version of M. Bison serves as the final boss of the game. He is the final boss for every character in the game except for Evil Ryu, whose final boss is Shin Akuma, and his final opponent is Ryu himself. Several revelations are made in this game, including the fact that Rose is the good half of Bison&#x27;s soul and the fact that Cammy is a female clone of Bison. In the canonical story of &quot;Alpha 3&quot;, Bison is revealed to be dying due to the strain of Psycho Power on his body and the only thing keeping him alive is his Psycho Drive, which brings him to search for Ryu, whose body he has deemed worthy of possession due to Ryu&#x27;s struggles against the Dark Hadou, which Bison believes will sustain him. In the story, depicted in more than one ending, Bison fights Ryu and very nearly possesses him, but Ryu is able to counter Bison&#x27;s Psycho Power with his Hadou and ultimately overcomes the warlord. Before he can be destroyed, Bison transfers his soul into Rose&#x27;s body, rendering her unconscious before his body disintegrates.

The &quot;Street Fighter IV Training Guide&quot; reveals that Bison was destroyed by Akuma&#x27;s Shun Goku Satsu and now inhabits a new body created for him by his scientists. Unlike his previous bodies, this one is capable of withstanding the full strength of his Psycho Power. In &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, the main villain is Seth, an android previously created for Bison&#x27;s soul to inhabit but went rogue and usurped the leadership of S.I.N., a subsidiary of Shadaloo. It is later revealed, however, that Bison is actually the true mastermind behind the game&#x27;s events, and was secretly manipulating Seth to further his own agendas before revealing himself again. Ryu eventually destroys Seth once and for all, unknowingly allowing Bison to retake control of Shadaloo. Bison also appears in the sequels/updates, &quot;Super Street Fighter IV&quot; and &quot;Ultra Street Fighter IV&quot;.

Bison appears in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, set between &quot;IV&quot; and &quot;III&quot;. Shadaloo enacts a plan known as &quot;Operation C.H.A.I.N.S.&quot; in which seven artificial satellites known as the &quot;Black Moons&quot; are constructed to cause various cities around the world to lose power, thereby creating commotion which fuels Bison&#x27;s Psycho Power due to negative emotions. When the plan is ultimately foiled, a resurrected Charlie Nash sacrifices himself to weaken Bison, leaving Ryu to fight him one last time. After a fierce battle, Ryu finishes Bison once and for all with the Power of Nothingness, and his body seemingly disintegrates. After his presumed death, a ghost empowered by Psycho Power of himself called Phantom Bison is mostly shown haunting both of his former vessels, Falke and particularly Ed.

Bison returns in &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; via downloadable content, where he previously was revealed to have bestowed Psycho Power to JP prior to Shadaloo&#x27;s downfall. Bison&#x27;s depiction is a departure from previous appearances, and he has both developed amnesia, and scars on his upper right half because of the Power of Nothingness&#x27; effect caused by Ryu during their last encounter. Bison also reveals to have saved a dying male horse by imbuing him with Psycho Power at Nayshall. Sometimes after the World Tour&#x27;s base game storyline, and following his encounter with Juri, who told him what the previous Bison was like, the amnesiac Bison decides to retake the name he once lost, and absorbs Phantom Bison to become whole again at a hidden ruined lab where Shadaloo remnants are currently hiding. It was also revealed in his World Tour that his pupil, Rose was present watching M. Bison murder their master, after Bison himself discarded the Soul Power over his newly achieved Psycho Power.

===Other games===
Bison appears in &quot;Street Fighter: The Movie&quot;, a 1995 video game adaptation of the 1994 film. The game looks similar to early &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games, due to each character being represented by digitized sprites of the film&#x27;s actors Bison&#x27;s fight animations were performed by Australian stuntman Darko Tuscan. Film clips of Juliá as Bison are included within the game&#x27;s cutscenes.

In &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot;, and &quot;Street Fighter EX2 Plus&quot;, Bison serves as a boss. In &quot;Street Fighter EX3&quot;, he gains a tag-team super move when paired with Vega. He also often featured in the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; but noticeably absent from &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes&quot;, though he appears in Chun-Li and Shadow Lady&#x27;s ending sequences. In &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes&quot; (2000), the &quot;Alpha&quot; version of Bison is once again a playable character, though he must be unlocked. M. Bison does not appear in &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds&quot;, but he is mentioned by Chun-Li in one of her win quotes, and in &quot;Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot;, one of Wesker&#x27;s alternate colors is based on M. Bison&#x27;s design. M. Bison also makes a cameo appearance in Dormammu&#x27;s ending in &quot;UMVC3&quot;. Bison reappears in the &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot; series, with an appearance that resembled his original &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; sprite instead of &quot;Alpha&quot; ones. He has regularly appeared in each entry of the series, beginning with &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium&quot; (1999) and its sequels, &quot;Capcom vs. SNK Pro: Millennium Fight 2000&quot; and &quot;Capcom vs. SNK 2&quot; (2001). For &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot; Bison with Geese are the penultimate boss encounter or last battle if the player lost their rival battle that takes place before the tourney&#x27;s final. Bison also appears as a trading card in the handheld collectible card game &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash&quot; (1999) and &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos&quot; (2003).

Bison appears in &quot;Capcom Fighting Jam&quot; (2004), which features an assortment of characters from each individual series published by Capcom. In the game, Bison is part of the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; roster. Other roles include the Japanese action/tactical RPG hybridm &quot;Namco × Capcom&#x27;, &quot;Project X Zone 2&quot; and,&quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot;, with Juri as his official tag partner. Alternate versions of Bison often appear as a stronger boss in games he is included.

==In other media==
===Live action===
====&quot;Street Fighter (1994)&quot;====

Raúl Juliá played Bison in the 1994 live-action film adaption of the series. Julia perceived Bison in the same vein of villain as Richard III, and approached the role with a Shakespearean tone. In the film, Bison is a British psychopathic drug kingpin and notorious military dictator who controls not only Shadaloo (here depicted as his hostile dictatorship instead of his organization) but also the drug industry with an iron fist. One of his goals in the film is to produce supersoldiers to take over the world and establish a new order known as &quot;Pax Bisonica&quot; using his drug profits. His ambitions have led to a war in Shadaloo with the Allied Nations (AN), led by Colonel Guile, the movie&#x27;s main character who has been sent to place Bison under arrest for his war crimes. In the film, while Ryu plays a vital role in Bison&#x27;s downfall by helping to lure Guile to Bison&#x27;s base, Bison and Ryu do not fight, though at one point, Ryu attempts to fight Bison alongside Ken, Chun-Li, E. Honda and Balrog. In the climax, he fights Guile and very nearly kills him with his uniform&#x27;s built-in electromagnetism (the film&#x27;s stand-in for Bison&#x27;s Psycho Power), but he is defeated when Guile kicks him into his gigantic monitor screen and leaves him to die when the base explodes. A post-credits scene only available on the home-video release shows Bison resurrected through a solar-powered life support machine.

For the role, Raúl Juliá studied the lives and personalities of various dictators and drug lords, and as such mimicked many of their hand movements and body language to incorporate into the M. Bison character, most notably Benito Mussolini&#x27;s hand gestures, Joseph Stalin&#x27;s mannerisms and strict demeanor, Adolf Hitler&#x27;s love and passion for arts and crafts, and Pablo Escobar&#x27;s elusiveness. Other dictators and drug lords incorporated by Juliá include Fidel Castro, Muammar Gaddafi, Idi Amin, and Saddam Hussein.

The film was Julia&#x27;s final role before his death, and a dedication to him is included in the end credits. Julia claimed in an interview that he accepted the role for his children, who were huge fans of the games, helped him prepare for the role and were on set with him each day of filming. Although the film was largely panned by critics and fans, Juliá&#x27;s performance was singled out for acclaim and is widely considered by fans and critics to be the greatest video game movie performance of all time. Julia was nominated for a posthumous Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor, which he lost to Gary Sinise for &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;.

In the Japanese dub of the film, he is still called &quot;M. Bison&quot; as opposed to &quot;Vega&quot;, his name in the original Japanese versions of the series, as the film was a mostly American production, and Bison, Balrog and Vega were all named onscreen with their American names.

This version of Bison appears in the arcade game based on the film, &quot;Street Fighter: The Movie&quot;, as well as in the home video game bearing the same title. In the home version, he is the main antagonist of the Movie Battle mode, and a non-playable super-powered version of him serves as the final boss. He also serves as the final opponent in the Street Battle mode, following Zangief, Dee Jay and Sagat, even if one plays as Bison himself. In his ending, he is said to have crushed Colonel Guile in personal combat and defeated his AN Forces, and subsequently brought the world under the control of his Pax Bisonica empire. In the game, Bison is physically portrayed by Darko Tuscan, who served as Raúl Juliá&#x27;s stunt double in the film, and cutscenes of Juliá as Bison are shown throughout the game. Out of respect for Juliá, Bison is the only character in the game whose actor is left unnamed.

This version of Bison is perhaps best remembered for his line &quot;For you, the day Bison graced your village, was the most important day of your life. But for me, it was Tuesday.&quot; The line is very popular with Street Fighter fans and is often referenced.

Pakistani rapper and music producer Adil Omar has also incorporated an M Bison alter-ego inspired by Juliá&#x27;s portrayal, most notably in his music video for &quot;Mastery&quot;. He has also named his Islamabad studio Bisonopolis.

====&quot;Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li (2009)&quot;====
Neal McDonough portrayed Bison in &quot;Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li&quot;. He appears as the main antagonist once again, this time opposite Chun-Li. The film shows Bison donning a business suit rather than his signature costume and is depicted as a crime boss and secret drug kingpin disguised as a Thailand-based multilingual Irish international businessman instead of a military man, although he is also shown to be in charge of his own paramilitary force. In a backstory told by Gen, Bison was abandoned by his Irish missionary parents in Thailand when he was an infant and lived his entire life engaging in acts of theft. He then sacrificed his pregnant wife in the bowels of a supernatural cave, where he imbued his daughter, Rose, with the goodness of his soul, thus ridding himself of any sense of conscience. Bison&#x27;s raw physical power is seen to borderline on supernatural, as he usually only required one punch or kick to send an opponent hurtling through the air. His power is first exhibited during his introduction where his spiritual energy was so immense, it heralded his arrival by a soft breeze inside Chun-Li&#x27;s family manor. He is killed at the end of the film in front of his daughter when Chun-Li twists his head around by use of her legs.

&quot;Shadaloo&quot; as it is referred to, is a multi-leveled criminal syndicate which is a plutarchy of an unknown number of powerful crime families that have connections ranging from the locale mafiosos of the countries to even factions of the government (in the film&#x27;s current case, the department of commerce). Though Bison&#x27;s full goals are not divulged, his first order of business is to buy up an entire waterfront district and restructure it specifically for the wealthy and elite, thus further adding to the funding of his operations. He first appears as a simple mob head, only to skyrocket through the ranks after killing off a number of allied families and usurping their power for himself. He is depicted as being uncomfortably upbeat about everything, as he usually reveals shortly afterward that he is in control of almost every element of espionage and intrigue he is involved with. There is a moderately less supernatural background with Bison than there was with his video game and anime counterparts.

====&quot;Street Fighter: Resurrection&quot;====
Silvio Simac portrayed Bison in &quot;Street Fighter: Resurrection&quot; appearing in the final episode observing Ryu, Ken, Laura and Nash through a battered Decapre&#x27;s eyes while sitting down on his throne behind a massive spherical object before burning a chess piece with his Psycho Power and proclaiming that he shall let them come.

====&quot;Street Fighter: World Warrior&quot;====
M. Bison is set to appear in &quot;Street Fighter: World Warrior&quot; as the primary villain.

====&quot;Power Rangers: Legacy Wars&quot; (Live action short)====
Actor Kevin Porter portrays M. Bison in this official crossover between &quot;Power Rangers&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter&quot; with the famous YouTube channel &quot;Bat in the Sun&quot; filming and being produced by Hasbro, Allspark Pictures, nWay Games, and Saban as a promotion for the popular mobile game. Also starring Jason David Frank as Tommy Oliver (MMPR Green Ranger, MMPR White Ranger, Zeo Red Ranger, Turbo Red Ranger, Dino Thunder Black Ranger), Ciarra Hanna as Gia Moran (Megaforce Yellow), and Peter Jang as Ryu (RuyRanger).

===Animation===
====&quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;====
Bison is the main antagonist of the anime film &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;, voiced by Takeshi Kusaka in the Japanese version and the late Tom Wyner in the English dub with a Trans-Atlantic accent. Bison&#x27;s organization, Shadaloo (here named &quot;Shadowlaw&quot;), is stated as being an international terrorist organization, employing a great deal of scientific technology, including cyborgs (known as &quot;Monitor Cyborgs&quot;) which pose as humans while broadcasting live images to Bison. As in the games, the &quot;M&quot; in his name is not revealed, although his scientist, Senoh, refers to him as &quot;Master Bison&quot;. Intrigued by Ryu&#x27;s fighting skills after seeing him defeat Sagat, Bison orders a nationwide manhunt to capture and brainwash him to work for Shadowlaw, but after failing to locate him, he abducts and brainwashes Ken in his stead, while instructing Vega to assassinate Chun-Li. In the film&#x27;s climax, Bison enters the battlefield by setting Ken on Ryu and fighting Guile. He defeats but spares Guile as an insult, just as Ken manages to overcome Bison&#x27;s brainwashing. Bison disposes of Ken and faces Ryu, toying with the warrior when he refuses Bison&#x27;s offer to work under him for Shadaloo. Ken recovers and Bison fights both Ryu and Ken hand-to-hand, and is defeated when he is struck with a combined Hadoken. Bison survives the attack, however, and reappears in the film&#x27;s final scene, driving a truck towards Ryu, who prepares to fight Bison again as the film ends.

====&quot;Street Fighter II V&quot;====
Bison appears in the second half of the anime series &quot;Street Fighter II V&quot;. In the ADV Films dub, he is voiced by Markham Anderson and then later on by Mike Kleinhenz, while Tom Wyner reprises his role from the animated movie for the Animaze English dub. In the series, he sports a dark blue uniform instead of his traditional red one. He is still the leader of Shadowlaw, which now has numerous subdivisions, such as the Ashura Syndicate under his associate, Mr. Zochi but has no major history with Guile nor Chun-Li as opposed to other versions. When Ashura is destroyed by Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Fei-Long and Inspector Dorai (Chun-Li&#x27;s father), Bison orders Dorai murdered and Ken kidnapped and held ransom after witnessing him defeat Vega in a very dramatic fashion, and later sends his henchman, Zangief, to capture Ryu, whom Bison had seen on the beach practicing Hadou, and have him brainwashed into becoming his enforcer and surrogate son. In the meantime, Bison succeeds in brainwashing both Chun-Li and Ryu and setting them on Guile and Ken, respectively, after killing Charlie Nash after a botched rescue. In the end, Ken manages to break Bison&#x27;s control on Ryu, and the two take on Bison. Bison, clearly the superior fighter, easily handles both Ryu and Ken, until they discover that Bison can be damaged with their Hadou powers. Ken is knocked unconscious while Ryu battles on. Bison prepares to finish off Ryu with a Psycho Crusher, but is intercepted by Ken using his Hadou Shoryu. Ken&#x27;s strength is depleted and Ryu takes on Bison one-on-one, who is still not fully recovered from Ken&#x27;s attack. Ryu uses a series of moves to defeat a defenseless Bison. As Bison prepares a final Psycho Crusher, Ryu counters with a Hadouken, which hits Bison square in the chest and presumably destroys him.

====&quot;Street Fighter&quot; (US cartoon)====
Voiced by Richard Newman, Bison&#x27;s portrayal in the American &quot;Street Fighter&quot; animated series is considerably close to his portrayal in both the live-action film and significant aspects of the video game. His primary nemesis is Guile, as in the movie. In the first season, Bison&#x27;s attack on Chun-Li&#x27;s village (referenced in the live-action film), appears in a flashback, revealing how he killed Chun-Li&#x27;s father, who attacked him in futile defiance. Bison later reveals to a vengeful Chun-Li that he also murdered his own father in cold blood. The second season explored Bison&#x27;s relationship with Cammy in the same manner as the games and the anime movie, with Cammy being triggered as a &quot;sleeper agent&quot; in the opening episodes. She discovers that Bison had murdered her parents after discovering they were MI5 agents and brainwashed her into becoming a sleeper agent in the series finale, but not before she reestablishes her romantic bond with him. Bison seems to worship a Thai deity that instructs him on what to do with his resources, and in the finale, Bison convinces himself he has been told to destroy the Earth through the launching of nuclear missiles. Bison eventually engages Guile in a showdown which concludes when Guile, in a manner reminiscent of the 1994 film, kicks Bison into a computer and fires a sonic boom at him, unleashing a strong magnetic force that pulls Bison into the computer, which explodes afterwards, destroying him completely.

====&quot;Street Fighter&quot; (UDON comics)====
Bison is heavily featured as the primary antagonist of the UDON-published &quot;Street Fighter&quot; comic series. His story is mostly unchanged from the official version, portraying him as the dark and sinister leader of Shadaloo. He operates behind a veil of various agents and associates who do his bidding as well as having numerous enemies (such as Chun-Li and Guile). Bison is the student of a mysterious woman whose tribe has mastered the art of Soul Power. After being exiled from further training, he studies the forbidden texts of their people and learns the nature of Psycho Power, the negative half of Soul Power. He returns to her later in life and uses this power to massacre his mentor&#x27;s tribe, leaving only one survivor (Rose). Like the official story, Bison has a great interest in Ryu after watching him defeat Sagat at the last Street Fighter tournament and observing the nature of the &quot;Satsui no Hadō&quot;. At the end of the first series of comics, Bison is defeated in a battle with his own creation (Charlie, who had been empowered with Shadaloo technology) when Charlie sacrifices himself to plunge Bison into a river. Bison survives the fall and his body is reanimated with the Psycho Drive, whereupon he resumes his role as Shadaloo dictator. As the comic moves forward, Bison announces his &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; tournament, the second global gathering of martial artists, and is documented in the &quot;Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; series of comics. The tournament itself runs smoothly up until what would have been the final battle between Ryu and Bison. At this point, Akuma intervenes (much like the official story) and demands a fight with Ryu. Bison senses the amount of great power Akuma carries and attempts to subdue him in combat, only to be halted by Rose&#x27;s spirit who restrains him while Akuma delivers the final blow and seals Bison&#x27;s soul for good.

====&quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;====
M. Bison makes a cameo appearance in the Disney film &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot; with Gerald C. Rivers reprising his role from &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; onwards.

==Reception==
Since he appeared in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, M. Bison has received mostly positive reception. IGN praised his role as a villain in the series that did not rely solely on his henchmen. IGN described him as a formidable boss and one who has endured for years as a mainstay in the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series. &quot;GamePro&quot; stated &quot;This guy had the nerve to look you dead in the face, threaten your very soul and then tell you he represents an organization called Shadaloo. That&#x27;s brave, man.&quot; &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; listed M. Bison as 17th in their list of top 50 Villains. GameDaily regarded him as one of the best end bosses ever. &quot;Digital Spy&quot; said Bison is a great villain due to his multiple antagonism with the rest of the cast to the point his chaos is irredeemable. GamesRadar said M. Bison was one of the most infuriating opponents imaginable. In 2014, Capcom UK named M. Bison the &quot;4th Most Powerful Street Fighter Character&quot;, while in 2016, Screen Rant named M. Bison the &quot;3rd Most Powerful Street Fighter Character&quot;, stating &quot;As the main antagonist of the series, it&#x27;s only natural M. Bison would also be one of the most powerful characters of the franchise—he&#x27;s even proven capable of getting the better of Ryu.&quot;

Some sites like GameDaily enjoyed his characterization, describing him as one of the most &quot;vile, powerful end bosses ever put into a video game&quot;. He was also 2nd in GamesRadar&#x27;s &quot;The 12 most misunderstood videogame villains&quot; with comments on the various sub-stories Bison is involved in the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; staff described M. Bison as the best villain in video games, stating that &quot;Vega, Master Bison, Dictator - no matter what you call him, anyone who harnesses the destructive might of Psycho Power energy has got to be bad news.&quot; 1UP.com listed him as of the characters they wanted to see in &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot;. Paste considered him a &quot;Saturday morning cartoon villain of the Street Fighter series, and for the most part, it works.&quot; Meanwhile, Den of Geek comments &quot;Bison is so sinister that he literally made himself purely evil through magic just so he wouldn&#x27;t be distracted by his conscience&quot; and praised his fighting styleUGO Networks highlighted that since Bison&#x27;s true goal is to oppress the world for his own selfish benefit, making him &quot;only villain&quot; in the story. GameSpot listed him at number five on its &quot;Top 10 Video Game Villains&quot; list, stating a preference for his attack set while bemoaning his portrayal in the live action film.

Bison&#x27;s return in &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; was criticized by &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; for ruining the story of the previous installment where Ryu kills the villain, leading the heroes to move on with their lives. &quot;Inverse&quot;felt the character&#x27;s revival in &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; was similar to how &quot;Tekken 8&quot; revived the villain Heihachi Mishima as if they never have a real death in the narrative. He has also been Gen besides Heihachi due to their portrayals as in the games. Bleeding Cool also criticized the character&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; to the point of wondering whether or not he was the real villain famous in the franchise. &quot;Tech Radar&quot; referred to Bison&#x27;s design as the &quot;most radical&quot; change in the entire cast as he looks very different from his classic look especially when compared to other redesigns &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; characters are given but his special moves were still praised.

Nicholas Ware in a dissertation titled &quot;You Must Defeat Sheng Long to Stand a Chance&quot; noted M. Bison was surprisingly more muscular and taller in the &quot;Alpha&quot; games when compared to the hero Ryu. His appearance also stands out for lack pupils in his eyes similar to Akuma and Sagat which emphasizes their antagonistic personalities. This comes as a result of the developers&#x27; desire to make the players motivated to defeat such nemesis. However, they are overshadowed by Akuma in an alternate narrative where he comes across as a hidden boss who plays a major role in the corruption of Ryu. Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said the live-action film was &quot;notable only for being the last film made by Raúl Juliá, an actor far too skilled for the demands of the evil warlord, Gen. M. Bison, but far too professional to give anything less than his best.&quot;

M. Bison artwork was featured on an officially licensed NubyTech/UDON joypad for the Xbox, announced on May 25, 2005.

<text>Henrietta Emma Litchfield (née Darwin; 25 September 1843 – 17 December 1927) was a daughter of Charles Darwin and his wife Emma Wedgwood.

Henrietta was born at Down House, Downe, Kent, in 1843. She was Darwin&#x27;s third daughter and the eldest daughter to reach adulthood after the eldest, Annie, died aged 10, and a second daughter, Mary, died before she was a month old. She and her brother Frank helped their father with his work, and Henrietta helped edit &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;. 

On 31 August 1871, she married Richard Buckley Litchfield, who was born in Yarpole, near Leominster, in 1832; the couple had no children. She was widowed on 11 January 1903, when Richard died in Cannes, France; he was buried in the English Cemetery, Cannes.

<text>Lisa Robin Kelly (March 5, 1970 – August 15, 2013) was an American actress. She was best known for her role as Laurie Forman on the TV series &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;.

==Early life==
Kelly was born in Southington, Connecticut, and raised there and in Mooresville, North Carolina. Her parents are Thomas Carl Kelly and Linda Diane (née Grimm) Kelly. She earned a BFA in acting from The Theatre School at DePaul University in Chicago in 1992.

==Career==
Kelly made her debut in the 1992 &quot;Married... with Children&quot; episode &quot;Kelly Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;. She appeared again in 1994 in episodes of &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot;, the &quot;X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Syzygy&quot; from its third season, and on &quot;Charmed&quot; in 1999, as well as in direct-to-video and television films such as &quot;Amityville Dollhouse&quot;, &quot;Late Last Night&quot; and the theatrical film &quot;Jawbreaker&quot;.

Kelly played Laurie Forman, the older sister of Eric Forman, on &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;. She abruptly left the show midway through the third season, and her character was written out of the show to &quot;attend beauty school&quot;. She returned to the show in the fifth season for four episodes but was replaced with Christina Moore in the sixth season. In an interview with ABC News, Kelly admitted that &quot;with &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; I was guilty of a drinking problem, and I ran&quot;. Kelly attributed her abuse of alcohol to trauma following a miscarriage.

==Legal issues==
In August 2010, Kelly was arrested in North Carolina on a charge of driving while impaired. In November 2010, she guilty and was fined and sentenced to 12 months of unsupervised probation.

On March 31, 2012, Kelly was arrested in a felony charge of corporal injury upon a spouse and was released on $10,000 bail. The charge was based on a complaint filed by her ex-boyfriend, John Michas. She later made public statements saying that she was the one who had been assaulted and denied Michas&#x27; claim that she assaulted him. The Los Angeles County District Attorney declined to file charges.

In November 2012, police in Mooresville, North Carolina, arrested the 42-year-old Kelly and her 61-year-old husband, Robert Joseph Gilliam, after responding to a disturbance at their home. Both were charged with assault and released on bond. She later filed for divorce and a restraining order against Gilliam.

On June 23, 2013, Kelly was arrested for a suspected DUI when law enforcement responded to a call about a parked car blocking a lane of traffic on the I-5 freeway. She subsequently failed field sobriety testing.

==Death==
Days after checking into Pax Rehab House in Altadena, California, Kelly died in her sleep at the facility on August 15, 2013, age 43. On January 3, 2014, the Los Angeles Department of Coroner concluded that her death was due to an accidental unspecified oral &quot;multiple drug intoxication&quot;. She was cremated, her ashes given to family and friends, before being interred at Forest Lawn East Cemetery in Weddington, North Carolina.

<text>Colima is a state in West Mexico that is divided into ten municipalities. According to the 2020 Mexican census, it has the smallest population of all Mexico&#x27;s states with inhabitants, and is the fifth smallest by land area spanning .

Municipalities in Colima are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. The legal framework for Colima&#x27;s municipalities is provided by Title VII of the state Constitution and the 2001 Law of Free Municipalities in the State of Colima. Every three years, citizens elect a municipal president (Spanish: &quot;presidente municipal&quot;) by a plurality voting system who heads a concurrently elected municipal council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) responsible for providing all the public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors (&quot;regidores y síndicos&quot;). Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income.

Article 88 of the state Constitution and Articles 11, 60 and 61 of the state&#x27;s Law of Free Municipalities provide for the establishment of auxiliary authorities (&quot;autoridades auxiliares&quot;) to represent communities in the municipalities other than the municipal seat (&quot;cabecera&quot;). These are elected by residents of the communities every three years, and are unipersonal except in rural communities with a population over 2,000 inhabitants, which elect boards (&quot;juntas&quot;) comprising a president, secretary and treasurer. Auxiliary authorities serve as liaisons between local communities and the municipal government. They do not have executive powers and do not constitute an independent level of local government.

The largest municipality by population in Colima is Manzanillo, with 191,031 residents, and the smallest municipality is Ixtlahuacán with 5,623 residents. The largest municipality by area is also Manzanillo which spans , while Villa de Álvarez is the smallest at .

<doc id="733884" wikidata="Q1425496" url="?curid=733884" title="Loy Krathong">
<text>Loy Krathong (, , ) is a Thai festival celebrated annually throughout Thailand and in nearby countries with significant South Western Tai cultures (Laos, Shan, Mon, Tanintharyi, Kelantan, Kedah, Perlis and Xishuangbanna). The name could be translated as &quot;to float ritual vessel or lamp,&quot; and comes from the tradition of making &quot;krathong&quot; or buoyant, decorated baskets, which are then floated on a river. Many Thais use the krathong to thank the Goddess of Water and River, Goddess Khongkha () This festival traces its origin back to India.

Loy Krathong takes place on the evening of the full moon of the 12th month in the traditional Thai lunar calendar, thus the exact date of the festival changes every year. In the Western calendar this usually falls in the month of November. In Chiang Mai, the festival lasts three days, and in 2024, the dates are 15-16 November.

In Thailand, the festival is known as Loi Krathong. Outside Thailand, this festival is celebrated under different names, including Myanmar as the &quot;Tazaungdaing festival&quot;, Sri Lanka as &quot;Il Full Moon Poya&quot;, China as &quot;Lantern Festival&quot; and Cambodia as &quot;Bon Om Touk&quot;.

==Overview==

A &quot;krathong&quot; is traditionally a small floating container fashioned of leaves which is made to hold a small portion of goods like a traditional Thai dish (such as &quot;hor mok&quot;) or dessert. The traditional krathong used for floating at the festival are made from a slice of a banana tree trunk or a spider lily plant. Modern krathongs are more often made of bread or Styrofoam. A bread krathong will disintegrate after a few days and can be eaten by fish. Banana stalk krathongs are also biodegradable, but Styrofoam krathongs are increasingly banned, as they pollute rivers and oceans. A krathong is decorated with elaborately-folded banana leaves, three incense sticks, and a candle. A small coin is sometimes included as an offering to the river spirits. On the night of the full moon, Thais launch their krathong on a river, canal, or a pond, making a wish as they do so. The floats are thought to have been introduced to Chiang Mai in 1947 and have since been incorporated into Thai culture. Government offices, corporations, and other organizations launch large decorated krathongs. There are competitions for the best of these large krathongs. Beauty contests often accompany the festivities and fireworks also have become common.

The practice of Loy Krathong in Thailand which roots Hindu in origin, derived from Dewali, the festival of lights celebrated in India as Hindus were known to celebrate the Diwali festival to worship the divine trinity and those Hindus who were converted to Buddhism had created a rite similar to the Diwali. Hinduism has existed in Suvarnabhumi in a syncretistic relationship with Theravada Buddhism at least since 5th century B.C.

In Khmer Empire. Walls of Bayon, a temple built by King Jayavarman VII in the 12th century, depicts scenes of Loy Krathong. A bas relief on the upper level depicts a queen residing on the boat to float the &quot;krathong&quot; in the river whereas six other royal concubines are depicted below, some of which are holding the &quot;krathong&quot; and dedicating at the riverbank in a similar tradition practiced in present-day Cambodia, Thailand, and other Southeast Asian countries.
Similarities can be observed with Kartik Purnima celebrated in the eastern state of Odisha in India. This festival is called Boita Bandana\ Dangā Bhasā, which is observed on the Kartik Purnima or full moon day of Kartik month (which corresponds to October–November) in Odia calendar. Loy Krathong festivities are usually celebrated during the period which corresponds to Kartik Purnima. Odisha being part of the ancient Kalinga which had strong maritime trade relations with Southeast Asia, the similarities in all these festivals may not be coincidental.

== Etymology ==
According to the 1999 Royal Institute Dictionary, &quot;loi&quot; () means &#x27;to float&#x27;, while &quot;krathong&quot; () has various meanings, one of which is &#x27;a small vessel made of leaves which can be floated on water during the Loy Krathong festival.&#x27; Moreover, according to the Royal Society of Thailand, the word &quot;krathong&quot; is derived from Old Chinese word or () which means ritual vessel or lamp. However, other sources believe &quot;krathong&quot; to be a derivate of the Malay word &quot;kantong&quot; (), which has a similar pronunciation and the same meaning.

== History ==

=== Legend in Sukhothai Kingdom Period ===
Loy Krathong is once said to have begun in the Sukhothai Kingdom by a court lady named Nopphamat. However, it is now known that the Nopphamat tale comes from a poem written in the early-Bangkok period. According to King Rama IV, writing in 1863, it was a Hindu festival that was adapted by Thai Buddhists in Thailand to honour the Buddha, Prince Siddhartha Gautama. The candle venerates the Buddha with light, while the krathong&#x27;s floating away symbolises letting go of all one&#x27;s hatred, anger, and defilements. People sometimes cut their fingernails or hair and place the clippings on the krathong as a symbol of letting go of past transgressions and negative thoughts. Many Thais use the krathong to thank the Goddess of Water, the Hindu Goddess Ganga, Phra Mae Khongkha ().

=== Ayutthaya Kingdom and Lavo Kingdom Period ===
Simon de la Loubère led an embassy to Siam (modern Thailand) in 1687 (the &quot;La Loubère-Céberet mission&quot;). Upon his return, La Loubère wrote a description of his travels, as had been requested by Louis XIV, published under the title &quot;Du Royaume de Siam&quot;. Loy Krathong festival was mentioned in his book in the sixth chapter of part two called Concerning the Shows, and other Diverſion of the Siameſes: Religious Shows: An Illumination on the Waters, and another on the Land, and in the Palace.

=== Rattanakosin Kingdom Period ===
The beauty contests that accompany the festival are known as &quot;Nopphamat Queen Contests&quot; has been promoted since the reign of King Rama III. Since the country became peaceful after getting involved with many wars, King Rama III ordered the palace officers and people to revive and promote the important festivals of the kingdom, such as Loy Krathong. According to legend written on the poem, Nang Nopphamat (; alternatively spelled as &quot;Noppamas&quot; or &quot;Nopamas&quot;) was a consort of the 13th century Sukhothai King Sri Indraditya (who is also known as Phra Ruang) and she reputedly was the first to float a decorated raft. However, this tale may have been invented in the early-19th century. There is no evidence that a Nang Nopphamat ever existed. Instead, it is a fact that a woman of this name was the leading character of a novel released at the end of the reign of King Rama III, around 1850 CE. Her character was written as guidance for all women who wished to become civil servants. Kelantan in Malaysia celebrates Loy Krathong similarly, especially in the Tumpat area. The ministry in charge of tourism in Malaysia recognizes it as an attraction for tourists.

===Lanna Kingdom Period and later Northern Part of Thailand===
Loy Krathong coincides with the Lanna (northern Thai) festival known as &quot;Yi Peng&quot; (). &quot;Yi&quot; means &#x27;two&#x27; and &quot;peng&quot; means a &#x27;full moon day&#x27;. &quot;Yi Peng&quot; refers to the full moon day in the second month according to the Lanna lunar calendar (the twelfth month of the Thai lunar calendar). The festival is meant as a time to make merit.

Swarms of sky lanterns (; ), literally: &#x27;floating lanterns&#x27;, are launched into the air. Khom loi are made from a thin fabric, such as rice paper, stretched over a bamboo or wire frame, to which a candle or fuel cell is attached. When the fuel cell is lit, the resulting hot air is trapped inside the lantern and creates enough lift for the khom loi to float into the sky. During the festival, some people also decorate their houses, gardens, and temples with &quot;khom fai&quot; (), intricately shaped paper lanterns which take on different forms. &quot;Khom thue&quot; () are lanterns which are carried around hanging from a stick, &quot;khom khwaen&quot; () are the hanging lanterns, and &quot;khom pariwat&quot; (), which are placed at temples and which revolve due to the heat of the candle inside. The most elaborate &quot;Yi Peng&quot; celebrations can be seen in Chiang Mai, the ancient capital of the former Lanna kingdom, where now both Loy Krathong and Yi Peng are celebrated at the same time resulting in lights floating on the waters, lights hanging from trees/buildings or standing on walls, and lights floating in the sky. The tradition of &quot;Yi Peng&quot; was also adopted by certain parts of Laos during the 16th century.

In 2016, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) cleaned six tonnes of rubbish from the city&#x27;s waterways on the day after Loy Krathong. The city governor said that 661,935 floats were collected from waterways across Bangkok. Of these, 617,901 (93.7 percent) were made of decomposible natural materials, while 44,034 were non-biodegradable Styrofoam floats. There were 163,679 fewer krathong collected than in 2015. The city mobilized 210 workers and 45 boats to collect floats from the Chao Phraya River and canals.

In 2017, because the sky lanterns are a hazard to passing aircraft and &quot;...can cause damage to important places in the areas such as the Grand Palace [sic], temples and governmental offices...&quot; khom loi are increasingly subject to governmental restrictions. In Chiang Mai, authorities cancelled 78 flights in and out of Chiang Mai Airport on 3–4 November 2017. Another 79 flights were rescheduled. Despite those measures, the remains of more than 100 lanterns were later found on airport premises. In Bangkok, the public are prohibited from using fireworks and sky lanterns entirely. Violators may face three years imprisonment and/or a fine of 60,000 baht. One hundred-ninety piers on the Chao Phraya River will be open to the public to float their krathongs. In 2018, up to 158 flights were cancelled or rescheduled at three airports, and in Bangkok 88 piers were closed.

In 2017, in Nakhon Ratchasima province, 50 workers collected krathong from the moat in the town centre near the Thao Suranaree Monument. In Buriram, more than 200 workers and volunteers in Mueang District cleared at least 20,000 krathong from the town&#x27;s moat. There, Styrofoam krathong will be banned in 2017. In Lampang, more than 100 students and teachers from the Institute of Physical Education helped municipal workers clean up the Wang River in Mueang District.

In 2018, after the festivities, Bangkok city workers cleared 841,327 krathongs, up from 3.6 percent in 2017, from the Chao Phraya River, local canals, and 30 public parks; 5.3 percent of them were made from styrofoam.

<text>Emotional labor is work of trying to feel the right feeling for a job, either by evoking or suppressing feelings. It requires the capacity to manage and produce a feeling to fulfill the emotional requirements of a job. More specifically, workers are expected to regulate their personas during interactions with customers, co-workers, clients, and managers. This includes analysis and decision-making in terms of the expression of emotion, whether actually felt or not, as well as its opposite: the suppression of emotions that are felt but not expressed. This is done so as to produce a certain feeling in the customer or client that will allow the company or organization to succeed.

Roles that have been identified as requiring emotional labor include those involved in education, public administration, law, childcare, health care, social work, hospitality, media, advocacy, aviation and espionage. As particular economies move from a manufacturing to a service-based economy, more workers in a variety of occupational fields are expected to manage their emotions according to employer demands when compared to sixty years ago.

==Definition==

The sociologist Arlie Hochschild provided the first definition of emotional labor, which is displaying certain emotions to meet the requirements of a job. The related term emotion work refers to displaying emotions you don&#x27;t feel within the private sphere of one&#x27;s home or interactions with family and friends. Hochschild identified three emotion regulation strategies: cognitive, bodily, and expressive. Within cognitive emotion work, one attempts to change images, ideas, or thoughts in hopes of changing the feelings associated with them. For example, one may associate a family picture with feeling happy and think about said picture whenever attempting to feel happy. Within bodily emotion work, one attempts to change physical symptoms in order to create a desired emotion. For example, one may attempt deep breathing in order to reduce anger. Within expressive emotion work, one attempts to change expressive gestures to change inner feelings, such as smiling when trying to feel happy.

While emotion work happens within the private sphere, emotional labor is emotion management within the workplace according to employer expectations. Jobs involving emotional labor are defined as those that:

# require face-to-face or voice-to-voice contact with the public.
# require the worker to produce an emotional state in another person.
# allow the employer, through training and supervision, to exercise a degree of control over the emotional activities of employees.

Hochschild (1983) argues that within this commodification process, service workers are estranged from their own feelings in the workplace.

== Alternate usage ==
The term has been applied in modern contexts to refer to household tasks, specifically unpaid labor that is often expected of women, e.g. having to remind their partner of chores. The term can also refer to informal counseling, such as providing advice to a friend or helping someone through a breakup. When Hochschild was interviewed about this shifting usage, she described it having undergone concept creep, expressing that it made the concept blurrier and was sometimes being applied to things that were simply just labor, although how carrying out this labor made a person feel could make it emotional labor as well.

== Determinants ==
# Societal, occupational, and organizational norms. For example, empirical evidence indicates that in typically &quot;busy&quot; stores there is more legitimacy to express negative emotions than there is in typically &quot;slow&quot; stores, in which employees are expected to behave in accordance with the display rules. Hence, the emotional culture to which one belongs influences the employee&#x27;s commitment to those rules.
# Dispositional traits and inner feeling on the job; such as employees&#x27; emotional expressiveness, which refers to the capability to use facial expressions, voice, gestures, and body movements to transmit emotions; or employees&#x27; level of career identity (the importance of the career role to self-identity), which allows them to express the organizationally-desired emotions more easily (because there is less discrepancy between expressed behavior and emotional experience when engaged in their work).
# Supervisory regulation of display rules; Supervisors are likely to be important definers of display rules at the job level, given their direct influence on workers&#x27; beliefs about high-performance expectations. Moreover, supervisors&#x27; impressions of the need to suppress negative emotions on the job influence the employees&#x27; impressions of that display rule.

== Surface and deep acting ==
Arlie Hochschild&#x27;s foundational text divided emotional labor into two components: surface acting and deep acting. Surface acting occurs when employees display the emotions required for a job without changing how they actually feel. Deep acting is an effortful process through which employees change their internal feelings to align with organizational expectations, producing more natural and genuine emotional displays. Although the underlying processes differ, the objective of both is typically to show positive emotions, which are presumed to impact the feelings of customers and bottom-line outcomes (e.g. sales, positive recommendations, and repeat business). However, research generally has shown surface acting is more harmful to employee health. Without a consideration of ethical values, the consequences of emotional work on employees can easily become negative. Business ethics can be used as a guide for employees on how to present feelings that are consistent with ethical values, and can show them how to regulate their feelings more easily and comfortably while working.

==Careers==
In the past, emotional labor demands and display rules were viewed as a characteristic of particular , such as restaurant workers, cashiers, hospital workers, bill collectors, counselors, secretaries, and nurses. However, display rules have been conceptualized not only as role requirements of particular occupational groups, but also as interpersonal job demands, which are shared by many kinds of occupations.

=== Teachers ===
Zhang et al. (2019) looked at teachers in China, using questionnaires the researchers asked about their teaching experience and their interaction with the children and their families. According to numerous studies, early childhood education is important to a child&#x27;s development, which can have an effect on the teachers emotional labor, along with their emotional labor having an effect on the children. A big focus in this study was the use of surface acting in early childhood teacher. Zhang et al. (2019) found that surface acting was used significantly less than deep and natural acting in kindergarten teachers, along with early childhood teacher are less likely to fake or suppress their feelings. They also found that more experienced teachers had higher levels of emotional labor, because they either have more skills to suppress their emotions, or they are less driven to use surface acting.

=== Bill collectors ===
In 1991, Sutton did an in-depth qualitative study into bill collectors at a collection agency. He found that unlike the other jobs described here where employees need to act cheerful and concerned, bill collectors are selected and socialized to show irritation to most debtors. Specifically, the collection agency hired agents who seemed to be easily aroused. The newly hired agents were then trained on when and how to show varying emotions to different types of debtors. As they worked at the collection agency, they were closely monitored by their supervisors to make sure that they frequently conveyed urgency to debtors.

Bill collectors&#x27; emotional labor consists of not letting angry and hostile debtors make them angry and to not feel guilty about pressuring friendly debtors for money. They coped with angry debtors by publicly showing their anger or making jokes when they got off the phone. They minimized the guilt they felt by staying emotionally detached from the debtors.

=== Childcare workers ===

The skills involved in childcare are often viewed as innate to women, making the components of childcare invisible. However, a number of scholars have not only studied the difficulty and skill required for childcare, but also suggested that the emotional labor of childcare is unique and needs to be studied differently. Performing emotional labor requires the development of emotional capital, and that can only be developed through experience and reflection. Through semi-structured interviews, Edwards (2016) found that there were two components of emotional labor in childcare in addition to Hochschild&#x27;s original two: emotional consonance and suppression. Edwards (2016) defined suppression as hiding emotion and emotional consonance as naturally experiencing the same emotion that one is expected to feel for the job.

=== Food-industry workers ===

====Wait staff====
In her 1991 study of waitresses in Philadelphia, Paules examines how these workers assert control and protect their self identity during interactions with customers. In restaurant work, Paules argues, workers&#x27; subordination to customers is reinforced through &quot;cultural symbols that originate from deeply rooted assumptions about service work.&quot; Because the waitresses were not strictly regulated by their employers, waitresses&#x27; interactions with customers were controlled by the waitresses themselves. Although they are stigmatized by the stereotypes and assumptions of servitude surrounding restaurant work, the waitresses studied were not negatively affected by their interactions with customers. To the contrary, they viewed their ability to manage their emotions as a valuable skill that could be used to gain control over customers. Thus, the Philadelphia waitresses took advantage of the lack of employer-regulated emotional labor in order to avoid the potentially negative consequences of emotional labor.

Though Paules highlights the positive consequences of emotional labor for a specific population of waitresses, other scholars have also found negative consequences of emotional labor within the waitressing industry. Through eighteen months of participant observation research, Bayard De Volo (2003) found that casino waitresses are highly monitored and monetarily bribed to perform emotional labor in the workplace. Specifically, Bayard De Volo (2003) argues that through a sexualized environment and a generous tipping system, both casino owners and customers control waitresses&#x27; behavior and appearance for their own benefit and pleasure. Even though the waitresses have their own forms of individual and collective resistance mechanisms, intense and consistent monitoring of their actions by casino management makes it difficult to change the power dynamics of the casino workplace.

====Fast-food employees====
By using participant observation and interviews, Leidner (1993) examines how employers in fast food restaurants regulate workers&#x27; interactions with customers. According to Leidner (1993), employers attempt to regulate workers&#x27; interactions with customers only under certain conditions. Specifically, when employers attempt to regulate worker–customer interactions, employers believe that &quot;the quality of the interaction is important to the success of the enterprise&quot;, that workers are &quot;unable or unwilling to conduct the interactions appropriately on their own&quot;, and that the &quot;tasks themselves are not too complex or context-dependent.&quot; According to Leidner (1993), regulating employee interactions with customers involves standardizing workers&#x27; personal interactions with customers. At the McDonald&#x27;s fast food restaurants in Leidner&#x27;s (1993) study, these interactions are strictly scripted, and workers&#x27; compliance with the scripts and regulations are closely monitored.

Along with examining employers&#x27; attempts to regulate employee–customer interactions, Leidner (1993) examines how fast-food workers&#x27; respond to these regulations. According to Leidner (1993), meeting employers&#x27; expectations requires workers to engage in some form of emotional labor. For example, McDonald&#x27;s workers are expected to greet customers with a smile and friendly attitude independent of their own mood or temperament at the time. Leidner (1993) suggests that rigid compliance with these expectations is at least potentially damaging to workers&#x27; sense of self and identity. However, Leidner (1993) did not see the negative consequences of emotional labor in the workers she studied. Instead, McDonald&#x27;s workers attempted to individualize their responses to customers in small ways. Specifically, they used humor or exaggeration to demonstrate their rebellion against the strict regulation of their employee–customer interactions.

===Physicians===
According to Larson and Yao (2005), empathy should characterize physicians&#x27; interactions with their patients because, despite advancement in medical technology, the interpersonal relationship between physicians and patients remains essential to quality healthcare. Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians consider empathy a form of emotional labor. Specifically, according to Larson and Yao (2005), physicians engage in emotional labor through deep acting by feeling sincere empathy before, during, and after interactions with patients. On the other hand, Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians engage in surface acting when they fake empathic behaviors toward the patient. Although Larson and Yao (2005) argue that deep acting is preferred, physicians may rely on surface acting when sincere empathy for patients is impossible. Overall, Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians are more effective and enjoy more professional satisfaction when they engage in empathy through deep acting due to emotional labor.

===Police work===
According to Martin (1999), police work involves substantial amounts of emotional labor by officers, who must control their own facial and bodily displays of emotion in the presence of other officers and citizens. Although policing is often viewed as stereotypically masculine work that focuses on fighting crime, policing also requires officers to maintain order and provide a variety of interpersonal services. For example, police must have a commanding presence that allows them to act decisively and maintain control in unpredictable situations while having the ability to actively listen and talk to citizens. According to Martin (1999), a police officer who displays too much anger, sympathy, or other emotion while dealing with danger on the job will be viewed by other officers as someone unable to withstand the pressures of police work, due to the sexist views of many police officers. While being able to balance this self-management of emotions in front of other officers, police must also assertively restore order and use effective interpersonal skills to gain citizen trust and compliance. Ultimately, the ability of police officers to effectively engage in emotional labor affects how other officers and citizens view them.

===Public administration ===
Many scholars argue that the amount of emotional work required between all levels of government is greatest on the local level. It is at the level of cities and counties that the responsibility lies for day to day emergency preparedness, firefighters, law enforcement, public education, public health, and family and children&#x27;s services. Citizens in a community expect the same level of satisfaction from their government, as they receive in a customer service-oriented job. This takes a considerate amount of work for both employees and employers in the field of public administration. Mastracci and Adams (2017) looks at public servants and how they may be at risk of being alienated because of their unsupported emotional labor demands from their jobs. This can cause surface acting and distrust in management. There are two comparisons that represent emotional labor within public administration, &quot;Rational Work versus Emotion Work&quot;, and &quot;Emotional Labor versus Emotional Intelligence.&quot;

====Performance====

Many scholars argue that when public administrators perform emotional labor, they are dealing with significantly more sensitive situations than employees in the service industry. The reason for this is because they are on the front lines of the government, and are expected by citizens to serve them quickly and efficiently. When confronted by a citizen or a co-worker, public administrators use emotional sensing to size up the emotional state of the citizen in need. Workers then take stock of their own emotional state in order to make sure that the emotion they are expressing is appropriate to their roles. Simultaneously, they have to determine how to act in order to elicit the desired response from the citizen as well as from co-workers. Public Administrators perform emotional labor through five different strategies: Psychological First Aid, Compartments and Closets, Crazy Calm, Humor, and Common Sense.

====Definition: rational work vs. emotion work ====
According to Mary Guy, Public administration does not only focus on the business side of administration but on the personal side as well. It is not just about collecting the water bill or land ordinances to construct a new property, it is also about the quality of life and sense of community that is allotted to individuals by their city officials. Rational work is the ability to think cognitively and analytically, while emotional work means to think more practically and with more reason.

====Definition: intelligence vs. emotional intelligence ====
Knowing how to suppress and manage one&#x27;s own feelings is known as emotional intelligence. The ability to control one&#x27;s emotions and to be able to do this at a high level guarantees one&#x27;s own ability to serve those in need. Emotional intelligence is performed while performing emotional labor, and without one the other can not be there.

=== Sex work ===

==Gender==
Macdonald and Sirianna (1996) use the term &quot;emotional proletariat&quot; to describe service jobs in which &quot;workers exercise emotional labor wherein they are required to display friendliness and deference to customers.&quot; Because of deference, these occupations tend to be stereotyped as female jobs, independent of the actual number of women working the job. According to Macdonald and Sirianna (1996), because deference is a characteristic demanded of all those in disadvantaged structural positions, especially women, when deference is made a job requirement, women are likely to be overrepresented in these jobs. Macdonald and Sirianna (1996) claim that &quot;[i]n no other area of wage labor are the personal characteristics of the workers so strongly associated with the nature of the work.&quot; Thus, according to Macdonald and Sirianna (1996), although all workers employed within the service economy may have a difficult time maintaining their dignity and self-identity due to the demands of emotional labor, such an issue may be especially problematic for women workers.

Emotional labor also affects women by perpetuating occupational segregation and the gender wage gap. Job segregation, which is the systematic tendency for men and women to work in different occupations, is often cited as the reason why women lack equal pay when compared to men. According to Guy and Newman (2004), occupational segregation and ultimately the gender wage gap can at least be partially attributed to emotional labor. Specifically, work-related tasks that require emotional work thought to be natural for women, such as caring and empathizing are requirements of many female-dominated occupations. However, according to Guy and Newman (2004), these feminized work tasks are not a part of formal job descriptions and performance evaluations: &quot;Excluded from job descriptions and performance evaluations, the work is invisible and uncompensated. Public service relies heavily on such skills, yet civil service systems, which are designed on the assumptions of a bygone era, fail to acknowledge and compensate emotional labor.&quot; According to Guy and Newman (2004), women working in positions that require emotional labour in addition to regular work are not compensated for this additional labour because of the sexist notion that the additional labour is to be expected of them by the fact of being a woman. Guy and Azhar (2018) found that emotive expressions between sexes is affected by culture. This study found that there is variability to how women and men interpret emotive words, and specifically results showed that culture played a huge role in these gender differences.

==Disability==

People with disability are increasingly part of the labor force, due to societal attitudes about inclusion and neoliberal pressures around reducing welfare. Roles that require emotional labor may be more difficult for people with certain kinds of disabilities to perform. People with disabilities also may have to use more of their own time and energy to perform a task than a non-disabled person. For instance when they routinely encounter prejudice and stigma (&quot;as would be the case for many groups experiencing prejudice)&quot;, including disability-unfriendly structures (Accessibility, administrative or social). On the other hand due to routine experience of navigating unhelpful structures and prejudice, disabled people can have dual advantages of : better skills in finding ways round problems without expending emotional energy being surprised for example, and easier sympathetic or empathetic understanding of other individuals and groups experiences with these problems. Inclusive or unfriendly organizational culture also has an impact, and workplaces may require workers with disability to downplay their impairments in order to &#x27;fit in&#x27;, an extra burden of emotional labor. Most individuals will experience complex affects of how their disability influences their emotional labor in a given job role at a specified organisation.

==Implications==

Positive affective display in service interactions, such as smiling and conveying friendliness, are positively associated with customer positive feelings, and important outcomes, such as intention to return, intention to recommend a store to others, and perception of overall service quality. There is evidence that emotional labor may lead to employees&#x27; emotional exhaustion and burnout over time, and may also reduce employees&#x27; job satisfaction. That is, higher degree of using emotion regulation on the job is related to higher levels of employees&#x27; emotional exhaustion, and lower levels of employees&#x27; job satisfaction.

There is empirical evidence that higher levels of emotional labor demands are not uniformly rewarded with higher wages. Rather, the reward is dependent on the level of general cognitive demands required by the job. That is, occupations with high cognitive demands evidence wage returns with increasing emotional labor demands; whereas occupations low in cognitive demands evidence a wage &quot;penalty&quot; with increasing emotional labor demands. Additionally, innovations that increase employee empowerment — such as conversion into worker cooperatives, co-managing schemes, or flattened workplace structures — have been found to increase workers&#x27; levels of emotional labor as they take on more workplace responsibilities.

===Coping skills===
Coping occurs in response to psychological stress—usually triggered by changes—in an effort to maintain mental health and emotional well-being. Life stressors are often described as negative events (loss of a job). However, positive changes in life (a new job) can also constitute life stressors, thus requiring the use of coping skills to adapt. Coping strategies are the behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that you use to adjust to the changes that occur in your life. The use of coping skills will help a person better themselves in the work place and perform to the best of their ability to achieve success. There are many ways to cope and adapt to changes. Some ways include: sharing emotions with peers, having a healthy social life outside of work, being humorous, and adjusting expectations of self and work. These coping skills will help turn negative emotion to positive and allow for more focus on the public in contrast to oneself.

<text>Pestújhely (literally: &quot;New Settlement by Pest&quot;, ) is one of the northern suburbs of Budapest, the capital of Hungary. It belongs to District XV.

== History ==
Until the second half of the 19th century, this area belonged to the village of Rákospalota and was uninhabited and marshy. In 1897 building plots were sold out by auction and the new settlement became independent from Rákospalota in 1909. 

The inhabitants of Pestújhely were clerks, postmasters, railwaymen and other lower-middle-class people, many of whom worked in Budapest. The rapid development of the village continued until the Second World War with the building of houses, churches and schools. In 1950 it became part of Great-Budapest as well as Rákospalota. The small suburb today is a pleasant backwater with a quiet market-town atmosphere. Its landmarks are some old villas and three small churches.

<doc id="733898" wikidata="Q1059695" url="?curid=733898" title="Hurricane Dora (1964)">
<text>Hurricane Dora was the first tropical cyclone on record to make landfall over the Atlantic coast of North Florida at hurricane intensity. The sixth tropical storm and second hurricane of the 1964 season, Dora developed from a tropical wave near the coast of Senegal on August 28. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Dora late on August 31. It then curved northwestward and continued to strengthen. By late on September 2, Dora became a Category 1 hurricane. Intensification slowed somewhat, with Dora becoming a Category 2 hurricane on September 4 and then a Category 3 hurricane on next day. Deepening further, the storm briefly peaked as a Category 4 with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) on September 6. Dora soon weakened to a Category 3 hurricane and then a Category 2 hurricane while curving westward early the following day.

Dora maintained Category 2 intensity over the next few days, except for several hours on September 9. While approaching the northeast coast of Florida, Dora&#x27;s motion became erratic, making a few cyclonic loops. Early on September 10, the hurricane made landfall near St. Augustine, Florida, with winds of . Dora quickly weakened to tropical storm intensity over land on September 11 and then briefly drifted over southwestern Georgia, until turning northeastward later the next day. Upon merging with a cold front, Dora became extratropical cyclone over coastal South Carolina on September 13. Early on September 14, the extratropical storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean over the Outer Banks of North Carolina and accelerated, striking Newfoundland on September 15 before being absorbed by another extratropical system.

Along the First Coast of Florida, tides reached up to above mean sea level. Strong winds lashed the region, with sustained wind of observed in St. Augustine. In Jacksonville, approximately 156,000 customers lost power, while about 19% of phones in Duval County were out of service. Much of the damage in the Jacksonville area occurred to older buildings and those located in coastal areas. Additionally, sections of the city experienced wind-induced river flooding in the vicinity of the St. Johns River. Heavy rainfall damaged many unharvested crops and inundated numerous roads and bridges, isolated some communities for several days. Throughout Florida, Dora demolished 74 dwellings and damaged 9,374 others, while 14 mobile homes were destroyed and 218 others suffered severe impact. About 50 farm buildings and 423 small businesses suffered major damage or destruction. Three deaths and at least $230 million in damage occurred. In Georgia, the storm damaged about 1,135 homes and obliterated 5 others. Additionally, 18 trailers suffered major impact, while 43 small businesses were destroyed or experienced severe damage. The state reported one death and at least $9 million in damage. Dora impacted a few other states the East Coast of the United States, but to a much lesser degree. One death occurred in Virginia. Overall, Dora caused $280 million in damage, which is equivalent to $2.6 billion in 2022 USD, and five deaths.

==Meteorological history==

Hurricane Dora was first identified as a broad area of low pressure on August 28, 1964, that moved off the west coast of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean near Dakar, Senegal. Traveling west-southwestward, the system brushed the Cape Verde Islands on the next day. By August 31, images from the eighth Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS VIII) depicted a developing storm with a central dense overcast, banding features and cirrus outflow. Observations from ship &quot;Mormacscan&quot;, which passed closest to the storm, indicated decreasing barometric pressures and wind gusts up to . As part of a review of the cyclone during the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project in 2019, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Dora around 18:00 UTC on August 31. This was based on an extrapolation of reconnaissance aircraft flight data on September 1, which observed sustained winds of . Shortly thereafter, the Weather Bureau in San Juan, Puerto Rico, issued the first advisory on the storm, with the center estimated to be roughly 850 mi (1,370 km) east of Trinidad.

After advisories began on September 1, Dora turned northwestward and continued to intensify. Several reconnaissance missions into the storm indicated that it attained hurricane status during the afternoon of September 2, which the official Atlantic hurricane database lists as 18:00 UTC. Although contemporary reports indicated that Dora quickly became a major hurricane, the 2019 reanalysis of Dora concluded that remained a Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale until late on September 4 and did not intensify into a Category 3 hurricane until about 24 hours thereafter. At the time, meteorologists expected the storm to maintain a northwesterly course and be steered over open waters by a trough associated with Hurricane Cleo to the west. However, Dora avoided the trough and instead gradually turned westward September 6. That day, the hurricane attained its peak intensity as a Category 4-equivalent storm with winds estimated at 130 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum atmospheric pressure of .
While executing the turn, Dora steadily weakened as its low-level inflow was disrupted, falling to Category 3 intensity around 12:00 UTC on September 6 and then to Category 2 status by early the next day. While initially thought to have re-intensified into a Category 3 hurricane on September 8, the 2019 reanalysis on Dora indicated that the storm remained no stronger than a Category 2 hurricane for the remainder of its duration. Tracking westward towards Florida, Dora&#x27;s forward movement decreased and became erratic as it neared the coast. Early on September 9, the storm abruptly turned southeastward before moving north for several hours. Throughout the remainder of the day, Dora executed three distinct cyclonic loops while maintaining a general westward motion. The cyclone weakened to a Category 1 hurricane intensity early on September 9, possibly due to an eyewall replacement cycle, but re-strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC while passing over the Gulf Stream. This resulted in its central pressure decreasing 9 mbar (hPa; ) in a few hours.

As Dora neared North Florida in the early hours of September 10, the diameter of its eye decreased from about 28 mi to 8 mi (44 to 13 km). Around 06:00 UTC on September 10, the storm made landfall near St. Augustine, as a strong Category 2 hurricane with sustained winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). Dora became the only hurricane to strike the First Coast region during the 20th century. The cyclone quickly weakened after moving ashore, losing hurricane status within 12 hours, and turned to the north just west of Tallahassee on September 11. Early on the following day, Dora briefly became almost stationary over southwest Georgia, before a cold front caused it to accelerate northeastward. Dora also began merging with the cold front, leading to its transition into an extratropical cyclone over coastal South Carolina around 12:00 UTC on September 13. The extratropical remnants emerged into the Atlantic along the Outer Banks of North Carolina early the following day and continued northeastward, striking Newfoundland late on September 15, shortly before being absorbed by another extratropical system.

<text>With Honors is a 1994 American comedy-drama film directed by Alek Keshishian. It stars Brendan Fraser as a Harvard University student who finds himself at the mercy of the demands of a homeless man (Joe Pesci) when he holds his senior thesis paper hostage. Moira Kelly, Patrick Dempsey, Josh Hamilton, and Gore Vidal also star. The film was released on April 29, 1994, received generally negative reviews from critics, and grossed $20 million.

==Plot==

Montgomery “Monty” Kessler is a senior majoring in Government at Harvard University and sharing a house with friends: art student Courtney, womanizing radio disc jockey Everett, and neurotic medical student Jeff.

While Monty is working on his senior thesis, which takes a pessimistic view of citizens on public assistance, a power outage ruins his computer’s hard drive. When he rushes out to print a backup copy of his thesis, he trips on the street, breaking his ankle, and drops the thesis down a grating into the boiler room under Widener Library. There Monty finds a homeless man, resembling the writer Walt Whitman, burning his thesis page by page. He calls the campus police who arrest the man, but they are unable to recover the thesis.

In court, Monty learns the man’s name is Simon Wilder. Although Simon manages to get the worst of the charges dismissed, he is held in contempt, for which Monty pays the fine. Despite Simon’s anger over Monty having him arrested, they work out a deal: for every service Monty provides, Simon will return one page of his thesis. Monty takes Simon to the house, where he lets him stay in a broken down van in the backyard.

Over time, Monty and Simon become close friends. Monty confides in him about his absent father, and Simon helps him see poor people like himself as human beings. He also shows Monty his collection of stones, each one representing a significant memory from his life.

Monty’s roommates begin to like the arrangement as well, with Courtney appreciating Monty’s newfound open-mindedness and Everett giving Simon wine in exchange for repairing the van. However, Jeff refuses to let Simon stay in the house’s basement on a particularly cold night in case of his parents’ visiting. When Monty lies to Simon about why he can’t come in the house, he ends their deal and leaves.

While everyone goes home for Christmas vacation, Monty stays to recompose his thesis. Simon sends a friend to deliver the thesis; he reveals where Simon is staying, but says he does not want to see him. Monty finds him living on the street, coughing and wheezing due to years of exposure to asbestos in the U.S. Merchant Marine.

Monty allows Simon to live in the house and refuses his offer of a new deal. Simon gets disability benefits to help with the rent while Monty decides to completely rewrite his thesis. Courtney and Everett are supportive of Simon’s moving in, but Jeff is still unwelcoming.

Realizing the seriousness of his illness, Simon writes his obituary, which reveals that he left his wife and child to join the Merchant Marines. Though initially angry, Monty eventually forgives him, taking him as his guest to a campus pajama party. As Monty watches Courtney dance with another man, Simon encourages him to confess his love for her. Courtney reciprocates and they begin a relationship.

Monty agrees to drive Simon to visit Frank, the son he abandoned, despite the fact that doing so will delay the completion of his thesis. All the roommates, including Jeff, who has come to see Simon&#x27;s humanity, make the long drive. Frank bitterly rebuffs his apology and pretends that he doesn’t know him when Simon’s granddaughter asks who he is. Before leaving, a heartbroken Simon adds a stone to his collection.

Simon’s condition deteriorates on the drive back to the house; the roommates stay up all night reading Walt Whitman to him before he dies. At his funeral, Monty tearfully reads Simon’s obituary where he refers to the roommates as his family, and states that Monty ‘’will graduate life with honor and without regret.”

Monty meets with his haughty mentor, Professor Pitkannan, and explains why he changed his thesis to a more optimistic subject. Pitkannan accepts his explanation, but informs him that he will not graduate with honors due to his lateness. Monty thanks him for his mentorship. He also returns the Walt Whitman book to Widener Library, symbolically leaving Simon’s spirit there.

The roommates graduate and Monty begins his own collection of memory stones.

==Production==

The film was shot at various locations in Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, and Massachusetts, including the Harvard University campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The exterior of Winthrop House appears, but the interiors pictured are not that of actual Harvard houses, and the last scene of the movie was shot at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The buildings and surroundings were dressed up to look as if it were Harvard and many of the people in the final scene are Illinois students. The graduation scene was shot while the local climate in Illinois had not allowed for the trees to bloom leaves and so artificial branches and leaves were stapled on. All of the outdoor shots of Harvard&#x27;s Widener Library had the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Northrop Auditorium in that role. The scene in which Simon Wilder and Professor Pitkannan debate the role of the president in American democracy was filmed in Lincoln Hall at Northwestern Law School.

==Reception==
=== Critical response ===
 Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A–&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The well-meaning plot about homelessness turns out to be the insufferable part, but the appealing actors who play the four roommates give the film a casual charm.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the cast, saying: &quot;Fraser and Kelly make appealing foils; they deserve to do more than sponge up life lessons from the man they once dismissed as a bum.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, praising the acting, but criticizing the &quot;clichéd&quot; plot.

=== Box office ===
The film grossed $4.3 million in its opening weekend, finishing in second, and then topped the box office in its sophomore weekend with $3.7 million.

Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; listed the film as his 9th-worst of 1994.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack was released on March 22, 1994, by Maverick Records and Warner Bros. Records. It contains the U.S. No. 2 hit single and theme song &quot;I&#x27;ll Remember&quot; by pop singer Madonna. She received nominations from the Golden Globes, Grammys, and MTV Movie Awards.

Seattle grunge band Mudhoney were asked to contribute a track to the soundtrack. In the liner notes from their compilation &quot;March to Fuzz&quot; written by the band, &quot;They sent us a clip from the movie &quot;With Honors&quot; of some jock running through the snow with EMF&#x27;s hit &quot;Unbelievable&quot; scoring the action. They said they were looking for an upbeat song like that for this part of the film. We told them that we had a bitchin&#x27; little instrumental that might work. They insisted on a song with words. So, I put some words on it and we sent down both versions, figuring they&#x27;d have to choose the instrumental. They didn&#x27;t.&quot; The song, &quot;Run Shithead Run,&quot; is included on the soundtrack but Mudhoney claims they never got another such request.

The Pretenders&#x27; cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Forever Young&quot; was later included on their album &quot;Last of the Independents&quot; in addition to &quot;Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home&quot; as one of the two versions of the same song that was played in the movie, the other being by Robbie Jackson.

Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;Thank You&quot; also appeared in &quot;&quot; and their 1995 album of the same name. Unlike the soundtrack version, the former album contained the shorter version while the full version appeared in the latter album.

<doc id="733903" wikidata="Q2309083" url="?curid=733903" title="Zzzax">
<text>Zzzax is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (vol. 2) #166 (August 1973), and was created by Steve Englehart and Herb Trimpe.

In-universe, Zzzax was created by accident during a terrorist act. Zzzax is a being of pure electricity who can absorb and discharge powerful currents of electricity. Its size and strength depend on the amount of electricity absorbed. It can also absorb human brain energy, temporarily taking on the personality of the victim.

==Fictional character biography==
Debuting in the title &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (vol. 2), Zzzax is a humanoid creature formed from electricity by an act of sabotage at a Con Ed nuclear power plant in New York City. A group of terrorists destroying the dynamos started a chain reaction that caused a rapid buildup of energy, which takes on a life of its own, absorbing the minds of them and several engineers. By using the electrical energy from their brains, the entity achieves humanoid form and sentience. Calling itself Zzzax, the entity fights the Hulk and Hawkeye before being defeated.

The character returns and attacks a research center in Chicago. The Hulk battles the entity to a standstill before several scientists shut down the process that recreates Zzzax. Zzzax reappears in &quot;Luke Cage, Power Man&quot;, and hunts down the men responsible for its last defeat. Power Man defeats the entity, but not before it kills one of the scientists. Zzzax returns to confront an intelligent version of the monster possessing the mind of Bruce Banner, but is quickly defeated. Mephisto later reforms the entity in the miniseries &quot;Secret Wars II&quot;, although the Thing defeats it. In the title &quot;West Coast Avengers&quot;, Zzzax teams with fundamental force villains Graviton, Quantum, and Halflife, but is again short-circuited by Hawkeye.

S.H.I.E.L.D. later captured Zzzax and transported it to Gamma Base. General Thunderbolt Ross arranges for his mind to be transferred into Zzzax&#x27;s body and battles a new version of the Hulk, whose alter-ego is Rick Jones. Ross relinquishes control of the entity soon after saving his daughter Betty, realizing that his actions had risked lives. Zzzax battles Iron Man in the title &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; and Cable in the hero&#x27;s self-titled series.

The entity reappears in the title &quot;New Avengers&quot; and participates in the mass escape by supervillains from the holding facility &quot;the Raft&quot;. The title &quot;Sensational She-Hulk&quot; reveals the character has been contained by S.H.I.E.L.D. After briefly escaping and turning the defense systems of the Helicarrier against its agents, it is recaptured by the She-Hulk.

The Mighty Avengers later apprehend Zzzax when it attacks New Delhi.
Zzzax later appears in the services of MODOK Superior.

==Powers and abilities==
As a being of pure electricity, Zzzax is able to absorb and generate electrical fields, as well as manipulate nearby equipment. It can grow its own intelligence by draining the energy from human brainwaves, thus becoming dependent upon them. While incinerating the victim, it would temporarily take on his or her personality traits. This extends control to their nervous systems via electric currents. Only its foe, the Hulk has proven unaffected by this ability. Zzzax&#x27;s size and strength increases in direct quality for the electricity it needs to feed. It is also capable of hovering. At the point whereby water - a primary weakness - could short-circuit or evaporate Zzzax before touching it.

<doc id="733904" wikidata="Q516804" url="?curid=733904" title="Chaos Communication Congress">
<text>The Chaos Communication Congress is an annual hacker conference organized by the Chaos Computer Club. The congress features a variety of lectures and workshops on technical and political issues related to security, cryptography, privacy and online freedom of speech. It has taken place regularly at the end of the year since 1984, with the current date and duration (27–30 December) established in 2005. It is considered one of the largest events of its kind, alongside DEF CON in Las Vegas.

==History==
The congress is held in Germany. It started in 1984 in Hamburg, moved to Berlin in 1998, and back to Hamburg in 2012, having exceeded the capacity of the Berlin venue with more than attendees. Since then, it attracts an increasing number of people: around attendees in 2012, over in 2015, and more than in 2017. From 2017 to 2019 it has taken place at the Trade Fair Grounds in Leipzig, since the Hamburg venue (CCH) was closed for renovation in 2017 and the existing space was not enough for the growing congress. The congress moved back to Hamburg in 2023, after the renovation of CCH was finished.

A large range of speakers are featured. The event is organized by volunteers called &quot;Chaos Angels&quot;. The non-members entry fee for four days was €100 in 2016, and was raised to €120 in 2018 to include a public transport ticket for the Leipzig area.

An important part of the congress are the &quot;assemblies&quot;, semi-open spaces with clusters of tables and internet connections for groups and individuals to collaborate and socialize in projects, workshops and hands-on talks. These assembly spaces, introduced at the 2012 meeting, combine the &quot;hack center&quot; project space and distributed group spaces of former years.

From 1997 to 2004 the congress also hosted the annual German Lockpicking Championships. 2005 was the first year the Congress lasted four days instead of three and lacked the German Lockpicking Championships.

2020 was the first year where the Congress did not take place at a physical location due to the COVID-19 pandemic, giving way to the first Remote Chaos Experience (rC3).

The Chaos Computer Club announced to return to the now newly renovated Congress Center Hamburg for the 37th edition of the Chaos Communication Congress. The announcement confirms the usual date of 27-30 December, notably omitting the &quot;year&quot; it will be held. On 18 October 2022, they confirmed that the congress will indeed not be held in 2022. On 6 October 2023, the CCC announced that 37C3 will take place again on the usual dates in 2023.

<text>The West Coast Avengers is a fictional group of superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The team first appeared in &quot;The West Coast Avengers&quot; #1 (Sept. 1984), created by Roger Stern and Bob Hall. It was the first spin-off publication for the Avengers. 

Following the 1984 limited series, the West Coast Avengers were the focus of an ongoing series published from October 1985 to January 1994. Volume 3 began publication in September 2018 as part of the Fresh Start relaunch but was cancelled after 10 issues. A fourth volume launched in November 2024.

==Publication history==

The West Coast Avengers first appear in a four-issue limited series published from September to December 1984. The series was written by Roger Stern and drawn by Bob Hall and Brett Breeding. This was followed by a 102-issue series of the same name that ran from October 1985 to January 1994. The series was initially written by Steve Englehart and drawn by Al Milgrom and Joe Sinnott. It was the first spin-off series for the Avengers. The series was renamed Avengers West Coast on the cover of issue #47 (Aug. 1989).

In 2018, a new incarnation of the West Coast Avengers appeared in the &quot;Fresh Start&quot; that consists of Hawkeye, Kate Bishop, Gwenpool, America Chavez, Quentin Quire, and Kate&#x27;s boyfriend Johnny Watts who takes the codename Fuse. Jeff the Land Shark had his first appearance in issue #7 (January 2019). The ongoing series was written by Kelly Thompson and initially drawn by Stefano Caselli. It was cancelled as of issue #10 cover dated June 2019.

In November 2024, Volume 4 began publication with writer Gerry Duggan and artist Danny Kim. In this series, Iron Man and War Machine assemble a new West Coast Avengers roster which includes Spider-Woman, Firestar, Ultron and Blue Bolt.

==Fictional team biography==

=== Original run (1984–1994) ===
The team is founded by the Avenger Hawkeye in response to a suggestion by fellow Avenger, the Vision, who at the time (as team chairman) wished to expand the Avengers&#x27; influence. Hawkeye recruits Mockingbird, Wonder Man, Tigra, and Iron Man, with the last actually being Jim Rhodes as opposed to Tony Stark, a fact initially unknown to the team. Together, the team defeat a petty criminal called the Blank and later the Avengers foe Graviton.

The team would later take on Hank Pym as a scientific advisor and compound manager and battle a range of both old foes – including the Grim Reaper, Ultron, Graviton, and Zodiac – and new opponents such as Master Pandemonium. Former Fantastic Four member Thing and the heroine Firebird briefly allied themselves with the team. Henry Pym, who is saved by Firebird from a suicide attempt, and the adventurer Moon Knight formally join, while Iron Man is expelled for his actions during the Armor Wars. The &quot;Lost in Space-Time&quot; storyline began in issue #17 (February 1987) when Dominus sent the team back in time. The marriage of Hawkeye and Mockingbird is placed in jeopardy when, during this arc, she allows the Old West hero the Phantom Rider to die in a fall for deceiving and raping her.

After a trip to Hungary to investigate a report on Pym&#x27;s second wife, the Wasp, the Scarlet Witch, and the Vision assist the team. Mockingbird, Tigra and Moon Knight leave the team together as a new short lived team called the Ex-WACOs over the Avengers rule of not killing in regards to Mockingbird&#x27;s encounter with Phantom Rider. The Vision and the Scarlet Witch join the team as to not leave it short handed. Former Avenger ally Mantis makes a brief appearance. Agents from multiple governments then abduct the Vision and dismantle him due to his return to the team. The Avengers recover the parts and Dr. Pym rebuilds the Vision but with a chalk-white complexion. Wonder Man, however, does not allow his brain patterns to be used again to provide a matrix for the Vision&#x27;s emotions, explaining that the original process, done without his consent, had &quot;ripped out his soul&quot;. Although Wonder Man&#x27;s own love for the Scarlet Witch leads him to feel guilt, he justifies his actions by claiming the Vision was never anything but a copy of him, a claim that a number of other Avengers, including the Wasp, accept. This, along with damage to the Vision&#x27;s synthetic skin when he was dismantled, results in the synthezoid&#x27;s resurrection as a colorless and emotionless artificial human. The unstable U.S. Agent is assigned to the team as a watchdog by the US government to monitor the team&#x27;s activities.

A group of odd super-humans decide to mimic the Avengers and become the Great Lakes Avengers, while the original Human Torch returns from his own apparent demise. This casts doubt on the Vision&#x27;s identity, who was previously believed to have been created from the Torch&#x27;s body. The Vision and the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s children conceived via the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s hex powers are then revealed to be fragments of the soul of the demon Mephisto, who had been broken apart by Franklin Richards shortly before the birth of the twins. The twins were absorbed back into Mephisto, which temporarily drives the Scarlet Witch insane. Although she eventually recovers, the Scarlet Witch and the Vision separate, each operating on a different Avengers team.

Iron Man rejoins, and the mutant Quicksilver assists the team when the Scarlet Witch aligns herself with their father Magneto during a period in which she suffers from a mental breakdown. Immortus is finally confronted and revealed to be the cause of much of the team&#x27;s misfortune, and is finally defeated. Hank Pym, the Wasp and Quicksilver then leave the team, with Machine Man becoming reservists and Spider-Woman and the Living Lightning joining as full-time members. Spider-Man guest-stars in issues #84–86.

The team battle Ultron and his new creation Alkhema several times, and Hawkeye assumes his old identity of Goliath, during the Avengers crossover Operation: Galactic Storm, and reconciles with Mockingbird. Iron Man and Wonder Man leave the team, and are replaced by War Machine (Jim Rhodes, one of the founding West Coast Avengers) and Darkhawk, with the latter acting as a reservist. During a battle with the demons Mephisto and Satannish, Mockingbird is killed. Due to constant in-fighting and a general lack of organization, Captain America intervenes and disbands the team. Several members of the West Coast team—including a returned Iron Man—are unhappy about the decision and leave to form another team, called Force Works. This team, however, has several setbacks and quickly disbands, with the members returning to the main Avengers team.

Years later, the West Coast Avengers compound would be reopened as the new campus for the Avengers Academy following the destruction of the Infinite Avengers Mansion as seen in the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline.

=== Volume 3 (2018 series) ===
During the Fresh Start relaunch, both Hawkeyes – team founder Clint Barton and his successor Kate Bishop – decided to revive the West Coast Avengers following an attack by land sharks in Santa Monica. Out of the rejected candidates like Bread-Boy (a man dressed as bread with bread-based catchphrases), Broken Watch (who claims to have the ability to be correct twice in a day), Dark Paladin (who was too dark), Dee-Va (who tried to seduce Clint), Doctor Mole (a humanoid mole who thought he was auditioning for the television show &quot;The Mole Men of Los Angeles&quot;), Dutch Oven (who was wrapped in a blanket), Scorp (a man in a scorpion suit), Silver Snowboarder (whose powers only work in the snow), Spider-King (a man covered in spiders who claims that he is a mutate), Surf Doctor (a doctor/surfer character), and Wolver-Mean (whose steak knives are strapped to his hands by rubber bands), Clint and Kate recruited America Chavez and Kate&#x27;s boyfriend Johnny &quot;Fuse&quot; Watts, who helped in the mission, and were eventually joined by Gwen Poole and Quentin Quire. Given their lack of funds, the newly formed team tried to get financiers by starring in a reality show following their exploits.

The West Coast Avengers later went up against Madame Masque and her West Coast incarnation of the Masters of Evil which consists of Eel, Graviton, Lady Bullseye, MODOK Superior, Satana, and Kate&#x27;s parents Derek Bishop and Eleanor Bishop. Gwen adopts a baby land shark which she names Jeff – Barton allowing Jeff to stay as long as he does not bite anyone besides supervillains.

During &quot;The War of the Realms&quot; storyline, the West Coast Avengers worked with Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus&#x27; mind in a Proto-Clone body) and the Fantastic Four against the Frost Giants.

=== Volume 4 (2024 series) ===
Iron Man and War Machine later reform the West Coast Avengers as part of a plot to rehabilitate some supervillains. With Spider-Woman and ex-criminal Blue Bolt joining the group, they start with Ultron. Firestar later joined the West Coast Avengers when it comes to fighting the Sovereign Sons. The West Coast Avengers go up against the Gospel of Ultrons that is led by an Ultron called The One as they are the results of Ultron continuing to split himself after separating from Hank Pym.

==Other versions==
In the Ultimate Marvel reality, a secret team of Ultimates was formed in the &quot;Ultimate Comics: Ultimates&quot;. The team members include Quake as the leader, Wonder Man, the Vision, the Black Knight, and Tigra. The team was assigned to kill a wanted terrorist until Wonder Man went unstable. This forced the abandonment of the mission and Nick Fury put the team into stasis until needed. Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. had planned to use them against the villainous Reed Richards and his Children of Tomorrow. Thanks to the civil war, California Governor Ford discovered the newly christened West Coast Ultimates and set them against the Ultimates.

<text>Another Stakeout is a 1993 American buddy cop action comedy film directed by John Badham and starring Richard Dreyfuss, Emilio Estevez, and Rosie O&#x27;Donnell. It is a sequel to the 1987 film, &quot;Stakeout&quot;. Unlike its predecessor, the film was neither a critical nor a commercial success.

==Plot==
Luella Delano (Cathy Moriarty), a witness against the Mafia, is being hidden in the desert until the trial. A hitman blows up the house using a sewage removal truck to pump gas under it. The violent attempt against her kills her husband, several of her guards and she disappears.

Chris Lecce (Richard Dreyfuss) and Bill Reimers (Emilio Estevez), after an undercover detail goes wrong (the man who has been killing homeless people gets shot with Chris&#x27;s gun), are called upon to stake out the lakeside home where Luella is believed to be.

Unlike their earlier stakeout, this time they are accompanied by assistant DA Gina Garrett (Rosie O&#x27;Donnell) and her pet rottweiler &#x27;Archie&#x27;. Their cover is husband, wife, and son.

When Chris arrives home, his girlfriend Maria (Madeleine Stowe) is kicking him out, as he will not marry her, although they have been together for six years. Chris does not want to, as his family has the worst track record in marriage, including his own divorce.

However, he, Bill, and Gina must continue with their stakeout of Brian and Pam O&#x27;Hara to make sure Luella is safe. The trio are given use of a red convertible and a judge&#x27;s summer house next to the O&#x27;Haras&#x27; as cover.

The trio meet the couple upon arrival, as Archie chases a cat onto their property. Bill sends Gina for a run after Brian the next morning. When all three are not watching, the O&#x27;Haras leave the house. Bill sneaks in to bug the place, but has to abort the mission.

Gina invites them to their house that night for a dinner party so Bill can plant several bugs around theirs. She and Chris freak out the couple by acting odd. Then things take a turn for the worse when Bill is knocked unconscious after being mistaken for a hit man.

Luana has subdued Bill, not knowing he is there to protect her. Her friends, the O&#x27;Haras find her with the bound, gagged and hooded man, who she insists they must kill. As she is about to shoot him at the end of the pier, he flips off it, freeing himself.

Gina and Chris appear, subduing Luana. In custody, she asks to talk to the O&#x27;Haras in person. Chris and Bill are packing up to leave when they spot Tony the hitman. Hurrying to warn them in the other house, there they are initially shot at as Luella insists it is they who are the hitmen.

Tony kills the corrupt District Attorney for his interference. Then he takes Gina hostage, despite Chris and Bill having their guns drawn. While walking Gina at gunpoint past the pool in pursuit of Luella, Tony is attacked by Archie for threatening Gina and they both fall into the pool. He shoots at Luella but hits Gina in the shoulder instead, then gets shot and killed by Chris and Bill.

Both Chris and Bill are congratulated as heroes by the FBI, Luella and Gina. Chris returns to his apartment to call Maria, but she is already there. He proposes and she accepts, while Bill watches through binoculars from the car.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 16% based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 4.48/10. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three stars in his review, the same as his rating for the first film, describing it as &quot;chewing gum for the mind. This one holds its flavor better than most.&quot; Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Another Stakeout&quot; (MPAA rated PG-13, for two comic-action violence scenes) is neither the best nor worst of a bloated lot of unimaginative sequels. It&#x27;s pretty much what it&#x27;s [sic] title suggests: another stakeout, another sequel. Another day, another dollar.&quot;

===Box office===

The sequel debuted at number 9 at the US box office with $5.4 million in its opening weekend. It eventually grossed just $20.2 million in the United States and Canada and $9.4 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $29.6 million, less than its $30 million budget.

<doc id="733913" wikidata="Q142087" url="?curid=733913" title="Sainte-Thérèse, Quebec">
<text>Sainte-Thérèse () is an off-island suburb northwest of Montreal, in southwestern Quebec, Canada, in the Thérèse-De Blainville Regional County Municipality.

The town is mostly known as a home for heavy industry, but it is also a centre of recreational and tourist activities. It is near the southern limit of a web of cross-country ski trails which meander through the Laurentides. Heading north, it is possible to undertake several nature-filled days of skiing towards major resort centres such as Mont-Tremblant.

During the summer, many of the ski trails are used as dedicated bicycle paths, making it possible to undertake day-long or week-long cycling excursions through unspoiled areas, from one resort area to another, without sharing the right of way with motorized vehicles.
== History ==
On September 23, 1683, in recognition of his military services, Joseph-Antoine Le Febvre de La Barre (governor of New France) granted the seigneury of the Thousand Islands to Michel-Sidrac Dugué de Boisbriand. The exploitation of the seigneury of 9 square miles began in 1714 when Marie-Thérèse Dugué de Boisbriand and her husband Charles Piot de Langloiserie took possession of the seigneury. In 1715, Langloiserie died and his wife, not having the energy to take care of the work of colonizing the land, left the Seigneurie abandoned.

It was not until 1743 when Suzanne de Langloiserie and her husband Jean-Baptiste Céloron de Blainville took possession of the land. On October 15, 1789, Marie-Anne Thérèse de Blainville, to whom the Seigneury of Blainville was bequeathed jointly with her sister Marie-Hypolite de Blainville, inaugurated the parish of Sainte-Thérèse-d&#x27;Ávila.
On June 1, 1849, the Village of Sainte-Thérèse was created following a request from Louis Marteau, Paul Filiatrault and Joseph-Benjamin Lachaîne to the Terrebonne County Parish Council. The Village will officially become a Town in 1916.

== Economy ==
The city was for several decades the home of Sicard Industries, the biggest maker of snow blowers in the world.

There is also a Paccar plant that manufactures light and medium-duty Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks.

Home and garden company, Botanix, originate from Sainte-Thérèse. Founders and brothers, Guy and Wilfred Dion, started a business that would become Pavage Dion and Centre du Jardin Dion. Groupe Rona stepped in and expanded the company to become one of the largest landscaping and flower company in Québec.

Sainte-Thérèse formerly had a number of piano factories, including Pianos Lesage.

Before the General Motors plant arrival in 1966 (in neighbouring Ste-Thérèse Ouest, now Boisbriand), Agricultural and equipment company Machineries Dion was the biggest employer of the region. Steel combines were design and produce from 1940 and beyond. Steel foundry, state of the art workshop, cast iron parts and ingenious thinking made Machineries Dion a leader in the equipment market. Inventors of the first pull-type forage harvester in the world with macerating rolls for hay and corn (invented in the 1970s, which would later become important in a Claas vs John Deere proprietary patent lawsuit). After the initial success, more divisions would emerge; concrete silos, maple syrup extraction equipment and agricultural technology development soon followed.

==Transportation==
Sainte-Thérèse is served by the Sainte-Thérèse commuter rail station on the Exo (Réseau de transport métropolitain) Saint-Jérôme line. Local bus service is provided by CIT Laurentides.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Sainte-Thérèse had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="733927" wikidata="Q495513" url="?curid=733927" title="Outbreak (1995 film)">
<text>Outbreak is a 1995 American medical disaster film directed by Wolfgang Petersen and written by Laurence Dworet and Robert Roy Pool. The film stars Dustin Hoffman, Rene Russo, Morgan Freeman and Donald Sutherland, and co-stars Cuba Gooding Jr., Kevin Spacey and Patrick Dempsey.

The film focuses on an outbreak of Motaba, a fictional &quot;ebolavirus&quot;- and &quot;orthomyxoviridae&quot;-like virus, in Zaire, and later in a small town in California. It is set primarily in the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the fictional town of Cedar Creek, California. &quot;Outbreak&quot; plot speculates how far military and civilian agencies might go to contain the spread of a deadly, contagious disease.

The film, released by Warner Bros. March 10, 1995, was a box-office success, and Spacey won two awards for his performance. A real-life outbreak of the Ebola virus was occurring in Zaire when the film was released. The film&#x27;s popularity resurged during the COVID-19 pandemic, ranking as the fourth most streamed film in the United States on Netflix, March 13, 2020.

==Plot==
In 1967, during the Stanleyville mutinies, a virus called Motaba, which causes a deadly fever, is discovered in the African jungle. To keep the virus a secret, U.S. Army officers Donald McClintock and William Ford destroy the camp where soldiers were infected, killing all occupants.

Twenty-eight years later, Colonel Sam Daniels, a USAMRIID virologist, investigates an outbreak in Zaire which wiped out an entire village aside from two survivors (the shaman and a young boy). He and his crew — Lieutenant Colonel Casey Schuler and new recruit Major Salt — gather information and return to the United States. Ford, now a brigadier general, and Daniels&#x27; superior officer, dismisses the latter&#x27;s fears that the virus will spread.

A white-headed capuchin monkey that is host to the virus is smuggled into the country. James &quot;Jimbo&quot; Scott, a worker at a California animal testing laboratory, is infected when he steals the monkey. Jimbo tries to sell the monkey to Rudy Alvarez, a pet-store proprietor, but Alvarez refuses to buy it. The monkey scratches Rudy and he later becomes infected. A hospital technician in Cedar Creek is also infected after accidentally breaking a vial of Rudy&#x27;s blood.

Jimbo releases the monkey into the woods outside Palisades. While flying to Boston, Jimbo develops symptoms and infects his girlfriend, Alice, at the airport. Their illness is investigated by Dr. Roberta Keough, a CDC scientist and Daniels&#x27;s ex-wife. Jimbo, Alice, and Rudy die, but Keough determines no one else in Boston was infected.

In Cedar Creek, the virus quickly mutates into an airborne, influenza-like strain, after many are infected in a movie theatre. Daniels flies to Cedar Creek against Ford&#x27;s orders, joining Keough&#x27;s team with Schuler and Salt. As they search for the monkey, the Army quarantines the town and imposes martial law. Schuler is infected when his suit tears, and Keough accidentally sticks herself with a contaminated needle.

When Ford provides an experimental serum that cures the original strain, Daniels realizes that his superiors knew about the virus before the outbreak. Daniels learns about Operation Clean Sweep, a military plan to contain the virus by bombing Cedar Creek, incinerating the entire town and its residents, ostensibly to prevent Motaba&#x27;s expansion to pandemic proportions. However, McClintock, now a major general, wants to conceal the mutated virus&#x27;s existence, and preserve the original strain as a biological weapon.

To prevent Daniels from finding a cure, McClintock orders him arrested for carrying the virus. Daniels escapes, and he and Salt fly a helicopter to the ship at sea that carried the monkey. Daniels obtains a photo of the monkey and releases it to the media; a mother in Palisades contacts the CDC upon realizing her young daughter has been playing with the monkey (which she named Betsy). Daniels and Salt arrive and Salt tranquilizes Betsy. Ford delays the bombing after Daniels informs him Betsy was captured.

On their return flight, Daniels and Salt are pursued by McClintock in another helicopter. Salt fires two rockets into the trees, setting them afire to simulate a crash. Back in Cedar Creek, Salt mixes Betsy&#x27;s antibodies with Ford&#x27;s serum to create an antiserum; although Schuler has died, they save Keough. McClintock returns to base and resumes Operation Clean Sweep, refusing to listen to Ford. Daniels and Salt fly their helicopter directly into the bomber&#x27;s path to its target.

With Ford&#x27;s help, Daniels persuades the bomber&#x27;s flight crew to detonate the thermobaric bomb over water and spare the town. Before McClintock can order another bombing, Ford relieves him of command and orders his arrest. Daniels and Keough reconcile as Cedar Creek&#x27;s residents are cured.

==Cast==
==Production==
Scenes in &quot;Cedar Creek&quot; were filmed in Ferndale, California, where tanks and helicopters were a common feature of daily life during nearly two months of filming. Other locations used were Dugway Proving Ground and Kauai.

Harrison Ford was offered the role of Sam Daniels, but turned it down. Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson were also offered the role, but once again turned it down.

Producer Lynda Obst has stated it was due to the production of &quot;Outbreak&quot; that her film adaptation of &quot;The Hot Zone&quot; was dropped by 20th Century Fox, despite having, in her words, &quot;the better package and ... the better script&quot;. She also claimed that director Wolfgang Petersen tried to entice Robert Redford, who was already cast for her film, to be a part of &quot;Outbreak&quot;, based on Redford&#x27;s call to her. Obst would eventually have her adaptation of the book, but greenlit as a miniseries by &quot;National Geographic&quot;, which premiered in May 2019.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;Outbreak&quot; was a commercial success. It topped the U.S. box-office list its opening weekend with a gross of $13.4 million, and spent three weeks at number one before &quot;Tommy Boy&quot;″s release. It was number one in Japan for six weeks. The film grossed $67.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $122.2 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $189.9 million.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Outbreak&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. According to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 59% of 64 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.7 out of 10. The website&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;A frustratingly uneven all-star disaster drama, &quot;Outbreak&quot; ultimately proves only mildly contagious and leaves few lasting side effects.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 21 critic reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on a scale of A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it three and a half stars of four, calling &quot;Outbreak&quot; premise &quot;one of the great scare stories of our time, the notion that deep in the uncharted rain forests, deadly diseases are lurking, and if they ever escape their jungle homes and enter the human bloodstream, there will be a new plague the likes of which we have never seen.&quot;

Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; also enjoyed the film&#x27;s plot: &quot;&quot;Outbreak&quot; is an absolute hoot thanks primarily to director Wolfgang Petersen&#x27;s rabid pacing and the great care he brings to setting up the story and its probability.&quot;

David Denby wrote for &quot;New York&quot; magazine that although the opening scenes were well-done, &quot;somewhere in the middle ... &quot;Outbreak&quot; falls off a cliff&quot; and becomes &quot;lamely conventional&quot;.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found the film&#x27;s subject compelling, but its treatment ineffective: &quot;The film&#x27;s shallowness also contributes to the impression that no problem is too thorny to be solved by movie heroics.&quot;

====Scientific accuracy====
The film&#x27;s scientific liberties have been criticized, especially compared to the realism of the 2011 film &quot;Contagion&quot;. Implausibilities include the virus taking only an hour, rather than days, to multiply; the synthesis of the cure taking less than a minute, rather than many months; and the injection of the cure producing immediate improvement.

<text>Chemical physics is a branch of physics that studies chemical processes from a physical point of view. It focuses on understanding the physical properties and behavior of chemical systems, using principles from both physics and chemistry. This field investigates physicochemical phenomena using techniques from atomic and molecular physics and condensed matter physics.

The United States Department of Education defines chemical physics as &quot;A program that focuses on the scientific study of structural phenomena combining the disciplines of physical chemistry and atomic/molecular physics. Includes instruction in heterogeneous structures, alignment and surface phenomena, quantum theory, mathematical physics, statistical and classical mechanics, chemical kinetics, and laser physics.&quot;

== Distinction between Chemical Physics and Physical Chemistry ==
While at the interface of physics and chemistry, chemical physics is distinct from physical chemistry as it focuses more on using physical theories to understand and explain chemical phenomena at the microscopic level, such as quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and molecular dynamics. Meanwhile, physical chemistry uses a broader range of methods, such as thermodynamics and kinetics, to study the physical nature of chemical processes. On the other hand, physical chemistry deals with the physical properties and behavior of matter in chemical reactions, covering a broader range of topics such as thermodynamics, kinetics, and spectroscopy, and often links the macroscopic and microscopic chemical behavior. The distinction between the two fields still needs to be clarified as both fields share common grounds. Scientists often practice in both fields during their research, as there is significant overlap in the topics and techniques used. Journals like PCCP (Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics) cover research in both areas, highlighting their overlap.

== History ==
The term &quot;chemical physics&quot; in its modern sense was first used by the German scientist A. Eucken, who published &quot;A Course in Chemical Physics&quot; in 1930. Prior to this, in 1927, the publication &quot;Electronic Chemistry&quot; by V. N. Kondrat&#x27;ev, N. N. Semenov, and Iu. B. Khariton hinted at the meaning of &quot;chemical physics&quot; through its title. The Institute of Chemical Physics of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR was established in 1931. In the United States, &quot;The Journal of Chemical Physics&quot; has been published since 1933.

In 1964, the General Electric Foundation established the Irving Langmuir Award in Chemical Physics to honor outstanding achievements in the field of chemical physics. Named after the Nobel Laureate Irving Langmuir, the award recognizes significant contributions to understanding chemical phenomena through physics principles, impacting areas such as surface chemistry and quantum mechanics.

==What chemical physicists do==
Chemical physicists investigate the structure and dynamics of ions, free radicals, polymers, clusters, and molecules. Their research includes studying the quantum mechanical aspects of chemical reactions, solvation processes, and the energy flow within and between molecules, and nanomaterials such as quantum dots. Experiments in chemical physics typically involve using spectroscopic methods to understand hydrogen bonding, electron transfer, the formation and dissolution of chemical bonds, chemical reactions, and the formation of nanoparticles.

The research objectives in the theoretical aspect of chemical physics are to understand how chemical structures and reactions work at the quantum mechanical level. This field also aims to clarify how ions and radicals behave and react in the gas phase and to develop precise approximations that simplify the computation of the physics of chemical phenomena.

Chemical physicists are looking for answers to such questions as:

* Can we experimentally test quantum mechanical predictions of the vibrations and rotations of simple molecules? Or even those of complex molecules (such as proteins)?
*Can we develop more accurate methods for calculating the electronic structure and properties of molecules?
* Can we understand chemical reactions from first principles?
* Why do quantum dots start blinking (in a pattern suggesting fractal kinetics) after absorbing photons?
* How do chemical reactions really take place?
* What is the step-by-step process that occurs when an isolated molecule becomes solvated? Or when a whole ensemble of molecules becomes solvated?
* Can we use the properties of negative ions to determine molecular structures, understand the dynamics of chemical reactions, or explain photodissociation?
* Why does a stream of soft x-rays knock enough electrons out of the atoms in a xenon cluster to cause the cluster to explode?

<text>In cinematography, full frame refers to an image area (today most commonly on a digital sensor) that is the same size as that used by a 35mm &quot;still&quot; camera. Still cameras run the film &quot;horizontally&quot; behind the lens, whereas standard 35mm motion-picture cameras run the film &quot;vertically&quot;. Thus a 35mm still camera&#x27;s image is significantly larger than that of a standard 35mm motion-picture camera.

Specialty motion-picture formats have used film running horizontally, notably VistaVision (which produced a &quot;full-frame&quot; image) and Imax.

Historically, most digital cinema cameras have used Super-35-sized (similar to APS-C) sensors, largely to maintain compatibility with existing lenses and to produce traditional &quot;cinematic&quot; depth of field and field of view.

Full-frame cameras require lenses with larger optics, and produce shallower depth of field than conventional 35mm cinema cameras.

<doc id="733931" wikidata="Q142333" url="?curid=733931" title="Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville">
<text>Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville () is an off-island suburb of Montreal, in southwestern Quebec, Canada, on the south bank of the Saint Lawrence River just east of Montreal. It lies on the west flank of Mont Saint-Bruno, one of the Monteregian Hills. The population as of the Canada 2021 Census was 26,273.

The city is well known to Montrealers and its neighbouring population for Mont Saint-Bruno, location to both Mont-Saint-Bruno National Park and Ski Mont Saint-Bruno, a ski facility and school.

There are two prevailing hypotheses on the origin of the city&#x27;s name:
* That the city was named after Bruno of Cologne and the Montarville seigneury. The name &quot;Montarville&quot; is a homonym of a village of Eure-et-Loir in France: Montharville, whose etymology is uncertain. The name was written in its Latin form, &quot;Mons Harvilla&quot; in the 12th century – in other words &quot;&quot;Haric&quot;&#x27;s farm&#x27;s mount&quot;, a name of Germanic origins also found in Harville (&quot;Hairici villa&quot;, 9th century). However, this uncommon composition of a Roman appellation (&quot;mont&quot;) associated with the Norman toponymy &quot;-ville&quot; place name casts doubts on this explication. It could be the name of an unidentified Germanic individual.
* Quebec&#x27;s toponymy commission suggests another hypothesis to explain the origin of the city&#x27;s name. &quot;Montarville&quot; could be a portmanteau of &quot;montagne&quot; (French for mountain) and &quot;Boucherville&quot; after Pierre Boucher de Boucherville, the region&#x27;s first seigneur. The hypothesis rests on the fact that the descendants of de Boucherville were named Montarville, Niverville, etc. The patron saint of the city could be explained by the sale of the seigneury to François-Pierre Bruneau, whose name was slightly transformed.

===The seigneury of Montarville===

Pierre Boucher de Boucherville Junior was granted the Montarville seigneury in 1710 by the governor of New France Philippe de Rigaud de Vaudreuil. In 1723, it was noted that clearing had not begun and no one was inhabiting the seigneury yet.

The ownership remained in the Boucher family until 1829, when René Boucher de la Bruère sold half his land and his rights as a seigneur to François-Pierre Bruneau of Montréal. He died in 1851 and his brother Oliver-Théophile Bruneau (who was the first professor of anatomy at McGill University), was the last seigneur of Montarville from 1851 until the seigneural system was abolished in 1854.

While agriculture was the primary subsistence and economical activity of the region, the seigneury of Montarville, thanks to its proximity to Mount Saint-Bruno, benefited much from the industrial activity that developed around the hydraulic power it could harvest from the mountain&#x27;s many ponds and streams. The first water mill was erected in 1725 and in the 19th century, they numbered six in the territory and permitted such activities as grinding grain, milling wood, tanning leather and carding and spinning wool.

The 19th century also saw the diversification of the seigneury&#x27;s agricultural activities through increased animal husbandry, orchards, and maple syrup collection.

===From parish to village to city===

At the beginning of the 19th century, families residing on the western flank of the mountain were under the clerical responsibility of the parish of Boucherville while families from the southern flank were under the responsibility of the parish of Saint-Joseph de Chambly. As a consequence, the tithe was being paid to two different parishes, so in 1809 a first request to transform the seigneury into a parish was made to Mgr Joseph-Octave Plessis, Archbishop of Quebec. This request was met with a refusal. It would be thirty-three years before the Montarvillans attempted to form into their own parish again.

It is worth mentioning that in 1838 during the Patriotes Rebellion, François-Pierre Bruneau&#x27;s manor was occupied by the Patriotes and that one of them, André Proteau, was from the seigneury.

In 1842, a petition totaling about sixty signatures was presented to Mgr Ignace Bourget, Bishop of Montreal who agreed to the demand, and in the same year he signed a canonical decree officiating the creation of the parish of Saint-Bruno. François-Pierre Bruneau was honored with the choice of the titular saint, Saint Bruno.

In line with the Durham Report&#x27;s recommendation to modernize municipal structures in 1840 (culminating in the abolition of the seigneury system in 1854) and the &quot;Acte pour abroger certaines ordonnances et pour faire de meilleures dispositions pour l&#x27;établissement d&#x27;autorités locales et municipales dans le Bas-Canada&quot; (Act to abrogate certain ordinances and to make better dispositions to establish local and municipal authorities in Lower-Canada), on 1 July 1845 the Legislative Assembly created more than 325 municipal corporations in eastern Canada of which Saint-Bruno, then with a population of 800, was a part. The following year on 9 October 1846, the parish municipality of Saint-Bruno was born through an official proclamation. For a few years, Saint-Bruno remained part of the municipality of Chambly but in 1855, as mandated by the &quot;Loi constituant en municipalités toutes paroisses de plus de 300 personnes&quot; (Law making into a municipality every parish of more than 300 persons), the parish municipality became fully autonomous and its two names, &quot;Saint-Bruno&quot; and &quot;Montarville&quot;, were joined into the designation still used to this day.

It incorporated as a city in 1958.

===Merger and demerger===

In 2000, the Parti Québécois governments of Lucien Bouchard and Bernard Landry introduced a series of legislative measures with the intent of reorganizing and merging many of Quebec&#x27;s municipalities. In 2002, following the adoption of bill 170, Saint-Bruno merged with other municipalities on Montreal&#x27;s south shore to form the city of Longueuil. Following public outcry and a referendum, the city demerged from Longueuil and was reconstituted on 1 January 2006, but remained within the agglomeration of Longueuil, which remains responsible for a series of services to the population.

<text>The DAF-2 gene encodes for the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor in the worm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;. DAF-2 is part of the first metabolic pathway discovered to regulate the rate of aging. DAF-2 is also known to regulate reproductive development, resistance to oxidative stress, thermotolerance, resistance to hypoxia, and resistance to bacterial pathogens. Mutations in DAF-2 and also Age-1 have been shown by Cynthia Kenyon to double the lifespan of the worms. In a 2007 episode of WNYC’s Radiolab, Kenyon called DAF-2 &quot;the grim reaper gene.”

==Long-lived mutants==

Long-lived &quot;DAF-2&quot; &quot;C. elegans&quot; mutants are resistant to the oxidizing agent paraquat and to UV light. &quot;DAF-2&quot; mutants also have a higher DNA repair capability than wild-type &quot;C. elegans&quot;. Knockdown of the nucleotide excision repair gene &quot;Xpa-1&quot; increases sensitivity to UV and reduces the life span of the long-lived mutants. These findings support the hypothesis that DNA damage has a significant role in the aging process.

== IGF-1 signal pathway ==
Insulin/IGF-1-like signaling is well-conserved evolutionarily across animal phyla, from single celled organisms to mammals. DAF-2 is the only member of the insulin receptor family in &quot;C. elegans&quot; but it corresponds, in form and function, to multiple pathways in humans. The protein predicted from DAF-2&#x27;s sequence is 35% identical to the human insulin receptor, which regulates metabolism; 34% identical to the IGF-1 receptor, which regulates growth; and 33% identical to the human insulin receptor–related receptor. In &quot;C. elegans&quot;, the insulin/IGF-1/FOXO pathway is initiated by changes in IGF-1 levels which cause IGF-1 receptors to start a phosphorylation cascade that deactivates the FOXO transcription factor, DAF-16. When not phosphorylated, DAF-16 is active and present in the nucleus. DAF-16 is responsible for up-regulating transcription of about 100 genes that code for cell protecting products such as heat shock proteins and antioxidants. Genetic analysis reveals that the presence of functioning DAF-16 is required to produce the extended lifespan observed in DAF-2 knock-downs. By silencing DAF-16, activation of DAF-2 receptors can ultimately compromise a cell’s ability to mitigate harmful environmental conditions. In most eukaryotes, insulin activates DAF-2 signaling. However, both human insulin and insulin coded for by orthologous genes in &quot;C. elegans&quot; inhibit DAF-2 receptors in &quot;C. elegans&quot;.

== Role in &quot;C. elegans&quot; developmental stages ==
&quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, which progresses through a series of larval stages into a final reproductive adult, may instead enter a less metabolically active dauer diapause stage if food scarcity or overcrowding occurs before reaching adulthood. Disabling DAF-2 arrests development in the dauer stage which increases longevity, delays senescence and prevents reproductive maturity.

== Diet’s interaction with the IGF-1 pathway ==
Research into the interaction between diet and the insulin/IGF-1 pathway has shown sugar intake to be negatively correlated with DAF-16 activity and longevity. One study found that glucose ingestion reduced the rate of dauer formation and shortened the life-spans of DAF-2 knock-downs to resemble that of normal &quot;C. elegans&quot;, suggesting that DAF-16 mediated gene expression associated with longevity is suppressed by glucose ingestion. Wild type &quot;C. elegans&quot; fed a diet that included 2% glucose showed reduced Daf-16 activity and lifespan was shortened by 20% compared to worms fed on glucose-free media. These findings raise the possibility that a low-sugar diet might have beneficial effects on life span in higher organisms.

<doc id="733947" wikidata="Q844791" url="?curid=733947" title="Please (Pet Shop Boys album)">
<text>Please is the debut studio album by English synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys, released on 24 March 1986 by Parlophone in the United Kingdom and by EMI America Records in the United States. According to the duo, the album&#x27;s title was chosen so that people could go into a record shop and say &quot;Can I have the Pet Shop Boys album, please?&quot; &quot;Please&quot; featured the number one hit &quot;West End Girls&quot; and nine other songs, including the singles &quot;Opportunities (Let&#x27;s Make Lots of Money)&quot;, &quot;Love Comes Quickly&quot;, and &quot;Suburbia&quot;.

==Background and composition==
Pet Shop Boys signed with Parlophone, a subsidiary of EMI Records, in March 1985. By that time, Chris Lowe and Neil Tennant had been writing songs together for over three years. Their music was influenced by Italian disco, the emerging American hip-hop scene, and American producer Bobby Orlando&#x27;s lo-fi electronic dance music. The duo had recorded some of their material with Orlando, including &quot;West End Girls&quot;, which had been released as an unsuccessful single in 1984. Lyrically, the songs were inspired by their life in London at the time, with lyricist Tennant assuming different characters and occasionally writing satirical songs, such as &quot;Opportunities (Let&#x27;s Make Lots of Money)&quot;.

==Recording==
&quot;Opportunities&quot; was the first single for their Parlophone deal. They had written the song in 1983 and had subsequently worked on it with Orlando but never released it. Pet Shop Boys picked J. J. Jeczalik of Art of Noise as producer. The recording session took three weeks and cost £40,000. When the single was released in July 1985, it only reached 116 on the UK Singles Chart. 

For their debut album, Pet Shop Boys wanted to work with Stephen Hague, the producer of Malcolm McLaren&#x27;s &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; and The World&#x27;s Famous Supreme Team&#x27;s &quot;Hey DJ&quot;. Their record company initially wanted them to use Stock Aitken Waterman, but Pet Shop Boys were allowed to record &quot;West End Girls&quot; with Hague as a trial. Hague suggested slowing the song down and making it moodier, with more focus on the story and a filmic intro of street sounds. &quot;West End Girls&quot; was released in October, and the single climbed to the top of charts as they went on to record the rest of the album.

&quot;Please&quot; was made in 10 weeks, between November 1985 and January 1986, at Advision Studios in London. They sequenced the songs to form a loose storyline: &quot;They run away in the first song [&quot;Two Divided by Zero&quot;], they arrive in the city (&quot;West End Girls&quot;), they want to make money (&quot;Opportunities&quot;), they fall in love (&quot;Love Comes Quickly&quot;), move to suburbia (&quot;Suburbia&quot;), go out clubbing (&quot;Tonight Is Forever&quot;), there&#x27;s violence in the city (&quot;Violence&quot;) and casual sex (&quot;I Want a Lover&quot;), someone tries to pick up a boy (&quot;Later Tonight&quot;)&quot;. The sequence ends with &quot;Why Don&#x27;t We Live Together?&quot;

&quot;Two Divided by Zero&quot;, dating back to 1983, was co-written by Tennant and Bobby Orlando, who wrote the backing track; it is the only Pet Shop Boys song, excluding cover versions, for which Lowe does not share a songwriting credit. 
For the album version, Hague used a similar arrangement but gave it a bigger sound that conveys the sense of excitement of running away. The track features the voice of a talking calculator that Tennant bought in New York as a Christmas present for his father. 

Hague shares a songwriting credit with the duo on &quot;Love Comes Quickly&quot; for coming up with the chord changes of the middle eight. The song was released as a single in February 1986 and just made the top 20 at number 19. &quot;Opportunities&quot; was reworked following the disappointing chart performance of its initial release. They did not have time to record a new version, but Hague used elements from the single as well as the 12-inch mix by Ron Dean Miller, and re-recorded the vocals. A portion of the original single, featuring a party scene, was used as the sixth track on the album, titled &quot;Opportunities (reprise)&quot;. &quot;Opportunities&quot; was re-released as a single in May 1986, and reached number 11 on the UK Singles Chart and number 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Hague decided to record &quot;Later Tonight&quot; live in the studio, with Tennant singing accompanied by Lowe on the piano. Lowe played trombone on &quot;I Want a Lover&quot;, originally recorded with Blue Weaver prior to the album sessions. &quot;Why Don&#x27;t We Live Together?&quot; was also recorded earlier in 1985 with Ron Dean Miller and was reworked by Hague with new drum programming. &quot;Suburbia&quot; was the last song completed for &quot;Please&quot;; due to time constraints, the album version is a polished version of the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; demo. When it was released as a single in September 1986, &quot;Suburbia&quot; was redone with producer Julian Mendelsohn and became the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; second top 10 hit in the UK.

==Release==
&quot;Please&quot; was released on 24 March 1986 and debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart. In the United States, &quot;Please&quot; is Pet Shop Boys&#x27; highest charting album, reaching number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and it is their only record to be certified platinum by the RIAA with over one million sales.

&quot;Please&quot; was re-released in 2001 (as were most of the duo&#x27;s studio albums up to that point) as &quot;Please: Further Listening 1984–1986&quot;. The re-released version was digitally remastered and came with a second disc of B-sides and previously unreleased material from around the time of the album&#x27;s original release. A remastered single-disc edition of &quot;Please&quot;, containing only the 11 original tracks, was released in 2009. In 2018, a newly remastered edition of &quot;Please: Further Listening 1984–1986&quot; was released, with the same contents as the 2001 edition.

&quot;Violence&quot; was later re-recorded by the Pet Shop Boys for a charity concert at The Haçienda nightclub in 1992. This version, known as the &#x27;Haçienda version&#x27;, was released as one of the B-sides to &quot;I Wouldn&#x27;t Normally Do This Kind of Thing&quot; and was then made available on the B-sides album &quot;Alternative&quot; and on &quot;Very: Further Listening 1992-1994&quot;.

&quot;Tonight Is Forever&quot; was later covered by Liza Minnelli on the Pet Shop Boys-produced album &quot;Results&quot;.

===Artwork===
For their first album cover, Pet Shop Boys manager Tom Watkins presented them with a fold-out latticework model, but they thought it was too complicated. In reaction, Mark Farrow created a minimalist white cover with a tiny photo of the duo in the center with their name and the title in small type underneath. The photo, taken by Eric Watson, shows Lowe and Tennant with white towels on their shoulders and was chosen from existing images for the way it blended into the background. The inner sleeve had 98 more small images by Eric Watson, Paul Rider, John Stoddard, Joe Shutter, Ian Hooton, Chris Burscough, and Chris Lowe. Some international distributors made changes to the cover: EMI America redid the cover with the name on the top, and in France a cover with a larger picture was made.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Please&quot; received a mix of reviews at the time of its release. In March 1986, &quot;Smash Hits&quot; reviewer Chris Heath gave the album a 9 out of 10 rating describing the content as &quot;ten thoroughly catchy songs&quot;. Writing in 1986 for &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Dance Trax&quot; column, Brian Chin described the album as an &quot;amusingly complete compendium of recent dance music styles. It should be a long-running hit for clubs if the remixes keep coming.&quot;

Eleanor Levy of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; gave &quot;Please&quot; 3.5 out of 5 stars in her review: &quot;Clean and crisp, these Pet Shop Boys—creating layer upon glossy layer of traditional early Eighties electronic trickery… All fairly conventionally unconventional, really. A vague veneer of experimentation covering comfortable pop sounds&quot;. She added, &quot;This is also a very accomplished debut album.&quot; In the same issue, Jim Reid called &quot;Please&quot; &quot;a cool, self-possessed, some might say cold, record. It would sound very good on CD… It&#x27;s an ambient record, a rather good record, but not a great record&quot;.

An article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; from May 1986 described a negative reaction by unspecified critics: &quot;...many critics have been gunning for [&quot;West End Girls&quot;], attacking with their heavy artillery. Nor have they been very kind to the debut album, &quot;Please&quot;—loaded with disco material of course... The problem is that most critics regard disco (or dance music, as they call it now) as one-dimensional noise pollution.&quot; The &quot;Trouser Press Record Guide&quot; panned the album: &quot;&quot;Please&quot; is a slick set of anonymous easy-listening disco tracks, brilliantly, soullessly produced (mostly by Stephen Hague), with ridiculous, overbearingly smug lyrics recited by Tennant… Ghastly, depressing and offensive.&quot;

Retrospectively, several reviewers have acknowledged the strength of the album as a starting point for the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; career. &quot;The debut Pet Shop Boys album does what all good debut albums should do and established the aesthetic of the band which would endure right to the present day,&quot; according to Martyn Young in a 2020 &quot;Clash&quot; feature. The AllMusic review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine called &quot;Please&quot; &quot;A collection of immaculately crafted and seamlessly produced synthesized dance-pop&quot; that &quot;sketches out the basic elements of the duo&#x27;s sound.&quot; In 2011, Josh Freeman of &quot;The Quietus&quot; suggested, &quot;perhaps, &quot;Please&quot; by Pet Shop Boys is the perfect first album. Although maybe not their best… &quot;Please&quot; is an assured and hugely successful (three million sales worldwide and counting) record containing some of their best-known songs. However, &quot;Please&quot; also acted as lift-off for Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe&#x27;s creative wanderlust.&quot; In a 2009 review for the BBC, Ian Wade wrote: &quot;&quot;Please&quot; really hasn&#x27;t dated at all and should be the textbook example of how brilliant a pop debut could be.&quot;

==Track listing==


===Notes===
* On LP and cassette copies, &quot;Opportunities&quot; (Reprise) is sequenced as a hidden track at the end of side A, acting as the outro to &quot;Suburbia&quot;.
* Track 4 on the &quot;Further Listening 1984–1986&quot; bonus disc is a previously unreleased mix, different from the actual 12&quot; version released in 1985 (dance mix) and which reappeared in 1986 (original dance mix).

<doc id="733950" wikidata="Q1655444" url="?curid=733950" title="Johnny Cage">
<text>Johnny Cage is a character in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. Introduced in the original 1992 game, he is an action film star with an extensive martial arts background. The series depicts Cage as one of the primary heroes defending Earthrealm from various threats, as well as the comic foil. In the first rebooted timeline, Cage is also the love interest of Special Forces officer Sonya Blade and the father of their daughter Cassie.

Cage is inspired by martial arts star Jean-Claude Van Damme, particularly Van Damme&#x27;s character, Frank Dux, in the 1988 film &quot;Bloodsport&quot;. A staple of the franchise, Cage has appeared in various media outside of the games. Reception of the character has been generally positive for his role in the series, character development, gameplay, and Fatality finishing moves.

==Concept and design==

Original concept sketches for a proposed fighting game by artist John Tobias showed a character called &quot;Michael Grimm, the current box office champion and star of such movies as &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Fist&quot;, &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Fist II&quot; and the award-winning &quot;Sudden Violence&quot;.&quot; Tobias later described them as &quot;R-rated really schlocky 1980s martial arts films&quot;. According to martial artist Daniel Pesina, who portrayed Cage in the original game and the 1993 sequel &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, Pesina used Iron Fist from the Power Man and Iron Fist comic series as the source of inspiration prior to the team settling on spoofing Van Damme.

Midway Games had hoped to license martial artist and actor Jean-Claude Van Damme for a fighting game that was intended to be modeled after Van Damme&#x27;s 1988 film &quot;Bloodsport&quot;. The company created a short demo reel that consisted of film footage of Van Damme inserted into a digital background in order to convince the actor to join the project, an attempt that was unsuccessful. When the game later became &quot;Mortal Kombat,&quot; the Michael Grimm character was retained as a spoof of Van Damme and renamed Johnny Cage, with Van Damme&#x27;s split-legged groin punch from &quot;Bloodsport&quot; consequently included as one of Cage&#x27;s special moves. &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; would later feature a special skin for Cage featuring Van Damme&#x27;s voice and likeness.

Cage&#x27;s real name of John Carlton was taken from Midway artist and programmer John Carlton, who worked on the &quot;NBA Jam&quot; arcade game series. Cage was the first character created for &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, and the test prototype of the original game had just two Cage characters fighting each other. In a 1995 interview with &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, Tobias said that Cage&#x27;s Fatality finishing move of punching off his opponent&#x27;s head was the final one created for the game, before which he was going to simply throw his opponent across the screen.

As a narcissistic Hollywood star, Cage serves as comic foil in contrast to the games&#x27; more serious characters like Liu Kang and Raiden, which is embellished in the 2011 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; reboot game with a large chest tattoo of his name. Cage&#x27;s main role in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; is as a Special Forces consultant instead of an actor; his design by NetherRealm Studios (formerly Midway Games) was their attempt to define whether or not he had taken his martial arts skills seriously since the aftermath of the 2011 reboot game, and he was outfitted in tactical gear that was designed to fit his fighting style while finding the balance between &quot;serious or stoic&quot; and &quot;too goofy&quot;. In &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, Cage&#x27;s gameplay style is split into three fighting variations like those of the other playable characters; Prima Games deemed him effective at zoning. A female alternate universe variant of Johnny named Janet Cage appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, initially as an NPC during the story mode before being added as a downloadable assist character, or &quot;Kameo Fighter&quot;.

=== Portrayal ===

Ashby, who had practiced martial arts before he was cast in the role, would later lend his voice and likeness to a downloadable skin for Cage in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;. Pat E. Johnson, the first film&#x27;s stunt choreographer, recommended Conrad as Ashby&#x27;s replacement to &quot;Annihilation&#x27;s&quot; producers.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games===
Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1992), Johnny Cage is a martial artist and actor who is tricked by the sorcerer Shang Tsung into entering the latter&#x27;s Mortal Kombat tournament to prove that he does not rely on special effects in his films and improve his marketability. In the sequel &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; (1993), Johnny disappears from the set of his latest film to join Earthrealm&#x27;s warriors, led by Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang, in traveling to the otherworldly dimension of Outworld to compete in a second Mortal Kombat and save their world from Outworld tyrant, Shao Kahn.

While Cage does not appear in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (1995) and &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, the 1996 compilation title &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot; reveals he was killed by Shao Kahn&#x27;s forces during the latter&#x27;s invasion of Earthrealm and Johnny&#x27;s journey to the afterlife was blocked due to the tyrant fusing Earthrealm with Outworld. Nonetheless, the merger restores Johnny&#x27;s soul and allows him to help his allies defeat Shao Kahn once more before ascending to heaven. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; (1997), at Johnny&#x27;s request, Raiden revives him so he can join his friends in fighting the disgraced former deity Shinnok.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; (2002), Johnny is in the midst of shooting a film based on his death and resurrection titled &quot;The Death of Johnny Cage&quot; when Raiden recruits him for a new mission in Outworld. However, Johnny and his fellow Earthrealm warriors are killed while trying to stop the titular Deadly Alliance from resurrecting the Dragon King Onaga. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; (2004), the first installment in which Johnny is not playable, he and the Earthrealm warriors are resurrected and brainwashed by Onaga to serve as his slaves until they are eventually freed by reformed ninja Ermac and Liu Kang.

Johnny returns in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; (2006), in which he participates in the titular Armageddon to claim the elemental Blaze&#x27;s godlike power, only to be killed once more. Additionally, according to his biography, Johnny became the de facto leader of Earthrealm&#x27;s forces after he has multiple visions of Shinnok and fights to stop him from taking over Shao Kahn&#x27;s empire.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011), due to Raiden altering the timeline to avert Armageddon, Johnny becomes a cocky and talkative martial arts actor and &quot;a descendant of an ancient Mediterranean cult who bred warriors for the gods&quot;. Additionally, he joins the Mortal Kombat tournament as a publicity stunt. While competing, he repeatedly flirts with Special Forces lieutenant Sonya Blade and initially sees the tournament as a joke until Raiden informs him of the consequences should Outworld win, convincing Johnny to join Earthrealm&#x27;s warriors. However, after defeating Reptile and Baraka, Johnny is beaten in the first competition by Earthrealm assassin Cyrax and eliminated from the second tournament by Ermac. After Shao Kahn launches an invasion of Earthrealm and his wife Queen Sindel slaughters the rest of their comrades, Johnny and Sonya are left as the only survivors.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; (2015), which takes place two years after the previous game, Johnny inadvertently discovers his special powers while rescuing Sonya from Shinnok and assists Raiden in imprisoning Shinnok inside a magical amulet. Johnny and Sonya later get married and have a daughter, Cassie Cage, but they divorce due to Sonya&#x27;s commitment to her career. A further twenty-five years later, Johnny joins a secret Special Forces unit under Sonya&#x27;s command. With help from his followers, Shinnok escapes from his amulet, kidnaps Johnny, and corrupts the source of Earthrealm&#x27;s life force. Having inherited her father&#x27;s powers, Cassie defeats Shinnok, rescues Johnny, and reunites the Cage family.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; (2019), which takes place another two years after the previous game, Johnny and Cassie grieve over Sonya&#x27;s death following a Special Forces attack on the Netherrealm. After the keeper of time Kronika causes a time storm in an attempt to remove Raiden from history, past versions of Johnny and Sonya are brought to the present. Disgusted by his younger self&#x27;s arrogance and misconduct around his version of Sonya, the present Johnny works with him to improve his attitude. Though the older Johnny successfully defends the Special Forces base from Kronika&#x27;s forces, he is injured in battle, while his and Sonya&#x27;s younger counterparts are kidnapped and forced to fight for the Black Dragon crime cartel&#x27;s entertainment. After Cassie leads a Special Forces unit to rescue them, the younger Johnny becomes inspired to be more like his future self. In the DLC story expansion &quot;Aftermath&quot;, the younger Johnny attempts to take part in a joint Earthrealm/Outworld assault on Kronika&#x27;s keep, only to be ambushed by Shao Kahn and Sindel, who take him and his family prisoner.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; (2023), after Fire God Liu Kang creates a second new timeline while stopping Kronika, Johnny has become a powerless and struggling actor whose expensive lifestyle drives away his ex-wife, Christina, whom he married before becoming famous. Not long after, he is confronted by former yakuza member Kenshi Takahashi, who seeks one of his recent purchases and a sacred Takahashi family sword, Sento. Their fight is interrupted by Liu Kang, who recruits them to represent Earthrealm in the Mortal Kombat tournament. Though Raiden is chosen as champion, Liu Kang sends the remaining representatives to capture Shang Tsung. All throughout, Johnny films his exploits to use as inspiration for future film projects and bonds with Kenshi. After the latter loses his eyes while saving him from a Tarkat-infected Princess Mileena, Johnny eventually and willingly gives Sento to Kenshi in return. Following Shang Tsung&#x27;s defeat, Johnny creates a multi-media franchise based on his adventures to gradually introduce Earthrealm to Outworld. In addition to the &quot;prime&quot; Johnny, Janet Cage of a gender-inverted timeline appears as a downloadable assist character, or &quot;Kameo Fighter&quot;, while Lieutenant Colonel Johnathan Cage of a World War II-esque timeline appears in the &quot;Khaos Reigns&quot; DLC.

===Other appearances===

Johnny Cage appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1995), portrayed by Linden Ashby. He, Liu Kang, and Sonya Blade are chosen by Raiden to participate in the eponymous tournament, with Johnny agreeing to prove himself as a legitimate fighter after being tricked by Shang Tsung. Johnny goes on to defeat Scorpion and Goro before Liu Kang replaces him in the final round. Additionally, Cage appears in the prequel &quot;Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins&quot;.

Johnny Cage makes a minor appearance in &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, portrayed by Chris Conrad. Amidst Shao Kahn&#x27;s invasion of Earthrealm, Sonya is taken hostage. Johnny successfully saves her, but is killed by the tyrant in the process.

Johnny Cage appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Rebirth&quot;, portrayed by Matt Mullins. This version is a faltering action star who works undercover for police officer Jackson Briggs before he is killed by Baraka.

Johnny Cage appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy&quot;, portrayed again by Matt Mullins in the first season and Casper Van Dien in the second season. This version is an unemployed television actor who had previously starred in &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;. In his self-titled episode, Cage, desperate to revive his flailing career, pitches reality show pilots that depict him engaging in vigilantism. However, he is rejected by two executives, one of whom would then steal his idea and pitch it to another actor. After assaulting the executive and two security guards, Shang Tsung approaches Cage to recruit him as a fighter for Outworld in the Mortal Kombat tournament. Cage declines before reluctantly joining Raiden&#x27;s warriors in representing Earthrealm in the tournament. Van Dien compared his career trajectory to that of Cage in a 2013 interview with MTV.

Johnny Cage appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (2020), &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Battle of the Realms&quot; (2021), and &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Cage Match&quot;, voiced by Joel McHale. Following minor appearances in the first two films, the third sees a young Cage taking up martial arts while in school before traveling the world to train in various fighting styles and eventually becoming an action star after saving a Hollywood producer from a mugger. By the 1980s, Cage becomes embroiled in the Brotherhood of Shadows&#x27; plot to summon Shinnok and joins forces with his assistant Chuck Golden and demonness Ashrah to stop the cult.

While Johnny Cage was excluded from &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2021), with director Simon McQuoid explaining that the main cast was already established when he had joined the production and feeling that Cage was &quot;a very tricky, complex character&quot; and a &quot;big personality ... that has such a gravitational force around him [that] everything would have started to orbit around him&quot;, a reference to him appears at the end of the movie, when Cole Young (Lewis Tan) departs to scout more champions for Earthrealm, passing by the poster of a Cage movie, hinting at him being recruited in the future. Cage will appear in &quot;Mortal Kombat 2&quot;, portrayed by Karl Urban.

Johnny Cage appears in Malibu Comics&#x27; &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; comic book miniseries &quot;Mortal Kombat: Blood &amp; Thunder&quot; (1994), which adapts the original game, and &quot;Mortal Kombat: Battlewave&quot; (1995), which sees Cage resuming his acting career before he and his personal bodyguard Bo join Jax Briggs in traveling to Outworld to investigate an attack carried out by Goro. He appears in DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Mortal Kombat X: Blood Ties&quot;, which is set before the events of the game.

===Merchandise and promotion===
Cage has been licensed for various action figures produced by Hasbro, Toy Island, and Jazwares. Advanced Graphics released a life-sized Cage cardboard standee in 2011, and Syco Collectibles released a polystone character statuette in 2012.

== Reception ==
Cage has been rated among the top &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters by various gaming media publications, and his Fatality finishing moves over the course of his series appearances have been positively received. Brad Nicholson of &quot;Destructoid&quot; enthused in 2008 that Cage was &quot;easily the best character in a fighting game ever.&quot; However, Shea Serrano of &quot;Grantland&quot; rated Cage as the second-worst of &quot;Mortal Kombat II&#x27;s&quot; characters in 2012, on the basis of his skill being &quot;overtaken almost entirely by his own ego.&quot; In her 2015 review of &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, Maddy Myers of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; questioned what she felt was the implausibility of the &quot;white-as-snow&quot; union of Cage and Sonya.

Critical reception of Cage&#x27;s characterization in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games and alternate media has been mixed. Chris Buffa of GameDaily wrote: &quot;If you can&#x27;t marry Brad Pitt, you can always settle for &quot;Mortal Kombat&#x27;s&quot; Johnny Cage.&quot; &quot;GamesRadar&quot; considered Cage a combination of Jean-Claude Van Damme, Nicolas Cage, and Robert Downey, Jr. Writing for &quot;Complex&quot;, Elton Jones declared that Cage &quot;embodies Hollywood&#x27;s overpaid jerk persona perfectly,&quot; while Hanuman Welch considered Cage an exemplification of overconfidence and self-delusion, as well as a &quot;spokesperson of the obnoxious Ed Hardy crowd.&quot; Mark Walton of &quot;GameSpot&quot; castigated Cage in the 2011 reboot game as sexist and arrogant. In their review of &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; enjoyed the interactions presented between the young and the old Cage as they gave elements that helped to make the narrative more appealing. Fans have praised Cage&#x27;s gameplay, specifically his combos and sunglasses finishes in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;.

Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; praised Linden Ashby&#x27;s performance in the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; film as &quot;a perfect idea of&quot; Cage&#x27;s personality. R. L. Shaffer of &quot;IGN&quot; was critical of Cage&#x27;s &quot;illogical character arc&quot; as a former &quot;Power Rangers&quot; actor in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy&quot; as he felt it was &quot;disconnected&quot; from Cage&#x27;s role in the games, but Carl Lyon of Fearnet opined in his 2013 second-season review that Casper Van Dien&#x27;s portrayal of the character made Cage &quot;the loveable asshole we all know and love.&quot; In the upcoming &quot;Mortal Kombat 2&quot; film, Bradley Russell of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; felt that Karl Urban&#x27;s Johnny &quot;is suitably obnoxious.&quot;

<doc id="733952" wikidata="Q6205414" url="?curid=733952" title="Joan Russow">
<text>Joan Elizabeth Russow (born November 1, 1938) is a Canadian peace activist and former national leader of the Green Party of Canada from 1997 to 2001. She is also a co-founder of the Ecological Rights Association and the Global Compliance Research Project.

==Early career==
Russow received her BA in art history and a master&#x27;s degree in education from the University of British Columbia. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Victoria in interdisciplinary studies.

Russow first gained attention in the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Prayer Case&quot; which resulted in the banning of school prayer in public schools in British Columbia in 1989.

In collaboration with the professors in the Law faculty of the University of Toronto, Russow was the litigant in the Charter challenge of the first-past-the-post electoral system in Canada.

==The Green Party and politics==
Russow joined the Green Party in 1993 and became leader in 1997. She ran for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada in three federal elections; in Victoria in 1997 and 2000, and in Okanagan—Coquihalla in a by-election in September 2000. She lost all three elections.

Russow was the partner of David Scott White, the former chair of the Green Party of British Columbia, until his death in 2006. White was the manager of Russow&#x27;s election campaign as leader of the federal Green party.

Under Russow&#x27;s leadership the party developed policies promoting social justice, human rights, and peace, as well as the more traditional concerns with environment.

In the 2001 Quebec City protest against the Free Trade Area of the Americas, Russow was detained for taking a photograph of the jail that was being emptied to incarcerate the FTAA protesters. Russow promoted the Green Party as a leader in the anti-globalization movement, in particular the anti-corporatist and pro-peace movement.

Russow and White left the Green Party in 2001, partly due to the German Green party&#x27;s support of the NATO attack on Serbia. Russow and White both joined the NDP in 2003 and White continued his work as an activist until his death, most recently researching and writing against Canada&#x27;s military role in Afghanistan.

In 2005, Russow criticized the Green Party under Jim Harris for moving away from some of its original left-wing principles.

==Legal activism==
Russow is a co-founder of the Ecological Rights Association and the Global Compliance Research Project. In September 2007, she collaborated on a declaration related to climate change. This declaration called upon the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to calculate the contribution of militarism to greenhouse gas emissions.

In March 2008, at the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, she collaborated on a paper related to the delegitimization of war; this paper was officially sanctioned for distribution to state delegations at the UN. 
On August 4, 2008, in Victoria she presented a representative of Stephen Harper with a paper entitled &quot;95 Articles of Condemnation of the Harper Government&quot;.

==International and domestic peace activism==
Russow developed a &quot;Common Security Index&quot; which was submitted to the Senate Committee on the Anti-Terrorism Act on October 17, 2005. To further common security, the member states of the United Nations have made commitments to work toward the following goals:

* to enable socially equitable and environmentally sound employment, and ensure the right to development and social justice;
* to promote and fully guarantee respect for human rights including labour rights, civil and political rights, social and cultural rights: the right to food, the right to housing, the right to safe drinking water and sewage, the right to education and right to a universally accessible not for profit health care system;
* to ensure the preservation and protection of the environment, the respect for the inherent worth of nature beyond human purpose, the reduction of the ecological footprint and to move away from the current model of unsustainable and overconsumptive development;
* to achieve a state of peace and disarmament through reallocation of military expenses; and
* to create a global structure that respects the rule of law and the International Court of Justice.

Recently Russow has been speaking out about the increased militarism in Canada, focusing on the increased military budget; the increased belligerence in the military invasion and occupation of Afghanistan; the increased military exercises involving US nuclear-powered vessels and nuclear arms capable vessels and aircraft and using live ammunition; the increased military recruitment ads on television and bus shelters, in &quot;Navy days&quot; with booths, and in schools; the increased mining and production of uranium, including the contribution to US and NATO weapon systems; and the increased military flights overhead and participation in community events and parades.

In March 2007, Russow lobbied state delegations in the UN General Assembly to invoke Article 22 of the Charter of the United Nations to set up an international tribunal to try the Bush administration. On March 8, 2007, the petition, in the six official languages, was submitted to the office of the President of the UN General Assembly.

In 2008, Russow was involved in a film project related to Co-operatives titled &quot;Counterpoint to Corporatism&quot;.

For the 2009 Conference on Climate change in Copenhagen, she submitted a document co-written with Rickard Levicki of England to the state negotiators.

<text>The Origins Awards are American awards for outstanding work in the gaming industry. They are presented by the Game Manufacturers Association (GAMA) at the Origins Game Fair on an annual basis for games released in the preceding year. For example, the 1979 awards were given at the 1980 game fair. Award categories include board games, card games, tabletop role-playing games, strategy games, and game accessories. 

== History ==

History of Categories

The Origins Awards were initially presented at the Origins Game Fair in five categories: &quot;Best Professional Game&quot;, &quot;Best Amateur Game&quot;, &quot;Best Professional Magazine&quot;, &quot;Best Amateur Magazine&quot; and &quot;Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame&quot;. Since the first ceremony, the game categories have widened to include Board games (Traditional, Historical and Abstract), Card games (Traditional and Trading), Miniature wargaming (Historical, Science Fiction and Fantasy), Role-playing games and play-by-mail games. There are additional categories for Graphic Design, for game expansions and accessories, and for game-related fiction. During the 1980s and 1990s, awards were also given to Computer games. Starting in 2003, the Origins Awards began a new category called the Vanguard Award, which honored highly innovative games.

Charles S. Roberts Awards

Originally, the &quot;Charles S. Roberts Awards&quot; and the Origins Awards were one and the same. Starting with the 1987 awards, the Charles S. Roberts were given separately, and they moved away from Origins entirely in 2000, leaving the Origins Awards as a completely separate system. In 1978, the awards also hosted the 1977 &quot;H. G. Wells awards&quot; for role-playing games and miniature wargaming.

<text>Reise, Reise (; a German &quot;military wake-up call&quot;, literally &quot;(a)rise, (a)rise&quot;) is the fourth studio album by Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein. It was released on 27 September 2004 through Universal Music in Germany and followed shortly by its release across Europe. It was later released in North America through Republic Records on 16 November 2004. Recorded at El Cortijo Studios in Málaga, Spain, the album was produced by the band themselves along with Swedish record producer Jacob Hellner.

The album charted in the top ten in several European charts and was a number one hit in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Iceland, Finland, Estonia and Mexico. As of February 2006, the album has shipped 1.5 million copies globally. Four singles were released from the album: &quot;Mein Teil&quot;, &quot;Amerika&quot;, &quot;Ohne dich&quot;, and &quot;Keine Lust&quot;. The follow-up album, &quot;Rosenrot&quot;, contains six outtakes from &quot;Reise, Reise&quot; and some new tracks. It was originally intended to be titled &quot;Reise, Reise, Vol. II&quot; and uses the Arctic-themed artwork from the Japanese release of &quot;Reise, Reise&quot;.

==Recording==
Recording for the album began in November 2003 in the El Cortijo Studio in Spain, being produced by Jacob Hellner and Rammstein. The band recorded several songs during the sessions for the &quot;Reise, Reise&quot; album, which the band initially planned as a double album but later scrapped the idea. 7 songs were omitted from the album&#x27;s final track listing and were later released on their follow-up album &quot;Rosenrot&quot;. A statement from the band&#x27;s management regarding the upcoming collection reads as follows:

The record company stated: 

The mixing sessions for the album took place in April and May 2004 at Toytown Studio in Stockholm, Sweden. A look behind the scenes of the albums recording can be found on the 2006 live compilation &quot;Völkerball&quot;.

==Composition==
===Themes===
The album is based on the crash of Japan Air Lines Flight 123 on the evening of 12 August 1985. Twelve minutes into its flight, the Boeing 747 suffered an explosive decompression due to failure of its rear pressure bulkhead, caused by a faulty repair 7 years earlier. The explosion tore off most of the aircraft&#x27;s vertical stabilizer and ruptured all four of the hydraulic systems, causing the loss of all flight control surfaces and rendering the aircraft uncontrollable. The pilots fought to keep the aircraft aloft for nearly 32 minutes, but eventually became trapped in the towering mountain ranges surrounding Mount Fuji and crashed, killing 520 out of the 524 passengers and crew on board. It remains the deadliest single-aircraft disaster in history. Some pressings of the album contain a recording of the last 30 seconds of the flight as an easter egg hidden in the pregap.

===Songs and lyrics===
The album &quot;revels in the type of paradoxical, multi-faceted existentialism which comes second nature to Germans but is persistently untranslatable to Americans&quot; and it opens with the track &quot;Reise, Reise&quot; which means &quot;journey, journey&quot; or &quot;rise, rise&quot;, and &quot;we are immediately put on notice that this particular journey will be a grim and harrowing one, leavened by German existentialism in the grand tradition of Mann and Goethe.&quot; The song&#x27;s lyrics deal with the life of sailors and was intended as a reference to Herman Melville&#x27;s novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;. The references to Goethe come in &quot;Dalai Lama&quot;, a modern version of Goethe&#x27;s poem &quot;Der Erlkönig&quot;, set in an aeroplane rather than on a horse; the title is claimed to be a reference to the 14th Dalai Lama&#x27;s fear of flying, while a more sound point of view is a reference to the serfdom in Tibet.

The song &quot;Amerika&quot; deals with the worldwide political and cultural imperialism of the United States of America. The song&#x27;s two verses are sung in German with a chorus in English: &quot;We&#x27;re all living in Amerika, Amerika ist wunderbar, We&#x27;re all living in Amerika, Amerika, Amerika.&quot; The band views it as a satirical commentary on &quot;Americanization&quot;, and it features mentions of Coca-Cola, Mickey Mouse, and Santa Claus.

The song &quot;Mein Teil&quot; is about Armin Meiwes, a man who achieved international notoriety for killing and eating a voluntary victim whom he had found via the Internet. After Meiwes and the victim jointly attempted to eat the victim&#x27;s severed penis, Meiwes killed his victim and proceeded to eat a large amount of his flesh. Because of his acts, Meiwes is also known as the &quot;Rotenburg Cannibal&quot; or &quot;Der Metzgermeister&quot; (The Master Butcher). According to Rammstein&#x27;s bassist Oliver Riedel, the song came about after &quot;one of our members brought a newspaper to rehearsal and it had a story about the cannibal guy in it. We were fascinated, shocked and amused at the same time.&quot; Vocalist Till Lindemann stated, &quot;It&#x27;s so sick that it becomes fascinating and there just has to be a song about it&quot;. &quot;Mein Teil&quot; attracted controversy in Germany; the media dubbed it the &quot;Kannibalensong&quot; (cannibal song), which helped to boost it to second place in the German music charts after its release in early August 2004. Remixes of the song were done by Arthur Baker and the Pet Shop Boys. At the beginning of the song in the video, the phrase &quot;Suche gut gebauten Achtzehn- bis Dreißigjährigen zum Schlachten – Der Metzgermeister&quot; (&quot;Looking for a well built 18 to 30-year-old to be slaughtered – The Master Butcher&quot;) is spoken, voiced by Ollie, although the album version of the song does not have this beginning. The quote is taken from an online post by Armin Meiwes.

&quot;Ohne dich&quot; (&quot;Without You&quot;) is a power ballad. It is seen as expressing mourning over the loss of a loved person. It follows a slow, even romantic ballad style. The central motif is &quot;Without you, I cannot be..., With you, I am alone also...&quot; The song was also remixed by Slovenian avant-garde band Laibach.

&quot;Los&quot; is a German suffix meaning &quot;-less&quot; (as in &quot;meaningless&quot;), but it is also an adjective meaning &quot;off&quot; or &quot;loose&quot;, and when used as a command it means &quot;go!&quot;. The track itself is reminiscent of Depeche Mode&#x27;s early work, with repetitive acoustic guitar and a stripped-down, insistent beat. The album ends with the track &quot;Amour&quot;, one of the most intimate love songs written by the band. In the context of a disc filled with the imagery of &quot;great black gaps in the fabric of human rationality&quot;, Rammstein somehow manage to make &quot;honest and sincere romance seem just slightly alien, and tinted with enough melancholy to satisfy the heartiest emo-kid.&quot; There&#x27;s also a guitar solo towards the end, another uncharacteristic gesture in the album.

==Release and artwork==
On the U.S. release, the &quot;easter egg&quot; fragment is placed at the beginning of &quot;Reise, Reise&quot; in normal playback. The 2005 pressing does not contain the easter egg, but the original 2004 pressing does. On the European version the easter egg is in negative time, to access it, you must rewind the CD past the beginning of &quot;Reise, Reise&quot;. The American iTunes version of &quot;Reise, Reise&quot; also contains the easter egg. On 21 April 2005, Rammstein released a special Japanese version of &quot;Reise, Reise&quot;, with different cover art, which was later used as the &quot;Rosenrot&quot; cover art, though the Rammstein logo on the ship was altered into the text &quot;Rosenrot&quot;. The booklet also features the same art as &quot;Rosenrot&quot;, but with the songs from &quot;Reise, Reise&quot;. The easter egg is not present in negative time as it is on the European version. It features two bonus tracks: &quot;Mein Teil (You Are What You Eat Edit)&quot; and &quot;Amerika (Digital Hardcore Mix)&quot;. The Japanese Limited Edition has a bonus DVD featuring footage from &quot;Lichtspielhaus&quot;. The Japanese Limited Edition was re-issued in 2009 as SHM-CD and DVD edition, featuring the original orange cover art.

The album artwork shows a damaged aeroplane cockpit voice recorder depicted on the front and back covers. Its caption (&quot;Flugrekorder, nicht öffnen&quot;) means &quot;Flight Recorder, Do Not Open&quot;. The inner part of the Digipak edition case shows a picture of the six members in suits wielding suitcases and weapons (like Michael Douglas in &quot;Falling Down&quot;) leaving from a crashed aeroplane. The cover art is an allusion to the song &quot;Dalai Lama&quot;, which deals with an aeroplane accident. It is also suggestive of the overarching &quot;travelling&quot; theme of the album. While past albums have all featured the six band members in various photographic scenarios, &quot;Reise Reise&quot; features a minimal packaging, and there are no photographs featuring the band&#x27;s members.

==Reception==
===Critical===

Upon its release, the album received generally positive reviews from critics. David Jeffries from Allmusic gave the album a rating of three out of five stars, and stated that the album&#x27;s content &quot;is more of the same: the same grit, the same growl, and the same dramatic, orchestra choruses&quot; and that &quot;the lead single, &#x27;Mein Teil&#x27; is no &#x27;Du Hast&#x27; but the damning &#x27;Amerika&#x27; almost equals their breakthrough track.&quot; He also said that there was a bit more ingenuity in the production and a little more focus in the songs but it wasn&#x27;t &quot;enough for the nonfaithful to pick up on.&quot; Jeffries highlighted the track &quot;Stein Um Stein&quot; because it &quot;creeps more than stomps in parts&quot;. He also mentioned that the track &quot;Los&quot; features a bluesy guitar that &quot;adds some quirk to the band&#x27;s stern Teutonic pallette.&quot; He finished his review saying &quot;few bands can industrially grind as convincingly as Rammstein. Same as it ever was, &quot;Reise, Reise&quot; won&#x27;t do much to increase the band&#x27;s fan base, but being a tight, free-of-filler album, it&#x27;ll satisfy the faithful.&quot;
Vaz Malik from the BBC also gave the album a mixed review and said that the band could probably be &quot;a lot bigger&quot; in the United States if they opted to sing in English, but &quot;German sounds a lot more threatening and it&#x27;s done them no harm in their homeland.&quot; He stated that the songs &quot;Morgenstern&quot; and &quot;Stein Um Stein&quot; probably have weak translations but in German they sound mean. He said &quot;that tracks like &#x27;Amerika&#x27; make the admission price worth while. Rammstein say it&#x27;s their most commercial song to date. Well more like this please because it&#x27;s funny but rocks at the same time.&quot;
Tim O&#x27;Neil from &quot;PopMatters&quot; gave the album a favorable review and said: &quot;for those with the patience to look beyond the &quot;Teutonic bluster&quot; and punk insouciance, &quot;Reise Reise&quot; will be a uniquely rewarding experience.&quot;

===Commercial===
The album sold 26,716 copies in the United States in its first week of release in November 2004 to debut at position no. 61 on The Billboard 200 chart. It was in the top ten in several European charts and reached number one in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Iceland, Finland, Estonia and Mexico. As of February 2006, the album has shipped 1.5 million copies globally.

<text>Saint-Constant () is a city in southwestern Quebec, Canada. It is located on the south shore of Montreal in the Roussillon Regional County Municipality of the Montérégie region. The population as of the Canada 2016 Census was 27,359.

==History==

Early settlement took place in 1725 as a result of the opening of the St. Pierre concession. The Côte Saint-Pierre mission (first name of the parish) began in 1750 with the construction of a church and two years later, the parish registers opened. Rang Saint-Pierre was the central concession of the Sault-Saint-Louis seigneurie and extended into the seigneurie of LaSalle. In 1815 Rang Saint-Pierre was nicknamed &quot;Black Cattle Road&quot; because it was the way cattle were transported from New York to Montreal. Centrally located in what was then Laprairie County, the village of Saint-Constant was the only location of voting from 1829 to 1841. Residents of the area witnessed or took part in the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837–1838.

Local administrative structures emerged in Saint-Constant in 1845 with the introduction of the parish municipality and the school board. However, the vast territory of the parish of Saint-Constant was already subdivided for Saint-Rémi (1840), Saint-Édouard (1833), and Saint-Isidore (1833). This trend continued with the establishment of Saint-Michel (1854), Saint-Mathieu (1919) and Sainte-Thérèse-de-Delson (1932). One of the mayors, Solime Cardinal (1815–1897), was the maternal grandfather of Charles-Émile &quot;Charley&quot; Trudeau, a successful French Canadian entrepreneur who became the father of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, 15th Prime Minister of Canada, and grandfather of Justin Trudeau, 23rd and current Prime Minister of Canada.

Saint-Constant was transformed by the construction of the Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. The electrification of the village occurred around 1918 and rural electrification was completed in 1939. The Rue Saint-Pierre was extended from Montées des Bouleaux/Rue Sainte-Catherine, in the direction of Route 132 in 1950. Starting in the 1950s, suburban development occurred in Saint-Constant, allowing it to obtain city status in 1973.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Saint-Constant had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="733964" wikidata="Q899668" url="?curid=733964" title="Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor">
<text>A norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI, NERI) or noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor or adrenergic reuptake inhibitor (ARI), is a type of drug that acts as a reuptake inhibitor for the neurotransmitters norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline) by blocking the action of the norepinephrine transporter (NET). This in turn leads to increased extracellular concentrations of norepinephrine and epinephrine and therefore can increase adrenergic neurotransmission.

== Medical use ==
NRIs are commonly used in the treatment of conditions like ADHD and narcolepsy due to their psychostimulant effects and in obesity due to their appetite suppressant effects. They are also frequently used as antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder, anxiety and panic disorder. Additionally, many addictive substances such as cocaine and methylphenidate possess NRI activity, though NRIs without combined dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI) properties are not significantly rewarding and hence are considered to have negligible potential for addiction. However, norepinephrine has been implicated as acting synergistically with dopamine when actions on the two neurotransmitters are combined (e.g., in the case of NDRIs) to produce rewarding effects in psychostimulant addictive substances.

=== Depression ===
A meta analysis published in BMJ in 2011 concluded that the selective NRI reboxetine is indistinguishable from placebo in the treatment of depression. A second review by the European Medicines Agency concluded that reboxetine was significantly more effective than placebo, and that its risk/benefit ratio was positive. The latter review, also examined the efficacy of reboxetine as a function of baseline depression, and concluded that it was effective in severe depression and panic disorder but did not show effects significantly superior to placebo in mild depression.

A closely related type of drug is a norepinephrine releasing agent (NRA).

<doc id="733968" wikidata="Q1399747" url="?curid=733968" title="Uncanny X-Men">
<text>Uncanny X-Men, originally published as The X-Men, is an American comic book series published by Marvel Comics since 1963, and is the longest-running series in the X-Men comics franchise. It features a team of superheroes called the X-Men, a group of mutants with superhuman abilities led and taught by Professor X.

The title was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, met with a lukewarm reception, and eventually became a reprints-only book in 1970. Interest was rekindled with 1975&#x27;s &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1 and the debut of a new, international team. Initially under the guidance of artist David Cockrum, writer Len Wein, and especially writer Chris Claremont whose 16-year stint began with August 1975&#x27;s &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #94, the series grew in popularity worldwide, eventually spawning a franchise with numerous spin-off &quot;X-books&quot; including &quot;New Mutants&quot;, &quot;X-Factor&quot;, &quot;Excalibur&quot;, &quot;X-Force&quot;, &quot;Generation X&quot;, and other flagship titles like the simply titled &quot;X-Men&quot; (later &quot;New X-Men&quot; and &quot;X-Men Legacy&quot;), &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;, &quot;All-New X-Men&quot;, &quot;Amazing X-Men&quot;, &quot;Extraordinary X-Men&quot; and &quot;X-Men Gold&quot;.

==Publication history==
===1963–1970: Original run===
Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the series launched in September 1963, introducing in its first issue the original five X-Men (Warren Worthington III/Angel, Hank McCoy/Beast, Scott Summers/Cyclops, Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Drake/Iceman, and Jean Grey/Marvel Girl) and their teacher, Charles Xavier/Professor X as well as their nemesis, the supervillain Erik Magnus Lehnsherr/Magneto. Although Lee would deny it, it was noticed by contemporary writer Arnold Drake, that the concept of the series emulated his own earlier series for National Periodical Publications&#x27;s (now DC Comics) &quot;The Doom Patrol&quot;, in many respects. However, National&#x27;s editorial staff did not support Drake&#x27;s concerns.

Initially published bimonthly, it became a monthly with issue #14 (November 1965). Lee&#x27;s run lasted 19 issues, and featured the X-Men battling villains such as Magneto&#x27;s Brotherhood of Mutants (which included the siblings Wanda Maximoff/the Scarlet Witch and Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver); the Sentinels, giant robots programmed to destroy all mutants, and their creator Bolivar Trask; and Cain Marko/the Juggernaut, Xavier&#x27;s stepbrother transformed by a mystical gem and seeking revenge on Xavier.

The series was placed firmly in the Marvel Universe, with guest appearances by Namor MacKenzie/Namor the Sub-Mariner in #6 and the Avengers in #9. The jungle adventure hero Kevin Plunder/Ka-Zar and the Savage Land were introduced in issue #10. Roy Thomas wrote the series from #20–43 (May 1966 – April 1968). Thomas and artist Werner Roth created Sean Cassidy/the Banshee in #28 (Jan. 1967). &quot;The X-Men&quot; #45 (June 1968) featured a crossover with &quot;The Avengers&quot; #53 (June 1968). After brief runs by Gary Friedrich and Arnold Drake – the latter of whom introduced the new X-Men Lorna Dane/Polaris and Alex Summers/Havok, and during which the series adopted a new logo designed by Jim Steranko – Thomas returned to the series with issue #55 and was joined by artist Neal Adams the following issue for an acclaimed run of stories. After a battle with the Hulk in issue #66 (March 1970), the title ceased publishing original material and featured reprints in issues #67–93 (December 1970 – April 1975).

===1970–1975: Other appearances===
Despite the title going into reprints for the next five years between #67–93, the X-Men continued to appear in other Marvel titles throughout this period in a guest-starring capacity or cameo appearance, either as a team or in solo adventures.

The Angel appeared without the X-Men in a three-part story involving the murder of his father at the hands of his uncle, Burt Worthington, a.k.a. the Dazzler, in &quot;Ka-Zar&quot; #2 (Dec. 1970) and #3 (March 1971), and &quot;Marvel Tales&quot; #30 (April 1971).

Iceman made a guest appearance in &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #92 (Jan. 1971), where he battles Spider-Man after mistakenly assuming he abducted Gwen Stacy. Later, after realizing his error, they team up against corrupt politician, Sam Bullitt. Iceman appears alone once again in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #23 (July 1974), where he teams up with the Human Torch to battle the Equinox. Cyclops, Marvel Girl, and Angel also make a brief appearance.

The Beast starred in his own series in &quot;Amazing Adventures &quot;#11–17 (March 1972 – March 1973) after accepting a position with the Brand Corporation, and decides to leave the X-Men for good. The original team appeared briefly in a flashback in #11 (March 1972) and in a present-day cameo appearance in #15 (November 1972). Professor Xavier and Marvel Girl briefly appeared in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; #12 (May 1972), and the Angel helped the Beast defeat the Griffin in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; #15. After his run on that series ended, the Beast battled against the Hulk alone in &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; #161 (March 1973), concluding a storyline which began in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot;.

Havok and Polaris, as recounted in a flashback in &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; #150 (April 1972), leave the X-Men after a bitter quarrel with Iceman and move to New Mexico. In a present-day appearance in the same issue, they encounter and battle the Hulk, who mistakes Polaris for his former lover Jarella, and a biker gang.

As a team, the X-Men assisted Spider-Man in capturing Michael Morbius in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #4 (Sept. 1972), written by Gerry Conway, after one of Xavier&#x27;s colleagues is abducted by the vampire. In &quot;Adventure into Fear&quot; #20 (Feb. 1974), it is recounted in a flashback how Morbius escaped from the X-Men&#x27;s mansion. Professor Xavier and Cyclops appeared in a brief cameo.

They appeared in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #110–111 (April–May 1973), written by Steve Englehart, where Professor Xavier and the X-Men are abducted by Magneto after an ambush at Xavier&#x27;s mansion, and later rescued by the Avengers, Daredevil, and the Black Widow. Soon after, members of the X-Men, including Iceman, Angel, Beast, Havok and Polaris, and members of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants are secretly being abducted by a group of hooded figures known as the Secret Empire. At this point, only Professor Xavier, Cyclops and Marvel Girl remain active, and, after a brief cameo at the end of &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; #172 (Feb. 1974), where they discover an unconscious Juggernaut after a battle with the Hulk, seek out the help of Captain America and the Falcon. This led to the first &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, which ran in &quot;Captain America&quot; #172–175 (April–July 1974), also written by Steve Englehart.

Professor Xavier made a few brief appearances of his own without the X-Men during this time. In &quot;The Avengers&quot; #88 (May 1971), written by Roy Thomas and Harlan Ellison, he made a cameo appearance assisting Reed Richards and General Thunderbolt Ross in containing the Hulk, and later appeared briefly onscreen in &quot;Shanna the She-Devil&quot; #5 (Aug. 1973) to warn Shanna of an unknown mutant threat, Nekra. In &quot;The Defenders&quot; #15–16 (Sept–Oct. 1974), written by Len Wein, Xavier teamed up with the Defenders to battle against Magneto and his reformed Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. It was in this battle that Magneto and the Brotherhood were reduced to infancy by Alpha, the Ultimate Mutant. Xavier made one final solo appearance during this period in &quot;Giant-Size Fantastic Four&quot; #4 (Feb. 1975), where he assisted the Fantastic Four in subduing Jamie Madrox, the Multiple Man.

===1975–1991: Chris Claremont era===

&quot;X-Men&quot; was relaunched in May 1975 with &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1, by Len Wein and Dave Cockrum. The title featured a new, international team consisting of Scott Summers (Cyclops) of the United States, Ireland&#x27;s Sean Cassidy (Banshee), the Japanese mutant Shiro Yoshida (Sunfire), and James &quot;Logan&quot; Howlett (Wolverine) from Canada, along with new characters Ororo Munroe (Storm) out of Kenya, the German Kurt Wagner (Nightcrawler), Piotr &quot;Peter&quot; Rasputin (Colossus) from Russia in The Soviet Union, and John Proudstar (Thunderbird), a Native American. The original plan was to continue &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; as a quarterly, but instead original stories were printed in the book, again initially bimonthly. 
Chris Claremont&#x27;s first issue as writer, #94, featured all the original X-Men leaving the team with the exception of Cyclops. Sunfire also left, having agreed to assist the X-Men on one successful mission only. Thunderbird was killed in #95. Moira MacTaggert, a human ally of the X-Men, and later to be established as a former fiancé of Xavier, debuted in #96. Marvel Girl became Phoenix in issue #101. This was followed by the first Shi&#x27;ar space opera story. Cockrum was replaced as penciller by John Byrne as of #108. Byrne became co-plotter, and during his run the series became a monthly title again.

The series title was changed to &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; with issue #114 (October 1978).

For the remainder of the decade, the X-Men fought enemies such as Stephen Lang and his Sentinels, Magneto, Banshee&#x27;s cousin Black Tom Cassidy and Cain Marko/the Juggernaut, the Shi&#x27;ar Erik the Red and the Imperial Guard, Arcade, Wolverine&#x27;s former colleagues, the Canadian superhero team Alpha Flight, and MacTaggert&#x27;s son Proteus. In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Claremont and Byrne&#x27;s run on &quot;The X-Men&quot; second on its list of the &quot;Top 10 1970s Marvels&quot;.

The &quot;Dark Phoenix Saga&quot; in 1980 led to a change in the line-up of the team, with the death of Phoenix (Jean Grey), and Cyclops leaving the team to mourn her. Comics writers and historians Roy Thomas and Peter Sanderson observed that &quot;&#x27;The Dark Phoenix Saga&#x27; is to Claremont and Byrne what &#x27;the Galactus Trilogy&#x27; is to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. It is a landmark in Marvel history, showcasing its creators&#x27; work at the height of their abilities.&quot; The storyline also saw the introduction of recurring antagonists the Hellfire Club, and its Inner Circle consisting of Sebastian Shaw, Emma Frost, Harry Leland, Donald Pierce, along with Mastermind, previously a member of Magneto&#x27;s Brotherhood. Teenage mutant Katherine Anne &quot;Kitty&quot; Pryde/Shadowcat was introduced in #129 (Jan. 1980) and joined the X-Men in #139. Alison Blaire/the Dazzler, a disco-singing, roller-skating mutant, was introduced in #130 (Feb. 1980), but did not join the team, instead having a solo title.

A new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, led by Mystique, was introduced in the &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; storyline (#141–142, Jan–Feb 1981) in which a time-travelling Katherine Anne &quot;Kitty&quot; Pryde/Shadowcat tried to avert a dystopian future caused by the Brotherhood assassinating Presidential candidate Senator Robert Kelly. Byrne plotted the story wanting to depict the Sentinels as a genuine threat to the existence of the mutant race. He then left the series after #143, being replaced by a returning Cockrum, who in turn was succeeded by Paul Smith and John Romita Jr.

By the mid-1980s, &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; had become one of the best-selling American comic books, turning many of the writers and illustrators into industry stars and leading to numerous spin-offs and miniseries.

Erik Magnus Lehnsherr/Magneto was gradually revealed to be more complex: #150 established that he was a survivor of the Holocaust, and in #161 it is shown that Erik Magnus Lehnsherr/Magneto and Professor Charles Xavier had known each other before Xavier had founded the X-Men. Anna Marie LeBeau/Rogue, a member of Raven Darkholme/Mystique&#x27;s Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, defected to the X-Men in #171 (July 1983). Raven Darkholme/Mystique&#x27;s Brotherhood of Evil Mutants changed sides and became the government-backed Freedom Force in #199. Their first action was to capture Erik Magnus Lehnsherr/Magneto, who had begun associating with the X-Men during the &quot;Secret Wars II&quot; crossover. Erik Magnus Lehnsherr/Magneto surrenders himself, but escapes after his trial is abandoned, he takes over the headmastership of the school after Xavier leaves for space in #200 (Dec. 1985).

The Morlocks, a group of disfigured mutants living underneath New York City, were introduced in #169 (May 1983). Storm became their leader in #170. She was de-powered accidentally by government forces aiming for Anna Marie LeBeau/Rogue, and met Forge, a mutant with the power of invention. After Storm left the team temporarily to return to her native Africa, Nightcrawler became field leader.

The character Rachel Summers from the future dystopia presented in &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; had been shown to arrive in the present day in &quot;New Mutants&quot; #18, and then made appearances in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; from #184 on and was revealed to be Cyclops&#x27; daughter.

Claremont attempted to write Scott Summers/Cyclops out of the series, by having him marry Madelyne Pryor in #175 (Nov. 1983); she gave birth to his son in #201 (Jan. 1986). The &quot;X-Factor&quot; series was launched two months later and featured the original five X-Men. This meant the resurrection of Jean Grey (performed by retcon, the character appearing from #101 having never really been her), and having Scott Summers/Cyclops abandon his wife and child. Claremont strongly objected to the latter, and was hostile towards the title until Louise Simonson became writer.

Artist Arthur Adams began a long association with the team by drawing &quot;The Uncanny X-Men Annual&quot; #9 (1985) and would serve as the artist on several of the &quot;Annuals&quot; in the next few years.

The end of 1986 saw the first crossover between X-Men titles, the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot;, which saw a large number of Morlocks killed by the Marauders, acting under orders from the mysterious Nathaniel Essex/Mister Sinister The late 1980s saw several other crossovers: 1988&#x27;s &quot;Fall of the Mutants&quot; and 1989&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, which resolved the issue of Madelyne Pryor by revealing her to have been a clone of Jean Grey created by Sinister. The cast was shaken up, with the addition of Psylocke, the Dazzler, Longshot and Havok in early 1987, as well as the first appearances of NPR-TV reporter Manoli Wetherell in #226 (1988), new teenage mutant Jubilation Lee/Jubilee in #244 (1989), and Remy LeBeau/Gambit in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #266 (1990). The X-Men left their traditional residence in Westchester County, New York, and lived variously on Alcatraz, Muir Island and in the Australian outback. The &quot;X-Tinction Agenda&quot; crossover, in which the X-Men, &quot;X-Factor&quot; and the &quot;New Mutants&quot; fight against the government of Genosha for mutant rights, was published in the fall of 1990.

The title became twice-monthly from 1988 to 1990 every summer, and helped to launch the careers of artists Marc Silvestri and Jim Lee. In 1991 another &quot;X-Men&quot; title was launched, titled simply &quot;X-Men&quot;; both titles were now published monthly. Claremont wrote the first three issue of this series, in which the X-Factor and X-Men teams reunited with Professor Xavier at the school. Claremont left Marvel after disputes with Bob Harras and artist Jim Lee (of &quot;X-Men&quot;). Claremont&#x27;s final issue of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; was #279, during the &quot;Muir Island Saga&quot;, which is set before those events.

===1991–2011: Post-Claremont era===

After Claremont&#x27;s run, the X-Men were divided into two color-coded squads, with a Blue team headlining the adjectiveless &quot;X-Men&quot; title, while the Gold team, consisting of Warren Worthington III/Archangel, Piotr &quot;Peter&quot; Rasputin/Colossus, Jean Grey, Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Drake/the Iceman and Ororo Munroe/Storm, appeared in &quot;Uncanny&quot;. This roster was later joined by Lucas Bishop, another refugee from the future. After Claremont&#x27;s departure, Jim Lee continued as plotter, while John Byrne scripted from #281–286. Byrne was replaced as scripter from #287 by Scott Lobdell, who was fully credited as writer from #289. The &quot;X-Cutioner&#x27;s Song&quot; crossover was released in the fall of 1992 and resulted in the outbreak of the Legacy virus, a mutant-specific plague which continued as a story element in X-Men comics until 2001.

Crossovers continued through the 1990s. The &quot;Fatal Attractions&quot; crossover of 1993 saw the X-Men battle Magneto again, and the &quot;Phalanx Covenant&quot; story of 1994 focused mostly on the techno-organic Phalanx. &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; briefly ceased publication during the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; storyline in 1995, which dealt with an alternative present created by a time-travelling assassin killing Xavier; it was replaced by &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;. Lobdell was writing &quot;X-Men&quot; as well from 1995.

Lobdell was replaced by Steven T. Seagle with issue #350 (Dec. 1997). He was replaced in turn with Alan Davis, as plotter, from issue #366 (Mar. 1999) to #380. Davis&#x27;s run included &quot;&quot; crossover from #370–375, in which Apocalypse sought the only 12 mutants, which also ran in his &quot;X-Men&quot; title, again being treated as a biweekly publication. As part of the Revolution relaunch, Chris Claremont made a brief return from #381 (June 2000) to #389, at which point he transferred to the new &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; title, as Grant Morrison took over &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) and that became the flagship X-Men title. From 2001, Lobdell made a short return, and then Joe Casey and Chuck Austen wrote runs into 2004. The title became bimonthly from 2003 to 2004.

The &quot;X-Men: Reload&quot; reshuffle of titles in 2004 led to Claremont returning to &quot;Uncanny&quot; with issue #444. The stories addressed the new status quo established by Morrison. Claremont remained until #473. His final story was &quot;End of the Greys&quot; in 2006, as part of the &quot;Decimation&quot; storyline, where the vast majority of mutants had lost their powers. He was replaced by Ed Brubaker, who wrote a 12-part epic space opera story &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire&quot;, as a follow-up to his miniseries &quot;X-Men: Deadly Genesis&quot;. After this, the title led into the &quot;Messiah Complex&quot; crossover event, dealing with the first mutant birth since the Decimation.

Matt Fraction became co-author from #500, and sole author from #504. The entire X-Men team relocated to San Francisco – first to the city, and then, after the &quot;Utopia&quot; crossover with &quot;Dark Avengers&quot;, to an island named Utopia in San Francisco Bay. The &quot;Nation X&quot; storyline focused on the return of the re-powered Magneto, and him coming to Utopia. The &quot;Second Coming&quot; crossover saw the return of Hope Summers, the baby from the &quot;Messiah Complex&quot; arc, to the present day, as a young adult; and the emergence of the &quot;Five Lights&quot;, the first new mutants to have arisen (apart from Hope) since the Decimation. Nightcrawler was killed during this storyline and the Beast left in protest after his discovery of Cyclops&#x27; secret death squad X-Force.

Kieron Gillen took over co-authorship of the series with #531, and became sole writer from #534.1.

===2012: Volume 2===
The original series ended with #544 and relaunched as a new volume after the events of the &quot;X-Men: Schism&quot; miniseries, wherein half the X-Men, led by Wolverine, returned to New York, to found a new school. The new volume featured the Extinction Team, containing members of the X-Men whom Cyclops had retained to deal with potential threats to the mutant race&#x27;s survival. Gillen&#x27;s run led into, and crossed over with, the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline and finished with issue #20 in October 2012. The volume ended with Cyclops, who had become increasingly hardline during Gillen&#x27;s run, in prison for his actions during that storyline. Gillen wrote a five-part epilogue, &quot;AvX: Consequences&quot;.

===2013–2015: Volume 3===

As part of Marvel NOW!, a new volume of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; was launched in February 2013 with an April 2013 cover date, written by Brian Michael Bendis, who is also writing another X-Men title, &quot;All-New X-Men&quot;, and drawn by Chris Bachalo. It features Cyclops and remnants of his Extinction Team recruiting new mutants to help them prepare for what Cyclops believes to be an inevitable revolution, coinciding events of the first &quot;All-New X-Men&quot; story arc. This volume saw Cyclops leading his team to an abandoned Weapon X facility to train new recruits and prepare for impending war against the humans, who see Cyclops as a terrorist&#x27;s due to his actions in &quot;Avengers Vs. X-Men&quot;. Eventually, Kitty Pryde and the time-displaced X-Men join his cause after facing a team of X-Men from a dystopian future. It lasted 36 issues, with the final issue reverting to the legacy numbering of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #600.

=== 2016–2017: Volume 4 ===

As part of All-New, All-Different Marvel, &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; was relaunched, written by Cullen Bunn with art by Greg Land. The relaunched &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; team features Magneto leading Psylocke, the Archangel, M, Mystique, Fantomex and Sabretooth, while a different team led by Storm will be called the Extraordinary X-Men. Cyclops&#x27;s fate after Battleworld is shown to us in the &quot;Death of X&quot; miniseries (Cyclops was exposed to the Terrigen Mist and died from M-Pox).

The tagline for the relaunched series is &quot;Bigger threats require more threatening X-Men&quot;, and is considered to be a continuation of Bunn&#x27;s previous work on the &quot;Magneto&quot; solo series. The series will deal with threats that arise as a result of a new, more dangerous world post-&quot;Secret Wars&quot;. Summing up the team, Bunn states &quot;They&#x27;re upholding Xavier&#x27;s dream, but they have no right to do so.&quot;

=== 2019: Volume 5 ===
Announced in August 2018, &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; (vol. 5) debuted November 14, 2018, with the weekly 10-part &quot;X-Men: Disassembled&quot; arc and follows on from the events of the &quot;Extermination&quot; miniseries. This incarnation of the team features Lucas Bishop, Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler, Jean Grey, Ororo Munroe/Storm, Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Braddock/Psylocke, Jean-Paul Beaubier/Northstar, Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Drake/the Iceman, Hank McCoy/the Beast, Laura Kinney/X-23, Lorna Dane/Polaris, Jubilation Lee/Jubilee, Katherine Anne &quot;Kitty&quot; Pryde/Shadowcat and Sam Guthrie/Cannonball as well as trainee X-Men Hisako Ichiki/Armor, Victor Borkowski/Anole, Megan Gwynn/Pixie, Idie Okonkwo/Oya, Robert Herman/the Glob, Santo Vaccarro/Rockslide. Following the 10th issue, the series began focusing on a new team of X-Men featuring Scott Summers/Cyclops, James &quot;Logan&quot; Howlett/Wolverine, Alex Summers/Havok, Jamie Madrox/the Multiple Man, Rahne Sinclair/Wolfsbane, Illyana Rasputin/Magik, Danielle Moonstar/Mirage, Xi&#x27;an Coy Minh/Karma.

After this volume, all X-Men titles were cancelled and two intertwining six-issue miniseries written by Jonathan Hickman, called &quot;House of X&quot; and &quot;Powers of X&quot;, began a weekly run in July 2019 and concluded on October of the same year. Shortly after those were completed, the X-Men series relaunched with &quot;X-Men&quot; #1, accompanied by the other related teams&#x27; regular series, such as &quot;Marauders&quot;, &quot;X-Force&quot;, &quot;Excalibur&quot;, &quot;New Mutants&quot;, &quot;X-Corp&quot;, &quot;Wolverine&quot;, &quot;X-Men: Giant Size&quot;, and reviving 1987&#x27;s &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;; all part of the 2019 story arc &quot;Dawn of X&quot;, which searches to unite all mutantdom and settle down as a whole species.

===2024-present: Volume 6===

It was announced that a new &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; series would return. The first issue is scheduled to be released on August 7, 2024, cover-dated October 2024, and will be written by Gail Simone and penciled by David Marquez. The members of this team will be: Wolverine, Gambit, Jubilee, Rogue, and Nightcrawler.

;Notes:
This is an article about the comic book, and thus the publication history, not the in-continuity history. As such, the above reflects the team roster for the book at time of publication. Similarly, this article only reflects the team roster for the X-Men team whose home is this publication.

Professor X is the Headmaster of Xavier&#x27;s School for Gifted Youngsters and mentor to the X-Men, but he is rarely (if ever) a member of the X-Men team. In his role as mentor, he has typically been present in the book, but he has notable absences, including issues #43–64 (dead, later retconned as preparing for the Z&#x27;Nox), #200–273 (with Lilandra Neramani in Shi&#x27;ar space; replaced as Headmaster by Magneto during most of this absence), #340–351 (in government custody after the Onslaught crisis), #379–386 (educating Cadre K in space), and #495–513 (rebuilding his mind in &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot;).

Jean Grey was replaced by the Phoenix Force from issues #101–137. This was a retcon that was only revealed years later.

At many times, the team roster has been the same as that appearing in &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) and during two periods, the two books have even been treated by their writer as a single bi-weekly title (issues #289–350 by Scott Lobdell and issues #366–380 by Alan Davis).

During issues #370–372, Wolverine was replaced by a Skrull infiltrator, leading to &quot;The Shattering&quot;/&quot;The Twelve&quot; storylines, and the &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) limited series.

After moving to San Francisco, many other mutants continually appear as background characters or allies, but apart from during crossovers they are rarely considered part of the team roster.

After the series was relaunched as &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #1, it featured Cyclops&#x27;s &quot;Extinction Team&quot;, composed of himself, Emma Frost, Namor, Magneto, Storm, Hope Summers, Colossus, Danger and Magik; Psylocke was briefly a member of this team while Emma was injured.

==Title==
Until 2011, &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; remained Marvel Comics&#x27; only Silver Age title to retain its consecutive issue numbering since its conception, even during the early 1970s reprint hiatus. &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; and other legacy titles have all, at one time or another, restarted their numbering at #1, though all later returned to their original numbering. The final issue to be published under the original numbering was #544, published in October 2011 with a December 2011 cover date, which was followed by a new #1 the following month. In 2015, Marvel released &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #600, following Vol. 3 #35, as a conclusion to the Brian Michael Bendis&#x27; run on both &quot;All New X-Men&quot; and Vol. 3.

From issue #1-93 the indicia title was The X-Men. After the relaunch with issue #94, and up to #138, the article &quot;The&quot; was dropped from the indicia title, making it X-Men, but the article was added back in issues #139–141.

The title The Uncanny X-Men was first used in the issue #95 title block following the &quot;Stan Lee Presents:&quot; tagline, though the title did not appear on the covers or indicia titles yet; covers begin displaying this title in #114. Beginning with issue #142 and up to #407, the indicia title was finally changed to &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot;. Issue #408 was the first to use the indicia title Uncanny X-Men.

A separate series, titled simply &quot;X-Men&quot;, launched with an October 1991 cover date.

<text>Robert Edmond Grant MD FRCPEd FRS FRSE FZS FGS (11 November 1793 – 23 August 1874) was a British anatomist and zoologist.

==Life==
Grant was born at Argyll Square in Edinburgh (demolished to create Chambers Street), the son of Alexander Grant WS, and his wife, Jane Edmond. He was educated at the High School in Edinburgh then studied Medicine at Edinburgh University. Having obtained his MD at Edinburgh in 1814, Grant gave up medical practice in favour of marine biology and the zoology of invertebrates, living on a legacy from his father. As a materialist and freethinker, and politically radical, he was open to ideas in biology that were considered subversive in the climate of opinion prevailing in Britain after the Napoleonic Wars. He cited Erasmus Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Zoönomia&quot; in his doctoral dissertation, a work which introduced the idea of evolution in poetical form.

In 1824 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Dr John Barclay.

He became one of the foremost naturalists of the early 19th century at Edinburgh and subsequently the first Professor of Comparative Anatomy at University College London. He is noted for his influence on the young Charles Darwin and his espousal of Geoffroy&#x27;s ideas on evolution.

Grant held the UCL chair of comparative anatomy for life (1827–1874); he was elected FRS in 1836; he became Fullerian Professor of Physiology at the Royal Institution 1837–8, and in 1847 Dean of the UCL Medical Faculty. In 1853 he became Swiney lecturer in geology to the British Museum.

==Career==

===Edinburgh and travel===
Grant travelled widely, visiting universities in France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland. He came into contact with the French zoologist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire who promulgated a view on evolution similar to that of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck&#x27;s.

Grant studied marine life around the Firth of Forth, collecting specimens around the shores near a house he took at Prestonpans as well as from fishing boats, and becoming an expert on the biology of sponges and sea-slugs. He considered that the same laws of life affected all organisms, from &quot;monad&quot; to man (in this context &quot;monad&quot; means a hypothetical primitive living organism or unit of organic life). Following Geoffroy, Grant arranged life into a chain, or an escalator, which was kept moving upwards by the appearance of spontaneously emerging &quot;monads&quot; at its base.

In 1824 Grant gave lectures on invertebrates, covering their comparative anatomy; these were in place of John Barclay. He was also elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

===Darwin as disciple===
Grant was a stalwart of the Plinian Society for student naturalists, which Charles Darwin joined in the autumn of 1826 on starting his second year of medical studies at Edinburgh University. Darwin became Grant&#x27;s keenest student and assisted him with collecting specimens.

During that winter and spring Grant published twenty papers in Edinburgh journals, mostly on sponges, eggs and larvae, which won him an international reputation, with the papers being translated into French. Grant took Darwin as a guest to the Wernerian society which was held in Robert Jameson&#x27;s room, with membership restricted to MDs; there Darwin saw a demonstration by John James Audubon. On 24 March 1827 Grant announced to the society that black spores often found in oyster shells were the eggs of a skate leech, and published a paper on this discovery. This discovery was in fact Darwin&#x27;s and Darwin lost interest in Grant as a mentor after this event. Darwin himself made a presentation on 27 March announcing this and his observations on sea-slug larvae to the Plinian Society.

Darwin contributed to Grant&#x27;s investigations into the &#x27;unity of plan&#x27; of animals which culminated with Grant&#x27;s announcement to the Wernerian Society that he had identified the pancreas in molluscs, demonstrated with a pinned-out sea-slug. This showed a homology between these simple creatures and mammals, tying them into his controversial chain of life.

===University College London===
Grant then became Professor of Comparative Anatomy at University College London, a post he held from 1827 until his death in 1874. Grant&#x27;s pay was £39 per annum. He was involved in radical and democratic causes, campaigning for a new Zoological Society museum run professionally rather than by aristocratic amateurs; and tried to turn the British Museum into a research institution run along French lines. He was opposed by Tories who attacked him for supporting &quot;the reptile press&quot; and its &quot;blasphemous derision of the truths of Christianity&quot; and succeeded in getting him voted out of a post at the Zoological Society of London. Richard Owen, vehemently opposed to Grant&#x27;s evolution theory, succeeded in supplanting him.

Darwin visited Grant in 1831 to get advice on storing specimens immediately before setting out on the Voyage of the Beagle. When Darwin returned from his voyage, Grant was one of those to offer to examine his specimens, but was turned down: they do not seem to have had further contact.

==Views==
On his frequent trips to the continent Grant became close friends with Geoffroy, a leading French comparative anatomist. The Edinburgh extramural medical schools were fertile ground for Geoffroy&#x27;s ideas, and Scottish radicals became Geoffroyan disciples. These included William A. F. Browne, a phrenologist who later turned his energies to asylum reform and neurological psychiatry. Grant took these ideas to London, where he introduced homology (the basic Geoffroyan technique) to his UCL students. He also advanced Lamarck and de Blainville, whose ideas were of similar vein, and included ideas of recapitulation theory.

===Background on Geoffroy===
Geoffroy was a deist, and his theory was not a theory of common descent, but a working-out of existing potential in a given type. For him, the environment causes a direct induction of organic change. This opinion Ernst Mayr labels as &#x27;Geoffroyism&#x27;. It is definitely not what Lamarck believed (for Lamarck, a change in &quot;habits&quot; is what changes the animal). Lawrence had argued in 1816 that the climate does not directly cause the differences between human races.

Geoffroy&#x27;s comparative anatomy featured the comparison of the same organ or group of bones through a range of animals. He argued (1818–22) for the &#x27;unity of composition&#x27; of all vertebrates. One of his major discoveries was the homology of the opercular plates of the gill cover of fishes with the inner ear ossicles of mammals. Geoffroy&#x27;s methods worked well for vertebrates, but when he compared vertebrates to invertebrates by turning invertebrates upside down and partly inside out – &quot;every animal is either inside or outside its vertebral column&quot; – he met his nemesis. The Geoffroy-Cuvier debate in Paris before the Académie des Sciences (15 February 1830) saw Georges Cuvier demolish his claim that the four Cuvierian branches of the animal kingdom could be reduced to one. The relation between the ideas of Geoffroy and Cuvier can be expressed thus: whereas with Cuvier structure determines function, with Geoffroy function determines structure. The issue between them, however, was religious, political and social as well as scientific.

===Grant&#x27;s programme===
Grant first went public on the subject of evolution in 1826. Here he speculated that &#x27;transformation&#x27; might affect all organisms. He noted that successive strata seemed to show a progressive, natural succession of fossil animals. These forms &quot;have evolved from a primitive model&quot; by &quot;external circumstances&quot;: this is a clear Lamarckian statement. Also, Grant accepted a common origin for plants and animals, and the basic units of life (&#x27;monads&#x27;), he proposed, were spontaneously generated. This is both reductionism and materialism. The programme went further than either Geoffroy or Lamarck, but was not a complete theory of evolution.

===Radicalism and Wakley===
Grant was a &#x27;progressive&#x27; in both social and scientific terms. He was widely and probably correctly regarded as a materialist or atheist: there was no place for the supernatural in his account of biology. He was a supporter of Thomas Wakley, &quot;The Lancet&quot; and the BMA, all of whom were anti-establishment in their day. The main idea of the radical reformers was that government should take over or at least oversee the licensing powers of the medical corporations.

When Grant came to London he was not eligible to become a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London (RCP) because he was not a graduate of Oxford or Cambridge. Others who wished to practice in England had to take a licence from the RCP or acquire an apothecary&#x27;s qualification. Grant refused to take out a London licence from the RCP, and so cut himself off from a lucrative source of income. He campaigned all his life for reform to both the RCP and the Royal College of Surgeons of London.

Wakley responded to Grant&#x27;s support for the &quot;Lancet&quot; and its radical programme with fulsome praise of Grant, and printed the text of all 60 lectures of Grant&#x27;s comparative anatomy course in the &quot;Lancet&quot; for 1833–4. Reviewers agreed that Grant&#x27;s course was the first &#x27;comprehensive and accessible&#x27; exposition of philosophical anatomy in English.

==Death and legacy==

Grant died at home at 2 Euston Grove, Euston Square, London, still occupying the chair at UCL, a forgotten anachronism. In his will he bequeathed his estate, of less than £1,500, to UCL. He was buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery.

The second half of Grant&#x27;s long professional life was not successful, and his style of teaching zoology was swept aside by T. H. Huxley&#x27;s disciple E. Ray Lankester, in the new Jodrell Chair of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy. Lankester did, however, retain, reorganise and expand the college zoology museum, now known as the Grant Museum of Zoology at UCL.

Robert Edmond Grant is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of African snake, &quot;Gonionotophis grantii&quot;.

<text>Terry Jones&#x27; Medieval Lives is a 2004 television documentary series produced for the BBC. Written and hosted by Terry Jones, each half-hour episode examines a particular medieval personality, with the intent of separating myth from reality.

The episode &quot;The Peasant&quot; was nominated for &quot;Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming&quot; at the 2004 Emmy Awards. Dr. Faye Getz acted as consultant for the series.

==Misunderstood history==
Being a comedian as well as an historian, Jones takes an established belief, turns that around, and presents proof for his assertion. For example, peasants did not live in complete squalor and actually owned property. Also class divisions were not as severe as people think; there are cases of low-born people who rise to quite high positions.

In the episode on kings, he says, &quot;History isn&#x27;t necessarily what happened. It&#x27;s often what people want us to think happened.&quot; He uses the following examples:

*Richard the Lionheart was actually a bad king, who only saw England (which he hated) as a means to finance his warmongering. Richard III did a lot of good for England. Modern perceptions of these kings are reversed because, Jones asserts, chroniclers of the time were commissioned to write what was politically most convenient.
*Louis, Count of Artois (later King of France), was acclaimed as King of England in 1216, yet appears in no history books (see First Baron&#x27;s War) because of, Jones asserts, embarrassment over a &quot;second French invasion&quot;.

Jones explained his motivation for making this series in the article in &quot;The Observer&quot;: &quot;The main reason I wanted to make &quot;Medieval Lives&quot; was to get my own back on the Renaissance. It&#x27;s not that the Renaissance has ever done me any harm personally, you understand. It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m sick of the way people&#x27;s eyes light up when they start talking about the Renaissance. I&#x27;m sick of the way art critics tend to say: &#x27;Aaaah! The Renaissance!&#x27; with that deeply self-satisfied air of someone who is at last getting down to the &#x27;Real Thing&#x27;. And I&#x27;m sick to death of that ridiculous assumption that before the Renaissance human beings had no sense of individuality.&quot;

==Episode list==
The eight episodes were as follows:

* The Peasant
* The Monk
* The Damsel
* The Minstrel
* The Knight
* The Philosopher (Alchemist)
* The Outlaw
* The King

<text>The wedding at Cana (also called the marriage at Cana, wedding feast at Cana or marriage feast at Cana) is a story in the Gospel of John at which the first miracle attributed to Jesus takes place.

In the Gospel account, Jesus, his mother and his disciples are invited to a wedding at Cana in Galilee. When his mother notices that the wine () has run out, Jesus delivers a sign of his divinity by turning water into wine at her request. The location of Cana has been subject to debate among biblical scholars and archaeologists; several villages in Galilee are possible candidates.

The account is taken as evidence of Jesus&#x27; approval of marriage and earthly celebrations, and has also been used as an argument against teetotalism.

==Biblical account==
The second chapter of the Gospel of John states that Jesus was at a wedding () in Cana with his disciples. Jesus&#x27; mother (unnamed in the Gospel of John) told Jesus, &quot;They have no wine,&quot; and Jesus replied, &quot;Woman, what concern is that to you and to me? My hour has not yet come.&quot; His mother then said to the servants, &quot;Do whatever he tells you&quot;. Jesus ordered the servants to fill containers with water and to draw out some and take it to the chief (household official, master of the feast). After tasting it, without knowing where it came from, the steward remarked to the bridegroom that he had departed from the custom of serving the best wine first by serving it last. John adds that: &quot;Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana of Galilee, and it revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him&quot;.

==Interpretation==
The Wedding Feast takes place in Cana shortly after the call of Philip and Nathanael. According to John 21:2, Cana was Nathanael&#x27;s hometown.

Although none of the synoptic Gospels mentions the wedding at Cana, Christian tradition based on John 2:11 holds that this is the first public miracle of Jesus. It is considered to have symbolic importance as the first of the seven signs in the Gospel of John by which Jesus&#x27; divine status is attested, and around which the gospel is structured. Jesus will later return to Cana, where John 4:46–54 describes him healing a Capernaum official&#x27;s young son; the second sign in the Gospel of John.

The story has had considerable importance in the development of Roman Catholic theology. Bishop Fulton J. Sheen thought that it is very likely that it was one of Mary&#x27;s relatives who was being married. This would mean Mary and her relatives would be embarrassed if they appeared inhospitable by running out of wine, giving Mary a reason to ask Jesus to intervene. Sheen further suggests that as Jesus arrived with additional guests, they may have contributed to the wines running short. When his mother advises Jesus that their hosts are running out of wine, he says &quot;Woman, what has this to do with me?&quot; Sheen sees an echo of the Protevangelium of Genesis 3:15 &quot;I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers&quot;, marking the commencement of Jesus&#x27; redemptive ministry. Jesus will again address her as &quot;Woman&quot; in John 19:26, when he entrusts his mother to his disciple John, &quot;Woman, behold, your son.&quot;

The gospel account of Jesus being invited to a wedding, attending, and using his divine power to save the celebrations from disaster are taken as evidence of his approval for marriage and earthly celebrations. It has also been used as an argument against the teetotalism practiced among certain Protestant Christian denominations.

Interpreted allegorically, the good news and hope implied by the story are in the words of the steward of the Feast when he tasted the good wine, &quot;Everyone serves the good wine first, and then the inferior wine after the guests have become drunk. But you have kept the good wine until now&quot; (John 2:10). This could be interpreted by saying simply that it is always darkest before the dawn, but good things are on the way. The more usual interpretation, however, is that this is a reference to the appearance of Jesus, whom the author of the Fourth Gospel regards as being himself &quot;the good wine&quot;. According to Bill Day, the miracle may also be interpreted as the antitype of Moses&#x27; first public miracle of changing water (the Nile river) into blood. This would establish a symbolic link between Moses as the first saviour of the Jews through their escape from Egypt and Jesus as the spiritual saviour of all people.

Some commentators have speculated about the identity of the unnamed bridegroom. One tradition, represented by Thomas Aquinas among others, holds that the bridegroom was John the Evangelist himself, a tradition that goes back to Bede. PECUSA Bishop John Spong suggests in his book &quot;Born of a Woman&quot; that the event was the wedding of Jesus himself to Mary Magdalene. In 1854, at a time when polygamy was an element of mainstream practice of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Latter-day Saint elder Orson Hyde made a similar suggestion, arguing that Jesus was a polygamist and that the event at Cana was his wedding to Mary Magdalene, Martha and Mary of Bethany. However, the idea that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene is usually dismissed by scholars as pseudohistorical.

Studying Jesus in comparative mythology, the story of the transformation of water into wine bears some resemblance to a number of stories that were told about the ancient Greek god Dionysus, who among others was said to fill with wine the empty barrels that had been left locked inside a temple overnight. However, scholars generally agree that the Gospel of John was written by a community of Jewish Christians who had recently been excommunicated by the local synagogue for recognizing Jesus as the Messiah, leading some to conclude that it would be making it unlikely the possibility that the Gospel was influenced by ancient Greek mythology. Bart Ehrman argues that the idea that the image of Jesus was influenced by ancient pagan mythology is usually dismissed by scholars as a fringe theory.

The view of the valley looking out towards Nazareth, from Khirbet Qana, would have predominantly been of grape vines, as archeologists have found evidence of 1st-century wine production. The early 6th-century writer Antoninus Placentinus observed about Nazareth in his day: &quot;it excels in wine and oil, fruits and honey.&quot; So, if a miracle of turning water into wine had actually occurred at the site, it would likely have had allegorical significance for observers familiar with Greek mythology.

The German theologian Friedrich Justus Knecht (died 1921) points out three lessons that are to be drawn from this account at Cana:
==Identification of biblical Cana==
The exact location of &quot;Cana in Galilee&quot; (, ) has been subject to debate among scholars. Modern scholars maintain that since the Gospel of John was addressed to Jewish Christians of the time, it is unlikely that the evangelist would mention a place that did not exist. However, Dominican scholar Jerome Murphy-O&#x27;Connor cautions that Cana is a very common name, with no known text offering any clue as to which of the dozen towns going by the name would be the correct one, and calls the common choice of Kafr Qanna near Nazareth &quot;probably just a pious guess&quot;.

The main candidates for the town from the Gospel of John are:
* Kafr Kanna, in Galilee, locally identified at least since the 8th century with the biblical location;
* Khirbet Qana, also in Galilee;
* Qana, southern Lebanon, in an area that was part of historical Galilee.

According to the Catholic Encyclopedia of 1914, a tradition dating back to the 8th century identifies Cana with the modern Arab town of Kafr Kanna, in Galilee, about northeast of Nazareth, in today&#x27;s Israel.

The ruined village of Khirbet Qana (Kanet el-Jelil), about further north, is an option presented as certain by William F. Albright in 1923, whose name &quot;Qana&quot; is also etymologically closer to Cana than &quot;Kanna&quot;.

Some Lebanese Christians, especially the Lebanese Melkites (Greek Catholics), supported by their Church, believe the southern Lebanese village of Qana to have been the actual location of this event.

The spring of &#x27;Ain Kanah (&quot;Kanah Spring&quot;) near the village of Reineh, immediately northeast of Nazareth, has been proposed as an equally likely site by Conder in 1878, but has little going for it and has been rejected in more recent scholarship as a candidate.

==Vessels and beverage==
===Stone jars===
Many throughout history have sought to recover the lost jars. On 21 December 2004, archaeologists reported finding in Kafr Kanna &quot;pieces of large stone jars of the type the Gospel says Jesus used when he turned water into wine&quot;. But American scientists excavating the rival site of Khirbet Qana north of it, also claimed to have found pieces of stone jars from the time of Jesus. Fellow archaeologist Shimon Gibson cast doubt on the value of such finds for identifying the town meant by John, since such vessels are not rare and it would be impossible to link a particular set of vessels to the miracle. &quot;Just the existence of stone vessels is not enough to prove that this is a biblical site.&quot; Several stone jars of the type described by the Gospel of John were found for instance in Jerusalem: &quot;At least six of them stood in the basement kitchen of the [1st-century CE] &#x27;Burnt house&#x27;. They were shaped and finished on a very big lathe, given a pedestal foot and simple decoration. Such stone jars would hold large quantities of water for washing and kitchen needs. Flat discs of stone served as lids. The jars at Cana may have been similar to these&quot;, wrote Alan Millard.

===Wine or beer===
In the journal &quot;Biblical Archaeology Review&quot;, Michael Homan argued that biblical scholars had misinterpreted early texts, translating to &#x27;wine&#x27; when the more sensible translation would have been &#x27;beer&#x27;. However, this has been dismissed by other writers, who pointed out that the Greek always means wine, and that the word was available if the gospel author wanted to refer to barley beer.

The Coptic Orthodox Church, alone among the apostolic churches, teaches that the wine was non-alcoholic. However, the second century Coptic Saint Clement of Alexandria would appear to indicate the opposite when he states that, although the Lord approved of drinking wine, he did not approve of drunkenness.

==Feast==
The Coptic Church observes the feast of the Wedding of Cana three days after Epiphany, i.e. on the 13th of Tobi according to the Coptic calendar. It is counted as one of the 7 Minor Feasts of the Lord.

==Influence==
===In art===

Depictions of &quot;The Wedding&quot; or &quot;Marriage at Cana&quot; are numerous in art history.

===In media===
*1988&#x27;s &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; includes a scene in which Jesus attends a wedding and turns water into wine.
*In the 2019-present Angel Studios TV series, &quot;The Chosen&quot;, Season 2 episode, &quot;The Wedding Gift&quot;, the day of the wedding is portrayed accurately from the Bible’s New Testament, with Jonathan Roumie providing the portrayal of Jesus.

===Saint Columba miracle===
Sixth-century Irish missionary Saint Columba of Iona supposedly performed an identical miracle when he served as a deacon in Ireland under Finnian of Movilla, replenishing the supply of sacramental wine for a mass.

<text>Lachenaie was an off-island suburb of Montreal, in southwestern Quebec, Canada on the Rivière des Mille-Îles. It is now part of the city of Terrebonne, and is in the Regional County Municipality of Les Moulins. In 2001, the population was 21,709.
== History ==
In 1647, the Company of New France granted Pierre Legardeur de Repentigny a seigneury that he named Repentigny. In 1670, the Legardeur family ceded part of its seigneury to Charles Aubert de La Chesnaye, one of the most important landowners in New France. The first settlers would not land in Lachenaie until two years later.

Lachenaie was the 34th parish to be created in New France when it was founded in 1683 by the seigneur of the same name. The following year, fortifications were built around the seigneurial domain just in time to protect against the Iroquois who were threatening the French colonies of the time.

Far from having been spared by the Franco-Iroquois War, Lachenaie was the most affected parish in New France. After this war, for which the peace treaty was signed in 1701, only half of the Lachenois population remained, numbering only 32 souls.

Construction of the famous Chemin du Roy began in 1731, along the Mille-Îles River (now the Saint-Charles Road). The status of Lachenaie has been modified several times: from the municipality of Lachenaie, it became the County Municipality of Lachenaie and finally became the municipality of Saint-Charles-de-Lachenaie in 1855.

Finally, it was in 1972 that the municipality of the Parish of Saint-Charles-de-Lachenaie became the City of Lachenaie. The city celebrated its 300th anniversary in 1983.
On June 27, 2001 Lachenaie La Plaine and Terrebonne merged under the new name of Terrebonne

==Climate==
Lachenaie has a warm summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm summers and cold winters the lowest temperature ever recorded was -38°C (-37°F) on January 15th, 1957 and the highest temperature recorded was 35°C (95°F) on July 8th, 2010</text><links>

<doc id="733979" wikidata="Q3100466" url="?curid=733979" title="Gene Oliver">
<text>Eugene George Oliver (March 22, 1935 – March 3, 2007) was an American professional baseball player who appeared 786 games in Major League Baseball, as a catcher, first baseman, outfielder and pinch hitter, from 1959 to 1969. Oliver played for the St. Louis Cardinals (1959, 1961–63), Milwaukee / Atlanta Braves (1963–67), Philadelphia Phillies (1967), Boston Red Sox (1968) and Chicago Cubs (1968–69). He batted and threw right-handed. stood tall and weighed .

==Early life==
Oliver was born in Moline, Illinois, the eldest son and fourth of five children born to Stella () and Marshall Oliver. His father, a farm equipment worker, was an immigrant from Belgium while his mother was an immigrant from Poland.

He graduated from Alleman Catholic High School where he was a three-sport star. Initially, he was being scouted by the Detroit Tigers, turning down a $60,000 bonus for a football scholarship to Northwestern University. However, a shoulder injury during a high school football match ended his football career as well as the Tigers&#x27; interest in him. He attended Northwestern on a baseball scholarship but left after two years, feeling dejected.

While working at IBM, his wife Marilyn encouraged him to continue baseball. Oliver began to rehabilitate his arm under his former coach from American Legion baseball. He attracted Joe Monahan, a scout from the St. Louis Cardinals who had previously been interested in him. He arranged a tryout at a local YMCA; Monahan found his arm to be sound and signed him with the Cardinals in 1956.

==Baseball career==
===Minor leagues===
Oliver began his professional baseball career in the Class-D Albany Cardinals of the Georgia-Florida League where was very briefly before moving to the Class-D Ardmore Cardinals of the Sooner State League where he hit .333 with 39 home runs and 113 runs batted in in 122 games.

The following year, he moved to the Class-B Winston-Salem Red Birds of the Carolina League, hitting .285 with 30 home runs. For his strong performance, he was promoted to the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings of the International League where he remained for three seasons except for a 68-game stint with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1959. In 1961, he began to year with the Cardinals, where he was used sparingly by manager Solly Hemus, before being sent Triple-A Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League.

===Major leagues===
Although he spent seven full years and three partial seasons in the majors, Oliver was a regular for only two seasons, as the catcher for the Cardinals in and the first baseman for the Braves in . Oliver had a strong arm and was good at blocking the plate. As a batter, he had some power and decent speed for a catcher.

He made his major league debut in 1959 against the Philadelphia Phillies but would not stick with the parent club until . He was traded to the Milwaukee Braves in 1963 and remained there till 1967.

In , Oliver reached a high-career mark of 21 home runs with the Braves in their final season in Milwaukee, enabling the 1965 Braves to set a National League record with six 20-HR hitters in one season. On June 8 of that year, Joe Torre, Eddie Mathews, Hank Aaron and Oliver hit tenth-inning home runs in a Braves victory over the Cubs, setting a major league record for most long balls in a single inning of an extra-inning game.

The Phillies and Braves switched catchers in 1967, with Bob Uecker going to Atlanta. After the trade, Oliver suffered a severe knee injury that shortened his career. Before the 1968 season, he was traded first to the Boston Red Sox and then sold to the Chicago Cubs before being released the following season.

In his ten-season career, Oliver hit .246 with 93 home runs, 320 runs batted in, 268 runs scored, 111 doubles, five triples, and 24 stolen bases in 786 games.

In contrast to his less-than-stellar career, Oliver hit future Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax better than average, going 20-for-51 (.392) with 4 home runs and 9 runs batted in. At a banquet dias the two were attending together, years after they both had retired, Koufax joked to Oliver: &quot;How did a putz like you hit .392 off me?&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1955, Oliver married Marilyn (); they were married for 52 years, until his death. They had two children, Dana and Daniel, and six grandchildren.

Oliver remained close to his former Cubs teammates and acted as social director for Randy Hundley&#x27;s fantasy baseball camps.

He died in Rock Island, Illinois, on March 3, 2007, due to complications from lung surgery, and was interred at Calvary Mausoleum in Rock Island. He was survived by his wife and two children. Former teammates, including Hundley and Glenn Beckert attended his funeral.

<doc id="733981" wikidata="Q421381" url="?curid=733981" title="Flecainide">
<text>Flecainide is a medication used to prevent and treat abnormally fast heart rates. This includes ventricular and supraventricular tachycardias. Its use is only recommended in those with dangerous arrhythmias or when significant symptoms cannot be managed with other treatments. Its use does not decrease a person&#x27;s risk of death. It is taken by mouth or injection into a vein.
Common side effects include dizziness, problems seeing, shortness of breath, chest pain, and tiredness. Serious side effects may include cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and heart failure. It may be used in pregnancy, but has not been well studied in this population. Use is not recommended in those with structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease. Flecainide is a class Ic antiarrhythmic agent. It works by decreasing the entry of sodium in heart cells, causing prolongation of the cardiac action potential.
Flecainide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1985. It is available as a generic medication. In 2021, it was the 205th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2million prescriptions.
==Medical uses==
Flecainide is used in the treatment of many types of supraventricular tachycardias, including AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW).

It also has limited use in the treatment of certain forms of ventricular tachycardia (VT). In particular, flecainide has been useful in the treatment of ventricular tachycardias that are not in the setting of an acute ischemic event. It has use in the treatment of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) tachycardia and in the suppression of arrhythmias in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD). Studies (notably the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial) have shown an increased mortality when flecainide is used to suppress ventricular extrasystoles in the setting of acute myocardial infarction.

In individuals suspected of having the Brugada syndrome, the administration of flecainide may help reveal the ECG findings that are characteristic of the disease process. This may help make the diagnosis of the disease in equivocal cases.

Flecainide has been introduced into the treatment of arrhythmias in children.

In the long-term, flecainide seems to be safe in people with a healthy heart with no signs of left ventricular hypertrophy, ischemic heart disease, or heart failure.

==Side effects==
Results of a medical study known as the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) demonstrated that patients with structural heart disease (such as a history of MI (heart attack), or left ventricular dysfunction) and also patients with ventricular arrhythmias, should not take this drug. The results were so significant that the trial was stopped early and preliminary results were published.

The dose may need to be adjusted in certain clinical scenarios. As with all other antiarrhythmic agents, there is a risk of proarrhythmia associated with the use of flecainide. This risk is probably increased when flecainide is co-administered with other class Ic antiarrhythmics, such as encainide. The risk of proarrhythmia may also be increased by hypokalemia. The risk of proarrhythmia is not necessarily associated with the length of time an individual is taking flecainide, and cases of late proarrhythmia have been reported. Because of the role of both the liver and the kidneys in the elimination of flecainide, the dosing of flecainide may need to be adjusted in individuals who develop either liver failure or kidney failure.

Because of the negative inotropic effects of flecainide, it should be used with caution in individuals with depressed ejection fraction, and may worsen congestive heart failure in these individuals. It should be avoided in people with ischaemic heart disease and the elderly.

As with all class I antiarrhythmic agents, flecainide increases the capture thresholds of pacemakers.

===Heart===
Due to the narrow therapeutic index of flecainide, physicians should be alert for signs of toxicity before life-threatening arrhythmias occur like torsades de pointes. While the toxic effects of flecainide are closely related to the plasma levels of the drug, it is unfeasible to check the plasma concentration in an individual on a regular basis.

Signs of flecainide toxicity include marked prolongation of the PR interval and widening of the QRS duration on the surface ECG. There may be signs and symptoms attributable to overt heart failure secondary to sudden decreased myocardial contractility.

====Treatment====
Treatment of flecainide cardiac toxicity involves increasing the excretion of flecainide, blocking its effects in the heart, and (rarely) institution of cardiovascular support to avoid impending lethal arrhythmias. Modalities that have had success include administration of a beta-sympathomimetic agent, and administration of a sodium load(often in the form of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate). Placing the individual on cardiopulmonary bypass support may be necessary in order to temporarily remove the need for a beating heart and to increase blood flow to the liver.

===Lungs===
Flecainide has a very high affinity for lung tissue and is associated with drug-induced interstitial lung disease.

== Interactions ==

Flecainide has high bioavailability after an oral dose, meaning that most of the drug that is ingested will enter the systemic blood stream. Peak serum concentrations can be seen 1 to 6 hours after ingestion of an oral dose. While the plasma half-life is about 20 hours, it is quite variable, and can range from 12 to 27 hours. During oral loading with flecainide, a steady state equilibrium is typically achieved in 3 to 5 days.

The majority of flecainide is eliminated by the kidneys, with the remainder metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2D6 isoenzyme in the liver. Therefore, alterations in renal function or urine pH will greatly affect the elimination of flecainide, as more is eliminated by the kidney than by the hepatic route.

Because of the dual elimination routes of flecainide and its tendency to decrease myocardial contractility, flecainide interacts with numerous pharmaceuticals and can potentiate the effects of other myocardial depressants and AV node blocking agents. In addition, flecainide can decrease the metabolism or elimination of many (but not all) agents that use the cytochrome P450 enzyme system.

A full list of drug interactions with flecainide can be obtained from the manufacturer. Some important drug interactions with flecainide include:
* Alcohol – may further depress normal heart function
* Amiodarone – inhibits cytochrome P450 2D6 and may increase flecainide levels
* Cimetidine – increases flecainide levels by 30% and half-life by 10%
* Digoxin – may increase digoxin levels
* Paroxetine – increased effect of both drugs
* Propafenone – increased effect of both drugs and increased risk of toxicity
* Quinidine – inhibits cytochrome P450 2D6 and may increase flecainide levels

==Overdose==
Flecainide intoxication is rare but serious due to the cardiogenic shock that it provokes. Its diagnosis can be difficult in the lack of contributing anamnestic elements. Clinical and paraclinical signs are not specific. Treatment is primarily symptomatic, which gives good results thanks to the hypertonic solution of sodium salts. Organ donation is possible in the case of braindead patients who had a flecainide intoxication.

==Mechanism of action==
Flecainide works by blocking the Nav1.5 sodium channel in the heart, slowing the upstroke of the cardiac action potential. This thereby slows conduction of the electrical impulse within the heart, i.e. it &quot;reduces excitability&quot;. The greatest effect is on the His-Purkinje system and ventricular myocardium. The effect of flecainide on the ventricular myocardium causes decreased contractility of the muscle, which leads to a decrease in the ejection fraction.

The effect of flecainide on the sodium channels of the heart increases as the heart rate increases; This is known as use-dependence and is why that flecainide is useful to break a tachyarrhythmia.

Flecainide also inhibits ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2), a major regulator of sarcoplasmic release of stored calcium ions. It can reduce calcium sparks and thus arrhythmogenic calcium waves in the heart. While Flecainide therapy has been shown to suppress ventricular arrhythmias in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and mouse models of this disease, the relative contribution from the inhibition of sodium channels and of RyR2 in this effect on CPVT is unclear.

<text>In criminal law, criminal negligence is an offence that involves a breach of an objective standard of behaviour expected of a defendant. It may be contrasted with strictly liable offences, which do not consider states of mind in determining criminal liability, or offenses that requires mens rea, a mental state of guilt.

==Concept==
To constitute a crime, there must be an &quot;actus reus&quot; (Latin for &quot;guilty act&quot;) accompanied by the &quot;mens rea&quot; (see concurrence). Negligence shows the least level of culpability, intention being the most serious, and recklessness being of intermediate seriousness, overlapping with gross negligence. The distinction between recklessness and criminal negligence lies in the presence or absence of foresight as to the prohibited consequences. Recklessness is usually described as a &quot;malfeasance&quot; where the defendant knowingly exposes another to the risk of injury. The fault lies in being willing to run the risk. But criminal negligence is a &quot;misfeasance&quot; or &quot;nonfeasance&quot; (see omission), where the fault lies in the failure to foresee and so allow otherwise avoidable dangers to manifest. In some cases this failure can rise to the level of willful blindness, where the individual intentionally avoids adverting to the reality of a situation. (In the United States, there may sometimes be a slightly different interpretation for willful blindness.) The degree of culpability is determined by applying a reasonable-person standard. Criminal negligence becomes &quot;gross&quot; when the failure to foresee involves a &quot;wanton disregard for human life&quot; (see the definitions of corporate manslaughter and in many common law jurisdictions of gross negligence manslaughter). 

The test of any &quot;mens rea&quot; element is always based on an assessment of whether the accused had foresight of the prohibited consequences and desired to cause those consequences to occur. The three types of test are:
#subjective where the court attempts to establish what the accused was actually thinking at the time the &quot;actus reus&quot; was caused;
#objective where the court imputes &quot;mens rea&quot; elements on the basis that a reasonable person with the same general knowledge and abilities as the accused would have had those elements; or
#hybrid, i.e., the test is both subjective and objective.
The most culpable &quot;mens rea&quot; elements will have both foresight and desire on a subjective basis. Negligence arises when, on a subjective test, an accused has not actually foreseen the potentially adverse consequences to the planned actions, and has gone ahead, exposing a particular individual or unknown victim to the risk of suffering injury or loss. The accused is a social danger because they have endangered the safety of others in circumstances where the reasonable person would have foreseen the injury and taken preventive measures.

==Reasonable person standard==
&quot;Reasonable person standard&quot; does not pertain to a real person, but rather a legal fiction. It is an objective yardstick against which to measure the culpability of real people. For these purposes, the reasonable person is not an average person: this is not a democratic measure. To determine the appropriate level of responsibility, the test of reasonableness has to be directly relevant to the activities being undertaken by the accused. What the &quot;average person&quot; thinks or might do would be irrelevant in a case where a doctor is accused of wrongfully killing a patient during treatment. Hence, there is a baseline of minimum competence that all are expected to meet. This reasonable person is appropriately informed, capable, aware of the law, and fair-minded. This standard can never go down, but it can go up to match the training and abilities of the particular accused. In testing whether the particular doctor has misdiagnosed a patient so incompetently that it amounts to a crime, the standard must be that of a reasonable doctor. Those who hold themselves out as having particular skills must match the level of performance expected of people with comparable skills. When engaged in an activity outside their expertise, such individuals revert to the ordinary person standard. This is not to deny that ordinary people might do something extraordinary in certain circumstances, but the ordinary person as an accused will not be at fault if they do not do that extraordinary thing so long as whatever that person does or thinks is reasonable in those circumstances.

The more contentious debate has surrounded the issue of whether the reasonable person should be subjectively matched to the accused in cases involving children, and persons with a physical or mental disability. Young and inexperienced individuals may not foresee what an adult might foresee, a blind person cannot see at all, and an autistic person may not relate to the world as a non-autistic person. Cases involving infancy and mental disorders as an insanity defense potentially invoke excuses to criminal liability because the accused lack full capacity, and criminal systems provide an overlapping set of provisions which can either deal with such individuals outside the criminal justice system, or if a criminal trial is unavoidable, mitigate the extent of liability through the sentencing system following conviction. Notwithstanding, those who have ordinary intellectual capacities are expected to act reasonably given their physical condition. Thus, a court would ask whether a blind reasonable person would have set out to do what the particular blind defendant did. People with physical disabilities rightly wish to be active members of the community but, if certain types of activity would endanger others, appropriate precautions must be put in place to ensure that the risks are reasonable.

==Examples==

===United States===
Examples of criminally negligent crimes are criminally negligent homicide and negligent endangerment of a child. Usually the punishment for criminal negligence, criminal recklessness, criminal endangerment, willful blindness and other related crimes is imprisonment, unless the criminal is insane (and then in some cases the sentence is indeterminate).

===English law===
The leading statement to describe &#x27;criminal negligence&#x27; at common law for the purposes of establishing a test for manslaughter in the law of England and Wales, is that of Lord Hewart in the case of &quot;R v Bateman&quot;:
In explaining to juries the test which they should apply to determine whether the negligence, in the particular case, amounted or did not amount to a crime, judges have used many epithets, such as &#x27;culpable&#x27;, &#x27;criminal&#x27;, &#x27;gross&#x27;, &#x27;wicked&#x27;, &#x27;clear&#x27;, &#x27;complete&#x27;. But, whatever epithet be used and whether an epithet be used or not, in order to establish criminal liability the facts must be such that, in the opinion of the jury, the negligence of the accused went beyond a mere matter of compensation between subjects and showed such disregard for the life and safety of others as to amount to a crime against the State and conduct deserving punishment.
For a murder, the &quot;mens rea&quot; is that of malice aforethought, a deliberate and sometimes premeditated killing. But the larger percentage of deaths result from situations where there is either no intention to injure another, or only an intention to inflict less serious injury. The need is therefore to be able to distinguish between those who happened to be present when another died accidentally or through misadventure, and those who have contributed to the death in a way that makes them criminally rather than merely morally responsible. For example, suppose that A, an expert in kayaking, organises an outing for local children who are learning the sport. They travel to a large lake but, after an hour of paddling, they are overtaken by a violent storm and some of the children drown despite all wearing life-preservers. If all the kayaks, paddles and ancillary equipment are shown to have been in good condition, the storm had not been forecast by the meteorological services, and it was reasonable for these children to undertake this type of outing given their level of skill/swimming, A will not have liability. But if many of the children were too inexperienced and/or a storm had been forecast, A might well be found liable by a jury.

===Canada===

The Criminal Code has a series of offences covering criminal negligence when bodily harm or death is caused. Such laws are sometimes used to prosecute cases of dangerous driving causing injury or death. The maximum penalties for criminal negligence causing bodily harm and death are 10 years (14 years if the conviction is for street racing causing bodily harm) and life imprisonment, respectively.

<doc id="733993" wikidata="Q221382" url="?curid=733993" title="1991 Soviet coup attempt">
<text>The 1991 Soviet coup attempt, also known as the August Coup, was a failed attempt by hardliners of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) to forcibly seize control of the country from Mikhail Gorbachev, who was Soviet President and General Secretary of the CPSU at the time. The coup leaders consisted of top military and civilian officials, including Vice President Gennady Yanayev, who together formed the State Committee on the State of Emergency (GKChP). They opposed Gorbachev&#x27;s reform program, were angry at the loss of control over Eastern European states and fearful of the New Union Treaty, which was on the verge of being signed by the Soviet Union (USSR). The treaty was to decentralize much of the central Soviet government&#x27;s power and distribute it among its fifteen republics; Yeltsin&#x27;s demand for more autonomy to the republics opened a window for the plotters to organize the coup.

The GKChP hardliners dispatched KGB agents who detained Gorbachev at his dacha but failed to detain the recently elected president of a newly reconstituted Russia, Boris Yeltsin, who had been both an ally and critic of Gorbachev. The GKChP was poorly organized and met with effective resistance by both Yeltsin and a civilian campaign of anti-authoritarian protesters, mainly in Moscow. The coup collapsed in two days, and Gorbachev returned to office while the plotters all lost their posts. Yeltsin subsequently became the dominant leader and Gorbachev lost much of his influence. The failed coup led to both the immediate collapse of the CPSU and the dissolution of the USSR four months later.

Following the capitulation of the GKChP, popularly referred to as the &quot;Gang of Eight&quot;, both the Supreme Court of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and President Gorbachev described its actions as a coup attempt.

==Background==
Since assuming power as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1985, Gorbachev had embarked on an ambitious reform program embodied in the twin concepts of &quot;perestroika&quot; (economic and political restructuring) and &quot;glasnost&quot; (openness). These moves prompted resistance and suspicion on the part of hard-line members of the &quot;nomenklatura&quot;. The reforms also caused nationalist agitation on the part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s non-Russian minorities to grow, and there were fears that some or all of the union republics might secede. In 1991, the Soviet Union was in a severe economic and political crisis. Scarcity of food, medicine, and other consumables was widespread, people had to stand in long lines to buy even essential goods, fuel stocks were as much as 50% lower than the estimated amount needed for the approaching winter, and inflation exceeded 300% per year, with factories lacking the cash needed to pay salaries.

In 1990, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Armenia had already declared the restoration of their independence from the Soviet Union. In January 1991, a violent attempt to return Lithuania to the Soviet Union by force took place. About a week later, a similar attempt was engineered by local pro-Soviet forces to overthrow Latvian authorities.

Russia declared its sovereignty on 12June 1990 and thereafter limited the application of Soviet laws, in particular those governing finance and the economy, on Russian territory. The Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR adopted laws that contradicted Soviet laws (the so-called War of Laws).

In the unionwide referendum on 17 March 1991, boycotted by the Baltic states, Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova, a supermajority of residents in the other republics expressed the desire to retain the renewed Soviet Union, with 77.85% voting in favor. Following negotiations, eight of the remaining nine republics (Ukraine abstaining) approved the New Union Treaty with some conditions. The treaty was to make the Soviet Union a federation of independent republics called the Union of Soviet Sovereign Republics, with a common president, foreign policy, and military. Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan were to sign the Treaty in Moscow on 20August 1991.

British historian Dan Stone wrote the following about the plotters&#x27; motivation: The coup was the last gasp of those who were astonished at and felt betrayed by the precipitous collapse of the Soviet Union&#x27;s empire in Eastern Europe and the swift destruction of the Warsaw Pact and Comecon that followed. Many feared the consequences of Gorbachev&#x27;s German policies above all, not just for leaving officers unemployed but for sacrificing gains achieved in the Great Patriotic War to German revanchism and irredentism – after all, this had been the Kremlin&#x27;s greatest fear since the end of the war.

==Preparation==

=== Planning ===
The KGB began considering a coup in September 1990. Soviet politician Alexander Yakovlev began warning Gorbachev about the possibility of one after the 28th Party Congress in June 1990. On 11December 1990, KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov made a &quot;call for order&quot; over the Moscow Programme television station. That day, he asked two KGB officers to prepare measures to be taken in the event a state of emergency was declared in the USSR. Later, Kryuchkov brought Soviet Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov, Central Control Commission Chairman Boris Pugo, Premier Valentin Pavlov, Vice President Gennady Yanayev, Soviet Defense Council deputy chief Oleg Baklanov, Gorbachev secretariat head Valery Boldin, and CPSU Central Committee Secretary Oleg Shenin into the conspiracy.

When Kryuchkov complained about the Soviet Union&#x27;s growing instability to the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies, Gorbachev attempted to appease him by issuing a presidential decree enhancing the powers of the KGB and appointing Pugo to the Cabinet as Minister of Internal Affairs. Foreign Secretary Eduard Shevardnadze resigned in protest and rejected an offered appointment as vice president, warning that &quot;a dictatorship is coming.&quot; Gorbachev was forced to appoint Yanayev in his place.

Beginning with the January Events in Lithuania, members of Gorbachev&#x27;s Cabinet hoped that he could be persuaded to declare a state of emergency and &quot;restore order,&quot; and formed the State Committee on the State of Emergency (GKChP).

On 17June 1991, Soviet Premier Pavlov requested extraordinary powers from the Supreme Soviet. Several days later, Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov informed U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Jack F. Matlock Jr. that a coup against Gorbachev was being planned. When Matlock tried to warn him, Gorbachev falsely assumed that his own Cabinet was not involved and underestimated the risk of a coup. Gorbachev reversed Pavlov&#x27;s request for more powers and jokingly told his Cabinet &quot;The coup is over,&quot; remaining oblivious to their plans.

On 23July 1991, several party functionaries and literati published a piece in the hardline &quot;Sovetskaya Rossiya&quot; newspaper, entitled &quot;A Word to the People&quot;, that called for decisive action to prevent calamity.

Six days later, on 29July, Gorbachev, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev discussed the possibility of replacing hardliners such as Pavlov, Yazov, Kryuchkov and Pugo with more liberal figures, with Nazarbayev as Prime Minister (in Pavlov&#x27;s place). Kryuchkov, who had placed Gorbachev under close surveillance as Subject 110 several months earlier, eventually got wind of the conversation from an electronic bug planted by Gorbachev&#x27;s bodyguard, Vladimir Medvedev. Yeltsin also prepared for a coup by establishing a secret defense committee, ordering military and KGB commands to side with RSFSR authorities and establishing a &quot;reserve government&quot; in Sverdlovsk under Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Lobov.

=== Commencement ===
On 4August, Gorbachev went on holiday to his dacha in Foros, Crimea. He planned to return to Moscow in time for the New Union Treaty signing on 20August. On 15August, the text of the draft treaty was published, which would have stripped the coup planners of much of their authority.

On 17August, the members of the GKChP met at a KGB guesthouse in Moscow and studied the treaty document. Decisions were made to introduce a state of emergency from 19August, to form a State Emergency Committee, and require Gorbachev to sign the relevant decrees or to resign and transfer powers to Vice President Yanayev. They believed the pact would pave the way for the Soviet Union&#x27;s breakup, and decided it was time to act. The next day, Baklanov, Boldin, Shenin, and Soviet Deputy Defense Minister General Valentin Varennikov flew to Crimea for a meeting with Gorbachev. Yazov ordered General Pavel Grachev, commander of the Soviet Airborne Forces, to begin coordinating with KGB Deputy Chairmen Viktor Grushko and Genii Ageev to implement martial law.

At 4:32pm on 18August, the GKChP cut communications to Gorbachev&#x27;s dacha, including telephone landlines and the nuclear command and control system. Eight minutes later Lieutenant General Yuri Plekhanov, Head of the Ninth Chief Directorate of the KGB, allowed the group into Gorbachev&#x27;s dacha. Gorbachev realized what was happening after discovering the telephone outages. Baklanov, Boldin, Shenin and Varennikov demanded that Gorbachev either declare a state of emergency or resign and name Yanayev as acting president to allow the members of the GKChP &quot;to restore order&quot; to the country.

Gorbachev has always claimed that he refused point-blank to accept the ultimatum. Varennikov has insisted that Gorbachev said: &quot;Damn you. Do what you want. But report my opinion!&quot; However, those present at the dacha at the time testified that Baklanov, Boldin, Shenin and Varennikov had been clearly disappointed and nervous after the meeting with Gorbachev. Gorbachev is said to have insulted Varennikov by pretending to forget his name, and to have told his former trusted advisor Boldin &quot;Shut up, you prick! How dare you give me lectures about the situation in the country!&quot; With Gorbachev&#x27;s refusal, the conspirators ordered that he remain confined to the dacha. Additional KGB security guards were placed at the dacha gates with orders to stop anybody from leaving.

At 7:30pm, Baklanov, Boldin, Shenin and Varennikov flew to Moscow, accompanied by Plekhanov. His deputy, Vyacheslav Generalov, remained &quot;on the farm&quot; in Foros.

At 8:00pm, Yanayev, Pavlov, Kryuchkov, Yazov, Pugo and Soviet Supreme Soviet Chairman Anatoly Lukyanov gathered in the Kremlin cabinet of the Prime Minister, discussing and editing the documents of the State Emergency Committee. At 10:15pm, they were joined by Baklanov, Shenin, Boldin, Varennikov and Plekhanov. It was decided to publicly declare Gorbachev ill. Yanayev hesitated, but the others convinced him that leadership and responsibility would be collective.

At 11:25pm, Yanayev signed a decree entrusting himself with presidential powers.

GKChP members ordered that 250,000 pairs of handcuffs from a factory in Pskov be sent to Moscow, also ordering 300,000 arrest forms. Kryuchkov doubled the pay of all KGB personnel, called them back from holiday, and placed them on alert. Lefortovo Prison was emptied to receive prisoners.

==The coup chronology==
The members of the GKChP met in the Kremlin after Baklanov, Boldin, Shenin and Varennikov returned from Crimea. Yanayev (who had only just been persuaded to join the plot), Pavlov and Baklanov signed the so-called &quot;Declaration of the Soviet Leadership&quot;, which declared a state of emergency in the entirety of the USSR and announced that the State Committee on the State of Emergency (Государственный Комитет по Чрезвычайному Положению, ГКЧП, or &quot;Gosudarstvenniy Komitet po Chrezvichaynomu Polozheniyu&quot;, &quot;GKChP&quot;) had been created &quot;to manage the country and effectively maintain the regime of the state of emergency&quot;. The GKChP included the following members:
* Gennady Yanayev, Vice President
* Valentin Pavlov, Prime Minister
* Vladimir Kryuchkov, head of the KGB
* Dmitry Yazov, Minister of Defence
* Boris Pugo, Minister of Interior
* Oleg Baklanov, First Deputy Chairman of the Defense Council under the President of the USSR
* Vasily Starodubtsev, Chairman of the Peasant Union
* Alexander Tizyakov, President of the Association of the State Enterprises and Objects of Industry, Transport, and Communications

Yanayev signed the decree naming himself acting Soviet President, using the pretense of Gorbachev&#x27;s inability to perform presidential duties due to &quot;illness&quot;. However, Russian investigators later identified Kryuchkov as the key planner of the coup. Yanayev later claimed that he had been forced to participate in the coup under the threat of arrest. The eight aforementioned GKChP members became known as the &quot;Gang of Eight&quot;.

The GKChP banned all Moscow newspapers except for nine party-controlled newspapers. It also issued a populist declaration which stated that &quot;the honour and dignity of the Soviet man must be restored.&quot;

===Monday 19 August===

==== Early hours ====
At 1:00am, Yanayev signed documents on the formation of the State Committee for the State of Emergency (GKChP), consisting of himself, Pavlov, Kryuchkov, Yazov, Pugo, Baklanov, Tizyakov and Starodubtsev. Included in the documents was the &quot;Appeal to the Soviet people&quot;.

The GKChP members present signed GKChP Resolution No. 1, which introduced the following: a state of emergency &quot;in certain areas of the USSR&quot; lasting six months from 4:00am Moscow time on 19August; the prohibition of rallies, demonstrations and strikes; suspension of the activities of political parties, public organizations and mass movements that impede the normalization of the situation; and the allocation of up to of land to all interested city residents for personal use.

At 4:00am, the Sevastopol regiment of KGB border troops surrounded Gorbachev&#x27;s presidential dacha in Foros. By order of Soviet Air Defense Chief of Staff Colonel-General Igor Maltsev, two tractors blocked the runway on which the President&#x27;s aircraft were located: a Tu-134 jet and Mi-8 helicopter.

==== Morning ====
Starting at 6:00am, all of the GKChP documents were broadcast over state radio and television. The KGB immediately issued an arrest list that included newly elected Russian SFSR President Boris Yeltsin, his allies, and the leaders of the umbrella activist group Democratic Russia. The Russian SFSR-controlled Radio Rossii and Televidenie Rossii, plus Ekho Moskvy, the only independent political radio station, were taken off the air. However, the latter station later resumed its broadcasts and became a source of reliable information during the coup. The BBC World Service and Voice of America were also able to provide continuous coverage. Gorbachev and his family heard the news from a BBC bulletin on a small Sony transistor radio that had not been seized. For the next several days, he refused to take food from outside the dacha to avoid being poisoned, and took long outdoor strolls to dispute reports of his ill health.

Under Yanayev&#x27;s orders, units of the Tamanskaya mechanized infantry and Kantemirovskaya armored division rolled into Moscow, along with airborne troops. Around 4,000 soldiers, 350 tanks, 300 armoured personnel carriers and 420 trucks were sent to Moscow. Four Russian SFSR people&#x27;s deputies were detained by the KGB at a Soviet Army base near the capital. However, almost no other arrests were made by the KGB during the coup. Ulysse Gosset and Vladimir Federovski later alleged that the KGB was planning to carry out a much larger wave of arrests two weeks after the coup, after which it would have abolished almost all legislative and local administrative structures under a highly centralized Council of Ministers. Yanayev instructed Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh to make a statement requesting formal diplomatic recognition from foreign governments and the United Nations.

The GKChP conspirators considered detaining Yeltsin upon his return from a visit to Kazakhstan on 17August but failed when Yeltsin redirected his flight from Chkalovsky Air Base northeast of Moscow to Vnukovo Airport southwest of the city. Afterwards, they considered capturing him at his dacha near Moscow. The KGB Alpha Group surrounded his dacha with Spetsnaz, but for undisclosed reasons did not apprehend him. The commanding officer, Viktor Karpukhin, later alleged that he had received an order from Kryuchkov to arrest Yeltsin but disobeyed it, although his account has been questioned. The failure to arrest Yeltsin proved fatal to the plotters&#x27; plans. After the announcement of the coup at 6:30am, Yeltsin began inviting prominent Russian officials to his dacha, including Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, Moscow Deputy Mayor Yury Luzhkov, Colonel-General Konstantin Kobets, RSFSR Prime Minister Ivan Silayev, RSFSR Vice President Alexander Rutskoy, and RSFSR Supreme Soviet Chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov.

Yeltsin initially wanted to remain at the dacha and organize a rival government, but Kobets advised his group to travel to the White House, Russia&#x27;s parliament building, to maintain communications with coup opponents. They arrived and occupied the building at 9:00am. Together with Silayev and Khasbulatov, Yeltsin issued a declaration &quot;To the Citizens of Russia&quot; that condemned the GKChP&#x27;s actions as a reactionary anti-constitutional coup. The military was urged not to take part in the coup, and local authorities were asked to follow laws from the RSFSR President rather than the GKChP. Although he initially avoided the measure to avoid sparking a civil war, Yeltsin also subsequently took command of all Soviet military and security forces in the RSFSR. The joint declaration called for a general strike, with the demand to let Gorbachev address the people. This declaration was distributed around Moscow in the form of flyers, and disseminated nationwide through medium-wave radio and Usenet newsgroups via the RELCOM computer network. &quot;Izvestia&quot; newspaper workers threatened to go on strike unless Yeltsin&#x27;s proclamation was printed in the paper.

The GKChP relied on regional and local soviets, mostly still dominated by the Communist Party, to support the coup by forming emergency committees to repress dissidence. The CPSU Secretariat under Boldin sent coded telegrams to local party committees to assist the coup. Yeltsin&#x27;s authorities later discovered that nearly 70 percent of the committees either backed it or attempted to remain neutral. Within the RSFSR, the oblasts of Samara, Lipetsk, Tambov, Saratov, Orenburg, Irkutsk, and Tomsk and the krai of Altai and Krasnodar all supported the coup and pressured &quot;raikom&quot; to do so as well, while only three oblasts aside from Moscow and Leningrad opposed it. However, some of the soviets faced internal resistance against emergency rule. The Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics of Tatarstan, Kabardino-Balkaria, Checheno-Ingushetia, Buryatia, and North Ossetia all sided with the GKChP. Soviet Armed Forces officers seized control of city halls and government buildings around the country claiming to be in control, as well as television stations in the Baltic states.

The Soviet public was divided on the coup. A poll in the RSFSR by Mnenie on the morning of 19August showed that 23.6 percent of Russians believed the GKChP could improve living standards, while 41.9 percent had no opinion. However, separate polls by Interfax showed that many Russians, including 71 percent of Leningrad residents, feared the return of mass repression. The GKChP enjoyed strong support in the Russian-majority regions of Estonia and Transnistria, while Yeltsin enjoyed strong support in Sverdlovsk and Nizhny Novgorod.

At 10:00am, Rutskoy, Silayev, and Khasbulatov delivered a letter to Lukyanov demanding a medical exam of Gorbachev by the World Health Organization and a meeting between themselves, Yeltsin, Gorbachev, and Yanayev within 24 hours. Rutskoy later visited Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow, spiritual leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, and convinced him to declare support for Yeltsin. Meanwhile, in Leningrad, Military District Commander Viktor Samsonov ordered the formation of an emergency committee for the city, chaired by Leningrad First Secretary Boris Gidaspov, to circumvent Sobchak&#x27;s democratically elected municipal government. Samsonov&#x27;s troops were ultimately blocked by hundreds of thousands of demonstrators supported by the police, which forced Leningrad Television to broadcast a statement by Sobchak. Workers at the Kirov Plant went on strike in support of Yeltsin. Moscow First Secretary Yuri Prokofev attempted a similar maneuver in the capital but was rebuffed when Boris Nikolskii refused to accept the office of Mayor of Moscow. At 11:00am, RSFSR Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev held a press conference for foreign journalists and diplomats, and gained the support of most of the West for Yeltsin.

==== Afternoon and evening ====
That afternoon, Moscow citizens began gathering around the White House, erecting barricades around it. In response, Yanayev declared a state of emergency in Moscow at 4:00pm. He declared at a 5:00pm press conference that Gorbachev was &quot;resting&quot;. He said: &quot;Over these years he has got very tired and needs some time to get his health back.&quot; Yanayev&#x27;s shaking hands led some people to think he was drunk, and his trembling voice and weak posture made his words unconvincing. Victoria E. Bonnell and Gregory Frieden noted that the press conference allowed spontaneous questioning from journalists who openly accused the GKChP of carrying out a coup, as well as the lack of censorship by news crews, who did not hide Yanayev&#x27;s erratic motions the way they had with past leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev, making the coup leaders appear more incompetent to Soviet audiences. Gorbachev&#x27;s security detail managed to construct a makeshift television antenna so he and his family could watch the press conference. After viewing the conference, Gorbachev expressed confidence that Yeltsin would be able to stop the coup. That night, his family smuggled out a videotape of Gorbachev condemning the coup.

Yanayev and the rest of the State Committee ordered the Cabinet of Ministers to alter the five-year plan of the time to relieve the housing shortage. All city dwellers were each given to combat winter shortages by growing fruits and vegetables. Due to the illness of Valentin Pavlov, the duties of the Soviet head of the government were entrusted to First Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Doguzhiyev.

Meanwhile, the Soviet forces carrying out the coup began to suffer from mass defections to the RSFSR as well as soldiers refusing to obey orders to shoot civilians. Yeltsin asked his followers not to harass the soldiers and offered amnesty for any military servicemen who defected to oppose the coup. Major Evdokimov, chief of staff of a tank battalion of the Tamanskaya Division guarding the White House, declared his loyalty to the leadership of the Russian SFSR. Yeltsin climbed one of the tanks and addressed the crowd. Unexpectedly, this episode was included in the state media&#x27;s evening news. Soviet Armed Forces officers loyal to the GKChP tried to prevent defections by confining soldiers to their barracks, but this only limited the availability of forces to carry out the coup.

===Tuesday 20 August===

At 8:00am, the Soviet General Staff ordered that the Cheget briefcase controlling Soviet nuclear weapons be returned to Moscow. Although Gorbachev discovered that the GKChP&#x27;s actions had cut off communications with the nuclear duty officers, the Cheget was returned to the capital by 2:00pm. However, Soviet Air Force Commander-in-Chief Yevgeny Shaposhnikov opposed the coup and claimed in his memoirs that he and the commanders of the Soviet Navy and the Strategic Rocket Forces told Yazov that they would not follow orders for a nuclear launch. After the coup, Gorbachev refused to admit that he had lost control of the country&#x27;s nuclear weapons.

At noon, Moscow military district commander General Nikolai Kalinin, whom Yanayev appointed military commandant of Moscow, declared a curfew in Moscow from 11:00pm to 5:00am, effective 20August. This was understood as a sign that an attack on the White House was imminent.

The defenders of the White House prepared themselves, most being unarmed. Evdokimov&#x27;s tanks were moved from the White House in the evening. The makeshift White House defense headquarters was headed by General Konstantin Kobets, a Russian SFSR people&#x27;s deputy. Outside, Eduard Shevardnadze, Mstislav Rostropovich, and Yelena Bonner delivered speeches in support of Yeltsin.

In the afternoon, Kryuchkov, Yazov and Pugo finally decided to attack the White House. This decision was supported by other GKChP members (with the exception of Pavlov, who had been sent to his dacha due to drunkenness). Kryuchkov&#x27;s and Yazov&#x27;s deputies, KGB general Gennady Ageyev and Army general Vladislav Achalov, planned the assault, codenamed &quot;Operation Grom&quot; (Thunder), which would gather elements of the Alpha Group and Vympel elite special forces units, supported by paratroopers, Moscow OMON, Internal Troops of the ODON, three tank companies and a helicopter squadron. Alpha Group commander General Viktor Karpukhin and other senior unit officers, together with Airborne deputy commander Gen. Alexander Lebed mingled with the crowds near the White House and assessed the possibility of such an operation. Afterwards, Karpukhin and Vympel commander Colonel Boris Beskov tried to convince Ageyev that the operation would result in bloodshed and should be cancelled. Lebed, with the consent of his superior Pavel Grachev, returned to the White House and secretly informed the defense headquarters that the attack would begin at 2:00am the following morning.

While the events were unfolding in the capital, Estonia&#x27;s Supreme Council declared at 11:03pm the full reinstatement of the independent status of the Republic of Estonia after 51 years.

State-controlled TASS dispatches from 20August emphasize a hardline approach against crime, especially economic crimes and the Russian mafia, which the GKChP blamed on increasing trade with the West. Draft decrees were later discovered which would have allowed military and police patrols to shoot &quot;hooligans,&quot; including pro-democracy demonstrators.

===Wednesday 21 August===
At about 1:00am, not far from the White House, trolleybuses and street cleaning machines were used to barricade a tunnel against arriving Taman Guards infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), commanded by Captain Sergey Surovikin, who years later rose to army general and commander of Russian forces in the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Three men were killed in the ensuing clash: Dmitry Komar, Vladimir Usov, and Ilya Krichevsky; several others were wounded. Komar, a 22-year-old Soviet-Afghan War veteran, was shot and crushed trying to cover a moving IFV&#x27;s observation slit. Usov, a 37-year-old economist, was killed by a stray bullet while coming to Komar&#x27;s aid. The crowd set fire to an IFV and Krichevsky, a 28-year-old architect, was shot dead as the troops pulled back. The three men were posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. According to journalist and democracy campaigner Sergey Parkhomenko, who was in the crowd defending the White House, &quot;those deaths played a crucial role: both sides were so horrified that it brought a halt to everything.&quot; Alpha Group and Vympel did not move to the White House as planned, and Yazov ordered the troops to pull out of Moscow. Reports also surfaced that Gorbachev had been placed under house arrest in Crimea. During the final day of her family&#x27;s exile, Raisa Gorbacheva suffered a minor stroke.

At 8:00am, the troops began to leave Moscow.

Between 8:00 and 9:00am, the GKChP members met in the Defence Ministry and, not knowing what to do, decided to send Kryuchkov, Yazov, Baklanov, Tizyakov, Anatoly Lukyanov, and Deputy CPSU General Secretary Vladimir Ivashko to Crimea to meet Gorbachev, who refused to meet them when they arrived.

At 10:00am, the session of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR opened in the White House, at which President Yeltsin spoke.

At 1:00pm, the Soviet Cabinet of Ministers circulated a statement about its non-involvement in the putsch. At 1:20pm, Kryuchkov, Yazov, Baklanov, Tizyakov, Lukyanov and CPSU Central Committee Deputy General Secretary Vladimir Ivashko left for the airport, getting stuck in a traffic jam created by the Taman Division armored vehicles returning to their base.

At 2:00pm, the CPSU Central Committee Secretariat issued a statement demanding that the GKChP clarify the fate of the head of the Communist Party, Mikhail Gorbachev.

At 2:30pm, Soviet Minister of Internal Affairs Boris Pugo signed the last GKChP ordera cypher telegram to the regional departments of internal affairs with a demand to strengthen the security of television and radio organizations and report on all violations of the GKChP Resolution on information control.

At 4:08pm, the plane with the GKChP delegation landed in Crimea. Around 4:00pm, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, chaired by the heads of the chambers of the union parliament, adopted a resolution in which it declared illegal the removal of the Soviet President from his duties and their transfer to the Vice President, and in this vein demanded that Yanayev cancel the decrees and emergency orders based on them as legally invalid from the moment they were signed.

At 4:52pm, a group of Russian deputies and public figures led by RSFSR Vice President Alexander Rutskoy, as well as Soviet Security Council members Yevgeny Primakov and Vadim Bakatin, flew to Gorbachev&#x27;s dacha in Foros. They were accompanied by 36 officers of the RSFSR Ministry of Internal Affairs armed with machine guns, under the command of RSFSR Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Andrei Dunaev.

Eight minutes later, at 5:00pm, the GKChP delegation arrived at the presidential dacha. President Gorbachev refused to receive it and demanded that communication to the outside world be restored. At the same time, Yanayev signed a decree dissolving the State Emergency Committee and declaring all of its decisions invalid.

At 7:16pm, the plane of the Russian delegation led by Rutskoy landed in Crimea.

At 8:00pm, the Soviet General Prosecutor&#x27;s Office initiated a criminal case into the attempted coup.

At 8:10pm, Rutskoy and his delegation went to see Gorbachev. According to eyewitnesses, the meeting was cordial and joyful, allowing them to momentarily forget divisions between Soviet and Russian authorities.

From 9:40 to 10:10pm, Gorbachev received Lukyanov and Ivashko in the presence of Rutskoy and Primakov, accusing the USSR Supreme Soviet Speaker of treason, and the party deputy of inaction during the putsch.

Around 10:00pm, RSFSR Prosecutor General Valentin Stepankov signed an arrest warrant for the Emergency Committee members.

That day, the Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia declared its sovereignty officially completed with a law passed by its deputies, confirming the independence restoration act of 4May as an official act. In Estonia, just a day after the restitution of the country&#x27;s full independence, the Tallinn TV Tower was taken over by Soviet Russian airborne troops. But while television broadcasts were cut for a time, the radio signal was kept on the air after a handful of Estonian Defence League (the unified paramilitary forces of Estonia) members barricaded themselves in the tower&#x27;s broadcasting studio. That evening, as news from Moscow about the coup&#x27;s failure reached Tallinn, the Russian paratroopers left the TV tower and the Estonian capital.

===Thursday 22 August===

At one minute past midnight, Gorbachev, his family and assistants flew to Moscow on Rutskoy&#x27;s plane. The GKChP members were sent back on a different plane; only Kryuchkov flew in the presidential plane, under police custody (according to Rutskoy, &quot;they [would] definitely not be shot down with him on board&quot;). Upon arrival, Kryuchkov, Yazov and Tizyakov were arrested on the airfield, which was illegal under Soviet law as officials representing the central government could only be arrested and tried under Soviet law, which prevailed over the laws of the constituent republics.

At 2:00am, when Gorbachev arrived at Moscow&#x27;s Vnukovo Airport, television showed live footage of him walking down the airstairs wearing a knitted sweater. Later, he would be criticized for not going to the White House, but to rest at his dacha.

At 6:00am, Soviet Vice President Yanayev was arrested in his office.

Boris Pugo and his wife died by suicide after being contacted by the RSFSR for a meeting over his role in the coup attempt.

=== Friday 23 August ===
Pavlov, Starodubtsev, Baklanov, Boldin, and Shenin would all be taken into custody within the next 48 hours.

==Aftermath==

Since several heads of the regional executive committees supported the GKChP, on 21August 1991 the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR adopted Decision No. 1626-1, which authorized Russian President Boris Yeltsin to appoint heads of regional administrations, although the Constitution of the Russian SFSR did not empower the president with such authority. The Russian Supreme Soviet passed another decision the following day declaring the old imperial colors Russia&#x27;s national flag; it replaced the Russian SFSR flag two months later.

On the night of 24August, the Felix Dzerzhinsky statue in front of the KGB building at Dzerzhinskiy Square (Lubianka) was dismantled, while thousands of Moscow citizens took part in the funeral of Dmitry Komar, Vladimir Usov and Ilya Krichevsky, the three citizens who had died in the tunnel incident. Gorbachev posthumously awarded them with the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin asked their relatives to forgive him for not being able to prevent their deaths.

===End of the CPSU===
Gorbachev initially tried to defend the CPSU, proclaiming at a 22August press conference that it still represented a &quot;progressive force&quot; despite its leaders&#x27; participation in the coup. Gorbachev resigned as CPSU General Secretary on24August. Vladimir Ivashko replaced him as acting General Secretary, but resigned on 29August when the Supreme Soviet of the USSR suspended the activities of the party throughout the Soviet Union.

In a decree, Yeltsin ordered the transfer of the CPSU archives to the state archive authorities, and nationalized all CPSU assets in the Russian SFSR (these included not only party committee headquarters but also assets such as educational institutions and hotels). The party&#x27;s Central Committee headquarters were handed over to the Government of Moscow. On 6November, Yeltsin issued a decree banning the party in Russia.

===The Dissolution of the Soviet Union===
On 24August 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev created the so-called &quot;Committee for the Operational Management of the Soviet Economy&quot; (Комитет по оперативному управлению народным хозяйством СССР), to replace the USSR Cabinet of Ministers headed by Valentin Pavlov, a GKChP member. Russian Prime Minister Ivan Silayev headed the committee.

That same day, Ukraine&#x27;s Verkhovna Rada adopted the Act of Independence of Ukraine and called for a referendum on support of the Act of Independence.

On 25August, the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR announced its Declaration of Sovereignty as a constitutional law.

On 28August, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR dismissed Prime Minister Pavlov and entrusted the functions of the Soviet government to the Committee for the Operational Management of the Soviet Economy. The next day, Supreme Soviet Chairman Anatoly Lukyanov was arrested.

On 5September, the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of the Soviet Union adopted Soviet Law No. 2392-1 &quot;On the Authorities of the Soviet Union in the Transitional Period&quot;, replacing itself with the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Two new legislative chambersthe Soviet of the Union (Совет Союза) and the Soviet of Republics (Совет Республик)replaced the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities (both elected by the USSR Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies). The Soviet of the Union was to be formed by the popularly elected USSR people&#x27;s deputies and would only consider issues concerning civil rights and freedoms and other issues which did not fall under the jurisdiction of the Soviet of Republics. Its decisions would have to be reviewed by the Soviet of Republics. The Soviet of Republics was to include 20 deputies from each union republic and one deputy to represent each autonomous region of each union republic (both Soviet people&#x27;s deputies and republics&#x27; people&#x27;s deputies) delegated by the legislatures of the union republic. Russia, with 52 delegates, was an exception. However, the delegation of each union republic was to have only one vote in the Soviet of Republics. The laws were to be first adopted by the Soviet of the Union and then by the Soviet of Republics, which would set procedures for the central government, approve the appointment of central ministers and consider inter-republic agreements.

Also created was the Soviet State Council (Государственный совет СССР), which included the Soviet President and the presidents of union republics. The &quot;Committee for the Operational Management of the Soviet Economy&quot; was replaced by the USSR Inter-republic Economic Committee (Межреспубликанский экономический комитет СССР), also headed by Ivan Silayev.

On 27August, the Supreme Soviet of Moldova declared the independence of Moldova from the Soviet Union. The Supreme Soviets of Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan did the same on 30 and 31August, respectively. On 6September, the newly created Soviet State Council recognized the independence of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Estonia had declared re-independence on 20August, Latvia the following day, while Lithuania had already done so on 11March the previous year. On 9September, the Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan declared the independence of Tajikistan from the Soviet Union. Also in September, over 99% percent of voters in Armenia voted for independence of the republic in a referendum. The immediate aftermath of the vote was the Armenian Supreme Soviet&#x27;s declaration of independence on 21September. On27 October, the Supreme Soviet of Turkmenistan declared the independence of Turkmenistan from the Soviet Union. On 1December, Ukraine held a referendum, in which more than 90% of residents supported the Act of Independence of Ukraine.

By November, the only Soviet Republics that had not declared independence were Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. That same month, seven republics (Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan) agreed to a new union treaty that would form a confederation called the Union of Sovereign States. However, this confederation never materialized.

On 8December, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevichthe leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus (which had adopted the name in August 1991)as well as the prime ministers of the three republics, met in Minsk, Belarus to sign the Belovezha Accords. The Accords declared that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist &quot;as a subject of international law and geopolitical reality.&quot; It repudiated the 1922 union treaty that established the Soviet Union and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in the Union&#x27;s place. On 12December, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR ratified the accords and recalled the Russian deputies from the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Although this has been interpreted as the moment that Russia seceded from the Union, Russia took the position that it was not possible to secede from a state that no longer existed. The lower chamber of the Supreme Soviet, the Council of the Union, was forced to halt its operations, as the departure of the Russian deputies left it without a quorum.

Doubts remained about the legitimacy of the 8December accords, since only three republics took part. Thus, on 21December in Alma-Ata, the Alma-Ata Protocol expanded the CIS to include Armenia, Azerbaijan and the five republics of Central Asia. They also pre-emptively accepted Gorbachev&#x27;s resignation. With 11 of the 12 remaining republics (all except Georgia) having agreed that the Union no longer existed, Gorbachev bowed to the inevitable and said he would resign as soon as the CIS became a reality (Georgia joined the CIS in 1993, only to withdraw in 2008 after its war with Russia; the three Baltic states were never a part of the commonwealth, instead joining both the European Union and NATO in 2004.)

On 24December 1991, the Russian SFSRnow renamed the Russian Federationwith the concurrence of the other republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States, informed the United Nations that it would inherit the Soviet Union&#x27;s membership in the UNincluding the Soviet Union&#x27;s permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. No member state of the UN formally objected to this step. The legitimacy of this act has been questioned by some legal scholars as the Soviet Union itself was not constitutionally succeeded by the Russian Federation, but merely dissolved. Others argued that the international community had already established the precedent of recognizing the Soviet Union as the legal successor of the Russian Empire, and so recognizing the Russian Federation as the Soviet Union&#x27;s successor state was valid.

On 25December, Gorbachev announced his resignation as President of the Soviet Union. The red hammer and sickle flag of the Soviet Union was lowered from the Senate building in the Kremlin and replaced with the tricolour flag of Russia. The next day, 26 December, the Soviet of Republics, the upper chamber of the Supreme Soviet, formally voted the Soviet Union out of existence (the lower chamber, the Council of the Union, had been left without a quorum after the Russian deputies withdrew), thus ending the life of the world&#x27;s first and oldest socialist state. All former Soviet embassies became Russian embassies, and Russia received all nuclear weapons located in other former republics by 1996. A constitutional crisis in late 1993 escalated into violence, and the new Russian constitution that came into force at the end of the year abolished the last vestiges of the Soviet political system.

===Beginning of radical economic reforms in Russia===

On 1November 1991, the RSFSR Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies issued Decision No. 1831-1 &quot;On the Legal Support of the Economic Reform&quot; whereby the Russian president (Boris Yeltsin) was granted the right to issue decrees required for economic reform even if they contravened existing laws. Such decrees entered into force if they were not repealed within 7 days by the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR or its Presidium. Five days later, Boris Yeltsin, in addition to his duties as president, assumed those of the prime minister. Yegor Gaidar became deputy prime minister and simultaneously economic and finance minister. On 15November 1991, Boris Yeltsin issued Decree No. 213 &quot;On the Liberalization of Foreign Economic Activity on the Territory of the RSFSR&quot;, whereby all Russian companies were allowed to import and export goods and acquire foreign currency (all foreign trade had previously been tightly controlled by the state). Following the issuance of Decree No. 213, on 3 December 1991 Boris Yeltsin issued Decree No. 297 &quot;On the Measures to Liberalize Prices&quot;, whereby from 2January 1992, most previously existing price controls were abolished.

=== Trial of GKChP members ===
The GKChP members and their accomplices were charged with treason in the form of a conspiracy aimed at capturing power. However, by January 1993, they had all been released from custody pending trial. The trial in the Military Chamber of the Russian Supreme Court began on 14 April 1993. On 23February 1994, the State Duma declared amnesty for all GKChP members and their accomplices, along with the participants of the October 1993 crisis. They all accepted the amnesty, except for General Varennikov, who demanded the continuation of the trial and who was finally acquitted on 11August 1994. The Russian Procuracy also wanted to charge former Deputy Defense Minister Vladislav Achalov, but the Russian Supreme Soviet refused to lift his immunity. Additionally, the Procuracy refrained from charging numerous other individuals accused of complicity in the coup, including the Army Chief of Staff.

===Commemoration of the civilians killed===

Thousands of people attended the funeral of Dmitry Komar, Ilya Krichevsky, and Vladimir Usov on 24August 1991. Gorbachev posthumously made the three Heroes of the Soviet Union for their bravery in &quot;blocking the way to those who wanted to strangle democracy.&quot;.

===Parliamentary commission===
In 1991, a parliamentary commission tasked with investigating causes for the attempted coup was established under Lev Ponomaryov, but was dissolved in 1992 at Ruslan Khasbulatov&#x27;s insistence.

===Mysterious deaths of the participants of the coup===

On the 24th of August 1991, Sergey Akhromeyev was found dead in his office, serving as the Advisor to the President of USSR.

On the 26th of August, Nikolay Kruchina was found dead near his residence in the morning, having jumped from the window of his apartment a few hours prior. He served as the Managing Director of the Central Committee of the CPSU. His predecessor Georgiy Pavlov followed the same fate on the 6th of October of the same year.

On the 17th of October, former Deputy Head of the International Department of the Central Committee of the CPSU Dmitriy Lisovolik was found dead, having also jumped from the window of his apartment.

Said deaths have faced extensive scrutiny by historians and contemporaries, who noted the similarities with which the figurants ended their lives.

==International reactions==
===Western Bloc and NATO countries===

*: Prime Minister of Australia Bob Hawke said that &quot;The developments in the Soviet Union ... raise the question as to whether the purpose is to reverse the political and economic reforms which have been taking place. Australia does not want to see repression, persecution or vindictive actions against Gorbachev or those associated with him.&quot;
*: Several government members quickly reacted to the coup; Prime Minister Brian Mulroney huddled with top advisers over the toppling of Mikhail Gorbachev, but officials said the Prime Minister would likely react cautiously to the stunning development. Mulroney condemned the coup and suspended food aid and other assistance to the Soviet Union. External Affairs Minister Barbara McDougall suggested on 20August 1991 that &quot;Canada could work with any Soviet junta that promises to carry on Gorbachev&#x27;s legacy&quot;. Lloyd Axworthy and Liberal Leader Jean Chretien said Canada must join with other Western governments to back Russian President Boris Yeltsin, former Soviet Foreign Minister and Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and others fighting for Soviet democracy.&quot; McDougall met with the chargé d&#x27;affaires of the Soviet embassy, Vasily Sredin. As part of the NORAD defense network, the government acknowledged that any US-Soviet nuclear confrontation would directly impact Canada as well. Canadian leaders believed both the US and Canada would be treated as a single set of targets.
*: Israeli officials said they hoped Gorbachev&#x27;s attempted removal would not derail the 1991 Israeli-Palestinian peace conference in Madrid (co-sponsored by the US and USSR) or slow Soviet Jewish immigration. The quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, which coordinated the massive flow of Jews arriving from the Soviet Union, called an emergency meeting to assess how the coup would affect Jewish immigration. &quot;We are closely following what is happening in the Soviet Union with concern,&quot; Foreign Minister David Levy said. &quot;One might say that this is an internal issue of the Soviet Union, but in the Soviet Union ... everything internal has an influence for the entire world.&quot; The Soviet Union restored ties with Israel on 26December 1991.
*: Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu ordered the Foreign Ministry to analyze developments. Kaifu himself said that it was highly likely that the coup was unconstitutional. Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto said, &quot;I strongly hope that the leadership change will not influence the positive policies of Perestroika and new-thinking diplomacy.&quot; In addition, Japanese aid and technical loans to the Soviet Union were frozen. Japan left open the question of the coup&#x27;s legitimacy; government spokesman Taizo Watanabe said that &quot;[the Soviet government has] the right to decide whether it is constitutional or unconstitutional. Japan notably differed from western states by not announcing an outright condemnation of the coup. &quot;
*: President Roh Tae-woo welcomed the coup&#x27;s collapse as a symbolic victory for the Soviet people. He said &quot;It was a triumph of the courage and resolve of the Soviet citizens towards freedom and democracy.&quot;
*: Prime Minister John Major met with his cabinet on 19August to deal with the crisis and said &quot;There seems little doubt that President Gorbachev has been removed from power by an unconstitutional seizure of power. There are constitutional ways of removing the president of the Soviet Union; they have not been used. I believe that the whole world has a very serious stake in the events currently taking place in the Soviet Union. The reform process there is of vital importance to the world and of most vital importance of course to the Soviet people themselves and I hope that is fully clear. There is a great deal of information we don&#x27;t yet have, but I would like to make clear above all that we would expect the Soviet Union to respect and honor all the commitments that President Gorbachev has made on its behalf.&quot; The British Government froze $80 million in economic aid to Moscow, while the European Community scheduled an emergency meeting to suspend a $1.5 billion aid program. In a 1991 interview, Major said he thought that &quot;there are many reasons why [the coup] failed and a great deal of time and trouble will be spent on analysing that later. There were, I think, a number of things that were significant. I don&#x27;t think it was terribly well-handled from the point of view of those organising the coup. I think the enormous and unanimous condemnation of the rest of the world publicly of the coup was of immense encouragement to the people resisting it. That is not just my view; that is the view that has been expressed to me by Mr. Shevardnadze, Mr. Yakovlev, President Yeltsin and many others as well to whom I have spoken to the last 48 hours. The moral pressure from the West and the fact that we were prepared to state unequivocally that the coup was illegal and that we wanted the legal government restored, was of immense help in the Soviet Union. I think that did play a part.&quot;
*: During his vacation in Walker&#x27;s Point Estate in Kennebunkport, Maine, U.S. President George H. W. Bush made a blunt demand for Gorbachev&#x27;s restoration to power and said the United States did not accept the legitimacy of the self-proclaimed new Soviet government. Bush rushed to the White House from his vacation home, receiving a letter from Kozyrev aboard Air Force One. He then issued a strongly-worded statement that followed a day of consultations with other Western alliance leaders amid a concerted effort to squeeze the new Soviet leadership by freezing economic aid programs. Bush decried the coup as a &quot;misguided and illegitimate effort&quot; that &quot;bypasses both Soviet law and the will of the Soviet peoples.&quot; He called the overthrow &quot;very disturbing&quot; and put a hold on U.S. aid to the Soviet Union until the coup was ended. The Bush statement, drafted after a series of meetings with top aides, was much more forceful than the President&#x27;s initial reaction that morning in Maine. It was in keeping with a Western effort to apply both diplomatic and economic pressure on the Soviet officials seeking to gain control of the country. On 2September, the United States re-recognized the independence of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania when Bush delivered the press conference in Kennebunkport. Secretary of State James Baker issued a statement warning &quot;The whole world is watching. Legitimacy in 1991 flows not from the barrel of a gun but from the will of the people. History cannot be reversed. Sooner or later your effort will fail.&quot; The coup also led several members of Congress such as Sam Nunn, Les Aspin, and Richard Lugar to become concerned about the security of Soviet weapons of mass destruction and the potential for nuclear proliferation in existing unstable conditions. Despite public opposition to further aid to the Soviet Union and ambivalence from the Bush administration, they oversaw the ratification of the Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1991, authorizing the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and providing funding to post-Soviet states for the decommissioning of WMD stockpiles. Former President Ronald Reagan said:

*Meanwhile, CPUSA Chairman Gus Hall supported the coup, causing division within an already shrinking party. The CPSU had broken ties with the CPUSA in 1989 over the latter&#x27;s condemnation of Perestroika.
*: Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said the process of change in the Soviet Union could not be reversed. In a statement, he said &quot;So much has happened and so many people have been involved in the changes in Soviet Union that I cannot see a total reversal.&quot;
*: President François Mitterrand called on the new Soviet rulers to guarantee the &quot;life and liberty&quot; of Gorbachev and Yeltsin, who was &quot;Gorbachev&#x27;s rival in the changing Soviet Union.&quot; Mitterrand added that &quot;France attaches a high price to the life and liberty of Messrs. Gorbachev and Yeltsin being guaranteed by the new Moscow leaders. These will be judged by their acts, especially on the fashion in which the two high personalities in question will be treated.&quot; After the coup ended, Mitterrand was criticized for his hesitant reaction; this may have helped right wing opposition parties win the 1993 French legislative election. 
*: Chancellor Helmut Kohl cut his Austrian vacation short and returned to Bonn for an emergency meeting. He said he was sure Moscow would withdraw its remaining 272,000 troops from the former East Germany on schedule. Björn Engholm, leader of Germany&#x27;s opposition Social Democratic Party, urged member states of the European Community &quot;to speak with one voice&quot; on the situation and said, &quot;the West should not exclude the possibility of imposing economic and political sanctions on the Soviet Union to avoid a jolt to the right, in Moscow.&quot;
*: Greece described the situation in the Soviet Union as &quot;alarming&quot;. The Greek left was divided- the Alliance of the Left and former Socialist Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou issued statements condemning the coup. However, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Greece condemned Gorbachev for dismantling the Soviet State and reestablishing Capitalism.
*: Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti released a statement saying, &quot;I&#x27;m surprised, embittered and worried. We all know the difficulties that Gorbachev encountered. But I don&#x27;t know how a new president, who, at least for now, doesn&#x27;t have (Gorbachev&#x27;s) prestige and international connections, can overcome the obstacles.&quot; Achille Occhetto, head of the Democratic Party of the Left, the direct heir of the Italian Communist Party, called the ouster of Gorbachev &quot;a most dramatic event of world proportions (which) will have immense repercussions on international life. I am personally and strongly struck, not only for the incalculable burden of this event, but also for the fate of comrade Gorbachev.&quot;

===Communist states===

Many but not all of states still officially Marxist–Leninist (not former Warsaw Pact members that had begun transitioning to a multi-party system) had supported the coup, while others left ambivalent or unofficial support and reversed their position when the coup failed.
*: The failure of the coup resulted in the removal of Soviet political and military officers that favored continued aid to the People&#x27;s Democratic Party government in Afghanistan. At the time, the Afghan regime was still completely dependent on the Soviet Union for its survival in the ongoing Afghan Civil War. The last Soviet military assistance arrived in October, with all Russian aid being halted by Boris Yeltsin in January 1992. Yeltsin hoped to repatriate Soviet prisoners of war still being held by the Mujahideen and was not interested in protecting a &#x27;Soviet Legacy&#x27;. In the aftermath of the coup, Mohammad Najibullah came to resent the Soviets for abandoning him, writing to former Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to be president, you talked me into it, insisted on it, and promised support. Now you are throwing me and the Republic of Afghanistan to its fate.&quot; In the winter of 1992, newly independent Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan provided food aid to Mohammad Najibullah&#x27;s of their own accord in an attempt to save the regime, also establishing contacts with the Mujahideen. The end of Soviet weapons deliveries caused the defection of militia leader Abdul Rashid Dostum from Mohammad Najibullah to Ahmad Shah Massoud, spelling the end of the DRA in April 1992.
*: During the coup, Communist Party of Labour of Albania leader Ramiz Alia was still in power, having won the 1991 Albanian parliamentary election. Encouraged by the coup&#x27;s unraveling, three opposition parties demanded expedited reforms. The 1992 Albanian parliamentary election resulted in a crushing defeat for the now-democratic Socialist Party of Albania, leading to Alia&#x27;s resignation as president in favor of Sali Berisha.
*: In December 1991, the ruling MPLA, in its party congress changed its ideology from Marxism–Leninism to Social Democracy and committed to multi-party democracy. Angola–Russia relations became less relevant to both countries after the coup. Angola&#x27;s ability to enforce its rule on some of its territories diminished due to the end of Soviet weapons deliveries and departures of Cuban personnel.
*: The Chinese government appeared to tacitly support the coup when it issued a statement saying the move was an internal affair of the Soviet Union and when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) released no immediate comment. Confidential Chinese documents have indicated that China&#x27;s hardline leaders strongly disapproved of Gorbachev&#x27;s program of political liberalization, blaming him for &quot;the loss of Eastern Europe to capitalism.&quot; Western scholarship has alleged that Beijing had foreknowledge of the planned coup. This hypothesis is supported by two events: firstly, General Chi Haotian&#x27;s Moscow visit between August5 and August12 to see GKChP member Dmitry Yazov, and secondly, the rapid and mostly positive coverage of the coup in Chinese media, which ignored the activities of Boris Yeltsin. When the coup began, top CCP leaders had gathered to celebrate paramount leader Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s birthday. Upon hearing the news, CCP elder Bo Yibo cursed Gorbachev. Deng then said &quot;The Soviet coup is a good thing but we must not visibly be pleased but only delighted at the bottom of our hearts.&quot; China pronounced a policy of non-interference but hoped &#x27;stability&#x27; (i.e. a restoration of Communist rule) would return to the Soviet Union. Behind closed doors, the Chinese Politburo agreed the coup should be recognized as a &#x27;Marxist&#x27; act and that Sino-Soviet relations should be strengthened. However, Deng also encouraged CCP General Secretary Jiang Zemin to be cautious because the coup could fail. The GKChP was also interested in resolving the Sino-Soviet split and improving diplomatic relations, dispatching Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Belonogov to Beijing to request full recognition and support. Deng met with Belonogov and asked &quot;what do you plan to do with Gorbachev&quot; to measure the probability of the coup&#x27;s success. After hesitating for a day, China was moments away from an official declaration of support for the GKChP when news of its end arrived. After the coup failed, Gorbachev suspended exchanges with China; allegedly the coup plotters attempted to flee to China, but this was flatly denied by both governments. Several Chinese people said that a key difference between the Soviet coup leaders&#x27; failed attempts to use tanks to crush dissent in Moscow and the hardline Chinese leaders&#x27; successful use of tank-led People&#x27;s Liberation Army forces during the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre was that the Soviet people had a powerful leader like Russian President Boris Yeltsin to rally around, whereas the Chinese protesters did not. The Soviet coup collapsed in three days without any major violence by the Soviet Army against civilians in June 1989, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army killed thousands of people to crush the democracy movement.
*: Congo was already moving away from Marxism–Leninism and had organized a democratic conference in June. All references to Communism were removed from the Congolese Constitution in April 1992, yet former Soviet protégé Denis Sassou Nguesso would later regain power and rule Congo through to the present day.
*: On August20, the Cuban Government issued a statement insisting on its neutrality, saying that the conflict was &quot;not Cuba&#x27;s to judge&quot;. In the same statement, Cuba also criticized the West for inciting divisions within the Soviet Union. A Western diplomat alleged that in private, Cuba&#x27;s officials hoped the coup would succeed because the plotters would continue the special Soviet relationship with their country. In September 1991, three-quarters of Cuba&#x27;s consumer goods came from the USSR, underlining the importance of Soviet events to Cuba&#x27;s leaders. As the Soviet coup unfolded, Cuban officials did not believe its leaders would prevail. While Gorbachev was in power, Fidel Castro never agreed with Perestroika and in July 1991 had reiterated his position that there would be no changes in Cuba, saying &quot;In this revolution there will be no changes of name or ideas.&quot; The end of Soviet assistance sparked the Special Period crisis that would last ten years.
*: As the coup began, newspapers published documents from the GKChP without comment or statements of support. Privately, the regime instructed its officials to support the coup to &quot;defend Socialist achievements&quot;. North Korean diplomats were present in Moscow and kept informal contacts with Russians as events unfolded, including soldiers on the ground. By the end of the first day, North Korea&#x27;s embassy in Moscow reported to Pyongyang that the coup would not succeed. At the time, there were changing attitudes in the north toward South Korea and a brief shootout at the DMZ border. After the coup&#x27;s failure, Vice President Pak Song-chol said &quot;The invincible might of our own style of socialism is being highly demonstrated,&quot; and the &quot;North is basically stable&quot; in a reference to Juche. Pyongyang would later blame Perestroika for the fall of the USSR, calling &quot;Gorbachev&#x27;s wrong anti-socialist policy&quot; a &quot;revisionist&quot; one. The end of Soviet assistance was a direct cause of the Arduous March that began in 1994. 
*: The coup came at a time when promised Soviet aid was being slowed and later halted. Vietnamese Communists decided to not embrace a multi-party system in Vietnam due to the experience of Perestroika. An unnamed official said that &quot;Vietnam would probably not feel sorry to see [the end of the Soviet president’s career] because Gorbachev has made many mistakes... too many compromises with the West. He has also made the position and the role of the Soviet Union in the world weaker.&quot; The official also said that Vietnam would benefit from a return to Communist rule in the Soviet Union. &quot;These changes would also affect positively Vietnam’s economy because the West would carry out a hard policy towards the Soviet Union, then the latter would look for trade relations with such countries as Vietnam and China.&quot; After the coup, top Communist Party official Thai Ninh was asked by foreign press if Vietnam felt betrayed by Gorbachev and Yeltsin. He answered, &quot;It&#x27;s better to let the Soviet people decide that&quot;. The failed coup prompted Vietnam to normalize relations with China in November, ending the Sino-Vietnamese conflicts of the 1980s. In a major political victory for China, Vietnam recognized the State of Cambodia (SOC). Increasingly, Beijing and Hanoi felt an ideological affinity with one another and a mutual desire to resist American-led Peaceful Evolution. Vietnam would look to ASEAN for new trading partners in the aftermath of the Soviet dissolution.
*: The Coup was a profound event for all of Yugoslavia, United Press International reported reactions from ordinary Yugoslavs including economist Dragan Radic who said &quot;Gorbachev has done a lot for world peace and helped replace hard-line communist regimes in the past few years.Yet, the West failed to support Gorbachev financially and economically and he was forced to step down because he could not feed the Soviet people.&quot; Officially, President Slobodan Milošević, in charge of Serbia, was silent. Unofficially, there were numerous interactions between Yugoslavia and the USSR leading up to the start of the coup. The violent breakup of Yugoslavia had begun the previous year. Political actors in both nations realized the similarities of their political situations. On the anti-communist side, separatists in the USSR were building relations with Yugoslavia&#x27;s breakaway republics. At the end of July, Lithuania recognized Slovenia and in August, Georgia recognized Slovenia and Croatia&#x27;s independence. On the side of hardliners, both nations had factions embracing a red-brown coalition between traditional communists and ultranationalists to maintain the territorial integrity of both the USSR and Yugoslavia. In the weeks leading up to the coup, conservatives in the USSR were using the precedence of Yugoslavia as an excuse to violently suppress uprisings of non-Russians. In fact, Yugoslavia may have been a major cause for the Gang of Eight to believe their actions were necessary to prevent the USSR&#x27;s collapse. When Yugoslav Prime Minister Ante Marković visited Moscow in early August, Gorbachev pointed out the parallels between problems looming in both countries. Croatian President Franjo Tuđman claimed in October that &quot;Communist Yugoslav Generals&quot; had openly supported the coup and that they had received instructions from Moscow. The victory of the democrats in the USSR had major implications for Yugoslavia. Yeltsin knew that Milošević had secretly supported Soviet conservatives and relations between the two were dismal. By the time the USSR collapsed, the problem of Yugoslavia had become a part of the Russian political landscape. Yeltsin and liberal elites would publicly take an even-handed approach and encourage international cooperation to solve the crisis. In contrast, post-Soviet conservatives looked to create advantages for Russia by supporting Orthodox Serbs in their struggle to control the remaining Yugoslav nations. Sociology Professor Veljko Vujačić assessed the similarities and differences between the breakup of Yugoslavia and dissolution of the Soviet Union. Both nations were multi-national Marxist–Leninist states with Slavic rulers facing major secessionist movements. In Serbia, patriotism was linked with statehood. Milošević told his nationalist followers that every generation of Serbs has had their own &quot;Kosovo battle&quot;, dating back to the 14th century. In contrast, Russian nationalists including Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn drew a distinction between &#x27;patriotic&#x27; Russian people and the &#x27;oppressive&#x27; Russian state. Boris Yeltsin and his followers saw the USSR as an oppressor of Russia, thereby accelerating the mostly peaceful division of the former Soviet Union. On 27April 1992, Yugoslavia formally disintegrated and with it vanished any mention of Marxist–Leninism in its Serbian and Montenegrin successor state.

=== Former Warsaw Pact members ===
The Warsaw Pact had dissolved in July, and its members had rapidly changed, with Marxist–Leninist pro-Soviet governments deposed or elected out of office. As a result, all criticized or expressed weary sentiments about events in Moscow. Some former Warsaw Pact members deployed armed forces to strategically important areas.
* : President Zhelyu Zhelev stated that &quot;Such anti-democratic methods can never lead to anything good neither for the Soviet Union, nor for Eastern Europe, nor for the democratic developments in the world.&quot;
* Czechoslovakia: President Václav Havel warned that his nation could potentially face a &quot;wave of refugees&quot; crossing its border with the Ukrainian SSR. However, Havel said &quot;It is not possible to reverse the changes that have already happened in the Soviet Union. We believe democracy will eventually prevail in the Soviet Union.&quot; Interior Ministry spokesman Martin Fendrych said an unspecified number of additional troops had been moved to reinforce the Czechoslovak border with the Soviet Union.
* : Deputy Speaker of Parliament Mátyás Szűrös said, &quot;Undoubtedly, the Soviet economy has collapsed but this has not been the result of Gorbachev&#x27;s policy but of the paralyzing influence of conservatives,&quot; adding, &quot;Suddenly, the likelihood of a civil war in the Soviet Union has increased.&quot;
* : A statement released by the President Lech Wałęsa, whose Solidarity union helped prompt the collapse of communist regimes in Eastern Europe, appealed for calm. &quot;May unity and responsibility for our state gain the upper hand.&quot; The statement, read on Polish radio by spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski, continued, &quot;The situation in the USSR is significant for our country. It can affect our bilateral relations. We want them to be friendly.&quot; But Wałęsa emphasized that Poland would keep its hard-won sovereignty while pursuing economic and political reforms.
* : Prime Minister Petre Roman said the coup was an attempt to re-establish hardline communism in the most Stalinist manner.

===Other sovereign states===
*: The end of the Salvadoran Civil War with the Communist FMLN was being negotiated. President Alfredo Cristiani voiced concern that the coup could encourage the FMLN to end negotiations, or that Cuba&#x27;s relationship with the Soviet Union would be restored. Cuba had long been a supplier to the FMLN. Ernesto Altschul, Cristiani&#x27;s deputy chief of staff, said, &quot;Obviously, this can affect our situation.&quot; After the coup failed, the Chapultepec Peace Accords were signed in January 1992, ending twelve years of brutal conflict. 
*: As the coup was ongoing, Indian leaders indicated a degree of sympathy for Soviet hardliners. Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao said &quot;Mr. Gorbachev&#x27;s ouster was a warning to people who favored reforms without controls.&quot; Likewise, India&#x27;s ambassador in Moscow remarked that Gorbachev had &quot;brought about the disintegration of the [Communist] party&quot;. Chief Minister of West Bengal and Communist Party of India (Marxist) cofounder Jyoti Basu wholeheartedly endorsed the coup. When the coup failed, India&#x27;s government changed course, celebrating &quot;the reassertion of democratic values and a triumph for the will of the people.&quot; Despite official support for Yeltsin&#x27;s victory, Indian politicians feared that a spill-over effect from the dissolution of the Soviet Union would encourage secessionist movements at home. The loss of an economic partner and ideological friend upset the Rao Administration and India&#x27;s leftist movement, as the Indian National Congress felt it shared some of the CPSU&#x27;s values. The &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote that &quot;India feels orphaned – ideologically, strategically, economically&quot; 
*: Saddam Hussein was a close ally of the Soviet Union until Gorbachev denounced the invasion of Kuwait that preceded the Gulf War, and relations between the two countries had grown tense. One Iraqi spokesman quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency said that &quot;Iraq’s right and steadfastness was one of the main reasons behind the fall [of Gorbachev]... because [Iraq] exposed [his] policy of treason and conspiracy. It is natural that we welcome such change like the states and people who were affected by the policies of the former regime.&quot; In other words, Hussein seemingly took credit for inspiring the coup. This position was echoed by the Jordanian Newspaper &quot;Al Ra&#x27;i&quot;.
*: Government radio quoted leader Muammar Gaddafi praising the coup leaders for their &quot;brave historical action.&quot;
*: President Corazon Aquino expressed &quot;grave concern&quot; saying, &quot;We hope that the progress toward world peace... achieved under the leadership of President Gorbachev will continue to be preserved and enhanced further.&quot;
*: Foreign Minister Pik Botha said, &quot;I very much hope that [Soviet developments] will neither give rise to large-scale turbulence within the Soviet Union itself or more widely in Europe, nor jeopardize the era of hard-won international cooperation upon which the world has embarked.&quot;
*: President Menem visited the Soviet Union before the coup and its subsequent dissolution, continuing the good relations maintained since diplomatic ties were established in 1946. In December 1991, Argentina recognized the Russian Federation as the successor state of the USSR.

===Supranational bodies and organizations===
*: While celebrating Mass in Budapest, Pope John Paul II said in scripted remarks that he hoped the Soviet Union&#x27;s reforms would survive Gorbachev&#x27;s fall. &quot;I particularly appreciated the sincere desire that guided him and the lofty inspiration that animated him in the promotion of human rights and dignity, as well as in his commitment for the well-being of the country and of the international community. May the process initiated by him not fall into decline.&quot; The Pope also prayed for the Soviet Union itself, asking that &quot;our prayers become even more intense to ask God that that great country may be spared further tragedy.&quot;
*: The alliance held an emergency meeting in Brussels condemning the Soviet coup. &quot;If indeed this coup did fail, it will be a great victory for the courageous Soviet people who have tasted freedom and who are not prepared to have it taken away from them,&quot; said United States Secretary of State James A. Baker III. Baker also stated, &quot;[i]t will also, to some extent, be a victory, too, for the international community and for all those governments who reacted strongly to these events.&quot; NATO Secretary-General Manfred Wörner also said, &quot;We should see how the situation in the Soviet Union develops. Our own plans will take into account what happens there.&quot;
*: The Palestinian Liberation Organization was satisfied with the coup. Yasser Abed Rabbo, who was a member of the PLO Executive Committee, said he hoped the putsch &quot;will permit resolution in the best interests of the Palestinians of the problem of Soviet Jews in Israel.&quot;

<text>Jalisco is a state in Western Mexico that is divided into 125 municipalities. According to the 2020 Mexican census, it is the third most populated state with inhabitants and the seventh largest by land area spanning . The largest municipality by population is Zapopan, with 1,476,491 residents (17.68% of the state&#x27;s total), while the smallest is Santa María del Oro with 1,815 residents. The largest municipality by land area is Mezquitic which spans , and the smallest is Techaluta with . The newest is San Ignacio Cerro Gordo, established in 2007 out of Arandas.

Municipalities in Jalisco are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. Their legal framework derives from the state Constitution. Every three years, citizens elect a municipal president (Spanish: &quot;presidente municipal&quot;) by a plurality voting system who heads a concurrently elected municipal council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) responsible for providing all the public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors (&quot;regidores y síndicos&quot;). Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income.

<doc id="734003" wikidata="Q7661495" url="?curid=734003" title="Symphony No. 1 (Brian)">
<text>The Symphony No. 1 in D minor (The Gothic) is a symphony composed by Havergal Brian between 1919 and 1927. At around 110 minutes it is one of the longest symphonies ever composed. Others include Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 3 at 90 to 105 minutes (the only symphony of this length to be regularly performed and recorded), Derek Bourgeois&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No 42: Life, the Universe, and Everything&quot; at 155 minutes, Sorabji&#x27;s Organ Symphony No. 2 at nine hours, and Dimitrie Cuclin&#x27;s unperformed Symphony No. 12 at about six hours. Along with choral symphonies such as Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony or Mahler&#x27;s Eighth Symphony, it is one of a few works attempting to use the musically gigantic to address the spiritual concerns of humanity. Beginning in D minor and closing in E major, the work is an example of progressive tonality.

==History==
===Composition===
The genesis of the work stems from many sources, including a conversation Brian had with Henry Wood about writing a suite that would revive the older instruments that had fallen out of use in the modern symphony orchestra, such as the oboe d&#x27;amore or basset horn. This idea was repudiated by Brian&#x27;s close friend Granville Bantock, but returned when Brian turned to writing symphonies after the end of the First World War. The &quot;Gothic&quot; element refers to the vision of the Gothic age (from about 1150 to 1500) as representing a huge (almost unlimited) expansion in humanity&#x27;s artistic and intellectual development, but particularly manifest in the architecture of the great European cathedrals. The scale of the choral finale, which took several years to write, appears to be an attempt to evoke the scale and detail of this architecture in sound; Brian had to paste blank pages of score together to be able to write the work on gigantic sheets with 54 staves to the page. Brian also seems to have identified with the character of Faust, particularly in attempting to write such affirmative music in the post-war atmosphere when many composers had turned from pre-war giganticism, and the finale bears an apposite quote from Goethe&#x27;s Faust Part Two Act V, which translates as, &quot;The man who ever strives may earn redemption.&quot; Brian dedicated the work to Richard Strauss, who in a letter of acknowledgement described it as &quot;grossartig&quot; (magnificent).

The work (more specifically the first three orchestral movements) was submitted in 1928 as an entry for the 1928 International Columbia Graphophone Competition in memory of Schubert and won second prize in the &#x27;English Zone&#x27; of that contest; in the final international judging in Vienna it was one of a number of works – others were by Czesław Marek, Franz Schmidt and Charles Haubiel – that lost out to the Sixth Symphony of Kurt Atterberg. It was however published in 1932 by the Leipzig-based Cranz &amp; Co. (in an edition beset with printing errors) as &quot;Symphony No. 2&quot; — the number it bore until Brian renumbered his early symphonies in 1967, eliminating the long-defunct &quot;A Fantastic Symphony&quot; of 1907 and inserting the previously-unnumbered &quot;Sinfonia Tragica&quot; of 1948 as the new No. 6. A photographically reduced study score of the Cranz edition was published by United Music Publishers in 1976, though with little effort to correct the copious errors, and still bearing the incorrect No. 2.

==Instrumentation==
The orchestral forces for this symphony are commonly thought to be the largest employed in the symphonic repertoire. In practice, some small reductions can be made without discernible loss (e.g. cutting two of the orchestral trumpets and the doubling to 2nd contrabass trombone).

The off-stage brass and timpani are organised into four &quot;Brass Orchestras&quot;, each consisting of 2 trumpets, 2 horns, 2 tenor trombones, 2 tubas and 3 timpani (one player)

==Form==
The symphony consists of six movements, organised into two parts with each part containing three movements, marked as follows:
:Part One
::I. &quot;Allegro assai&quot; – attacca:
::II. &quot;Lento espressivo e solenne&quot; – attacca:
::III. &quot;Vivace&quot; – attacca:
:Part Two
::IV. Te Deum laudamus. &quot;Allegro moderato&quot;
::V. Judex crederis esse venturus. &quot;Adagio solenne e religioso&quot;
::VI. Te ergo quaesumus. &quot;Moderato e molto sostenuto&quot;

Part one is exclusively orchestral; part two requires the full ensemble, with choral parts set to the words of the Latin religious hymn, the Te Deum. The three movements in Part One play for about forty minutes uninterrupted, and set the stage for the choir-dominated Part Two, which is over an hour in duration and contains a huge range of styles of music, daringly welded together in an attempt to solve the &quot;finale problem&quot; which Brian had set himself. It is written for an extremely large symphony orchestra, four additional brass orchestras, four vocal soloists, four adult choirs, and children&#x27;s choir.

The work begins with a brilliant flourish given by the full orchestra (which in Part One number approximately one hundred players). The first movement appears to feature two extremely contrasted ideas in the style of sonata form, one a vigorous leaping figure in D minor, the other a suave melody first stated on solo violin in the remote key of D-flat major, though the working out of the music involves a process of ongoing development within the exposition, and avoids the expected re-capitulation by reversing the order of musical events, with the return of the first idea effectively starting the coda. The second movement begins with a stately and solemn march, almost as for a funeral cortege, which builds to a grim and powerful conclusion. The third movement starts with an ostinato in the style of Bruckner that gives way to a recurring idea based on the opening leaping figure of the first movement, initially stated on horns. After various developments culminating in a bizarre polytonal passage with a virtuoso xylophone cadenza, the theme is transformed into a climactic march which eventually throws the movement into the home key of D minor, and subsides quietly with the original statement of the music for horns followed by a harp arpeggio and a final chord of D major.

At this point the choirs and soloists strike in unaccompanied with the opening stanza of the &quot;Te Deum&quot;, followed immediately by a fanfare for the enlarged orchestra for Part Two (which is supposed to be about 150-strong, besides the extra 40 or so players comprising the four extra brass orchestras). The eclecticism of Brian&#x27;s music here borrows references as diverse as mediaeval fauxbourdon, Renaissance multiple polyphony on the scale of Tallis&#x27;s &quot;Spem in alium&quot; all the way through to twentieth century tone clusters, polytonality and the use of percussion and brass in a Varèse-like outburst of extreme dissonance. The text is treated episodically with sections for full orchestra and choir frequently alternating with unaccompanied passages for the choir alone. The fourth movement moves away from tonalities centered around D and establishes E as a new tonal centre, which is strenuously challenged in the following movements. The start of the fifth movement involves only the choirs in a fearsomely chromatic un-accompanied polyphonic passage, after which the soprano soloist gently sings a wordless vocalise &quot;like an indefinite intonation&quot;. A fanfare for eight trumpets and a lengthy orchestral passage then introduces each of the four separate brass orchestras paired with one of the four corresponding choirs. A second orchestral development then culminates in a huge climax for the full forces. Thereafter the sixth and final movement continues with even more contrasted and episodic treatment of the text as the music seems to struggle to reach a conclusion. At the final words &quot;non confundar in aeternum&quot; the music violently flares up with two dissonant outbursts answered by the choirs, followed by a despairing orchestral coda, but the work is finally clinched with a murmuring from the choir, which finally confirms the tonality of E major where the words &quot;non confundar in aeternum&quot; are repeated.

==Performances==
Attempts to perform the symphony have frequently met with failure, beginning with the efforts of Hamilton Harty and Eugene Goossens in the depression-affected 1930s and enduring to the current day, usually owing to the extreme logistics of the work. The work was eventually premiered in 1961, and has been followed by a mere handful of performances, often by partly or wholly amateur forces; the 1978 performance for example was an ad hoc amateur orchestra specially assembled for the occasion, in Brian&#x27;s home county of Staffordshire. The first professional performance in 1966 was enthusiastically received by the audience in the Royal Albert Hall when the composer himself, aged 90, was in attendance to take a bow at the work&#x27;s conclusion; this performance was also broadcast live by the BBC.

The alto Shirley Minty sang in the 1966 and 1980 performances, and appears to be the only person who has played a prominent role in more than one performance of the work.

<text>Salif Keïta () (born 25 August 1949) is a Malian singer-songwriter, referred to as the &quot;Golden Voice of Africa&quot;. He is a member of the Keita royal family of Mali.

== Early life ==
Salif Keita was born a traditional prince in the village of Djoliba. He was born to the Keita royal family, who trace their lineage to Sundiata Keita, founder of the Mali Empire. He was cast out by his family and ostracized by the community because of his albinism, a sign of bad luck in Mandinka culture. He decided to pursue music in his teenage years, further distancing him from his family as that was against occupational prohibitions of his noble status.

In 1967, he left Djoliba for Bamako, where he joined the government-sponsored Super Rail Band de Bamako. In 1973, Keita joined the group &quot;Les Ambassadeurs (du Motel de Bamako)&quot;. Keita and Les Ambassadeurs fled political unrest in Mali during the mid-1970s and subsequently changed the group&#x27;s name to &quot;Les Ambassadeurs Internationaux&quot;. The reputation of this band grew internationally in the late-1970s, leading to Keita pursuing a solo career in the following years.

He is the father of Paralympian athlete Nantenin Keita.

== Career ==
Due to political unrest, Keita and his band-mates fled Mali in the mid-1970s. They settled in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, where they struggled financially and often had to rent equipment to perform shows. The band (now named Les Ambassadeurs Internationaux) steadily grew in popularity in the ensuing years. Their 1978 album, &quot;Mandjou&quot;, became an overnight success in West Africa.

In 1976, Sékou Touré, the President of Guinea, made Keita an Officer of Guinea&#x27;s National Order of Merit. The President had been a fan of Keita and the band&#x27;s since they met at an official visit in 1974. Touré had remained a fan and supporter even after they fled Mali. Wanting to reciprocate the honour, Keita composed the track &quot;Mandjou&quot; (featured on the eponymous 1978 album) as a praise song for Touré. However, by the time the song was released, Touré had completely resorted to authoritarian rule and plunged his country into bloodshed and chaos. Keita still performs rearranged versions of &quot;Mandjou&quot;.

Keita moved to Paris in 1984 to reach a larger audience and to pursue a solo career. His music combined traditional West African music styles with influences from both Europe and the Americas.

At that time, Keita was famous in Africa and had a strong fan base among connoisseurs around the world. &quot;Soro&quot; became his international-breakthrough album in 1987. The project was produced by Ibrahima Sylla, a visionary who had already discovered dozens of African stars (and would later become the driving force behind Africando). The arrangements featured roiling rhythms, slightly nasal female backup choirs, and traditional percussion typical of Malian music.

Musical instruments that are commonly featured in Keita&#x27;s work include balafons, djembes, guitars, koras, organs, saxophones, and synthesizers. He performed at the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert in 1988 to call for Nelson Mandela&#x27;s release from prison. In 1990, Keita contributed &quot;Begin the Beguine&quot; to the Cole Porter tribute/AIDS benefit album &quot;Red Hot + Blue&quot;, produced by the Red Hot Organization.

Keita found success in Europe as one of the African stars of world music, but his work was sometimes criticised for the gloss of its production and for the occasional haphazard quality. However, shortly after the turn of the millennium he returned to Bamako in Mali to live and record. His first work after going home, 2002&#x27;s &quot;Moffou&quot;, was hailed as his best album in many years, and Keita was inspired to build a recording studio in Bamako, which he used for his album &quot;M&#x27;Bemba&quot;, released in October 2005.

Guest artists on his albums have included Weather Report founders Joe Zawinul and Wayne Shorter, drummer Paco Sery, guitarist Carlos Santana, and percussionist Bill Summers.

Keita&#x27;s album &quot;La Différence&quot; was produced around the end of 2009. The work is dedicated to the struggle of the world albino community (victims of human sacrifice), for which Keita has been crusading all his life. In one of the album&#x27;s tracks, the singer calls others to understand that &quot;difference&quot; does not mean &quot;bad&quot; and to show love and compassion towards albinos like everyone else: &quot;I am black/ my skin is white/ so I am white and my blood is black [albino]/...I love that because it is a difference that&#x27;s beautiful&quot;, &quot;some of us are beautiful some are not/some are black some are white/all that difference was on purpose...for us to complete each other/let everyone get his love and dignity/the world will be beautiful.&quot;

&quot;La Différence&quot; was recorded between Bamako, Beirut, Paris, and Los Angeles. This unique musical feel is reinforced by soulful pitches in the track &quot;Samigna&quot; emanating from the trumpet of the great Lebanese jazzman Ibrahim Maalouf.

In 2001, Keita&#x27;s song &quot;Tomorrow&quot; was featured in the Will Smith film, &quot;Ali&quot;.

&quot;La Différence&quot; won Keita one of the biggest musical awards of his career: the Best World Music 2010 at the Victoires de la musique.

In 2013, after what he described as &quot;threats&quot; from the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign, he cancelled a performance in Israel. He later published a letter on his Facebook page, stating that he decided to cancel the event because he was scared of &quot;being harmed personally or professionally&quot;, but clarified that he still &quot;love[d] Israel&quot;, slamming BDS as an &quot;extremist group&quot; who used &quot;scare tactics and bullying&quot;.
In November 2018, he announced his retirement from recording at a concert in Fana, Mali. The album &quot;Un Autre Blanc&quot;, which was released at the concert, would be his last. For his farewell recording he invited a rich cast of African singers to help him on one of his songs called &quot;Gnamale.&quot; At the end of the album he thanked God for blessing him and warning people who would misuse his name.

He uses Traditional African instruments such as the djembe, kora and balafon are quite prevalent in his sounded. He has also been able to sing to non-traditional instrumentalization. He has over 15 albums and Keita counts &quot;Un Autre Blanc&quot; as his swan song.

He was to act as legislative body from 2020 till his resignation of 31 July 2023.

In August 2023, Salif Keïta was appointed adviser to the head of the junta by Colonel Assimi Goïta.

== Albinism ==
Born as a descendant of the founder of the Mali Empire, Keïta was born albino. He faced significant challenges in his native land of Mali, particularly among the Mandinka people, where his condition was regarded as an illness. Despite being part of a lineage of musicians and a warrior princess, he was prohibited from pursuing music, resulting in his disownment by his father and expulsion from school. Seeking acceptance, he relocated to Ivory Coast in his youth, where he focused on his passion for music. He ultimately became recognized as a cultural icon. In 1997, he returned to Mali after achieving fame.
