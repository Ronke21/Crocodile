<doc id="752702" wikidata="Q56639924" url="?curid=752702" title="Guttural R">
<text>Guttural R is the phenomenon whereby a rhotic consonant (an &quot;R-like&quot; sound) is produced in the back of the vocal tract (usually with the uvula) rather than in the front portion thereof and thus as a guttural consonant. Speakers of languages with guttural R typically regard guttural and coronal rhotics (throat-back-R and tongue-tip-R) to be alternative pronunciations of the same phoneme (conceptual sound), despite articulatory differences. Similar consonants are found in other parts of the world, but they often have little to no cultural association or interchangeability with coronal rhotics (such as , , and ) and are (perhaps) not rhotics at all.

The guttural realization of a lone rhotic consonant is typical in most of what is now France, French-speaking Belgium, most of Germany, large parts of the Netherlands, Denmark, the southern parts of Sweden and southwestern parts of Norway. It is also frequent in Flanders, eastern Austria, Yiddish (and hence Ashkenazi Hebrew), Luxembourgish, and among all French and some German speakers in Switzerland.

Outside of central Europe, it also occurs as the normal pronunciation of one of two rhotic phonemes (usually replacing an older alveolar trill) in standard European Portuguese and in other parts of Portugal, particularly the Azores, various parts of Brazil, among minorities of other Portuguese-speaking regions, and in parts of Puerto Rico, Cuba and the Dominican Republic.

==Romance languages==

===French===

The r letter in French was historically pronounced as a trill, as was the case in Latin and as is still the case in Italian and Spanish. In Northern France, including Paris, the alveolar trill was gradually replaced with the uvular trill from the end of the 17th century. Molière&#x27;s &quot;Le Bourgeois gentilhomme&quot;, published in 1670, has a professor describe the sound of as an alveolar trill (Act II, Scene IV). It has since evolved, in Paris, to a voiced uvular fricative or approximant .

The alveolar trill was still the common sound of r in Southern France and in Quebec at the beginning of the 20th century, having been gradually replaced since then, due to Parisian influence, by the uvular pronunciation. The alveolar trill is now mostly associated, even in Southern France and in Quebec, with older speakers and rural settings.

The alveolar trill is still used in French singing in classical choral and opera. It is also used in other French speaking countries as well as on French oversea territories such as French Polynesia due to the influence of the indigenous languages which use the trill.

===Portuguese===

Standard versions of Portuguese have two rhotic phonemes, which contrast only between vowels. In older Portuguese, these were the alveolar flap (written ) and the alveolar trill (written ). In other positions, only is written in Modern Portuguese, but it can stand for either sound, depending on the exact position. The distribution of these sounds is mostly the same as in other Iberian languages, i.e.:
* represents a trill when written between vowels; at the beginning of a word; or following , , , or . Examples: &quot;carro&quot;, &quot;rua&quot;, &quot;Israel&quot;, &quot;honrar&quot;. Note that does not represent , but a nasalized vowel.
* represents a flap elsewhere, i.e. following a vowel or following any consonant other than , , or . Examples: &quot;caro&quot;, &quot;quatro&quot;, &quot;quarto&quot;, &quot;mar&quot;.

In the 19th century, the uvular trill penetrated the upper classes in the region of Lisbon in Portugal as the realization of the alveolar trill. By the 20th century, it had replaced the alveolar trill in most of the country&#x27;s urban areas and started to give way to the voiced uvular fricative . Many northern dialects, like Transmontano, Portuese (which is heard in parts of Aveiro), Minhoto, and much of Beirão retain the alveolar trill. In the rural regions, the alveolar trill is still present, but because most of the country&#x27;s population currently lives in or near the cities and owing to the mass media, the guttural is now dominant in Portugal.

A common realization of the word-initial in the Lisbon accent is a voiced uvular fricative trill .

The dialect of the fishermen of Setúbal used the voiced uvular fricative for all instances of &quot;r&quot; – word start, intervocalic, postconsonantal and syllable ending. This same pronunciation is attested in people with rhotacism, in a new developing variety of young people in São Tomean Portuguese, and in non-native speakers of French or German origin.

In Africa, the classical alveolar trill is mostly still dominant, due to separate development from European Portuguese.

In Brazil, the normal pronunciation of is voiceless, either as a voiceless velar fricative , voiceless uvular fricative or a voiceless glottal fricative . In many dialects, this voiceless sound not only replaces all occurrences of the traditional trill, but is also used for all that is &quot;not&quot; followed by a vowel (i.e. when at the end of a syllable, which uses a flap in other dialects). The resulting distribution can be described as:
*A flap only for single and only when it occurs either between vowels or between a preceding consonant (other than , , , or ) and a following vowel. Examples: &quot;caro&quot;, &quot;quatro&quot;.
*A voiceless fricative or everywhere else: when written ; at the beginning of a word; at the end of a word; before a consonant; after , , , or . Examples: &quot;carro&quot;, rua&quot;, &quot;honrar&quot;, &quot;Israel&quot;, &quot;quarto&quot;, &quot;mar.

In the three southernmost states, however, the alveolar trill remains frequent, and the distribution of trill and flap is as in Portugal. Some speakers use a guttural fricative instead of a trill, like the majority of Brazilians, but continue to use the flap before consonants (e.g. in &quot;quarto&quot;) and between vowels (e.g. in caro). Among others, this includes many speakers in the city of São Paulo and some neighboring cities, though an alveolar approximant is also common, not only in the city, but the approximant is the dominant articulation in the São Paulo state, outside the capital, the most populous state in Brazil. The &quot;caipira&quot; dialect has the alveolar approximant in the same position.

In areas where at the end of a word would be a voiceless fricative, the tendency in colloquial speech is to pronounce this sound very lightly, or omit it entirely. Some speakers may omit it entirely in verb infinitives (&quot;amar&quot; &quot;to love&quot;, &quot;comer&quot; &quot;to eat&quot;, &quot;dormir&quot; &quot;to sleep&quot;) but pronounce it lightly in some other words ending in (&quot;mar&quot; &quot;sea&quot;, &quot;mulher&quot; &quot;woman&quot;, &quot;amor&quot; &quot;love&quot;). Speakers in Rio often resist this tendency, pronouncing a strong fricative or at the end of such words. 

The voiceless fricative may be partly or fully voiced if it occurs directly before a voiced sound, especially in its weakest form of , which is normally voiced to . For example, a speaker whose sounds like will often pronounce &quot;surdo&quot; &quot;deaf&quot; as or even , with a short epenthetic vowel that mimics the preceding vowel.

===Spanish===
In most Spanish-speaking territories and regions, guttural or uvular realizations of are considered a speech defect. Generally the single flap , spelled &quot;r&quot; as in &quot;cara&quot;, undergoes no defective pronunciations, but the alveolar trill in &quot;rata&quot; or &quot;perro&quot; is one of the last sounds learned by children and uvularization is likely among individuals who fail to achieve the alveolar articulation. This said, back variants for (, or ) are widespread in rural Puerto Rican Spanish and in the dialect of Ponce, whereas they are heavily stigmatized in the dialect of the capital. To a lesser extent, velar variants of are found in some rural Cuban (Yateras, Guantánamo Province) and Dominican vernaculars (Cibao, eastern rural regions of the country) In the 1937 Parsley Massacre, Dominican troops attacked Haitians in Cibao and the northwestern border. The popular name of the massacre comes from the shibboleth applied to distinguish Dominicans from Haitians: the suspects were ordered to name some parsley (). If they used a French or Haitian Creole pronunciation for or , they would be executed.

In the Basque-speaking areas of Spain, the uvular articulation has a higher prevalence among bilinguals than among Spanish monolinguals.

===Italian===
Guttural realization of is mostly considered a speech defect in Italian (cf. &quot;rotacismo&quot;), but the so-called &quot;r moscia&quot; (&#x27;limp&#x27; or &#x27;lifeless &quot;r&quot;&#x27;, an umbrella term for realizations of considered defective), which is sometimes uvular, is quite common in areas of Northwest Italy, i.e. Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna.

===Occitan===
As with all other Romance languages, the alveolar trill is the original way to pronounce the letter r in Occitan, as it was in Latin. Nowadays, the uvular trill and the Voiced uvular fricative or approximant are common in some Occitan dialects (Provence, Auvergne, Alps, Limousin). The dialects of Languedoc and Gascony also have these realizations, but it is generally considered to be influence from French and therefore rejected from the standard versions of these dialects.

==Breton==

Breton, spoken in Brittany (France), is a Celtic rather than Romance language, but is heavily influenced by French. It retains an alveolar trill in some dialects, like in Léon and Morbihan, but most dialects now have the same rhotic as French, .

==Continental West Germanic==

The uvular rhotic is most common in Central German dialects and in Standard German. Many Low Franconian, Low Saxon, and Upper German varieties have also adopted it with others maintaining the alveolar trill (). The development of uvular rhotics in these regions is not entirely understood, but a common theory is that these languages have done so because of French influence, though the reason for uvular rhotics in modern European French itself is not well understood (see above).

The Frisian languages usually retain an alveolar rhotic.

===Dutch and Afrikaans===

In modern Dutch, quite a few different rhotic sounds are used. In Flanders, the usual rhotic is an alveolar trill, but the uvular rhotic does occur, mostly in the province of Limburg, in Ghent and in Brussels. In the Netherlands, the uvular rhotic is the dominant rhotic in the southern provinces of North Brabant and Limburg, having become so in the early twentieth century. In the rest of the country, the situation is more complicated. The uvular rhotic is dominant in the western agglomeration Randstad, including cities like Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht (the dialect of Amsterdam conversely tends to use an alveolar rhotic, but the uvular is becoming increasingly common). The uvular rhotic is also used in some major cities such as Leeuwarden (Stadsfries). Outside of these uvular rhotic core areas, the alveolar trill is common. People learning Dutch as a foreign language also tend to use the alveolar trill because it contrasts better with the voiceless velar fricative in Dutch. The Afrikaans language of South Africa also uses an alveolar trill for its rhotic, except in the non-urban rural regions around Cape Town, chiefly in the town of Malmesbury, Western Cape, where it is uvular (called a bry). Some Afrikaans speakers from other areas also bry, either as a result of ancestry from the Malmesbury region or from difficulty pronouncing the alveolar trill.

===Low Saxon===
In the Dutch Low Saxon area there are several cities which have the uvular rhotic: Zutphen, Steenwijk, Kampen, Zwolle and Deventer. In IJsselmuiden near Kampen the uvular r can also be heard. In the countryside the alveolar trill is common.

===Standard German===

Although the first standardized pronunciation dictionary by Theodor Siebs prescribed an alveolar pronunciation, most varieties of German are now spoken with a uvular rhotic, usually a fricative or approximant , rather than a trill . The alveolar pronunciation continues to be considered acceptable in all Standard German varieties, but is most common in the south as well as the far North of German-speaking Europe. It also remains prevailing in classical singing and, to a lesser degree, in stage acting (see ).

In German dialects, the alveolar has survived somewhat more widely than in the standard language, though there are several regions, especially in Central German, where even the broadest rural dialects use a uvular R. 

Regardless of whether a uvular or an alveolar pronunciation is used, German post-vocalic &quot;r&quot; is often vocalized to , , or a simple lengthening . This is most common in the syllable coda, as in non-rhotic English, but sometimes occurs before an underlying schwa, too. Vocalization of &quot;r&quot; is rare only in Alemannic (velar) and Swabian (uvular) German.

===Yiddish===

Yiddish, the traditional language of Ashkenazi Jews in central and eastern Europe, is derived from Middle High German. As such it presumably used the alveolar R at first, but the uvular R then became predominant in many Yiddish dialects. It is unclear whether this happened through independent developments or under influence from modern German (a language widely spoken in large parts of eastern Europe until 1945).

==Insular West Germanic==

===English===

Speakers of the traditional English dialect of Northumberland and northern County Durham use a uvular rhotic, known as the &quot;Northumbrian Burr&quot;. However, it is no longer used by most contemporary speakers, who generally realize as an alveolar approximant, , in common with other varieties spoken in the English-speaking world.

The Hiberno-English of northeastern Leinster in Ireland also uses a uvular .

==North Germanic==
Alveolar rhotics predominate in northern Scandinavia. Where they occur, they affect the succeeding alveolars, turning the clusters and , , , retroflex: . Thus the Norwegian word &quot;norsk&quot; is pronounced by speakers with an alveolar flap. This effect is rare in the speech of those using a uvular R ().

===Danish and Swedish===
The rhotic used in Denmark is a voiced uvular approximant, and the nearby Swedish ex-Danish regions of Scania, Blekinge, southern Halland as well as a large part of Småland and on the Öland island, use a uvular trill or a uvular fricative.

To some extent in Östergötland and still quite commonly in Västergötland, a mixture of guttural and rolling rhotic consonants (e.g. and is used, with the pronunciation depending on the position in the word, the stress of the syllable and in some varieties depending on whether the consonant is geminated. The pronunciation remains if a word that is pronounced with a particular rhotic consonant is put into a compound word in a position where that realization would not otherwise occur if it were part of the same stem as the preceding sound. However, in Östergötland the pronunciation tends to gravitate more towards and in Västergötland the realization is commonly voiced.
Common from the time of Gustav III (Swedish king 1771–1792), who was much inspired by French culture and language, was the use of guttural R in the nobility and in the upper classes of Stockholm. This phenomenon vanished in the 1900s. The last well-known non-Southerner who spoke with a guttural R, and did not have a speech defect, was Anders Gernandt, a popular equitation commentator on TV.

===Norwegian===
Most of Norway uses an alveolar flap, but about one third of the inhabitants of Norway, primarily in the South-West region, are now using the uvular rhotic. In the western and southern part of South Norway, the uvular rhotic is still spreading and includes all towns and coastal areas of Agder, most of Rogaland, large parts of Hordaland, and Sogn og Fjordane in and around Florø. The origin was the city of Bergen as well as Kristiansand in the 18th century. Because retroflex consonants are mutations of and other alveolar or dental consonants, the use of a uvular rhotic means an absence of most retroflex consonants.

===Icelandic===
In Icelandic, the uvular rhotic-like or is an uncommon deviation from the normal alveolar trill or flap, and is considered a speech disorder.

==Slavic languages==

In Slavic languages, the alveolar trill predominates, with the use of guttural rhotics seen as defective pronunciation. However, the uvular trill is common among the languages of the Sorbian minority in Saxony, eastern Germany, likely due to German influence. The uvular rhotic may also be found in a small minority in Silesia and other German-influenced regions of Poland and also Slovenia, but is overall quite rare even in these regions. It can also be perceived as an ethnic marker of Jewishness, particularly in Russian where Eastern European Jews often carried the uvular rhotic from their native Yiddish into their pronunciation of Russian.

==Semitic languages==

===Hebrew===
In Tannaitic Hebrew, Gimel () allophonically alternated between [g] and .

In most forms of Hebrew, the classical pronunciation of &quot;&quot; () was a flapped , and was grammatically treated as an ungeminable phoneme of the language. In most dialects of Hebrew among the Jewish diaspora, it remained a flap or a trill . However, in some Ashkenazi dialects as preserved among Jews in northern Europe it was a uvular rhotic, either a trill or a fricative . This was because many (but not all) native dialects of Yiddish were spoken that way, and their liturgical Hebrew carried the same pronunciation. 

An apparently unrelated uvular rhotic is believed to have appeared in the Tiberian vocalization of Hebrew, where it is believed to have coexisted with additional non-guttural, emphatic articulations of depending on circumstances.

====Yiddish influence====
Although an Ashkenazi Jew in the Russian Empire, the Zionist Eliezer Ben-Yehuda based his Standard Hebrew on Sephardi Hebrew, originally spoken in Spain, and therefore recommended an alveolar . However, just like him, the first waves of Jews to resettle in the Holy Land were Ashkenazi, and Standard Hebrew would come to be spoken with their native pronunciation. Consequently, by now nearly all Israeli Jews pronounce the consonant &quot;rêš&quot; () as a uvular approximant , which also exists in Yiddish.
====Sephardic Hebrew====

Many Jewish immigrants to Israel were Mizrahi Jews who spoke a variety of Arabic in their countries of origin and pronounced the Hebrew rhotic as an alveolar flap , similar to Arabic &#x27; (). Gradually, many of them began pronouncing their Hebrew rhotic as a voiced uvular fricative , a sound similar or (depending on the Arabic dialect) identical to Arabic &#x27; (). 

===Arabic===

While most varieties of Arabic retain the classical pronunciation of () as an alveolar trill or flap , a few varieties use a uvular trill . These include:

* pre-modern Baghdadi Arabic
* The Tigris varieties, a group among the Mesopotamian Arabic in Iraq, for instance in Mosul
* The Jewish and Christian varieties in Baghdad
* The Jewish variety in Algiers
* The variety of Jijel in Algeria
* Some Muslim-urban varieties of Morocco (e.g. in Fes)
* Some Jewish varieties in Morocco

The uvular was attested already in vernacular Arabic of the Abbasid period. Nowadays Christian Arabic of Baghdad exhibits also an alveolar trill in very few lexemes, but primarily used in loanwords from Modern Standard Arabic. Native words with an alveolar trill are rare. Moreover, Mosul Arabic commonly has the voiced alveolar trill instead of a uvular fricative in numbers (e.g. &quot;forty&quot;). Although this guttural rhotic is rare in Arabic, uvular and velar sounds are common in this language. The uvular or velar fricative ~ is a common standard pronunciation of the letter &#x27; (), and the uvular plosive is a standard pronunciation of the letter &#x27; ().

===Ethiopic===

In Amharic the alveolar trill is the usual pronunciation of . But there are also assertions that around Addis Abeba some dialects exhibit a uvular r. Note that this information is not very well supported among Semitists. Also in Gafat (extinct since the 1950s) a uvular fricative or trill might have existed.

===Akkadian===

The majority of Assyriologists deem an alveolar trill or flap the most likely pronunciation of Akkadian in most dialects. However, there are several indications toward a velar or uvular fricative ~ particularly supported by John Huehnergard. The main arguments constitute alternations with the voiceless uvular fricative (e.g. &quot;ruššû/ḫuššû&quot; &quot;red&quot;; &quot;barmātu&quot; &quot;multicolored&quot; (fem. pl.), the spelling &quot;ba-aḫ-ma-a-tù&quot; is attested). Besides shows certain phonological parallelisms with and other gutturals (especially the glottal stop ).

==Austronesian==

===Malayic languages===
Guttural R exists among several Malay dialects. While standard Malay commonly uses coronal r (,), the guttural fricative (~) are more prominently used in many dialects in Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia as well as some parts of Sumatra and Borneo. These dialects include:

* Pahang Malay
* Kedah Malay
* Kelantan-Pattani Malay
* Minangkabau (closely related to Malay that it might be dialects of the same language, only in some dialects)
* Negeri Sembilan Malay
* Sarawak Malay
* Terengganu Malay
* Perak Malay
* Tamiang Malay
* Pontianak Malay
* Palembang Malay

~ Perak Malay and Kedah Malay are the most notable examples.

These dialects mainly use the guttural fricative (~) for both /r/ and /gh/. Standard Malay includes both coronal r (,) and voiced guttural fricative /gh/ (~) as two different phonemes. To denote the guttural r in the dialects, the letter &quot;r&quot; is often replaced by &quot;gh&quot; or &quot;q&quot; in informal writing . Standard Malay words with voiced velar fricative (), such as &quot;loghat&quot; (dialect) and &quot;ghaib&quot; (invisible, mystical) are mostly Arabic loanwords spelled in their origin language with the letter in the Jawi alphabet.

===Other Austronesian languages===
Other Austronesian languages with similar features are:

* Acehnese
* Alas-Kluet
* Cham
* Lampung
* Piuma
* Sapediq
* Rinaxekerek
* Sinvaudjan

==Other language families==

===Basque===
Standard Basque uses a trill for (written as &quot;r-&quot;, &quot;-rr-&quot;, &quot;-r&quot;), but most speakers of the Lapurdian and Low Navarrese dialects use a voiced uvular fricative as in French. In the Southern Basque Country, the uvular articulation is seen as a speech defect, but the prevalence is higher among bilinguals than among Spanish monolinguals. Recently, speakers of Lapurdian and Low Navarrese are uvularizing the tap (&quot;-r-&quot;) as well, thus neutralizing both rhotics.

===Khmer===
Whereas standard Khmer uses an alveolar trill for , the colloquial Phnom Penh dialect uses a uvular pronunciation for the phoneme, which may be elided and leave behind a residual tonal or register contrast.

===Bantu===
Sesotho originally used an alveolar trill , which has shifted to uvular in modern times.

===Hill-Maṛia===
Hill-Maṛia (sometimes considered a dialect of Gondi) has a corresponding to in other related languages or *t̠ from proto Dravidian.

==Rhotic-agnostic guttural consonants written as rhotics==

There are languages where certain indigenous guttural consonants came to be written with symbols used in other languages to represent rhotics, thereby giving the superficial appearance of a guttural R without actually functioning as true rhotic consonants.

===Inuit languages===
The Inuit languages Greenlandic and Inuktitut either orthographize or transliterate their voiced uvular obstruent as . In Greenlandic, this phoneme is , while in Inuktitut it is . This spelling was convenient because these languages do not have non-lateral liquid consonants, and guttural realizations of are common in various languages, particularly the colonial languages Danish and French. But the Alaskan Inupiat language writes its phoneme instead as , reserving for its retroflex phoneme, which Greenlandic and Inuktitut do not have.

==History==

===Early years===

Gyroscope are an Australian rock group which started as Gyroscope Sunday in Beechboro a suburb in Perth, Western Australia in 1997, with Rob Nassif on drums, Carl Maiorana and then Kim Pengilly on bass guitar, Daniel Sanders on guitar and lead vocals, and Zoran Trivic on guitar and backing vocals. Trivic and Nassif had started jamming together and found Sanders through mutual friends. Gyroscope Sunday issued a five-track cassette, &quot;First...&quot;, in 1998.

By May 1998 Pengilly was replaced by Brad Campbell on bass guitar and backing vocals. Trivic and Campbell had attended the same secondary school. At that time they had formed a garage band and performed covers of Nirvana and Foo Fighters. Trivic later recalled &quot;this was a way of learning our individual instruments as we were always about starting our own band – it was just gunna take some time.&quot;

In late 1998 as Gyroscope, with the line-up of Campbell, Nassif, Sanders and Trivic, recorded eight tracks which were released on a compact cassette, &quot;Gyroscope Demo&quot;, in June 1999, with only 500 copies made. While performing on the Perth live circuit the members also had work or school commitments. The band provided support slots for Reel Big Fish (October 1999), Toe to Toe and 28 Days (December), Millencolin (February 2000), The Living End, Unwritten Law.

Two independent extended plays, &quot;Scalectrix&quot; (April 2000) and &quot;Means to an End&quot; were recorded and issued on cassette in 2000, where the former also appeared on CD. From December 2000 the band went on a six-month hiatus when Nassif travelled to Canada to study. Both EPs were combined on cassette, in April 2001 (originally available in four different covers), as &quot;Injuring Yourself Whilst Making Music&quot;.

Upon Nassif&#x27;s return in June 2001, the group signed with Redline Records, owned by fellow Perth rockers, Jebediah, and they supported that band on an Australian tour. Gyroscope&#x27;s first release for Redline was another EP, &quot;Take Time&quot; (May 2002). In October that year &quot;Juice Magazine&quot; named them as one of the next big things along with The Vines, Jet and The Datsuns. At the end of 2002 Gyroscope won a WAMi Award for &quot;Most Popular Local Original Punk Act&quot;.

Gyroscope signed with Festival Mushroom Records at the beginning of 2003. On 3 February that year, with Jedediah, they supported a gig by international headliners Jimmy Eat World at The Globe, Prahran East. Gyroscope issued two more EPs in that year: &quot;Midnight Express&quot; in May – which contained the live favourite &quot;Fire Away&quot;. &quot;Driving for the Storm / Doctor Doctor&quot; followed in September, and received airplay on Triple J radio across Australia. &quot;Doctor Doctor&quot; was listed at No. 92 on the station&#x27;s Hottest 100 for that year.

===&quot;Sound Shattering Sound&quot;===

2004 was Gyroscope&#x27;s breakthrough year. They supported international visitors including Blink-182, Brand New, Thursday, Dashboard Confessional (their lead singer, Chris Carrabba, insisted that they open for his group upon hearing Gyroscope&#x27;s EP), Sparta, Saves the Day and The Get Up Kids. A new single, &quot;Safe Forever&quot;, came out in March 2004 and earned Gyroscope more mainstream exposure, it peaked in the top 100 of the ARIA Singles Chart.

Their first studio album for Festival Mushroom Records, &quot;Sound Shattering Sound&quot;, was released on 14 June 2004. It debuted at No. 37 on the ARIA Albums Chart in the following week—a culmination of seven years&#x27; work while consolidating their live following. It combined newer material with tracks from their previous two EPs and &quot;Safe Forever&quot;.

Andrew Murfett of &quot;The Age&quot; felt it was &quot;an assured release full of crunchy riffs and emotive lyrics.&quot; &quot;FasterLouder&quot;″s Josie9 felt that older tracks &quot;like &#x27;Doctor Doctor&#x27;, &#x27;Driving for the Storm&#x27; and newie &#x27;Confidence in Confidentiality&#x27; are excellent indicators of the bands live sound, with contrasting heavy/soft guitars thanks to guitarist Zoran Trivic, trade off vocals/screams courtesy of singer/guitarist Dan Sanders and Brad Campbell (Bass/vox) and thumping drums from Rob Nassif&quot;. In support of its release Gyroscope commenced their first headlining tour of Australia. Sanders described difficulties while touring and trying to maintain relationships, but noted an advantage: &quot;I could be away for seven weeks and write some of my better lyrics because I&#x27;m missing a girl or mates.&quot;

===&quot;Are You Involved?&quot;===

In May 2005, Gyroscope recorded their second album, &quot;Are You Involved?&quot;, in Los Angeles with Mark Trombino (Jimmy Eat World, Drive Like Jehu, Finch, The Living End, Blink-182) as producer and engineer. During the sessions, they filmed a music video for one side of the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Fast Girl&quot; (March 2006), in Death Valley. Trivic described their sound &quot;I hope people get chills when they listen to it! ... It has the same core elements [as on] the last record, yet this record pushes our musical boundaries a lil further.&quot; Sanders felt one should not &quot;focus on lyrics or the ins and outs of our songwriting but just enjoy.&quot;

&quot;Are You Involved?&quot; was released on 25 September 2005, which peaked at No. 20 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Initial copies had a bonus DVD featuring &#x27;making of&#x27; documentaries for both the album and the &quot;Fast Girl&quot; video. &quot;FasterLouder&quot;″s Kellanator opined that their &quot;lyrics cut you when you least expect it. Their whirling sounds take you on a journey. This isn&#x27;t just music... the band have grown and shifted a little since their last release... [they] have the knack of writing a good meaningful song with delicious pop hooks. Best combination ever.&quot; Bemused on &quot;Punknews.org&quot; website noted that Trombino had &quot;[helped] achieve a fuller, more realized sound than on previous recordings&quot; and the album &quot;has the ability to gradually work its way into your mindset with a lyric or vocal delivery here and a guitar line there.&quot;

During 2005 it was nominated for the inaugural J Award – Triple J&#x27;s Australian Album of the Year. Two tracks, &quot;Fast Girl&quot; and &quot;Beware Wolf&quot;, were listed, at No. 29 and No. 62 respectively, on that year&#x27;s Hottest 100. &quot;Fast Girl&quot; was nominated at the ARIA Music Awards of 2006 for Breakthrough Artist – Single; and the band also received two WAMi Awards in 2006 for &quot;Best Rock Act&quot; and &quot;Best Punk Act&quot;. &quot;Beware Wolf&quot; has been used on the Australian soap opera, &quot;Home and Away&quot;.

===&quot;Breed Obsession&quot;===

Following a successful tour of South Africa, Gyroscope recorded their third major label studio album, &quot;Breed Obsession&quot;, in Liverpool during mid-2007. Dave Eringa (Idlewild, Manic Street Preachers) produced the material while mixing occurred in London. In September that year Gyroscope toured Australia supporting Fall Out Boy on that group&#x27;s Australian leg of their Friends or Enemies Tour.

The first single from &quot;Breed Obsession&quot;, &quot;Snakeskin&quot;, appeared in October 2007, which debuted at No. 30 on the ARIA singles chart. It was the number-one most voted video on JTV, number-one most requested track on Triple J&#x27;s Super Request, and was ranked No. 16 on Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100 for 2007. The music video for &quot;Snakeskin&quot; was shot in Wiltshire, near Stonehenge, south of London. It has the band playing in a 200-metre crop circle – made specifically for the video. This was the same farm where Led Zeppelin&#x27;s crop circle was made, which features on the cover of that group&#x27;s &quot;Remasters&quot; compilation album (October 1990).

Gyroscope performed at the Big Day Out festival, which toured Australia and New Zealand in late January and early February 2008. Rhythmelody at &quot;FasterLouder&quot; caught their performance at the Claremont Showground on 3 February, &quot;they let loose a fantastic set filled with old tracks from Gyroscope&#x27;s younger years, tracks which long time supporters and new fans alike soaked up.&quot; Later that month the band released the second single from the album, &quot;1981&quot;, which peaked in the top 100.

&quot;Breed Obsession&quot; was issued on 8 March 2008, which debuted at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart, the highest debut in the band&#x27;s history and the first Australian artists&#x27; number-one album or single for fifteen weeks. AllMusic&#x27;s Stewart Mason found that they &quot;shake off their always tenuous connection to punk and reveal themselves to be a mainstream pop/rock band with few musical aspirations further than a handful of FM radio hits&quot; and summarised that it was &quot;generically tasty, but full of meaningless empty calories.&quot; By August that year the album was certified gold by ARIA for shipment of 35,000 units.

In May 2008 Gyroscope released a music video for &quot;Australia&quot;. It was filmed in Sydney and directed by Tom Sparks. &quot;Australia&quot; appeared as the next single in the following month, which peaked at No. 52. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2008 &quot;Breed Obsession&quot; was nominated for Best Rock Album. The fourth single, &quot;These Days&quot;, appeared in November that year.

===&quot;Cohesion&quot;===

Following a national tour supporting The Living End, Gyroscope began writing for their fourth studio album, &quot;Cohesion&quot;. The band had 25 songs prior to sorting out the final track list. They signed with Island Records Australia and from September 2009 Gil Norton (Pixies, Maxïmo Park, Foo Fighters) produced their sessions at Rockfield Studios, in Monmouth, Wales. On 16 October 2009 in an interview with Triple J, Sanders announced that the record would be completed by mid-November. He also said that they were considering a self-titled album.

In December 2009 the group revealed a track from the album, &quot;Live Without You&quot;, for radio spots and as an album teaser, on their MySpace page. The first single from the album, &quot;Some of the Places I Know&quot;, was released in March 2010, which peaked at No. 32. The music video had appeared in February. &quot;Cohesion&quot; followed on 9 April 2010, which debuted at No. 3. Mike Allen at SputnikMusic described it as &quot;straightforward rock... [it] is keen on its utilization of blistering riffs, incongruent dynamics, and Daniel Sanders&#x27; soaring clean vocals, all of which play an intricate role in creating the melting pot. Monstrous choruses and infectious hooks are strewn throughout.&quot; In June they started their national tour to promote the album.

=== 2010–2014 ===

On 22 April 2010 the band blogged on their official MySpace page that Warner Music were due to release a compilation album, &quot;Best of Gyroscope&quot;, on 7 May via iTunes, without the band&#x27;s permission. They only found out about the compilation through their fans on Facebook. The band issued a joint statement through their management, criticising Warner for not consulting them. They declared, &quot;The song selection, artwork and everything about this release has been done without consultation with the band. Gyroscope are a band who have always put our fans first. In our opinion, the release of this album without consultation with the band, and without including any material from our new album &quot;Cohesion&quot;, does not represent good value for our fans.&quot; The album was released anyway. The album has since been removed from iTunes and recalled from stores.

In May 2011 they performed at the annual Groovin&#x27; the Moo festival at regional centres in Australia.

In May 2012 Trivic broke both legs when he was struck by a car whilst riding his motorcycle. Initially it was anticipated that his recovery would only take three to four months however his rehabilitation took longer. As a result, the band went into an enforced hiatus until December 2014 when they recommenced live performances with a national tour to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the release of their debut album, &quot;Sound Shattering Sound&quot;.

=== 2015–2016 ===

In May 2015 Gyroscope played a secret show at The Hen House studios to celebrate the Hen House&#x27;s 5th birthday. In February 2016 the band announced a one off show at the Prince of Wales Hotel in Bunbury over the Easter weekend. On 3 March 2016 the band posted a photo of rehearsals on Facebook announcing that they are working on some new songs.

===&quot;Crooked Thought / DABS&quot;===

In 2017 the band released a double A side called &quot;Crooked Thought / DABS&quot; and did a national tour to celebrate the release in January 2018. Recorded at Blackbird Studios in Perth by Dave Parkin.

=== 2018–present ===
The summer of 2018 saw the band head back into Blackbird Studios again with Parkin behind the desk. They ended up recording a session which would sit on their shelves for a good year or so gathering dust.
On Friday 13 September 2019 they released worldwide 3 tracks from this studio stint in the form of an EP, titled &#x27;4YRLV&#x27;.
They are; title track &#x27;4YRLV&#x27;, &#x27;I Am The Night&#x27; and &#x27;Bloodstreams&#x27;.

==Other projects==

Gyroscope members have been involved in side projects and extraneous business ventures.

Sanders and Campbell performed in a Nirvana tribute band, Nirvanarama, its other members were Chris Daymond (Jebediah) on guitar and Drew Goddard (Karnivool lead guitarist) on drums. Nirvanarama played its inaugural show at the Rocket Room venue in Perth at the Smells like Christmas Spirit, Christmas party. They played another set of tribute shows in December 2013.

The support act were Dead Glorious, a street punk group which includes Gyroscope guitarist, Trivic, together with Fergus Deasy (Little Birdy), Matt Pirga (The Reserves) and Matthew Radich (The Critics).

Gyroscope frontman Sanders also started a band in mid 2014, called &#x27;Heard Of Cows?&#x27;, with two members of Karnivool. The lineup consists of Sanders on vocals/guitar, Jono Stockman (Karnivool bassist) on bass/vocals and Drew Goddard (Karnivool lead guitarist) on drums/vocals. Bands they have played alongside include the Meat Puppets, Brant Bjork, the Hard-Ons, Förstöra.

Nassif purchased a rehearsal studio, Hen House Rehearsal Studios, in May 2010 in Osborne Park. It is the same location where Gyroscope had written four of their albums. Nassif described this venue as &quot;a place where bands and musicians can hang out with friends, create amazing music and have fun.&quot; Artists which have rehearsed there include Jebediah, Drapht, Kryptonics, Wrath of Fenrir and Monument.

In the Aussie winter of 2018, Sanders revealed a solo project called XIII (&quot;pron.&quot; &#x27;thirteen&#x27;) and released the debut album titled &quot;Bloody Banks of the Swan&quot;. Wanting to play these songs live, Sanders (vocals/guitar) enlisted old mates Mykal Deville (bass/vocals) and Drew Goddard (drums/vocals). On 2 March 2019 they played their debut show and filmed parts of a super 8 music video for &quot;I Want An Axe To Break The Ice&quot; at Perth City Limits Festival @ Badlands Bar, Perth.

2018 saw Campbell, Sanders and Trivic build their own purpose built recording studio called The Skullery. Situated in their hometown of Perth in a suburb called Malaga, in a recent interview with Alice Cooper they mentioned that &quot;The Skullery is a legends only creative space.&quot;

==Reflections==

Nassif, as part of his ownership and management of The Hen House Rehearsal Studios, continues to update a section entitled &quot;Ideas&quot; on the business&#x27; website as of November 2012. Nassif has used the blog to provide advice for newer musicians and bands with reflections from his time with Gyroscope. In a post entitled, &quot;It&#x27;s not the most talented bands that make it. It&#x27;s the most persistent!&quot;, Nassif explains that Gyroscope recorded its debut album seven years after formation and that a significant contributing factor to the maintenance of the band, as well as other bands, was the equal apportioning of songwriting royalties to all band members:

I think this is incredibly important for young bands because it sets the tone for everyone&#x27;s roles with in the band. It encourages the members who may not be contributing to the song writing to make sure they contribute in other areas. Such as running the Facebook pages, sourcing the merchandise designs, booking gigs and organising the rehearsal studio.

It means picking up any slack, so that even if your not directly involved with the songwriting your still pushing the band forward with your other responsibilities. Great songs alone will not get your band to where you want to go unless your doing all the smaller things really well too.

On 3 November 2012, Nassif uploaded a post entitled &quot;3 Reasons Your Band Should Play More Live Shows!&quot;, in which he reveals that &quot;Gyroscope has never earned a cent from any of our 4 album releases.&quot;

<doc id="752711" wikidata="Q2715893" url="?curid=752711" title="Polgara the Sorceress">
<text>Polgara the Sorceress is a fantasy novel by American writers David and Leigh Eddings, and the twelfth in the setting of &quot;The Belgariad&quot;, &quot;The Malloreon&quot; and &quot;Belgarath the Sorcerer&quot;. Like the latter novel, it is presented as a first-person narrative recounting the life of the eponymous character, Polgara, framed by a prologue and epilogue in the third person placing it in context relative to the earlier stories. The fictional character of Polgara is the (many generations removed) aunt of Belgarion and the daughter of Belgarath.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Polgara the Sorceress&quot; begins with Ce&#x27;Nedra entreating Polgara to write a book about her life, filling in the gaps left by her father&#x27;s story, &quot;Belgarath the Sorcerer&quot;. The main part of the story thus begins, revealing that Polgara and her twin sister Beldaran were raised by their adoptive uncles, the deformed Beldin and the twin sorcerers Beltira and Belkira (all disciples of Aldur, like Belgarath), after the apparent death of their mother, Poledra. Their mother was a shape-shifting wolf at birth; she was distressed that her human babies would be born deficient in lupine instinct, and therefore educated them telepathically prior to parturition. After the birth of the twins, Poledra was presumed to have died; but continued communication with Polgara.

For many years, Polgara resented her father&#x27;s long absence from her own upbringing; and when Belgarath resumed care of his daughters, Beldaran was quick to forgive him but Polgara often fled to the Tree at the center of the Vale of Aldur, where she learned to speak to birds and ultimately mastered the Will and the Word. Belgarath (with Beldaran&#x27;s help) eventually negotiated an uneasy peace, and Polgara began her training under him. Following Beldaran&#x27;s marriage, Polgara also resented the &quot;loss&quot; of her sister; but the shared loss eventually reconciled her to Belgarath. Over the years, she maintained a relationship with the descendants of Beldaran.

A relatively young Polgara spent many years in the Arendish duchy of Vo Wacune, where she mitigated the Arendish civil wars. Ultimately she was proclaimed the &quot;Duchess of Erat&quot;. When Vo Wacune was destroyed, Erat became part of the new kingdom of Sendaria. When the Rivan King (Beldaran&#x27;s descendant) was assassinated, Polgara became the guardian of a secret line of surviving heirs, incognito in Sendaria and its neighboring domains. At the Battle of Vo Mimbre, Polgara learned that in the prophecies of her enemies, she was the intended bride of the dark god Torak, whom she therefore defied at each meeting. Following Torak&#x27;s defeat at Vo Mimbre, Polgara returned to caring for the descendants of Riva, eventually raising Garion.

<doc id="752713" wikidata="Q2549301" url="?curid=752713" title="Drying oil">
<text>A drying oil is an oil that hardens to a tough, solid film after a period of exposure to air, at room temperature. The oil hardens through a chemical reaction in which the components crosslink (and hence polymerize) by the action of oxygen (not through the evaporation of water or other solvents). Drying oils are a key component of oil paint and some varnishes. Some commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, tung oil, poppy seed oil, perilla oil, castor oil and walnut oil. The use of natural drying oils has declined over the past several decades, as they have been replaced by alkyd resins and other binders.

Since oxidation is the key to curing these oils, those that are susceptible to chemical drying are often unsuitable for cooking and are also highly susceptible to becoming rancid through autoxidation, the process by which fatty foods develop off-flavors. Rags, cloth, and paper saturated with drying oils may spontaneously combust (ignite) after a few hours as heat is released during the oxidation process.

==Chemistry of the drying process ==
The &quot;drying&quot;, hardening, or, more properly, curing of oils is the result of autoxidation, the addition of oxygen to an organic compound, and the subsequent crosslinking. This process begins with an oxygen molecule (O2) in the air inserted into carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds adjacent to one of the double bonds within the unsaturated fatty acid. The resulting hydroperoxides are susceptible to crosslinking reactions. Bonds form between neighboring fatty acid chains, resulting in a polymer network, often visible by the formation of a skin-like film on samples. This polymerization results in stable films that, while somewhat elastic, do not flow or deform readily. Diene-containing fatty acid derivatives, such as those derived from linoleic acid, are especially prone to this reaction because they generate pentadienyl radicals. Monounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid, are slower to undergo drying because the allylic radical intermediates are less stable (i.e., slower to form). 

The early stages of the drying process can be monitored by weight changes in an oil film. The film becomes heavier as it absorbs oxygen. Linseed oil, for instance, increases in weight by 17 percent. As oxygen uptake ceases, the weight of the film declines as volatile compounds evaporate. As the oil ages, further transitions occur. A large number of the original ester bonds in the oil molecules undergo hydrolysis, releasing individual fatty acids. In the case of paints, some portion of these free fatty acids (FFAs) react with metals in the pigment, producing metal carboxylates. Together, the various non-cross-linking substances associated with the polymer network constitute the mobile phases. Unlike the molecules that are part of the network itself, they are capable of moving and diffusing within the film, and can be removed using heat or a solvent. The mobile phase may play a role in plasticizing paint films, preventing them from becoming too brittle. Carboxyl groups in the polymers of the stationary phase ionize, becoming negatively charged and form complexes with metal cations present in the pigment. The original network, with its nonpolar, covalent bonds, is replaced by an ionomeric structure, held together by ionic interactions. The structure of these ionomeric networks is not well understood.

Most drying oils rapidly increase in viscosity after heating in the absence of air. If the oil is subjected to raised temperatures for a long time, it will become a rubbery oil-insoluble substance.

===Role of metal catalysts===
The drying process is accelerated by certain metal salts, especially derivatives of cobalt, manganese, or iron. In technical terms, these oil drying agents are coordination complexes that function as homogeneous catalysts. These salts are derived from the carboxylates of lipophilic carboxylic acids, such as naphthenic acids to make the complexes oil-soluble. These catalysts speed up the reduction of the hydroperoxide intermediates. A series of addition reactions ensues. Each step produces additional free radicals, which then engage in further crosslinking. The process finally terminates when pairs of free radicals combine. The polymerization occurs over a period of days to years and renders the film dry to the touch. Premature action of the drying agents causes skinning of the paint, this undesirable process is suppressed by the addition of antiskinning agents such as methylethyl ketone oxime, which evaporate when the paint/oil is applied to a surface.

==Constituents==
Drying oils consist of glycerol triesters of fatty acids. These esters are characterized by high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially alpha-linolenic acid. One common measure of the &quot;siccative&quot; (drying) property of oils is iodine number, which is an indicator of the number of double bonds in the oil. Oils with an iodine number greater than 130 are considered drying, those with an iodine number of 115–130 are semi-drying, and those with an iodine number of less than 115 are non-drying.

==Comparison to waxes and resins==
Non-&quot;drying&quot; waxes, such as hard-film carnauba or paste wax, and resins, such as dammar, copal, and shellac, consist of long, spaghetti-like strands of hydrocarbon molecules, which interlace and compact but do not interconnect (crosslink) in the manner of drying oils. Thus, waxes and resins remain soluble in their original solvent whereas a cured oil paint or varnish does not. A dissolved wax or resin is recovered unchanged after the evaporation of its solvent, but liquids that can dissolve cured drying oils, such as some paint removers do so by chemically changing them.

==Applications==
The ability of drying oils to form strong but flexible films is very useful in oil paints and varnishes. In former times, walnut oil, rich in linoleic acid, was used by painters. Nowadays, linseed oil is used instead.

== Safety ==
Rags, cloth, and paper saturated with drying oils may combust spontaneously (ignite) due to heat released during the curing process. This hazard is greater when oil-soaked materials are folded, bunched, or piled together, which allows heat to accumulate and accelerate the reaction. Precautions include: wetting rags with water and spreading them away from direct sunlight; keeping them in air-tight fireproof metal containers; immersing them in water inside air-tight metal containers designed for such applications; or storing them immersed in solvents in suitable closed containers.

Leaving linseed-oil-soaked rags in a pile after refinishing woodwork was the cause of a 1991 fire in Philadelphia&#x27;s One Meridian Plaza, a 38-story office building, which resulted in severe structural damage, and eventually the demolition of the building.

<doc id="752716" wikidata="Q1089881" url="?curid=752716" title="Churchill Cup">
<text>The Churchill Cup was an annual rugby union tournament, held in June, contested by representative men&#x27;s (and formerly women&#x27;s) teams from Canada, England, the United States, and other invited teams (originally one and later three) from a wide array of countries.

It began in 2003 as an initiative of the governing bodies of the three regular participants—Rugby Canada, the Rugby Football Union (RFU), and USA Rugby—in cooperation with the sport&#x27;s worldwide governing body World Rugby (at the time called the &quot;International Rugby Board&quot; (IRB)).The main intent was to provide the US and Canada with regular international competition. The final edition in 2011 featured invited teams from Italy, Russia, and Tonga, and was won by England Saxons (that country&#x27;s &quot;A&quot;, or developmental, national team). All three governing bodies of the permanent participants agreed to end the tournament after its 2011 edition, as World Rugby will include the US and Canada in its international Test calendar from 2012. Canada and the USA will, however, continue to be supported by the RFU.

The tournament was named after British prime minister Winston Churchill.

==Overview==
The tournament was first held in 2003 with only Canada, England and the USA taking part. The tournament was set up to improve the calibre and profile of rugby in North America, and also to help develop English players not yet part of the full national team. Because of the gap in skill levels, the England A side (second level, despite the &#x27;A&#x27; moniker), rebranded in 2006 as England Saxons, took part instead of the full England men&#x27;s side; however, the full England women&#x27;s side participated.

In 2004, New Zealand were invited, being represented by the New Zealand Māori men&#x27;s team and the women&#x27;s representative team, the Black Ferns. In 2005, the Argentine Rugby Union (UAR) sent its B side, Argentina XV, to the men&#x27;s competition. Originally, New Zealand Māori had been invited, but they declined because it would clash with their fixture with the British and Irish Lions. There was no women&#x27;s competition in either 2005 or 2006, largely because of Canada&#x27;s preparations to host the Women&#x27;s Rugby World Cup in 2006.

Originally, the competition was scheduled only to 2007, as the original contract between Rugby Canada, the Rugby Football Union (England) and USA Rugby was a five-year deal. Under the agreement, Canada would host the first three events, while the USA had an option to host in 2006 and 2007. However, because USA Rugby became involved in hosting the USA Sevens tournament in the IRB Sevens World Series, it allowed Canada to be the principal host in 2006, although that competition saw matches in the US for the first time, in San Jose (more precisely, in the Silicon Valley city of Santa Clara), and three Canadian cities hosted matches: Edmonton, Toronto, and Ottawa.

The organizers increased the number of men&#x27;s teams competing from four to six, effective with the 2006 competition. South Africa and Wales had expressed an interest, but Ireland and Scotland accepted invitations for 2006. Both sent A sides to the competition, and the New Zealand Māori returned that year as well.
In 2007, the Churchill Cup was held in England for the first time. Both Rugby Canada and USA Rugby agreed to the one-time move largely because both countries&#x27; national teams would be competing in the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France.

The 2008 tournament returned to North America, according to tournament organizers. The participants were Canada, USA Eagles, England Saxons, Ireland A, Scotland A, and an Argentina XV (essentially a &#x27;B&#x27;, or third string team) replacing the New Zealand Maori, who as of 2008 participate in the Pacific Nations Cup.

Pool matches were held in Ottawa on June 7, Kingston on June 11, and Toronto on June 14. The finals were held at Toyota Park in Chicago on June 21.

The 2009 competition, the first to be held entirely in the US, was held in the Denver area. In addition to the three permanent competitors of Canada, the US, and England Saxons, Ireland A returned. The Argentina side was a new national selection, named &quot;Jaguares&quot;, initially a major component in the development of a professional player pool for the national team which soon absorbed the country&#x27;s previous &quot;A&quot; national side. Scotland A was replaced by newcomers Georgia. The winners of the 2009 Churchill Cup was Ireland A.

==Results==
*No Plate awarded in 2004 or 2005. Those were played as consolation finals.

For detailed results from a given year&#x27;s competition (including the current year&#x27;s), please see the relevant year&#x27;s tournament&#x27;s article.

==Early history==
The Churchill Cup event, named after former British prime minister Winston Churchill, &quot;Britain&#x27;s Man of the Century&quot;, sees a five-year agreement amongst England, Canada and the US with each forming part of the new company, &quot;Churchill Cup Inc.&quot;. Former Prime Minister Churchill shared close ties with the United States - his mother was American - and obviously with Canada during the Second World War, so it is fitting that this tournament bears his name.

==Concept==
Born of an English tour of North America in 2001, the Churchill Cup of Rugby came to fruition in 2003, in Vancouver. The tournament arises out of a 5-year agreement between Rugby Canada, Rugby USA and the Rugby Football Union (England) to hold an annual rugby tournament in North America originally intended to be played between the nations Senior Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s sides. Canada will host the event from 2003 to 2005, in 2003 and 2004 the event was held in Edmonton, Alberta. While the US will have the option of picking up hosting the last two years of the tournament in 2006 and 2007, with the advent of the USA Sevens in San Diego and the reality of moving such an event, it is entirely likely that the event will remain in Canada, specifically Edmonton, through 2007. With respect to the Women&#x27;s component, with Canada being awarded the 2006 Women&#x27;s World Cup of Rugby, to be played in Edmonton and the Ottawa/Montreal region, it was felt that for 2005 and 2006 the Women&#x27;s component should be removed, with the Women playing in the Canada Cup of Women&#x27;s Rugby in Ottawa/Montreal in July 2005 and the Women&#x27;s World Cup itself in September 2006 in Edmonton and Ottawa/Montreal.

In addition to the changes with respect to the Women&#x27;s component, in 2004 the decision was made to expand the competition to four Nations with the inclusion of an invitational side, which in 2004 was the New Zealand Maori, who won the title in a spectacular overtime match with England. In 2005 Argentina were invited and sent their A side, which provided great entertainment for the fans and a true test of rugby for the founding Nations in the Churchill Cup. Beyond 2005 there was talk of further expanding the event to perhaps six Nations, with three invitational sides participating. This expansion indeed occurred in 2006.

==Purpose==
North American rugby has often despaired in the lack of high quality competition in the continent. As other countries participate in the annual Tri-Nations or Six Nations tournaments, Canada and the US are left to schedule one off invitational games with other Nations, subject to other nations being able to accommodate such games in their schedules. In the Men&#x27;s competition, the middle-power Canadian and American sides were able to test their mettle against some of the best players England and Ireland had to offer, and later New Zealand and Argentina with the inclusion of an invitational side. The competition also allowed England and Ireland to develop players who did not regularly participate in the national squad.

==Logistics==
The 2003 inaugural tournament was played in Vancouver at Thunderbird Stadium. The 2004 Churchill Cup traveled east across the Canadian Rockies to Alberta where games were played in Calgary on the opening weekend and Edmonton for the finals. For 2005 the Churchill Cup was played entirely at Edmonton&#x27;s 60,000 seat Commonwealth Stadium. The same was initially contemplated for 2006 and 2007, but that plan changed due to the expansion of the tournament in 2006 and logistical issues related to the 2007 Rugby World Cup.

==Teams==
The three founding members (Rugby Canada, USA Rugby and England Saxons) were permanently placed in the Churchill Cup with three additional teams selected for each tournament year.

* (first team) : 2003–2011
* (first team) : 2003–2011
* (second team) : 2003–2011

The other teams: 
* (second or third team, depending on year) : 2005, 2008–2009
* (second team) : 2010
* (second team) : 2006–2009
* (first team) : 2009
* (second team) : 2011
* (consisting of New Zealand players of Māori heritage) : 2004, 2006–2007
* (first team) : 2010–2011
* (second team) : 2006–2008
* (first team) : 2011
* (first team) : 2010

<text>In phonetics and phonology, gemination (; from Latin &#x27;doubling&#x27;, itself from &quot;&quot; &#x27;twins&#x27;), or consonant lengthening, is an articulation of a consonant for a longer period of time than that of a singleton consonant. It is distinct from stress. Gemination is represented in many writing systems by a doubled letter and is often perceived as a doubling of the consonant. Some phonological theories use &#x27;doubling&#x27; as a synonym for gemination, while others describe two distinct phenomena.

Consonant length is a distinctive feature in certain languages, such as Japanese. Other languages, such as Greek, do not have word-internal phonemic consonant geminates.

Consonant gemination and vowel length are independent in languages like Arabic, Japanese, Finnish and Estonian; however, in languages like Italian, Norwegian, and Swedish, vowel length and consonant length are interdependent. For example, in Norwegian and Swedish, a geminated consonant is always preceded by a short vowel, while an ungeminated consonant is preceded by a long vowel.

==Phonetics==
Lengthened fricatives, nasals, laterals, approximants and trills are simply prolonged. In lengthened stops, the obstruction of the airway is prolonged, which delays release, and the closure is lengthened. That is, is pronounced , not * In affricates, it is also the closure that is lengthened, not the fricative release. That is, is pronounced , not *.

In terms of consonant duration, Berber and Finnish are reported to have a 3-to-1 ratio, compared with around 2-to-1 (or lower) in Japanese, Italian, and Turkish.

==Phonology==
Gemination of consonants is distinctive in some languages and then is subject to various phonological constraints that depend on the language.

In some languages, like Italian, Swedish, Faroese, Icelandic, and Luganda, consonant length and vowel length depend on each other. A short vowel within a stressed syllable almost always precedes a long consonant or a consonant cluster, and a long vowel must be followed by a short consonant. In Classical Arabic, a long vowel was lengthened even more before permanently-geminate consonants.

In other languages, such as Finnish, consonant length and vowel length are independent of each other. In Finnish, both are phonemic; &#x27;back&#x27;, &#x27;fireplace&#x27; and &#x27;burden&#x27; are different, unrelated words. Finnish consonant length is also affected by consonant gradation. Another important phenomenon is sandhi, which produces long consonants at word boundaries when there is an archiphonemic glottal stop &gt; &#x27;take it (imperative)!&#x27;.

In addition, in some Finnish compound words, if the initial word ends in an , the initial consonant of the following word is geminated: &#x27;trash bag&#x27; , &#x27;welcome&#x27; . In certain cases, a after a is geminated by most people: &#x27;screw&#x27; , &#x27;baby&#x27; . In the Tampere dialect, if a word receives gemination of after , the is often deleted ( , ), and &#x27;Saturday&#x27;, for example, receives a medial , which can in turn lead to deletion of ().

Distinctive consonant length is usually restricted to certain consonants and environments. There are very few languages that have initial consonant length; among those that do are Pattani Malay, Chuukese, Moroccan Arabic, a few Romance languages such as Sicilian and Neapolitan, as well as many High Alemannic German dialects, such as that of Thurgovia. Some African languages, such as Setswana and Luganda, also have initial consonant length: it is very common in Luganda and indicates certain grammatical features. In colloquial Finnish and Italian, long consonants occur in specific instances as sandhi phenomena.

The difference between singleton and geminate consonants varies within and across languages. Sonorants show more distinct geminate-to-singleton ratios while sibilants have less distinct ratios. The bilabial and alveolar geminates are generally longer than velar ones.

The reverse of gemination reduces a long consonant to a short one, which is called &quot;degemination&quot;. It is a pattern in Baltic-Finnic consonant gradation that the strong grade (often the nominative) form of the word is degeminated into a weak grade (often all the other cases) form of the word: &gt; (burden, of the burden). As a historical restructuring at the phonemic level, word-internal long consonants degeminated in Western Romance languages: e.g. Spanish /ˈboka/ &#x27;mouth&#x27; vs. Italian /ˈbokka/, both of which evolved from Latin /ˈbukka/.

==Examples==

===Afroasiatic languages===

====Arabic====
Written Arabic indicates gemination with a diacritic () shaped like a lowercase Greek omega or a rounded Latin &quot;w&quot;, called the : . Written above the consonant that is to be doubled, the is often used to disambiguate words that differ only in the doubling of a consonant where the word intended is not clear from the context. For example, in Arabic, Form I verbs and Form II verbs differ only in the doubling of the middle consonant of the triliteral root in the latter form, &quot;e. g.&quot;, (with full diacritics: ) is a Form I verb meaning &quot;to study&quot;, whereas (with full diacritics: ) is the corresponding Form II verb, with the middle consonant doubled, meaning &quot;to teach&quot;.

====Berber====
In Berber, each consonant has a geminate counterpart, and gemination is lexically contrastive. The distinction between single and geminate consonants is attested in medial position as well as in absolute initial and final positions.

* &#x27;say&#x27;
* &#x27;those in question&#x27;
* &#x27;earth, soil&#x27;
* &#x27;loss&#x27;
* &#x27;mouth&#x27;
* &#x27;mother&#x27;
* &#x27;hyena&#x27;
* &#x27;he was quiet&#x27;
* &#x27;pond, lake, oasis&#x27;
* &#x27;brown buzzard, hawk&#x27;

In addition to lexical geminates, Berber also has phonologically-derived and morphologically-derived geminates. Phonological alternations can surface by concatenation (e.g., &#x27;give him two!&#x27;) or by complete assimilation (e.g. &#x27;he will touch you&#x27;). Morphological alternations include imperfective gemination, with some Berber verbs forming their
imperfective stem by geminating one consonant in their perfective stem (e.g., &#x27;go! PF&#x27;, &#x27;go! IMPF&#x27;), as well as quantity alternations between singular and plural forms (e.g., &#x27;hand&#x27;, &#x27;hands&#x27;).

===Austronesian languages===
Austronesian languages in the Philippines, Micronesia, and Sulawesi are known to have geminate consonants.

====Kavalan====
The Formosan language Kavalan makes use of gemination to mark intensity, as in &#x27;bad&#x27; vs. &#x27;very bad&#x27;.

==== Malay dialects ====
Word-initial gemination occurs in various Malay dialects, particularly those found on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula such as Kelantan-Pattani Malay and Terengganu Malay. Gemination in these dialects of Malay occurs for various purposes such as:

* To form a shortened free variant of a word or phrase so that:
** &gt; &#x27;give&#x27;
** &gt; &#x27;to/at/from the shore&#x27;
* A replacement of reduplication for its various uses (e.g. to denote plural, to form a different word, etc.) in Standard Malay so that:
** &gt; &#x27;children&#x27;
** &gt; &#x27;kite&#x27;

====Tuvaluan====
The Polynesian language Tuvaluan allows for word-initial geminates, such as &#x27;overcooked&#x27;.

===Indo-European languages===

====English====
In English phonology, consonant length is not distinctive within root words. For instance, &quot;baggage&quot; is pronounced , not . However, phonetic gemination does occur marginally.

Gemination is found across words and across morphemes when the last consonant in a given word and the first consonant in the following word are the same fricative, nasal, or stop.

For instance:
* b: &quot;subbasement&quot; 
* d: &quot;midday&quot; 
* f: &quot;life force&quot; 
* g: &quot;egg girl&quot; 
* k: &quot;bookkeeper&quot; 
* l: &quot;wholly&quot; (compare &quot;holy&quot;)
* m: &quot;calm man&quot; or &quot;roommate&quot; (in some dialects) or &quot;prime minister&quot; 
* n: &quot;evenness&quot; 
* p: &quot;lamppost&quot; (compare &quot;lamb post&quot;, &quot;compost&quot;)
* r: &quot;interregnum&quot; or &quot;fire road&quot; 
* s: &quot;misspell&quot; or &quot;this saddle&quot; 
* sh: &quot;fish shop&quot; 
* t: &quot;cat tail&quot; 
* th: &quot;both thighs&quot; 
* v: &quot;live voter&quot; 
* z: &quot;pays zero&quot; 

With affricates, however, this does not occur. For instance:
* &quot;orange juice&quot; 

In most instances, the absence of this doubling does not affect the meaning, though it may confuse the listener momentarily. The following minimal pairs represent examples where the doubling &quot;does&quot; affect the meaning in most accents:

* &quot;ten nails&quot; versus &quot;ten ales&quot;
* &quot;this sin&quot; versus &quot;this inn&quot;
* &quot;five valleys&quot; versus &quot;five alleys&quot;
* &quot;his zone&quot; versus &quot;his own&quot;
* &quot;mead day&quot; versus &quot;me-day&quot;
* &quot;unnamed&quot; versus &quot;unaimed&quot; 
* &quot;forerunner&quot; versus &quot;foreigner&quot; 

Note that whenever appears (in brackets), non-rhotic dialects of English don&#x27;t have the gemination, but rather lengthen the preceding vowel.

In some dialects gemination is also found for some words when the suffix &quot;-ly&quot; follows a root ending in -l or -ll, as in:
* &quot;solely&quot; 
but not
* &quot;usually&quot; 

In some varieties of Welsh English, the process takes place indiscriminately between vowels, e.g. in &quot;money&quot; but it also applies with graphemic duplication (thus, orthographically dictated), e.g. &quot;butter&quot; 

====French====
In French, gemination is usually not phonologically relevant and therefore does not allow words to be distinguished: it mostly corresponds to an accent of insistence ( realised ), or meets hyper-correction criteria: one &quot;corrects&quot; one&#x27;s pronunciation, despite the usual phonology, to be closer to a realization that one imagines to be more correct: thus, the word &quot;illusion&quot; is sometimes pronounced by influence of the spelling.

However, gemination is distinctive in a few cases. Statements such as (&#x27;she said&#x27;) ~ (&#x27;she said it&#x27;) ~ can commonly be distinguished by gemination. In a more sustained pronunciation, gemination distinguishes the conditional (and possibly the future tense) from the imperfect: &#x27;would run&#x27; vs. &#x27;ran&#x27; ; or the indicative from the subjunctive: &#x27;we believe&#x27; vs. &#x27;we believed&#x27; .

====Greek====

In Ancient Greek, consonant length was distinctive, e.g., &#x27;I am of interest&#x27; vs. &#x27;I am going to&#x27;. The distinction has been lost in the standard and most other varieties, with the exception of Cypriot (where it might carry over from Ancient Greek or arise from a number of synchronic and diachronic assimilatory processes, or even spontaneously), some varieties of the southeastern Aegean, and Italy.

====Hindustani====
Gemination is common in both Hindi and Urdu. It does not occur after long vowels and is found in words of both Indic and Arabic origin, but not in those of Persian origin. In Urdu, gemination is represented by the Shadda diacritic, which is usually omitted from writings, and mainly written to clear ambiguity. In Hindi, gemination is represented by doubling the geminated consonant, enjoined with the Virama diacritic.
=====Aspirated consonants=====
Gemination of aspirated consonants in Hindi are formed by combining the corresponding non-aspirated consonant followed by its aspirated counterpart. In vocalised Urdu, the shadda is placed on the unaspirated consonant followed by the short vowel diacritic, followed by the &quot;do-cashmī hē&quot;, which aspirates the preceding consonant. There are few examples where an aspirated consonant is truly doubled.
====Italian====

Italian is notable among the Romance languages for its extensive geminated consonants. In Standard Italian, word-internal geminates are usually written with two consonants, and geminates are distinctive. For example, , meaning &#x27;he/she drank&#x27;, is phonemically and pronounced , while (&#x27;he/she drinks/is drinking&#x27;) is , pronounced . Tonic syllables are bimoraic and are therefore composed of either a long vowel in an open syllable (as in ) or a short vowel in a closed syllable (as in ). In varieties with post-vocalic weakening of some consonants (e.g. → &#x27;reason&#x27;), geminates are not affected ( → &#x27;May&#x27;).

Double or long consonants occur not only within words but also at word boundaries, and they are then pronounced but not necessarily written: + = (&#x27;who knows&#x27;) and (&#x27;I am going home&#x27;) . All consonants except can be geminated. This word-initial gemination is triggered either lexically by the item preceding the lengthening consonant (e.g. by preposition &#x27;to, at&#x27; in &#x27;homeward&#x27; but not by definite article in &#x27;the house&#x27;), or by any word-final stressed vowel ([] &#x27;s/he spoke French&#x27; but [] &#x27;I speak French&#x27;).

====Latin====
In Latin, consonant length was distinctive, as in &#x27;old woman&#x27; vs. &#x27;year&#x27;. Vowel length was also distinctive in Latin until about the fourth century, and was reflected in the orthography with an apex. Geminates inherited from Latin still exist in Italian, in which and contrast with regard to and as in Latin. It has been almost completely lost in French and completely in Romanian. In West Iberian languages, former Latin geminate consonants often evolved to new phonemes, including some instances of nasal vowels in Portuguese and Old Galician as well as most cases of and in Spanish, but phonetic length of both consonants and vowels is no longer distinctive.

====Nepali====
In Nepali, all consonants have geminate counterparts except for . Geminates occur only medially. Examples:

* – &#x27;equal&#x27; ; – &#x27;honour&#x27;
* – &#x27;disturb!&#x27; ; – &#x27;authority&#x27;
* – &#x27;cook!&#x27; ; – &#x27;certain&#x27;

====Norwegian====

In Norwegian, gemination is indicated in writing by double consonants. Gemination often differentiates between unrelated words. As in Italian, Norwegian uses short vowels before doubled consonants and long vowels before single consonants. There are qualitative differences between short and long vowels:

* / – &#x27;method&#x27; / &#x27;must&#x27;
* / – &#x27;to search&#x27; / &#x27;to take off&#x27;
* / – &#x27;theirs&#x27; / &#x27;anger&#x27;

====Polish====

In Polish, consonant length is indicated with two identical letters. Examples:

* – &#x27;bathtub&#x27;
* – &#x27;horror&#x27;
* or – &#x27;hobby&#x27;

Consonant length is distinctive and sometimes is necessary to distinguish words:

* – &#x27;families&#x27;; – &#x27;familial&#x27;
* – &#x27;sacks, bags&#x27;; – &#x27;mammals&#x27;,
* – &#x27;medicines&#x27;; – &#x27;light, lightweight&#x27;

Double consonants are common on morpheme borders where the initial or final sound of the suffix is the same as the final or initial sound of the stem (depending on the position of the suffix), after devoicing. Examples:

* – &#x27;before, previously&#x27;; from (suffix &#x27;before&#x27;) + (archaic &#x27;that&#x27;)
* – &#x27;give back&#x27;; from (suffix &#x27;from&#x27;) + (&#x27;give&#x27;)
* – &#x27;swampy&#x27;; from (&#x27;swamp&#x27;) + (suffix forming adjectives)
* – &#x27;brightest&#x27;; from (suffix forming superlative) + (&#x27;brighter&#x27;)

====Punjabi====
Punjabi is written in two scripts, namely, Gurmukhi and Shahmukhi. Both scripts indicate gemination through the uses of diacritics. In Gurmukhi the diacritic is called the  which is written &quot;before&quot; the geminated consonant and is mandatory. In contrast, the shadda, which is used to represent gemination in the Shahmukhi script, is not necessarily written, retaining the tradition of the original Arabic script and Persian language, where diacritics are usually omitted from writing, except to clear ambiguity, and is written &quot;above&quot; the geminated consonant. In the cases of aspirated consonants in the Shahmukhi script, the shadda remains on the consonant, not on the &quot;do-cashmī he&quot;.

Gemination is specially characteristic of Punjabi compared to other Indo-Aryan languages like Hindi-Urdu, where instead of the presence of consonant lengthening, the preceding vowel tends to be lengthened. Consonant length is distinctive in Punjabi, for example:
====Russian====
In Russian, consonant length (indicated with two letters, as in &#x27;bathtub&#x27;) may occur in several situations.

Minimal pairs (or chronemes) exist, such as &#x27;to hold&#x27; vs &#x27;to support&#x27;, and their conjugations, or &#x27;length&#x27; vs &#x27;long&#x27; adj. f.

*Word formation or conjugation: ( &#x27;length&#x27;) &gt; ( &#x27;long&#x27;) This occurs when two adjacent morphemes have the same consonant and is comparable to the situation of Polish described above.
*Assimilation. The spelling usually reflects the unassimilated consonants, but they are pronounced as a single long consonant.
** ( &#x27;highest&#x27;).

====Spanish====
There are phonetic geminate consonants in Caribbean Spanish due to the assimilation of /l/ and /ɾ/ in syllabic coda to the following consonant. Examples of Cuban Spanish:

===Luganda===
Luganda (a Bantu language) is unusual in that gemination can occur word-initially, as well as word-medially. For example, &#x27;cat&#x27;, &#x27;grandfather&#x27; and &#x27;madam&#x27; all begin with geminate consonants.

There are three consonants that cannot be geminated: , and . Whenever morphological rules would geminate these consonants, and are prefixed with , and changes to . For example:
* &#x27;army&#x27; (root) &gt; &#x27;an army&#x27; (noun)
* &#x27;stone&#x27; (root) &gt; &#x27;a stone&#x27; (noun); is usually spelt 
* &#x27;nation&#x27; (root) &gt; &#x27;a nation&#x27; (noun)
* &#x27;medicine&#x27; (root) &gt; &#x27;medicine&#x27; (noun)

===Japanese===

In Japanese, consonant length is distinctive (as is vowel length). Gemination in the syllabary is represented with the sokuon, a small : for hiragana in native words and for katakana in foreign words. For example, (, ) means &#x27;came; arrived&#x27;, while (, ) means &#x27;cut; sliced&#x27;. With the influx of &quot;gairaigo&quot; (&#x27;foreign words&#x27;) into Modern Japanese, voiced consonants have become able to geminate as well: () means &#x27;(computer) bug&#x27;, and () means &#x27;bag&#x27;. Distinction between voiceless gemination and voiced gemination is visible in pairs of words such as (, meaning &#x27;kit&#x27;) and (, meaning &#x27;kid&#x27;). In addition, in some variants of colloquial Modern Japanese, gemination may be applied to some adjectives and adverbs (regardless of voicing) in order to add emphasis: (, &#x27;amazing&#x27;) contrasts with (, &#x27;&quot;really&quot; amazing&#x27;); (, , &#x27;with all one&#x27;s strength&#x27;) contrasts with (, , &quot;&#x27;really&quot; with all one&#x27;s strength&#x27;).

===Turkic languages===
====Turkish====
In Turkish gemination is indicated by two identical letters as in most languages that have phonemic gemination.

* &quot;mother&quot;
* &quot;freedom&quot;

Loanwords originally ending with a phonemic geminated consonant are always written and pronounced without the ending gemination as in Arabic.

* (hajj) (from Arabic pronounced )
* (Islamic calligraphy) (from Arabic pronounced )

Although gemination is resurrected when the word takes a suffix.

* becomes (&#x27;to hajj&#x27;) when it takes the suffix &quot;-a&quot; (&#x27;to&#x27;, indicating destination)
* becomes (&#x27;of calligraphy&#x27;) when it takes the suffix &quot;-ın&quot; (&#x27;of&#x27;, expressing possession)

Gemination also occurs when a suffix starting with a consonant comes after a word that ends with the same consonant.

* (&#x27;hand&#x27;) + (&quot;-s&quot;, marks plural) = (&#x27;hands&#x27;). (contrasts with , &#x27;s/he eliminates&#x27;)
* (&#x27;to throw&#x27;) + (&quot;-ed&quot;, marks past tense, first person plural) = (&#x27;we threw [smth.]&#x27;). (contrasts with , &#x27;waste&#x27;)

===Dravidian languages===
====Malayalam====
In Malayalam, compounding is phonologically conditioned called as sandhi and gemination occurs at word boundaries. Gemination sandhi is called &quot;dvitva sandhi&quot; or &#x27;doubling sandhi&#x27;.

Consider following example:

Gemination also occurs in a single morpheme like () which has a different meaning from ().

===Uralic languages===
====Sámi languages====
Many Sámi languages have gemination as a phonetic feature. The Proto-Sami language had as many as four different lengths, although there is only one living language where this is attested: certains dialect of Ume Sámi. Most varieties have merged them to two or three contrastive degrees of length.

====Estonian====
Estonian has three phonemic lengths; however, the third length is a suprasegmental feature, which is as much tonal patterning as a length distinction. It is traceable to allophony caused by now-deleted suffixes, for example half-long &lt; * &#x27;of the city&#x27; vs. overlong &lt; * &lt; * &#x27;to the city&#x27;.

====Finnish====
Consonant length is phonemic in Finnish, for example (&#x27;fireplace&#x27;, transcribed with the length sign or with a doubled letter ) and (&#x27;back&#x27;). Consonant gemination occurs with simple consonants ( : ) and between syllables in the pattern (consonant)-vowel-sonorant-stop-stop-vowel () but not generally in codas or with longer syllables. (This occurs in Sami languages and in the Finnish name , which is of Sami origin.) Sandhi often produces geminates.

Both consonant and vowel gemination are phonemic, and both occur independently, e.g. , , , (Karelian surname, &#x27;paint&#x27;, &#x27;model&#x27;, and &#x27;secular&#x27;).

In Standard Finnish, consonant gemination of exists only in interjections, new loan words and in the playful word , with its origins in the 19th century, and derivatives of that word.

In many Finnish dialects there are also the following types of special gemination in connection with long vowels: the southwestern special gemination (), with lengthening of stops + shortening of long vowel, of the type &lt; ; the common gemination (), with lengthening of all consonants in short, stressed syllables, of the type &gt; and its extension (which is strongest in the northwestern Savonian dialects); the eastern dialectal special gemination (), which is the same as the common gemination but also applies to unstressed syllables and certain clusters, of the types &gt; and &gt; .

===Wagiman===
In Wagiman, an indigenous Australian language, consonant length in stops is the primary phonetic feature that differentiates fortis and lenis stops. Wagiman does not have phonetic voice. Word-initial and word-final stops never contrast for length.

==Writing==
In written language, consonant length is often indicated by writing a consonant twice (&quot;ss&quot;, &quot;kk&quot;, &quot;pp&quot;, and so forth), but can also be indicated with a special symbol, such as the shadda in Arabic, the dagesh in Classical Hebrew, or the sokuon in Japanese.

In the International Phonetic Alphabet, long consonants are normally written using the triangular colon , e.g. (&#x27;feathers&#x27;, &#x27;pens&#x27;, also a kind of pasta), though doubled letters are also used (especially for underlying phonemic forms, or in tone languages to facilitate diacritic marking).

* Catalan uses the raised dot (called an interpunct) to distinguish a geminated from a palatal . Thus, (&#x27;parallel&#x27;) and (Standard Catalan: , ).
* Estonian uses &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;g&quot; for short consonants, and &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;k&quot; and &quot;pp&quot;, &quot;tt&quot;, &quot;kk&quot; are used for long consonants.
* Hungarian digraphs and trigraphs are geminated by doubling the first letter only, thus the geminate form of is (rather than *&quot;szsz&quot;), and that of is .
* The only digraph in Ganda, is doubled in the same way: .
* In Italian, geminated instances of the sound cluster (represented by the digraph ) are always indicated by writing , except in the words and , where the letter is doubled. The gemination of sounds , and , (spelled , , and , respectively) is not indicated because these consonants are always geminated when occurring between vowels. Also the sounds , (both spelled ) are always geminated when occurring between vowels, yet their gemination is sometimes shown, redundantly, by doubling the as, e.g., in .
*In Japanese, non-nasal gemination () is denoted by placing the &quot;small&quot; variant of the syllable ( or ) between two syllables, where the end syllable must begin with a consonant. For nasal gemination, precede the syllable with the letter for mora N ( or ). The script of these symbols must match with the surrounding syllables.
* In Swedish and Norwegian, the general rule is that a geminated consonant is written double, unless succeeded by another consonant. Hence (&#x27;hall&#x27;), but (&#x27;Halt!&#x27;). In Swedish, this does not apply to morphological changes (so , &#x27;cold&#x27; and , &#x27;coldly&#x27; or compounds [so (&#x27;flatbread&#x27;)]. The exception are some words ending in &quot;-m&quot;, thus [&#x27;home&#x27;] [but (&#x27;at home&#x27;)] and [&#x27;stem&#x27;], but [&#x27;lamb&#x27;, to distinguish the word from (&#x27;lame&#x27;)], with a long /), as well as adjectives in &quot;-nn&quot;, so , &#x27;thin&#x27; but , &#x27;thinly&#x27; (while Norwegian has a rule always prohibiting two &quot;m&quot;s at the end of a word (with the exception being only a handful of proper names, and as a rule forms with suffixes reinsert the second &quot;m&quot;, and the rule is that these word-final &quot;m&quot;s always cause the preceding vowel sound to be short (despite the spelling)).

===Double letters that are not long consonants===
Doubled orthographic consonants do not always indicate a long phonetic consonant.

* In English, for example, the sound of &quot;running&quot; is not lengthened. Consonant digraphs are used in English to indicate the preceding vowel is a short (lax) vowel, while a single letter often allows a long (tense) vowel to occur. For example, &quot;tapping&quot; (from &quot;tap&quot;) has a short &quot;a&quot; , which is distinct from the diphthongal long &quot;a&quot; in &quot;taping&quot; (from &quot;tape&quot;).
* In Standard Modern Greek, doubled orthographic consonants have no phonetic significance at all.
* Hangul (the Korean alphabet) and its romanizations also use double consonants, but to indicate fortis articulation, not gemination.
* In Klallam, a sequence of two sounds such as in a word like &#x27;sleep&#x27; is not pronounced like a geminated stop with a long closure duration – rather the sequence is pronounced as a sequence of two individual sounds such that the first is released before the articulation of the second .
* In the Old Icelandic orthography of the First Grammatical Treatise, geminates are indicated by small caps: ⟨ʙ⟩, ⟨ᴅ⟩, ⟨ꜰ⟩, ⟨ɢ⟩, ⟨ᴋ⟩, ⟨ʟ⟩, ⟨ᴍ⟩, ⟨ɴ⟩, ⟨ᴘ⟩, ⟨ʀ⟩, ⟨ꜱ⟩ and ⟨ᴛ⟩, whereas modern renditions of Old Norse designate geminates by two consecutive stops, i.e. ⟨bb⟩, ⟨ff⟩, ⟨gg⟩, ⟨kk⟩ ⟨ll⟩, ⟨mm⟩, ⟨nn⟩ ⟨pp⟩, ⟨rr⟩, ⟨ss⟩ and ⟨tt⟩, respectively.
* In Proto-Basque notation, capital letters are employed to denote the fortis–lenis contrast, which manifests as a difference between geminate vs. ⟨L⟩ /lː/ vs. ⟨l⟩ /l/, ⟨N⟩ /nː/ vs. ⟨n⟩ /n/, but capitals might also denote voiceless vs. voiced (⟨T⟩ /t/ vs. ⟨d⟩ /d/, ⟨K⟩ /k/ vs. ⟨g⟩ /g/, no ⟨P⟩ exists in Mitxelena&#x27;s reconstruction consonant system of Proto-Basque, only ⟨b⟩) or affricate vs. sibilant distinction (⟨TZ⟩ /t̻s̻/ vs. ⟨z⟩ /s̻/, ⟨TS⟩ /t̺s̺/ vs. ⟨s⟩ /s̺/), or trill ⟨R⟩ /r/ vs. tap ⟨r⟩ /ɾ/.

<text>Document is the fifth studio album by American rock band R.E.M., released on September 1, 1987, by I.R.S. Records. It was their first album to be co-produced by the band and Scott Litt.

Continuing in the vein of their previous album &quot;Lifes Rich Pageant&quot;, &quot;Document&quot; features more audible lyrics and a harder rock sound in comparison to the band&#x27;s earlier releases. The album became R.E.M.&#x27;s greatest success at the time, giving the band their first top 10 hit (&quot;The One I Love&quot;) and album, peaking at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Composition==

&quot;Document&quot; was R.E.M.&#x27;s first album to be co-produced by the band and Scott Litt; this was a collaboration that continued through the productions of &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;Out of Time&quot;, &quot;Automatic for the People&quot;, &quot;Monster&quot;, and &quot;New Adventures in Hi-Fi&quot;. The album&#x27;s clear production and muscular rock riffs both helped to move the band toward mainstream success and built on the work done by Don Gehman, who had produced their previous album &quot;Lifes Rich Pageant&quot;. This release not only launched &quot;The One I Love&quot; — R.E.M.&#x27;s first Top 10 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 9 — but also gave them their first platinum album.

&quot;Strange&quot; was originally recorded by post-punk band Wire on their debut album &quot;Pink Flag&quot;.

R.E.M. expanded their instrumentation somewhat on the album, adding a dulcimer to &quot;King of Birds&quot; and a saxophone to &quot;Fireplace&quot;. Steve Berlin was brought in to add his saxophone skills because of a prior relationship with producer Scott Litt. This experimentation would lead to their adoption of the mandolin, which featured prominently on their subsequent albums &quot;Green&quot; and &quot;Out of Time&quot;; furthermore, the band&#x27;s musicians began swapping instruments both in concert and the studio with an effort to create new sounds and avoid stagnation.

==Packaging==
The original sleeve for the album featured the message &quot;File under Fire&quot;, a reference to what Michael Stipe considered to be the central lyrical theme of the album, and also references the chorus to &quot;The One I Love&quot;. A similar message (&quot;File under water&quot;) could be found on the cover of the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Reckoning&quot;, as well as on the compilation album &quot;Eponymous&quot; (&quot;File under grain&quot;) referring to the idea behind &quot;Talk About the Passion&quot;, which was about hunger. Two rejected suggestions for the title of the album—&quot;R.E.M. No. 5&quot; and &quot;Table of Content&quot;—also appear on the sleeve artwork. Other possible album titles included &quot;Mr. Evil Breakfast&quot;, &quot;Skin Up with R.E.M.&quot;, and &quot;Last Train to Disneyland&quot; (the last one having been suggested by Peter Buck, who felt that America under the presidency of Ronald Reagan was beginning to feel a lot like the famed amusement park).

==Critical reception==
In a contemporary review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau said that R.E.M. had moved on from their past work&#x27;s escapism and that &quot;their discovery of the outside world has sharpened their sense of humor along with everything else&quot;, citing &quot;It&#x27;s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)&quot; as an &quot;inspirational title&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer David Fricke felt that the album was R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;finest to date&quot;, and said that &quot;&quot;Document&quot; is the sound of R.E.M. on the move&quot;.

&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Chris Willman complimented the diversity of the music and themes, observing, &quot;&quot;Document&quot; is a tougher, meaner, leaner record than its immediate predecessors—replacing the jangly, sprightly, romantic sound the band became known for with a far more hard-edged guitar sound, as well as tenser rock rhythms. It&#x27;s predictably cryptic indeed at times, but the opaque mystery that was so enticingly R.E.M. has been largely replaced here with something more definite and immediately tangible.&quot;

&quot;Uncut&quot;″s Andrew Mueller praised &quot;Document&quot; in a retrospective review, saying, &quot;If 1986&#x27;s &quot;Lifes Rich Pageant&quot; had marked the beginnings of R.E.M.&#x27;s emergence from their cocoon of indie diffidence, 1987&#x27;s &quot;Document&quot; was where they first properly reconciled themselves to their destiny as the only group of the 1980s American college-rock milieu to graduate to stadiums, and stay there.&quot; David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; observed, &quot;The record that gave R.E.M. a top 10 hit (&#x27;The One I Love&#x27;) mostly does no more than consolidate their strengths but has moments of undeniable power and the most sardonic apocalypse ever recorded, &#x27;It&#x27;s the End of the World as We Know It (and I Feel Fine).&#x27;&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that &quot;where &quot;Lifes Rich Pageant&quot; sounded a bit like a party record, &quot;Document&quot; is a fiery statement, and its memorable melodies and riffs are made all the more indelible by its righteous anger.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; went on to include &quot;Document&quot; in their list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s (in 41st place), and then ranked it number 462 on 2012 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at number 17 on its list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;.

==Reissue==
In 1999, the album was remastered by Bob Ludwig and re-released on Compact Disc by I.R.S. Records in the United States. This version came in a replica of the record sleeve made of cardboard. In 2005, Capitol Records (whose then parent company EMI at that time owned I.R.S. Records&#x27; catalog) issued an expanded DualDisc edition of &quot;Document&quot; which includes a digitally remastered version of the album on the CD side, a DVD-Audio, DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1-channel surround sound mix of the album done by Elliot Scheiner on the DVD side, and the original CD booklet.

<doc id="752732" wikidata="Q44906" url="?curid=752732" title="Private spaceflight">
<text>Private spaceflight refers to spaceflight developments that are not conducted by a government agency, such as NASA or ESA.

During the early decades of the Space Age, the government space agencies of the Soviet Union and United States pioneered space technology in collaboration with affiliated design bureaus in the USSR and private companies in the US. They entirely funded both the development of new spaceflight technologies and the operational costs of spaceflight. Following a similar model of space technology development, the European Space Agency was formed in 1975. Arianespace, born out of ESA&#x27;s independent spaceflight efforts, became the world&#x27;s first commercial launch service provider in the early 1980s. Subsequently, large defense contractors began to develop and operate space launch systems, which were derived from government rockets. 

Private spaceflight in Earth orbit includes communications satellites, satellite television, satellite radio, astronaut transport and sub-orbital and orbital space tourism. In the United States, the FAA has created a new certification called Commercial Astronaut, a new occupation.

In the 2000s, entrepreneurs began designing—and by the 2010s, deploying—space systems competitive to the governmental systems of the early decades of the space age. These new offerings have brought about significant market competition in space launch services after 2010 that had not been present previously, principally through the reduction of the cost of space launch and the availability of more space launch capacity.

Private spaceflight accomplishments to date include flying suborbital spaceplanes (SpaceShipOne and SpaceShipTwo), launching orbital rockets, flying two orbital expandable test modules (Genesis I and II). On the opposite, launching astronauts to the International Space Station and certain satellite launches are performed on behalf of and financed by government agencies.

Planned private spaceflights beyond Earth orbit include personal spaceflights around the Moon. Two private orbital habitat prototypes are already in Earth orbit, with larger versions to follow. Planned private spaceflights beyond Earth orbit include solar sailing prototypes (LightSail-3).

== History of commercial space transportation ==
During the principal period of spaceflight in the mid-twentieth century, only nation states developed and flew spacecraft above the Kármán line, the nominal boundary of space. Both the U.S. civilian space program and Soviet space program were operated using mainly military pilots as astronauts. During this period, no commercial space launches were available to private operators, and no private organization was able to offer space launches. Eventually, private organizations were able to both offer and purchase space launches, thus beginning the period of private spaceflight. 
The first phase of private space operation was the launch of the first commercial communications satellites. The U.S. Communications Satellite Act of 1962 allowed commercial consortia owning and operating their own satellites, although these were still deployed on state-owned launch vehicles.

In 1980, the European Space Agency created Arianespace, a company to be operated commercially after initial hardware and launch facilities were developed with government funding. Arianespace has since launched numerous satellites as a commercial entity.

The history of full private space transportation includes early efforts by German company OTRAG in the 20th century. Founded in 1975 as the first private company to attempt to launch a private spacecraft, testing of its OTRAG rocket began in 1977. The history also covers numerous modern orbital and suborbital launch systems in the 21st century. More recent commercial spaceflight projects include the suborbital flights of Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, the orbital flights of SpaceX and other COTS participants.

Development of alternatives to government-provided space launch services began in earnest in the 2000s. Private interests began funding limited development programs, but the US government later sponsored a series of programs to incentivize and encourage private companies to begin offering both cargo, and later, crew space transportation services.

Lower prices for launch services after 2010, and published prices for standard launch services, have brought about significant space launch market competition that had not been present previously. By 2012, a private company had begun transporting cargo to and from the International Space Station, while a second private company was scheduled to begin making deliveries in 2013, ushering in a time of regular private space cargo delivery to and return from the government-owned space facility in low Earth orbit (LEO). In this new paradigm for LEO cargo transport, the government contracts for and pays for cargo services on substantially privately developed space vehicles rather than the government operating each of the cargo vehicles and cargo delivery systems. , there is a mix of private and government resupply vehicles being used for the ISS, as the Russian Soyuz and Progress vehicles, and the European Space Agency (ESA) ATV (through 2014) and the Japanese Kounotori (through 2021) remain in operation after the 2011 retirement of the US Space Shuttle.

In June 2013, British newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; claimed that &quot;the space race is flaring back into life, and it&#x27;s not massive institutions such as NASA that are in the running. The old view that human space flight is so complex, difficult and expensive that only huge government agencies could hope to accomplish it is being disproved by a new breed of flamboyant space privateers, who are planning to send humans out beyond the Earth&#x27;s orbit for the first time since 1972,&quot; particularly noting projects underway by Mars One, Inspiration Mars Foundation, Bigelow Aerospace and SpaceX.

=== American deregulation ===
The Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984 required encouragement of commercial space ventures, adding a new clause to NASA&#x27;s mission statement:
:(c) Commercial Use of Space. --Congress declares that the general welfare of the United States requires that the Administration seek and encourage, to the maximum extent possible, the fullest commercial use of space.

Yet one of NASA&#x27;s early actions was to effectively prevent private space flight through a large amount of regulation. From the beginning, though, this met significant opposition not only by the private sector, but in Congress. In 1962, Congress passed its first law pushing back the prohibition on private involvement in space, the Communications Satellite Act of 1962. While largely focusing on the satellites of its namesake, this was described by both the law&#x27;s opponents &quot;and&quot; advocates of private space, as the first step on the road to privatisation.

While launch vehicles were originally bought from private contractors, from the beginning of the Shuttle program until the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster in 1986, NASA attempted to position its shuttle as the sole legal space launch option.
But with the mid-launch explosion/loss of &quot;Challenger&quot; came the suspension of the government-operated shuttle flights, allowing the formation of a commercial launch industry.

On 4 July 1982, the Reagan administration released National Security Decision Directive Number 42 which officially set its goal to expand United States private-sector investment and involvement in civil space and space-related activities.

On 16 May 1983, the Reagan administration issued National Security Decision Directive Number 94 encouraging the commercialization of expendable launch vehicles (ELVs), which directed that, &quot;The U.S. Government will license, supervise, and/or regulate U.S. commercial ELV operations only to the extent required to meet its national and international obligations and to ensure public safety.&quot;

On 30 October 1984, US President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Commercial Space Launch Act. This enabled an American industry of private operators of expendable launch systems. Prior to the signing of this law, all commercial satellite launches in the United States were restricted by Federal regulation to NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle.

On 11 February 1988, the Presidential Directive declared that the government should purchase commercially available space goods and services to the fullest extent feasible and shall not conduct activities with potential commercial applications that preclude or deter Commercial Sector space activities except for national security or public safety reasons.

On 5 November 1990, United States President George H. W. Bush signed into law the Launch Services Purchase Act. The Act, in a complete reversal of the earlier Space Shuttle monopoly, ordered NASA to purchase launch services for its primary payloads from commercial providers whenever such services are required in the course of its activities.

In 1996, the United States government selected Lockheed Martin and Boeing to each develop Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles (EELV) to compete for launch contracts and provide assured access to space. The government&#x27;s acquisition strategy relied on the strong commercial viability of both vehicles to lower unit costs. This anticipated market demand did not materialise, but both the Delta IV and Atlas V EELVs remain in active service.

Commercial launches outnumbered government launches at the Eastern Range in 1997.

The Commercial Space Act was passed in 1998 and implements many of the provisions of the Launch Services Purchase Act of 1990.

Nonetheless, until 2004 NASA kept private space flight effectively illegal. But that year, the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004 required that NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration legalise private space flight.
The 2004 Act also specified a &quot;learning period&quot; which restricted the ability of the FAA to enact regulations regarding the safety of people who might actually fly on commercial spacecraft through 2012, ostensibly because spaceflight participants would share the risk of flight through informed consent procedures of human spaceflight risks, while requiring the launch provider to be legally liable for potential losses to uninvolved persons and structures.

To the end of 2014, commercial passenger flights in space has remained effectively illegal, as the FAA has refused to give a commercial operator&#x27;s license to any private space company.

The United States updated US commercial space legislation with the passage of the &quot;Spurring Private Aerospace Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship Act of 2015&quot; (SPACE Act of 2015) in November 2015.

The update US law explicitly allows &quot;US citizens to engage in the commercial exploration and exploitation of &#x27;space resources&#x27; [including... water and minerals]&quot;. The right does not extend to biological life, so anything that is alive may not be exploited commercially. The Act further asserts that &quot;the United States does not [(by this Act)] assert sovereignty, or sovereign or exclusive rights or jurisdiction over, or the ownership of, any celestial body&quot;.

The SPACE Act includes the extension of indemnification of US launch providers for extraordinary catastrophic third-party losses of a failed launch through 2025, while the previous indemnification law was scheduled to expire in 2016. The Act also extends, through 2025, the &quot;learning period&quot; restrictions which limit the ability of the FAA to enact regulations regarding the safety of spaceflight &quot;participants&quot;.

Indemnification for extraordinary third-party losses has, as of 2015, been a component of US space law for over 25 years, and during this time, &quot;has never been invoked in any commercial launch mishap&quot;.

=== Russian privatization ===

In 1992, a Resurs-500 capsule containing gifts was launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome in a private spaceflight called Europe-America 500. The flight was conceived by the Russian Foundation for Social Inventions and TsSKB-Progress, a Russian rocket-building company, to increase trade between Russia and the United States, and to promote the use of technology once reserved only for military forces. Money for the launch was raised from a collection of Russian companies. The capsule parachuted into the Pacific Ocean and was brought to Seattle by a Russian missile-tracking ship.

=== Launch alliances ===
Since 1995 Khrunichev&#x27;s Proton rocket has been marketed through International Launch Services, while the Soyuz rocket is marketed via Starsem. The Sea Launch project flew the Ukrainian Zenit rocket.

In 2003, Arianespace joined with Boeing Launch Services and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to create the Launch Services Alliance. In 2005, continued weak commercial demand for EELV launches drove Lockheed Martin and Boeing to propose a joint venture called the United Launch Alliance to service the United States government launch market.

=== Spaceflight privatization ===
Since the 1980s, various private initiatives have started up to pursue the private use of space. Traditional costs to launch anything to space have been high—on the order of tens of thousands of US dollars per kilogram—but by 2020, costs on the order of a few thousand dollars per kilogram are being seen from one private launch provider that was an early 2000s startup, with the cost projected to fall to less than a few hundred dollars per kilogram as the technology of a second private spaceflight startup of ~2000 comes into service.

The first privately funded rocket to reach the boundary of space, the Kármán line, (although not orbit) was Conestoga I, which was launched by Space Services Inc. on a suborbital flight to altitude on 9 September 1982. In October 1995, their first (and only) attempt at an orbital launch, Conestoga 1620, failed to achieve orbit due to a guidance system failure.
On April 5, 1990, Orbital Sciences Corporation&#x27;s Pegasus, an air launched rocket, was the first launch vehicle fully developed by a private company to reach orbit.

In the early 2000s, several public-private corporate partnerships were established in the United States to privately develop spaceflight technology. Several purely private initiatives have shown interest in private endeavors to the inner Solar System.

In 2006, NASA initiated a program to purchase commercial space transport to carry cargo to the International Space Station, while funding a portion of the development of new technology in a public-private partnership.

In May 2015, the Japanese legislature considered legislation to allow private company spaceflight initiatives in Japan.

In 2016, the United States granted its first clearance for a private flight to the Moon, from the FAA&#x27;s Office of Commercial Space Transportation.

On 30 May 2020, Crew Dragon Demo-2 operated by SpaceX became the first crewed mission to the International Space Station in the Commercial Crew Program.

After 2015, European-based private small-lift launch vehicle development got underway, particularly in Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom, but &quot;France has largely been left out of this new commercial launch industry&quot;. In 2021, the Government of France announced a plan to fund the &quot;France-based rocket firm ArianeGroup to develop a new small-lift rocket called Maïa by the year 2026,&quot; which would be a government-funded but commercially developed rocket.

On 22 February 2024, Intuitive Machine&#x27;s private &quot;Odysseus&quot; successfully landed on the Moon after taking off on a SpaceX Falcon 9 liftoff on 15 February 2024 in a mission between NASA, SpaceX, and Intuitive Machines. This event marked the first successful landing of a privately owned spacecraft on the Moon and the United States&#x27; first lunar landing in over 50 years and the first lander to do so with cryogenic propellants.

== Companies ==


Today many commercial space transportation companies offer launch services to satellite companies and government space organizations around the world. In 2005, there were 18 total commercial launches and 37 non-commercial launches. Russia flew 44% of commercial orbital launches, while Europe had 28% and the United States had 6%. China&#x27;s first private launch, a suborbital flight by OneSpace, took place in May 2018.

=== Funding ===
In recent years, the funding to support private spaceflight has begun to be raised from a larger pool of sources than the comparatively limited pool of the 1990s. For example, and in the United States alone, ten billionaires had made &quot;serious investments in private spaceflight activities&quot; at six companies, including Stratolaunch Systems, Planetary Resources, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic, SpaceX, and Bigelow Aerospace. The ten investors were Paul Allen, Larry Page, Eric Schmidt, Ram Shriram, Charles Simonyi, Ross Perot Jr., Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, Elon Musk, and Robert Bigelow.

At the start of the private space era it was not yet clear to what extent these entrepreneurs see &quot;legitimate business opportunity, [for example], space tourism and other commercial activities in space, or [are] wealthy men seeking the exclusivity that space offers innovators and investors.&quot; There has been speculation as to whether these investments are a &quot;gamble&quot;, and whether they will prove lucrative.

As of the early 2020s some of these investments have paid off, with Musk&#x27;s SpaceX coming to dominate the launch market in mass to orbit and with a $100 billion valuation. Other companies such as Bigelow Aerospace though have collapsed and left the market. Some aerospace startups, such as Rocket Lab, have gone public via special-purpose acquisition company, but their SPAC values have been affected by market volatility.

==== Venture capital investment ====
Some investors see the traditional spaceflight industry as ripe for disruption, with &quot;a 100-fold improvement a thousand-fold improvement &quot;. Between 2005 and 2015, there was of private capital invested in the space sector, most of it in the United States. This liberalized private space sector investments beginning in the 1980s, with additional legislative reforms in the 1990s–2000s. From 2000 through the end of 2015, a total of of investment finance was invested in the space sector, with of that being venture capital. In 2015, venture capital firms invested in private spaceflight companies, more than they had in the previous 15 years combined. , the largest and most active investors in space were Lux Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, Khosla Ventures, Founders Fund, RRE Ventures and Draper Fisher Jurvetson.

Increasing interest by investors in economically driven spaceflight had begun to appear by 2016, and some space ventures had to turn away investor funding. CBInsights in August 2016 published that funding to space startups was &quot;in a slump&quot;, although the number of space investment deals per quarter had gone from 2 or 3 in 2012 to 14 by 2015. In 2017, CB Insights ranked the most active space tech investors, ranked from highest to lowest, were Space Angels Networks, Founders Fund, RRE Ventures, Data Collective, Bessemer, Lux Capital, Alphabet, Tencent Holdings, and Rothenberg Ventures. In June 2019, Miriam Kramer of Axios wrote that private spaceflight companies and investors were poised to capitalize on NASA&#x27;s plan to open up the International Space Station to commercial space ventures.

=== Commercial launchers ===
The space transport business has, historically, had its primary customers in national governments and large commercial segments. Launches of government payloads, including military, civilian and scientific satellites, was the largest market segment in 2007 at nearly $100 billion a year. This segment was dominated by domestic favorites such as the United Launch Alliance for U.S. government payloads and Arianespace for European satellites until the 2020s when NewSpace launch providers like SpaceX and Blue Origin were able to compete for these contracts.

==== US government commercial cargo services ====

The US government determined to begin a process to purchase orbital launch services for cargo deliveries to the International Space Station (ISS) beginning in the mid-2000s, rather than operate the launch and delivery services as they had with the Space Shuttle, which was to retire in less than half a decade, and ultimately did retire in 2011. On 18 January 2006, NASA announced an opportunity for US commercial providers to demonstrate orbital transportation services. As of 2008, NASA planned to spend $500 million through 2010 to finance development of private sector capability to transport payloads to the International Space Station (ISS). This was considered more challenging than then-available commercial space transportation because it would require precision orbit insertion, rendezvous and possibly docking with another spacecraft. The commercial vendors competed in specific service areas.

In August 2006, NASA announced that two relatively young aerospace companies, SpaceX and Rocketplane Kistler, had been awarded $278 million and $207 million, respectively, under the COTS program. In 2008, NASA anticipated that commercial cargo delivery services to and return services from the ISS would be necessary through at least 2015. The NASA Administrator suggested that space transportation services procurement may be expanded to orbital fuel depots and lunar surface deliveries should the first phase of COTS prove successful.

After it transpired that Rocketplane Kistler was failing to meet its contractual deadlines, NASA terminated its contract with the company in August 2008, after only $32 million had been spent. Several months later, in December 2008, NASA awarded the remaining $170 million in that contract to Orbital Sciences Corporation to develop resupply services to the ISS.

=== Emerging personal spaceflight ===

Before 2004, the year it was legalized in the US, no privately operated crewed spaceflight had ever occurred. The only private individuals to journey to space went as space tourists in the Space Shuttle or on Russian Soyuz flights to Mir or the International Space Station.

All private individuals who flew to space before Dennis Tito&#x27;s self-financed International Space Station visit in 2001 had been sponsored by their home governments or by private corporations. Those trips include US Congressman Bill Nelson&#x27;s January 1986 flight on the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; and Japanese television reporter Toyohiro Akiyama&#x27;s 1990 flight to the Mir Space Station.

The Ansari X PRIZE was intended to stimulate private investment in the development of spaceflight technologies. 21 June 2004, test flight of SpaceShipOne, a contender for the X PRIZE, was the first human spaceflight in a privately developed and operated vehicle.

On 27 September 2004, following the success of SpaceShipOne, Richard Branson, owner of Virgin and Burt Rutan, SpaceShipOne&#x27;s designer, announced that Virgin Galactic had licensed the craft&#x27;s technology, and were planning commercial space flights in 2.5 to 3 years. A fleet of five craft (SpaceShipTwo, launched from the WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane) were to be constructed, and flights would be offered at around $200,000 each, although Branson said he planned to use this money to make flights more affordable in the long term. A test flight of SpaceShipTwo in October 2014 resulted in a crash during one of the two pilots died.

In December 2004, United States President George W. Bush signed into law the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act. The Act resolved the regulatory ambiguity surrounding private spaceflights and is designed to promote the development of the emerging U.S. commercial human space flight industry.

On 12 July 2006, Bigelow Aerospace launched the &quot;Genesis I&quot;, a subscale pathfinder of an orbital space station module. &quot;Genesis II&quot; was launched on 28 June 2007, and there are plans for additional prototypes to be launched in preparation for the production model &quot;BA 330&quot; spacecraft.

In November 2009, Zero 2 Infinity, a Spanish aerospace company announced plans for a balloon-based nears space tourism vehicle called Bloon. Then in 2015 it started developing a high-altitude balloon-based launch vehicle named bloostar to launch small satellites to orbit for customers, as well as platform for near-space tourism. World View, a stratospheric balloon exploration company based in Tucson, Ariz., is similarly leveraging its stratospheric balloon technology to launch its remote sensing services for government and commercial customers, as well as developing its own space tourism offering that would lift passengers up to 100,000 feet for a 6-8 journey. Similar projects of stratospheric balloon tourism are being developed by multiple other companies around the world (Zephalto, Space Perspective...), though none has yet made a high altitude crewed flight (as of Aug. 2022).

On July 11, 2021, Richard Branson and Virgin Galactic made their first successful flight to space.

On July 20, 2021, Jeff Bezos and Blue Origin also made a successful flight to space.

On September 16, 2021, Crew Dragon &quot;Resilience&quot; Inspiration4 mission operated by SpaceX became the first orbital spaceflight with only private citizens aboard. In September 2024, the SpaceX mission Polaris Dawn included the first private spacewalk.

=== Private foundations ===
The B612 Foundation was designing and building an asteroid-finding space telescope named Sentinel. It would have launched in 2016.

The Planetary Society, a nonprofit space research and advocacy organization, has sponsored a series of small satellites to test the feasibility of solar sailing. Their first such project, Cosmos 1, was launched in 2005 but failed to reach space, and was succeeded by the Lightsail series, the first of which launched on 20 May 2015. A second spacecraft is expected to launch in 2016 on a more complex mission.

Copenhagen Suborbitals is a crowd funded amateur crewed space programme. it has flown four home-built rockets and two mock-up space capsules.

== Plans ==

Many have speculated on where private spaceflight may go in the near future. Numerous projects of orbital and suborbital launch systems for satellites and crewed flights exist. Some orbital crewed missions would be state-sponsored like most COTS participants. (that develop their own launch systems). Another possibility is for paid suborbital tourism on craft like those from Virgin Galactic, Space Adventures, XCOR Aerospace, RocketShip Tours, ARCASPACE, PlanetSpace-Canadian Arrow, British Starchaser Industries or non-commercial like Copenhagen Suborbitals. Additionally, suborbital spacecraft have applications for faster intercontinental package delivery and passenger flight.

=== Private orbital spaceflight, space stations ===
SpaceX&#x27;s Falcon 9 rocket, first launched in 2010 with no passengers, was designed to be subsequently human-rated. The Atlas V launch vehicle is also a contender for human-rating.

Plans and a full-scale prototype for the SpaceX Dragon, a capsule capable of carrying up to seven passengers, were announced in March 2006, and Dragon version 2 flight hardware was unveiled in May 2014. , both SpaceX and Boeing have received contracts from NASA to complete building, testing, and flying up to six flights of human-rated space capsules to the International Space Station beginning in 2017 as part of the Commercial Crew Program.

In December 2010, SpaceX launched the second Falcon 9 and the first operational Dragon spacecraft. The mission was deemed fully successful, marking the first launch to space, atmospheric reentry and recovery of a capsule by a private company. Subsequent COTS missions included increasingly complex orbital tasks, culminating in Dragon first docking to the ISS in 2012.

The British Government partnered in 2015 with the ESA to promote a possibly commercial single-stage to orbit spaceplane concept called Skylon. This design was pioneered by the privately held Reaction Engines Limited, a company founded by Alan Bond after HOTOL was canceled.

As of 2012, private company NanoRacks provides commercial access to the US National Laboratory space on the International Space Station (ISS). Science experiments can be conducted on a variety of standard rack-sized experimental platforms, with standard interfaces for power and data acquisition.

=== On-orbit propellant depots ===
In a presentation given 15 November 2005 to the 52nd Annual Conference of the American Astronautical Society, NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin suggested that establishing an on-orbit propellant depot is, &quot;Exactly the type of enterprise which should be left to industry and to the marketplace.&quot; At the Space Technology and Applications International Forum in 2007, Dallas Bienhoff of Boeing made a presentation detailing the benefits of propellant depots. Shackleton Energy Company has established operational plans, an extensive teaming and industrial consortium for developing LEO Propellant Depots supplied by Lunar polar sourced water ice.

=== Asteroid mining ===

Some have speculated on the profitability of mining metal from asteroids. According to some estimates, a one kilometer-diameter asteroid would contain 30 million tons of nickel, 1.5 million tons of metal cobalt and 7,500tons of platinum; the platinum alone would have a value of more than $150 billion at 2008 terrestrial prices.

=== Space elevators ===
A space elevator system is a possible launch system, currently under investigation by at least one private venture. There are concerns over cost, general feasibility and some political issues. On the plus side the potential to scale the system to accommodate traffic would (in theory) be greater than some other alternatives. Some factions contend that a space elevator — if successful — would not supplant existing launch solutions but complement them.

== Non-launched efforts ==

=== Failed spaceflight ventures ===
After earlier first effort of OTRAG, in the 1990s the projection of a significant demand for communications satellite launches attracted the development of a number of commercial space launch providers. The launch demand largely vanished when some of the largest satellite constellations, such as 288 satellite Teledesic network, were never built.

In 1996, NASA selected Lockheed Martin Skunk Works to build the X-33 VentureStar prototype for a single stage to orbit (SSTO) reusable launch vehicle. In 1999, the subscale X-33 prototype&#x27;s composite liquid hydrogen fuel tank failed during testing. At project termination on 31 March 2001, NASA had funded US$912 million of this wedge-shaped spacecraft while Lockheed Martin financed US$357 million of it. The VentureStar was to have been a full-scale commercial space transport operated by Lockheed Martin.

In 1997, Beal Aerospace proposed the BA-2, a low-cost heavy-lift commercial launch vehicle. On 4 March 2000, the BA-2 project tested the largest liquid rocket engine built since the Saturn V. In October 2000, Beal Aerospace ceased operations citing a decision by NASA and the Department of Defense to commit themselves to the development of the competing government-financed EELV program.

In 1998, Rotary Rocket proposed the Roton, a Single Stage to Orbit (SSTO) piloted Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) space transport. A full scale Roton Atmospheric Test Vehicle flew three times in 1999. After spending tens of millions of dollars in development the Roton failed to secure launch contracts and Rotary Rocket ceased operations in 2001.

On 28 September 2006, Jim Benson, SpaceDev founder, announced he was founding Benson Space Company with the intention of being first to market with the safest and lowest cost suborbital personal spaceflight launches, using the vertical takeoff and horizontal landing Dream Chaser vehicle based on the NASA HL-20 Personnel Launch System vehicle.

Excalibur Almaz had plans in 2007 to launch a modernized TKS Spacecraft (for Almaz space station), for tourism and other uses. It was to feature the largest window ever on a spacecraft. Their equipment was never launched, and their hangar facility closed in 2016. It is to be converted into an educational exhibit.

Escape Dynamics operated from 2010 to 2015, with the goal of making single stage to orbit spaceplanes.

In December 2012, the Golden Spike Company announced plans to privately transport space exploration participants to the surface of the Moon and return, beginning as early as 2020, for US$750 million per passenger.

XCOR Aerospace planned to initiate a suborbital commercial spaceflight service with the Lynx rocketplane in 2016 or 2017 at $95,000. The first flights, to be taken by 23 passengers from the Axe Apollo Space Academy, were planned for 2015.

=== Private space stations ===
By 2010, Bigelow Aerospace was developing the &quot;Next-Generation Commercial Space Station&quot;, a private orbital space complex. The space station was to have been constructed of both Sundancer and B330 expandable modules as well as a central docking node, propulsion, solar arrays, and attached crew capsules. Initial launch of space station components was planned for 2014, with portions of the station projected to be available for leased use as early as 2015. , no launches have taken place.

=== Lunar private ventures ===
==== Robotic Lunar-surface missions ====
The following companies and organizations had made initial funded launch commitments for Google Lunar X Prize-related Lunar launches in 2016:

*Moon Express
*SpaceIL
*Synergy Moon
*Team Indus
*Hakuto (ispace)

==== Private Lunar-surface crewed expeditions ====

*Shackleton Energy Company intends to undertake human tended lunar prospecting for water ice. If significant reserves of ice are located, they plan to establish a network of &quot;refueling service stations&quot; in low Earth orbit and on the Moon to process and provide fuel and consumables for commercial and government customers. If the prospecting is successful—ice deposits are located, the appropriate legal regime is in place to support commercial development, and the ice can be extracted — Shackleton proposes to establish a fuel-processing operation on the lunar surface and in propellant depots in Low Earth Orbit. Equipment would melt the ice and purify the water, &quot;electrolyze the water into gaseous hydrogen and oxygen, and then condense the gases into liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen and also process them into hydrogen peroxide, all of which could be used as rocket fuels.&quot;

=== Mars exploration ===
In June 2012, private Dutch non-profit, Mars One, announced a private one-way (no return) human mission to Mars with the aim to establish a permanent human colony on Mars. The plan was to send a communication satellite and pathfinder lander to the planet by 2016 and, after several stages, land four humans on the Martian surface for permanent settlement in 2023. A new set of four astronauts would then arrive every two years.

Mars One has received a variety of criticism, mostly relating to medical, technical and financial feasibility. There are also unverified claims that Mars One is a scam designed to take as much money as possible from donors, including reality show contestants. Many have criticized the project&#x27;s US$6 billion budget as being too low to successfully transport humans to Mars, to the point of being delusional. A similar project study by NASA estimated the cost of such a feat at US$100 billion, although that included transporting the astronauts back to Earth. Objections have also been raised regarding the reality TV project associated with the expedition. Given the transient nature of most reality TV ventures, many believe that as viewership declines, funding could significantly decrease, thereby harming the entire expedition. Further, contestants have reported that they were ranked based on their donations and funds raised.

In February 2013, the US nonprofit Inspiration Mars Foundation announced a plan to send a married couple on a 2018 mission to travel to Mars and back to Earth on a 501-day round trip, with no landing planned on Mars. The mission would have taken advantage of an infrequently occurring free return trajectory—a unique orbit opportunity which occurs only once every fifteen years—and will allow the space capsule to use the smallest possible amount of fuel to get it to Mars and back to Earth. The two-person American crew – a man and a woman – will fly around Mars at a distance of of the surface. &quot;If anything goes wrong, the spacecraft should make its own way back to Earth — but with no possibility of any shortcuts home.&quot;

On September 27, 2016, at the 67th annual meeting of the International Astronautical Congress, Elon Musk unveiled substantial details of the Interplanetary Transport System (ITS) design for the transport vehicles—including size, construction material, number and type of engines, thrust, cargo and passenger payload capabilities, on-orbit propellant-tanker refills, representative transit times, etc.—as well as a few details of portions of the Mars-side and Earth-side infrastructure that SpaceX intends to build to support the flight vehicles. In addition, Musk championed a larger systemic vision, a vision for a bottom-up emergent order of other interested parties—whether companies, individuals, or governments—to utilize the new and radically lower-cost transport infrastructure to build up a sustainable human civilization on Mars, potentially, on numerous other locations around the Solar System, by innovating and meeting the demand that such a growing venture would occasion.

In July 2017, SpaceX made public plans for ITS based on a smaller launch vehicle and spacecraft. The new system architecture has &quot;evolved quite a bit&quot; since the November 2016 articulation of the very large &quot;Interplanetary Transport System&quot;. A key driver of the new architecture is to make the new system useful for substantial Earth-orbit and cislunar launches so that the new system might pay for itself, in part, through economic spaceflight activities in the near-Earth space zone. The Super Heavy is designed to fulfill the Mars transportation goals while also launching satellites, servicing the ISS, flying humans and cargo to the Moon, and enabling ballistic transport of passengers on Earth as a substitute to long-haul airline flights.

Since March 2020, SpaceX conducted several test flights of their Starship spacecraft. The Starship is a fully reusable two-stage vehicle designed to take passengers and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. SpaceX had initially planned to have an orbital-flight in 2021. On Wednesday, May 5, 2021, the twelfth Starship prototype (SN15) made a 10 km suborbital flight and achieved soft landing. SpaceX is currently in the process of improving and understanding the Starship spacecraft.

NewSpace (also new space) or entrepreneurial space and  astropreneurship have been terms applied to contemporary and increasingly competitive spaceflight.

<text>Ernest John Morris OBE (20 June 1916 – 6 May 1999) was a Welsh television presenter and actor. He was known for his children&#x27;s programmes for the BBC on the topic of zoology, most notably &quot;Animal Magic&quot;, and for narrating the &quot;Tales of the Riverbank&quot; series of stories.

==Early life==
Morris was born on 20 June 1916 in Newport, Monmouthshire, Wales, the son of a postmaster. He learned to play the violin as a child and toured the valleys of South Wales, performing with his cello-playing father. Morris attended Eveswell Junior School and then Hatherleigh School, Newport, and worked as a solicitor&#x27;s clerk, a timekeeper on a building site, and a salesman before managing a farm in Aldbourne, Wiltshire for 13 years.

==Radio and television career==
Morris was discovered telling stories in a pub by the then BBC Home Service West Regional producer Desmond Hawkins. Morris made his radio début in 1946, and featured in a number of regional series throughout the 1950s. He was often employed on light entertainment programmes as a storyteller, such as in &quot;Pass the Salt&quot;, or as a commentator on local events.

A natural mimic and impersonator, Morris first appeared on television as &quot;The Hot Chestnut Man&quot; (1953–1961), a short slot in which he was shown sitting roasting chestnuts. He would tell a humorous yarn in a West Country accent, often ending with a moral.

In 1960, he narrated the imported, Canadian-produced &quot;Tales of the Riverbank&quot; series of stories about Hammy the Hamster, Roderick the Rat, GP the Guinea Pig, and their assorted animal friends along a riverbank. The show used slowed-down footage of real animals filmed doing humanised things such as driving a car or boat, and living in houses. In the 1960s Morris also narrated books 1–11 of &quot;The Railway Stories&quot;, recordings of the Railway Series books by the Rev. W. Awdry. The recordings of the first eight books were re-released in LP format in the 1970s but the other three sets of recordings were never reissued and in the end were rerecorded by Willie Rushton. During the 1980s he also recorded a few audiobooks for Sylvanian Families.

Morris&#x27;s ability to create a world which children could relate to through his mimicry led to his best-known television role, that of the presenter, narrator and &#x27;zoo keeper&#x27; for &quot;Animal Magic&quot;. For more than 400 editions, from 1962 until 1983, and with inserts shot at Bristol Zoo Gardens, Morris would create comic dialogues with the animals, whom he also voiced. His regular companion on the show was Dotty the ring-tailed lemur. When the idea of imposing human qualities and voices upon animals fell out of favour the series was discontinued. Morris very rarely worked with spiders, having a phobia that he wished to keep from the public.

Morris carried over his comedic commentary technique into other programmes, such as &quot;Follow the Rhine&quot;, a BBC2 travelogue which included a witty Morris commentary featuring his companion Tubby Foster – actually his producer Brian Patten. &quot;Follow the Rhine&quot; was based on Morris&#x27; earlier BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Jaunts&quot;. These series chronicled not only the Rhine journey but other worldwide journeys and were broadcast between 1957 and 1976. Included in this series were tales based upon his visits to such places as Austria (a skiing misadventure!), Spain, Hong Kong, Japan, USA, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, South America, South Sea Islands, France; and even a cruise on the River Thames.

Morris was Vice President of the Bluebell Railway in Sussex from its early days in the 1960s until the late 1980s, attending several anniversaries and landmark events over the first few decades of the railway&#x27;s existence. He also made two promotional LPs for the railway in the 1970s, one of which was released on the Discourses Label (DCM1209), &#x27;Johnny Morris on the Bluebell Railway&#x27;. He released other recordings, too: &#x27;Sights and Sounds of Britain&#x27;, a 1975 Flexidisc (Lyntone 2881) and &#x27;It&#x27;s a Dog&#x27;s Life&#x27; (Lyntone 2462), a single promoting Winalot dog foods, which, oddly, played at 33⅓ rpm.

In the 1970s, Morris read children&#x27;s bedtime stories for the Post Office to be heard via the telephone. Children could dial 150 and hear a different story over the telephone each week; these included the Peter Pixie stories written by Olive Hyett. He was also a presenter on BBC Schools Radio&#x27;s &quot;Singing Together&quot;, and wrote and read stories on BBC Schools Radio&#x27;s &quot;A Service for Schools&quot; which was later renamed &quot;Together&quot;.

In a nod to his role with &quot;Animal Magic&quot;, Morris also added his voice to the award-winning &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; series of electricity advertisements, created by Aardman Animations. These advertisements featured animated claymation animals speaking about their life and conditions in a way comparable to the dialogues that Morris had created in the earlier television show.

Although latterly criticised in the 1990s for his anthropomorphic technique of introducing television viewers to animals, Morris was active in environmentalism, and in his eighties demonstrated against the building of the Newbury bypass near his home. In June 2004, Morris and Bill Oddie were jointly profiled in the first of a three part BBC Two series, &quot;The Way We Went Wild&quot;, about television wildlife presenters.

Morris was awarded the OBE in 1984. His autobiography, &quot;There&#x27;s Lovely&quot;, was first published in 1989.

==Death==
A diabetic, Morris collapsed at his home in Hungerford, Berkshire, in March 1999 when he was about to star in a new animal series &quot;Wild Thing&quot; on ITV. Admitted to the Princess Margaret Hospital, Swindon, Wiltshire for tests, he was discharged to a nursing home in the Devizes and Marlborough district, where he died on 6 May 1999.

His wife, Eileen, had pre-deceased him by 10 years; he had two stepsons. He bequeathed his house to his co-host on &quot;Animal Magic&quot;, Terry Nutkins; a large sum of cash to his housekeeper, Rita Offer; and smaller sums to his gardener and his builder but he left nothing to his stepsons, his step-grandchildren and step-great-grandchildren – possibly because a failed business partnership had cost him £500,000.

==Bibliography==
Morris was also a writer. His books include:
*&quot;Just Like you and Me&quot; – 
*&quot;Around the World in Twenty Five Years&quot; – (also a BBC radio series)

==History==
On November 28, 1887, Kihachiro Okura and Eiichi Shibusawa submitted an application to form a new company called Yugen Sekinin Tokyo Hoteru (Tokyo Hotel Co.), in order to &quot;build a large hotel in Tokyo and to conduct the business of renting rooms to foreign guests, and for parties and other events...&quot; There were initially 21 investors, with the largest (21.15%) being the Imperial Household Ministry. Site preparation for the first Imperial Hotel started in July 1888, and construction began in the fall of that year. On 7 July 1890, with the hotel almost complete, the name was changed to Yugen Sekinen Teikoku Hoteru Kaisha (Imperial Hotel Ltd.).

On January 25, 1907, the Kabushiki Kaisha Hoteru Metropole (Hotel Metropole Ltd.) merged with the Teikoku Hoteru Kabushiki Kaisha (Imperial Hotel Ltd.) and the combined company name was changed to Kabushiki Kaisha Teikoku Hoteru (still Imperial Hotel Ltd. when translated to English).

<doc id="752744" wikidata="Q2069748" url="?curid=752744" title="Lifes Rich Pageant">
<text>Lifes Rich Pageant is the fourth studio album by the American alternative rock band R.E.M., released on July 28, 1986. R.E.M. chose Don Gehman to produce the album, which was recorded at John Mellencamp&#x27;s Belmont Mall Studio in Belmont, Indiana. This was the only album the band recorded with Gehman, who moved them from the more obscure and dense sound of their earlier albums to an accessible, hard rock-influenced quality. The album was well-received critically.
==Music==
The ecologically minded &quot;Cuyahoga&quot; refers to the once heavily polluted Cuyahoga River that flows into Lake Erie at Cleveland, Ohio. The song includes the lyric &quot;we burned the river down&quot;, which refers to the several occasions (most famously in 1969) when the river actually caught fire.

At the end of &quot;Just a Touch&quot; frontman Michael Stipe can be heard screaming the line &quot;I&#x27;m so young, I&#x27;m so goddamn young&quot;, quoting longtime influence Patti Smith&#x27;s live cover version of The Who&#x27;s &quot;My Generation&quot; released on the B-side of her 1976 single &quot;Gloria&quot;, which she also uses at the end of her cover version of &quot;Privilege (Set Me Free)&quot; from her 1978 album &quot;Easter&quot;.

== Recording and production ==
During the first half of 1986, the band took a break from touring to recover energy. They wanted to make a change from the sound of their previous album, with Mills saying &quot;We wanted to get away from the sort of murky feelings and sounds that we got out of Joe Boyd, producer on &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot;] in London&quot;. They wanted a &quot;really hard-driving record, but we also like to throw in a lot of things: pianos and organs and accordions and banjos and what-not&quot; and considered working with Gehman as they liked the acoustic sound of his work with John Mellencamp. They initially met for a number of demo sessions at John Keane&#x27;s Studio in Athens, Georgia, in January &amp; March 1986 (These recordings would later be released as the &quot;Athens Demos&quot; on the 25th anniversary re-release of the album). After being initially skeptical, they embraced the new recording process with Gehman later stating that:&quot;I liked to spend time on the arrangement and layer in the overdubs and comp the vocals—all this process which, to me, was normal record-making, they had never been through before. When they saw that kind of record-making process didn&#x27;t take anything away—that it actually added another level of artistic expression—they were very excited by it.&quot;The album was recorded at Mellencamp&#x27;s Belmont Mall Recording Studio in Belmont, Indiana, in April and May 1986. The recording studio was larger and had newer technology than they were used to, and they enjoyed the area, attending many concerts in nearby Bloomington while there. The band were also happy with the production of the record and the extra clarity of the vocals, bassist Mike Mills saying:&quot;Don (Gehman, the album&#x27;s producer) is good at layering things so there can be a lot of things going on but you can still hear everything. And as far as Michael&#x27;s vocals go, it&#x27;s a combination of things: Michael is getting better at what he&#x27;s doing, and he&#x27;s getting more confident at it. And I think that shows up in the projection of his voice. The overall sound of everything was so good, we didn&#x27;t mind having the vocals mixed as loud as they were.&quot;

== Packaging ==
The album title is based on an English idiom. Its use is very old, but R.E.M.&#x27;s use is, according to guitarist Peter Buck, from the 1964 film &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot;, minus the apostrophe:
:&quot;Inspector Clouseau opens a car door, falling into a fountain.&quot;
:Maria: &quot;You should get out of these clothes immediately. You&#x27;ll catch your death of pneumonia, you will.&quot;
:Clouseau: &quot;Yes, I probably will. But it&#x27;s all part of life&#x27;s rich pageant, you know?&quot;

The cover of the album is a photograph of drummer Bill Berry, on the upper half, and a pair of bison, signifying an environmental theme, on the lower half. It also alludes to Buffalo Bill.

== Release ==
With R.E.M.&#x27;s fan base beginning to grow beyond its college rock boundaries, &quot;Lifes Rich Pageant&quot; proved at the time to be the band&#x27;s most commercially successful album in the United States, peaking at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and heralding the band&#x27;s first gold record. In the UK, the album managed a number 43 peak.

The ecologically conscious &quot;Fall on Me&quot; (a personal favorite of Michael Stipe) and a cover of the Clique&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot;, sung by Mike Mills, were the only singles released from the album (the single version of the latter removed the sample from one of the Godzilla movies that began the album version).

==Reception==
 &quot;PopMatters&quot; included it in their list of the &quot;12 Essential 1980s Alternative Rock Albums&quot;. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at #52 on its list of &quot;Best Albums of 1980s&quot; saying &quot;Lifes Rich Pageant stands as a nearly seamless transition between the band&#x27;s formative period and their commercial dominance.&quot; In 2000, it ranked at number 162 in the list of Virgin&#x27;s All-Time Album Top 1000 List.

Anthony DeCurtis, writing a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, called it &quot;brilliant and groundbreaking, if modestly flawed&quot;, praising it as &quot;the most outward looking record R.E.M. has made.&quot; He found that it &quot;carries on... the dark Southern folk artistry of last year&#x27;s &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot;&quot; and &quot;paints a swirling, impressionistic portrait of a country at the moral crossroads&quot;. Robert Christgau gave the album B+ in a dismissive review that complained of a lack of progress from earlier albums.

Retrospective reviews of the album in the context of the band&#x27;s later work (beginning with the following original studio album, &quot;Document&quot;) have been positive. Gavin Edwards, writing in 2003, gave it four stars, praising &quot;Fall on Me&quot; in particular as &quot;the finest song in the R.E.M. canon. A lullaby of modern anxiety, it&#x27;s flexible enough to serve as a potent metaphor for acid rain, nuclear warfare, satellite surveillance or any other modern phobia you choose&quot;. Stephen Deusner, writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, calls it &quot;invigorating&quot;, citing it as R.E.M.&#x27;s first transitional album, simultaneously their &quot;most pop-oriented and accessible album up to that point&quot; and &quot;most overtly political collection, with songs addressing environmental crises and political malaise&quot;. Alexis Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; says it &quot;may represent the band at their absolute zenith... imbued with a swaggering confidence absent from its murky predecessor&quot;. Petridis also singles out &quot;Fall on Me&quot; for its &quot;beautiful opacity&quot; and the &quot;sumptuousness of its melody&quot;. Andrew Mueller in &quot;Uncut&quot; argues that it represents R.E.M. embracing the mainstream: &quot;For the first time, it had occurred to REM that they had a constituency – and, indeed, that it might be possible and desirable to build on that&quot; with an album where &quot;Every note... fizzes and crackles with the urgency of people who’ve made their minds up&quot;.

Both DeCurtis and Deusner praise the production work of Don Gehman, comparing it favorably to their previous album &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot;. DeCurtis said Gehman &quot;has done an outstanding job of hardening R.E.M.’s sonic jolt&quot; while Deusner stated of Gehman that by &quot;giving the melodic leads their own space, he emphasizes the muscle in Berry&#x27;s beats and the intricate interaction between the rhythm section&quot;.

<doc id="752749" wikidata="Q1372144" url="?curid=752749" title="Sausage casing">
<text>Sausage casing, also known as sausage skin or simply casing, is the material that encloses the filling of a sausage. Natural casings are made from animal intestines or skin; artificial casings, introduced in the early 20th century, are made of collagen and cellulose. The material is then shaped via a continuous extrusion process—producing a single sausage casing of indefinite length—which is then cut into desired lengths, usually while the extrusion process continues.

==Natural casings==

=== Origin ===

Natural sausage casings are made from the sub-mucosa of the small intestine of meat animals, a layer of the intestine that consists mainly of naturally occurring collagen. In Western European cuisine and Chinese cuisine, most casings come from pigs, but elsewhere the intestines of sheep, goats, cattle and sometimes horses are also used. To prepare the intestines as casings, they are flushed, scraped and cleaned with water and salt by hand or with machinery; today they are primarily machine cleaned. The outer fat and the inner mucosa lining are removed during processing. They are salted to lower the water activity (which inhibits microbial growth) and preserve the casing. Natural casings have been used in the production of meat specialties for centuries and have remained virtually unchanged in function, appearance, and composition. US and EU organic food regulations only allow natural casings, which can be derived from non-organically raised animals as there are no large scale slaughter plants which handle and process only organic animals and sell their casings as certified organic casings. As a result, all large scale natural casing companies buy casings from around the world and send them to their selection facilities to be graded and packaged. There are four primary animal genera which are used to manufacture natural casings (although all mammals raised for meat could potentially be used to produce natural casing): cows, pigs, and lambs and sheep.

=== Appearance ===

Natural casing sausages are distinguishable from collagen or cellulose casings because of their irregularity, although high quality sheep and lamb casings can be almost indistinguishable from a collagen casing as they have no noticeable imperfections. The main difference is in the way they are twisted and linked which impacts the appearance of the final product and makes it easy to differentiate a hot dog using natural sheep or lamb casing vs collagen casing. The size and usage of natural casings are impacted by the animal they are derived from, the narrowest being lamb followed by sheep followed by pig followed by beef. The size range for lamb is 14 mm to 28 mm in diameter (which is how casings are graded), the size range for sheep is 16 mm to 32 mm in diameter, the size range for pig is 28 mm to 58 mm in diameter, the size range for beef is 43 mm to 65 mm, although beef bung caps (which are not derived from the small intestine) have a size range of 115 mm to 130 mm.

=== Processing ===

The process begins at the slaughter plant where &quot;green&quot; (uncleaned) runners (ungraded casings) are removed from the animal during the slaughter process. They are subsequently cleaned, which involves breaking the inner mucosa, usually with a machine that the runners go through and rollers to break the inner mucosa so it can be flushed out and removed. The cleaning process can also be done by hand but primarily casings are machine cleaned. This is a very water intensive process as the casings are vigorously flushed with cold water to remove blood from the mucosa which if not properly flushed during the initial processing can lead to &quot;staining&quot; of the casing where it becomes pink. The cleaned runners are then tied in bundles and packed in plastic drums and filled with a saturated salt brine for preservation. The runners are then sold to a company which processes natural casings by grading and packaging them to create finished units called hanks.
Natural casings are produced and sold almost exclusively by the hank which is a unit of measure that is 91 meters long. A hank can consist of a varying number of strands (individual pieces of casing) which vary in length from 2 meters (which is the shortest length sold for commercial use) to as long as 28 meters. Each casing manufacturer has various &quot;put ups&quot; which dictate the maximum number of strands and the minimum length of each strand allowed in the put up. Casings are selected for size which is measured in millimeters and refers to the diameter of the casing; this is done exclusively by hand and is primarily done in China due to the availability of low cost labor. Commercially casings are available in various forms of packaging which are suited to different applications. Sheep/lamb and hog are available in all packaging types due to the high demand and long length of pieces; due to the shorter length and much lower demand for beef casings they are primarily only available loose or in net packs either salted or in brine.

=== Packaging ===

Sheep and lamb and hog casings are available &quot;tubed&quot; where each strand is put on a plastic tube which allows the sausage maker to easily place the casing on the stuffing horn; in recent years these tubes have been modified so they break open along a seam and the operator can pull them out at the back of the horn allowing greater efficiency; these are referred to in the industry as &quot;zip tubes&quot;, due to the zipper-like nature of the seam. These tubed casings are then packed in plastic nets, usually two per net, and packed in plastic drums, which are then filled with a saturated salt brine, usually 200 per drum. These are available in all diameters and in lengths greater than 3 meters (as 2-meter or shorter pieces are cost prohibitive to tube).

Sheep, lamb, and hog casings are also available loose in brine in a vacuum sealed plastic pack; commonly referred to as &quot;vacuum packs&quot;, these are primarily used by small- to medium-sized sausage makers who use less than 100 hanks per month of casing. The appeal of vacuum packs is the ease of use, their shorter strand length for hand stuffing (all sausage makers who do not use automatic sausage stuffing and linking machines) and their shelf life; they only need to be opened as needed so the sausage maker does not need to worry that they will not use their opened casings prior to a decrease in quality. These are available in all diameters and in put ups from short up to medium length, about 6 meter minimum, with a maximum length of about 14 meters.

Sheep and lamb and hog are also available in a net, commonly referred to as net pack. These are available salted or in brine and they are primarily used by medium to large sausage makers who do not want to pay the additional cost for the tubed casing and do not have automatic sausage stuffing and linking machines (which require tubed casings to operate efficiently). These are available in all diameters and in lengths greater than 2 meters (as that is the shortest length sold for commercial use).

Beef casings are primarily available only salted or in brine. They are measured in sets, not hanks, and the length is 32 meters; this is for beef &quot;rounds&quot; and &quot;middles&quot; only, as beef bung caps are only about 1 meter in length.

==Artificial casings==

Artificial casings are made of collagen (often derived from cattle skin), cellulose, or plastic. Artificial casings from animal collagen are generally edible, though some are not.

===Collagen casings===

Collagen casings are mainly produced from the collagen in beef or pig hides, and the bones and tendons. It can also be derived from poultry and fish. They have been made for more than 50 years and their share of the market has been increasing. Usually the cost to produce sausages in collagen is significantly lower than making sausages in gut because of higher production speeds and lower labor requirements.

The collagen for artificial casings is processed extensively. It is formed by extrusion through a die to the desired diameter, dried and shirred into short sticks up to long that contain as much as of casing. In a newer process, a form of dough is coextruded with the meat blend, and a coating is formed by treating the outside with a calcium solution to set the coating.

The latest generation of collagen casings are usually more tender than natural casings and do not exhibit the &quot;snap&quot; or &quot;bite&quot; of natural casing sausages. Most collagen casings are edible, but a special form of thicker collagen casings is used for salamis and large caliber sausages where the casing is usually peeled off the sausage by the consumer. Collagen casings are less expensive to use, give better weight and size control, and are easier to run when compared to natural casings.

=== Vegetarian casings ===
Some innovative coextrusion processes have been developed in recent years, allowing 100% plant-based vegetarian casings to be created. Some special alginate coextrusion equipment is required to make casings that can be used in halal or kosher food making.

==Inedible casings==

Casings made from cellulose and plastics are peeled off food products and are not eaten.

===Cellulose casings===

Cellulose, usually from cotton linters or wood pulp, is processed to make viscose, which is then extruded into clear, tough casings for making wieners and franks. They also are shirred for easier use and can be treated with dye to make &quot;red hots&quot;. The casing is peeled off after cooking, resulting in &quot;skinless&quot; franks. Cellulosic viscose solutions are combined with wood or for example abaca pulp to make large diameter fibrous casings for bologna, cotto salami, smoked ham and other products sliced for sandwiches. This type is also permeable to smoke and water vapor. They can be flat or shirred, depending on application, and can be pretreated with smoke, caramel color, or other surface treatments.

===Plastic casings===
Plastic casings are not eaten. They also can be flat or shirred. Generally, smoke and water cannot pass through the casing, so plastic is used for non-smoked products where high yields are expected. The inner surface can be laminated or co-extruded with a polymer with an affinity for meat protein causing the meat to stick to the film, resulting in some loss when the casing is peeled, but higher overall yield due to better moisture control.

Plastic casings are generally made from polymers such as polyamide, polypropylene, or polyethylene. Polyamide (Nylon) plastic casings are the most commonly used in production of cooked sausages and hams such as luncheon meat and bologna. Polyamide casings come in two main varieties: Oriented and non-oriented. The oriented polyamide are shrinkable casings and will shrink during the cooking process thereby reducing the water loss. Non-oriented polyamide casings remain the same diameter during the cooking process and thereby allow for expansion of the meat during cooking. The use of polyamide casings has expanded recently with the advent of various varieties and structures of casings such as multilayer casings.

<doc id="752750" wikidata="Q2482051" url="?curid=752750" title="Dead Letter Office (album)">
<text>Dead Letter Office is a rarities and B-sides collection by R.E.M., released in April 1987. The album is essentially a collection of many additional recordings R.E.M. made from before &quot;Murmur&quot; to &quot;Lifes Rich Pageant&quot; that were outtakes or released as B-sides to their singles internationally. Many of the tracks are favorite cover versions indicating the band&#x27;s disparate influences and musical tastes, including three Velvet Underground covers, and songs by Aerosmith (&quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;), Roger Miller (&quot;King of the Road&quot;), and fellow Athenians Pylon (&quot;Crazy&quot;).

Guitarist Peter Buck composed wry, self-deprecating (and, in one instance, apologetic) liner notes to the songs on the album. Buck initially had doubts about releasing it, saying he felt as though people would perceive the album as the band &quot;trying to cash in, maybe to sell some records&quot;, as the ultimate release date predated that of the band&#x27;s final studio album with I.R.S., &quot;Document&quot;, by a mere four months.

The album was initially issued as a 15-song collection on vinyl and cassette, but when its CD edition appeared the five tracks from the band&#x27;s 1982 &quot;Chronic Town&quot; EP were added. This was the only CD availability of &quot;Chronic Town&quot; until the release of &quot;The Originals&quot; box set.

Notes
* Features the backing track of &quot;7 Chinese Bros.&quot; (from &quot;Reckoning&quot;) with Stipe&#x27;s singing the liner notes from the back cover of a gospel album &quot;The Joy of Knowing Jesus&quot; by The Revelaires.
* Buck says &quot;Walter&#x27;s Theme&quot; and &quot;King of the Road&quot; were recorded extemporaneously during a recording session while the band was drunk. The songs were recorded at the end of a tryout session with Elliot Mazer in 1983 before the recording of &quot;Reckoning&quot;. In &quot;Walter&#x27;s Theme&quot;, Stipe refers to the Pere Ubu song &quot;Lonesome Cowboy Dave&quot; (&quot;I got a hat the size of Oklahoma!&quot;); &quot;King of the Road&quot; consists mostly of Stipe&#x27;s fumbling through the lyrics (&quot;I&#x27;m a man, a man by no means&quot;) as Buck and Mills try to arrive at the same key (both can be heard yelling chord names at each other).
* Studio outtake, as listed on &quot;And I Feel Fine... The Best of the I.R.S. Years 1982–1987&quot;.

<text>Arthur Louis Hugo Rudolph (November 9, 1906 – January 1, 1996) was a German rocket engineer who was a leader of the effort to develop the V-2 rocket for Nazi Germany. After World War II, the United States government&#x27;s Office of Strategic Services (OSS) brought him to the U.S. as part of the clandestine Operation Paperclip, where he became one of the main developers of the U.S. space program. He worked within the U.S. Army and NASA, where he managed the development of several systems, including the Pershing missile and the Saturn V Moon rocket. In 1984, the U.S. government investigated him for war crimes, and he agreed to renounce his United States citizenship and leave the U.S. in return for not being prosecuted.

==Early life==
Rudolph was born in Stepfershausen, Meiningen, Germany, in 1906. His family were farmers, with a long tradition in the area. His father Gustav died in 1915 while serving in World War I. Arthur and his younger brother Walter were raised by their mother, Ida. When Ida noticed young Arthur had a mechanical gift, she decided he should attend technical training. Walter inherited the family farm. From 1921 on, Rudolph attended the technical school in Schmalkalden for three years. In 1924 he found employment at a silver goods factory in Bremen.

==Initial work on rocket engines==
In August 1927 Rudolph accepted a job at Stock &amp; Co. in Berlin. After a few months, he became a toolmaker at Fritz Werner. In 1928 he attended the Technische Hochschule Berlin— now Technische Universität Berlin —graduating in 1930 with the equivalent of a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering. On May 1, 1930, Rudolph began working for the Heylandt Works in Berlin where he met rocketry pioneer Max Valier. Valier had use of the factory grounds for his experiments in rocketry and Rudolph became interested, working with Valier in his spare time along with Walter Riedel. Rudolph already had some interest in rocketry, having read &quot;Wege zur Raumschiffahrt&quot; (&quot;Ways to Spaceflight&quot;) by Hermann Oberth and having seen the 1929 film &quot;Woman in the Moon&quot;.

On May 17, an experimental engine exploded and killed Valier. Dr. Paulus Heylandt forbade further rocket research, but Rudolph continued secretly with Riedel and Alfons Pietsch. Rudolph then developed an improved and safer version of Valier&#x27;s engine while Pietsch designed a rocket car. Dr. Heylandt conceded to back the project, and the &quot;Heylandt Rocket Car&quot; was born and was exhibited at Tempelhof Aerodrome. While it was a technical success, the fuel costs were greater than the admissions received and performances were discontinued. Rudolph joined the Nazi Party in 1931, then later the SA.

Rudolph first met Wernher von Braun when he visited a meeting of the &quot;Verein für Raumschiffahrt&quot; (VfR, the &quot;Spaceflight Society&quot;). In May 1932 Rudolph was laid off and looking for work when he encountered Pietsch. After forming a partnership Rudolph began design on a new engine, while Pietsch looked for a backer. Pietsch met with Walter Dornberger, who had been tasked by the German Ordnance Department to develop a rocket weapons system and had become interested in the VfR.

After demonstrating the new engine to Dornberger, Rudolph moved to the proving grounds at Kummersdorf along with Riedel, and began working under von Braun. Rudolph&#x27;s engine was used in the Aggregat series of rockets. In December 1934, the von Braun team successfully launched two A-2 rockets from the island of Borkum. Static testing on the A-3 engines began in Kummersdorf in late 1936 and were observed by General Werner von Fritsch, the commander-in chief of the German Army High Command.

The Kummersdorf facilities were inadequate for continued operations, so the von Braun team was moved to Peenemünde in May 1937 where Rudolph was tasked with the building of the A-3 test stand. The Rudolphs lived in nearby Zinnowitz, where their daughter, Marianne Erika, was born on November 26, 1937. The A-3 series was plagued with guidance problems and never proved successful. In early 1938, Dornberger put Rudolph in charge of the design for the new production plant to be built at Peenemünde for the A-4 series, later renamed the V-2 (Vergeltungswaffe-&quot;Reprisal Weapon&quot;-2).

==World War II==
In August 1943, as Rudolph was ready to begin production of the V-2, the British bombed Peenemünde. After Peenemünde was bombed, the V-2 production facility was moved to the Mittelwerk facility, which was near Nordhausen and underground.

Mittelwerk was originally a gypsum mine that was being used as a storage facility and was being excavated for production facilities. The labor force consisted of prisoners who were eventually housed at the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. Rudolph was in charge of moving the equipment from Peenemünde to Mittelwerk, working under Albin Sawatzki. After the plant was in place, Rudolph was operations director for V-2 missile production. Sawatzki decreed that fifty were to be produced in December. Given the labor and parts issues, Rudolph was barely able to produce four rockets that were later returned from Peenemünde as defective. There are estimates that approximately 20,000 laborers died while building the V-2 rockets at Mittelwerk, more than the V-2 killed in bombardments.

In 1944, Himmler convinced Hitler to put the V-2 project directly under SS control, and in August replaced Dornberger with SS General Hans Kammler as its director.

In January 1945 the SS ordered all of the civilians and prisoners, including Rudolph and his team, to attend a public hanging of six to twelve prisoners accused of sabotage. By March 1945, production had stopped due to a lack of parts and Rudolph and his staff were moved to Oberammergau where they met von Braun and others from Peenemünde. They finally surrendered to the U.S. Army and were transported to Garmisch.

==Recruitment into services of Allied powers and move to United States==

Rudolph was transferred to the British to participate in Operation Backfire from July to October 1945. He was then transferred back to the Americans. The U.S. Army picked up Martha and Marianne Rudolph from Stepfershausen before it was occupied by the Red Army and the Rudolphs were reunited at Camp Overcast near Landshut. In November 1945, Operation Overcast brought Rudolph, von Braun and the rest of the V-2 team temporarily to the US for six months. Overcast was renamed Operation Paperclip in March 1946 and formally approved by President Truman in August 1946 and most of the group stayed permanently.

After a brief interrogation at Fort Strong, the team was sent to White Sands Proving Grounds to work on further V-2 engineering in January 1946. In January 1947 Rudolph was moved to the Ordnance Research and Development Division at Fort Bliss, El Paso, Texas, where his family finally joined him in April. Since he had been brought into the US without a visa, he and others were sent to Juárez, Mexico, where he obtained a visa and officially immigrated to the U.S. on April 14, 1949. During his time at Fort Bliss, he acted as a liaison to the Solar Aircraft Company, and spent much of 1947 and 1949 in San Diego, California.

During a 1949 inquiry by the FBI, Rudolph made the following statement on his participation in the Nazi party:
Until 1930 I sympathized with the Social Democratic party, voted for it and was a member of a Social Democratic union (Bund Techn. Agst. u. Beamt.) After 1930 the economic situation became so serious that it appeared to me to be headed for catastrophe. (I really became unemployed in 1932.) The great amount of unemployment caused the expansion of National Socialist and Communist parties. Frightened that the latter one would become the government I joined the NSDAP (a legally reg. entity) to help, I believed in the preservation of western culture.

On June 25, 1950, Rudolph was transferred to Redstone Arsenal, Huntsville, Alabama, and his group was re-designated as the Ordnance Guided Missile Center. He was naturalized as an American citizen on November 11, 1954, in Birmingham, Alabama. In 1950 Rudolph was appointed as the technical director for the Redstone missile project. Rudolph was assigned as the project manager for the Pershing missile project in 1956. He specifically selected The Martin Company as the prime contractor for the program. He also chose the Eclipse-Pioneer division of Bendix to develop the guidance system after he personally inspected the plant in Teterboro, New Jersey.

Rudolph received an honorary doctorate of science degree from Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, on February 23, 1959. He received the Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service, the highest Army award for civilians, for his work on Pershing.

==NASA==
Although von Braun and his team had been transferred to NASA in 1960, Rudolph stayed with ABMA to continue critical work on Pershing. In 1961 he finally moved to NASA, once again working for von Braun. He became the assistant director of systems engineering, serving as liaison between vehicle development at Marshall Space Flight Center and the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston. He later became the project director of the Saturn V rocket program in August 1963. He developed the requirements for the rocket system and the mission plan for the Apollo program. The first Saturn V launch lifted off from Kennedy Space Center and performed flawlessly on November 9, 1967, Rudolph&#x27;s birthday. He was then assigned as the special assistant to the director of MSFC in May 1968 and subsequently retired from NASA on January 1, 1969. During his tenure he was awarded the NASA Exceptional Service Medal and the NASA Distinguished Service Medal. On July 16, 1969, the Saturn V launched Apollo 11, putting man on the Moon.

==Denaturalization and departure to West Germany==
In 1979, Eli Rosenbaum of the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) by chance read about Rudolph in a book about moving rocket parts using forced labor. Rosenbaum had conducted research at the National Archives, about the Dora war crimes trial, appearing to connect Rudolph with the use of forced labor at Mittelwerk.
In September 1982, Rudolph received a letter requesting an interview by the OSI.
Rudolph believed this was one of the series of interrogations he had gone through since his arrival in the U.S. The first of three interviews, it centered on his attitudes on racial superiority, his early participation in the Nazi Party and a possible role in the treatment of prisoners at Mittelwerk.

On November 28, 1983, Rudolph, purportedly, according to his attorneys, under duress and fearful for the welfare of his wife and daughter, signed an agreement with the OSI stating that he would leave the United States and renounce his United States citizenship. Under the agreement, Rudolph would not be prosecuted, the citizenship of his wife and daughter was not in danger of revocation and Rudolph&#x27;s retirement and Social Security benefits were left intact. In March 1984 Arthur and Martha Rudolph departed for West Germany where Rudolph renounced his citizenship as agreed. West Germany protested to the United States Department of State, as Rudolph now had no citizenship in any country. In July, West Germany requested documentation from the OSI to determine if Rudolph should be prosecuted or granted citizenship. The World Jewish Congress placed articles in newspapers in January 1985 on behalf of the Department of Justice, searching for survivors of the Mittelwerk.

After receiving documentation in April 1985, the case was investigated by Harald Duhn, the Attorney General of Hamburg. In March 1987, the investigation concluded after questioning a number of witnesses and determining no basis for prosecution, since the only crime which had not passed the statute of limitations was murder. Rudolph was granted West German citizenship.

Meanwhile, a great deal of controversy occurred back in the United States. Rudolph had not told his friends of the investigation, but the OSI issued a press release after his departure. Several groups and individuals were calling for an investigation into the OSI&#x27;s activities regarding Rudolph. These included retired Major General John Medaris (former commander of ABMA), officials of the city of Huntsville, the American Legion and former associates at NASA. Thomas Franklin interviewed Rudolph and wrote a series of articles in the now-defunct &quot;Huntsville News&quot; that questioned the OSI investigation– these were later used as the basis for &quot;An American in Exile: The Story of Arthur Rudolph&quot;.

In 1985, Representative Bill Green of New York introduced a bill to strip Rudolph of the NASA Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) and re-introduced it in 1987. Rudolph applied for a visa in 1989 to attend a 20th anniversary celebration of the first Moon landing, but was denied by the State Department. In May 1990, Representative James Traficant of Ohio submitted a motion calling for hearings to determine whether the OSI was &quot;justified in its actions or violated the rights of Arthur Rudolph.&quot; The motion failed to receive any co-sponsors and was referred to the Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees, and International Law in June, with no further action taken.

In July the Rudolphs entered Canada for a reunion with their daughter. Since the OSI had placed Rudolph on a watch list, he was detained and left Canada of his own accord. Holocaust-denier Ernst Zündel and Paul Fromm attempted to support Rudolph with demonstrations. After Rudolph left, an immigration hearing was held in his absence; he was represented by Barbara Kulaszka, but Canadian authorities ruled that he could not return to Canada. Rudolph sued to regain his U.S. citizenship, but the case was dismissed in 1993.

In November 1996, Martha Rudolph wrote to Henry Hyde, then chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. She stated that her husband had signed the agreement after coercion and duress by the OSI and that she was dismayed by the House resolutions to strip her husband of the DSM. Rudolph continued to be defended by Pat Buchanan, Lyndon LaRouche and Friedwardt Winterberg. He was also defended by Holocaust deniers like Robert H. Countess and Martin Hollmann.

==Personal life==
Rudolph married Martha Therese Kohls (July 5, 1905 – January 3, 1999) on October 3, 1935, in Berlin. Soon after moving back to Germany, he had a heart attack and a triple bypass. Arthur Rudolph died in Hamburg on January 1, 1996, from heart failure.

==In popular culture==
The character of Hans Udet in the novel &quot;Voyage&quot; by Stephen Baxter is based on Rudolph. Udet is described as a senior member of von Braun&#x27;s V-2 team at the Mittelwerk and as the director of the Saturn V project. Near the end of the novel Udet faces charges on war crimes, renounces his citizenship and returns to Germany.

Rudolph&#x27;s name is linked to several conspiracy theories, particularly UFOs and Area 51.

<doc id="752752" wikidata="Q7186331" url="?curid=752752" title="Phinda Private Game Reserve">
<text>Phinda Private Game Reserve (), formerly known as Phinda Resource Reserve, is a private game reserve situated in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, between the Mkuze Game Reserve and the iSimangaliso Wetland Park. Designated in 1990, Phinda is derived from a Zulu phrase &quot;Phinda Izilwane&quot; meaning &#x27;do again&#x27;, or more poetically &#x27;return of wildlife&#x27;.

Phinda has seven distinct ecosystems ranging from palm savannah and mountain bush to rare sand forest and dense thornveld. In 1992 the reserve joined with two neighboring land owners to create the Mun-Ya-Wana Game Reserve. Through various land expansion projects, acquisitions, and agreements with local communities, the conservancy has grown to . 

The original idea for Phinda was developed by Kevin Leo-Smith in 1986, when his company Agri-Plan Estates was offered the core Phinda South farm then known as Zulu Nyala, for sale. A deeds and map search showed that Zulu Nyala strategically lay between the Mkuze and Lake St. Lucia Game Reserves. Kevin Leo-Smith was then joined by Trevor Coppen, a lawyer and entrepreneur from Durban and later by Andrew Montgomery, a town planner and the concept of acquiring farm land and reintroducing big game was further developed. In 1989, after several failed attempts to secure the capital required, Alan Bernstein joined the group and worked on the business plan and capital raising strategy. Alan Bernstein and Jane Edge asked Dave Varty of Londolozi to join the founding group to add his safari tourism expertise to the founders.

After several false starts the required capital was raised through the Master Bond Group and the core farms, now collectively known as Phinda North, were acquired and the Phinda Resource Reserve was born in early 1990. Master Bond later ran into liquidity problems before the first lodge, then known as Phinda Nyala (now Mountain Lodge), was fully complete. Alan Bernstein was already busy with refinancing the business through an investment banking team from Hambros Bank in London led by Jonathan Klein. With Hambros enough capital was raised to rescue Phinda from what was a near disaster to found the Conservation Corporation Africa (CC Africa). The core investors included the Getty Family and various Anglo-American entities and private individuals. Phinda was a subsidiary of CC Africa.

CC Africa then rapidly expanded adding Ngala Lodge, the first private lodge in the Kruger National Park, as well as building Phinda Forest Lodge and adding a management contract with Londolozi before expanding into East Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana. By the late 1990s all the original founding group were no longer with the holding company and the name was changed from The Conservation Corporation Africa to &amp;Beyond. 

Phinda pioneered the use of release bomas for predator reintroductions and also how to handle adult elephant that escaped with only locally available machinery and equipment that changed the way elephant were handled in capture operations. However, Phinda&#x27;s legacy is proving that restocking agricultural land with wildlife managed on a sustainable basis was way more economically viable than agriculture. The land value at acquisition in early 1990 averaged R1,250/ha and today similar land in the Munyawana Game Reserve of which Phinda is a core part sells for prices in excess of R50,000/ha (2023). This represents a return well in excess of 20% per annum for over 30 years. 

As of May 2020, the South African company WildEarth have broadcast drives from Phinda in collaboration with &amp;Beyond. 

==Fauna==
Wildlife inhabiting this reserve include elephant, giraffe, zebra, lion, African wild dog, blue wildebeest, Cape buffalo, hippopotamus, southern white rhinoceros, south-central black rhinoceros, suni, spotted hyena, cheetah and leopard. 

== Lodges ==
*Forest Lodge – sixteen stilted glass chalets. These chalets are hand built by local Zulu people to minimize impact on the rare Sand Forest. They seem to float between the forest floor and the towering torchwood trees.
*Mountain Lodge – twenty chalets and conference facilities situated at the top of a lavish bushveld world, with panoramas of the Lebombo Mountains and the Lake St. Lucia coastal plains.
*Vlei Lodge – six stilted suites of thatch, teak and glass overlook Phinda&#x27;s unique wetland system at the edge of the forest.
*Rock Lodge – six chalets built into the rock face overlooking the Leopard Rock.
*Zuka Lodge – situated in the western region of Phinda are four thatched Zululand bush cottages. The cottages are set 15 metres apart and feature verandas overlooking a busy waterhole.
*Homestead – an exclusive use 4-bedroom villa.

<text>Duncan &quot;Dougal&quot; Curdy MacSporran Haston (19 April 1940 – 17 January 1977) was a Scottish mountaineer noted for his exploits in the British Isles, Alps, and the Himalayas. From 1967 he was the director of the International School of Mountaineering at Leysin, Switzerland, a role he held until his death in an avalanche while skiing above Leysin.

==Biography==

Haston was born in Currie, on the outskirts of Edinburgh, and educated at West Calder High School. Early in his career, he climbed numerous new Scottish routes with Robin Smith. Routes such as The Bat on the Carn Dearg Buttress of Ben Nevis helped establish the pair as future stars. Smith died in an accident in 1962. In 1965, shortly before his ascent of Harlin Direct on the Eiger, Haston was sentenced to 60 days in prison having run down and killed 18-year-old student James Orr whilst driving drunk.

Haston lived on to realize his early promise. In 1970, he and Don Whillans were the first to climb the south face of Annapurna on an expedition led by Chris Bonington, and in 1975 he and Doug Scott were the first pair to summit Mount Everest by the south-west face, also led by Bonington.
Haston&#x27;s memorial in Currie mistakenly claims he was the first British climber to ascend the north face of the Eiger. In fact, it was done by Bonington and Ian Clough in 1962, but he made the first ascent of the Nordwand by the &quot;direttissima&quot;, or most direct route, in 1966 with Jörg Lehne, Günther Strobel, Roland Votteler and Siegfried Hupfauer. American John Harlin was killed when a rope (chosen by him over Haston&#x27;s request they be thicker) broke; the route was subsequently named in Harlin&#x27;s memory.

Adding guiding and instruction to his quiver, Haston became director of the International School of Mountaineering at Leysin, Switzerland, in 1967. Taking over from the founder, John Harlin, it was a position he maintained until his death in a skiing accident in 1977.

In 1975, Haston was credited as an adviser on the movie &quot;The Eiger Sanction&quot;, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood.

Haston was killed in an avalanche in January 1977 while skiing alone above Leysin on the northeast face of La Riondaz to the Col Luisset. It appeared that he had been choked by his scarf. He is buried in Leysin.

<text>The fission sail is a type of spacecraft propulsion proposed by Robert Forward that uses fission fragments to propel a large solar sail-like craft. It is similar in concept to the fission-fragment rocket in that the fission by-products are directly harnessed as working mass, and differs primarily in the way that the fragments are used for thrust.

In the fission sail, the &quot;rocket&quot; is built in the form of a two-layer sheet, with some sort of absorber on one side, and nuclear fuel on the other. Atoms in the fuel that decay will release their fragments in random, but opposite, directions. In the simple case where the decay releases the fragments &quot;front&quot; and &quot;rear&quot;, the rearward moving fragment generates thrust directly, while the frontward moving one is absorbed in the front half of the sail with no net contribution to thrust. The sail is not a nuclear reactor, and relies on natural decay rates for energy release. The thrust from such a system will always be very low, albeit extremely efficient.

Forward proposed the system as an &quot;add on&quot; to existing solar sails. Close to stars where the light density is high the sails work fine, but as they move past about 2 AU their thrust is too low to be useful. Forward suggested that coating the sail with fissionable material would provide thrust in this region, where maneuvering is no longer as important. Such a system would accelerate and maneuver based on solar energy for the start of its flight, and then continue to accelerate at a lower rate for long periods of time.

<text>Look Around You is a comedic parody of British science television shows, devised and written by Robert Popper and Peter Serafinowicz, and narrated in the first series by Nigel Lambert. The first series of eight 10-minute shorts was shown in 2002, and the second series of six 30-minute episodes in 2005, both on BBC Two. The first series of &quot;Look Around You&quot; was nominated for a BAFTA award in 2003.

== Series 1 ==
In the first series, the episodes (&quot;modules&quot;) satirise and pay homage to early 1980s educational films and school programmes such as ITV&#x27;s &quot;Experiment&quot; series and BBC&#x27;s &quot;For Schools and Colleges&quot;. A different scientific subject is covered in each episode.

The modules were, in order of transmission:
# &quot;Calcium&quot; (pilot, double episode)
# &quot;Maths&quot;
# &quot;Water&quot;
# &quot;Germs&quot;
# &quot;Ghosts&quot;
# &quot;Sulphur&quot;
# &quot;Music&quot;
# &quot;Iron&quot;
# &quot;The Brain&quot;

The humour is derived from a combination of patent nonsense and faithful references and homages. For instance, fictional items that have a passing resemblance to everyday objects are shown and discussed. Such items include the &quot;boîte diabolique&quot;, a box at the top of a piano scale which housed the &quot;forbidden notes&quot;; and &quot;Garry gum&quot;, a performance-enhancing chewing gum which has the unfortunate side-effect of inducing diarrhoea, necessitating the consumption of &quot;anti-Garry gum&quot;. Each episode begins with a &quot;countdown clock&quot;, similar to the one used on ITV Schools programmes from 1979 to 1987. The music that accompanies the countdown is in the same spirit as the original, but is played on a solo guitar, and at the beginning of the &quot;Brain&quot; module, the guitarist can be heard tuning.

The module subjects are distorted beyond recognition; for instance, germs are described as coming from Germany, and whisky is said to be made by combining water with nitrogen. The maths module features a distorted and inaccurate version of the ancient &#x27;seven cats&#x27; puzzle by Ahmes. Additionally, subjects are mixed: for example, a chemistry experiment about eggs (in the episode &quot;Water&quot;) turns into a French language lesson. Each episode follows a general format, beginning with an introduction to the subject, followed by a series of silly experiments performed by the hapless (and normally mute) scientists, played by Popper, Serafinowicz and Edgar Wright, among others.

The colour and overall look of the film was purposely altered to replicate 1980s television for schools, and passably authentic incidental music written by Serafinowicz and Popper under the pseudonym &quot;Gelg&quot; was overdubbed to complete the parody of the original programmes.

A running gag throughout the series is the fastidious labelling of all items in Dymo tape, such as hairdryers, magnets, a bottle of maths, or a jar of nuts (which contained both types of nut: the foodstuff and fastener). Another recurring joke is the use of fictional apparatus and materials used in the experiments—items such as the &quot;Besselheim plate&quot; poke fun at real lab equipment, often named after their designers (e.g. Petri dish, Erlenmeyer flask). Pencils are always used to point at key elements of the experiments, as the &#x27;scientists&#x27; do not speak: this is sometimes taken to ridiculous levels—pointing out pencils using a pencil; pointing at chocolates and then at a person to show they are a gift. Also, the series repeatedly instructs viewers to keep a notebook, described as a &quot;copy book,&quot; and to inscribe random and essentially worthless details of the lessons taking place with the spoken instruction to &quot;note that down in your copy book.&quot;

The series was commissioned based on a 20-minute pilot episode (twice the length of an episode in the first series, but otherwise identical) in which calcium is described as an amorphous gel prepared by grinding discarded teeth in massive milling machines; this is included on the DVD release of Series 1 as an &quot;advanced double-length module&quot;.

The DVD extras also include a music video for the song &quot;Little Mouse&quot; (as featured in the module on music), a selection of mock-Ceefax pages, and a creator&#x27;s commentary. The joke is taken even further by presenting the DVD subtitles in exactly the same format as those broadcast via teletext.

At the end of each episode, reference is made to the &quot;next module&quot;—although these episodes were never actually made. The episodes that are promised, but never seen are:

* &quot;Champagne&quot;
* &quot;Cosmetics&quot;
* &quot;Dynamite&quot;
* &quot;Flowers&quot;
* &quot;Hitchhiking&quot;
* &quot;Italians&quot;
* &quot;Reggae&quot;
* &quot;Romance&quot;

On the DVD Ceefax pages there were also two unseen modules:

* &quot;Blood&quot;
* &quot;Further Maths&quot;

== Series 2 ==
The second series is composed of six 30-minute episodes and is presented in the pop-science vein of programmes such as &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;. The series was directed by Tim Kirkby, and Ash Atalla (producer of &quot;The Office&quot;) worked as executive producer. Running from 31 January to 7 March 2005 on BBC Two at 10 p.m., Series 2 comprised the following episodes:

# &quot;Music 2000&quot;
# &quot;Health&quot;
# &quot;Sport&quot;
# &quot;Food&quot;
# &quot;Computers&quot;
# &quot;Live &quot;Inventor of the Year&quot; Final&quot;

The DVD commentary confirms that this was not the intended order, explaining why some running gags appear to build inconsistently.

According to the audio commentary, the programme is set around 1980–1981. To reinforce the show&#x27;s retro look, each episode&#x27;s opening continuity announcement (typically narrated by Serafinowicz, who exaggerated the sound of his breathing and mouth movements to simulate the effect of the microphones used at that time) played over the three-dimensional BBC Two ident from 1979 to 1986. Unlike the first series, which is 16:9 widescreen, the second series is presented in 4:3 to emulate the television format used in the early &#x27;80s. Additionally, location footage was shot on 16mm film, of the type used for location filming at the time. Episode 1 features a &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; introduction complete with the real &quot;TOTP&quot; theme music from the early 1980s, Yellow Pearl by Phil Lynott.

Features such as the song contest in the &quot;Music 2000&quot; episode also ground the series in the 1980s. Contestants showcase the futuristic songs they believe we could expect to hear in the far-off year 2000. Runners-up &quot;Machadaynu&quot;, performed by Tony Rudd (played by Kevin Eldon) and Anthony Carmichael&#x27;s &quot;The Rapping Song&quot; are beaten in the contest by Toni Baxter&#x27;s track, &quot;Sexual Interface&quot;.

Unlike the first series, Series 2 contains dialogue between the four presenters and their guests, leaving behind both the narrated style of the first series and the anonymity given to the scientists. Serafinowicz plays Peter Packard, whilst Popper plays Jack Morgan, a character originally seen in series one as a musician performing the song &quot;Little Mouse&quot;. There are also two additional presenters, Pam Bachelor and Maghti, played by Olivia Colman and Josie D&#x27;Arby respectively.

Several running gags from the first series are reprised in Series 2, such as references to Imhotep (pictured, as in the 1st series, as a moai), bassoons, and the use of &quot;portmanteaux&quot;, in phrases such as &quot;Thanks, ants. Thants,&quot; or as in the Music episode, &quot;Thanks Tchaikovsky. Thaikovsky.&quot; In the final episode, this word-play culminates with Packard addressing two security guards, both named Hank, with the phrase &quot;Thanks, Hanks. Thanks.&quot; Another running joke centres on characters such as Synthesizer Patel in the &quot;Music&quot; episode and Computer Jones in the &quot;Computers&quot; episode, who like an item to such a degree that they&#x27;ve changed their names.

Whereas the modules in Series 1 were distinct, there is a measure of continuity throughout the episodes of Series 2. Each week, inventors (played by a number of British comic actors) showcase their new products, culminating in the live final programme where a winning invention is chosen, supposedly by &quot;HRH, Sir Prince Charles&quot;. To achieve this fake presentation, archive footage of Prince Charles was blended with &quot;Look Around You&quot; footage, whilst Serafinowicz dubs the Prince&#x27;s real voice with his own lip-synced impression of it.

=== DVD extras ===
DVD extras include a quiz, mock pages from Ceefax, an alternative &quot;Birds of Britain&quot; feature, the Scary Picture, which features a comically large succession of warning screens making sure the viewer actually wants to view it, before suddenly showing it at the same time as hearing a male scream, being shown without the scream in 2 episodes of Series 2, and the Test Card (a music video). Watching this to the end, including the credits, triggers an Easter egg featuring Jack Morgan&#x27;s more realistic reaction to his plastic surgery, in which the &quot;Look Around You&quot; team are shocked at the modifications to Jack&#x27;s face when Dr. Fu reveals him to them. When handed a mirror, Jack turns to Dr. Fu and starts shouting expletives at him (the sole reason for the 15 rating on the DVD), but then calms down after stating that it was the initial reaction to the surgery.

== Production ==

* A running joke in Series 2 is that all guests, when introduced, enter through a series of large blast doors (similar to those from &quot;Get Smart&quot;). However, these were filmed against a bluescreen which gave an inferior effect, and the creators stated, on the DVD commentary, that they did not like the joke but felt they were &quot;stuck with it&quot;.
* Leonard Hatred&#x27;s funny walk was not scripted—it was improvised by Heap. His encounter with Championess in the finale of the second series was also improvised.
* The &quot;Computers&quot; episode featured clips of fake 1980s computer games created by members of b3ta. Games included &quot;Diarrhea Dan&quot;.

== Broadcast ==

When aired on BBC America from 2003 to 2008, episodes were edited to fit within a 30-minute time slot with adverts. This triggered a continuity error with the series: Leonard Hatred&#x27;s initial segment was cut from the first episode, causing him to appear without explanation in the series finale.

The series ran on Adult Swim from 2009 to 2011.

Robert Popper reprised the role of his &quot;Look Around You&quot; character, Jack Morgan, for an appearance in the music video of the Frankie &amp; The Heartstrings song &quot;Hunger&quot; (2011). Jack is seen hosting a &quot;Blue Peter&quot;-type programme, and introduces the song.

In 2023, both series were made permanently available on BBC iPlayer.

== Reception ==
The series was praised for its attention to detail. 
&quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ creator Matt Groening called it &quot;one of the funniest shows I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;.

On 13 January 2012 &quot;Look Around You&quot; had its 10th anniversary celebrated by a showing of all episodes of the first series at the BFI Southbank in London. Peter Serafinowicz also released a new short clip entitled &quot;Intermission&quot;.

<text>ABC Local Radio is a network of publicly owned radio stations in Australia, operated by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

ABC Local Radio stations broadcast across the continent using terrestrial transmitters and satellites. Its programming consists of news, current affairs, talkback, entertainment, sport, music and local affairs. They are usually reckoned as the flagship ABC radio stations in their areas.

Depending on the time of day and the day of the week, programming can either be purely local (typically on weekday mornings), broadcast from the state or territory capital city ABC station, or simulcast across all ABC Local Radio services across the country (typically overnight, public holidays, in the summer months and on weekends).

==History==
Originally, Local Radio was known internally as ABC Radio 1 in metropolitan regions and ABC Radio 3 in regional areas. Radio 1 was a largely local format while Radio 3 was more networked and included content from the national programme, Radio 2.

In the 1980s, Radio National emerged from Radio 2, and Radio 3 dropped its Radio 2 content, with Radio 1 becoming ABC Metropolitan Radio and Radio 3 becoming ABC Regional Radio. The Regional Radio stations provided local programming in &quot;Breakfast&quot; and &quot;Drive&quot;, but networked common content for most of their broadcasting hours. Some different, local market formats emerged, including the Darwin Metro 8DDD on FM105.7 and Gold Coast Regional, ABC Coast FM (4SCR), 91.7. Up until the mid-1990s, the majority of the local radio stations identified on-air by frequency and callsign. In the 1990s, a different convention was used, generally as &quot;ABC Radio (region)&quot; or &quot;(region) FM&quot;.

In 2000, these two almost identical networks merged as ABC Local Radio. From this point all ABC Local Radio stations ceased to identify themselves according to their callsigns or other existing names, and instead use the format &quot;(frequency) ABC (region)&quot;, or &quot;ABC (region)&quot; where there are multiple frequencies broadcasting the same service. However, as the callsigns were used continuously for up to seventy years and are much shorter than the new names, many long-term listeners still use these callsigns to refer to ABC Local Radio stations.

In January 2017, ABC Local Radio rebranded with a new logo, dropping the frequency number of each local radio station as part of the network&#x27;s multiplatform philosophy. 

In April 2019, ABC Local Radio began a rollout of branding updates for its 44 regional bureaux, ten regional stations dropping call signs from their names and two undergoing a significant name change to better identify their local region.

==Programming==
The metropolitan and regional stations originate most of their own programming.

Until 2015, the regional stations usually simulcast one of the metropolitan stations when they were not airing local programming. Usually, they simulcast their state&#x27;s capital city station; an exception was 999 ABC Broken Hill, which simulcasts 891 ABC Adelaide because Broken Hill is on Central Time. In 2015, the ABC formed a Regional Division to again split its regional stations from the metropolitan counterparts. 1233 ABC Newcastle (2NC) was transferred from the metropolitan network to the new regional division and 14 of the regional network&#x27;s member stations began streaming.

In October 2015 a slight restructure of programs was announced. From 2016, &quot;Morning&quot; programs will be folded into longer &quot;Breakfast&quot; programs, followed by a new one-hour program, &quot;Local Life&quot;. There would be a loss of four local radio news bulletins; instead, headlines would replace two afternoon full news bulletins.

There are local news websites for each station.

Some programmes are aired first on ABC Radio National, then on the Local Radio network. For example,
&quot;Speaking Out&quot;, hosted by Larissa Behrendt, broadcasts () on Radio National on Fridays at 8pm and on Local Radio on Sundays at 9pm.

<text>The Needham Research Institute (NRI; ), located on the grounds of Robinson College, in Cambridge, England, is a centre for research into the history of science, technology and medicine in East Asia. The institute is named after the biochemist and historian Joseph Needham, who initiated the &quot;Science and Civilisation in China&quot; series. The current director is Mei Jianjun, a noted archaeo-metallurgist.

The organization was founded as the East Asian History of Science Trust in August 1968. In June 1983 the trustees conferred the title Needham Research Institute. The Trustees of the NRI is a registered charity.

The institute grew out of Needham&#x27;s research collection, which was originally housed in Gonville and Caius College, where he was Master until his retirement in 1976. After several moves, it moved into its current purpose-built structure in Robinson College in 1991. The building was designed in the Chinese style, and has been described by its architect as &quot;East Anglian Asian&quot;.

<doc id="752782" wikidata="Q1508334" url="?curid=752782" title="New Adventures in Hi-Fi">
<text>New Adventures in Hi-Fi is the tenth studio album by the American alternative rock band R.E.M. It was their fifth major-label release for Warner Bros. Records, released on September 9, 1996, in Europe and Australia, and the following day in the United States. &quot;New Adventures in Hi-Fi&quot; was the band&#x27;s final album recorded with founding drummer Bill Berry (who left the band amicably the following year), original manager Jefferson Holt, and long-time producer Scott Litt. The members of R.E.M. consider the recorded album representative of the band at their peak, and fans generally regard it as the band&#x27;s last great record before a perceived artistic decline during the late 1990s and early 2000s. It has sold around seven million units, growing in cult status years after its release, with several retrospectives ranking it among the best of the band&#x27;s recorded catalogue.

==Composition and recording==
The album was recorded during and after the 1995 tour in support of &quot;Monster&quot;. The material on the album mixed the acoustic, country rock feel of much of &quot;Out of Time&quot; and &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; with the rock sound of &quot;Monster&quot; and &quot;Lifes Rich Pageant&quot;. The band has cited Neil Young&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Time Fades Away&quot; as a source of inspiration. The album has been labeled as &quot;folk rock-jangle&quot; by critic Robert Christgau.

In an interview with &quot;Mojo&quot;, bassist Mike Mills said:



The band noted that they borrowed the recording process for the album from Radiohead, who had recorded some of the basic tracks for &quot;The Bends&quot; while on tour and who supported the band in 1994 and 1995. R.E.M. took eight-track recorders to capture their live performances, and used the recordings as the base elements for the album. As such, the band&#x27;s touring musicians Nathan December and Scott McCaughey are featured throughout, with Andy Carlson contributing violin to &quot;Electrolite&quot;.

After the tour was over, the band went into Seattle&#x27;s Bad Animals Studio and recorded four additional tracks: &quot;How the West Was Won and Where It Got Us&quot;, &quot;E-Bow the Letter&quot;, &quot;Be Mine&quot; and &quot;New Test Leper&quot;. Patti Smith came to the sessions and contributed vocals on &quot;E-Bow the Letter&quot;. Audio mixing was finished at John Keane Studio in Athens and Louie&#x27;s Clubhouse in Los Angeles with mastering by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering in Portland, Maine.

In part due to the nature of the recording process, several of the songs are about travel and motion—including &quot;Departure&quot;, &quot;Leave&quot; and &quot;Low Desert&quot;. The album&#x27;s liner notes contain pictures from the road and the deluxe edition of the album is a hardcover book in a slipcase featuring more photographs of R.E.M.&#x27;s tour.

== Artwork ==

The photograph used in the album cover was shot by Stipe in Nevada during a road trip to Georgia from Los Angeles. Other parts of the packaging were done by Chris Bilheimer.

==Critical reception==
Critical reaction to the album was mostly extremely positive. Several publications lauded the album for its rich diversity, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which said &quot;The sequence of songs and the range of emotions on &quot;New Adventures&quot; convey a narrative that has all the dynamics and contradictions of life itself.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;Mojo&quot; also gave positive reviews. At the same time, however, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; criticized the album&#x27;s empty and flat sound caused by recording in arenas and soundchecks.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said, &quot;&quot;New Adventures in Hi-Fi&quot; feels like it was recorded on the road. Not only are all of Michael Stipe&#x27;s lyrics on the album about moving or travel, the sound is ragged and varied, pieced together from tapes recorded at shows, soundtracks, and studios, giving it a loose, careening charm.&quot; and concluded &quot;In its multifaceted sprawl, [R.E.M.] wound up with one of their best records of the &#x27;90s.&quot; In a 2017 retrospective on the band, &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; ranked it third out of R.E.M.&#x27;s 15 full-length studio albums.

&quot;New Adventures in Hi-Fi&quot; is frontman Michael Stipe&#x27;s favorite R.E.M. album, and he considers it the band at their peak. Radiohead singer Thom Yorke, who has cited R.E.M. as a major influence, called it his favorite R.E.M. album and &quot;Electrolite&quot; the band&#x27;s greatest song. Jeremy Bifras of BrooklynVegan called the album &quot;an experimental masterpiece.&quot;

===Awards===
&quot;New Adventures in Hi-Fi&quot; has since appeared on several lists compiling the best albums of the 1990s or all time: &quot;Magnet&quot; listed the album at #20 on its list of the &quot;Top 60 Albums 1993–2003&quot;, and &quot;Mojo&quot; also listed the album at #20 on a list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Albums of Our Lifetime 1993–2006&quot;.

It was voted #186 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (3rd Edition, 2000). It was also featured on several year-end best-of lists for 1996:
*&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; (#2)
*&quot;Eye Weekly&quot; (#11)
*&quot;The Face&quot; (#28)
*&quot;Magnet&quot; (#26)
*&quot;Mojo&quot; (#4)

Unlike most R.E.M. albums, this vinyl release did not have custom side names; instead, it was released as a double album. Record one has tracks 1–6 (three songs per side) and record two has tracks 7–14 (four songs per side). The tape release maintained the custom side names: the first side was called the &quot;Hi-side&quot; and the second side was called the &quot;Fi-side.&quot;

==Chart performance==
While &quot;New Adventures in Hi-Fi&quot; began the band&#x27;s sales decline in the United States, it topped the charts in over a dozen countries and reached #1 on the Top European Albums for five consecutive weeks. The album peaked at #2 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spent 22 weeks on chart. According to Nielsen SoundScan, it has sold 994,000 units in the U.S. as of March 2007. The first single, &quot;E-Bow the Letter&quot;, received only modest radio airplay in the U.S. and peaked at #49 on its charts. In the UK, however, the single became the band&#x27;s biggest hit at that point, reaching #4.

==Release history==
Like all R.E.M. albums since 1988&#x27;s &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;New Adventures in Hi-Fi&quot; was released in a limited-edition packaging. This one contained a 64-page hardcover book designed by Chris Bilheimer and featuring photos from the &quot;Monster&quot; tour. In 2005, Warner Brothers Records issued an expanded two-disc edition of the album which included a CD, a DVD-Audio disc containing a new audio mix of the album (in 5.1-channel surround sound, high resolution, AC3, Dolby Stereo, and DTS 5.1) done by Elliot Scheiner and the original CD booklet with expanded liner notes. In addition, the DVD includes a video documentary, lyrics, and a photo gallery.

As with the prior albums, a 25th-anniversary edition was announced in August 2021 for an October release date. The edition includes a remastered album, B-sides from the album and a Blu-ray with previously unreleased promotional materials. Due to issues related to the 2021 global supply chain crisis, all CD variations of the remastered reissue were delayed to mid-November 2021.

<doc id="752805" wikidata="Q7564712" url="?curid=752805" title="Sound Shattering Sound">
<text>Sound Shattering Sound is the major label debut by Perth alternative rock band Gyroscope released on 14 June 2004 in Australia and debuted a week later on the Australian album charts in the top 40 at No 37.

== History ==

The album was produced by Shaun O&#x27;Callaghan (John Butler Trio, Eskimo Joe) who had produced the band&#x27;s previous two EPs. Gyroscope vocalist and guitarist Daniel Sanders says on the Festival Mushroom Records website. &quot;The music that drove us the most were albums like Weezer&#x27;s debut, or Foo Fighters &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot;. They were more of an adventure rather than just being a 40-minute album. I think we got there in the end.&quot;

Five out of the album&#x27;s twelve tracks were previously available either on the band&#x27;s earlier EPs or singles.

== Singles ==

The first single from the album, &quot;Safe Forever&quot;, was released on 15 March 2004, peaking in the top 100 of the ARIA Singles Chart. The song also polled at No. 97 on Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100 for 2004.

The second and third singles, &quot;Take This for Granted&quot; and &quot;Get Down&quot; both failed to chart. The music videos for both &quot;Safe Forever&quot; and &quot;Take This for Granted&quot; were directed by Matt Weston. The video for &quot;Take This For Granted&quot; was shot in Sydney at the now closed White Bay Power Station (the same location used in &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Red Planet&quot; films).

In 2003, Draco prepared for the release of his most ambitious project titled &quot;Mad Love&quot; consisting of lugubrious gothic ballads and esoteric windblown burdens. The album was the first to earn Draco international recognition beyond Latin America, becoming widely popular in Europe. With most songs in English and collaborations with musicians from all around the world, &quot;Mad Love&quot; included two videos directed by his wife, Angela Alvarado, &quot;Dancing in the Rain&quot; and &quot;Lie Without a Lover&quot;. It also debuted at #2 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Heatseeker charts and was considered the #1 Latin album of 2004 by New York’s Newsday. The video for &quot;Más y Más&quot; won the 2004 Latin Grammy Award for Best Video. In September 2004, Draco took his show to Puerto Rico&#x27;s new 18,000-capacity stadium, selling out the venue. A CD/DVD of the event was released on December 6, 2005, titled &quot;Draco al Natural&quot;.

<text>Songkhla (, ), also known as Singgora or Singora (Pattani Malay: ซิงกอรอ, Singoro), is a city (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) in Songkhla Province of southern Thailand, near the border with Malaysia. Songkhla lies south of Bangkok and as of 2020 had a population of 61,758. 

Despite being smaller than the neighboring city Hat Yai, Songkhla is the capital of Songkhla Province as well as the Mueang Songkhla District (Songkhla town district). Together with Hat Yai, Songkhla is part of the Greater Hat Yai-Songkhla Metropolitan Area (a conurbation with a population of around 800,000), the third largest metropolitan area in Thailand.

At the opening of Songkhla Lake to the Gulf of Thailand, Songkhla is a fishing town and also an important harbour. It is the major seaport on the east side of the Isthmus of Kra.

==History==


The name &quot;Songkhla&quot; means &#x27;the city of lions&#x27; (not to be confused with Singapura) and is the Thai variant of &quot;Singgora&quot; (Malay and Jawi: سيڠڬورا). This refers to a lion-shaped mountain near the city of Songkhla. Archaeological excavations on the isthmus between Lake Songkhla and the sea reveal that in the 10th through the 14th century, this was a major urbanized area, and a center of international maritime trade, in particular with Quanzhou in China. The long Sanskrit name of the state that existed there has been lost; its short Sanskrit name was &quot;Singhapura&quot; (&#x27;Lion City&#x27;) (not to be confused with Singapura), a city state. The short vernacular name was &quot;Satingpra&quot;, coming from the Mon-Khmer &quot;sting&quot;/&quot;steng&quot;/&quot;stang&quot; (meaning &#x27;river&#x27;) and the Sanskrit &quot;pura&quot; (&#x27;city&#x27;).

The ruins of the ancient port city of Satingpra are just few kilometers north of Songkhla. It was one of the most important trading centers of the Tambralinga Kingdom. Archaeological digs and investigations conducted toward the end of the 20th century testify the existence of a fortified citadel protected by a moat and a quadrangular surrounding wall made of brick. A sophisticated system of canals connected the sea to the Songkhla Lake permitting the circulations of ships. The excavations brought to light artifacts of great historical and artistic value.

The precursor of the present-day town of Songkhla was The Sultanate of Singora, a heavily fortified port city. It was founded in the early 17th century by a Persian, Dato Mogol, and flourished during the reign of his son, Sultan Sulaiman Shah. In 1680, after decades of conflict, the city was destroyed and abandoned; remains include forts, city walls, a Dutch cemetery and the tomb of Sultan Sulaiman Shah.

On 8 December 1941 local time, the Imperial Japanese army landed in Songkhla, invading Thailand. Because of the International Date Line, this actually occurred hours before the 7 December (Hawaii time) attack on Pearl Harbor, making it the first major action of the Pacific War. The Japanese forces then moved south towards Perlis and Penang as part of the Malayan campaign which culminated in the capture of Singapore.

Since 2003, Songhkla has been affected by separatist insurgencies in neighboring Narathiwat, Pattani, and Yala.

The municipality&#x27;s mayor, Peera Tantiserane, was murdered in Songkhla in 2014.

==Climate==
Songkhla has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Am&quot;). Temperatures are very warm to hot throughout the year with only minor variation. There is a short dry season in February and March; the rest of the year is wet, with especially heavy rainfall from October to December.

==Population==
The majority of the population is Buddhist with a large proportion of Muslims, especially in the rural areas near the Malaysian border. These Muslims speak the Yawi language, a language closely related to Malay, which has some Thai influence, especially in loan words borrowed from the Thai language.

Songkhla city takes up the entire Bo Yang sub-district. As of 2020 Songkhla city had a population of 61,758.

<doc id="752814" wikidata="Q1459277" url="?curid=752814" title="Up (R.E.M. album)">
<text>Up is the eleventh studio album by American rock band R.E.M. It was released on October 26, 1998, through Warner Bros. Records. The album was the band&#x27;s first without drummer and founding member Bill Berry, who retired from the band in October 1997. In his place, R.E.M. used session drummers such as Joey Waronker and Barrett Martin while also utilizing drum machines. The album was produced by Pat McCarthy, making it R.E.M.&#x27;s first album since &quot;Lifes Rich Pageant&quot; (1986) not to be produced by Scott Litt.

The songs on &quot;Up&quot; display a much larger electronic music influence than previous R.E.M. material, with extensive use of keyboards and drum programming. Among the ideas Stipe set out to explore lyrically were what he described as the &quot;religious-spiritual versus science-technology-modern-age&quot;, in addition to an &quot;automatic, unconscious&quot; style. The making of the album was tumultuous, with the band later admitting to coming close to breaking up during the process.

While &quot;Up&quot; was commercially successful, reaching the top 3 in both the US and UK, its sales fell short of R.E.M.&#x27;s previous albums. Four singles were released from the album: &quot;Daysleeper&quot;, &quot;Lotus&quot;, &quot;At My Most Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Suspicion&quot;. Both &quot;Daysleeper&quot; and &quot;At My Most Beautiful&quot; were top 10 hits in the UK, while the former reached the top of the US Adult Alternative Songs chart. Critical reception has been positive, with many considering it to be a transitional record for the band and praising its integration of electronic elements. The band toured throughout 1999 in Europe and the US in promotion of the album. In 2023, &quot;Up&quot; was reissued with bonus material for the 25th anniversary of its release.

==Background==

In 1995, R.E.M. embarked on a tour for their ninth studio album &quot;Monster&quot; (1994), their first since the &quot;Green&quot; (1988) tour. While the tour was critically and commercially successful, the band was marred by health problems, including an aneurysm suffered by Berry at a show in Lausanne, Switzerland. After receiving emergency surgery, Berry made a full recovery, although the band had to cancel the rest of their spring tour. Bassist Mike Mills additionally had to have an intestinal tumor removed in July of that year, whilst in August lead vocalist Michael Stipe suffered a hernia. The next year, the band signed a deal with Warner Bros. Records worth an estimated $80 million, which had been regarded as the largest recording contract awarded up to that point. In the spring, the band parted ways with longtime manager Jefferson Holt due to allegations of sexual harassment. In September 1996, the band released &quot;New Adventures in Hi-Fi&quot;, which had been partially recorded live and during soundchecks from the &quot;Monster&quot; tour. The album was a critical and commercial success, reaching number two in the US and number one in the UK. However, none of its singles managed to reach the top 40 in the US and sales were lower than the band&#x27;s previous few releases.

==Recording==

R.E.M. began rehearsals for their next album in February 1997 at West Clayton Street in Athens. The band produced around 20 backing tracks at this time, and after these sessions they considered working with Litt once again. However, Litt was in the process of founding a record label at the time and was not as interested in producing records as before. Later in March, the band continued work in Buck&#x27;s home studio in Hawaii, intending to build songs around the backing tracks created in February. While these sessions preceded Berry&#x27;s departure, the band had already moved in a more electronic direction, with the tracks utilizing drum machines and being written with very little guitar; at this point the band had put &quot;about 40 songs on tape.&quot; However, due to various personal factors, Berry struggled to remain interested in working with the band, and when they reconvened to continue work on &quot;Up&quot; in October 1997, he announced his departure. While the band had, in the past, declared they would disband following the departure of any members, Berry made it clear to the rest of R.E.M. that he would not leave if it would result in the dissolution of the band. The band continued and decided against replacing Berry, instead utilizing session drummers and drum machines. However, sessions booked at John Keane&#x27;s studio in October and November were cancelled, as the band were unsure of their direction and &quot;couldn&#x27;t rehearse without a drummer.&quot;

The band&#x27;s first sessions without Berry began on February 2, 1998 at Toast Studios in San Francisco. In Litt&#x27;s place was producer Pat McCarthy, who had previously worked with R.E.M. as an engineer and had also worked with acts including U2 and Counting Crows. &quot;Airportman&quot; was one of the first songs to be finished, being &quot;written, recorded, sung, and mixed by us all in one day&quot;, according to Stipe. Despite a fast start, progress was quickly halted by Stipe&#x27;s writer&#x27;s block.

==Music and lyrics==

Considered both an alternative rock and electronic record, &quot;Up&quot; is largely defined by the use of drum machines and keyboards, to a greater extent than on any previous R.E.M. album. Stipe cited &quot;the religious-spiritual versus science-technology-modern-age&quot; as a theme he intended to explore with his lyrics. He also sought an &quot;automatic, unconscious&quot; style inspired by Patti Smith. According to Stipe, Bertis Downs, the band&#x27;s lawyer, noted a theme of &quot;people falling down and getting back up again&quot;.
The album opens with &quot;Airportman&quot;, which Mills states was specifically chosen as the first track as &quot;a challenge to the audience&quot;. He felt the song would effectively introduce &quot;the new R.E.M.&quot;, while also stating that &quot;if [the listener] can get on board with this song starting the record, then you can get on board with everything else.&quot; Lyrically, the song takes the perspective of a travelling businessman. Its music has been compared to the work of Brian Eno, while Stipe&#x27;s vocals have been likened to Thom Yorke. &quot;Lotus&quot; was written by Buck on keyboards, and is one of the few on the album to feature live drumming. In reviewing the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary reissue for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Stephen Thomas Erlewine declared it to be &quot;Up&quot;s &quot;hardest rocking cut&quot;. &quot;Suspicion&quot; has been described by Ryan Leas of &quot;Stereogum&quot; as a &quot;strange electronic meditation&quot; and &quot;a whisper of a Bond theme in some kind of space lounge&quot;. Despite not participating in the writing of the song, singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen was given a writing credit for &quot;Hope&quot; due to its perceived similarities to Cohen&#x27;s song &quot;Suzanne&quot;. Erlewine states the song &quot;hums along to an understatedly urgent pulse&quot;, while Leas interprets its lyrics as &quot;grappling with technology and faith&quot;.

The baroque-esque &quot;At My Most Beautiful&quot; has received many comparisons to the Beach Boys, particularly the band&#x27;s 1966 album &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. Often considered the band&#x27;s first true love song, it was deliberately arranged by Mills to be a tribute to the Beach Boys. The writing of the song was spurred by Stipe coming up with the lyric &quot;I found a way to make you smile&quot; while sitting in traffic. The song&#x27;s drums are performed by Buck, who has also cited the song as having his favorite of Mills&#x27; basslines. Seth Troyer of &quot;PopMatters&quot; compares the guitar work on &quot;The Apologist&quot; to that of the band&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Monster&quot;, while referring to its lyrics as a &quot;character study&quot; echoing the chorus of an earlier R.E.M. song, &quot;So. Central Rain (I&#x27;m Sorry)&quot; (1984). Sal Cineuqmani of &quot;Slant&quot; describes &quot;Sad Professor&quot; as a &quot;character study of an aging, self-loathing alcoholic.&quot; &quot;Walk Unafraid&quot; has been called a &quot;deconstructed rocker&quot;, with the verses &quot;suspended in midair&quot; while also having &quot;one of the only affirming choruses&quot; on the album. The song&#x27;s lyrics were inspired by a conversation Stipe had with Patti Smith in which she encouraged him to be &quot;fearless&quot; in working on the album; Stipe made a point of making the lyrical themes broader, stating that &quot;I wanted [&quot;Walk Unafraid&quot;] to be more universal than just me having to embark on the writing of an album. That&#x27;s a little too specific and not that interesting, so I wrote this song.&quot; Much like &quot;At My Most Beautiful&quot;, Leas compares &quot;Why Not Smile&quot; to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;–era Beach Boys, while Troyer states the track &quot;begins as a simple acoustic song and explodes into a borderline shoegaze, noise guitar jam.&quot;

The lyrics of &quot;Daysleeper&quot; are generally more direct in comparison to other tracks on the album, sung from the perspective of a nightshift worker whose lifestyle causes them to feel isolated and depressed. Stipe was inspired to write the song after seeing a &quot;daysleeper&quot; sign in a New York apartment building. Troyer considers &quot;Daysleeper&quot; to be one of the most conventional songs on the album, saying it &quot;chime[s] forth with a catchy pop-rock style that [feels] more like classic R.E.M.&quot; Tim Peacock of uDiscover Music cites &quot;Diminished&quot; and &quot;Parakeet&quot; as examples of the album&#x27;s use of experimental instrumentation, with the former including &quot;embellishments of vibes and tabla&quot; and the latter utilizing &quot;&quot;Pet Sounds&quot;-era organs.&quot; Additionally, &quot;Diminished&quot; includes a short hidden track entitled &quot;I&#x27;m Not Over You&quot;. &quot;Falls to Climb&quot;, the album&#x27;s closing track, features a vocal performance by Stipe which has earned comparisons to Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot;, released on their album &quot;Kid A&quot; two years after the release of &quot;Up&quot;. Troyer describes the song as &quot;a beautiful epilogue&quot; which is &quot;full of tragic acceptance&quot;.

==Release and commercial performance==

Breaking with a tradition that stretched back to the band&#x27;s 1983 debut, &quot;Murmur&quot;, Stipe elected to have his complete lyrics included in &quot;Up&quot;&#x27;s CD booklet, a practice he would maintain on all subsequent R.E.M. studio albums. &quot;[Mike Mills] was reading the lyrics,&quot; he explained, &quot;and he said, &#x27;These are really great – we should print them on the record sleeve.&#x27; It was a really good night and there were eight or nine songs on the wall. I said, &#x27;Yeah, we will&#x27;… I thought it was a nice way of saying that we are a different band now.&quot;

Warner Bros. chose &quot;Daysleeper&quot; as the album&#x27;s first single, which was released on October 12, 1998. The band was unhappy with the decision to release the song as the album&#x27;s lead single, as they felt it was not necessarily indicative of the rest of the album. It peaked at number 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making it their lowest-charting lead single since &quot;Fall on Me&quot; in 1986. However, it was more successful on the Adult Alternative Songs chart, where it stayed at the top for two weeks. The song was more successful in the UK, where it reached number six. &quot;Lotus&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single, was less successful, peaking at number 4 on the US Adult Alternative Songs chart and number 26 on the UK Singles Chart. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;At My Most Beautiful&quot; was more successful, becoming its second top 10 hit in the UK, where it peaked at number ten. &quot;Suspicion&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fourth and final single and failed to chart in either territory.

The album itself was released on October 26, 1998. Despite debuting at number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and selling 117,000 copies in its first week of release, its sales dropped in the following weeks. The album would be certified Gold by the RIAA on January 22, 1999, becoming their first studio album since &quot;Lifes Rich Pageant&quot; to not receive a Platinum certification. However, &quot;Up&quot; saw more success in Europe, with it topping the charts in Italy, Germany, Austria, and Norway and placing at number two in the UK, Ireland, and Sweden. Sales were high in Italy in particular, exceeding 90,000 copies in its first week of release. The band members were not disappointed in the album&#x27;s sales in the US; as Buck stated: &quot;I&#x27;m not unsatisfied [about the American sales figures]... I&#x27;d like to sell more. But there&#x27;s not much I can really do about it. I think we made a great record. We&#x27;re doing television and press [to promote it].&quot;

A 25th-anniversary edition was released on November 10, 2023. This reissue included a second disc with the band&#x27;s February 1999 live performance for the sitcom &quot;Party of Five&quot; alongside a DVD with music videos and other material.

==Critical reception==
Upon release, &quot;Up&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Mike Boehm found the album to be an improvement from &quot;New Adventures in Hi-Fi&quot;, praising its &quot;resourceful and cohesive soundscape&quot; and its &quot;passionate take on end-of-the-century malaise&quot;. Boehm noted a lyrical theme of &quot;sort[ing] through confusion and reach[ing] uncertainly for clarity&quot;, while he described its music as &quot;muted pop-baroque.&quot; Boehm highlighted Stipe&#x27;s vocals on &quot;At My Most Beautiful&quot; and the album&#x27;s &quot;two rockers&quot; (&quot;Lotus&quot; and &quot;Walk Unafraid&quot;), while likening &quot;Hope&quot; to &quot;Kraftwerk covering Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &#x27;Suzanne&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s David Browne deemed &quot;Up&quot; R.E.M.&#x27;s most cohesive album since &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; (1992) and said that their shift toward &quot;mid-tempo, or often no-tempo, hymns and ballads&quot; suited them, accentuating the vulnerability &quot;at the heart&quot; of the band&#x27;s work. In a four-star review for &quot;Q&quot;, Danny Eccleston felt the album would be challenging for casual listeners, but more accessible for fans of the band: &quot;It will certainly sound strange to those who only own &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; and repeat-play the hits. Conversely, anyone who has a healthy number of R.E.M. records – let&#x27;s say four – and plays them regularly, should manage to listen to &quot;Up&quot; without his head exploding or tossing herself off a tall building or any of the weird things people are meant to do when faced with music they don&#x27;t quite understand.&quot; He went on to state that while there was a &quot;fear that R.E.M. playing keyboards would sound like old dogs trying embarrassing new tricks&quot;, they instead &quot;sound comfortable with the instrumentation and are pushing the capabilities of it from the off.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Ann Powers compared the album to Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997), highlighting a shared theme of &quot;alienation&quot; and stating that &quot;Buck and Mills cultivate the same multitiered spaciousness [on &quot;Up&quot;] that makes &quot;OK Computer&quot; so rich.&quot; Powers went on to describe &quot;Up&quot; as &quot;a look back and a dream forward from the greatest rock-ballad band that ever existed, a group whose fast songs even made you think slow, the one that made introspection not just a sideline but the whole game.&quot; Sally Jacob of &quot;Spin&quot; felt that the album&#x27;s electronic style helped keep R.E.M.&#x27;s sound fresh and compared it to the band&#x27;s debut &quot;Murmur&quot; (1983). Jacob went on to praise &quot;Up&quot; as &quot;lushly arranged&quot; and &quot;float[ing] away from R.E.M.&#x27;s past moorings in weighty, enigmatic symbolism.&quot; Conversely, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;s original review of the album was more mixed, feeling that the band&#x27;s change in sound was &quot;contrived and forced.&quot; While reviewer Duane Ambroz highlighted &quot;Airportman&quot;, &quot;Why Not Smile&quot;, and &quot;Daysleeper&quot; as instances where the album was successful, he considered &quot;At My Most Beautiful&quot; to be &quot;laughable&quot; and found the album as a whole to be &quot;dull and tired&quot;. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Adam Sweeting credited R.E.M. for diversifying their sound on &quot;Up&quot; but found their musical experimentation only intermittently successful, summarizing the album as sounding like &quot;it&#x27;s suffering an identity crisis.&quot;

Retrospective reviews of the album have also been positive, with many considering it to be underrated. Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the album &quot;accomplished and varied&quot;, while also noting that the record proved how R.E.M. could integrate a wide array of genres into their sound while maintaining their identity. However, he also felt that &quot;for the first time, R.E.M. sound like they&#x27;re playing catch-up, trying to keep their hip status intact.&quot; Rating the album as part of a 2005 group of reissues, Karen Schoemer of &quot;Blender&quot; awarded &quot;Up&quot; four stars out of five, calling it the band&#x27;s &quot;most intimate [album] in years.&quot; Louis Pattison of &quot;Uncut&quot; noted the group&#x27;s embracement of electronica and the aesthetics of hypermodernity, with a dislocated, &#x27;fin de siècle&#x27; feel comparable to Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;OK Computer&quot; and &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000), with Thom Yorke of that band citing &quot;Up&quot; as a touchstone for the latter album. Pattison added that &quot;Up&quot;″s use of electronics was prescient, as &quot;post-&quot;Kid A&quot;, groups like The Postal Service and Owl City would work so-called &#x27;emotronica&#x27; into a commercial force. But in 1998, the audience were not ready, and R.E.M. themselves proved either unwilling or unable.&quot;

The album&#x27;s 25th anniversary reissue sparked renewed attention in the album and further positive reviews.

Although R.E.M. initially intended not to tour for the album, after many successful promotional concerts upon the album&#x27;s release, the band quickly arranged a four-month arena tour of Europe and America during the summer of 1999. As of March 2007, &quot;Up&quot; has sold 664,000 units in the U.S.

===Accolades===
In 1999, &quot;Nude as the News&quot; ranked the album at number 74 in its list of &quot;The 100 Most Compelling Albums of the Decade&quot;. That same year, Australian magazine &quot;Juice&quot; ranked it at number 38 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot;. In 2005, journalist Jude Rogers included the album in &quot;The Word&quot;&#x27;s list &quot;Hidden Treasure: Great Underrated Albums of Our Time&quot;, whose inductions were chosen by celebrities. It also appeared in at least 22 magazine lists of the greatest albums of 1998.

<doc id="752815" wikidata="Q1975054" url="?curid=752815" title="Virchow's triad">
<text>Virchow&#x27;s triad or the triad of Virchow () describes the three broad categories of factors that are thought to contribute to thrombosis.
* Hypercoagulability
* Hemodynamic changes (stasis, turbulence)
* Endothelial injury/dysfunction

It is named after the renowned German physician Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902). However, the elements comprising Virchow&#x27;s triad were not proposed by Virchow. Neither did he ever suggest a triad to describe the pathogenesis of venous thrombosis. In fact, it was not until decades after Virchow&#x27;s death that a consensus was reached proposing that thrombosis is the result of alterations in blood flow, vascular endothelial injury, or alterations in the constitution of the blood. Still, the modern understanding of the factors leading to embolism is similar to the description provided by Virchow. Virchow&#x27;s triad remains a useful concept for clinicians and pathologists alike in understanding the contributors to thrombosis.
==The triad==
The triad consists of three components:

==History==
The origin of the term &quot;Virchow&#x27;s Triad&quot; is of historical interest, and has been subject to reinterpretation in recent years. While both Virchow&#x27;s and the modern triads describe thrombosis, the previous triad has been characterized as &quot;the consequences of thrombosis&quot;, and the modern triad as &quot;the causes of thrombosis&quot;.

Rudolf Virchow elucidated the etiology of pulmonary embolism, whereby thrombi occurring within the veins, particularly those of the extremities, become dislodged and migrate to the pulmonary vasculature. He published his description in 1856. In detailing the pathophysiology surrounding pulmonary embolism, he alluded to many of the factors known to contribute to venous thrombosis. While these factors had already been previously established in the medical literature by others, for unclear reasons they ultimately became known as Virchow&#x27;s triad. This eponym did not emerge in the literature until long after Virchow&#x27;s death. One estimate of the first use of the phrase dates it to the early 1950s.

Although the concept of the triad is usually attributed to Virchow, he did not include endothelial injury in his description. This has been attributed to a dispute Virchow had with Jean Cruveilhier, who considered local trauma of primary importance in the development of pulmonary artery thrombosis.

<text>Laetoli is a pre-historic site located in Enduleni ward of Ngorongoro District in Arusha Region, Tanzania. The site is dated to the Plio-Pleistocene and famous for its Hominina footprints, preserved in volcanic ash. The site of the Laetoli footprints (Site G) is located 45 km south of Olduvai gorge. The location and tracks were discovered by archaeologist Mary Leakey and her team in 1976, and were excavated by 1978. Based on analysis of the footfall impressions &quot;The Laetoli Footprints&quot; provided convincing evidence for the theory of bipedalism in Pliocene Hominina and received significant recognition by scientists and the public. Since 1998, paleontological expeditions have continued under the leadership of Amandus Kwekason of the National Museum of Tanzania and Terry Harrison of New York University, leading to the recovery of more than a dozen new Hominina finds, as well as a comprehensive reconstruction of the paleoecology. The site is a registered National Historic Sites of Tanzania. 

Dated to 3.7 million years ago, they were the oldest known evidence of hominin bipedalism at that time. Subsequently, older &quot;Ardipithecus ramidus&quot; fossils were found with features that suggest bipedalism. With the footprints there were other discoveries excavated at Laetoli including Hominina and animal skeletal remains. Analysis of the footprints and skeletal structure showed clear evidence that bipedalism preceded enlarged brains in Hominina. At a species level, the identity of the Hominina who made the trace is difficult to construe precisely; &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot; is the species most commonly proposed.

==Background==

===History of research===
Laetoli was first recognized by western science in 1935 through a man named Sanimu, who convinced archeologist Louis Leakey to investigate the area. Several mammalian fossils were collected with a left lower canine tooth originally identified as that of a non-human primate, but later was revealed (in 1979, by P. Andrews and T. White) as the site&#x27;s first fossil hominin.

In 1938 and 1939, German archaeologist Ludwig Kohl-Larsen studied the site extensively. Several hominin remains, including premolars, molars, and incisors, were identified. A later excavation in 1959 revealed no new hominins, and Laetoli went relatively unexplored until 1974—when the discovery of a hominin premolar by George Dove revived interest in the site. Mary Leakey returned and almost immediately discovered the well-preserved remains of hominins. In 1978, Leakey&#x27;s 1976 discovery of hominin tracks—&quot;The Laetoli Footprints&quot;—provided convincing evidence of bipedalism in Pliocene hominins and gained significant recognition by both scientists and laymen.

===Possible tracemaker===
Although much debated, researchers have tentatively concluded that &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot; is the species of the three hominins who made the footprints at Laetoli. This conclusion is based on the reconstruction of the foot skeleton of a female &quot;A. afarensis&quot; hominin by anthropologists Tim D. White and Gen Suwa of the University of California, as well as detailed footprint analysis by Russel Tuttle of the University of Chicago; he compared human and other bipedal animals such as bears and primates, including gaits and foot structure, and taking into account the use of footwear. For gait Tuttle looked at the step length, stride length, stride width, and foot angle, and determined that &quot;A. afarensis&quot; was more human-like in gait than ape-like.

&quot;A. afarensis&quot; is an obligate bipedal hominin with the beginnings of sexual dimorphism attributed to its species, and brain size very similar to that of modern chimpanzees and gorillas. Analysis of the Laetoli footprints indicated the characteristics of obligate bipedalism: pronounced heel strike from deep impressions, lateral transmission of force from the heel to the base of the lateral metatarsal, a well-developed medial longitudinal arch, adducted big toe, and a deep impression for the big toe commensurate with toe-off.

===Age and dating techniques===
Two dating techniques were used to arrive at the approximate age of the beds that make up the ground layers at Laetoli: potassium-argon dating and analysis of stratigraphy. Based on these methods, the layers have been named as follows, starting with the deepest: Lower Laetolil Beds, Upper Laetolil Beds, Lower Ndolanya Beds, Upper Ndolanya Beds, Ogol lavas, Naibadad Beds, Olpiro Beds, and Ngaloba Beds; it is the ancient Laetolil Beds that contain the footprints trackway. The upper unit of the Laetolil Beds dated back 3.6 to 3.8 million years ago. The beds are dominantly tuffs and have a maximum thickness of 130 meters. No mammalian fauna were found in the lower unit of the Laetolil Beds, and no date could be assigned to this layer.

The Ndolanya Beds, which are located above the Laetolil Beds and underlie the Ogol lavas, are clearly divisible into upper and lower units separated by a widespread deposit of calcrete up to one meter thick. However, like the Lower Laetolil Beds, no date can be assigned to the Ndolanya Beds. The Ogol lavas date back 2.4 million years. No fauna or artifacts are known from the Naibadad Beds, but they are correlated with a bed layer at Olduvai Gorge based on mineral content. Pleistocene fauna and Acheulean artifacts have been found in the Olpiro Beds. Based on a trachytic tuff which occurs within the beds, the Ngaloba Beds may therefore be dated between 120,000 and 150,000 years BP.

==Discoveries==

===Hominina footprints from site G===

The principal discovery, made by Mary Leakey and her team in 1976 (and fully excavated by 1978), is a 75-foot (24-meter) line of Hominina fossil footprints, preserved in powdery volcanic ash originally thought to have been from an eruption of the nearby (20 km) Sadiman volcano. However, recent study of the Sadiman volcano has shown that it is not a source for the Laetoli Footprints Tuff (Zaitsev &quot;et al.&quot; 2011). Soft rain cemented the ash-layer (15 cm thick) to tuff without destroying the prints. In time, they were covered by other ash deposits.

The fossil footprints were rather whimsically discovered by Yale&#x27;s Andrew Hill when visiting Mary Leakey in 1976. While walking back to camp one evening, Hill fell trying to avoid a large ball of elephant dung thrown at him by a colleague. With his face only inches from the rock, he recognized footprints made by antelopes and rhinos preserved in the volcanic ash, and among these, hominid footprints.

The Hominina prints were produced by three individuals, one walking in the footprints of the other, making the preceding footprints difficult to recover. As the tracks lead in the same direction, they might have been produced by a group visiting a waterhole together, but there is nothing—or very little (see below, Interpretation and significance)—to support the common assumption of a nuclear family.

Roberto Sáez claims that this 27-metre trail of about 70 footprints was left by two &quot;Australopithecus&quot; walking in front, while the third hominid walked behind, superimposing its steps on the footprints left by one of the two in front. He acknowledges that it will never be possible to prove that this is true.

The footprints demonstrate that the Hominina habitually walked upright as there are no knuckle-impressions. The feet do not have the mobile big toe of apes; instead, they have an arch (the bending of the sole of the foot) typical of modern humans. The hominins seem to have moved in a leisurely stroll.

Computer simulations based on information from &quot;A. afarensis&quot; fossil skeletons and the spacing of the footprints indicate that the Hominina were walking at 1.0 m/s or above, which matches human walking speeds. The results of other studies have also supported the theory of a human-like gait.

===Hominina footprints from site S===
In 2015, footprints of the same age as the first reported footprints were unearthed at a site approximately 150 meters south of the original site G footprints. This site is called site S, and the 2 individuals who made the prints are named S1 and S2. S2 is represented by only 1 print, but S1 left a track of prints, the first 4 of which are shown in the composite image, along with an analysis of step and stride lengths. Further analysis indicated that individual S1 was considerably larger than any of the three individuals from site G.

===Other footprints and artifacts===
Other prints show the presence of twenty different animal species besides the hominin &quot;A. afarensis&quot;, among them hyenas, wild cats (Machairodus), baboons, wild boars, giraffes, gazelles, rhinos, several kinds of antelope, &quot;Hipparion&quot;, buffaloes, elephant relatives (of the extinct genus &quot;Deinotherium&quot;), hares and birds. Rain-prints can be seen as well. Few footprints are superimposed, which indicates that they were rapidly covered up. Most of the animals are represented by skeletal remains discovered in the area.

No artifacts have been found in the vicinity, at least within the ancient Laetolil Beds that contain the trackway. However, artifacts from the younger Olpiro and Ngaloba Beds, also preserved at Laetoli, have been found.

==Interpretation and significance==
Before the discovery of the Laetoli footprints, there was much debate as to which developed first in the human evolutionary time line: a larger brain or bipedalism. The discovery of these footprints settled the issue, proving that the Laetoli hominins were fully bipedal long before the evolution of the modern human brain, and were bipedal close to a million years before the earliest known stone tools were made. The footprints were classified as possibly belonging to &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot;.

Some analysts have noted in their interpretations that the smaller trail bears &quot;telltale signs that suggest whoever left the prints was burdened on one side.&quot; This may suggest that a female was carrying an infant on her hip but this cannot be proven for certain.

The footprints themselves were an unlikely discovery because they closely resemble modern human footprints, despite being almost 4 million years old. It is noted that the toe pattern is much the same as the human foot, which is much different from the feet of chimpanzees and other non-bipedal beings. The footprint impression has been interpreted as the same as the modern human stride, with the heel striking first and then a weight transfer to the ball of the foot before pushing off the toes.

Based on stratigraphic analysis, the findings also provide insight into the climate at the time of the making of the footprints. Pliocene sediments show that the environment was more moist and productive than now. Climate changes that caused a shift from forest to grassland environments have a strong correlation with upright posture and bipedalism in hominins. This could have initiated the evolution to bipedalism of the hominins found at Laetoli.

==Preservation and conservation==
In 1979, after the Laetoli footprints were recorded, they were re-buried as a then-novel way of preservation. The site was re-vegetated by acacia trees, which later gave rise to fears over root growth. In mid-1992, a GCI-Tanzanian team investigated this by opening a three-by-three meter trench, which showed that roots had damaged the footprints. However, the part of the trackway unaffected by root growth showed exceptional preservation. The success of the experiment led to an increased practice in reburials for preserving excavated sites.

In 1993, measures were taken to prevent erosion. The original trackway was remolded and new casts were made. As the trackway is very fragile, the new replica cast was used to guide re-excavation in the field. A team of specialists, one being Fiona Marshall, re-excavated half of the trackway to record its condition, stabilize the surface, extract dead roots and rebury it with synthetic geotextile materials. This allows the trackway surface to breathe, and protects it against root growth.

Proposals for lifting the track and moving it to an enclosed site have been suggested, but the cost is viewed as outweighing the benefits: the process would require much research, a large amount of money, and there is a risk of loss or damage. Thus, burial seems to be the most effective method of preservation.

<text>Watson&#x27;s water hammer pulse, also known as Corrigan&#x27;s pulse or collapsing pulse, is the medical sign (seen in aortic regurgitation) which describes a pulse that is bounding and forceful, rapidly increasing and subsequently collapsing, as if it were the sound of a water hammer that was causing the pulse.

==Diagnosis==
To feel a water hammer pulse: with the patient reclining, the examiner raises the patient&#x27;s arm vertically upwards. The examiner grasps the muscular part of the patient&#x27;s forearm. A water hammer pulse is felt as a tapping impulse that is transmitted through the bulk of the muscles. This happens because the blood that is pumped to the arm during systole is emptied very quickly due to the gravity effect on the raised arm. This results in the artery emptying back into the heart during diastole, increasing preload, and therefore increasing cardiac output, (as per the Frank–Starling mechanism) so that systolic blood pressure increases and a stronger pulse pressure can be palpated. 

==Causes==
Water hammer pulse is commonly found when a patient has aortic regurgitation. It can also be seen in other conditions which are associated with a hyperdynamic circulation. A more comprehensive list of causes follows:
* Physiological
** Fever
** Pregnancy
* Cardiac lesions
** Aortic regurgitation
** Patent ductus arteriosus
** Systolic hypertension
** Bradycardia
** Aortopulmonary window
** Aneurysm of sinus of Valsalva
* Syndromes or high-output states
** Anemia
** Cor pulmonale
** Cirrhosis of liver
** Beriberi
** Thyrotoxicosis
** Arteriovenous fistula
** Paget&#x27;s disease
* Other causes
** Chronic alcoholism

==Eponym==

&quot;Watson&#x27;s water hammer pulse&quot; and &quot;Corrigan&#x27;s pulse&quot; refer to similar observations. However, the former usually refers to measurement of a pulse on a limb, while the latter refers to measurement of the pulse of the carotid artery.
* &quot;Corrigan&#x27;s pulse&quot; is named for Sir Dominic Corrigan, the Irish physician, who characterized it in 1832.
* &quot;Watson&#x27;s water hammer pulse&quot; is named for Thomas Watson, who characterized it in 1844.

<text>Arizona State Prison Complex – Perryville is one of 13 prison facilities operated by the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC). ASPC-Perryville is located in Goodyear, Arizona.

ASPC-Perryville&#x27;s Lumley Unit houses the female death row.

In 1981, three units of the Perryville Complex, San Pedro, Santa Cruz, and San Juan (since renamed Lumley Unit), for minimum and medium custody male inmates was opened. In May 1982, Santa Maria Unit, for all custody levels of female inmates, began admitting inmates. ASPC-Perryville was converted to an all female facility in 2000. ASP-Yuma, a 250-bed adult male prison which opened in 1987 became a part of the Perryville Complex in October 1992 until November 1995 when it became its own prison complex Arizona State Prison Complex - Yuma. The Fourth of the housing units at ASPC-Perryville (previously San Juan) is named after Brent W. Lumley, an ADC correctional officer who was killed in the line of duty.

ASPC-Perryville has an inmate capacity of approximately 4,382 in 8 housing units and 2 special use units at security levels 2, 3, 4 and 5. The ADC uses a score classification system to assess inmates appropriate custody and security level placement. The scores range from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest risk or need. ASPC-Perryville is a modern, mixed security prison.

==History==
By 2019 prisoners had reported opening packages of food products which stated that human beings were not intended to consume the items.

===Death of Marcia Powell===

Marcia Powell was a 48-year-old inmate who died May 20, 2009, after exposure to 107 °F temperatures for four hours in an outside cage at Perryville Prison. Prison policy limits such outside confinement to a maximum of two hours. An autopsy report showed that Powell had first- and second-degree burns and a core body temperature of 108 degrees. She suffered burn blisters all over her body. The county medical examiner found the cause of death to be due to complications from heat exposure.

== Notable prisoners ==
=== On Death Row===
* Wendi Andriano – Andriano was convicted of the murder of her husband Joe Andriano. Her 33-year-old husband Joe was bludgeoned and stabbed to death in the couple&#x27;s apartment in Ahwatukee, Arizona. His autopsy revealed that he had sustained 23 blows to the skull, and traces of sodium azide (a toxin similar in activity to cyanide) were also found in his system. 
* Shawna Forde – on May 30, 2009, 29-year-old Raul Flores and his daughter, Brisenia, 9, of Arivaca, Arizona, were killed at home during a home invasion by Forde, Jason Eugene Bush, and Albert Gaxiola.
* Sammantha Allen – on July 12, 2011, police officers were called to Ame Deal&#x27;s home, where she was found dead in a small footlocker, having suffocated. Ame lived with a number of relatives, including her aunt and legal guardian, Cynthia Stoltzmann. Allen was Stoltzmann&#x27;s daughter. The family first told the police officers that Ame was playing hide-n-seek and locked herself in the trunk the night before, after the adults went to sleep. During interrogation, Sammantha and her husband John confessed to locking Ame in the trunk as a form of punishment, because she took a popsicle without permission.

<doc id="752828" wikidata="Q7370380" url="?curid=752828" title="Roth's spot">
<text>Roth&#x27;s spots, also known as Litten spots or the Litten sign, are non-specific red lesions with white or pale centres, seen on the retina of the eye and although traditionally associated with infective endocarditis, can occur in a number of other conditions including hypertension, diabetes, collagen vascular disease, extreme hypoxia, leukemia and HIV.

Red and white retinal spots were first observed in 1872 by Swiss physician Moritz Roth, and named &quot;Roth spots&quot; six years later by Moritz Litten. They are typically observed via fundoscopy (using an ophthalmoscope to view inside the eye) or slit lamp exam.

The original retinal spots identified in 1872 were attributed to nerve-fibres that had burst. Present-day analysis shows that they can be composed of coagulated fibrin including platelets, focal ischaemia, inflammatory infiltrate, infectious organisms, or neoplastic cells.

==Cause==
Roth&#x27;s spots occur in conditions that predispose to endothelial damage of retinal capillaries, that is when there is dysfunction and disruption of the endothelium of retinal capillaries. Looking through the microscope reveals lesions with white centers made mainly of fibrin, depicting a fibrin-platelet plug at the site of vessel damage.

==Associated conditions==
Conditions associated with Roth&#x27;s spots include:&quot;
* Infective endocarditis
* Anaemia/thrombocytopenia
* Collagen vascular disease
* Leukemia
* Hypertensive retinopathy
* Diabetic retinopathy
* Pre-eclampsia
* Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
* Extreme hypoxia
* Shaken-baby syndrome
and also:
* Candida albicans infection
* vascular diseases
* kala azar

==Prevalence==
Roth&#x27;s spots occur in only 5% of people with infective endocarditis. Litten, however reported a figure of 80%.

<text>Abithana Chintamani is an encyclopedia in Tamil language written by A. Singaravelu Mudaliar (1855 - 28 January 1931). It was the first comprehensive encyclopedia in the Tamil literature domain. The first edition, which contains a recommendation dated 1899 by V. Kanakasabai Pillai, published in 1910 and contained 1050 pages. The second edition, containing 1634 pages and includes a preface by the author&#x27;s son, was published posthumously in 1934 and is available in reprinted form.

==History==
On 14 September 1901, the Fourth Tamil Sangam, an academy dedicated to the Tamil language, was established in Madurai. It was founded by Pandithurai Thevar of the royal family of Sethupathis of Ramanathapuram. Thevar was seeking to publish an encyclopedia of Tamil literature. Meanwhile, Singaravelu Mudaliyar, a Tamil pandit working at Pachaiyappa&#x27;s College, Chennai had completed such a work, but had difficulties finding a publisher. Pandithurai Thevar, upon learning about the manuscript, financially supported its publication.

In the preface, Singaravelu Mudaliyar says:

<doc id="752836" wikidata="Q7272211" url="?curid=752836" title="Quine's paradox">
<text>Quine&#x27;s paradox is a paradox concerning truth values, stated by Willard Van Orman Quine. It is related to the liar paradox as a problem, and it purports to show that a sentence can be paradoxical even if it is not self-referring and does not use demonstratives or indexicals (i.e. it does not explicitly refer to itself). The paradox can be expressed as follows:

:&quot;yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation&quot; yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation.

If the paradox is not clear, consider each part of the above description of the paradox incrementally:

:it = &quot;yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation&quot;
:its quotation = &quot;yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation&quot;
:it preceded by its quotation = &quot;&quot;yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation&quot; yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation.&quot;

With these tools, the description of the paradox may now be reconsidered; it can be seen to assert the following:
:The statement &quot;&quot;″yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation″&quot; yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation&quot; is false.

In other words, the sentence implies that it is false, which is paradoxical—for if it is false, what it states is in fact true.

== Motivation ==
The liar paradox (&quot;This sentence is false&quot;, or &quot;The next sentence is true. The previous sentence is false&quot;) demonstrates essential difficulties in assigning a truth value even to simple sentences. Many philosophers attempting to explain the liar paradox – for examples see that article – concluded that the problem was with the use of demonstrative word &quot;this&quot; or its replacements. Once we properly analyze this sort of self-reference, according to those philosophers, the paradox no longer arises.

Quine&#x27;s construction demonstrates that paradox of this kind arises independently of such direct self-reference, for, no lexeme of the sentence refers to the &quot;sentence,&quot; though Quine&#x27;s sentence does contain a lexeme which refers to one of its &quot;parts&quot;. Namely, &quot;its&quot; near the end of the sentence is a possessive pronoun whose antecedent is the very predicate in which it occurs. Thus, although Quine&#x27;s sentence &quot;per se&quot; is not self-referring, it does contain a self-referring predicate.

== Application ==
Quine suggested an unnatural linguistic resolution to such logical antinomies, inspired by Bertrand Russell&#x27;s type theory and Tarski&#x27;s work. His system would attach levels to a line of problematic expressions such as &quot;falsehood&quot; and &quot;denote&quot;. Entire sentences would stand higher in the hierarchy than their parts. The form Clause about falsehood0&#x27; yields falsehood1&quot; will be grammatically correct, and Denoting0 phrase&#x27; denotes0 itself&quot; – wrong.

George Boolos, inspired by his student Michael Ernst, has written that the sentence might be syntactically ambiguous, in using multiple quotation marks whose exact mate marks cannot be determined. He revised traditional quotation into a system where the length of outer pairs of so-called &quot;q-marks&quot; of an expression is determined by the q-marks that appear inside the expression. This accounts not only for ordered quotes-within-quotes but also to, say, strings with an odd number of quotation marks.

In &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid&quot;, author Douglas Hofstadter suggests that the Quine sentence in fact uses an indirect type of self-reference. He then shows that indirect self-reference is crucial in many of the proofs of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems.

<doc id="752845" wikidata="Q961275" url="?curid=752845" title="Reveal (R.E.M. album)">
<text>Reveal is the twelfth studio album by American rock band R.E.M. It was released on May 14, 2001, through Warner Bros. Records and was the second of three albums by the band to be produced with Pat McCarthy. It was also R.E.M.&#x27;s second album as a three-piece following the departure of drummer Bill Berry, and includes contributions from the band&#x27;s touring members Joey Waronker, Scott McCaughey and Ken Stringfellow. The band recorded the album in various locations, including in Dublin, Miami, Vancouver, and their hometown of Athens, Georgia. The album saw R.E.M. continue to experiment with electronic music as they had on their previous album &quot;Up&quot; (1998), utilizing keyboards and drum machines, while also retaining elements of their earlier sound.

&quot;Reveal&quot; was a critical and commercial success. The album reached the top 10 in the US while topping the charts in the UK and throughout mainland Europe. Three singles were released—&quot;Imitation of Life&quot;, &quot;All the Way to Reno (You&#x27;re Gonna Be a Star)&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Take the Rain&quot;—with the former reaching the top 10 throughout Europe. Reviews were positive, with many highlighting the album&#x27;s melodic nature and combination of R.E.M.&#x27;s classic sound with electronic elements. The band did not tour in support of the album, with its promotion instead consisting mainly of television appearances, music videos, and a number of free concerts within major cities.

==Background==

In 1998, R.E.M. released &quot;Up&quot;, their eleventh studio album and first without drummer Bill Berry. While not as commercially successful as previous albums, it still sold well and spawned the hit singles &quot;Daysleeper&quot; and &quot;At My Most Beautiful&quot;. The recording of &quot;Up&quot; was a troubled process, due in no small part to Berry&#x27;s absence, and the band almost disbanded as a result. Stipe has said of the album&#x27;s mixing process: &quot;when we were mixing &quot;Up&quot;, we decided that it was all over. That record broke up the group.&quot; After mixing for &quot;Up&quot; had completed, manager Bertis Downs organized a week-long meeting in Idaho in an effort to keep the band intact. Described as a &quot;self-administered group therapy session&quot; in &quot;Reveal: The Story of R.E.M.&quot; by Johnny Black, the band recognized the changes and struggles caused by Berry&#x27;s absence and their reaction to his departure, while also deciding they wanted to continue as a band. Stipe has stated that at the time, he had, &quot;for the first time, [been] forced to imagine life without R.E.M. and it was terrifying. As we talked, I think each of us realized just how much the band meant to us.&quot;

Upon release, &quot;Up&quot; divided critics, attracting both praise and criticism for its change in sound and experimental material. At the time of its release, the band&#x27;s popularity had been shifting; &quot;Up&quot; sold faster and in comparatively better numbers in many European nations compared to the US. The band originally intended not to tour in promotion of the album, instead focusing on promoting through television performances. These included appearances on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;, &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot;, and &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, while the band also performed a live set for the sitcom &quot;Party of Five&quot;. However, they changed their minds and in February 1999 announced 45-show-long-tour of Europe and America. In April and May 1999, R.E.M. composed the soundtrack for &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, which included the single &quot;The Great Beyond&quot;, which would become their biggest UK hit, peaking at number three. Ken Stringfellow and Joey Waronker joined as permanent touring members at the time of the &quot;Up&quot; tour, alongside Scott McCaughey who had performed live with the band since the &quot;Monster&quot; tour. Touring commenced from June through September 1999, which included a performance at the Glastonbury Festival. The band found the tour to be much less stressful than their previous trek supporting &quot;Monster&quot; (1994), while Stipe later credited the performances with &quot;affirm[ing] our [the band&#x27;s] confidence in wanting to work with each other and wanting to keep on doing this.&quot;

==Writing and recording==

In February 2000, R.E.M. began rehearsals at West Clayton Street in Athens in preparation for a new album, with further rehearsals occurring in March at Royaltone Studios in Hollywood. The band began recording the basic tracks for the record in May, choosing Vancouver for the location due to its proximity to Seattle, where both guitarist Peter Buck and McCaughey lived. Additionally, for the recording process, Stipe wanted to work outside the U.S., both because he felt the album would be &quot;more at home away from home&quot;, and to avoid writer&#x27;s block, which had previously plagued him during the writing of &quot;Up&quot;. While in Vancouver, the band laid down tracks for more than 20 songs, with some being described by the band as &quot;embryonic&quot; and others being &quot;fully-realized.&quot; At this point in recording, Stipe described the album as &quot;kind of pick[ing] up where &quot;Up&quot; left off&quot; and stating &quot;some of it is pretty strange.&quot;
In June, Buck left for Seattle, leaving Stipe to complete lyrics. While writing, Stipe would travel to prevent writer&#x27;s block from reoccurring, which he has credited with helping him complete &quot;All the Way to Reno&quot; and &quot;Disappear&quot;. The band reformed in July at West Clayton Street to continue work. The bulk of the album was recorded between August and October at Dalkey Lodge in Ireland with Pat McCarthy returning as producer. String parts, arranged by Johnny Tate, were recorded on October 3–4, 2000 at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin, while the final recording sessions were done at John Keane Studios in Athens. Mixing was then done on October 31 at The Hit Factory in Miami.

Mills has stated that while recording &quot;Reveal&quot;, the band made an effort to use synthesizers to create sounds which possibly &quot;hadn&#x27;t been heard before&quot; and which were not made with the natural patches built into the synthesizers. While Stipe&#x27;s intention during the sessions was &quot;to be really melodic&quot;, Stringfellow would be asked to create a more dissonant, experimental counterpoint. The members of R.E.M. were particularly enthusiastic about Stringfellow&#x27;s contributions: &quot;The more off into my own personal vision of the deep end, the more they liked it,&quot; Stringfellow stated in &quot;Perfect Circle: The Story of R.E.M.&quot; by Tony Fletcher. &quot;All sorts of messed up crazy distorted things run through pedals, they were loving that.&quot; Waronker noted that Buck&#x27;s demos would frequently already feature fully-fledged drum parts programmed with drum machines, causing him to focus on &quot;what not to play&quot; or how to add to these programmed parts which stood on their own. After tracks were recorded, Buck would frequently bring tapes to his Seattle home and record overdubs by night.

Waronker noted that as opposed to &quot;Up&quot;, in which material tended to be pieced-together, Stipe created lyrics and melodies as the material for &quot;Reveal&quot; was being developed. The first track to be recorded for the album was &quot;She Just Wants to Be&quot;, during the May 2000 sessions in Vancouver. &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; was developed from a 1999 demo variously referred to as &quot;Fake Trumpet Chorus&quot; or simply &quot;Trumpet Chorus&quot;. The &quot;fake trumpets&quot; originally featured on the track were later replaced by a string section, which is heard on the final version. While working on the song, the band moved through a variety of tempos and instrumental palettes before settling on the acoustic guitar-centric arrangement of the final version. &quot;Saturn Return&quot; was written by Buck on piano. Parts of the recording were taken from a demo dating back to February 2000, which was combined with effects which were looped and played backwards. The band recorded &quot;The Lifting&quot; as a live take with Mills, McCaughey, Stringfellow, and Jamie Candiloro all on keyboards. The final version of &quot;I&#x27;ve Been High&quot; includes synth parts which were originally intended for &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;; these were replaced on the latter song by a keyboard solo by Stringfellow. &quot;Chorus and the Ring&quot; was recorded in a single take and developed from an improptu jam. Mills had not yet heard the song at the time of recording, and so Buck led him through the chords as it was being recorded and his bassline was improvised. &quot;Disappear&quot; evolved from a demo entitled &quot;Underwater Acoustic&quot;, while other working titles included &quot;32-Chord Song&quot; (later &quot;Summer Turns to High&quot;) and &quot;Jimmy Webb on Mars&quot; (later &quot;All the Way to Reno&quot;).

During the recording sessions, the band recorded a track entitled &quot;Fascinating&quot;, which was removed from the record at the last moment. While Mills described the track as &quot;very beautiful&quot;, the band felt its inclusion made the album &quot;too long&quot; as well as &quot;too slow in the middle.&quot; Buck also felt the song would have &quot;worked perfectly&quot; on the record, but the band made a conscious choice to not release another album with a length of 64–65 minutes, leading to the song&#x27;s exclusion. &quot;Fascinating&quot; was later covered by the duo Fischerspooner in 2009, while the R.E.M. version has also been leaked through the Internet. Another song, entitled &quot;Free Form Jazz Jam&quot;, also appeared on early potential tracklists but did not make the final album.

Once recording had completed, Stipe compared the process favorably to that of &quot;Up&quot;, calling it &quot;remarkably happy&quot; and stating the band had &quot;become acclimated to new conditions and potentials.&quot; McCaughey echoed this, speaking fondly of the experience recording in Vancouver for its relaxed environment and the atmosphere in the studio. McCaughey noted that since Stipe already had some of the lyrics while songs were being recorded, the band would track with his vocals, which he credited with causing the &quot;Reveal&quot; sessions to feel more like a &quot;real band&quot; working in the studio as opposed to those for the previous album.

==Composition==

&quot;Reveal&quot; features a meld of electronic and live instrumentation, with the material being more melodic and accessible than on &quot;Up&quot;. The album has generally been regarded as a more optimistic and upbeat album compared to its predecessor. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine has compared the album to U2&#x27;s successful 2000 release &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot;, calling it a &quot;conscious return to [R.E.M.&#x27;s] classic sound&quot;. Fletcher describes the album as consisting mainly of &quot;mid-paced songs that could easily pass as ballads, full of ethereal sound effects&quot;, while Ryan Leas of &quot;Stereogum&quot; sums it up as an album of &quot;sad beach songs&quot; which &quot;play with electronic and synth textures... all glowing, sunburt, flickering.&quot; Buck has described the sound of &quot;Reveal&quot; as &quot;warm and layered and analogue&quot; while also having &quot;a distance and breath to it that&#x27;s modern and complete and liberating... like a beautiful vacuum.&quot; Stipe intended for &quot;Reveal&quot; to be a &quot;summer record&quot;, which Fletcher notes is displayed in song titles such as &quot;I&#x27;ll Take the Rain&quot;, &quot;Beachball&quot;, and &quot;Summer Turns to High&quot;. Additionally, Stipe utilizes a more relaxed singing style throughout, while Stringfellow has noted a lyrical theme of &quot;personal transformation&quot;, as well as &quot;rising, not just from adversity, but your own boundaries and limitations, the little pitfalls and weaknesses that hold you back.&quot;

Many publications have noted multiple tracks on the album as being heavily influenced by the Beach Boys, particularly &quot;Beat a Drum&quot;, &quot;Summer Turns to High&quot;, and &quot;Beachball&quot;. Leas considers &quot;Reveal&quot; to be a &quot;deeply Californian&quot; work including elements of psychedelia, while its &quot;big Stipe melodies&quot; are intertwined with a &quot;gorgeous, lush, aqueous sound unlike anything they [the band] did before or since.&quot; Stipe worked to make a cohesive record, avoiding songs which &quot;stood out or made you want to change the record.&quot; Mills has stated that &quot;some of [&quot;Reveal&quot;s] songs are actually very sparse, but they have some beautiful sounds within the sparseness.&quot;

===Chorus side===

The album&#x27;s opener, &quot;The Lifting&quot;, was written as a prequel to &quot;Daysleeper&quot; and features the same character. David Buckley, author of &quot;R.E.M&quot; &quot;Fiction: An Alternative Biography&quot;, states that the song references psychic and spiritual healing programs while relating to themes of self-improvement and self-help. The song includes a guitar solo in which Buck uses an e-bow, while Buckley compares its &quot;mantric&quot; drum figure to that of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;. The final version of &quot;The Lifting&quot; is a &quot;funkier&quot; arrangement devised by the band after its earlier arrangement was deemed too similar to &quot;All the Way to Reno&quot;. Johnny Black lists &quot;I&#x27;ve Been High&quot; among the album&#x27;s &quot;gorgeously atmospheric ballads&quot;, while Buckley considers it to be &quot;solemn, stately and emotional&quot;, with &quot;subtle dance textures and beats&quot; beneath Stipe&#x27;s vocal. Stringfellow considered the song to be the &quot;masterwork&quot; of the record, as he felt it &quot;push[ed] the boundary of what defines [R.E.M.] musically.&quot; For &quot;All the Way to Reno (You&#x27;re Gonna Be a Star)&quot;, Stipe wrote lyrics from the point of view of, according to Buckley, &quot;an aspirant female on the road to fame.&quot; Buck has noted an &quot;ironic&quot; element to the lyrics. Black considers the song one of R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;most lush and blatantly commercial pieces of work&quot;, while Buckley has noted its &quot;echoes of old-style R.E.M. rootsiness.&quot; Buck has cited the song as an example of a track whose creation was spurred by his purchase of a new instrument, in this case a glockenspiel. In the liner notes to the band&#x27;s compilation album &quot;In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988–2003&quot;, Buck stated the song was intended as a &quot;sick tribute&quot; to songwriter Jimmy Webb, citing the use of six-string bass guitar and the song&#x27;s &quot;semi-rococo chord changes&quot; as examples of Webb&#x27;s influence. Mills has named the song&#x27;s bassline as one of his favorites and has stated it consists of the first lines he played once he heard Buck&#x27;s guitar parts.

&quot;She Just Wants to Be&quot; starts with &quot;organic&quot; instrumentation such as acoustic guitar, and ends with &quot;computer-driven synth strings&quot; intertwined with traditional orchestration. In &quot;R.E.M&quot; &quot;Fiction&quot;, Mills praises Tate&#x27;s arrangements on the song, as he felt the mix of real and synthesized strings helped to alleviate their &quot;saccharine nature.&quot; Of the subject matter, Buck has simply stated the song was written about &quot;a person – someone I think we&#x27;ve met.&quot; &quot;Disappear&quot; begins with an acoustic intro which has been compared to the band&#x27;s earlier song &quot;Swan Swan H&quot; (1986), while its verses contain a &quot;Nick Cave-style tension&quot;. The song was inspired by Stipe&#x27;s trip to Israel, while Buck has called it a song about &quot;self-effacement.&quot; During the trip, Stipe attended a rave in Tel Aviv, in which a fan asked what he was doing there; his response was &quot;I came to disappear.&quot; Radiohead&#x27;s then-recent album &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000), contained a song entitled &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot;, which made Stipe nervous about having possibly taken the idea. After calling Thom Yorke, lead vocalist of Radiohead and friend of Stipe&#x27;s, to explain, Yorke assured Stipe that &quot;Disappear&quot; was his own song and that lines from &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; were inspired by Stipe: &quot;I stole some lines from something you told me, so if you take anything from me, it&#x27;s OK.&quot; Buckley considers &quot;Saturn Return&quot; to be the &quot;oddest&quot; track on &quot;Reveal&quot;, as well as &quot;the creepiest track R.E.M. ever cut.&quot; During the demo session which spawned the song, Buck encouraged the other musicians to find &quot;the weirdest sound on [their] instrument that [they could] possibly imagine.&quot; Stringfellow contributed a guitar part which he compared to Sonic Youth and also considered a &quot;homage&quot; to Buck&#x27;s own &quot;primitivist&quot; style. Austin Saalman of &quot;Under the Radar&quot; calls the song a &quot;bleak piano ballad&quot;, while Lindsay Zoladz of &quot;The New York Times&quot; has described the lyrical content as a &quot;character study of a late-shift convenience store employee, who climbs to the building’s roof and has an awakening while staring at the night sky.&quot;

===Ring side===

&quot;Beat a Drum&quot; is one of multiple songs from &quot;Reveal&quot; to earn comparisons to the Beach Boys. Buckley considers the track to be the only other likely single choice on the album after from &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; (though the former did not receive a single release), crediting its &quot;beautiful&quot; melody by Mills. Annie Jo Baker of &quot;PopMatters&quot; compares the guitar work on the verses to the Kinks, while Saalman has declared the track to be &quot;the band&#x27;s warmest song to date.&quot; Buckley considers the lines &quot;Beat a drum for me, like a butterfly wing / Tropical storm across the ocean&quot; to be a reference to chaos theory and the butterfly effect. Mills used the track as an example of the benefits of using a producer; McCarthy instructed Mills to write a bridge for the song, but upon hearing the bridge, encouraged Mills to switch the positions of it and the chorus.

&quot;Imitation of Life&quot; takes its title from the 1959 Douglas Sirk film of the same name, as the band found it to be a &quot;perfect metaphor for adolescence.&quot; Buckley feels the song &quot;&quot;would not have been out of place on [the band&#x27;s 1991 release] &quot;Out of Time&quot;&quot; and &quot;may be the most recognizably R.E.M.-sounding track on the album.&quot; He also compares its &quot;aggressive wall of acoustic guitar&quot; to George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; (1970) and R.E.M.&#x27;s own &quot;Talk About the Passion&quot; (1984). Buck has noted that the chord progression in the verses shares similarities with the band&#x27;s earlier song &quot;Driver 8&quot; (1985). Mills has stated the song was almost removed from &quot;Reveal&quot; for being &quot;too R.E.M.&quot;, but the band were discouraged from removing it. Its lyrics contain a &quot;cameo of teenage discomfort, that state of being desperate to impress, yet self-conscious and clumsy.&quot;

&quot;Summer Turns to High&quot; is another Beach Boys-influenced track. After being shown the original version of the song, which had an &quot;Irish feel&quot; utilizing acoustic guitars and accordions, Stipe liked it but found it to be too busy, and so it was re-arranged to consist of just drums, bass, and a single keyboard with Stipe&#x27;s vocal melody, which &quot;pushed it completely out to left field.&quot; According to Baker, the song &quot;combines &#x27;60s and &#x27;80s sounds and recondenses them as turn-of-the-millennium indie.&quot; &quot;Chorus and the Ring&quot; was written as a tribute to Kurt Cobain and William S. Burroughs. John Everhart of &quot;Under the Radar&quot; notes the contrast between the dark lyrics and the song&#x27;s &quot;Celtic folk stomp.&quot;

Jordan Potter of &quot;Far Out&quot; describes &quot;I&#x27;ll Take the Rain&quot; as &quot;humble offering with an acoustic structure deftly adorned with orchestral strings and Ken Stringfellow’s keys.&quot; Baker states the song &quot;pairs self-empowering but melancholic lyrics with optimistic instrumentation and vocals.&quot; Stipe says this song is the &quot;odd one out&quot; on the album, being the only &quot;winter song&quot; on an otherwise summer-themed record. His intention was to &quot;write a lyric that matched the tone of the music&quot;, while also creating a song which &quot;balance[d] all [the] sunniness&quot; of the rest of &quot;Reveal&quot;. &quot;Beachball&quot;, the closing track, contains live strings in the verses and synth strings in chorus. &quot;Far Out&quot; says the song &quot;borrow[s] from the surf rockers’ trademark sound of bright chords and sentimental vocal harmonies.&quot; Saalman notes its &quot;jingling bells, the weeping strings, [and] chorus of horns&quot; and compares the track to the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Caroline, No&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting for the Day&quot; Its original lyric was about drug dealing on the streets of Vancouver, but it was changed to be, according to Buck, about &quot;people having fun at the beach.&quot;

==Release==
At the time of its release, the members of R.E.M. emphasized the happier atmosphere when writing and recording &quot;Reveal&quot; in contrast with their previous few releases. Stipe declared the album to be his favorite at this time; he has continued to name it and &quot;New Adventures in Hi-Fi&quot; among his favorite R.E.M. albums. Mills declared that it was &quot;more focused than the last album&quot; because they &quot;didn&#x27;t have an ongoing crisis to contend with as we made it. We were free to concentrate on having fun.&quot; The title of the album was suggested by Bertis Downs and comes from the lyric &quot;have I missed the big reveal?&quot; in &quot;I&#x27;ve Been High&quot;.

===Commercial performance===

&quot;Imitation of Life&quot; was delivered to radio stations in March 2001, and was commercially released as the album&#x27;s first single in April. The song reached number six in the UK, becoming their second consecutive top 10 hit there. However, the single stalled at number 83 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and sold only 15,000 copies in the US. It fared better on the Adult Alternative Songs chart, where it had a three-week stay at the top. The song was supported by a Garth Jennings-directed video consisting of a 20-second loop of film capturing an elaborate pool party, played forwards and backwards and zoomed in and out; it was filmed over two weeks in February 2001 and included a cast of 76 people. &quot;All the Way to Reno&quot; was chosen as the album&#x27;s second single and released on July 23. The song was moderately successful, peaking at number 24 in the UK and number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Alternative Songs chart. Its video, directed by Michael Moore was filmed at Bishop Ford High School in Brooklyn, New York, with a camera crew consisting of students. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;I&#x27;ll Take the Rain&quot;, was released on November 19. It missed the top 40 in the UK, peaking at number 44.

The album itself was released on May 14, 2001, in the UK and the following day in the US. It entered the UK charts at number one, selling 33,000 copies in the first day of release and 110,000 in its first week. The album also debuted at number one in Italy (where it sold 130,000 copies in its first week, already reaching Platinum status), Austria, Ireland, Norway, and Switzerland, while it also rose to the top in Germany. In Brazil and Belgium, the album peaked at number two, while it reached the top 10 in Japan, Australia, France, Thailand, and Canada. By the end of the month, sales of &quot;Reveal&quot; had exceeded a million copies in Europe; in many countries its sales surpassed those of &quot;Up&quot; before the release of a second single. In the US, the album reached number six, the band&#x27;s lowest peak since the introduction of Nielsen SoundScan in 1991. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on June 20, 2001, for sales in excess of 500,000 copies in the US. Worldwide sales have since exceeded four million copies.

===Promotion===

Inspired by their experience performing at the open-air South African Freedom Day concert in Trafalgar Square, London on April 27, R.E.M. considered performing free shows within city squares to promote &quot;Reveal&quot; in lieu of a traditional tour. However, city authorities were unenthusiastic about the idea, and so the band performed only two further concerts in this vein, one in Cologne and one in Toronto. In the US, a promotional CD entitled &quot;Not Bad for No Tour&quot; was released, displaying international chart positions and sales figures in its packaging. In June, the band traveled to Los Angeles to record voiceovers for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, while later in August, they appeared on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; performing &quot;All the Way to Reno&quot;. American promotion for &quot;Reveal&quot; was mainly limited to television performances, including appearances on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. Additionally, the band played one show each at the Museum of Television and Radio in New York and Los Angeles.

==Critical reception==
Upon release, &quot;Reveal&quot; was received positively by critics. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, &quot;Reveal&quot; has received an average score of 76, indicating &quot;generally positive reviews.&quot; Multiple reviewers have compared the album to &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; (2000) by U2, noting it as a &quot;return to form&quot; and a &quot;conscious return to their classic sound.&quot; Bono himself has praised the album: &quot;&quot;Reveal&quot; is extraordinary. I know it&#x27;s extraordinary because I felt ill when I heard it. It&#x27;s a very beautiful, awe-inspiring record.&quot; The album also earned comparisons to the band&#x27;s own &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; (1992), and was praised for showing the band begin to fully recover from Berry&#x27;s departure.

Adam Sweeting of &quot;The Guardian&quot; feels that with the album, the band &quot;settles into a convincing identity as a trio.&quot; He laments what he feels to be a lack of new territory for the band, with the exception of &quot;Saturn Return&quot;, which &quot;gently evoke[s] the spirit of Brian Eno.&quot; However, he also notes the band could &quot;knock together a heartrending anthem out of next to nothing&quot;; Sweeting uses &quot;I&#x27;ve Been High&quot; as an example, calling it &quot;possibly [the album&#x27;s] finest moment&quot; and praising its simplicity. In a review for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Keith Phipps states that 21 years into their career, R.E.M. still &quot;continue to surprise.&quot; He cites many of the album&#x27;s electronic experiments as continuations of &quot;Up&quot;, while its songs rely &quot;less on single moods&quot; in comparison to that album.

Will Hermes of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; is among those who consider the album a &quot;return to form&quot;. He names &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Take the Rain&quot; as highlights. However, he also notes Mills&#x27; lowered presence on backing vocals, as well as opining that the album is &quot;haunted by an ennui that&#x27;s curious for a band that made their name by talking about the passion.&quot; Dave Heaton of &quot;PopMatters&quot; summed up &quot;Reveal&quot; as &quot;a lush, dreamy pop mood-piece that hovers in the realm of rumination and introspection.&quot; Heaton argues that the album has more in common with the band&#x27;s earlier &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot; (1985) rather than &quot;Up&quot;, due to a focus on &quot;melancholy, midtempo pop&quot; and a return to more enigmatic and &quot;artsy&quot; themes. &quot;NME&quot;s April Long summed up the album as &quot;R.E.M. remembering who they are, and reaffirming why they do what they do.&quot; Long praises its simplicity, saying it prioritizes &quot;minutiae and subtlety&quot; in lieu of &quot;grand gestures.&quot; She also states that while she found it to initially be an &quot;underwhelming&quot; listen, it eventually becomes &quot;gracefully rewarding.&quot;

Some reviews were more mixed. Matt LeMay of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave the album a rating of 5.0 out of 10, stating he found the album&#x27;s electronic elements to be &quot;superficial&quot; and felt they created an overly busy sound. He also found many of its songs to be repetitive, without stronger melodies or more variation to improve the tracks. LeMay does state that despite some &quot;terrible lyrics&quot;, &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; possesses &quot;a catchy hook, and a sufficient degree of sonic variety&quot;, while &quot;The Lifting&quot; contains &quot;an undeniably great melody.&quot; Robert Christgau scored the album at a B− and named it his &quot;dud of the month&quot;, feeling it was &quot;not as bad as it first sounds, but also not as good as they thought when they released it, or they wouldn&#x27;t have, I hope.&quot;

Retrospectively, the album has continued to receive positive reviews. In an article commemorating the 20th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release, Ryan Leas of &quot;Stereogum&quot; declares &quot;Reveal&quot; as possibly &quot;the most underrated album in [R.E.M.&#x27;s] hallowed catalogue.&quot; He notes that in comparison to the anxiety expressed on &quot;Up&quot;, &quot;Reveal&quot; is &quot;warm&quot; and &quot;vibrant&quot;, while also harboring a &quot;wistfulness and melancholia.&quot; In Annie Jo Baker&#x27;s &quot;PopMatters&quot; retrospective, she highlights the album&#x27;s ability to maintain a consistent sound without lacking &quot;classic R.E.M. eccentricity.&quot; She also notes the mix of optimism and sadness throughout the record, stating it &quot;invok[es] the kind of melancholic cheer shown by a parent watching their child grow up.&quot;

===Band opinions===

The members of R.E.M. have spoken highly of &quot;Reveal&quot; since its release. At the time, Stipe felt the album had &quot;proven to ourselves that as a trio we can be a successful creative unit.&quot; He continues to rank &quot;Reveal&quot;, alongside &quot;New Adventures in Hi-Fi&quot; (1996), among his favorite R.E.M. albums. Some time after release, Buck stated he found &quot;Reveal&quot; to be &quot;equal to &quot;Automatic&quot; [&quot;for the People&quot;]&quot;. In a 2023 interview with &quot;Vulture&quot;, Mills selected it as the R.E.M. album most deserving of a reapprasial, calling it a &quot;hidden gem&quot; and describing it as &quot;not a rock record per se, but it&#x27;s a beautiful-music record.&quot;

<doc id="752850" wikidata="Q2559672" url="?curid=752850" title="Boddingtons Brewery">
<text>Boddingtons Brewery was a regional brewery in Manchester, England, which owned pubs throughout the North West. Boddingtons was best known for Boddingtons Bitter (Boddies), a straw-golden, hoppy bitter which was one of the first beers to be packaged in cans containing a widget, giving it a creamy draught-style head.

In the 1990s, the beer was promoted as The Cream of Manchester in a popular advertising campaign credited with raising Manchester&#x27;s profile. Boddingtons became one of the city&#x27;s most famous products after Manchester United and &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

Whitbread bought Boddingtons Brewery in 1989 and Boddingtons Bitter received an increased marketing budget and nationwide distribution. Boddingtons achieved its peak market share in 1997 and at the time was exported to over forty countries.

Boddingtons beer brands are now owned by the global brewer Anheuser–Busch InBev, which acquired the Whitbread Beer Company in 2000. Strangeways Brewery closed in 2004 and production of pasteurised (keg and can) Boddingtons was moved to Samlesbury in Lancashire. Production of the cask-conditioned beer moved to Hydes Brewery in Moss Side, Manchester, until it was discontinued in 2012, ending the beer&#x27;s association with the city.

==History==

===1778–1969===

Strangeways Brewery was founded in 1778 by two-grain merchants, Thomas Caister and Thomas Fry, just north of what is now Manchester city centre. Their principal customers were the cotton workers of Manchester, then a burgeoning mill town.

Henry Boddington, born in 1813 in Thame, Oxfordshire, joined the brewery in 1832 as a travelling salesman when the brewery was in the possession of Hole, Potter and Harrison. Like most Manchester breweries at the time, it was a modestly sized operation. Boddington had become a partner by 1848, alongside John and James Harrison, and by this time the company went under the name John Harrison &amp; Co.

In January 1853, Boddington borrowed money to become its sole owner. Between Boddington&#x27;s takeover until 1877, the brewery&#x27;s output increased tenfold from 10,000 to 100,000 barrels a year, making it not only Manchester&#x27;s largest brewery but one of the largest in the North of England, with over 100 tied houses. By 1883 Henry Boddington &amp; Co. was a limited liability company. Henry Boddington&#x27;s estate was valued at almost £150,000 when he died in 1886.

After Henry Boddington&#x27;s death, his son, William Slater Boddington became company chairman, and the company went public in 1888 when it was estimated to have assets of £320,465. It was now known as Boddingtons Breweries Ltd.

Its major local competitors were Groves and Whitnall, Threlfalls, and the Manchester Brewing Company. The company owned 212 public houses by 1892, making it the twelfth largest tied estate in the United Kingdom. The tied estate was mostly freehold.

Boddingtons was one of the breweries implicated in the 1900 English beer poisoning epidemic, in which 6,000 people were poisoned by arsenic and 70 died.

In January 1902, 86 percent of production was of mild ale.

Following the death of W. Slater Boddington in 1908, the family retained an interest in the company and continued to take a practical hand in its running. Henry&#x27;s youngest son, Robert Slater Boddington (1862–1930) had a fifty-year association with the company and oversaw the installation of a bottling hall in the 1920s.

Robert&#x27;s third and fourth sons Philip (1893–1952) and Charles (1897–1982) served as joint chairman following the death of their father in 1930, and Charles took sole responsibility after Philip died.

By the 1930s, the Boddington family shareholding had dwindled to around 40 per cent. On 22 December 1940, the brewery water tanks were hit by bombs during the Manchester Blitz, and the brewery had to be closed down for several months, with production moved temporarily to the nearby Hydes Brewery. The brewery was rebuilt with the most up-to-date and modern equipment of the time, and was the first in Europe to install stainless steel brewing vats.

Pale ale or &quot;bitter&quot; rapidly grew in popularity after the Second World War and overtook mild in sales from the 1950s.

Whitbread, a large brewery, took a 13 per cent stake in the company in 1961. In 1962 the company purchased Richard Clarke &amp; Co of Reddish, Stockport, adding 60 public houses to the firm.

===Mergers and acquisitions===
In 1969 the large Allied Breweries combine initiated a hostile takeover bid for Boddingtons, which valued the company at £5 million. Charles Boddington took the unusual step of issuing a spirited defence of the company to the shareholders: You will be only too aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, at this moment in time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate ... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do nothing for the national economy, add nothing to the nation&#x27;s exports, and contribute nothing at all to the quality of life that we are all used to enjoy.

The company&#x27;s independence was maintained after Whitbread acted as a white knight by raising its stake in the company from 13 to 23 per cent, and the family and many small shareholders refused to sell their stakes. The chairman of Whitbread, Colonel Whitbread, is reputed to have said, &quot;You are a very old firm. You have a very good name. You mustn&#x27;t go out.&quot; At the time, it was rare for a company to win the emotional argument for independence, and it was the first time a regional brewery had headed off an offer from a national company. In 1970, Charles Boddington retired and his son Ewart assumed the directorship.

In 1971, Allied Breweries sold its 35 per cent stake in the company, leaving Whitbread 25 per cent and the Boddington family 10 per cent, with the remainder of company shares held by small shareholders in the Manchester area. That year Guinness Draught stout and Heineken lager were introduced into the tied estate. During the 1970s the company operated within a 70-mile radius of Manchester, and growth was driven by the increasing popularity of its main product, Boddingtons Bitter. &quot;The Observer&quot; commented in 1974 that Boddingtons cheap pricing and distinctive flavour afforded it an unusually loyal following. In 1981 the same newspaper commented, what has stood Boddingtons in good stead is the highly distinctive flavour of its brews, especially its bitters. In fact, in the North-West, Boddies is increasingly becoming a sort of cult brew.

In 1982, Boddingtons bought the Oldham Brewery for £23 million, hoping to combine Oldham&#x27;s strength in lager and keg bitter with their own expertise in cask ales. After the acquisition, the company owned 272 public houses, 70 per cent of which were within 20 miles of its Manchester brewery. In 1983, Boddingtons Bitter was distributed in the Home Counties for the first time. In 1985 Boddingtons paid £27.5 million for the 160,000 barrel capacity Higsons Brewery in Liverpool and its tied estate of 160 public houses to form a combine with a £65 million turnover. &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that the company had paid mere asset value for Higsons as the company had been reporting poor profits. There was virtually no overlap between the two companies, and the takeover brought Boddingtons to Merseyside for the first time. By this time Strangeways was producing only two beers, a bitter and a mild, with bitter constituting over 90 per cent of production. In 1986, the company employed 280 people and operated 530 tied houses, and while Strangeways Brewery had a capacity of 500,000 barrels a year, it was operating at around 50 per cent capacity. That year the company introduced its own lager, brewing Kaltenberg under licence.

In 1987, the company rejected a £270 million reverse takeover bid by Midsummer Leisure. By this time Boddingtons had a tied estate of 520 pubs. In 1988, the company closed the Oldham Brewery with the loss of 70 jobs, and shed 140 transport jobs at Higsons and Strangeways by contracting out delivery work to TNT.

Boddingtons remained independent until 1989, when Ewart Boddington sold Strangeways Brewery and the Boddingtons brand (but not the tied estate) to Whitbread for £50.7 million. Whitbread was motivated to plug a gap in its portfolio by owning a credible national cask ale brand. The sale was amicable, with both parties aware that Whitbread capital and distribution could make the Boddingtons brand national, although some Boddington family board members had been resistant to the sale. Boddingtons had been in decline before the Whitbread takeover, and although it retained an almost &quot;cult&quot; following within its Manchester heartland, only 5 per cent of sales were outside the North West.

===Whitbread era===

Whitbread transformed the brand from regional to national, expanding production from 200,000 to 850,000 barrels a year between 1989 and 1995. By 1993 the cask version was outsold only by Tetley and John Smith&#x27;s, and the majority of sales were outside of the North West. By 1994 it was the fourth-highest selling bitter brand in the country. The canned variant was distributed nationwide from 1990 and was the highest-selling canned bitter in the UK from 1992 until 2000. The beer was officially exported overseas from 1993, initially to Canada. The rise in sales of the beer coincided with the elevation of Manchester from &quot;city of dark, beaten mills to the cultural magnet of Madchester&quot;. Manchester and the North of England were now fashionable in the public consciousness and rejuvenated from industrial slump. Whitbread chief executive Peter Jarvis commented in 1995 that:

Success was attributed to an excellent marketing campaign, and being the first canned ale to be sold with a widget after Guinness. In 1997 Boddingtons sales peaked, and 1998 saw a drop in sales of 10 per cent. Boddingtons had been turned into: &quot;a fashion product ... and as with all fashion products, the drinkers moved on&quot;. In 1998 production of the Flowers ale brands was moved to Strangeways. Boddingtons&#x27; share of the UK ale market grew to 4.9 per cent in 1998–1999, and sales grew by 7.3 percent during 1999–2000.

Meanwhile, in 1995 the independent owner of the 450-strong former Boddingtons tied estate, The Boddington Group, was taken over by Greenalls.

===Interbrew takeover===
In May 2000 the Whitbread Beer Company was acquired by the Belgian brewer Interbrew, which owned Stella Artois. At that time over ten percent of Boddingtons production was exported to some 40 countries worldwide, including China, the United States, Taiwan and the West Indies. The Strangeways Brewery kegging facility closed in February 2003 with the loss of 50 jobs. In August 2003, amidst falling sales, Interbrew relaunched the cask product in the North West of England, with an increased strength. The relaunch was unsuccessful and the changes were reversed.

In September 2004 the owners (now known as InBev) announced plans to close the Strangeways Brewery and move most production from Manchester to Magor in South Wales and Samlesbury, Lancashire, with the loss of 60 jobs. Two years earlier the brewery had employed 250 people. Boddingtons cask ale production, which accounted for less than 10 per cent of output, was moved to Hydes Brewery in Moss Side. The closure plan was made despite the company admitting the brewery was profitable but the brewery site had become a valuable property asset and was subsequently sold for £12 million to developers. A spokesman for the firm argued: &quot;[The] building was built in the Victorian times and it is an old historic brewery but it was a victim of its age. It is an inflexible brewery – it can&#x27;t bottle or can and customer needs have moved on&quot;.
Production ended in February 2005 and the brewery was demolished in 2007. &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; described the move by InBev as &quot;unsentimental&quot;.

In May 2010 it was speculated in &quot;The Times&quot; that InBev (Anheuser-Busch InBev from 2008 onwards) would attempt to sell the Boddingtons brand to another brewer after its failed attempt to sell the UK rights to Bass ale. The newspaper was damning of what it perceived as InBev&#x27;s mismanagement of the brand, which had &quot;declined under AB InBev&#x27;s hands. The brand was once a leading part of the old Whitbread Beer Company, but its fortunes had dwindled since the closure in 2005 of the Strangeways Brewery.&quot;

In 2010 Boddingtons was the sixth-highest selling bitter in the United Kingdom, although sales had dropped by almost three-quarters since the takeover by Anheuser–Busch InBev in 2000. In July 2011 AB InBev&#x27;s UK president Stuart MacFarlane claimed &quot;We still believe in the brand&quot; whilst admitting to not advertising the brand for five years, instead reaping the rewards of memories of earlier advertising. Contract brewing of Boddingtons Cask continued until March 2012 when production of the beer ended.

Production was around 250,000 hectolitres in 2012, with around 80 percent of production destined for the UK market, and around 20 percent for export markets such as Taiwan, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.

==Beers==

Boddingtons has a distinctive straw-golden coloured body with a creamy white head, which in its modern form is achieved by the addition of nitrogen in an attempt to replicate the traditional head from serving the cask beer through a sparkler.
* Boddingtons Draught Bitter (3.5% ABV)
:The nitrogenated and pasteurised variant of the beer available in kegs and cans. It is brewed in Samlesbury. The canned variant, launched in 1991, contains a widget to give the beer a creamy white head. The beer&#x27;s ABV was reduced from 3.8% to 3.5% in late 2008. On draught in the United Kingdom it is typically served at 5 to 7 degrees Celsius, although an Extra Cold variant served at 3 to 5 degrees Celsius has been available since 2006. Its taste, or perceived lack of it, has been criticised by some, with Andrew Jefford describing it as a &quot;blandly foamy nitrokeg travesty of the original [cask conditioned version]&quot;.
* Boddingtons Pub Ale (4.6% ABV)
:A higher ABV version of Boddingtons Draught Bitter, brewed since 1993 for export markets. It was available in the United Kingdom from 1995–6 as Boddingtons Export, on draught and in widget bottles.
* Boddingtons Manchester Gold (4.8% ABV)
:After Export was delisted by British supermarkets in 1996, Boddingtons launched a 4.8% hybrid ale with a £4m advertising campaign referencing the Calvin Klein &quot;Obsession&quot; perfume adverts. Manchester Gold was still being advertised in August 1997 but was withdrawn soon afterwards.

==Advertising==
The Boddingtons two bees logo was introduced in 1900. The bees are a symbol of Manchester, from a time when it was a &quot;hive of industry&quot;, but the two bees also represent a pun on the company name of Boddingtons Breweries.

Boddingtons largely eschewed above the line advertising until 1987, when it was first advertised on Granada television in the North West of England. The tagline from 1987 until 1991 was &quot;If you don&#x27;t get Boddies, you&#x27;ll just get bitter&quot;. Under Whitbread&#x27;s custodianship the comedian Frankie Howerd fronted the campaign in a series of six television advertisements which mainly aired in the North West in 1990–1991. Lowe Howard-Spink was the advertising agency responsible for the Howerd advertisements.
From July 1991 until 1999, a series of Boddingtons advertisements created by the Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH) agency used &quot;The Cream of Manchester&quot; tagline. The campaign, credited with revitalising the image of Manchester, was arguably third behind Manchester United and &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in raising the city&#x27;s profile. Originally a set of print advertisements, the campaign was extended to television in 1992. The television advertisements featured beautiful women with unlikely Mancunian accents and &quot;achieved the seemingly impossible task of making bitter glamorous&quot;. The most famous television advertisement featured a glamorous couple on-board gondolas on Manchester&#x27;s River Irwell, in a parody of a well-known &quot;just one Cornetto&quot; ice cream advertisement. According to the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, &quot;it told the world something about the reinvention of the murky old city, that its once-filthy waterway could almost pass for Venice.&quot;

The series won several international advertising awards for BBH. The brand&#x27;s creaminess was emphasised through items such as face cream, ice cream, sun cream and whipped cream. Managing director of Whitbread, Miles Templeman, explained that: We were thinking how to turn a second-rate north-west brand into something more stylish, to make it more appealing again. BBH thought of focusing on the creamy aspect, of selling a beer like a face cream. A previously unknown Melanie Sykes launched her career as a television presenter following her appearances in the adverts from 1996 until 1999. The 1997 ice cream van advert was part of an £8m campaign launched on Saturday 20 September 1997, filmed in a California desert, featuring 35 year old Ken George from Huddersfield, a physics teacher, who taught for eight years at Fartown High School, and a county 800m champion; he came from Longwood, and was a former British Polytechnic Sports Association champion, and competed with Martin Steele, from Fartown.

Animated television advertisements starring the transgender playboy cow Graham Heffer ran from 1999 until 2002. The adverts attracted complaints from the public for allegedly promoting bestiality, homosexuality and drug-taking. Boddingtons become an official partner of the 2002 XVII Commonwealth Games held in Manchester in a deal worth at least £1 million. To mark the occasion, a special Boddingtons 5% ABV Commonwealth Ale cask ale was produced for the North West of England, and subsequently launched nationwide. The last Boddingtons television advertising campaign in 2005 was criticised for capitalising on the beer&#x27;s Manchester heritage with a Happy Mondays soundtrack, even though production had moved out of the city. Mike Thompson, a former worker at the brewery and representative of the Transport &amp; General Workers&#x27; Union, said: This is at best cynical and at worst a slur on our great city, its heritage and the Strangeways workers. People have lost their livelihoods because of how this company has behaved. They will not be best pleased at what we can only see as pouring salt on the wounds.

<text>Cinepak is a lossy video codec developed by Peter Barrett at SuperMac Technologies, and released in 1991 with the Video Spigot, and then in 1992 as part of Apple Computer&#x27;s QuickTime video suite. One of the first video compression tools to achieve full motion video on CD-ROM, it was designed to encode 320×240 resolution video at 1× (150 kbyte/s) CD-ROM transfer rates. The original name of this codec was Compact Video, which is why its FourCC identifier is CVID. The codec was ported to Microsoft Windows in 1993. It was also used on fourth- and fifth-generation game consoles, such as the Atari Jaguar CD, Sega CD, Sega Saturn, and 3DO. libavcodec includes a Cinepak decoder and an encoder, both licensed under the terms of the LGPL.

== History ==
It was the primary video codec of early versions of QuickTime and Microsoft Video for Windows, but was later superseded by Sorenson Video, Intel Indeo, and most recently MPEG-4 Part 2 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. However, movies compressed with Cinepak are generally still playable in most media players.

== Technology ==
Cinepak is based on vector quantization, which is a significantly different algorithm from the discrete cosine transform (DCT) algorithm used by most current codecs (in particular the MPEG family, as well as JPEG). This permitted implementation on relatively slow CPUs (video encoded in Cinepak will usually play fine even on a 25 MHz Motorola 68030, consoles like the Sega CD usually used even slower CPUs, e.g. a 12.5 MHz 68000), but tended to result in blocky artifacting at low bitrates, which explained the criticism leveled at the FMV-based video games.

The vectors that are quantized in Cinepak are 2×2 pixel blocks. A block can consist of 4 luminance values (grayscale) or of 4 luminance and 2 chrominance values (4:2:0 chroma subsampling). The quantized blocks are stored in two codebooks, named V1 and V4, each with up to 256 entries. The vectors in the V1 codebook represent downscaled 4×4 pixel blocks, while those in the V4 codebook represent 2×2 pixel blocks.

For processing, Cinepak divides a video into key (intra-coded) images and inter-coded images. In key images the codebooks are transmitted from scratch, while in inter-coded images codebook entries are selectively updated. Each image is further divided into a number of horizontal bands. The codebooks can be updated on a per-band basis. Each band is divided into 4×4 pixel blocks. Each block can be coded either from the V1 or from the V4 codebook. When coding from the V1 codebook, one codebook index per 4×4 block is written to the bitstream, and the corresponding 2×2 codebook entry is upscaled to 4×4 pixels. When coding from the V4 codebook, four codebook indices per 4×4 block are written to the bitstream, one for each 2×2 subblock. Alternatively to coding from the V1 or the V4 codebook, a 4×4 block in an inter-coded image can be skipped. A skipped block is copied unchanged from the previous frame in a conditional replenishment fashion. The data rate can be controlled by adjusting the rate of key frames and by adjusting the permitted error in each block.

<text>The Parker 51 is a fountain pen first introduced in 1941. Parker marketed it as &quot;The World’s Most Wanted Pen&quot;, a slogan alluding to restrictions on production of consumer goods for civilian markets in the United States during World War II.
Parker&#x27;s continual advertising during the war created demand that took several years to fulfil after the end of the conflict.

The pen and the ink were both named &quot;51&quot; to mark 1939, the company&#x27;s 51st anniversary, during which development for the pen was completed (U.S. design patent No. 116,097, filed). By giving the pen a number instead of a name, Parker avoided the problem of translating a name into other languages.

== Design and history ==

The &quot;51&quot; was innovative for the period. It had a number of new design features—in particular the hooded, tubular nib and multi-finned collector were designed to work in conjunction with the pen&#x27;s proprietary, fast-drying &quot;51&quot; ink. This allowed the tubular nib to stay wet and lay down an even line with either &quot;51&quot; ink or conventional inks. The initial model used a Vacumatic filling system which operated by pressing a plunger to generate a vacuum, drawing ink into the pen.

The filling system was re-designed in 1948, with the introduction of the Aerometric filling system. This filling system operated by pressing a pressure bar on &quot;Pli-Glass&quot; PVC sac.

In addition, Parker reformulated its &quot;51&quot; ink, reducing the alkalinity, and introducing a selection of bright colors, and changing its name to Superchrome. Like the &quot;51&quot; ink, it also came with a warning that it should be used only in the Parker 51, though this warning was more discreet.

The pen was not named after the P-51 Mustang fighter plane; but Parker took advantage of the coincidence by comparing the pen and the aircraft in its advertising.

The Parker &quot;51&quot; stayed in production until 1972 with a series of revisions throughout its production cycle.

==Ink==
There were two iterations of a special ink formulated exclusively for use in the Parker 51.

This initial ink was highly alkaline and while water-based, also included a substantial amount of isopropyl alcohol.

It was released in 1941 as &quot;51&quot; ink, along with the Parker 51 pen. Parker was careful to print prominent warnings on caps, labels, and boxes that the ink could only be used in the &quot;51.&quot; The formulation in the ink would react with other manufacturing materials (such as celluloid) of the period leading to irreparable damage to other fountain pens. In 1948, the &#x27;51&#x27; ink was withdrawn and replaced with &quot;Superchrome&quot; ink, also advertised for the &#x27;51&#x27; pen and its economy model, the Parker &quot;21&quot; as the ink would still harm other fountain pens. &quot;Superchrome&quot; was discontinued by the early 1960s. Although Parker no longer manufactures these specially formulated inks, the pen&#x27;s construction is suitable for most modern inks such as Parker&#x27;s Quink.

==Legacy==
A pilot who was suspected of falsifying flight records in their logbook in order to overstate their actual experience was said to have logged &quot;P-51 hours&quot;.

The &quot;51&quot; is popular with pen collectors, and in 2002 Parker issued a lookalike model called the &quot;51 Special Edition&quot;. In 2004, the Parker 100 was released. It was a larger and heavier version of the original Parker 51. The pen was designed by Geoff Hollington, a furniture designer who had previously collaborated with Parker in the Sonnet and Insignia models. The model was produced from 2004 to 2007 and was advertised as &quot;the perfect combination of understated status and sharp, individual style&quot;. Parker 100 was offered in bronze, blue, white, silver, and black.

In 2021 a reimagined version of Parker &quot;51&quot; was released. The 2021 model had slight differences with its predecessor, being 4 mm longer than the original 51.

Queen Elizabeth used a burgundy Parker 51 since the 1950s. Parker as a company has received a Royal warrant of appointment as the official providers of writing instruments for the Royal Family.

The Chinese fountain pen manufacturer Jinhao introduced a Parker 51 clone known as the &quot;51A&quot; in the early 2000s, and like other Chinese pen manufacturers, there remains some question whether these are being produced in the actual former Parker factory facility in Shanghai, or whether the plans were simply adopted by Jinhao as by Hero &amp; other Chinese pen companies. Parker has thus far not seen fit to institute any legal proceedings against Jinhao or other similar manufacturers.

<doc id="752857" wikidata="Q1624054" url="?curid=752857" title="Pes cavus">
<text>Pes cavus, also known as high arch, is an orthopedic condition that presents as a hollow arch underneath the foot with a pronounced high ridge at the top when weight bearing. 

This foot type is typically characterized with cavus—the elevation of the longitudinal plantar arch (e.g., the bottom arch of a foot), plantar flexion of the foot, forefoot pronation, hindfoot varus, or forefoot adduction. A high arch is the opposite of a flat foot and is somewhat less common.

==Signs and symptoms==
===Pain and disability===
As with certain cases of flat feet, high arches may be painful due to metatarsal compression; however, high arches—particularly if they are flexible or properly cared-for—may be an asymptomatic condition.

People with pes cavus sometimes—though not always—have difficulty finding shoes that fit and may require support in their shoes. Children with high arches who have difficulty walking may wear specially-designed insoles, which are available in various sizes and can be made to order.

Individuals with pes cavus frequently report foot pain, which can lead to a significant limitation in function. The range of complaints reported in the literature include metatarsalgia, pain under the first metatarsal, plantar fasciitis, painful callosities, ankle arthritis, and Achilles tendonitis.

There are many other symptoms believed to be related to the cavus foot. These include shoe-fitting problems, lateral ankle instability, lower limb stress fractures, knee pain, iliotibial band syndrome, back pain and tripping.

Foot pain in people with pes cavus may result from abnormal plantar pressure loading because, structurally, the cavoid foot is regarded as being rigid and non-shock absorbent and having reduced ground contact area. There have previously been reports of an association between excessive plantar pressure and foot pathology in people with pes cavus.

==Cause==
Pes cavus can occur from four primary causes: neurological conditions, trauma, undertreated clubfoot, or idiopathic with other underlining conditions. 

Bilateral presentation (i.e., in both feet) often occurs due to a hereditary or congenital source, whereas a unilateral presentation (i.e., in one foot) is often the result of trauma. 

Pes cavus is primarily caused by an underlying neurological process or is idiopathic (unknown) in its cause. Among adults with symptomatic pes cavus, two-thirds have a neurological condition most commonly within the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies (HMSNs). These can include the Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy Type 1 (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) and Friedreich&#x27;s Ataxia.

The cause and deforming mechanism underlying pes cavus is complex and not well understood. Factors considered influential in the development of pes cavus include muscle weakness and imbalance in neuromuscular disease, residual effects of congenital clubfoot, post-traumatic bone malformation, contracture of the plantar fascia, and shortening of the Achilles tendon.

Among the cases of neuromuscular pes cavus, 50% have been attributed to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, CMT, which is the most common type of inherited neuropathy with an incidence of 1 per 2,500 persons affected. Also known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN), it is genetically heterogeneous and occasionally idiopathic. There are many different types and subtypes of CMT, and as a result, it can present from infancy through to adulthood. CMT is a peripheral neuropathy, affecting the distal muscles first as weakness, clumsiness, and frequent falls. It usually affects the feet first, but can sometimes begin in the hands. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease can cause painful foot deformities such as pes cavus. Although it is a relatively common disease, many doctors and laypersons are not familiar with it. There are no cures or effective courses of treatment to halt the progression of any form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease at this time.

The development of the cavus foot structure seen in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease has been previously linked to an imbalance of muscle strength around the foot and ankle. A hypothetical model proposed by various authors describes a relationship whereby weak evertor muscles are overpowered by stronger invertor muscles, causing an adducted forefoot and inverted rearfoot. Similarly, weak dorsiflexors are overpowered by stronger plantarflexors, causing a plantarflexed first metatarsal and anterior pes cavus.

Pes cavus is also evident in people without neuropathy or other neurological deficit. In the absence of neurological, congenital, or traumatic causes of pes cavus, the remaining cases are classified as idiopathic because their aetiology is unknown.

==Diagnosis==
On weightbearing projectional radiography, pes cavus can be diagnosed and graded by several features, the most important being medial peritalar subluxation, increased calcaneal pitch (variable) and abnormal &quot;talar-1st metatarsal angle&quot; (Meary&#x27;s angle). Medial peritalar subluxation can be demonstrated by a medially rotated talonavicular coverage angle.

===Types===
The term pes cavus encompasses a broad spectrum of foot deformities. Three main types of pes cavus are regularly described in the literature: pes cavovarus, pes calcaneocavus, and &#x27;pure&#x27; pes cavus. The three types of pes cavus can be distinguished by their aetiology, clinical signs and radiological appearance.

==== Pes cavovarus ====
Pes cavovarus, the most common type of pes cavus, is seen primarily in neuromuscular disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and, in cases of unknown aetiology, is conventionally termed &#x27;idiopathic&#x27;. Pes cavovarus presents with the calcaneus in varus, the first metatarsal plantarflexed, and a claw-toe deformity. Radiological analysis of pes cavus in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease shows the forefoot is typically plantarflexed in relation to the rearfoot.

==== Pes calcaneocavus ====
In the pes calcaneocavus foot, which is seen primarily following paralysis of the triceps surae due to poliomyelitis, the calcaneus is dorsiflexed and the forefoot is plantarflexed. Radiological analysis of pes calcaneocavus reveals a large talo-calcaneal angle.

==== Subtle pes cavus ====
In &#x27;pure&#x27; pes cavus, the calcaneus is neither dorsiflexed nor in varus and is highly arched due to a plantarflexed position of the forefoot on the rearfoot.

A combination of any or all of these elements can also be seen in a &#x27;combined&#x27; type of pes cavus that may be further categorized as flexible or rigid.

Despite various presentations and descriptions of pes cavus, not all incarnations are characterised by an abnormally high medial longitudinal arch, gait disturbances, and resultant foot pathology.

==Management==

=== Non-operative ===
Suggested conservative management of patients with painful pes cavus typically involves strategies to reduce and redistribute plantar pressure loading with the use of foot orthoses and specialised cushioned footwear. Other non-surgical rehabilitation approaches include stretching and strengthening of tight and weak muscles, debridement of plantar callosities, osseous mobilization, massage, chiropractic manipulation of the foot and ankle, and strategies to improve balance. 

=== Operative ===
Surgical treatment is only initiated if there is severe pain, as the available operations can be difficult.

There are also numerous surgical approaches described in the literature that are aimed at correcting the deformity and rebalancing the foot. Surgical procedures fall into three main groups:
# soft-tissue procedures (e.g. plantar fascia release, Achilles tendon lengthening, tendon transfer);
# osteotomy (e.g. metatarsal, midfoot or calcaneal);
# bone-stabilising procedures (e.g. triple arthrodesis).

==Epidemiology==
There are few good estimates of prevalence for pes cavus in the general community. While pes cavus has been reported in between 2 and 29% of the adult population, there are several limitations of the prevalence data reported in these studies. Population-based studies suggest the prevalence of the cavus foot is approximately 10%.

==History==
The term &quot;pes cavus&quot; is Latin for and is synonymous with the terms &quot;talipes cavus&quot;, &quot;cavoid foot&quot;, &quot;high-arched foot&quot;, and &quot;supinated foot type&quot;. 

Pes cavus is a multiplanar foot deformity characterised by an abnormally high medial longitudinal arch. Pes cavus commonly features a varus (inverted) hindfoot, a plantarflexed position of the first metatarsal, an adducted forefoot, and dorsal contracture of the toes. Despite numerous anecdotal reports and hypothetical descriptions, very little rigorous scientific data exist on the assessment or treatment of pes cavus.

<text>The Pemberton&#x27;s sign is a physical examination tool used to demonstrate the presence of latent pressure in the thoracic inlet. The sign is named after Hugh Pemberton, who characterized it in 1946.

The Pemberton maneuver is achieved by having the patient elevate both arms (usually 180 degrees anterior flexion at the shoulder) until the forearms touch the sides of the face. A positive Pemberton&#x27;s sign is marked by the presence of facial congestion and cyanosis, as well as respiratory distress after approximately one minute.

==Causes==
A positive Pemberton&#x27;s sign is indicative of superior vena cava syndrome (SVC), commonly the result of a mass in the mediastinum. Although the sign is most commonly described in patients with substernal goiters where the goiter &quot;corks off&quot; the thoracic inlet, the maneuver is potentially useful in any patient with adenopathy, tumor, or fibrosis involving the mediastinum. SVC syndrome has been observed as a result of diffuse mediastinal lymphadenopathy of various pathologies such as cystic fibrosis and Castleman’s disease. Park &quot;et al.&quot; reported enlarged cervical lymph nodes associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis as the cause of internal jugular vein compression, which presented clinically similar to SVC syndrome.

<doc id="752861" wikidata="Q894369" url="?curid=752861" title="Bosch reaction">
<text>The Bosch reaction is a catalytic chemical reaction between carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2) that produces elemental carbon (C,graphite), water, and a 10% return of invested heat. CO2 is usually reduced by H2 to carbon in presence of a catalyst (e.g. iron (Fe)) and requires a temperature level of . 

The overall reaction is as follows:

:CO2(g) + 2 H2(g) → C(s) + 2 H2O(l)

The above reaction is actually the result of two reactions. The first reaction, the reverse water gas shift reaction, is a fast one:

:CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O 

The second reaction is the rate determining step:

:CO + H2 → C + H2O

The overall reaction produces 2.3×103 joules for every gram of carbon dioxide reacted at 650 °C. Reaction temperatures are in the range of 450 to 600 °C.

The reaction can be accelerated in the presence of an iron, cobalt or nickel catalyst. Ruthenium also serves to speed up the reaction.

==Applications==
Together with the Sabatier reaction, the Bosch reaction is studied as a way to remove carbon dioxide and to generate clean water aboard a space station.

The reaction is also used to produce graphite for radiocarbon dating with Accelerator Mass Spectrometry.

The Bosch reaction is being investigated for use in maintaining space station life support. Though the Bosch reaction would present a completely closed hydrogen and oxygen cycle which only produces atomic carbon as waste, difficulties in maintaining its higher required temperature and properly handling carbon deposits mean that significantly more research will be required before a Bosch reactor can become a reality. One problem is that the production of elemental carbon tends to foul the catalyst&#x27;s surface, which is detrimental to the reaction&#x27;s efficiency.

<text>The United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (in case citations, C.A.A.F. or USCAAF) is an Article I court that exercises worldwide appellate jurisdiction over members of the United States Armed Forces on active duty and other persons subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The court is composed of five civilian judges appointed for 15-year terms by the president of the United States with the advice and consent of the United States Senate. The court reviews decisions from the intermediate appellate courts of the services: the Army Court of Criminal Appeals, the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals, the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals, and the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals.

== History ==
Courts-martial are judicial proceedings conducted by the armed forces. The Continental Congress first authorized the use of courts-martial in 1775. From the time of the American Revolutionary War through the middle of the twentieth century, courts-martial were governed by the Articles of War and the Articles for the Government of the Navy. Congress&#x27;s authority &quot;To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces&quot; is contained in the United States Constitution at Article I, Section 8.

Until 1920, court-martial convictions were reviewed either by a commander in the field or by the president, depending on the severity of the sentence or the rank of the accused. The absence of formal review received critical attention during World War I, and the Army created an internal legal review process for a limited number of cases. Following the war, in the Act of June 4, 1920, Congress required the Army to establish boards of review, consisting of three lawyers, to consider cases involving death, dismissal of an officer, an unsuspended dishonorable discharge, or confinement in a penitentiary, with limited exceptions. The legislation further required legal review of other cases in the Office of the Judge Advocate General.

The military justice system under the Articles of War and Articles for the Government of the Navy received significant attention during World War II and its immediate aftermath. During the war, in which over 16 million persons served in the American armed forces, the military services held over 1.7 million courts-martial. Many of these proceedings were conducted without lawyers acting as presiding officers or counsel. Studies conducted by the military departments and the civilian bar identified a variety of problems in the administration of military justice during the war, including the potential for improper command influence.
In 1948, Congress enacted significant reforms to the Articles of War, including creation of a Judicial Council of three general officers to consider cases involving sentences of death, life imprisonment, or dismissal of an officer, as well as cases referred to the Council by a board of review or the judge advocate general. During the same period, Congress placed the departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force under the newly created Department of Defense. The first Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal, created a committee under the chairmanship of Professor Edmund Morgan to study the potential for unifying and revising the services&#x27; disparate military justice systems under a single code.

The committee recommended a unified system applicable to the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. The committee also recommended that qualified attorneys serve as presiding officers and counsel, subject to limited exceptions. Numerous other changes were proposed by the committee to enhance the rights of servicemen in the context of the disciplinary needs of the armed forces. The recommendations included creation of an independent civilian appellate court.

The committee&#x27;s recommendations, as revised by Congress, became the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), enacted on May 5, 1950. Its name was changed from council to Court in the house, out of fear that council sounded too much like city council. Article 67 of the UCMJ established the Court of Military Appeals as a three-judge civilian court. The report of the House Armed Services Committee accompanying the legislation emphasized that the new court would be &quot;completely removed from all military influence of persuasion.&quot; The legislation became effective on May 31, 1951. In 1968, Congress redesignated the court as the United States Court of Military Appeals.

In 1989, Congress enacted comprehensive legislation to enhance the effectiveness and stability of the court. The legislation increased the court&#x27;s membership to five judges, consistent with the American Bar Association&#x27;s Standards for Court Organization. In 1994, Congress gave the court its current designation, the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

== Jurisdiction and appellate review of courts-martial ==

Courts-martial are conducted under the UCMJ (, U.C.M.J. art. 1–146) and the Manual for Courts-Martial. If the trial results in a conviction, the case is then reviewed by the convening authority – the person who referred the case for trial by court-martial. The convening authority may approve the conviction of the court-martial, but also has the discretion to mitigate the findings and sentence.

Beyond the review by the convening authority, court-martial cases may be appealed to two additional levels of judicial review. These are the Courts of Criminal Appeals and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

=== Intermediate review – Courts of Criminal Appeals ===
If the sentence, as approved by the convening authority, includes death, a bad-conduct discharge, a dishonorable discharge, dismissal of an officer, or confinement for one year or more, the case is reviewed by an intermediate court. There are four such courts—the Army Court of Criminal Appeals, the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals, the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals, and the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals. The Courts of Criminal Appeals review the cases for legal error, factual sufficiency, and sentence appropriateness. All other cases are subject to review by judge advocates under regulations issued by each service. After such review, the Judge Advocate General may refer a case to the appropriate Court of Criminal Appeals. The Courts of Criminal Appeals also have jurisdiction under Article 62 of the UCMJ to consider appeals by the United States of certain judicial rulings during trial. Review under Article 62 is limited to issues involving alleged legal errors.

===Final review – Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces===
The Court&#x27;s primary jurisdictional statute is Article 67(a) of the UCMJ, which provides:

:The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces shall review the record in: 1) all cases in which the sentence, as affirmed by a Court of Criminal Appeals, extends to death; 2) all cases reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals which the Judge Advocate General orders sent to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for review; and 3) all cases reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals in which, upon petition of the accused and on good cause shown, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has granted a review.

Under Article 67(c), the Court&#x27;s review is limited to issues of law. The Courts of Criminal Appeals and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces also have jurisdiction to consider petitions for extraordinary relief under the All Writs Act ().

Cases on the court&#x27;s docket address a broad range of legal issues, including constitutional law, criminal law, evidence, criminal procedure, ethics, administrative law, and national security law. The cases before the court may only be reviewed upon a granted petition for review (which occurs in 10 percent of cases), by certificate from an individual service Judge Advocate General, a sentence of death, a petition for extraordinary relief or a writ appeal petition. Statistics show that the court reviews approximately 10 percent of all court-martial convictions. In the year ending September 1, 2009, the court had 1,002 cumulative filings and disposed of 1,033 cases. Of these 1,033 cases, 46 were disposed of by signed or &quot;per curiam opinions&quot; and 987 were by memorandum or order. (By comparison, the US Supreme Court issued 92 signed opinions in 2009.)

=== Supreme Court review ===

The Supreme Court of the United States has discretion under to review cases under the UCMJ on writ of certiorari where the CAAF has conducted a mandatory review (death penalty and certified cases), granted discretionary review of a petition, or otherwise granted relief. If the CAAF denies a petition for review or a writ appeal, consideration by the Supreme Court may be obtained only through collateral review (e.g., a writ of habeas corpus). Since 2007, several bills have been introduced into Congress to expand the accessibility of the Supreme Court to service members.

== Case citation ==

Bluebook citation form for the CAAF is provided in Table T.1 (C.A.A.F.), previously United States Court of Military Appeals (C.M.A.), of &quot;The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation&quot; (Columbia Law Review Ass&#x27;n et al. eds, 18th ed. 2005). The official reporters are Decisions of the United States Court of Military Appeals (C.M.A.) (1951–75), Court Martial Reports (C.M.R.) (1951–75) and West&#x27;s Military Justice Reporter (M.J.) (1975–present).

== Location ==
Since October 31, 1952, the Court has been located in Judiciary Square in Washington, D.C. The United States Court of Military Appeals, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was erected in 1910, and was formerly the home of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The building was designed by Elliott Woods.

== Judges ==
The court has five judges, who are nominated by the president of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate. Judges serve fifteen-year terms. After their term, they must be either re-appointed or retire from the court. When hearing a case, all five judges sit as a panel.

Article 142 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice provides that not more than three judges may be appointed to the court from the same political party, which is a common provision for Article I courts and administrative agencies, but is unlike Article III federal courts. To underscore the civilian nature of the Court, the statute provides that a person may not be appointed as a judge of the Court within seven years after retirement from active duty as a commissioned officer of a regular component of an armed force.

The judges regularly meet in conference to discuss recently argued cases. As a matter of custom, there is full discussion of each case followed by a tentative vote. If the chief judge is in the majority, the chief judge assigns the responsibility for drafting an opinion to a judge in the majority. If the chief judge is not in the majority, the most senior judge in the majority assigns the case. After an opinion is drafted, it is circulated to all judges, who have the opportunity to concur, comment, or submit a separate opinion. After the judges have had an opportunity to express their views in writing, the opinion is released to the parties and the public.

=== Current composition of the court ===






=== List of former judges ===






=== Chief judges ===





The position of chief judge is rotated among the judges to the most senior judge who has not previously served as chief judge. The chief judge serves in that position for five years unless his or her term as a judge expires sooner. Prior to 1992, the chief judge was designated by the president from among the sitting judges.

=== Senior Judges ===
Judges retiring from the court at the end of their term are eligible to serve as senior judges, who may be called upon to serve on the court in instances of a vacancy, recusal, or other inability of a current judge to serve.

=== Succession of seats ===
















== Counsel in cases before the court ==
Each service Judge Advocate General has established separate appellate divisions to represent the government and the defense before the service Courts of Criminal Appeals, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and the Supreme Court of the United States regardless of indigency. A servicemember whose case is eligible for review is entitled to free representation by government-furnished counsel, and also may be represented by civilian counsel provided at the servicemember&#x27;s own expense.

When the court grants review, and in cases involving mandatory review, the parties are notified of the briefing requirements under the court&#x27;s rules. In most cases, oral argument is scheduled following submission of briefs, but the court decides a number of cases without oral argument. The court notifies the parties and counsel of the oral argument date, and the oral argument schedule is posted on the court&#x27;s website. In a typical case, each counsel is given 30 minutes to present argument, on behalf of their client, to the court. Unlike most civilian criminal jurisdictions in the United States, the military does not require that a defendant prove an inability to pay in order to receive defense counsel at government expense.

Counsel appearing before the court must be admitted to the Bar of the Court or obtain permission of the court to appear in a specific case. An application for membership in the court&#x27;s bar may be obtained from the Court&#x27;s website, www.armfor.uscourts.gov, or by writing to the Clerk of the Court. Over 33,000 attorneys have been admitted to practice since the Court was established in 1951.

== Project Outreach and Judge Everett&#x27;s public role ==
Most of the court&#x27;s oral arguments are held at its courthouse in Washington, D.C. On occasion, as part of the court&#x27;s judicial outreach program, the Court will hold arguments at law schools, military bases, and other public facilities. This practice, known as Project Outreach, was developed principally by Chief Judge Robinson O. Everett as part of a public awareness program to demonstrate the operation of a federal court of appeals and the military criminal justice system. Everett presided over an expansion of the Court&#x27;s public-facing role during his association with the Court, including taking live telephone phone calls from C-SPAN viewers on a July 14, 1989, television program.

<doc id="752869" wikidata="Q755141" url="?curid=752869" title="Levator scapulae muscle">
<text>The levator scapulae is a slender skeletal muscle situated at the back and side of the neck. It originates from the transverse processes of the four uppermost cervical vertebrae; it inserts onto the upper portion of the medial border of the scapula. It is innervated by the cervical nerves C3-C4, and frequently also by the dorsal scapular nerve. As the Latin name suggests, its main function is to lift the scapula.

==Anatomy==

=== Attachments ===
The muscle descends diagonally from its origin to its insertion.

==== Origin ====
The levator scapulae originates from the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of cervical vertebrae C1-4. At its origin, it attaches via tendinous slips.

==== Insertion ====
It inserts onto the medial border of the scapula (with its site of insertion extending between the superior angle of the scapula superiorly, and the junction of spine of scapula and medial border of scapula inferiorly).

===Relations===
One of the muscles within the floor of the posterior triangle of the neck, the superior part of levator scapulae is covered by sternocleidomastoid and its inferior part by the trapezius. 

It is bounded in front by the scalenus medius and behind by splenius cervicis. 

The spinal accessory nerve crosses laterally in the middle part of the muscle and the dorsal scapular nerve may lie deep to or pass through it.

The levator scapulae may lie deep to the sternocleidomastoid at its origin, deep or adjacent to the splenius capitis at its origin and mid-portion, and deep to the trapezius in its lower portion.

===Variation===
The number of attachments varies; a slip may extend to the occipital or mastoid, to the trapezius, scalene or serratus anterior, or to the first or second rib. The muscle may be subdivided into several distinct parts from origin to insertion. Levator claviculæ from the transverse processes of one or two upper cervical vertebræ to the outer end of the clavicle corresponds to a muscle of lower animals. More or less union with the serratus anterior muscle.

===Innervation===
The levator scapulae is innervated by 2–3 branches of the 3rd and 4th cervical nerves, and frequently by a branch from the dorsal scapular nerve.

===Blood supply===
The levator scapulae is supplied by the dorsal scapular artery. Normally, this artery has a small branch which passes laterally to the supraspinatus fossa of the scapula, and in a third of cases, this branch supplies the muscle. If the dorsal scapular artery comes off the transverse cervical artery, the parent transverse cervical artery splits the dorsal scapular artery passes medially, while the transverse cervical artery passes laterally.

==Function==
When the spine is fixed, levator scapulae elevates the scapula and rotates its inferior angle medially. It often works in combination with other muscles like the rhomboids and pectoralis minor to produce downward rotation of the scapula.

Elevating or rotating one shoulder at a time would require muscles to stabilize the cervical spine and keep it immobile so it does not flex or rotate. Elevating both at once with equal amounts of pull on both side of cervical spinal origins would counteract these forces. Downward rotation would be prevented by co-contraction of other muscles that elevate the spine, the upper fibers of the trapezius, which is an upward rotator.

When the shoulder is fixed, levator scapulae rotates to the same side and flexes the cervical spine laterally. When both shoulders are fixed, a simultaneous co-contraction of both levator scapulae muscles in equal amounts would not produce lateral flexion or rotation, and may produce straight flexion or extension of the cervical spine.

==Non-human animals==
The muscles of the shoulder can be categorized into three topographic units: the scapulohumeral, axiohumeral, and axioscapular groups. Levator scapulae forms part of the latter group together with rhomboid major, rhomboid minor, serratus anterior, and trapezius. The trapezius evolved separately, but the other three muscles in this group evolved from the first eight or ten ribs and the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae (homologous to the ribs). The serratus anterior formed the basal unit for these three muscles. In higher primates it has evolved into two separate muscles—serratus anterior and levator scapulae—by concentration of the proximal and distal fibers and progressive reduction of the intermediate fibers. The fibers concerned with the cranial displacement of the scapula became the levator scapulae.

<text>HomeSite was an HTML editor originally developed by Nick Bradbury. Unlike WYSIWYG HTML editors such as FrontPage and Dreamweaver, HomeSite was designed for direct editing, or &quot;hand coding&quot;, of HTML and other website languages.

After a successful partnership with the company to distribute it alongside its own competing Dreamweaver software, HomeSite was acquired by Macromedia in 2001, after which elements of the software were integrated into Dreamweaver. Following the acquisition of Macromedia by Adobe Systems, the company announced on May 26, 2009, that HomeSite would be discontinued.

==History==
It was originally developed in Borland Delphi in 1995 by Nick Bradbury. Bradbury wrote HomeSite after using HotDog and being frustrated with it. In March 1997 Allaire Corporation from Cambridge, Massachusetts (founded by brothers Jeremy and J.J. Allaire) acquired HomeSite and Nick Bradbury joined Allaire. After leaving Allaire in 1998, Bradbury went on to work on the CSS/xHTML editor TopStyle and the RSS reader FeedDemon. Macromedia acquired Allaire in 2001 and was in turn acquired by Adobe in 2005.

At Allaire, a version of HomeSite was created as an IDE for ColdFusion, selling as &quot;ColdFusion Studio&quot;. This version was later merged into Coldfusion MX under Macromedia, and was then called HomeSite+. Development of HomeSite continued in parallel, though the standalone HomeSite was still sold separately.

In the days that HomeSite was under Nick Bradbury, and then part of Allaire, it had an enthusiastic following from its user community. While many software companies at the time had WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) website creation tools where the user never saw the code, Nick Bradbury created a product that was code centric and popular with those that preferred to work directly in the code, a concept that was dubbed &quot;What You See Is What You Need.&quot; Further he built in a variety of ways that users could customize the user interface and extend the functionality. Allaire kept this concept going as its target market of ColdFusion users were code-centric as well. Allaire developers expanded upon Nick&#x27;s original HomeSite capabilities by adding features like built-in scripting, improved syntax coloring, and VTML for tag insight and tag editors.

Macromedia licensed a copy of HomeSite to include in Windows versions of Dreamweaver 1.0 (Mac versions bundled BBEdit). This OEM deal started the relationship between the companies and eventually led to the acquisition of Allaire by Macromedia in 2001. Although Macromedia improved the hand coding features in Dreamweaver 6.0 (MX) to be more on par with HomeSite, the company continued to produce both products separately, stating that &quot;both products are excellent for their specific purposes.&quot; Macromedia was then acquired by Adobe in 2005. In May 2009, Adobe elected to cease development of HomeSite, and no longer supports the product, though they still maintain a forum for active users . Instead, existing HomeSite users are asked to consider switching to the newest version of Dreamweaver.

==Versions==

* Homesite 1.x (September 1996)
*Allaire Homesite 2.0

*Macromedia HomeSite 5.0 (2001)
*Macromedia HomeSite 5.2 (January 2003)
*Macromedia HomeSite 5.5 (September 2003)

There was also another version called HomeSite+ which was included in Dreamweaver MX 2004 and greater. HomeSite+ had additional functionality for ColdFusion application development, and was generally comparable to the version of HomeSite formerly called ColdFusion Studio. HomeSite+/CF Studio versions parallel standalone HomeSite versions.

<doc id="752872" wikidata="Q4723386" url="?curid=752872" title="Alfred S. Bloomingdale">
<text>Alfred Schiffer Bloomingdale (April 15, 1916 – August 23, 1982) was an American businessman who launched the credit card business Dine and Sign, was chairman of Diners Club, and became known as &quot;father of the credit card.&quot; He was an heir to the Bloomingdale&#x27;s department store fortune and the lover of murdered mistress Vicki Morgan.

==Early life and education==
Bloomingdale was born to a wealthy Jewish family on April 15, 1916, in New York City, the son of Rosalind (née Schiffer) and Hiram Bloomingdale, and the grandson of Lyman G. Bloomingdale, a co-founder of the famous department store Bloomingdale&#x27;s. Bloomingdale attended Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, where he was a member of the football team as well as Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Upsilon chapter).

==Career==
After school, he worked as a salesman at Bloomingdale&#x27;s but after three years he left to work as a theatrical agent where he represented Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland. He tried his hand at producing Broadway shows and movies but was not very successful. In 1946, he moved to Los Angeles where he worked as an executive at Columbia Pictures. To facilitate the need of his wealthy friends who liked to patronize New York City&#x27;s upscale restaurants following a night at the theater, Bloomingdale launched a credit card business called &quot;Dine and Sign&quot; that meant people on a night out no longer needed to carry large sums of cash. In 1951, he merged his company with Diners Club and joined the rapidly growing business as an executive, becoming chairman of the board of directors in 1964. In 1969, he left Diners Club, acquiring its &quot;International Floatels&quot; division.

==Personal life==
In 1946, Bloomingdale married Betty Lee &quot;Betsy&quot; Newling, a practicing Roman Catholic, movie starlet and daughter of Dr. Russell Lee Newling (who was a Beverly Hills-based physician born in Adelaide, South Australia). Alfred and Betsy Bloomingdale had three children:
*Geoffrey Bloomingdale (born 1950), married to Elizabeth Fahr in 1972;
*Lisa Bloomingdale Bell (born 1951), married to R. McKim Bell in 1974; and
*Robert Russell Bloomingdale (born 1954), married to Justine Hayward Schmidt in 1979.

Bloomingdale and his wife Betsy were friends and confidantes of Ronald and Nancy Reagan. In 1981 Reagan, following his election to the U.S. presidency, appointed Bloomingdale to the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and the following year named him a member of the United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy. Although born to a Jewish family, Bloomingdale became a Catholic to marry Betsy, and later became a member of the Knights of Malta. The Bloomingdales maintained homes in New York, the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles, and an apartment in the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C.

===Vicki Morgan affair===
In 1970, while in Los Angeles, 54-year-old Alfred Bloomingdale began an affair with 18-year-old Vicki Morgan. For 12 years, Bloomingdale kept her in a luxurious apartment, showering her with expensive clothing, jewelry, and cars. When Alfred was diagnosed with terminal cancer, his wife Betsy cut off Morgan&#x27;s allowance. Soon after, the affair with Vicki Morgan made headline news as its unsubstantiated and sordid details, which included allegations of sado-masochistic activities instigated by Bloomingdale, were made public after Morgan filed a multimillion-dollar palimony lawsuit against Bloomingdale&#x27;s estate. Morgan eventually moved into a condominium in the San Fernando Valley where she rented a room to a schizophrenic named Marvin Pancoast, whom she knew from the withdrawal clinic. In July 1983, Pancoast beat her to death with a baseball bat.
The courts awarded Morgan $200,000 after her death from Bloomingdale&#x27;s estate.

===Death===
Alfred Bloomingdale died of throat cancer in 1982 in Santa Monica, California, aged 66. He is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

===Posthumous accusation of attempted rape===
In 2017, actress Janis Paige wrote a guest column for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; in which she stated that Alfred Bloomingdale had attempted to rape her when she was 22 years old.

<doc id="752873" wikidata="Q155225" url="?curid=752873" title="Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice">
<text>The Basilica dei Santi Giovanni e Paolo, known in Venetian as San Zanipolo, is a Catholic minor basilica and Dominican conventual church in the Castello &quot;sestiere&quot; of Venice, Italy.

It is one of the largest churches in the city of Venice. After the 15th century the funeral services of all of Venice&#x27;s doges were held here, and twenty-five doges are buried in the church.

==Description==
The huge brick edifice was designed in the Italian Gothic style, and completed in the 1430s. It is the principal Dominican church of Venice, and as such was built to hold large congregations. It is dedicated to John and Paul, not the Biblical Apostles of the same names, but two obscure martyrs of the Early Christian church in Rome, whose names were recorded in the 4th century but whose legend is of a later date.

In 1246, Doge Jacopo Tiepolo donated some swampland to the Dominicans after dreaming of a flock of white doves flying over it. The first church was demolished in 1333, when the current church was begun. It was not completed until 1430.

The vast interior contains many funerary monuments and paintings, as well as the &quot;Madonna della Pace&quot;, a miraculous Byzantine image situated in its own chapel in the south aisle, and a foot of Saint Catherine of Siena, the church&#x27;s chief relic.

Santi Giovanni e Paolo is a parish church of the Vicariate of San Marco-Castello. Other churches of the parish are San Lazzaro dei Mendicanti, the Ospedaletto and the Beata Vergine Addolorata.

The Renaissance Equestrian Statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni (1483), by Andrea del Verrocchio, is located next to the church.

The belltower has 3 bells in D major.

<doc id="752875" wikidata="Q2642099" url="?curid=752875" title="Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology">
<text>Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, often abbreviated Aviation Week or AW&amp;ST, is the flagship magazine of the Aviation Week Network, a division of Informa. The weekly magazine is available in print and online, reporting on the aerospace, defense and aviation industries, with a core focus on aerospace technology. It has a reputation for its contacts inside the United States military and industry organizations.

&quot;Aviation Week&quot; was a favorite conduit for defense-related companies and labs to leak information to the public as part of their policy by press release efforts. This led to it being informally referred to &quot;Aviation Leak and Space Mythology&quot;.

==History==
The magazine was first published in August 1916. Early editors Ladislas d&#x27;Orsy and Donald W. McIlhiney (1921 to 25) were Quiet Birdmen. Publisher (1927 to 29) Earl D. Osborn was also a Quiet Birdman. With the coming of the Space Age, the current title was adopted in 1960.

Other titles the magazine has held include Aviation &amp; Aircraft Journal (1920–1921), Aviation (1922–1947), Aviation Week (1947–1958), Aviation Week Including Space Technology (1958–1959), before settling on its current title.

Starting in August 1943, McGraw-Hill published a weekly magazine called &quot;Aviation News&quot; to accompany the standard monthly issue. In 1947, its staff was reincorporated into the then-renamed &quot;Aviation Week&quot;.

==Editions==
Once a month the magazine publishes an edition targeted at the maintenance, repair and overhaul business.

==Ownership and related products==
&quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot; is published by Aviation Week Network, a division of Informa. The magazine is headquartered in New York City, and its main editorial office is in Washington, D.C.

Its longest run of ownership came when it was owned by McGraw-Hill. It was sold by McGraw Hill to Penton in 2013. It became part of Informa when Informa purchased Penton in 2016.

Aviation Week Network also publishes &quot;Business &amp; Commercial Aviation&quot; and &quot;Air Transport World&quot; magazines.

==Notable stories==

===Nuclear bomber hoax===
The 1 December 1958 issue of &quot;Aviation Week&quot; included an article, &quot;Soviets Flight Testing Nuclear Bomber&quot;, that claimed that the Soviets had made great progress in their own nuclear aircraft program. This was accompanied by an editorial on the topic as well. The magazine claimed that the aircraft was real beyond a doubt, stating that &quot;A nuclear-powered bomber is being flight tested in the Soviet Union. ... It has been observed both in flight and on the ground by a wide variety of foreign observers from Communist and non-Communist countries.&quot; In reality, however, the article was a hoax. The aircraft in the photographs was later revealed to be an M-50 bomber and not a nuclear-powered plane at all.

===Soviet reusable space shuttle===
After finding a December 1976 Titan IIID launch was for a secret KH-11 spy satellite, &quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot; editor Craig Covault agreed with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. David C. Jones to hold on the story, but received details on the Buran programme which were published on March 20, 1978. It revealed progressively the KeyHole Story after William Kampiles sold the KH-11 manual to a Soviet spy.

===SR-72 (Son of Blackbird) revealing===
The SR-72 is the proposed successor to the SR-71 Blackbird. There were unconfirmed rumors about the SR-72 dating back to 2007, when various sources disclosed that Lockheed Martin was developing a Mach 6 plane for the US Air Force. Such a development was confirmed on 1 November 2013, when the Skunk Works revelations were published about the development work on the SR-72 exclusively in &quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot;. The magazine dubbed it &#x27;The Son of Blackbird&#x27;. Public attention to the news was large enough to overwhelm the Aviation Week servers.

===New, classified unmanned aircraft flying at Area 51 uncovering===
In a December 9, 2013 cover story, &quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot; revealed details about a highly classified intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance stealth unmanned aircraft – the RQ-180 – that has been developed in secret by Northrop Grumman. The aircraft is currently flying at Area 51 in the Nevada desert and will become operational by 2015.

=== Lockheed Martin&#x27;s secret Compact Fusion Reactor project details===
In October 2014, Lockheed Martin&#x27;s Skunk Works research lab gave &quot;Aviation Week&quot; editor Guy Norris access to a previously secret initiative to develop a compact fusion reactor that is small enough to power interplanetary spacecraft, ships and ultimately large aircraft that would virtually never require refueling. If successful, the groundbreaking project could shake up the global energy industry.

===Vladimir Putin named Person of the Year===
On its January 16, 2015 cover, &quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot; named Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;The Notorious Mr. Putin - Person Of The Year.&quot; On its website, the magazine said that &quot;no other person has had a more sweeping impact on aerospace and aviation—for better or worse—than Russian President Vladimir Putin. And for all but the most cynical of observers, Putin&#x27;s far-reaching impact has definitely been for the worse. Because of this, he is Aviation Week&#x27;s 2014 Person of the Year.&quot; The controversial issue caused a backlash among readers on its comments section and on social media.

<doc id="752877" wikidata="Q7293812" url="?curid=752877" title="Rap opera">
<text>A rap opera or hip hopera is a musical work in hip hop style with operatic form. The terms have been used to describe both dramatic works and concept albums, and &quot;hip hopera&quot; has also been used for works drawing more heavily on contemporary R&amp;B than other hip hop such as rap.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;hip hopera&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;hip hop&quot; and &quot;opera&quot;. An early use of the phrase was a 1994 album of that name by Volume 10 (although not a concept album). The first dramatic production to use the term was a 2001 telefilm by MTV, titled &quot;&quot;.
The word received increased use after 2005, in describing R&amp;B singer R. Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Trapped in the Closet&quot; series.

== History ==
Rap opera, also known as hip-hopera, is a hybrid genre between rap and opera. Opera is a musical genre that began in the late 16th century. Hip hop is a much newer musical genre that became popular during the 1970s. Historically, both rap and opera have been used as a form of expression and storytelling. Now in popular culture, the fusion of the two genres is being used for the same purpose. Historically popular and classic pieces such as &quot;Carmen&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; have been transformed into hip hop pieces.

== In popular culture ==
The use of hip hopera in popular culture began in 1997 when hip hop group The Fugees and Bounty Killer collaborated on a musical single titled &quot;Hip-Hopera.&quot; In 2001, the film &quot;&quot;, a modern rendition of Georges Bizet&#x27;s 1875 opera &quot;Carmen&quot; aired on MTV. The film featured Beyoncé Knowles, as well as other rappers and modern musicians, and was renowned as &quot;the first hip hop musical.&quot; &quot;Rome &amp; Jewel&quot;, a 2006 Rennie Harris film is another hip hop rendition of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. In 2023, American rapper Latto and American singer Christina Aguilera released a rap opera-inspired song for the food delivery company Just Eat.

Rap opera is also being used in communities through local organizations such as the Rap Opera Project. Carlos Aguirre, the creator of the Rap Opera Project, teaches rap opera to marginalized and at risk youth in his community. The project&#x27;s intention is to give voice to individuals who have otherwise felt oppressed. Aguirre, channeling his own personal experience and youth as a minority, is using musical expression as a form of therapy. In the United Kingdom, traditional opera is adopting modern hip hop beats to appeal to the modern youth. &quot;The Moon Prince: A Rap Opera&quot;, is another community-led rap opera for youth featured in Charlotte and Boston.

== Reception ==
There have been mixed responses to the usage of rap opera. Theater critic Steven Oxman gave his feedback on &quot;Carmen: A Hip Hopera&quot;, stating &quot;&quot;Carmen&quot; is MTV&#x27;s first &#x27;Hip Hopera&#x27;, and while that phrase may be way too cute for its own good, this reworking of Bizet&#x27;s opera into a contemporary, hip-hop musical works quite well, and represents one of the more original recent efforts to create a new form from an old one.&quot;

<doc id="752879" wikidata="Q1621200" url="?curid=752879" title="Tsarskoye Selo">
<text>Tsarskoye Selo (, , ) was the town containing a former residence of the Russian imperial family and visiting nobility, located south from the center of Saint Petersburg. The residence now forms part of the town of Pushkin. Tsarskoye Selo forms one of the World Heritage Site Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments.

The town bore the name Tsarskoye Selo until 1918. The new Bolshevik government of Soviet Russia renamed it as Detskoye Selo (), which it held from 1918–1937. At that time, it was renamed under Stalin&#x27;s government as Pushkin () after the famous Russian poet and writer. It is still known by that name.

==History==
The area of Tsarskoye Selo, once part of Swedish Ingria, first became a Russian royal/imperial residence in the early 18th century as an estate of the Empress-consort Catherine (later Empress-regnant as Catherine I, ), for whom the Catherine Palace is named.

When Peter the Great took possession of the mouth of the Neva, a Finnish village, Saari-mois, stood on the site now occupied by the town, and its Russified name Sarskaya was changed into Tsarskoye when Peter presented it to his wife Catherine. It was especially embellished by the tsaritsa Elizabeth. Under Catherine II., a town, Sophia, was built close by, but its inhabitants were transferred to Tsarskoye Selo under Alexander I. The railway connecting the town with St Petersburg was the first (1838) to be constructed in Russia.

The Alexander Palace (built from 1792 onwards) was first the home of Catherine the Great&#x27;s grandson, the Grand Duke Alexander Pavlovich, who later became Emperor Alexander I (). After his abdication, Nicholas II and his family were held there by revolutionary forces under house arrest until 13 August 1917. People built homes in the town where they also came to live when the court was in the country.

The Royal Forestry School, perhaps the first such school in Russia, was founded in Tsarskoye Selo in 1803. It was moved to Saint Petersburg in 1811 and developed as the Imperial Forestry Institute.

According to historian Robert K. Massie, 
&quot;Tsarskoe Selo was a magnificent symbol, a supreme gesture, of the Russian autocracy. At the edge of the great St. Petersburg plain, fifteen miles south of the capital, a succession of Russian tsars and empresses had created an isolated, miniature world, as artificial and fantastic as a precisely ordered mechanical toy. Inside the park, monuments, obelisks and triumphal arches studded eight hundred acres of velvet green lawn. An artificial lake, big enough for small sailboats, could be emptied and filled like a bathtub. At one end of the lake stood a pink Turkish bath; not far off, a dazzling red-and-gold Chinese pagoda crowned an artificial hillock.&quot; The two palaces stood five hundred yards apart in the Imperial Park. &quot;Outside the palace gates, Tsarskoe Selo, was an elegant provincial town...&quot; The town included &quot;The mansions of the aristocracy, lining the wide tree-shaded boulevard which led from the railway station to the gates of the Imperial Park...&quot;

===Nickname for elite Soviet neighborhoods===
In the decades of the Soviet Union, people applied the nickname &quot;the Tsar&#x27;s village&quot; to the blocks and small neighborhoods in major cities that housed the nomenklatura (Soviet elites). Their stores were better stocked, although they were still affected by Soviet-era shortages. The buildings in the neighborhoods were better designed, constructed and maintained.
For instance, one such neighborhood, west of Moscow, contained less industry and more parks than any other neighborhood.

<doc id="752886" wikidata="Q1351866" url="?curid=752886" title="Troy Stetina">
<text>Troy Stetina (born November 16, 1963) is an American guitarist and music educator with more than forty rock and metal instructional methods to his credit, and total sales currently over 1 million units. He was the director of Rock Guitar Studies at the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music and writer for &quot;Guitar One&quot; magazine, and now teaches independently.

==Background and early years==
Stetina grew up in Indiana, the youngest in a family of Olympic cyclists, including his brothers Wayne, Dale and Joel, and won several national medals as a teenager. According to the &quot;Rushville Republican&quot;, issue July 9, 1973, at the Indiana Bicycle Road Racing championships, Troy won the two miler race for boys aged 8 &amp; 11. Brother Dale was a winner in the 50 mile race for boys 15 &amp; 17. Also Brother Wayne, aged 19 at the time won the 85 mile men&#x27;s race. 

Stetina&#x27;s mother, an accomplished opera singer, supported his interest in music, and at age 12 she bought him a $60 beginner guitar and little practice amp.

Following formative stints in Private Wave and Wraith, Stetina started giving private guitar lessons part-time at a local music store and found he had a knack for teaching. When a chance meeting with Hal Leonard author/editor Will Schmid occurred at the store, an opportunity to write a heavy-metal instructional method materialized. His first effort was never published due to copyright issues. His second attempt resulted in the highly successful &quot;Heavy Metal Rhythm Guitar&quot; (Volumes 1 &amp; 2) in 1986, and &quot;Heavy Metal Lead Guitar&quot; in 1987.

The same year the first book was released, Stetina joined the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music, in Milwaukee. Although he eventually became Director of the Rock Guitar department, he left in the early 1990s to finally pursue a career as a recording artist.

According to &quot;The Journal Times&quot;, Stetina is a founding member of the Milwaukee hard rock / alternative band Oversoulss. Teaming up with prog metal drummer Eddie Shapanske, Stetina and Shapanske spent a year working with and auditioning vocalists before teaming up with David Rangel who was previously with the Minneapolis-based band, Mersey Side. They then added bassist Dan Evans. Stetina was also a member of the Milwaukee based progressive metal band Dimension X, replacing the previous guitarist.

According to the Guitar Instructor website, he is internationally recognized and his book &quot;Speed Mechanics&quot;, has sold more than 100,000 copies. Stetina was an article contributor for the &quot;Guitar One&quot; magazine in the 2000s. Via the &quot;Urban Milwaukee&quot; news site, the Wilson Center for the arts refers to him as an &quot;internationally renowned guitarist and clinician&quot;.

Stetina is also a Christian. In an interview with &quot;Guitariste Metal&quot;, he never thought he&#x27;d embrace something like Christianity, but certain things in life made him look deeper. From what he said, he didn&#x27;t subscribe to all of the doctrine in a traditional sense. 

==Career==
===1990s===
Along with guitarists Dominic Miller and Tony Zemaitis, Stetina was featured in the March 1993 issue of &quot;Guitarist&quot; magazine.

Collaborating with Charlie Busher, Stetina had the book and CD combination, &quot;Speed and Thrash Metal Drum Method&quot; released in 1993. It was reviewed in Issue 166 of the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine. It received a positive review, beginning with, &quot;It&#x27;s about time! In the wake of countless rock chart books that assume too much, along comes an instructional book/ CD package that assumes nothing&quot;. It catered for those who didn&#x27;t read music and went from the basics upward. Even though the reviewer said an aspect of it was a bit cursory and misleading, the package was &quot;so valuable&quot; and those who couldn&#x27;t read music, rockers and non-rockers and those experienced players who play by ear could benefit.

Two videos hosted by Stetina were &quot;Beginning Lead Guitar&quot; and &quot;Beginning Rock Rhythm Guitar&quot; were marketed through the Hal Leonard Corp., and were released around 1994, 1995.
===2000s===
Stetina was interviewed by Bobby Tanzilo for the online magazine, &quot;OnMilwaukee&quot; in 2005. In the interview he talked about his musical background and the new band Oversoulss that he had put together and who had recorded their debut album and were getting ready to tour with the band Alter Bridge.

Stetina&#x27;s band, Oversoulss, were set to appear at the Brat Stop in Kenosha in May 2015. At the time the line up comprised Stetina on guitar, David Rangel on vocals, Eddie Shapanske on drums, and Dan Evans on bass.

One of Stetina&#x27;s articles Return of the Shred, Come Together Two Essential Hybrid Scales appeared in the Volume 9, No 2 February 2006 issue of &quot;Guitar One&quot; magazine. It was about combining scales and having a wider range.

In 2007, the band he was guitarist in Generation X released their album &quot;Impilcations of a Genetic Disease&quot;.
===2010s===
The Conservatorium van Amsterdam reported on November 3, 2010, Troy Stetina and Mark Tremonti were hosting a guitar clinic on the 7th of that month.

Working with Mark Tremonti, helped create the &quot;Sound and the Story&quot; dvd, which was published by Fret12 Productions.

Stetina was interviewed by Mohsen Fayyazi for &quot;Metal Shock Finland&quot; which was published on June 25, 2015. Fayyazi has also interviewed people and musicians such as Markus Grosskopf, and Martin Popoff.

Stetina&#x27;s interview with Mike Huberty of the long-standing Madison music magazine, &quot;Maximum Ink&quot; was published in September, 2012. He mentioned that he had reached a point in the 1990s where he had given up on bands. He also mentioned is association with Mark Tremonti and his band Second Soul and coming across the lead singer for his band, Scott Yanke.

According to &quot;La Scena Musicale&quot;, Stetina was booked along with Leo Kottke, Antoine Dufour, Ana Vidovic, and Jonathan Kreisberg to appear at the Wilson Center Guitar Competition &amp; Festival which ran from August 13 to 15, 2015, at the Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts.

==&quot;Speed Mechanics for Lead Guitar&quot;==
&quot;Speed Mechanics for Lead Guitar&quot; () is a guitar tutorial book by Stetina first published in 1990. It is designed to teach lead guitar techniques, how to practice and encourage evolving creativity. It is split into three sections Mechanics, Rhythm and Creativity. It Includes a rock version of &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot; by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, &quot;Caprice No. 10&quot; by Niccolò Paganini and &quot;Prelude in D&quot; by JS Bach.

<doc id="752889" wikidata="Q7925428" url="?curid=752889" title="Vicki Morgan">
<text>Victoria Lynn Morgan (August 9, 1952 – July 7, 1983) was the mistress of Alfred S. Bloomingdale, heir to the Bloomingdale&#x27;s department store fortune. The details of their tumultuous relationship became known after Morgan sued Bloomingdale&#x27;s estate for palimony in 1982. Morgan was murdered in 1983 by Marvin Pancoast, her roommate and occasional lover who was sentenced to prison.

==Early life==
Vicki Morgan was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Her mother, Constance Laney, and Vicki&#x27;s father, a United States Air Force veteran, divorced soon after Vicki&#x27;s birth. Constance remarried, but that husband died when Vicki was about 9 years old. Vicki and her mother relocated to Montclair, California. At 16, Vicki Morgan became pregnant, dropped out of Chaffey High School, and gave birth to a son, Todd. Leaving Todd with her mother, Morgan ran away from home in 1968.

==Bloomingdale mistress==
She found work as an usher at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles. She soon married 47-year-old Earl Lamb.

In August 1969, whilst still 17, Morgan met 53-year-old financier Alfred S. Bloomingdale, a married multi-millionaire from the famous department store family, in a restaurant on the Sunset Strip. Bloomingdale soon took Morgan as a mistress, and would have her watch as he lashed naked prostitutes with his belt. When Morgan was 18, Bloomingdale offered Lamb a large cash payment to end his marriage with Morgan. Bloomingdale provided an apartment for her.

As Bloomingdale&#x27;s mistress, her social circle would include politicians, businessmen, and the wealthy playboy Bernie Cornfeld. With Bloomingdale&#x27;s financial support, she lived a lavish lifestyle. In 1973, Bloomingdale&#x27;s wife, Betsy, learned of her husband&#x27;s affair and told him to break off the relationship. He complied, and Morgan spiraled into poverty and depression.

By 1979, Morgan had been through two more marriages and long periods of sex work, and had become a drug addict. That year she entered rehabilitation, where she met Marvin Pancoast, a gay man who was infatuated with Morgan and her stories of the high life she led with Bloomingdale. They vowed to live together once released from treatment. Three years later, Bloomingdale was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He purportedly told Morgan that he had only two months to live and assured her she would be well cared for and never have to worry about money again.

==Palimony and murder==
The financial situation for the 30-year-old Morgan quickly turned desperate. To protect herself, she hired the famous Hollywood palimony attorney Marvin Mitchelson to file an $11 million lawsuit ($ million today) for financial compensation as Bloomingdale&#x27;s mistress. The pre-trial media coverage of the initial complaint revealed details of the couple&#x27;s sexual relationship that grabbed headlines nationwide, causing particular embarrassment amongst Bloomingdale&#x27;s friends in Washington, D.C. However, when Morgan learned that Mitchelson had dinner and a meeting with President Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy the latter of whom was friends with Betsy Bloomingdale Morgan lost trust in Mitchelson, fired him, and hired attorney Robert Steinberg in his place.

Later court documents and news stories revealed that Morgan supported herself by selling off the jewelry and the expensive car purchased for her by Bloomingdale. It was later reported that she was preparing to write a tell-all book which was going to name influential politicians and businessmen who had been clients of hers. Bloomingdale died of cancer less than two months after the lawsuit was filed.

Morgan contacted her friend from rehab, Marvin Pancoast, and moved into an apartment with him. She returned to working as a prostitute while he worked odd jobs. Although Pancoast was a homosexual, their relationship was occasionally sexual. Pancoast thought he had contracted HIV and was terminally ill. He was distraught and unstable after his daily counseling sessions were terminated by psychiatrist Dr. Paul Cantalupo.

On the evening of July 7, 1983, less than eleven months after Bloomingdale&#x27;s death, Pancoast walked into a police station and confessed to murdering Morgan in their apartment. Police found Morgan, apparently beaten to death with a baseball bat. She was buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills. Pancoast was sentenced to 26 years-to-life in prison and died in 1991 in Chino, California, while undergoing treatment for AIDS-related illnesses.

Morgan&#x27;s 1982 palimony lawsuit against Bloomingdale&#x27;s estate continued on behalf of her son Todd (born ). She had referred to a contract in which Bloomingdale would have given her $240,000, but instead she was given $40,000. During the trial, the judge ruled the agreement unenforceable as it was for the illegal act of &quot;sex for hire.&quot; In December 1984, a jury awarded Morgan&#x27;s estate the remaining $200,000 ($ today).

==In popular media==
Morgan&#x27;s story received considerable print coverage and in 1985 author Gordon Basichis wrote the book &quot;Beautiful Bad Girl: The Vicki Morgan Story&quot;. In 1990, Dominick Dunne wrote a fictional portrayal of Morgan in his book, &quot;An Inconvenient Woman&quot;. The story of her life and death was the topic of &quot;Vanity Fair Confidential&quot; (Season 4, Episode 7: Murder Most Obsessive) which first aired on March 19, 2018. Her BDSM-based relationships with Alfred Bloomingdale and Marvin Pancoast are also explored in the &quot;Poisoned Passions&quot; episode &quot;Sadistic Pleasure&quot;.

Morgan&#x27;s story is mentioned in the 1996 film &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot; in a courtroom scene in which Larry is asked about his source of the John DeLorean video.

In the feature film &quot;Fletch&quot; (1985), Chevy Chase&#x27;s character Fletch mentions &quot;Vicki Morgan tapes&quot; when talking to his boss about two witnesses rummaging through his boss&#x27;s office.

The Song &quot;Der Mord an Vicky Morgan&quot; from the German music group &quot;Die Toten Hosen&quot; is based on the story of Vicki Morgan.

In 2023, Morgan&#x27;s story was covered by the true crime podcast &quot;Swindled&quot;.

<doc id="752892" wikidata="Q1070766" url="?curid=752892" title="Chester Thompson">
<text>Chester Thompson (born December 11, 1948) is an American drummer best known for his tenures with Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, Weather Report, Santana, Genesis and Phil Collins. Thompson has performed with his jazz group, the Chester Thompson Trio, since 2011.

==Early life==
Thompson was born on December 11, 1948, in Baltimore, Maryland. He has an older brother, who played in the drum corps. At elementary school, he learned to play the flute and read music. At eleven, Thompson took up the drums, receiving lessons from James Harrison, a professional jazz drummer from whom he learned his rudiments. Thompson practiced by playing along with albums by jazz musicians Miles Davis, Max Roach and Art Blakey. From there, he moved on to studying records by drummer Elvin Jones, whom Thompson cites as a major musical influence along with Tony Williams. While attending high school, he studied privately with drummer and percussionist Tony Ames of the National Symphony Orchestra for one semester. Thompson&#x27;s practice focused on mastering drumming rudiments using a book published by the National Association of Rudimental Drummers. He started to play his first live gigs two years later in local venues. Still underage, Thompson went as far as to draw a moustache on his upper lip using an eyebrow pencil &quot;because the club owners were worried about me playing there&quot;. He played as many as three jam sessions a week.

==Career==
===1970–1976: Early bands, Frank Zappa, and Weather Report===
Among his first major jobs was a short tour, mainly across Canada, with singer Ben E. King. In 1970, he played with organist Jack McDuff, followed by gigs with other local groups, including time in Boston with keyboardist Webster Lewis. In 1971, Thompson returned to Baltimore and studied music at the Community College of Baltimore County for two years, where he learned the flute and coached a basketball team at the Rec Center. He played as part of the house band in a club that supported visiting soul artists. Thompson built a reputation as a session drummer. One of his first bands was Doc &quot;Soul Stirrer&quot; Young and the We Four Trio. Since the early 1970s, Thompson has played with the jazz rock band Air Pocket, a band with the Fowler Brothers at its core.

In 1973, shortly before Thompson was to start a four-year course at another music school, he had auditioned to join Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention and won the position. He was a friend of their tour manager, Marty Perellis, also of Baltimore, and landed an audition in Los Angeles after learning of Zappa&#x27;s wish to use two drummers in his group. Thompson recalled the audition involved him jamming with the band for a solid hour without a break. &quot;We just drifted in and out of so many different kinds of feels and grooves.&quot; His time in Zappa&#x27;s band was challenging because of the leader&#x27;s &quot;incredibly difficult music&quot; which involved as much as 40 hours of weekly practice for four to six weeks before a tour. Thompson played on several Zappa albums, including &quot;Roxy &amp; Elsewhere&quot; (1974), &quot;One Size Fits All&quot; (1975), &quot;Studio Tan&quot; (1978), &quot;Sleep Dirt&quot; (1979), and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 2&quot; (1988).

In 1975, Thompson left Zappa after he had cancelled an upcoming Australian tour. Upon returning to Los Angeles Thompson met Weather Report bassist Alphonso Johnson, who suggested he jam with the band as they sought a new drummer, following the departure of Leon &quot;Ndugu&quot; Chancler. Despite Thompson not wanting to audition, the group had considered Woody Theus but they chose Thompson for the spot. Thompson recalled his time in the band as a &quot;major knock out&quot; because he was a big fan. After playing on &quot;Black Market&quot; (1976), he left.

After leaving Weather Report, Thompson played recording sessions in Los Angeles as well as part of the San Francisco Broadway theatre production of &quot;The Wiz&quot;. He was recommended for the gig by his friend Roy McCurdy, and it was there where he met his future wife who had parts in the musical. He also toured as a member of the live band for The Pointer Sisters, and rehearsed with Santana after they expressed an interest in having Thompson join the band.
===1976–1992, 2007: Genesis===
Shortly after rehearsals with Santana began, Genesis drummer and singer Phil Collins invited Thompson to join the band as their touring drummer, replacing Bill Bruford who wished to move on after one tour. Collins wanted an American drummer for the spot, and heard Thompson&#x27;s playing on &quot;Roxy &amp; Elsewhere&quot; which featured Thompson playing in tandem with drummer Ralph Humphrey. Thompson had heard of Genesis&#x27;s music from Johnson, and agreed to join the band for rehearsals in late 1976 for their upcoming tour supporting &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; (1976). He recalled: &quot;The first day of rehearsal, we just started jamming as everybody was setting up gear, we were just going for it&quot;. Thompson looked back on his time joining Genesis as &quot;the biggest adjustment I&#x27;ve ever had to make, musically and culturally.&quot;

Thompson performed with Genesis on every tour between 1977 and 1992, and once more for their Turn It On Again: The Tour in 2007. He is featured on the live albums &quot;Seconds Out&quot; (1977), &quot;Three Sides Live&quot; (1982), &quot;The Way We Walk, Volume One: The Shorts&quot; (1992), &quot;The Way We Walk, Volume Two: The Longs&quot; (1993), and &quot;Live over Europe 2007&quot; (2007). After the 1992 tour, Thompson stepped down in order to spend more time with his family. He talked with bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford about the possibility of playing the drums on their final studio album, &quot;Calling All Stations&quot; (1997). However, since Collins had left the band, Thompson wanted to become a full-time member and not continue as a side man. Genesis continued without Thompson (and without an official permanent drummer) for the album and tour.

===Other endeavours===
====1980s====
In addition to Genesis, Thompson was also the touring drummer for Collins&#x27;s solo tours between 1982 and 2005. He is featured on the live release &quot;Serious Hits... Live!&quot; (1990).

In 1986, Thompson played the drums on &quot;The Next Time I Fall&quot;. The soft rock duet between Peter Cetera and Amy Grant hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

In 1988, Thompson was invited to play for what turned out to be Zappa&#x27;s final concert tour before his death. Thompson declined the offer as by this time, he had become a devout Christian and Zappa&#x27;s anti-religious sentiments and lyrics conflicted with his beliefs.

In 1989, Thompson worked as the drummer for Bee Gees for their One for All World Tour in support for &quot;One&quot; (1989). He was replaced by Michael Murphy.

He was also a founding member of the band Fire Merchants with Brand X guitarist John Goodsall and bassist Doug Lunn and appeared on their first eponymous recording in 1989. Thompson played drums with Santana in 1984 and is credited in the Beyond Appearances album along with Chester D. Thompson on keyboards.

====1990s====
Thompson continued to work with other members of Genesis on their solo projects. Thompson also plays on the Steve Hackett albums, &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Touch&quot; (1978) and &quot;Watcher of the Skies: Genesis Revisited&quot; (1996). Later on, he played on Tony Banks&#x27; solo album &quot;A Curious Feeling&quot; (1979). He also appears on Steve Hackett&#x27;s live album &quot;The Tokyo Tapes&quot; released in 1998 which also features John Wetton, Ian McDonald and Julian Colbeck.

In 1992, Thompson and his family relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, after liking the area when they visited to attend noted drummer Larrie Londin&#x27;s funeral. He has since played on sessions for various artists in the area, mainly in jazz, pop, and Christian music.

In 1995, former Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett invited Thompson to play on his Genesis project album &quot;Genesis Revisited&quot;. Thompson was unsure of playing on all of the tracks as initially discussed, and said &quot;we both thought it would be too weird to do the whole album with both of us being sort of ex-Genesis people&quot;. Instead, Hackett brought on additional musicians and Thompson played on just three tracks.

In the late 1990s, Thompson began touring with jazz guitarist Denny Jiosa. In 1999, he released his first solo album, &quot;A Joyful Noise&quot;. In 2001, Thompson toured Korea with singer and worship leader Ron Kenoly. In January 2002, Thompson performed at the debut charity gig by Collins&#x27;s Little Dreams Foundation.

Thompson has taught drums at Belmont University in Nashville since 1998, and has also taken classes at the university in composition and arranging. In 2008, he was &quot;two classes away&quot; from earning a degree. He is an adjunct instructor at its school of music.

====2000s–present====
In 2008, Thompson was honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 32nd Percussive Arts Society International Convention (PASIC).

Thompson&#x27;s professional association with Collins ended in 2010, where tensions grew over Collins&#x27; dissatisfaction with Thompson&#x27;s drumming during the &quot;Going Back&quot; tour. Thompson said that he had not spoken to Collins since: &quot;I was pretty upset. But I&#x27;m over it now. I wish him nothing but the best.&quot; He also had praise for Nic Collins, Phil&#x27;s son and Thompson&#x27;s successor as drummer for both Collins&#x27; comeback solo tour in 2017-2019 and Genesis&#x27; 2021 reunion tour. As a child, Nic had travelled with Genesis during their 2007 tour, with Thompson later remarking, &quot;We knew at five or six years old that this kid was going to be a monster. I think it’s fantastic that he got to play with his dad.”

In 2011, Thompson formed his jazz group, the Chester Thompson Trio, with pianist Joe Davidian and bassist Mike Rinne. They had initially played together as part of the rhythm section of the Nashville Trombone Festival which was followed by a weekly residency at the Commodore Lounge for over a year. They have released two albums: &quot;Approved&quot; (2013) and &quot;Simpler Times&quot; (2015).

In 2021, Thompson said that he no longer teaches drumming at a university, but continues giving private lessons to pupils at a school.
In 2025 it was announced Chester Thompson would be teaming up with prog legends Neal Morse, Phil Keaggy, and Byron House in a new band called Cosmic Cathedral. Their first song was released February 21st 2025 with the album to release April 25th 2025. 

==Gear==
Thompson has endorsed Ludwig Drums (1970–March, 1977), Pearl Drums (April, 1977 – July, 1987), Sonor Drums (1990–1999) and Paiste cymbals (1970–1990); he has endorsed DW Drums since 2000 and Sabian Cymbals since 1990. He uses Remo drumheads, Meinl Percussion, Gibraltar racks and has his own Regal Tip Chester Thompson signature drumstick.

==Personal life==
Thompson met his wife during his time playing in &quot;The Wiz&quot; in 1976. They have a son, Akil.

In 1980, Thompson became a Christian. He later became an Elder in the Nashville Church on the Way.

<text>Frederick Johannes &#x27;Fritz&#x27; van Heerden (born 29 June 1970) is a former South African rugby union player who played international rugby for the Springboks, making his debut on 4 June 1994 in Pretoria against the England touring side. Van Heerden played rugby with Western Province and Leicester Tigers.

==Playing career==
Van Heerden matriculated at Roodepoort High School in 1988 and represented at the annual Craven Week tournament in 1988. In 1991 he enrolled for a law degree at the University of Stellenbosch and represented Maties on the rugby field. He made his senior provincial debut in July 1991, when he replaced the injured Gert Smal, in the team. In 1996 he was named the Western Province captain.

He joined Leicester Tigers in 1997, following fellow South African Joel Stransky, and joining up with Martin Johnson, and replacing Matt Poole who acquired a knee injury at about the same time with Dean Richards (normally a number eight) playing lock. Also able to play flanker, he complemented Johnson&#x27;s more powerful play with mobility, but perhaps more importantly he pioneered the contesting of the opposition&#x27;s line-out throws.

He returned to South Africa in 1999 to try to play for his country in the 1999 World Cup, and was drafted into the side late as a replacement for Selborne Boome, playing against Spain. After the World Cup, he returned to Leicester where he helped in the development of England lock Ben Kay. He retired.

<doc id="752895" wikidata="Q388628" url="?curid=752895" title="Meckel's diverticulum">
<text>A Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum, a true congenital diverticulum, is a slight bulge in the small intestine present at birth and a vestigial remnant of the vitelline duct. It is the most common malformation of the gastrointestinal tract and is present in approximately 2% of the population, with males more frequently experiencing symptoms.

Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum was first explained by Fabricius Hildanus in the sixteenth century and later named after Johann Friedrich Meckel, who described the embryological origin of this type of diverticulum in 1809.

==Signs and symptoms==
The majority of people with a Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum are asymptomatic. An asymptomatic Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum is called a &quot;silent&quot; Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum. If symptoms do occur, they typically appear before the age of two years. The most common presenting symptom is painless rectal bleeding such as melaena-like black offensive stools, followed by intestinal obstruction, volvulus and intussusception. Occasionally, Meckel&#x27;s diverticulitis may present with all the features of acute appendicitis. Also, severe pain in the epigastric region is experienced by the person along with bloating in the epigastric and umbilical regions. At times, the symptoms are so painful that they may cause sleepless nights with acute pain felt in the foregut region, specifically in the epigastric and umbilical regions. In some cases, bleeding occurs without warning and may stop spontaneously. The symptoms can be extremely painful, often mistaken as just stomach pain resulting from not eating or constipation. Rarely, a Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum containing ectopic pancreatic tissue can present with abdominal pain and increased serum amylase levels, mimicking acute pancreatitis.

===Complications===
The lifetime risk for a person with Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum to develop certain complications is about 4–6%. Gastrointestinal bleeding, peritonitis or intestinal obstruction may occur in 15–30% of symptomatic people (Table 1). On rare occasions the diverticulum can herniate through the abdominal wall also known as a Littre hernia. Only 6.4% of all complications require surgical treatment, and untreated Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum has a mortality rate of 2.5–15%.

Table 1 – Complications of Meckel&#x27;s Diverticulum:
====Bleeding====
Bleeding of the diverticulum is most common in young children, especially in males who are less than 2 years of age. Symptoms may include bright red blood in stools (hematochezia), weakness, abdominal tenderness or pain, and even anaemia in some cases.

Bleeding may be caused by:
* Ectopic gastric or pancreatic mucosa:
# Where diverticulum contains embryonic remnants of mucosa of other tissue types.
# Secretion of gastric acid or alkaline pancreatic juice from the ectopic mucosa leads to ulceration in the adjacent ileal mucosa i.e. peptic or pancreatic ulcer.
# Pain, bleeding or perforation of the bowel at the diverticulum may result.
# Mechanical stimulation may also cause erosion and ulceration.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding may be self-limiting but chronic bleeding may lead to iron deficiency anaemia.

The appearance of stools may indicate the nature of the bleeding:
* &quot;Tarry stools&quot;: Alteration of blood produced by slow bowel transit due to minor bleeding in upper gastrointestinal tract
* &quot;Bright red blood stools&quot;: Brisk bleeding
* &quot;Stools with blood streak&quot;: Anal fissure
* &quot;&quot;Currant jelly&quot; stools&quot;: Ischaemia of the intestine leads to copious mucus production and may indicate that one part of the bowel invaginates into another (intussusception).

====Diverticulitis====

Inflammation of the diverticulum can mimic symptoms of appendicitis, i.e., periumbilical tenderness and intermittent crampy abdominal pain. Perforation of the inflamed diverticulum can result in peritonitis. Diverticulitis can also cause adhesions, leading to intestinal obstruction.

Diverticulitis may result from:
* Association with the mesodiverticular band attaching to the diverticulum tip where torsion has occurred, causing inflammation and ischaemia.
* Peptic ulceration resulting from ectopic gastric mucosa of the diverticulum
* Perforation by trauma or ingested foreign material (e.g., vegetable stalks, seeds, or fish/chicken bones) that become lodged in the Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum.
* Luminal obstruction due to tumors, enterolith, or another foreign body, causing stasis or bacterial infection.
* Association with acute appendicitis

====Intestinal obstruction====

Symptoms: Vomiting, abdominal pain and severe or complete constipation.
* The vitelline vessels remnant that connects the diverticulum to the umbilicus may form a fibrous or twisting band (volvulus), trapping the small intestine and causing obstruction. Localised periumbilical pain may be experienced in the right lower quadrant (like appendicitis).
* &quot;Incarceration&quot;: when a Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum is constricted in an inguinal hernia, forming a Littré hernia that obstructs the intestine.
* Chronic diverticulitis causing stricture
* Strangulation of the diverticulum in the obturator foramen.
* Tumors e.g. carcinoma: direct spread of an adenocarcinoma arising in the diverticulum may lead to obstruction
* Lithiasis, stones that are formed in Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum can:
# Extrude into the terminal ileum, leading to obstruction
# Induce local inflammation and intussusception.
* The diverticulum itself or a tumour within it may cause intussusception – for example, from the ileum to the colon – causing obstruction. Symptoms of this include &quot;currant jelly&quot; stools and a palpable lump in the lower abdomen. This occurs when the diverticulum inverts into the lumen of the ileum, due to either:
# An &quot;active&quot; peristaltic mechanism of the diverticulum that attempts to remove irritating factors
# A &quot;passive&quot; process such as the transit of food

====Umbilical anomalies====

Anomalies between the diverticulum and umbilicus may include the presence of a fibrous cord, cyst, fistula, or sinus, leading to:
* Infection or excoriation of periumbilical skin, resulting in a discharging sinus
* Recurrent infection and healing of sinus
* Abscess formation in the abdominal wall
* Increased risk of volvulus formation and internal herniation

====Tumors====

Neoplasms (tumors) in Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum may cause bleeding, acute abdominal pain, gastrointestinal obstruction, perforation or intussusception. They may be benign or malignant.
* Benign tumors:
# Leiomyoma
# Lipoma
# Vascular and neuromuscular hamartoma
* Malignant tumors:
# Carcinoids: most common, 44%
# Mesenchymal tumors: Leiomyosarcoma, peripheral nerve sheath and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, 35%
# Adenocarcinoma, 16%
# Desmoplastic small round cell tumor

====Other complications====
* A diverticulum inside a Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum (daughter diverticula)
* Stones and phytobezoar (a bezoar of vegetable fibers) in Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum
* Vesicodiverticular fistula

==Pathophysiology==

The omphalomesenteric duct (omphaloenteric duct, vitelline duct, or yolk stalk) normally connects the embryonic midgut to the yolk sac ventrally, providing nutrients to the midgut during embryonic development. The vitelline duct narrows progressively and disappears between the 5th and 8th weeks of gestation.

In Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum, the proximal part of vitelline duct fails to regress and involute, which remains as a remnant of variable length and location. The solitary diverticulum lies on the antimesenteric border of the ileum (opposite to the mesenteric attachment) and extends into the umbilical cord of the embryo. The left and right vitelline arteries originate from the primitive dorsal aorta, and travel with the vitelline duct. The right becomes the superior mesenteric artery that supplies a terminal branch to the diverticulum, while the left involutes. Having its own blood supply, Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum is susceptible to obstruction or infection.
Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum is located in the distal ileum, usually within 60–100 cm (2 feet) of the ileocecal valve. This &quot;blind segment&quot; or small pouch is about 3–6 cm (2 inch) long and may have a greater lumen diameter than that of the ileum. It runs antimesenterically and has its own blood supply. It is a remnant of the connection from the yolk sac to the small intestine present during embryonic development. It is a &quot;true diverticulum&quot;, consisting of all three layers of the bowel wall: mucosa, submucosa and muscularis propria.

As the vitelline duct is made up of pluripotent cell lining, Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum may harbor abnormal tissues, containing embryonic remnants of other tissue types. Jejunal, duodenal mucosa or Brunner&#x27;s tissue were each found in 2% of ectopic cases. Heterotopic rests of gastric mucosa and pancreatic tissue are seen in 60% and 6% of cases respectively. Heterotopic means the displacement of an organ from its normal anatomic location. Inflammation of this Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum may mimic appendicitis. Therefore, during appendectomy, ileum should be checked for the presence of Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum, if it is found to be present it should be removed along with appendix.

A memory aid is the rule of 2s:
* &quot;2%&quot; (of the population)
* &quot;2&quot; feet (proximal to the ileocecal valve)
* &quot;2&quot; inches (in length)
* &quot;2&quot; types of common ectopic tissue (gastric and pancreatic)
* &quot;2&quot; years is the most common age at clinical presentation
* 2:1 male:female ratio
However, the exact values for the above criteria range from 0.2–5 (for example, prevalence is probably 0.2–4%).

It can also be present as an indirect hernia, typically on the right side, where it is known as a &quot;Hernia of Littré&quot;. A case report of strangulated umbilical hernia with Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum has also been published in the literature. Furthermore, it can be attached to the umbilical region by the vitelline ligament, with the possibility of vitelline cysts, or even a patent vitelline canal forming a vitelline fistula when the umbilical cord is cut. Torsions of intestine around the intestinal stalk may also occur, leading to obstruction, ischemia, and necrosis.

==Diagnosis==

A technetium-99m (99mTc) pertechnetate scan, also called Meckel scan or nuclear scintigraphy scan, is the investigation of choice to diagnose Meckel&#x27;s diverticula in children. This scan detects gastric mucosa; since approximately 50% of symptomatic Meckel&#x27;s diverticula have ectopic gastric or pancreatic cells contained within them, this is displayed as a spot on the scan distant from the stomach itself. In children, this scan is highly accurate and noninvasive, with 95% specificity and 85% sensitivity; however, in adults the test is only 9% specific and 62% sensitive. This scan is more accurate in children because gastric mucosa is found in 90% of bleeding diverticula; which is the most common symptom in children, not adults. 

Patients with these misplaced gastric cells may experience peptic ulcers as a consequence. Therefore, other tests such as colonoscopy and screenings for bleeding disorders should be performed, and angiography can assist in determining the location and severity of bleeding. Colonoscopy might be helpful to rule out other sources of bleeding but it is not used as an identification tool. Angiography might identify brisk bleeding in patients with Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum.

Ultrasonography could demonstrate omphaloenteric duct remnants or cysts. Computed tomography (CT scan) might be a useful tool to demonstrate a blind ended and inflamed structure in the mid-abdominal cavity, which is not an appendix.

In asymptomatic patients, Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum is often diagnosed as an incidental finding during laparoscopy or laparotomy.

==Treatment==
Treatment is surgical, potentially with a laparoscopic resection. In patients with bleeding, strangulation of bowel, bowel perforation or bowel obstruction, treatment involves surgical resection of both the Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum itself along with the adjacent bowel segment, and this procedure is called a &quot;small bowel resection&quot;. In patients without any of the aforementioned complications, treatment involves surgical resection of the Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum only, and this procedure is called a simple diverticulectomy.

With regards to asymptomatic Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum, some recommend that a search for Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum should be conducted in every case of appendectomy/laparotomy done for acute abdomen, and if found, Meckel&#x27;s diverticulectomy or resection should be performed to avoid secondary complications arising from it.

==Epidemiology==
Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum occurs in about 2% of the population. Prevalence in males is 3–5 times higher than in females. Only 2% of cases are symptomatic, which usually presents among children at the age of 2.

Most cases of Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum are diagnosed when complications manifest or incidentally in unrelated conditions such as laparotomy, laparoscopy or contrast study of the small intestine. Classic presentation in adults includes intestinal obstruction and inflammation of the diverticulum (diverticulitis). Painless rectal bleeding most commonly occurs in toddlers.

Inflammation in the ileal diverticulum has symptoms that mimic appendicitis, therefore its diagnosis is of clinical importance. Detailed knowledge of the pathophysiological properties is essential in dealing with the life-threatening complications of Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum.

<doc id="752897" wikidata="Q4985952" url="?curid=752897" title="Buffer gas">
<text>A buffer gas is an inert or nonflammable gas. In the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, nitrogen acts as a buffer gas. A buffer gas adds pressure to a system and controls the speed of combustion with any oxygen present. Any inert gas such as helium, neon, or argon will serve as a buffer gas.

A buffer gas usually consists of atomically inert gases such as helium, argon, or nitrogen. Krypton, neon, and xenon are also used, primarily for lighting. In most scenarios, buffer gases are used in conjunction with other molecules for the main purpose of causing collisions with the other co-existing molecules.

Buffer gases are commonly used in many applications from high pressure discharge lamps to reduce line width of microwave transitions in alkali atoms.

== Uses ==

=== Lighting ===
In fluorescent lamps, mercury is used as the primary ion from which light is emitted. Krypton is the buffer gas used in conjunction with the mercury which is used to moderate the momentum of collisions of mercury ions in order to reduce the damage done to the electrodes in the fluorescent lamp. Generally speaking, the longest lasting lamps are those with the heaviest noble gases as buffer gases.

=== Industrial ===
Buffer gases are also commonly used in compressors used in power plants for supplying gas to gas turbines. The buffer gas fills the spaces between seals in the compressor. This space is usually about 2 micrometres wide. The gas must be completely dry and free of any contaminants. Contaminants can potentially lodge in the space between the seal and cause metal to metal contact in the compressor, leading to compressor failure. In this case the buffer gas acts in a way much like oil does in an automotive engine&#x27;s bearings.

=== Buffer gas cooling ===
Buffer gas loading techniques have been developed for use in cooling charged or paramagnetic atoms and molecules at ultra-cold temperatures. The buffer gas most commonly used in this sort of application is helium.

Suppose we have some very cold helium gas as cryogenic buffer gas, then any cloud of particles floating within that buffer gas would exchange energy with the buffer gas, until it reaches the same temperature (thermalized). The problem is that the cloud of particles would diffuse away.

In buffer gas cooling, the cloud of particles we want to cool down is caught in a trap that lets the helium atom pass through. If the particles are electrically charged, then the trap can be the Penning trap or the Paul trap. If the particles are electrically neutral, but paramagnetic, then the trap can be a magnetic trap (as helium is diamagnetic), such as the anti-Helmholtz pair. Paramagnetic atoms are low-field-seeking while diamagnetic atoms are high-field-seeking, so in a magnetic trap, there is a central region where the magnetic field is zero, rising in all directions. Paramagnetic atoms would be trapped in that zero-field region while the diamagnetic atoms would be repelled away.

Buffer gas cooling can be used on just about any molecule, as long as the molecule is capable of surviving multiple collisions with low energy helium atoms, which most molecules are capable of doing. Buffer gas cooling is allowing the molecules of interest to be cooled through elastic collisions with a cold buffer gas inside a chamber. If there are enough collisions between the buffer gas and the other molecules of interest before the molecules hit the walls of the chamber and are gone, the buffer gas will sufficiently cool the atoms. Of the two isotopes of helium (3He and 4He), the rarer 3He is sometimes used over 4He as it provides significantly higher vapor pressures and buffer gas density at sub-kelvin temperatures.

<text>Koplik&#x27;s spots (also Koplik&#x27;s sign) are a prodromic viral enanthem of measles manifesting two to three days before the measles rash itself. They are characterized as clustered, white lesions on the buccal mucosa (opposite the upper 1st &amp; 2nd molars) and are pathognomonic for measles. The textbook description of Koplik spots is ulcerated mucosal lesions marked by necrosis, neutrophilic exudate, and neovascularization. They are described as appearing like &quot;grains of salt on a reddish background&quot;, and often fade as the maculopapular rash develops. As well as their diagnostic significance, they are important in the control of outbreaks. Their appearance, in context of a diagnosed case, before they reach maximum infectivity, permits isolation of the contacts and greatly aids control of this highly infectious disease.

Nobel laureate John F. Enders and Thomas Peebles, who first isolated the measles virus, were careful to collect their samples from patients showing Koplik&#x27;s spots.

==History==
Koplik&#x27;s spots are named after Henry Koplik (1858–1927), an American pediatrician who published a short description of them in 1896, emphasising their appearance before the skin rash and their value in the differential diagnosis of diseases with which measles might be mistaken. He published two further papers on the spots, including one with a colour illustration. An anonymous reviewer of Koplik&#x27;s &quot;The Diseases of Infancy and Childhood&quot; refers to the illustration as &quot;the now famous coloured plate&quot;.

Some authors ascribe the first written description of these spots to Reubold, Würzburg 1854, and others to Johann Andreas Murray (1740–1791). Before Koplik, the German internist Carl Jakob Adolf Christian Gerhardt (1833–1902) in 1874, the Danish physician N. Flindt in 1879, and the Russian Nil Filatov (1847–1902) in 1895, had observed equivalent phenomena. Koplik was aware of Filatov&#x27;s work, thought his evidence insufficient and rejected his claim for priority.

<text>Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly (abbreviated as JDW) is a weekly magazine reporting on military and corporate affairs, edited by Peter Felstead. It is one of a number of military-related publications named after John F. T. Jane, an Englishman who first published &quot;Jane&#x27;s All the World&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; in 1898. It is a unit of Janes Information Services. The magazine is frequently cited in publications worldwide.

==History==
&quot;Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly&quot; was established in 1984 replacing the now-defunct &quot;Jane&#x27;s Defence Review&quot;. The latter was started in 1978 and was published on a monthly basis. Award winning international journalist Clifford Beal is a former editor of the magazine.

===Samuel Loring Morison===
In 1984, only months after the magazine was established, &quot;Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly&quot; gained worldwide attention after printing several images from an American spy satellite of the Nikolaiev 444 shipyard in the Black Sea, showing a Kiev-class aircraft carrier under construction. The images were leaked by Samuel Loring Morison, an American intelligence professional, leading to the only conviction ever passed against a US government official for giving classified information to the press.

<text>Albert von Keller (27 April 1844 – 14 July 1920) was a German painter of Swiss ancestry. He specialized in portraits and indoor scenes. Female figures are a prominent feature of his work.

== Biography ==
Keller was born in Gais, Switzerland. He was one of eight children born to Caroline Keller, who was divorced at the time of his birth. As was customary, she had resumed the use of her maiden name. Her ex-husband&#x27;s brother may have been his true father. When he was three, after several moves, the family settled in Bayreuth where he attended primary school and took piano lessons. In 1852, his mother became a citizen of Bavaria and, by extension, so did he. Sometime in mid-1854, they relocated to Munich and he was enrolled at the . He graduated in 1863 and transferred to Ludwig Maximilian University to study law.

After 1865, he decided to pursue a career in art instead, but spent only a short time at the Academy of Fine Arts. He made numerous study trips throughout Germany, France, Italy and the Low Countries. From 1867 he worked at several different studios throughout Munich, including that of Arthur von Ramberg, where he drew nude studies. He had his first showing at the Glaspalast in 1869 and became a member of &quot;&quot;, an artists&#x27; association, in 1873.

In 1878, he married Irene von Eichthal (1858–1907), great-granddaughter of the Bavarian Court Banker, Aron Elias Seligmann, Freiherr von Eichthal. He would eventually paint over forty portraits of her. Their first son died as an infant. Their second son, Balthasar, was born in 1884, but died in 1906, shortly before his mother.

He exhibited at the Salon for the first time in 1883, while living in Paris. In 1886, he became a member of the new &quot;Munich Psychological Society&quot;; actually a group devoted to the paranormal, founded by Albert von Schrenck-Notzing. Soon he began representing parapsychological motifs, connected to Christian themes, with visions and hallucinations. In 1892, he was one of the co-founders of the Munich Secession and served as vice president from 1904 to 1920. He was also a board member of the Deutscher Künstlerbund. In 1898, he received the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown, which entitled him to use the noble &quot;von&quot; in his name.

He died on 14 July 1920 in Munich. He and his wife Irene are interred at the Alter Südfriedhof there.

<text>The Akha are an ethnic group who live in small villages at higher elevations in the mountains of Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Yunnan Province in China. They made their way from China into Southeast Asia during the early 20th century. Civil war in Burma and Laos resulted in an increased flow of Akha immigrants and there are now 80,000 people living in Thailand&#x27;s northern provinces of Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai.

The Akha speak Akha, a language in the Loloish (Yi) branch of the Tibeto-Burman family. The Akha language is closely related to Lisu and it is thought that it was the Akha who once ruled the Baoshan and Tengchong plains in Yunnan before the invasion of the Ming Dynasty in 1644.

== Origins ==

Scholars agree with the Akha that they originated in China; they disagree, however, about whether the original homeland was the Tibetan borderlands, as the Akha claim, or farther south and east in Yunnan Province, the northernmost residence of present-day Akha. The historically documented existence of relations with the Shan prince of Kengtung indicates that Akha were in eastern Burma as early as the 1860s. They first entered Thailand from Burma at the turn of the 20th-century, many having fled the decades-long civil war in Burma.

== Population distribution and indigenous status ==

Akha live in villages in the mountains of southwest China, eastern Myanmar, western Laos, northwestern Vietnam, and northern Thailand. In all these countries they are an ethnic minority. The population of the Akha today is roughly 400,000. A decline in village size in Thailand since the 1930s has been noted and attributed to the deteriorating ecological and economic situation in the mountains.

The Akha are often classified by the Chinese government as part of the Hani, an official national minority. The Akha are closely related to the Hani, but consider themselves a distinct group and often resist being subsumed under that identity. In Thailand, they are classified as one of the six hill tribes, a term used for all of the various tribal peoples who migrated from China and Tibet over the past few centuries and who now inhabit the dense forests on the borders between Thailand, Laos, and Burma. Few Akha in Thailand are citizens and most are registered as aliens. There is an oft cited lack of political or state infrastructure to address Akha, or any other indigenous issues in Thailand.

The Akha are not always treated or addressed as equals by the people whose countries they now inhabit. Speakers of Tai languages in Myanmar and Thailand refer to them as &quot;gaw&quot; or &quot;ekaw&quot; (ikaw/ikho), terms which the Akha view as derogatory. In Laos the colloquial term used by Tai speakers to refer to the Akha is &quot;kho&quot; (ko), often prefaced by the word &quot;kha&quot;, which in the past was used to refer to all upland (typically Mon-Khmer) groups.

== Language ==

Called &quot;Avkavdawv,&quot; meaning &quot;Akha language,&quot; by its native speakers, Akha is a tonal language in the Lolo/Yi branch of the Sino-Tibetan family. The vast majority of Akha speakers can understand the &quot;jeu g’oe&quot; (&quot;jer way&quot;) dialect spoken in southern China, Thailand, and Myanmar. Some basic and systematic variations in regional dialects of Akha are discussed by Paul Lewis in his &quot;Akha-English-Thai Dictionary&quot;. Very few dialects of Akha do not share mutual intelligibility. The Akha have no written language, but there are several competing scripts that have been written by missionaries and other foreigners.

== Akha villages and culture ==

Due to rapid social and economic changes in the regions the Akha inhabit, particularly the introduction of Western modes of capitalism, attempts to continue many of the traditional aspects of Akha life are increasingly difficult. Despite these challenges, Akha people practice many elements of their traditional culture with much success.

Akha society lacks a strict system of social class and is considered egalitarian. Respect is typically accorded with age and experience. Ties of patrilineal kinship and marriage alliance bind the Akha within and between communities. Village structures may vary widely from the strictly traditional to Westernized, depending on their proximity to modern towns. Like many of the hill tribes, the Akha build their villages at higher elevations in the mountains.

Akha dwellings are traditionally constructed of logs, bamboo, and thatch and are of two types: &quot;low houses&quot;, built on the ground, and &quot;high houses&quot;, built on stilts. The semi-nomadic Akha, at least those who have not been moved to permanent village sites, typically do not build their houses as permanent residences and will often move their villages. Some say that this gives the dwellings a deceptively fragile and flimsy appearance, although they are quite well-built as proved over generations.

Entrances to all Akha villages are fitted with a wooden gate adorned with elaborate carvings on both sides depicting imagery of men and women. It is known as a &quot;spirit gate&quot;. It marks the division between the inside of the village, the domain of man and domesticated animals, and the outside, the realm of spirits and wildlife. The gates function to ward off evil spirits and to entice favorable ones. Carvings can be seen on the roofs of the villager&#x27;s houses as a second measure to control the flow of spirits.

Houses are segregated by gender, with specific areas for men as well as a common space. This divide is said to mimic the function of the gate. Another important feature found in most Akha villages is a tall four-posted village swing which is used in an annual ancestor offering related to the fertility of rice. The swing is built annually by an elder called a &quot;dzoeuh mah&quot;.
=== Traditional economy ===

The traditional form of subsistence for the Akha people has been, and remains, agriculture. The Akha grow a variety of crops including soybeans and vegetables. Rice is the most significant crop and is prominent in much of Akha culture and ritual. Most Akha plant dry-land rice, which depends solely on rainfall for moisture, but in some villages irrigation has been built to water paddy fields. Historically, some Akha villages cultivated opium, but production diminished after the Thai government banned its cultivation.

The Akha have traditionally employed slash-and-burn agriculture, in which new fields are cleared by burning or cutting down forests and woodlands. In such a system, there is usually no market for land. Rights to land are considered traditional and established over many generations. This type of agriculture has contributed to the Akha&#x27;s semi-nomadic status as villages move to clear new farmland with each successive burn cycle. The Thai government has forbidden this practice, citing its detrimental effects on the environment. The Akha have adapted to new types of subsistence farming, but the quality of their land has suffered as they are no longer allowed to expand onto new plots. In many cases, chemical fertilizers are the only option for re-fertilizing the land.

In addition to their agricultural work, the Akha raise livestock including pigs, chickens, ducks, goats, cattle, and water buffalo to supplement their diets and to use for their secondary products. Children usually herd the animals. Akha women gather plants from the surrounding forests as well as eggs and insects the Akha will occasionally eat or use for medicinal purposes. The women and the men will often fish in the local lakes and streams. Some villages construct bee gums with the hope that a colony will nest there and their honey subsequently harvested.

The Akha are skilled hunters. Hunting is a male activity and a very popular one. It is a favorite pastime and a means of obtaining food. The barking deer is, perhaps, their favorite prey. Guns obtained from trading in the larger towns have begun to replace the use of crossbows in hunting.

===Belief system===

Akha religion—&quot;zahv&quot;—is often described as a mixture of animism and ancestor worship that emphasizes the Akha connection with the land and their place in the natural world and cycles. Although Akha beliefs and rituals involve all of these elements, the Akha often reject the casual categorization of their practices as such saying it simplifies and reduces its meaning. The Akha way emphasizes rituals in everyday life and stresses strong family ties. Akha ethnicity is closely tied to the Akha religion. It might be said that to be considered an Akha ethnically by other Akhas is to practice the Akha religion.

The annual ritual cycle consists of nine or twelve ancestor offerings, rice rituals, and other rites such as the building of the village gates. Many Akha rituals and festivals serve to seek &quot;blessings&quot; (&quot;guivlahav&quot;) from ancestors, which are according to the &quot;Encyclopedia of World Cultures&quot;, &quot;...fertility and health in people, rice, and domesticated animals.&quot; Akha beliefs are passed down through generations by oral recantation. The Akha believe that the being who created earth and life gave Akha the &quot;Akha Zang&quot; (Akha Way), their guidelines for life. Akhas believe that spirits and people were born of the same mother and lived together until a quarrel led to their separation, upon which spirits went into the forest and people remained in the villages. Since then, Akha believe that the spirits have caused illness and other unwelcome disruptions of human life. The Akha year is divided into the peoples&#x27; season (dry) and the spirits&#x27; season (wet). During the latter, spirits wander into the village, so they must be driven out as part of a yearly ancestor offering. Both people and rice are considered to have souls, the flight of which causes disease.

The most important and revered position in Akha spiritual matters is given to a village leader, whose ritual responsibilities include initiating the annual rebuilding of the village gates and the swing as well as advising and instructing villagers on important matters and settling disputes. Akha villages have an expert in ironworks called the &quot;pa jee&quot; who is considered of great significance in the village and who holds the second most important position within the society.
Perhaps the most important festival of the year is commonly known as the Swing Festival. The four-day Akha Swing Festival comes in late-August each year and falls on the 120th day after the village has planted its rice. The Akha call the Swing Festival, &quot;Yehkuja&quot;, which translates as &quot;eating bitter rice&quot;, a phrase which references the previous year&#x27;s dwindling rice supply incorporates the hope that monsoons will soon water the new crop. Festival activities include ritual offerings to family ancestral spirits at the ancestral altar in a corner of the women&#x27;s side of the house. Offerings consist of bits of cooked food, water, and rice whiskey. The swing festival is particularly important for Akha women, who will display the clothing they spent all year making and who will show, through ornamentation, that they are becoming older and of marriageable age. Because the women dress up in their best traditional clothing and ornaments and perform traditional dances and songs for the villagers, the Swing Festival is also known as Women&#x27;s New Year. The traditional New Year which falls in late-December is known as Men&#x27;s New Year.

The Akha put a heavy emphasis on genealogy. An important tradition involves the recounting by Akha males of their patrilineal genealogy. During the most important ceremonies the list is recited in its entirety back over 50 generations to the first Akha, Sm Mi O. It is said that all Akha males should be able to do so. The recounting of this lineage plays a role in the incest taboo: If a male and female Akha find a common male ancestor within their last six generations, they are not allowed to marry.

The Akha have several sets of rules governing matters on life, death, marriage, and birth. Akha traditionally marry in their teens or early twenties. Polygamy is permitted. Marriages may be village endogamous or exogamous. Wife-giving and -taking relationships are central to Akha society, with wife-givers superior to wife-takers.

Twins are considered an extremely ominous occurrence, one where spirits are considered to interfere with human matters. The Akha believed that only animals could give birth to more than one offspring and therefore considered twins as beasts. Up until about 20 years or so ago, they would have been killed immediately. According to Laos locals, the practice is still common although the government is trying to discourage it. Akha men whose wives had given birth to twins would not be allowed to participate on the hunt for a specific period.

Certain types of death, like that caused by a tiger, are considered particularly bad; the bodies must be treated and buried in specific ways.

Missionaries have been active among Akha, especially since the mid-20th century. Some Akha Christians live in separate Christian villages supported by missionary funds. Although many Akha people may be considered converts by the missionaries, nearly 100% practice some mixture of Christianity and traditional Akha beliefs.

=== Dress ===
The Akha people are often noted for their very recognizable sartorial practices. Akha women spin cotton into thread with a hand spindle and weave it on a foot-treadle loom. The cloth is hand dyed with indigo. Women wear broad leggings, a short black skirt with a white beaded sporran, a loose fitting black jacket with heavily embroidered cuffs and lapels. Akha women are known for their embroidery skills. While traditional clothes are typically worn for special ceremonies, one is more likely to see Akha villagers in full traditional garb in areas that have heavy volumes of tourists, particularly in Thailand.

The headdresses worn by the women are perhaps the most spectacular and elaborate items of Akha dress. Akha women define their age or marital status with the style of headdress worn. At roughly age 12, the Akha female exchanges her child&#x27;s cap for that of a girl. A few years later she will begin to don the &quot;jejaw&quot;, the beaded sash that hangs down the front of her skirt and keeps it from flying up in the breeze. During mid-adolescence she will start wearing the adult woman&#x27;s headdress. Headdresses are decorated by their owner and each is unique. Silver coins, monkey fur, and dyed chicken feathers are just a few of the things that might decorate the headdress. The headdresses differ by subgroup. According to an article about the variations in Akha headdress, &quot;High Fashion, Hill Style&quot;, the

&quot;Ulo Akha headdress consists of a bamboo cone, covered in beads, silver studs and seeds, edged in coins (silver rupees for the rich, baht for the poor) topped by several dangling chicken feather tassels and maybe a woolen pom-pom. The Pamee Akha wear a trapezoidal colt cap covered in silver studs with coins on the beaded side flaps and long chains of linked silver rings hanging down each side. The Lomi Akha wear a round cap covered in silver studs and framed by silver balls, coins and pendants and the married women attach a trapezoidal inscribed plate at the back.&quot;
===Cuisine===
The main staple of Akha cuisine is highland rice. Besides raising cattle, pigs and chickens, and growing crops such as rice, corn, a variety of vegetables, chilies and herbs, part of their ingredients comes from the forest, either gathered or hunted.
== Economy ==

Although primarily subsistence farmers, the Akha have long been involved in cash cropping and trade. In the last century, cotton and opium poppies were the principal cash crops. More recent cash crops are chilies, soybeans, cabbages, and tomatoes. One or more families in a village may operate a small shop in their home selling items such as items as cigarettes and kerosene. Itinerant traders, either lowlanders or hill-dwelling Yunnan Chinese, come to buy livestock or cash crops, or to sell blankets and other goods.

==Contemporary issues==

Being an ethnic minority with little easily accessible legal recourse, Akha everywhere have long been subject to rights abuses.

Perhaps the most important issue facing the Akha pertains to their land. The Akha relationship to land is vitally connected to the continuation of the Akha culture, but they rarely have &quot;official&quot; or state-sanctioned land rights or claims to their land as land rights are considered traditional. These conceptions of land are at odds with those held by the nation states whose land the Akha now occupy. Most Akha are not full-fledged citizens of the country they inhabit and are thus not allowed to legally purchase land, although most Akha villagers are too poor to even consider purchasing land.

It has been reported by rights groups that several land seizures of Akha land have been undertaken in the name of the Queen of Thailand. Originally a semi-nomadic people, the Akha are often relocated by the presiding national government to permanent villages, after which the government allegedly sells to logging companies and other private corporations access to lands formerly occupied by the Akha. The land onto which the Akha are displaced is almost always less fertile than their previous plots. On their new lands, the Akha can rarely produce enough food to sustain themselves and are often forced to leave and seek employment outside the villages, thus disrupting their traditional culture and economy.

In Thailand, laws have been passed that regulate forest usage in a way that impacts the traditional Akha lifestyle, including the 2007 Community Forest Act. The Asia-Pacific Human Rights Information Center, a Japanese group involved in indigenous peoples rights, wrote:
&quot;These laws and resolutions have had severe impacts on indigenous peoples&#x27; rights to residence and land. Under these laws and resolutions millions of hectares of land have been declared as reserved and conservation forests, or protected areas. Today, 28.78% of Thailand is categorized as protected areas. As a result, thousands of farmers previously living in the forest or relying on the forest for their livelihood have been arrested and imprisoned and their lands seized. Cases have been filed against them for the so-called encroachment on government land.&quot;

The reasons given for Akha relocations vary, but a common response on the part of the Thai government is to cite a concern for the preservation of forests and the promotion of more sustainable agricultural techniques than the slash and burn agriculture traditionally used by the Akha. The Thai government&#x27;s involvement in relocation might also possibly be motivated by concerns of national security. According to international human rights lawyer Jonathan Levy,
&quot;The Akha are identified with the opium growers who until recently dominated that portion of the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; in Thailand. Thailand has taken steps to eradicate opium cultivation by resettling the Akha into permanent villages. However, both opium and long ingrained farming techniques are key to the complex Akha culture. While traditional opium cultivation has been suppressed, processed heroine and latest scourge, methamphetamine, is freely available from Burma. Thus Akha have become both impoverished farmers and in many cases narcotic addicts. As the Akha are resettled they come into contact with mainstream Thai culture, many Akha women are drawn to the &quot;easy&quot; money of the sex industry.&quot;

The Akha are said to have the highest rates of addiction of all the hill tribes and are at the highest risk for contracting HIV/AIDS or other STDs. Measures have been undertaken by state and human rights organizations including the UNESCO Asia Pacific Regional Bureau for Education in Bangkok, and NCA in Lao PDR, to provide hill tribes, including the Akha, with &quot;comprehensive community-based, non-formal education&quot; on HIV and drug abuse prevention. In addition, detoxification clinics have been opened in the region, with particularly positive consequences for women who tend to have lower rates of addiction, but often bear the brunt of compensating for their missing partners financially and emotionally.

Despite their numbers, the Akha are the poorest of all the hill tribes. As roads bring accessibility and tourists, they provide relief from the poverty of village life, especially for the younger generations who increasingly find themselves engaged in labor outside the villages. Many villages report a population decrease as many leave to find work in the cities, often for very long periods. Many Akha complain that the younger generations are becoming increasingly less interested in traditional culture and ways and more and more susceptible to outside, mainstream, cultural influences. According to one author, where the village squares were once &quot;filled with the sounds of courtship songs&quot;, radios are now more likely to play pop hits.

<text>Benedict James Kay MBE (born 14 December 1975) is an English retired international rugby union footballer who played second row forward for Leicester Tigers, and the British &amp; Irish Lions.

==Background==
Kay was born in Liverpool, the only son of Lord Justice of Appeal Sir John William Kay (1943–2004), His sister, Dame Amanda Yip, is also a judge. His father&#x27;s vocation later earned Ben the nickname &quot;M&#x27;lud&quot;. Kay first started playing rugby for Waterloo minis going on to play for the Waterloo first team.

Kay played for his school (Merchant Taylors&#x27; Boys&#x27; School, Crosby) and has also played for Queensland University. He represented England in the 1996 Students World Cup in South Africa and at U18, U19 and U21 level. He attended Loughborough University, where he obtained a degree in Sports Science.

==Career==

Kay joined Leicester Tigers from Waterloo in 1999 and first played during the World Cup, with Tigers&#x27; normal Second rows Martin Johnson and Fritz van Heerden away with England and respectively. With the help of Johnson and van Heerden, he developed his game, becoming a highly rated middle line-out jumper, like van Heerden. He was a member of Tigers&#x27; Heineken Cup winning sides in 2001 and 2002 as his international career blossomed.

Having made his England A debut against France A in Blagnac in 2000 Kay led England A to a 23–22 win over France A at Redruth in April 2001, and was called up for England&#x27;s successful tour of North America and Japan that summer. He made his England debut against Canada on 2 June 2001 displacing Danny Grewcock from the England side.

After another outstanding season he was named as the Tigers Members&#x27; Player of the Year 2001/2, and was a nominee for the Zurich Premiership Player of the Year. He was in the starting line-up for all the Six Nations games in 2002, and scored a try against Ireland. After touring with England to Argentina in the summer of 2002, where he scored his second try, Kay went on to compete in both the Autumn internationals and the Six Nations, before touring to New Zealand and Australia in June 2003.

Kay confirmed his status as a core part of the England squad in the World Cup when he played every minute of every England game except the game against Uruguay. His line-out skills came to the fore here, particularly during the games against South Africa, when Kay learned to count in Afrikaans to crack the Springboks&#x27; line-out codes. During the final against Australia, Kay famously knocked-on (dropped the ball forwards) in a try-scoring position when a try would have almost certainly meant an England win. England won regardless, partly as a result of Tigers&#x27; teammate Lewis Moody winning a line-out Kay himself had called.

Sir Clive Woodward selected him for the 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. Kay came off the bench against Argentina in an official Test prior to the tour. Kay started in the first Test of the series.

He was the only player to play every minute of England&#x27;s 2007 Rugby World Cup campaign culminating in their narrow loss in the Final. He was one of only four players to have started both the 2003 and 2007 RWC Finals, the other three being Jonny Wilkinson, Jason Robinson and Phil Vickery.

Kay helped Leicester win the Premiership in 2007, starting the final as they defeated Gloucester. He was a used replacement in every game of the 2008 Six Nations.

Kay started both the 2008–09 Heineken Cup final and the Guinness Premiership win the same season. The Tigers won back-to-back Premiership titles the following season, in the 2009–10 Guinness Premiership, by beating Saracens 33–27 at Twickenham, though Kay did not feature in that game. He decided to retire at the end of the 2009–10 season after 11 years with Leicester Tigers. He has since worked as a commentator for ESPN and BT Sport.

He also served as non-executive director on Leicester Tigers&#x27; board of directors between 2014 and 2021.

==Personal life==
Kay is a supporter of Liverpool FC.

In 2002, Kay married long-time girlfriend Virginia, a physiotherapist, and they have two children. His long time Leicester Tigers and England teammate Martin Johnson was an usher at his wedding.

Kay paid his respects to his former sports teacher at Merchant Taylors, Ian &#x27;Robbo&#x27; Robinson, who died in a white water rafting incident whilst on a rugby tour with the school.

<doc id="752921" wikidata="Q918570" url="?curid=752921" title="British humour">
<text>British humour carries a strong element of satire aimed at the absurdity of everyday life. Common themes include sarcasm, tongue-in-cheek, banter, insults, self-deprecation, taboo subjects, puns, innuendo, wit, and the British class system. These are often accompanied by a deadpan delivery which is present throughout the British sense of humour. It may be used to bury emotions in a way that seems unkind in the eyes of other cultures. Jokes are told about everything and almost no subject is off-limits, though a lack of subtlety when discussing controversial issues is sometimes considered insensitive. Many British comedy series have become successful internationally, serving as a representation of British culture to overseas audiences.

==Themes==
Some themes (with examples) that underpinned late-20th-century British humour were:

=== Innuendo ===
Innuendo in British humour is evident in the literature as far back as &quot;Beowulf&quot; and Chaucer, and it is a prevalent theme in many British folk songs. Shakespeare often used innuendo in his comedies, but it is also often found in his other plays. One example in &quot;Hamlet&quot; act 4 scene v reads:

&quot;Young men will do&#x27;t if they come to&#x27;t&quot; / &quot;By Cock, they are to blame.&quot;

Restoration comedy is notorious both for its innuendo and for its sexual explicitness, a quality encouraged by Charles II (1660–1685) personally and by the rakish aristocratic ethos of his court.

In the Victorian era, Burlesque theatre combined sexuality and humour in its acts. In the late 19th century, magazines such as &quot;Punch&quot; began to be widely sold, and innuendo featured in its cartoons and articles.
In the early 1930s, cartoon-style saucy postcards (such as those drawn by Donald McGill) became widespread; at their peak, 16 million saucy postcards were sold per year. They were often bawdy, with innuendo and double entendres, and featured stereotypical characters such as vicars, large ladies and put-upon husbands, in the same vein as the &quot;Carry On&quot; films. This style of comedy was common in music halls and in the comedy music of George Formby. Many comedians from music hall and wartime gang shows worked in radio after World War 2, and characters such as Julian and Sandy on &quot;Round the Horne&quot; used innuendo extensively. Innuendo also features heavily in many British films and TV series of the late 20th century. The &quot;Carry On&quot; series was based largely on smut and innuendo, and many of the sketches of &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; are in a similar vein. Innuendo with little subtlety was epitomised by Benny Hill, and the Nudge Nudge sketch by Monty Python openly mocks the absurdity of such innuendo.

By the end of the 20th century, more subtlety in sexual humour became fashionable, as in &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and &quot;Blackadder&quot;, while &quot;Bottom&quot; and &quot;Viz&quot; continued the smuttier trend. In contemporary British comedy, Julian Clary is an example of a prolific user of innuendo. Innuendo has become a celebrated part of &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot; TV cookery show.

===Race and regional stereotypes===

The An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman joke format is one common to many cultures, and is often used in English, including having the nationalities switched around to take advantage of other stereotypes. These stereotypes are somewhat fond, and these jokes would not be taken as xenophobic (by the Englishman telling them). This sort of affectionate stereotype is also exemplified by &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;, a programme that, although set in France in the Second World War, and deliberately performed in over-the-top accents, mocked British stereotypes as well as foreigners. This also applies to a lot of the regional stereotypes in the UK. Regional accent and dialect are used in such programmes as &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot; and &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, as these accents provide quick characterisation and social cues.

Although racism was a part of British humour, it is now frowned upon, and acts such as Bernard Manning and Jim Davidson are pilloried. Although some observers once argued certain comedy series of the 1970s were targeting racism rather than being in sympathy with it, such series as &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot; and &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot; are no longer considered acceptable for repeat screenings. Along with the first of these two series, &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; was an attempt to deal humorously with the influx of immigrants to the United Kingdom, but it is now usually considered to have been counter-productive. Still much admired, however, &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; featured the mistreatment of the Spanish waiter, Manuel, but the target was the bigotry of the lead character, Basil Fawlty. &quot;The Young Ones&quot; featured a police officer (in sunglasses) engaged in racial profiling, only to discover the man was white and wearing dark gloves. Later, &quot;The Fast Show&quot; has mocked people of other races, such as the Chanel 9 sketches, and &quot;Banzai&quot; has mimicked Japanese game shows, which have an exaggerated sense of violence, sex and public absurdity. &quot;Goodness Gracious Me&quot; turned stereotypes on their heads in sketches such as &#x27;Going for an English&#x27; and when bargaining over the price of a newspaper. An episode from &quot;The Goodies&quot; depicted all of the black population of South Africa leaving to escape apartheid, leaving the Afrikaners with nobody to oppress – instead, they begin a system of discrimination based on height, targeting short people, labelled &quot;apart-height&quot;.

===Bullying and harsh sarcasm===
Harsh sarcasm and bullying, though with the bully usually coming off worse than the victim – typified by:
*&quot;On the Buses&quot;, Arthur toward his wife, Olive, and Jack and Stan towards their boss Blakey
*&quot;Blackadder&quot;, Edmund Blackadder toward his sidekick, Baldrick
*&quot;The Young Ones&quot;, comedy TV series
*&quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, Basil Fawlty toward his waiter, Manuel
*&quot;The New Statesman&quot;, satirising a domineering Conservative Member of Parliament
*&quot;The Thick of It&quot;, satirising the spin culture prevalent in Tony Blair&#x27;s heyday
*&quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;, satirical music-based panel show
*&quot;Mock The Week&quot;, satirical news-based panel show
*&quot;Black Books&quot;, where Bernard Black attacks his assistant, Manny
*&quot;Bottom&quot;, in which Richie attacks Eddie with little or no provocation, usually resulting in Eddie violently (often near-fatally) retaliating.
*&quot;The Ricky Gervais Show&quot;, Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais mocking Karl Pilkington&#x27;s unique outlook on life.

===Parodies of stereotypes===

Making fun of British stereotypes, typified by:

*&quot;Monty Python&quot;
*&quot;Hale and Pace&quot;
*&quot;Ali G&quot;
*&quot;Citizen Khan&quot;, a sitcom about a British Asian family in Birmingham.

===Tolerance of, and affection for, the eccentric===

*Heath Robinson cartoons
*&quot;Professor Branestawm&quot; books
*&quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot; animations

*&quot;A Bit of Fry and Laurie&quot;, sketch show written by and starring Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie noted for its eccentric and inventive use of language
*&quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;, a sitcom in which Dawn French plays a female vicar whose parishioners are archetypically eccentric and mad
*&quot;QI&quot; or &quot;Quite Interesting&quot;, a panel game where points are given for being quite interesting and points are taken away for common misconceptions
*&quot;The Fast Show&quot;, notably Rowley Birkin QC sketch

===Pranks and practical jokes===
Usually, for television, the performance of a practical joke on an unsuspecting person whilst being covertly filmed, epitomised by:
*&quot;Candid Camera&quot;
*&quot;Beadle&#x27;s About&quot;
*&quot;Game for a Laugh&quot;
*&quot;Trigger Happy TV&quot;
*&quot;Balls of Steel&quot;

<doc id="752930" wikidata="Q1025604" url="?curid=752930" title="Maghera">
<text>Maghera ( ; ) is a small town at the foot of the Glenshane Pass in Northern Ireland. Its population was 4,235 in the 2021 census. Formerly in the barony of Loughinsholin within the historic County Londonderry, it is today in the local-government district of Mid-Ulster.

==History==
The town dates back at least to the 6th century to the monastery founded by Saint Lurach whose family were possibly evangelised by Saint Patrick. The &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; say that the seat of the Cenél nEoghain was at Ráth Luraig in Maghera. Standing upon the site of the monastery, the present day ruins of St. Lurach&#x27;s Church date back to the 10th century. They include, over a doorway, a relief of the crucifixion, possibly the oldest in Ireland. The crucification lintel is reproduced in the contemporary Catholic church, St Mary&#x27;s.

The old church and town were burned in the 12th century. Afterwards, Maghera became the seat of the Bishopric of Cinél nEógain with a cathedral church. In 1246 its bishop, Germanus O&#x27;Carolan (Gilla in Choimded Ó Cerbailláin), pleading the remoteness of Maghera, obtained sanction from Pope Innocent IV to have the see transferred to Derry.

As a result of the Plantation of Ulster and of the Rebellion of 1641 which drove out many of the first English families, Maghera and district attracted Scottish settlers. They came into conflict not only with the dispossessed Irish, but as tenants and as Presbyterians also with the land-owning, Church of Ireland, Ascendancy. A result was large-scale emigration to the American colonies (Charles Thomson, recording himself as from Maghera, signed the Declaration of Independence) and, in the 1790s, the organising of the United Irishmen.

Despairing of reform, and determined to make common cause with their Catholic neighbours, on 7 June 1798 the United Irishmen mustered upwards of 5,000 men in Maghera. But the poorly armed host broke up the following morning on news of the rebel defeat at Antrim and the approach of government troops. A Presbyterian church elder, Watty Graham, was executed for his part, and his head was paraded through the town. His minister, John Glendy, was forced into American exile.

On 12 July 1830, Orange Order and Ribbonmen clashed over demonstrations the Orange Order held in Maghera and Castledawson. Several Catholic homes were burnt by Protestants in the aftermath. Some repair of sectarian relations was achieved by an active tenant right movement, but with tenant purchase of land facilitated by the Land Acts by the end of the century the national question prevailed. Politically the town has remained split between nationalists, now in the majority, and unionists.

The Great Famine of the 1840s and the years that followed, resulted in a since unrecovered loss of population in the surrounding rural districts. In 2003 the Ancient Order of Hibernians erected a headstone to make the &quot;Famine Plot&quot; were local victims were buried.

In the early 20th century, the town itself was relatively prosperous. With its own railway station, an embroidery factory, a busy weekly market and close proximity to Clark&#x27;s linen mill in Upperlands, it was one of two major towns within Magherafelt Rural District. The town also benefited from post-war advances in education, housing and transport. Separate primary and secondary schools were built for Catholics and Protestants in the 1960s; new housing estates were constructed and motor cars forced a widening of many of the town&#x27;s narrow streets
Maghera suffered violence during the Troubles. Over the three decades from the end of the 1960s a total of 14 people were killed in or near the village Maghera, half of them members of the security forces and a further two as a result of family membership of the Ulster Defence Regiment. The Provisional Irish Republican Army were responsible for ten of the deaths. Two, including a Sinn Féin councillor, were killed by loyalist paramilitaries.

From what was possibly a low of 879 in 1910 Maghera population has risen in the course of a century to a census figure in 2011 of 4,220. Reflecting European Union employment in local food processing, 213 residents in 2011 did not have English as a first language.

==Governance==
The village was administered by Londonderry County Council from 1899 until the abolition of county councils in Northern Ireland in 1973. Since 2011, the town is part of the Mid-Ulster District Council. It is located within the Carntogher district electoral area (DLE) which contains the areas Lower Glenshane, Swatragh, Tamlaght O&#x27;Crilly, Valley and Maghera. In the 2015 district elections, Carntogher DLE elected three Sinn Féin, one SDLP and one DUP representatives to the council.

==Churches==
* Old St Lurach&#x27;s Church, a church dating to the 10th century which has one of the oldest depictions of the crucifixion in Ireland.

<text>Aleksandr Ilyich Ulyanov (; – ) was a Russian revolutionary and political activist who was executed for planning an assassination against Alexander III of Russia. He was the elder brother of Vladimir Lenin, the founder of the Soviet Union.

== Early life ==
Ulyanov was born in Nizhny Novgorod, the second child and eldest son of schoolteachers Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov and Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova. He was often referred to as Sasha, a common diminutive form of the name Aleksandr. Through his father, Ulyanov was a member of the Russian nobility.

He graduated with honors from the Classical Gymnasium of Simbirsk in 1883 and later attended Saint Petersburg Imperial University, where he majored in Natural Sciences and earned a degree in zoology. While at university, he participated in illegal meetings and demonstrations, often handing out pamphlets and making speeches to students and workers.

== Revolutionary ==
In 1886 Ulyanov became a member of the &quot;terrorist faction&quot;, which was part of the Narodnaya Volya (&quot;People&#x27;s Will&quot;) party. He was one of the authors of the party&#x27;s program. Acknowledging the working class as the &quot;nucleus of the Socialist Party&quot;, the program affirmed the revolutionary&#x27;s initiative of fighting autocracy through terrorism.

=== Attempted assassination of Alexander III===
Ulyanov and his comrades conspired to assassinate Alexander III of Russia. On 1 March 1887 (Julian calendar), the day of the sixth anniversary of Alexander II&#x27;s murder, three party members were arrested in the Nevsky Prospekt carrying handmade bombs filled with dynamite and lead pellets poisoned with strychnine. Police suspected that when Alexander III visited church on the anniversary of his father&#x27;s assassination, the plotters would throw bombs into the Emperor&#x27;s carriage. The attempt is known as &quot;The Second First of March&quot;.

Ulyanov, who served as both the main ideologist of the group as well as the bomb-maker, was later arrested. In court Ulyanov gave a political speech. The conspirators were initially sentenced to death; all but five were then pardoned by Alexander III. Ulyanov was not among those pardoned. On 8 May, he and his four comrades – Pakhomy Andreyushkin, Vasily Generalov, Vasili Osipanov, and Petr Shevyrev – were hanged at Shlisselburg.

Aleksandr&#x27;s execution drove his younger brother Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (later known as Vladimir Lenin) into fervent political activity. Before Aleksandr&#x27;s arrest, Lenin and the family had not known of Aleksander&#x27;s activism and were comfortably middle class and essentially apolitical, holding no strong feelings for or against the Russian monarchy. Historian James D. White reported that Lenin&#x27;s introduction to radical politics came only after Aleksandr&#x27;s death in an attempt to understand the events: &quot;The actions of Lenin and Olga in the period following Sasha’s [Aleksandr&#x27;s nickname] execution suggest that they had resolved that their brother’s death would not be in vain and that they would serve the cause for which he had sacrificed himself – just as soon as they could discover what that cause had been.&quot;

Later in life, Lenin recalled thinking, &quot;No, my brother won&#x27;t make a revolutionary, I thought at the time. A revolutionary can&#x27;t give so much time to the study of worms.&quot; Lenin also remembered how his family were shunned by liberal circles in Simbirsk following his brother&#x27;s arrest. His sister Olga was denied a teaching position due to Aleksandr&#x27;s reputation.

==Legacy==

A minor planet, 2112 Ulyanov, was discovered in 1972 by Soviet astronomer Tamara Mikhailovna Smirnova and named after him.

<text>A project network diagram is a graph that displays the order in which a project’s activities are to be completed. Derived from the work breakdown structure, the terminal elements of a project are organized sequentially based on the relationship among them. It is typically drawn from left to right to reflect project chronology.

== Techniques ==

=== Activity-on-Node ===
The Activity-on-Node (AON) technique uses nodes to represent individual project activities and path arrows to designate the sequence of activity completion. Nodes are labelled using information pertaining to the activity. According to Project Management, nodes should at least display the following information:

* Identifier
* Descriptive label
* Activity duration
* Early start time
* Early finish time
* Late start time
* Late finish time
* Activity float (slack)

Start and finish times are used to determine the critical path of a project. Activity float, or slack, time is used in project crashing.

== Other techniques ==
The condition for a valid project network is that it doesn&#x27;t contain any circular references.

Project dependencies can also be depicted by a predecessor table. Although such a form is very inconvenient for human analysis, project management software often offers such a view for data entry.

An alternative way of showing and analyzing the sequence of project work is the design structure matrix or dependency structure matrix.

<text>Tyrus Richard Treadway (born February 11, 1967) is an American game show host, actor, and talk show host. Treadway co-hosted &quot;Soap Talk&quot; with Lisa Rinna.

==Biography==
Ty was born and raised in Trenton, New Jersey, to Richard and Mary Lou Treadway. Ty was the youngest of six siblings.

After high school, Ty received a scholarship for soccer and attended a couple of colleges before graduating with a degree in accounting. He went to work for the New Jersey Office of the State Auditor as an auditor and computer systems engineer but took part in bodybuilding competitions on the side. He eventually won the title of Mr. Natural Pennsylvania. He often had a &quot;Ty Training&quot; segment on his later talk show, &quot;Soap Talk&quot;.

However, Ty found his job boring and depressing so he decided to start modeling and acting. He appeared in several magazines, theater productions, and commercials.

In May 2000, Ty landed the role of Dr. Colin MacIver on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. His character was killed off after a year, but he returned as his nicer twin brother, Troy MacIver, (who eventually went insane) and appeared off and on from 2001 to 2004.

In June 2002, Ty pulled double duty as soap star and talk show host. He began co-hosting Soapnet&#x27;s &quot;Soap Talk&quot; with Lisa Rinna.

That year, he and his girlfriend Monica got engaged at the Eiffel Tower. They married in 2003, and their first child, a daughter named Samantha Raine, was born in February 2005. Their second child, a son named Ryder, was born March 7, 2006.

In March 2006, the series &quot;American Idol Extra&quot; debuted, featuring Treadway as host. Treadway interviewed various &quot;American Idol&quot; personalities, including producers, contestants, vocal coaches, and celebrity guests.

On April 30, 2007, Ty was chosen to host the game show &quot;Merv Griffin&#x27;s Crosswords&quot;, created by Merv Griffin.

In 2009, he and his family moved to Frisco, Texas.

In 2010, he was offered a recurring role as Dr. Ben Walters on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; that lasted from September to February 2011.

In 2012, he resumed his role as Troy MacIver for the final episodes of &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. He also had a short-lived stint as a co-host on &quot;Good Morning Texas,&quot; which airs throughout the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex on WFAA. Recently he has been a real estate agent.

==&quot;Soap Talk&quot;==
In 2002, the American cable network SOAPnet launch a soap opera talk show called &quot;Soap Talk&quot; and Treadway became a co-host along with Lisa Rinna. He and Rinna received a Daytime Emmy nomination for outstanding talk show host alongside such shows as &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;, &quot;The View&quot; and &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;. Ultimately, they lost to &quot;Wayne Brady&quot;. Further nominations occurred in 2005 and 2006.

In 2004, Treadway and Rinna hosted a TV special that pre-empted &quot;The View&quot; for one day during the 2004 Summer Olympics called &quot;SOAPnet Reveals ABC Soap Secrets&quot;. This special gave scoops about what was going to happen in the near future on &quot;All My Children&quot;, &quot;General Hospital&quot;, and &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. ABC commissioned this special in an attempt to keep its daytime Nielsen ratings up during the Olympic season. Statistically soap operas lose ten percent of their viewership in Olympic years.

&quot;Soap Talk&quot; was canceled in 2006 but returned periodically for specials.

<doc id="752945" wikidata="Q7639050" url="?curid=752945" title="Suncoast Community High School">
<text>Suncoast Community High School (abbreviated SHS) is a public magnet high school (grades 9–12) in Riviera Beach, Florida. The school&#x27;s campus was built in 1955 as Riviera Beach High School. It was desegregated in the 1960s and renamed in 1970. It became a magnet school in 1989 and has selective admissions.

Suncoast Community High School&#x27;s students belong to one or more of the school&#x27;s four magnet programs: Math, Science, and Engineering (MSE), Computer Science (CS), International Baccalaureate (IB), or Innovative Interactive Technology (IIT). The school&#x27;s teams compete as the Chargers.

==History==
The school campus was built in 1955 as Riviera Beach High School. During the 1950s and 1960s, Riviera Beach High School was known for both its academics and its athletics. The Riviera Beach High Hornets were particularly strong in men&#x27;s basketball, with games against rival Palm Beach High School routinely drawing packed crowds.

===Conversion to a magnet school===
Suncoast was the target of an investigation beginning June 2, 1987 by the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s Office for Civil Rights. The investigation began after parents complained in a letter-writing campaign to state and federal officials that the School Board and then-Superintendent Tom Mills allegedly allowed Suncoast and John F. Kennedy Junior High to become segregated black schools, allowing enrollment to decline and facilities to become run down. Two years earlier Mills had proposed busing white students from southern Jupiter to integrate Suncoast, but Jupiter parents opposed the plan and it was dropped.

In 1989 Suncoast, along with Atlantic High in Delray Beach and S.D. Spady Elementary School, became a magnet school. The institution of magnet programs was originally opposed by several black organizations and some teachers&#x27; unions. The principal at the time was Kay Carnes, who remained Suncoast&#x27;s principal for 15 years before stepping down at the end of the 2004 school year.

Suncoast students and prospective students were required to apply in late spring, and minimum GPA and new dress code were adopted.

About 150 former Suncoast students left the school this year and moved to either Palm Beach Gardens or Jupiter High School (which the previous school year had enrollments of more than 2000 compared with Suncoast&#x27;s 666). About 350 Suncoast students stayed.

The introduction of the IB program greatly improved racial balance at the school; in this year of the introduction of the magnet program 71 percent of Suncoast&#x27;s students were black (despite improving its racial balance by 19.3 percent that year).

===New Campus===
By 2009 there was an escalating legal dispute between the school district and the city of Riviera Beach when the city government chose not to renew permits for the sewage and water services for the new facility. The city government stated it was doing this because the school district did not buy land needed to widen a road into the facility. The school district considered suing.

Starting in fall of the 2010-11 academic year, Suncoast Community High School moved to a new campus located at 1717 Avenue S. The campus cost the school district 80 million dollars. The new campus consists of five main buildings: the office, the gym, the cafeteria, the auditorium, and the main student building; an open court; as well as a new football field. The main building is three stories high.

==Academics==
Students apply to Suncoast via the Palm Beach County School District&#x27;s Magnet and Choice School Application Form. Applicants apply for a specific program or programs and are admitted into the school by a selective lottery after the top 10 percent of applicants (based upon Florida Standards Assessments (FSA) scores, teacher recommendations, and grades) are admitted. Additionally, students who complete the IB Middle Years Programme at an area middle school, such as John F. Kennedy Middle School, are automatically admitted.

==Programs==
=== Math, Science, &amp; Engineering ===

The Math, Science, and Engineering Program (MSE) concentrates on mathematics, science — particularly physics — and engineering. Physics courses taken are AP Physics 1, AP Physics 2, AP Physics C: Mechanics, AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism and, for MSE/IB students, IB Physics HL. Dual enrollment math courses taken are Calculus II/III, Discrete Mathematics, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations. Students in the MSE program may also elect to pursue the International Baccalaureate Diploma in their junior and senior years. This results in a major shift of coursework, including the requirement of 6 IB External Assessments, 4 IB Internal Assessments, and 2 IB Oral Assessments. The requirement of a foreign language extends from 2 years to all 4 years of high school, the requirement of IB Theory of Knowledge (TOK), IB Physics HL, and other requirements faced by IB track students.

MSE students complete a science fair project in their junior year, with some moving up to the state science fair and even the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF).

Students wishing to enter the MSE program are required to have a 3.0 GPA and math up to and including Algebra 2 Honors completed.

===International Baccalaureate Program===

The International Baccalaureate (IB) program was adopted for junior and senior years. Students must take &quot;MYP&quot; (Middle Years Programme) classes in their freshman and sophomore years. Foreign language is an IB requirement; Many students dual-enroll with Palm Beach Community College or Florida Atlantic University through the Palm Beach County School District&#x27;s Dual-Enrollment Program. Regardless of their program, all students participate in MYP classes, giving them the option of switching into IB classes their last two years of high school.

=== Computer Science ===

The Computer Science (CS) program is designed for students who wish to major in the fields of computer science or computer engineering. It aims to teach students skills essential to the aforementioned disciplines; skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking skills, and object oriented design. Core computer science courses include study in the areas of: database design, object-oriented programming, algorithms, data structures, abstraction, program analysis, graphical user interfaces, and applications of computer science to the real world. Through the program, students learn Java and T-SQL.

The computer science courses that CS students take are: Java Programming Essentials, AP Computer Science A, Java Database Programming, and Java Programming Capstone. Students have the opportunity to take the MTA Database Fundamentals certification exam in the Java Database Programming class.

Students wishing to enter the CS program are required to have a 3.0 GPA and Algebra 1 as well as Geometry Honors completed.

==== Comprehensive Coding Projects ====
In their senior year, CS students are required to complete a &quot;senior project&quot;.

The senior project requires seniors to work in teams of 3-5 on a project of their own personal choice; however, it must be of sufficient complexity. Prerequisite tasks required are the same as the junior project&#x27;s tasks. The senior project features Agile Scrum development model fully. As a result of this, the team must make burn down charts and evaluate their performance; modification of the remaining sprints may be necessary. At the end, the projects are presented to and judged by a panel consisting of members from the local industry, business, and educational community.

===Innovative Interactive Technology Program===
The new career focus of the Innovative Interactive Technology Program (IIT) is designed to feature three technology based pathways in areas of technology that are highly sought after in industry: Game, Simulation and Animation Programming, Commercial Digital Photography, and Drafting and Design Technology. Each of these pathways is designed to offer students a marketable skill set and a rigorous academic curriculum that is shared across all three pathways. Graduates from this program can choose to enter industry directly from high school or continue their studies at the college level.

===Shared Academics for Each Program===
While each program at Suncoast has its own special focus, some programs share the same focus in several areas. Each program offers their students to choose between MYP/Honors and AP social studies classes. Advanced Computer Science students (advanced in mathematics) share an almost-identical math lineup with the Math Science and Engineering program&#x27;s students. All students take AICE English General Paper in their freshman years, AP English Language and Composition as sophomores, and AP English Literature and Composition as Juniors, for their English classes. CS, MSE, and IIT students also have an option to take college-level British Literature Before/After 1800, offered by Palm Beach State College. Students in the MSE program who were accepted outside of the IB program also have the option to add it to their diploma beginning in their junior year.

==Awards and recognition==
&quot;U.S. News&quot; looked at the top 500 public high schools to identify the best in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education.

Suncoast moved to seventh from ninth on the 2011 High School Challenge rankings of American high schools. The national list, which has been compiled by education columnist Jay Mathews since 1998, takes the total number of Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and Advanced International Certificate of Education tests given at a school each year and divides it by the number of seniors who graduated in May or June. The Challenge Index formula is meant to serve not as a measure of the overall quality of a school, but of how effectively a school prepares its students for college, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; website.

The College Board named Suncoast the &quot;Exemplary AP Comparative Government and Politics&quot; program among schools with 1000 students or more, with the world&#x27;s largest percentage of mastery (passing) scores for that AP exam in 2005.

&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Suncoast as number 51 in its 2007 list of &quot;America&#x27;s Best High Schools,&quot; with a &quot;College Readiness&quot; score of 70.9 and &quot;Quality-adjusted Exams per Test Taker&quot; at 3.2. The &quot;U.S. News&quot; rankings were determined first by determined whether each school&#x27;s students performed better than statistically expected for the average student in their state (on reading and math test results for all students on state standardized tests), and then factoring in the percentage of economically disadvantaged students enrolled at the school to determine which schools performed better than statistically expected.

After this, the performance of black, Hispanic, and low-income students was analyzed to determine whether these groups were performing better than average for similar students in the state. The third step was a &quot;college readiness index&quot; that weighted the Advanced Placement (AP) participation rate: &quot;the number of 12th-grade students who took at least one AP test before or during their senior year, divided by the number of 12th graders, along with how well the students did on those AP tests or quality-adjusted AP participation (the number of 12th-grade students who took and passed (received an AP score of 3 or higher) at least one AP test before or during their senior year, divided by the number of 12th graders at that school). Quality-adjusted AP participation rates was weighted 75 percent and the simple AP participation rate was weighted 25 percent. Notably, however, 11 states and the District of Columbia were excluded from the rankings because of unavailable or insufficient 2005-2006 school-year state test data,
 and IB tests were not included.

&quot;Subs. Lunch&quot; is the percentage of students who qualify for federally-subsidized free or reduced lunch, an indicator of low-income students at the school.

&quot;E&amp;E&quot; is the &quot;Equity and Excellence&quot;, the &quot;Newsweek&quot; name for the percentage of all graduating seniors, who had at least one score of 3 or above on at least one AP test sometime in high school (including those who took an AP test but not an AP course).

In 2013, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; released its list of America&#x27;s best public high schools and ranked Suncoast 9th in the country.

<text>Jeffrey Marshall Foxworthy (born September 6, 1958) is an American comedian, actor, author, radio and television host, and writer. He is a member of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, with Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall, and formerly Ron White. Known for his &quot;You might be a redneck&quot; one-liners, Foxworthy has released six major-label comedy albums. His first two albums were each certified triple Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. He has written several books based on his redneck jokes, as well as an autobiography entitled &quot;No Shirt, No Shoes... No Problem!&quot;

Foxworthy has also made several ventures into television, starting in the mid-1990s with his own sitcom called &quot;The Jeff Foxworthy Show&quot;. He has also appeared alongside Engvall and Larry the Cable Guy in several Blue Collar television specials, including &quot;Blue Collar TV&quot; for The WB. In addition, he hosted the game shows &quot;Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?&quot; and &quot;The American Bible Challenge&quot;, as well as the radio program &quot;The Foxworthy Countdown&quot;.

==Early life==
Jeffrey Marshall Foxworthy was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on September 6, 1958, the first of three children of Carole Linda (&quot;née&quot; Camp) and IBM executive Jimmy Abstance Foxworthy. His parents were both of English descent, with his roots lying in the county of Essex. His grandfather, James Marvin Camp, was a Hapeville firefighter for over three decades. He has two younger siblings, Jay Foxworthy and Jennifer Foxworthy.

Foxworthy graduated from Hapeville High School. He attended Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, but left just before graduating. He worked for five years in mainframe computer maintenance at IBM, where his father also worked. At the urging of IBM co-workers, Foxworthy entered and won the Great Southeastern Laugh-off at Atlanta&#x27;s Punchline comedy club in 1984.

==Career==

===Comedy albums===
In 1993, he released &quot;You Might Be a Redneck If…&quot;, which topped the comedy albums chart and started the &quot;You Might Be a Redneck&quot; fad. The album went gold in 1994, platinum by 1995, and 3× platinum by 1996, which is more than three million copies.

Foxworthy&#x27;s July 1995 release &quot;Games Rednecks Play&quot; received a 1996 Grammy nomination for Best Spoken Comedy Album.

&quot;Totally Committed&quot; was released in May 1998. In conjunction with the album was a one-hour HBO stand-up special by the same name. The album reached &quot;gold&quot; status and received a 1999 Grammy Award nomination. The video for the &quot;Totally Committed&quot; song featured frequent references to then-Atlanta Braves pitcher, Greg Maddux as well as an appearance at the very end by Maddux himself (along with teammate John Smoltz).

In 2001, Foxworthy received a nomination for Best Spoken Comedy Album for the 43rd Annual Grammys.

===Television===
In 1995, Foxworthy starred in &quot;The Jeff Foxworthy Show&quot;, a sitcom created out of his stand-up comedy persona. It aired on ABC, but was canceled after one season. NBC subsequently picked up the show, but it was again canceled after one season. Later, he remarked that the network did not understand how to properly market his humor; thinking his routine was &quot;too Southern&quot; for a national network (&quot;Has anyone heard me talk?&quot;, he commented in one of his stand-up routines), they based the first season of his sitcom in Bloomington, Indiana. Later, the series aired on Nick at Nite and CMT in 2005 and 2006. He also appeared in Alan Jackson&#x27;s video for &quot;I Don&#x27;t Even Know Your Name&quot; in 1995.

Foxworthy hosted Country Weekly&#x27;s &quot;TNN Music City News Country Awards&quot; show for 1998, 1999, and 2000.

In 1998, Foxworthy appeared on the mock talk show &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, where he attempts to explain his famous &quot;You might be a Redneck&quot; joke to Space Ghost, yet fails entirely. Throughout the episode, Space Ghost, Zorak, and Moltar are taking the Ghost Planet to the US, with plans to make it the 51st state. By the end of the episode Foxworthy is sent to &quot;The Box&quot;.

He hosted &quot;Are You Smarter than A 5th Grader?&quot; on Fox in prime time. He hosted the syndicated version of the series from September 21, 2009, until its cancellation on March 24, 2011. In 2015 it was announced that Foxworthy would return as host of &quot;Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?&quot; In addition, he is a host on &quot;The Bucks of Tecomate&quot; which airs on the NBC Sports Network with Alabama native David Morris.

He was the subject of a Comedy Central Roast in 2005.

In 2011, Foxworthy appeared as a guest “Shark” for two episodes of ABC&#x27;s second season of &quot;Shark Tank&quot;.

Since August 2012, Foxworthy has been the host and a producer of the GSN biblical-themed game show &quot;The American Bible Challenge&quot;, which has aired two seasons. He is also the host of the food reality competition series &quot;The American Baking Competition&quot;, which aired its first season in summer 2013.

Foxworthy has appeared as host and featured guest on several programs on the Outdoor Channel and Versus.

In February 2019, Foxworthy was announced as a judge for NBC&#x27;s comedy competition series &quot;Bring the Funny&quot;.

In 2020, a new episode of &quot;Ellen&#x27;s Game of Games&quot; featured Jeff Foxworthy on a game of Stink Tank.

===Blue Collar Comedy===

In the early 2000s, Foxworthy had a career resurgence as a result of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, in which he and three other comedians (Larry the Cable Guy, Ron White, and Bill Engvall), specializing in common-man comedy, toured the country and performed for record crowds. The tour lasted three full years, constantly being extended after an initial run of 20 shows.

In 2004, he launched a new television series called &quot;Blue Collar TV&quot; on The WB. He served as executive producer and starred alongside Blue Collar Comedy Tour-mates Larry the Cable Guy and Bill Engvall. (Ron White made occasional guest appearances.) On Larry the Cable Guy&#x27;s website, he posted that the show was canceled on October 17, 2005, by The WB. Reruns of &quot;Blue Collar TV&quot; continued until the network merged with UPN to form The CW. In 2006, Foxworthy resurrected the &quot;Blue Collar TV&quot; format on Country Music Television (CMT) with &quot;Foxworthy&#x27;s Big Night Out&quot;. The show began airing in the fall and was canceled after one season of 12 episodes.

===Books===
Foxworthy has authored several books, including &quot;You Might Be a Redneck If...&quot; (1989), as well as his autobiography, &quot;No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem!&quot; (1996). Artist Layron DeJarnette provided illustrations for the Redneck Dictionary books. R. David Boyd has been the exclusive illustrator for most of Foxworthy&#x27;s books and album covers.

He also has released a cookbook entitled &quot;The Redneck Grill&quot;, co-authored with Newnan, Georgia, artist R. David Boyd, and &quot;Redneck Extreme Mobile Home Makeover&quot; (2005), a book with some of his redneck jokes.

===Written works===
* &quot;Jeff Foxworthy&#x27;s Redneck Dictionary: Words You Thought You Knew the Meaning Of&quot; (2005)
* &quot;Jeff Foxworthy&#x27;s Redneck Dictionary II: More Words You Thought You Knew the Meaning Of&quot; (2006)
* &quot;Jeff Foxworthy&#x27;s Redneck Dictionary III: Learning to Talk More Gooder Fastly&quot; (2007)
* &quot;Rednecks in College&quot;

In February 2008, Foxworthy released his first children&#x27;s book &quot;Dirt On My Shirt&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Silly Street&quot; in 2009 and &quot;Hide!!!&quot; in 2010, both of which were illustrated by Steve Bjorkman.

In May 2008, Foxworthy released &quot;How to Really Stink at Golf&quot;, with co-author Brian Hartt and illustrations by Layron DeJarnette. In May 2009, he released &quot;How to Really Stink at Work, A Guide to Making Yourself Fire-Proof While Having the Most Fun Possible&quot;. This book was also co-authored with Hartt and illustrations by DeJarnette.

===Radio work===
In April 1999, Foxworthy began &quot;The Foxworthy Countdown&quot;, a nationally syndicated, weekly radio show, which featured the top 30 country hits of the week, as reported by &quot;Mediabase&quot;. In 2001, he received a Country Music Association nomination for &quot;Broadcast Personality of the Year&quot;. The program&#x27;s last broadcast, the 2009 year-end countdown, aired the weekend of December 27, 2009. In 2006, Sirius Satellite Radio launched the Blue Collar Comedy channel, which featured stand-up comedy centered around the Blue Collar group. In 2015, now under the SiriusXM banner, the station rebranded as Jeff &amp; Larry&#x27;s Comedy Roundup, which featured similar programming to the previous channel with an enhanced focus on Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy.

===Foxworthy Outdoors===
In August 2011, Foxworthy launched Foxworthy Outdoors, a website carrying an assortment of Foxworthy-brand hunting and outdoors products. On the site, he also hosts a web series called &quot;Jeff Foxworthy: Inside &amp; Out&quot;, featuring some of his friends as they document hunting trips, fishing outings, and land conservation on his Georgia farm.

=== Other ===
In 2017 Foxworthy created the card game &quot;Relative Insanity&quot;, a game similar to Cards Against Humanity with a family theme. Family Game Shelf praised the game, saying &quot;it will have you laughing until your sides hurt&quot;.

==Personal life==
Foxworthy met his wife Pamela Gregg at the Punchline in Atlanta, Georgia, and they married on September 18, 1985. They have two daughters, Jordan and Julianne. He is a noted hunting enthusiast, beginning when he was a teen hunting on his father&#x27;s farm property in Central Georgia.

===Politics===
Foxworthy claims to keep his jokes apolitical and has criticized the memes circulating on social media that appear to show him making jokes at the expense of liberals in his stand-up. Despite this, he donated to the presidential campaign of George W. Bush, as well as the Republican National Committee in the 2000s. 
In 2012, Foxworthy endorsed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, and later stated that Donald Trump is &quot;tapping into the American spirit&quot;.
