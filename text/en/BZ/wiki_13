<text>The Astor Place station, also called Astor Place–Cooper Union on signs, is a local station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at Fourth Avenue, Cooper Square, and Astor Place between the East Village and NoHo, it is served by trains at all times, &lt;6&gt; trains during weekdays in the peak direction, and trains during late night hours.

The Astor Place station was constructed for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) as part of the city&#x27;s first subway line, which was approved in 1900. Construction of the line segment that includes the Astor Place station started on September 12 of the same year. The station opened on October 27, 1904, as one of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway. The station&#x27;s platforms were lengthened in the late 1950s, and the station was renovated in the mid-1980s.

The Astor Place station contains two side platforms and four tracks; express trains use the inner two tracks to bypass the station. The station was built with tile and mosaic decorations. The platforms contain exits to Astor Place and are not connected to each other within fare control. The original station interior is a New York City designated landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== History ==
=== Construction and opening ===
Planning for a subway line in New York City dates to 1864. However, development of what would become the city&#x27;s first subway line did not start until 1894, when the New York State Legislature passed the Rapid Transit Act. The subway plans were drawn up by a team of engineers led by William Barclay Parsons, the Rapid Transit Commission&#x27;s chief engineer. It called for a subway line from New York City Hall in lower Manhattan to the Upper West Side, where two branches would lead north into the Bronx. A plan was formally adopted in 1897, and all legal conflicts concerning the route alignment were resolved near the end of 1899. The Rapid Transit Construction Company, organized by John B. McDonald and funded by August Belmont Jr., signed the initial Contract 1 with the Rapid Transit Commission in February 1900, in which it would construct the subway and maintain a 50-year operating lease from the opening of the line. In 1901, the firm of Heins &amp; LaFarge was hired to design the underground stations. Belmont incorporated the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) in April 1902 to operate the subway.

The Astor Place station was constructed as part of the route segment from Great Jones Street to 41st Street. Construction on this section of the line began on September 12, 1900. The section from Great Jones Street to a point 100 feet (30 m) north of 33rd Street was awarded to Holbrook, Cabot &amp; Daly Contracting Company. In the vicinity of the Astor Place station, the subway was to run under Lafayette Street, a new thoroughfare constructed between 1897 and 1905. This involved widening, connecting, and renaming two formerly unconnected streets: Elm Street, which ran south of Houston Street, and Lafayette Place, which ran north of Great Jones Street to an intersection with Astor Place. The southward extension of Lafayette Street and the construction of the subway required the demolition or underpinning of several buildings in the street&#x27;s path. This resulted in the creation of narrow land lots on either side of Lafayette Street between Houston and Great Jones Streets, slightly south of the Astor Place station&#x27;s site. By late 1903, the subway was nearly complete, but the IRT Powerhouse and the system&#x27;s electrical substations were still under construction, delaying the system&#x27;s opening. As late as October 26, 1904, the day before the subway was scheduled to open, the wall on the southbound platform next to the Wanamaker&#x27;s store was incomplete.

The Astor Place station opened on October 27, 1904, as one of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway from City Hall to 145th Street on the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line. The opening of the first subway line, and particularly the Astor Place station, helped contribute to more development in the East Village; while the neighborhood was already densely populated at the time, the new subway provided connections to other parts of the city. After the first subway line was completed in 1908, the station was served by local trains along both the West Side (now the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line to Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street) and East Side (now the Lenox Avenue Line). West Side local trains had their southern terminus at City Hall during rush hours and South Ferry at other times, and had their northern terminus at 242nd Street. East Side local trains ran from City Hall to Lenox Avenue (145th Street).

=== Service changes and station renovations ===

==== 1900s to 1930s ====

Plans for the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (H&amp;M; now PATH), devised in the first decade of the 20th century, included a spur from the Uptown Hudson Tubes along Ninth Street to the Astor Place station. At the time, the Uptown Tubes between New Jersey and Manhattan had been under construction intermittently since 1874. By 1904, William Gibbs McAdoo was given the rights to complete the Uptown Tubes. As part of the plan, he would retain perpetual rights to build and operate an east–west crosstown line under Christopher Street and Ninth Street eastward to either Second Avenue or Astor Place, with no intermediate stops. Although the Uptown Tubes opened to 33rd Street in 1908, work on the Ninth Street spur stalled. By 1914, the Rapid Transit Commissioners had determined that the spur was unlikely to be built soon, so permission to build the Ninth Street tunnel was denied.

To address overcrowding, in 1909, the New York Public Service Commission proposed lengthening the platforms at stations along the original IRT subway. As part of a modification to the IRT&#x27;s construction contracts made on January 18, 1910, the company was to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car express and six-car local trains. In addition to $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) spent on platform lengthening, $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) was spent on building additional entrances and exits. It was anticipated that these improvements would increase capacity by 25 percent. The northbound platform at the Astor Place station was extended in either direction, while the southbound platform was not lengthened. Six-car local trains began operating in October 1910. The Lexington Avenue Line opened north of Grand Central–42nd Street in 1918, and the original line was divided into an H-shaped system. All local trains were sent via the Lexington Avenue Line, running along the Pelham Line in the Bronx.

In December 1922, the Transit Commission approved a $3 million project to lengthen platforms at 14 local stations along the original IRT line, including Astor Place and seven other stations on the Lexington Avenue Line. Platform lengths at these stations would be increased from . The commission postponed the platform-lengthening project in September 1923, at which point the cost had risen to $5.6 million.

==== 1940s to 1960s ====
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. After the closure of the Wanamaker&#x27;s department store in 1954, the northern building of the two-building complex was sold off and demolished. In July 1956, a fire gutted the building while it was being destroyed. When the fire was being extinguished, some water pooled in the basement and into a subterranean river parallel to the tracks, a likely tributary of Minetta Creek. In the aftermath, the Astor Place station was flooded, causing service to be rerouted for one week. The flood undermined the existing track bed, which was composed of a foot of concrete above a layer of earth. As a result, of new concrete track beds had to be installed. The repairs cost roughly $250,000.

In November 1959, the Warshaw Construction Company received a contract to remove fifteen entrance/exit kiosks on IRT lines, including two at the Astor Place station. This was part of a citywide initiative to remove the kiosks, which obstructed motorists&#x27; views of pedestrians. Also in late 1959, contracts were awarded to extend the platforms at , , , , , , Astor Place, , , and to . In April 1960, work began on a $3,509,000 project (equivalent to $ million in ) to lengthen platforms at seven of these stations to accommodate ten-car trains. The northbound platforms at Canal Street, Spring Street, Bleecker Street, and Astor Place were lengthened from ; the platform extensions at these stations opened on February 19, 1962.

==== 1970s to present ====
In 1979, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the space within the boundaries of the original station, excluding expansions made after 1904, as a city landmark. The station was designated along with eleven others on the original IRT. The original interiors were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system in 1981. This led residents to create the Committee for Astor Place to raise money for restoration of the station. In 1981, the MTA announced the creation of its Culture Stations program to install public art in the subway. The Culture Stations program was started to deter graffiti, and was inspired by legislation in the New York City Council that mandated that 1% of the cost of constructing public buildings be used for art. The program was modeled on the Louvre – Rivoli station on the Paris Métro, which featured reproductions of the artwork on display in the Louvre. Four stations, namely Astor Place, Eastern Parkway–Brooklyn Museum, 66th Street–Lincoln Center, and Fifth Avenue/53rd Street, were selected for the program due to their proximity to cultural institutions. These would be among the first stations in the MTA&#x27;s new station refurbishment program, which began in 1982. Initially, there was funding only for the Astor Place and Fifth Avenue/53rd Street stations.

By 1982, the Astor Place station was planned to be renovated for $2.25 million. As part of the Adopt-a-Station program, which sought to renovate some of the subway&#x27;s most deteriorated stations, the Chemical Bank sponsored a $2.5 million renovation for the station (equivalent to $ million in ), while the Committee for Astor Place cosponsored the project. Other sources of funding included $600,000 from the Federal Urban Mass Transit Administration, as well as $125,000 from private sources such as the Vincent Astor Foundation. The firm of Prentice &amp; Chan, Ohlhausen was hired to renovate the platforms. Rolf Ohlhausen, one of the firm&#x27;s principals, had photographed the station&#x27;s original cast-iron station entrance kiosks as an architecture student at the neighboring Cooper Union, and he advocated for a replica kiosk to be installed over the northbound entrance.

The station&#x27;s renovation started in June 1984 and was completed by May 1986. The scope of the project included the restoration of the platform&#x27;s glazed ceramic beaver plaques; refurbishing the 1950s platform extensions with a design similar to the original station; cleaning the ceiling; and adding new lighting, noise-abatement material, and brown floor tiles. A new piece of porcelain steel artwork by Cooper Union alumnus Milton Glaser was installed and a cast-iron copy of one of the station&#x27;s original kiosks was built. The MTA rejected Glaser&#x27;s original proposal to include beaver representations in the artwork because the beavers too closely resembled rats. Glaser&#x27;s artwork was installed as a gift, and the kiosk was installed using leftover funding. An underpass between the northbound and southbound platforms was closed and covered up in the 1980s renovation. Sound-deadening panels were also installed in the station. Following the completion of the project, architectural writer Paul Goldberger wrote that the Astor Place station&#x27;s &quot;value as architecture lies not in any generous space it offers, but in a series of pleasing details&quot;.

== Station layout ==

Like other local stations, Astor Place has four tracks and two side platforms. The 6 stops here at all times, rush-hour and midday &lt;6&gt; trains stop here in the peak direction; and the 4 stops here during late nights. The two express tracks are used by the 4 and 5 trains during daytime hours. The station is between to the north and to the south. The platforms were originally long, like at other local stations on the original IRT, but as a result of the 1959 platform extensions, became long. The platform extensions are at the front ends of the original platforms: the southbound platform was extended southward and the northbound platform was extended northward, resulting in the two platforms being offset from each other. Both platforms are slightly curved, since the station itself is placed on an S-curve between Lafayette Street and Fourth Avenue.

===Design===
As with other stations built as part of the original IRT, the station was constructed using a cut-and-cover method. The tunnel is covered by a U-shaped trough that contains utility pipes and wires. The bottom of this trough contains a foundation of concrete no less than thick. Each platform consists of concrete slabs, beneath which are drainage basins. The original platforms contain circular, cast-iron Doric-style columns spaced every , while the platform extensions contain I-beam columns, some clad with white glazed tiles. The columns contain black-and-white signs alternating between &quot;Astor Place&quot; and &quot;Cooper Union&quot;. Additional columns between the tracks, spaced every , support the jack-arched concrete station roofs. The ceiling height varies based on whether there are utilities in the ceiling; the areas without utilities is about above platform level, while the area with utilities has a ceiling height of . There is a gap between the trough wall and the platform walls, which are made of -thick brick covered over by a tiled finish.

The fare control areas are at platform level and there is no free transfer between directions. The underpass that formerly connected the platforms opened along with the rest of the station in 1904, making Astor Place one of the few locations in the original IRT where passengers could transfer between directions for free.

The walls in this station contain modern enamel artwork. The walls along the platforms near the fare control areas consist of a brick wainscoting on the lowest part of the wall, with bronze air vents along the wainscoting, and white glass tiles above. The platform walls are divided at intervals by buff brick tile pilasters, or vertical bands; the wall sections between each pilaster contain a border of blue mosaic tiles. In the original portion of the station, each pilaster is topped by yellow faience plaques depicting beavers, surrounded by green scrolled and foliate motifs. The beaver plaques are a reference to John Jacob Astor, whose fortune had been derived from the beaver-pelt trade. A faience cornice with green urn and vine motifs runs atop these walls. Cream-on-blue faience plaques with the words &quot;Astor Place&quot; are also spaced at various intervals on the walls, a deviation from the tile plaques seen at other original IRT stations. The platform extensions contain similar decorative elements, but the pilasters are made of tan ceramic tiles, and the wall sections between each pilaster contain a border of blue ceramic tiles. Within the platform extensions&#x27; pilasters are tiled plaques with the vertical text &quot;Astor&quot;. There were maroon and gold tile Cooper Union signs underneath the tile Astor Place signs, which were destroyed during the renovation. The mosaic tiles at all original IRT stations were manufactured by the American Encaustic Tile Company, which subcontracted the installations at each station. The decorative work was performed by tile contractor Manhattan Glass Tile Company and faience contractor Grueby Faience Company.

The northbound platform contains doorways that formerly led to men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s restrooms, with corresponding marble lintels. A news and candy stand was in the former women&#x27;s restroom, but it has been closed and walled off as of 2021. North of fare control is a rounded seating area. The northbound platform was used as a cover image of Billy Joel&#x27;s 1976 album Turnstiles.

On the southbound side, the station has an entrance and windows into a store. The heavy brick-faced square columns on the southbound platform support the store above. The store was originally constructed in 1868 as an A. T. Stewart, but it had become a Wanamaker&#x27;s by the time the station was constructed and opened. The Wanamaker&#x27;s store was closed by 1954. It served as Kmart location from November 1996 to July 2021. A Wegmans location opened within the Kmart space in late 2023.

Also present on the southbound side is a sealed doorway with a marble lintel reading &quot;Clinton Hall&quot;. This doorway once led to the New York Mercantile Library in the former Astor Opera House.

===Exits===
The station has one street entrance in each direction. The southbound platform&#x27;s entrance is at the southwest corner of Astor Place and Lafayette Street. The street staircase on the southbound side contains modern steel railings like those seen at most New York City Subway stations.

The northbound platform&#x27;s entrance is in the traffic island bounded by Fourth Avenue, Lafayette Street, and Eighth Street. Unlike the southbound entrance, the northbound entrance contains a highly decorative entrance, reminiscent of an entry kiosk seen on the original IRT. The structure is an imitation of the IRT&#x27;s original entrance and exit kiosks, extremely ornate structures made of cast iron and glass. The IRT kiosks were inspired by those on the Budapest Metro, which themselves were inspired by ornate summer houses called &quot;kushks&quot;. The Astor Place entrance is a reproduction installed in the 1980s and was made at the same factory as the originals. The kiosk is wide, long, and tall. The replica was largely based from photographs by renovating architect Rolf Ohlhausen. Like the original entrance kiosks, it has a domed roof with cast-iron shingles. Unlike the originals, the roof of the kiosk have clear tempered glass to allow natural light, while the original kiosks had translucent glass with chicken wire, which tended to become dirty over time. Additionally, the decorative pieces of the new kiosk were molded from fragments of the originals, but the new kiosk was made of lighter-weight material.

== Points of interest ==
Several sites of historical and cultural importance are near the station, such as New York University and Cooper Union. The Alamo, a cube sculpture in the traffic island above the northbound platform, is a popular visitor attraction in the area. Other points of interest include:

* McSorley&#x27;s Old Ale House
* Cooper Union New Academic Building
* Cooper Square Hotel
* The Public Theater (formerly the Astor Library)
* Astor Place Theatre (part of Colonnade Row; occupied by Blue Man Group)
* Hamilton Fish House

The Eighth Street–New York University station on the BMT Broadway Line is one block west of the station.

<doc id="728810" wikidata="Q4241150" url="?curid=728810" title="Cryocooler">
<text>A refrigerator designed to reach cryogenic temperatures (below 120 K, -153 °C, -243.4 °F) is often called a cryocooler. The term is most often used for smaller systems, typically table-top size, with input powers less than about 20 kW. Some can have input powers as low as 2–3 W. Large systems, such as those used for cooling the superconducting magnets in particle accelerators are more often called cryogenic refrigerators. Their input powers can be as high as 1 MW. In most cases cryocoolers use a cryogenic fluid as the working substance and employ moving parts to cycle the fluid around a thermodynamic cycle. The fluid is typically compressed at room temperature, precooled in a heat exchanger, then expanded at some low temperature. The returning low-pressure fluid passes through the heat exchanger to precool the high-pressure fluid before entering the compressor intake. The cycle is then repeated.

== Ideal heat exchangers and regenerators ==
Heat exchangers are important components of all cryocoolers. Ideal heat exchangers have no flow resistance and the exit gas temperature is the same as the (fixed) body temperature &quot;T&quot;X of the heat exchanger. Note that even a perfect heat exchanger will not affect the entrance temperature &quot;T&quot;i of the gas. This leads to losses.

An important component of refrigerators, operating with oscillatory flows, is the regenerator. A regenerator consists of a matrix of a solid porous material, such as granular particles or metal sieves, through which gas flows back and forth. Periodically heat is stored and released by the material. The thermal contact with the gas must be good and the flow resistance of the matrix must be low. These are conflicting requirements. The thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties of regenerators are complicated, so one usually makes simplifying models. In its most extreme form an &quot;ideal&quot; regenerator has the following properties:
* large volumetric heat capacity of the material;
* perfect heat contact between gas and matrix;
* zero flow resistance of the matrix;
* zero porosity (this is the volume fraction of the gas);
* zero thermal conductivity in the flow direction;
* the gas is ideal.
Progress in the cryocooler field in recent decades is in large part due to development of new materials having high heat capacity below 10 K.

== Stirling refrigerators ==

===Components===
The basic type of Stirling-type cooler is depicted in Fig.1. It consists of (from left to right):
* a piston
* a compression space and heat exchanger (all at ambient temperature &quot;T&quot;a)
* a regenerator
* a heat exchanger
* an expansion space
* a piston (all at the low temperature &quot;T&quot;L).

Left and right the thermal contact with the surroundings at the temperatures &quot;T&quot;a and &quot;T&quot;L is supposed to be perfect so that the compression and expansion are isothermal. The work, performed during the expansion, is used to reduce the total input power. Usually helium is the working fluid.

===Cooling cycle===

The cooling cycle is split in 4 steps as depicted in Fig.2. The cycle starts when the two pistons are in their most left positions:
* From a to b. The warm piston moves to the right while the cold piston is fixed. The temperature of compressed gas at the hot end is isothermal (by definition), so heat &quot;Q&quot;a is given off to the surroundings at ambient temperature &quot;T&quot;a.
* From b to c. The two pistons move to the right. The volume between the two pistons is kept constant. The hot gas enters the regenerator with temperature &quot;T&quot;a and leaves it with temperature &quot;T&quot;L. The gas gives off heat to the regenerator material.
* From c to d. The cold piston moves to the right while the warm piston is fixed. The expansion is isothermal and heat &quot;Q&quot;L is taken up. This is the useful cooling power.
* From d to a. The two pistons move to the left while the total volume remains constant. The gas enters the regenerator with low temperature &quot;T&quot;L and leaves it with high temperature &quot;T&quot;a so heat is taken up from the regenerator material. At the end of this step the state of the cooler is the same as in the beginning.

In the pV diagram (Fig.3) the corresponding cycle consists of two isotherms and two isochores. The volume &quot;V&quot; is the volume between the two pistons. In practice the cycle is not divided in discrete steps as described above. Usually the motions of both pistons are driven by a common rotary axes which makes the motions harmonic. The phase difference between the motions of the two pistons is about 90°. In the ideal case the cycle is reversible so the COP (the ratio of the cooling power and the input power) is equal to the Carnot COP given by &quot;T&quot;L/(&quot;T&quot;a − &quot;T&quot;L).

It is not so practical to have a cold piston, as described above, so, in many cases, a displacer is used instead of the cold piston. A displacer is a solid body which moves back and forth in the cold head driving the gas back and forth between the warm and the cold end of the cold head via the regenerator. No work is required to move the displacer since, ideally there is no pressure drop over it. Typically its motion is 90 degrees out of phase with the piston. In the ideal case the COP also equals to the Carnot COP.

Another type of Stirling cooler is the split-pair type (Fig.4), consisting of a compressor, a split pipe, and a cold finger. Usually there are two pistons moving in opposite directions driven by AC magnetic fields (as in loudspeakers). The pistons can be suspended by so-called flexure bearings. They provide stiffness in the radial direction and flexibility in the axial direction. The pistons and the compressor casing don&#x27;t touch so no lubricants are needed and there is no wear. The regenerator in the cold finger is suspended by a spring. The cooler operates at a frequency near the resonance frequency of the mass-spring system of the cold finger.
== GM-refrigerators ==
 Gifford-McMahon (GM) coolers have found widespread application in many low-temperature systems e.g. in MRI and cryopumps. Fig.5 is a schematic diagram. Helium at pressures in the range is the working fluid. The cold head contains a compression and expansion space, a regenerator, and a displacer. Usually the regenerator and the displacer are combined in one body. The pressure variations in the cold head are obtained by connecting it periodically to the high- and low-pressure sides of a compressor by a rotating valve. Its position is synchronized with the motion of the displacer. During the opening and closing of the valves irreversible processes take place, so GM-coolers have intrinsic losses. This is a clear disadvantage of this type of cooler. The advantage is that the cycle frequencies of the compressor and the displacer are uncoupled so that the compressor can run at power-line frequency (50 or 60 Hz) while the cycle of the cold head is 1 Hz. In this way the swept volume of the compressor can be 50 or 60 times smaller than of the cooler. Basically (cheap) compressors of domestic refrigerators can be used, but one must prevent overheating of the compressor as it is not designed for helium. One must also prevent oil vapor from entering the regenerator by high-quality purification traps.

===Cooling cycle===
The cycle can be divided in four steps, with Fig.6, as follows:
The cycle starts with the low-pressure (LP) valve closed, the high-pressure (HP) valve open, and the displacer all the way to the right (so in the cold region). All the gas is at room temperature.
* From a to b. The displacer moves to the left while the cold head is connected to the HP side of the compressor. The gas passes the regenerator entering the regenerator at ambient temperature &quot;T&quot;a and leaving it with temperature &quot;T&quot;L. Heat is released by the gas to the regenerator material.
* From b to c. The HP valve is closed and the LP valve opened with fixed position of the displacer. Part of the gas flows through the regenerator to the LP side of the compressor. The gas expands. The expansion is isothermal so heat is taken up from the application. This is where the useful cooling power is produced.
* From c to d. The displacer moves to the right with the cold head connected to the LP side of the compressor forcing the cold gas to pass the regenerator, while taking up heat from the regenerator.
* From d to a. The LP valve is closed and the HP valve opened with fixed position of the displacer. The gas, now in the hot end of the cold head, is compressed and heat is released to the surroundings. In the end of this step we are back in position a.
== Pulse-tube refrigerators ==
A so-called Stirling-type single-orifice PTR is represented schematically in Fig.7. From left to right it consists of: a piston which moves back and forth; a heat exchanger X1 (after cooler) where heat is released at room temperature (&quot;T&quot;a) to the environment; a regenerator; a heat exchanger XL at low temperature (&quot;T&quot;L) where heat is absorbed from the application; a tube, often called the pulse tube; a heat exchanger X3 to room temperature (&quot;T&quot;a); a flow resistance (orifice); a buffer volume, in which the pressure &quot;p&quot;B is practically constant.

== Joule-Thomson cooler ==

The Joule-Thomson (JT) cooler was invented by Carl von Linde and William Hampson so it is also called the Linde-Hampson cooler. It is a simple type of cooler which is widely applied as cryocooler or as the (final stage) of coolants. It can easily be miniaturized, but it is also used on a very large scale in the liquefaction of natural gas. A schematic diagram of a JT liquefier is given in Fig.8. It consists of a compressor, a counterflow heat exchanger, a JT valve, and a reservoir.

===Cooling cycle===
In Fig.8 the pressures and temperatures refer to the case of a nitrogen liquefier. At the inlet of the compressor the gas is at room temperature (300 K) and a pressure of 1 bar (point a). The compression heat is removed by cooling water. After compression the gas temperature is ambient temperature (300 K) and the pressure is (point b). Next it enters the warm (high-pressure) side of the counterflow heat exchanger where it is precooled. It leaves the exchanger at point c. After the JT expansion, point d, it has a temperature of and a pressure of 1 bar. The liquid fraction is &quot;x&quot;. The liquid leaves the system at the bottom of the reservoir (point e) and the gas (fraction 1 − &quot;x&quot;) flows into the cold (low-pressure) side of the counterflow heat exchanger (point f). It leaves the heat exchanger at room temperature (point a). In order to keep the system in the steady state, gas is supplied to compensate for the liquid fraction &quot;x&quot; that has been removed.

When used as a cryocooler it is preferable to use gas mixtures instead of pure nitrogen. In this way the efficiency is improved and the high pressure is much lower than 200 bar.

A more detailed description of Joule-Thomson coolers and Joule-Thomson refrigerators can be found in.

<text>Hubert Alexander Ingraham, PC (born 4 August 1947) is a Bahamian politician who was Prime Minister of the Bahamas from August 1992 to May 2002, and again from May 2007 to May 2012. He is a member of the Free National Movement Party (FNM). Prior to the 2012 election, he was the FNM&#x27;s Party Leader and member of Parliament for the North Abaco constituency. He served as leader of the opposition in the House of Assembly of the Bahamas from 2005 to 2007.

In the historic election of August 1992, in which the FNM unseated the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP), Ingraham succeeded Prime Minister Lynden Pindling, who had headed the PLP government for quarter of a century, since January 1967. Following his party&#x27;s victory in the May 2007 election, he became prime minister again.

After his government was defeated in the 2012 general election, on 7 May Ingraham announced his resignation as FNM leader and as an MP.

==Youth and early career==

Ingraham was born 4 August 1947 in Pine Ridge, Grand Bahama. He is the son of Jerome Ingraham, a stevedore, and Isabella La-Roda (née Cornish). He grew up in Coopers Town, Abaco and began his education at Coopers Town Public School, later attending the Southern Senior School and the Government High School Evening Institute in Nassau.

Ingraham studied law in Nassau. He was called to the Bahamas Bar in December 1972 and eventually became senior partner in the law firm of Christie, Ingraham and Co. He entered front-line politics in 1975, when he was elected to the National General Council of the then ruling Progressive Liberal Party. He previously served as a member of the Air Transport Licensing Authority and Chairman of the Real Property Tax Tribunal.

Following brief employment in the accounting departments of Owens-Illinois Sugar Mill Company in Abaco and The Bahamas Telecommunications Corporation and the Chase Manhattan Bank in Nassau, Ingraham became an articled law clerk in the Chambers of McKinney Bancroft and Hughes.

==Cabinet Minister==

In 1976, Ingraham was elected National Chairman of the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) and a member of that party&#x27;s National Executive Committee. In 1977, still Chairman of the PLP, he was elected to the House of Assembly. In Parliament, Ingraham served as a member of the Standing Committee on Privilege and Public Accounts, and as Chairman of an investigative Select Committee on Influence Peddling and Political Contributions.

He was re-elected to Parliament in the General Election of June 1982, and appointed Minister of Housing and National Insurance (1982-1984). In 1982, he also became Chairman of The Bahamas Mortgage Corporation, an institution established to secure and guarantee housing financing for Bahamians in need of that service.

==Opposition==

Ingraham stood as an independent candidate in the 1987 general election and was one of only two Members of Parliament expelled from the ruling PLP to have gone on to immediate re-election as an independent.

Ingraham joined the Official Opposition in April 1990, and was immediately appointed Parliamentary Leader. When the Leader of the Opposition, Sir Cecil Wallace-Whitfield, died in May 1990, Ingraham was unanimously elected Leader of the Free National Movement and was appointed leader of the opposition on 18 May 1990, by Sir Henry Milton Taylor, the Governor-General. In June 1990, as freshman Leader of the Free National Movement, he led his party to a Marco City, Grand Bahama, by-election victory over the governing party. In the general election of 19 August 1992, Ingraham led the Free National Movement to a stunning 32–17 victory over the Progressive Liberal Party, and thus ended the 25-year hold on power of Prime Minister Sir Lynden Pindling.

==Prime minister==


The new prime minister had Cabinet responsibility for the Ministry of Finance from 1992 to 1995. Later, in a streamlined Cabinet, he took on responsibility for trade and industry, and quickly established a one-stop Investment Authority that promoted fresh investment in The Bahamas. In July 1993, Prime Minister Ingraham was made a Privy Counsellor, thus becoming a member of Her Majesty&#x27;s Most Honourable Privy Council. Again on 14 March 1997, Ingraham led the FNM to an even greater election victory.

Ingraham pledged that he would serve no longer than two terms or 10 years as Head of Government. In 2001, the FNM held special elections for Leader-Designate and Deputy Leader-Designate of the Party, with Tommy Turnquest emerging as the victor who would assume leadership of the FNM on the night of the next general elections.

===Administrative achievements===

He is credited for allowing the Atlantis Paradise Island project to develop.

He administered a disengagement of the Bahamas Telecommunications Company in the mid-1990s, severing ties with hundreds of BTC employees, although handing out severance packages for those who opted for the exit packages. The true value of the impact of the disengagement is debatable.

Through his first term, he guided the Bahamas through a tumultuous period in the financial services sector, which ushered in sweeping changes to be made and imposed upon the Bahamas by international organizations such as the OECD and the FATF. Sweeping legislation was seen as necessary by the administration, but such drastic and immediate measures were up to debate by observers and economists of the time. Subsequently, the market fears spread and resulted in massive job losses in the sector.

By the end of his first term, he was sitting on a Bahamian economy which was going into recession, brought on by a global downturn in productivity, sparked by the dot.com bubble bust and the attacks of 9–11, exacerbated by massive exits of foreign capital, due to new banking regulations set in place by his administration.

Another controversial issue proposed by his administration was a referendum on social policy. Many observers said that the failure of the referendum led to the resounding defeat at the polls for the FNM in 2002, with a 29–7 overwhelming margin of victory for the incoming Progressive Liberal Party.

==Return to the opposition==

In 2001, Ingraham announced his decision to step down as party leader and Tommy Turnquest, a member of his Cabinet, emerged from the resultant leadership contest as the party&#x27;s new leader. However, in the 2002 General Election, the party suffered a resounding defeat at the polls with his leader designate and deputy designate losing their seats in parliament.

Although Ingraham retained his North Abaco seat, he did not immediately return to party leadership, as Leader of the Opposition nor of house business. It was not until the party&#x27;s November 2005 convention that he was again elected FNM Leader, amid criticism for the lack of due process in his ability, through the party&#x27;s platform, to make himself eligible for party nomination. This was also seen as a repudiation of his former position, where he claimed to only want to serve two terms as prime minister. Nonetheless, he was returned to party leadership ahead of the 2007 general elections.

At the time, Ingraham said that it boiled down to a matter of trust. &quot;The country needs and deserves reform no matter what, because the loss of trust in government has been so great.&quot; And he maintained that the FNM had developed an agenda to renew the people&#x27;s trust in government.

He says national leadership by the Free National Movement will once again bring the interests of Bahamians into focus and to the forefront of government&#x27;s social and economic policies, remove influence peddling from the halls of government, restore integrity and honesty to public life, and reintroduce initiatives to achieve efficient and effective government left in abeyance during the last four and a half years.

==Prime Minister again==

In the general election held on 2 May 2007, the FNM won a majority of seats, defeating the PLP, and Ingraham was sworn in as prime minister on 4 May. He became Minister of Finance in the new government.

As a result of his government&#x27;s defeat in the May 2012 general election, Ingraham announced his resignation as FNM leader and as an MP; his resignation was to take effect on 26 May 2012. On 9 May 2012, Hubert Minnis was elected by the members of the FNM to succeed Ingraham as Leader of the Opposition.

<text>Brand New was an American rock band formed in 2000 from Long Island, New York. Consisting of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Jesse Lacey, lead guitarist Vincent Accardi, bassist Garrett Tierney and drummer Brian Lane, the band earned critical recognition as one of the most influential emo bands, and was acclaimed for their musical development and artistic innovation compared to other groups in the scene which they originated from.

In the 1990s, Lacey, Tierney and Lane played in the Levittown band the Rookie Lot, and Brand New was formed with Accardi after Lacey left his position as the founding bassist for Taking Back Sunday. The band signed to Triple Crown Records and released a pop punk debut album &quot;Your Favorite Weapon.&quot; The band began to incorporate indie rock influences on their second album &quot;Deja Entendu&quot;, released in 2003 to positive reviews over the band&#x27;s stylistic changes. Its two singles &quot;The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows&quot; and &quot;Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades&quot; both entered the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Deja Entendu&quot; was eventually certified Gold in the United States.

The demos for the band&#x27;s major label debut on Interscope Records were leaked onto the internet in 2006. After reworking the material, the band released &quot;The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me&quot;, which earned retrospective critical acclaim for its influence on emo. It was also certified Gold in the US and the single &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; peaked at number 30 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Alternative Songs chart. Accardi&#x27;s role as a lyricist increased on the band&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Daisy&quot; (2009), which debuted at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and featured a more post-hardcore and noise rock sound.

While Brand New toured consistently and played several prominent festivals, the band went six years without releasing music before the singles &quot;Mene&quot; (2015) and &quot;I Am a Nightmare&quot; (2016). Brand New&#x27;s fifth and final album, &quot;Science Fiction&quot;, was surprise-released in August 2017 through the band&#x27;s own record label, Procrastinate! Music Traitors. It debuted at number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, receiving both critical acclaim and commercial success. The band repeatedly announced plans to break up in 2018 but remained inactive for seven years without an official announcement of a breakup in the wake of 2017 allegations against Lacey. The band reunited in 2024 to play a charity show.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;Your Favorite Weapon&quot; (2000–2002)===
In the late 1990s, Jesse Lacey, Garrett Tierney and Brian Lane were all members of the Levittown, New York post-hardcore band the Rookie Lot, along with Brandon Reilly and Alex Dunne of Crime in Stereo. The Rookie Lot split and did not play for a while until Lacey, Lane and Tierney started to rehearse again. After Reilly joined The Movielife, they recruited guitarist Vincent Accardi from the band One Last Goodbye.

All four members had backgrounds linking into their local Long Island independent and hardcore music scenes, but with influences ranging from Buddy Rich to Archers of Loaf. Brand New was officially formed in 2000 in a basement in Merrick, New York. Their initial intention was always to &quot;move outside of whatever notions they felt inclined to when they were making music as younger people.&quot; The band gained exposure in the local scene through playing shows with alternative rock contemporaries Midtown and post-hardcore bands like Glassjaw, while also self-releasing a four-song demo. The band&#x27;s first show was at the Garden City bowling alley as the opener for Long Island hardcore band Silent Majority.

Brand New signed to Triple Crown Records just after their second-ever show. The band had released a demo for Warner Bros. Records, but the label did not believe that the band had a hit single in their catalog that was worth signing them for. In response, Lacey immediately wrote &quot;Last Chance to Lose Your Keys&quot; at the label office to serve as their single, but Warner Bros. declined to make an offer and Brand New ended up with Triple Crown instead.

Lane and Reilly came up with the band name Brand New, which Lacey said was &quot;somewhat in jest because nothing about the band is really that new... we weren&#x27;t trying to break ground with a new kind of sound or anything.&quot; Later, Lacey said that interpretation was not his original intention, claiming that &quot;a friend of ours said he would call his band Brand New but he never got a new band so we took it. I wish it were something as clever as a sarcastic take on the state of music.&quot;

Brand New&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Your Favorite Weapon&quot; was produced by friend of the band Mike Sapone. The album has been described as being &quot;bitter about ex-girlfriends&quot;, with an excessive concentration on &quot;post-breakup angst&quot;. It received relatively positive reviews, with AllMusic awarding it three out of five and PopMatters also being favorable. It became a moderate success, selling over 50,000 copies. The record deal gave Brand New the opportunity to tour, playing alongside the likes of Taking Back Sunday and touring the UK in support of Finch, to a &quot;great response&quot; from the crowds. The band also played the first edition of the UK&#x27;s Download Festival in 2003.

The only single released from &quot;Your Favorite Weapon&quot; was &quot;Jude Law and a Semester Abroad&quot;. The song has been described by AllMusic as a &quot;semi-hit&quot; after it received airplay on both MTV2 and Fuse.

==== Feud with Taking Back Sunday ====
During their early years, Brand New was involved a highly publicized feud with fellow Long Island band Taking Back Sunday. Lacey was Taking Back Sunday&#x27;s founding bassist and close friends with the band&#x27;s guitarist John Nolan since fourth grade, with Nolan teaching Lacey how to play the guitar in high school. Nolan allegedly participated in an affair with Lacey&#x27;s girlfriend at a house party, causing Lacey to leave Taking Back Sunday and eventually form Brand New. Brand New released the first song about the incident in 2001, &quot;Seventy Times 7&quot;, named after the number of sins Jesus said one should be forgiven for, where Lacey wished death upon Nolan. Taking Back Sunday responded on 2002&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s No &#x27;I&#x27; in Team&quot;, where Nolan and frontman Adam Lazzara alternate vocals and directly quote lyrics from &quot;Seventy Times 7&quot;.

Brand New then released a shirt reading &quot;Because mics are for singing, not swinging&quot;, insulting Lazzara&#x27;s signature stage antics which once injured their bassist to the point of needing stitches. Taking Back Sunday followed with their own &quot;Proudly swinging since 1999&quot; shirt. The two bands toured together in 2002 and Lacey joined Taking Back Sunday on stage in Boulder, Colorado to perform &quot;There&#x27;s No &#x27;I&#x27; in Team&quot;. Nolan also performed with Brand New. However, the feud was still unresolved. Nolan left Taking Back Sunday in 2003 after Lazzara cheated on Nolan&#x27;s sister, leading Lacey to reconcile with Nolan and allegedly insult Taking Back Sunday at concerts again. Taking Back Sunday guitarist Eddie Reyes told &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2004 that he was dissatisfied with his band being considered second-place to Brand New in the Long Island rock scene. In 2015, Lazzara rekindled the feud by calling Lacey a &quot;dick&quot; in an interview.

===&quot;Deja Entendu,&quot; acclaim and label bidding war (2003–2004)===

Brand New&#x27;s second studio album was written in the &quot;year and-a-half or two years&quot; that they were touring the material off of &quot;Your Favorite Weapon&quot;. According to drummer Brian Lane, &quot;Jesse [Lacey] wrote a lot of the lyrics about different things than &#x27;I just broke up with my girlfriend&#x27; for the new record,&quot; on an acoustic guitar in his bedroom. Lane also said the band&#x27;s music tastes continued to expand, and that unlike their debut, a lot of time and concentration went into making the album. &quot;I&#x27;m surprised that so many bands just keep putting out the same record as they did previously. We try to flex as much of our diversity muscles... as we can,&quot; Lacey said about growing the band&#x27;s sound. Before the album was even released, the band sold out three shows of a 24-date US headlining tour with Moneen, Senses Fail, and The Beautiful Mistake solely off word-of-mouth and Internet message board hype. The band also earned a slot on the 2003 Warped Tour and as openers for Dashboard Confessional.

&quot;Deja Entendu&quot; was released through Razor &amp; Tie/Triple Crown Records on June 17, 2003. It began to receive international releases four months later. The album&#x27;s title literally translates to &quot;already heard&quot; in French. It debuted at number 63 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. After just seven weeks, the album&#x27;s sales were at more than 51,000 copies, already closing in on the total figure of its predecessor. In May 2007, four years after its release, it was certified Gold for surpassing 500,000 sales in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America.

The album&#x27;s two singles, &quot;The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows&quot; and &quot;Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades&quot;, helped give the band exposure in the mainstream in contrast to how &quot;Your Favorite Weapon&quot; went &quot;virtually unnoticed&quot;. Their music videos found &quot;constant&quot; airplay on MTV, and the band made its live television debut on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, performing &quot;The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows&quot;&quot;.&quot; Both singles entered the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart and &quot;The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows&quot; peaked at number 37 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Alternative Songs chart. In the wake of &quot;Deja Entendu&quot;, Brand New was pegged as an act to watch in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s annual &quot;Hot Issue.&quot; The band topped punk critics&#x27; year-end lists with the &quot;genre-defying&quot; &quot;Deja Entendu&quot;, and the album was described as a &quot;landmark album of so-called &#x27;emo-punk&#x27;.&quot;

Following the album&#x27;s release, Brand New sold out a headlining tour of the UK in January 2004 supported by Straylight Run, opened for Blink-182 in an arena tour of Australia, opened for Incubus in an arena tour of the UK and was slated to headline New Jersey&#x27;s The Bamboozle festival in 2005 before canceling because of a member&#x27;s health issues.

==== Changing labels ====
As a result of both &quot;Deja Entendu&quot;&#x27;s success and the band&#x27;s notable underground following, Brand New found itself in the middle of a bidding war from record labels. At the time, drummer Brian Lane disagreed with the usage of the phrase &quot;bidding war&quot;, but conceded, &quot;There&#x27;s a few labels that are definitely interested. We&#x27;ve been talking to a lot of people for a while and we&#x27;re narrowing it down.&quot; Following the album&#x27;s success, Triple Crown Records knew that they had no chance of re-signing Brand New at the conclusion of their two-album deal. Lyor Cohen, at the time the president of The Island Def Jam Music Group, asked Thursday vocalist Geoff Rickly to speak positively about Island Records to Lacey in order to convince Brand New to sign with them. However, Lacey did not believe Rickly, as he noted how the label had told Thursday to rewrite their album &quot;War All the Time&quot; in order to placate the executives and did not want that happening to Brand New as well.

Michael Goldstone, who at the time was leaving DreamWorks Records for Sire Records, told Interscope Records executive Luke Wood to sign Brand New; Wood recalled that &quot;for about six months, every label was trying to sign the band, chasing them all over the world. It was brutal.&quot; Vagrant Records made a hard push, but Brand New wanted total creative control in order to distance themselves from the emo scene following the success of &quot;Deja Entendu&quot;. Lacey was interested in the music of Pinback, Archers of Loaf and Neutral Milk Hotel.

The band eventually signed with DreamWorks Records, which was then taken over by Interscope Records.

===&quot;The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me&quot; and continued acclaim (2005–2007)===

Following their signing to Interscope, Brand New stopped touring to work on their third album and major label debut. In this time, little to no interviews or updates came from the band. In 2004, Jesse Lacey told &quot;Chart&quot; magazine that he had written a &quot;few songs&quot; for the next album, commenting that &quot;the other guys love it already&quot;, and acknowledged suffering from depression because of the pressure to deliver on the anticipation surrounding the band.

In late 2005, Brand New started recording their third album in Oxford, Mississippi with producer Dennis Herring, but later dropped him in favor of Mike Sapone with whom they had worked on their first album. On January 24, 2006, nine tracks recorded for the album were leaked to the Internet. Lacey was upset, saying, &quot;No one likes to show their creation in mid-process, and those songs weren&#x27;t done. They were like blueprints. Just the plan, right? It put me in a state where I was under the impression that those songs had been wasted or something—that we had to go and write new things because those had been heard.&quot;

On June 20, 2006, Brand New performed for the first time in two years at the Starland Ballroom in New Jersey, also announcing that their third album had been completed the day prior. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; claimed the album would come out on October 10, 2006, before the band corrected the date to November 21, 2006, in North America, and the day before in Europe. The band revealed that musician Derrick Sherman, who was brought in to &quot;complete the sound on stage&quot;, contributed parts to every song on the album, and that drummer Brian Lane &quot;easily consider[ed] him part of the band&quot;.

On October 5, Brand New announced the title, &quot;The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me,&quot; and its track listing. Lead single &quot;Sowing Season&quot; debuted on the radio on October 19 and appeared on their MySpace page a day later. In a BBC Radio 1 interview with Zane Lowe, Lacey explained that the album&#x27;s title came from a conversation he had with a friend about the musician Daniel Johnston, who suffered from bipolar disorder. &quot;The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me&quot; has since become Brand New&#x27;s most critically acclaimed album and is considered one of the best albums of the 2000s.

In late December 2006, a music video was released for the instrumental track &quot;Untitled&quot;, also known as &quot;-&quot;, which consists of a man spray-painting the phrase &quot;evil and good are raging inside me&quot; onto a wall before correcting it to read the album title. On January 16, 2007, &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; was announced as the next official single from the album. It peaked at number 30 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Alternative Songs chart, becoming Brand New&#x27;s biggest hit. On January 19, the band performed the song on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. They performed it again on February 26 on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. Despite the band&#x27;s reluctance towards the press around the time of the release of the album, they were featured in &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, a cover story for &quot;Rock Sound&quot;, &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, and &quot;NME&quot;.

Brand New also added a second live drummer, Benjamin Homola, who had been the band&#x27;s drum tech since 2004 and would go on to join bands including Bad Books, Twin Forks and Grouplove. The band first opened for Dashboard Confessional in a fall 2006 arena tour of the US. Brand New toured extensively in 2007 to promote the album, first headlining an international tour of Europe before also playing festivals such as Reading and Leeds, Lowlands and Pukkelpop. In the US, the band was supported by Manchester Orchestra and Kevin Devine on a spring tour and had Thrice and MewithoutYou open a fall tour. In early 2008, Brand New toured Australia and New Zealand on the Big Day Out festival.

===&quot;Daisy&quot; (2008–2009)===

In March 2008, Brand New started their own record label, Procrastinate! Music Traitors. The first act signed to the new label was longtime friend Kevin Devine. The first release from the label was a reissue of the 2006 Kevin Devine album, &quot;Put Your Ghost to Rest&quot;, in April 2008.

In October 2008, Crime in Stereo&#x27;s Alex Dunne revealed that Brand New were finishing the recording of a new album. In December, Brand New announced on their website that they had been in the studio since March and had roughly 15 tracks to choose from. On February 17, 2009, Brand New officially added touring guitarist Derrick Sherman to the band&#x27;s full lineup. Sherman had toured with the band since 2006 and contributed to &quot;The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me&quot;.

Brand New performed at the Glastonbury Festival on June 28, 2009, debuting two new songs tentatively titled &quot;Bride&quot; and &quot;Gasoline&quot; and delaying the release of their album to October. Brand New also played the main stage at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2009. The band&#x27;s sets at Reading and Glastonbury were both filmed by the BBC, but the band declined the BBC rights to broadcast either performance on television or online.

On July 7, 2009, Brand New announced their fourth album, &quot;And One Head Can Never Die&quot; (stylized in all lowercase), would be released on September 22, 2009, through Interscope Records. Two days later, the band changed the album&#x27;s title to &quot;Daisy.&quot; The lead single &quot;At the Bottom&quot; was released digitally on August 11. &quot;Daisy&quot; saw frontman Jesse Lacey step away from his role as the band&#x27;s primary lyricist, now sharing the duties with guitarist Vincent Accardi. The album debuted at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States, selling 46,000 records in its first week.

Brand New announced a North American tour to promote &quot;Daisy&quot;, with opening acts including Coheed and Cambria, Manchester Orchestra, Thrice and Glassjaw. A concert at their hometown Nassau Coliseum sold over 6,000 tickets in the first day. The band played its largest UK concert yet on January 23, 2010, headlining London&#x27;s Wembley Arena in front of 12,500 people supported by Glassjaw and Thrice.

===Gap between albums (2009–2017)===
After the release of &quot;Daisy,&quot; Lacey denied rumors about it being the band&#x27;s final album, but said &quot;it might be our last full-length record for a little while.&quot; Writing sessions for the band&#x27;s fifth album began in 2009, shortly after its predecessor&#x27;s release. Discussing the band&#x27;s musical direction, Lacey believed &quot;Daisy&quot; &quot;was like the end of a road&quot;. Drummer Brian Lane said in early 2010 that with the rise of digital music releases, the band could put out a new song on a weekly or monthly basis instead of via full albums.

On April 28, 2010, Brand New announced at their show in Clifton Park, New York that the band had parted ways with Interscope Records and was independent for the first time in their career. On November 21, 2011, the band reissued their debut album &quot;Your Favorite Weapon&quot; with new artwork and bonus tracks. The band was booked to enter a recording studio in April 2012, however, the members ultimately used this time for personal musical projects as opposed to recording Brand New. In June 2013, the band cancelled their upcoming European summer tour, including a main stage performance slot at the Reading and Leeds Festivals, due to &quot;insurmountable personal issues&quot;.

On June 19, 2014, Brand New announced that the band had been writing and recording new material, as well as building their own studio. Brand New played a co-headlining show with Modest Mouse at New York City&#x27;s Forest Hills Stadium on August 9, 2014, only the third show at the venue in the last 15 years.

Brand New debuted a new song, listed on the setlist as &quot;Don&#x27;t Feel Anything&quot;, on April 8, 2015, at the Fillmore Auditorium in Denver. The song was retitled &quot;Mene&quot; and made available as a free download through the band&#x27;s website on April 13, the band&#x27;s first new release in six years. A second new song, &quot;Sealed to Me&quot;, was debuted at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on April 15. That month, Brand New played Coachella for the first time, which &quot;Pitchfork&quot; noted was part of a landmark moment for emo bands being allowed to play traditionally indie rock-oriented festivals. The band also added a few European summer dates, including an appearance at Barcelona&#x27;s Primavera Sound festival. Brand New allowed their performances at Lollapalooza in Berlin on September 13, 2015, and Austin City Limits in Austin, Texas on October 3, 2015, to be broadcast. This was a first for the band, as Lacey previously stated the band was not comfortable recording their live sets.

In September 2015, an image of controversial medicine price-gouger Martin Shkreli wearing a Brand New shirt circulated on the internet. The band responded by putting the shirt on sale and donating all its proceeds to the Whitman-Walker Health center, which specializes in HIV/AIDS and LGBT healthcare.

On December 2, 2015, the band officially released the leaked demos to &quot;The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me&quot;, which had popularly become known as &quot;Fight Off Your Demons&quot; among the fanbase, under the title &quot;Leaked Demos 2006.&quot; Its first release was on a limited-edition red cassette tape with a digital download card included.&quot;&quot; On January 29, 2016, the band&#x27;s label Procrastinate! Music Traitors revealed a list of the year&#x27;s upcoming releases, including a new Brand New album. On May 17, 2016, Brand New released another new single, &quot;I Am a Nightmare&quot;, which was released to acclaim including a &quot;Best New Track&quot; honor from &quot;Pitchfork&quot;. 
In June 2016, Brand New began a co-headlining United States tour with Modest Mouse, which included a stop at New York City&#x27;s iconic Madison Square Garden. On July 13, 2016, the band released an EP called &quot;3 Demos, Reworked&quot;. The EP contains re-recorded versions of 3 songs that appear on &quot;Leaked Demos 2006&quot;. On July 22, 2016, the band released a physical 7&quot; single of &quot;Mene&quot; with the b-side &quot;Out of Range,&quot; a previously unreleased song that had been leaked in 2010.

On September 26, 2016, the band revealed that the latest album that had previously been promised to fans would not be released in 2016. The band felt that the songs on the album were incomplete and needed more time to be deemed finalized. The band also announced that it would be celebrating the 10-year anniversary of &quot;The Devil and God are Raging Inside Me&quot; by playing it in its entirety during a fall 2016 tour of the US. In November and December 2016, Brand New supported Biffy Clyro on an arena tour of the UK.

==== Breakup speculation ====
In April 2015, Brand New began sending out lyric booklets for &quot;The Devil and God are Raging Inside Me&quot; to fans who followed the liner notes&#x27; instructions to mail the band $1 for lyrics nine years ago. The booklet, named &quot;Pogolith 000&quot;, also contained a poster alluding to the release of the band&#x27;s previously unreleased 2005 &quot;Fight Off Your Demons&quot; demos on cassette tape, as well as a postcard with the words &quot;rip 2018&quot;, sparking rumors of a possible breakup of the band. As part of Record Store Day 2015, the band rereleased their second album &quot;Deja Entendu&quot; as a limited vinyl, accompanied by &quot;Pogolith 00,&quot; a booklet containing the lyrics to the album. A standard edition, non-limited vinyl was made available on May 5, 2015. Both &quot;Pogolith 000&quot; and &quot;Pogolith 00&quot; were later made available at shows and through the band&#x27;s online store.

On October 11, 2015, during a tour-ending performance at Ryman Auditorium, Lacey told the audience that &quot;this isn&#x27;t going to last much longer&quot;. He spoke about his friendships with the band, the possibility of a new album, and how he would soon be a father. During their summer 2016 tour, the band released new shirt designs which read &quot;2000–2018&quot;. One of them was projected onto the stage after the band&#x27;s set at the Vogue Theatre in Vancouver on June 2, increasing speculation that Brand New planned to break up in 2018. On June 28 in Salt Lake City, Lacey said between songs, &quot;We’re done. Oh yeah, we’re done, and it makes nights like this all the more special so thanks for being here.&quot; In September 2016, when Brand New announced that their fifth studio album would not be released that year as originally scheduled, the band issued more statements alluding to the band&#x27;s end: &quot;What&#x27;s left should be a strange demise, but hopefully one as loud and as fun as the rest of our time together has been. All are invited. Please send flowers.&quot;

===&quot;Science Fiction&quot; and disbandment (2017–2018)===
On August 15, 2017, the band announced on Instagram that their fifth LP would be released on vinyl in October 2017. Two days later on August 17, many people who had pre-ordered the vinyl edition of the album received a CD (limited to 500) in the post that contained an album in its entirety, named &quot;Science Fiction&quot;, compressed into one 61-minute long track. The album was later put up for sale on their website confirming it as their fifth LP. &quot;Science Fiction&quot; was met with widespread critical acclaim and commercial success, as it became Brand New&#x27;s first album to debut at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

On September 13, 2017, Kevin Devine announced via Facebook that he would be taking time off of his own project, Kevin Devine and the Goddamn Band, to join Brand New on their Science Fiction tour as an additional guitarist and vocalist. Nada Surf, a band Lacey has professed himself a fan of, served as the opening act for the tour. During a performance in October 2017, Lacey further confirmed the band&#x27;s end, stating &quot;We’re gonna be a band for about 14 more months, so thank you so much for being here tonight.&quot;

In November 2017, Lacey was accused of sexual misconduct occurring during the early and mid-2000s. He issued a public apology on Brand New&#x27;s Facebook page, prompting touring guitarist Kevin Devine and supporting act Martha to pull out of the upcoming European tour dates. The band later announced the postponement of all of their upcoming tour dates, which were not rescheduled. Aside from a few meetings at guitarist Accardi&#x27;s Joshua Tree home and at a Texas studio, they have remained publicly inactive since November 2017, neither confirming nor denying the break-up of the band.

On December 31, 2018, a track rumored to be titled &quot;Simple Man&quot;, alleged to have been made prior to &quot;The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me&quot;, was leaked onto the internet.

===Later developments===

On October 25, 2021, John D&#x27;Esposito, the founder of The Bamboozle musical festival, revealed that he had attempted to convince Brand New to reform and play the 2023 edition of the festival, but the band declined his request.

In December 2023, Brand New&#x27;s partnered merchandise company SCP abruptly shut down, owing over $4 million across more than 300 clients including Brand New. It is believed that clients will not get more than “cents on the dollar” in terms of what they&#x27;re owed.

On December 15, 2024, the band performed at a private charity event for friends and family at the Eastside Bowl in Nashville. The event comes approximately one year after Lacey performed solo at the same venue, also at the time limited to friends and family members. 

==Musical style and influences==
Brand New is most often described as emo, indie rock, and alternative rock,
with their debut album &quot;Your Favorite Weapon&quot; described as pop-punk.

AllMusic labeled the band as a &quot;Long Island outfit that began playing punk-pop and emo, but gradually embraced indie rock influences.&quot; In 2017, &quot;Billboard&quot; described Brand New as &quot;less a product of the old Long Island pop-punk scene they&#x27;ll frustratingly always be tied to, but more a part of a lineage of constantly-shape-shifting, steadfastly fascinating experimental rock bands, which famously includes Radiohead, but also the likes of Talk Talk, Swans, the Fall and a disparate many others.&quot;

The band has had a mixed relationship with the emo label. &quot;I think emo started on this single-faceted idea of, &#x27;I was hurt by someone else&#x27; ... but it&#x27;s only a small part of the entire spectrum of emotion that people go through. Unfortunately, the struggle against this trend of music we were grouped in with has become a large part of our band,&quot; Lacey said in 2004. Long Island concert promoter Christian McKnight said that &quot;they never really had the scene association like Taking Back Sunday, and I think a lot of that was by choice. They became more brooding and isolated, and they weren&#x27;t part of the bigger scene at large.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me&quot; is not an emo record. It might actually be post-emo.&quot;

The band has rejected the pop punk label outside of &quot;Your Favorite Weapon&quot;, an album which the band is &quot;somewhat ashamed of&quot;. Drummer Brian Lane said, &quot;We&#x27;re not a pop punk band. The first record I can easily see it. The second record, there&#x27;s nothing on it that says pop punk whatsoever... I don&#x27;t hear any influences of NOFX or anything like that.&quot; Many reviews of &quot;Deja Entendu&quot; compared Brand New to Bright Eyes, which Lane said was &quot;better than being compared to New Found Glory... that group of bands is getting old very quick and played out.&quot; Lacey criticized mainstream pop punk in a 2003 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, referring to it as music &quot;about how we&#x27;ve been wronged and got our hearts broken and nobody understands,&quot; and said that Brand New would be following in Radiohead&#x27;s footsteps rather than Good Charlotte&#x27;s.

===Influences===
Brand New has listed a wide variety of bands as influences. The band was known for naming The Smiths and their frontman Morrissey as favorites, including a reference to them on &quot;Mix Tape&quot;. Lacey taped the words &quot;Hi Moz&quot; to his guitar during the band&#x27;s 2003 performance on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;. Lacey has also cited English rock bands such as Ride, The Stone Roses and The Beatles as major influences. Brand New&#x27;s noisier elements were influenced by adolescent favorites Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine.

During the &quot;Daisy&quot; era, Lacey was influenced by Polvo, Archers of Loaf, Fugazi and Modest Mouse, Accardi cited Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Stone Temple Pilots while Tierney&#x27;s bass playing emulated Hüsker Dü and The Jesus Lizard. Brand New also paid homage to The Jesus Lizard&#x27;s album &quot;Goat&quot; with the single artwork for &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;.

Brand New have toured with a number of their influences. Built to Spill opened for them in 2015, and the band embarked on a co-headlining tour with Modest Mouse in 2016. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; recalled watching Brand New guitarist Vin Accardi play Modest Mouse&#x27;s &quot;3rd Planet&quot; prior to a show in August 2001, before the band even released their debut album. &quot;At the time, it was pretty unusual to see a pop-punk band jamming out to an indie tastemaker, but five years later, it all makes sense.&quot;

Lacey has publicly expressed his fandom for artists that did not directly influence Brand New&#x27;s sound, such as Radiohead, Björk, Bloc Party, Sigur Rós, Explosions in the Sky and Mew.

==Legacy and influence==
Brand New is renowned as one of the most important and artistically driven bands in the emo genre. In Chris Payne&#x27;s 2023 retrospective novel &quot;Where Are Your Boys Tonight?&quot;, he named Brand New &quot;arguably the most innovative and critically acclaimed band of their scene.&quot; &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; wrote, &quot;Brand New ended the need to feel ashamed for connecting to emo.&quot; NPR Music believed that Brand New&#x27;s indie rock sound &quot;free[d] the band from emo&#x27;s cultural stigma&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; described them as a &quot;cult band&quot;.

Brand New are often contrasted with mainstream-leaning 2000s emo and pop punk bands for their musical progression, lyrical maturity and focus on artistry. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; said that while their &quot;peers were making plays for superstardom, Brand New made a sprawling, iconoclastic work of art, one that challenged conventions.&quot; Ryan Bassil of &quot;Noisey&quot; declared Brand New &quot;the best band of a generation&quot; and noted how they &quot;have seemingly avoided every pitfall of the modern emo, alternative band and transcended to become something more; going beyond the music and smashing through the wall into what can only be described as art.&quot;

Music writers credited the eight-year gap between 2009&#x27;s &quot;Daisy&quot; and 2017&#x27;s &quot;Science Fiction&quot; for growing Brand New&#x27;s legacy. &quot;Stereogum&quot; noted in 2015 how the indie rock community began to critically reappraise Brand New by detaching their image from the emo and pop punk scenes that they were &quot;shepherded and pigeonholed into&quot; as a result of their debut album. Steven Hyden praised the band&#x27;s unique evolution from the &quot;conventional pop-punk&quot; of &quot;Your Favorite Weapon&quot; to the &quot;emo &quot;Abbey Road&quot;&quot; of &quot;Science Fiction&quot;. Ian Cohen of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; remarked, &quot;popular guitar music in 2017 has been undeniably shaped by Brand New, a band who has served not just as damaged role models but as a formative musical influence.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; declared that &quot;Brand New didn&#x27;t just became a band, they became a lifeline and sanctuary for thousands upon thousands of messed-up kids.&quot;

&quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; named Brand New the ninth-best pop punk band of all time.

Brand New&#x27;s influence on emo rap has also been noted. Lindsay Zoladz of &quot;The Ringer&quot; said in 2017 that &quot;your future favorite rapper might be listening to Brand New right now.&quot; Emo rapper Lil Peep sampled Brand New&#x27;s &quot;The No Seatbelt Song&quot; on his track &quot;Crybaby&quot;.

Artists influenced by Brand New include Manchester Orchestra, mewithoutYou, Cymbals Eat Guitars, Citizen, Oso Oso, Amy Shark, Sorority Noise, You Me at Six, Moose Blood and The Xcerts. Pop singer Halsey has referred to their third album in particular as a major influence and Lacey as &quot;largely responsible for why I write with such detail.&quot;

Foxing lead singer Conor Murphy pointed to a motivational speech that Lacey gave the band before their first show opening for Brand New as a pivotal moment in the band&#x27;s development. Cymbals Eat Guitars singer Joe D’Agostino said that opening for Brand New exposed the band to a wider audience that would not have discovered them had it not been for the tour. Thrice&#x27;s 2015 reunion came about after band members witnessed an inspiring Brand New concert and conversed with the band about touring again.

<text>Tyana, earlier known as Tuwana during the Iron Age, and Tūwanuwa during the Bronze Age, was an ancient city in the Anatolian region of Cappadocia, in modern Kemerhisar, Niğde Province, Central Anatolia, Turkey.

It was the capital of a Luwian-speaking Neo-Hittite kingdom in the 1st millennium BC.

==Name==
The name of the city was () during the Hittite Empire, and () in the Luwian language during the Syro-Hittite period. From the Luwian name were derived:
* the Neo-Assyrian Akkadian name of the city, (),
* and the Ancient Greek name of the city, (; ).

==Geography==
===Location===
The location of the Hittite Tūwanuwa/Neo-Hittite Tuwana/Classical Tyana corresponds to the modern-day town of Kemerhisar in Niğde Province, Turkey.

===Surroundings===
The region around Tyana, which corresponded to roughly the same area as the former Iron Age kingdom of Tuwana, was known in Classical Antiquity as Tyanitis.

==History==
According to later Hittite sources, Tūwanuwa was an important cult centre, and its local pantheon was headed by the Storm-god Tarḫunzas of Tūwanuwa and his consort, the goddess Šaḫḫaššara of Tūwanuwa.

===Bronze Age===

The city of Tūwanuwa was first mentioned in the texts of the Hittite Empire, as a city located in southeastern Anatolia, in the northern regions of the Lower Land. According to the , Tūwanuwa was part of the territories that the 17th century BC founder-king of the Hittite Old Empire, Labarna I, had conquered and which his sons divided among each other and established their rule there.

During the reign of the Hittite Middle Empire&#x27;s king Tudhaliya III, the cities of Tūwanuwa and Uda had become border towns of the forces of Arzawa after it had invaded the Lower Land. Tūwanuwa itself was attacked by Arzawa, and Hittite records of this development associated Tūwanuwa with the town of Tupazziya and Mount Ammuna. Hittite descriptions of the city suggest that Tūwanuwa itself might have been located on a hill or a mountain at this time.

The prince Suppiluliuma fought a battle against the Arzawan forces near Tūwanuwa and recaptured Tūwanuwa, which then became a base from which the Hittite forces reconquered the Lower Land from Arzawa.

Several Hittite texts associated Tūwanuwa with the cities of Nenašša and Ḫupišna, attesting that they were located close to each other. The city of Purušḫattum was also located close to Tūwanuwa.

===Iron Age===
====Neo-Hittite Kingdom of Tuwana====
After the collapse of the Hittite Empire, Tūwanuwa became the centre of the Luwian-speaking Syro-Hittite state of Tuwana in the region of Tabal, in whose southernmost regions it was located.

=====Location=====
The kingdom of Tuwana was located in southern Cappadocia and covered the territory located in the present-day province of Niğde in Turkey, lying to the east of the Konya Plain and the Obruk Plateau across Lake Tuz and the Melendiz Mountains until the Hasandağ volcano to the north, where the Erdaş and Hodul mountains formed its northern boundary by separating it from the kingdom of Tabal, while to the south it extended to the south until the Cilician Gates so that Tuwana was the first area travellers would reach after leaving Ḫiyawa to the north by passing through the Cilician Gates to cross the Taurus Mountains. Tuwana thus corresponded to the region which later in Classical Antiquity was called Tyanitis.

Tuwana was therefore located in the southern Tabalian region, of which it was the largest and most prominent kingdom, with its territory consisting of several settlements surrounding the royal capital at the city of Tuwana, although the city of Naḫitiya (modern Niğde; possibly Hittite period Naḫita) might have temporarily acted as capital under the reign of the king Sarruwannis. Another important settlement in Tuwana was the location known in Classical Antiquity as Tynna and presently as Porsuk-Zeyve Höyük.

By the 8th century BC, Tuwana&#x27;s territory included the Mount Mudi, which was likely identical with the &quot;alabaster mountain,&quot; Mount Mulî, which the Neo-Assyrian king Shalmaneser III climbed and from where he extracted alabaster during his campaign in the Tabalian region in 837 BCE. The name () was the Akkadian form of a Luwian original name () which had experienced the Luwian sound shift from to .

Based on the close association of the &quot;silver mountain,&quot; Mount Tunni, with Mount Mulî in the Neo-Assyrian records, both of these mountains were located close to each other, in the northeastern end of the Bolkar and Taurus Mountains, where are presently located the silver mines of Bulgarmaden and the gypsum mine at Porsuk-Zeyve Höyük.

=====Population=====
Tuwana was a state whose population was descended from the largely Luwian inhabitants of the former Hittite region of Tūwanuwa.

=====History=====
Tuwana might have been ruled by a single dynasty consisting of the kings Warpalawas I, followed by his son Sarruwannis, who was succeeded by his own son Muwaḫḫaranis I, himself succeeded by his son Warpalawas II, whose son and successor was Muwaḫḫaranis II.

Tuwana was spared by the Neo-Assyrian king Shalmaneser III&#x27;s invasion of the Tabalian region which he conducted in 837 BC.

======Submission to the Neo-Assyrian Empire======
By , the Tabalian region, including Tuwana, had become a tributary of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, either after the Neo-Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III&#x27;s () conquest of Arpad over the course of 743 to 740 BC caused the states of the Tabalian region to submit to him, or possibly as a result of a campaign of Tiglath-pileser III in Tabal.

Consequently, the longest reigning king of Tuwana, Warpalawas II, was mentioned in the records of the Neo-Assyrian Empire as one of five kings who offered tribute to Tiglath-Pileser III in 738 and 737 BC.
Tuwana was a powerful state under Warpalawas II, under whose reign it contained one sub-kingdom whose capital was at the site corresponding to present-day Porsuk, and whose ruler Tarḫunazzas declared himself to be the &quot;servant&quot; of Warpalawas.

By the time of the Neo-Assyrian king Sargon II (), Tuwana was one of the last still independent Tabalian kingdoms, although it was coming under the pressure of both the Neo-Assyrian Empire and the kingdom of Phrygia because of its location between these two powers, and some Old Phrygian inscriptions on basalt, possibly dated from Warpalawas II&#x27;s reign, as well as the Phrygian robe depicted as worn by Warpalawas II in his İvriz monument, suggest that aspects of Phrygian culture were arriving into Tuwana during the late 8th century BC in the time of Warpalawas II.

Warpalawas II nevertheless appears to have carried out a policy of cooperation with the Neo-Assyrian Empire, thanks to which he was able to keep his throne until the .

And, after Sargon II had annexed the kingdom of Tabal, then reorganised as the kingdom of Bīt-Burutaš, and deported its king Ambaris in 713 BC, he increased Tuwana&#x27;s territory in the broader Tabalian region by giving Warpalawas II part of the territory of Bīt-Burutaš.

======Imposition of Neo-Assyrian governorship======
Tuwana however appears to have come under direct Assyrian rule during the later years of Warpalawas II&#x27;s reign, especially following the annexation of the kingdom of Tabal, then reorganised as the kingdom of Bīt-Burutaš, and the deportation of its king Ambaris in 713 BC, after which Sargon II appointed one Aššur-šarru-uṣur as governor of Que based in Ḫiyawa who also held authority on Ḫilakku and the Tabalian region, including both Bīt-Burutaš and Tuwana.

Thus Tuwana and other nearby Anatolian kingdoms were placed the authority of Aššur-šarru-uṣur. Following the appointment of Aššur-šarru-uṣur, Warpalawas II of Tuwana and Awarikus of Ḫiyawa became largely symbolic rulers although they might have still held the power to manage their kingdoms locally.

The reason for these changes was due to the fact that, although Warpalawas II and Awarikus had been loyal Neo-Assyrian vassals, Sargon II considered them as being too elderly to be able to efficiently uphold Neo-Assyrian authority in southeastern Anatolia, where the situation had become volatile because of encroachment by the then growing power of Phrygian kingdom. Tuwana nevertheless appears to have continued to thrive as a Neo-Assyrian vassal during the rules of Warpalawas II and his son and successor, Muwaḫḫaranis II.

Some cities in these new territories from Bīt-Burutaš which Sargon II had assigned to Warpalawas II were later attacked and occupied by Atuna and Ištuanda in .

The last known king of Tuwana was Muwaḫḫaranis II, the son of Warpalawas II. As in the latter part of his father&#x27;s reign, Tuwana during the rule of Muwaḫḫaranis II was under direct rule of the Neo-Assyrian governor Aššur-šarru-uṣur.

======Regained independence======
Muwaḫḫaranis II might have continued to rule in Tabal into the 7th century BC, by which time Neo-Assyrian control of the Tabalian region had ended.

A late 8th century BC king named Masauraḫissas is also attested from an inscription at Porsuk-Zeyve Höyük, although it is uncertain whether he was the king of another state (he is commonly assumed to have been a ruler of Tunna), or whether he ruled in Tuwana after Muwaḫḫaranis II. Masauraḫissas&#x27;s name might possibly have been a Luwianisation of a Phrygian name .

By , Neo-Assyrian sources no longer referred to the local Tabalian kings, suggesting that they, including Tuwana, might have been annexed by the king Iškallû of Tabal proper, after which it became part of the united kingdom of Tabal and Melid of the king Mugallu.

The situation of Tuwana following the loss of Neo-Assyrian control over the Tabalian region after 705 BC is unknown, although the survival of the city&#x27;s name until the Classical period suggests that there was no significant cultural break there after the end of the 8th century BC.

*Sarruwannis (), 
*Muwaḫḫaranis I (), 
*Warpalawas II ( ), 
* Muwaḫḫaranis II (), 
*Masauraḫissas ? ()

=== Hellenistic period ===


By the Graeco-Roman period, the city became known as Tyana (; ), and the country around it as Tyanitis (; ).

In Greek legend, the city was first called Thoana because Thoas, a Thracian king, was its founder (Arrian, &quot;Periplus Ponti Euxini&quot;, vi); it was in Cappadocia, at the foot of the Taurus Mountains and near the Cilician Gates (Strabo, XII, 537; XIII, 587). According to Strabo the city was renamed as &quot;Eusebeia at the Taurus&quot;, likely due to its refoundation by Ariarathes V Eusebes. In the first century B.C., the city had a gymnasium.

Xenophon mentions it in his book &quot;Anabasis&quot;, under the name of &quot;Dana&quot;, as a large and prosperous city. The surrounding plain was known after it as &quot;Tyanitis&quot;.

=== Roman period ===
In the first century of Roman rule of Cappadocia, the city was one of the only four major &quot;cities&quot; in the region and among those the most hellenised and therefore the closest to a Roman city. Tyana is the reputed birthplace of the celebrated philosopher (and reputed saint or magician) Apollonius of Tyana in the first century AD. Ovid (Metamorphoses VIII) places the tale of Baucis and Philemon in the vicinity.

Under Roman Emperor Caracalla, the city became &quot;Antoniana colonia Tyana&quot;. After having sided first with the Sassanid ruler Shapur in 260 and then Queen Zenobia of Palmyra, it was captured by emperor Aurelian in 272, who would not allow his soldiers to sack it, allegedly because Apollonius appeared to him. It is more likely though that the city was its strategic importance in a fertile plain and as a major stop linking Anatolia with Cilicia.

In 372, Emperor Valens split the province of Cappadocia in two, and Tyana became the capital and metropolis of &quot;Cappadocia Secunda&quot;, and the city was sometimes referred to as Christoupolis () in Late Antiquity. Due to its location, the city was on one of the major Christian pilgrim routes in the empire and also had its own local saints such as Orestes, who according to tradition was martyred in Late Antiquity in Tyana and remained a venerated figure in Cappadocia up to the tenth century at least.

===Byzantine period===

In the fifth century, Cooper and Decker estimate that the city had possibly a population of no more than 10,000. Being located around 30 km to the north of the Cilician Gates, Tyana lied on the main road between Constantinople and the Levant. Following the Muslim conquests and the establishment of the frontier between the Byzantine Empire and the Caliphate along the Taurus Mountains, this made Tyana a recurrent target of raids by the Umayyad and then Abbasid Caliphates in 708, 806 and 831:
*the city was first sacked by the Umayyads after a long siege in 708, and remained deserted for some time before being rebuilt
*it was then occupied by the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid in 806. Harun began converting the city into a military base and even erected a mosque there, but evacuated it after the Byzantine emperor Nikephoros I bought a peace.

The city was again taken and razed by the Abbasids under Al-Abbas ibn al-Ma&#x27;mun in 831. Abbas rebuilt the site three years later as an Abbasid military colony in preparation for Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s planned conquest of Byzantium, but after Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s sudden death in August 833 the campaign was abandoned by his successor al-Mu&#x27;tasim and the half-rebuilt city was razed again.

Tyana finally entered into a permanent phase of decline after 933 and was replaced by a number of nearby settlements. In the Middle and Late Byzantine periods the city recovered somewhat as a place of relative agricultural and commercial importance, but it never hosted more than a few thousand inhabitants.

===Modern period===
Insignificant ruins of the Byzantine city are still visible at the site of Tyana in the present.

==Ecclesiastical history==
As noted, in 372 Emperor Valens created the province of &quot;Cappadocia Secunda&quot;, of which Tyana became the metropolis. This aroused a violent controversy between Anthimus, Bishop of Tyana, and St. Basil of Caesarea, each of whom wished to have as many suffragan sees as possible. About 640 Tyana had three, and it was the same in the tenth century (Heinrich Gelzer, &quot;Ungedruckte ... Texte der Notitiae episcopatum&quot;, 538, 554).

Le Quien mentions 28 bishops of Tyana, among whom were:
*Eutychius, at Nice in 325
*Anthimus, the rival of St. Basil
*Aetherius, at Constantinople in 381
*Theodore, the friend of St. John Chrysostom
*Eutherius, the partisan of Nestorius, deposed and exiled in 431
*Cyriacus, a Severian Monophysite.

In May 1359, Tyana still had a metropolitan (Mikelosich and Müller, &quot;Acta patriarchatus Constantinopolitani&quot;, I, 505); in 1360 the metropolitan of Caesarea secured the administration of it (op. cit., 537). Thenceforth the see was titular.

In 2020, during excavations the archaeologists discovered an octagonal church and coins dated to the 4th century.

<doc id="728825" wikidata="Q629056" url="?curid=728825" title="White Rock, British Columbia">
<text>White Rock is a city in British Columbia, Canada, and a member municipality of the Metro Vancouver Regional District. It is bordered by Semiahmoo Bay to the south and is surrounded on three sides by Surrey. To the southeast across a footbridge lies the Semiahmoo First Nation, which is within the borders of Surrey. Semiahmoo Bay and the Southern Gulf Islands in the Strait of Georgia are also to the south.

White Rock is named for a large white boulder on its beach near the promenade, a glacial erratic that migrated south during the last glaciation. The 486-ton granite boulder was kept white by shellfish-eating seabirds whose guano covered the rock so much that 19th-century sailors used it as a beacon. It is now kept white through monthly applications of white paint by the city parks department and has been a graffiti target. The White Rock Pier is located nearby.

==History==
===Early history===

The Straits Salish people dominated the region from Boundary Bay in the north to Birch Bay in the south (in the U.S.). Semiahmoo First Nation permanent encampments were known to exist between 1791, the first European contact, and the 1850s, the beginnings of European settlement. These were located along the waterfront at the eastern and western limits of the present City of White Rock. The Semiahmoo people also constructed forts as lookouts for raiders from the northern first nations; one is located in the Ocean Park area.

The Oregon boundary dispute culminated in the Oregon Treaty of 1846, which settled the outstanding border issues between Great Britain and the United States. Previously, these issues had been put on hold through a shared occupancy agreement of the Oregon territory by the two nations in the Treaty of 1818. In turn, the International Boundary Survey Commission began in 1857 to set the boundary between the United States and British North America, roughly along the 49th parallel, which runs through Semiahmoo Bay and Boundary Bay to Point Roberts, Washington.

The Semiahmoo Trail still exists in White Rock and South Surrey, running from the site of the Boundary Commission Camp at the estuary of the Campbell River, overland to Mud Bay north of Crescent Beach. An 1865 survey map calls this route the &quot;Telegraph Trail&quot;. During the real-estate boom of the 1980s and 90s, the City of Surrey preserved much of the trail, extending it from 20 Avenue to the Nicomekl River. On 148 Street, a specially constructed &quot;Semiahmoo Trail&quot; pedestrian overpass keeps the trail intact.

===Modern history===
The modern history of White Rock is directly tied to the railway linking British Columbia to Washington state, which runs along the shore of Semiahmoo Bay to the border. The rail is currently owned by BNSF Railway and runs alongside the promenade at the beach. This was originally the Great Northern line, and it opened up White Rock and Crescent Beach to tourists from Vancouver and New Westminster in the early 1900s. The border crossing closest to White Rock (at Douglas, Surrey, and Blaine, Washington) was officially opened in 1908, and the Peace Arch at the border crossing was constructed in the 1920s.

In 1913, the present railway station was opened, and the Fox and Hunter Shingle mill began operation. The Campbell River Mill also opened to the east, bringing a minor boom in the local economy. The now-famous pier was opened in 1914 to provide a deep-water mooring facility.

In the 1950s, White Rock residents began to feel isolated from the then–District of Surrey, where development was being concentrated elsewhere, particularly in North Surrey and Cloverdale. On April 15, 1957, a special warrant from the Government of British Columbia created the City of White Rock within its present boundary.

In the 1950s, Peace Arch Hospital opened and continues as a major employer in the city and health facility for the region.

Development was concentrated near the waterfront until the 1960s and 1970s. Many small cliffside dwellings were affordable to those unable to pay the cost of living closer to Vancouver. White Rock gained a reputation for being a retirement centre, as it features the lowest rainfall in the Metro Vancouver region, while benefitting from the influence of the ocean, keeping both summers highs and winter lows bearable.

The development of Highway 99 and the opening of the Deas Island Tunnel (now the George Massey Tunnel) created a second boom for the White Rock area, providing a more convenient commuter route to Vancouver. No longer dependent upon the railway, development crept up the hillside. In the 1980s, the City of Surrey designated South Surrey as a town centre comparable to Guildford, Cloverdale, and Newton. The Semiahmoo Mall opened in Surrey on the north side of 16 Avenue (the south side of which is North Bluff Road within White Rock).

In 1979, chartered accountant Tom Kirstein and architect Chip Barrett organized an annual sandcastle competition, which became internationally famous. The event took advantage of the long, sandy beach exposed at low tide, giving enough time for entrants to construct elaborate displays. Prizes of up to $10,000 were awarded, and crowds of 150,000 were estimated at the competition&#x27;s height. In 1987, the contest was ended because of security costs and concerns. In 2008, a group of local high school students (Sara Woodward, Jorden Abernethy, Daniel Fowler, Michael Vanderpolder, and Tasha Svenson) and members of the community (Spenser Bolen, Michael Nolan, Trixie Nolan, and Lisa Nolan) launched a Sandcastle Competition revival. This competition drew 40,000 guests and over 70 teams.

The 1970s saw the White Rock/South Surrey area develop into a suburban bedroom community of the Lower Mainland. A real-estate boom in the area drew many young families to homes marketed to young professionals, a process that intensified in the mid-1990s. Today, many parts of the community resemble the type of suburban development seen across North America. Some cliffside cottages have given way to large homes, and multimillion-dollar properties have appeared in the area.

Uptown White Rock has been the site of significant new developments in recent years, with medium-rise condos becoming more prominent. The City of White Rock&#x27;s fire department was located half a block north of its city limits until the early 1990s, when a new firehall was built across from City Hall. The White Rock Little League team played in the 2007 Little League World Series.

On December 20, 2018, during a severe windstorm, the White Rock Pier was severed when sailboats broke free from the attached marina and crashed into the pier destroying a 30-metre section. At least 15 boats sank and several were wedged underneath the pier&#x27;s pilings. Replacement plans call for a new pier that could be built by the end of August 2019, with an early cost estimate that is projected to be over $5 million. As of May 2, 2019, the cost estimate for a rebuild to modern seismic standards is $16.2 million. On August 28, 2019, the pier re-opened to the public although certain elements such as lighting have yet to be completed. Darryl Walker has been mayor since 2018.

==Geography==
The boundaries between White Rock and Surrey are Bergstrom Road (136 Street) to the west, North Bluff Road (16th Avenue) to the north, Stayte Road (160 Street) to the east, and 8th Avenue to the south. The area south of 8 Avenue from Stayte Road westward to where 8 Avenue meets the water is the Semiahmoo Indian Reserve and lies within the bounds of the City of Surrey (though it is governed separately). The Surrey neighbourhoods of Ocean Park and Crescent Beach lie immediately to the northwest.

===Climate===
White Rock has a moderate climate, with average daily high temperatures of 23 degrees Celsius in summer and 6 degrees Celsius in winter.

White Rock&#x27;s climate is moderate year-round. Because the city is set away from the Coast Mountains, it sees less fog, fewer rainy days and shorter snowfalls. Meteorological statistics show that White Rock does, in fact, receive 20 percent more sunshine than does Vancouver. Temperatures average in summer and in winter. Annual rainfall averages .
==Demographics==
In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, White Rock had a population of 21,939 living in 10,735 of its 11,541 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 19,952. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

=== Ethnicity ===
=== Religion ===

According to the 2021 census, religious groups in White Rock included:
*Irreligion (9,855 persons or 47.6%)
*Christianity (8,875 persons or 42.8%)
*Sikhism (905 persons or 4.4%)
*Hinduism (245 persons or 1.2%)
*Islam (205 persons or 1.0%)
*Buddhism (160 persons or 0.8%)
*Judaism (115 persons or 0.6%)
*Other (360 persons or 1.7%)

==Annual events==
Every year in July, the city hosts the Tour de White Rock, a bicycle road race that attracts over 150 local and international riders. In 2005, the event was part of the Canadian Cycling Association&#x27;s national Road Race Series.

Every year during the first weekend of August, the Spirit of the Sea Festival is held on White Rock beach. It usually includes a parade, fireworks, music stages, a sandcastle competition, and various other beach-related activities. The festival began in 1949.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Transportation in White Rock largely revolves around the automobile. Highway 99 is a freeway that links the White Rock area with Vancouver to the north and U.S. Interstate 5, via the Peace Arch border crossing, to the south. King George Highway (Highway 99A) links the Peace Arch border with Surrey Central station and New Westminster via the soon-to-be-replaced Pattullo Bridge. Johnston Road (152 Street) links White Rock to Guildford and the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1).

Most of White Rock&#x27;s bus routes run through the White Rock Centre transit exchange. From there, the 351 and 354 buses, which previously ran to downtown Vancouver, now terminate at Bridgeport station in Richmond; Vancouver-bound passengers have to transfer onto the Canada Line rapid transit line. Only one route serving the area, the 352 Ocean Park/Bridgeport Station express bus, does not run through White Rock Centre, instead terminating near the South Surrey Athletic Park. The 321, 345, and 394 buses provide service to North Surrey, notably to Surrey Central and King George Skytrain stations, and the 375 service runs through White Rock Centre from just north of the Peace Arch border crossing to Guildford Town Centre. The 531 bus runs from White Rock Centre to Willowbrook Mall in Langley. Community Shuttle routes, the 360, 361, 362, and 363, service local communities within White Rock and South Surrey.

BNSF Railway has a single-track main line through White Rock that runs the length of the White Rock beach promenade. The city itself has no train service; however, this rail line is a major corridor for goods transported between the ports of Vancouver and the continental U.S., as well as for the Amtrak Cascades passenger service between Seattle and Vancouver via Bellingham, Washington. The Canadian National Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) also have trackage rights along the line. Goods transported on the corridor include Canadian softwood lumber, coal, paper products, and general merchandise. The CPR runs regular potash trains along the line to the Canpotex export terminal in Oregon.

<doc id="728832" wikidata="Q4861008" url="?curid=728832" title="Barkhamsted Hollow, Connecticut">
<text>Barkhamsted Hollow was a village in northwestern Connecticut. It was part of the town of Barkhamsted, Connecticut in Litchfield County, Connecticut, incorporated as part of Barkhamsted in 1779. It was flooded by the creation of the Barkhamsted Reservoir in 1940, splitting Barkhamsted and the nearby town of Hartland, Connecticut in half.

== History ==
The reservoir was conceived to address the water needs of Hartford, Connecticut. The earthen Saville Dam was built to stem the east branch of the Farmington River, thus creating the reservoir. The dam was named for the project&#x27;s chief engineer, Caleb Mills Saville.

According to Paul Hart, Barkhamsted Historical Society, as quoted at Connecticut Routes:

&quot;The Saville Dam, which backs up the Barkhamsted Reservoir, was completed in 1940. I believe it took several years for the reservoir to fill with water.

&quot;The reservoir covers what was private land—mostly small farms. The property was bought by the Metropolitan District Commission of Connecticut mostly during the depression years. On the Barkhamsted side, there was one village, known as Barkhamsted Hollow that was covered with water. This was located at a crossroads about a mile north of the dam and on the east side of the river. There was a store, church and a few other buildings here. Several roads were put underwater, including a north/south road that followed the river on the east side. There were many house locations that were covered by the water, and even more that were bought and torn down or moved that were not covered by water but were located on the watershed property now owned by the water company.&quot;

The site of the one-room Center Schoolhouse was not covered with water. The building stood just off the west shore of the reservoir for many years until the Historical Society moved it to the current location on Route 181 about 1980.

<doc id="728836" wikidata="Q1332" url="?curid=728836" title="Ramón Freire">
<text>Ramón Saturnino Andrés Freire y Serrano (; November 29, 1787 – December 9, 1851) was a Chilean political figure. He was head of state on several occasions, and enjoyed a numerous following until the War of the Confederation. Ramón Freire was one of the principal leaders of the liberal &quot;Pipiolo&quot; movement. He has been praised by historian Gabriel Salazar as the most democratic leader of the early republican period in Chile.

==Early life==
He was born in Santiago on November 29, 1787, the son of Francisco Antonio Freire y Paz and Gertrudis Serrano y Arrechea. An orphan from early age, he was raised in a hacienda by his maternal uncles near the town of Colina. He became an orphan again at age 16, and moved to the city of Concepción where he worked as a clerk in a store, and later as an apprentice in a merchant ship.

==War of Independence==
At the beginning of the independence struggle in 1810, he became actively involved in the public meetings that accompanied the establishment of the first Junta. In 1811, he became a cadet of the Dragones de la Frontera, and participated in the battles of Huilquilemu, Talcahuano, El Roble and El Quilo during the Chilean War of Independence.

By the time of the Rancagua disaster and the end of the Patria Vieja, he was already a captain. With many others he crossed the Andes and went into exile to Buenos Aires. In 1816 he joined the Army of the Andes, and returned to Chile as a battalion commander through the Planchón Pass (in southern Chile), occupying the city of Talca on February 11, 1817.

He fought at the battle of Maipú, was promoted to colonel for his services to the independence, and named Intendant of Concepción under the O&#x27;Higgins administration. His friendship with O&#x27;Higgins started to crack by degrees, until in 1822 he resigned his position in disagreement. His name became a rallying point for the discontents with O&#x27;Higgins, but the two of them never came to an armed conflict.

==As Supreme Director==
After the resignation of O&#x27;Higgins, he became the new Supreme Director, a position he held from April 4, 1823 (when he was named by the Junta de Representantes that replaced O&#x27;Higgins) until July 9, 1826. After a brief interlude, he returned to the office on January 25, 1827. His new resignation on February 5, 1827 was not accepted, and he was elected president on February 15 of the same year. He resigned again on the following May 5, 1827.

During his administration he promoted some initiatives of enormous impact, such as the abolition of slavery, the reorganization of the defense system of the port of Valparaíso, and opening Chilean markets to world commerce. He also highlighted the freedom of the press and ordered all convents and monasteries to open free schools.

On December 29, 1823 he promulgated a new constitution, based on the project presented by Juan Egaña. Considered a highly moralistic document, it reflected the idea that the very essence of the people can be changed by its laws. It tried to regulate both the public and private conduct of the citizens. Such approach very soon proved impracticable, and the Constitution was abandoned after only six months.

Since the Chilean treasury was exhausted by the independence wars, and heavily mortgaged by the first foreign loan, contracted with British banks, Freire created a government monopoly (estanco) over tobacco, alcohols, cards and tax paper, same that was assigned to Portales, Cea and Co. and turned in a huge fiasco. This affair marked the first involvement in public government of the future universal minister, Diego Portales.

He also completed the independence of the whole territory when he captured Chiloé Island, which was still held by Spain. After failed military campaigns in 1824 that ended in defeat at Mocopulli, and the 1826 battles of Pudeto and Bellavista, he signed the Treaty of Tantauco, in which Spain definitively renounced claims to that area.

===Muzi mission===
At about the same time, an apostolic mission arrived in Chile, sent by the Pope, and headed by Monsignor Juan Muzi. The object of the mission was to fix the relations between Chile and the Holy See. A conflict soon developed because Chile felt it had inherited the rights of patronage held by the Spanish crown, and the Holy See felt differently. In the interim, the government had adopted several measures asserting its control over the church, such as the reformation of the monastic orders, the seizure of church property, and the exile of a bishop who had actively opposed independence. Monsignor Muzi was adamant in its refusal, and asked for his passports, severing relations between the two states.

In the domestic arena, conflicts, especially with the supporters of O&#x27;Higgins, worsened to such a point that Freire was dismissed during a campaign in 1825, being reinstated upon his return. Nonetheless, the multiple conflicts forced Freire to resign on July 9, 1826, handing over the power to Admiral Manuel Blanco Encalada, who assumed with the new title of &quot;President of the Republic&quot;.

==As President==
A new revolution brought him back to power on January 25, 1827 as Provisional President. After order was restored, he resigned again on February 5, but his resignation was rejected by Congress, who proceeded to confirm him as president on February 15. He finally resigned on May 5, 1827.

During his period there was the attempt, headed by José Miguel Infante, to establish a federal system of government. In fact, the Chilean Congress dictated a number of laws to that effect. The idea was to formulate a federative republic based on the example of the United States. Many conflicts erupted among the new States-Provinces that made the new system collapse very quickly.

===Cabinet===
==Later life==

Originally he retired to the Cucha-cucha Hacienda, but shortly afterwards returned to political infighting in the Chilean Civil War of 1829. His final defeat came at the battle of Lircay. He was then imprisoned and later sent into exile in Peru. In Peru, and with the help of Marshal Andrés de Santa Cruz, he outfitted a small expedition and attempted to capture the island of Chiloé. After failing in his purpose, he was again imprisoned at the port of Valparaíso, court-martialled, and exiled first to the island of Juan Fernández, and afterwards to Tahiti and in 1837 temporarily resettled in Australia.

He was allowed to return to Chile in 1842, where he lived peacefully until his death on December 9, 1851.

<doc id="728838" wikidata="Q1335631" url="?curid=728838" title="Emery (band)">
<text>Emery is an American post-hardcore band formed in Rock Hill, South Carolina, in 2001 by Toby Morrell, Devin Shelton, Matt Carter, Josh Head, Joel Green, and Seth Studley. The band relocated to Seattle in order to reach a more music-centered scene.

Before signing with Tooth &amp; Nail Records, Emery recorded two EPs, &quot;The Columbus EEP Thee&quot; and &quot;The Weak&#x27;s End&quot; demo that they used to attract attention from labels. With Tooth &amp; Nail, they recorded five studio albums and two EPs. &quot;The Weak&#x27;s End&quot;, their debut album, was released in 2004, followed by &quot;The Question&quot; in 2005 and &quot;I&#x27;m Only a Man&quot; in 2007. The latter fulfilled Emery&#x27;s contract with Tooth &amp; Nail. However, the band re-signed with the label and released &quot;...In Shallow Seas We Sail&quot; on June 2, 2009, and &quot;We Do What We Want&quot; on March 29, 2011. After signing with BadChristian Music, the band released &quot;You Were Never Alone&quot; on May 19, 2015, and &quot;Eve&quot; on November 9, 2018.

== History ==

=== Early years (2000–2010) ===

Emery formed in 2001 in Rock Hill, South Carolina, but moved to Seattle in search of a better musical environment. The band was named after a first grader that Toby Morrell met while working as an intern for a teacher in college. The four members in the band at the time, Toby Morrell (vocals/guitar), Devin Shelton (drums), Matt Carter (guitar/keyboards), and Joel &quot;Chopper&quot; Green (bass) left Rock Hill for Seattle on September 11, the day of the terrorist attacks; they found out about the attacks when they stopped at a Cracker Barrel restaurant in North Carolina. Most of the members are from the bands Sachul, Joe 747, Simply Waynes and Oogie Brown. After a little while Seth Studley, who was one of the original members of the band, broke out of a serious relationship and followed them to Seattle and resumed his post as drummer. Because Seth took over drums, Devin took the position of guitarist.

After making Emerald City their new home in Seattle, Emery signed a record deal with Tooth &amp; Nail Records, also of Seattle, in 2002. Wasting no time, Emery paired up with producer/engineer Ed Rose and worked on their debut album, &quot;The Weak&#x27;s End&quot;. It was produced at the Black Lodge Studio in Eudora, Kansas. The record was released in January 2004 by Tooth &amp; Nail Records. Emery toured extensively to promote their new release.

While touring, Seth Studley decided to leave the band in order to get married and Emery had to look for a new drummer. While touring with Haste the Day, Dave Powell was brought out to audition. Powell was officially put in the band in November 2005. Powell originally played in the Indianapolis-based metalcore/hardcore band The Bowels of Judas.

Soon after touring, Emery went back into the studio to record their next record with production done by Aaron Sprinkle this time around. The band took five weeks in recording sessions. &quot;The Question&quot; was released on August 2, 2005. &quot;Studying Politics&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single with a video emerging on June 29, 2005. On November 21, 2006, Emery re-released &quot;The Question&quot;, adding a DVD, five acoustic versions of previously recorded songs and two new demo tracks, which were produced by Matt Carter. The DVD included a documentary film of Emery, live songs and bonus footage.

After the re-release, Joel &quot;Chopper&quot; Green was asked to leave the band. On September 19, 2006, Emery posted a blog on their website explaining the departure. After Green&#x27;s departure, Devin and Toby both took over duty as bassist. Typically, whoever doesn&#x27;t have lead vocals on a song is the one playing bass.

While touring with Underoath in Australia, Emery announced that they were releasing a new album, &quot;I&#x27;m Only a Man&quot;, which leaked onto the internet before its official release on October 2, 2007. It was produced by Ryan Boesch and Matt Carter and recorded at Dark Horse Recording Studio in Tennessee. It received mixed reviews. Emery released a deluxe edition of the album as well, which featured four acoustic songs that were recorded while on the Take Action Tour with The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus and DVD with live footage and a documentary. The iTunes version of the deluxe edition also added a bonus track called &quot;Whoa! Man&quot;.

Emery announced in an interview on TVU that they finished a new 8-track EP entitled &quot;While Broken Hearts Prevail&quot;, which was released on October 28, 2008. They began premiering some of the new material while on tour opening for The Almost, including &quot;Edge of the World&quot;.

In an interview with Toby Morrell, Emery announced that they would be releasing a new album called &quot;...In Shallow Seas We Sail&quot;. Up until the announcement of Emery re-signing to Tooth &amp; Nail Records, it was unsure if the band would seek a new label, since their contract had expired. They re-signed with Tooth &amp; Nail and soon gave out information on their new release.

On April 7, 2009, Emery released a new song entitled &quot;Cutthroat Collapse&quot; on their Myspace, Purevolume, and iTunes. On May 29, 2009, Emery put &quot;...In Shallow Seas We Sail&quot; in its entirety up on their Myspace. On June 2, 2009, &quot;...In Shallow Seas We Sail&quot; was officially released. Emery also confirmed during a chat thread on AbsolutePunk that their first music video off of the new album was going to be &quot;Cutthroat Collapse&quot;.

During their headlining U.S. tour, Emery had selected dates filmed for a DVD in the works. The release date is unknown at this time. Emery set out on tour supporting Underoath on their fall/winter headlining tour for the rest of the year. In the summer of 2010 they went on the &quot;Scream it Like You Mean it&quot; tour with Silverstein, Ivoryline, Dance Gavin Dance, We Came as Romans, Sky Eats Airplane, and I Set My Friends on Fire.

=== Recent activity (2011–present) ===

On January 26, 2011, it was announced that the band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;We Do What We Want&quot;, was set to be released on March 29, 2011. The band also released a clip of a song titled &quot;Scissors&quot;. Another song titled &quot;Curse of Perfect Days&quot; was released to Christian rock radio stations.

On January 31, 2011, vocalist, rhythm guitarist, and bassist Devin Shelton announced he was taking an &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot; from Emery.
On February 1, 2011, a song titled &quot;The Cheval Glass&quot; was released on the band&#x27;s Facebook, YouTube and Myspace page. On February 17, 2011, the band announced that &quot;We Do What We Want&quot; would be released through both Tooth &amp; Nail and their hardcore/metal subdivision Solid State Records reflecting the heavier sound of the album. &quot;Lyrically I think this is our most personal, spiritual album. It talks about our faith and God, but it never gets too preachy, because it&#x27;s basically talking about me and things I&#x27;ve gone through,&quot; shares Morrell. &quot;I can&#x27;t not tell the truth of who I am, and this time I explored that even further — just points in my life, or in the other guys&#x27; lives. Some lyrics are about challenging authority and God, and is God real, and what that even means. &quot; 

Emery headlined the &quot;Do What You Want&quot; tour alongside the bands To Speak of Wolves, and Hawkboy (formerly As Cities Burn). While on tour, the band has announced that they would be coming out with an acoustic album. On March 28, 2011, Emery released a stream of their new album &quot;We Do What We Want&quot; on AOL.com.

On May 9, 2011, Emery released a music video for the song &quot;The Cheval Glass&quot;. On August 9 they released a music video for the song &quot;Scissors&quot;.

On October 18, 2011, Tooth &amp; Nail released &quot;Ten Years&quot;, a compilation album gleaned from Emery&#x27;s first four albums. In 2012, Matt Carter and Toby Morrell worked on the acoustic project titled &quot;Matt &amp; Toby&quot;. As a result, a self-titled album was released on November 19, 2012, through Tooth &amp; Nail Records. In the support of the album Matt &amp; Toby toured a &quot;Living Room Tour&quot; in October–November 2012 and January–February 2013. During the shows they played songs from the album as well as Emery songs and some covers in acoustic.

In 2013, Emery left Tooth &amp; Nail/Solid State Records and established their own label, BadChristian Music. In 2013–2014, Emery played a two-part The Weak&#x27;s End 10th Anniversary tour where it was joined by Devin Shelton.

In March 2014, the band released a demo of two new songs. The album &quot;You Were Never Alone&quot;, funded via crowdfunding, was set to be released in mid-2014 but the release date was later pushed back. On April 28, 2015, the band released a music video for the song &quot;Hard Times&quot;. &quot;You Were Never Alone&quot; was released on May 19, 2015, via BadChristian Music, and it appeared on several &quot;Billboard&quot; charts: No. 69 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, No. 1 on Top Christian Albums, No. 6 on Independent Albums, No. 8 on Alternative Music No. 10 on Top Rock Albums and No. 31 on Top Album Sales.

In June 2015, guitarist Matt Carter began releasing his podcast &quot;Break It Down With Matt Carter&quot;. The first 12 episodes were a track-by-track breakdown of &quot;You Were Never Alone&quot; featuring interview with other band members, producers, and friends from other bands. In October 2015, Carter and Morrell released a two-part episode of the &quot;Break It Down&quot; podcast explaining how &quot;You Were Never Alone&quot; is a concept album, with each song&#x27;s lyrics inspired by a story from the Bible.

On December 14, 2015, the band released an eight-track EP, &quot;We Wish You Emery Christmas&quot;, as a free download.

On April 30, 2016, Emery released an &quot;Emery Acoustic: Live in Houston&quot; EP.

On March 17, 2017, Emery started a crowdfunding campaign for the next album with the $50,000 goal reached one day after the campaign start. Every backer was given an instant download of &quot;Emery: Classics Reimagined EP&quot; including re-done versions of &quot;So Cold I Can See My Breath&quot;, &quot;As Your Voice Fades&quot;, and &quot;The Smile, The Face&quot;.

On November 17, 2017, Emery released &quot;Revival: Emery Classic Reimagined&quot;, an album containing all three tracks from &quot;Emery: Classics Reimagined EP&quot; plus seven more songs from the band&#x27;s catalogue rearranged in acoustic.

On November 9, 2018, Emery released their seventh album: &quot;Eve&quot;.

On June 5, 2020, Emery released their eighth album: &quot;White Line Fever&quot;. The band has stated on social media that the album&#x27;s themes are built heavily around the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and where the band was during the occurrence of the events, as they&#x27;d just left their home town and departed for Seattle the day of.

In 2021, Emery released &quot;I&#x27;m Only a Man (Studio Update)&quot; — a new, rerecorded from scratch, remixed and remastered version of their 2007 album &quot;I&#x27;m Only A Man&quot; — and three live albums, &quot;The Weak&#x27;s End (Live Version)&quot;, &quot;The Question Live&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Only a Man (Live Version)&quot;. On November 23, 2021, Emery released a live captured version of their upcoming studio album &quot;Rub Some Dirt on It&quot;.

== Style ==
While the band avoid the stigma of being labeled a &quot;Christian band&quot;, the members are all Christian, exploring a wide variety of lyrical themes in their music.
The band sound varies between post-hardcore, melodic hardcore, emo, hard rock, alternative rock, and metalcore.

== BadChristian &amp; Knuckle Breakers ==
Toby Morrell, Matt Carter and their friend, pastor and former Emery bassist Joey Svendsen used to run a blog called &quot;Un-learning&quot;, where they wrote about moral and religious issues. The intent was usually to hold open discussions about sensitive topics, while getting a variety of different viewpoints (Christian, atheist, etc.) 

In 2013, &quot;Un-learning&quot; was rebooted as &quot;BadChristian&quot;. In addition to being a blog, &quot;BadChristian&quot; also serves as a podcast where the three host discussions with guests such as Underoath, Norma Jean, Thrice etc. &quot;BadChristian&quot; also serves as the band&#x27;s own label titled &quot;BC Music&quot;. The label roster includes Emery, Matt &amp; Toby, The Classic Crime, Vocal Few, Kings Kaleidoscope, Abandon Kansas, Pacific Gold, Zach Bolen (of Citizens &amp; Saints) and House of Heroes.

In 2014, &quot;BadChristian&quot; published books &quot;BadChristian, Great Savior&quot; and &quot;The M Word&quot;.

In 2015, &quot;BadChristian&quot; released the BadChristian app for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. It provides free mobile access to the BC blog, podcasts and some of the BC Music artist music. Also, in 2015, BadChristian published a third ebook, &quot;BadChristian Tackles the Lighter Topics&quot;.

In 2021, BadChristian&#x27;s YouTube channel containing all the material since 2013, was renamed to &quot;Knuckle Breakers&quot;. 

On November 24, 2021, Emery released a video version of their ninth studio album, &quot;Rub Some Dirt On It&quot;, via Knuckle Breakers YouTube Channel.

== Side projects ==

* Toby Morrell had a side project entitled I Am Waldo. The music is based on the book of Psalms and mostly acoustic.
* Devin Shelton&#x27;s side project was called Devinitely. Initially, his music was mostly R&amp;B and was made using GarageBand. After parting ways with Emery in 2011, Shelton decided to play solo under his own name and released a debut album, &quot;Life &amp; Death&quot;, on January 22, 2013. It features 10 tracks, including an alternative version of &quot;Crumbling&quot;, which was originally released as a bonus track for Emery&#x27;s &quot;We Do What We Want&quot; (2011). Shelton released his follow-up album, &quot;Sensation&quot;, on January 6, 2017. It features 12 tracks.
* Dave Powell is in an indie rock band called Beyond Oceans with Jason Barnes and Brennan Chaulk (both formerly of Haste the Day). In early 2013, he agreed to play drums on the upcoming reunion/farewell album by Trenches, but later was replaced by original band drummer Zach Frizzell.
* Matt Carter and Toby Morrell joined forces to create a side project named Matt and Toby Band. They released one full length, self-titled album in October 2012 under this side project and were on various living room tours in the United States following its release.

<doc id="728840" wikidata="Q929814" url="?curid=728840" title="Takayuki Nakamura">
<text>is a Japanese video game music composer and musician, who worked at Sega from 1989 to 1996 and contributed to games such as &quot;OutRunners&quot; and the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series. After leaving in 1996, he joined Dream Factory and composed for &quot;Tobal 2&quot; and &quot;Ehrgeiz&quot;. He founded the music production company Brainstorm Co. Ltd. in 1999, where he has most notably worked on the &quot;Lumines&quot; series and &quot;Rodea the Sky Soldier&quot;.

==Biography==
Nakamura was raised in a household that actively listened to music. During elementary school, he recorded songs from the radio and make his own mix tapes. After becoming a middle school student, he started to play the guitar, being inspired by artists such as Toto and Van Halen. During his high school years he got into jazz artists such as Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, and Sadao Watanabe. He started a T-Square cover band with friends at college; as he was studying business, he did not get any musical education, but still wanted to pursue a career in music. He worked part-time jobs to raise money for music equipment, purchasing a Roland MC-300 sequencer. This led to him applying as a composer for game companies.

Nakamura worked part-time at Sega in 1989 on the Sega Genesis version of &quot;Michael Jackson&#x27;s Moonwalker&quot;. He recalls transcribing Michael Jackson&#x27;s song &quot;Bad&quot; into MML and also composed a boss battle theme from scratch. He also composed for &quot;&quot; and &quot;Columns II&quot; along with senior composer Y. Takada. He joined as a full-time composer in 1990, and composed for games such as the Genesis version of &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; and the Master System version of &quot;Michael Jackson&#x27;s Moonwalker&quot;. He also worked on sound programming for games such as &quot;Streets of Rage&quot;. Along with Takenobu Mitsuyoshi and Hiroshi Kawaguchi, Nakamura composed for &quot;OutRunners&quot;, which he found exciting due to it being a sequel to the popular &quot;OutRun&quot;, as well as being able to compose entirely using sampled instruments on the MultiPCM chip. Shortly after, he composed for &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;. Although there was pressure at the company for the game to surpass &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, he did not take much inspiration from its music, and found it challenging to output good sound from the cabinet speakers. This also led to him composing for &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot; with Mitsuyoshi and Akiko Hashimoto.

Following his work on &quot;Virtua Fighter 3&quot; with Mitsuyoshi and Fumio Ito, Nakamura left Sega in 1996 and joined Dream Factory. As he had been assigned to management roles at Sega, he felt that his work at Sega was no longer interesting due to having less time to compose music. This led to him composing the soundtrack for &quot;Tobal 2&quot;, which encompasses a variety of genres including funk, jazz fusion and rock. He also composed the music for &quot;Ehrgeiz&quot;, which features a harder sound than of &quot;Tobal 2&quot;; he found it challenging due to changing his musical approach, as well as working under time constraints. After leaving Dream Factory in 1999, he founded the music production company Brainstorm Co. Ltd. One of the first projects he worked on after becoming independent was &quot;&quot;. Other composers later joined the company too.

In 2004, Nakamura joined &quot;&quot; as the lead composer following the completion of a prototype. With programmer and additional composer Katsumi Yokota fearing that the soundtrack would lack variety beyond techno and dance music, Nakamura constructed a rich variety of songs based on his understanding of the game&#x27;s design, and considers his work to resemble ambient music. Nakamura primarily used Reason and Ableton Live software to compose the songs, finding the latter particularly suited for its interactive music. He also composed for &quot;Lumines Live!&quot; and &quot;Lumines II&quot;, which received remix albums titled &quot;Lumines Remixes Winter&quot; and &quot;L.II Remixes&quot; respectively.

Nakamura composed for the game &quot;Rodea the Sky Soldier&quot;, which was developed between 2010 and 2011 by Yuji Naka&#x27;s company Prope, but not released until 2015. Naka initially envisioned the soundtrack to have an orchestral sound, but after Nakamura played a prototype he felt that an acoustic guitar accompaniment would fit well with the concept of dashing in the sky. He split his compositional style for cutscenes and gameplay, as the game features a romantic story.

<doc id="728841" wikidata="Q311401" url="?curid=728841" title="Rómulo Gallegos">
<text>Rómulo Ángel del Monte Carmelo Gallegos Freire (2 August 1884 – 5 April 1969) was a Venezuelan novelist and politician. In 1948, he became the first freely elected president in Venezuela&#x27;s history. He was removed from power after only nine months by a military coup.

Rómulo Gallegos is considered the most relevant Venezuelan novelist of the 20th century and a prominent figure in Latin American literature.

==Early life and writings==
Rómulo Gallegos was born in Caracas to Rómulo Gallegos Osío and Rita Freire Guruceaga, into a family of humble origin. He began his work as a schoolteacher, writer, classical music enthusiast and journalist in 1903. His novel &quot;Doña Bárbara&quot; was first published in 1929 and it was because of the book&#x27;s criticisms of the regime of longtime dictator Juan Vicente Gómez that he was forced to flee the country. He took refuge in Spain, where he continued to write: his acclaimed novels &quot;Cantaclaro&quot; (1934) and &quot;Canaima&quot; (1935) date from this period.
He returned to Venezuela in 1936 and was appointed Minister of Public Education.

==Political career==
In 1937 he was elected to Congress and, in 1940–41, served as Mayor of Caracas. In 1945, Rómulo Gallegos was involved in the coup d&#x27;état that brought Rómulo Betancourt and the &quot;Revolutionary Government Junta&quot; to power, in the period known as El Trienio Adeco. In the 1947 general election he ran for the presidency of the republic as the Acción Democrática candidate and won in what is generally believed to be the country&#x27;s first honest election. He took over 74 percent of the vote, still a record for a free election in Venezuela. He took office on 15 February and was noted for raising the state&#x27;s tax revenue for oil profits increase from 43% to 50%, a tax scheme known as &quot;fifty / fifty&quot; and which was subsequently replicated in several oil producing countries such as Saudi Arabia. President Gallegos initiated the implementation of an &quot;open-door&quot; policy, which sparked an influx of Italians, eventually becoming the largest European population group within Venezuela. Nevertheless, army officers Carlos Delgado Chalbaud, Marcos Pérez Jiménez and Luis Felipe Llovera Páez overthrew him in the 1948 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état in November of that year. He took refuge first in Cuba and then in Mexico. Gallegos returned to his country after the fall of the dictatorship of Marcos Pérez Jiménez in 1958. While he was named a senator for life, he no longer took an active role in politics.

Gallegos was awarded the National Literature Prize (1958, for &quot;La doncella&quot;), and elected to the Venezuelan Academy of the Language (the correspondent agency in Venezuela of the Spanish Royal Academy).

From 1960 to 1963, he was a Commissioner of the newly created Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (created by OAS in Washington on 18 August 1959), and he was also its first President (1960) a position he held until 1963.

=== Administration ===
==Accolades==
He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1960, largely due to the efforts of Miguel Otero Silva and gained widespread support in Latin America, but ultimately lost out to Saint-John Perse. The Rómulo Gallegos International Novel Prize was created in his honor on 6 August 1964 by a presidential decree, enacted by Venezuelan president Raúl Leoni. The declared purpose of the prize is to &quot;perpetuate and honor the work of the eminent novelist and also to stimulate the creative activity of Spanish language writers.&quot; It is awarded by the government of Venezuela, through the offices of the Rómulo Gallegos Center for Latin American Studies (Celarg). The first prize was given in 1967. It was awarded every five years until 1987, when it became a biannual award. The award includes a cash prize of €100,000 making it among the richest literary prizes in the world.

==Personal life and death==
Gallegos was married to Teotiste Arocha Egui, who served as First Lady of Venezuela in 1948. Rómulo Gallegos Freire died in Caracas on 5 April 1969.


In 2016 his grave was desecrated by thieves, who stole the marble and his remains. His granddaughter took Twitter to express her frustration: &quot;Here in Venezuela, not even the remains of an ex-president can be kept away from the hands of crime.&quot;

<doc id="728854" wikidata="Q2033264" url="?curid=728854" title="23rd Street station (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)">
<text>The 23rd Street station is a local station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Park Avenue South and 23rd Street in Gramercy Park and Flatiron District, Manhattan, it is served by trains at all times, &lt;6&gt; trains during weekdays in the peak direction, and trains during late night hours.

The 23rd Street station was constructed for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) as part of the city&#x27;s first subway line, which was approved in 1900. Construction of the line segment that includes the 23rd Street station started on September 12 of the same year. The station opened on October 27, 1904, as one of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway. The station&#x27;s platforms were lengthened in the late 1940s.

The 23rd Street station contains two side platforms and four tracks; express trains use the inner two tracks to bypass the station. The station was built with tile and mosaic decorations, which are continued along the platform extensions. The platforms contain exits to 22nd Street to the south and 23rd Street to the north. The platforms are not connected to each other within fare control. The station contains elevators from the street, which make it compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

== History ==
=== Construction and opening ===

Planning for a subway line in New York City dates to 1864. However, development of what would become the city&#x27;s first subway line did not start until 1894, when the New York State Legislature passed the Rapid Transit Act. The subway plans were drawn up by a team of engineers led by William Barclay Parsons, the Rapid Transit Commission&#x27;s chief engineer. It called for a subway line from New York City Hall in lower Manhattan to the Upper West Side, where two branches would lead north into the Bronx. A plan was formally adopted in 1897, and all legal conflicts concerning the route alignment were resolved near the end of 1899. The Rapid Transit Construction Company, organized by John B. McDonald and funded by August Belmont Jr., signed the initial Contract 1 with the Rapid Transit Commission in February 1900, in which it would construct the subway and maintain a 50-year operating lease from the opening of the line. In 1901, the firm of Heins &amp; LaFarge was hired to design the underground stations. Belmont incorporated the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) in April 1902 to operate the subway.

The 23rd Street station was constructed as part of the route segment from Great Jones Street to 41st Street. Construction on this section of the line began on September 12, 1900. The section from Great Jones Street to a point 100 feet (30 m) north of 33rd Street was awarded to Holbrook, Cabot &amp; Daly Contracting Company, while the remaining section to 41st Street was done by Ira A. Shaker. By late 1903, the subway was nearly complete, but the IRT Powerhouse and the system&#x27;s electrical substations were still under construction, delaying the system&#x27;s opening. The 23rd Street station opened on October 27, 1904, as one of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway from City Hall to 145th Street on the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.

=== Service changes and station renovations ===
After the first subway line was completed in 1908, the station was served by local trains along both the West Side (now the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line to Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street) and East Side (now the Lenox Avenue Line). West Side local trains had their southern terminus at City Hall during rush hours and South Ferry at other times, and had their northern terminus at 242nd Street. East Side local trains ran from City Hall to Lenox Avenue (145th Street).

To address overcrowding, in 1909, the New York Public Service Commission proposed lengthening the platforms at stations along the original IRT subway. As part of a modification to the IRT&#x27;s construction contracts made on January 18, 1910, the company was to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car express and six-car local trains. In addition to $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) spent on platform lengthening, $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) was spent on building additional entrances and exits. It was anticipated that these improvements would increase capacity by 25 percent. Platforms at local stations, such as the 23rd Street station, were lengthened by between . Both platforms were extended to the north and south. Six-car local trains began operating in October 1910. The Lexington Avenue Line opened north of Grand Central–42nd Street in 1918, and the original line was divided into an H-shaped system. All local trains were sent via the Lexington Avenue Line, running along the Pelham Line in the Bronx.

In December 1922, the Transit Commission approved a $3 million project to lengthen platforms at 14 local stations along the original IRT line, including 23rd Street and seven other stations on the Lexington Avenue Line. Platform lengths at these stations would be increased from . The commission postponed the platform-lengthening project in September 1923, at which point the cost had risen to $5.6 million.

The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. In January 1947, the New York City Board of Transportation awarded a $4.003 million contract for the lengthening of platforms at the 23rd Street, , and stations. The platform extensions at all three stations opened on April 13, 1948, after which they could accommodate ten-car trains.

In 1981, the MTA listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system. A renovation of the 23rd Street station was funded as part of the MTA&#x27;s 1980–1984 capital plan. The MTA received a $106 million grant from the Urban Mass Transit Administration in October 1983; most of the grant would fund the renovation of eleven stations, including 23rd Street.

The station&#x27;s token booths were shuttered in May 2005, after fare tokens were replaced with MetroCards; station agents were deployed elsewhere in the station to answer passengers&#x27; queries. This was part of a pilot program that was tested at seven other stations. In late 2014, construction began to install ADA-accessible elevators in the station. To make room for the elevator that serves the northbound platform, the northbound staircase on the northeastern corner of Park Avenue South and 23rd Street had to be demolished, and was relocated a few feet down the street. The relocated staircase opened in August 2015. The construction was completed in December 2016, making the station fully ADA-compliant.

== Station layout ==
Like other local stations, 23rd Street has four tracks and two side platforms. The 6 stops here at all times, rush-hour and midday &lt;6&gt; trains stop here in the peak direction; and the 4 stops here during late nights. The two express tracks are used by the 4 and 5 trains during daytime hours. The station is between to the north and to the south. The platforms were originally long, like at other local stations on the original IRT, but later became long. The platform extensions are at the south ends of the original platforms. The 23rd Street station is fully wheelchair-accessible, with elevators connecting the street and platforms.

===Design===
As with other stations built as part of the original IRT, the station was constructed using a cut-and-cover method. The tunnel is covered by a U-shaped trough that contains utility pipes and wires. The bottom of this trough contains a foundation of concrete no less than thick. Each platform consists of concrete slabs, beneath which are drainage basins. The platforms contain columns with white glazed tiles, spaced every . Additional columns between the tracks, spaced every , support the jack-arched concrete station roofs. There is a gap between the trough wall and the platform walls, which are made of -thick brick covered over by a tiled finish.

The original decorative scheme consisted of black tile station-name tablets, violet and white tile bands, a grey faience cornice, blue faience plaques, and marble wainscoting. The mosaic tiles at all original IRT stations were manufactured by the American Encaustic Tile Company, which subcontracted the installations at each station. The decorative work was performed by tile contractor Manhattan Glass Tile Company and faience contractor Rookwood Pottery Company. The ceilings of the original platforms and fare control areas contain plaster molding.

There are no open crossovers or crossunders between the platforms. The platform extensions had beige tiles. During station renovations in 1988, the beige tiles were removed and the original, white ones restored. It has IND-style signs indicating the way to the exits at 22nd and 23rd Streets. An ornate fare control grille on the southbound side is a piece of artwork entitled &quot;Long Division&quot; by artist Valerie Jaudon, which was installed during the renovation. The station features a back-lit &quot;23 Street/Park Avenue South&quot; sign at the platform level fare control. The station does not contain restrooms.

===Exits===
Each platform has exits to both 22nd and 23rd Streets; the northbound platform&#x27;s exits are on the eastern side of Park Avenue South while the southbound platform&#x27;s exits are on the western side. At 23rd Street, each control area contains two stairs to the southern side of 23rd Street, and a stair and an elevator to the northern side. The northwestern corner stair, for the southbound platform, is within the One Madison Avenue office tower and contains a passageway into the basement of the same building. The elevators provide ADA-accessibility for the whole station.

At 22nd Street, each control area contains two exits, one each to the north and south sides of that street. The southwestern corner stair, for the southbound platform, is inside a building. The northeastern corner stair is outside the United Charities Building and the southeastern corner stair is outside the Church Missions House.

When the station was built, the IRT had made an agreement to construct an exit from the southbound platform into the Mercantile Building (now 304 Park Avenue South), at the southwestern corner of 23rd Street and Park Avenue South. A marble passageway, about wide by long, provided an exit to the building and to the southern side of 23rd Street between Park Avenue South and Madison Avenue, connecting to that building&#x27;s elevators. The passageway was slightly higher than the southbound platform, so a broad, curved flight of stairs was built on the southern side of the southbound fare control area. There were store windows on the southern side of the passageway, overlooking the Mercantile Building&#x27;s basement storefront. When opened, the passageway was advertised as New York City&#x27;s first underground sidewalk. While the broad flight of stairs still exists, the passageway has been sealed. Another sealed passageway leads from the northbound platform to the lobby of 303 Park Avenue South, at the northeast corner with 23rd Street.

<doc id="728856" wikidata="Q1389796" url="?curid=728856" title="Theodore Frelinghuysen">
<text>Theodore Frelinghuysen (March 28, 1787April 12, 1862) was an American politician who represented New Jersey in the United States Senate. He was the Whig vice presidential nominee in the election of 1844, running on a ticket with Henry Clay.

Born in Somerset County, New Jersey, Frelinghuysen established a legal practice in Newark, New Jersey, after graduating from the College of New Jersey. He was the son of Senator Frederick Frelinghuysen and the adoptive father of Secretary of State Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen. He served as the New Jersey Attorney General from 1817 to 1829 and as a United States Senator from 1829 to 1835. In the Senate, Frelinghuysen strongly opposed President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s policy of Indian removal. After leaving the Senate, he served as the Mayor of Newark from 1837 to 1838.

Frelinghuysen was selected as Clay&#x27;s running mate at the 1844 Whig National Convention. In the 1844 election, the Whig ticket was narrowly defeated by the Democratic ticket of James K. Polk and George M. Dallas. Frelinghuysen served as president of New York University from 1839 to 1850, and as president of Rutgers College from 1850 to 1862. Upon its incorporation in 1848, Frelinghuysen Township, New Jersey, was named after him.

==Early life==
He was born in 1787 in Franklin Township, Somerset County, New Jersey, to Frederick Frelinghuysen and Gertrude Schenck. His siblings include: Catharine Frelinghuysen; John Frelinghuysen (1776–1833) the General who married Louisa Mercer and after her death married Elizabeth Mercereau Van Vechten; Maria Frelinghuysen (1778–?); and Frederick Frelinghuysen (1788–1820) the lawyer who married Jane Dumont. His great-grandfather Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen was a minister and theologian of the Dutch Reformed Church, influential in the founding of Queen&#x27;s College, now Rutgers University, and one of four key leaders of the First Great Awakening in Colonial America. Theodore was the uncle of Frederick T. Frelinghuysen and great-great-grandfather of Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.

Rodney Frelinghuysen, who represented New Jersey&#x27;s 11th congressional district, is a descendant.

Frelinghuysen married Charlotte Mercer in 1809, but she died in the same year. They had no children together, but when Theodore&#x27;s brother, Frederick Frelinghuysen (1788–1820) died, Theodore adopted his son, Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen (1817–1885), who would later become Secretary of State. Theodore Frelinghuysen remarried in 1857 to Harriet Pumpelly.

He graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1804 and studied law under his brother John Frelinghuysen, and later, Richard Stockton. He was admitted to the bar as an attorney in 1808 and as a counselor in 1811, and set up a law practice in Newark during this time period. In the War of 1812, he was a captain of a company of volunteers.
==Political career==
He became Attorney General of New Jersey in 1817, turned down an appointment to the New Jersey Supreme Court and became a United States Senator in 1829, serving in that capacity until 1835.

As a Senator, he led the opposition to Andrew Jackson&#x27;s Indian Removal Act of 1830. His six-hour speech against the Removal Act was delivered over the course of three days, and warned of the supposed dire consequences of the policy: Let us beware how, by oppressive encroachments upon the sacred privileges of our Indian neighbors, we minister to the agonies of future remorse. Jackson supporters chided Frelinghuysen for mixing his evangelical Christianity with politics, and the Removal Act was passed.

He was Mayor of Newark, New Jersey, from 1837 until 1838.

At the 1844 Whig National Convention, competing with Millard Fillmore, John Davis and John Sergeant, he was selected as the Whig vice-presidential candidate. He took the lead on the first ballot and never lost it, eventually being chosen by acclamation. The Whig presidential candidate, Henry Clay, was not present at the convention and expressed surprise upon hearing the news. Frelinghuysen&#x27;s rectitude might have been intended to correct for Clay&#x27;s reputation for moral laxity, but his opposition to Indian removal may have put off those southern voters who had suffered from their raids (William Lloyd Garrison praised his speech opposing removal in the poem &quot;To the Honorable Theodore Freylinghusen, on reading his eloquent speech in defence of Indian Rights&quot;). Frelinghuysen was also unpopular with Catholics because groups of which he was a member, such as the Protestant American Bible Society, promulgated the idea that Catholics should convert to Protestantism. Clay and Frelinghuysen lost the 1844 election.

==Institutional positions==

Frelinghuysen was the second president of New York University between 1839 and 1850 and seventh president of Rutgers College between 1850 and 1862. He was president of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (1841 – ), American Bible Society (1846–1862), and American Tract Society (1842–1846), as well as vice president of the American Sunday School Union (1826–1861), and American Colonization Society (ACS). In his public advocacy for colonization, or the deportation of free people of color from the United States, Frelinguysen described black people as “licentious, ignorant, and irritated” and therefore not suited for full citizenship within their present country. His moniker was the &quot;Christian Statesman.&quot;
==Death==
He died in New Brunswick, New Jersey, on April 12, 1862, and he was buried there at the First Reformed Church Cemetery.

<text>The 28th Street station is a local station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located under Park Avenue South at 28th Street in the Rose Hill neighborhood of Manhattan, it is served by trains at all times, &lt;6&gt; trains during weekdays in the peak direction, and trains during late night hours.

The 28th Street station was constructed for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) as part of the city&#x27;s first subway line, which was approved in 1900. Construction of the line segment that includes the 28th Street station started on September 12 of the same year. The station opened on October 27, 1904, as one of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway. The station&#x27;s platforms were lengthened in the late 1940s.

The 28th Street station contains two side platforms and four tracks; express trains use the inner two tracks to bypass the station. The station was built with tile and mosaic decorations, which are continued along the platform extensions. The platforms contain exits to 28th Street and Park Avenue, as well as to the New York Life Building. The platforms are not connected to each other within fare control. The station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== History ==

=== Construction and opening ===

Planning for a subway line in New York City dates to 1864. However, development of what would become the city&#x27;s first subway line did not start until 1894, when the New York State Legislature passed the Rapid Transit Act. The subway plans were drawn up by a team of engineers led by William Barclay Parsons, the Rapid Transit Commission&#x27;s chief engineer. It called for a subway line from New York City Hall in lower Manhattan to the Upper West Side, where two branches would lead north into the Bronx. A plan was formally adopted in 1897, and all legal conflicts concerning the route alignment were resolved near the end of 1899. The Rapid Transit Construction Company, organized by John B. McDonald and funded by August Belmont Jr., signed the initial Contract 1 with the Rapid Transit Commission in February 1900, in which it would construct the subway and maintain a 50-year operating lease from the opening of the line. In 1901, the firm of Heins &amp; LaFarge was hired to design the underground stations. Belmont incorporated the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) in April 1902 to operate the subway.

The 28th Street station was constructed as part of the route segment from Great Jones Street to 41st Street. Construction on this section of the line began on September 12, 1900. The section from Great Jones Street to a point 100 feet (30 m) north of 33rd Street was awarded to Holbrook, Cabot &amp; Daly Contracting Company, while the remaining section to 41st Street was done by Ira A. Shaker. By late 1903, the subway was nearly complete, but the IRT Powerhouse and the system&#x27;s electrical substations were still under construction, delaying the system&#x27;s opening. That December, workers installed the station&#x27;s eight entrance and exit kiosks. The 28th Street station opened on October 27, 1904, as one of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway from City Hall to 145th Street on the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.

=== Service changes and station renovations ===

==== 20th century ====

After the first subway line was completed in 1908, the station was served by local trains along both the West Side (now the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line to Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street) and East Side (now the Lenox Avenue Line). West Side local trains had their southern terminus at City Hall during rush hours and South Ferry at other times, and had their northern terminus at 242nd Street. East Side local trains ran from City Hall to Lenox Avenue (145th Street).

To address overcrowding, in 1909, the New York Public Service Commission proposed lengthening the platforms at stations along the original IRT subway. As part of a modification to the IRT&#x27;s construction contracts made on January 18, 1910, the company was to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car express and six-car local trains. In addition to $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) spent on platform lengthening, $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) was spent on building additional entrances and exits. It was anticipated that these improvements would increase capacity by 25 percent. Platforms at local stations, such as the 28th Street station, were lengthened by between . Both platforms were extended to the north and south. Six-car local trains began operating in October 1910. The Lexington Avenue Line opened north of Grand Central–42nd Street in 1918, and the original line was divided into an H-shaped system. All local trains were sent via the Lexington Avenue Line, running along the Pelham Line in the Bronx.

In December 1922, the Transit Commission approved a $3 million project to lengthen platforms at 14 local stations along the original IRT line, including 28th Street and seven other stations on the Lexington Avenue Line. Platform lengths at these stations would be increased from . The commission postponed the platform-lengthening project in September 1923, at which point the cost had risen to $5.6 million.

On August 6, 1927, bombs exploded at the 28th Street station and at the 28th Street station on the Broadway Line. Numerous passengers were injured, but there were no casualties, although investigators initially believed one person may have been killed. The perpetrator of the bombings is unknown; they were initially blamed on Galleanists (as Sacco and Vanzetti had been denied appeal three days prior), though police later believed they were unrelated.

With the completion of the New York Life Building between 26th and 27th Streets in 1928, a new entrance opened from the building&#x27;s basement to the southbound platform. The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. In January 1947, the New York City Board of Transportation awarded a $4.003 million contract for the lengthening of platforms at the , 28th Street, and stations. The preexisting passageway to the New York Life Building was converted to an extension of the southbound platform. The New York Life Company and the city shared the cost of converting the passageway into a platform. The platform extensions at all three stations opened on April 13, 1948, after which they could accommodate ten-car trains.

In 1987, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) allocated $31 million to renovate 44 stations across the subway system, including the 28th Street station. The station&#x27;s original tiles, which were peeling off, were entirely replaced. At the fare control area, glass block walls were installed above the turnstiles. New tiles were also installed on the floors and walls of the fare control areas. To deter fare evaders from sneaking through the emergency exit &quot;slam gates&quot; at each fare-control area, electronically activated gates were installed beside the existing turnstiles. The staircases to street level were rebuilt as well. The work was completed by early 1989, having been delayed by nine months because of setbacks in the delivery of new light fixtures.

==== 21st century ====
The 28th Street station has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2005. During the mid-2010s, a staircase and elevator from street level to the southbound platform was added with the construction of 400 Park Avenue South, a residential tower at the southwestern corner of Park Avenue South and 28th Street. The tower was completed in 2015.

Under the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Plan, the station underwent a complete overhaul as part of the Enhanced Station Initiative, and was entirely closed for several months. Updates included cellular service, Wi-Fi, USB charging stations, interactive service advisories and maps. In January 2018, the NYCT and Bus Committee recommended that Judlau Contracting should receive the $125 million contract for the renovations of 57th and 23rd Streets on the IND Sixth Avenue Line, 28th Street on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, and 34th Street–Penn Station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and IND Eighth Avenue Line. However, the MTA Board temporarily deferred the vote for these packages after city representatives refused to vote to award the contracts. The contract was put back for a vote in February, where it was ultimately approved. The station was closed for renovations on July 16, 2018, and reopened to the public January 14, 2019, delayed from December 2018.

== Station layout ==
Like other local stations, 28th Street has four tracks and two side platforms. The 6 stops here at all times, rush-hour and midday &lt;6&gt; trains stop here in the peak direction, and the 4 stops here during late nights. The two express tracks are used by the 4 and 5 trains during daytime hours. The station is between to the north and to the south. The platforms were originally long, like at other local stations on the original IRT, but were later extended to . The platform extensions are at both ends of the original platforms. The 28th Street station is partially wheelchair-accessible, with one elevator connecting the street and the southbound platform only.

The express tracks stay level, while the local tracks slowly incline into the station to allow for the easier deceleration of local trains. As such, the express tracks are at a slightly lower elevation than the local tracks.

=== Design ===

As with other stations built as part of the original IRT, the station was constructed using a cut-and-cover method. The tunnel is covered by a U-shaped trough that contains utility pipes and wires. The bottom of this trough contains a foundation of concrete no less than thick. Each platform consists of concrete slabs, beneath which are drainage basins. The original platforms contain I-beam columns spaced every , while the platform extensions contain columns with white glazed tiles. Additional columns between the tracks, spaced every , support the jack-arched concrete station roofs. There is a gap between the trough wall and the platform walls, which are made of -thick brick covered over by a tiled finish.

The fare control is at platform level and there are no open crossunders or crossovers. There is a closed crossunder about halfway between each platform, which was constructed during the 1940s and is sealed. The walls along the platforms near the fare control areas consist of a brick wainscoting on the lowest part of the wall, with bronze air vents along the wainscoting, and white glass tiles above. The platform walls are divided at intervals by buff mosaic tile pilasters, or vertical bands. Atop the pilasters are pairs of cruciform faience plaques with the words , surrounded by foliate designs and rosettes. The plaque pairings are set within a frame that contains a ventilation opening between each plaque of the pair. A cornice with blue egg-and-dart patterns runs atop these walls. The platform extensions are decorated with blue and buff tile bands, and contain blue mosaic tile plaques with the number &quot;28&quot; atop the pilasters. The far southern end of the southbound platform has square ceramic tiles topped by marble belt courses. The mosaic tiles at all original IRT stations were manufactured by the American Encaustic Tile Company, which subcontracted the installations at each station. The decorative work was performed by faience contractor Grueby Faience Company. The ceilings of the fare control areas once contained plaster molding, although this has been removed. The fare control areas at 28th Street contain various maintenance rooms and were retiled with large rectangular ceramic blocks in 1989. As of the 2019 renovation, the fare control areas have modern black finishes.

Two works of art have been installed in this station. The first was a glass block wall artwork at the main fare control by Gerald Marks, entitled &quot;Seven Waves 4 Twenty-Eight&quot;. It was installed during station renovations in 1996. &quot;Seven Waves 4 Twenty-Eight&quot; was replaced by &quot;Roaming Underfoot&quot;, a glass mosaic mural on the platform walls by Nancy Blum. &quot;Roaming Underfoot&quot; showcases flora in the Madison Square Park Conservancy&#x27;s Perennial Collection and was installed during the 2018 renovation.

===Exits===
Each platform has exits to 28th Street; the northbound platform&#x27;s exits are on the eastern side of Park Avenue South while the southbound platform&#x27;s exits are on the western side. The only control area for the northbound platform is at the northern end of the station, at 28th Street and Park Avenue South, where four stairs lead to street level, two each to the northeastern and southeastern corners. These stairs contain simple, modern steel railings like those seen at most New York City Subway stations. These stairs also contain next-train countdown clocks and neighborhood wayfinding maps at the exterior of each entrance, which were installed in the 2019 renovation.

The main fare control area for the southbound platform is also at the northern end of the station. A stair leads up to 45 East 28th Street on the north side of that street, and a stair and elevator lead up to 50 East 28th Street directly across to the south. The latter entrance replaced two staircases right outside the building, at the southwestern corner of 28th Street and Park Avenue South.

A second fare control area at the southern end of the southbound platform leads to a privately operated passageway in the basement of the New York Life Building, between 26th and 27th Streets. It is only open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays. The New York Life Building entrance has an Art Deco inspired sign hanging from the facade of that building.

<doc id="728858" wikidata="Q351742" url="?curid=728858" title="Mitsuru Adachi">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist. After graduating from Gunma Prefectural Maebashi Commercial High School in 1969, Adachi worked as an assistant for Isami Ishii. He made his manga debut in 1970 with &quot;Kieta Bakuon&quot;, based on a manga originally created by Satoru Ozawa. &quot;Kieta&quot; was published in &quot;Deluxe Shōnen Sunday&quot; (a manga magazine published by Shogakukan).

Adachi is well known for romantic comedy and sports manga (especially baseball) such as &quot;Touch&quot;, &quot;H2&quot;, &quot;Slow Step&quot;, &quot;Miyuki&quot; and &quot;Cross Game&quot;. He has been described as a writer of &quot;delightful dialogue&quot;, a genius at portraying everyday life, &quot;the greatest pure storyteller&quot;, and &quot;a master manga artist&quot;. He is one of the few manga artists to write for shōnen, shōjo and seinen manga magazines, and be popular in all three.

His works have been carried in manga magazines such as &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;, &quot;Ciao&quot;, &quot;Shōjo Comic&quot;, &quot;Big Comic&quot; and &quot;Petit Comic&quot;, and most of his works are published through Shogakukan and Gakken. He was one of the flagship authors in the new &quot;Monthly Shōnen Sunday&quot; magazine which began publication in June 2009. Two short story collections, &quot;Short Program&quot; and &quot;Short Program 2&quot; (both through Viz Media), have been released in North America, and Viz Media scheduled to begin publishing &quot;Cross Game&quot; in October 2010. The first volume was released on October 12.

He modeled the spelling of あだち (rather than 安達) for his family name after the example of his older brother, manga artist Tsutomu Adachi. In addition, it has been suggested that the accurate portrayal of sibling rivalry in &quot;Touch&quot; may come from Adachi&#x27;s experiences while growing up with his older brother. Adachi did the character designs for the OVA anime series &quot;Nozomi Witches&quot;, so he is sometimes incorrectly given credit for creating the original series.

==Brief history==
Prior to 1969, Adachi began submitting works to the manga magazine &quot;COM&quot;. In 1969, he followed his older brother&#x27;s lead and moved to Tokyo to begin work as an assistant to manga artist Isami Ishii. The following year, he made his professional debut with &quot;Kieta Bakuon&quot;. He continued publishing various short stories and shorter series throughout the 1970s based on works created by others, the most well known being his adaptation of &quot;Rainbowman&quot; from 1972 to 1973. In 1978, he published his first original series, &quot;Nine&quot;, in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;. He published two other original series, &quot;Hiatari Ryōkō!&quot; from 1979 to 1981 in &quot;Weekly Shōjo Comic&quot;, and &quot;Miyuki&quot; from 1980 to 1984 in &quot;Shōnen Big Comic&quot;.

Adachi became a household name with the publication of his series &quot;Touch&quot; from 1981 to 1986 in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;. In 1982, &quot;Hiatari Ryōkō!&quot; was adapted into a live action TV drama series. The following year, 1983, was a big year for Adachi. He received the 28th Annual Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen/shōjo manga his two series &quot;Touch&quot; and &quot;Miyuki&quot;. His &quot;Miyuki&quot; series was adapted into both an anime television series and a live-action film and &quot;Nine&quot; was adapted into three films, with another following in 1984.

&quot;Touch&quot; was adapted into an anime television series in 1985 and the series ran for two years on Fuji TV. Adachi&#x27;s romantic shōjo manga series, &quot;Slow Step&quot;, was serialized in &quot;Ciao&quot; from 1986 to 1991 and another romantic comedy series, &quot;Rough&quot;, appeared in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; from 1987 to 1989. Adachi then released &quot;Niji Iro Tōgarashi&quot;, a fantasy medieval romantic comedy manga series, from 1990 to 1992 in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;.

&quot;Jinbē&quot;, a romantic comedy about the relationship between a stepfather and stepdaughter, was serialized in &quot;Big Comic Original&quot; from 1992 to 1997. Adachi&#x27;s longest manga series, &quot;H2&quot; was serialized in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; from 1992 to 1999 and compiled in 34 volumes. This manga was adapted into an anime television series which aired on TV Asahi from 1995 to 1996.

From 2000 to 2001, Adachi published a fantasy romantic comedy series in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; titled &quot;Itsumo Misora&quot;. His next longer series was the boxing romantic comedy, &quot;Katsu!&quot;, published from 2001 to 2005 in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;. In 2005, &quot;H2&quot; was adapted into a live action drama series aired on TBS in Japan, and &quot;Touch&quot; was adapted into a live action movie released by Toho. He also began his manga series &quot;Cross Game&quot;, serialized in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;. The following year, &quot;Rough&quot; was adapted into a live action movie, also released by Toho.

Due to achieving total manga sales numbering over 200 million volumes, &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; devoted issue 26 in 2008 to Adachi and his works. In 2009, Adachi won the 54th Annual Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen manga for &quot;Cross Game&quot;, which was adapted into an anime television series which began airing on TV Tokyo in April 2009.

Adachi began &quot;Q and A&quot; in the inaugural issue of &quot;Monthly Shōnen Sunday&quot; in June 2009. &quot;Asaoka High School Baseball Club Diary: Over Fence&quot; began in the April 27, 2011, issue of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;. In May 2012 he finished &quot;Q and A&quot; and began his new series, &quot;Mix&quot;, a semi-sequel to &quot;Touch&quot; set 30 years later, in the June 2012 issue of &quot;Monthly Shōnen Sunday&quot;. Currently, Adachi&#x27;s works have sold over 200 million copies.

;Tsutomu Adachi
:Mitsuru&#x27;s older brother was a manga artist and an assistant to Fujio Akatsuka. He died of stomach cancer in 2004. In 1982, he authored &quot;Mitsuru Adachi Monogatari&quot;, a manga detailing the early life of Mitsuru as a rookie manga artist. 

;Shinji Nagashima
:Adachi became a fan of Nagashima around the age of 10, and began tracing his works. He became an assistant to Nagashima for a short time after graduating from high school. However, Nagashima suddenly moved overseas, so he then became an assistant to Isami Ishii. In the October 16, 2005, issue of &quot;Big Comic&quot;, Adachi published a short work titled &quot;The Runaway God&quot; which was meant as a memorialization of Nagashima.

;Rumiko Takahashi
:From the early 1980s, both Adachi and Takahashi were popular authors in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; and they formed a friendly rivalry. He even commented about how he had a lot to live up to with how popular Takahashi was, especially with it being a shōnen magazine. Several times a year they would meet, to share their thoughts and ideas with each other. At the end of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; issue 43 in 2006, the authors were asked, &quot;If you could pick one penname to use which was different than your own, which one would you pick?&quot;, and Takahashi replied, &quot;Adachi Mitsuru.&quot;

;Kazuhiko Shimamoto
:Shimamoto and Adachi are mutual fans of each others&#x27; works. The main character in his &quot;Blazing Transfer Student&quot; manga series, Noboru Takizawa, made a guest appearance in &quot;Touch&quot;.

;Mr. Pogo
:Pogo and Adachi graduated in the same class and have spoken about this in various magazine interviews. The character Kōtarō Matsudaira from &quot;Touch&quot; is modeled after Pogo.

<text>The 18th Street station was a local station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. It was located at the intersection of Park Avenue South and 18th Street in Gramercy, Manhattan.

The 18th Street station was constructed for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) as part of the city&#x27;s first subway line, which was approved in 1900. Construction of the line segment that includes the 18th Street station started on September 12 of the same year. The station opened on October 27, 1904, as one of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway. The station was closed on November 8, 1948, as a result of a platform lengthening project at 23rd Street.

The 18th Street station contains two abandoned side platforms and four tracks. The station was built with tile and mosaic decorations. Many of these decorations have been covered with graffiti.

== History ==
===Construction and opening===

Planning for a subway line in New York City dates to 1864. However, development of what would become the city&#x27;s first subway line did not start until 1894, when the New York State Legislature passed the Rapid Transit Act. The subway plans were drawn up by a team of engineers led by William Barclay Parsons, the Rapid Transit Commission&#x27;s chief engineer. It called for a subway line from New York City Hall in lower Manhattan to the Upper West Side, where two branches would lead north into the Bronx. A plan was formally adopted in 1897, and all legal conflicts concerning the route alignment were resolved near the end of 1899. The Rapid Transit Construction Company, organized by John B. McDonald and funded by August Belmont Jr., signed the initial Contract 1 with the Rapid Transit Commission in February 1900, in which it would construct the subway and maintain a 50-year operating lease from the opening of the line. In 1901, the firm of Heins &amp; LaFarge was hired to design the underground stations. Belmont incorporated the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) in April 1902 to operate the subway.

The 18th Street station was constructed as part of the route segment from Great Jones Street to 41st Street. Construction on this section of the line began on September 12, 1900. The section from Great Jones Street to a point 100 feet (30 m) north of 33rd Street was awarded to Holbrook, Cabot &amp; Daly Contracting Company, while the remaining section to 41st Street was done by Ira A. Shaker. By late 1903, the subway was nearly complete, but the IRT Powerhouse and the system&#x27;s electrical substations were still under construction, delaying the system&#x27;s opening. The 18th Street station opened on October 27, 1904, as one of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway from City Hall to 145th Street on the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.

=== Service changes and closure ===
After the first subway line was completed in 1908, the station was served by local trains along both the West Side (now the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line to Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street) and East Side (now the Lenox Avenue Line). West Side local trains had their southern terminus at City Hall during rush hours and South Ferry at other times, and had their northern terminus at 242nd Street. East Side local trains ran from City Hall to Lenox Avenue (145th Street).

To address overcrowding, in 1909, the New York Public Service Commission proposed lengthening the platforms at stations along the original IRT subway. As part of a modification to the IRT&#x27;s construction contracts made on January 18, 1910, the company was to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car express and six-car local trains. In addition to $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) spent on platform lengthening, $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) was spent on building additional entrances and exits. It was anticipated that these improvements would increase capacity by 25 percent. Platforms at local stations, such as the 18th Street station, were lengthened by between . Both platforms were extended to the north and south. Six-car local trains began operating in October 1910. The Lexington Avenue Line opened north of Grand Central–42nd Street in 1918, and the original line was divided into an H-shaped system. All local trains were sent via the Lexington Avenue Line, running along the Pelham Line in the Bronx. 

In December 1922, the Transit Commission approved a $3 million project to lengthen platforms at 14 local stations along the original IRT line, including 18th Street and seven other stations on the Lexington Avenue Line. Platform lengths at these stations would be increased from . The commission postponed the platform-lengthening project in September 1923, at which point the cost had risen to $5.6 million.

The closing of this station was proposed as early as 1928. The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The station closed on November 8, 1948. The platforms at 23rd Street had been lengthened, with entrances at 22nd Street, and the 18th Street station was close to the 14th Street–Union Square station.

== Station layout ==
Like other local stations, 18th Street has four tracks and two abandoned side platforms. The two local tracks, which formerly served the station, are used by the 6 train at all times, &lt;6&gt; trains during weekdays in the peak direction, and the 4 train during late nights. The two express tracks are used by the 4 and 5 trains during daytime hours. The platforms were long, like at other local stations on the original IRT.

As with other stations built as part of the original IRT, the station was constructed using a cut-and-cover method. The tunnel is covered by a U-shaped trough that contains utility pipes and wires. The bottom of this trough contains a foundation of concrete no less than thick. Each former platform consists of concrete slabs, beneath which are drainage basins. The former platforms contain circular, cast-iron Doric-style columns spaced every . Additional columns between the tracks, spaced every , support the jack-arched concrete station roofs. There is a gap between the trough wall and the platform walls, which are made of -thick brick covered over by a tiled finish.

The decorative scheme consisted of blue/green tile tablets, buff and violet tile bands, a violet faience cornice, and green faience plaques. The mosaic tiles at all original IRT stations were manufactured by the American Encaustic Tile Company, which subcontracted the installations at each station. The decorative work was performed by tile contractor Manhattan Glass Tile Company and faience contractor Grueby Faience Company. The 18th Street station is fairly well preserved, with the exception of graffiti and some litter.

<text>Augustus Chaflin French (August 2, 1808 – September 4, 1864) was the ninth governor of the U.S. state of Illinois from 1846 until 1853. He is best known for his fiscal policies, which eliminated the state&#x27;s debt by the end of his administration, and for the lack of scandals during his administration. His name also graces the Governor French Academy in Belleville, Illinois.

== Early life and political rise ==
French was born in Hill, New Hampshire, the son of Eunice (Dickerson) and Joseph French. His father died when he was a child, and he struggled to obtain an education, finally leaving Dartmouth College due to lack of funds. Studying at home, he was admitted to the bar in 1823. He then travelled to Albion, Illinois, but soon moved to Edgar Courthouse (later renamed Paris) in the newly established Edgar County, where he acquired a successful law practice. On his mother&#x27;s death, he assumed responsibility for his younger siblings.

French entered politics in 1837, first serving a term in the Illinois legislature, then becoming the Receiver of Public Monies (i.e., the receiver of money paid to the U.S. government for land) at Palestine in Crawford County, Illinois, where he took up residence. In 1844 he was a presidential elector for James K. Polk (the winner in that election), and became popular in Illinois politics through his advocacy of a war with Mexico. French was nominated for governor by his party and won the election for governor, taking office in December 1846.

== Administration ==
French immediately pushed for the funding to retire the state&#x27;s debt, an attitude that characterized his entire tenure in office. He saw many of the Mormons leave the state in February 1846 after their city charter at Nauvoo had been revoked the previous year. Two events significant to the growth of Chicago occurred during French&#x27;s term of office: the Illinois and Michigan Canal was completed, and the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad was begun. The canal connected the Illinois River (and thus, the Mississippi River) with the Great Lakes, while the railroad connected Chicago with the lead mines in Galena, Illinois (it would be completed in 1853).

A new state constitution was adopted in 1848, and among its changes from the 1818 constitution were new provisions for the election and terms of office for the state governor. French was unanimously renominated for the office by his party, and easily won re-election. He continued his efforts to reduce the state&#x27;s debt, and by the time he left office in 1853, the entire deficit had been eliminated.

== Later life ==
After his retirement from government, French would continue his public service as a bank commissioner appointed to that position by his successor, Governor Matteson. He then relocated to Lebanon in St. Clair County, Illinois, where he became a Professor of Law at McKendree College.

In 1858 he ran for State Superintendent of Public Instruction as the nominee of the Douglas wing of his party, but was defeated. He was a delegate to the unproductive Illinois Constitutional Convention of 1862, which became known as the &quot;Copperhead Convention&quot; for its anti-war stance during the Civil War.

Augustus French died on September 4th, 1864 at 12:20 Post-Meridiem, due to Typhoid fever, and was buried in College Hill Cemetery.

<text>Philip Morin Freneau (January 2, 1752 – December 18, 1832) was an American poet, nationalist, polemicist, sea captain and early American newspaper editor sometimes called the &quot;Poet of the American Revolution&quot;. Through his Philadelphia newspaper, the &quot;National Gazette&quot;, he was a strong critic of George Washington and a proponent of Jeffersonian policies.

==Biography==
=== Early life and education ===
Freneau was born in New York City, the oldest of the five children of Huguenot wine merchant Pierre Freneau and his Scottish wife. Freneau was raised Calvinist by parents who were part of a Presbyterian congregation led by a New Light evangelical, Rev. William Tennent, Jr. Freneau later attended a grammar school directed by Tennent. Philip was raised in Matawan, New Jersey. He attended the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), where he studied under John Witherspoon.

Freneau&#x27;s close friend at Princeton was James Madison, a relationship that would later contribute to his establishment as the editor of the &quot;National Gazette&quot;. Freneau family tradition suggests that Madison became acquainted with and fell in love with the poet&#x27;s sister, Mary, during visits to their home while he was studying at Princeton. While tradition has it that Mary rejected Madison&#x27;s repeated marriage proposals, this anecdote is undocumented and unsupported by other evidence.

Freneau graduated from Princeton in 1771, having already written the poetical &quot;History of the Prophet Jonah&quot;, and, with Hugh Henry Brackenridge, the prose satire &quot;Father Bombo&#x27;s Pilgrimage to Mecca,&quot;considered by some to be the first American novel.

=== Writing career ===
Following his graduation, he tried his hand at teaching, but quickly gave it up. He also pursued a further study of theology, but gave this up as well after about two years. As the Revolutionary War approached in 1775, Freneau wrote a number of anti-British pieces. However, by 1776, Freneau left America for the West Indies, and for two years was a business agent on Saint Croix, observing the horrors of slavery up close. One of his best-known poems, &quot;On Sir Toby&quot;, catalogs these horrors and has become a well-known anti-slavery poem. In 1778, Freneau returned to America, and rejoined the patriotic cause. Freneau eventually became a crew member on a revolutionary privateer, and was captured in this capacity. He was held on a British prison ship for about six weeks. This experience, which almost killed him, was detailed in his work &quot;The British Prison Ship&quot;, which prompted many more patriotic and anti-British writings throughout the revolution and after. For this, he was named &quot;The Poet of the American Revolution&quot;.

In 1790 Freneau married Eleanor Forman, and became an assistant editor of the &quot;New York Daily Advertiser&quot;. Soon after, Madison and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson worked to get Freneau to move to Philadelphia in order to edit a partisan newspaper that would counter the Federalist newspaper &quot;The Gazette of the United States&quot;. Jefferson was criticized for hiring Freneau as a translator in the State Department, even though he spoke no foreign languages except French. Freneau accepted this sinecure, which left free time to head the Democratic-Republican newspaper Jefferson and Madison envisioned.

This partisan newspaper, &quot;The National Gazette&quot;, provided a vehicle for Jefferson, Madison, and others to promote criticism of the rival Federalists. &quot;The Gazette&quot; took particular aim at the policies promoted by Alexander Hamilton, and like other papers of the day, would not hesitate to shade into personal attacks, including President George Washington during his second term. Owing to &quot;The Gazette&quot;″s frequent attacks on his administration and himself, Washington took a particular dislike to Freneau.

=== Later years and death ===
Freneau later retired to a more rural life and wrote a mix of political and nature works.

He died at 80 years of age, frozen to death while returning to his home near Freehold, New Jersey, and was buried in what became the Philip Morin Freneau Cemetery on Poet&#x27;s Drive in Matawan, New Jersey. His mother was also buried there but his wife was laid to rest at her family plot in Mount Pleasant Church Cemetery on what is now Route 516 and Main in Matawan.

== Legacy ==
The non-political works of Freneau combined neoclassicism and romanticism. Although he is not as generally well known as Ralph Waldo Emerson or James Fenimore Cooper, Freneau introduced many themes and images for which later authors became famous. For example, Freneau&#x27;s poem &quot;The House of Night&quot;, one of the early romantic poems written and published in America, included the Gothic elements and dark imagery that later were seen in the poetry by Edgar Allan Poe. Freneau&#x27;s nature poem &quot;The Wild Honey Suckle&quot; (1786) was considered an early seed to the later Transcendentalist movement taken up by William Cullen Bryant, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David Thoreau. Romantic primitivism was anticipated by Freneau&#x27;s poems &quot;The Indian Burying Ground&quot; and &quot;Noble Savage.&quot;

Memorials to him in Matawan include:
* The Matawan Post Office on Main Street has a sculpture of Freneau on its wall, depicting him with black slaves as he was an abolitionist later in life. It was created in 1939 by Armin Scheler under a New Deal commission from the Treasury Department.
* There is a Freneau fire company on Main Street/Route 79.
* A site Freneau frequented in Matawan is now in use as a restaurant. From 1961 until 2008, it operated as The Poet&#x27;s Inn, honoring Freneau&#x27;s memory. The business has changed hands several times, and the building has been renovated over the years.
* Freneau, New Jersey, an unincorporated community within Matawan, was named in his honor.
* Freneau Woods Park, named after Philip Morin Freneau, whose family once partly owned the property is located along the headwaters of Matawan Creek and Lake Lefferts. This 313-acre park is composed mostly of woodland and protects critical wildlife habitat and bolsters water quality in the region. Both historically and environmentally significant, the park provides open space in a densely populated area of the county.

In 2022, the band :Bird in the Belly used the words from Freneau&#x27;s poem &quot;Pestilence&quot; for their concept album :After the city. The lyrics appear in the song &quot;Pale Horse&quot; and represent the arrival of the pale horse into their fictional depiction of London.

&quot;Around the Horn&quot; premiered on November 4, 2002. From its premiere until January 30, 2004, the show was hosted by Max Kellerman, who at the time was largely known strictly as a contributor to ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Friday Night Fights&quot;. In late 2003, Kellerman announced that he would depart from the network for Fox Sports; after the show tried out several replacements, current host Tony Reali was named the permanent host on February 2, 2004, three days after Kellerman&#x27;s last episode aired. As of September 23, 2019, Woody Paige has the most wins in the history of the show, with more than six hundred. Despite early negative reviews due to its now-defunct argumentative formatting, the show has lasted more than twenty years on the air, remaining a staple on ESPN. The show became less combative and more playful over the years, and in 2018, changed its look with augmented reality of the panel with Reali standing in an enhanced studio at ESPN&#x27;s South Street Seaport studios with a continuation of the relaxed tone of the show since the mid-2010s.

The show went on hiatus from March 16, 2020 to May 8, 2020, as a result of a national emergency being declared due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused the suspension of sports leagues around the world. Between May 11, 2020 and July 10, 2020, &quot;Around the Horn&quot; aired for 20 minutes with commercials at 4:40 p.m. EDT as &quot;Around the Home&quot; under a new format where Tony Reali, along with three panelists, discussed sports issues from their own homes. The &quot;Around the Home&quot; format became semipermanent beginning with the July 13, 2020 episode, which saw the show expand back to its normal length. The show returned to its regular format when it returned to the studio in September 2020, although the &quot;Around the Home&quot; format is still used occasionally.

It was announced on November 20, 2024, that &quot;Around the Horn&quot; will come to an end by summer 2025. Shortly after this announcement, daily episodes were added to Disney+.

==The set==
The original set was in the same Atlantic Video complex as the set for &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot;. It featured the host&#x27;s desk with the point triggers and mute buttons. The judge of the show scores four panelists, that are shown on four different screens. Behind the host&#x27;s desk was a map of the contiguous United States of America with the cities the sportswriters on the show appeared from. The map, divided into time zones, displayed the names of five newspapers representing each time zone. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; represented the Pacific Time Zone, the &quot;Denver Post&quot; the Mountain Time Zone, the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; and &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; both represented the Central Time Zone, and the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; represented the Eastern Time Zone. This was to create a regionally biased discussion, but this was later phased out.

When panelist Woody Paige was based in New York, the logo of &quot;Cold Pizza&quot; was added to the Eastern Time Zone side of the map as Paige also appeared on that program. Eventually, the logo of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; was replaced by the word &quot;Boston&quot; as many of the contributors from Boston were no longer writing for the Globe. The map was eventually revised in this way for the other cities on the map, but there cities of other contributors were not added to the board (possibly due to a lack of space) before the map was removed. Panelists still appear from left to right as on a map of the United States, from the westernmost on the left to the easternmost on the right.

On September 27, 2010, &quot;Around the Horn&quot; and &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot; began broadcasting in high definition and moved from the Atlantic Video complex to facilities in the ABC News Washington bureau, where high definition sets were built for both shows. In 2014, Reali relocated to New York, with a studio built in ABC&#x27;s Times Square Studios. In 2018, in conjunction with the conclusion of Reali&#x27;s work on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, the show moved to ESPN&#x27;s South Street Seaport Studios with an enhanced set featuring augmented reality.

Each panelist appears either in the offices of their newspaper, in front of a screen representing the city in which they are located, or in another studio. Dallas, Denver, and Los Angeles (when Bill Plaschke is appearing) still use their newspaper offices as studio space while Washington, Miami, Chicago, and Boston each have their own screens. (Los Angeles employs this as well when J.A. Adande is a panelist.) Newspaper office space is rarely used in today&#x27;s iteration.

<text>Gustav Freytag (; 13 July 1816 – 30 April 1895) was a German novelist and playwright.

==Life==
Freytag was born in Kreuzburg (Kluczbork) in Silesia. After attending the school at Oels (Oleśnica), he studied philology at the universities of Breslau (Wrocław) and Berlin, and in 1838 received his degree with a dissertation titled &quot;De initiis poeseos scenicae apud Germanos&quot; (&quot;Über die Anfänge der dramatischen Poesie bei den Germanen&quot;, English: &quot;On the Beginnings of Dramatic Poetry among the Germans&quot;). He became member of the student corps &quot;Borussia zu Breslau&quot;.

In 1839, he settled in Breslau, as &quot;Privatdozent&quot; in German language and literature, but devoted his principal attention to writing for the stage, achieving considerable success with the comedy drama &quot;Die Brautfahrt, oder Kunz von der Rosen&quot; (1844). This was followed by a volume of unimportant poems, &quot;In Breslau&quot; (1845), and the dramas &quot;Die Valentine&quot; (1846) and &quot;Graf Waldemar&quot; (1847). He at last attained a prominent position by his comedy, The Journalists (1852), one of the best German comedies of the 19th century.

In 1847, he moved to Berlin, and in the following year took over, in conjunction with Julian Schmidt, the editorship of &quot;Die Grenzboten&quot;, a weekly journal which, founded in 1841, now became the leading organ of German and Austrian liberalism. Freytag helped to conduct it until 1861, and again from 1867 until 1870, when for a short time he edited a new periodical, &quot;Im neuen Reich&quot;. In 1863 he developed what is known as Freytag&#x27;s Pyramid.

Freytag died in Wiesbaden on 30 April 1895.

==Works==

===&quot;Debit and Credit&quot;===
Freytag&#x27;s literary fame was made universal by the publication in 1855 of his novel, &quot;Soll und Haben&quot; (&quot;Debit and Credit&quot;), which was translated into almost all European languages. It was translated into English by Georgiana Harcourt in 1857.

It was hailed as one of the best German novels and praised for its sturdy but unexaggerated realism. Its main purpose is the recommendation of the German middle class as the soundest element in the nation, but it also has a more directly patriotic intention in the contrast it draws between the supposedly homely virtues of the German, while presenting in negative light Poles and Jews. In the novel a Jewish merchant is presented as a villain and threat to Germany. German colonists are presented as &quot;superior&quot; to &quot;wild&quot;, &quot;inferior&quot; and &quot;uncivilized&quot; Poles who are also shown sometimes in racist terms. The novel affirmed the claim of German &quot;masters&quot; to seize the land of the &quot;weaker race&quot; justified by supposedly &quot;superior&quot; German culture. The novel applied blatant racism to Slavs while focusing on Poles; author stated that Poles have &quot;no culture&quot; and are unable to create civilization. Freytag also claimed that Poles will only become proper human beings through German rule and colonization, and giving up their language and culture. &quot;Soll und Haben&quot; set an example for a body of colonial literature about the &quot;eastern marches&quot; and also started a public-reinterpretation of the Ostsiedlung, which was now presented as historical mission of the Germans (&quot;Kulturträger&quot;), legitimizing continued occupation of Polish areas and suppressions of Polish population.

===&quot;Die verlorene Handschrift&quot;===
At the duke&#x27;s request, Freytag was attached to the staff of the Crown Prince of Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, and was present at the Battles of Wörth and Sedan. Before this, he had published another novel, &quot;Die verlorene Handschrift&quot; (1864), in which he endeavoured to do for German university life what &quot;Soll und Haben&quot; had done for commercial life. The hero is a young German professor, who is so wrapped up in his search for a manuscript by Tacitus that he is oblivious to an impending tragedy in his domestic life. The book was, however, less successful than its predecessor.

===&quot;Bilder aus der deutschen Vergangenheit&quot;===
Between 1859 and 1867, Freytag published in five volumes &quot;Bilder aus der deutschen Vergangenheit&quot;, a work on popular lines, illustrating the history and manners of Germany. In 1872, he began a work with a similar patriotic purpose, &quot;Die Ahnen&quot;, a series of historical romances in which he unfolds the history of a German family from the earliest times to the middle of the 19th century. This series comprises the following novels:
#&quot;Ingo und Ingraban&quot; (1872)
#&quot;Das Nest der Zaunkönige&quot; (1874)
#&quot;Die Brüder vom deutschen Hause&quot; (1875)
#&quot;Marcus König&quot; (1876)
#&quot;Die Geschwister&quot; (1878)
#&quot;Aus einer kleinen Stadt&quot; (1880).

===Other works===
Freytag&#x27;s other works include:
* &quot;Die Technik des Dramas&quot; (1863), in which he explained a system for dramatic structure, later named &quot;Freytag&#x27;s Pyramid&quot;. Published in an English translation as &quot;Freytag&#x27;s Technique of the Drama: An Exposition of Dramatic Composition and Art&quot; in 1894.
* a biography of the Baden statesman Karl Mathy (1869)
* an autobiography (&quot;Erinnerungen aus meinen Leben&quot;, 1887)
* his &quot;Gesammelte Aufsätze&quot;, chiefly reprinted from the &quot;Grenzboten&quot; (1888); &quot;Der Kronprinz wed die deutsche Kaiserkrone&quot;; and &quot;Erinnerungsbidtter&quot; (1889)
* a biography of &quot;Martin Luther&quot; 1896

===Political activity===
Freytag authored anti-Polish pamphlets. In 1863 Freytag commented that if Poles ever get free from Russian rule in Russian Partition, then Germany should conquer them, stating &quot;We shall make their land German&quot; and that the Poles are facing not the German government but &quot;the entire German nation&quot;. 
Being a native of a province which in his mind owed everything to the Kingdom of Prussia, he was an earnest champion of Prussian hegemony over Germany. His powerful advocacy of this idea in his &quot;Grenzboten&quot; gained him the friendship of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, whose neighbor he had become, on acquiring the estate of Siebleben near Gotha.

===Complete works===
Freytag&#x27;s &quot;Gesammelte Werke&quot; were published in 22 volumes, at Leipzig (1886–1888); his &quot;Vermischte Aufsatze&quot; have been edited by E. Elster, autobiography mentioned above, the lives by C. Alberti (Leipzig, 1890) and F. Seiler (Leipzig, 1898).

<doc id="728892" wikidata="Q205981" url="?curid=728892" title="Alexander Friedmann">
<text>Alexander Alexandrovich Friedmann (also spelled Friedman or Fridman; ; ; – September 16, 1925) was a Russian and Soviet physicist and mathematician. He originated the pioneering theory that the universe is expanding, governed by a set of equations he developed known as the Friedmann equations.

==Early life==
Alexander Friedmann was born to the composer and ballet dancer Alexander Friedmann (who was a son of a baptized Jewish cantonist) and the pianist Ludmila Ignatievna Voyachek (who was a daughter of the Czech composer Hynek Vojáček). Friedmann was baptized into the Russian Orthodox Church as an infant, and lived much of his life in Saint Petersburg.

Friedmann obtained his degree from St. Petersburg State University in 1910, and became a lecturer at Saint Petersburg Mining Institute.

From his school days, Friedmann found a lifelong companion in Jacob Tamarkin, who was also a distinguished mathematician.

==World War I==
Friedmann fought in World War I on behalf of Imperial Russia, as an army aviator, an instructor, and eventually, under the revolutionary regime, as the head of an airplane factory.

==Professorship==
Friedmann in 1922 introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter. Correspondence with Einstein suggests that Einstein was unwilling to accept the idea of an evolving Universe and worked instead to revise his equations to support the static, eternal Universe of Newton&#x27;s time. In 1929 Hubble published the redshift vs distance relationship showing that all the galaxies in the neighborhood recede at a rate proportional to their distance, formalizing an observation made earlier by Carl Wilhelm Wirtz. Unaware of Friedmann&#x27;s work, in 1927 Belgian astronomer Georges Lemaître independently formulated an evolving Universe.

In June 1925 Friedmann was given the job of the director of the Main Geophysical Observatory in Leningrad. In July 1925 he participated in a record-setting balloon flight, reaching the elevation of .

==Work==
Friedmann&#x27;s 1924 papers, including &quot;&quot; (&quot;On the possibility of a world with constant negative curvature of space&quot;) published by the German physics journal &quot;Zeitschrift für Physik&quot; (Vol. 21, pp. 326–332), demonstrated that he had command of all three Friedmann models describing positive, zero and negative curvature respectively, a decade before Robertson and Walker published their analysis.

This dynamic cosmological model of general relativity would come to form the standard for both the Big Bang and Steady State theories. Friedmann&#x27;s work supported both theories equally, so it was not until the detection of the cosmic microwave background radiation that the Steady State theory was abandoned in favor of the current favorite Big Bang paradigm.

The classic solution of the Einstein field equations that describes a homogeneous and isotropic universe was called the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric, or &quot;FLRW&quot;, after Friedmann, Georges Lemaître, Howard P. Robertson and Arthur Geoffrey Walker, who worked on the problem in the 1920s and 30s independently of Friedmann.

In addition to general relativity, Friedmann&#x27;s interests included hydrodynamics and meteorology.

Physicists George Gamow, Vladimir Fock, and Lev Vasilievich Keller were among his students.

==Personal life and death==

In 1911, he married Ekaterina Dorofeeva, though he later divorced her. He married Natalia Malinina in 1923. They had a religious wedding ceremony, though both were far from religious. Together they had a son Alexander Alexandrovich Friedman (1925—1983), born after his father&#x27;s death.

Friedmann died on September 16, 1925, from misdiagnosed typhoid fever. He had allegedly contracted the bacteria on return from his honeymoon in Crimea, when he ate an unwashed pear bought at a railway station.

==Legacy==
The Moon crater Fridman is named after him.

Alexander Friedmann International Seminar is a periodical scientific event. The objective of the meeting is to promote contact between scientists working in the field of Relativity, Gravitation and Cosmology, and related fields. The First Alexander Friedmann International Seminar on Gravitation and Cosmology devoted to the centenary of his birth took place in 1988.

During the 2022 COVID-19 protests in China, Tsinghua University students were seen displaying Friedmann&#x27;s equation as if it were a protest slogan, which was understood as an evasion of censorship by punning multilingually on &quot;free man&quot; and referring to liberalization and opening via the expansion of the universe.

<doc id="728898" wikidata="Q1157739" url="?curid=728898" title="Tower of Silence">
<text>A dakhma (), otherwise referred to as Tower of Silence (), is a circular, raised structure built by Zoroastrians for excarnation (that is, the exposure of human corpses to the elements with the purpose to enable their decomposition), in order to avoid contamination of the soil and other natural elements by the decomposing dead bodies. Carrion birds, usually vultures and other scavengers, consume the flesh. Skeletal remains are gathered into a central pit where further weathering and continued breakdown occurs.

==Ritual exposure by Iranian peoples==
Zoroastrian ritual exposure of the dead is first attested in the mid-5th century BCE &quot;Histories&quot; of Herodotus, an Ancient Greek historian who observed the custom amongst Iranian expatriates in Asia Minor; however, the use of towers is first documented in the early 9th century CE. In Herodotus&#x27; account (in &quot;Histories&quot; i.140), the Zoroastrian funerary rites are said to have been &quot;secret&quot;; however they were first performed after the body had been dragged around by a bird or dog. The corpse was then embalmed with wax and laid in a trench.

Writing on the culture of the Persians, Herodotus reports on the Persian burial customs performed by the magi, again, kept secret, according to his account. However, he writes that he knows they expose the body of male dead to dogs and birds of prey, then they cover the corpse in wax, and then it is buried. The Achaemenid custom for the dead is recorded in the regions of Bactria, Sogdia, and Hyrcania, but not in Western Iran.

The discovery of ossuaries in both Eastern and Western Iran dating to the 5th and 4th centuries BCE indicate that bones were sometimes isolated, but separation occurring through ritual exposure cannot be assumed: burial mounds, where the bodies were wrapped in wax, have also been discovered. The tombs of the Achaemenid emperors at Naqsh-e Rustam and Pasargadae likewise suggest non-exposure, at least until the bones could be collected. According to legend (incorporated by Ferdowsi into his ; ), Zoroaster himself is interred in a tomb at Balkh (in present-day Afghanistan).

The Byzantine historian Agathias has described the Zoroastrian burial of the Sasanian general Mihr-Mihroe: &quot;the attendants of Mermeroes took up his body and removed it to a place outside the city and laid it there as it was, alone and uncovered according to their traditional custom, as refuse for dogs and horrible carrion&quot;.
Towers are a much later invention and are first documented in the early 9th century CE. The funerary ritual customs surrounding that practice appear to date to the Sassanid era (3rd–7th CE). They are known in detail from the supplement to the &quot;Shayest ne Shayest&quot;, the two &quot;Rivayat&quot; collections, and the two &quot;Saddar&quot;s.

One of the earliest literary descriptions of such a building appears in the late 9th-century Epistles of Manushchihr, where the technical term is , &#x27;ossuary&#x27;. Another term that appears in the 9th- to 10th-century texts of Zoroastrian tradition (the so-called &quot;Pahlavi books&quot;) is ; in its earliest usage, it referred to any place for the dead.

==Rationale==
The doctrinal rationale for exposure is to avoid contact with earth, water, or fire, all three of which are considered sacred in the Zoroastrian religion. 

Zoroastrian tradition considers human cadavers and animal corpses (in addition to cut hair and nail parings) to be &quot;nasu&quot;, i.e. unclean, polluting. Specifically, the corpse demon (), is believed to rush into the body and contaminate everything it comes into contact with. For this reason, the (an ecclesiastical code whose title means, &#x27;given against the demons&#x27;) has rules for disposing of the dead as safely as possible. Moreover, the requires that graves, and raised tombs as well, must be destroyed.

To preclude the pollution of the sacred elements: earth (), water (), and fire (), the bodies of the dead are placed at the top of towers and there exposed to the sun and to scavenging birds and necrophagous animals such as wild dogs. Thus, as an early-20th-century Secretary of the Mumbai Parsi community explained: &quot;putrefaction with all its concomitant evils... is most effectually prevented.&quot;

==In current times==
===Structure and process===
Modern-day towers, which are fairly uniform in their construction, have an almost flat roof, with the perimeter being slightly higher than the centre. The roof is divided into three concentric rings: the bodies of men are arranged around the outer ring, women in the second ring, and children in the innermost ring. The ritual precinct may be entered only by a special class of pallbearers, called , from the , consisting of the word elements, (&#x27;caretaker&#x27;) and (&#x27;pollutants&#x27;). 

Once the bones have been bleached by the sun and wind, which can take as long as a year, they are collected in an ossuary pit at the centre of the tower, where—assisted by lime—they gradually disintegrate, and the remaining material, along with rainwater run-off, seeps through multiple coal and sand filters before being eventually washed out to sea.

The precipitous decline in the vulture population in India due to poisoning has led the Parsi community to explore alternatives to standard dakhmas.

===Iran===

In the Iranian Zoroastrian tradition, the towers were built atop hills or low mountains in locations distant from population centres. In the early 20th century, Iranian Zoroastrians gradually discontinued their use and began to favour burial or cremation.

The decision to change the system was accelerated by three considerations: the first problem arose with the establishment of the Dar ul-Funun medical school. Since Islam considers dissection of corpses as an unnecessary form of mutilation, thus forbidding it, there were no corpses for study available through official channels. The towers were repeatedly broken into, much to the dismay of the Zoroastrian community. Secondly, while the towers had been built away from population centres, the growth of the towns led to the towers now being within city limits. Finally, many of the Zoroastrians found the system outdated. Following long negotiations between the societies of Kerman, and Tehran, the latter gained a majority and established a cemetery some from Tehran at Ghassr-e Firouzeh (Firouzeh&#x27;s Palace). The graves were lined with rocks and plastered with cement to prevent direct contact with the earth. In Kerman, older orthodox Zoroastrians continued to maintain a tower for a few years after a cemetery was built. Yazdi Zoroastrians continued using the Tower of Silence until the city asked them to close it in 1974.

===India===

Following the rapid expansion of the Indian cities, the squat buildings are today in or near population centres, but separated from the metropolitan bustle by gardens or forests. In Parsi Zoroastrian tradition, exposure of the dead is also considered to be an individual&#x27;s final act of charity, providing the birds with what would otherwise be destroyed.

In the late 20th century and early 21st century, the vulture population on the Indian subcontinent declined (see Indian vulture crisis) by over 97% as of 2008, primarily due to diclofenac poisoning of the birds following the introduction of that drug for livestock in the 1990s, until banned for cattle by the Government of India in 2006. The few surviving birds are often unable to fully consume the bodies. In 2001, Parsi communities in India were evaluating captive breeding of vultures and the use of &quot;solar concentrators&quot; (which are essentially large mirrors) to accelerate decomposition. Some have been forced to resort to burial, as the solar collectors work only in clear weather. Vultures used to dispose of a body in minutes, and no other method has proved fully effective.

The right to use the Towers of Silence is a much-debated issue among the Parsi community. The facilities are usually managed by the anjumans, the predominantly conservative local Zoroastrian associations, which usually consist of a nine-member board including five priests. In accordance with Indian statutes, these associations have domestic authority over trust properties and have the right to grant or restrict entry and use, with the result that the associations frequently prohibit the use by the offspring of a &quot;mixed marriage&quot;, that is, where one parent is a Parsi and the other is not.

The towers remain in use as sacred locations for the Parsi community, and non-members may not enter them. In Mumbai, visitors are shown a model of a tower. Organized tours can be taken to the site.

====Architectural and functional features====
* The towers are uniform in their construction.
* The roof of the tower is lower in the middle than the outer and is divided into three concentric circles.
* The dead bodies are placed on stone beds on the roof of the tower and there is a central ossuary pit, into which the bodies fall after being eaten by vultures.
* The bodies disintegrate naturally assisted with lime and the remaining is washed off by rainwater into multiple filters of coal and sand, finally reaching the sea.

<text>Jerome Isaac Friedman (born March 28, 1930) is an American physicist. He is institute professor and professor of physics, emeritus, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He won the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physics along with Henry Kendall and Richard Taylor, &quot;for their pioneering investigations concerning deep inelastic scattering of electrons on protons and bound neutrons, which have been of essential importance for the development of the quark model in particle physics.&quot;, work which showed an internal structure for protons later known to be quarks. Friedman sits on the board of sponsors of the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;.

==Life and career==

Born in Chicago, Illinois to Lillian (&quot;née&quot; Warsaw) and Selig Friedman, a sewing machine salesman, Friedman&#x27;s Jewish parents emigrated to the U.S. from Russia. Jerome Friedman excelled in art but became interested in physics after reading a book on relativity written by Albert Einstein. He turned down a scholarship to the Art Institute of Chicago in order to study physics at the University of Chicago. Whilst there he worked under Enrico Fermi, and eventually received his Ph.D. in physics in 1956. In 1960, he joined the physics faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

In 1968–69, commuting between MIT and California, he conducted experiments with Henry W. Kendall and Richard E. Taylor at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center which gave the first experimental evidence that protons had an internal structure, later known to be quarks. For this, Friedman, Kendall and Taylor shared the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physics. He is an institute professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Friedman is also a member of the board of sponsors of the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;.

In 2003, he was one of 22 Nobel laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto. He is an atheist.

Friedman is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May 2008, urging him to &quot;reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill&quot; by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

== Popular Culture ==
Prof Friedman appeared on an episode of Da Ali G Show, where Sacha Baron Cohen interviews Jerome as a fictional character called Ali G.

<text>Shatterstar (Gaveedra-Seven) is a mutant superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Fabian Nicieza and artist Rob Liefeld, the character first appeared in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #99 (March 1991), after which he became a member of the superhero team X-Force. He later became an employee of X-Factor Investigations, a private detective firm starring in the series &quot;X-Factor&quot;. In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked Shatterstar as #29 on their list of the &quot;50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics&quot;.

Shatterstar is an unusual character among Marvel&#x27;s mutant superheroes in &quot;X-Men&quot; books in that, although a human mutant, he was raised in an alternate dimension known as Mojoworld with no knowledge of his origins. When he arrives on Earth he has little understanding of Earth relationships, customs, and culture. At the time of his introduction, he largely conformed to 1990s comics trends: an emotionally closed off, brutal, macho warrior. Subsequent writers, such as Jeph Loeb, later attempted to show the character&#x27;s adjustment to human norms and his development of close friendships on Earth, and in particular with his teammate Rictor. An early mystery about the character concerned his strange similarities to the mutant hero Longshot, which was later resolved in a 2010s storyline that explained he was the son of Longshot and Dazzler, sent a century back in time by a future Shatterstar. Paradoxically, his DNA was then used to create Longshot.

Since 2007, the character has been portrayed as an outgoing pansexual superhero in an on-off relationship with his superhero colleague Rictor. His creators Nicieza and Liefeld criticized the development, having previously depicted the character as asexual since their initial creation in 1991. &quot;X-Factor&quot; writer Peter David introduced the romantic pairing with Rictor, building off of fan desire to see the characters together in a gay relationship. The character has since been prominently featured by Marvel as an example of LGBTQIA representation, portrayed by writers as a &quot;swashbuckling, enthusiastic&quot; figure, in contrast to his earlier stern and taciturn appearances.

Shatterstar appeared in &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; (2018) and the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; (2024), portrayed by Lewis Tan.

==Creation==
Liefeld spoke on the character&#x27;s creation &quot;I went into my files and found the original source of my inspiration for SHATTERSTAR. Carl Pott’s original sketch for Longshot had the white costume and the Eye Tattoo - Art Adams played with a version of this himself back in 1984. Knowing that Shatterstar was from Longshot’s reality, I fashioned this first look after the original un-used design, albeit with longer hair. This is why you listen to the experts, not wannabe revisionists.&quot;

==Publication history==

Shatterstar first appeared in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #99 (March 1991), and was created by Fabian Nicieza and Rob Liefeld. He also appeared on a pin-up bonus cover in &quot;The New Mutants Annual&quot; #6 (July 1990) as part of a &#x27;Vision to Come&#x27;, predating his appearance in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #99.

Since his debut Shatterstar has mainly appeared in the original &quot;X-Force&quot; title, with some issues devoted solely to him. In 2005, the character was featured in his own limited series, &quot;X-Force: Shatterstar&quot;. Shatterstar became a member of X-Factor in &quot;X-Factor&quot; #45 (August 2009).

Shatterstar also starred in a 5-issue solo-run in 2018 titled &quot;Shatterstar&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
Shatterstar is an artificial human from Mojo&#x27;s planet Mojoworld a century in the future who was genetically engineered to serve as a gladiator. Eventually, he escaped and joined the Cadre Alliance, the rebel group that sought to overthrow Mojo&#x27;s dictatorship. From there, he learned the Cadre&#x27;s language and began taking part in missions.

On one of these missions, Arize sent him back in time to Earth to find the X-Men and get their assistance in defeating and overthrowing Mojo. He did not find the X-Men though. Shatterstar was either teleported or traveled back in time to Earth at the point just before Cable reorganized the New Mutants into X-Force. At first, he battled Cable, Domino, and the New Mutants, but after they talked with him the mutants aided him against the Imperial Protectorate. With Cable&#x27;s assurance that they would help him defeat Mojo (though with the use of time travel it was not urgent that they leave anytime soon) Shatterstar became a founding member of the new team, X-Force.

With X-Force on their first mission, Shatterstar battled the Alliance of Evil, and first encountered the New Warriors. He battled Night Thrasher and Silhouette. With X-Force, the New Warriors, Moira MacTaggert&#x27;s &quot;Muir Island X-Men&quot; team, and X-Factor, he battled Proteus.

X-Force&#x27;s next mission involved attacking the Mutant Liberation Front base, where Shatterstar battled Reaper. With X-Force and Spider-Man, he next battled Tom Cassidy and Juggernaut. With X-Force, he battled the Toad&#x27;s Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.

Later Shatterstar discovered, to his bewilderment, that he also had the memories of an Earthling named Benjamin Russell. Soon afterwards, Mojo made Cable and Shatterstar his prisoners and transformed them into digital images for one of his television programs. In the course of the show, Shatterstar was mortally wounded in combat. Mojo&#x27;s ally Spiral teleported Cable and Shatterstar back into reality, where they regained their true forms. Spiral brought Cable, Shatterstar, Longshot (who was Shatterstar&#x27;s ally on Mojoworld), and the X-Force member Siryn to the Weisman Institute for the Criminally Insane in Rutland, Vermont. There Spiral directed them to the bedside of one of its patients, a mutant named Benjamin Russell who had no living relatives, had been in a coma since his powers had emerged, and, curiously, looked identical to Shatterstar. Longshot transferred Shatterstar&#x27;s soul into Benjamin Russell&#x27;s body, causing it to take on his appearance. Restored to peak health and full consciousness, and feeling &quot;whole&quot; for the first time in his life, Shatterstar resumed his work as a member of X-Force.
However, this does not explain why Shatterstar had some of Benjamin Russell&#x27;s memories before they merged, or why they looked so much alike. There are still too many mysteries yet to be explained about Shatterstar&#x27;s true origin. It was hinted that Shatterstar may have been the child of Longshot and the mutant X-Man Dazzler in the early run of X-Men in 1992, and in 2009, Rob Liefeld confirmed that Shatterstar &quot;was pitched as Longshot&#x27;s son&quot;. A later medical exam conducted by Beast upon Shatterstar revealed that he possessed DNA identical to that of Longshot, his rumored father, along with such genetic features as hollow bones and a lack of white blood cells.

Dazzler revealed that she was pregnant with Longshot&#x27;s child and Longshot suggested the name &quot;Shatterstar&quot; for the unborn child. Longshot and Dazzler returned to Mojoworld to free Longshot&#x27;s people and Dazzler later appeared without Longshot and without a child. It was speculated that Dazzler miscarried, though it was not established until a 2013 comic by Peter David what became of the infant; the child&#x27;s future self, Shatterstar, wiped his parents&#x27; memories of his birth and arranged for him to be transported to the future.

Shatterstar accompanied Rictor to the Richter home in Mexico to try to end Rictor&#x27;s family&#x27;s arms-dealing business.

Shatterstar is later seen in Madripoor, earning his money by fighting in arenas. He was sought out by Spiral, who had one of her agents make Shatterstar believe she wanted to kill him. However, Spiral had previously admitted in an emotional confession to Cable, when he demanded that she reveal all that she knew about the answers behind the mysteries of Shatterstar&#x27;s origin immediately after Shatterstar and Benjamin Russell had been merged, that both young men &quot;meant more than life itself to her&quot; before teleporting away. With a fake quest, Spiral lured Shatterstar to an alternate universe she had conquered and ruled. On that Earth, Spiral had also killed most of that world&#x27;s heroes and mutants. That Earth&#x27;s Shatterstar had been killed as well. He was found by that Earth&#x27;s rebel forces, including Cable and some other members he knew from X-Force. Together, they eventually defeated Spiral. Upon returning to the mainstream Earth, Shatterstar was contacted by Cable and requested to temporarily join him on a mission to defeat the Skornn. Shatterstar agreed, but first Cable wanted him to train with the monks on Mount Xixabangma. After those monks were killed by Skornn&#x27;s worshipers, Shatterstar was reunited with his old team and they eventually killed the Skornn.

Following M-Day and the passing of the Superhuman Registration Act, Shatterstar teamed up with Domino and Caliban (all X-Force members) to break The 198 out of the encampment set up for mutants on the grounds of the Xavier Institute. They took the escapees to a secret base provided to them by Captain America via Nick Fury. While fighting O*N*E, he nearly killed Micromax, claiming that while there is no such thing as murder during war, he had only meant to disable him.

===X-Factor===
In a 2009 &quot;X-Factor&quot; story, Shatterstar, whose mind is being controlled by the villain Cortex, attacks Strong Guy and Rictor. Shatterstar is broken out of his trance-like state when Cortex&#x27;s control over him is interrupted. Upon recognizing Rictor, he kisses him passionately. Journeying to Detroit, Cortex confronts Longshot and the two fight. As Cortex attempts to gain control over Longshot, he is startled that Longshot, like Shatterstar, is extradimensional (limiting his degree of control) and that the two men are somehow related.

Rictor and Shatterstar&#x27;s relationship experiences conflict because Shatterstar—who now feels romantic and sexual potential within him for the first time—wishes to explore this whole new aspect of his life, desiring an open relationship. Rictor, more fully committed to maintaining theirs as a monogamous relationship, feels hurt by Shatterstar&#x27;s need for sexual exploration. Things are complicated further when Rahne Sinclair walks in on them during an intimate moment, which leads to a brief fight between Shatterstar and Rahne. Rictor stays to take care of a pregnant Rahne, who attempts to mislead him into thinking the baby is his, while Shatterstar goes off on a mission for X-Factor. On mission, he encounters the child&#x27;s real father, Hrimhari, which he is able to report back to Rictor.

During the &quot;Hell on Earth War&quot; storyline, Shatterstar and Rictor are blasted by the God of Hell, Mephisto, and appear to die, but are in fact sent into Mojoworld&#x27;s relative past—to the era of Shatterstar&#x27;s arrival in Mojoworld, as shown in the final X-Factor story arc, &quot;The End of X-Factor&quot;. Rictor and the audience learn that Shatterstar is the only Mojoworld rebel who was not created by Arize the Creator, as he mysteriously appeared from the sky one day. Arize then used Shatterstar&#x27;s genetic material to create Longshot, making Shatterstar Longshot&#x27;s father genetically. Mojo later attacks Arize&#x27;s sanctuary, leading Shatterstar to time-teleport him and Rictor. They arrive later in Mojoworld&#x27;s history, when Dazzler and Longshot are married and fighting a war against Mojo. Dazzler goes into labor, and gives birth to a young Shatterstar, who Shatterstar explains to Rictor he will deliver to the future of Mojoworld to be raised by the people that raised him, but not before he erases Dazzler and Longshot&#x27;s memories of their having a child.

===New Tian===
During &quot;Secret Empire&quot;, it is revealed that Shatterstar and Rictor returned to the present. He is part of the New Tian residents, along with Rictor and many other mutants. After New Tian was dismantled, Rictor told Iceman that he and Shatterstar were now on a break.

===Landlord of Manor Crossing===
Feeling unsure about himself and his relationship with Rictor, Shatterstar ended things between them. Newly single, Shatterstar bought a property using the earnings he had made and named it Manor Crossing. He offered the rooms to multi-dimensional refugees like himself and served as both landlord and protector to his tenants. When Shatterstar&#x27;s tenants were kidnapped by the Mojoworld mercenary group the Death Sponsors and their leader, former ally Gringrave, Shatterstar vowed to bring them home.

With help from Rictor, Shatterstar followed the group to the world of Horus IV, which was ruled by the Grandmaster. Grandmaster tasked Gringrave with the kidnapping, hoping to use a gladiatorial battle between the enemies to satisfy the Horuvians&#x27; lust for bloody conflict.

After Shatterstar killed Gringrave in revenge for her actions, Grandmaster himself entered the arena, seeking to gain control of Shatterstar for all eternity. But Shatterstar refused to concede and defeated Grandmaster by teleporting them to Earth-1218, a world where super-powered beings do not exist and Grandmaster&#x27;s god powers could not work. Shatterstar was then rescued by Rictor, who reached out across the universe to find him and bring him home.

===eXtermination===
Shatterstar was shocked when his former mentor Cable was slain while attempting to protect the time-displaced Iceman. When it was revealed that a younger version of Cable was responsible, Shatterstar partnered with his former X-Force teammates to hunt down Kid Cable and have him answer for his crime. During the search, Shatterstar was turned into one of Ahab&#x27;s mutant-hunting hounds and attempted to kill the time-displaced Jean Grey. Shatterstar was subdued by Cannonball and freed of Ahab&#x27;s influence.

===Krakoa===
Shatterstar was of the many mutants that joined the mutant nation of Krakoa upon its creation. He was seen alongside many other Krakoans grieving Charles Xavier&#x27;s death at the hands of anti-mutant super-human criminals that had infiltrated Krakoa and killed many of its residents, including Xavier.

At some point, Shatterstar returned to Mojoworld, becoming the dimension&#x27;s most subscribed and top-ranked live-streamer. However, Shatterstar began to feel trapped by the celebrity status he had created for himself. When fellow live-streamer Wind Dancer arranged for her own death to satisfy her fans, Shatterstar secretly informed the Krakoan X-Factor team of her death so they could claim Wind Dancer&#x27;s body before Arize could produce a clone and force her to resume her stream. X-Factor was successful in their mission, but were forced to leave Shatterstar behind. They promised to return and rescue him. The team eventually made good on this promise coming back alongside the New Mutants and arranging the freedom of all mutants there. After this they recruited Shatterstar to defeat The Morrigan, freeing Siryn from her control.

He was then rewarded with memories of his past, which lead to him seeking Rictor out during the Hellfire Gala, after which they sat on the coastline of the newly created Braddock Isle and caught up with one another. The two seemingly got back together after this and he accompanied him on a mission to Otherworld with Excalibur investigating a brewing war, between Merlyn and King Arthur against mutantkind.

After Merlyn overthrew Saturnyne, took control of Otherworld and chased out most of its mutant population, Excalibur decided to have Mordred resurrected on Krakoa using a vial of Otherworldly water in place of the standard genetic material, after finding out he was a mutant because he was prophesied to defeat King Arthur. The Otherworldly magic involved made for an atypical resurrection, as Mordred immediately disappeared from the egg and found himself in Otherworld. Rictor and Shatterstar were among the eight mutants Roma was able to bring back to Otherworld, while there they found former Excalibur member Kylun and shortly afterward Mordred, returned to a young age facing Arthur&#x27;s forces. He presented himself to the team and asked for asylum. At that moment, Roma Regina gave all those present a magical vision, declaring them the Knights of X, and giving them a quest to find the lost Siege Perilous.

His first mission with this new team was to Blightspoke, a poisoned land where the remnants of collapsed realities are buried, and while there he and Rictor fought the Vescora and the team found its only resident Sheriff Gia Whitechapel and her crew imprisoned in a factory the makes solid Brightswill, a mutant depowering substance. The couple destroyed the factory with Gia&#x27;s help, then the team headed toward Savalith, an ancient civilization founded by vampire-like beings. After regrouping to save Mad Jim Jaspers in The Crooked Marked, Gambit sacrificed himself against King Arthur&#x27;s forces gaining the team access to Mercator, an Otherworld domain created by Mister M out of the Siege Perilous. There they sank into the quicksand and were psychologically tested by the land, until Rachel Summers was able to break them out of the illusion. Afterwards Arthur&#x27;s forces, Merlyn&#x27;s forces and Roma and Saturnyne riding Shogo all converged to their location.

==Powers and abilities==
Shatterstar possesses an overall superhuman level of physical and mental attributes (senses, strength, speed, reflexes, agility, flexibility, stamina, and intelligence), as a result of the extra-dimensional genetic engineering that created him. Shatterstar&#x27;s strength allows him to wield a heavy barbell as easy as a bō (staff) and slam the Thing of the Fantastic Four through a window of the Baxter Building. Shatterstar&#x27;s speed and agility are enhanced to the point that members of the Mutant Response Division expect him to be capable of dodging point-blank automatic weapons firing from at least three trained agents.

He is an excellent military strategist and has had extensive training in many forms of the martial arts and interpersonal combat of Mojoworld; in particular, he is a master swordsman. His bones are hollow, making him far lighter than he looks and further increasing his athletic and acrobatic skills. He also has enhanced learning capabilities, being able to quickly learn and master languages and technology. He customarily wields two single-edged swords with spiked hand-guards and on occasion carries other weaponry as well. Shatterstar is able to regenerate damaged or destroyed tissue much faster than an ordinary human. Injuries such as slashes and stabbings heal completely within a matter of hours. Additionally, he possesses the ability to shift his internal organs within his body, lessening the chances of serious wounds that get through his body armor. He has also been mentioned as having a lack of white blood cells, and DNA identical to his former teammate and father, Longshot.

He also has the mutant ability to control frequencies of electricity, which he can use to generate powerful bioelectric vibratory shockwaves, and can even channel bioelectric charges through his metallic blade weaponry; he rarely uses this power as it tends to exhaust him, but once used it as a surprise attack/secret technique to apparently kill Reaper of the MLF.

After Shatterstar returned from the Mojoverse, he demonstrated the ability to open an X-shaped portal capable of teleporting individuals to their desired locations. This ability requires another individual to serve as the &quot;focus,&quot; picturing the destination. Creating such portals generates enough energy that it must be done outside, otherwise risking significant damage to any structure within which they are built. Shatterstar also requires a minimum of three to four hours to recharge between portal creation and since it requires his own energies. This ability is not actually artificial but merely another aspect of his ability to channel his energies through his swords. Should his concentration be interrupted while an individual or object is partway through, those parts will be severed, ending up in the separate locations, the destination and the starting point of the portal. During the &quot;Shatterstar&quot; miniseries of 2018 this was partially clarified in that his bioelectric powers are only the means to his teleportation capabilities and teleportation is actually his primary mutation. It was shown that he is able to use his hands to open portals, and does not need either his swords nor an actual other person as anchor if he wants to open a portal to where he already has been (using instead the memory of smell and sight) and he is able to traverse dimensions as well as interstellar distances, but not travel through time by himself.

==Reception==
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Shatterstar 24th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.
* In 2018, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Shatterstar 14th in their &quot;X-Force: 20 Powerful Members&quot; list.

==Sexual orientation==
Although Shatterstar was revealed to have a designated &quot;genetic bond mate&quot;, Windsong (whom he never met and is now deceased), in the Mojoverse, he later claimed that even though he was fully capable physically, he had never felt any sexual stirrings or romantic love—indicating a form of asexuality—and has long felt &quot;lacking&quot;, even in his native dimension.

This has since been retconned to be a lie on Shatterstar&#x27;s part, as it is revealed in his Revised origin in his 2018 mini-series that he already had a sexual/romantic relationship with his gladiatorial mentor/partner Gringrave, which ended when she betrayed him by tricking him into becoming a murderer, causing him to rebel against Mojo V.

Since then his emotional state has been fluctuating. While in X-Force, he displayed emotion, having developed a close—and somewhat ambiguous—friendship with Rictor. &quot;X-Force&quot; writer Jeph Loeb hinted that Shatterstar had romantic feelings for Rictor and was planning on making the two a couple, but he left the title before he could make this happen.

Writer Peter David reflects that being the subject of &quot;prolonged exposure to Earth&quot; and around Rictor changed things for the warrior, and he began to develop a real romantic capacity. In &quot;X-Factor&quot; (vol. 3) #45 (August 2009), Shatterstar and Rictor kiss. Shortly after the issue was published, Peter David confirmed Rictor and Shatterstar&#x27;s relationship on his blog and expressed his desire to explore it further.

Shatterstar&#x27;s co-creator, Rob Liefeld expressed disapproval with Shatterstar not being asexual, saying that Shatterstar was meant to be &quot;asexual, and struggling to understand human behavior.&quot; Fabian Nicieza stated, &quot;In my final issue, I pretty clearly stated that Shatterstar had &quot;no&quot; real understanding of sexuality – homo or hetero – and needed to learn about general human nature before he could define his own sexual identity.&quot; He added that &quot;I had planned to make Shatterstar think he was in love with Rictor, but only because he simply didn&#x27;t know any better about what love &quot;was&quot;. He would have figured, this is my best friend, I care about him, he cares about me, we spend time together, fight together, laugh together – I guess I must be in love with him.&quot; Marvel Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada defended the development, and stated that if Rob Liefeld wanted it changed, he would have to &quot;take it up with the next editor-in-chief&quot;. Similarly, Peter David also defended the storyline, citing the work of other writers after Rob Liefield&#x27;s tenure on the character, who hinted at the attraction between the two characters. David explained in an interview that he took inspiration from &quot;Torchwood&quot; character Jack Harkness, whom David describes as &quot;swashbuckling, enthusiastic and sexually curious about anything with a pulse.&quot; As such, David&#x27;s &quot;X-Factor&quot; sees Shatterstar want to have a sexually open relationship on account of having been (as in Liefeld&#x27;s stories) sexually and romantically closed off to the world all his life. In the letter column to issue 232, a fan criticized David for conflating bisexuality with polyamory, to which David responded that Shatterstar is both bisexual and polyamorous.

<text>Barbara Fritchie (née Hauer; December 3, 1766 – December 18, 1862), also known as Barbara Frietchie, and sometimes spelled Frietschie, was a Unionist during the Civil War. She became part of American folklore in part from a popular poem by John Greenleaf Whittier.

==Early life==
Fritchie was born Barbara Hauer in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. On May 6, 1806, she married John Casper Fritchie, a glove maker. Her father-in-law, John Caspar Fritchie, was one of seven British loyalists convicted of high treason against the United States in Frederick, Maryland, in June 1781, based on a plot to free British prisoners in Frederick and join with General Cornwallis in Virginia. All seven were convicted and sentenced to be hung, drawn, and quartered. Four of the defendants were pardoned, but Fritchie and two of his co-conspirators were executed two months later (whether to the full extent of the sentence or simply by hanging being unclear).

==Career==

She became famous as the heroine of the 1863 poem &quot;Barbara Frietchie&quot; by John Greenleaf Whittier in which she pleads with an occupying Confederate general, &quot;Shoot if you must this old gray head, but spare your country&#x27;s flag.&quot;

Three months after this alleged incident, Frietchie died. She was buried alongside her husband, who died in 1849, in the German Reformed Cemetery in Frederick, Maryland. Later, in 1914, her remains were moved to Mount Olivet Cemetery and a memorial was erected there in her honor.

===Poem===

Whittier&#x27;s poem was published in the October 1863 edition of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. The poem brought him strong national attention at a time when the magazine&#x27;s elite northern audience was seeking emotional resonance in response to the Civil War. No firsthand account of the actual incident survives, and disputes over the poem&#x27;s authenticity came up almost immediately after it was published. However, her descendants successfully promoted her reputation, and the city of Frederick, Maryland, has used her name and image to attract tourists ever since the early 1900s.

The flag incident as described in the poem likely never occurred at the Barbara Fritchie house, although Fritchie was a Unionist and did have a Union flag. Friends of hers stated that she shook a Union flag at and insulted Confederate troops, but other neighbors said Fritchie, over 90 years old, was ill at the time. In fact she did wave a union flag—but at Ambrose Burnsides&#x27;s Union troops on September 12, 1862. 

The actual woman who inspired the poem may have been Mary Quantrell, who lived on Patrick Street, and who, in a letter to the editor published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in February 1869, wrote that her flag, waving from a second-story window, had been ripped down and trampled by Confederate soldiers passing through in 1862, then picked up and held close by her daughter. Further, when Confederate troops moving west from Frederick and passing through Middletown demanded the removal of a Union flag flying from a window in the George Crouse family home, young Nancy Crouse took it down, draped it over her body, and returned to the front door to taunt them, and was not challenged, an act earning her the sobriquet of &quot;the Middletown Maid&quot;. 

In addition to confusing Fritchie with Quantrell, the poem was likely embellished, as Whittier was a distant poet working from second- or third-hand accounts of the incident and other similar ones. The Confederate general in the poem most likely was not Stonewall Jackson, but another Confederate officer (probably A. P. Hill), since none of the men with General Jackson that day remembered the incident—although while passing through Middletown, Maryland, two young girls did wave Union flags in the presence of General Jackson, who bowed, removed his hat and laughed the incident off. Gen. Jackson and Barbara Fritchie both died before publication of the poem. Historians and reporters noted other discrepancies between the patriotic poem and witness accounts.

==Legacy==
===Barbara Fritchie House===

The Barbara Fritchie House is located at 154 West Patrick Street in Frederick, Maryland. It is a 1927 reconstruction, based on the original house, which was washed away during a storm. The site had since become a shrine to the legend. In 1943, Winston Churchill, who knew the poem from memory, insisted he pass by the house during a trip through Frederick with President Franklin D. Roosevelt. When the house was open to the public, some volunteers there claimed that Fritchie haunted it and reported seeing her rocking chair move on its own.

The house began to fall into disrepair in the early 21st century. In 2015, it was purchased by the Ausherman Family Foundation. In January 2018, it was purchased by Bryan and Charlotte Chaney with the intent of repairing and reopening it for overnight stays through Airbnb.

===Cultural references===

Clyde Fitch adapted the story for the play &quot;Barbara Frietchie&quot; (1899), which ran for 89 performances and was criticized for its further departure from historical fact. It was revived several times and inspired the Dorothy Donnelly and Sigmund Romberg operetta &quot;My Maryland&quot; (1926), which ran for 312 performances. The play was adapted for film in 1915 and 1924. 

One of the Mid-Atlantic states&#x27; top-ten horse races was named in her honor; it is one of only seven Grade I or Grade II races run in the state of Maryland. The Barbara Fritchie Handicap is an American race for thoroughbred horses, run at Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland, each year. A Grade II race, it is open to fillies and mares age three and up, running seven furlongs on the dirt. It offers a purse of $300,000 and has been run since 1952.

In 1935, Edsel Ford expanded The Dearborn Inn through the addition of a &quot;Colonial Village&quot; behind the main building. The village consists of buildings whose exteriors are &quot;exact replicas of houses famous in American history&quot;. Among the homes recreated are the Edgar Allan Poe House; the Walt Whitman Birthplace and the Barbara Fritchie House. The interiors are divided into suites and afford guests the same comforts as those in the main structure.

The Barbara Fritchie Classic motorcycle races run annually on July 4; top riders from all over compete on the dirt oval at the Frederick County Fairgrounds. The race has been running for almost 100 years.

Musician Michael Clem of the Virginian folk group Eddie from Ohio penned the tune &quot;Miss Fritchie&quot; and recorded it on the group&#x27;s third album, &quot;I Rode Fido Home&quot;.

&quot;Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America Volume Two: The Middle Years&quot;, a radio play, parodied the story, with a man attempting to cajole Mrs. Fritchie into staging the supposed incident, but finds her appalled to hear it involves offering to be shot. Tyne Daly portrayed Fritchie.

Circa 1962, an episode of the &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; segment &quot;Bullwinkle&#x27;s Corner&quot; acted out a humorous version of Whittier&#x27;s poem, starring Bullwinkle J. Moose (Bill Scott) as Fritchie and Boris Badenov (Paul Frees) as Jackson - who shoots her red long underwear off the line. As Bullwinkle/Frietchie reaches out the window and grabs it, &quot;&#x27;Shoot, if you must, this old gray head; but spare my union suit,&#x27; she said.&quot; When Boris/Jackson prepares to shoot, she points a cannon at him from her window, tells him to march on, and says, &quot;I may be patriotic, but I&#x27;m not crazy.&quot;

James Thurber included this poem with his pictures in his &quot;Fables for Our Time and Famous Poems Illustrated&quot;.

Ogden Nash&#x27;s poem &quot;Taboo to Boot&quot;, about the joys of scratching an itch, contains the following stanza:
:I&#x27;m greatly attached
:To Barbara Frietchie.
:I&#x27;ll bet she scratched
:When she was itchy.

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel or Froebel (; 21 April 1782 – 21 June 1852) was a German pedagogue, a student of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, who laid the foundation for modern education based on the recognition that children have unique needs and capabilities. He created the concept of the &quot;kindergarten&quot; and coined the word, which soon entered the English language as well. He also developed the educational toys known as Froebel gifts.

==Biography==

Friedrich Fröbel was born at Oberweißbach in the Principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt in Thuringia. A cousin of his was the mother of Henriette Schrader-Breymann, and Henriette became a student of his. Fröbel&#x27;s father, Johann Jacob Fröbel, who died in 1802, was the pastor of the orthodox Lutheran (alt-lutherisch) parish there. Fröbel&#x27;s mother&#x27;s name was Jacobine Eleonore Friederike (born Hoffmann). The church and Lutheran Christian faith were pillars in Fröbel&#x27;s own early education. 
Oberweißbach was a wealthy village in the Thuringian Forest and had been known centuries long for its natural herb remedies, tinctures, bitters, soaps and salves. Families had their own inherited areas of the forest where herbs and roots were grown and harvested. Each family prepared, bottled, and produced their individual products which were taken throughout Europe on trade routes passed from father to son, who were affectionately called &quot;Buckelapotheker&quot; or &quot;Rucksack Pharmacists&quot;. They adorned the church with art acquired from their travels, many pieces of which can still be seen in the renovated structure. The pulpit from which Fröbel heard his father preach is the largest in all Europe and can accommodate a pastor and 12 people, a direct reference to Christ&#x27;s apostles.

Shortly after Fröbel&#x27;s birth, his mother&#x27;s health began to fail. She died when he was nine months old, profoundly influencing his life. In 1792, Fröbel went to live in the small town of Stadt-Ilm with his uncle, a gentle and affectionate man. At the age of 15 Fröbel, who loved nature, became the apprentice to a forester. In 1799, he decided to leave his apprenticeship and study mathematics and botany in Jena. From 1802 to 1805, he worked as a land surveyor.

On 11 September 1818, Fröbel wed Wilhelmine Henriette Hoffmeister (b. 1780) in Berlin. The union was childless. Wilhelmine died in 1839, and Fröbel married again in 1851. His second wife was Louise Levin.

===Career===

Throughout his career, Fröbel would move between his interests in nature and in education.
He began as an educator in 1805 at the &quot;Musterschule&quot; (a secondary school) in Frankfurt, where he learned about Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi&#x27;s ideas. He later worked with Pestalozzi in Switzerland, where his ideas further developed. From 1806, Fröbel was the live-in teacher for a Frankfurt noble family&#x27;s three sons. He lived with the three children from 1808 to 1810 at Pestalozzi&#x27;s institute in Yverdon-les-Bains in Switzerland.

In 1811, Fröbel once again went back to school in Göttingen and Berlin, eventually leaving without earning a certificate. He became a teacher at the &quot;Plamannsche Schule&quot; in Berlin, a boarding school for boys, and at that time also a pedagogical and patriotic centre.

During his service in the Lützow Free Corps in 1813 and 1814 – when he was involved in two military campaigns against Napoleon – Fröbel befriended Wilhelm Middendorf, a theologian and fellow pedagogue, and Heinrich Langethal, also a pedagogue.

After Waterloo and the Congress of Vienna Fröbel found himself a civilian once again, and became an assistant at the Museum of Mineralogy under Christian Samuel Weiss during 1814–1816, studying and cataloging mineral crystals. He became fascinated with their structure, and later would write: &quot;I continually proved to be true what had long been a presentiment with me, namely, that even in these so-called lifeless stones and fragments of rock, torn from their original bed, there lay germs of transforming, developing energy and activity. Amidst the diversity of forms around me, I recognised under all kinds of various modifications one law of development...And thereafter, my rocks and crystals served me as a mirror wherein I might descry mankind, and man’s development and history...Geology and crystallography not only opened up for me a higher circle of knowledge and insight, but also showed me a higher goal for my inquiry, my speculation, and my endeavour. Nature and man now seemed to me mutually to explain each other, through all their numberless various stages of development.&quot;

In 1816, he was offered a professorship in Stockholm, but he turned it down and instead founded the &quot;Allgemeine Deutsche Erziehungsanstalt&quot; (German General Education Institute) in Griesheim near Arnstadt in Thuringia. A year later, he moved the school to Keilhau near Rudolstadt. In 1831, work would be continued there by the other cofounders Wilhelm Middendorf and Heinrich Langethal.

In 1820, Fröbel published the first of his five Keilhau pamphlets, &quot;An unser deutsches Volk&quot; (&quot;To Our German People&quot;). The other four were published between then and 1823.

In 1826, he published his main written work, &quot;Die Menschenerziehung&quot; (&quot;The Education of Man&quot;) and founded the weekly publication &quot;Die erziehenden Familien&quot; (&quot;The Educating Families&quot;). In 1828 and 1829, he pursued plans for a people&#x27;s education institute (&quot;Volkserziehungsanstalt&quot;) in Helba (nowadays a constituent community of Meiningen), but they were never realized.

From 1831 to 1836, Fröbel once again lived in Switzerland. In 1831, he founded an educational institute in Wartensee. In 1833, he moved this to Willisau, and from 1835 to 1836, he headed the orphanage in Burgdorf, where he also published the magazine &quot;Grundzüge der Menschenerziehung&quot; (Features of Human Education). In 1836 appeared his work &quot;Erneuerung des Lebens erfordert das neue Jahr 1836&quot; (The New Year 1836 Calls For the Renewal of Life).

He returned to Germany, dedicated himself almost exclusively to preschool child education and began manufacturing playing materials in Bad Blankenburg. In 1837, he founded a &quot;care, playing and activity institute for small children&quot; in Bad Blankenburg. From 1838 to 1840, he also published the magazine &quot;Ein Sonntagsblatt für Gleichgesinnte&quot; (A Sunday Paper for the Like-Minded).

In 1840, he coined the word kindergarten for the Play and Activity Institute he had founded in 1837 at Bad Blankenburg for young children, together with Wilhelm Middendorf and Heinrich Langethal. These two men were Fröbel&#x27;s most faithful colleagues when his ideas were also transplanted to Keilhau near Rudolstadt. In 1840, the educator Emily Ronalds was the first British person to study Fröbel&#x27;s approach and he urged her to transplant his kindergarten concepts in England. 

He designed the educational play materials known as Froebel Gifts, or &quot;Fröbelgaben&quot;, which included geometric building blocks and pattern activity blocks. A book entitled &quot;Inventing Kindergarten&quot;, by Norman Brosterman, examines the influence of Friedrich Fröbel on Frank Lloyd Wright and modern art.

Friedrich Fröbel&#x27;s great insight was to recognise the importance of the activity of the child in learning. He introduced the concept of &quot;free work&quot; (&quot;Freiarbeit&quot;) into pedagogy and established the &quot;game&quot; as the typical form that life took in childhood, and also the game&#x27;s educational worth. Activities in the first kindergarten included singing, dancing, gardening, and self-directed play with the Froebel Gifts. Fröbel intended, with his &quot;Mutter- und Koselieder&quot; – a songbook that he published – to introduce the young child into the adult world.

These ideas about childhood development and education were introduced to academic and royal circles through the tireless efforts of his greatest proponent, the Baroness (Freiherrin) Bertha Marie von Marenholtz-Bülow. Through her Fröbel made the acquaintance of the Royal House of the Netherlands, various Thuringian dukes and duchesses, including the Romanov wife of the Grand Duke von Sachsen-Weimar. Baroness von Marenholtz-Bülow, Duke von Meiningen and Fröbel gathered donations to support art education for children in honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Goethe. The Duke of Meiningen granted the use of his hunting lodge, called Marienthal (Vale of Mary) in the resort town of Bad Liebenstein for Fröbel to train the first women as Kindergarten teachers &quot;(Kindergärtnerinnen)&quot;.

After suppressing the German revolutions of 1848–49, the Prussian government continued a crackdown on new ideas, banning kindergartens in 1851. This dismayed Fröbel, who died on 21 June 1852 in Marienthal, now a constituent community of Schweina. His grave can still be found in the cemetery at Schweina, where his widow, who died in Hamburg, was also buried on 10 January 1900.

==Legacy==
Fröbel’s idea of the kindergarten had found appeal, but its spread in Germany was thwarted by the Prussian government, whose education ministry banned it in a &quot;Kindergartenverbot&quot; edict on 7 August 1851 as &quot;atheistic and demagogic&quot; for its alleged &quot;destructive tendencies in the areas of religion and politics&quot;. Other German states followed suit.

The reason for the ban, however, may have been a confusion of names. Fröbel&#x27;s nephew Karl Fröbel had written and published &quot;Weibliche Hochschulen und Kindergärten&quot; (&quot;Female Colleges and Kindergartens&quot;), which apparently met with some disapproval. To quote Karl August Varnhagen von Ense, &quot;The stupid minister (Karl Otto) von Raumer has decreed a ban on kindergartens, basing himself on a book by Karl Fröbel. He is confusing Friedrich and Karl Fröbel.&quot;

The sudden ban caused a diaspora of teachers from Germany, spreading their ideas to other countries. Fröbel&#x27;s student, Margarethe Schurz, founded the first kindergarten in the United States at Watertown, Wisconsin in 1856 (though another student, Louisa Frankenberg, founded a school based in Fröbel&#x27;s methods in Columbus, Ohio in 1836, prior to Fröbel&#x27;s coining of the term &quot;Kindergarten&quot;.) In both schools, instruction was in the German language, and primarily served immigrant communities. She inspired Elizabeth Peabody, who went on to found the first English-language kindergarten in the United States, in Boston in 1860. The German émigré, Adolph Douai, had also founded a kindergarten in Boston in 1859, but had to close it after only a year. By 1866, however, he was founding others in New York City.

From the mid to late 19th century, many missionary women from Western countries disseminated Froebel’s theory of kindergarten education across Japan. The prominent American missionary and Froebelian Annie L. Howe (1852–1943) was particularly influential through the establishment of her Glory Kindergarten teacher training school. Howe developed curricula specifically for Japanese students and trained hundreds of Japanese women to use Froebelian methods in kindergarten education. 

The pedagogue, August Köhler, was the initiator and cofounder in 1863 of the &quot;Deutscher Fröbelverein&quot; (German Fröbel Association), first for Thuringia, out of which grew the &quot;Allgemeiner Fröbelverein&quot; (General Fröbel Association) in 1872, and a year later the &quot;Deutscher Fröbelverband&quot; (German Fröbel Federation). Köhler critically analyzed and evaluated Fröbel theory, adopted fundamental notions into his own kindergarten pedagogy and expanded on these, developing an independent &quot;Köhler Kindergarten Pedagogy&quot;. He first trained kindergarten teachers in Gotha in 1857. In the beginning, Köhler had thought to engage male educators exclusively, but far too few applied.

Thekla Naveau founded, in October 1853, the first kindergarten in Sondershausen and on 1 April 1867, the first kindergarten after the Prussian ban was lifted in Nordhausen. Angelika Hartmann founded in 1864 the first kindergarten after Fröbel’s model in Köthen, Anhalt. In 1908 and 1911, kindergarten teacher training was recognized in Germany through state regulatory laws.

Since then, there are many kindergartens in Germany named after Fröbel that continue his method. Many have sprung from parental or other private initiatives. The biggest Fröbel association, &quot;Fröbel e.V.&quot;, today runs more than 100 kindergartens and other early childhood institutions throughout the country through the &quot;Fröbel-Gruppe&quot;.

Committed to Fröbel&#x27;s legacy is also the &quot;Neuer Thüringer Fröbelverein&quot; (NTFV; New Thuringian Fröbel Association), and in particular to protecting the legacy&#x27;s business receipts. As well, the Association runs a school museum and the Fröbel Archive in Keilhau. Furthermore, it engages itself in Fröbel institutions worldwide (United States, United Kingdom, Japan). Through this network, the NTFV further continues one of the most prominent lines of modern pedagogy from the authentic &quot;Fröbel town&quot; of Keilhau. The Fröbel Diploma, now conferred by the Fröbel Academy in Nordhausen, can also be traced back to the NTFV. All this ensures that Fröbel’s ideas will live on into the future.

In 1892, followers of Fröbel established a college of teacher education in South West London to continue his traditions. Froebel College is now a constituent college of Roehampton University and is home to the university&#x27;s department of education. The University of Roehampton Library is also home to the Froebel Archive for Childhood Studies, a collection of books, archives, photographs, objects and multi-media materials, centring on Friedrich Fröbel’s educational legacy, early years and elementary education. The Demonstration School, originally located at Colet Court, Kensington, has evolved into Ibstock Place School, Roehampton.

Today the Pestalozzi-Fröbel-Haus in Berlin continues to train nursery school teachers.

There is a National Kindergarten Day in the United States on his birthday, April 21.

==Cultural influence==
Fröbel&#x27;s building forms and movement games are forerunners of abstract art as well as a source of inspiration to the Bauhaus movement. In Fröbel’s honour, Walter Gropius designed the &quot;Friedrich Fröbel Haus&quot;. Many modernist architects were exposed as children to Fröbel&#x27;s ideas about geometry, including Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, and Buckminster Fuller.

<doc id="728930" wikidata="Q278403" url="?curid=728930" title="A. Q. M. Badruddoza Chowdhury">
<text>Abdul Qasim Mohammad Badruddoza Chowdhury (11 October 1930 – 5 October 2024) was a Bangladeshi politician who served as the president of Bangladesh from 14 November 2001 until his dismissal on 21 June 2002. He was the founding secretary-general of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).

Chowdhury was also a physician, cultural activist, author, essayist, playwright, television presenter, and an orator of distinction. He was awarded the National Television Award in 1976.

==Early life==
Badruddoza Chowdhury was born in his maternal grandfather&#x27;s house in Comilla on 11 October 1930. His grandfather&#x27;s home is in Majidpur Dayhata, Srinagar, Bikrampur (now Munshiganj District). His father, Kafiluddin Chowdhury, was the general secretary of the United Front serving as a minister in the United Front provincial cabinet of the then East Pakistan and an Awami League leader. His mother was Sufia Khatun. Badruddoza passed his SSC from St Gregory&#x27;s School in 1947 and HSC from Dhaka College in 1949. He earned his MBBS degree from Dhaka Medical College in 1954–1955.

==Medical career==
Chowdhury started his career in the medical profession. He served as an associate professor of medicine in Rajshahi Medical College in 1964 and Sir Salimullah Medical College during 1964–1970 and professor of medicine in Sylhet Medical College in 1970. He served as the president of National Anti-Tuberculosis Association of Bangladesh (NATAB), president of International Union Against Tuberculosis of Lung Diseases (IUATLD) of Asia Pacific Zone.

==Political career==
Being inspired by Ziaur Rahman, the founder chairman of the party, Badruddoza entered into politics as the secretary general of the BNP during its early years. He won the parliament election of 1979 as a BNP nominee from Munshiganj and served as cabinet minister during the years 1979–1982. When the BNP again won parliamentary elections in 1991, after a short stint as Education and Cultural Affairs Minister (from 20 March 1991 until 19 September 1991), he was appointed Deputy Leader of the House of Bangladesh parliament.

==Presidency==
Chowdhury was appointed the foreign minister of Bangladesh when the BNP party came to power in 2001. In November 2001, he was elected the president of Bangladesh by Jatiya Sangsad members. Seven months later the incident of him deciding not to visit BNP founder Ziaur Rahman&#x27;s grave on his death anniversary provoked the party members. They accused him of betraying the party. In June 2002, Chowdhury resigned from office as was asked by the ruling party before the situation could turn any murkier.

==&quot;Bikalpa Dhara&quot;==
Chowdhury felt the need of a third force in the &quot;de facto&quot; two-party democracy in Bangladesh. He expressed recruiting civil society members in politics to fight corruption and terrorism and establish good governance in the country through an &quot;alternate stream&quot; (lit. &quot;Bikalpa Dhara&quot;) political party. He, along with his son Mahi B. Chowdhury and BNP parliamentarian M A Mannan resigned from the BNP to work for the new political party. Chowdhury was the president, with M A Mannan as the secretary-general of the new party, Bikalpa Dhara Bangladesh, formed in March 2004. It had been a strong critic of the government during the time, and most of its members defected from the ruling BNP.

For a brief period Chowdhury joined with senior statesman Oli Ahmed. Along with various senior ministers from the BNP cabinet they formed the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Bangladesh. This did not last and Chowdhury decided to come out of LDP and concentrate his efforts on reviving Bikalpa Dhara.

Chowdhury has been the party&#x27;s president since its inception, except for a brief period between December 2008 and April 2009, during which time he had resigned from his post after the party could secure no seats during the 9th parliament elections.

==Personal life and death==
Chowdhury was married to Hasina Warda Chowdhury. Together they had a son, Mahi B. Chowdhury, and two daughters, Muna and Shaila.

Chowdhury died from a lung infection at the Medical College for Women and Hospital on 5 October 2024, at the age of 93.

<text>A scrutineer (also called a poll-watcher or a challenger in the United States) is a person who observes any process which requires rigorous oversight. Scrutineers are responsible for preventing corruption and detecting genuine mistakes and problems.
The scrutineering process most commonly occurs alongside voting in an election. The scrutineer observes the counting of ballot papers to ensure that election rules are followed. There are other uses of the concept; in motorsport, a scrutineer is responsible for ensuring that vehicles meet the technical regulations.

== Politics ==
Rules vary concerning the number of scrutineers from a political party who are allowed to be present at each polling station. In some jurisdictions, each candidate or party may have one scrutineer or poll-watcher per constituency or precinct where voting or counting takes place. In other jurisdictions, such as in Australia and Canada, each party is permitted to appoint one or two scrutineers per polling booth. Scrutineers are often required to refrain from contact with voters, from wearing or displaying political slogans, or from otherwise exerting influence on the conduct of the election while it is taking place. Scrutineers also report back unofficial results to their campaign headquarters, as the official results can take some time to be issued.

==Sport==

Scrutineers play an important role in many motorsports. Racing series typically have a set of technical regulations to which the cars, bikes, or other vehicles must conform. The role of the scrutineer in this case is to confirm that vehicles entered for the race meet the relevant regulations.

==Design and engineering==

Someone who carefully verifies the accuracy of technical specifications, drawings, or configurations as they apply to a specific discipline field.

==Competitive dance==

Dancing competitions (especially dancesport) employ (usually professionally certified) officials who oversee judging and tabulate scores. Software is often used to aid with tabulation.

<text>Charles Frohman (July 15, 1856 – May 7, 1915) was an American theater manager and producer, who discovered and promoted many stars of the American stage. Frohman produced over 700 shows, and among his biggest hits was &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, both in London and the US.

In 1896, Frohman co-founded the Theatrical Syndicate, a nationwide chain of theaters that dominated the American touring company business for more than two decades until the Shubert brothers grew strong enough to end its virtual monopoly. He partnered with English producers, including Seymour Hicks, with whom he produced a string of London hits prior to 1910, such as &quot;Quality Street&quot;, &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot;, &quot;The Catch of the Season&quot;, &quot;The Beauty of Bath&quot;, and &quot;A Waltz Dream&quot;.

At the height of his fame, Frohman died in the 1915 sinking of the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; by a German submarine off the coast of Ireland.

==Life and career==
Charles Frohman was born to a Jewish family in Sandusky, Ohio, the youngest of three Frohman brothers, including Daniel and Gustave. The year of his birth date is generally erroneously reported as 1860, and his birthday is shown as July 16 on his tombstone, but the correct date is July 15, 1856. In 1864, Frohman&#x27;s family moved to New York City. At the age of twelve, Frohman started to work at night in the office of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, attending school by day. In 1874, he began work for the &quot;Daily Graphic&quot; and at night sold tickets at Hooley&#x27;s Theatre, Brooklyn. In 1877, he took charge of the Chicago Comedy Co., with John Dillon as star in &quot;Our Boys&quot;. He next joined Haverly&#x27;s United Mastodon Minstrels as manager, touring the U.S. and Europe. Then for a time he was associated with his brothers Daniel and Gustave in managing the Madison Square Theatre, New York. He began to produce plays by 1886.

Frohman&#x27;s first success as a producer was with Bronson Howard&#x27;s play &quot;Shenandoah&quot; (1889). Frohman founded the Empire Theatre Stock Company to acquire his first Broadway theatre, the Empire, in 1892. The following year, he produced his first Broadway play, Clyde Fitch&#x27;s &quot;Masked Ball&quot;. In this piece, Maude Adams first played opposite John Drew, which led to many future successes. Soon Frohman acquired five other New York City theaters, including the Garrick and Criterion Theatres. Working with William Harris and Isaac B. Rich, he became part owner of their theatres in Boston (the Columbia Theatre, Park, Hollis Street, Colonial, Boston and Tremont). In 1895, he produced the New York premiere of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, by Oscar Wilde. The same year, he produced &quot;The Shop Girl&quot;.

Frohman was known for his ability to develop talent. His stars included William Gillette, John Drew, Jr., Ethel Barrymore, Billie Burke, E. H. Sothern, Julia Marlowe, Maude Adams, Paul Gilmore, Evelyn Millard, Henry Miller and Walter E. Perkins. In 1896, Frohman, Al Hayman, Abe Erlanger, Mark Klaw, Samuel F. Nixon, and Fred Zimmerman formed the Theatrical Syndicate. Their organization established systemized booking networks throughout the United States and created a monopoly that controlled every aspect of contracts and bookings until the late 1910s, when the Shubert brothers broke their stranglehold on the industry.

In 1897, Frohman leased the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in London, introducing plays there as well as in the United States. Clyde Fitch, J. M. Barrie and Edmond Rostand were among the playwrights he promoted. As a producer, among Frohman&#x27;s most famous successes was Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn&#x27;t Grow Up&quot;, which he premiered at the Duke of York&#x27;s in December 1904 starring Nina Boucicault, and produced in January 1905 in the U.S. starring Maude Adams. In the early years of the 20th century, Frohman also established a successful partnership with English actor-producer Seymour Hicks to produce musicals and other comedies in London, including &quot;Quality Street&quot; in 1902, &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot; in 1903, &quot;The Catch of the Season&quot; in 1904, &quot;The Beauty of Bath&quot; in 1906, &quot;The Gay Gordons&quot; in 1907, and &quot;A Waltz Dream&quot; in 1908, among others. He also partnered with other London theatre managers. The system of exchange of successful plays between London and New York was effected largely as a result of his efforts. In 1910, Frohman attempted a repertory scheme of producing plays at the Duke of York&#x27;s. He advertised a bill of plays by J. M. Barrie, John Galsworthy, Harley Granville Barker, and others. The venture began tentatively, and while it might have proved successful, Frohman canceled the scheme when London theatres closed at the death of King Edward VII in May 1910.

Other Frohman hits included &quot;The Dollar Princess&quot; (1909), &quot;The Arcadians&quot; (1910), &quot;The Sunshine Girl&quot; (1913) and &quot;The Girl From Utah&quot; (1914). By 1915, Frohman had produced more than 700 shows, employed an average of 10,000 people per season, 700 of them actors, and paid salaries totaling $35 million a year (the equivalent of more than $700 million in 2010 dollars). Frohman controlled five theaters in London, six in New York City, and over two hundred throughout the rest of the United States. His longtime live-in companion, theatre critic Charles Dillingham, also became a well-known producer.

==Death on the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;==

Frohman made his annual trip to Europe in May 1915 to oversee his London and Paris &quot;play markets&quot;, sailing on the Cunard Line&#x27;s RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;. Songwriter Jerome Kern was meant to accompany him on the voyage but overslept after being kept up late playing requests at a party. William Gillette was also to have accompanied him, but was forced to fulfill a contracted appearance in Philadelphia.

Frohman&#x27;s rheumatic knee, from a fall three years earlier, had been ailing for most of the voyage, but he was feeling better on the morning of May 7, a bright, sunny day. He entertained guests in his suite and later at his table. He was regaling them with tales of his life in the theater when, at 2:10 in the afternoon, within fourteen miles of the Old Head of Kinsale, with the coast of Ireland in sight, a torpedo from the German U-boat &quot;U-20&quot; struck the &quot;Lusitania&quot; on the starboard side. Within a minute, there was a second explosion, followed by several smaller ones.

As passengers began to panic, Frohman stood on the promenade deck, chatting with friends and smoking a cigar. He calmly remarked, &quot;This is going to be a close call.&quot; Frohman, with a disabled leg and walking with a cane, could not have jumped from the deck into a lifeboat, so he was trapped. Instead, he and millionaire Alfred Vanderbilt tied lifejackets to &quot;Moses baskets&quot; containing infants who had been asleep in the nursery when the torpedo struck. Frohman then went out onto the deck, where he was joined by actress Rita Jolivet, her brother-in-law George Vernon and Captain Alick Scott. In the final moments, they clasped hands, and Frohman paraphrased his greatest hit, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;: &quot;Why fear death? It is the most beautiful adventure that life gives us.&quot; Jolivet, the only survivor of Frohman&#x27;s party, was standing with Frohman as the ship sank. She later said, &quot;with a tremendous roar a great wave swept along the deck. We were all divided in a moment, and I have not seen any of those brave men alive since.&quot;

At his death, Frohman was 58. His body later washed ashore below the Old Head of Kinsale, and lay among 147 others awaiting identification, where a rescued American identified him from newspaper photographs. His body, alone among all the others, was not disfigured. It was determined that he was killed by a heavy object falling on him, rather than by drowning. His funeral service was held on May 25 at Temple Emanu-El in New York City, and he was buried in the Union Field Cemetery in Ridgewood, Queens, New York. Services were also arranged by some of his stars in other American cities: by Maude Adams in Los Angeles, by John Drew in San Francisco, by Billie Burke in Tacoma, and by Donald Brian, Joseph Cawthorn and Julia Sanderson in Providence, as well as memorial services at both St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and the Church of St Martin-in-the-Fields in London. Frohman was also eulogized by the French Academy of Authors in Paris.

A memorial to Frohman is located on The Causeway at Marlow on Thames. The memorial, by the artist Leonard Stanford Merrifield, features a drinking fountain with a sculptured nymph and inscription.

==Portrayals in films, television and stage==
Frohman was portrayed by Edwin Maxwell in &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; (1936) and by Harry Hayden in the film &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot; (1946). He was played by William Hootkins in the BBC mini-series &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; in 1978. He was portrayed by Nehemiah Persoff in &quot;&quot; also in 1978 on television. In the 1980 film &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;, the character William Fawcett Robinson, played by Christopher Plummer, was based on Frohman. In 2004, Dustin Hoffman portrayed him in the film &quot;Finding Neverland&quot;, while Kelsey Grammer played him in the musical of the same name on Broadway in 2015.

<text>The 68th Street–Hunter College station is a local station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway, located at the intersection of Lexington Avenue and 68th Street on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. It is served by the train at all times, the &lt;6&gt; train during weekdays in the peak direction, and the train during late nights.

This station was constructed as part of the Dual Contracts by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and opened in 1918, and was renovated in the 1980s. A further renovation between 2021 and 2024 made the station compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and provided additional entry points.

== History ==
===Planning and construction===

Following the completion of the original subway, there were plans to construct a line along Manhattan&#x27;s east side north of 42nd Street. The original plan for what became the extension north of 42nd Street was to continue it south through Irving Place and into what is now the BMT Broadway Line at Ninth Street and Broadway. In July 1911, the IRT had withdrawn from the talks, and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) was to operate on Lexington Avenue. The IRT submitted an offer for what became its portion of the Dual Contracts on February 27, 1912.

In 1913, as part of the Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, the Public Service Commission planned to split the original Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) system from looking like a &quot;Z&quot; system (as seen on a map) to an H-shaped system. The original system would be split into three segments: two north–south lines, carrying through trains over the Lexington Avenue and Broadway–Seventh Avenue Lines, and a west–east shuttle under 42nd Street. This would form a roughly H-shaped system. It was predicted that the subway extension would lead to the growth of the Upper East Side and the Bronx.

On February 15, 1917, the Public Service Commission agreed to change the name of the under-construction station from 68th Street to 68th Street–Hunter College at the request of officials of Hunter College, however the automated announcements refer to it as just 68th Street.

===Opening===
The 68th Street–Hunter College station opened on July 17, 1918, with service initially running between Grand Central–42nd Street and 167th Street via the line&#x27;s local tracks. On August 1, the &quot;H system&quot; was put into place, with through service beginning on the new east and west side trunk lines, and the institution of the 42nd Street Shuttle along the old connection between the sides. The cost of the extension from Grand Central was $58 million.

===Station renovations===

The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940.

In 1981, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system. This station was renovated in September 1984 as part of the MTA&#x27;s Adopt-A-Station Program in conjunction with a renovation of Hunter College.

==== Elevator installation ====
As early as 2008, the MTA had wanted to install elevators at the 68th Street station. The MTA proposed to build elevators here under the 2010–2014 MTA Capital Program, as part of the MTA&#x27;s 100 Key ADA-accessible stations program. The project scope included include building elevators at 68th Street and new street stair entrances at 69th Street and Lexington Avenue. In late 2011 and early 2012, the project faced local opposition; opponents claimed the new staircases would ruin the character of 69th Street. The MTA insisted the new entrances were necessary to reduce congestion at the station&#x27;s current entrances. The 69th Street Tenants Corporation suggested building new entrances at 67th Street or 70th Street instead, although the station does not reach under either of those streets. These proposals would have required construction of new passageways connecting the platforms to 67th Street to 70th Street, which would be more expensive and take longer to construct.

The MTA originally hoped to award a construction contract by November 2013, but the project stalled for several years. In 2016, the MTA released an environmental assessment for the project, proposing to build a new southbound-only entrance at the southwest corner of 69th Street and Lexington Avenue, and a new northbound-only entrance on the east side of Lexington Avenue midblock between 68th and 69th Streets, at the suggestion of the 69th Street Tenants Corporation. , project design was still delayed, due to unresolved conflicts regarding real estate and infrastructure relocation work. The MTA hoped to award a contract by August 2018, with construction starting in December 2018, and completed in April 2021. By early 2019, the cost of the project had increased to $116 million. , a contract for the elevators&#x27; construction was projected to be awarded in July 2020 and be completed by 2023. The street-to-mezzanine elevator was originally supposed to be installed at the southeast corner of Lexington Avenue and 69th Street. The elevator was relocated to the northeast corner after engineers determined that the elevator would have been too complicated to install at the original location.

In December 2021, a contract for the renovations was awarded to Forte/Citnalta JV. The latest design moved the street elevator next to a relocated stair at the northeast corner of 68th Street and Lexington Avenue; an engineering analysis confirmed the original location of the proposed elevator, at the southeast corner of the intersection under the overhang of Hunter College East, was structurally infeasible. A relocated street stair on the west side of Lexington Avenue opened in October 2022, and the midblock entrance to the northbound platform opened in March 2023. The elevators were finally opened in December 2024, having cost $177 million.

== Station layout ==
This underground station has two local tracks and two side platforms. The express tracks of the Lexington Avenue Line, used by the 4 and trains during daytime hours, pass beneath the station and are not visible from the platforms. The 6 stops here at all times, and the 4 stops here during late nights. The station is between to the north and to the south. Automated announcements on the R142 fleet refer to the station as 68th Street.

Both platforms have their original brown and yellow mosaic trim line with &quot;68&quot; friezes on it at regular intervals. Where some tiles have degraded and fallen off, the wall is painted in matching colors. Below the trim line are mosaic name tablets reading &quot;68TH STREET-HUNTER COLLEGE&quot; broken onto two lines in white seriffed lettering on blue with a gold and green border. On small sections of the platforms on either ends, where they were extended in the 1950s, there are blue trim lines with &quot;68TH ST&quot; white lettering printed on them. Midnight blue I-beam columns run along both platforms at regular intervals with alternating ones having the standard black station name plate in white lettering. Both platforms have emergency exits from the lower level express tracks.

Toward the south end of the platforms are two stairs leading to the only mezzanine in the station. It has been renovated with stainless steel fare control rails and features red accent stripes in the IND style. Old wall lights exist but are not functional. The waiting area inside fare control has windows that allow a full view of the platforms and tracks. The northern half of the station without the mezzanine has very high ceilings.

Two glass mosaic artworks, &quot;Tempestuous Terrain&quot; and &quot;Liminal Location&quot; by Hunter College professor Lisa Corinne Davis, are installed at the station as part of the MTA Arts &amp; Design program. The &quot;Liminal Location&quot; mural is split into two sections. Both artworks consist of painted and engraved pieces of glass, which depict lines winding through a multicolored field. These decorations were intended to resemble a map.

===Exits===

Outside of the large turnstile bank that provides access to and from the station through the mezzanine, there is a token booth and a passageway on each side separated from the waiting area by a steel fence. Each passageway leads to a small staircase going up to either northern corner of 68th Street and Lexington Avenue, as well as an elevator to the northeast corner. On the east side of the mezzanine is a short staircase going up to a landing, where a larger staircase goes up to the southeast corner of 68th Street and Lexington Avenue underneath Hunter College&#x27;s East Building. The west side of the mezzanine has a direct entrance to the West Building of Hunter College and a double-wide marble staircase going up to the plaza on the southwest corner of 68th Street and Lexington Avenue.

An additional entrance for the northbound platform is located on the east side of Lexington Avenue between 68th and 69th Streets. It is flush with the retail facade of the Imperial House apartment building and leads down to an intermediate landing with a small turnstile bank. An additional entrance for the southbound platform is located on the southwestern corner of Lexington Avenue and 69th Street.

The entrance at the southeast corner contains a sign with the word &quot;Subway&quot; in a unique typeface seen only on the Hunter campus. This sign, and other signs around the college campus that are set in the same typeface, was created by Barbara Stauffacher Solomon as part of Ulrich Franzen&#x27;s 1984 expansion of the campus.

The original system would be split into three segments: two north–south lines, carrying through trains over the Lexington Avenue and Broadway–Seventh Avenue Lines, and a west–east shuttle under 42nd Street. This would form a roughly H-shaped system. It was predicted that the subway extension would lead to the growth of the Upper East Side and the Bronx.

On September 19, 1917, the New York State Public Service Commission denied a request to change the planned name of the station to &quot;77th Street—St. Ann&#x27;s Academy&quot;.

The 77th Street station opened on July 17, 1918, with service initially running between Grand Central–42nd Street and 167th Street via the line&#x27;s local tracks. On August 1, the &quot;H system&quot; was put into place, with through service beginning on the new east and west side trunk lines, and the institution of the 42nd Street Shuttle along the old connection between the sides. The cost of the extension from Grand Central was $58 million.

In July 1924, the IRT installed a change-making machine in the station. Along with turnstiles that accepted nickels, which were installed the previous year, this was expect to eliminate the need to have money changers in station booths.

In 1932, the New York State Transit Commission approved an application from Lenox Hill Hospital to install signs reading &quot;Lenox Hill Hospital&quot; on the walls of the station, on the condition that the hospital would pay for the cost of the sign installation.

=== Station renovations ===
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940.

The station was renovated in the 1950s to extend the station platforms to accommodate ten-car trains.

The NYCTA issued an invitation for bids on a project to construct additional entrances at the station on April 26, 1968. As part of the project, second staircases were added to each corner of 77th Street and Lexington Avenue. The contract was awarded to J. W. Jenkins, Incorporated for $409,726.

This station was renovated in 2003, along with the 86th Street and 116th Street stations on the Lexington Avenue Line. As part of the project, structural deficiencies were repaired, signage and lighting were enhanced, electrical service was upgraded, station facilities were rehabilitated, new fare arrays and a new token booth were installed, and portions of the station were upgraded to be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. In addition, visual clutter was eliminated, and artwork was installed. The contract for the station renovation project, which was expected to take two year, was expected to be advertised in October 2000. The contract for these three stations was awarded in October 2001, and the projects were done in-house. The cost of the work at 77th Street station was $16.3 million, of which $12.3 million came from the Federal government.

=== Proposed accessibility improvements ===
In January 2023, Northwell Health, as part of its plan to expand Lenox Hill Hospital, submitted an application for a transit improvement density bonus. The agency proposed to make the downtown side of the station fully ADA-accessible by replacing two street stairs with one 15-foot (3 m) wide stair, enlarging public sidewalk space, improving station security and lighting systems, and installing two elevators: one from the street to the mezzanine, and another from the mezzanine to the platform. These improvements would allow the medical development to obtain a floor area ratio (FAR) bonus of 0.5; however, they still require Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) review before being approved.

== Station layout ==

This station has two local tracks and two side platforms. The express tracks of the Lexington Avenue Line, used by the 4 and trains during daytime hours, pass beneath the station and are not visible from the platforms. The 6 stops here at all times, and the 4 stops here during late nights. The station is between to the north and to the south.

There are round columns painted green along the length of both platforms. There are mosaic trim lines, and mosaic displaying the name of the station on the original sections of the station platforms. The remainders of both platforms have cream-colored tiles and a salmon trim line with &quot;77TH ST&quot; written on it in black Sans Serif font at regular intervals. These tiles were installed during the late 1950s renovation.

Some old wall lights exist after the station&#x27;s renovation in 2003, but most are gone or falling off the walls. Both platforms have emergency exits from the lower level express tracks.

The 2004 artwork here is called &quot;4 Seasons Seasoned&quot; by Robert Kushner. It is installed on the ceiling above the fare control staircases and features mosaics related to the four seasons of the year.

===Exits===
Both platforms has a fare control, and both areas have a turnstile bank, and four staircases to the street. The northbound side has a pair of staircases to both eastern corners of Lexington Avenue and 77th Street, while the southbound side has a pair of staircases to both western corners of Lexington Avenue and 77th Street. There are no crossovers or crossunders to allow free transfers between directions.

The downtown platform is the only platform in the station to house a token booth. The uptown platform token booth was closed by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority after making a series of layoffs and has been removed.

<doc id="728946" wikidata="Q1928695" url="?curid=728946" title="When a Man Loves a Woman (film)">
<text>When a Man Loves a Woman is a 1994 American romantic drama film directed by Luis Mandoki and written by Al Franken and Ronald Bass. The film stars Andy García, Meg Ryan, Tina Majorino, Mae Whitman (in her film debut), Ellen Burstyn, Lauren Tom, and Philip Seymour Hoffman.

&quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot; was released in the United States on April 29, 1994. For her performance as an alcoholic mother, Ryan was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Female Actor in a Leading Role. The film&#x27;s title is taken from the song of the same name by Percy Sledge.

==Plot==
Alice Green is a school counselor struggling with alcoholism and is married to Michael, an airline pilot. Though she is lighthearted and loving, Alice is often reckless and, when drunk, even neglects her children: nine-year-old Jess from a previous marriage, and four-year-old Casey, whose father is Michael.

One afternoon, Alice enters their home in a drunken, incoherent state. She dismisses the reluctant babysitter Amy, who leaves her alone with her children. Still drinking, Alice is confronted by Jess, who is concerned for her welfare. In return, she slaps Jess, who runs to her room in tears. While in the shower, Alice retches, calls for Jess, and cannot control her balance, which causes her to fall through the shower door onto the bathroom floor and lose consciousness. Fearing Alice has died, Jess contacts Michael who immediately flies home to be by Alice&#x27;s side.

In the hospital, Michael and Alice confront the truth about Alice&#x27;s drinking. They both decide that she must seek professional help for her alcoholism. Upon release from the hospital, a timid Alice enters a rehabilitation clinic.

Michael finds himself now the main caregiver of their home and children, a role he struggles to maintain along with his career as an airline pilot, as well as fighting with Amy and driving her out of the house. Meanwhile, at the clinic, Alice is flourishing; her recovery is painful, but stabilizing, and she is well-liked and respected by both staff and fellow clinic tenants alike. During a family visit day at the clinic, Alice immediately begins to rebuild her shattered bond with the children, leaving Michael alone to wander the grounds uncomfortable and out of place in Alice&#x27;s new lifestyle.

Alice returns home sober yet guarded – she is vocal, strong, and changed. Michael is having trouble adjusting to Alice&#x27;s post-treatment aloofness, distant and cold behavior towards him. He has become used to being the stable and responsible one in their relationship and appropriately feels neglected by Alice&#x27;s newly established and highly prioritized outside friendships. She resents the fact that Michael seems to be out of touch with her ability to cope at home, yet whenever he expresses his love and concern, she shuts him out. Coming to terms with their estrangement, a reluctant Michael agrees to Alice&#x27;s suggestion that the two see a marriage counselor, who considers Michael&#x27;s behavior as &quot;codependent.&quot;

During an argument, Alice confesses that Michael&#x27;s clearly genuine desire to be a supportive husband &quot;makes her skin crawl.&quot; Michael moves out, and Alice stays in their home with the children. Michael is unable to process the change his relationship has undergone and seeks out a support group for spouses of alcoholics. Initially shy, Michael becomes a more vocal member of the group and shares his sorrow over his lack of understanding for the gravity his wife&#x27;s sobriety would have on him, his children, and his marriage.

Alice and Michael singularly return to the hospital to celebrate the birth of Amy&#x27;s baby. They spend time together and as they depart, Alice asks Michael if he would attend her 180-day sober speech where she will acknowledge her failings and accomplishments. She also tells him that she has been thinking about asking him to come home with her. Michael tells Alice he has been offered a job in Denver. For the first time since they both agreed Alice should enter rehab, they both agree Michael should take the position.
Alice later stands on a stage and tells her sobriety story; the toll it took on her, her children, and her marriage. Her audience is moved to tears. Her speech ends and she is surrounded by well-wishers. Out of the crowd appears Michael. At ease with himself and Alice, he explains what he missed along the way...&quot;to listen, to really listen.&quot; They share an intense, longing, passionate kiss.

==Cast==
* Meg Ryan as Alice Green
* Andy García as Michael Green
* Lauren Tom as Amy (the babysitter)
* Philip Seymour Hoffman as Gary
* Tina Majorino as Jess Green
* Mae Whitman as Casey Green
* Ellen Burstyn as Emily

==Production==
Tom Hanks was considered for Garcia&#x27;s role and Michelle Pfeiffer and Debra Winger were considered for Ryan&#x27;s role.

== Reception ==
===Critical response===
&quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot; holds a 69% approval rating among critics at Rotten Tomatoes based on 96 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot; delves into the complex dynamics of a marriage shadowed by addiction, aided by strong performances from Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan.&quot;

Roger Ebert, himself a recovering alcoholic, gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, &quot;Here is a wise and ambitious film about the way alcoholism affects the fabric of a marriage. So many movies about the disease simplify it into a three-step process: Gradual onset, spectacular bottom, eventual recovery. It isn&#x27;t that simple; most alcoholics never even give themselves a chance to recover. And recovery is a beginning, not an end.&quot; He praised the acting of Meg Ryan, Andy Garcia, and Lauren Tom, and said one of the film&#x27;s strengths is &quot;it isn&#x27;t just about Alice&#x27;s recovery. It&#x27;s about Michael&#x27;s recovery from Alice&#x27;s recovery.&quot;

James Berardinelli said that the &quot;ending is too facile&quot;, and that its &quot;occasional didactic tendencies are its weakness&quot;, but concluded &quot;the script does a good enough job establishing the dynamics of the Green family that we never doubt that the story deserves to be told. The film&#x27;s poignancy is its strength...In balance, the former by far outweighs the latter, making this a worthwhile picture.&quot; Berardinelli also gave praise to the performances of Tina Majorino and Mae Whitman, and argued that seeing the characters of Alice and Michael through the children&#x27;s eyes helps elevate the story.

David Denby of &quot;New York Magazine&quot; called the film an &quot;earnest and highly prolonged counseling disappointment&quot; and a &quot;pushy therapeutic exercise&quot; which, although intelligent, features &quot;endless talk, a stunted &quot;mise en scène&quot;, and a moral atmosphere of dogged and literal-minded persistence&quot; which &quot;overvalues its own sobriety&quot;.

In a 2012 review for &quot;Bitch&quot; magazine, Christen McCurdy wrote, &quot;It’s a rare film that begins its story in the middle of a relationship, and whose happy ending does not depend on one character’s white-hot epiphany and subsequent breathless confession (though we get something like that in the final scene). Instead, both characters’ roles in the relationship have to evolve.&quot;

===Box office===
The film debuted at number two at the US box office behind &quot;The Crow&quot;. It grossed $50 million in the United States and Canada and $119 million worldwide.

== Year-end lists ==
* &quot;The second 10&quot; (not ranked) – Sean P. Means, &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot;
* Honorable mention – Duane Dudek, &quot;Milwaukee Sentinel&quot;
* Honorable mention – William Arnold, &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;

<doc id="728954" wikidata="Q2612205" url="?curid=728954" title="86th Street station (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)">
<text>The 86th Street station is an express station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Lexington Avenue and 86th Street on the Upper East Side, it is served by the and trains at all times, the train at all times except late nights, and the &lt;6&gt; train during weekdays in peak direction.

The 86th Street station was constructed for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) as part of the Dual Contracts. The station opened on July 17, 1918, as part of the IRT&#x27;s Lexington Avenue and Jerome Avenue lines from Grand Central–42nd Street to 167th Street. The station&#x27;s platforms were extended in the early 1960s. It was also renovated in the 1970s, in 1986, and from 2002 to 2004.

The 86th Street station contains four side platforms and four tracks, split across two levels. Local trains use the upper level, which has two tracks and two side platforms, while express trains use the lower level, which are arranged in the same layout. The station was built with tile and mosaic decorations. The upper platforms contain exits to Lexington Avenue and 86th Street, as well as stairs to and from the lower platforms. Unlike at most express stations, the respective pairs of northbound and southbound platforms are not connected to each other within fare control. The station interior is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== History ==
===Construction and opening===
Following the completion of the original subway, there were plans to construct a line along Manhattan&#x27;s east side north of 42nd Street. The original plan for what became the extension north of 42nd Street was to continue it south through Irving Place and into what is now the BMT Broadway Line at Ninth Street and Broadway. In July 1911, the IRT had withdrawn from the talks, and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) was to operate on Lexington Avenue. The IRT submitted an offer for what became its portion of the Dual Contracts on February 27, 1912. As workers were blasting through the rock to excavate the tunnel, in March 1912, part of the roadway caved into the excavation site at 87th Street.

In 1913, as part of the Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, the Public Service Commission planned to split the original Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) system from looking like a &quot;Z&quot; system (as seen on a map) to an H-shaped system. The original system would be split into three segments: two north–south lines, carrying through trains over the Lexington Avenue and Broadway–Seventh Avenue Lines, and a west–east shuttle under 42nd Street. This would form a roughly H-shaped system. It was predicted that the subway extension would lead to the growth of the Upper East Side and the Bronx.

The 86th Street station opened on July 17, 1918, with service initially running between Grand Central–42nd Street and 167th Street via the line&#x27;s local tracks. On August 1, the &quot;H system&quot; was put into place, with through service beginning on the new east and west side trunk lines, and the institution of the 42nd Street Shuttle along the old connection between the sides. The station&#x27;s lower level opened on this date with the inauguration of express service. The cost of the extension from Grand Central was $58 million.

===Station renovations===
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. In late 1959, contracts were awarded to extend the platforms at Bowling Green, Wall Street, Fulton Street, Canal Street, Spring Street, Bleecker Street, Astor Place, Grand Central, 86th Street and 125th Street to to accommodate ten-car trains.

In 1970, with the construction of a Gimbels department store directly above, Gimbels agreed to renovate the station&#x27;s entrances. For over a year, community members had asked Gimbels to include an entrance into the store&#x27;s basement from the subway. While the renovation took place mostly in the fare control areas, work was also done to fix the station&#x27;s lighting, walls, floors, turnstiles, stairways, and token booths. The Gimbels store opened in 1972. The renovation project cost $405,000.

In 1983, the MTA added funding for a renovation of the 86th Street station to its 1980–1984 capital plan. The station was renovated again in 1986 as part of a move to prevent the existing New York City Subway stations from falling apart after years of deferred maintenance. This was evidenced by the addition of the then standard orange platform edge in addition to the yellow platform edge that was originally there. The I-beams were painted red instead of the original blue and the other parts of the station were fixed.

This station was renovated in 2003, along with the 77th Street and 116th Street stations on the Lexington Avenue Line. As part of the project, structural deficiencies were repaired, signage and lighting were enhanced, electrical service was upgraded, station facilities were rehabilitated, new fare arrays and a new token booth were installed, and portions of the station were upgraded to be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. In addition, visual clutter was eliminated, and artwork was installed. The contract for the station renovation project, which was expected to take two year, was expected to be advertised in October 2000. The contract for these three stations was awarded in October 2001, and the projects were done in-house. The cost of the work at 86th Street station was $27.3 million, of which $20.3 million came from the Federal government.

In fall 2004, the station renovation project was completed. It consisted of repainting the I-beams from red to dark blue, as well as the removal of train arrival devices on the upper level that gave notices of approaching express trains on the lower level, among other things; the latter was replaced with countdown clocks, on both levels, which performed the same function. This station was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 30, 2005.

An ADA-accessible elevator to the northbound local platform was added in the 2010s. The rest of the station remained inaccessible, since there was no elevator from the local platform to the express platform and no elevators on the southbound side. Accessibility of the entire station was proposed in August 2019 as part of the MTA&#x27;s &quot;Fast Forward&quot; program.

A request for proposals was put out on May 18, 2023 for the contract for a project bundle to make 13 stations accessible, including completing work at 86th Street. The contract for three additional elevators was awarded that December.

== Station layout ==

This underground station has two levels, each with two tracks and two side platforms. Each platform is long and up to wide. The upper level serves local trains while the lower level, located approximately below ground, serves express trains. The 4 and 6 stop here at all times, and the 5 stops here at all times except late nights. There is no express service during late nights and the lower level is closed during that period. The next stop to the north is for local trains and for express trains, while the next stop to the south is for local trains and for express trains.

On each side, four staircases connect the levels: two each near the center of either platform and one each toward the northern and southern ends. There are no crossovers or crossunders between the platforms, making this one of only two express stations in the system where free transfers between opposite directions are not possible.

Because the Dual Contracts specified that the street surfaces needed to remain intact during the system&#x27;s construction, a temporary web of timber supports was erected to support the streets overhead while the platforms were being constructed. The tunnel is covered by a U-shaped trough that contains utility pipes and wires. The outer walls of this trough are composed of columns, spaced approximately every 5 feet (1.5 m) with concrete infill between them. There is a 1-inch (25 mm) gap between the tunnel wall and the trackside wall, which is made of 4-inch (100 mm)-thick brick covered over by a tiled finish. Additional columns between the tracks, spaced every 5 feet (1.5 m), support the jack-arched concrete station roofs. Teal columns run along all four platforms at regular intervals.

The walls along all four platforms are clad with white ceramic tiles. The ceramic tiles were installed during the early-2000s renovation and are raised about from the original layer of tile. At the top of each wall is a colored mosaic frieze consisting mostly of yellows and browns. Small &quot;86&quot; tablets in a circle run along this frieze. The name tablets have &quot;86TH STREET&quot; in a white serif font on a reddish-brown background with a buff-colored inner border and green outer border. Similar tile signs reading &quot;DOWNTOWN TRAINS&quot; and &quot;UPTOWN TRAINS&quot;, accompanied by white arrows, are on the walls. At the extreme southern ends of all four platforms, there are tan terracotta blocks and a darker trim line with &quot;86TH ST&quot; written on it in white sans serif font at regular intervals.

Each upper-level platform has one same-level fare control area in the center. The southbound side has a turnstile bank and token booth. The northbound fare control has an unstaffed turnstile bank.

The 2004 artwork here is called &quot;Happy City&quot; by Peter Sis. It consists of four different glass and etched stone mosaic murals in the shapes of huge eyes surrounded by various animals and objects. They are located at each stop of the four staircases near the fare control areas that go down to the lower level express platforms.

===Exits===
This station has separate entrances for the northbound and southbound platforms. All of the entrances are at the intersection of Lexington Avenue and 86th Street.

From the southbound fare control, two staircases go up to the southwest corner of East 86th Street and Lexington Avenue, and two more that are built inside a Best Buy store on the northwest corner of the same intersection.

From the northbound fare control, there is an unstaffed turnstile bank and two staircases going up to the southeast corner of East 86th Street and Lexington Avenue. An additional staircase and an elevator rise to the northeast corner. The elevator and staircase replace two narrow staircases formerly located inside a now-demolished shopping arcade at that corner. The elevator and staircase installations are part of the construction of a luxury residential tower at 147 East 86th Street.

<doc id="728960" wikidata="Q461816" url="?curid=728960" title="Hussain Muhammad Ershad">
<text>Hussain Muhammad Ershad (1 February 1930 – 14 July 2019) was a Bangladeshi military officer and politician who served as the president of Bangladesh from 1982 to 1990.

He seized power as head of the army during a bloodless coup against President Abdus Sattar on 24 March 1982 (by imposing martial law and suspending the Constitution). He declared himself President in 1983, and subsequently won the controversial 1986 Bangladeshi presidential election. Despite claims to have legitimately won the 1986 election, many consider his regime as an era of military dictatorship. Ershad served in the Presidential office until 1990, when he was forced to resign following a popular pro-democracy mass uprising led by Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina. His government was a military dictatorship. Ershad founded the Jatiya Party in 1986 and became a Member of Parliament for that party in the constituency of Rangpur-3 in 1991, with successful re-election in all subsequent general elections. He was the longest serving male head of government in Bangladeshi history.

During his tenure, Ershad pursued devolution reforms, privatization of nationalised industries; the expansion of the national highway system; and the founding of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation; he committed his nation&#x27;s forces as an ally to the United States in the Gulf War. He contributed to developments in infrastructure and socio-economic growth, divesting key nationalised industries. In 1989, Ershad pushed parliament to make Islam the state religion, in a sharp departure from Bangladesh&#x27;s original secular constitution.

==Early life and military career==
Ershad was born in 1930 at Dinhata in Cooch Behar Princely State, British India (now in Cooch Behar district, India) to Mokbul Hossain and Mazida Khatun, in a Bengali Muslim family of Nashya Shaikh origin. Mokbul was a lawyer who served as a minister of the then Maharaja of Cooch Behar and was the son of Wakil Saadatullah. Ershad was the eldest of nine siblings including GM Quader, Mozammel Hossain Lalu and Merina Rahman. His parents migrated from Dinhata to East Bengal in 1948 after the Partition of India. Ershad studied in Carmichael College in Rangpur. He later graduated from the University of Dhaka in 1950.

Ershad was commissioned into the Pakistan Army in 1952 from officers training school in Kohat. He was an adjutant in the East Bengal Regimental Centre, the regimental training depot in Chittagong. He completed advanced courses from the Command and Staff College in Quetta in 1966. After serving with a brigade in Sialkot, he was given command of the 3rd East Bengal Regiment in 1969 and the 7th East Bengal Regiment in 1971.

==Bangladesh War of Independence and after==
From the beginning of the Bangladesh War of Independence, Ershad was interned along with other Bengali officers stationed in West Pakistan and held as a prisoner of war. In 1973, he and the others were repatriated to the new nation of Bangladesh in accordance with the Simla Agreement between India&#x27;s Indira Gandhi and Pakistan&#x27;s Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.

After his return, Ershad was appointed as Adjutant General of the Bangladesh Army by President of Bangladesh Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the first president of independent Bangladesh. The different experiences during the war of the professional and paramilitary officers and soldiers in Bangladesh, together with the country&#x27;s diverse cultures and Muslim majority, created instabilities in the years after independence. The members of the army who had been imprisoned or otherwise out of the country during the 1971 war later tended to form different political alliances than those who had participated in the war. This long influenced the instability of national politics and the armed forces. Ershad was sent for advanced military courses to the National Defence University (NDU), India.

On 15 August 1975, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated. Although Maj. Gen. Ziaur Rahman was arrested in a counter-coup on 3 November 1975, he was restored to power in a coup led by Lt. Colonel Abu Taher on 7 November 1975. The Chief Justice of Bangladesh, Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem, succeeded to the presidency on 7 November 1975 during martial law. At that time, Ziaur Rahman was appointed as the Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrator. General Ziaur Rahman was appointed Army Chief by President of Bangladesh Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad. Rahman appointed Ershad as the Deputy Chief of Army Staff in 1975.
Ziaur Rahman assumed the presidency after legalising the military coups. He revived the multi-party system through the Fifth Amendment of the Bangladesh Constitution. He appointed Ershad as the new Chief of Army Staff, promoting him to the rank of lieutenant general. Viewed as a professional officer and having a talent for Bengali speech writing, Ershad soon became the closest politico-military counsellor of Ziaur Rahman.

== Coup and presidency ==

After the assassination of Ziaur Rahman on 30 May 1981, Ershad remained loyal to the government. He ordered the army to suppress the coup attempt by Major General Abul Manzur. Ershad maintained loyalty to the new president Abdus Sattar, who had led the BNP to victory in elections in 1982.
Ershad came to power in a bloodless coup on 24 March 1982 as Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA). President Abdus Sattar was replaced with A. F. M. Ahsanuddin Chowdhury.

Ershad imitated his predecessor President Zia in many ways. Initially, he too installed a civilian president, Abul Fazal Muhammed Ahsanuddin Chowdhury (March 1982—December 1983), and became the President only on 11 December 1983. He also floated a state‐sponsored political party, Jatiya Party (JP), composed of various factions from leftist and rightist political parties to support his regime. Like his predecessor, he allowed political parties to be active.

Suspending the constitution and political parties, Ershad took over as president on 11 December 1983 by replacing Chowdhury. Ersahd ordered the embassy of the Soviet Union to reduce their staff after the government allegedly saw embassy personnel with anti-government protestors. The police had detained two Soviet diplomats outside of Dhaka last year and Ershad had expressed fear of the Soviet Union.

Ershad supported the &quot;Land Reforms Ordinance of 1984,&quot; which granted important rights to tenants for the first time in the history of Bangladesh. A plan for the divestment of government industries promised to move the country away from socialism. In January 1985, he dissolved his council of ministers ahead of the general election. Bangladeshi lawyers went on work absentation to call for fair election and removal of Ershad. In March 1985, Ershad reimposed martial law on Bangladesh. Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia were placed under house arrest. He deployed the Army for the referendum seeking approval to stay in power till the next election. In July 1985, he increased the size of his cabinet to 21 ministers which included Kazi Zafar Ahmed and Sirakuul Hossain Khan.

Ershad played a key role during the founding summit of the countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in 1985, which was held in Dhaka. Member states of South Asian States agreed to cooperate in politics and economics. Ershad brought together the leaders of India and Pakistan, Rajiv Gandhi and Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, respectively.

As president, Ershad approved amendments to the constitution of Bangladesh which declared Islam the state religion, abandoning state secularism. (The secular constitution was later restored) To improve rural administration, Ershad introduced the Upazila and Zila Parishad system. He held the &#x27;first democratic elections for these village councils&#x27; in 1985.

===Election of 1986 and 1988===

Jatiyo Party nominated Ershad in the Presidential Election of 1986, which was organised by his government. The only significant opposition candidates were Hafezzi Huzur and Syed Faruque Rahman, a retired colonel who had been accused in 15 August Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and 3 November jail killing in 1975. Parliamentary elections on 7 May 1986, held under the martial law. Main contenders for the parliamentary seats were the Jatiya (People&#x27;s) Party, formed on 1 January 1986 when the nationwide ban on political activity was lifted, and comprising the five parties which had together formed the pro-government National Front in July 1985 and the opposition leftist Awami League, led by Sheikh Hasina. The largest political party of the second Parliament, BNP decided to boycott the poll. Election day was held in a climate of unrest and was marked by opposition charges of voting fraud and malpractices. On 10 May, polling was suspended in 109 constituencies. Following re-elections in 37 constituencies on 19 May, final results giving JP an absolute parliamentary majority were announced ten days later. Ershad&#x27;s JP was declared the winner with 153 seats out of 300. There were 115 opposition and 32 independent members. However, the inaugural House session was boycotted by 119 opposition and independent MPs. The same day, a new cabinet was sworn in. Ershad was elected as president on 15 October 1986. The inauguration saw widespread violence and protests against the government.

However, Ershad faced increasing mass demonstrations on the streets mobilised by both the AL led by Sheikh Hasina and the BNP led by Khaleda Zia. The BNP boycotted the 1986 parliamentary election, but the AL which contested in the parliamentary election, later resigned from the parliament. In November 1986, Pope John Paul II visited Bangladesh. Ershad named Justice Minister A. K. M. Nurul Islam his vice-president in December. He replaced Minister of Home Affairs Mahmudal Hasan with M. A. Matin. He dismissed the Deputy Minister for Health and Family Planning and his sister-in-law, Mumta Wahab.

Bangladesh saw violent protests in 1987 calling for the resignation of Ershad. In July, eight people died in 54-hour general strike and hundreds were injured. The protest started against a new law that would allow the military to have role in local development which was opposed by the leader of the opposition Sheikh Hasina. In October, security forces detained more than 4300 opposition activists. In November, Ershad banned marches in Dhaka. On 28 November, he declared a state of emergency which was followed by arrest of opposition leaders including Mirza Golam Hafiz and Zillur Rahman. On 6 December 1987, Ershad dissolved the parliament in the midst of an opposition campaign calling for his and his government&#x27;s resignation, and a nationwide state of emergency, which had been declared on 27 November. He stated that he wished to pave the way for fresh elections to receive the people&#x27;s mandate on various national issues. The polling date was originally set for 28 February before being postponed.

In January 1988, the government banned all political rallies. 80 people died in violence related to local council elections in February. The University of Dhaka, which was the centre of opposition against Ershad, saw session jams and decline in academic activities due to the unrest. Polling day was marked by violence and a boycott by the three leading opposition groups - the Awami League (an eight-party alliance) headed by Sheikh Hasina Wazed, the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami and the right-wing BNP, all of which alleged electoral fraud. In this context, the ruling Jatiya Dal, or Nationalist Party, reportedly increased its parliamentary majority to 251 seats (including 18 unopposed), independents captured 25 seats and several minor parties shared the rest. On 27 March, a new Council of Ministers headed by Ershad was sworn in. The Prime Minister is Moudud Ahmed. In June 1988, Ershad led the parliament in making Islam the State Religion of Bangladesh. He dissolved the Election Reforms Commission after its chairman Justice Badrul Haider Chowdhury criticized the government. Bangladesh saw nationwide floods which killed more than 121 people. More than 680 died in Monsoon floods.

=== Pressure for democracy ===
In January 1990, the government banned protests outside of the parliament. Bangladesh sent two brigades to join the United States led coalition forces in the first Gulf War.

The effective end of the Cold War unleashed democratic forces and dried up international support for military rule in Bangladesh. A wide umbrella of political parties united against Ershad. Khaleda Zia led the BNP, which allied with the Awami League, led by Sheikh Hasina, and Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh.

Student activists of various parties united in anti-regime street demonstrations. They were joined by labour unions and government workers. By late November 1990, the uprising shut down government services and paralysed the major cities. In a bid to subdue the opposition, Ershad attempted to declare martial law, but Chief of the Army Staff Lieutenant General Nuruddin Khan refused to support him. Ultimately Ershad was forced to step down on 6 December 1990. Lieutenant General Mohammad Noor Uddin Khan removed officers loyal to Ershad.

Ershad appointed Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed to form an acceptable neutral caretaker government and prepare for democratic elections. This was an innovation that was not provided for in the constitution . Shahabuddin immediately placed Ershad under arrest and detained him, an action declared illegal in 1998 in a case appealed to the nation&#x27;s Supreme Court.

In 1996, the newly elected government of the Awami League selected Shahabuddin as the President and appointed Lt Gen Nuruddin Khan as the Energy Minister. After a period, he was demoted to minister without portfolio for gross mismanagement.
Although anti-Ershad sentiment was strong, Ershad contested the 1996 election from jail and still won all five different constituencies he had contested from in 1991. The new government led by the BNP&#x27;s Khaleda Zia instituted a number of corruption charges. Ershad was convicted in two charges till date, while all others were dismissed and thrown out of court.

== Legacy ==
Ershad stabilized the Bangladesh Armed Forces, which had struggled with a series of coups and countercoups since the nation achieved independence in 1971. These arose in part because of the division in the Army between those who had participated in the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, and those who had been interned or voluntarily stayed in West Pakistan during the conflict. As those men were repatriated and the Armed Forces needed their participation, they were welcomed back, but complained of discrimination in favour of the freedom fighters. The repatriated officers comprised 60% of the officers and a sizeable interest group. The freedom fighters, part of the development of Bangladesh from the beginning, tended to identify with the Awami League. The repatriated officers tended to identify with the BNP as the opposition. They carried out their rivalries in part through coups.

The Bangladesh Armed Forces did not attempt any coups from Ershad&#x27;s takeover in 1982 until the fall of the BNP government in 1996. The Awami League in alliance with Jatiya Party won the June 1996 general election.

Ershad approved the participation in 1988 of the Bangladesh Army in United Nations Peacekeeping Operations for the first time. In addition to contributing to multi-national initiatives, this enabled the Armed Forces to earn foreign currency. Their participation in other UN-sponsored actions has continued to contribute to the treasury.

Ershad accelerated the privatisation of state owned enterprises which had begun in 1975 and encouraged private and foreign investment through his &#x27;New Industrial Policy&#x27;. The boom in exports in the garment industry also continued under his rule, employing large numbers of women albeit in harsh conditions.

The Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority (JMBA) was set up by an ordinance promulgated by the then President Ershad on 3 July 1985 to implement the project. For mobilisation of domestic resources, another ordinance was promulgated by which a Jamuna Bridge surcharge and levy were introduced. A total of Tk 5.08 billion was mobilised in the process till its abolition.

Ershad was awarded the United Nations&#x27; Population Award in 1987 for his contributions to population and environmental issues.

On 15 May 2011, Supreme Court declared the military rule of Ershad illegal in a verdict that also said the actions taken by his regime will remain effective until their fate is decided by parliament. &quot;All proclamations, Martial Law Regulations, Martial Law Orders, made/promulgated during the period between 24 March 1982 and the date of commencement of the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1986 (Act 1 of 1986) are hereby declared illegal and void...,&quot; the SC said in its brief verdict.

==Post-presidency political career==
Ershad, is the only high-profile politician to be convicted of corruption and serve a prison sentence. Legal complexities tend to prolong the investigation and settlement of the corruption cases against senior politicians in Bangladesh.&quot; We really don&#x27;t know what will be the fate of these cases&quot;, lawyer Shahdeen Malik told the BBC.

Ershad lost his membership in parliament owing to his conviction on charges of corruption when his relations with the ruling Awami League subsequently deteriorated. He switched his support to his one-time political adversary and main opposition leader, Khaleda Zia forming an anti-government coalition. Thus, the questionable court verdict followed.

Both Khaleda Zia of BNP and Sheikh Hasina of Awami League allied together to oust Ershad. Ironically both of these two top parties also allied with him and his Jatiya Party in time of their need to suit their purpose.

Ershad called President Iajuddin Ahmed three times along with Kazi Zafar Ahmed twice on 23 December not to extend two days time for filing nominations for scheduled 22 January 2007 elections when Awami League and its allies decided to join that elections after long parley of Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury with Sheikh Hasina. However, for the sake of continuation of democratic process Chowdhury convinced all concerned that without both Awami League and BNP the election will not be credible.

On 30 June 2007, Ershad stepped down temporarily from the post of Party chairman, indicating an end to his political career. It is speculated that he stepped down under pressure as the Caretaker Government started a series of prosecution and arrest for corruption and criminal charges against political leaders of Awami League and BNP including Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia and Zia&#x27;s son Tareq Rahman among others.

===Arrest===
On 1 March 1998, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh ruled that President Ershad&#x27;s original arrest in 1990 by the caretaker government, led by Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed, was illegal. This ruling would have permitted Ershad to sue the government for wrongful arrest. Ershad was convicted on a separate and unrelated charge eleven years after this arrest.

=== Charges and convictions ===

Ershad has been convicted and served time for only one case that has been upheld by the Supreme Court of the nation – Janata Tower Case. When his relations with the ruling Awami League subsequently deteriorated as he joined hands with the other main opposition BNP of Khaleda Zia.

He was found guilty in the Janata corruption case and was sentenced by the trial court to seven years imprisonment. Later the High Court Division affirmed the conviction but reduced the sentence to five years. The people were charged with building the Janata. It involved two charges – abuse of power in allotting land in Dhaka, which took place after Ershad colluded with M. M. Rahmat Ullah; and possessing unaccounted money. The Justice in his 91-page verdict found Ershad guilty under the Prevention Act.

Ershad was sentenced in corruption case on 20 November 2000. He was released on bail, on 9 April 2001 after serving four months in jail in Dhaka. As a result, he could not contest the 2001 elections.

At the time of his death there were still a few other pending cases against him but most had been thrown out of the court or had cleared him of any wrongdoing. The most famous case that the BNP Government at the time falsely implicated him by was a gold smuggling case. This was later thrown out by a Dhaka Court.

===Return===

In 2006, he protested against the controversial Election Commissioner (CEC) MA Aziz decisions on holding polls.

In 2006, as the BNP&#x27;s term was ending Ershad joined the party&#x27;s 4-Party Alliance after meetings with Tarique and Babar, which were followed by meeting with Khaleda Zia at her Mainul Road House. However, in late October 2006, he said he was not in the 4-Party Alliance, reversing his position the following day. Then he went into hiding for 3 days and joined the Awami League&#x27;s Grand Alliance at Paltan Maidan with Sheikh Hasina.

But Hasina later breached the agreement between the two which promised to make Ershad the President for at least six months. Moeen also committed to make him president before 11 January 2007, but did not. Earlier, Ershad had been offered the position of head of the Government in 1991 by Sheikh Hasina while he was in jail, as well as by Khaleda Zia in 1996 just before the Awami League formed the government after a period of 21 years. Then, Ershad had joined the 4-Party alliance after the 1996 elections, but left later.

On 8 April 2008, Ershad took charge of his Jatiya Party once again. On 19 November 2008, Jatiya Party and Awami League agreed to contest the elections jointly under the Caretaker Government to be held on 29 December 2008. Out of the 300 constituencies in the parliament, Ershad&#x27;s Jatiya Party contested from 49 (later 42 as Awami League did not pull back its candidates from few seats as agreed earlier) seats and Awami League and members of a leftist Fourteen Party Coalition from the rest 250 seats. At the last minute, Ershad supported the Awami League in the December 2008 election. Thus, the Grand Alliance emerged in Bangladesh.

Ershad contested the Bangladesh Parliamentary Election 2008 from three constituencies. According to Bangladesh electoral laws, a person is allowed to contest from three places, but can retain only one seat and two are to have by-elections after formation of government. These constituencies included Rangpur (Rangpur-3 and Kurigram-2), and Dhaka-17, the capital&#x27;s diplomatic zone, where he resides. He won all three seats in the election.

The 2014 Election was a controversial election for Jatiya Party where Ershad&#x27;s spokesperson Bobby Hajjaj had first publicly declared that Jatiya Party would not participate in the election. After the 2014 election, Ershad became the special envoy of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the Awami League-led government. Jatiya Party became the opposition party and Rowshan Ershad, Ershad&#x27;s wife, became the leader of the opposition. Despite being in the opposition party some leaders of Jatiya Party were also in the government cabinet. In January 2016, Ershad&#x27;s brother, GM Quader, was made the vice chairman of the party. In April 2016, Ershad appointed Rowshan as the vice-chairman of the party. In March 2017, Ershad indicated he might form a new political alliance with 14 other parties. For the next general election, the Jatiya Party under Ershad formed a 58 party grand alliance of its own. But of the 58 parties, only the Jatiya Party and Bangladesh Islami Front had registration with the election commission as of 2017.

== Electoral history ==
=== Presidential election ===
=== Jatiya Sangsad election ===
== Personal life ==
Ershad married Rowshan Ershad in 1956. The couple had a son and daughter - Saad Ershad and Jebin Ershad. Jebin lives in London with her husband and two children, Nico Ershad and Savi Ershad.

Rowshan was elected five times as a Jatiya Sangsad member, nominated each time by the Jatiya party. Only in the 2008 election, did Ershad decided to join the Awami League-led alliance and Rowshan went with BNP. After his death, she became the senior co-chairman of the Jatiya party.

Ershad later married Bidisha Siddique in 2000. It ended in a divorce and sedition charges brought by the then BNP Government against her in 2005. He divorced her for allegedly hiding her first marriage, which still was not annulled at the time of their marriage. Together they had a son, Eric Ershad.

Ershad had adopted a son.

In 1986, Britain&#x27;s The Observer newspaper quoted a woman named Marieum Mumtaz as saying she had secretly married Ershad on 14 August 1982, after he forced her to divorce banker Chowdhury Badruddin. Early in 1990, the story surfaced again in the New York Post and The Sunday Correspondent. In June 1990, she filed a suit against Ershad in the United States, seeking dissolution of marriage. She alleged that he had abandoned her.

In 1990, Dainik Bangla, a government-owned daily, claimed Ershad and Zeenat Mosharraf used to meet at a guest house owned by the Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation. Zeenat&#x27;s husband, A. K. M. Mosharraf Hossain, was the company&#x27;s chairman until 1988 when he was given a job in Ershad&#x27;s government as secretary of the Ministry of Industries.

===Religious views===
Ershad was a devotee of the Sufi Pir Atroshi and spent considerable time with him during his presidency.

==Death==
Ershad was admitted to Combined Military Hospital, Dhaka on 26 June 2019 and on 29 June after his condition suddenly deteriorated. He died on
14 July 2019 at the hospital.
Ershad&#x27;s state funeral took place 2 days following his death.

<text>The 96th Street station is a local station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Lexington Avenue and 96th Street in the Carnegie Hill and East Harlem neighborhoods of Manhattan, it is served by the train at all times, the &lt;6&gt; train during weekdays in the peak direction, and the train during late nights.

This station was constructed as part of the Dual Contracts by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and opened in 1918. It was renovated in the 1990s.

== History ==
Following the completion of the original subway, there were plans to construct a line along Manhattan&#x27;s east side north of 42nd Street. The original plan for what became the extension north of 42nd Street was to continue it south through Irving Place and into what is now the BMT Broadway Line at Ninth Street and Broadway. In July 1911, the IRT had withdrawn from the talks, and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) was to operate on Lexington Avenue. The IRT submitted an offer for what became its portion of the Dual Contracts on February 27, 1912.

In 1913, as part of the Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, the Public Service Commission planned to split the original Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) system from looking like a &quot;Z&quot; system (as seen on a map) to an H-shaped system. The original system would be split into three segments: two north–south lines, carrying through trains over the Lexington Avenue and Broadway–Seventh Avenue Lines, and a west–east shuttle under 42nd Street. This would form a roughly H-shaped system. It was predicted that the subway extension would lead to the growth of the Upper East Side and the Bronx.

The 96th Street station opened on July 17, 1918, with service initially running between Grand Central–42nd Street and 167th Street via the line&#x27;s local tracks. On August 1, the &quot;H system&quot; was put into place, with through service beginning on the new east and west side trunk lines, and the institution of the 42nd Street Shuttle along the old connection between the sides. The cost of the extension from Grand Central was $58 million.

The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The station was renovated in the 1990s, and had its original tilework restored.

== Station layout ==
The station has two local tracks and two side platforms. The 6 stops here at all times, and the 4 stops here during late nights. The express tracks run on a lower level and are not visible from the platforms. The station is between to the north and to the south.

A crossover is provided, with a mosaic in the mezzanine entitled &quot;City Suite&quot;, commissioned in 1994. There are new &quot;96th Street&quot; mosaics, and a window in the mezzanine overlooks the tracks, giving a view of oncoming trains from the south. The south end of the station features a rounded ceiling due to problems encountered during construction. Both platforms have emergency exits from the lower level express tracks.

===Exits===
The station has staircases leading to all four corners of the intersection of Lexington Avenue and 96th Street.

<doc id="728969" wikidata="Q1872869" url="?curid=728969" title="103rd Street station (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)">
<text>The 103rd Street station is a local station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Lexington Avenue and 103rd Street in East Harlem, it is served by the train at all times, the &lt;6&gt; train during weekdays in the peak direction, and the train during late nights.

This station was constructed as part of the Dual Contracts by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and opened in 1918. It was renovated in 1990 and in 2015–2016.

== History ==

=== Construction and opening ===
Following the completion of the original subway, there were plans to construct a line along Manhattan&#x27;s east side north of 42nd Street. The original plan for what became the extension north of 42nd Street was to continue it south through Irving Place and into what is now the BMT Broadway Line at Ninth Street and Broadway. In July 1911, the IRT had withdrawn from the talks, and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) was to operate on Lexington Avenue. The IRT submitted an offer for what became its portion of the Dual Contracts on February 27, 1912.

In 1913, as part of the Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, the Public Service Commission planned to split the original Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) system from looking like a &quot;Z&quot; system (as seen on a map) to an H-shaped system. The original system would be split into three segments: two north–south lines, carrying through trains over the Lexington Avenue and Broadway–Seventh Avenue Lines, and a west–east shuttle under 42nd Street. This would form a roughly H-shaped system. It was predicted that the subway extension would lead to the growth of the Upper East Side and the Bronx.

The 103rd Street station opened on July 17, 1918, with service initially running between Grand Central–42nd Street and 167th Street via the line&#x27;s local tracks. On August 1, the &quot;H system&quot; was put into place, with through service beginning on the new east and west side trunk lines, and the institution of the 42nd Street Shuttle along the old connection between the sides. The cost of the extension from Grand Central was $58 million ().

=== Later years ===

The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. A renovation of the 103rd Street station was funded as part of the MTA&#x27;s 1980–1984 capital plan. The MTA received a $106 million () grant from the Urban Mass Transit Administration in October 1983; most of the grant would fund the renovation of eleven stations, including 103rd Street. This station was renovated in 1990.

The Downtown platform was renovated in 2015, with the placement of new white wall tiles, new floor tiles and benches. From January 26, 2016, to May 23, 2016, the Uptown platform was closed for renovation and was done in the same style as the Downtown platform. This was completed about a month earlier than planned.

== Station layout ==

This underground station has four tracks and two side platforms. The two center express tracks are used by the 4 and trains during daytime hours. The 6 stops here at all times, and the 4 stops here during late nights. The station is between to the north and to the south.

All other stations between Grand Central–42nd Street and 125th Street on the line, except 110th Street, have the local tracks on an upper level and express ones on the lower level, with emergency exits provided at local stations for emergency egress.

Both platforms have their original trim line, which has &quot;103&quot; tablets on it at regular intervals, and name tablets, which read &quot;103RD STREET&quot; in the original mosaic. Prior to the 1990 station renovation, mosaic tiles were used so as to depict the 103rd Street mosaic as a sign hanging down from a horizontal support beam above. These &quot;signholders&quot; were covered over in 1990. An emergency phone is present immediately to the south of the southbound local platform.

The 1990 ceramic artwork here is called &quot;Neo-Boriken&quot; by Nitza Tufiño, based on the neighborhood&#x27;s Caribbean and Latin American heritage. According to the accompanying plaque, P.R.O.M.I.S.E. (Puerto Rican Organization for Growth Research Education and Self Sufficiency) helped to fund the murals. This is one of two projects Tufiño made for MTA Arts &amp; Design; the other, &quot;Westside Views&quot; – a community project for which she was the lead artist – can be found at 86th Street.

===Exits===
The station&#x27;s only entrance/exit is a mezzanine above the platforms and tracks near the south end. It has two staircases from each platform, a waiting area that can be used as a crossover, turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs going up to the southeast and southwest corners of 103rd Street and Lexington Avenue. The mezzanine has mosaics indicating uptown and downtown directions. The fences surrounding each exit stairway are unusual as each section of the fence is at a different elevation, as they are located on Duffy&#x27;s Hill, a sharp incline, on Lexington Avenue between 102nd and 103rd Streets.

<doc id="728971" wikidata="Q5036220" url="?curid=728971" title="Capreol">
<text>Capreol ( ) is a community in the Ontario city of Greater Sudbury. Situated on the Vermilion River (35 mins north of the downtown core), Capreol is the city&#x27;s northernmost populated area.

From 1918 to 2000, Capreol existed as an independent town. However, on January 1, 2001, the towns and cities of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury were amalgamated into the single-tier city of Greater Sudbury.

==History==
===Early settlement, development and expansion===
Capreol formed around the Capreol railway station, which was a major divisional point on the Canadian National Railway line. Its name comes from Frederick Chase Capreol, the original promoter of the Northern Railway of Canada. It was founded in 1911 and incorporated as a town in 1918. The first family to move into Capreol was Adolph and Margaret Sawyer, both of whom pioneered in farming.

Although the town was originally an independent community with its own thriving economy, it gradually became a satellite community to the more rapidly growing city of Sudbury, approximately 40 kilometres to the south. In 1916, there were thirty families in town, and by 1919, sixty houses had been built. It was then decided that Capreol would build its own YMCA. In 1920, the construction of the YMCA was in progress, but was damaged by fire, to the extent of $40,000. The YMCA was rebuilt at double the cost and finally opened in 1921.

In 1973, the boundaries of the town of Capreol were expanded to include the nearby villages of Sellwood and Milnet, and the town was incorporated into the Regional Municipality of Sudbury. However, despite its status as part of the regional municipality, during this era Statistics Canada did not include the town in Sudbury&#x27;s Census Metropolitan Area.

===Ghost towns===
The former villages of Milnet and Sellwood, located within the area annexed by Capreol in 1973, are both now ghost towns. The National Steel Corporation mined iron ore in Sellwood and transported it south to Depot Harbour for onwards shipment to its plants in Detroit.

Milnet (originally named Sellwood Junction up to 1916) began as a stop along the Canadian Northern Railway. In 1917, after the railway was laid down, the Marshay Lumber Company built a mill and began a 22-year process of cutting trees from the area. Men from logging camps upstream would let the Vermilion River carry the logs to the mill in Milnet. From there the men at the mill would cut the wood on the blade and then move it along to the planar mill, for eventual shipment eastwards by rail.

An open pit mine now stands where the Sellwood townsite once was.

===Amalgamation===
On January 1, 2001, Capreol and the other cities and towns of the regional municipality were amalgamated into the city of Greater Sudbury. In the Canada 2011 Census, Capreol was listed for the first time as one of six distinct population centres (or urban areas) within the city, with a population of 3,276 and a population density of 537.7 km2; however, the boundaries of this statistical aggregation correspond only to the main townsite of Capreol, and not to the full municipal boundaries as they existed prior to 2001. The community is part of Ward 7 on Greater Sudbury City Council, and is represented by councillor Mike Jakubo.

==Sports and culture==

Capreol is the location of the Northern Ontario Railroad Museum, a heritage attraction located in the former CN and CNoR superintendent&#x27;s home and Prescott Park, taking up a large portion of the town&#x27;s downtown core parallel to the railroad tracks.

From 1978 to 1986, Capreol had a Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League team called the Capreol Hawks, who won the league title in 1980-81.

==Transportation==

Capreol has a long history as a Northern Ontario railway town and is today still situated along the Canadian National Railway mainline. It is served by the &quot;Canadian&quot;, Canada&#x27;s transcontinental passenger rail service, which is operated by Via Rail and which stops at Capreol station. Capreol station marks the &quot;Canadian&quot;&#x27;s last north- and west-bound stop in Greater Sudbury before continuing its journey toward Northwestern Ontario and, ultimately, British Columbia.

Local bus service is available in Capreol via Greater Sudbury Transit&#x27;s 105 Valley Route, which connects with downtown Sudbury and the Sudbury Transit Centre.

<doc id="728979" wikidata="Q1343116" url="?curid=728979" title="U-turn">
<text>A U-turn in driving refers to performing a 180° rotation to reverse the direction of travel. It is called a &quot;U-turn&quot; because the maneuver looks like the letter U. In some areas, the maneuver is illegal, while in others, it is treated as a more ordinary turn, merely extended. In still other areas, lanes are occasionally marked &quot;U-turn permitted&quot; or even &quot;U-turn only.&quot;

Occasionally, on a divided highway, special U-turn ramps exist to allow traffic to make a U-turn, though often their use is restricted to emergency and police vehicles only.

In the United States, U-turn regulations vary by state: in Indiana U-turns are allowed as long as the driver follows all of the precautions normally ascribed to making a left turn (yielding right-of-way, etc.). Many places, including Texas and Georgia, have specially designed U-turn lanes (referred to as Texas U-turn lanes). In Michigan, U-turns are required for many left turns to and from divided highways, as part of the Michigan left maneuver.

In some special situations, U-turns can be regulated through the use of a traffic light, where it is the only directional choice and drivers in the specified lane cannot continue forward (“U-turn only” lanes). 
==Prohibited U-turns==
Although U-turns are considered safer than two and three-point turns, they are often prohibited for various reasons. Sometimes a sign indicates the legality of U-turns. However, traffic regulations in many jurisdictions specifically prohibit certain types of U-turns. Laws vary by jurisdiction as to when a U-turn may or may not be legal. Examples of jurisdictions with codified U-turn prohibitions include the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia and the U.S. states of Colorado and Oregon.

=== Canada ===
In Alberta, U-turns are prohibited in certain circumstances, for example (ref. Alberta Regulation 304/2002, Division 7):

* At the crest of a hill or on a curve unless the driver can see at least 150 m ahead
* Anywhere a sign prohibits a U-turn
* In urban areas between intersections
* At alleys and driveways
* At an intersection controlled by a traffic signal (unless signage or signals specifically allow this maneuver)
* By a school bus on an undivided highway or on a divided highway where the length of the bus is longer than the width of the median between the two carriageways
Other provinces and territories that prohibit U-turns at traffic signals include Yukon, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan, Article 49 of the Act Governing the Punishment of Violation of Road traffic Regulations () administratively fines a motorist 600 to 1800 new Taiwan dollars for any of the following unlawful U-turn:
# Making a U-turn on a curve, a slope, a narrow road, a narrow bridge, or a tunnel.
# Making a U-turn at a road segment signed No U-turn or painted double solid yellow or white lines or no-overtaking lines.
# Making a U-turn at a road segment prohibiting left turn.
# Not surrounding a roundabout to make a U-turn in such an intersection.
# Before making a U-turn, failing to stop or signal left turn as required, or making a U-turn without paying attention to vehicles or pedestrians passing by.

In addition, a Taiwanese driver license is demerited one point for an unlawful U-turn pursuant to Article 63 of the same Act unless the license has been suspended or revoked. Furthermore, the same Act makes a U-turn on a railway level crossing a violation for drivers of motorized and non-motorized vehicles:
* Article 54: A driver of a motor vehicle shall be administratively fined 6000 to 12000 new Taiwan dollars for making a U-turn on a railway level crossing. Should an accident occur, the driver license shall also be revoked, which is &quot;for life&quot; pursuant to Article 67. This lifetime revocation used to be absolute, but the amendment of the law proclaimed on 28 December 2005 and effective on 1 July 2006 has allowed a possible waiver after serving at least six years of the revocation.
* Article 75: A driver of a non-motorized vehicle (e.g. a bicycle) shall be administratively fined 1200 to 2400 New Taiwan dollars for making a U-turn on a railway level crossing.

<text>The 110th Street station is a local station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located in East Harlem at the intersection of 110th Street and Lexington Avenue, it is served by the train at all times, the &lt;6&gt; train during weekdays in the peak direction, and the train during late nights.

This station was constructed as part of the Dual Contracts by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and opened in 1918. It was renovated from 2002 to 2004, and further renovations are planned to add elevators, making the station compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

==History==
===Construction and opening===
Following the completion of the original subway, there were plans to construct a line along Manhattan&#x27;s east side north of 42nd Street. The original plan for what became the extension north of 42nd Street was to continue it south through Irving Place and into what is now the BMT Broadway Line at Ninth Street and Broadway. In July 1911, the IRT had withdrawn from the talks, and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) was to operate on Lexington Avenue. The IRT submitted an offer for what became its portion of the Dual Contracts on February 27, 1912.

In 1913, as part of the Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, the Public Service Commission planned to split the original Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) system from looking like a &quot;Z&quot; system (as seen on a map) to an H-shaped system. The original system would be split into three segments: two north–south lines, carrying through trains over the Lexington Avenue and Broadway–Seventh Avenue Lines, and a west–east shuttle under 42nd Street. This would form a roughly H-shaped system. It was predicted that the subway extension would lead to the growth of the Upper East Side and the Bronx.

The 110th Street station opened on July 17, 1918, with service initially running between Grand Central–42nd Street and 167th Street via the line&#x27;s local tracks. On August 1, the &quot;H system&quot; was put into place, with through service beginning on the new east and west side trunk lines, and the institution of the 42nd Street Shuttle along the old connection between the sides. The cost of the extension from Grand Central was $58 million.

===Later years===
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940.

On March 20, 1991, a woman was raped behind a pile of debris in the subway passageway connecting the 34th Street–Herald Square and 42nd Street–Bryant Park stations under Sixth Avenue during rush hour, which had entrances at 38th Street. This was the longest passageway in the system. That passageway was closed the day after and recorded 30 felonies since January 1, 1990. In response, on March 28, 1991, the NYCTA ordered the closing of the 15 most dangerous passageways in the system within a week, which the Transit Police and citizen advocacy groups had called for since the previous year. The locations were chosen based on crime volume, lighting, traffic and physical layout. These entrances were closed under the declaration of a public safety emergency, and were blocked off with plywood and fencing until public hearings were held and official permission was obtained. One of the stations that had an entrance closed was 110th Street, which has the exit-only staircase at 111th Street from the northbound platform closed. 52 felonies had occurred at the station since January 1, 1990. The entrance was permanently closed in 1992, following a public hearing.

In June 2002, it was announced that 110th Street would be one of ten subway stations citywide to receive renovations. Work on these ten renovation projects was estimated to cost almost $146 million, and was scheduled to start later that year, and be completed in April 2004. The renovation projects made repairs to platforms, replaced or refurbished stairways, installed new lighting and tiles, and reconfigured fare control areas.

In May 2018, New York City Transit Authority President Andy Byford announced his plan subway and bus modernization plan, known as Fast Forward, which included making an additional 50 stations compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 during the 2020–2024 Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Capital Program to allow most riders to have an accessible station every two or three stops. The draft 2020–2024 Capital Program released in September 2019 included 66 stations that would receive ADA improvements. In December, the MTA announced that an additional twenty stations, including 110th Street, would be made ADA-accessible as part of the Capital Program. In May 2024, the Federal Transit Administration awarded the MTA $157 million for accessibility renovations at five stations, including 110th Street. The funds would be used to add elevators, signs, and public-announcement systems, as well as repair platforms and stairs, at each station. The accessibility project was to be funded by congestion pricing in New York City, but it was postponed in June 2024 after the implementation of congestion pricing was delayed.

== Station layout ==
This underground station has four tracks and two side platforms. The two center express tracks are used by the 4 and trains during daytime hours. The 6 stops here at all times, and the 4 stops here during late nights. The station is between to the north and to the south.

Both platforms have their original trim line, which has &quot;110&quot; tablets on it at regular intervals, and name tablets, which read &quot;110TH STREET&quot; in serif font.

The artwork at this station is a mosaic entitled &quot;Un Sábado en la Ciento Diez&quot; (&quot;A Saturday on 110th&quot;), by Manuel Vega in 1996.

===Exits===
Each platform has one same-level fare control area at the center. Each one has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The ones on the southbound platform go up to either western corners of Lexington Avenue and 110th Street, while the ones on the northbound platform go up to either eastern corners. There are no crossovers or crossunders to allow a free transfer between directions. Both platforms used to have second exits at their northern ends to 111th Street. The entrance on the northbound platform to the southeastern corner of 111th Street and Lexington Avenue was closed due to safety reasons in 1992 and was subsequently slabbed over. The only evidence of this exit is a steel door in the wall. The entrance on the northbound platform closed some time before 1992.

<text>NetBus or Netbus is a software program for remotely controlling a Microsoft Windows computer system over a network. It was created in 1998 and has been very controversial for its potential to be used as a trojan horse.

NetBus was written in Delphi by Carl-Fredrik Neikter, a Swedish programmer in March 1998. It was in wide circulation before Back Orifice was released, in August 1998. The author claimed that the program was meant to be used for pranks, not for illegally breaking into computer systems. Translated from Swedish, the name means &quot;NetPrank&quot;.

However, use of NetBus has had serious consequences. In 1999, NetBus was used to plant child pornography on the work computer of a law scholar at Lund University. The 3,500 images were discovered by system administrators, and the law scholar was assumed to have downloaded them knowingly. He lost his research position at the faculty, and following the publication of his name fled the country and had to seek professional medical care to cope with the stress. He was acquitted of criminal charges in late 2004, as a court found that NetBus had been used to control his computer.

There are two components to the client–server architecture. The server must be installed and run on the computer that should be remotely controlled. It was an .exe file with a file size of almost 500 KB. The name and icon varied a lot from version to version. Common names were &quot;Patch.exe&quot; and &quot;SysEdit.exe&quot;. When started for the first time, the server would install itself on the host computer, including modifying the Windows registry so that it starts automatically on each system startup. The server is a faceless process listening for connections on port 12345 (in some versions, the port number can be adjusted). Port 12346 is used for some tasks, as well as port 20034.

The client was a separate program presenting a graphical user interface that allowed the user to perform a number of activities on the remote computer. Examples of its capabilities:
* Keystroke logging
* Keystroke injection
* Screen captures
* Program launching
* File browsing
* Shutting down the system
* Opening / closing CD-tray
* Tunneling protocol (NetBus connections through a number of systems.)

The NetBus client was designed to support the following operating system versions:
* Windows 95
* Windows 98
* Windows ME
* Windows NT 4.0

Netbus client (v1.70) works fine in Windows 2000 and in Windows XP as well. Major parts of the protocol, used between the client and server interactions (in version 1.70) are textual.

NetBus 2.0 Pro was released in February 1999. It was marketed commercially as a powerful remote administration tool. It was less stealthy, but special hacked versions exist that make it possible to use it for illegal purposes.

All versions of the program were widely used by &quot;script kiddies&quot; and were popularized by the release of Back Orifice. Because of its smaller size, Back Orifice can be used to gain some access to a machine. The attacker can then use Back Orifice to install the NetBus server on the target computer. Most anti-virus programs detect and remove NetBus.

<text>The 116th Street station is a local station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Lexington Avenue and 116th Street in East Harlem, it is served by the train at all times, the &lt;6&gt; train during weekdays in the peak direction, and the train during late nights.

This station was constructed as part of the Dual Contracts by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and opened in 1918. It was renovated in 2003.

== History ==
===Construction and opening===

Following the completion of the original subway, there were plans to construct a line along Manhattan&#x27;s east side north of 42nd Street. The original plan for what became the extension north of 42nd Street was to continue it south through Irving Place and into what is now the BMT Broadway Line at Ninth Street and Broadway. In July 1911, the IRT had withdrawn from the talks, and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) was to operate on Lexington Avenue. The IRT submitted an offer for what became its portion of the Dual Contracts on February 27, 1912.

In 1913, as part of the Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, the Public Service Commission planned to split the original Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) system from looking like a &quot;Z&quot; system (as seen on a map) to an H-shaped system. The original system would be split into three segments: two north–south lines, carrying through trains over the Lexington Avenue and Broadway–Seventh Avenue Lines, and a west–east shuttle under 42nd Street. This would form a roughly H-shaped system. It was predicted that the subway extension would lead to the growth of the Upper East Side and the Bronx.

The 116th Street station opened on July 17, 1918, with service initially running between Grand Central–42nd Street and 167th Street via the line&#x27;s local tracks. On August 1, the &quot;H system&quot; was put into place, with through service beginning on the new east and west side trunk lines, and the institution of the 42nd Street Shuttle along the old connection between the sides. The cost of the extension from Grand Central was $58 million.

===Later years===
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940.

This station was renovated in 2003, along with the 77th Street and 86th Street stations on the Lexington Avenue Line. As part of the project, structural deficiencies were repaired, signage and lighting were enhanced, electrical service was upgraded, station facilities were rehabilitated, new fare arrays and a new token booth were installed, and portions of the station were upgraded to be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. In addition, visual clutter was eliminated, and artwork was installed. The contract for the station renovation project, which was expected to take two year, was expected to be advertised in October 2000. The contract for these three stations was awarded in October 2001, and the projects were done in-house. The cost of the work at 116th Street station was $15.5 million, of which $12.3 million came from the Federal government.

== Station layout ==

This underground station has two tracks and two side platforms, and serves local trains only. The two express tracks pass underneath on a lower level and are not visible from the platforms. The 6 stops here at all times, and the 4 stops here during late nights. The station is between to the north and to the south.

Fare control is at platform level, and no crossover or crossunder is provided. The station has standard IRT number and station name tiles. Both platforms have emergency exits from the lower level express tracks.

===Exits===
This station has staircases that lead out to the four corners of the intersection of 116th Street and Lexington Avenue. Staircases on the western corners serve the southbound platform, while those on the eastern corners serve the northbound platform.

<text>Daniel Victor Snaith (born 29 March 1978) is a Canadian composer, musician, and recording artist. He has released 11 studio albums since 2000 and has recorded and performed under the stage names Caribou, Manitoba, and Daphni. His Caribou album &quot;Andorra&quot; (2008) was awarded the 2008 Polaris Music Prize, and his Caribou album &quot;Swim&quot; (2010) was a shortlisted nominee for the 2010 Polaris Music Prize and was named the Best Album of 2010 by &quot;Resident Advisor&quot;. His follow-up &quot;Our Love&quot; (2014) was also shortlisted for the 2015 Polaris Music Prize and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album.

During live Caribou performances, Snaith is joined by his longtime bandmates, Ryan Smith (guitar, keyboards), John Schmersal (bass, keyboards) and Brad Weber (drums), who expand upon Snaith&#x27;s material for a live environment. Regarding their performances as a four-piece, Snaith has stated: &quot;The whole idea is it’s not just me, and it’s not just hired guns. The live show is its own thing and they’re a proper band – in the sense that we’re all equally part of it.&quot;

== Career ==
Snaith originally recorded under the stage name Manitoba; however, after being threatened with a lawsuit by Richard &quot;Handsome Dick&quot; Manitoba in 2004, Snaith changed his performance name to Caribou. Snaith&#x27;s previous full-length albums were then re-released under the new moniker.

When playing gigs as Caribou, Snaith performs with a live band. Currently, the live band consists of Snaith, Ryan Smith, Brad Weber, and John Schmersal. Caribou have toured worldwide since the early 2000s. The band has performed at festivals including Coachella, Glastonbury, Primavera Sound, Field Day, Bonnaroo, All Points East, Reading and Leeds, Parklife, Osheaga, amongst many others. In 2012, Caribou supported Radiohead on their ‘King of Limbs’ tour. When performing as Daphni, Snaith performs as a DJ. &quot;I&#x27;m not the type of person who takes physical things apart and plays around with them, but I like taking mental ideas apart and playing around with them. That&#x27;s what appeals to me about what I&#x27;ve spent my life doing&quot;, said Snaith in an interview. 

Caribou&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Andorra&quot; won the 2008 Polaris Music Prize, and his subsequent Caribou albums Swim (2010), Our Love (2014) and Suddenly (2020) have appeared on the Polaris Music Prize shortlist.

In 2011, looking for an outlet for more dancefloor influenced output, he began releasing music under the name Daphni, which included three studio albums: Jiaolong (2012), Joli Mai (2017) and &quot;Cherry&quot; (2022). 

In December 2011, Caribou curated the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties &quot;Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; festival in Minehead, England, alongside co-curators Battles and Les Savy Fav.

Caribou was awarded Essential Mix of the Year in 2014 by &quot;Mixmag&quot; for his &quot;Essential Mix&quot; on 18 October 2014.

Caribou&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;Our Love&quot; received the IMPALA Album of the Year Award.

In 2015, Caribou’s album &quot;Our Love&quot; was nominated for a Grammy for ‘Best Electronic/Dance Album’ and in 2021 Caribou’s single ‘You Can Do it&#x27; was nominated for the Grammy for ‘Best Dance Recording’.

In 2011, 2015 and 2021, Caribou’s albums Swim, Our Love and Suddenly won the Juno Award for Electronic Album of the Year.

In 2021, he also received the Libera Awards as Best Dance/Electric Record 2021 for his album &quot;Suddenly&quot; (Merge Records) by the American Association of Independent Music (A2IM).

In 2024, he released his 8th studio album as Caribou, Honey.

==Personal life==
In 2005, Snaith received a PhD degree in mathematics from Imperial College London, for work on &quot;Overconvergent Siegel Modular Symbols&quot; under Kevin Buzzard. Snaith described his work ironically in a modest manner as &quot;original, but I would still call it trivial.&quot;
He is the son of mathematician and brother of mathematician Nina Snaith.

<doc id="728991" wikidata="Q2566588" url="?curid=728991" title="125th Street station (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)">
<text>The 125th Street station is an express station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at Lexington Avenue and East 125th Street (also known as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard) in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, it is served by the 4 and 6 trains at all times, the 5 train at all times except late nights, and the &lt;6&gt; train during weekdays in peak direction. The station contains four tracks and two island platforms split across two levels. The upper level is used by northbound trains to the Bronx, while the lower level is used by southbound trains to Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn.

This station was constructed as part of the Dual Contracts by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and opened in 1918. A planned northern extension of the Second Avenue Subway, once built, will connect with this station and with the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem–125th Street station, located one block west.

== History ==
===Construction and opening===
Following the completion of the original subway, there were plans to construct a line along Manhattan&#x27;s east side north of 42nd Street. The original plan for what became the extension north of 42nd Street was to continue it south through Irving Place and into what is now the BMT Broadway Line at Ninth Street and Broadway. In July 1911, the IRT had withdrawn from the talks, and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) was to operate on Lexington Avenue. The IRT submitted an offer for what became its portion of the Dual Contracts on February 27, 1912.

In May 1912, it was decided to modify the planned layout of the station from three tracks and two island platforms on each level, to two tracks and one island platform per level, saving $1.25 million.

In 1913, as part of the Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, the Public Service Commission planned to split the original Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) system from looking like a &quot;Z&quot; system (as seen on a map) to an H-shaped system. The original system would be split into three segments: two north–south lines, carrying through trains over the Lexington Avenue and Broadway–Seventh Avenue Lines, and a west–east shuttle under 42nd Street. This would form a roughly H-shaped system. It was predicted that the subway extension would lead to the growth of the Upper East Side and the Bronx.

The 125th Street station opened on July 17, 1918, as part of the extension of the original subway up Lexington Avenue to 125th Street and into the Bronx. Initially, service was provided only as a shuttle on the local tracks of the Lexington Avenue Line starting at Grand Central, continuing past this station and under the Harlem River to 167th Street on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line. On August 1, the &quot;H system&quot; was put into place, with through service beginning on the new east and west side trunk lines, and the institution of the 42nd Street Shuttle along the old connection between the sides. Express service began on this date. The cost of the extension from Grand Central was $58 million.

The opening of this station resulted in development of the surrounding neighborhood of East Harlem.

===Later years===
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. In 1952 or 1953, a public address system was installed at this station, providing information to passengers and train crews.

In late 1959, contracts were awarded to extend the platforms at Bowling Green, Wall Street, Fulton Street, Canal Street, Spring Street, Bleecker Street, Astor Place, Grand Central, 86th Street and 125th Street to to accommodate ten-car trains.

In 1981, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system. The station&#x27;s elevators were installed in November 1989, making the station one of the earliest to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. This station was renovated in 2005.

In July 2023, as part of a pilot program to deter assaults on New York City Transit staff, the MTA painted &quot;no standing zones&quot; on the 125th Street station&#x27;s platforms near the centers of each train.


== Station layout ==
The station is unusual in design for an IRT station, being a bi-level station with island platforms. The 4 and 6 trains stop here at all times; the 5 train stops here at all times except late nights; and the &lt;6&gt; train stops here during weekdays in the peak direction. The 5 train always makes express stops, and the 6 and &lt;6&gt; trains always make local stops; the 4 train makes express stops during the day and local stops at night.

Unlike at other bilevel express stations on an IRT line, the tracks are not grouped so that express and local trains are on different levels. Instead, the upper platform serves northbound (uptown) trains and the lower level serves southbound (downtown) trains. Adding to the unusual design is the local track on each level having train doors open to the right; the express tracks likewise have doors opening to the left. North of the station, just after crossing the Harlem River, the line splits into the IRT Jerome Avenue Line (heading north) and the IRT Pelham Line (heading east). On the lower platform, each track comes from one line, and a flying junction south of the station allows trains to be diverted to the local or express track. The next station to the north is for trains on the Pelham Line, for afternoon trains, and for trains on the Jerome Avenue Line. The next station to the south is for local trains and for express trains.

Throughout the station&#x27;s history, this station has been one of the more important on the line as it is the northernmost transfer point between express trains to the IRT Jerome Avenue and White Plains Road Lines, and local trains to the IRT Pelham Line. There is an active tower at the north end of the upper platform; it is a satellite to the tower at Grand Central–42nd Street, which controls the entire length of the Lexington Avenue Line.

===Exits===
This station has a mezzanine with two separate turnstile banks. The northern turnstile bank leads to two staircases going to both northern corners of Lexington Avenue and 125th Street, and an elevator going to the northeastern corner of Lexington Avenue and 125th Street. The southern turnstile bank has two exits leading to both southern corners of Lexington Avenue and 125th Street.

A fifth entrance will be built as part of the proposed Second Avenue Subway station here. It would be located on the southern side of 125th Street in the median of Park Avenue, and an ancillary facility would be located one block south. The proposed fifth exit is right underneath Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem–125th Street station on Park Avenue, which is one block west of the Lexington Avenue exits. An ancillary facility would also be built at the southeast corner of 125th Street and Third Avenue.

== Planned Second Avenue Subway station ==
Harlem–125th Street is the planned northern terminal for Phase 2 of the Second Avenue Subway. It would be built underneath 125th Street, below and perpendicular to the existing Lexington Avenue Line station. Phase 2 would stretch from 96th Street to 125th Street, with the next stations south being 116th Street and 106th Street. When opened, it will initially be served by the Q train, with the T providing service when phase 3 of the line is built.

=== Introduction of the station to plans ===
A station at Lexington Avenue and 125th Street was not on the original Second Avenue Subway proposed as part of the New York City Transit Authority&#x27;s 1968 Program for Action; instead, a Second Avenue Subway station would be built at 126th Street and Second Avenue. The line was to be built in two phases—the first phase from 126th to 34th Streets, the second phase from 34th to Whitehall Streets.

In March 2007, plans for the construction of the Second Avenue Subway were revived. The line&#x27;s first phase, the &quot;first major expansion&quot; to the New York City Subway in more than a half-century, included three stations in total and cost $4.45 to $4.5 billion, spanning from 105th Street and Second Avenue to 63rd Street and Third Avenue. Phase 1 opened on January 1, 2017, with the line&#x27;s northern terminal at 96th Street.

The second phase, between 125th and 96th Streets, was allocated $525 million in the MTA&#x27;s 2015–2019 Capital Plan for planning, design, environmental studies, and utility relocation. This phase will complete the project&#x27;s East Harlem section. The alignment will run under Second Avenue to 124th Street, before turning west on 125th Street. On October 18, 2016, the de Blasio administration announced a rezoning plan for East Harlem. One of the three Special Transit Land Use (TA) districts is for the area of the 125th Street station.

On November 21, 2016, the MTA requested that the Phase 2 project be entered into the Project Development phase under the Federal Transit Administration&#x27;s New Starts program. On December 15, several elected officials for the area announced that they were seeking $6 billion of funding for Phase 2 of the line, including $2 billion from the federal government. These officials wished to secure funding from the presidential administration of Barack Obama before Obama&#x27;s term ended on January 20, 2017. In their request for funding, they cited that they wanted to avoid an uncertain response from the first administration of Donald Trump and start construction on Phase 2 as soon as possible. The FTA granted this request in late December 2016. Under the approved plan, the MTA would complete an environmental reevaluation by 2018, receive funding by 2020, and open Phase 2 between 2027 and 2029. In January 2017, it was announced that Phases 2 and 3, which are expected to cost up to a combined $14.2 billion, were on the Trump administration&#x27;s priority list of 50 most important transportation projects nationwide.

===Current plans===
In July 2018, the MTA released a supplemental environmental assessment for Phase 2 of the Second Avenue Subway. The updated report indicated that the 125th Street station would be relocated about west and below what had been proposed in the 2004 FEIS, in order to reduce impacts on nearby buildings. The proposed three-track station was reduced to two tracks. The modification would reduce flexibility, but would allow the section under 125th Street to be mined, rather than being constructed as cut-and-cover, thereby reducing impacts on nearby buildings. Simulations showed that a two-track layout could support the same level of service that the three-track layout could have provided: 28 trains per hour. To make up for the loss of the track, the tail tracks west of the station would be lengthened.

When built, this platform will be the northern terminal of the Second Avenue Subway. It will be five levels below street level, or two levels below the lower-level IRT Lexington Avenue Line platform. The station was originally proposed to have a three-track, two-island platform layout with a mezzanine above it and switches to the east of the platforms. The July 2018 plans call for two tracks and one island platform, with switches both to the west and the east. The tail tracks would extend to Lenox Avenue to allow for six trains to be stored, three per track. This would also provide a provision for a future expansion of the line along 125th Street.

Extra transfer capacity to the existing Lexington Avenue Line station would be provided as part of the construction of the Harlem–125th Street terminal. In its July 2018 supplemental report, the MTA indicated that it wanted to build new escalator entrances to the subway station complex on two of the corners at Lexington Avenue and 125th Street, replacing the existing entrances there. Entrance 1 would be located on the southeast corner, while entrance 2 would tentatively be located on the northwest corner, although this has yet to be confirmed. The original 2004 plans had called for entrance 2 to be located on the southwest corner, but the MTA stated that the location was comparatively small. The Second Avenue Subway station will include a new exit leading directly from the Second Avenue Line platform to the median of Park Avenue at the south side of 125th Street, allowing for a quick connection to the Metro-North station. In the 2018 report, the MTA stated that it also wanted to include a property on the intersection&#x27;s southeast corner within the construction site. The ancillaries were also shifted from the locations proposed in the 2004 FEIS. Ancillary 1 and Ancillary 2, which were respectively supposed to be located at Third and Park Avenues on 125th Street, were both moved south to 124th Street. The ancillary buildings were also shifted west because the station cavern had been relocated west.

===Second Avenue Subway Community Information Center===
A Second Avenue Subway Community Information Center for Phase 2, along 125th Street between Park and Madison Avenues, was originally planned to open in May 2017. The center&#x27;s opening was delayed to September 18, 2017.

==Media==
The station is mentioned by Lou Reed in his 1967 song &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting for the Man&quot;, performed with The Velvet Underground, in which he describes traveling to Harlem to purchase heroin: &quot;Up to Lexington / One-two-five / Feeling sick and dirty / More dead than alive.&quot;

<text>Wilhelm Johann Eugen Blaschke (13 September 1885 – 17 March 1962) was an Austrian mathematician working in the fields of differential and integral geometry.

==Education and career==
Blaschke was the son of mathematician Josef Blaschke, who taught geometry at the Landes Oberrealschule in Graz.
After studying for two years at the Technische Hochschule in Graz, he went to the University of Vienna, and completed a doctorate in 1908 under the supervision of Wilhelm Wirtinger. His dissertation was &quot;Über eine besondere Art von Kurven vierter Klasse&quot;.

After completing his doctorate he spent several years visiting mathematicians at the major universities in Italy and Germany. He spent two years each in positions in Prague, Leipzig, Göttingen, and Tübingen until, in 1919, he took the professorship at the University of Hamburg that he would keep for the rest of his career. His students at Hamburg included Shiing-Shen Chern, Luis Santaló, and Emanuel Sperner.

In 1933 Blaschke signed the &quot;Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State&quot;. However, he defended Kurt Reidemeister against the Nazis and, in the early 1930s, campaigned against Ludwig Bieberbach for leadership of the German Mathematical Society, arguing that the society should remain international and apolitical in opposition to Bieberbach&#x27;s wish to &quot;enforce Nazi policies on German mathematics and race&quot;. However, by 1936 he was supporting Nazi policies, called himself &quot;a Nazi at Heart&quot;, and was described by colleagues as &quot;Mussolinetto&quot; for his fascist beliefs. He officially joined the Nazi Party in 1937.

After the war, Blaschke was removed from his position at the University of Hamburg for his Nazi affiliation, but after an appeal his professorship was restored in 1946. He remained at the university until his retirement in 1953.

==Publications==
In 1916 Blaschke published one of the first books devoted to convex sets: &quot;Circle and Sphere&quot; (&quot;Kreis und Kugel&quot;). Drawing on dozens of sources, Blaschke made a thorough review of the subject with citations within the text to attribute credit in a classical area of mathematics.

<doc id="728999" wikidata="Q7159134" url="?curid=728999" title="Pedernales River">
<text>The Pedernales River ( ) is a tributary of the Colorado River, approximately long, in Central Texas in the United States. It drains an area of the Edwards Plateau, flowing west to east across the Texas Hill Country west of Austin. The name &quot;Pedernales&quot;, first used in the middle 18th century, comes from a Spanish word for the flint rocks characteristic of the riverbed.

==Description==
The river rises from springs in northeastern Kerr County, approximately southeast of Junction. It flows north into southeast Kimble County and then east into Gillespie County, passing south of Fredericksburg, and into Blanco County, passing north of Johnson City. It joins the Colorado from the southwest in Lake Travis, approximately west of Austin.

The river has a close association with the Texas Hill Country, tied to the history of the region and emblematic of its geography. Along its route it flows over numerous rugged limestone escarpments as it winds eastward, passing along the south side of the ranch of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who grew up in nearby Stonewall, south of the river.

In 1750, Fray Benito Fernández de Santa Ana proposed a plan to the Spanish government that a mission be established among the Lipan Apache who lived along the river. In 1789, the river was the site of a skirmish between Colonel Francisco Xavier Ugalde and a group of Lipan and Mescalero Indians. The first permanent white settlement along the river was in 1846, when the town of Fredericksburg was established by German immigrants. The threat of raids from Apaches restricted settlement in the area until the 1880s.

Pedernales Falls State Park is located along the river in Blanco County east of Johnson City. Like many rivers in central Texas, it is prone to variable water levels. A sign at the state park shows a relatively tranquil river in one picture and a raging wall of muddy water in the next picture, said to be taken only five minutes after the first. The speed at which flash floods can arise along this river has resulted in several deaths at the park, and warning sirens have been installed in the park and elsewhere along the river. The lower river is a popular destination for whitewater rafting during the high-water season.

<text>The Brook Avenue station is a local station on the IRT Pelham Line of the New York City Subway. It is served by the 6 train at all times and is located at Brook Avenue and East 138th Street in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx. The station opened in 1919 as part of an extension of the Pelham Line of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, and had its platforms extended in the 1960s. The station is slated to undergo renovations to become compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

== History ==
This station opened on January 7, 1919 with the extension of the Pelham Line from Third Avenue–138th Street to Hunts Point Avenue by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company.

In 1951, the MTA proposed building a transfer from the IRT Pelham Line to the IND Second Avenue Line at Brook Avenue, though that was never built. Instead, both platforms were extended at either ends in the 1960s to accommodate the current standard length of an IRT train (). The extensions are noticeable as they are narrower than the rest of the platforms and have no columns. The extensions result in the platforms being slightly offset.

In 1981, the MTA listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system. Under the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Plan, the station, along with thirty other New York City Subway stations, will undergo a complete overhaul and would be entirely closed for up to 6 months. Updates would include cellular service, Wi-Fi, charging stations, improved signage, and improved station lighting. However, these renovations are being deferred until the 2020–2024 Capital Program due to a lack of funding. In 2019, the MTA announced that this station would become ADA-accessible as part of the agency&#x27;s 2020–2024 Capital Program. The renovation of the station was to be funded by congestion pricing in New York City, but the renovation was postponed in June 2024 after the implementation of congestion pricing was delayed.

==Station layout==

This underground station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center express track is used by the weekday peak direction &lt;6&gt; service. The 6 local train serves the station at all times. The next stop to the south is Third Avenue–138th Street, while the next stop to the north is Cypress Avenue.

Both platforms have their original Dual Contracts mosaic trim line and name tablets. The trim line has a geometric Vickers design of brightly colored diamonds in blue and green, bordered by scarlet red and yellow-ochre bands, as well as alternating &quot;B&quot; and concentric diamond plaques at regular intervals. The name tablets read &quot;BROOK AVE.&quot; in white seriffed lettering on a blue background and yellow-ochre border. Some of the tablets themselves, and sections of the trim line on both sides have been replaced in recent years with historically accurate replicas. Dark yellow I-beam columns run along the original portion of the platforms at regular intervals, alternating ones having the standard black name plate with white lettering.

There are no crossovers or crossunders to allow free transfers between directions.

===Exits===
Both platforms have one same-level fare control area at the center. Each one has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The ones on the Pelham Bay Park-bound platform go up to either southern corners of Brook Avenue and East 138th Street while the ones on the Manhattan-bound platform go up to either northern corners.

<doc id="729001" wikidata="Q5459640" url="?curid=729001" title="Flip-flop (politics)">
<text>A &quot;flip-flop&quot; (used mostly in the United States), U-turn (used in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Pakistan, Malaysia, etc.), or backflip (used in Australia and New Zealand) is a derogatory term for a sudden real or apparent change of policy or opinion by a public official, sometimes while trying to claim that the two positions are consistent with each other. It carries connotations of pandering and hypocrisy. Often, flip-flops occur during the period prior to or following an election in order to maximize the candidate&#x27;s popularity.

==History==

In his &quot;On Language&quot; column in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, William Safire wrote in 1988 that &quot;flip-flop&quot; has a long history as a synonym for &quot;somersault&quot;. (He cited George Lorimer in 1902: &quot;when a fellow&#x27;s turning flip-flops up among the clouds, he&#x27;s naturally going to have the farmers gaping at him&quot;.) In the late 19th century, a US politician was called &quot;the Florida flopper&quot; by an opponent, Safire noted. The &quot;fl&quot; sound appearing twice is an indication of ridicule, he wrote. Citing grammarian Randolph Quirk, Safire pointed out that the doubling of the sound is also a feature in other two-word phrases used to disparage the actions or words of others, including &quot;mumbo jumbo&quot;, &quot;wishy-washy&quot;, and &quot;higgledy-piggledy&quot;.

In the archives of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which go back to 1851, the earliest unequivocal mention of &quot;flip-flop&quot; as a change in someone&#x27;s opinion is in an October 23, 1890 report of a campaign speech in New York City. John W. Goff, candidate for district attorney, said of one of his opponents: &quot;I would like to hear Mr. Nicoll explain his great flip-flop, for three years ago, you know, as the Republican candidate for District Attorney, he bitterly denounced Tammany as a party run by bosses and in the interest of bossism. ... Nicoll, who three years ago was denouncing Tammany, is its candidate to-day.&quot;

The term was also used in 1967, when a &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial and &quot;Times&quot; columnist Tom Wicker used it in commenting on different events. It was also in the 1976 election, when President Gerald Ford used the phrase against his opponent Jimmy Carter. In the 1988 U.S. presidential election, Michael Dukakis used the term against opponent Richard Gephardt, saying, &quot;There&#x27;s a flip-flopper over here&quot; about Gephardt.

The term also was used extensively in the 2004 U.S. presidential election campaign. It was used by critics as a catch-phrase attack on John Kerry, claiming he was &quot;flip-flopping&quot; his stance on several issues, including the ongoing war in Iraq. Famously, on March 16, 2004, during an appearance at Marshall University Kerry tried to explain his vote for an $87 billion supplemental appropriation for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan by telling the crowd, &quot;I actually did vote for the $87 billion, before I voted against it.&quot; After the remark became controversial, he explained that he had supported an earlier Democratic measure that would have paid for the $87 billion in war funding by reducing Bush&#x27;s tax cuts.

FactCheck stated that &quot;Kerry has never wavered from his support for giving Bush authority to use force in Iraq, nor has he changed his position that he, as President, would not have gone to war without greater international support.&quot;

The term &quot;U-turn&quot; in the United Kingdom was famously applied to Edward Heath, the prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1970 to 1974. Prior to the 1970 general election, the Conservative Party compiled a manifesto that highlighted free-market economic policies. Heath abandoned such policies when his government nationalised Rolls-Royce (hence the actual &quot;U-turn&quot;). The Conservative government was later attacked for such a move because nationalisation was seen (by the Thatcher era) as antithetical to Conservative beliefs. This later led to one of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s most famous phrases: &quot;you turn [U-turn] if you want to. The lady&#x27;s not for turning.&quot; The Conservatives would adopt the free market under her.

The term has been used repeatedly by libertarian leaning &quot;Reason&quot; magazine to describe politician Kamala Harris related to her on-and-off-again support of a so called &quot;medicare-for-all&quot; policy within the United States, as well as Harris&#x27; &quot;...running away from her far-left past...&quot;, &quot;Reason&quot; has also criticized Joe Biden as an inconsistent and politically untrustworthy political figure labeled a &quot;flip flopper&quot;. In regard to Biden, &quot;Reason&quot; said his &quot;Final Flip-Flop&quot; of ultimately deciding to drop out of running for president in the 2024 race, marked, &quot;...a pattern established by a long career of politically convenient reversals.&quot;

==Influence on public==

The circumstances surrounding the flip-flop and its larger context can be crucial factors in whether or not a politician is hurt or helped more by a change in position. &quot;Long hailed as a conservative champion, Ronald Reagan could shrug off his support of a tax increase in 1982 to curb the budget deficits his 1981 tax cut had exacerbated&quot;, according to an analysis of flip-flopping in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;Long suspect on the Republican right, George [H. W.] Bush faced a crippling 1992 primary challenge after abandoning his &#x27;no new taxes&#x27; campaign pledge in the White House.&quot;

Kerry&#x27;s perceived equivocation on the Iraq war damaged his 2004 campaign, according to both Democratic and Republican political operatives. &quot;It spoke to a pattern of calculation and indecisiveness that make him look like a weak commander in chief compared to [George W.] Bush&quot;, said Jonathan Prince, a strategist for 2008 presidential candidate John Edwards, Kerry&#x27;s running mate in 2004. In the 2008 primary season, Edwards simply stated that &quot;I was wrong&quot; when he had voted in the U.S. Senate to authorize the Iraq War. &quot;Progressives loved it because it was taking responsibility, not abdicating it&quot;, according to Prince.

United States commentator Jim Geraghty has written that politicians need to be allowed some leeway in changing their minds as the result of changing conditions. &quot;I actually think that a candidate can even change his position in response to a changing political environment, as long as they&#x27;re honest about it. &#x27;The votes just aren&#x27;t there, public support isn&#x27;t there, so I have to put this proposal on the back burner for a while&#x27;, is a perfectly legitimate response to a difficult position.&quot; The same general point was made in 1988 by &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial columnist Tom Wicker, writing shortly after Dukakis&#x27; charge against Gephardt. Wicker commented that the accusation was not necessarily fair: &quot;What&#x27;s wrong with a Presidential candidate changing his position – though his opponents call it &#x27;flip-flopping&#x27; – in order to improve his chances of winning? Nothing&#x27;s wrong with it ... unless the flipper ... denies having done it.&quot; Wicker added that the charge can be &quot;a tortured or dishonest interpretation of an opponent&#x27;s record&quot;.

&quot;[T]here&#x27;s a difference between changing your policy position and breaking a promise,&quot; John Dickerson, wrote in &quot;Slate&quot; online magazine. &quot;Breaking a promise is a problem of a higher order than changing a policy position. Our mothers told us not to break promises&quot;.

James Pethokoukis, the &quot;money and politics blogger&quot; for &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; online, referring to 2008 presidential candidate John McCain, noted that in changing a position a candidate can &quot;trot out that famous John Maynard Keynes line, &#x27;When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir? The Keynes quote also has been mentioned by other commentators with regard to flip-flops, including James Broder, in a 2007 article in the &quot;International Herald-Tribune&quot;.

==Non-political use==
Outside politics the use of the term is not as pejorative. A scientist or mathematician can often obtain some experimental results or logical proofs which causes one to change a previously held belief. Lewis Eigen, in his essay on the cultural difference between politics and scientists, observes, &quot;To the scientist, failure to flip-flop in the face of contradictory evidence is irrational and dangerous behavior.&quot;

<text>The Cypress Avenue station is a local station on the IRT Pelham Line of the New York City Subway. It is served by the 6 train at all times and is located at the intersection of Cypress Avenue and East 138th Street in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx. The station opened in 1919 as part of an extension of the Pelham Line of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, and had its platforms extended in the 1960s.

== History ==
This station opened on January 7, 1919, as part of the extension of the Pelham Line from Third Avenue–138th Street to Hunts Point Avenue by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company as part of the Dual Contracts.

Both platforms were extended at either ends in the 1960s to accommodate the current standard length of an IRT train (). The extensions are noticeable as they are narrower than the rest of the platforms, have no columns, and the trim line is green with &quot;CYPRESS AVE&quot; in white sans serif font. The extensions result in the platforms being slightly offset.

==Station layout==
This underground station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center express track is used by the weekday peak direction &lt;6&gt; service. The 6 local train serves the station at all times. The next stop to the south is Brook Avenue, while the next stop to the north is East 143rd Street–St. Mary&#x27;s Street.

Both platforms have their original Dual Contracts mosaic trim line and name tablets. &quot;C&quot; tablets for &quot;Cypress&quot; run along the trim line at regular intervals and the name tablets have &quot;CYPRESS AVE.&quot; in serif, all-caps lettering. Dark yellow i-beam columns run along the platforms at regular intervals with every other one having the standard black name plate with white lettering.

There are no crossovers or crossunders to allow free transfers between directions. There is a closed newsstand that has been tiled over. Only the northbound platform has a station agent booth.

===Exits===
Both platforms have one same-level fare control area at the east (railroad north) end. Each one has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The ones on the Pelham Bay Park-bound platform go up to the south side of East 138th Street between Cypress and Jackson Avenues while the ones on the Manhattan-bound platform go up to the north side.

<doc id="729006" wikidata="Q1365408" url="?curid=729006" title="To be, or not to be">
<text>&quot;To be, or not to be&quot; is a speech given by Prince Hamlet in the so-called &quot;nunnery scene&quot; of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot; (Act 3, Scene 1). The speech is named for the opening phrase, itself among the most widely known and quoted lines in modern English literature, and has been referenced in many works of theatre, literature and music. 

In the speech, Hamlet contemplates death and suicide, weighing the pain and unfairness of life against the alternative, which might be worse. It is not clear that Hamlet is thinking of his own situation since the speech is entirely in an abstract, somewhat academic register that accords with Hamlet&#x27;s status as a (recent) student at Wittenberg University. Furthermore, Hamlet is not alone as he speaks because Ophelia is on stage waiting for him to see her, and Claudius and Polonius have concealed themselves to hear him. Even so, Hamlet seems to consider himself alone and there is no definite indication that the others hear him before he addresses Ophelia, so the speech is almost universally regarded as a sincere soliloquy.

==Text==
There are three main copies of Hamlet: the First Quarto, also known as the &quot;Bad Quarto&quot;, published in 1603; the Second Quarto, or &quot;Good Quarto&quot; of 1604; and the version included in the First Folio, published in 1623. These texts are commonly abbreviated Q1, Q2 and F1.

Three additional early texts are known, John Smethwick&#x27;s Q3, Q4, and Q5 (1611–37); these are regarded as reprints of Q2 with some alterations.

This version preserves most of the First Folio text with updated spelling, punctuation, and five common emendations introduced from the Second (&quot;Good&quot;) Quarto (italicised).

&lt;poem&gt;To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether &#x27;tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep
No more; and by a sleep, to say we end
The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
That Flesh is heir to? &#x27;Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,
To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there&#x27;s the rub,
For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There&#x27;s the respect
That makes Calamity of so long life:
For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of time,
The Oppressor&#x27;s wrong, the &quot;proud&quot; man&#x27;s contumely, [F: &quot;poore&quot;]
The pangs of &quot;despised&quot; Love, the law’s delay, [F: &quot; dispriz’d&quot;]
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of th&#x27;unworthy takes,
When he himself might his Quietus make
With a bare Bodkin? Who would &quot;Fardels&quot; bear, [F: &quot;these Fardels&quot;]
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscovered country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have,
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of Resolution
Is sicklied o&#x27;er, with the pale cast of Thought,
And enterprises of great &quot;pitch&quot; and moment, [F: &quot;pith&quot;]
With this regard their Currents turn &quot;awry&quot;, [F: &quot;away&quot;]
And lose the name of Action. Soft you now,
The fair Ophelia? Nymph, in thy Orisons
Be all my sins remember&#x27;d.&lt;/poem&gt;

===First Quarto (1603)===
The First Quarto is a short early text of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Though it was published in 1603, it was lost or not known until a copy was discovered in 1823. It contains a number of unique characteristics and oddities. When it was discovered, it was thought to be an earlier version than the Second Quarto, but is now considered by scholars to be derivative, or pirated and imperfectly remembered. In the version below, the spelling is updated, along with minor alterations of scansion, capitalization and punctuation.

&lt;poem&gt;To be, or not to be, Ay there&#x27;s the point,
To Die, to sleep, is that all? Aye all:
No, to sleep, to dream, aye marry there it goes,
For in that dream of death, when we awake,
And borne before an everlasting Judge,
From whence no passenger ever returned,
The undiscovered country, at whose sight
The happy smile, and the accursed damn&#x27;d.
But for this, the joyful hope of this,
Who&#x27;d bear the scorns and flattery of the world,
Scorned by the right rich, the rich cursed of the poor?
The widow being oppressed, the orphan wrong&#x27;d,
The taste of hunger, or a tyrants reign,
And thousand more calamities besides,
To grunt and sweat under this weary life,
When that he may his full Quietus make,
With a bare bodkin, who would this endure,
But for a hope of something after death?
Which puzzles the brain, and doth confound the sense,
Which makes us rather bear those evils we have,
Than fly to others that we know not of.
Aye that, O this conscience makes cowards of us all,
Lady in thy orizons, be all my sins remembered.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Second Quarto (1604)===
The text of the Second Quarto (Q2) is considered the earliest version of the play. In Q2 the whole nunnery scene including &quot;To be&quot; takes place later in the play than in Q1 where it occurs directly after Claudius and Polonius have planned it. The inclusion of &quot;Soft you now&quot;, suggests that Hamlet has not (or is feigning having not) seen Ophelia thus far during his speech.

&lt;poem&gt;To be, or not to be, that is the question,
Whether &#x27;tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outragious fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing, end them, to die to sleep
No more, and by a sleep, to say we end
The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir too; tis a consumation
Devoutly to be wish&#x27;d to die to sleep,
To sleep, perhance to dream, ay, there&#x27;s the rub,
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we haue shuffled off this mortal coil
Muſt giue vs pauſe, there&#x27;s the reſpect
That makes calamitie of ſo long life:
For who would beare the whips and ſcorns of time,
Th&#x27;oppreſſors wrong, the proude mans contumly,
The pangs of deſpiz&#x27;d loue, the lawes delay,
The inſolence of office, and the ſpurnes
That patient merrit of the&#x27;vnworthy takes,
When he himſelfe might his quietas make
With a bare bodkin; who would fardels beare,
To grunt and ſweat vnder a wearie life,
But that the dread of ſomething after death,
The vndiſcouer&#x27;d country, from whose borne
No trauiler returnes, puzzels the will,
And makes vs rather beare thoſe ills we haue,
Then flie to others we know not of.
Thus conſcience dooes make cowards,
And thus the natiue hiew of reſolution
Is ſickled ore with the pale caſt of thought,
And enterpriſes of great pitch and moment,
With this regard theyr currents turne awry,
And loose the name of action. Soft you now,
The faire &quot;Ophelia&quot;, Nimph in thy orizons
Be all my ſinnes remembred.&lt;/poem&gt;

===First Folio (1623)===
&quot;Mr. William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories, &amp; Tragedies&quot;, published by Isaac Jaggard and Ed Blount in 1623 and better known as the &quot;First Folio&quot;, includes an edition of &quot;Hamlet&quot; largely similar to the Second Quarto. The differences in &quot;To be&quot; are mostly typographic, with increased punctuation and capitalization.

&lt;poem&gt;To be, or not to be, that is the Question:
Whether ’tis Nobler in the mind to suffer
The Slings and Arrows of outragious Fortune,
Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them: to dye, to sleep
No more; and by a sleep, to say we end
The Heart-ake, and the thouſand Naturall ſhockes
That Flesh is heyre too? &#x27;Tis a consummation
Deuoutly to be wiſh&#x27;d. To dye to sleepe,
To sleep, perchance to Dream; I, there&#x27;s the rub,
For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,
When we haue ſhufflel’d off this mortall coile,
Muſt giue us pause. There&#x27;s the respect
That makes Calamity of ſo long life:
For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time,
The Oppreſſors wrong, the poore mans Contumely,
The pangs of diſpriz’d Loue, the Lawes delay,
The inſolence of Office, and the Spurnes
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himſelfe might his &quot;Quietus&quot; make
With a bare Bodkin? Who would theſe Fardles beare
To grunt and ſweat vnder a weary life,
But that the dread of ſomething after death,
The vndiſcouered Countrey, from whoſe Borne
No Traueller returnes, Puzels the will,
And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue,
Then flye to others that we know not of.
Thus Conſcience does make Cowards of vs all,
And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution
Is ſicklied o’re, with the pale caſt of Thought,
And enterprizes of great pith and moment,
With this regard their Currants turne away,
And looſe the name of Action. Soft you now,
The faire &quot;Ophelia?&quot; Nimph, in thy Orizons
Be all my ſinnes remembred.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Cultural impact==

&quot;To be, or not to be&quot; is one of the most widely known and quoted lines in modern English, and the speech has been referenced in numerous works of theatre, literature and music. The two most iconic moments in the play ― the Act III, scene 1 &quot;To be or not to be&quot; speech and the Act V, scene 1 image of Hamlet contemplating the skull of Yorick may be linked when the play is remembered, but the two moments occur in different acts of the play.

A plot point of the 1942 film comedy &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; involves the first line of the monologue. In the 1957 comedy film &quot;A King in New York&quot;, Charlie Chaplin recites the monologue in the shoes of the ambiguous King Shahdov.

Hamlet&#x27;s line is the basis of the title of Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s 1962 short story &quot;2 B R 0 2 B&quot; (the zero is pronounced &quot;nought&quot;). The narrative takes place in a dystopian future in which the United States government, through scientific advancement, has achieved a &quot;cure&quot; for both aging and overpopulation. The alphabetical/numerical reformulation of Shakespeare&#x27;s lines serves in the story as the phone number for the Federal Bureau of Termination&#x27;s assisted suicide request line.

In 1963 at a debate in Oxford, Black liberation leader Malcolm X quoted the first few lines of the speech to make a point about &quot;extremism in defense of liberty.&quot;

&quot;Last Action Hero&quot; (1993) has Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger) parody the phrase in a mock trailer of an actionized version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; before blowing up a castle behind him just by smoking a cigar. His version has him say &quot;To be, or not to be? Not to be.&quot;

&quot;Star Trek&quot; sixth film, &quot;The Undiscovered Country&quot; (1991) was named for the line from this speech, albeit the Klingon interpretation in which the title refers to the future and not death. References are made to Shakespeare during the film including Klingon translations of his works and the use of the phrase &quot;taH pagh, taHbe&#x27; &quot;, roughly meaning &quot;whether to continue, or not to continue [existence].&quot;

&quot;What Dreams May Come&quot;, the 1978 novel by Richard Matheson and its 1998 film adaptation derive their name from a line from this speech.

The 1997 film adaptation of &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; also parodies this line; when George (Brendan Fraser) sees a paraglider dangling off the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge and notices a rope on the bridge&#x27;s ledge, he quotes to the audience &quot;To swing, or not to swing&quot;? After deciding &quot;swing&quot;, George grabs the rope and swings, saving the paraglider.

The New Zealand television series &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot; takes its title from the words of the third line of the speech.

A shorter Hindi version of &quot;To be, or not to be&quot; was recited by Shahid Kapoor in the 2014 Bollywood film &quot;Haider&quot;.

&quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, the Season 4 Episode 10 named &quot;This Mortal Coil&quot; (2008) after the speech, as well as Season 4 Episode 11 named &quot;Be All My Sins Remember&#x27;d&quot; (2008). These episodes involved learning about and fighting the artificial intelligence species Replicator.

The virtuoso soliloquy in Carl Michael Bellman&#x27;s &quot;Fredman&#x27;s Epistles&quot;, &quot;Ack du min moder&quot;, was described by the poet and literary historian Oscar Levertin as &quot;the to-be-or-not-to-be of Swedish literature&quot;.

The Japanese band P-Model&#x27;s song 2D or Not 2D, off their self-titled album, directly references the line.

<text>Slime, a German punk rock band founded in Hamburg in 1979, became a defining band in the 1980s German punk scene, and is the most widely recognized example of the musical style Deutschpunk.

==Musical style==
Although initially playing in the straightforward style of late 70&#x27;s British punk, Slime developed their own unique style of punk rock, which has been seminal for Deutschpunk. Slime&#x27;s songs involve complex song structures with layered, sophisticated lyrics, that often include an element of story-telling. The main themes in Slime&#x27;s music are political resistance to racism, xenophobia, homophobia, and fascism. Their political activism on these topics has strongly influenced the German punk movement in general. The band describes their music as protest songs. In the 1980s they were associated with the anti-nuclear and squatting movements. Their anti-police songs continue to be anthems of leftist political movements, and have translated into slogans that are widely used, for example, in graffiti and stickering campaigns.

Slime is a controversial band in several ways. During the period where they were becoming successful, they were accused of &quot;selling out&quot;. Some of their lyrics have expressed anti-American sentiment, a popular opinion among students in the &#x27;68 generation, because Americans were perceived to have put several prominent Nazi sympathizers back into power (see also Red Army Faction#Background). This attracted criticism from the political left; the song &quot;Yankees raus&quot; (English translation: &quot;Yankees get out&quot;) originated in that historical period, and is one they no longer play. A few of their songs have been the subject of legal investigations, most famously the songs &quot;Wir wollen keine Bullenschweine&quot; (English translation: &quot;We don&#x27;t want any cops/pigs&quot;) and &quot;Deutschland muss sterben&quot;, both released in 1980. &quot;Bullenschweine&quot; was indexed in 2011 and is no longer played, while &quot;Deutschland&quot; was legally classified as protected art in 2000.

==History==

===Early years 1979–1984===

Michael &quot;Elf&quot; Mayer and Sven &quot;Eddie&quot; Räther both attended high school at the Gymnasium Heidberg in the Hamburg district of Hamburg-Langenhorn. They discovered their love for punk rock through the Ramones&#x27; first album and decided to form a band. Mayer played guitar and Räther played bass, and the harbor worker Peter &quot;Ball&quot; Wodok played drums. The band&#x27;s first vocalist was Thorsten &quot;Scout&quot; Kolle, a friend and classmate of Mayer and Räther. They first performed under the name &quot;Slime 79 and the Sewer Army&quot;, although this was soon shortened to &quot;Slime&quot;. The first song written by the band was &quot;Polizei SA/SS&quot;, which compared the police to the SA and SS, a reaction to the police actions against anti-nuclear protests. Slime&#x27;s first performance was in the youth center Kiwittsmoor, appearing with the band &quot;The Kreislaufkollaps&quot;. The singer for the Kreislaufkollaps, Dirk Jora (artist name &quot;Dicken&quot; and later &quot;Diggen&quot;), was impressive and they asked him to replace Kolle as singer.

Slime&#x27;s practice room was a former bunker in Hamburg-Eimsbüttel. After Diggen joined the band, the first song that they wrote was &quot;Wir wollen keine Bullenschweine&quot;. Tom Meyer from &quot;Moderne Musik&quot; offered to release this song as a single. In fall 1979 Slime recorded four songs for an EP: &quot;Bullenschweine&quot;, &quot;Iran&quot;, &quot;Hey Punk&quot; and &quot;Ich hasse&quot;. This EP was released in February 1980; only 2,000 LPs were pressed, and they quickly sold out. On February 24, 1980 Slime performed with The Buttocks at the youth prison Neuengamme, which was built on the former land of the concentration camp Neuengamme. They played &quot;Polizei SA/SS&quot; and &quot;Wir wollen keine Bullenschweine&quot;, as well as a cover version of Drafi Deutscher&#x27;s song &quot;Marmor, Stein und Eisen bricht&quot;. The audience reacted so aggressively that further rock concerts were not allowed at the prison for years. Shortly after this performance Christian Mevs joined the band as a second guitarist.

The band released their first album, Slime I in 1981. The album contained a copy of the song &quot;Wir wollen keine Bullenschweine&quot;, which attracted the attention of the Hamburg public prosecutor. Charges for &quot;Volksverhetzung&quot; (&quot;incitement to hatred&quot;) were filed and dropped. This album contained the song &quot;A.C.A.B.&quot; (&quot;All Cops Are Bastards&quot;), which has become a slogan of leftist political movements. This first album also contained a song against the government &quot;They Don&#x27;t Give a Fuck&quot;, as well as the punk anthem &quot;Hey Punk&quot;.

In 1982, Slime&#x27;s second album &quot;Yankees Raus&quot; was released. This album contained well-known songs like &quot;Gerechtigkeit&quot; (English translation: &quot;Justice&quot;), and &quot;Legal-Illegal-Scheißegal&quot; (English translation: &quot;Legal-Illegal-It doesn&#x27;t matter&quot;) that the band still performs.

Slime&#x27;s music and lyrics became darker and more complex by their third album &quot;Alle Gegen Alle&quot;, released in 1983. Notable songs are &quot;Deutschland muss Sterben (...damit wir leben können)&quot; (English translation: &quot;Germany must die (... so we can live)&quot;), an allusion to a line of the 1914 poem &quot;Soldatenabschied&quot; by the German poet Heinrich Lersch: &quot;Deutschland muß leben, und wenn wir sterben müssen&quot; (Germany must live, even if we must die). This album also included classic Slime songs frequently played today &quot;Linke Spießer&quot;, &quot;Störtebeker&quot;, and &quot;Sand im Getriebe&quot;. Following the release of &quot;Alle Gegen Alle&quot;, Slime broke up and was inactive for several years.

===Pursuing other projects 1984–1990 ===

Although they had formally broken up, Slime continued to play together in 1992, making several appearances in Hamburg. The members of the band also pursued other projects. Eddi Räther and Michael &quot;Elf&quot; Mayer formed a short-lived band called &quot;Targets&quot; with Stéphane Larsson from The Buttocks. 

Stephan Mahler played drums in the Gothic rock band &quot;Mask For&quot; and the group Torpedo Moskau. Mahler and Mevs founded the band Angeschissen together with Jens Rachut.
Aside from this, Mevs and Mahler founded the &quot;Soundgarden-Studio“ in Hamburg. Mevs took on the work in the studio, becoming one of the most important producers of albums from the Hamburger Schule; he produced records for Tocotronic, Blumfeld, and Die Sterne, as well as other bands signed to the independent record label L’age d’or.

In 1988, Michael Mayer had joined Destination Zero, a band where Peter Siegler from Razzia was also a member. In 1989 both men became members of the band Abwärts, which had reformed and which continued to be active until 1995.
After Slime&#x27;s reunion in 1994, Mayer continued worked in Abwärts in parallel with Slime.

===Second Phase 1990–1994 ===

Following German Reunification, neo-fascism was on the rise in Germany (see Hoyerswerda riots, Rostock-Lichtenhagen riots), and many German punk bands responded by writing songs and producing albums. Slime reformed to preduce the album &quot;Viva La Muerte&quot; in 1992. Their next album, released in 1994, was &quot;Schweineherbst&quot; (English translation: &quot;Autumn Of Swines&quot;), and is by many seen as their masterpiece, musically as well as lyrically. Dirk Jora has said that the title from this song refers to how the neo-nazi&#x27;s wanted to burn people in their beds like swine. This album includes the chilling song &quot;Der Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschland&quot; (English translation: &quot;Death is a master from Germany&quot;). This song was inspired by the poem &quot;Todesfuge&quot; (lit. &quot;Death Fugue&quot;) by Paul Celan, who was a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust and described the horrors he had experienced there. After the release of &quot;Schweineherbst&quot; the band broke up again.

In 1998 Diggen and Elf formed the band C.I.A. (Church of Independent Assholes) to produce the album &quot;Codename Freibeuter&quot;. C.I.A. released a re-written cover version of Rio Reiser&#x27;s song König von Deutschland in collaboration with Axel Kurth of the band Wizo and Bela B. of Die Ärzte. After a short tour, this band also broke up.

===Re-releasing the early albums and Rubberslime 1995 -- 2009 ===

In 2002 and 2003 the record label Weird System re-released Slime&#x27;s first three albums. The titles that had been censored were re-sung in a way that avoided further prosecution. In 2004 the double DVD &quot;Wenn der Himmel brennt&quot; was released; this DVD had been scheduled to be released in 2003, but had to be postponed because of ongoing legal investigations. The DVD provides a documentary overview of the band history, and includes a 56-page booklet with an interview that discussed the band history and includes a list of releases.

In 2003 the members of Slime began a collaboration with the band Rubbermaids, which they dubbed Rubberslime. The impetus for this collaboration was a concert at the football club FC St. Pauli. They produced a single &quot;Viva St. Pauli&quot; in 2003, and two albums: &quot;First Attack&quot; in 2004, and &quot;Rock’n’Roll Genossen&quot; in 2005.

=== &quot;Sich fügen heißt lügen&quot; Reunion 2009–2020 ===
Slime reunited in 2009 and released the album &quot;Sich fügen heißt lügen&quot; (English translation: &quot;To submit is to lie&quot;) in 2012. This album centered lyrically on the anarchist and poet Erich Mühsam. It includes the anthems &quot;Rebellen&quot; and &quot;Zum Kampf&quot;.

In 2017, Slime released the album &quot;Hier und jetzt&quot; (English translation: &quot;Here and now&quot;). In one of the songs on this album, &quot;Sie wollen wieder schießen dürfen&quot; (English translation: &quot;They again want to be allowed to shoot&quot;) they take on the extreme right movement and the Alternative for Germany (AfD), who lobbied to be able to shoot immigrants entering Germany. Another song on this album, &quot;Banalität Des Bösen&quot;, references the work of philosopher Hannah Arendt; this song protests both homophobia and racism.

In 2020, Slime released the album &quot;Wem gehört die Angst&quot; (English translation: &quot;Who does the fear belong to?&quot;). During this tour, the band broke up due to internal problems. Dirk Jora walked out, announcing publicly that the band had broken up. The rest of Slime announced simulataneously that Jora had stepped back for health reasons. The remainder of their tour was cancelled. 

=== The re-formation of Slime with a new singer ===

Slime quickly recruited a new singer, Tex Brasket, with whom they recorded a new album &quot;Zwei&quot; (&quot;two&quot;), released in 2022. Jora has said that the new band should have selected a new name.

<text>Cinéfest Sudbury International Film Festival, also known as Cinéfestand Cinéfest Sudbury is an annual film festival in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, held over nine days each September. It is one of the largest film festivals in Canada.

First held in 1989, Cinéfest quickly became a popular destination for Canadian filmmakers. Unlike the larger film festivals in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, Cinéfest offers filmmakers a chance to gain exposure among more typical film audiences in a city which, at the time of the festival&#x27;s launch in 1989, had never previously had any regular venues for screening independent, international, and non-mainstream films. Cinéfest presents an annual program of over 135 films, both domestic and international, often screened for both English and French language audiences.

In 2022, the festival&#x27;s longtime executive director Tammy Frick was named the new chief executive officer of the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television. The festival&#x27;s longtime managing director Patrick O&#x27;Hearn was named the new executive director of Cinéfest Sudbury following the departure of Tammy Frick.

Cinéfest is a qualifying film festival for the Canadian Screen Awards.

== History ==
Patricia Rozema&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Heard the Mermaids Singing&quot; was presented in Sudbury in 1988 at a special test screening. Planned as a onetime event, Sudbury was being used as a test market for alternative Canadian films in communities outside of Canada&#x27;s top metropolitan markets. The result surprised everyone, with over 900 people attending the sold out screening. Cinéfest Sudbury International Film Festival was established a year later in 1989 as the Sudbury Film Festival, and despite some remaining skepticism, local citizens proved that the city could be receptive to repertory film culture, as approximately 9,000 cinema buffs crowded theatres during the three-day event. The event proved so popular, in fact, that despite having booked opening gala &quot;Jesus of Montreal&quot; in a 600-seat hall rather than a movie theatre, 1,500 people lined up for the screening and the festival had to quickly add two follow-up screenings. Director Cameron Haynes noted that not even the Toronto International Film Festival had been as wildly popular in its first year of operation.

By 1993, Cinéfest evolved into a full-service film organization, with the festival growing to include upwards of 60 films over five days. Cinéfest Sudbury has become recognized as one of Canada&#x27;s premiere film festivals. The festival has developed a distinct identity and role within its community and the media arts industry, winning provincial and national acclaim. It is administrated by the non-profit Cultural Industries Ontario North.

=== Northern Film Circuit ===
Cinéfest Sudbury has a long history of promoting Canadian cinema and supporting the local film industry. One of the organization&#x27;s most ambitious projects was the establishment of the Northern Film Circuit (NFC) in 1992. An attempt to build audiences in Northern Ontario for Canadian and international film, the NFC began with only four members. The NFC was eventually used as a model for the Film Circuit, which was developed in partnership with the Toronto International Film Festival and now operates in over 110 communities throughout Ontario.

=== Northern Connections ===
Constantly working to bring knowledge to the north, Cinéfest introduced Industry Forum to the Festival&#x27;s framework in 2003, an initiative that has since provided emerging and mid-career film artists with access to key film representatives, and invited partnerships between Festival, industry and educational institutions. Since the introduction of industry forum, Cinéfest has established itself as a focal point for independent filmmakers, and programmers. While the festival has a long history of presenting and supporting films that represent the output of Canada&#x27;s independent film artists, Cinéfest Sudbury has also over the years extended significant support to its regional film artists. Through programs such as Northern Connections (introduced in 2003), a program which highlights the best and brightest of regional film talent, and the CTV Best in Shorts Competition, which has awarded over $92,000 in cash prizes to up-and-coming regional film talent since it was established in 2001, the festival has served as a place for regional artists to have their work seen and celebrated.

=== Mini-festivals ===
Since the overwhelming success of Cinéfest Sudbury in 2003, which saw 80 per cent of festival screenings either reach or exceed capacity, festival organizers have worked aggressively to ensure accessibility for its audiences. The Festival Expansion Initiative was developed and launched in 2004, through which the festival was expanded from six to nine days. A plan was also developed at that time to establish Cinéfest as a year-round venue to showcase the best in film. In 2006, Cinéfest Sudbury introduced two new mini-festivals, Canadian Spotlight and Show &amp; Tell Children&#x27;s Film Showcase). These events are now providing audiences with even greater access to the works of Canadian film artists and are providing area schools with educational and inspirational film works that meet the needs of each curriculum.

=== Cinema Summit ===
In 2010, Cinéfest Sudbury introduced The Cinema Summit, a presentation, exchange and development series devoted to the celebration, promotion and advancement of Canada&#x27;s new and emerging filmmaking talent. Aside from expanding the number of film screenings attended by talent associated with selected films, Cinema Summit features additional panel discussions, master classes and lectures with specific topics of focus, and introduces attendees to experts in the film and media arts industries. Cinema Summit represents Cinéfest&#x27;s next efforts to inspire audiences, talent, students and industry.

=== Cinéfest Sudbury Film Series ===
In 2010, Cinéfest Sudbury further expanded its year-round presence by introducing the Cinéfest Sudbury Film Series, a monthly film presentation series typically held on the last Thursday of each month, featuring the best in Canadian and international cinema. The Cinéfest Sudbury Film Series has since been discontinued.

===Cinéfest Sudbury International Film Festival Collection===
The Greater Sudbury Public Library maintains a dedicated &quot;Cinéfest Collection&quot;, featuring DVDs of over 200 films that have previously screened at the festival.

=== Cinéfest Sudbury Red Carpet Patron Program ===
At the end of 2021, Cinéfest Sudbury introduced the Red Carpet Patron Program, a subscription-based program for dedicated festival fans to keep the spirit of Cinéfest alive all year long. The program initially presented four exclusive films throughout the year but, due to popular demand and praise, has since expanded to provide registered Red Carpet Patrons with complimentary popcorn and access to six exclusive films throughout the year.

==Programming==
Cinéfest currently boasts a nine-day repertoire of film programming for local, national and international guests. Its lineup often includes a selection of prominent international films which may have screened at TIFF just a week or two earlier, but also places a greater emphasis on both commercial and independent Canadian films. In 2021, when Michael McGowan attended the festival to screen &quot;All My Puny Sorrows&quot;, he praised Cinéfest&#x27;s dedication to Canadian film, noting that it was the only film festival that had screened every single film he had ever made in his career.

Due to the Sudbury region&#x27;s significant Franco-Ontarian population, the festival also programs a significant selection of French-language films from both Quebec and France. In recent years, the festival has also programmed a dedicated Cinema Indigenized stream of Indigenous Canadian films, and as the region is also a significant centre of Finnish Canadian settlement, the festival frequently tries to ensure that at least one film from Finland is also present in each year&#x27;s lineup.

The festival is sometimes the world premiere venue for films that were produced or shot within Northern Ontario. 

Cinéfest also includes a Best in Shorts competition, sponsored by CTV Northern Ontario, for student and emerging filmmakers from Northern Ontario. Films are entered in one of three categories, Open, Student or Northern Flicks, and are screened at a dedicated event during the festival, with the winners and runners-up in each category awarded cash prizes of $500, $750 or $1,250 depending on the category. Best in Shorts was suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic, but returned in 2023.

<text>The East 143rd Street–St. Mary&#x27;s Street station is a local station on the IRT Pelham Line of the New York City Subway. It is served by the 6 train at all times, and is located at the intersection of East 143rd Street (also known as St. Mary&#x27;s Street) and Southern Boulevard in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx. The station opened in 1919 as part of an extension of the Pelham Line of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, and had its platforms extended in the 1960s.

== History ==
This station opened on January 7, 1919, as part of an extension of the Pelham Line from Third Avenue–138th Street to Hunts Point Avenue by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT).

Both platforms were extended at the east (railroad north) end in the 1960s to accommodate the current standard length of an IRT train (). The extensions are noticeable as they are narrower than the rest of the platforms, have no columns, and the trim line is blue with &quot;E 143RD ST&quot; in white sans serif font. They also resulted in the platforms being slightly offset.

==Station layout==
This underground station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center express track is used by the weekday peak direction &lt;6&gt; service. The 6 local train serves the station at all times. The next stop to the south is Cypress Avenue, while the next stop to the north is East 149th Street.

Both platforms have their original Dual Contracts mosaic trim line and name tablets. &quot;143&quot; tablets for &quot;East 143rd Street&quot; run along the trim line at regular intervals and the name tablets have &quot;E. 143RD STREET&quot; in all-caps, serif lettering. Dark blue i-beam columns run along the platforms at regular intervals with every other one having the standard black name plate with white lettering.

There are no crossovers or crossunders to allow free transfers between directions. There is a closed newsstand that has been tiled over.

By passenger count, it is the least-used station in the Bronx, the least-used station outside of the Rockaway Line, and the least-used IRT station citywide.

===Exits===
Both platforms have one same-level fare control area at the south (geographical west) end. Each one has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The ones on the Pelham Bay Park-bound platform go up to the either southern corners of the T-intersection of Southern Boulevard and East 143rd Street while the ones on the Manhattan-bound platform go up to either northern corners.

<doc id="729025" wikidata="Q17148280" url="?curid=729025" title="Landau (automobile)">
<text>The Landau began as a carriage design with a folding fabric top consisting of two sections supported by external elliptic springs. This landau roof design was adopted in early automobiles as a convertible top. The term, however, came to mean a simulated convertible. A &quot;landau bar&quot; is an ornamental feature located on a car&#x27;s c-pillar derived from the roof form, primarily used on hearses.

The Nash Rambler Landau introduced in 1950 is a cabrio coach with a power-operated fabric top.

== Origins ==
Carriages that had a fabric top that could be lowered and raised were named 
&quot;Landau&quot; carriages after the city of Landau in Germany where convertible carriages were first produced.

Thus the name &quot;landau&quot;, like many other automobile terms, originates from coachbuilding (since coachbuilders began making motor car bodies instead, and because customers were familiar with coachbuilding terms).

The &quot;landau&quot; described a carriage that featured a manually folding fabric roof that was supported by elliptical springs. The top was designed with separate folding front and rear sections that raised or lowered independently or locked together in the middle to cover the carriage. To differentiate the landau models, the coachbuilders typically included large sidebars.

The automotive equivalent to the horse-drawn landau carriage was not popular, since a forward view was generally insisted upon by passengers. Instead, the more popular body style for automobiles was the landaulet (half-landau), with its covered front seats and open rear seats.

The 1935 handbook of the Society of Automotive Engineers defines the landau as &quot;a closed-type body with provision for opening or folding the rear quarter, by the use of landau joints&quot; and this usually makes it impossible to include quarter glass.

== Simulated convertible ==
In the 1920s and 1930s, especially in the United States, &quot;landau&quot; became associated with cars where the fixed (eg metal) roof and rear quarter panels were covered with fabric or leather and fitted with S-shaped side landau bars, to make it appear like a convertible roof.

Following the 1920s and 1930s, when custom-built bodies were available with a split front and rear roof design, the use of &quot;landau&quot; changed from a functional feature on limited production cars to of a decorative feature in some higher market segment production cars.

The term &quot;landau&quot; fell into disuse from the mid-1940s until the late-1950s. It was used to describe fixed-roof cars styled to simulate a two-piece roof or to resemble convertibles, sometimes time using vinyl roofs. An example of a two-piece roof is the 1957 Imperial four-door hardtop with a simulated &quot;landau-type&quot; roof design. Some models were called &quot;landaus&quot; by their manufacturers, and many were fitted with landau bars on the rear quarters (faux cabriolet).

A landau bar is an ornamental S-shaped metallic bar installed on the rear quarter panel of a car. Mostly used on hearses, the landau bar is skeuomorphic and represents the folding roof structure on a Landau carriage.

The early horse-drawn hearses were horse-drawn carriages that had fully functional landau bars to open and close the fabric roof. As automobile-based hearses became popular, they &quot;borrowed the landau bar flourish as an homage and an attempt to add a touch of Old-World class.&quot;

Since the mid-1940s, hearses in the United States commonly feature chrome bow-shaped landau bars on the simulated leather-covered rear roof sides. The landau bars have become a symbol of a funeral car to the point that hearse manufacturers continue to add them to &quot;limousines as a matter of tradition.&quot;

Ford included simulated landau bars on the highest trim versions of the Thunderbird beginning in 1962. Although the landau bar had become excessively gaudy trim on most passenger cars since the 1970s, there is an apparent return in the 2020s with &quot;neo-landau bars&quot; on some Genesis, Lexus, and Jeep SUV models. The objective is to &quot;provide some bit of visual interest on an otherwise boring expanse of D-pillar area.&quot; These landau bar-type ornamentations are slimmer and also integrate into the bodyside brightwork.

== Nash Rambler Landau ==
In 1950, Nash Motors introduced the Rambler, &quot;the first true compact car of the post-World War II era&quot; in a two-door cabrio coach body style called the &quot;Nash Rambler Landau&quot; achieving sales success &quot;when big was better among most U.S. automakers.&quot; 

This model was described as a &quot;convertible landau&quot; and the roof section from the top of the windscreen could be retracted into the trunk/boot. A &quot;bridge beam&quot; steel structure remained in place at the top of the doors and windows.

No other convertible featured anything like the Nash Rambler Landau with the fabric top that slid back to open along the fixed side rails. The fabric top was power-operated with a cover that could be snapped on when the top was open. The Rambler&#x27;s strong body structure eliminated the internal bracing that was normally needed on other open roof cars.
== Ford Thunderbird Landau ==
Ford marketed versions of the Ford Thunderbird using Landau as a model name. The 1962 Landau was a hardtop that included a padded vinyl roof in white or black with simulated S-bars with a raised wing Thunderbird emblem on the C-pillars. This model was popular and contributed to increased sales.

The &quot;Town Landau&quot; model was a model of the 1966 Thunderbird line. It featured a wide rear C-pillar with no rear quarter windows with a painted roof or available with a vinyl-covered roof that came in black, white, parchment, or sage gold and included color-coordinated S-bars. 

The Thunderbird was redesigned for 1967 and included a four-door sedan body design with rear-hinged (suicide) doors. All four-door models included a vinyl roof and landau bars giving them the official name of &quot;Landau Sedan&quot;. The C-pillar was visually extended into the rear door window area and covered to match the vinyl top, with the landau bars helping camouflage the cut line. The simulated landau design with overwrought trim on the four-door model has been described as &quot;a one-car funeral procession&quot;.

The Town Landau two-door version was reintroduced as a mid-1977 model as the most luxurious Thunderbird that included many standard comfort and trim features. It did not have any simulated landau bars, only the &quot;Town Landau&quot; name in script etched on the opera windows. This top model continued to be marketed for several more years.

<text>The Longwood Avenue station is a local station on the IRT Pelham Line of the New York City Subway. It is served by the 6 train at all times and is located at Longwood Avenue and Southern Boulevard in the Longwood neighborhood of the Bronx. The station opened in 1919 as part of an extension of the Pelham Line of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, and had its platforms extended in the 1960s. Further renovations were completed in 2019 and 2020.

== History ==
This station opened on January 7, 1919 as part of the extension of the Pelham Line from Third Avenue–138th Street to Hunts Point Avenue. The extension was completed by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company as part of the Dual Contracts with the New York City.

From October 28, 2019 to December 2019, the northbound platform was temporarily closed for repairs. From February 3, 2020 to April 10, 2020, the southbound platform was similarly temporarily closed for repairs.

==Station layout==

This underground station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center express track is used by the weekday peak direction &lt;6&gt; service. The 6 local train serves the station at all times. The next stop to the south is East 149th Street, while the next stop to the north is Hunts Point Avenue.

Both platforms have their original Dual Contracts mosaic trim line and name tablets. The Vickers geometric design shows a diamond pattern in sea-foam green with a border of darker green mixed with blue. &quot;L&quot; plaques for &quot;Longwood Avenue&quot; run along the trim line at regular intervals. The name tablets are bordered in mixed shades of green and brown, and read &quot;LONGWOOD AVE.&quot; in all-caps, serif white lettering on a mottled blue background. Light green I-beam columns run along the platforms at their center at regular intervals with every other one having the standard black name plate with white lettering.

Both platforms were extended at either ends in the 1960s to accommodate the current standard length of an IRT train (). The extensions are noticeable as they are narrower than the rest of the platforms, have no columns, and the trim line is blue with &quot;LONGWOOD AVE&quot; in white sans serif font. The extensions result in the platforms being slightly offset.

There are no crossovers or crossunders to allow free transfers between directions. The southbound platform has a green fiberglass bucket seat bench built in the extended area in the 1960s.

===Exits===
Both platforms have one same-level fare control area at the east (railroad north) end. Each one has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The ones on the Pelham Bay Park-bound platform go up to either southern corner of Southern Boulevard and Longwood Avenue while the ones on the Manhattan-bound platform go up to either northern corner.

<doc id="729028" wikidata="Q646715" url="?curid=729028" title="Bloodwynd">
<text>Bloodwynd is a codename used by multiple superheroes who have appeared in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character initially debuted in &quot;Justice League America&quot; #61 (April 1992) and was created by Dan Jurgens. While the character&#x27;s origins were initially portrayed as an alter-ego of Martian Manhunter, subsequent portrayals of Bloodwynd depicted them as distinct and independent characters.

The first Bloodwynd is a necromancer who is revealed to be a descendant of African American slaves seeking retribution against their slave owner. Through a dark ritual involving a blood gem created as a sacrifice, they gained the ability to wield its powers, which facilitated their freedom. This version of Bloodwynd, initially unnamed, is later identified as Quintus Arce. While Martian Manhunter temporarily assumed his identity, Bloodwynd remained an ally of the Justice League and a superhero with sorcerous abilities until his disappearance after the team disbanded. It is revealed he was condemned to hell after an encounter with the sorcerer Felix Faust.

The second Bloodwynd is Quintus&#x27; nephew Raphael Arce, an empath whose abilities was awakened by the Lazarus rain during &quot;Lazarus Planet&quot;. He later absorbs portions of Doomsday and Martian Manhunter&#x27;s souls, giving him several unique eldritch abilities.

==Fictional character biographies==

=== Quintus Arce ===
Bloodwynd is the descendant of a group of African-American slaves owned by a brutal, sadistic planter named Jacob Whitney. These slaves performed an ancient ritual to create a mystical Blood Gem, with which they killed Whitney. The Blood Gem was passed down among the slaves&#x27; descendants. The Gem bestowed great physical powers on its wearer; unbeknownst to them, it also contained a microscopic world, where Jacob Whitney&#x27;s spirit had become incarnate as the demon Rott. Over the years, Rott grew stronger as the Gem absorbed the dark side of each wearer&#x27;s soul.

In recent times, Rott sucked Bloodwynd into the Gem and held him captive, while mind controlling Martian Manhunter, compelling him to wear the Gem and impersonate Bloodwynd. Using Bloodwynd&#x27;s identity, the Manhunter rejoined the Justice League, seeking a power source which would enable Rott to escape from his micro-world. While the JLA fought Doomsday alongside Superman, Blue Beetle realizes that Bloodwynd is Martian Manhunter after he is incapacitated by fire. Once the truth is exposed, the Justice League battles Rott and frees the real Bloodwynd. 

Bloodwynd remained with the League after they rescued him from within the Gem. Later, he withheld information from the League about an offer of alliance from the mystical villain Dreamslayer. Bloodwynd did not join Dreamslayer. Sensing a strange kinship with him, however, he would not oppose him either.

During the Overmaster storyline, Bloodwynd was also strangely inactive, refusing to take action against what he perceived to be a natural course of events. These two incidents caused Bloodwynd to question his membership in the League. He voluntarily put himself on reserve status. He later appeared in &quot;Showcase &#x27;94&quot; #5 (May 1994), written by Ruben Diaz and illustrated by Max Douglas. In this story, Bloodwynd reveals more about the nature of his morality and powers, and punishes a drug dealer by forcing him to experience the pain of his victims.

In &quot;JLA&quot; #27 (March 1999), Bloodwynd joins an emergency expansion of the Justice League to battle Amazo. The battle, which takes place in the Florida Everglades, goes badly as most of the JLA are defeated and their powers copied. Amazo loses his powers when Superman disbands the League.

==== Day of Judgment ====

He appeared during the &quot;Day of Judgement&quot; storyline and in &quot;JLA Black Baptism&quot; serving as a member of the Sentinels of Magic. In the latter storyline, he was badly injured by the &quot;Diablos&quot;, a group of Mafia-styled demons who wished to gain revenge for demons slain during the &quot;Day of Judgement&quot;.

He was seen in a cameo during a bar brawl in the Oblivion Bar in &quot;Superman/Batman&quot;.

==== Post-Flashpoint ====
In the revised continuity, Bloodwynd&#x27;s history closely mirrors his pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; incarnation. In &quot;DC Power 2024&quot;, it is revealed that Quintus, a descendant, becomes the superhero Bloodwynd after inheriting the bloodgem. Following a confrontation with Felix Faust, Bloodwynd is condemned to Hell, where he relives his past failures. Saved by his nephew, Raphael, Bloodwynd learns that holding the bloodgem upon death leads to damnation. Raphael takes on the mantle, freeing Bloodwynd from Hell. Before vanishing, Bloodwynd urges his nephew to carry the legacy responsibly.

=== Raphael Arce ===
In &quot;Lazarus Planet&quot;, Raphael, a native of Metropolis affected by the Lazarus rains, discovers that he has gained empathic powers. Utilizing his abilities to alleviate the pain of others, he encounters a living memory of Doomsday and traps him in a psychic blood gem.

==Other versions==
A version of Bloodwynd is part of Earth 16 which is free of crime due to Superman&#x27;s robots. Bloodwynd manages to break free of the ennui surrounding the heroes as he recalls his heroic past; he realizes there is more to life than letting the robots handle everything.

==Powers and abilities==
Quintus is a proficient necromancer, adept at summoning and utilizing the life energy and enhanced power of deceased spirits. He also possesses the ability to sense death locations and can impose the torment of victims upon murderers, similar to Ghost Rider&#x27;s &quot;Penance Stare&quot;.

The Raphael Arce incarnation of Bloodwynd is a metahuman with empathy that enables him to heal emotional and physical pain. Both iterations of the character are equipped with a &quot;blood gem&quot;, a potent arcane object that bestows a range of magical abilities. These abilities include flight, enhanced strength, telepathy, and the ability to cast illusions.

== In other media ==
Bloodwynd appears as a character summon in &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;.

<doc id="729031" wikidata="Q2217986" url="?curid=729031" title="Hunts Point Avenue station">
<text>The Hunts Point Avenue station is an express station on the IRT Pelham Line of the New York City Subway, served by the 6 train at all times and the &lt;6&gt; train on weekdays in the peak direction. It is located at Hunts Point Avenue and Southern Boulevard in the Longwood neighborhood in the Bronx.

This station opened in 1919 as part of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT)&#x27;s Pelham Line. The line was constructed as part of an agreement between New York City and two private transit operators to expand transit service across the city known as the Dual Contracts. The station exclusively served local trains until 1946, when rush-hour express service began. The Hunts Point Avenue station was renovated to become compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 in 2014.

== History ==

=== Background ===
In 1913, New York City, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) reached an agreement, known as the Dual Contracts, to dramatically expand subway service across the City. The portion of the agreement between New York City and the IRT was known as Contract 3. As part of this contract, the IRT agreed to construct a branch of the original subway, which opened in 1904, north along Lexington Avenue with branches along Jerome Avenue and a three-track branch running northeast via 138th Street, Southern Boulevard and Westchester Avenue to Pelham Bay Park.

The construction of the Lexington Avenue Line, in conjunction with the construction of the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line would change the operations of the IRT system. Instead of having trains go via Broadway, turning onto 42nd Street, before finally turning onto Park Avenue, there would be two trunk lines connected by the 42nd Street Shuttle. The system would be changed from looking like a &quot;Z&quot; system on a map to an &quot;H&quot; system. One trunk would run via the new Lexington Avenue Line down Park Avenue, and the other trunk would run via the new Seventh Avenue Line up Broadway.

=== Opening ===
On August 1, 1918, the first portion of the Pelham Line opened as a branch of the Lexington Avenue Line, with the extension of Lexington Avenue local service to Third Avenue–138th Street. The Hunts Point Avenue station opened on January 7, 1919, as the new terminal of the Pelham Line, with the extension of the line from Third Avenue–138th Street. The extension was originally supposed to be finished by the end of 1918, but due to the difficulty in acquiring materials, the opening was delayed. In January 1919, the New York State Public Service Commission was looking into acquiring property for a subway yard at Pelham Bay Park. On May 30, 1920, the Pelham Line was extended to East 177th Street, with the extension being served by a shuttle service operating with elevated cars. Passengers transferred to the shuttle at Hunts Point Avenue.

Express service at this station, and on the Pelham Line between East 177th Street and Third Avenue–138th Street, was inaugurated on October 14, 1946. Express trains ran during weekday rush hours and on Saturday morning in the peak direction. This express service saved eight minutes between Third Avenue and East 177th Street. During this time, 6 trains that ran local in the Bronx when express trains operated terminated at East 177th Street to make room for express trains to Pelham Bay Park. Express service did not start until this date because of the increase in ridership from the huge Parkchester housing complex at East 177th Street.

=== Renovations ===

In the early 1960s, the platforms at this station along the Pelham Line were extended to accommodate 10-car trains. The stations along the line between Hunts Point Avenue and Third Avenue–138th Street, and Third Avenue–149th Street on the IRT White Plains Road Line had their platforms extended under the same contract. Construction of the platform extensions was still underway as of June 1963.

On April 12, 1978, following president Jimmy Carter&#x27;s visit to the nearly-destroyed Charlotte Street neighborhood nearby, his administration announced that it would allocate $55.6 million to help rehabilitate the blighted South Bronx between then and September 30. Some of this funding was planned to go to the modernization of the Third Avenue–149th Street and Hunts Point Avenue stations. A component of the planned renovations was increased security.

In 1981, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system. On November 18, 2014, a $17.8 million project to make the station compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 was completed, and the reconstructed entrances and fare control area opened to the public. There are three elevators: one from the mezzanine to each platform within fare control, and one from the mezzanine to Monsignor Del Valle Square.

Under the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program, the station, along with thirty other New York City Subway stations, would have been entirely closed for up to six months to undergo a complete overhaul. Updates would have included cellular service, Wi-Fi, charging stations, improved signage, and improved station lighting. However, these renovations were deferred until the 2020–2024 Capital Program due to a lack of funding.

This underground station has three tracks and two island platforms. The 6 stops on the outer local tracks at all times, while the &lt;6&gt; stops on the center express track during weekdays in the peak direction. This is the last underground station on the line outbound before the elevated stretch to Pelham Bay Park. The next stop to the south is for local trains and for express trains. The next stop to the north is for local trains and for express trains.

The track walls have geometric Squire Vickers-designed mosaic friezes in muted shades of blue, grey and beige, with occasional sections of pale pink. The large identifying plaques show &quot;H P&quot;. Matching &quot;uptown&quot; and &quot;downtown&quot; directional mosaics are found in the mezzanine, along with a smaller, simplified version of the frieze found on the lower level. Dark green I-beam columns run along both platforms at regular intervals, a single line in the middle at their ends and one line on each side at their center.

===Exits===

This station&#x27;s main fare control area is a mezzanine above the center of the platforms and tracks. Two staircases from each platform go up to a waiting area/crossover, where a turnstile bank provides access to and from the station. Outside fare control, there is a token booth and two street stairs going up to Monsignor Del Valle Square, a city-owned park on the triangle formed by East 163rd Street, Hunts Point Avenue, and Bruckner Boulevard. In a design that is not common in the subway system, the street-level facility, street stair enclosures, and lights are all made of bricks. Although the platform level is lit by fluorescent bulbs, the mezzanine remains lit by incandescent lights, which were replaced along every platform in the subway by the late 1980s.

The northbound platform has an exit-only at its extreme southern end. A twisting staircase goes up to a street-level steel and glass structure, where exit-only turnstiles provide access out of the station. It is located at the southeast corner of Southern Boulevard and Hunts Point Avenue.

== Ridership ==
In 2018, the station had 3,216,569 boardings, making it the 153rd most used station in the -station system. This amounted to an average of 10,460 passengers per weekday.

<text>The Whitlock Avenue station is a local station on the IRT Pelham Line of the New York City Subway. It is served by the 6 train at all times and is located at Whitlock Avenue and Westchester Avenue in the Foxhurst neighborhood of the Bronx.

== History ==
The Whitlock Avenue station opened on May 30, 1920 as the Pelham Line was extended to East 177th Street from Hunts Point Avenue. The construction of the Pelham Line was part of the Dual Contracts, signed on March 19, 1913 and also known as the Dual Subway System. The Pelham Line was built as a branch of the Lexington Avenue Line running northeast via 138th Street, Southern Boulevard and Westchester Avenue. Initially, the extension was served by a shuttle service operating with elevated cars. Passengers transferred to the shuttle at Hunts Point Avenue.

==Station layout==
The station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center express track is used by the &lt;6&gt; service during weekdays in the peak direction. The 6 local train serves the station at all times. The next stop to the south is Hunts Point Avenue, while the next stop to the north is Elder Avenue. The station has covered-over old signs and a windscreen on the south end. The north end has a full canopy over the platform.

The station is adjacent to an abandoned railroad station called Westchester Avenue which was served by the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway (NYW&amp;B), and the Harlem River Branch of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. Currently, the line is used by Amtrak. The former NYW&amp;B line was at one time proposed to be converted into an extension of the IRT Dyre Avenue Line leading to this station, rather than its current terminus at East 180th Street on the IRT White Plains Road Line. The station is also located right next to the Sheridan Expressway.

Southbound, this is the last elevated station before the wholly underground stretch to Brooklyn Bridge station. Northbound, the line makes a right angle turn to the east and crosses the Bronx River via a truss bridge.

===Exits===
The mezzanine is wood and features frosted windows in a simulated 16-pane pattern. At one time there were doors to the fare control but they have been removed; doors from fare control to the street remain. Outside fare control, exit stairs lead to either southern corner of Westchester Avenue and Whitlock Avenue.

<text>The Elder Avenue station is a local station on the IRT Pelham Line of the New York City Subway. Served by the 6 train at all times, it is located at the intersection of Elder Avenue and Westchester Avenue in the Soundview neighborhood of the Bronx.

== History ==
Elder Avenue station opened on May 30, 1920, as the Pelham Line was extended to East 177th Street from Hunts Point Avenue. The construction of the Pelham Line was part of the Dual Contracts, signed on March 19, 1913, and also known as the Dual Subway System. The Pelham Line was built as a branch of the Lexington Avenue Line running northeast via 138th Street, Southern Boulevard and Westchester Avenue. Initially, the extension was served by a shuttle service operating with elevated cars. Passengers transferred to the shuttle at Hunts Point Avenue. As part of its 2025–2029 Capital Program, the MTA has proposed making the station wheelchair-accessible in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

==Station layout==

This elevated station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center track is used by the weekday peak direction &lt;6&gt; express service. The 6 local train serves the station at all times. The next stop to the south is Whitlock Avenue, while the next stop to the north is Morrison Avenue–Soundview. Both platforms have beige windscreens and red canopies with green frames and support columns at the center and black waist-high steel fences at either ends. The station name plates are in the standard black with white lettering that covered up the original IRT style mosaic signs.

===Exits===
The station&#x27;s only entrance/exit is an elevated station house beneath the tracks. Inside the turnstile bank, there are two staircases to each platform at the center and a waiting area that allows a free transfer between directions.

<doc id="729048" wikidata="Q1643970" url="?curid=729048" title="Affinity group">
<text>An anonymous affinity group is a group formed around a shared interest or common goal, to which individuals formally or informally belong. Affinity groups are generally precluded from being under the aegis of any governmental agency, and their purposes must be primarily non-commercial. Examples of affinity groups include private social clubs, fraternities, writing or reading circles, hobby clubs, and groups engaged in political activism.

Some affinity groups are organized in a non-hierarchical manner, often using consensus decision making, and are frequently made up of trusted friends. They provide a method of organization that is flexible and decentralized. Other affinity groups may have a hierarchy to provide management of the group&#x27;s long-term interests, or if the group is large enough to require the delegation of responsibilities to other members or staff.

Affinity groups can be based on a common social identity or ideology (e.g., anarchism, conservatism), a shared concern for a given issue (e.g., anti-nuclear, anti-abortion), a common activity, role, interest or skill (e.g., legal support, medical aid, software engineering), or shared personal identity (e.g. race/ethnicity, gender, disability, cultural interests). Affinity groups may have either open or closed membership, although the latter is far more common. Some charge membership dues or expect members to share the cost of the group&#x27;s expenses.

==Employee and professional affinity groups==

Affinity groups in the workplace or as part of a professional association are composed of people who share similar backgrounds or interests. In the workplace, they are also referred to as Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) that form a part of the organization diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. Employee affinity groups are historically race- and gender-based but now also include groups that recognize affinity in age, veteran status or sexual identity. As part of a professional association, affinity group members engage in networking, mentoring, and opportunities for both professional and personal development. 

==Political affinity groups==

Affinity groups engaged in political activism date to 19th century Spain. It was a favourite way of organization by Spanish anarchists (&quot;grupos de afinidad&quot;), and had their base in the tertulias or in the local groups.

Politically oriented affinity groups in the United States gained public attention during the anti-Vietnam War movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The term was first used by Ben Morea and the group Black Mask. Later, anti-war activists on college campuses organized around their hobbies or backgrounds -- religious, gender, ethnic group, etc. They became popular in the 1970s in the anti-nuclear movement in the United States and Europe. The 30,000 person occupation and blockade of the Ruhr nuclear power station in Germany in 1969 was organized on the Affinity group model. Today, the structure is used by many different activists: animal rights, environmental, anti-war, and anti-globalization, to name some examples.

The 1999 protests in Seattle which shut down the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 included coordinated organization by many clusters of Affinity groups.

==Organization==

===External===
By definition, Affinity groups are autonomous from any larger body. Co-ordinated effort and co-operation amongst several Affinity groups, however, is often achieved by using a loose form of confederation. Private clubs, for example, may cooperate through reciprocal agreements which allow the members of one club to use the facilities of another club in a different location. Other affinity groups, such as Rotarians or Toastmasters, may be individual units that conform to shared standards so that one may participate in another group of the same name anywhere on earth without requiring the individual to reapply for a new membership.

*&quot;Cluster&quot;: The cluster is the basic unit of organization amongst Affinity groups. A cluster consists of several Affinity groups and is organized in a non-hierarchical manner. A cluster can be permanent, but is more often an ad hoc grouping organized for one specific task or action. One can be organized around a shared goal (e.g. blockading a particular road), a common ideology (e.g. the Quakers) or a place of origin.
*&quot;Spokescouncil&quot;: The spokescouncil is an aggregate of clusters and Affinity groups. Each Affinity group or cluster nominates one representative (often called a &quot;spoke&quot;) to participate in the council. Spokescouncils are most often temporary bodies, committed to accomplishing one task or event.

===Internal===
Affinity groups tend to be loosely organized, however there are some formal roles or positions that commonly occur. A given Affinity group may have all, some or none of these positions. They may be permanent or temporary and the group may opt to take turns in these roles, or assign one role to one person.

*&quot;Spokesperson&quot; (or just &quot;spoke&quot;): The individual charged with representing the Affinity group at a spokescouncil or cluster meeting. Occasionally, the spoke will be granted a more general ambassadorial role by the Affinity group.
*&quot;Facilitator&quot;: A person or people who perform facilitation duties in consensus process of the group and also, to varying degrees, act as arbiter of internal conflicts.
*&quot;Media contact&quot;: An individual who represents the group to the mass media. Often this individual is the same person as the Spoke.
*&quot;Vibe watch&quot;: A person or people charged with monitoring the mood and feeling of the group. The reference is to &quot;vibrations&quot; in the colloquial emotional sense. In some Affinity groups, the vibe watch is also charged with keeping the facilitator from using his or her role to favor any position or proposal.
*&quot;Snap-decision facilitator&quot;: Also called &quot;quick decision facilitator&quot;, this is a person charged with making decisions for the group in time-constrained or high-pressure situations. The position is rare and is almost always temporary (contrast with the pre-Imperial Roman concept of a temporary dictator).

<text>The Morrison Avenue–Soundview station is a local station on the IRT Pelham Line of the New York City Subway. It is served by the 6 train at all times and is located at Morrison Avenue and Westchester Avenue in the Soundview neighborhood of the Bronx.

==History==
The station opened on May 30, 1920 as Sound View Avenue and has also been known as Morrison Avenue–Sound View Avenue and Morrison–Sound View Avenues. The station was opened as the Pelham Line was extended to East 177th Street from Hunts Point Avenue. The construction of the Pelham Line was part of the Dual Contracts, signed on March 19, 1913 and also known as the Dual Subway System. The Pelham Line was built as a branch of the Lexington Avenue Line running northeast via 138th Street, Southern Boulevard and Westchester Avenue. Initially, the extension was served by a shuttle service operating with elevated cars. Passengers transferred to the shuttle at Hunts Point Avenue.

In 1981, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system.

==Station layout==
This elevated station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center track is used by the &lt;6&gt; train on weekdays in the peak direction. The 6 local train serves the station at all times. The next stop to the south is Elder Avenue, while the next stop to the north is St. Lawrence Avenue. The platforms have beige windscreen, green canopies, and red roofs in the center and waist-level black steel fence at both ends.

===Exits===
Two staircases from each platform lead to the wooden elevated mezzanine beneath the tracks. The station house has a turnstile bank, token booth, and three street staircases to all four corners of Morrison and Westchester Avenues except for the southeast one.

<text>The Parkchester station (originally Parkchester–177th Street station) is an express station on the IRT Pelham Line of the New York City Subway. It is located above Hugh J. Grant Circle in the Parkchester neighborhood of the Bronx, where East 177th Street (the Cross Bronx Expressway service road), Metropolitan Avenue, and Westchester Avenue intersect. The station is served by the 6 train at all times and the &lt;6&gt; train during weekdays in the peak direction.

By passenger count, Parkchester was the third-busiest station in the Bronx in 2017, behind 161st Street–Yankee Stadium and Third Avenue–149th Street, and the busiest station on the Pelham Line.

==History==

=== Background ===
In 1913, New York City, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) reached an agreement, known as the Dual Contracts, to dramatically expand subway service across the City. The portion of the agreement between New York City and the IRT was known as Contract 3. As part of this contract, the IRT agreed to construct a branch of the original subway, which opened in 1904, north along Lexington Avenue with branches along Jerome Avenue and a three-track branch running northeast via 138th Street, Southern Boulevard and Westchester Avenue to Pelham Bay Park.

The construction of the Lexington Avenue Line, in conjunction with the construction of the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line would change the operations of the IRT system. Instead of having trains go via Broadway, turning onto 42nd Street, before finally turning onto Park Avenue, there would be two trunk lines connected by the 42nd Street Shuttle. The system would be changed from looking like a &quot;Z&quot; system on a map to an &quot;H&quot; system. One trunk would run via the new Lexington Avenue Line down Park Avenue, and the other trunk would run via the new Seventh Avenue Line up Broadway.

=== Opening ===
On August 1, 1918, the first portion of the Pelham Line opened as a branch of the Lexington Avenue Line, with the extension of Lexington Avenue local service to Third Avenue–138th Street; the line was extended to the Hunts Point Avenue station the next year. The extension was originally supposed to be finished by the end of 1918, but due to the difficulty in acquiring materials, the opening was delayed. In January 1919, the New York State Public Service Commission was looking into acquiring property for a subway yard at Pelham Bay Park. On May 30, 1920, the Pelham Line was extended to Parkchester–East 177th Street, with the extension being served by a shuttle service operating with elevated cars. Passengers transferred to the shuttle at Hunts Point Avenue.

Express service on the Pelham Line between East 177th Street and Third Avenue–138th Street was inaugurated on October 14, 1946. Express trains ran during weekday rush hours and on Saturday morning in the peak direction. This express service saved eight minutes between Third Avenue and East 177th Street. During this time, 6 trains that ran local in the Bronx when express trains operated terminated at East 177th Street to make room for express trains to Pelham Bay Park. Express service did not start until this date because of the increase in ridership from the huge Parkchester housing complex at East 177th Street.

This station was rehabilitated in 2010. The northbound platform was partially closed in April 2010 for renovations, followed by the southbound platform that July. The work included new canopies, stairs, lighting, and public intercom systems, as well as refurbished platform floors and structural repairs.

In 2019, as part of an initiative to increase the accessibility of the New York City Subway system, the MTA announced that it would install elevators at the Parkchester station as part of the MTA&#x27;s 2020–2024 Capital Program. In December 2022, the MTA announced that it would award a $146 million contract for the installation of eight elevators across four stations, including Parkchester. The work would include demolishing an existing escalator to make way for an elevator.

== Station layout ==

Parkchester is an express station with three tracks and two island platforms. The 6 stops on the outer local tracks while the &lt;6&gt; stops on the center express track. The 6 train serves the station at all times, and the &lt;6&gt; runs during weekdays in the peak direction. The next stop to the south is Hunts Point Avenue for express trains and St. Lawrence Avenue for local trains, while the next stop to the north is Castle Hill Avenue. There are 1950s-style mushroom-shaped lights at the end of the platforms and the staircases to the mezzanine are sheltered. Just north of the station is a signal tower which was used until the late 1990s, when a new master tower was created in Westchester Yard.

During weekdays, some 6 local trains terminate at Parkchester. All local trains end their runs at Parkchester during the PM rush hour, when the &lt;6&gt; express operates, while selected local trains terminate there during the AM rush hour and the evening. After discharging passengers on the northbound local track, terminating trains use the center track past switches north of the station as a pocket track to relay.

All trains continuing on the IRT Pelham Line north of this station make all subsequent stops, these stations are only served by the &lt;6&gt; in the peak direction when it is operating, and the 6 at all other times.

===Exit===
The station&#x27;s only exit is a mezzanine in the center of the Hugh Grant Circle, a traffic circle. It has a crossunder and windows in a simulated 12-pane pattern similar to those at Whitlock Avenue. The fare control is at street level and the room features a painting entitled &quot;Live The Dream&quot;. There is an escalator from fare control to the southbound platform, bypassing the mezzanine.

<text>Cabir (also known as Caribe, SybmOS/Cabir, Symbian/Cabir and EPOC.cabir) is the name of a computer worm developed in 2004 that is designed to infect mobile phones running Symbian OS. It is believed to be the first computer worm that can infect mobile phones. When a phone is infected with Cabir, the message &quot;Caribe&quot; is displayed on the phone&#x27;s display, and is displayed every time the phone is turned on. The worm then attempts to spread to other phones in the area using wireless Bluetooth signals.

Several firms subsequently released tools to remove the worm, the first of which was the Australian business TSG Pacific.

The worm can attack and replicate on Bluetooth enabled Series 60 phones. The worm tries to send itself to all Bluetooth enabled devices that support the &quot;Object Push Profile&quot;, which can also be non-Symbian phones, desktop computers or even printers. The worm spreads as a .sis file installed in the Apps directory. Cabir does not spread if the user does not accept the file transfer or does not agree with the installation, though some older phones would keep on displaying popups, as Cabir re-sent itself, rendering the UI useless until yes is clicked. 
Cabir is the first mobile malware ever discovered.

While the worm is considered harmless because it replicates but does not perform any other activity, it will result in shortened battery life on portable devices due to constant scanning for other Bluetooth enabled devices.

Cabir was named by the employees of Kaspersky Lab after their colleague Elena Kabirova.

Mabir, a variant of Cabir, is capable of spreading not only via Bluetooth but also via MMS. By sending out copies of itself as a .sis file over cellular networks, it can affect even users who are outside the 10m range of Bluetooth.
