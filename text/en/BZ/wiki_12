<text>Sunfire () is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Sunfire is a mutant and sometime member of the X-Men.

Sunfire is a Japanese mutant who can generate superheated plasma and fly. Not suited for teamwork due to his temperament and arrogance, Sunfire was briefly a member of the X-Men and has kept limited ties to the team since.

==Concept and creation==
Roy Thomas recalled that, during his first run on &quot;X-Men&quot;,I wanted to add a young Japanese or Japanese-American whose mother had been at Hiroshima or Nagasaki as a corresponding character to the X-Men, whose parents were, at that time, assumed to have been at the Manhattan Project. Stan [Lee, X-Men editor/co-creator] didn&#x27;t give me any good reason [for rejecting the character]—he just didn&#x27;t want to, I think... I didn&#x27;t bring it up again, but when I came back to the book, with Neal Adams, I created Sunfire, who is pretty much the character I had wanted to do some years earlier. I didn&#x27;t make him an X-Man right away. By that time, Stan gave me a little more free . In fact, he was included in &quot;Giant Size X-Men&quot; #1, along with Banshee, precisely because I had gone around creating some &#x27;international mutants,&#x27; with the goal of expanding the team at some time. I thought the X-Men shouldn&#x27;t all be white Americans.

Thomas later commented on the character&#x27;s costume &quot;I had Don Heck design the character from my verbal suggestion of a costume that was an embodiment of the imperial Japanese Rising Sun flag, as Japanese or Japanese-American.

In a future interview Thomas noted the unique mask of the character &quot;Don Heck gave him that mask — kind of a weird dragony kind of mask — it wasn&#x27;t just a standard mask.&quot;

==Publication history==

Created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Don Heck, Sunfire first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; #64 (January 1970).

In 1998, Marvel published the miniseries &quot;Sunfire and Big Hero Six&quot;, presenting Sunfire&#x27;s brief membership in a new superhero team sanctioned by the Japanese government.

Writer Rick Remender included Sunfire as a member of the &quot;Uncanny Avengers&quot;, starting with issue #5.

==Fictional character biography==
Shiro Yoshida was born in Agarashima, Japan. His mother suffered radiation poisoning due to exposure to the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima; as a result, Shiro was born as a mutant possessing solar radiation powers.

Shiro&#x27;s mother died of radiation poisoning when he was young. Shiro grew to hate the United States, despite the influence of his father, an ambassador to the United Nations who was more tolerant of the US. Shiro&#x27;s greedy uncle Tomo inspired him to become &quot;Sunfire&quot; and engage in a one-man battle against the U.S. As Sunfire, he attacked the United States Capitol and battled the X-Men, after which he witnessed Tomo murder his father; distraught, he killed Tomo and surrendered to the authorities.

Sunfire battled Namor the Sub-Mariner but then fought alongside him against the Dragon Lord. Sunfire also fought Iron Man but was abducted by the Mandarin and used to power one of the Mandarin&#x27;s machines. Once freed, he and Iron Man fought Ultimo.

Professor X recruited Sunfire to a new team of X-Men to rescue the originals from Krakoa the Living Island. However, after the mission, he rejected X-Men membership.

Although Sunfire has had one solo story in the anthology &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot;, Sunfire has appeared mainly in stories teamed with other characters:
* With Iron Man and the second Guardsman
* With the X-Men 
* Among the heroes summoned by the Grandmaster for the first Contest of Champions
* With the X-Men
* Alongside Cable, Wolverine, and the New Mutants
* Hawkeye, Namor, and Spider-Woman.
* With the X-Men, against the inhabitants of the Void
* With Gambit versus the Hand.

Sunfire becomes involved with the X-Men once again when Apocalypse kidnaps him, as Sunfire is one of , a group of unique mutants Apocalypse required to obtain reality-warping powers. Sunfire then became a member of the Mumbai branch of X-Corporation, a non-government organization devoted to the protection of mutant rights.

During the early story arcs of the latest edition of &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;, Sunfire attempts to combat the powerful villain known as Titannus, a reject of the Super-Skrull program who had made his way to Earth after being brainwashed by an alien race to serve as their ultimate weapon. Attempting to contain Titannus, Sunfire summons practically the entire Japanese army to confront him, but the powerful foe defeats them army with ease, and is only barely beaten by a new team that had been hastily assembled by Doctor Strange to combat this threat.
Later, it was revealed that Sunfire had worked with Rogue and Mystique back when Sunfire was still working with Tomo and Rogue was a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants. Also working with them was a girl called Blindspot, who had the power to erase and restore memories. The four were on a mission to steal the process to bond adamantium from Lord Dark Wind, the father of Lady Deathstrike.

Since Blindspot always erased her tracks once a contract ended, she wipes the minds of everyone involved so no one would remember her. Subsequently, Blindspot discovers Lord Dark Wind wanted all four dead for trying to steal his adamantium process. Realizing that the others would be in danger while having no memory of their mission, Blindspot went back to Japan to erase Lord Dark Wind&#x27;s memory. When she got there, she discovered that his daughter (who later became Deathstrike) had already killed him. Blindspot erased Deathstrike&#x27;s memories but, as Deathstrike was more machine than woman, Deathstrike was able to restore her own memories from an electronic backup. Deathstrike kidnapped Blindspot, who released a group photo of Sunfire, Rogue, and Mystique to attract their attention to save her. Rogue joined Sunfire, whose reputation had been ruined by the photograph, in Tokyo to discover why they were framed and who was responsible. The two ran into Lady Deathstrike who, in a heated battle, cut off Sunfire&#x27;s legs, leaving him in critical condition. Rogue surrendered to Deathstrike, who imprisoned the two. While imprisoned, Rogue met Blindspot, who restored Rogue&#x27;s memories and explained what was going on.
When Deathstrike discovers that the three were not responsible for stealing the adamantium, she attempted kill them to destroy any evidence of what she had done. A weak Sunfire asks Rogue to absorb his powers so she could properly battle Deathstrike. Rogue had previously lost the powers of Carol Danvers that she had taken and was hesitant. She worries that she could harm Sunfire, but Blindspot pushes her on Sunfire&#x27;s face, causing her to absorb all his powers and possibly killing him. With it, Rogue now also contains Sunfire&#x27;s personality, similar to how she also once had Danvers&#x27; personality within her. With Sunfire&#x27;s personality controlling her, Rogue seeks revenge on Deathstrike and severely injures the woman. The X-Men arrive in time to intervene, but Blindspot erases Rogue&#x27;s memories of being an X-Man causing her to see her teammates as her enemies. After a brief altercation, Rogue&#x27;s memories are restored and she tells the X-Men what had happened to Sunfire. They discover that his body is missing, leading some of the X-Men to believe he is somehow still alive.
Sunfire loses his powers before M-Day and his X-gene during that moment. It is revealed that Sunfire is rescued by a mysterious ninja group and taken to a hospital in Aspen. After being revived from his coma, the world&#x27;s leading specialist in prosthetic limbs, Masanori Kuzuya, offers him his services. Before the reasoning behind the rescue is revealed, Apocalypse appears and offers Sunfire the chance for vengeance, as well as the recovery of his lost limbs and power, in return for his service as one of Apocalypse&#x27;s new Horsemen. Sunfire accepts, but after being chained away and locked in a prison while listening to the tortured screams of Gazer (another of the new Horsemen), Sunfire tries to escape. Unable to leave Gazer to his fate, Sunfire attempts to free him. However, Gazer&#x27;s transformation to the Horseman &#x27;War&#x27; had already been completed and he attacks. Captured again, Sunfire is transformed into the Horseman of Famine. When Apocalypse launches his attack on the X-Men, Sunfire causes an intense feeling of hunger and weakness in the mutants and humans on the institute grounds. As he is fighting the X-Men, Havok shoots him down and Rogue, who recognizes him, catches him as he falls. He is taken to the Medical Lab and Emma Frost enters his mind to help him. When Apocalypse departs, he sends War to retrieve Famine, but Shiro breaks free from Apocalypse&#x27;s control and attacks War.

Sunfire is seen running off with the unconscious body of Gambit, like him a former X-Men turned Horseman. At the temple where Sunfire first took Gambit, Mister Sinister tells them, &quot;I am glad you both feel able to move on from the past... for I am your future!&quot;.

Sunfire is shown as a member of the Marauders still in the form of Famine. Alongside Gambit, Sunfire attacks Cable, who destroys Providence. He subsequently attacks an escaping Cannonball and Iceman, but is taken down by Cannonball and is taken prisoner. Though Cannonball and Iceman consider interrogating Sunfire for information as to who he is working for, Cannonball decides against it, knowing that Sunfire would never confess. Instead, Iceman neutralizes Sunfire&#x27;s artificial mutant abilities on a sub-atomic level using his own mutant abilities, while Cannonball fights him.

Sunfire is later held captive in the Blackbird and is rescued by his fellow Marauders. After being rescued by the Marauders, Sunfire joins fellow members Gambit, Prism, Blockbuster, Malice, Lady Mastermind, and Scalphunter when they travel to Cooperstown, Alaska to find the Messiah baby but instead come across the Purifiers and they come to blows. He then participates in a battle alongside the Marauders and Acolytes against the X-Men.

The next time Sunfire is seen, he is with Gambit, Vertigo, and Malice at Eagle Plaza, Texas, taking on Bishop for the Messiah baby. He is involved in the battle at Muir Island over the mutant baby&#x27;s fate. He is apparently knocked unconscious at some point, as it is revealed later that Bishop cauterized the wound of his severed arm by pressing it against Sunfire&#x27;s unconscious but still flaming form. After Xavier was injured by Bishop, everyone went their separate ways, including the surviving members of the Marauders.

===Avengers===
Years later, Wolverine finds a drunken and disheveled Shiro in a Tokyo alleyway. Shiro is offered a spot on the new Avengers Unity Squad, with Wolverine stating that Professor X always thought he had potential. He is initially hesitant, but agrees to join the Avengers after learning that the Red Skull has stolen Xavier&#x27;s brain.

Following a confrontation with the Celestial Exitar, who had come to judge Earth due to the machinations of the Apocalypse Twins, Sunfire was apparently killed by Kang the Conqueror, but he was able to use his power to transform his body into a state of pure energy that he could use to absorb most of the Celestials&#x27; energy.

Eight months after the events of &quot;Secret Wars,&quot; Sunfire is back to his normal appearance. With the Terrigen Mist killing mutants across the globe, he takes a group of mutant survivors from Asia and attempts to get them to safety, only to end up trapped in Weirdworld.

Sunfire later represented the Japanese government when he attended Black Panther&#x27;s meeting in the Eden Room of Avengers Mountain.

==Powers and abilities==
Sunfire is a mutant with the ability to absorb solar radiation, and convert it to ionize matter into a fiery plasma state which bursts into flame when exposed to oxygen. Referring to his plasma output as &quot;solar fire&quot;, he can release this energy through his hands as blasts of searing heat, deadly radiation, explosive concussive force, or simple flames. By ionizing the air around him, he can surround himself with an aura of heat intense enough to melt steel, or fly by focusing his aura downwards in a tight stream of ionized gas to propel him through the air like a rocket. Sunfire can see heat, by shifting his vision from visible light to infrared. Sunfire has the ability to form a psionic force field while using his plasma as protection from heat and radiation, both that of his own generation and that from outside sources. In a similar fashion to the Human Torch&#x27;s nova burst, Sunfire is capable of increasing his plasma output to temperatures around 1,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and emitting it as an omnidirectional blast.

Sunfire transferred his powers to Rogue to defeat Lady Deathstrike who had just cut off his legs. This (like Ms. Marvel before him) left him still a mutant but powerless. After his transformation into Famine, a Horseman of Apocalypse, his powers and legs were returned, and he could now also use them to create flashes of light that affected the sections of the human brain which control hunger, causing any people who saw his light flashes to feel as if they were starving. Due to further genetic enhancement from Apocalypse, Sunfire is also able to secrete a specialized bio-oxygen from his skin, which allows him to breathe and conjure his flames even in the vacuum of space.

Shiro also seems to be quite an accomplished martial artist. He has displayed impressive hand to hand skills on several occasions and stated that he didn&#x27;t need to employ his powers to defeat Hand ninjas. He is trained in karate, judo, and kendo (Japanese Samurai swordsmanship). He is also an expert in the combat use of his superhuman powers. He has at least peak human physical ability.

==Family==

Shiro Yoshida (Sunfire) is the brother of Leyu Yoshida, alias the superheroine Sunpyre, who shares his flame-based powers. He is also the cousin of Wolverine&#x27;s late fiancée Mariko Yashida and her half-brother the Silver Samurai.

Yashida and Yoshida seem to be different spellings of the same name. While in his first appearance Sunfire was called Shiro Yoshida, he story arc that introduced his cousin, Mariko, his name was spelled Yashida and this version of the name was carried on in Mariko&#x27;s next appearances.

==Reception==
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Sunfire 41st in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.
* In 2020, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Sunfire 2nd in their &quot;Marvel Comics: Ranking Every Member Of Big Hero 6 From Weakest To Most Powerful&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;===
In &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;, Japan was destroyed by Holocaust, one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse. Shiro, a survivor of the massacre, was captured and given to Maximus (the Horseman of Death), as a test subject for his experiments. Shiro&#x27;s powers were pushed to their limits, causing his whole body to be set aflame, injuring him as a result. Shiro was rescued by the X-Men and joined them, taking on the codename Sunfire. Sunfire wore a containment suit to control his powers, although he was constantly on fire. Haunted by the destruction of his nation, Sunfire joined Rogue&#x27;s task force of X-Men when they were sent to Chicago to fight Holocaust, who had begun a new series of Cullings. The character design of the original Sunfire as Famine (see above) is virtually identical to the Age of Apocalypse incarnation of the character.

After the regular reality&#x27;s X-Force crossed over into the Age of Apocalypse, Shiro was one of the few X-Men to return to prevent the destruction of Earth-616 by Archangel. Though he fought valiantly against the traitorous Iceman, seemingly killing him for his treachery, Shiro was killed while attempting to siphon energy from Holocaust&#x27;s weapon of mass destruction, though he managed to buy X-Force precious moments with his sacrifice.

===Age of X-Man===
In the Age of X-Man reality, Shiro Yoshida is the Civil Management Instructor of the 10th Year class within the Summers Institute Of Higher Learning, located in Winchester, NY.

===&quot;House of M&quot;===
In the &quot;House of M&quot; reality, Sunfire became the Emperor of Japan. Under his rule, the country had prospered, though the poverty levels were extremely high among the baseline human population. In secret, Sunfire was one of the masterminds of Project: Genesis, a project sanctioned by the Japan branch of S.H.I.E.L.D. with the goal of forcefully mutating baseline humans. When the S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives-in-training dubbed the Hellions investigated a terrorist attack, they discovered the existence of Project: Genesis and its link to Emperor Sunfire. Sunfire lied to the Hellions and told them that Project: Genesis&#x27;s purpose was to recycle organic waste into food for poor baseline humans.

===&quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;===
In &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;, a zombie version of Sunfire and Silver Samurai can be briefly seen slaughtering civilians, while the Silver Surfer travels the globe, as a result of Quicksilver being infected and thus able to spread the zombie plague all over the world. The zombie version of Wolverine traveled to Earth-Z, where at Marvel Zombies Return, seeks an uninfected Sunfire that battles Zombie Wolverine, but was killed instead.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel reality, Sunfire appears as a member of Alpha Flight. His power levels enhanced by Banshee, the Ultimate Marvel version of the Mutant Growth Hormone, he squares off against new X-Man recruit Firestar.

===Ultimate Universe===
During the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline, Maker remade Earth-6160 into his own image, reshaping its political status quo into a new world order. Sunfire is seen as the &quot;Sun Emperor&quot; of the Harada-Yoshida Alliance, a consolidated union of three clans that rule over &quot;Hi no Kuni&quot;, a regional power bloc which includes Japan&#x27;s territories. He appears alongside Silver Samurai and Viper as they attend an event in The City at Latveria as members of the Maker&#x27;s Council. When a clone army from the future attacks, they are among those that fight them. 

He is with the Alliance&#x27;s members when they attend a gathering following the death of Obadiah Stane. Emmanuel da Costa mentions to Howard Stark that Sunfire does not speak when his mask is on and that Viper speaks in his name as a intermediary during meetings, when answering Howard&#x27;s question on why Silver Samurai keeps him from interacting with Sunfire. Sunfire and the rest of the Alliance are among the Council&#x27;s members that meet after The City closes up with Maker, Kang, and Howard Stark still inside as they make plans to divide the North American Union among themselves.

<text>Everyman&#x27;s Library is a series of reprints of classic literature, primarily from the Western canon. It began in 1906. It is currently published in hardback by Random House. It was originally an imprint of J. M. Dent (itself later a division of Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson and presently an imprint of Orion Books), who continue to publish Everyman Paperbacks.

==History==
Everyman&#x27;s Library was conceived in 1905 by London publisher Joseph Malaby Dent, whose goal was to create a 1,000-volume library of world literature that was affordable for, and that appealed to, every kind of person, from students to the working classes to the cultural elite. Dent followed the design principles and to a certain extent the style established by William Morris in his Kelmscott Press. For this Dent asked the Monotype corporation to design a new typeface: Veronese was a remake of a foundry-face Dent had used before. Series 59 came out in 1912, and was made in the same style of the Golden Type, but with sharper slab serifs and cleaner lines. Now Dent was able to produce his texts with machines.

This old style was later replaced in 1935 by Eric Ravilious&#x27;s designs. Everyman&#x27;s Library books were pocket-sized hardcovers that sold initially for what was then the remarkably low price of a shilling apiece. The original U.S. distribution rights were granted to New York City publishers E. P. Dutton.

The name of the publication series was suggested by poet and editor Ernest Rhys, who was named head editor of the series initially, and asked to find a suitable name to encompass Dent&#x27;s goal. Rhys tried and discarded many ideas before recalling a quotation from the medieval play &quot;Everyman&quot; in which the character of Knowledge says to Everyman:
:&quot;Everyman,&quot;
:&quot;I will go with thee,&quot;
:&quot;and be thy guide,&quot;
:&quot;In thy most need&quot;
:&quot;to go by thy side.&quot;
This quotation appears on the title page of all volumes of Everyman&#x27;s Library and Everyman Paperbacks.

J. M. Dent and Company commenced the series in 1906 with an edition of James Boswell&#x27;s &quot;Life of Johnson&quot;, published with a quotation on the title page from the works of John Milton: &quot;A good book is the precious life-blood of a master-spirit, embalmed and treasured upon purpose to a life beyond life.&quot; In 1910, 500 books had been published under the Everyman trademark, and in 1956, fulfilling Dent&#x27;s original goal—the thousandth volume, Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, having been selected for the honour, was published.

By 1975, Dent&#x27;s vision had been well surpassed, as Everyman&#x27;s Library consisted of 994 titles published in 1,239 volumes.

Each book belonged to one of the following genres: Travel, Science, Fiction, Theology &amp; Philosophy, History, Classical, For Young People, Essays, Oratory, Poetry &amp; Drama, Biography, Reference, and Romance. The appropriate genre was printed inside and used to organise the periodically released lists of the series.
After ceasing publication of new titles in the 1970s, the hardback rights to Everyman&#x27;s Library were sold to the newly formed David Campbell Publishers in 1991 and relaunched with the support of the Random House Group in the United Kingdom and through Alfred A. Knopf (which had been acquired by Random House in 1960) in the United States, a move praised by many notable authors. Control of Everyman&#x27;s Library passed to US-based Random House in 2002, who continue to publish it under the Knopf Publishers imprint there and (albeit without changes) as Random House UK elsewhere.

J. M. Dent &amp; Sons was acquired by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson in 1988, itself acquired by the Orion Publishing Group in 1991, now both part of Hachette Livre (UK). Orion continues to publish the unrelated Everyman Paperbacks under the J. M. Dent imprint in the UK and via Charles E. Tuttle Co. in the US.

The current membership of the Honorary Editorial Committee includes Henry Louis Gates Jr., Cynthia Ozick and Simon Schama. Former committee members include Harold Bloom and Toni Morrison.

== &quot;Everyman&#x27;s Encyclopaedia&quot; ==

A notable addition to the library was a multi-volume encyclopedia, which was added to the range in 1913. Individual volumes could be purchased separately, enabling the set to be budgeted over time. The fifth edition was published in 1967, by which time it consisted of 12 volumes, containing 7763 pages.

The page size was , but as the printing was 8 point, a large amount of information was contained in each volume. As a volume only weighed about , it was considered a better size for use by children.

<doc id="728651" wikidata="Q4788569" url="?curid=728651" title="Area codes 314 and 557">
<text>Area codes 314 and 557 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) in the U.S. state of Missouri, serving the city of St. Louis and most of its inner-ring suburbs in neighboring St. Louis County. The numbering plan area is bordered to the west by area code 636, which serves St. Louis&#x27; outer suburbs to the west, south, and north. Across the Mississippi River to the east, 314 is adjacent to area code 618, which serves southern Illinois and most of Metro East. Area code 557 was added to the 314 numbering plan area on August 12, 2022, to form an overlay numbering plan.

==History==
When the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) created a universal North American telephone numbering plan for Operator Toll Dialing in 1947, and assigned the original North American area codes to numbering plan areas (NPAs), Missouri was divided into two NPAs, which received the area codes 314 and 816. Area code 314 identified the eastern part of the state, from the northeast corner of the state at the Illinois border along a southwestern line near Columbia and Jefferson City to the center of the state, and continuing southeast into the east side of the West Plains area to the Arkansas state line. The largest city of the area code was St. Louis on the Mississippi river in the east.

By 1995, the telephone subscriber base had experienced substantial growth, threatening the exhaustion of the numbering pool. Relief planning entailed the division of the numbering plan area to create a new area code, 573, for most areas outside of the St. Louis metropolitan area, which would retain area code 314. The area code split became effective at day end of January 7, 1996, with a permissive dialing period commencing until July 7, 1996, during which the new numbering plan area could be dialed with both area codes.

Although area code splits were intended as long-term solutions, within only two years, 314 was close to exhaustion once again due to the proliferation of cell phones, fax machines and pagers in St. Louis. As a result, 314 was reduced to include only the exchanges of Chestnut, Jefferson, Prospect, Flanders, Forest, Mission, Melrose, Webster Groves,
Parkview, Evergreen, Riverview, Ferguson, Overland, Ladue, Kirkwood, Sappington, Mehlville,
Oakville, Creve Coeur, Bridgeton, Hazelwood, Florissant, and Spanish Lake in the core of the St. Louis area. All other exchanges were reassigned to the new area code 636, effective May 22, 1999, with the permissive dialing period ending on February 26, 2000.

On October 24, 2000, the Missouri Public Service Commission announced plans to add a second area code for the 314 numbering plan area, creating an overlay, but postponed the implementation date (May 5, 2002) indefinitely on September 25, 2001, when the commission determined no immediate need for additional central office prefixes. Conservation measures, such as number pooling, mitigated the immediate need for relief. More than twenty years after that announcement, area code 557 was overlaid on August 12, 2022, as the available numbers in 314 neared exhaustion.

Prior to October 2021, area code 314 had telephone numbers assigned for the central office code 988. In 2020, &quot;988&quot; was designated nationwide as a dialing code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which created a conflict for exchanges that permit seven-digit dialing.

<text>David Christopher Lane (born April 29, 1956 in Burbank, California) is a professor of philosophy and sociology at Mt. San Antonio College, in Walnut, California. He is notable for his book &quot;The Making of a Spiritual Movement: The Untold Story of Paul Twitchell and Eckankar&quot; which exposed the origins of Eckankar and demonstrated the plagiarism of its founder, Paul Twitchell. He is also notable for introducing to a wider audience the teachings of Baba Faqir Chand, the Indian exponent of Surat Shabd Yoga from Hoshiapur in the book, &quot;The Unknowing Sage: The Life and Work of Baba Faqir Chand&quot;. Lane founded the journal, &quot;Understanding Cults and Spiritual Movements&quot; in the 1980s which featured critical studies of John-Roger Hinkins and Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, Adi Da, and Sathya Sai Baba. His most recent book, &quot;The Sound Current Tradition&quot; (2022) was on Nada Yoga and Surat Shabd Yoga in new religions and was published by Cambridge University Press. He also co-authored an annotated bibliography on the Radhasoami Tradition with Mark Juergensmeyer for Oxford University Press (2018).

==Education==
Lane has a PhD and an MA in the sociology of knowledge from the University of California at San Diego, where he was also a recipient of a Regents Fellowship. Additionally, he has an MA in History and Phenomenology of Religion from the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California and a BA from California State University, Northridge. Lane received his A.A. from Los Angeles Valley College and attended Notre Dame High School in his youth. Lane received an Honorary Doctorate (Honoris Causa) from the Dayalbagh Educational Institute, Agra, India (2021) for his work on the interface between neuroscience and consciousness.
==Career==
Lane was a lecturer in religious studies at California State University from 2001 to 2013 who specialized in the study of new religious movements including cults and the interface between science and religion.

Raised Catholic, Lane went on to be initiated in 1978 by Charan Singh (guru) of Radha Soami Satsang Beas. He later has become critical of some but not all of the teachings of Radha Soami Sant Mat. Lane has been a strict vegetarian since the age of 16 and in a recent interview on Skeptiko mentions that he meditates from 2 to 3 hours daily.

He previously taught at the University of California, San Diego, The California School of Professional Psychology, the University of Humanistic Studies, Palomar College, Mira Costa College, and the University of London and other academic institutions. He has given invited lectures at the London School of Economics, California State University, Fullerton. In 2010 was a keynote speaker at the SPIRCON conference at the Dayalbagh Educational Institute in Agra, India, featured in the book &quot;Spiritual Consciousness&quot;. In November 2014 Lane gave a plenary talk at QANSAS (Quantum and Nano Computing Systems and Applications) International Conference in Agra. The talk was entitled &quot;The Oceanic Metaphor : Meaning Equivalence (M.E.), Probability Theory, and The Virtual Simulation Hypothesis of Consciousness.&quot; This talk was published as the book, &quot;The Oceanic Metaphor&quot;. On October 12, 2015, Lane was the keynote speaker at California State University, Fullerton, sponsored by the Sociology Department, on the topic of the illusory nature behind religious visions and the Chandian Effect which was published as a book. Lane, along with Mark Juergensmeyer was the plenary speaker on August 24, 2018, at the Dayalbagh Educational Institute for the 200th birth anniversary of Shiv Dayal Singh, the founder of Radhasoami.

In an interview in the &quot;San Diego Reader&quot; published on June 22, 1995, Lane complained about receiving death threats from defenders of several new religious movements or cults. He has also been involved in a number of lawsuits due to his critical stance of these groups.

==Personal==
David Lane is married to Andrea Diem (b. 1965), who is also a Professor of Philosophy at Mt. San Antonio. They have two sons, Shaun (b. 2000) and Kelly (b. 2006). Lane won the World Bodysurfing Contest in 1999 and the International Bodysurfing Contest eight times (1997, 1998, 2000, 2004, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016). Lane is a strict vegan.

<doc id="728656" wikidata="Q3259674" url="?curid=728656" title="Lorrin A. Thurston">
<text>Lorrin Andrews Thurston (July 31, 1858 – May 11, 1931) was a Hawaiian lawyer, politician, and businessman. Thurston played a prominent role in the revolution that overthrew the Hawaiian Kingdom to replace Queen Liliuokalani with the Republic of Hawaii, with discreet US support for which Congress much later apologized. He published the &quot;Pacific Commercial Advertiser&quot; (a forerunner of the present-day &quot;Honolulu Star-Advertiser&quot;), and owned other enterprises. From 1906 to 1916, he and his network lobbied with national politicians to create a national park to preserve the Hawaiian volcanoes.

==Family life==
He was born on July 31, 1858, in Honolulu, Hawaii. His father was Asa Goodale Thurston and mother Sarah Andrews. On his father&#x27;s side he was grandson of Asa and Lucy Goodale Thurston, who were in the first company of American Christian missionaries to the Hawaiian Islands in 1820. On his mother&#x27;s side, he was also the grandson of another early missionary, Lorrin Andrews. His father was speaker of the house of representatives of the Kingdom of Hawaii but died when Lorrin was only a year and a half old in December 1859. He then moved to Maui with his mother. 

He was fluent in the Hawaiian language and gave himself the Hawaiian nickname &quot;Kakina&quot;.
In 1872, he attended Oahu College, where he played baseball with the sons of Alexander Cartwright (who invented the modern game). He was expelled shortly before graduation. After working as a translator for a law firm and clerk at the Wailuku Sugar Company, he attended law school at Columbia University. He returned to Honolulu in 1881 and became partners in a law firm with William Owen Smith.

He married Margaret Clarissa &quot;Clara&quot; Shipman (daughter of missionary William Cornelius Shipman (1824–1861) from Hilo, Hawaii, and sister of businessman William Herbert Shipman) on February 26, 1884. They had a son Robert Shipman Thurston on February 1, 1888. Margaret died in childbirth on May 5, 1891 (as did the infant).
On April 5, 1893, Lorrin Thurston married Harriet Elvira Potter of Saint Joseph, Michigan. They had a daughter Margaret Carter (the mother of Thurston Twigg-Smith) in 1895, and a son Lorrin Potter Thurston in 1899.
Lorrin Andrews Thurston died on May 11, 1931. In 1919, Robert Thurston married Evelyn M. Scott, and Margaret Carter married William Twigg-Smith.

==Work==
Lorrin Thurston was influential in both the political arena and the business world of Hawaii.

===Politics===
He followed his father and became a member of the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1886.
Thurston inherited the conservative thinking of the missionaries, which put him at odds with Hawaiian royalty as well as immigrants such as Greek hotelier George Lycurgus whose lifestyles were filled with gambling and liquor. The Missionary Party would change its name to the Reform Party in 1887, as it grew to include business owners.
In July 1887 Thurston authored what is called the &quot;Bayonet Constitution&quot; because it was imposed under threat by the Honolulu Rifle Company militia. It limited the executive power of the monarch King Kalākaua. Thurston became the powerful Interior Minister, with Englishman William Lowthian Green as minister of finance, as the old cabinet of Walter M. Gibson was ousted. Voting rights and membership of the legislature were based on property ownership, resulting in effective control by wealthy Americans and Europeans.
He served in the cabinet until June 17, 1890, when he was replaced by Charles N. Spencer.

Queen Liliuokalani became monarch in 1891 and tried to seize more power with a new constitution. In 1892 Thurston led the Annexation Club, later adopting the title Committee of Safety, which planned for making Hawaii a territory of the United States. In 1893 the Committee of Safety was supported by the U.S. Military in an overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom, and the resulting Provisional Government of Hawaii was controlled by Thurston&#x27;s committee.
Thurston headed the commission sent to Washington, D.C., to negotiate with Benjamin Harrison for American annexation. Liliuokalani and Crown Princess Victoria Kaiulani also traveled to Washington to claim the new government did not have the support of the majority of the Hawaiian population. As news spread of the force used, the proposed treaty met opposition and was not ratified. A century later in the Apology Resolution of 1993, the U.S. Congress controversially apologized for the involvement of the United States Marine Corps in the overthrow, and the controversy continues to modern times.

In March 1893 Grover Cleveland became president, and disavowed the treaty. Thurston helped draft another constitution, and the Republic of Hawaii was declared on July 4, 1894. He appointed Sanford B. Dole to the office of President of the Republic. A series of abortive revolts called the Wilcox rebellions had little public support, and were defeated during this period. In 1897 William McKinley became president and Thurston&#x27;s commission again lobbied for annexation. The Spanish–American War in April 1898 increased American interest in the Pacific, due to battles in the Philippines. 
By July 1898 the annexation formed the Territory of Hawaii and Thurston retired from political office to run his business affairs.

===Business===

In 1898 he purchased the &quot;Pacific Commercial Advertiser&quot; newspaper (forerunner of the present-day &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot;).
As principal owner and publisher after 1900, he promoted the sugar and pineapple industries. He headed the Hawaiian Promotion Committee (which evolved into the Hawaii Visitors &amp; Convention Bureau), but objected to the hula which he claimed was &quot;suggestive&quot; and &quot;indecent&quot;. 
His fortunes rose considerably as a result of the 1898 annexation by the United States, since it removed all duties from shipments to the largest market. Thurston is credited with expanding Hawaii&#x27;s sugarcane plantations and railroads and bringing the first electric street cars to Honolulu. 
Following World War I he called for government restrictions on Japanese-language schools, later ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. Thurston put out a special edition to support the fight to ban billboards in Hawaii. He worked with Wallace Rider Farrington and Alexander Hume Ford to hold a world conference of newspaper editors.

He was also a volcano enthusiast, starting in his childhood exploring Haleakalā on Maui. He would act as an informal tour guide for visitors to the summit, and used oral history to estimate the time of its last eruption. In 1891, he bought and expanded the Volcano House hotel at the rim of the active Kīlauea volcano on the island of Hawaii. Thurston commissioned a cyclorama of Kīlauea which he displayed in his travels to the mainland, including the Chicago World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893 and the California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894 in San Francisco.
Thurston eventually made peace with George Lycurgus, who had been an insurgent against Thurston&#x27;s government, and sold him the Volcano House in 1902.
He also became friends with early volcanologist Dr. Thomas Jaggar in 1909 and raised money to fund the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory in 1912. He used his newspaper to promote the national park idea and convinced the territorial legislature to fund a group of congressmen to visit Haleakalā and Kīlauea in 1907. The trip included a dinner cooked over active lava vents. He hosted a visit by the Secretary of the Interior James Rudolph Garfield in 1908, and another congressional visit in 1909. He convinced Governor Walter F. Frear to introduce a resolution supporting the idea, and formed a survey team to propose exact boundaries. His newspaper printed endorsements of the park by President Theodore Roosevelt (a classmate at Columbia), conservationist John Muir, and powerful senator Henry Cabot Lodge.
In 1913 he explored a lava tube in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park that is named after him. The park was finally formed in 1916.

He added a preface and published a second edition of his grandmother&#x27;s book on early missionary life in May 1921.
His memoirs were published in a limited edition (along with those of Sanford Dole) after his death in 1931 by his newspaper.

The newspaper business was run by his son Lorrin Potter Thurston, whose policy of using the term &quot;Jap&quot; during World War II pleased the military, but not local readers of Japanese descent. After the war readership declined, until its hostile take-over in 1962 by Lorrin&#x27;s grandson Thurston Twigg-Smith who changed to a more moderate editorial line. In 1992 it was sold to Gannett Company as the next generation of the family had no interest in running the paper. Twigg-Smith wrote a book about the revolution and the role of his grandfather in 1998, and criticizing the modern Hawaiian Sovereignty movement.
In 1966, a chapel at Punahou School designed by Vladimir Ossipoff was named after Robert Shipman Thurston, Jr. of the class of 1941 who disappeared in World War II.

==Legacy==
Thurston&#x27;s legacy is preserved throughout the islands. On Oahu, the Thurston name serves as a marker in many places, including a street named after Thurston in the Punchbowl neighborhood and the Thurston Memorial Chapel on the Punahou Campus. Others include Thurston Lava Tube at the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island.

In the 2009 film &quot;Princess Kaiulani&quot;, Thurston was portrayed by Barry Pepper.

<text>James Proudstar, known first as Thunderbird and then as Warpath, is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. Proudstar first appears as the second Thunderbird in &quot;New Mutants&quot; #16 (June 1984).

Blaming the X-Men for the death of his brother Thunderbird, Proudstar joins the Hellions, a group of young mutants led by Emma Frost. He later becomes a longtime member of the militant X-Men offshoot X-Force.

Proudstar is an Apache and one of the few Native American superheroes in Marvel Comics. His powers are superhuman strength, speed, and flight.

Warpath appeared in the 2014 film, &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;, portrayed by Booboo Stewart.

==Publication history==
Proudstar first appears as the second Thunderbird in &quot;New Mutants&quot; #16 (June 1984), created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Sal Buscema. The character initially appears as an antagonist of the New Mutants and the X-Men, but eventually joins the New Mutants in issue #99 of that series. The character appears regularly as a member of that team for most of the duration of the title.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
James Proudstar was born on the Apache reservation at Camp Verde, Arizona. As a child, he once visited the roadside carnival that employed Chondu the Mystic and that Tabitha Smith also attended and had his fortune read by Destiny. He was targeted by the geneticist Edwin Martynec secretly researching radiation mutation who was finally foiled by his brother John Proudstar and his friend reporter.

His brother John is the mutant Thunderbird and a member of the X-Men. John is killed on one of the team&#x27;s missions, and James blames the X-Men&#x27;s founder Professor X for his brother&#x27;s death.

===Operating as Thunderbird===
Seeking revenge for his brother&#x27;s death, James is recruited for Emma Frost&#x27;s Hellions. As a Hellion, James clashes with the New Mutants and Kitty Pryde, but to his chagrin, Frost feels they are not ready to take on the adult X-Men. James defies Frost&#x27;s orders, dons his brother&#x27;s costume, and kidnaps former X-Man Banshee to draw the team to the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, where John was killed. However, when the opportunity to kill Professor X arrives, James finds he has too many doubts about how John joined the X-Men. James is reconciled with the X-Men; Professor X offers him membership in the New Mutants, but he declines out of loyalty to his friends in the Hellions.

Months later, James leaves the Hellions and returns home to his family&#x27;s reservation. Cable makes him another offer to join the New Mutants but he turns it down. After a meeting in New York City, James returns home to find his entire tribe murdered. Finding a Hellfire mercenary&#x27;s mask at the scene, James deduces that Emma Frost committed the act to punish him for leaving the team.

===Operating as Warpath===
James joins the New Mutants, hoping to track down the Hellions and gain revenge. The New Mutants cut ties with the X-Men and become the militant adventurers X-Force, and James changes his codename to Warpath. With the team, he fights the likes of Toad&#x27;s Brotherhood of Mutants, and Weapon P.R.I.M.E. As a member of X-Force, James becomes more calm and controlled and strikes up a close friendship with his teammate Theresa Rourke Cassidy. Despite his strong attraction to her, Theresa only sees James as a friend. In a meeting with Emma Frost, she swears she wasn&#x27;t involved with the deaths of his tribesmen.

Warpath meets Risque, who helps James with his confidence, and the two begin a love affair. However, Risque is being blackmailed by Sledge, and she drugs Warpath and brings him to his lair. Sledge&#x27;s partner, the Vanisher, has disappeared in the Darkforce dimension, while teleporting. Sledge reveals to James that his enhanced senses would allow him to survive in this alternate dimension without going insane. James locates and rescues the Vanisher, who is being held captive by natives of the Darkforce Dimension, and in turn Sledge gives information on one of his tribesman, Michael Whitecloud, whom James had presumed deceased. Whitecloud tells him that Stryfe, X-Force&#x27;s adversary, was behind the killing of his tribe. James goes to Hell to gain revenge but is returned to the living world by Blackheart. When James finds out Risque&#x27;s involvement, he ends their relationship.

After X-Force&#x27;s disintegration, Warpath joins the Mumbai branch of the international mutant agency X-Corporation. His new team is a mix of old and new friends: Feral, Sunfire, and Thornn. He stays there for a while, helping to save Professor X&#x27;s life.

Cable and Domino enlist Warpath&#x27;s help against the Skornn. After Cable kills the demon once again, the X-Force disbands.

Warpath is one of the few mutants to retain his powers after the events of Decimation. He begins living in the Mutant camp at the X-Mansion.

Shortly afterwards, he joins the X-Men at Professor X&#x27;s request. Warpath has a bond of sorts with fellow X-Men Hepzibah; Hepzibah remarks that his presence has helped her mourn her loss of Corsair. Together, they confront one of the X-Mansion&#x27;s guardian Sentinels when Caliban, a long time X-Men ally, runs onto the grounds. Warpath enters the Morlock tunnels along with Hepzibah, Storm, and Caliban, to investigate the Morlocks&#x27; increased activity, which has included the capture of X-Men ward Leech. They see Warpath&#x27;s name written on a Morlock wall, along with the names of the other X-Men. After the Morlock encounter, Hepzibah and Warpath begin a relationship.

Warpath rejoins X-Force as they search a Cooperstown hospital to pick up the trail of the fugitive Cable. As X-Force dispatches the remaining Reavers, Caliban sacrifices himself to save Warpath by intercepting bullets meant for him. Warpath and the rest of X-Force are charged with taking down Predator X.

Warpath, Hepzibah, and Iceman meet up with Archangel in San Francisco, California. All four are caught in the effects of an illusion, created by Martinique Jason, which has transformed the city into a hippie paradise. Warpath (calling himself &quot;Running Sun&quot;) and the others are sent by Jason to confront Cyclops and Emma Frost. After Emma breaks through Jason&#x27;s illusion, Warpath and the others return to normal. They begin to reestablish the X-Men organization in San Francisco.

Warpath is one of the founding members of the new X-Force, Cyclops&#x27;s covert wetwork team, charged with finding and eliminating Purifiers cells. James joins out of a desire for revenge for the death of Caliban at the hands of the Purifiers. During X-Force&#x27;s encounter with the Purifiers, James comes across Eli Bard attacking X-23; after rescuing her, Eli swears a personal vendetta against him. Since the team is not allowed to contact anyone from the outside world, he cannot be with his girlfriend, Hepzibah.

James takes a break from duty to make peace with the deaths he has caused and to visit his brother&#x27;s grave. En route, his truck is destroyed by the Demon Bear. He is badly beaten before being rescued by Ghost Rider. After defeating the Demon Bear with the aid of Ghost Rider, he learns that this creature was created when the animal spirits of his people were disturbed. They tell James that Eli Bard has dug up Thunderbird, Caliban, and everyone else buried there.

When Surge, Hellion, and Boom-Boom are kidnapped, Warpath and the X-Force attempt to save them but are teleported off to the future to find Cable and Hope Summers. Arriving in the future, X-Force is ambushed by a future version of Deadpool, who leads them to Cable. Eventually they come across Stryfe&#x27;s Celestial city, learning he is in control of that era. After his forces are defeated, Stryfe kidnaps Hope and Warpath, taking them back to his fortress where he tortures James. After the final battle against Stryfe, James flies Domino and X-23 back where they first appeared in the future.

Warpath is caught up in the Necrosha events when his Blackbird crashes after a lightning strike. Making it to shore, the group encounters a resurrected Pyro and Berzerker. After taking them out, James is confronted by his ex-girlfriend, Risque, where she pleads with him to get away before she is controlled again by the T-O Virus. He is rescued by Archangel, who informs him this is Eli Bard&#x27;s doing. They meet up with Cyclops and are confronted by Selene&#x27;s Inner Circle. During the battle, Eli takes on Warpath, who wants the knife responsible for creating the Demon Bear. James is kidnapped by Selene&#x27;s Inner Circle and taken to Genosha. There he fights and kills his deceased brother John. With the help of ancient rituals from his tribe and Selene&#x27;s knife, James stabs Selene in the heart and frees his brother&#x27;s soul at last. After the battle, James quits X-Force with Wolverine, claiming that he &quot;has made his peace&quot;.

James sides with Cyclops in the Schism.

After working with War Machine to stop a war in Eastern Europe, Warpath&#x27;s teammate Jubilee is captured by vampires. Warpath and the rest of this X-Squad have been attacking vampire hordes trying to find their friend.

Warpath appears as a target for the newly revamped Weapon X Program and is opted to join Old Man Logan&#x27;s new team.

Warpath is among the mutants residing on Krakoa. Following Thunderbird rescuing some of his people from some Heritage Initiative operatives led by Edwin Martynec where they were funded by Orchis, Warpath came through the Krakoan Gate that was planted on the Apache reservation and meets his grandmother Lozen.

==Powers and abilities==
===Physical characteristics===
Warpath is in height and weighs .

===Physical capabilities===
Warpath is a mutant who possesses superhuman physical ability in virtually all areas.

He possesses superhuman strength. The air pressure from one of his claps causes a Sentinel to collapse. He has even managed to hold his own in a direct fight against the Juggernaut.

He possesses superhuman resistance to injury, at least enough to withstand short-range gunfire, grenade explosions, and direct telekinetic attack from Exodus. He also repairs, and regenerates damaged and destroyed tissue much faster than a normal human, as well as revives and recuperates from exhaustion and fatigue much faster than a normal human.

He possesses superhuman agility and flexibility. He can &quot;move with the grace an Olympic gold-medalist would envy&quot; and &quot;swim with the ease of a porpoise.&quot;

His power of flight was discovered by his one-time mentor and team leader Peter Wisdom, who analyzed his mutation after the High Evolutionary devolved and re-evolved all mutants on Earth, and Wisdom forced James to incorporate this ability in his fighting style. This power was ignored for a while, as writer Ed Brubaker did not understand how Warpath&#x27;s speed and strength would allow it. However, Warpath&#x27;s fighting style in the &quot;Messiah Complex&quot; storyline showed his flight powers, and &quot;X-Force&quot; shows him flying for long distances. It has since been suggested by writer Christopher Yost that Warpath felt &quot;rather embarrassed by the whole flying thing.&quot;

Warpath&#x27;s senses – particularly sight, smell, and hearing – are enhanced to levels beyond the capabilities of a normal human. He is able to see with perfect clarity at much greater distances than an ordinary human, even in near-total darkness. His hearing is similarly heightened, enabling him to clearly hear sounds beyond the range of ordinary human hearing and to hear sounds that they can detect but at much greater distances.

After nearly getting killed by Reignfire, Warpath experienced an increase in senses and speed that allowed him to perform feats he had previously not been aware he was capable of. For example, he can run at high speeds up to at least for long distances and quickly climb building walls by digging his hands and feet into the bare concrete. He can even evade weapon fire with rapid reflexes and reactions.

In new publishing coinciding along Marvel&#x27;s new &quot;ResurrXion&quot; event, Warpath has showcased regenerative abilities able to recover from mild to serious injuries inflicted upon him by new Weapon X cyborgs.

===Training===
Warpath is well versed in hand-to-hand combat, which is enhanced by his superhuman reflex/reaction rate and eye/ear-hand/foot coordination. He was trained in unarmed combat under the guidance of Emma Frost. He gained extensive training in the use of the staff by his long-time teammate Shatterstar, whom he eventually matched in a record time of only a dozen tries. He wields a pair of bowie knives composed of vibranium, given to him by Storm, with which he has proved to be highly proficient.

James is also a skilled hunter and tracker in his native Apache tradition.

===Supernatural capabilities===
Ghost Rider activated limited Apache shaman abilities within James to help him fight the Demon Bear. He could perceive the creature&#x27;s wounds and the resulting spirit energy when it was destroyed.

==Reception==
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Thunderbird and Warpath 62nd in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.
* In 2018, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Warpath 9th in their &quot;X-Force: 20 Powerful Members&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
In the &quot;Ultimate Comics: X-Men&quot; storyline, James Proudstar is a member of the mutant liberation in the Southwest.

===What If===
James Proudstar appears in the &quot;What If&quot; story &quot;What If the X-Men Died on their First Mission?&quot; Following the death of his brother and the X-Men on Krakoa, he joins Beast&#x27;s hastily assembled mutant team – consisting of himself, Theresa Cassidy (who named herself Banshee in honor of her late father), Rahne Sinclair, Namorita, Scarlet Witch, and her brother Quicksilver – to combat Count Nefaria and his Ani-Men. James joined only to kill Professor X, whom he held responsible for his brother&#x27;s death. However, he avoids John&#x27;s fate in the mainstream comics and, finally acknowledging that his brother laid down his life to save others, joins the new X-Men team afterwards.

<text>The [[Kyocera]] QCP-6035 was one of the first smartphones to appear in the American market, released in January 2001, one of the first devices to combine a PDA with a mobile phone. Its predecessor was the Qualcomm pdQ (800 and 1900) released in 1999, built by Qualcomm&#x27;s handset division (Qualcomm Personal Electronics), which Kyocera acquired in 2000.
==Software and integration==
The phone appears to have a dual-software nature, with the cellphone firmware operating independently (though available through an interface) from the Palm OS system. Like most modern smartphones, the phone operations can be off while the Palm operates, and vice versa. The systems are sufficiently integrated to pass important messages and commands to each other, though the phone&#x27;s operating parameters (settings, phone book, speed and voice dial, call history etc.) are configured via the Palm OS system.
==Physical systems==
The phone has physical buttons for cellphone use, arranged on a flip which covers the Palm buttons, Graffiti area, and part of the screen. The upper part of the screen shows the phone system display when the flip is closed; when the flip is open the screen switches to Palm operation. With the flip closed, phone operations are performed via the flip buttons and a side thumb wheel.
==Technical specifications==
The Palm OS system benefits from the integrated cell phone by utilizing it as an attached modem. This allows the Palm to take advantage of any IP-based Palm applications, such as email clients and web browsers. The phone can also be used as an external modem for a computer via the HotSync cradle.

The phone can receive SMS messages, but earlier firmware revisions did not come with a mechanism to send them. It is WAP capable, but not MMS capable.

The 6035 comes with 8 MB of Palm memory and is not expandable. The display resolution of the 6035 is 160x160 pixels. It can perform HotSync and IR communication just as a normal Palm.
==Awards==
The QCP6035 won several awards at the time, including:
* CDMA Development Group&#x27;s 3G Industry Achievement Award for Subscriber Technology, 2001
* MobileFocus Award in the mobile phone category at the PC Expo show, 2001
==Versions and successor==
Different versions of the phone were made available for different CDMA wireless networks, eventually being released in Canada on Bell Mobility in late 2001. (It was never made for GSM).

The successor to the 6035 was the Kyocera 7135, released in 2003.

<doc id="728682" wikidata="Q3404865" url="?curid=728682" title="Thomas Sherlock">
<text>Thomas Sherlock (167818 July 1761) was a British divine who served as a Church of England bishop for 33 years. He is also noted in church history as an important contributor to Christian apologetics.

==Life==
Born in London, he was the son of the Very Reverend William Sherlock, Dean of St Paul&#x27;s. He was educated at Eton College and St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge. In 1704 he succeeded his father as Master of the Temple, where he was very popular.

Sherlock died in July 1761, and is buried in the churchyard of All Saints Church, Fulham, Middlesex. Much of his ancestral and earned wealth passed to the Gooch baronets who took Sherlock for many generations thereafter in tribute; his picture hanging in Benacre Hall, their purchased home in the period of his death.

==Career==
In 1714 he became master of his old college at Cambridge and later the university&#x27;s vice-chancellor, whose privileges he defended against Richard Bentley. In 1715, he was appointed Dean of Chichester.

He took a prominent part in the Bangorian controversy against Benjamin Hoadly. Sherlock became Bishop of Bangor in 1728. He was translated to Salisbury in 1734 (where he was admitted as ex officio Chancellor of the Order of the Garter on 20 February 1738); and in 1748 he was raised to London, where he was sworn of the Privy Council. He held the see of London until his death. 

Sherlock was a capable administrator and cultivated friendly relations with Dissenters. In Parliament he gave good service to his old schoolfellow, Robert Walpole, Prime Minister of Great Britain.

==Writings==

He published against Anthony Collins&#x27;s deistic &quot;Grounds of the Christian Religion&quot; a volume of sermons entitled &quot;The Use and Intent of Prophecy in the Several Ages of the World&quot; (1725); and in reply to Thomas Woolston&#x27;s &quot;Discourses on the Miracles&quot; he wrote a volume entitled &quot;The Tryal of the Witnesses of the Resurrection of Jesus&quot; (1729), which soon ran through fourteen editions. His &quot;Pastoral Letter&quot; (1750) on the late earthquakes had a circulation of many thousands, and four or five volumes of &quot;Sermons&quot; which he published in his later years (1754–1758) were also at one time highly esteemed. Jane Austen, wrote to her niece Anna in 1814, &quot;I am very fond of Sherlock&#x27;s Sermons, prefer them to almost any.&quot;

A collected edition of his works, with a memoir, in five volumes, by Thomas Smart Hughes, appeared in 1830.

Sherlock&#x27;s &quot;Tryal of the Witnesses&quot; is generally understood by scholars such as Edward Carpenter, Colin Brown and William Lane Craig, to be a work that the Scottish philosopher David Hume had probably read, and to which Hume offered a counter viewpoint in his empiricist arguments against the possibility of miracles.

Sherlock also wrote a respected work entitled &quot;A Discourse Concerning the Divine Providence&quot;, in which he argues that the Sovereignty and Providence of God are unimpeachable.

==Apologetics==
Since the Deist controversy Sherlock&#x27;s argument for the evidences of the resurrection of Jesus Christ has continued to interest later Christian apologists such as William Lane Craig and John Warwick Montgomery. His place in the history of apologetics has been classified by Ross Clifford as belonging to the legal or juridical school of Christian apologetics.

<text>The Llano River ( ) is a tributary of the Colorado River, about long, in Texas in the United States. It drains part of the Edwards Plateau in Texas Hill Country northwest of Austin.

Two spring-fed tributaries, the North and South Llano, stretch across the otherwise arid lands of West Texas before merging just east of the small town of Junction, in Kimble County, forming the head of the Llano River proper. The Llano River runs generally east-northeast through the rolling limestone terrain of the Edwards Plateau as it flows through Kimble County and across rural Mason County, passing to the south of the town of Mason, Texas. Continuing in an easterly direction, the river carves its way through the Llano Uplift, a roughly circular geologic dome of Precambrian rock, primarily granite, located in Central Texas. Flowing through Llano County, the river passes to the north of Enchanted Rock and flows through the town of Llano, Texas. Northeast of Llano, it turns sharply to the southeast, joining the Colorado from the northwest as an arm of Lake Lyndon B. Johnson, about southeast of Llano at Kingsland.

This river is one of the few popular fly fishing destinations in the state of Texas, and contains Guadalupe bass, the state fish of Texas. The Llano also contains largemouth bass, Longnose gar, Spotted gar, and various sunfish.

The river is also associated with the legend of the Los Almagres Mine. Translated from Spanish, &quot;almagre&quot; means red ochre. In 1756, the lieutenant-general of Texas (then still a province of New Spain), Don Bernardo de Miranda, launched an expedition from San Fernando (San Antonio), to ascertain whether rumors of rich mineral deposits to the north were true. As the legend goes, Miranda came across a cave in the side of a hill in the vicinity of the Rio de las Chanas (Llano River), and reported astounding quantities of silver to be found within.
==2018 Flood==
On October 9, 2018, a cold front swept through the hill country where it encountered the remnants of Hurricane Sergio. Mason County saw 10&quot; of rain and Lake Travis saw a 3&#x27; rise. In Junction, Texas, the flow rate increased from its normal rate of 111 cubic feet per second (cfs) to 118,000 cfs.

Less than a week later the remnants of Hurricane Willa rolled into the area, followed by another front, on October 16, 2018. Upwards of a foot of rain fell in Llano, Texas. The flow rate of the Llano River, in Llano, had increased from its normal rate of 150 cfs to 275,000 cfs. The river crested at 39.9 feet, its highest level in more than 80 years and just 1.5 feet below its record high of 41.5 ft, set in 1935. The high flow rate caused the RM 2900 bridge in Kingsland to collapse and what used to be a two-minute drive across town became a 40-50 minute drive.

The flooding was so intense that the Colorado River began to flow backwards briefly.

The flood waters entered into the Colorado River and flood gates on every dam on the Texas Highland Lakes were opened. Lake Travis rose 25 feet in 24 hours and water flowed into it at a rate of 375,000 cfs. The flooding raised the turbidity of City of Austin&#x27;s water supply (which is sourced exclusively from the Colorado River) to untenable levels, forcing the city to issue a seven-day boil water notice

By December 2018 payments under the National Flood Insurance Program had exceeded $22 million 

In the end, two people died as a result of the floods. The RM 2900 bridge in Kingsland was rebuilt less than a year later.

<doc id="728685" wikidata="Q1107846" url="?curid=728685" title="Hurricane Fran">
<text>Hurricane Fran caused extensive damage in the United States in early September 1996. The sixth named storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season, Fran developed from a tropical wave near Cape Verde on August 23. Due to nearby Hurricane Edouard, the depression remained disorganized as it tracked westward, though it eventually intensified into Tropical Storm Fran on August 27. While heading west-northwestward, Fran steadily strengthened into a hurricane on August 29, but weakened back to a tropical storm on the following day. On August 31, Fran quickly re-intensified into a hurricane. By September 2, Fran began to parallel the islands of the Bahamas and slowly curved north-northwestward. Early on September 5, Fran peaked as a Category 3 hurricane. Thereafter, Fran weakened slightly, before it made landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina early on September 6. The storm rapidly weakened inland and was only a tropical depression later that day. Eventually, Fran curved east-northeastward and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Ontario early on September 9.

In Florida, high tides capsized a boat with five people aboard, though all were rescued. No significant effects were reported in Georgia. The outer bands of Fran produced high winds and light to moderate rainfall in South Carolina. As a result, numerous trees and powerlines were downed, which damaged cars, left over 63,000 people without electricity. Large waves in North Carolina caused significant coastal flooding in some cities. Overall, 27 fatalities and $5 billion (1996 USD) in damage were attributed to Fran. Fran is also the most recent hurricane to make landfall in the Carolinas as a major hurricane.

==Meteorological history==

Hurricane Fran originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa, entering the Atlantic Ocean, on August 22, 1996. Not long after moving over water, convective banding features formed around a developing area of low pressure. Ships in the vicinity of the system confirmed that a surface circulation had formed later that day. After further development, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories on the system around 8:00 am EDT on August 23, designating it as Tropical Depression Six. At this time, the depression was situated to the southeast of the Cape Verde Islands. Over the following several days, little development took place as the system moved westward at . The westward motion and lack of development were attributed to the low-level inflow from Hurricane Edouard located roughly west-northwest of the depression.

By August 26, the depression had become significantly disorganized, prompting the NHC to issue their initial final advisory on the system. Despite this, the following day, satellite imagery depicted an improved circulation, leading to the re-issuance of advisories. However, post-storm analysis indicated that the system maintained tropical depression status during the 24‑hour span. During the afternoon of August 27, the depression intensified further, becoming a tropical storm and receiving the name Fran. At this time, Tropical Storm Fran was located about east of the Lesser Antilles. Following a similar track as Edouard, the newly named storm maintained a west-northwest track while gaining strength.
Following the development of deep convection around Fran&#x27;s center of circulation on August 29, the NHC upgraded it to a Category 1 hurricane, the lowest ranking on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale, with winds of . However, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm on August 30 as it became less organized, possibly due to an interaction with Hurricane Edouard to the north. During this time, the forward motion of the storm significantly decreased and it took a more northwestward track. However, this weakening was short-lived and Fran re-attained hurricane status the following day as Edouard moved towards the Mid-Atlantic coastline. The storm also resumed its west-northwest movement as a subtropical ridge to the north strengthened.
Gradual reintensification took place for the first several days of September, with Fran attaining winds of on September 3. By this point, the storm began to develop an eye and a more rapid phase of strengthening took place. Early the next day, Fran attained Category 3 intensity as its maximum sustained winds increased to . A more northwesterly track also began to appear as it approached the Bahamas. Passing roughly east of the Bahamas, Fran attained its peak intensity on September 5 with winds of and a barometric pressure of 946 mbar (hPa; ). The eye of Fran was roughly in diameter at this time.

As a large hurricane, the storm&#x27;s forward motion increased as it moved northwest towards The Carolinas. Around 7:30  PM EDT on Thursday, September 5, the center of Hurricane Fran made landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina with sustained winds of . Once overland, the storm began to rapidly weaken, degrading to a tropical storm within 12 hours. As the weakening storm moved through Virginia, the NHC further downgraded it to a tropical depression. Continuing on a northwestern track, the remnants of Fran persisted as a tropical depression through September 8, at which time it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over southern Ontario. After completing this transition, Fran turned northeastward and tracked near the Canadian-United States border before being absorbed by a frontal system on September 10.

==Preparations==

===Lesser Antilles and the Bahamas===

As Hurricane Fran passed to the north of the Lesser Antilles on August 29, a hurricane watch was issued for the northernmost of the islands between Antigua and Saint Martin. However, as the hurricane weakened and pulled away from the islands to the northwest, the watch was discontinued. At the same time, a hurricane watch and a tropical storm warning was declared for the central Bahamas. On September 3, the hurricane watch was extended to include the northern Bahamas and a hurricane warning was declared for the northwestern islands. All watches for the Bahamas were cancelled on September 4. No preparations were taken by the government of the Bahamas in anticipation of Fran.

===Florida===
Early in its span, Hurricane Fran was forecast to heavily impact Florida, and multiple watches and warnings were issued for the state as Hurricane Fran neared the United States. As the hurricane progressively moved further to the north, watches and warnings imposed on Florida continued to move further north along the coast. On September 4, a tropical storm warning was issued, but only from Brunswick, Georgia to Flagler Beach, Florida, located in the northern parts of the state. All watches and warnings on the state were discontinued by September 5.

Before the hurricane neared the coast, civil defense authorities conducted statewide conference calls in order to create preliminary plans in case Fran caused impacts on Florida. In addition, beach patrols were kept on high alert as Fran generated large waves on the Florida beaches.

===Georgia===
The first hurricane watches and warnings for Georgia were first imposed on September 4 as Hurricane Fran became a major hurricane with a watch extending from Florida through Georgia and into South Carolina The watch was upgraded to a warning later that day as Fran moved closer to the coast. While areas south of Brunswick, Georgia were only issued a tropical storm warning, areas north of the city were declared under a hurricane warning until September 5, when it was downgraded into a tropical storm warning. All watches and warnings on the Georgia coast were discontinued by the end of September 6.

On September 4, while much of Georgia was under a hurricane watch, multiple emergency operation centers were activated. When the watch was upgraded, the state declared a mandatory evacuation for Chatham County while Liberty County issued a voluntary evacuation order for its residents. The state&#x27;s electric membership corporations began cooperating with other utility companies in preparation for the storm.

==Impact==

Throughout the eastern United States, Fran produced strong winds and heavy rainfall, leading to widespread flash flooding and wind damage. The most severe damage took place in North Carolina where 14 people died, one of which was from a heart attack, and the storm left over $2.4 billion in losses. Throughout other states, 13 other people lost their lives and an additional $800 million in damage was caused. Overall, Hurricane Fran was directly responsible for 22 fatalities and indirectly for five others as well as $5 billion in damage. At the time, Fran was one of the ten costliest hurricanes to strike the United States; however, several other storms have since surpassed it.

===Florida and South Carolina===
Prior to moving over The Carolinas, large swells produced by Hurricane Fran impacted the Florida coastline. Along the beaches of Palm Beach County, five people aboard an fishing boat were knocked into the water by the rough seas. However, the Coast Guard rescued all five persons without incident.

As Fran made landfall in North Carolina, the outer bands of the storm brought heavy rains and gusty winds to eastern South Carolina. Several areas reported winds in excess of , leading to numerous downed trees and power lines. Some cars and homes were damaged after being struck by fallen trees. In Dillon County, winds gusting up to caused significant damage to many homes. Debris was left in the wake of Fran across the county than during Hurricane Hugo in 1989. One person was injured and damage to crops and infrastructure reached $6.5 million. In Marlboro County, roughly 3,200 people were left without power and two sheriffs were injured after their car struck a fallen tree. The most severe damage in South Carolina took place in Horry County where winds reached . Numerous trees were felled by the winds, leaving roughly 60,000 residents without power. One person was killed after her car fell down an embankment. Extensive agricultural losses were sustained in the area, estimated at $19.8 million. Structural damage was less severe, with losses estimated at $1 million. A second car-related fatality during Fran took place in Williamsburg County. Combined economic losses in Berkeley and Charleston counties reached $20 million. Throughout South Carolina, Fran was responsible for two fatalities, five injuries and roughly $48.5 million in damage.

===North Carolina===

Fran caused coastal damage from the South Carolina border to Topsail Island, North Carolina. Its 12-foot storm surge carried away a temporary North Topsail Beach police station and town hall, housed in a double-wide trailer since Hurricane Bertha&#x27;s rampage across the same area in July. The Kure Beach Pier was destroyed during the storm as well. Extensive flooding struck the coast around Wrightsville Beach, just up the coast from Cape Fear. In Jacksonville, North Carolina, three schools and several homes were damaged. The storm was most damaging to the barrier islands on the North Carolina coastline.

Further inland, the storm caused damage on its way north from Wilmington to Raleigh. Unexpectedly, high wind damage extended along the I-40 corridor up through Raleigh and points north and as far west as Guilford County, damaging historic buildings and trees throughout the Triangle including at North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina Classes were canceled for the day at UNC due to a state of emergency in Chapel Hill, and it was almost a week before the university&#x27;s water supply was drinkable again.

Rain of up to 16 inches (406 mm) deluged interior North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, bringing dangerous river flooding to much of the mid-Atlantic. Hurricane Fran&#x27;s thrashing of North Carolina aggravated the state&#x27;s problems caused by numerous weather disasters in 1996.

At least six people were killed in the Carolinas; most of them were from automobile accidents and more died as a result of the shock from the damage of the storm. In North Carolina, 1.3 million people were left without power. In North Topsail Beach and Carteret County, there was over $500 million (1996 USD) in damage and 90% of structures were damaged. One male teenager died from drowning caused by flooding of Crabtree Creek at Old Lassiter Mill in Raleigh. Fran also destroyed the basketball gym on the campus of St. Andrews College in Laurinburg, North Carolina as well as 3 piers in Surf City.
Total damage in North Carolina amounted to over $2.4 billion.

This was the second hurricane to make landfall on North Carolina that year. The first was Hurricane Bertha, which hit the state a few weeks prior.

===Virginia===
In Virginia, tropical storm-force winds lashed Chesapeake Bay and increased water levels in the Potomac River around the nation&#x27;s capital, where it backed up into Georgetown and Old Town Alexandria, Virginia. There was severe damage to power lines that left 415,000 people without electricity, making it the largest storm related power outage in history until Hurricane Isabel in 2003. Along the Rappahannock River, a storm surge of 5 ft (1.5 m) damaged or sank several small boats and damaged wharfs and bulkheads. This was the highest tide in the state since Hurricane Hazel of 1954.

Rain up to fell in the western part of Virginia, making Fran the fourth wettest known tropical cyclone to impact Virginia and causing major flash flooding. The floods shut down many of the primary and secondary roads and closed Shenandoah National Park. Fran destroyed about 300 homes, mostly from flooding, and 100 people had to be rescued.

Page County, downslope of the 16&quot; of rainfall from Big Meadows, was the hardest hit locality in the state of Virginia with regards to damage. Three days after the storm had passed, &quot;hundreds&quot; of people were still stranded. Some 78 homes were destroyed and 417 were damaged, however there were no deaths. At one point on Friday every town in the county was isolated due to high water. In the county seat of Luray, the Hawksbill Creek cut the town in half for much of the day, and the strong current forced a house off its foundation and placed in the endzone of Luray High School&#x27;s football field. Water from the Hawksbill reached from the top of the field goal upright— of water covered the ground. Bulldog field was flooded for over a week after the storm, until finally the standing water was pumped across U.S. Route 340 back into the Hawksbill Creek. Also in downtown Luray, the large flood-driven waves of the creek demolished three buildings, including the Adelphia Cable building. The creek, typically less than a foot deep, overtook the downtown Main Street Bridge, which rises some above the creek bed.

The Shenandoah River crested some above flood stage. The South Fork of the Shenandoah River recorded its highest crests ever, in Luray and in Front Royal, Virginia, which was above the 15 ft (4.6 m) flood stage.

In Rockingham County, Virginia, over 10,000 people were evacuated from their homes, however most were allowed to return to their homes after the water subsided.

===West Virginia===
Up to 7 inches (178 mm) of rain fell, causing widespread flash flooding. Pendleton and Hardy County were the hardest hit as the floods swept away several bridges, damaged several water plants and caused a reported gas leak.

===Maryland===
Western Maryland was hard hit by Fran, mostly from flash flooding. About 650 homes were damaged and there was $100 million (1996 USD) in damage. This was the worst flooding event to hit Maryland since Hurricane Hazel and the January flood of 1996.

===District of Columbia===
In the District of Columbia, Fran produced gusty winds and moderate rainfall. Gusts in the area were recorded in excess of and rainfall peaked near . Minor flash flooding was reported on many streets, hampering travel and leaving several roads were closed. These winds downed several trees in saturated soil. A strong southerly wind and high tide led to a storm surge in Washington Harbor. In addition to the storm surge, a river flood rivaling that of the January 1996 flood took place in the metropolitan area. Throughout Washington, D.C., Fran left roughly $20 million in damage.

===Pennsylvania===
About 15 Western Pennsylvania counties were impacted by flash flooding as rainfall up to 7 inches (178 mm) caused the Juniata River to overrun its banks.

===Ohio, Michigan, New England, and Canada===
The remnants of Fran brought moderate to heavy rainfall to parts of eastern Ohio, especially along the coast of Lake Erie, as the storm moved through the region. A maximum of of rain fell near Elyria in relation to Fran. Sustained winds in the state were recorded around and gusts reached . These winds downed numerous trees and power lines, some of which fell on cars and homes. Agricultural land and the region sustained significant damage. In Cleveland, the city zoo sustained some flood damage and the monkey island was completely inundated. In Cuyahoga County at least 90 homes reported basement flooding. Widespread street and basement flooding took place across Lorain County, with some areas reporting standing water several days after Fran&#x27;s passage. Throughout Ohio, the remnants of Fran left roughly $40 million in damage and no loss of life.

Continuing northward, Fran moved into southern Canada on September 7; however, the outer bands of the storm brought some rainfall to extreme eastern Michigan. In Port Huron, a state maximum amount of of rain fell during the storm&#x27;s passage. No known flooding or damage took place throughout the state. Turning northeast and becoming extratropical, Fran brought scattered rainfall to parts of New England. A small area around Boston, Massachusetts received the heaviest rain in the region, peaking at in East Wareham. Isolated areas of of rain fell across portions of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine before Fran dissipated over eastern Canada on September 8. In nearby southern Canada, the remnants of Fran had little impact in Ontario, other than causing rain delays in a minor t-ball tournament, producing light to moderate rainfall between 1.8 and 2.6 in (45 and 65 mm).

==Aftermath==

The Cape Fear River watershed was devastated by Fran. Severe water quality problems persisted for weeks. The Northeast Cape Fear river suffered a massive fish kill. Sewage treatment plant failures led to millions of gallons of raw and partially treated human sewage to flow into area rivers. Dissolved oxygen content fell to nearly zero across the Cape Fear and Northeast Cape Fear Rivers for over three weeks, which led to hypoxia in the Cape Fear estuary for several weeks. Ammonium and phosphorus levels increased, with concentrations of phosphorus reaching a 27-year high.

===Retirement===

Because of the damage caused by the hurricane, the name &quot;Fran&quot; was retired in the spring of 1997 by the World Meteorological Organization, and will never again be used for another North Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with &quot;Fay&quot; for the 2002 season.

<text>Johann Baptist Ritter von Spix (9 February 1781 – 13 March 1826) was a German biologist. From his expedition to Brazil, he brought to Germany a large variety of specimens of plants, insects, mammals, birds, amphibians and fish. They constitute an important basis for today&#x27;s National Zoological Collection in Munich. Numerous examples of his ethnographic collections, such as dance masks and the like, are now part of the collection of the Museum of Ethnography in Munich.

==Biography==
Spix was born in Höchstadt, Germany, the seventh of eleven children. His childhood home is the site of the Spix Museum, open to the public since 2004. He studied philosophy in Bamberg and graduated with a doctoral degree. Later he studied theology in Würzburg. After attending lectures of the young professor F. W. J. Schelling, Spix became interested in nature. He quit his theology studies and began studying medicine, which he finished with a second doctoral degree in 1807.

After a short time working as a physician in Bamberg, he was appointed by King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria as student (&quot;Eleve&quot;) of zoology in Munich at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Munich in 1808. He received a scholarship to go to Paris to learn scientific zoology with Georges Cuvier and others. From there he also made a first excursion to the sea coast of Normandy in Northern France. Later he travelled to Southern France and Italy, collecting animals for the zoological collection of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities and investigating marine animals.

In 1810, Spix came back to Munich where he sorted the zoological collection and wrote his first publication on starfish and other marine animals. After this first fundamental publication, a book about the history of zoological classification, published in 1811, he was appointed member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. Spix was also appointed the first conservator, now inline with the title director, of the Bavarian zoological collection, considered as the foundation of the Zoologische Staatssammlung München. He published several further works, the most important being a comparative morphology of the skulls of many different animals, including men, primates, reptiles, birds, and others. This book, the &quot;Cephalogenesis&quot;, published in 1815, was written in Latin and illustrated with beautiful lithographs.

==Expedition to Brazil==

In 1817, Spix and Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius travelled to Brazil with a group of Austrian naturalists who accompanied Maria Leopoldina of Austria. First they went to Rio de Janeiro, but they soon left the Austrian group and travelled on their own through Brazil. Spix and Martius travelled from southern Rio de Janeiro to northern São Paulo. During this part of their journey, they were accompanied by the Austrian painter Thomas Ender. Then they continued to Ouro Preto and Diamantina, in the province of Minas Gerais, where they described the mining of diamonds. From there, they went further into the continent and then back to the coast of Salvador.

They crossed the dry Caatinga in northeast Brazil, suffering from different severe diseases, and almost dying several times of thirst. During the whole journey, they collected and described animals and plants, but also everything else of scientific interest. They also described indigenous people and their habits, as well as anything of possible economic importance. They additionally investigated the giant Bendegó meteorite. They discovered fossil fishes of the Santana Formation.

The last part of the expedition was the journey up to the Amazon River, then in the Captaincy of Grão-Pará. There Spix and Martius went on separate routes to explore the region. Spix went to Tabatinga, to the border of Peru, and from Manaus up the Negro River. Martius travelled by boat to the Yupurá River, and from there he brought to Munich two Brazilian indigenous children from two different tribes, the Juri and the Miranha. The children where baptized Johannes and Isabella. Spix and Martius returned in 1820 to Munich with specimens of thousands of plants, animals, and ethnological objects. The zoological specimens formed the basis of the collection of the Natural History Museum in Munich, the ethnological objects of Spix and Martius are the basis of the Museum für Völkerkunde München (now: Museum Fünf Kontinente).

==Publications==

Spix was honoured and knighted by the king of Bavaria. He worked hard on his zoological materials and prepared a description of the journey together with Martius. This description was printed in three volumes in 1823, 1828 and 1831, translated into English (first volume only) and Portuguese, which are still of great importance. Spix died during the preparation of the second volume, but Martius finished its publication using the notes of Spix and himself. Spix described and named many birds, primates, bats, and reptiles. Altogether he described some 500 to 600 species and subspecies. Furthermore, several species are named after him. Among Spix&#x27;s most renowned discoveries is the species Spix&#x27;s macaw, named after the explorer by the German naturalist Georg Marcgrave. He died on 13 May 1826 in Munich, possibly from a tropical disease acquired on his expedition.

==Legacy==
Spix is commemorated in the scientific names of three species of South American reptiles: &quot;Acanthochelys spixii&quot;, a turtle; Chironius spixii, a snake; and &quot;Micrurus spixii&quot;, a venomous coral snake.

Birds named for Spix include Spix&#x27;s guan (&quot;Penelope jacquacu&quot;), Spix&#x27;s macaw (&quot;Cyanospitta spixii&quot;), Spix&#x27;s warbling-antbird (&quot;Hypocnemis striata&quot;), Spix&#x27;s woodcreeper (&quot;Xiphorhynchus spixii&quot;), and Spix&#x27;s spinetail (&quot;Synallaxis spixi&quot;).

Mammals named for Spix include Spix&#x27;s disk-winged bat (&quot;Thyroptera tricolor&quot;), Spix&#x27;s red-handed howler (&quot;Alouatta discolor&quot;), Spix&#x27;s white-fronted capuchin (&quot;Cebus unicolor&quot;), Spix&#x27;s night monkey (&quot;Aotus vociferans&quot;), and Spix&#x27;s yellow-toothed cavy (&quot;Galea spixii&quot;). 

The catfish &quot;Cathorops spixii&quot; was named in his honor in 1829.

&quot;Asolene spixii&quot; is named for Spix.

The University of Bamberg, Germany, has established an annual international visiting professorship that carries Spix&#x27; name.

<text>The XYZZY Awards are the annual awards given to works of interactive fiction, serving a similar role to the Academy Awards for film. The awards were inaugurated in 1997 by Eileen Mullin, the editor of &quot;XYZZYnews&quot;. Any game released during the year prior to the award ceremony is eligible for nomination to receive an award. The decision process takes place in two stages: members of the interactive fiction community nominate works within specific categories and sufficiently supported nominations become finalists within those categories. Community members then vote among the finalists, and the game receiving a plurality of votes is given the award in an online ceremony. 

Since 1997, the XYZZY Awards have become one of the most important events within the interactive fiction community. Together with events like the Interactive Fiction Competition and Spring Thing, the XYZZY Awards provide opportunities for the community to encourage and reward the creation and development of new works within a genre that is no longer commercially lucrative. 

The name of the awards comes from the magic word &quot;xyzzy&quot; causing teleportation from the popular early text adventure game &quot;Adventure&quot;.

== Awards ==

The awards have been presented in the following categories.

===Best game===
The game which is the most enjoyable as a whole; other awards recognize merit in particular qualities.

===Best writing===
A game which rises above the others in the quality of its descriptive text.

===Best story===
The game with the deepest or most original story.

===Best setting===
The most original or best-described locations.

===Best puzzles===
The most well-crafted, clever, and appropriate puzzles. 

===Best NPCs===
Appropriate, amusing, and well-written casts of non-player characters.

===Best individual puzzle===
The most inspired, well-crafted, and intriguing puzzle.

===Best individual NPC===
A particularly well-implemented and well-written non-player character.

===Best individual PC===
A particularly well-defined and well-written player character. 

===Best use of medium===
The category had no specific criteria given to voters; many chose to interpret this award as a recognition of particularly daring interpretations of the limits and abilities of interactive fiction, especially as regards the relationship between the player, narrator, and player character. This award was retired in 2010, when Best Implementation and Best Use of Innovation were introduced as replacements.

===Best implementation===
Introduced in 2010 along with Best Use of Innovation, to replace the Best use of Medium award. It recognizes &quot;completeness of implementation, excellence in parser messages, etc&quot;.

===Best use of innovation===
Introduced in 2010 along with Best Implementation, to replace the Best use of Medium award. It recognizes the &quot;most innovative game&quot;.

===Best technological development===
Recognizes &quot;interpreters, authoring systems, libraries, utilities, and so on&quot;.

===Best supplemental materials===
Outstanding non-game content (&quot;feelies&quot;) created to accompany specific games. Eligibility is based on the year when the supplemental materials were released, regardless of the year of release of the game.

* 2010: &quot;Creating Interactive Fiction with Inform 7&quot; (Aaron A. Reed)

<text>Thomas Woolston (baptised November 166827 January 1733) was an English theologian. Although he was often classed as a deist, his biographer William H. Trapnell regards him as an Anglican who held unorthodox theological views.

==Biography==

Thomas Woolston, born at Northampton in 1668, the son of a currier, the scholar entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, in 1685; attained the Master of Arts in 1692; the Bachelor of Divinity conferred in 1699; took orders and was made a fellow of his college.

After a time, by the study of Origen and the other early Fathers, he became possessed with the notion of the importance of an allegorical or spiritual interpretation of Scripture, and advocated its use in the defence of Christianity both in his sermons and in his first book, while attacking what he saw as the shallow literalist interpretation of contemporary divines, &quot;The Old Apology for the Truth of the Christian Religion against the Jews and Gentiles Revived&quot; (1705). For many years he published nothing, but in 1720-1721 the publication of letters and pamphlets in advocacy of his assessment of the Old Testament, with open challenges to the clergy to refute them, brought him into trouble. It was reported that his mind was disordered, and he lost his fellowship. From 1721 he lived for the most part in London, on an allowance of £30 a year from his brother and other presents.

His influence on the course of the deistical controversy began with his book, &quot;The Moderator between an Infidel and an Apostate&quot; (1725, 3rd ed. 1729). The infidel intended was Anthony Collins, who had maintained in his book alluded to that the New Testament is based on the Old, and that not the literal but only the allegorical sense of the prophecies can be quoted in proof of the Messiahship of Jesus; the apostate was the clergy who had forsaken the allegorical method of the fathers. Woolston denied absolutely the proof from miracles, called in question the fact of the resurrection of Christ and other miracles of the New Testament, and maintained that they must be interpreted allegorically, or as types of spiritual things. Two years later he began a series of Discourses on the same subject, in which he applied the principles of his Moderator to the miracles of the Gospels in detail. The &quot;Discourses&quot;, 30,000 copies of which were said to have been sold, were six in number, the first appearing in 1727, the next five 1728–1729, with two Defences in 1729 1730. For these publications he was tried before Chief Justice in 1729. Found guilty of blasphemy, Woolston was sentenced (28 November) to pay a fine of £25 for each of the first four &quot;Discourses&quot;, with imprisonment until paid, and also to a year&#x27;s imprisonment and to give security, for his good behaviour during life. He failed to find this security, and remained in confinement until his death.

==Replies==
Upwards of sixty pamphlets appeared in reply to his &quot;Moderator&quot; and &quot;Discourses&quot;. Among them were:

*Zachary Pearce, &quot;The Miracles of Jesus Vindicated&quot; (1729)
*Thomas Sherlock, &quot;The Tryal of the Witnesses of the Resurrection of Jesus&quot; (1729, 13th ed. 1755)
*Nathaniel Lardner, &quot;Vindication of Three of Our Saviour&#x27;s Miracles&quot; (1729), Lardner being one of those who did not approve of the prosecution of Woolston (see Lardner&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; by Andrew Kippis, in Lardner&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot;, vol. i.)

<text>Downtown Pittsburgh, colloquially referred to as the Golden Triangle, and officially the Central Business District, is the urban downtown center of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located at the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River whose joining forms the Ohio River. The triangle is bounded by the two rivers.

The area features offices for major corporations such as PNC Bank, U.S. Steel, PPG, Bank of New York Mellon, Heinz, Federated Investors, and Alcoa. It is where the fortunes of such industrial barons as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Henry J. Heinz, Andrew Mellon and George Westinghouse were made. It contains the site where the French fort, Fort Duquesne, once stood.

== Location ==
The Central Business District is bounded by the Monongahela River to the south, the Allegheny River to the north, and I-579 (Crosstown Boulevard) to the east. An expanded definition of Downtown may include the adjacent neighborhoods of Uptown/The Bluff, the Strip District, the North Shore, and the South Shore.

== Transportation ==
=== Public transportation ===
Downtown is served by the Port Authority&#x27;s light rail subway system (known locally as the &quot;T&quot;), an extensive bus network, and two inclines (Duquesne Incline and Monongahela Incline). The Downtown portion of the subway has the following stations:

&quot;T Stations&quot;
* Station Square on the South Shore in the Station Square development (street-level station)
* First Avenue near First Avenue &amp; Ross Street, Downtown (elevated station)
* Steel Plaza at Sixth Avenue &amp; Grant Street, Downtown (underground station)
* Penn Plaza near Liberty Avenue &amp; Grant Street, Downtown (underground, limited service)
* Wood Street at the triangular intersection of Wood Street, Sixth Avenue, and Liberty Avenue, Downtown (underground station)
* Gateway Center at Liberty Avenue &amp; Stanwix Street, Downtown (underground station)
* North Side near General Robinson Street &amp; Tony Dorsett Drive on the North Shore (underground station)
* Allegheny near Allegheny Avenue &amp; Reedsdale Street on the North Shore (elevated station)

Downtown is also home to the Pittsburgh Amtrak train station connecting Pittsburgh with New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. to the east and Cleveland and Chicago to the west. Greyhound&#x27;s Pittsburgh bus terminal is located across Liberty Avenue from the Amtrak Station, in the Grant Street Transportation Center building.

=== Highways ===
Major roadways serving Downtown from the suburbs include the &quot;Parkway East&quot; (I-376) from Monroeville, the &quot;Parkway West&quot; (I-376) from the airport area, and the &quot;Parkway North&quot; (I-279) from the North Hills, and (I-579) in Downtown Pittsburgh. Other important roadways are Pennsylvania Route 28, Pennsylvania Route 51, Pennsylvania Route 65, and U.S. Route 19.

Three major entrances to the city are via tunnels: the Fort Pitt Tunnel and Squirrel Hill Tunnel on I-376 and the Liberty Tunnels. &quot;The New York Times&quot; once called Pittsburgh &quot;the only city with an entrance,&quot; specifically referring to the view of Downtown that explodes upon drivers immediately upon exiting the Fort Pitt Tunnel. Also traveling I-279 south and I-376, the city &quot;explodes into view&quot; when coming around a turn in the highway.

=== Local streets ===

Downtown surface streets are based on two distinct grid systems that parallel the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. These two grids intersect along Liberty Avenue, creating many unusual street intersections. Furthermore, the Allegheny grid contains numbered streets, while the Monongahela grid contains numbered avenues. And, in fact, there are cases where these numbered roadways intersect, creating some confusion (i.e. the intersection of Liberty Avenue and 7th Street/6th Avenue). This unusual grid pattern leads to Pittsburghers giving directions in the terms of landmarks, rather than turn-by-turn directions.

=== Bridges ===
Pittsburgh is nicknamed &quot;The City of Bridges&quot;. In Downtown, there are 10 bridges (listed below) connecting to points north and south. The expanded definition of Downtown (including the aforementioned surrounding neighborhoods) includes 18 bridges. Citywide there are 446 bridges. In Allegheny County the number exceeds 2,200.

== Downtown districts ==
Downtown contains a wealth of historic, cultural, and entertainment sites. While most people still consider the entire Downtown as one neighborhood, there are several significant subdistricts within the Golden Triangle.

* The Pittsburgh Central Downtown Historic District is a historic district in the central business district. It is bounded by Wood Street, Forbes Avenue, Grant Street, and Liberty Avenue. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on December 17, 1985.
* Point State Park area: At the triangle&#x27;s tip is Point State Park with its giant fountain and the Fort Pitt Museum. This park was the original site of both Fort Duquesne by the French and the subsequent Fort Pitt by the British.
* The Cultural District along Penn and Liberty avenues on the Allegheny River includes numerous theaters, galleries, and concert halls including Heinz Hall, Byham Theater, O&#x27;Reilly Theater, Benedum Center, and Wood Street Galleries as well as restaurants and housing. The Penn-Liberty Historic District encompasses the Penn &amp; Liberty avenue corridor in the Cultural District.
* The Fifth &amp; Forbes Corridor is Downtown&#x27;s shopping district along Fifth and Forbes avenues and includes historic Market Square. Downtown is home to numerous independent retailers plus large retailers such as Burlington Coat Factory and Brooks Brothers.
* The Grant Street area is the seat of Pittsburgh&#x27;s and Allegheny County&#x27;s government and is also a prestigious corporate address with many of the city&#x27;s tallest skyscrapers.
* The Firstside neighborhood along the Boulevard of the Allies and Fort Pitt Boulevard adjacent to the Monongahela River is an educational and residential district. It is home to Point Park University and the Art Institute of Pittsburgh both of which have high-rise student housing in the neighborhood. Numerous other residential projects are also under construction in this neighborhood.

== Economy ==

Downtown Pittsburgh retains substantial economic influence, ranking at 25th in the nation for jobs within the urban core and 6th in job density.

University of Pittsburgh economist Christopher Briem notes that the level of employment in the city has remained largely constant for the past 50 years: &quot;[the] time series of jobs located in the City proper are about as stable as any economic metric in the region, or in any other Northeastern US urban core, over many decades. In 1958, [there were] 294,000 jobs located in the city proper...Those numbers are virtually identical today which tells me there is a certain limit to how many jobs can efficiently be located in what are some relatively (very) constrained areas.&quot; These numbers reflect employment in the city as a whole, not just the central business district; but the central business district has the highest density of employment of any Pittsburgh neighborhood.

Pittsburgh has long been a headquarters city, with numerous national and global corporations calling the Golden Triangle home. Currently, Downtown is still home to a large number of Fortune 500 companies (7 in the metro area, 5 of which are in the city in 2022, which ranks Pittsburgh high nationally in Fortune 500 headquarters):

<doc id="728704" wikidata="Q763829" url="?curid=728704" title="Jezreel Valley">
<text>The Jezreel Valley (from the ), also known as the Valley of Megiddo, is a large fertile plain and inland valley in the Northern District of Israel. It is bordered to the north by the highlands of the Lower Galilee region, to the south by the Samarian highlands, to the west and northwest by the Mount Carmel range, and to the east by the Jordan Valley, with Mount Gilboa marking its southern extent. The largest settlement in the valley is the city of Afula, which lies near its center.

==Name==

The Jezreel Valley takes its name from the ancient city of Jezreel (known in Hebrew as Yizre&#x27;el; , ) which was located on a low hill overlooking the southern edge of the valley. The word &quot;Jezreel&quot; comes from the Hebrew, and means &quot;God sows&quot; or &quot;El sows&quot;. 

The Arabic name of the valley is Marj Bani Amir (), which translates as the &#x27;Meadow of the Banu Amir&#x27;, an Arab tribe, parts of which took up abode in the valley after the 7th-century Muslim conquest. The name was increasingly used in Arabic texts to refer to the region as an administrative unit during the late Mamluk period (1260–1517). In earlier Arabic texts, the region was called after one of its well known sites, the Ayn Jalut spring. Marj Bani Amir became the official administrative name of the district which encompassed the valley from early Ottoman rule (1517–1917). A common variant of this name is (), . With the advent of British rule in 1917 and the gradual acquisition of the valley by Jewish land organizations, the Arabic name fell out of official use in favor of the biblical &#x27;Jezreel Valley&#x27;.

==Geology==

The valley once acted as the channel by which the Mediterranean Sea, at the north-western end of the valley, connected to the Sea of Galilee, the Jordan Valley and ultimately to the Dead Sea. About two million years ago, as the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan Rift Valley rose, this connection was lost, and the periodic floods from the Mediterranean Sea ceased. This resulted in the Dead Sea no longer having a connection to the ocean, and over time, due to greater evaporation than precipitation plus surface water inflow, it has become heavily saline. The Sea of Galilee, on the other hand, consists of fresh water.

==Geography==
The Jezreel Valley is a green fertile plain covered with fields of wheat, watermelon, melon, oranges, white beans, cowpeas, chickpeas, green beans, cotton, sunflowers and corn, as well as grazing tracts for multitudes of sheep and cattle. The area is governed by the Jezreel Valley Regional Council. The Max Stern College of Emek Yizreel and the Emek Medical Center are located in the valley. 

==Biblical and theological relevance==
===In the Hebrew Bible===
According to the Hebrew Bible, the valley was the scene of several battles with the Israelites. A victory was led by Deborah and Barak against the Canaanites (). Another was led by Gideon against the Midianites, the Amalekites, and &quot;the children of the East&quot; (). It was later the location at which the Israelites, led by King Saul, were defeated by the Philistines (). According to textual scholars, the account of an ancient Philistine victory at Jezreel derives from the &quot;monarchial source&quot;, in contrast to the &quot;republican source&quot;, which places the Philistine victory against the Israelites at Mount Gilboa (,). Another defeat was of King Josiah by the Egyptians ().

According to , the Jezreel Valley was where Jehu massacred all members of the Omride family.

===In Christian eschatology===
In Christian eschatology, the part of the valley on which the Battle of Megiddo was fought is believed to be the destined site of the penultimate battle between good and evil (with a later, final battle taking place 1,000 years later around Jerusalem ()), the place being known as Armageddon, a toponym derived from the Hebrew &quot;Har Megiddo&quot;, &#x27;Mount Megiddo&#x27;.

==History==
Archaeological excavations have indicated near continuous settlement from the Ghassulian culture of the Chalcolithic Age (c. 4500–3300 BCE) to the Ayyubid periods of the 11–13th centuries CE.

===Bronze and Iron Ages===

Biblical cities in the Jezreel Valley include Jezreel, Megiddo, Beit She&#x27;an, Shimron and Afula.

There is a surviving detailed account of the earliest battle for the Jezreel Valley, the 15th-century BC Battle of Megiddo, to prove that it was fought in the valley. Due to the surrounding terrain, Egyptian chariots were only able to travel from Egypt as far as the Jezreel Valley and the valley north of Lake Huleh.

In the western part of the Jezreel Valley, 23 of the 26 Iron Age I sites (12th to 10th centuries BCE) yielded typical Philistine pottery. These sites include Tel Megiddo, Tel Yokneam, Tel Qiri, Afula, Tel Qashish, Be&#x27;er Tiveon, Hurvat Hazin, Tel Risim, Tel Re&#x27;ala, Hurvat Tzror, Tel Sham, Midrakh Oz and Tel Zariq. Scholars have attributed the presence of Philistine pottery in northern Israel to their role as mercenaries for the Egyptians during their military administration of the land in the 12th century BCE. This presence may also indicate further expansion of the Philistines to the valley during the 11th century BCE, or their trade with the Israelites. There are biblical references to Philistines in the valley during the times of the judges. The quantity of Philistine pottery within these sites is still quite small, which means that even if the Philistines did settle the valley they were a minority that blended within the Canaanite population during the 12th century BC. The Philistines seem to have been present in the southern valley during the 11th century, which may relate to the biblical account of their victory at the Battle of Gilboa.

===Roman period===
In the late Second Temple period, Josephus refers to both the Jezreel Valley and the Beit Netofa Valley as the &quot;Great Plain&quot;.

===Mamluk period===
During the Mamluk period, the Jezreel Valley formed the southern part of Mamlakat Safad (the province of Safed). In the 14th century, it was inhabited by the Bani Haritha tribe of Yaman (southern Arab)-affiliated Bedouins, the progenitors of the Turabay dynasty.

===Ottoman period===
During the early Ottoman period, the Jezreel Valley was the core territory of the Turabay Emirate (1517–1683). The Valley&#x27;s capital was initially at Lajjun, the center of an eponymous sanjak and one of Palestine&#x27;s provincial capitals during the 16th century. Around 1600, the seat of the Turabays moved to Jenin. In the early 16th-century Ottoman tax records, the Valley contained 38 villages, as well as 74 uninhabited &quot;mazra&#x27;a&#x27;s&quot;, a reflection of the Valley&#x27;s decline during the late Mamluk period. The Turabays were entrusted with securing the region and restoring its prosperity. After the fall of the Turabay Emirate, the Valley became contested space between the rulers of Acre and Nablus until taken over by Zahir al-Umar during the 1760s. 

In the late Ottoman era, the outskirts of the Jezreel Valley, within both the Nazareth and Shefa-&#x27;Amr &quot;nahiyas&quot;, had sparse populations. Malaria was widespread, particularly in the plains, notably in the vicinity of the Kishon River and its tributaries. This disease drove away many locals, allowing Bedouins to fill the void. In drought years, Bedouins from the &quot;ghor&quot; even encroached into lands cultivated by the fellahin, covering the area with their tents. The &quot;permanent&quot; nomads, Bedouins of Turkmen descent, resided in the Jezreel Valley during summer and autumn, then wintered between the Sharon region and the Valley, moving through the Manasseh Hills.&quot;&quot;

Laurence Oliphant, who visited the Akko Sanjak valley area in 1887, then a subprovince of the Beirut vilayet, wrote that the Valley of Esdraelon (Jezreel) was &quot;a huge green lake of waving wheat, with its village-crowned mounds rising from it like islands; and it presents one of the most striking pictures of luxuriant fertility which it is possible to conceive.&quot; In the early 1900, the Ottomans constructed the Jezreel Valley railway which ran along the entire length of the valley.
In the 1870s, the Sursock family of Beirut (present-day Lebanon) purchased the land from the Ottoman government for approximately £20,000. This purchase, along with others, dispossessed local Bedouins and resulted in the creation of new tenant communities, as well as a growth of population in pre-existing villages. However, most of these settlements were established on the outskirts of the valley rather than within it.&quot;&quot;

Between 1912 and 1925 the Sursock family (then under the French Mandate of Syria) sold their 80,000 acres (320 km2) of land in the Vale of Jezreel to the American Zion Commonwealth for about nearly three-quarters of a million pounds. The land was purchased by the Jewish organization as part of an effort to resettle Jews who inhabited the land, as well as others who came from distant lands.

===British Mandate===
After the land was sold to the American Zion Commonwealth, some of the Arab farmers who lived in nearby villages and had been working for the absentee landowners were given financial compensation or were provided with land elsewhere. Despite the sale, some of the farmers refused to leave their land, as in Afula (El-Ful), however the new owners decided that it would be inappropriate for these farmers to remain as tenants on land intended for Jewish labor. This was a commonplace feeling among segments of the Jewish population, part of a socialist ideology of the Yishuv, which included their working the land rather than being absentee landowners. British police had to be used to expel some and the dispossessed made their way to the coast to search for new work with most ending up in shanty towns on the edges of Jaffa and Haifa.
Following the purchase of the land, the Jewish farmers created the first modern-day settlements, founded the modern day city of Afula and drained the swamps to enable further land development of areas that had been uninhabitable for centuries. The first moshav, Nahalal, was settled in this valley on 11 September 1921.

After the widespread Arab riots of 1929 in the then British Mandate of Palestine, the Hope Simpson Enquiry was appointed to seek causes and remedies for the instability. The Commission&#x27;s findings in regard to &quot;Government responsibility towards Arab cultivators&quot;, was that the Jewish authorities &quot;have nothing with which to reproach themselves&quot; in the purchase of the valley, noting the high prices paid and land occupants receiving compensation not legally bound. The responsibility of the Mandate Government for &quot;soreness felt (among both effendi and fellahin) owing to the sale of large areas by the absentee Sursock family&quot; and the displacement of Arab tenants; noted that, &quot;the duty of the Administration of Palestine to ensure that the rights and position of the Arabs are not prejudiced by Jewish immigration. It is doubtful whether, in the matter of the Sursock lands, this Article of the Mandate received sufficient consideration.&quot;

===State of Israel===
In 2006, the Israeli Transportation Ministry and Jezreel Valley Regional Council announced plans to build an international airport near Megiddo but the project was shelved due to environmental objections.

==Archaeological excavations==
Archaeological sites in the Jezreel Valley are currently excavated and coordinated by the Jezreel Valley Regional Project.

In 2021, archaeologist from Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) led by researchers Tzachi Lang and Kojan Haku found in the village of Et Taiyiba an engraved stone from the late 5th century from the frame of an entrance door of a church, with a Greek inscription. The inscription reads, &quot;Christ born of Mary. This work of the most God-fearing and pious bishop [Theodo]sius and the miserable Th[omas] was built from the foundation. Whoever enters should pray for them.&quot; According to archaeologist Dr. Walid Atrash, Theodosius was one of the first Christian bishops and this church was the first evidence of the Byzantine church’s existence in the village of Et Taiyiba.

<text>The City Hall station, also known as City Hall Loop station, is a closed station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. It is located under City Hall Park, next to New York City Hall, in the Civic Center neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. The station was constructed for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) as the southern terminal of the city&#x27;s first subway line, which was approved in 1900. Construction of the segment of the line that includes the City Hall station started on September 12 of the same year. The station opened on October 27, 1904, as one of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway. As ridership grew, it was deemed infeasible to lengthen the original platform to accommodate ten-car trains. The station was closed on December 31, 1945, because of its proximity to the Brooklyn Bridge station.

The City Hall station, with its single track and curved side platform, was the showpiece of the original IRT subway. The single platform and mezzanine feature Guastavino tile, skylights, colored glass tilework, and brass chandeliers. The Rafael Guastavino-designed station is unique in the system for the usage of Romanesque Revival architecture. The tunnel passing through the City Hall station is still used as a turning loop for the and can be seen from passing trains. The station is a New York City designated landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== History ==

=== Construction and opening ===

Planning for a subway line in New York City dates to 1864. However, development of what would become the city&#x27;s first subway line did not start until 1894, when the New York State Legislature passed the Rapid Transit Act. The subway plans were drawn up by a team of engineers led by William Barclay Parsons, the Rapid Transit Commission&#x27;s chief engineer. They called for a subway line from New York City Hall in lower Manhattan to the Upper West Side, where two branches would lead north into the Bronx. A plan was formally adopted in 1897, and all legal conflicts concerning the route alignment were resolved near the end of 1899. The Rapid Transit Construction Company, organized by John B. McDonald and funded by August Belmont Jr., signed the initial Contract 1 with the Rapid Transit Commission in February 1900, in which it would construct the subway and maintain a 50-year operating lease from the opening of the line. In 1901, the firm of Heins &amp; LaFarge was hired to design the underground stations. Belmont incorporated the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) in April 1902 to operate the subway.

The station had always been envisioned as a terminal with loop tracks. The initial plans in the 1890s called for a multi-track loop, extending beneath the City Hall Post Office and Courthouse, which was then at the southern corner of City Hall Park. The loop was planned to have either two tracks (on two levels) or four tracks. When the plans for the IRT line were changed in 1898 to allow the express tracks to go to Brooklyn as part of the subway&#x27;s Contract 2, the planned City Hall station was changed to a single-track local station, thereby avoiding a grade crossing with the express tracks. Under the 1898 iteration of the plan, the loop was to diverge from the line at the south end of Centre Street, traveling west under City Hall Park, south under Broadway, and then northeast under Park Row. In addition, tracks from the loop would have led to the post office building. East of the loop, there were two express tracks and two storage tracks.

==== Construction of the loop ====
A formal groundbreaking ceremony was performed at City Hall on March 24, 1900, pursuant to the contract&#x27;s requirements. The ceremony was officiated by then-Mayor Robert Van Wyck. Degnon-McLean Contracting Company was awarded the contract for Section 1, from the City Hall loop to Chambers Street. Work began promptly after the groundbreaking. The tunnel was built using a cut and cover method, with steel beams supporting a concrete roof made of jack arches. A further change was requested in September 1900, which would provide more room for the loop on the Park Row side. Plans for the loop under City Hall Park were modified in January 1901, providing for a shortened loop. By that March, the City Hall Loop was planned to be built just north of the post office, rather than around it. At the end of the month, trees in City Hall Park were being removed in preparation for the loop&#x27;s construction. 

The portion of the loop in City Hall Park was excavated starting in April 1901. The trees were removed from the park using derricks. One worker was killed that May when a derrick boom in front of the subway excavation was knocked loose. Sand from the excavation was sold to builders who sought the sand for its &quot;good quality&quot;. The short section adjacent to the post office could not be constructed because the Treasury Secretary had not approved the work, leading the IRT to request approval from Congress. The entirety of the loop within City Hall Park had been excavated by that August. Most of the excavation was covered over shortly afterward, although a small part remained open to facilitate work on the station.

In late 1901, the contractors began excavating the tunnel under Park Row, which would carry both the northbound track of the loop and the express tracks to Brooklyn. Work on the station was placed on hold because the station&#x27;s concrete vaults were difficult to pour during winter. By February 1902, three-fourths of the work for the station&#x27;s side walls had been completed, and work had started on the vaults. The tunnel under Park Row had been fully excavated and was being covered with steel beams. Most of the loop was completed by late 1902, except for the section under the post office. The contractors excavated the remainder of the loop after they were given temporary permission, in December 1902, to use the vaults underneath the post office.

==== Completion ====
By late 1903, the tilework of the sidewalks and the station&#x27;s staircase were completed. Construction materials were being stored in the station&#x27;s only entrance and exit. The subway was nearly complete, but the IRT Powerhouse and the system&#x27;s electrical substations were still under construction, delaying the system&#x27;s opening. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1904, mayor George B. McClellan Jr. and a group of wealthy New Yorkers gathered at the City Hall station and traveled to 125th Street using handcars. The IRT conducted several more handcar trips afterward. The first train to run on its own power traveled from 125th Street to City Hall in April 1904.

The City Hall station opened on October 27, 1904, as the southern terminal station of the original 28-station New York City Subway line to 145th Street on the West Side Branch, now the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line. At the time, the station was called &quot;City Hall Loop&quot;. Prior to the opening, more than 15,000 people were issued passes for the first series of rides from the City Hall station&#x27;s platform. McClellan attended the opening ceremonies, which began at 1:00 p.m. The first subway train departed from City Hall at precisely 2:34 p.m., with McClellan at the controls. President A. E. Orr of the Rapid Transit Board requested that all New Yorkers join in the celebration by blowing whistles and ringing bells. The new line carried 27,000 passengers for free until 6 p.m., and another 125,000 passengers paid to ride the subway in the six-hour period that followed.

=== Operation ===

==== Early years ====

Because of the limited number of entrances to the City Hall station, it was served exclusively by local trains, which also stopped at the much larger Brooklyn Bridge station. All express trains terminated at Brooklyn Bridge and did not go around the loop. Furthermore, the City Hall station was originally an entrance-only station; disembarking passengers had to go to the Brooklyn Bridge station. After the Fulton Street station opened in January 1905, the City Hall Loop was served by local trains to the West Side Branch at all times and by local trains to 145th Street on the East Side Branch (now Lenox Avenue Line) during the daytime. By July 1905, East Side local trains to 145th Street ran to City Hall at all times, while West Side locals bypassed this station and went to Bowling Green or South Ferry. To address ventilation issues, the IRT installed ventilation grates in City Hall Park in mid-1906. By the end of the year, West Side locals ran to City Hall during rush hours, and East Side locals ran to City Hall at all times.

Not long after the station opened, the IRT started displaying advertisements in the station, which was highly controversial but was allowed under the IRT&#x27;s contract to operate the route. The New York City government initially did not find the ads to be problematic, but public outcry led the city to file a lawsuit to force the IRT to remove the ads. In 1907, the New York Supreme Court ruled that the IRT was allowed to keep the ads. To address overcrowding, in 1909, the New York Public Service Commission proposed lengthening the platforms at stations along the original IRT subway. As part of a modification to the IRT&#x27;s construction contracts made on January 18, 1910, the company was to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car express and six-car local trains. The City Hall station was not lengthened, but the platforms at other stations were extended, and six-car local trains began operating in October 1910.

In 1918, the Lexington Avenue Line opened north of Grand Central–42nd Street, and the original line was divided into an H-shaped system. All local trains were sent via the Lexington Avenue Line, running along the Pelham Line in the Bronx. In 1938, as part of a remodeling of City Hall Park, city parks commissioner Robert Moses proposed relocating the entrances of the IRT&#x27;s City Hall station and those of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT)&#x27;s adjacent City Hall station. The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940.

==== Decline ====
Increased subway ridership led to longer trains, and thus longer platforms, in the years after the subway&#x27;s construction. The City Hall station, built on a tight curve, would have been difficult to lengthen, and it was also quite close to the far busier Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall station. In addition, the new, longer trains had center doors in each car, which were an unsafe distance from the platform edge. Movable platform extensions were installed to fill the gap. By the 1930s, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; reported that the City Hall station was little used, &quot;and many of the younger generation have never seen it&quot;. During World War II, shortly before the station&#x27;s closure, the skylights were blacked out with tar for safety.

In its final years, the City Hall station was not open at night and on Sundays, when trains continued to South Ferry. The majority of passengers used the Brooklyn Bridge station, which was only about away. The Brooklyn Bridge IRT station provided both local and express service, including trains to Brooklyn, and it was much closer to the Brooklyn Bridge streetcar terminal and the BMT&#x27;s Park Row elevated station. The city also wanted to operate ten-car trains after taking over the IRT, but the City Hall station could only fit six cars. Given the extensive renovations that would have been required to bring the station up to modern standards and the fact that the city wanted to improve City Hall Park by removing the entrance kiosks, the city decided to close the station instead. The final day of service was December 31, 1945. The station recorded 255,000 entries in its final year, or about 800 entries per day. By contrast, the Brooklyn Bridge station had 14 million entries the same year.

=== Post-closure ===

In 1965, the City Hall station was considered as a possible location for a transit museum. In 1976, the New York City Transit Authority reopened the abandoned Court Street station in Brooklyn as the New York Transit Exhibit, which eventually became the New York Transit Museum (NYTM). The station occasionally was used for tours after its closure, including in 1979 for an event celebrating the subway&#x27;s 75th anniversary. In 1979, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the City Hall station as a city landmark, along with eleven other stations on the original IRT.

==== Proposals for reuse ====
By the 1980s, Mayor Ed Koch suggested allowing a restaurant to open in the old station as part of a larger plan to renovate City Hall Park. As part of this plan, replicas of the IRT&#x27;s original cast-iron entrance kiosks would have been built. Civic leaders and city officials visited the station in July 1986. Ross Sandler, the city&#x27;s transportation commissioner and a proponent of the station&#x27;s reopening, lamented that the station was a &quot;designated landmark that people can&#x27;t visit&quot;. The plan had still not advanced over a year later, when parks commissioner Henry J. Stern said the station&#x27;s restoration was dependent on whether funding to renovate City Hall Park was secured. Ultimately, the idea was overruled by the New York City Police Department, which expressed concerns that the station&#x27;s location beneath New York City Hall was a security vulnerability.

In April 1995, the NYTM sought funding to reopen the station as a branch of the museum. The New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) estimated that about $1 million would be needed just to reopen the station, though the NYTM wished to raise $3.5 million. The museum had secured a $750,000 federal grant and a $350,000 grant from the NYCTA by that November. By 1997, some $2 million in state and federal funding had been allocated. Had the NYTM branch been built, it would have contained two entrances from street level. Early the next year, MTA officials started refurbishing the station&#x27;s corridors and offered up to $5 million for underground repairs to City Hall Park, which at the time was being renovated. However, in late 1998, the administration of mayor Rudy Giuliani rejected the proposal, citing security risks in the area around City Hall after terrorist bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Plans for the museum annex were abandoned, and museum tours ceased for several years. The MTA did spend $2 million to repair structural issues at the City Hall station.

==== 21st century ====
By 2001, the NYCTA planned to temporarily reopen the station three years later for the subway&#x27;s 100th anniversary. The station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. For the subway&#x27;s Centennial Celebration the same year, one of the street entrances was restored, and the station was opened for the duration of the celebration. The idea of an annex to the Transit Museum was then proposed but due to security concerns (with City Hall being just above the station) the idea was dismissed. Other than that, the station was used only as an emergency exit. By the mid-2000s, the staff of the Transit Museum were again conducting tours of the station; only NYTM members were allowed on these tours. Unlike other abandoned New York City Subway stations, there was generally little graffiti or dust in the City Hall station. The station remained in good condition in 2019, though only one of the original skylights remained. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, the NYTM suspended its tours of the station between 2020 and 2023.

== Station layout ==

The station consists of a single balloon loop track along a concave side platform, which has a length of and could fit five subway cars. The track has a radius of curvature of , which resulted in gaps between the train doors and the platform. The fare control area was on a mezzanine slightly above platform level, connected to the platform by a single, wide staircase. Intended as the showpiece of the entire subway system, the City Hall station was designed in a completely different style from the remaining stations on the IRT subway.

According to the &quot;Railroad Gazette&quot;, all of the City Hall station&#x27;s public areas were designed &quot;with a view to the beauty of their appearance, as well as to their efficiency&quot;, since the station was &quot;a great public work&quot;. One observer wrote that there was &quot;not a straight line&quot; in the entire station when it was completed. The travel magazine &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot; ranked the station 12th in its list of &quot;the most beautiful subway stations in the world&quot; in November 2009. A replica of the station was built for the feature film &quot;Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them&quot;. According to NYTM officials, the station inspired the main characters&#x27; lair in the 1990 film &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;.

=== Design ===

The station was designed by Rafael Guastavino, and it makes extensive use of classic Guastavino tile to sheathe its soaring roof arches. The main consulting architects were Heins &amp; LaFarge, which designed all of the other IRT stations. This station is unusually elegant in architectural style, and is unique among the original IRT stations, employing Romanesque Revival architecture. The station was constructed by cut-and-cover construction. The bottom of the station shell contains a foundation of concrete no less than thick. There is a gap between the trough wall and the station walls, which are made of brick covered over by a tiled finish.

The ceiling is made of twelve Guastavino vaults. The ceiling surfaces are composed of white tiles, with green and brown tiles along the perimeter of each ceiling vault. The vaults were constructed of thin terracotta tiles bonded with a string mortar, added in successive layers to form a thin structural vault of great strength. Three vaults had leaded glass skylights, which opened upward to vault lights in City Hall Park. The skylights, designed with floral tracery, were blacked out during World War II and were restored in the 2000s. Additional lighting was supplied by twelve chandeliers hung from the center of the vaults, which contain floral motifs and nickel finishes. The chandeliers near the skylights have five arms, while the others have four.

The platform is made of poured concrete. The platforms still contain markings from where the platform extensions were formerly installed. The top half of the wall along the platform, under each of the arches, consists of Roman brick. At the bottom half of each wall is a marble course topped by a brick wainscoting and another marble course. On the platform walls are three blue-on-white faience plaques with letters reading , flanked by a pair of triangles and surrounded by green and buff tiles. Two of these plaques are rectangular, installed on the walls under the brick arches. The third is curved and is installed on an archway above the staircase that leads to the mezzanine. The mosaic tiles at all original IRT stations were manufactured by the American Encaustic Tile Company, which subcontracted the installations at each station. On the trackside wall, facing the platform, are three bronze plaques with the names of important figures involved in the original IRT&#x27;s construction, including Parsons, McDonald, Belmont, Rapid Transit Subway Construction Company officials, engineering staff, mayors, commissioners, and city comptrollers. Gutzon Borglum designed the plaques.

The walls of the staircase between mezzanine and platform level are covered with yellow, green, and blue tile. The mezzanine contains a vaulted ceiling with a quoin pattern, consisting of brown trim with white and green tiles. The center of the mezzanine has an oculus skylight, with light bulbs around the skylight. The walls of the mezzanine contain large glass tiles interspersed with opaque ceramic tile. Wire conduits and pipes have been installed onto the mezzanine walls. The mezzanine once had an ornamented oak ticket booth, which has since been removed.

=== Track layout ===
North of the City Hall station, the IRT Lexington Avenue Line carries four tracks. From west to east, these are the downtown local track, the downtown express track, the uptown express track, and the uptown local track. The loop connects the downtown and uptown local tracks. The track is slightly canted toward the inner wall of the loop. When the loop was completed, &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;one of the more important tasks of constrictive engineering which the subway presented is solved&quot;.

South of the Brooklyn Bridge station, there is a switch on the downtown local track, allowing trains to leave service and enter either of two storage tracks. Trains in service turn onto a balloon loop, continuing past the abandoned side platform on the west side of the loop, and returning to the Brooklyn Bridge station on the uptown local track. The uptown and downtown express tracks pass above the loop, continuing south.

=== Exits and access ===

There were two staircases from outside the City Hall building to the mezzanine of the station, each measuring wide. Heins &amp; LaFarge designed entrance and exit &quot;kiosks&quot; for the City Hall station and the other underground IRT stations. These structures were extremely ornate structures made of cast iron and glass, being inspired by those on the Budapest Metro, which themselves were inspired by ornate summer houses called &quot;kushks&quot;. Brooklyn-based manufacturer Hecla Iron Works manufactured the kiosks. Exit kiosks were distinguished by their four-sided pyramidal wire-glass skylights, while entrance kiosks had domed roofs with cast-iron shingles. The kiosks also carried ventilation shafts for the stations&#x27; restrooms, which were generally directly underneath each kiosk. One critic said the station&#x27;s original entrance and exit kiosks gave &quot;a foreign appearance&quot; to City Hall Park and compared the vaults to the interior of a mosque.

After the City Hall station closed, one staircase was covered over with a slab. The other staircase was covered with a set of metal cellar doors in the ground. On the surface, all that can be seen is a concrete slab inset with glass tiles, the skylights for the platform below. This patch of concrete is in the middle of a grove of dogwoods in front of City Hall, close to Broadway. At street level, in the pavement in front of City Hall, a plaque commemorates the groundbreaking for the subway in 1900.

The station can be viewed by passengers who stay on the as they travel around the loop to head back uptown. Under MTA policy, all riders on southbound must leave the train at Brooklyn Bridge, but the policy is rarely enforced; by the 2010s, the MTA was intentionally allowing riders to stay on the train. Artificial lighting has often been dimmed to save electricity, but the skylights provide some illumination during the daytime. The loop track is classified as a revenue track, since trains can carry passengers through the loop. The announcement programs on the R142A subway cars, which were formerly used on the , announced that trains would turn around via the loop and stop on the northbound platform at Brooklyn Bridge.

<text>The Hill District is a grouping of historically African American neighborhoods in the City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Beginning in the years leading up to World War I, &quot;the Hill&quot; was the cultural center of black life in the city and a major center of jazz. Despite its cultural and economic vibrancy, in the mid-1950s a substantial area was slated for redevelopment, displacing about 8,000 individuals.

==Geographic area==

The Hill District of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as of 2010 the area comprises Census Tracts 305 (Crawford Roberts, &quot;Lower Hill&quot;), 501 (Crawford-Roberts, &quot;Middle Hill&quot;), 506 (Upper Hill), 509 (Bedford Dwellings), 510 and 511 (Terrace Village). It is bordered by the Downtown on the west, the Strip District next to the Allegheny River and Polish Hill to the north, the Bluff (Uptown) on the southwest, and Oakland on the east and southeast.

The census tract/neighborhoods noted in the Hill District are represented on the Pittsburgh City Council by the council member for District 6 (Downtown neighborhoods). Part of the Upper Hill is also represented under District 7. The 15219 ZIP code covers all five neighborhoods, and the 15213 ZIP code covers part of Terrace Village and the Upper Hill.

==History==

Following the rebellion by slaves and gaining of independence of Haiti in 1804, the free African-American community of the Hill District, Pittsburgh&#x27;s oldest black community, was called &quot;Little Haiti.&quot; The early residents of the Hill District were middle-class free blacks. In 2004 the Pittsburgh City Council announced commemoration of the 200th anniversary of Haiti&#x27;s independence.

=== The Great Migration ===
Beginning in the 1910s, the Hill attracted migrants from elsewhere in the United States (particularly from the rural American South in the Great Migration) and from abroad, including many Italians and Eastern European Jews. The neighborhood&#x27;s black population grew rapidly from around 10,000 in 1890 to over 37,000 by 1920. The influx of so many new residents resulted in a housing shortage which was exacerbated by the rigid system of segregation that limited potential dwellings for blacks almost entirely to the Hill District. The experience of young, single black men underscored the severity of the housing crisis. By virtue of housing segregation and their marital status, these men crammed into the limited number of units available in the district. The result was an epidemic of cramped boarding houses where workers slept in shifts, as one 1969 study showed when it stated:

=== Center of Culture (1920s-1950s) ===
The Hill developed a vibrant entertainment district that turned the area into a cultural hub for music, especially the jazz genre. Black entrepreneurs established and ran a large roster of nightspots that included nightclubs, bars, and gambling dens, all of which required a constant influx of musical acts to keep guests entertained.This concentration of entertainment spots along Wylie Avenue, Fullerton Street, and Center Avenue provided ready venues for both famous national acts and upstart local artists to perform. A short list of the more well-known spots consisted of the following institutions:

* The Crawford Grill
* The Collins Inn
* The Humming Bird
* The Leader House
* The ToonTown Hub
* Derby Dan&#x27;s 
* Harlem Bar
* Musician&#x27;s Club
* Sawdust Trail
* The Fullerton Inn

The establishment of such robust entertainment infrastructure allowed for the proliferation of musical entertainment in the neighborhood, especially when it came to jazz. Nationally known artists such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington made the Hill District a regular stop on national tours. In fact it was after a performance at the Lincoln Tavern that the nationally syndicated black-run newspaper &quot;The Pittsburgh Courier&quot; crowned Ellington &quot;the King of Jazz.&quot;

The presence of such a vibrant entertainment district proved most instrumental to the development of Pittsburgh-reared jazz musicians. As historian Colter Harper notes, this thriving environment of entertainment venues served as a training ground for young innovators who needed regular employment to develop ideas and techniques, places in which to network with each other, audiences for feedback, and club managers to aid in accessing the music scene in other cities. The benefits of networking often showed themselves through mentor-ship opportunities, as famous musicians could provide young artists with crucial career and technical advice. This was the case with renowned Pittsburgh-reared jazz pianist Mary Lou Williams, whose distinct left-hand-dominated playing style could be traced back to her youthful interactions with touring vaudeville artist Jack Howard as he played shows in the city; Williams would later note that he gave her professional advice that &quot;would have taken me years and years to learn.&quot;

The thriving musical culture which was endemic to the Hill for close to four decades led the neighborhood to be considered as &quot;the Crossroads of the World&quot; by Harlem Renaissance poet Claude McKay. That phrase would be popularized by radio DJ Mary Dee (Mary Dudley), of WHOD Radio, Pittsburgh&#x27;s only black radio station.

===Economic decline===
The district had cultural vibrancy, and numerous successful entertainment venues and black-owned businesses, but much of the housing was aged and substandard. Following World War II, the federal government committed to upgrade housing across the nation, and in Pittsburgh, 95 acres of the Hill District were selected for redevelopment. In an article from 1943, George E. Evans, a member of the City Council, reasoned that public-private redevelopment could provide significant employment to returning war veterans, while ameliorating what he saw as an area beset by deterioration and urban blight. He wrote, 
&quot;The Hill District of Pittsburgh is probably one of the most outstanding examples in Pittsburgh of neighborhood deterioration... There are 7,000 separate property owners; more than 10,000 dwelling units and in all more than 10,000 buildings. Approximately 90 per cent of the buildings in the area are sub-standard and have long outlived their usefulness, and so there would be no social loss if they were all destroyed.&quot;Much of older housing in cities still lacked indoor plumbing and other amenities considered basic; planners did not fully take into account the effects of the disruption of residents and social networks by wholesale redevelopment of urban areas.

Evans represented the majority view of Pittsburgh politicians, including state representative Homer S. Brown. Born in West Virginia, Brown was the third African American to graduate from the University of Pittsburgh law school and was active in civic affairs. He established a law practice, became president of the local NAACP chapter, and served in the state legislature, supported by both black and white voters for eight consecutive terms. In the 1940s, working with David Lawrence, Richard King Mellon, and other business leaders, Brown drafted legislation that opened the way to &quot;urban renewal&quot; in the Hill District. During the next decade, he authorized the relocation of 1,500 black families to make way for the Civic Arena. He was elected as Allegheny County&#x27;s first African-American judge, sitting in Pittsburgh.

In the summer of 1956, some 1,300 structures were razed, displacing about 1,500 families (more than 8000 residents), the great majority of whom were black. This cleared the way for the construction of the Civic Arena and adjacent parking, to support downtown events and attract major entertainment. But, the redevelopment severed the Hill District from surrounding neighborhoods, resulting in its dramatic economic decline. This structural problem was exacerbated by the decline of Pittsburgh&#x27;s population more generally, as jobs disappeared due to industrial restructuring, and numerous middle-class residents moved out to newer suburban housing. Between 1950 and 1990, the Hill lost 71% of its residents (more than 38,000 individuals) and about 400 businesses, leaving the neighborhood hollowed out.

Many people displaced from the Hill moved into the East Liberty and Homewood-Brushton neighborhoods. In a ripple effect, middle-class families (both white and black) left these areas and moved to newer suburban housing.

===The Hill District today===
Since the late 20th century, the city and public interest groups have worked to renew the area. Because of the loss of jobs and businesses, many residents suffer from poverty. The District has struggled for decades with varying levels of dilapidation and crime. About 40 percent of the Hill District&#x27;s residents live below poverty level. The vast majority of residents in the 21st century are black or African American; about 6 percent of the population is white. For 30 years the residents did not have a supermarket and also lacked a pharmacy for many years.

A project to open a new grocery store on the Hill came to fruition in late 2013. Centre Heldman Plaza, wholly owned by the Hill House Economic Development Corporation, is a grocery store anchored retail center with fast-casual food and businesses services. The YMCA opened a $9 million branch in the neighborhood, complete with a rooftop garden. A group of investors has organized to restore the New Granada Theater, a historic jazz club where Ella Fitzgerald and Duke Ellington once performed. A new dropout recovery high school, the Hill House Passport Academy Charter School, opened in 2014 and by 2016 had graduated 132 students. Duquesne University opened a new pharmacy in the neighborhood in December 2010, the first university-operated community pharmacy in the United States.

==In art and popular culture==
The Hill District was the setting for nine of the 10 plays in August Wilson&#x27;s Pittsburgh Cycle.

The TV series &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; was possibly named for the district. Steven Bochco, a writer for the show, attended college at the nearby Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and based the show at least partially on the neighborhood.

The area was popularized in the work of the rapper Jimmy Wopo.

<text>John Cairns (23 August 1818 – 12 March 1892) was a Scottish Presbyterian minister.

==Life==
He was born at Ayton Hill, Berwickshire, on 23 August 1818, the son of John Cairns, a shepherd, and his wife, Alison Murray.

Educated at Ayton and Old Cambus, Berwickshire, he was for three years a herd boy, doing meanwhile private work for his school-master. In 1834, he entered the University of Edinburgh, and, while diversifying his curriculum with teaching in his native parish and elsewhere, became the most distinguished student of his day. Sir William Hamilton (1788–1856), in some instances, discussed Cairns&#x27;s metaphysical opinions at considerable length in the class-room, and Professor Wilson highly eulogised his talents and his attainments in literature, philosophy, and science. Speaking to his class of a certain mathematical problem that Cairns had solved, Professor Kelland said that it had been solved by only one other of his thousands of students. Cairns was associated with Alexander Campbell Fraser, David Masson, and other leading students in organising the Metaphysical Society for weekly philosophical discussions. He graduated MA in 1841, being facile princeps in classics and philosophy, and equal first in mathematics.

Having entered the Presbyterian Secession Hall in 1840, Cairns continued his brilliant career as a student. In 1843 the movement that culminated in the formation of the Free Church aroused his interest, and an article of his in the &#x27;Secession Magazine&#x27; prompted inquiries regarding the writer from Thomas Chalmers. At the end of 1843, Cairns officiated for a month in an English independent chapel at Hamburg, and he spent the winter and spring of 1843–4 at Berlin, ardently studying the German language, philosophy, and theology. On 1 May, he went on a three months&#x27; tour through Germany, Austria, Italy, and Switzerland, writing home descriptive and critical letters of great interest. Returning to Scotland, he was licensed as a preacher on 3 February 1845, and on 6 August of the same year he was ordained minister of Golden Square Church, Berwick-on-Tweed. Here he became one of the foremost of Scottish preachers—notable for certain quaint but attractive peculiarities of manner, but above all for his force and impressiveness of appeal—and he declined several invitations to important charges, metropolitan and other, and to professorships both in Great Britain and Canada.

In 1849, visiting the English lakes, Cairns met Wordsworth, from whom he elicited some characteristic views on philosophy and the descriptive graces of Cowper. Interesting himself in public questions at home, he delivered his first great platform speech at Berwick in 1856, when he successfully combated a proposal favouring the introduction into Scotland of the methods of the continental Sunday. In 1857, he addressed in German the members of the Evangelical Alliance in Berlin, having been chosen to represent English-speaking Christendom on the occasion. In 1858 the University of Edinburgh conferred on him the honorary degree of D.D., and in 1859, on the death of John Lee (1779–1859), principal of the university, he declined the invitation of the Edinburgh town councillors to be nominated as his successor.

From 1863 to 1873, the question of union between the United Presbyterian Church and the Free Church of Scotland occupied much of Cairn&#x27;s attention, but the difficulty was unripe for settlement. Meanwhile, in August 1867, Cairns became professor of apologetics in the United Presbyterian Theological Hall, retaining his charge at Berwick. His students testify to his zeal and success, especially recalling his insistence on the essential harmony between culture and reason. His numerous engagements impaired his strength, and in the autumn of 1868 he recruited on the continent, continuing the process next spring by a walking tour on the Scottish borders, and spending the following autumn in Italy. In May 1872, he was moderator of the United Presbyterian synod, and a few weeks later he officially represented his church in Paris at the first meeting of the Reformed Synod of France. On 16 May 1876, he was appointed joint professor of systematic theology and apologetics with James Harper, principal of the United Presbyterian Theological College. On 18 June, he preached a powerful and touching farewell sermon to an enormous congregation, thus severing his official connection with Berwick, where, however, he frequently preached afterwards.

In the spring of 1877, at the request of Bishop Laughton, Cairns lectured on Christianity in London in the interests of the Jews, and in April the Free Church, making the first exception in his case, appointed him its Cunningham lecturer. In the autumn, he preached for some weeks at Christiania, responding to an invitation to check a threatened schism in the state church of Norway.

He preached in Norsk, specially learned for the purpose. Next summer he was a fortnight in Paris, in connection with the M&#x27;All missions, and on the way formed one of a deputation of Scottish ministers who expressed sympathy with Mr. Gladstone in his attitude on the Bulgarian atrocities. While thus assisting elsewhere he worked hard at the United Presbyterian synod this same year in connection with the declaratory act of the church. Diversity of occupation and interest—even on occasion the learning of a new language—seemed indispensable for the exercise of his extraordinary energies and activities. On the death of Principal Harper he was appointed principal of the United Presbyterian Theological College, 8 May 1879. He delivered the Cunningham lecture in 1880, his subject being the unbelief of the eighteenth century. Five months of the same year he spent in an American tour, his personality and preaching everywhere making a deep impression. About the same time he was chairman of a committee of eminent Protestant theologians, European and American, who discussed the possibility of formulating a common creed for the reformed churches.

In 1884, on the occasion of her tercentenary celebrations, University of Edinburgh included Cairns among the distinguished Scotsmen on whom she conferred the honorary degree of LL.D. The death of a colleague in 1886 greatly increased his work, and yet about this time he completed a systematic study of Arabic, and between 1882 and 1886 he had learned Danish and Dutch, the former to qualify him for a meeting of the Evangelical Alliance at Copenhagen, and the latter to enable him to read Kuenen&#x27;s theological works in the original. In May 1888, his portrait, by W. E. Lockhart, R.A., was presented to the synod by united presbyterian ministers and laymen. He spent some time of 1890 in Berlin and Amsterdam, mainly acquainting himself with the ways of younger theologians. On his return he wrote an elaborate article on current theology for the &quot;Presbyterian and Reformed Review.&quot; In July 1891, he preached his last sermon in the church of his brother at Stitchel, near Kelso, and in the autumn of that year the doctors forbade further professional work. He resigned his post on 23 February following, and he died at 10 Spence Street, Edinburgh, on 12 March 1892.

He was buried in Echo Bank Cemetery in southern Edinburgh, now known as Newington Cemetery. A large monument against the northern boundary marks his grave.

==Family==
Cairns never married, and from 1856 onwards his housekeeper was his sister Janet.

<text>Frederik Pohl&#x27;s Gateway is a 1992 interactive fiction video game released by Legend Entertainment, and written by Glen Dahlgren and Mike Verdu. It is based on Frederik Pohl&#x27;s Heechee universe. It was followed by a sequel &quot;Gateway II: Homeworld&quot;, in 1993.

In 1996 Legend Entertainment made the game available for free download from its website.

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
A century in the future, humans land on Venus and colonize it. Below the surface, thousands of miles of artificial tunnels are discovered. They are believed to have been built thousands of years ago by an alien species known as the Heechee, but little else is known about them until an explorer discovers a Heechee ship, intact and operational, in one of the tunnels.

Rather than report his findings, he climbs in and activates it. The ship launches and goes into &quot;TAU Space,&quot; a faster-than-light travel method. It arrives at a huge space station carved out of an asteroid floating halfway between Venus and Mercury, which is full of thousands of similar ships, but otherwise empty. However, the explorer is unable to figure out how to return to Venus, and faced with a lack of supplies, figures out how to detonate the fuel cell of the ship he came in. The detonation kills him, but also attracts the attention of a NASA tracking station, who send an expedition to investigate.

The discovery of the station and its ships allow humanity to travel into deep space. Although they were unable to reverse engineer the Heechee technology, they can use the ships&#x27; stored destinations and the station becomes humanity&#x27;s &quot;Gateway&quot; to outer space, hence the name. This almost leads to war among the superpowers of Earth over ownership, until a compromise is finally worked out. A co-operative called the &quot;Gateway Corporation&quot; is formed, with the superpowers each holding one quarter of company stock.

The alien ships that are found still function, but their built-in destinations are a mystery. Navigation is accomplished by using 5 digit codes with the ships&#x27; computers, but there is no way to tell what codes go where. Volunteers called prospectors come to Gateway to test the codes and pilot the ships to their destination, explore and report back what they find (as well as bring anything interesting back). A large majority of the prospectors return with little or nothing, a tenth never return, but the remaining 1.5% return with artifacts or knowledge that make them incredibly rich.

===Plot===
The player character has won a one-way ticket to Gateway, membership as a prospector in the Gateway Corporation and 10 days of provided life support along with a small amount of money. The player begins as a Prospector and follows procedures in order to know Gateway better and afterwards begin exploring Heechee coordinates. The findings are important enough to get him secure &#x27;Green Badge&#x27; status; prospectors of that status are sent to explore only known destinations, with considerably higher probabilities of Heechee finds.

Exploration in one such planet brings a Heechee &#x27;computer&#x27; which makes him rich; however, after being analyzed by the Gateway Corporation, it reveals that a hostile alien race, dubbed &quot;the Assassins&quot; threatens all advanced civilizations in the universe, and the Heechee managed to evade them. Leonard Worden, the deputy chief of the exploration program, informs the player that even after all those years, reactivation of the Heechee technology by humans would only make them detectable to the Assassins. However the same computer provides coordinates to an interplanetary shield device.

The game plot then sends the player to four planets in order to activate a shield device that would &#x27;cloak&#x27; the technology signal from the Assassins.

The game&#x27;s climax occurs on a world of the Assassins, dubbed &quot;Watchtower&quot; where the player is sent to activate the mechanism. There he will meet a Heechee artificial intelligence entity and also an electronic Assassin entity which will trap the player in a VR environment. Following the Heechee AI&#x27;s guidance, the player is tasked to escape them by creating paradoxes and afterwards upload the Heechee AI.

The game ends with the player&#x27;s return as a hero and the fear that the threat of the Assassins still exists.

==Relationship to the novels==
The games are based on Frederik Pohl&#x27;s novels, but deviate significantly. &quot;Gateway&quot; shares its premise with Pohl&#x27;s first book, of a poor space prospector who arrives on the eponymous space station with the intent to use the dangerously poorly understood alien crafts that are based there to explore distant worlds and strike it rich. The similarities soon end as the game introduces original elements, changes (in the novel&#x27;s terms: travel times are negligible, Gateway has Earth-normal gravity, all ships are ones and bastard control panels are the norm) and material from the later books.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Charles Ardai stated that &quot;Pohl&#x27;s influence is felt throughout&quot; &quot;Gateway&quot; except in the puzzles, which were &quot;pretty good&quot; but based on &quot;the last decade of adventure game design ... most would not be out of place in a golden oldie like &quot;Starcross&quot; or &quot;Planetfall&quot;&quot;, especially the &quot;jarring and inappropriate&quot; logic puzzles. He approved of the game&#x27;s graphics and sound but stated that he mostly ignored them because &quot;&quot;Gateway&quot; is essentially a text adventure with amenities&quot;. Ardai disapproved of the game&#x27;s small number of locations, which the large number of puzzles and repetitive &quot;stall tactics&quot; obscured, and the possibility that a player might never die (which &quot;seems to directly contradict the premise of the game&quot;). He concluded that &quot;Gateway&quot; was &quot;good enough&quot; but &quot;nothing about the game makes it compelling&quot;, predicting that it &quot;will most likely join &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; and their like in a dusty corner of adventure game history&quot;. Writing for &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot;, Greg Ellsworth found the game easier than &quot;Timequest&quot; and &quot;Spellcasting 101&quot;, but enjoyed its graphics, music and story. He concluded that for those &quot;looking for weeks of game play and puzzle solving it may seem a disappointment, but for an entertaining story it hits the spot.&quot;

Jim Trunzo reviewed &quot;Frederik Pohl&#x27;s Gateway&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #33 (Sept./Oct., 1992), rating it a 4.5 out of 5 and stated that &quot;&quot;Frederik Pohl&#x27;s Gateway&quot; will provide gamers with a refreshingly different challenge and expose them to what is truly top-of-the-line graphics. A fringe benefit might be introducing new readers to Pohl&#x27;s excellent science fiction.&quot;

<text>Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing is a federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 2004. The area was represented by the riding of Algoma from 1867 to 1904 and from 1968 to 1996 and then by Algoma—Manitoulin from 1996 to 2004.

==Demographics==
&quot;According to the 2021 Canadian census&quot;

* Languages: 68.7% English, 23.6% French, 1.3% Ojibway, 1.1% German
* Religions: 65.2% Christian (40.5% Catholic, 6.6% United Church, 4.5% Anglican, 1.1% Baptist, 1.1% Pentecostal, 11.4% Other), 1.7% Indigenous Spirituality, 31.7% None
* Median income: $37,200 (2020)
* Average income: $46,520 (2020)

==Geography==
The district includes the eastern, northern and central parts of Algoma District, the extreme northwestern part and extreme southwestern part of Sudbury District, the extreme southeastern part of Thunder Bay District, all of Manitoulin District, and western Cochrane District along the Trans Canada highway. Large communities include Elliot Lake, Kapuskasing, Hearst, Espanola, Wawa, Manitouwadge, Blind River, Sables-Spanish Rivers, Chapleau, and Northeastern Manitoulin and the Islands. The area is 103,364 km2.

==History==
The electoral district was created in 2003. 71.7% of the population of the riding came from Algoma—Manitoulin, and 28.3% from Timmins-James Bay.

Algoma was created in the British North America Act and consisted of the Provisional Judicial District of Algoma District. In 1882, the district consisted of the area between the Provisional Thunder Bay District and the Province of Manitoba. In 1892, it consisted of all areas of Ontario west of the Nipissing electoral district, and also included Manitoulin Island and the islands around it. The district was abolished in 1903 when it was redistributed into Algoma East and Algoma West ridings.

A new Algoma district was created from Algoma East and Algoma West in 1966. It consisted of most of Algoma District except the extreme north and northwestern portions, and Sault Ste. Marie. It also included Manitoulin Island, nearby islands, and the southwestern corner of Sudbury. In 1976, the district was expanded to the north, and to include the suburbs of Sault Ste. Marie, Whitefish River Indian Reserve, and more of the southwestern part of Sudbury District.

In 1987, it was expanded to include part of the city of Sault Ste. Marie, the part of Rankin Indian Reserve within city limits, more of western Sudbury District, all of Manitoulin District, and much of southcentral Sudbury District. There were also some boundary changes in the north part of the Algoma district.

In 1996, the district consisted of all of Algoma District except Sault Ste. Marie, the northwestern corner and the southwestern corner of Sudbury District, Manitoulin District, and the southeastern corner of Thunder Bay District.

In 1997, the name of the district was changed to Algoma—Manitoulin.

Most of the riding was redistributed in 2003 into Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing, with small parts going to Nickel Belt and Sault Ste. Marie ridings.

This riding gained territory from Sault Ste. Marie and Nickel Belt during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

<doc id="728717" wikidata="Q4020900" url="?curid=728717" title="World Indoor Football League">
<text>The World Indoor Football League was an indoor football league that was to begin in 1988 to compete with the Arena Football League, which was playing its second season in 1988. Some of the teams in the league ran into financial trouble before their season was to begin, and thus the league never came to fruition.

Like the Arena Football League, the WIFL was to use rebound nets (the AFL&#x27;s since-expired patent on them had not yet taken effect), but only to prevent losing balls: any ball that made contact with the nets would be declared dead, similar to a rule instituted by the National Hockey League over a decade later. The WIFL also encouraged high offense, but in a different way: instead of restricting the motion of defensive players as the AFL did (and still does), the WIFL proposed using a permanent version of the power play by placing eight players on offense and only seven on defense, creating an 8-on-7 advantage for the offensive team.

The WIFL planned a 10-game schedule in the summer months, followed by a championship which would revive the name of the World Bowl (last used in 1974 by the outdoor World Football League). Players would be paid US$500 per game (a relatively high sum) or a third of ticket revenue, whichever was greater. The league also had a television contract with FNN-SCORE.

Eleven days prior to the WIFL&#x27;s debut, however, Baltimore and San Antonio folded, and Indiana followed suit. Not desiring to move forward with only three teams in the league, the remaining franchises instead sought to join the AFL to begin play in 1989. When the AFL reportedly set the expansion fee in the seven-figure range (allegedly to purposefully discourage the WIFL teams from joining), the three teams could not meet those demands and folded. The AFL would not have another competing indoor league until 1998.

<text>Johann Georg August Galletti (19 August 1750 – 16 March 1828) was a German historian and geographer.

Galletti was born in Altenburg, Holy Roman Empire. His fame is not based on his merits as an academic, but on his reputation as the creator of a few hundreds of stylistic howlers, becoming a legend as &quot;Kathederblüten&quot; (teacher&#x27;s howlers) originated during his time as a professor at the Ernestine Gymnasium in Gotha. He was known as the &quot;absent-minded professor of Gotha&quot; and died there aged 77.

Some &quot;Kathederblüten&quot; of Galletti:
* After the Battle of Leipzig you could see horses with three, four, or even more legs shot off running loose all over the countryside.
* Deiotarus was his father&#x27;s son.
* Indeed, Councillor, I am well pleased with Blädner, but with Seifert not at all; but at least he&#x27;s better than Blädner.
* So you think that history is as easy as playing schnapsen? Ha! You can learn history in a flash, but learning schnapsen takes years of hard graft.
* The African Lion usually grows up to the age of ten, and from then on, its size simply increases.
* Alexander would have gone on to conquer all Asia; but he&#x27;s going to die soon.
* And thus, there ensued an entire war on page 94.
* I&#x27;ve exited the monk too early. His exit doesn&#x27;t come earlier than right now.
* Today, I&#x27;m once again seeing so many students that aren&#x27;t there!
* Watch out, I&#x27;m going to slap you if you aren&#x27;t disobedient at once!
* Charlemagne won as often against the Saxons that in the end they wouldn&#x27;t even wait for it any-more.
* Among the masterpieces of Demosthenes, we have his celebrated speech on the wreath. This speech is well known to begin with the immortal words: &quot;Which rascal is throwing spit wads here again?&quot;
* And you, Schäfer, you don&#x27;t belong amongst decent people at all. Come to me at the lectern in front.
* The Persians cried out loud: &quot;Good Lord Jesus, the Athenians are coming!&quot; and threw themselves into the sea.
* The Venetian constitution is a mixed aristocracy which it is very difficult to get out of again.
* The pig is justly named that way, for it is a very dirty animal.
* The soldiers threw their weapons away and said: &quot;pardon [me]&quot;. (&quot;asking for pardon&quot; means &quot;asking for quarter&quot; in German)

<doc id="728727" wikidata="Q3161092" url="?curid=728727" title="James Frederick Ferrier">
<text>James Frederick Ferrier (16 June 1808 – 11 June 1864) was a Scottish metaphysical writer and philosopher. He introduced the word &quot;epistemology&quot; in philosophical English, as well as coining agnoiology for the study of ignorance.

==Education and early writings==

Ferrier was born at 15 Heriot Row in Edinburgh, the son of John Ferrier, writer to the signet. He was educated at the Royal High School, the University of Edinburgh and Magdalen College, Oxford, and subsequently, his metaphysical tastes having been fostered by his intimate friend, Sir William Hamilton, spent some time at Heidelberg studying German philosophy.

In 1840 he is listed as an advocate living at 14 Carlton Street in the Stockbridge area of Edinburgh.

In 1842 he was appointed professor of civil history at Edinburgh University, still living at Carlton Street. In 1845 professor of moral philosophy and political economy at the University of St Andrews. He was twice an unsuccessful candidate for chairs in Edinburgh, for that of moral philosophy on Wilson&#x27;s resignation in 1852, and for that of logic and metaphysics in 1856, after Hamilton&#x27;s death. He remained at St Andrews until his death.

==Family==

James Ferrier married his cousin, Margaret Anne Wilson, daughter of his mother&#x27;s brother, the writer John Wilson, who wrote under the pseudonym Christopher North. His younger brother was named John Wilson Ferrier.

Ferrier had five children, one of whom became the wife of Sir Alexander Grant. He was also the great-great-grandfather of Ludovic Kennedy.
He died in St Andrews (possibly of syphilis) and is buried with his aunt Susan Ferrier in St. Cuthberts Churchyard in Edinburgh just to the north-east of the church.

==Early career==
Ferrier&#x27;s first contribution to metaphysics was a series of articles in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (1838–1839), entitled &quot;An Introduction to the Philosophy of Consciousness&quot;. In these he condemns previous philosophers for ignoring in their psychological investigations the fact of consciousness, which is the distinctive feature of man, and confining their observation to the so-called states of the mind. He argues as follows:

These articles were succeeded by a number of others, of which the most important were &quot;The Crisis of Modern Speculation&quot; (1841), &quot;Berkeley and Idealism&quot; (1842), and an important examination of Hamilton&#x27;s edition of Reid (1847), which contains a vigorous attack on the philosophy of common sense. Ferrier pronounces the perception of matter to be the &quot;ne plus ultra&quot; of thought, and declares that Reid, for presuming to analyse it, is in fact a representationist, although he professed to be an intuitionist. Ferrier distinguishes between the perception of matter and our apprehension of the perception of matter. Psychology, he asserts, vainly tries to analyse the former, while metaphysics shows the latter alone to be analysable. Metaphysics separates the subjective element, our apprehension, from the objective element, the perception of matter; not matter &quot;per se&quot;, but the perception of matter is the existence independent of the individual&#x27;s thought. However, he says, it cannot be independent of thought; it must belong to some mind, and is therefore the property of the Divine Mind. There, he thinks, is an indestructible foundation for an &quot;a priori&quot; argument for the existence of God.

==Later writings==
Ferrier&#x27;s matured philosophical doctrines find expression in the &quot;Institutes of Metaphysic: The Theory of Knowing and Being&quot; (1854), in which he claims to have met the twofold obligation resting on every system of philosophy, that it should be reasoned and true. His method is that of Spinoza, strict demonstration, or at least an attempt at it. All the errors of natural thinking and psychology must fall under one or other of three topics: Knowing and the Known, Ignorance, and Being. These are all-comprehensive, and are therefore the departments into which philosophy is divided, for the sole end of philosophy is to correct the inadvertencies of ordinary thinking.

Self-evident truths concerning knowing and the known are discussed in the &quot;Institutes of Metaphysic&quot; (Ferrier is thought to have coined the term epistemology in this work, p. 46). It explains that the fact that any intelligence, in addition to knowing whatever it knows, must as the ground or condition of its knowledge have some cognizance of itself as the basis of the whole philosophical system. In addition, the only possible kind of knowable is one which is both known of an object and known by a subject (Object + Subject, or Thing + Intelligence). This leads to the conclusion that the only independent universe which any mind can think of is the universe in synthesis with some other mind or ego.

The leading contradiction which is corrected in the &quot;Agnoiology or Theory of Ignorance&quot; claims that there can be an ignorance of that of which there can be no knowledge. It is corrected by appealing to the fact that ignorance is a defect, and argues that there is no defect in not knowing what cannot be known by any intelligence (for example, that two and two make five), and therefore there can be an ignorance only of that of which there can be a knowledge, that is, of some-object-plus-some-subject. Therefore, the knowable alone is the ignorable. Ferrier lays special claim to originality for this division of the Institutes.

&quot;The Ontology or Theory of Being&quot; forms a discussion of the origin of knowledge, in which Ferrier traces all the perplexities and errors of philosophers to the assumption of the absolute existence of matter. The conclusion arrived at is that the only true real and independent existences are minds-together-with-that-which-they-apprehend, and that the one strictly necessary absolute existence is a supreme and infinite and everlasting mind in synthesis with all things.

The 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; adjudges Ferrier&#x27;s works as remarkable for their unusual charm and simplicity of style, qualities which are especially noticeable in the &quot;Lectures on Greek Philosophy&quot;, one of the best introductions on the subject in the English language.

A complete edition of his philosophical writings was published in 1875, with a memoir by Edmund Law Lushington. See also the monograph by Elizabeth Sanderson Haldane in the &quot;Famous Scots Series&quot; (link below).

<text>Thirteen Day Getaway is the second and final studio album by the punk rock band CIV. It was released on April 7, 1998, on Atlantic Records. The album is dedicated to Raybeez.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; wrote that &quot;Civ&#x27;s clean, moderately paced, somewhat melodic pop punk, topped by Anthony Civorelli&#x27;s monotonous, nasal vocals, makes the group sound like hundreds of other post-Green Day pop punk bands.&quot; &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; called the album &quot;top-loaded with songs that suggest CIV knows how to spike pop hooks with a punk charge, to use melody rather than refuse it.&quot;

<doc id="728736" wikidata="Q532248" url="?curid=728736" title="Sterling Price">
<text>Sterling Price (September 14, 1809 – September 29, 1867) was an American politician and military officer who was a senior officer of the Confederate States Army, fighting in both the Western and Trans-Mississippi theater of the American Civil War. He rose to prominence during the Mexican–American War and served as governor of Missouri from 1853 to 1857. He is remembered today for his service in Arkansas (1862–1865) and for his defeat at the Battle of Westport on October 23, 1864.

==Early life and entrance into politics==
===Virginia===
Sterling Price was born in Prince Edward County, Virginia, near Farmville, to a family of planters of Welsh origin. His parents, Pugh and Elizabeth Price, owned 12 slaves and have been described as &quot;moderately wealthy&quot;. Sources disagree as to Sterling&#x27;s date of birth. The historian Albert E. Castel states that Price was born on September 11, 1809, a date with which the State Historical Society of Missouri agrees. The historian Ezra J. Warner provides the date of birth as September 20, 1809.

Price&#x27;s father and older brother fought in the War of 1812. Sterling attended a now-unknown grammar school and worked on his father&#x27;s tobacco plantation before entering Hampden–Sydney College in the fall of 1826. Price did not return for the 1827–28 session for unknown reasons (Price&#x27;s biographer Robert E. Shalhope speculates that poor examination grades or financial problems could have been the cause), and instead went to study law in Cumberland County, Virginia, under the jurist Creed Taylor.

Records do not indicate that Taylor&#x27;s law school was in operation for the 1828–29 term, and Price became an assistant to a court clerk in Prince Edward County in 1828. According to Shalhope, Price did not receive &quot;more than a minimal legal education&quot;. Shalhope attributes the political climate of Prince Edward County at that time to lasting political beliefs of Price, including support for slavery, a dislike of debt, and tendency to oppose change; the region politically supported John Randolph of Roanoke. The decade of the 1820s saw economic troubles in Virginia, with a mid-1810s surge in tobacco prices being followed by a collapse in prices which ruined many merchants and shippers. Poor economic conditions persisted through the 1820s, and Pugh Price decided to move his family to the state of Missouri, where tobacco production competed with Virginia&#x27;s tobacco and slavery was legal. The Price family reached Missouri in either 1830 or 1831 and temporarily settled near Fayette.

===Missouri===
The stay in Fayette was designed solely to give Pugh time to select good tobacco-farming ground, and the family moved to the Keytesville vicinity in Chariton County in the summer of 1831. The area was part of a region known as the Boonslick, which contained a number of other former Virginia planters. On May 14, 1833, Price married Martha Head, the daughter of a local judge; the couple would have five sons, one daughter, and several children who did not survive childhood. Having entered into a business partnership with one Walter Chiles, Price worked as a merchant, served in the local militia, and began to purchase land both at a nearby river landing and on the prairie in the area.

Price was selected as the area&#x27;s representative to a Democratic state convention in January 1835, which presented potentially significant political opportunities. The convention was strongly Jacksonian, and nominated Martin Van Buren for the Democratic presidential nominee, Thomas Hart Benton for vice presidential nominee, and a slate of state-level candidates. And then, later that same year, Pugh deeded Sterling most of the land of the Price family farm, making him one of the largest landowners in Chariton County. Price was appointed postmaster for Keytesville in April, and began campaigning for election to the Missouri General Assembly in August. Price was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives, and was placed on two committees. After the session began on November 21, 1836, Price put forth a resolution calling for action on a bill to charter a state bank in Missouri. While a state bank was against Jacksonian principles, a bill chartering a state bank with limits on its powers was passed in January 1837, having been supported by Price and the other politicians from the Boonslick area. Also passed was a bill criminalizing actions that encouraged a slave rebellion. Price, who viewed slavery as a necessary component of Southern aristocracy, viewed this positively and also added an amendment requiring governmental compensation for slaves executed by the state to another bill.

The session adjourned on February 6, and Price returned home.

===Missouri Mormon War===
In 1836, the state of Missouri had established Caldwell County specifically for settlement by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons). As additional Mormons settled in the area, they began to expand from Caldwell County. Tensions rose over time, and a riot occurred in Gallatin on August 6, 1838, when Mormons attempted to vote outside of Caldwell County. After the riot, Mormon leaders Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon led 150 armed citizens, including a number of Danites, to the Mormon settlement of Adam-ondi-Ahman in Daviess County. Two days later, part of the group visited a local judge, asking him to sign a statement disavowing support for any anti-Mormon violence and containing a promise to uphold the law. The judge considered the statement a violation of his judicial oath not to favor special interest groups, and refused to sign, later traveling with a few others to Richmond, where he issued a complaint against the Mormons for starting frontier war. Arrest warrants were issued for three key Mormon leaders, but they refused to enter custody.

During the election campaign before the Gallatin riot, Price had heard from Josiah Morin, a judge and Missouri State Senate candidate who was on friendly terms with the Mormons, that Morin would likely be forced from his home if he lost his electoral campaign. Represented by Alexander Doniphan and David Rice Atchison, the Mormon leaders stood trial before judge Austin A. King on a farm near the Daviess County line on September 7. King determined that there was enough evidence to warrant a trial before a grand jury, and set the defendants under bail. Doniphan, Atchison, and the defendants returned to the Mormon settlement of Far West. The citizens of Chariton County sent a delegation led by Price to investigate the situation. Along with Edgar Flory, Price attended the trial and then met with Atchison and the Mormon leaders in Far West. Flory and Price wrote a letter back to Chariton County stating that they believed that the actions of the Mormons had not been as reported, and that the legal action had been started by the Daviess County citizens to stir up trouble.

Things appeared to be trending peaceably, but an incident in which Mormon militiamen in Daviess County captured three anti-Mormons and a cache of weapons resparked violence. A force of 400 militiamen under the command of Doniphan was mustered, and the three prisoners were taken back on September 12. Violence recurred in early October, and Doniphan and some militia from neighboring counties were called out again. Before Doniphan&#x27;s men arrived, the Mormons abandoned the settlement of DeWitt, but then attacked and burned Gallatin and the community of Millport on October 18. Mormon forces and Missouri militia fought the Battle of Crooked Creek on October 25. Exaggerated reports reached Missouri political authorities, and two days later, Governor of Missouri Lilburn Boggs issued the Mormon Extermination Order, which included the statement that &quot;The Mormons must be treated as enemies and must be exterminated or driven from the state&quot;.

Boggs also ordered the state militia to deal with the situation; Price commanded the militia from Chariton County. In early November, militia forces took control of Far West, and under the command of John Bullock Clark, Mormons considered to be guilty were rounded up for trial. Price commanded a force that escorted captured Mormon leaders from Independence to Richmond. The men under Price&#x27;s command treated their prisoners poorly during the movement; Price did not intervene. When the residents of Keytesville met in January 1839, Price was part of a four-person group that drafted a resolution describing their thoughts about the conflict. The resolution supported Boggs&#x27;s actions and approved of the measures taken to respond to the violence.

===Return to the legislature===
Due to his involvement in the conflict with the Mormons, Price did not serve a second term in the state legislature. The mercantile business with Chiles had struggled, so Price dissolved the entity, paid off his share of its debts, and formed a new enterprise with Lisbon Applegate. He was also appointed to a position with the Fayette branch of the recently-approved state bank. By 1840, his farming endeavors had become prosperous, and Price had several dozen slaves. In August 1840, he was elected to another term in the Missouri House of Representatives. Despite his lack of experience in the legislature and young age, there was talk of making Price Speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives, and after the legislature convened in November, he was elected unanimously to that position. The Boonslick faction was strong in Missouri politics at that time. In January 1841, Price was part of a Democratic Party majority that voted against a bill that would have allowed limited partnerships, despite Price having suffered in business ventures previously due to unlimited liability.

As Speaker, Price introduced a series of resolutions about slavery. Governor Thomas Reynolds had sent a letter to the House after receiving communication from the governor of Virginia asking for legal cooperation from the other states that allowed slavery after Governor of New York William H. Seward stated that he would not allow the return of escaped slaves to the south. The resolutions accused Seward of violating the Constitution of the United States, stated that Missourians would make &quot;common cause with the said slaveholding States [&quot;sic&quot;]&quot;, and suggested a boycott of products from New York. While the proposed boycott was struck, the rest of the resolutions passed.

Price was reelected to the legislature in 1842, but the Democratic Party in Missouri was losing internal solidarity, with splits over hard money and soft money currency policies and a feeling in other parts of the state that central Missouri held too much power. A soft money advocate from St. Louis nominated Jesse B. Thompson to run against the hard-money Price in the speaker&#x27;s election, but Price was elected 72–11. According to Shalhope, Price was &quot;only an adequate parliamentarian and a poor orator&quot;, and Claiborne Fox Jackson served as floor leader. Price&#x27;s role was more to convince legislators to tow the party line and create support for controversial bills. Shalhope writes that Price elicited an &quot;almost blind loyalty among many Missourians&quot;; Price was becoming charismatic in the legislature, although his opponents considered him to be vain.

In 1844, Price campaigned for Benton&#x27;s reelection to the United States Senate, and then headed the Missouri Democratic Party&#x27;s nominating convention for major elected offices. Price and his associated bloc were able to influence control over the convention, which eventually supported hard money principles, with the Boonslick faction compromising on the issue of election via districting instead of a general slate by supporting the successful nomination of John Cummins Edwards for governor. However, soft money Democrats would later run their own candidates as independent Democrats, outside of those chosen by the convention. In the end, Benton was reelected and Price was elected to a seat in the United States House of Representatives, with Jackson succeeding him as Speaker.

===United States House of Representatives===

Price arrived in Washington, D.C., where the United States House met, in November 1845, and the 29th United States Congress convened on December 1, with Price in attendance. One of Price&#x27;s first votes was in favor of an unsuccessful attempt to revive the previously-revoked gag resolution. He also voted to table a bill that would have banned slavery in the District of Columbia, and was part of the majority that voted to admit Texas into the United States. In early 1846, Price voted against a major internal improvements bill, the Rivers and Harbors Bill, despite agreement with some portions of it, as he felt that it unduly benefited special interests. Price&#x27;s initial position on the Oregon boundary dispute was that the boundary of the United States in the Oregon Country should extend to 54 degrees and 40 minutes north (&quot;54-40 or Fight!&quot;), a position that was popular in Missouri. However, Benton convinced him to support having the boundary at the 49th parallel north, which hurt Price&#x27;s standing in Missouri.

After the United States&#x27; admission of Texas, tensions between the United States and Mexico grew and evolved into small military clashes. On May 11, 1846, President James Knox Polk submitted a message Congress suggesting war with Mexico; Price was part of the majority that voted for it. At the same time back in Missouri, a nominating convention selected James S. Green as the Democratic candidate, rather than renominating Price. Price&#x27;s opposition to the Rivers and Harbors Bill and his stance on the Oregon boundary had hurt his chances of renomination. Upset at not being renominated, Price resigned his seat in August; he was appointed colonel in one of the Missouri regiments being formed for the war with Mexico, having been suggested for the position by Benton. Price had only introduced two bills during his time in Congress: one related to determining the feasibility of establishing a mail route, and the other calling for Missouri soldiers to be compensated for horses they had lost while serving during the Seminole Wars.

==Mexican–American War==

Price&#x27;s command, the 2nd Missouri Mounted Infantry Regiment, was assigned to serve under the command of Brigadier General Stephen Watts Kearny. Kearny wanted the unit to be raised as infantry, but Price decided on his own to form it as a cavalry unit, a move Shalhope describes as displaying &quot;a certain vanity&quot;. The 2nd Missouri left Fort Leavenworth for Santa Fe in the summer of 1846 and arrived on September 28. Price, who had been ill with cholera during the movement, commanded United States forces in Santa Fe, where, according to Castel, he displayed a quarrelsome attitude, a tendency to make decisions so independently that they bordered on insubordination, and a laxness in keeping his troops disciplined. He became quite ill in November and December due to a recurrence of the cholera. Price suffered intestinal problems for the rest of his life, and Shalhope attributes this to the bout with cholera. Kearny&#x27;s plan had been for Price&#x27;s arrival in Santa Fe to allow the 1st Missouri Regiment, under the command of Doniphan, to move to Chihuahua, but Doniphan instead was sent on a reprisal mission after the town of Pulvidera was raided by Apaches.
In January 1847, the Taos Revolt occurred, and Charles Bent, the United States Governor of New Mexico, was killed. Price mobilized troops against the revolt, but as he had to keep a garrison in Santa Fe, was initially only able to move towards Taos with 353 men and four mountain howitzers, leaving on January 23. On January 24, Price&#x27;s men defeated a superior enemy force at the Battle of Cañada, and then received reinforcements which brought his strength to 479 men. After winning the Battle of Embudo Pass, Price&#x27;s column reached Taos on February 2. The revolters had taken up positions in several buildings at the Taos Pueblo complex, and Price ordered an artillery bombardment of February 3, which was followed by a successful attack the next day. Two leaders of the Taos Revolt were captured: one was executed later in the year, and the other was murdered in prison. According to Shalhope, Price &quot;displayed considerable skill&quot; over the source of the Taos campaign.

Once the Missourians returned to garrison duty, morale and discipline began to fall apart, leading to criticism of Price in the Missouri press. In July, Price received a promotion to brigadier general and became the military governor of Chihuahua, with Benton likely playing a role in the promotion. The enlistment periods for most of his men elapsed in August and September, and they returned home, along with Price. He visited his family and made trips to Jefferson City and St. Louis before returning to Fort Leavenworth in order to return to Santa Fe. After leaving the fort on November 10, Price arrived at Santa Fe in January 1848, where the garrison troops had been better-behaved in his absence. Price quickly sent out new orders to try to prevent discipline from cratering again, although these were not entirely successful.

While in Missouri, Price had been in communication with Adjutant General Roger Jones about leading an expedition into Chihuahua and Durango. After consulting with United States Secretary of War William L. Marcy, Jones replied that such a movement would be more effectively started from elsewhere, although Price was given permission to conduct demonstrations if a Mexican force occupied Chihuahua and threatened New Mexico. After hearing that Mexican General José de Urrea with a large force was threatening American control of the city of El Paso, Price traveled to El Paso on February 23, but learned that the reports were false. Despite his orders to not attack Chihuahua and the lack of a threat to Santa Fe, Price decided to invade Chihuhua anyway. Benton promised to politically shield him from any backlash from the movement. When his supply train ran late, Price decided to begin the advance anyway, and was met by a delegation from the Mexican governor informing Price that the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo had been signed and that hostilities were over. Price did not believe the information, and continued on, pursuing a Mexican force that had abandoned Chihuahua City. Many of Price&#x27;s men&#x27;s horses began to wear out, and Price was only able to take 250 men to Santa Cruz de Rosales, where the Mexicans had retreated to. After being idle from March 9 to 16 while small parties of reinforcements arrived,

Price attacked on March 16. His men were victorious in close-quarters combat that saw the Mexicans suffer heavy losses. The war had effectively ended well over a month before the battle, but Price received praise in the press and from President Polk despite having ignored the orders to not make the campaign. Price left Chihuahua in July, and was back in Missouri in October, where he had gained sizable political capital. Shalhope writes that Price&#x27;s success in Mexico led to a willingness to disobey orders, experience with handling volunteer soldiers, and a tendency to ignore logistical matters, all three traits that would extend into a later conflict.

==Governor of Missouri==
Price became a slave owner and planter, cultivating tobacco on the Bowling Green prairie. Popular because of his war service, he was easily elected Governor of Missouri in 1852, serving from 1853 to 1857. During his tenure, Washington University in St. Louis was established, the state&#x27;s public school system was restructured, the Missouri State Teachers Association was created, the state&#x27;s railroad network was expanded, and a state geological survey was created. Although the state legislature passed an act to increase the governor&#x27;s salary, Price refused to accept anything more than the salary for which he had been elected.

Price was appointed as the state&#x27;s Bank Commissioner, serving from 1857 to 1861. He also secured a rail line through his home county, which became part of the Norfolk and Western Railway.

==American Civil War==
===Struggle for Missouri===
Price was initially a public supporter of the Union. He backed Stephen A. Douglas for president in 1860. When the states of the Deep South seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, Price opposed secession by Missouri. He was elected presiding officer of the Missouri Constitutional Convention of 1861–1863 on February 28, 1861, which voted against the state leaving the Union. In private, however, Price conspired with pro-Confederate Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson to arm the state&#x27;s militia with Confederate weapons so they could seize the St. Louis Arsenal and thereby gain control of the city and the state. The plot was foiled in May 1861, when Federal forces under Capt. Nathaniel Lyon seized the militia&#x27;s Camp Jackson near St. Louis where Confederate weapons had been delivered. No longer able to hide his private support, and using the Federal action as justification, Price gave his public support to the secessionists and joined in requests for the Confederacy to occupy the state.

Jackson appointed Price to command the new Missouri State Guard in May 1861, and Price led his recruits (who nicknamed him &quot;Old Pap&quot;) in a campaign to expel Lyon&#x27;s troops. By then, Lyon&#x27;s troops had seized the state capital and reconvened the pro-Union Missouri Constitutional Convention. The Convention voted to remove Jackson from office and replace him with Hamilton Rowan Gamble, a pro-Union former chief justice of the Missouri Supreme Court. The climax of the conflict was the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek on August 10, when Price&#x27;s Missouri State Guard, supported by Confederate troops led by Brigadier General Benjamin McCulloch, soundly defeated Lyon&#x27;s troops. (Lyon himself died in battle, the first Union general to do so.) Price&#x27;s troops launched an offensive into northern Missouri, defeating the Federal forces of Colonel James Mulligan at the First Battle of Lexington. However, the Union Army soon sent reinforcements to Missouri, and forced Price&#x27;s men and Jackson to fall back to the Arkansas border. The Union retained control of most of Missouri for the remainder of the war, although there were frequent guerrilla raids in the western sections.

Still operating as a Missouri militia general (rather than as a commissioned Confederate officer), Price was unable to agree on next steps with McCulloch. This split what might otherwise have become a sizable Confederate force in the West. Price and McCulloch became such bitter rivals that the Confederacy appointed Major-General Earl Van Dorn as overall commander of the Trans-Mississippi district. Van Dorn reunited Price&#x27;s and McCulloch&#x27;s formations into a force he named the Army of the West, and set out to engage Unionist troops in Missouri under the command of Brigadier-General Samuel R. Curtis. Now under Van Dorn&#x27;s command, Price was commissioned in the Confederate States Army as a Major-General on March 6, 1862.

Outnumbering Curtis&#x27;s forces, Van Dorn attacked the Northern army at Pea Ridge on March 7–8. Although wounded in the fray, Price pushed Curtis&#x27;s force back at Elkhorn Tavern on March 7, but the battle was lost on the following day after a furious Federal counterattack.

===Western Theater===
Price, now serving under Van Dorn, crossed the Mississippi River to reinforce Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard&#x27;s army in northern Mississippi following Beauregard&#x27;s loss at the Battle of Shiloh. Van Dorn&#x27;s army was positioned on the Confederate right flank during the Siege of Corinth. During Braxton Bragg&#x27;s Confederate Heartland Offensive, Van Dorn was sent to western Mississippi, while Price given command of the District of Tennessee. As Bragg marched his army into Kentucky, Bragg urged Price to make some move to assist him. Not waiting to re-unite with Van Dorn&#x27;s returning forces, Price seized the Union supply depot at nearby Iuka, but was driven back by Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans at the Battle of Iuka on September 19, 1862. A few weeks later, on October 3–4, Price (under Van Dorn&#x27;s command once more) was defeated at the Second Battle of Corinth.

Van Dorn was replaced by Maj. Gen. John C. Pemberton, and Price, who had become thoroughly disgusted with Van Dorn and was eager to return to Missouri, obtained a leave to visit Richmond, the Confederate capital. There, he obtained an audience with Confederate President Jefferson Davis to discuss his grievances, only to find his own loyalty to the South sternly questioned by the Confederate leader. Price did secure Davis&#x27;s permission to return to Missouri—minus his troops. Unimpressed with the Missourian, Davis pronounced him &quot;the vainest man I ever met.&quot;

===Trans-Mississippi Theater===
Price was not finished as a Confederate commander, however. He contested Union control over Arkansas in the summer of 1863, and while he won some of his engagements, he was not able to dislodge Northern forces from the state, abandoning Little Rock for southern Arkansas.

====Missouri Expedition====
Despite his disappointments in Arkansas and Louisiana, Price convinced his superiors to permit him to invade Missouri in the fall of 1864, hoping yet to seize that state for the Confederacy or at the very least imperil Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s chances for reelection that year. Confederate General Kirby Smith agreed, though he was forced to detach the infantry brigades originally detailed to Price&#x27;s force and send them elsewhere, thus changing Price&#x27;s proposed campaign from a full-scale invasion of Missouri to a large cavalry raid. Price amassed 12,000 horsemen for his army, and fourteen pieces of artillery.

The first major engagement in Price&#x27;s Raid occurred at Pilot Knob, where he successfully captured the Union-held Fort Davidson but needlessly subjected his men to high fatalities in the process, for a gain that turned out to be of no real value. From Pilot Knob, Price swung west, away from St. Louis (his primary objective) and toward Kansas City, Missouri, and nearby Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Forced to bypass his secondary target at heavily fortified Jefferson City, Price cut a swath of destruction across his home state, even as his army steadily dwindled due to battlefield losses, disease, and desertion.

Although he defeated inferior Federal forces at Boonville, Glasgow, Lexington, the Little Blue River and Independence, Price was ultimately boxed in by two Northern armies at Westport, located in today&#x27;s Kansas City, where he had to fight against overwhelming odds. This unequal contest, known afterward as &quot;The Gettysburg of the West&quot;, did not go his way, and he was forced to retreat into hostile Kansas. A new series of defeats followed, as Price&#x27;s battered and broken army was pushed steadily southward toward Arkansas, and then further south into Texas. Price&#x27;s Raid was his last significant military operation, and the last significant Confederate campaign west of the Mississippi.

===Notable battles===
Some of Price&#x27;s notable battles during the American Civil War are listed here in order of occurrence, and indicating whether he was in overall command and whether the battle or engagement was won or lost:
==Emigration to Mexico==

Rather than surrender, Price emigrated to Mexico, where he and several of his former compatriots attempted to start a colony of Southerners. He settled in a Confederate exile colony in Carlota, Veracruz. There Price unsuccessfully sought service with the Emperor Maximilian. When the colony failed, he returned to Missouri.

==Death==

While in Mexico, Price started having severe intestinal problems, which grew worse in August 1866 when he contracted typhoid fever. Impoverished and in poor health, Price died of cholera (or &quot;cholera-like symptoms&quot;) in St. Louis, Missouri. The death certificate listed the cause of death as &quot;chronic diarrhea&quot;. Price&#x27;s funeral was held on October 3, 1867, in St. Louis, at the First Methodist Episcopal Church (on the corner of Eighth and Washington). His body was carried by a black hearse drawn by six matching black horses, and his funeral procession was the largest to take place in St. Louis up to that point. He was buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery.

==Honors==

* During the American Civil War, a wooden river steamer built at Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1856 as the &quot;Laurent Millaudon&quot; was taken into Confederate service and renamed the CSS &quot;General Sterling Price&quot;. Participating in actions near Fort Pillow, Tennessee, on May 10, 1862, she damaged two Federal gunboats before being temporarily put out of action. The &quot;General Price&quot; was sunk during the First Battle of Memphis, raised, repaired, and served in the Union Navy under the name USS &quot;General Price&quot; although she was still referred to as the &quot;General Sterling Price&quot; in Federal dispatches. As a Union ship, she served in the Vicksburg and Red River campaigns. The &quot;General Price&quot; was sold for private use after the war.
* Camp No. 31 (organized October 13, 1889) of the United Confederate Veterans (UCV) in the city of Dallas, Texas, was named after him.
* A monument to Price stands in the Springfield National Cemetery (Springfield, Missouri). Dedicated August 10, 1901, the bronze figure honors all Missouri soldiers and General Price. It was commissioned by the United Confederate Veterans of Missouri.
* A statue of Price stands in Price Park, Keytesville, Missouri, which is also the location of the Sterling Price Museum in his honor.
* The United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) commissioned Jorgen Dreyer in 1939 to create a bust of Price. It is in the Visitor Center of the Battle of Lexington Missouri Historic Site.
* Camps No. 145 (St. Louis) and Camp No. 676 (Littleton, Colorado) of the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) are named after him.

<doc id="728744" wikidata="Q745850" url="?curid=728744" title="Sticky Fingers">
<text>Sticky Fingers is the ninth studio album by the English rock band the Rolling Stones. It was released on 23 April 1971 on the Rolling Stones&#x27; new label, Rolling Stones Records. 

The Rolling Stones had been contracted by Decca Records and London Records in the UK and the US since 1963. On this album, Mick Taylor made his second full-length appearance on a Rolling Stones album (after the live album &quot;Get Yer Ya-Ya&#x27;s Out!&quot;). It was the first studio album without Brian Jones, who had died two years earlier. The original Grammy-nominated cover artwork, conceived and photographed by Andy Warhol, showed a picture of a man in tight jeans, and had a working zip that opened to reveal underwear fabric. The cover was expensive to produce and damaged the vinyl record, so the size of the zipper adjustment was made by John Kosh at ABKCO Records. Later re-issues featured just the outer photograph of the jeans.

The album featured a return to basics for the Rolling Stones. The unusual instrumentation introduced several albums prior was absent, with most songs featuring drums, guitar, bass, and percussion as provided by the key members: Mick Jagger (lead vocals, various percussion and rhythm guitar), Keith Richards (guitar and backing vocals), Mick Taylor (guitar), Bill Wyman (bass guitar), and Charlie Watts (drums). Additional contributions were made by long-time Stones collaborators including saxophonist Bobby Keys and keyboardists Billy Preston, Jack Nitzsche, Ian Stewart, and Nicky Hopkins. As with the other albums of the Rolling Stones late 1960s/early 1970s period, it was produced by Jimmy Miller.

&quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; is widely regarded as one of the Rolling Stones&#x27; best albums. It was the band&#x27;s first album to reach number one on both the UK albums and US albums charts, and has since achieved triple platinum certification in the US. &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1971. &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; was voted the second best album of the year in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll for 1971, based on American critics&#x27; votes. The album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list.

==Background==
With the end of their Decca/London association at hand, the Rolling Stones were finally free to release their albums (including cover art) as they pleased. However, their departing manager Allen Klein dealt the group a major blow when they discovered that they had inadvertently signed over their entire 1960s American copyrights to Klein and his company ABKCO, which is how all of their material from 1963&#x27;s &quot;Come On&quot; to &quot;Get Yer Ya-Ya&#x27;s Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert&quot; has since been released solely in America by ABKCO Records. The band later sued for their return but without success, settling in 1984. The band would remain incensed with Klein for decades for that act. Klein died in 2009.

When Decca informed the Rolling Stones that they were owed one more single, the band submitted a track called &quot;Cocksucker Blues&quot;, correctly assuming that this would be refused. Instead, Decca released the two-year-old &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; track &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; while Klein retained dual copyright ownership in conjunction with the Rolling Stones of &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;Wild Horses&quot;.

===Recording===
Although sessions for &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; began in earnest in March 1970, the Rolling Stones had been recording at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Alabama in December 1969, where they cut &quot;You Gotta Move&quot;, &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;Wild Horses&quot;. &quot;Sister Morphine&quot;, cut during &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;&#x27;s sessions earlier in March of that year, had been held over from that release. Much of the recording for &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; was made with the Rolling Stones&#x27; mobile studio in Stargroves during the summer and autumn of 1970. Early versions of songs that would eventually appear on &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; were also rehearsed during these sessions.

== Music and lyrics ==
&quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; originally included 10 tracks. The music has been characterised by commentators as hard rock, roots rock and rock and roll. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, it is &quot;the Stones&#x27; most downbeat, druggy album, with new guitarist Mick Taylor stretching into jazz and country&quot;.

==Artwork==
===Standard version===

The artwork emphasized the innuendo of the &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; title, showing a close-up of a jeans-clad male crotch with the visible outline of a penis. The cover of the original vinyl LP featured a working zipper and perforations around the belt buckle that opened to reveal a sub-cover image of white briefs. The vinyl release displayed the band&#x27;s name and album title along the belt; behind the zipper, the underpants were seemingly rubber stamped in gold with the stylized name of American pop artist Andy Warhol, below which read &quot;THIS PHOTOGRAPH MAY NOT BE—ETC.&quot; The artwork was conceived and photographed by Warhol and the design by Craig Braun. Billy Name is sometimes accredited as the photographer, however Braun believes Warhol shot the Polaroid photos for the album, and the Factory associates who were involved in the photo shoot have claimed that Warhol took the photos. Braun and his team suggested wrapping the album in rolling paper – a concept later used by Cheech &amp; Chong in &quot;Big Bambu&quot; – but Jagger was enthused by Warhol&#x27;s concept. Warhol duly sent Braun Polaroid pictures of a model in tight jeans.

The cover photo of the crotch was assumed by fans to be Mick Jagger, but people involved in the photoshoot claim Warhol photographed several men, and Jagger was not one of them. It is unclear exactly who appears on the cover because Warhol never revealed which photos he used. Former &quot;Interview&quot; magazine editor Bob Colacello said, &quot;When the album came out, Glenn [O&#x27;Brein] was certain that it was he on the inside and Jay Johnson on the outside, but Andy would never say exactly whose crotch he had immortalized.&quot; O&#x27;Brien, who was an editor for Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Interview&quot; magazine, is &quot;100 percent certain&quot; he is the underwear model: &quot;I knew it was me because it was my underwear!&quot; For the cover model, it was speculated to be Warhol&#x27;s lover Jed Johnson in the blue jeans. It was also rumored to be Warhol superstar Joe Dallesandro, who claimed it was him on the cover. Corey Tippin, who did the makeup for Warhol&#x27;s film &quot;L&#x27;Amour&quot;, is convinced that the jeans model on the cover is him: &quot;I know my anatomy.&quot; Those closest to the photoshoot and subsequent design name Tippin as the likeliest candidate. 

Reportedly, when retailers complained that the zipper damaged the vinyl (from stacked shipments), the zipper was &quot;unzipped&quot; slightly to the middle of the record, where damage would be minimized. 

For the initial vinyl release the album title and band name is smaller and at the top on the American release. For the UK release, the title and band name are in bigger letters and on the left.

&quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; earned a Grammy nomination for Best Album Cover at the 14th Annual Grammy Awards in 1972.

The album introduced the tongue and lips logo of Rolling Stones Records, designed by John Pasche in 1970. Jagger suggested to Pasche that he copy the out-stuck tongue of the Hindu goddess Kali. Pasche felt that would date the image to the Indian culture craze of the 1960s, but seeing Kali changed his mind. Before the end of that year, his basic version was faxed to Craig Braun by Marshall Chess. The black and white copy was modified by Braun and his team, resulting in the popular red version: the slim one with the two white stripes on the tongue.

Critic Sean Egan wrote: &quot;Without using the Stones&#x27; name, it instantly conjures them, or at least Jagger, as well as a certain lasciviousness that is the Stones&#x27; own… It quickly and deservedly became the most famous logo in the history of popular music.&quot; The tongue and lips design was part of a package that, in 2003, VH1 named the &quot;No. 1 Greatest Album Cover&quot; of all time.

===Alternative version and covers===
In Spain, the original cover was censored by the Franco regime and replaced with a &quot;Can of fingers&quot; cover, designed by John Pasche and Phil Jude, and &quot;Sister Morphine&quot; was replaced by a live version of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Let It Rock&quot;. This track was later included on the CD compilation &quot;Rarities 1971–2003&quot; in 2005.

In 1992, the LP release of the album in Russia featured a similar treatment as the original cover; but with Cyrillic lettering for the band name and album name, a colourised photograph of blue jeans with a zipper, and a Soviet Army uniform belt buckle that shows a hammer and sickle inscribed in a star. The model appears to be female.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; was released on 23 April 1971 and reached number one on the UK Albums Chart in May 1971, remaining there for four weeks before returning at number one for a further week in mid June. In the US, the album hit number one within days of release, and stayed there for four weeks. The album spent a total of 69 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top 200 list, it was one of the albums that topped the German chart that year.

In a contemporary review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, music critic Robert Hilburn said that although &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; is one of the best rock albums of the year, it is only &quot;modest&quot; by the Rolling Stones&#x27; standards and succeeds on the strength of songs such as &quot;Bitch&quot; and &quot;Dead Flowers&quot;, which recall the band&#x27;s previously uninhibited, furious style. Jon Landau, writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, felt that it lacks the spirit and spontaneity of the Rolling Stones&#x27; previous two albums and, apart from &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot;, is full of &quot;forced attempts at style and control&quot; in which the band sounds disinterested, particularly on formally correct songs such as &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;. Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2015, David Fricke called it &quot;an eclectic affirmation of maturing depth&quot; and the band&#x27;s &quot;sayonara to a messy 1969&quot;. In a positive review, Lynn Van Matre of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; viewed the album as the band &quot;at their raunchy best&quot; and wrote that, although it is &quot;hardly innovative,&quot; it is consistent enough to be one of the year&#x27;s best albums. Writing for &quot;Slate&quot;, Jack Hamilton praised the album in a retrospective review, stating that it was &quot;one of the greatest albums in rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll history.&quot;

&quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; was voted the second best album of the year in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll for 1971. Lester Bangs voted it number one in the poll and said that it was his most played album of the year. Robert Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator, ranked the album 17th on his own year-end list. In a 1975 article for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Christgau suggested that the release was &quot;triffling with decadence&quot;, but might be the Rolling Stones&#x27; best album, approached only by &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; (1972). In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), he wrote that it reflected how unapologetic the band was after the Altamont Free Concert and that, despite the concession to sincerity with &quot;Wild Horses&quot;, songs such as &quot;Can&#x27;t You Hear Me Knocking&quot; and &quot;I Got the Blues&quot; are as &quot;soulful&quot; as &quot;Good Times&quot;, and their cover of &quot;You Gotta Move&quot; is on-par with their previous covers of &quot;Prodigal Son&quot; and &quot;Love in Vain&quot;.

=== Re-releases ===
In 1994, &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records. This remaster was initially released in a Collector&#x27;s Edition CD, which replicated in miniature many elements of the original vinyl album packaging, including the zipper. &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; was remastered again in 2009 by Universal Music Enterprises and in 2011 by Universal Music Enterprises in a Japanese-only SHM-SACD version; the latter was also used in 2013 for SHM-CD and Platinum SHM-CD, and then again in 2020 for another Japanese-only (standard) SHM-CD version.

In June 2015, the Rolling Stones reissued &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; in its 2009 remastering in a variety of formats to coincide with a concert tour, the Zip Code Tour. The Deluxe and Super Deluxe versions of the reissue featured previously unreleased bonus material (depending on the format): alternative takes of some songs, live tracks recorded on 14 March 1971 at the Roundhouse in London and the complete 13 March 1971 show at Leeds University. It re-entered the UK Albums chart at number 7, extending their UK Top 10 album chart span beyond 51 years and 2 months since their self-titled debuted at number 7 on 23 April 1964. It also re-entered the US Albums chart at number 5, extending their US Top 10 album chart span beyond 50 years and 6 months since &quot;12 x 5&quot; on 14 December 1964.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; was ranked number ten in the 1994 first edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. He stated, &quot;Dirty rock like this has still to be bettered, and there is still no rival in sight.&quot; In a retrospective review, &quot;Q&quot; magazine said that the album was &quot;the Stones at their assured, showboating peak ... A magic formula of heavy soul, junkie blues and macho rock.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; wrote that it &quot;captures the Stones bluesy swagger&quot; in a &quot;dark-land where few dare to tread.&quot; &quot;Record Collector&quot; magazine said that it showcases Jagger and Richards as they &quot;delve even further back to the primitive blues that first inspired them and step up their investigations into another great American form, country.&quot; In his review for &quot;Goldmine&quot; magazine, Dave Thompson wrote that the album still is superior to &quot;most of The Rolling Stones&#x27; catalog.&quot; In a 2018 retrospective review, &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Alexis Petridis ranked it the best album the band had ever produced, stating &quot;their claim to be The Greatest Rock’n’Roll Band in the World has no more compelling evidence than the flawless 46 minutes of music here.&quot;

David Hepworth wrote in his 2016 book &quot;Never a Dull Moment&quot; that the contributions of guest performers such as Keys, Jim Dickinson, and Preston gave the album &quot;more musical range than any other Rolling Stones album,&quot; including &quot;Dickinson&#x27;s honky-tonk piano on &#x27;Wild Horses&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Preston&#x27;s churchy organ solo on &#x27;I Got the Blues. Hepworth also suggested that Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Latin-flavored guitar solo&quot; on &quot;Can&#x27;t You Hear Me Knocking&quot; was influenced by Santana&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;Abraxas&quot;.

&quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. It was listed as No. 63 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2003 list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, No. 64 in a 2012 revised list, and No. 104 in a 2020 reboot of the list.

<text>KEXP-FM (90.3 FM) is a non-commercial radio station in Seattle, Washington, United States, specializing in indie music programmed by its disc jockeys. KEXP&#x27;s studios are located at the Seattle Center, and the transmitter is in the city&#x27;s Capitol Hill neighborhood. The station is operated by the non-profit entity Friends of KEXP, an affiliate of the University of Washington. Since March 19, 2024, KEXP-FM&#x27;s programming has been rebroadcast over Alameda, California–licensed KEXC, which serves the San Francisco Bay Area.

As well as daily variety mix shows featuring mostly alternative rock music, KEXP hosts weekly programs dedicated to other musical genres, such as hip hop, Afrobeat, punk, ambient, alternative country, Latin music, and world music. The station also regularly hosts live, in-studio performances by artists. Alongside its analog transmitters serving Seattle and San Francisco, the station offers an online live stream, a real-time playlist with DJ notes, and an actively maintained YouTube channel.

Founded in 1972 as KCMU, the student-run station of the University of Washington, KEXP gained recognition for its influence on the regional music scene. It was the first station to air grunge bands like Nirvana and Soundgarden in the late 1980s. After partnering with the Experience Music Project, now the Museum of Pop Culture, in 2001, the station began to acquire an international listener base thanks to an early investment in internet streaming and its website. In 2014, the university transferred the FCC license of KEXP-FM to Friends of KEXP in exchange for on-air underwriting spots, granting the station independence in management and programming decisions.

==History==
===Early years as KCMU (1971–1985)===
The University of Washington (UW)&#x27;s involvement in radio broadcasting dates to the 1952 launch of KUOW-FM, which moved to 94.9 MHz in 1958. The station served as an environment for training communications students and provided classical music, fine arts, and sports programming. In the early 1970s, university budget cuts led to an increased professionalization of that station and decreased student involvement. The need for more student involvement had become apparent after a 1970 student strike at the UW, during which time airtime on KUOW was &quot;taken over&quot; and temporarily given to a student group known as the Student Communication Coalition and branding itself &quot;Radio Free Seattle&quot;. As a result, four UW undergraduates—John Kean, Cliff Noonan, Victoria (&quot;Tory&quot;) Fiedler, and Brent Wilcox—began planning to create a second UW station to be run by students. Noonan felt that there was insufficient student media in a time marked by student activism and protests; there was only a campus newspaper, &quot;The Daily&quot;, and Noonan had come from San Francisco, where he was aware of other college stations. The four students formulated a proposal and were able to secure the backing of the UW Board of Regents, which promised funding if the students could get a station approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). On July 13, 1971, UW filed an application for a new 10-watt non-commercial educational station on 90.5 MHz, which would be located in the Communications Building (abbreviated &quot;CMU&quot; on campus maps).

On October 5, the FCC granted the permit, and the UW Board of Regents approved the concept for the station (originally dubbed KPMG, for &quot;Professional Media Group&quot;) the next month. It then fell to the students to put together the equipment and resources necessary to get KCMU going, including old turntables from a northwest Washington radio station and an old transmitter being discarded by KNHC at Nathan Hale High School as it was upgrading its own facilities; the students also received a $2,500 grant from the Board of Regents. Construction tasks included retrofitting a third-floor room in the building, erecting a transmitter tower atop McMahon Hall, and manually upgrading a telephone line to send audio from the Communications Building to the facility. KCMU began broadcasting on May 10, 1972. The station split its airtime between information and &quot;folk-rock and blues&quot; music. That year, it sent reporters to both national political conventions. The station also produced alternative student-led coverage of UW athletic events, including women&#x27;s basketball, which was not being aired at the time by the commercial rightsholder for university sports, KIRO. The limited-power station served few listeners; a 2007 column recounting the station&#x27;s early history noted that it &quot;barely reached the Ave&quot;, the commercial heart of Seattle&#x27;s University District, and UW administrators ordered a programming overhaul in 1975 to increase the audience. During the 1970s, the station produced several people who went on to managerial and on-air positions in Seattle broadcasting, among them Steve Pool.

In 1980, the university filed to increase KCMU&#x27;s power from 10 watts to 182 in the wake of changes to FCC regulations encouraging many 10-watt stations to increase power. The $5,000 upgrade, carried out in June 1982, also marked the beginning of stereo broadcasts. During this time, the station began programming new wave music on weekdays from 3 p.m. to midnight; the station adopted new wave as its full-time musical format in July 1981 after KZAM (1540 AM), a commercial outlet broadcasting the same music, dropped it due to low ratings.

The shift in music and impending technical overhaul came as further university budget cuts meant the end of financial support from the UW&#x27;s School of Communications; a one-time grant from the university student activities and fees committee kept the station on the air during the 1981–1982 school year and gave its backers time to hold fundraising events, the first in its history. This marked a permanent shift to being listener-supported, though KUOW provided engineering and accounting services. As part of its operating agreement, the station aired five-minute hourly newscasts prepared by the university&#x27;s journalism students. In 1982, KCMU once again gained commercial competition in the form of KJET (1590 AM), which adopted the new wave format.

===Championing the &quot;Seattle sound&quot; (1985–1992)===
KCMU was at the center of a new music scene in the mid-1980s that would eventually emerge as grunge. In the words of early 1980s music director Faith Henschel, the station had long been &quot;very sympathetic to local bands&quot; and already had a requirement that a local band must be played at least once every hour. In late 1985, Chris Knab, who co-founded 415 Records and was a former owner of Aquarius Records in San Francisco, sold his interest in 415 Records and became KCMU&#x27;s station manager. The next year, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; featured KCMU and other college stations in an article hailing them as growing &quot;taste makers&quot;. Jonathan Poneman—who hosted a music show known as &quot;Audioasis&quot;—and Bruce Pavitt met at KCMU, leading to the foundation of record label Sub Pop. In a 2011 retrospective on grunge in &quot;Billboard&quot;, Poneman noted that his &quot;big break&quot; was being a DJ at KCMU. The role of KCMU—and format competitor KJET—in popularizing bands was further enhanced because of Seattle&#x27;s liquor regulation regime, which stunted the live events business. KEXP increased its power in 1987 when it moved frequencies from 90.5 to 90.3 MHz and relocated its transmitter to a tower site in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, using 400 watts.

Through the UW at this time were passing a series of future influential figures with ties to bands. Mark Arm lived in Terry Hall for a time, going on to front Green River and Mudhoney. Kim Thayil had moved to Seattle to follow Pavitt; he won a prize on KCMU, was invited to be a full-time DJ, and not only graduated from the UW with a degree in philosophy but got his band Soundgarden exposure on KCMU, the first station to play them. Music director Henschel created a two-cassette compilation of songs by local groups, titled &quot;Bands That Will Make You Money&quot;, and sent it to record labels; that led to Soundgarden getting signed to A&amp;M Records. Charles R. Cross, editor of music magazine &quot;The Rocket&quot;, noted, &quot;It&#x27;s no exaggeration to say that virtually every volunteer who had an air shift in the late &#x27;80s ended up getting a job in the music industry or playing some role in the Seattle scene.&quot; Soundgarden was not the only group that KCMU was breaking on the radio: in 1988, Kurt Cobain, looking for airplay for his band Nirvana, knocked on KCMU&#x27;s door and handed the station a copy of his first single, &quot;Love Buzz&quot;; they did not play it until Cobain called from a gas station pay phone to request it. That same year, KCMU again became the only alternative music station in the Seattle market when KJET dropped the format.

While KCMU was becoming renowned in the grunge scene, its musical offerings were more varied. Under Henschel, the format was broadened to take in blues and African music, among other genres. The Sunday night &quot;Rap Attack&quot; was the first radio program in Seattle to play such artists as Ice-T, Eazy-E, and N.W.A. By the late 1990s, the program had changed names to &quot;Street Sounds&quot;, with hosts including DJ Nasty-Nes and Marcus &quot;Kutfather&quot; Tufono; it remains on KEXP&#x27;s schedule .

By 1992, ten years after becoming listener-supported, KCMU&#x27;s budget had grown from $20,000 to $180,000. As well as the two technical improvements in the 1980s, it had added more paid staffers and listeners.

===Strife and change in the &#x27;90s (1992–2001)===
In November 1992, seeking to professionalize the station&#x27;s sound, KCMU management made the decision to dismiss nine volunteer disc jockeys to add two syndicated radio programs to the lineup: &quot;World Cafe&quot; from WXPN in Philadelphia and &quot;Monitoradio&quot;, produced by &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;. The decision caused an outcry and led KCMU supporters to organize as Censorship Undermines Radio Station Ethics, abbreviated CURSE. Protests centered around the changes and their near-unilateral implementation. Management further inflamed tensions after firing one volunteer reporter, Dick Burton, who discussed the controversy in a newscast; station manager Knab stated that Burton had violated a station policy barring on-air criticism of KCMU and then suspended the station&#x27;s volunteer news staff. In response, the news staff presented their resignations; one DJ, Riz Rollins, resigned; and CURSE encouraged listeners to withhold donations. It circulated flyers reading &quot;KCMU Is Dying&quot;, with Poneman arguing that Knab and other paid staff wanted to turn KCMU into a &quot;baby NPR, middle-of-the-road, vaguely alternative, soft-rock radio station&quot;. Several labels, including Sub Pop, Capitol Records, and C/Z Records, withheld record service to the station. The dispute reached the front page of &quot;Billboard&quot;, which called KCMU &quot;one of the most influential commercial-free stations in the country&quot;. Knab later defended his decisions as stemming from a desire by university leadership to grow the station.

The fight between KCMU management and CURSE, which led to KCMU discontinuing broadcasting between 1 and 6 a.m., made its way to the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington in January 1993. Three listeners and 11 staffers who claimed they were fired without warning argued in federal court that their First Amendment rights to free speech were being violated by KCMU, owned by the University of Washington, a state agency; they sued Knab and university director of broadcast services Wayne Roth. By the time of the lawsuit, 22 volunteers had left the station within two months.

In August 1994, federal judge Thomas Samuel Zilly ruled in favor of the KCMU staffers in &quot;Aldrich v. Knab&quot;, finding the no-criticism policy set out by Knab was unconstitutional, ordering six of the 11 staffers reinstated; none of the staffers reclaimed their positions. By this time, tensions had cooled; &quot;World Café&quot; was moved to weekends, and UW gave KCMU $20,000 to help it get financially back on track. These moves reduced the impact of CURSE&#x27;s decisions and helped bring back listeners and some record labels, resulting in a new KCMU that, per a profile in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, was sounding &quot;more like the old KCMU&quot;. In a 2020 journal article, Christopher Cwynar noted that the early 1990s CURSE episode and change in focus mirrored the rise of the adult album alternative format in public radio as well as the demands toward professionalization that similar stations—including WXPN and KCRW in Santa Monica, California—experienced.

In 1996, KCMU management opted to eliminate KCMU&#x27;s 6 p.m. news and information hour, which it argued overlapped with KUOW-FM. It also noted that KBCS (91.3 FM) aired some of the same Pacifica Radio output that was on KCMU. That year, the station also hired its first three full-time paid DJs, marking the first time since sporadic attempts between 1989 and 1992 that air staff were paid. The last volunteer DJs were fired in 1997. Two of the DJs that would come to define KEXP in the 2000s and 2010s were already in place in the last decade as KCMU. John Richards joined the station in the mid-1990s and got DJ shifts simply by showing up when others were not in the building. Cheryl Waters came aboard in 1994, hosting weekly live sessions recorded at the Jack Straw Cultural Center.

By the late 1990s, rumors of change and actual changes were swirling around KCMU. Reports suggested a possible combination of KUOW and KCMU with KPLU, a jazz station in Tacoma, was in the works, leaving open the possibility of a format change. The UW was preparing to move KCMU out of its namesake—the Communications Building—and into new studios to be shared with KUOW in the Ave. Arcade building at 45th Street and University Way as part of a plan to maximize classroom availability in campus buildings. In 1999, the university announced it would separate KCMU management from KUOW-FM and place it in the Office for Computing and Communications (C&amp;C), which operated the campus&#x27;s internet infrastructure, as a test bed for streaming and emerging technologies. Further, consistent rumblings were emerging of a potential partnership between the station and the Experience Music Project (EMP), then set to open the next year. The Experience Music Project—now known as the Museum of Pop Culture—was financed by Microsoft founder Paul Allen, with whom the UW was in discussions about other philanthropic donations, and Jon Kertzer, a former KCMU station manager, was involved with Allen&#x27;s investment company, Vulcan Inc., on the EMP. In 2016, music director Don Yates would call the move under C&amp;C &quot;the best thing that ever happened to the station&quot; because it resulted in major technological advancements.

In 2000, KCMU moved to Kane Hall on the UW campus. That year, it also started streaming high-quality, 128-kilobit-per-second MP3 compressed audio over the internet, becoming the first station in the world to offer online audio of this quality.

===Expansion as KEXP and Experience Music Project affiliation (2001–2011)===

On March 29, 2001, the UW unveiled a partnership with the EMP to transform KCMU in every way except its format. The license would still belong to the university, but the station would relocate to fully upgraded studios in the former home of KZOK at 113 Dexter Avenue North and change its call sign to KEXP-FM, increasing its power to 720 watts. The partnership combined the university, the radio station, the EMP, and the Allen Foundation for Music, which provided up to $600,000 over four years to UW. It also generated some concern over whether the station would lose its edge with the involvement of Allen, who owned two commercial stations in Portland, and whether the station needed listener support if it now had Allen&#x27;s backing. The EMP partnership also marked the end of any UW student involvement with the station; Associated Students of the University of Washington started a new online-only campus station, Rainy Dawg Radio, in 2003. Cwynar noted that the change in call sign represented the station&#x27;s shift &quot;from campus-based community broadcaster to community-funded music experience provider&quot;. The KCMU call sign later recurred on KCMU-LP, a low-power station in Napa, California, whose founder worked at KCMU in Seattle while a student at the UW.

Over the next several years, KEXP grew considerably and brought in much more money. In 2002, the EMP financed 52 percent of KEXP&#x27;s budget; it was self-reliant by 2006, when it brought in $3.3 million in revenue. In 2001, UW engineers invented CD players that could retrieve song metadata from the internet to build a real-time playlist. The next year, the station started offering a rolling archive of its last two weeks of programming, later adding an archive of past in-studio performances. The station&#x27;s streaming audience was growing and becoming more geographically diverse. From 2004 to 2005, weekly online listenership jumped from 26,000 to 50,000. A map in KEXP&#x27;s studios, filled with yellow pins for listeners around the world, sprouted pins in places as far from Seattle as Tokyo, London, Mongolia, and Antarctica.

Since 2001, KEXP has been affiliated with NPR, although the station only plays music and does not carry any NPR news programming. The station&#x27;s NPR affiliation coincided with the 2001 creation of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel (CARP), which would eventually issue a new rule mandating smaller internet broadcasters to pay $0.14 in royalty fees per listener per song. Due to its new NPR affiliation, KEXP was exempt from the higher fees imposed by the CARP ruling.

KEXP also added a terrestrial signal in Western Washington for a time. In 2004, KBTC, the radio station at Bates Technical College in Tacoma, was sold to Public Radio Capital for $5 million; the EMP then leased it under the call letters KXOT to expand KEXP&#x27;s signal. This agreement proved a strain on KEXP&#x27;s finances to the point where there was a possibility in late 2004 that the station would not make payroll; a 2005 article in &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot; revealed that several staffers had counseled Mara against entering into the pact. The Tacoma simulcast agreement was wound down in March 2006 because the EMP was ceasing to underwrite KEXP&#x27;s losses; that same year, KEXP increased its effective radiated power to its present 4,700 watts that year.

====Joint venture with WNYE New York====
New York City was one of the largest markets for KEXP streaming, and an opportunity arose for the station to expand there. In August 2007, WNYE (91.5 FM) &quot;Radio New York&quot;, part of the NYC Media division of the New York City government, approached KEXP to begin a joint venture. Management was planning to overhaul the station&#x27;s programming, and the deal also would help WNYE—long a station with a modest budget—gain an identity. KEXP output would be simulcast for 39 hours a week, including from 6 a.m. to noon each weekday, under the banner of &quot;Radio Liberation&quot;.

On March 24, 2008, KEXP DJ John Richards&#x27;s morning show, &quot;John in the Morning&quot;, was heard on both KEXP and WNYE for the first time. The other three programs produced for Radio Liberation—&quot;Wake Up&quot;, &quot;Music That Matters&quot;, and &quot;Mo&#x27;Glo&quot;—were custom for New York and did not air on KEXP. The plan was for KEXP to broadcast live from New York several times a year; Richards began splitting his time between live broadcasts in both New York and Seattle in June 2008.

The venture was never truly successful, largely because some of the intended audience was already streaming KEXP; the Great Recession, which began months after the alliance started, reduced marketing budgets and led to the layoffs of KEXP&#x27;s New York-oriented operations staffers. The relationship ended on June 1, 2011: WNYE replaced KEXP programming with a morning simulcast of Fordham University-owned 90.7 WFUV in New York, airing adult album alternative (AAA) music.

===Move to the Seattle Center (2011–2020)===

In 2011, the station announced that it would relocate its studios to the Seattle Center. The new facilities, to be located in the Northwest Rooms area of the center, would enable community members to watch performances and provide more room. The Seattle Center facility opened in December 2015 with a $15 million capital campaign, chaired by Mike McCready of Pearl Jam, nearly complete; a group of staffers paraded from the Dexter Avenue facility to the new studios. By the time of the move, KEXP was reaching 206,000 listeners a week, a quarter of them streaming the station.

Friends of KEXP, the non-profit created in 2001 to manage the station as part of the EMP partnership, purchased the station license from the UW in 2014 for $4 million in a transition suggested by university officials amidst the Seattle Center capital campaign. The $4 million was provided in $400,000 a year of on-air announcements and advertising over 10 years.

In 2018, KEXP announced that it had received a bequest of nearly $10 million from an anonymous out-of-state listener identified only as &quot;Suzanne&quot;, which would be used to establish a permanent endowment, fund an education and outreach team, and deepen the station&#x27;s work with musicians. The station attributed its ability to secure the bequest to efforts to grow relationships with donors started during the capital campaign. That year, the station also announced that it would be the &quot;official music partner&quot; of the Seattle Kraken, responsible for all in-game music and music entertainment surrounding the team.
=== Programming during and after COVID-19 (2020–present) ===
The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 posed substantial financial challenges for KEXP. This resulted in staff layoffs, budget cuts, and a heightened reliance on direct support from listeners to compensate for the loss of underwriting revenue from businesses. At the same time, KEXP had to adapt its programming to meet the increased demand from listeners who turned to online streaming. DJs continued to be on air, but had to broadcast remotely and would adjust their music selection in real-time in response to an influx of listener messages. As the performance space was closed and musicians cancelled tours, KEXP introduced &quot;Live on KEXP at Home&quot;, a format in which artists would prepare recorded performances that were played on air while discussing them live with a DJ virtually.

Under the backdrop of the George Floyd protests in Seattle in July 2020, KEXP revamped its lineup and its programming as part an initiative to increasing the diversity of the music and its staff. Several DJs were promoted to new executive positions, and two shows hosted by Black DJs were added to daytime slots that had been held solely by Richards, Cheryl Waters, and Kevin Cole. After a 2019 analysis by Tableau Software found that 24 of the top 25 artists played on the station in 2019 were predominantly White, the station broadened its mix of music.

Tom Mara, who was executive director of KCMU and KEXP for 31 years and who had volunteered for the station in the late 1980s as a UW student, announced his retirement as of June 30, 2022. Under Mara, the station had grown to $12.5 million in annual revenue by 2020; its average rating in Seattle had more than tripled from 1.1 to 3.7 between 2019 and 2022. The station opted to promote its chief operating officer, Ethan Raup, to CEO. Mara later announced that he would become the executive director of the Seattle International Film Festival instead of retiring altogether.

In 2022, KEXP celebrated its 50th anniversary of broadcasting dating to the start of KCMU. For the occasion, the station hosted a series of concerts named KEXP50, which featured two stages located in the courtyard and within the Gathering Space. Prior to the event, KEXP had been actively celebrating its anniversary with special programming highlighting the music history since its establishment in 1972, focusing on one year of music every week. In 2023, KEXP announced several changes to its schedule effective in September, including the removal of several existing shows and the addition of new programs focusing on Asian and indigenous music.

===Expansion to San Francisco===
In October 2023, Friends of KEXP bought KREV (92.7 FM), a radio station licensed to Alameda, California, and serving the San Francisco Bay Area, at a bankruptcy auction for $3.75 million. The acquisition was financed through the investment fund set up after anonymous donor Suzanne&#x27;s $10 million bequest in 2018. The station was slated to air most of KEXP&#x27;s programming as well as a Bay Area music program featuring local artists in the mold of KEXP&#x27;s &quot;Audioasis&quot;. KEXP management expects the deal to result in positive cash flow &quot;within the first few years&quot;. KREV was relaunched as KEXC on March 19, 2024, following a weekend-long period of stunting. On August 6, the show was announced as &quot;Vinelands&quot;, hosted by Kelley Stoltz and Gabriel Lopez from the studios of KQED-FM as part of a partnership between the two public media broadcasters to house KEXP&#x27;s San Francisco staff and studio broadcasts in KQED&#x27;s facility.

== Programming ==
On weekdays, KEXP airs five daytime shows in a variety mix format—&quot;Early&quot; (5-7a.m.), &quot;The Morning Show&quot; (7–10a.m.), &quot;The Midday Show&quot; (10a.m.–1p.m.), &quot;The Afternoon Show&quot; (1–4p.m.) and &quot;Drive Time&quot; (4–7p.m.). Since 2020, the station has also made major changes to its programming and DJ lineup, and it airs specialty shows throughout the week to diversify from its traditional focus on alternative and indie music. As of April 2024, KEXP&#x27;s specialty shows include the following:

* &quot;Astral Plane&quot;: Psychedelic music across multiple decades and genres.
* &quot;Audioasis&quot;: Pacific Northwest music. When this show airs in Seattle and online, KEXC listeners hear &quot;Vinelands&quot;, a local music program for the Bay Area.
* &quot;The Continent&quot;: African music, including Afrobeat.
* &quot;Eastern Echoes&quot;: Asian music and music from the Asian diaspora.
* &quot;El Sonido&quot;: Latin music, with a focus on the growing Latin alternative scene.
* &quot;Mechanical Breakdown&quot;: dark wave and post-punk.
* &quot;Positive Vibrations&quot;: ska, roots reggae, and &quot;all styles of Jamaican musical expression&quot;.
* &quot;The Roadhouse&quot;: roots, blues, and other traditional styles of American folk music.
* &quot;Street Sounds&quot;: KEXP&#x27;s weekly rap/hip-hop show.
* &quot;Wo&#x27; Pop&quot;: World music.

KEXP has also maintained a YouTube channel since 2007, when it started to experiment with bringing video cameras into its live room. The YouTube channel sees a wider global reach than its music broadcasting. The station is estimated to have 180,000 weekly listeners on the airwaves; its YouTube channel now has more than 3 million subscribers, and 75% of the channel&#x27;s views come from outside the United States. In addition to live performances recorded at the station, KEXP has started covering music festivals outside the U.S., hosting annual sessions at Iceland Airwaves and Rencontres Trans Musicales. Kevin Cole, KEXP&#x27;s DJ and chief content officer, attributes Of Monsters and Men&#x27;s early success to the station&#x27;s Iceland Airwaves coverage.

== Gathering Space ==
KEXP maintains a public communal space known as the Gathering Space, situated on the northwest corner of the Seattle Center at the intersection of Republican Street and 1st Avenue North. Inaugurated in December 2015, the Gathering Space was planned as part of KEXP&#x27;s relocation from its previous Dexter Avenue facility. The Seattle Center building is four times larger than the old studio and features amenities such as a public performance stage, a courtyard, an indoor viewing gallery, and dedicated shower and laundry facilities for musicians.

As well as the public performance stage, the Gathering Space also features a live room, along with a viewing gallery that holds up to 75 performance attendees. The live room serves as the backdrop for the station&#x27;s video podcasts. The lighting system, donated by Microsoft, features festoon lights that respond to the motion of performers through the use of three Microsoft Kinects connected to the control room. The background harkens back to that used in the videos on KEXP&#x27;s Dexter Avenue studios, a series of Christmas lights that Cwynar credits for providing a distinctive look to KEXP&#x27;s video output, analogous to the set for NPR&#x27;s Tiny Desk Concerts.

The Gathering Space has included a coffee shop since its inception. The first coffee shop was operated by La Marzocco, an Italian espresso machine manufacturer whose U.S. operations were based in Seattle, and featured an espresso machine showroom and a monthly rotation of roasters from around the world. In 2021, La Marzocco handed its cafe operations to Caffé Vita, and a new coffee shop called Vita at KEXP opened in place of the old cafe.

The current site of the Gathering Space is threatened by the construction of a new Seattle Center light rail station, which is being built as part of the Ballard Link Extension. If constructed, the train station would be adjacent to the north walls of the building housing KEXP and close to its studios. In 2022, KEXP and four other arts organizations wrote to Sound Transit, Seattle&#x27;s regional transit agency, expressing concern that the construction of the new station could displace them for as long as five years. Despite an alternative proposal by city officials suggesting the use of a site on Mercer Street, situated a block north, the Sound Transit board ultimately voted in favor of a Seattle Center station on Republican Street on March 23, 2023.

<text>Lirael (called Lirael: Daughter of the Clayr in some regions) is a fantasy novel by Garth Nix, first published in 2001. Named for its central female character, &quot;Lirael&quot; is the second in his Old Kingdom trilogy, preceded by &quot;Sabriel&quot; and continued in &quot;Abhorsen&quot;.

==Plot introduction==

The book is split into three parts, the first of which is set 14 years after the events in &quot;Sabriel&quot;; the last two parts are set four-to-five years after part one. Sabriel and Touchstone have married since &quot;Sabriel&quot; and assumed a measure of control over the Old Kingdom. Their children Ellimere and Sameth were going to school in Ancelstierre (similarly to Sabriel) before being expected to take up their duties in the Old Kingdom.

==Plot summary==
Lirael, the protagonist of the second and third books, is raised as a Clayr, part of a vast family of precognitive women who dwell in a remote glacier within the Old Kingdom. As she lacks the Clayr&#x27;s precognitive &#x27;Sight&#x27;, she considers herself not a true Clayr and prefers solitude to company. In young adulthood, she joins the staff of the Clayr&#x27;s Library, and acquires the Disreputable Dog; and with the latter&#x27;s help, vanquishes a series of monsters in the Library itself.

Five years later, in Ancelstierre, Prince Sameth encounters the necromancer Hedge and his undead minions, which injures Sameth both spiritually and physically. His father Touchstone therefore takes him back to the Old Kingdom and the safety of the palace in Belisaere. Here he is expected to succeed his mother Sabriel as the Abhorsen: a future whereof he is mortally afraid. Under Hedge&#x27;s influence, Sameth&#x27;s friend Nicholas Sayre (an Ancelstierran aristocrat) crosses the border into the Old Kingdom and travels to the Red Lake, where the royal rule does not extend and the Clayr cannot See. Sameth flees the palace to rescue Nick, and is later joined by Mogget. Lirael, on her nineteenth birthday, is identified as a &#x27;Remembrancer&#x27; (a clairvoyant able to accurately perceive the past), and sent (with the Dog) to the Red Lake to rescue Nick, who has by now become the host of a malign, alien intelligence. &quot;En route&quot;, Lirael joins Sam and Mogget, and they continue to the Red Lake, but are nearly vanquished by Chlorr of the Mask and her followers, and recover at the Abhorsen&#x27;s House. There, Lirael is identified as Sabriel&#x27;s half-sister and heir, and Sameth with the long-extinct &#x27;Wallmakers&#x27;.

==Characters in &quot;Lirael&quot;==
* Lirael - title character, raised as an orphan Clayr, half-sister of Sabriel.
* Disreputable Dog - a Free Magic creature also infused with Charter Magic, she was only supposed to be a puppy sending to comfort Lirael; however, while creating the sending, Lirael touched on some ancient magic in the dog statuette she found in the Clayr library and awoke the Dog
* Prince Sameth - the son of King Touchstone and the Abhorsen Sabriel; enjoys making toys and is one, if not the last, of the Wallmakers who made the Wall which divides the two Kingdoms; he has been into Death and was Abhorsen-in-Waiting before Lirael&#x27;s ascent into the title and role, but his encounter with Hedge has left him with an almost mortal fear of Death
* Mogget - an ancient Free Magic construct of unknown origin; appears in the form of a white cat and is bound by a red Charter magic collar to serve the Abhorsen
* Nicholas Sayre - a friend of Sameth from Ancelstierre, a sceptic who does not believe in magic and is always looking for a scientific reason for magical phenomena. 
* Ellimere - Sameth&#x27;s older sister, destined to be Queen
* Sabriel - the current Abhorsen, who destroyed Kerrigor many years before with the King, the former Abhorsen, and Mogget; is also wed to Touchstone and is Queen
* Touchstone - the King, a bastard son of a Queen and a nobleman who was trapped as a wooden figurehead of a funeral ship for 200 or so years before Sabriel saved him
* Hedge - an ancient necromancer serving a greater power; he attempts to capture Prince Sameth but obtains Nicholas Sayre instead
* Chlorr of the Mask - an ancient necromancer who Sabriel defeats early in Lirael, later raised by Hedge to become one of the Greater Dead 
* Sanar and Ryelle - Clayr twins who have the strongest Sight and aid both the Royal family and Lirael</text><links>

<doc id="728753" wikidata="Q2303491" url="?curid=728753" title="Tandem-charge">
<text>A tandem-charge or dual-charge weapon is an explosive device or projectile that has two or more stages of detonation, assisting it to penetrate either reactive armour on an armoured vehicle or strong structures.

==Anti-tank==
Tandem charges are effective against reactive armour, which is designed to protect an armoured vehicle (mostly tanks) against anti-tank munitions. The first stage of the weapon is typically a weak charge that either pierces the reactive armour of the target without detonating it, leaving a channel through the reactive armour so that the second warhead may pass unimpeded, or simply detonates the armour, causing the timing of the counter-explosion to fail. The second detonation from the same projectile (which defines it as a tandem charge) attacks the same location as the first detonation where the reactive armour has been compromised. Since the regular armour plating is often the only defence remaining, the main charge (second detonation) has an increased likelihood of penetrating the armour. An example of a tandem charge warhead is used by the 9M133M Kornet-M missile system

However, tandem charges are more useful against explosive reactive armour, less so against the non-explosive reactive armor, since their inner liner is not explosive itself and thus not expended by the small forward warhead of tandem-charge attack.

The PG-7VR warhead for the RPG-7 rocket launcher and the PG-29V warhead for the more modern RPG-29 rocket launcher are examples of tandem charges, but the technology is employed worldwide. Examples of missiles that use tandem charges include the BGM-71 TOW, FGM-148 Javelin and the Brimstone.

==Penetrating weapons==

Dual charges increase the effectiveness of warheads when used against structures (such as bunkers). Because the explosion of a unitary high explosive charge will follow the path of least resistance, much of the explosive power of a warhead will be lost to the air surrounding the target if detonated outside the structure. This effect can be countered by using heavily constructed gravity bombs with delay fuzes that penetrate the earth, concrete, etc. of the target before exploding—thus containing the explosion inside the structure and significantly increasing its effect.

Gravity bombs require aircraft to fly rather close to what may be a heavily defended target, which poses a significant risk to the launch aircraft. Cruise missiles equipped with large tandem-charge warheads can use the first charge to create a hole into which the missile flies before exploding the second charge, creating a similar effect of the delayed gravity bomb. An example of an anti-structure tandem-charge warhead is the BROACH warhead.

<doc id="728758" wikidata="Q1473891" url="?curid=728758" title="Abhorsen">
<text>Abhorsen is a fantasy novel by Australian writer Garth Nix, first published in 2003. It is the third book in the Old Kingdom series (following &quot;Sabriel&quot; and &quot;Lirael&quot;).

&quot;Abhorsen&quot; features Lirael, who is the recently revealed Abhorsen-in-Waiting; Prince Sameth, who is Lirael&#x27;s new-found nephew and descendant of the Wallmakers; Mogget, a bound servant of the Abhorsen line; and the Disreputable Dog.

The novel is named after the position of Abhorsen in the book&#x27;s world. The origin of this title is known: Nix chose the name referencing &quot;Abhorson&quot;, the executioner in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The Abhorsen&#x27;s House is besieged by Dead Hands led by Chlorr of the Mask under the control of Hedge the Necromancer, who in turn serves Orannis the Destroyer. With the help of their familiars Mogget and the Disreputable Dog, protagonists Lirael and Sameth escape the House and depart for the Red Lake, where the Destroyer is being unearthed, to rescue Sameth&#x27;s friend Nicholas Sayre from the Destroyer&#x27;s control, and prevent the Destroyer from consuming the world. Meanwhile, Prince Sameth&#x27;s parents, the Abhorsen Sabriel and King Touchstone, are in Ancelstierre to stop the slaughter of refugees forced into the Old Kingdom; but themselves become victims of an assassination attempt and barely escape. &quot;En route&quot; to the Red Lake, Lirael uses her Remembrancing powers to determine the means of re-imprisoning Orannis, and later defeats Hedge. In the end, all the leading characters re-enact the original binding of the Destroyer, with each member holding a bell to represent its namesake: King Touchstone (Ranna) and Abhorsen Sabriel (Saraneth), Sanar and Ryelle (Mosrael), Ellimere (Dyrim), the Disreputable Dog (Kibeth), Sameth (Belgaer), and Lirael (Astarael). When the re-enactment fails, Sameth frees Mogget, who identifies himself as the spirit &#x27;Yrael&#x27;, and imprisons the Destroyer. As Lirael prepares to give the necessary final blow, the Disreputable Dog sacrifices herself to complete it, in Lirael&#x27;s place. In the epilogue, the Dog revives Nicholas, and herself departs along the border of Life and Death.

==Characters==

* Lirael - New Abhorsen-in-waiting, daughter of the Clayr, and Remembrancer.
* Hedge - An evil necromancer who serves Orannis
* Orannis - The Destroyer, formerly a powerful free magic creature. The other seven Bright Shiners defeated and bound it.
* Prince Sameth - Sabriel&#x27;s and Touchstone&#x27;s son, prince of the Old Kingdom. Descendant of the Wallmakers and the ex-Abhorsen-in-waiting.
* Disreputable Dog - Lirael&#x27;s best friend, a free magic and Charter sending that Lirael summoned from a dog statue that she found in the library. The Disreputable Dog is actually what was left of a Bright Shiner from when the great Charters were created; she is Kibeth, the Walker.
* Mogget - Abhorsen&#x27;s servant in the form of a cat. Can also change shape into an albino dwarf. Another leftover from when the great Charters were created; he is the Eighth Bright Shiner, Yrael. He did not take sides for or against the creation of the Charter.
* Sabriel - Abhorsen and Queen of the Old Kingdom.
* King Touchstone - King of the Old Kingdom. Originally named Torrigan, he took on the name Touchstone when he claimed the Old Kingdom Throne. Named for the motley fool in &quot;As You Like It&quot; by William Shakespeare.
* Nicholas Sayre - An Ancelstierren friend of Sameth, avatar of Orannis, the Destroyer.
* Princess Ellimere - Princess of the Old Kingdom, next in line to the throne.
* Chlorr of the Mask - One of the greater dead, follows Hedge&#x27;s wishes. Close to the end of the book, Mogget hints that Chlorr was once an Abhorsen.

==Literary significance==
Abhorsen was a joint Aurealis Award winner for Best Young Adult Novel 2003.
The novel was a Teens&#x27; Top Ten selection for 2003 by the Young Adult Library Services Association.

<doc id="728760" wikidata="Q1093521" url="?curid=728760" title="Path dependence">
<text>Path dependence is a concept in the social sciences, referring to processes where past events or decisions constrain later events or decisions. It can be used to refer to outcomes at a single point in time or to long-run equilibria of a process. Path dependence has been used to describe institutions, technical standards, patterns of economic or social development, organizational behavior, and more.

In common usage, the phrase can imply two types of claims. The first is the broad concept that &quot;history matters,&quot; often articulated to challenge explanations that pay insufficient attention to historical factors. This claim can be formulated simply as &quot;the future development of an economic system is affected by the path it has traced out in the past&quot; or &quot;particular events in the past can have crucial effects in the future.&quot; The second is a more specific claim about how past events or decisions affect future events or decisions in significant or disproportionate ways, through mechanisms such as increasing returns, positive feedback effects, or other mechanisms.

==Commercial examples==

===Videocassette recording systems===

The videotape format war is a key example of path dependence. Three mechanisms &quot;independent of product quality&quot; could explain how VHS achieved dominance over Betamax from a negligible early adoption lead:
# A network effect: videocassette rental stores observed more VHS rentals and stocked up on VHS tapes, leading renters to buy VHS players and rent more VHS tapes, until there was complete vendor lock-in.
# A VCR manufacturer bandwagon effect of switching to VHS-production because they expected it to win the &quot;standards battle&quot;.
# Sony, the original developer of Betamax, did not let pornography companies license their technology for mass production, which meant that nearly all pornographic motion pictures released on video used VHS format.

An alternative analysis is that VHS was better-adapted to market demands (e.g. having a longer recording time). In this interpretation, path dependence had little to do with VHS&#x27;s success, which would have occurred even if Betamax had established an early lead.
===QWERTY keyboard===

The QWERTY keyboard is a prominent example of path dependence due to the widespread emergence and persistence of the QWERTY keyboard. QWERTY has persisted over time despite potentially more efficient keyboard arrangements being developed – QWERTY vs. Dvorak is an example of this. However as it is not clear whether other keyboard layouts really are better, there is still debate if this is a good example of path dependence.

===Railway track gauges===

The standard gauge of railway tracks is another example of path dependence which explains how a seemingly insignificant event or circumstance can change the choice of technology over the long run despite contemporary know-how showing such a choice to be inefficient. 

More than half the world&#x27;s railway gauges are , known as standard gauge, despite the consensus among engineers being that wider gauges have increased performance and speed. The path to the adoption of the standard gauge began in the late 1820s when George Stephenson, a British engineer, began work on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. His experience with primitive coal tramways resulted in this gauge width being copied by the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, then the rest of Great Britain, and finally by railroads in Europe and North America. 

There are tradeoffs involved in the choice of rail gauge between the cost of constructing a line (which rises with wider gauges) and various performance metrics, including maximum speed, low center of gravity (desirable, especially in double-stack rail transport). While the attempts with Brunel gauge, a significantly broader gauge failed, the widespread use of Iberian gauge, Russian gauge and Indian gauge, all of which are broader than Stephenson&#x27;s choice, show that there is nothing inherent to the 1435 mm gauge that led to its global success. 

==Economics==
Path dependence theory was originally developed by economists to explain technology adoption processes and industry evolution. The theoretical ideas have had a strong influence on evolutionary economics. A common expression of the concept is the claim that predictable amplifications of small differences are a disproportionate cause of later circumstances, and, in the &quot;strong&quot; form, that this historical hang-over is inefficient.

There are many models and empirical cases where economic processes do not progress steadily toward some pre-determined and unique equilibrium, but rather the nature of any equilibrium achieved depends partly on the process of getting there. Therefore, the outcome of a path-dependent process will often not converge towards a unique equilibrium, but will instead reach one of several equilibria (sometimes known as absorbing states).

This dynamic vision of economic evolution is very different from the tradition of neo-classical economics, which in its simplest form assumed that only a single outcome could possibly be reached, regardless of initial conditions or transitory events. With path dependence, both the starting point and &#x27;accidental&#x27; events (noise) can have significant effects on the ultimate outcome. In each of the following examples it is possible to identify some random events that disrupted the ongoing course, with irreversible consequences. 

=== Economic development ===
In economic development, it is said (initially by Paul David in 1985) that a &quot;standard&quot; that is first-to-market can become entrenched (like the QWERTY layout in typewriters still used in computer keyboards). He called this &quot;path dependence&quot;, and said that inferior standards can persist simply because of the legacy they have built up. That QWERTY vs. Dvorak is an example of this phenomenon, has been re-asserted, questioned, and continues to be argued. Economic debate continues on the significance of path dependence in determining how standards form.

Economists from Alfred Marshall to Paul Krugman have noted that similar businesses tend to congregate geographically (&quot;agglomerate&quot;); opening near similar companies attracts workers with skills in that business, which draws in more businesses seeking experienced employees. There may have been no reason to prefer one place to another before the industry developed, but as it concentrates geographically, participants elsewhere are at a disadvantage, and will tend to move into the hub, further increasing its relative efficiency. This network effect follows a statistical power law in the idealized case, though negative feedback can occur (through rising local costs).
Buyers often cluster around sellers, and related businesses frequently form business clusters, so a concentration of producers (initially formed by accident and agglomeration) can trigger the emergence of many dependent businesses in the same region.

In the 1980s, the US dollar exchange rate appreciated, lowering the world price of tradable goods below the cost of production in many (previously successful) U.S. manufacturers. Some of the factories that closed as a result, could later have been operated at a (cash-flow) profit after dollar depreciation, but reopening would have been too expensive. This is an example of hysteresis, switching barriers, and irreversibility.

If the economy follows adaptive expectations, future inflation is partly determined by past experience with inflation, since experience determines expected inflation and this is a major determinant of realized inflation.

A transitory high rate of unemployment during a recession can lead to a permanently higher unemployment rate because of the skills loss (or skill obsolescence) by the unemployed, along with a deterioration of work attitudes. In other words, cyclical unemployment may generate structural unemployment. This structural hysteresis model of the labour market differs from the prediction of a &quot;natural&quot; unemployment rate or NAIRU, around which &#x27;cyclical&#x27; unemployment is said to move without influencing the &quot;natural&quot; rate itself.

=== Types of path dependence ===
Liebowitz and Margolis distinguish &quot;types&quot; of path dependence; some do not imply inefficiencies and do not challenge the policy implications of neoclassical economics. Only &quot;third-degree&quot; path dependence—where switching gains are high, but transition is impractical—involves such a challenge. They argue that such situations should be rare for theoretical reasons, and that no real-world cases of private locked-in inefficiencies exist. Vergne and Durand qualify this critique by specifying the conditions under which path dependence theory can be tested empirically.

Technically, a path-dependent stochastic process has an asymptotic distribution that &quot;evolves as a consequence (function of) the process&#x27;s own history&quot;. This is also known as a non-ergodic stochastic process.

In &quot;The Theory of the Growth of the Firm&quot; (1959), Edith Penrose analyzed how the growth of a firm both organically and through acquisition is strongly influenced by the experience of its managers and the history of the firm&#x27;s development.

=== Conditions which give rise to path dependence ===
Path dependence may arise or be hindered by a number of important factors, these may include

* Durability of capital equipment
* Technical interrelatedness
* Increasing returns
* Dynamic increasing returns to adoption

==Social sciences==

=== Institutions ===
Recent methodological work in comparative politics and sociology has adapted the concept of path dependence into analyses of political and social phenomena. Path dependence has primarily been used in comparative-historical analyses of the development and persistence of institutions, whether they be social, political, or cultural. There are arguably two types of path-dependent processes:

* One is the critical juncture framework, most notably utilized by Ruth and David Collier in political science. In the critical , antecedent conditions allow contingent choices that set a specific trajectory of institutional development and consolidation that is difficult to reverse. As in economics, the generic drivers are: lock-in, positive feedback, increasing returns (the more a choice is made, the bigger its benefits), and self-reinforcement (which creates forces sustaining the decision).
* The other path-dependent process deals with reactive sequences where a primary event sets off a temporally-linked and causally-tight deterministic chain of events that is nearly uninterruptible. These reactive sequences have been used to link such things as the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. with welfare expansion, or the Industrial Revolution in England with the development of the steam engine.

The critical juncture framework has been used to explain the development and persistence of welfare states, labor incorporation in Latin America, and the variations in economic development between countries, among other things. Scholars such as Kathleen Thelen caution that the historical determinism in path-dependent frameworks is subject to constant disruption from institutional evolution.

Kathleen Thelen has criticized the application of QWERTY keyboard-style mechanisms to politics. She argues that such applications to politics are both too contingent and too deterministic. Too contingent in the sense that the initial choice is open and flukey, and too deterministic in the sense that once the initial choice is made, an unavoidable path inevitably forms from which there is no return.

Based on the theory of path dependence, Monika Stachowiak-Kudła and Janusz Kudła show that legal tradition affects the administrative court’s rulings in Poland. It also complements the two other reasons for diversified verdicts: the experience of the judges and courts (specialization) and preference (bias) for one of the parties. This effect is persistent even if the verdicts are controversial and result in serious consequences for a party and when the penalty paid by the complainant is perceived as excessive but fulfilling the strict rules of law. The German tradition of law favours legal certainty, while the courts from the former Russian and Austrian partitions are more likely to refer to the principle of justice. Interestingly, the institutional factors can be identified almost one hundred years after the end of the partition period and the unification of formal and material law, corroborating the existence of path dependence. 

=== Organizations ===
Paul Pierson&#x27;s influential attempt to rigorously formalize path dependence within political science, draws partly on ideas from economics. Herman Schwartz has questioned those efforts, arguing that forces analogous to those identified in the economic literature are not pervasive in the political realm, where the strategic exercise of power gives rise to, and transforms, institutions.

Especially sociology and organizational theory, a distinct yet closely related concept to path dependence is the concept of imprinting which captures how initial environmental conditions leave a persistent mark (or imprint) on organizations and organizational collectives (such as industries and communities), thus continuing to shape organizational behaviours and outcomes in the long run, even as external environmental conditions change.

=== Individuals and groups ===
The path dependence of emergent strategy has been observed in behavioral experiments with individuals and groups.

==Other examples==
*A general type of path dependence is a typological vestige.
**In typography, for example, some customs persist, although the reason for their existence no longer applies; for example, the placement of the period inside a quotation in U.S. spelling. In metal type, pieces of terminal punctuation, such as the comma and period, are comparatively small and delicate (as they must be x-height for proper kerning.) Placing the full-height quotation mark on the outside protected the smaller cast metal sort from damage if the word needed to be moved around within or between lines. This would be done even if the period did not belong to the text being quoted.
*Evolution is considered by some to be path-dependent and historically contingent: mutations occurring in the past have had long-term effects on current life forms, some of which may no longer be adaptive to current conditions. For instance, there is a controversy about whether the panda&#x27;s thumb is a leftover trait or not.
*In the computer and software markets, legacy systems indicate path dependence: customers&#x27; needs in the present market often include the ability to read data or run programs from past generations of products. Thus, for instance, a customer may need not merely the best available word processor, but rather the best available word processor that can read Microsoft Word files. Such limitations in compatibility contribute to lock-in, and more subtly, to design compromises for independently developed products, if they attempt to be compatible. Also see embrace, extend and extinguish.
*In socioeconomic systems, commercial fisheries&#x27; harvest rates and conservation consequences are found to be path dependent as predicted by the interaction between slow institutional adaptation, fast ecological dynamics, and diminishing returns.
*In physics and mathematics, a non-holonomic system is a physical system in which the states depend on the physical paths taken.

=== Ukraine ===

In Ukraine, Navy Day is a professional holiday that is celebrated on the first Sunday of July. The commemoration was established in 1996 (then to be celebrated August 1). Till 2012 the day was celebrated on August 1. From 2012 till 2015 Ukraine had the same date for its Navy Day as Russia and the Soviet Union (like Russia, Ukraine is a former Soviet republic); the Soviet Union introduced its Navy Day in June 1939; the date was chosen because of a connection with the day the Battle of Gangut took place. On 24 August 2014 Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko declared that Ukraine should not celebrate the holidays of the &quot;military-historical calendar of Russia&quot; but &quot;We will honor the defenders of our homeland, not someone else&#x27;s&quot;. On 12 June 2015 a Presidential decree by Poroshenko moved Ukraine&#x27;s Navy Day to the first Sunday of July.

The Day of Naval Forces/Marines of Ukraine is celebrated in Ukraine on the 23rd of May annually. On 23 May 1918 Hetman of the Ukrainian State Pavlo Skoropadskyi ordered the creation of a brigade of naval infantry consisting of three regiments.

=== United Kingdom ===
The term is also used in Britain to mean an open day at a dockyard such as HMNB Portsmouth, when the public can visit military ships and see air displays, roughly along the lines of an American Fleet Week.
The Royal Navy&#x27;s equivalent of &quot;Navy Day&quot; is Trafalgar Day, which is celebrated on 21 October.

=== United States ===
In the United States, the Navy League of the United States organized the first Navy Day in 1922, holding it on October 27 because it was the birthday of 26th President Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919, served 1901–1909), who was a naval enthusiast/promoter of sea power and former assistant Secretary of the Navy just before the Spanish–American War of 1898. Although meeting with mixed reviews the first year, in 1923 over 50 major cities participated, and the United States Navy sent a number of its ships to various port cities for the occasion. The 1945 Navy Day was an especially large celebration, with 33rd President Harry S. Truman (1884–1972, served 1945–1953), reviewing the returning home American fleet in New York Harbor after victory in World War II.

In 1949, Louis A. Johnson, (1891–1966, served 1949–1950), second Secretary of the newly merged and created Department of Defense, directed that the U.S. Navy&#x27;s participation occur on newly established Armed Forces Day for the unified/coordinated uniformed services in May, although as a private civilian organization, the Navy League was not affected by this directive, and continued to organize separate Navy Day celebrations as before. In the 1970s, historical research found that the &quot;birthday&quot; of the earlier Continental Navy during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), was determined to be October 13, 1775, and so Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt worked with the Navy League to define October 13 as the new date of Navy Day. However, Navy Day in the United States is still largely recognized as October 27, while October 13 is marked as the Navy Birthday. The period between these two dates constitute a festive period of celebrations of the birth of the Navy.

=== Venezuela and Colombia ===
July 24, the birthday of Simon Bolivar and the anniversary of the 1823 Patriot victory in the Battle of Lake Maracaibo, is marked as Navy Day in both Venezuela and Colombia. Both the Bolivarian Navy of Venezuela and the Colombian Navy hold major events to mark the holiday.

<text>The Worth Street station was a local station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. It is located at Lafayette Street and Worth Street, in Civic Center, Manhattan.

The Worth Street station was constructed for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) as part of the city&#x27;s first subway line, which was approved in 1900. Construction of the line segment that includes the Worth Street station started on July 10 of the same year. The station opened on October 27, 1904, as one of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway. The southbound platform was lengthened in the late 1940s. The station was closed on September 1, 1962, as a result of a platform lengthening project at Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall.

The Worth Street station contains two abandoned side platforms and four tracks. The station was built with tile and mosaic decorations. Many of these decorations have been covered with graffiti.

==History==

=== Construction and opening ===
Planning for a subway line in New York City dates to 1864. However, development of what would become the city&#x27;s first subway line did not start until 1894, when the New York State Legislature passed the Rapid Transit Act. The subway plans were drawn up by a team of engineers led by William Barclay Parsons, the Rapid Transit Commission&#x27;s chief engineer. It called for a subway line from New York City Hall in lower Manhattan to the Upper West Side, where two branches would lead north into the Bronx. A plan was formally adopted in 1897, and all legal conflicts concerning the route alignment were resolved near the end of 1899. The Rapid Transit Construction Company, organized by John B. McDonald and funded by August Belmont Jr., signed the initial Contract 1 with the Rapid Transit Commission in February 1900, in which it would construct the subway and maintain a 50-year operating lease from the opening of the line. In 1901, the firm of Heins &amp; LaFarge was hired to design the underground stations. Belmont incorporated the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) in April 1902 to operate the subway.

The Worth Street station was constructed as part of the route segment from Chambers Street to Great Jones Street. Construction on this section of the line began on July 10, 1900, and was awarded to Degnon-McLean Contracting Company. By late 1903, the subway was nearly complete, but the IRT Powerhouse and the system&#x27;s electrical substations were still under construction, delaying the system&#x27;s opening. The Worth Street station opened on October 27, 1904, as one of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway from City Hall to 145th Street on the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.

The first collision in the history of the New York City Subway system occurred at the station on January 11, 1905. On that date, the motorman of a southbound Lenox Avenue train did not obey a caution signal at the Spring Street station, which indicated that there was a train ahead between Canal Street and Worth Street, and collided into a Broadway train that was stopped at Worth Street, waiting for a signal to clear. The accident shattered the glass in the rear car of the Broadway train, and the first two cars of the Lenox Avenue train. Six people were hurt by falling glass. The accident could have been averted if the local tracks had had automatic tripping devices, which were present on the express tracks. The installation of these devices on the local tracks was considered to be impractical due to the high frequency of local service. The accident only resulted in a ten-minute delay in service, and after it was determined no people were killed, the trains proceeded in regular service.

=== Service changes and station renovations ===
After the first subway line was completed in 1908, the station was served by local trains along both the West Side (now the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line to Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street) and East Side (now the Lenox Avenue Line). West Side local trains had their southern terminus at City Hall during rush hours and South Ferry at other times, and had their northern terminus at 242nd Street. East Side local trains ran from City Hall to Lenox Avenue (145th Street).

On March 20, 1906, the IRT tested a vacuum cleaner connected to a portable wagon plant to clean the station. It found that it was very successful at removing dust from the station&#x27;s tiling and woodwork, and at removing greasy dirt from girders.

To address overcrowding, in 1909, the New York Public Service Commission proposed lengthening the platforms at stations along the original IRT subway. As part of a modification to the IRT&#x27;s construction contracts made on January 18, 1910, the company was to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car express and six-car local trains. In addition to $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) spent on platform lengthening, $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) was spent on building additional entrances and exits. It was anticipated that these improvements would increase capacity by 25 percent. The northbound platform of the Worth Street station was extended about northward into the &quot;electric manhole&quot;, a passageway leading to the equipment closet. The southbound platform was extended into the &quot;manholes&quot; in either direction. Six-car local trains began operating in October 1910. The Lexington Avenue Line opened north of Grand Central–42nd Street in 1918, and the original line was divided into an H-shaped system. All local trains were sent via the Lexington Avenue Line, running along the Pelham Line in the Bronx.

In December 1922, the Transit Commission approved a $3 million project to lengthen platforms at 14 local stations along the original IRT line, including Worth Street and seven other stations on the Lexington Avenue Line. Platform lengths at these stations would be increased from . The commission postponed the platform-lengthening project in September 1923, at which point the cost had risen to $5.6 million.

The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The downtown platform was lengthened in 1948 by the New York City Board of Transportation, providing for the full length of a ten-car, train. The work was done only on the downtown side to save costs, and that platform was chosen for lengthening since it was the main unloading side in the business district.

=== Closure ===

On January 3, 1957, the New York City Transit Authority announced that this station would be closed within two years as part of a plan to improve the Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall station. As part of the project, the platforms at Brooklyn Bridge would be lengthened to accommodate ten-car trains, and the curved platform at Brooklyn Bridge would be eliminated. In order to achieve both of these goals, the platforms would be extended to the north. The Worth Street station would be closed as it would only be feet away from the platforms at Brooklyn Bridge. If the station were retained, service on the line would be slowed down, and there was no suitable signal system that could operate with such a short distance. The project would cost $4.4 million and was projected to take two years.

The station was closed on September 1, 1962, with the completion of work at Brooklyn Bridge. While the opening of new entrance at the northwest corner of Reade Street and Lafayette Street was also scheduled for that date, it ended up opening a week later. After the Worth Street station&#x27;s closure, Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall was renamed Brooklyn Bridge–Worth Street. This name lasted until at least 1984, though has since fallen out of use.

== Station layout ==

Like other local stations, Worth Street has four tracks and two abandoned side platforms. The two local tracks, which formerly served the station, are used by the 6 train at all times, &lt;6&gt; trains during weekdays in the peak direction, and the 4 train during late nights. The two express tracks are used by the 4 and 5 trains during daytime hours. The platforms were originally long, like at other local stations on the original IRT. The southbound platform later became long. The platforms were curved significantly. The curves made it impossible for all doors on trains to open at the station, when it was in use, and many accidents occurred at the large gaps between trains and the platforms. Wide fare control areas were located at the southern end of the platforms.

As with other stations built as part of the original IRT, the station was constructed using a cut-and-cover method. The tunnel is covered by a U-shaped trough that contains utility pipes and wires. The bottom of this trough contains a foundation of concrete no less than thick. Each former platform consists of concrete slabs, beneath which are drainage basins. The former platforms contain glazed tile columns spaced every . Alternating platform columns had tiles reading &quot;WORTH&quot;. Additional columns between the tracks, spaced every , support the jack-arched concrete station roofs. Alternating columns between the local and express tracks had black on white signs reading &quot;Worth.&quot; There is a gap between the trough wall and the platform walls, which are made of -thick brick covered over by a tiled finish.

The decorative scheme consisted of blue/green tile tablets, buff tile bands, a green terracotta cornice, and buff terracotta plaques. The mosaic tiles at all original IRT stations were manufactured by the American Encaustic Tile Company, which subcontracted the installations at each station. The decorative work was performed by tile contractor Manhattan Glass Tile Company and terracotta contractor Atlantic Terra Cotta Company. The station walls had shields with the white letter &quot;W&quot;. The station&#x27;s walls and columns have been heavily covered with graffiti.

The station lies beneath the sidewalk on the west side of Foley Square. When the Federal Plaza Building was in the planning stages, it was found that, because of the existence of the station, the building could not extend out to Foley Square. As a result, that structure is set far back from the street, well beyond the station. The building&#x27;s plaza and fountain lie directly above the station.

<text>The Centennial College of Applied Arts and Technology is a public college in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is the oldest publicly funded college in Ontario. Its campuses are situated on the east side of the city, particularly in Scarborough, with an aerospace center at Downsview Park in North York.

Centennial College has been recognized as a culturally diverse post-secondary institution; almost 100 ethno-cultural groups are represented and 80 languages are spoken on campus. Its main research facilities are its Wearable, Interactive and Mobile Technologies Access Centre in Healthcare, established in 2015 through a $1.75 million federal grant and its aerospace innovation hub, under construction at the former de Havilland plant in west-end Toronto.

==Programs==
Centennial offers more than 260 programs, including bachelor&#x27;s degrees, diplomas, certificates, post-graduate certificates and apprenticeship programs, across many fields of study.

Founded in 1966, the college offers programs in business, communication arts, community and consumer services, applied computing, engineering technology, health sciences, animation, music, theatre, film and design. Centennial College supports enrolments of 22,000 full-time students and 19,000 part-time students.

==History==
Centennial College was the first community college to be opened in Ontario during the formation of the province&#x27;s public college system in the 1960s. Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology was established on May 21, 1965, under the direction of the Hon. William Davis, Minister of Education. The system has grown to encompass 24 public colleges serving 200 provincial communities. As Centennial College&#x27;s first site, Warden Woods Campus opened on October 17, 1966, with 514 students enrolled in 16 career-oriented programs, including journalism, secretarial science, and early childhood education. The campus used a decommissioned federal building that had been renovated to serve as a teaching institution. It evolved into health/nutrition, hospitality, child studies, and community service programs. In 1973, the Ontario government transferred responsibility for nursing education from the province&#x27;s hospitals to its colleges. Locally, the Scarborough Regional and the Toronto East General nursing schools joined Centennial College to form the School of Health Sciences, based at Warden Woods Campus.

In 1992, the Scarborough Board of Education and the college established an adult education center, the Scarborough Career Planning Centre, at the Centennial College. In 1994 the entities agreed to establish the center there beginning in the fall of that year. Centennial College proliferated, necessitating the establishment of additional campuses in the east end of Toronto to accommodate new programs and students. Warden Woods Campus closed in autumn of 2004 and was demolished for a housing development. Most programs were relocated to the Centennial Science and Technology Centre (now Morningside Campus), which began operations the same year.

Centennial College opened a campus in China in 2016, the first approved institution teaching a Canadian curriculum in the country. In 2018 Centennial had the highest number of international student visas of any post-secondary institution in Canada. Ontario Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk identified the reliance on international student tuition as a &quot;risky formula&quot;, in 2021, with Centennial College being the Toronto-area college most reliant.

==Campuses==
Existing campuses are located at:
===Morningside Campus===
Located in Scarborough, Morningside Campus (previously Centennial College HP Science and Technology Centre) opened in the summer of 2004 to house joint programs with the nearby University of Toronto Scarborough. The campus operates health science and environmental science programs, architectural technology, biotechnology, personal support workers, paramedics, pharmacy technology, environmental technology, massage therapy, and others.

===Progress Campus===
Progress Campus in Scarborough is Centennial&#x27;s largest campus. The programs offered there (located at 941 Progress Avenue, near Markham Road and Highway 401), are in computer science and technology, business, hospitality, and culinary arts. Students in the latter often work as hospitality staff/chefs in the student restaurant, The Local, or in the Student Centre kitchen run by the CCSAI. Progress Campus is the site of a Library and Academic Facility and an expanded Athletic and Wellness Centre, both of which opened in September 2011.

It&#x27;s also home to the Centennial Event Centre, a multi-use venue for special events, corporate meetings and social functions. It is located on the top floor of the new Centennial student residence, which opened in August 2016 and replaced an older facility. The &quot;A Block&quot; (located on 939 Progress Avenue) of the campus was built in 1994 by the Scarborough Board of Education to house the students from Scarborough Centre for Alternative Studies adult secondary school.

===Ashtonbee Campus===
Located at 75 Ashtonbee Road in Scarborough, this campus houses the automotive services technician, career and college transition, motive power technician, auto body repair technician, general arts and science, and other programs. Ashtonbee Campus is regarded as one of the largest transportation technology training centers in North America.

In 2017, Ashtonbee Campus&#x27; library renovation project was one of 10 winners in the 2017 Ontario Association of Architects Awards Design Excellence division.

===Story Arts Centre===
Located near the Danforth at 951 Carlaw Avenue in East York, this campus opened in 1996 to house Centennial&#x27;s award-winning School of Communications, Media, Arts, and Design, a &quot;premiere media and visual arts learning center&quot; in the region according to the East York Foundation. Taught here are most of the creative communication programs such as advertising and public relations, as well as professionally oriented programs in the arts, such as digital animation and game design. The School of Communications, Media, Arts, and Design also offers performance programs, including Theatre Arts and Performance, Music Industry Arts and Performance, Dance Performance, and Performing Arts Fundamentals. The performance programs are housed in leased space at the Daniels Spectrum in downtown Toronto. The building housing the Story Arts Centre was built to house the Toronto Teachers&#x27; College in 1955 and television buffs may know it as the location of the Canadian TV teen drama &quot;Degrassi High&quot; in the early 1990s. Since the closure of Toronto&#x27;s francophone Collège des Grands-Lacs in 2002, Collège Boréal, a francophone college based primarily in Sudbury, also offered some French-language college programs at this facility until moving to its new campus at One Yonge Street in 2012.

===Downsview Aerospace Hub===
In November 2016, work on the $72 million Downsview Park Aerospace Campus officially got underway with a groundbreaking ceremony attended by Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne and federal Hon. Minister of Science Kirsty Duncan. With joint funding from the provincial and the federal government, the aerospace campus is being built on the site of the former de Havilland Aircraft Company Ltd. assembly plant in Downsview Park, Toronto. Centennial College is a partner in the Downsview aerospace consortium, DAIR, along with the University of Toronto, York University, Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University), and eight companies including Pratt and Whitney Canada, FlightSafety, Canadensys, UTC Aerospace, MDA, Safran Landing Systems, Honeywell and Bombardier Aerospace.

In May 2017, Centennial College received $2.3 million in funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) to research electric landing gear for energy-efficient aircraft.

===Suzhou Centennial College===
In 2016, Suzhou Centennial College (SCC) officially launched. It is the first Canadian college approved by the Chinese government to deliver Canadian education in China. Suzhou Centennial College offers 18 programs, including four Centennial programs providing Canadian credentials in accounting, finance, software engineering, and business foundations.
===Warden Woods===
Warden Woods Campus located at 651 Warden Avenue was formerly the Canadian Arsenals Limited plant, acquired in 1964. It closed in 2004 with site mostly demolished in 2005 and now a residential development. The historic Bell Estate c. 1830 has been preserved.

==School of Hospitality, Tourism and Culinary Arts, Event Centre and Residence==
Responding to a critical shortage of affordable rental accommodations in Toronto at the time, Centennial College purchased the Howard Johnson Plaza Hotel Toronto East in June 2001 across the street from the Progress Campus and converted the hotel building into a college residence in time for the fall semester. The amenities and level of finish in the hotel building were considerably higher than that of many purpose-built college residences. Amenities included an indoor pool, glass elevator, four-story atrium, and warmly decorated rooms. The Centennial College Residence and Conference Centre was originally configured to accommodate 380 student residents, based on two students sharing a room, though later configurations allowed the creation of some single-occupancy rooms.

Rapid enrolment growth, fuelled by international students, compelled the college to examine building a new residence on the Progress Campus property. The resulting eight-story quadrangle building was designed to house 740 students in two- and four-bed suites, complete with a bathroom and kitchen in every suite, with all residents having their private bedrooms. The new building is a hybrid: the ground floor is dedicated to Centennial&#x27;s School of Hospitality, Tourism, and Culinary Arts, complete with seven kitchen labs, eight classrooms and a restaurant and cafe (The Local) open to the public. The conference and center located on the top floor can accommodate up to 450 guests. Construction broke ground in October 2014 and the residence began occupancy in August 2016. Knightstone Capital Management provided the planning, financing and management of the project; other key partners include Diamond Schmitt Architects, Canadian Campus Communities and FRAM Building Group.

==Academics==

Centennial College offers full-time programs in more than 100 fields of study. These programs emphasize experiential learning with laboratory instruction, paid cooperative education opportunities, and industry and agency field placements. All Centennial programs are developed and kept current with the assistance of program advisory committees (PACs), made up of academic advisors and employer representatives. Their participation ensures the education and skills students receive at Centennial are up-to-date and relevant to the industry they are preparing to enter. Centennial offers a variety of innovative degree programs. Five joint-degree programs in paramedicine, journalism, new media studies, environmental science &amp; technology, and applied microbiology are taught in conjunction with the University of Toronto Scarborough, and the Bachelor of Science Nursing program is delivered jointly with Ryerson University. Centennial was among the first colleges in Ontario to receive approval for applied-degree programs in computer and communication networking, and software systems: design, development, and management.

This marked the first time an Ontario College took part in the festival. The student wearing the costume was interviewed by CP24 and various other television stations and media affiliates. In July 2011, the students made a return to the Scotiabank Caribbean Carnival Festival and participated in the King and Queen show.

<doc id="728768" wikidata="Q1142102" url="?curid=728768" title="Tokyo Babylon">
<text>, also known as Tokyo Babylon: A Save Tokyo City Story, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Clamp. It follows Subaru Sumeragi, the head of the Sumeragi clan, and his sister Hokuto, as they work to protect Tokyo from a myriad of supernatural perils while living with a man named Seishiro Sakurazuka. Shinshokan serialized it in &quot;South&quot; and &quot;Wings&quot; magazines from 1990 to 1993, and was collected in 7 &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes.

Tokyopop first distributed the English-language version of the manga; this is now handled by Yen Press. The series is based on a self-written work, &quot;dōjinshi&quot;, writer Nanase Ohkawa created. Clamp decided to add dark social themes to the serialization because of the chapters&#x27; lengths. Clamp found it difficult to write the manga because it was being serialized alongside their first work, &quot;RG Veda&quot;. Between 1992 and 1994, Madhouse studio adapted &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot; into a two-part original video animation series focused on the original storylines. PDS also produced a live-action feature film sequel, &quot;Tokyo Babylon 1999&quot;, which was released in August 1993, which is set after the events of the manga. A full anime television series adaptation, &quot;Tokyo Babylon 2021&quot;, was announced in 2020, but was cancelled in the wake of accusations of plagiarism.

The series has been well received for its focus on occultism and social themes. It is also famous in the West for including a homosexual relationship, explored through the characters of Subaru and Seishiro. The writers&#x27; heavy focus on Subaru&#x27;s character development stood out alongside the art produced by Clamp. The manga is notorious for its open and tragic ending which is followed in Clamp&#x27;s next work, &quot;X&quot;.

==Plot==
Sixteen-year-old Subaru Sumeragi is a very powerful Japanese magician, often referred as a modern &quot;onmyōji&quot;. He is the thirteenth head of the foremost family of &quot;onmyōji&quot; in Japan, which has served the Emperor for centuries. As a result, he is called upon to solve various occult mysteries. He sometimes stumbles on people his kind nature compels him to help. He lives in Tokyo with his twin sister Hokuto, an exuberant girl, whose chief occupations are designing eccentric clothing for herself and her brother, and their mutual friend Seishiro Sakurazuka, a kindly, 25-year-old veterinarian, who often declares his love for Subaru. There are early hints of Seishiro&#x27;s true nature. Hokuto jokes about him being a member of the family of &quot;Sakurazukamori&quot;, a clan of assassins who use onmyōjitsu to kill and are said to be the Sumeragis&#x27; opposite. Seishiro met Subaru as a kid and was impressed with the child&#x27;s purity. Rather than killing him, Seishiro made a bet with him instead: He would meet Subaru again, and would spend one year with him, protecting him and trying to love him. If, at the end of that year, he felt something for Subaru which distinguished him from a thing he could easily destroy (as he could not with any other person), then he would not kill him. To recognize him, he marked him with inverted pentagrams on both hands, the sign of the Sakurazukamori&#x27;s prey.

When Seishiro loses an eye protecting Subaru, the teenager realizes he is in love with him. As the year is over, Seishiro declares himself the winner of the bet. He breaks Subaru&#x27;s arm and tortures him, but fails to kill him, as Subaru&#x27;s grandmother breaks his spell - an action which leaves her crippled. Subaru&#x27;s shock leaves him in a catatonic state. Hokuto feels guilty for promoting Seishiro, whom she knew to be dangerous, but believed to be the only one who might touch Subaru&#x27;s heart. As a result, Hokuto asks Seishiro to kill her instead to protect her brother. Seeing her in a dream, Subaru is shocked out of his catatonia by her action. He vows to find Seishiro and take revenge for his sister&#x27;s death, abandoning his present life. The manga ends with an adult and distant Subaru still searching for Seishiro.

==Characters==
:
:The 13th Head of the Sumeragi clan, a family of &quot;onmyōji&quot;. He tends to be rather shy, but is extremely kindhearted. He constantly wears gloves over his hands for reasons known only to his grandmother.
:
:Subaru&#x27;s eccentric twin sister. She is quick-witted, bold and impulsive, the polar opposite of Subaru. While she lacks most of Subaru&#x27;s strong spiritual abilities, she is still able to cast unique spells. She always means well and acts in Subaru&#x27;s best interests. Hokuto designs the outrageous outfits she and Subaru often don.
:
:A veterinarian who claims to be romantically interested in Subaru. He is secretly the &quot;Sakurazukamori&quot;, a murderous &quot;onmyōji&quot; who first met him seven years ago.

==Production==

&quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot; is based on a one-shot that Clamp head writer Nanase Ohkawa wrote for a magazine that featured &quot;dōjinshi&quot;. After Clamp got to illustrate the cover of the same magazine, &quot;Wings&quot;, with Subaru and Hokuto, the magazine proposed Clamp turn it into a series for their special edition &quot;South&quot;. Initially, the series was going to be called &quot;Tokyo&quot; but Clamp wanted to change it to give a more modern tone with the inclusion of Babylon according to them; the series was titled &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot; reflecting how the city of Babylon resembled Tokyo, according to Clamp. The one-shot&#x27;s characters, most notably Seishiro, were changed slightly when the series began.

Subaru and his twin sister Hokuto, and Seishiro, were conceived by the series&#x27; creator Ohkawa for a &quot;dōjinshi&quot; novel about an &quot;onmyōji&quot; who hunts elves. Only its beginning remains. The characters were drawn twice for covers, and when &quot;South&quot; asked Clamp to create a new series for them, these characters were used. Originally, the twins were conceived more as mascots, with Subaru being a penguin called Leone, named after the Subaru Leone car. Both Subaru and Hokuto were modified from the original art, whereas Seishiro was completely redesigned. Ohkawa remembers having trouble writing Subaru as she was not used to writing kind-hearted characters. Like Kero from their other manga &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot;, the staff thought about drawing a pet, with Subaru and Hokuto originally being considered as one. Since Subaru and Hokuto were the protagonists, whenever the magazines required an image for &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot;, both Subaru and Hokuto were used together.

When &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot;″s serialization began, Clamp was also writing &quot;RG Veda&quot; for the monthly magazine &quot;Wings&quot;. While the authors found this complicated, the series&#x27; quarterly publication of sixty pages resulted in the authors making several changes. The length of each chapter led the authors to write a darker story rather than a soft one as originally planned. Based on their experience in Tokyo, Clamp incorporated dark social themes, making the series realistic despite its focus on occultism. This also gave each chapter its own theme. Ohkawa believes their young age when writing the manga also influenced most of the series&#x27; negative messages. Although when the series began, the ending was already planned, it was not until the Tokyo Tower chapter that Clamp set the general atmosphere, with the pilot being perceived as a comedy. The next chapter involving Subaru&#x27;s past meeting with a man, later revealed to be Seishiro, then sets the stage for the series&#x27; future. Since his introduction, Seishiro was written with the idea of him having a different agenda in contrast to his actions and dialog with the other leads. Seishiro was the easiest cast member to write while Subaru was the most challenging based on his good nature. In retrospect, Ohkawa believes that while &quot;RG Veda&quot; was their first series, &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot; was their most original first work as they did not use other people&#x27;s materials for this manga and it was influenced by their way of living. Though a 1990s manga, the narrative was influenced by the 1980s.

In creating the art, colored weft and light colors were used for the main illustrations. This proved to be difficult for the authors. Ohkawa believes the art was influenced by the years when the manga was published. This is reflected in how Clamp&#x27;s artwork changed, particularly the clothing and, most notably, Hokuto&#x27;s dresses. Mokona&#x27;s works have been drawn with increasingly thicker lines across the serialzation of the manga. The character&#x27;s faces have much thicker lines in the third volume of &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot; compared to when the story first got serialized in South. This was made because the story had a serious, heavy theme, fine lines simply cannot bring out enough power to convince readers of the gravitas, so we make thicker lines when it fits the work. Such work caused Mokona to rely more on her stamina to properly draw the series.

==Themes==
The series focuses on several social themes, such as faith, organ donation and the treatment of middle-aged men. However, the main philosophy seen across the storyline is individualism, the stance that emphasizes the moral worth of an individual. Subaru and Hokuto believe that nobody can fully understand another person&#x27;s suffering. Despite his belief in this philosophy, Subaru is a resigned individual who worries more about others than himself. Subaru believes he can hurt others because he will never understand them. The same problem comes from Subaru and Hokuto being twins and trying to see each other as different people. Across the plot, Subaru develops as an individual. Seishiro deems his actions as arrogant for assuming the guilt. In addition, Subaru begins to take actions he believes are immoral, despite his good intentions, such as lying to a mother about her daughter&#x27;s wish to stop her from taking revenge. &quot;Zona Negativa&quot; stated that despite the series is serialized in a &quot;shōjo&quot; magazine for young women, Subaru&#x27;s hero journey felt more like that of a manga serialized in a &quot;shōnen&quot; magazine for young men, due to the many types of enemies he faces while finding his foes&#x27; deep nature.

Due to the dark nature Seishiro hides from Subaru, the two can be regarded as the yin and yang as the former contrasts his the latter&#x27;s kind self even when interacting about his job. Subaru&#x27;s hidden romantic feelings towards Seishiro become obvious as the manga progresses as he becomes astonished when Seishiro keep professing his love towards him. The character&#x27;s relationship with Seishiro led novelist Yoshiki Tanaka to call it tragic and striking, despite his early thoughts that it was a use of a relationship to appeal to female readers. When Subaru realizes his feelings towards him, his state can be compared to that the one of a hatched bird egg as a result of the maturity he shows in the process. &quot;Anime Feminist&quot; claims that while Subaru&#x27;s characterization heavily relies on empathy, Clamp appears to send a message to the readers using Subaru as an audience surrogate that it is important for everybody to value themselves too although empathy on itself does not qualify as a negative trait. &quot;Manga Bookshelf&quot; focused more on how Subaru lost part of his identity as he saw Hokuto as another part of him leading to his lonely finale persona.

The first episode has Subaru investigating the meaning behind several accidents in the construction of a building, while in the second he meets another &quot;onmyōji&quot; who is helping the police find a serial killer.

====TV series====
On October 25, 2020 at 15:00 UTC (October 26, 2020, at midnight Japan Standard Time), a trailer was released for a new anime adaptation of &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot;. The series, titled &quot;Tokyo Babylon 2021&quot;, was to have been produced by GoHands, and was originally scheduled to premiere in April 2021. On November 19, it was confirmed that Shingo Suzuki and Susumu Kudo would have directed the series, Jun Kumagai would have overseen the series&#x27; scripts, Makoto Furuta would have designed the characters while serving as chief animation director with Keiji Tani, and Noriyuki Asakura would have composed the series&#x27; music at King Records. Shouta Aoi would have performed the series&#x27; opening theme song, while Nana Mizuki would have performed the series&#x27; closing theme song. On the same day, however, the anime production was accused of plagiarizing outfit designs for Subaru and Hokuto. After an investigation, on December 4, 2020, the anime producer apologized on their official website and announced that they would be changing the designs. Due to the necessary changes to be made, on December 24, 2020, the anime production committee announced that the series was delayed to an unspecified date. After more cases of plagiarism surfaced through an internal investigation, on March 29, 2021, the production committee announced that the current TV series would be canceled, while a new anime production would be produced by a different studio.

On August 3, 2021, it was reported that GoHands was suing King Records for for failing to pay the expenses they previously agreed to pay. In the lawsuit, it was revealed the GoHands series was planned to have run for 21 episodes. According to the same lawsuit, the first 13 episodes were completed by November 2020.

===Live-action film===
A live-action film called &quot;Tokyo Babylon/1999&quot; was based on the series. It takes place five years after the end of the manga and its plot is based on the &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot; story &quot;Call.A&quot; in volume three. Director George Iida requested the help of the OVA producer Yumiko Masujima in casting the main characters. The film is famous for being the first live-action production based on a Clamp series and the film&#x27;s director, George Iida, expressed his satisfaction with the positive fan response. Following the end of the production of &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot;, Iida asked Clamp to help with a sequel movie. The main idea was for Subaru and Seishiro to clash again. For this live-action sequel, &quot;Tokyo Babylon/1999&quot;, Toshihide Tonesaku played Subaru, his first role as a leading man.

The plot has Subaru investigating the death of a former enemy of the Sumeragi clan, Kaneyama. Before his death, Kaneyama had undertaken a new project: teaching seven girls how to use dark magic to take revenge on those they deem &quot;guilty,&quot; beginning with an abusive teacher. One of the girls, Kurumi, starts to feel remorse; however, she is convinced by the others to continue with their plans. When Subaru attempts to stop them, they declare him to be their enemy and attack him. Subaru learns that his former friend-turned-enemy, assassin Seishiro, was the one who killed Kaneyama, and he has now turned his sights on the girls. The girls grow increasingly sick as a result of using the spells, and Subaru tries once more to save them. Seishiro appears, claiming that none of the girls can be saved. Subaru and Seishiro fight, only to be stopped by the appearance of the ghost of Hokuto, who asks them to stop for her sake. Seishiro leaves, and the fight is unresolved.

===Other media===
Subaru and Seishirō return in Clamp&#x27;s apocalyptic manga series &quot;X&quot;. The story, set nine years following the end of &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot;, has the two &quot;onmyōji&quot; on opposite sides during the final battle for humanity&#x27;s future. Despite having no relation to &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot;, Clamp&#x27;s manga &quot;xxxHolic&quot; is also focused on social pathologies but with a different approach. Alternative versions of Subaru and Seishiro also appear in the crossover manga &quot;&quot;, with Subaru appearing as a vampire and Seishiro as a vampire hunter pursuing him.

==Reception==

The &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot; manga series has been popular, with its English releases often appearing on Diamond Comic Distributors&#x27; lists of best-selling comics. The series is credited for being one of the first &quot;onmyoji&quot; manga. It received generally positive critical response with the writers from &quot;Manga Bookshelf&quot; and &quot;Mania Entertainment&quot; referring to it as one of Clamp&#x27;s best works based on the social themes reflected in the main cast whose traits, are developed across the story. In &quot;Subaru Sumeragi and the dark side of total empathy in Tokyo Babylon&quot;, &quot;Anime Feminist&quot; claims that while Subaru&#x27;s characterization heavily relies on empathy, Clamp appears to send a message to the readers using Subaru as an audience surrogate that it is important for everybody to value themselves too although empathy on itself does not qualify as negative trait.

Besides its focus on supernatural events, the series is famous for exploring young homosexual romance, &quot;shonen ai&quot;, seen in the interactions between Subaru and Seishiro. In &quot;&quot;, Jason Thompson commented that the manga is well known in the West for being one of the most famous and first portrayals of a homosexual relationship. &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; regarded &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot; as one of Clamp&#x27;s most famous works despite lacking an anime. They also cited the tragic relationship between Subaru and Seishiro as one of its biggest strengths.

When the series was reaching its climax, &quot;Wings&quot; editor Miki Ishikawa remembers receiving several letters from fans asking for a happy ending. Once the series ended, more letters expressed sadness and shock over the tragic ending; fans wanted more explanations of Hokuto&#x27;s fate. Regarding this character, Ishikawa considered her popularity an exception, considering most readers tend to be more attracted to the series&#x27; male characters. The writers from &quot;Manga Book Shelf&quot; noted that the series&#x27; open ending has also been a subject of controversie with fans, but Seishiro&#x27;s dark revelation, despite how it seems, had a major impact on the reader. The tragic ending portrayed in the final volume made &quot;Anime News Network&quot; comment that Subaru is, &quot;treated like absolute crap despite being one of the purest boys in anime and manga&quot;. Regarding Subaru&#x27;s darker characterization in the finale, Rebecca Silverman from &quot;Anime News Network&quot; says he &quot;became&quot; Seishiro. Silverman commented that this change is paralleled in their next work, &quot;xxxHolic&quot;, where its lead character Kimihiro Watanuki, began to act like his former boss Yuko Ichihara.

The artwork was praised for its appeal despite &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reviewing it nearly twenty years after its original release. Most of the reviewer&#x27;s compliments referred to the landscapes and the atmosphere, while &quot;Mania Entertainment&quot; also praised its simple state created by Mokona. &quot;Anime News Network&quot; liked the clothing the cast wears. Jason Thompson enjoyed the background details. The city of Tokyo is well illustrated, giving it a realistic look. &quot;Manga News&quot;, felt the artwork had the appeal of other Clamp series, most notably &quot;RG Veda&quot;, even though both series were published at the same time. Furthermore, the characters designs were praised for their uniqueness. In another overview of the series, &quot;Manga News&quot; felt that the artwork had a charm in the way it was executed through the storyline&#x27;s style such as how different the secondary characters are from the main characters.

The OVAs were the subject of positive response thanks to its animation, which has been called &quot;stunning&quot;. Furthermore, reviewers had positive opinions with its dark images. They have been recommended to &quot;X&quot; fans for Subaru&#x27;s appearances as well as to female viewers. The story of the OVAs were described as &quot;complex&quot;, and has been praised for its focus on horror even though the violent imagery may bother viewers.

<doc id="728770" wikidata="Q79056" url="?curid=728770" title="Hans-Peter Martin">
<text>Hans-Peter Martin (born 11 August 1957) is an Austrian author and journalist and former politician who has been a Member of the European Parliament between 1999 and 2014.

== Journalist and author ==

Born in Bregenz, Austria, Martin graduated from the University of Vienna in 1984. Already by then, he worked for the German weekly news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;. 1986, he became an editor, from 1989 he became the foreign correspondent of Der Spiegel, located in Rio de Janeiro. 1996, he become the foreign correspondent for Vienna and Prague. As a freelance writer, he has written and co-authored several popular books, among them the best-selling &quot;The Global Trap: Globalization and the Assault on Prosperity and Democracy&quot; (&quot;Die Globalisierungsfalle&quot;, 1996), &quot;Bitter Pills&quot; (&quot;Bittere Pillen&quot;) about the pros and cons of pharmaceuticals and &quot;The European Trap&quot; (&quot;Die Europafalle&quot;, only available in German but a partial translation is available on Martin&#x27;s website), an inside analysis of European integration, faults of the European bureaucracy and lobbyism in the EU.

The publishing house Penguin Random House released a new book by Hans-Peter Martin carrying the title &quot;Game Over: Wellbeing for the few, Democracy for no one, Nationalism for all – and then?&quot; in September 2018.&quot;Game over&quot; was shortlisted, together with nine other books, for the best German Economic Book of the year 2018.

&quot;Game Over&quot; has been subject to numerous reviews:

The German weekly &quot;Die Zeit&quot; called the book &quot;Discussion inspiring&quot; and wrote that &quot;The book by Hans-Peter Martin is neither scaremongering nor defeatist. It convinces by chaining together a variety of societal phenomena which are rarely combined in popular discourse: the unbroken neoliberal agenda and capital accumulation leading to the breakdown of individual liberties, democracy, and – eventually – war. This is the challenging thesis of the book.&quot;

The German newsmagazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; wrote: &quot;The bad news is that the author is likely to be correct in all of his analyses. The good news is that for each game that ends, a new one begins.&quot;

== European Parliament 1999–2004 ==
In the 1999 European Parliament elections Martin was elected as the independent frontrunner of the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPOe). Martin left the European Parliamentary Group of Social Democrats in 2004.

Since then Martin was reelected through his independent candidate list, Hans-Peter Martin&#x27;s List, in 2004 and 2009.

Early in 2004, he accused MEPs of all parties of falsely claiming reimbursement of travel and subsistence expenses. He produced evidence of MEP&#x27;s signing the register in the morning to receive their daily allowance, and then immediately leaving the building. Broadcast on German TV, the accusations caused an uproar. The then European Parliament spokesman Hans Gert Pöttering dismissed Martin&#x27;s accusations as unnecessarily aggressive and the President of the Parliament Pat Cox said that he would have preferred to deal with the case internally.

In response, Martin was accused of claiming too much in meal expenses. He was later cleared of this charge.

Eventually the disclosures and the public outrage Martin&#x27;s revelations induced resulted in a change of the expense system.

== European Parliament 2004–09 ==

In the 2004 European Parliament elections Hans-Peter Martin decided to compete on his own party list &quot;Hans-Peter Martin&#x27;s List – For genuine control and transparency in Brussels&quot; (&quot;Liste Dr. Hans-Peter Martin – Für echte Kontrolle in Brüssel&quot;). For an independent he received a surprising 14% of the vote – more than the Greens or the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party – and gained two of Austria&#x27;s seats in the European Parliament. He has been widely credited with having reduced the vote share of the far-right parties.

The second mandate went to Austrian Karin Resetarits, a former journalist with the Austrian public broadcaster ORF and a private radio station. However, Martin and Resetarits soon found themselves in heavy disagreement and ceased to work together. She later joined the Liberal group in the European Parliament on June 7, 2005 and was not reelected.

Martin&#x27;s list also competed in the Austrian legislative elections of 2006, but received only 2.8% of the vote and thus was blocked from entry into the Austrian parliament by the requirement to at least have 4% of the vote. Martin explained the unexpectedly low result with accusations of &quot;expedient but contrary to the rule&quot; use of the secretarial allowance, which were widely publicised in the Austrian media. The later court ruling stated that Martin used the funds correctly and did not benefit from the money, but as he did not follow some formal requirements he was ordered to repay the funds. Martin argued that this was a political decision.

== European Parliament 2009–14 ==

In 2009, Martin flirted with the idea of heading a planned Austrian list of the pan-European eurosceptical alliance Libertas.eu, but later rebuffed Libertas&#x27; advances.

While Libertas finally didn&#x27;t manage to set up a list at all, Martin successfully competed again with his independent Hans-Peter Martin&#x27;s List. He even surprised many by increasing his vote share to 18%, giving his list three seats in the European Parliament.

In 2014, Martin decided against standing for election, instead returning to journalism. Reflecting on his political work, Martin consistently defines himself as a &quot;buffer against the far-right&quot;.

=== Anti-Lobbyism campaign ===

During his mandate Martin vocally campaigned for transparency and against lobbying. Starting in 2011 he collected and published all lobby invitations his office received and in 2013 published an analysis. In total Martin collected more than 1400 &quot;lobby attempts&quot; during the two-year timespan and published a summary table ordered by category. Among examples of extraordinary lobbying Martin listed were all-inclusive travels to Azerbaijan, China and Switzerland as well as free conference invitations to Cyprus and London. He estimated the value of the two years of lobbying to be up to 65,000 Euro.

<text>Olive Marie Osmond (born October 13, 1959) is an American singer, actress, television personality, author, and businesswoman. She is known for her girl-next-door image and her decades-long career in many different areas. Her musical career, primarily focused on country music, included a large number of chart singles with four reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts. Her 1973 cover of &quot;Paper Roses,&quot; released when she was 14, made her the youngest female act with a number-one country single. Between 1985 and 1986, she also had number-one country singles with &quot;Meet Me in Montana,&quot; &quot;There&#x27;s No Stopping Your Heart,&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Still New to Me.&quot; As a television personality, she has been a host of &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; (alongside brother Donny Osmond) and on &quot;The Talk&quot;. Her acting career includes appearances in television films and Broadway musicals; she has also written several books and helped found the Children&#x27;s Miracle Network.

The eighth of nine children in the Osmond family, she made her television debut on &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;. At age 13, she established a career as a country recording artist. She began recording alongside her brother Donny, leading to the creation of their own syndicated variety show, which aired through 1979. In the early 1980s, the Osmond family lost most of its fortune, and Marie performed alongside her siblings. She also attempted to launch an acting career, experimenting with the variety show &quot;Marie&quot;. She then refocused her attention on the country genre and signed a contract with Capitol Records in 1985. Between 1985 and 1990, she had three number-one singles and released several albums, including &quot;There&#x27;s No Stopping Your Heart&quot; (1985).

In the 1990s, Osmond established her own collection of dolls, which the QVC network sold. She made her Broadway debut in &quot;The King and I&quot; in 1994. Between 1998 and 2000, she reunited professionally with Donny for the network talk show &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot;. During this period, she publicly spoke about her struggles with postpartum depression, later the focus of her book &quot;Behind the Smile: My Journey Out of Postpartum Depression&quot;. In 2004, she hosted her own radio series, entitled &quot;Marie &amp; Friends&quot; and, in 2007, appeared in a season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

She and Donny reunited their act between 2008 and 2019 for a residency at the Flamingo hotel in Las Vegas. The show later produced an album of their duets in 2009. In 2010, she returned with the solo studio album &quot;I Can Do This&quot;. In 2016, her country album &quot;Music Is Medicine&quot; followed and then, in 2021, came her classical album, &quot;Unexpected&quot;. Osmond also co-hosted &quot;The Talk&quot; between 2019 and 2020. And she appeared in several Lifetime television films, such as &quot;The Christmas Edition&quot; in 2020.

==Childhood==
Olive Marie Osmond was born October 13, 1959, in Ogden, Utah. She was the eighth of nine children (and only daughter) born to Olive May and George Virl Osmond. Her brothers are Virl, Tom, Alan, Wayne, Merrill, Jay, Donny and Jimmy Osmond. She was raised as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Virl and Tom were both born deaf. Her remaining brothers began performing from an early age as a barbershop quartet and eventually found success on &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot; in the 1960s. Her brothers&#x27; success prompted the family to move to Los Angeles. In 1964, when Marie was four years old, she made her first televised appearance on &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;.

Most of Marie&#x27;s childhood was spent at home with her mother, along with Virl, Tom, Donny, and Jimmy. Marie was closest to Donny during their childhood, and the pair often played together. &quot;Donny and I were rambunctious playmates, who never gave our mother a moment to rest,&quot; Osmond recounted in her book &quot;Behind the Smile: My Journey Out of Postpartum Depression&quot;. She also accompanied her brothers to concerts in her early childhood, often helping organize stage equipment and wardrobes. When the family was home, they spent much of their free time singing and harmonizing with each other. &quot;I never knew a day of my childhood life where music wasn&#x27;t being played, practiced, written, or sung,&quot; she recalled in 2009.

== Music career ==
===1973–1979: Teenage country music success and collaborations with Donny===
By 1970, her brothers had formed their own group, The Osmonds. During this period, they rose to commercial stardom with a series of successful pop singles. It was then suggested that Marie could have her own music career. She chose to market herself as a country music artist, explaining that it was the only genre that allowed women to have a family and career. As a preteen, she recorded a demo tape, singing Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;Coat of Many Colors.&quot; Subsequently, Don Ovens of MGM Records heard it; impressed by her singing, he signed her to a solo recording contract with the label&#x27;s Nashville division.
Ovens convinced country artist Sonny James to produce her first recording session. In June 1973, Osmond and her mother flew to Nashville, Tennessee where she recorded nine previously-memorized songs. Among the tracks was &quot;Paper Roses,&quot; which would be released as her debut single in August 1973. The song later reached the number-one spot on both the US country songs chart and the Canadian country tracks chart. The song also crossed over to the US Hot 100, peaking at number five and went to number two in the United Kingdom. Osmond&#x27;s debut studio album was released in September 1973 and topped the US country albums chart. At 14 years old, she became the youngest female country artist whose debut single hit number one in the US.

In 1974, Osmond&#x27;s next solo single &quot;In My Little Corner of the World&quot; became a top-40 US country single. Then, in 1975, her &quot;Who&#x27;s Sorry Now&quot; became a top-40 pop single in the US and Canada. Two corresponding studio albums, named after Osmond&#x27;s follow-up singles, rose to the US country chart in 1974 and 1975, respectively.

By the early 1970s, Donny had established his own recording career, apart from his brothers&#x27; group. In 1974, he was in the studio recording the song &quot;I&#x27;m Leaving It All Up to You,&quot; but was having difficulty hitting its high notes. After Marie came in to sing harmony, the song began to launch the siblings&#x27; collaborative recording career. With both receiving credit, the track reached number four on the US Hot 100, while reaching the top five in Canada, The Netherlands, Ireland, and the UK. An album of the same name sold over 500,000 copies in the US and produced another international top-ten single, &quot;Morning Side of the Mountain.&quot; As a duo, Donny and Marie had five more US top 40 singles through 1978: &quot;Deep Purple,&quot; &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing Like the Real Thing,&quot; &quot;(You&#x27;re My) Soul and Inspiration,&quot; and &quot;On the Shelf.&quot;

From 1976 to 1979, the siblings hosted their own network variety show called &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot;. The duo released three more studio albums with MGM during the show&#x27;s run: &quot;Featuring Songs from Their Television Show&quot; (1976), &quot;New Season&quot; (1976), and &quot;Winning Combination&quot;. Both of their 1976 studio albums certified as gold in the US after each had sold 500,000 copies. In 1977, Rick Hall produced Marie&#x27;s next solo album, entitled &quot;This Is the Way That I Feel&quot;. Unlike her previous releases, it was collection of pop songs. Released on Polydor Records, &quot;This Is the Way That I Feel&quot; peaked at number 152 in the US and its title track reached number 39 on the US Hot 100.

===1985–1995: Country music comeback in adulthood===
Osmond returned to country music in the 1980s. She was signed to Capitol Records by Nashville label-head Jim Foglesong. Foglesong paired her with Dan Seals to record the duet &quot;Meet Me in Montana&quot;. Released as a single in 1985, it became Osmond&#x27;s second number one single on the US country chart, and reached number 19 on Canada&#x27;s country chart. Additionally, the song won the Vocal Duo of the Year accolade at the Country Music Association Awards. &quot;Meet Me in Montana&quot; was included on Osmond&#x27;s first Capitol album &quot;There&#x27;s No Stopping Your Heart&quot; (1985). The album was praised by critics who found her well-suited to singing country pop material. The disc&#x27;s title track was chosen as the album&#x27;s second single and ultimately became her first solo single since &quot;Paper Roses&quot; to reach number one on the US and Canadian country charts. Its third single &quot;Read My Lips&quot; reached the US and Canadian country top five in 1986.
In 1986, Osmond was nominated by the Academy of Country Music for Top Female Vocalist and by the Grammy Awards for her her duet with Dan Seals. Osmond, her husband and children then moved to Nashville to further her country career. Along with her four children, Osmond traveled the United States on a tour bus doing hundreds of shows a year. &quot;It was a pretty good life, as long as you didn&#x27;t mind scraping cow pie off your shoes once in a while,&quot; she later wrote in her 2009 memoir.

Capitol released Osmond&#x27;s next album in August 1986 &quot;I Only Wanted You&quot;. The disc was her second produced with Paul Worley in Nashville. &quot;Billboard&quot; praised its country pop production calling it &quot;glowing&quot;. Along with her previous project, &quot;I Only Wanted You&quot; made the top 20 of the US country albums chart. The album featured a duet with Paul Davis called &quot;You&#x27;re Still New to Me&quot;. Although Davis had pitched her the song, it was Osmond&#x27;s idea to record it as a duet with him. Released as a single, the Osmond-Davis duet topped the US and Canadian country charts in 1986. The album&#x27;s title track was spawned as the disc&#x27;s second single and reached the top 20 on both nation&#x27;s country charts in 1987.

In July 1988, Osmond&#x27;s next Capitol studio album &quot;All in Love&quot; was released. The disc&#x27;s production was described by critics as &quot;excessively sweet&quot; and &quot;slick&quot;. It reached the top 30 of the US country albums chart. Its three singles reached positions outside the US and Canadian country top 40: &quot;Without a Trace&quot;, &quot;Sweet Life&quot; (another duet with Paul Davis) and &quot;I&#x27;m in Love and He&#x27;s in Dallas&quot;. Her final Capitol studio album was 1989&#x27;s &quot;Steppin&#x27; Stone&quot;, which reached the US country albums top 70. Critics took notice of the album&#x27;s traditional country production compared to her previous projects. Similar to her previous release, all three of its singles (the title track, &quot;Slowly But Surely&quot;, &quot;Let Me Be the First&quot;) failed to peak in positions inside the US and Canadian country top 40.

In 1990, Curb Records released Osmond&#x27;s first compilation of greatest hits under the title &quot;The Best of Marie Osmond&quot;. The album contained some new recordings, one of which was the single &quot;Like a Hurricane&quot;. It reached number 57 on the US country songs chart in 1990. Another new track was a re-recording of &quot;Paper Roses&quot;, which Osmond remade due to the copyright challenges with including the original. Osmond brought in the song&#x27;s original producer (Sonny James) and several of the original studio musicians to re-make the track. In 1995, Osmond returned to the US country charts with the new Curb single &quot;What Kind of Man (Walks on a Woman)&quot;. Two previews of songs from an anticipated album were included in the single&#x27;s release. However, Osmond ultimately chose to make a career change finding it challenging to balance family life with touring.

===2008–present: Las Vegas residency and return to music===

In 2008, Donny and Marie agreed to a six-week run at the Flamingo hotel in Las Vegas. The success of the show led to several extensions which ultimately turned into an 11-year residency through 2019. The show had a total of 1730 performances, the most of any singing act in Las Vegas history. The duo earned three of the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot;″s Best of Las Vegas Awards in 2012 including &quot;Best Show&quot;, &quot;Best All-Around Performer&quot; (Donny &amp; Marie), and &quot;Best Singer&quot;. The Vegas show was briefly moved to Caesars Atlantic City for a residency in August 2014. The show ran for two weeks in August 2014. A new studio album by the duo titled &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; was released by MPCA in May 2011. It featured both covers and new material. The album reached the top 30 in the US and number 41 in the UK.

As solo artist, Osmond&#x27;s first studio album in nearly 20 years was released in 2007 titled &quot;Magic of Christmas&quot;. It was followed by &quot;I Can Do This&quot; in 2010, which featured hymns and spiritual material. It reached number 71 in the US. Following this, Osmond decided that she no longer wanted to record music. However, an instinctual revelation prompted her to return to it. &quot;There was this voice saying ‘Marie, you should never let age define your music&#x27;,&quot; she told &quot;Sounds Like Nashville&quot;. In 2016, Osmond released her tenth studio album &quot;Music Is Medicine&quot;. It was her first studio album of country music since 1989&#x27;s &quot;Steppin&#x27; Stone&quot;. Produced by Jason Deere, the project featured collaborations with Olivia Newton-John, Sisqo and Marty Ro (of Diamond Rio). &quot;Music Is Medicine&quot; reached number ten on the US country chart, becoming Osmond&#x27;s first solo album since &quot;Paper Roses&quot; to make the top ten list. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated the album three out of five stars and concluded, &quot;Despite the ambitious cast of characters, it&#x27;s music that&#x27;s meant to soothe and comfort old friends, and it certainly succeeds in that regard.&quot;

In 2021, Osmond&#x27;s next studio album was released titled &quot;Unexpected&quot;. The project was a collection of operatic and traditional pop music. Although fearful about recording an album of material outside her comfort zone, Osmond decided to &quot;not be afraid of a new door opening&quot;. The album featured the Prague Symphony Orchestra and included a cover of &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot;, a song she had been performing on stage for years. Other tracks included show tunes like &quot;Climb Ev&#x27;ry Mountain&quot; and &quot;On My Own&quot;. Upon its release, &quot;Unexpected&quot; peaked at number six on the US classical albums chart and number one on the US classical crossover albums chart.

===Voice and musical style===
Osmond has a soprano vocal range. This was not discovered until she performed on Broadway in the 1990s and a vocal coach believed she could sing higher than she was aware of. Osmond&#x27;s music has been classified in the genres of country pop, pop, classical and opera. In describing her wide range of musical styles, &quot;The Blade&quot; wrote, &quot;To hear Marie Osmond’s voice is to hear more than a half century of American pop culture history.&quot; In describing the country pop era of her career, writers Robert K. Oermann and Mary A. Bufwack wrote, &quot;Like the other country-pop crossover queens of her era, Marie had a patriotic, high-energy fashion conscious concert act that matched her upbeat pop-flavored tunes.&quot; When explaining her own musical styles, Osmond said, &quot;Yes, I’m country; that’s what I chose to be, but it was very easy for me to sing pop because my brothers did. But as I have grown and I did Broadway and all different kinds of things, I fell in love with that style.&quot;

==Acting, radio, and television career==
===1976–1986: &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; and television breakthrough===

In 1976, programmer Fred Silverman offered Donny and Marie their own television variety series after seeing them perform on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;. The resulting show titled &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; aired on ABC beginning the same year. It was produced by Sid and Marty Krofft. The show brought in an estimated 14 million viewers. On the program, the sibling duo sang and performed comedy sketches. The duo performed together, separately and with guest performers. Notably, the show also featured the Osmond brothers. The pair became known for one of the show&#x27;s songs which featured the line, &quot;I&#x27;m a little bit country and I&#x27;m a little bit rock and roll&quot;.

The &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; show was considered by writers to showcase the siblings&#x27; &quot;squeaky clean&quot; and &quot;family friendly&quot; image. The siblings often worked 18-hour days learning scripts, changing into costumes and practicing choreography. Marie continued her schooling and was tutored on-set for three hours daily while also being expected to complete chores while she was home. Weighing 110 pounds, Marie was told by a producer to lose ten pounds or &quot;the entire show would be canceled&quot;. Following the statement, her weight dropped to 93 pounds and she struggled to stay awake during rehearsals. Osmond continued to perform on the show, citing her responsibility to her family and her audience. &quot;Donny and &amp; Marie&quot; was later re-titled to &quot;The Osmond Family Hour&quot; and was canceled in May 1979.

In 1978, Donny and Marie debuted in their first feature film titled &quot;Goin&#x27; Coconuts&quot;. The film told the story of two siblings who are put in the center of criminal activity between two gangs while at a concert in Hawaii. The film was considered a commercial failure at the box office when it was released in 1978. Later that year, Marie appeared in the ABC television film &quot;The Gift of Love&quot;, which was based on the O. Henry story &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot;. The film told the story of a newlywed couple and starred opposite Timothy Bottoms.

In the late 1970s, Marie was considered for the role of Sandy in the film version of &quot;Grease&quot;, later explaining that the original character was &quot;not a nice girl&quot; and &quot;a lot edgier&quot;. In 1978, Osmond starred in a sitcom pilot titled &quot;Marie&quot;. Although originally made for ABC, it did not make the new season schedule. Between 1980 and 1981, Osmond briefly had her own variety show titled &quot;Marie&quot;. In the early 1980s, Osmond made acting appearances in more television films including &quot;I Married Wyatt Earp&quot; and &quot;Rooster&quot;. In 1984, she voiced the role of The Nursery Magic Fairy/Velveteen Rabbit in &quot;The Velveteen Rabbit&quot;. In 1982, she played her mother Olive in the television movie &quot;Side by Side: The True Story of the Osmond Family&quot;. She then hosted the television program &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; in 1985.

===1994–2009: Broadway and return to television===
Osmond focused her attention towards her recording career in the 1980s. She returned to acting in the 1990s when her touring schedule allowed her less time with her children. &quot;I knew that I never wanted to have to choose between a child who needed me and a concert performance ever again. It was all the motivation I needed to make a life and a career change,&quot; she wrote in 2009. Manager Karl Engemann arranged for Osmond to meet with the creators of a new touring production of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. The creators gave her more freedom to balance her family life and her career. Ultimately, she agreed to the lead role of Maria von Trapp. She worked alongside vocal coach Barbara Smith Davis to retrain her voice for the role. Between 1994 and 1995, she toured in the show&#x27;s traveling production throughout the United States. &quot;Variety&quot; praised her performance, commenting, &quot;Forget the misleadingly sappy posters: she is a more interesting Maria than that.&quot; In 1997, Osmond starred as Anna Leonowens in &quot;The King and I&quot;. It was her debut performance on New York&#x27;s Broadway stage. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found Osmond&#x27;s to be an &quot;adequate Anna&quot; but found &quot;she falters in important ways&quot;. Meanwhile &quot;Variety&quot; praised her vocal performance, writing, &quot;Osmond&#x27;s soprano has developed into a fine instrument&quot;.
In the middle 1990s, Osmond returned to television. In 1995, she starred as Julia Wallace in the ABC sitcom &quot;Maybe This Time&quot;. Osmond played a divorced mother who was also balancing an entertainment career. The show also featured Betty White who played the role of her mother. After 18 episodes, the show was cancelled in February 1996. She was then approached by Dick Clark to re-launch the original &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; television program as a talk show. Although hesitant to work with her brother again, she ultimately agreed. Along with her husband and children, she moved to Los Angeles and she began filming the program. In September 1998, &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; was launched on daytime television. &quot;Donny and Marie Osmond don’t seem much different from their days as the clean-cut teenage siblings on the ‘70s ABC musical-variety series, &#x27;Donny and Marie&#x27;,&quot; wrote Susan King of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. The duo taped one-hour programs six times a week, with six segments in each program. After two seasons, the talk show was canceled due to &quot;poor ratings&quot;.

In 1999, Donny and Marie co-hosted the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City, New Jersey. From co-hosting, she became the first female host to announce the winner of the pageant. In 2004, Osmond hosted a five-hour radio show on the weekdays titled &quot;Marie and Friends&quot;. The show included conversations with guests and played current adult contemporary music. Primarily the show was geared towards women, with Osmond commenting, &quot;I&#x27;m looking forward to healthy adult conversation with women my own age!&quot; The show was aired in the mid-western and western United States, primarily in Utah, Idaho, Washington state and California.

In 2006, Osmond was cast as a judge on the Simon Cowell-created television competition &quot;Celebrity Duets&quot;. The show paired non-singing celebrities with professional musicians for duet performances. &quot;Marie Osmond acting as a cogent adviser is about the most impressive element in &#x27;Celebrity Duets&#x27;,&quot; wrote Phil Gallo of &quot;Variety&quot;. The same year it was reported by &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; magazine that she would join the cast of &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; soap opera but scheduling conflicts prevented this from happening at the time.

In August 2007, Osmond was cast on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; alongside Jane Seymour and Wayne Newton. The ballroom dancing program paired celebrities with professional dancers for weekly live competitions. In her 2009 autobiography, Osmond wrote that she &quot;didn&#x27;t know how to dance&quot; and at one point had to &quot;crawl up the stairs&quot; to her bedroom because her muscles were so sore following rehearsals. Two months into the show, she began experiencing breathing difficulties and fainted on air during an episode. She was medically evaluated and was reportedly &quot;fine&quot; following the collapse. She continued performing on the show until being eliminated in November 2007. She ultimately placed in third. In 2009, Osmond was given the opportunity to host her own talk show but due to economic challenges in the US at the time, the show was not aired.

===2010–present: &quot;Marie&quot;, &quot;The Talk&quot; and further television roles===
The Donny and Marie duo produced a holiday musical called &quot;Donny &amp; MarieA Broadway Christmas&quot;, which was originally scheduled to play on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre from December 9–19, 2010. The show was then extended through December 30, 2010, and again to January 2, 2011.

In the early 2010s, Emmy Awards producer David McKenzie re-approached Osmond about hosting her own talk show. She agreed and in 2012, it was announced that she would have her own talk show on the Hallmark Channel titled &quot;Marie&quot;. The program replaced &quot;The Martha Stewart Show&quot; which ran during the same time of the day. Osmond&#x27;s program featured guests who discussed social issues and provided lifestyle advice. Specifically, the talk show featured Osmond performing, along with specific advice on cooking and fashion. The show debuted in late 2012 featuring Betty White as her first guest. &quot;She’s nothing but a cordial host, as if she was speaking and entertaining her guests – and her viewers – in the intimacy of her own home,&quot; wrote &quot;Media Village&quot;. In 2013, Hallmark cancelled the show after one season of being aired, stating that the channel already had too many talk show offerings. A proposal to air the talk show on another network was in the works.

After leaving the Hallmark Channel, Osmond became a regular fill-in co-host on the CBS daytime show &quot;The Talk&quot;. She guest-hosted for a total of 40 times. She was then approached by the head of CBS daytime television to become an official co-host. In 2019, Osmond was announced as the official replacement for Sara Gilbert on &quot;The Talk&quot;, co-hosting alongside Sheryl Underwood, Carrie Ann Inaba, Sharon Osbourne and Eve. &quot;I am thrilled to now call this my day job,&quot; she told &quot;People&quot; magazine. In September 2020, Osmond departed the show after one season, citing a focus on family and other television opportunities. Osmond left at the same time that producer John Redmann departed the show and it was announced that the pair would collaborate in other television opportunities.

Following her departure, Osmond acted in several television films. In 2019, she played Cassie, a Nashville singer, in the Lifetime film &quot;The Road Home for Christmas&quot;. Her co-stars included Rob Mayes and Marla Sokoloff. In 2020, she co-starred in a second Lifetime television film with Carly Hughes called &quot;The Christmas Edition&quot;. In 2021, Osmond co-starred in a third Lifetime television film titled &quot;A Fiancé for Christmas&quot;, which told the story of a single woman who makes a fake wedding registry and ultimately finds love in unexpected places. &quot;The Digital Journal&quot; praised Osmond&#x27;s performance as the character of Margaret, calling her &quot;fabulous&quot;. The same year, Osmond appeared on an episode of &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; as Shaye Fury, a fictional country singer. In 2023, she made an appearance on the show &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;.

==Business career==
===Children&#x27;s Miracle Network===
Osmond was inspired to help sick children after watching how her deaf siblings struggled learning to speak and communicate. Her parents also encouraged her to help support individuals in need. &quot;My parents strongly believed that philanthropy was not only something we could do in our spare time but something that was to be part of our weekly schedule,&quot; she recalled. In 1981, Osmond and her brothers were hosting actor John Schneider at their home. Both Schneider and Osmond had a passion for helping sick children. The result was the pair co-founding the Children&#x27;s Miracle Network Hospitals. The organization provides funds to sick children and their donations are given to hospitals across the country. Since its creation, the organization has been said to have raised $7 billion dollars for children. Osmond has collaborated and met with hundreds of families since its creation and is part of the program&#x27;s annual broadcast to raise funds. &quot;I’m grateful that Children’s Miracle Network has given families access to financial and emotional support, technology, and the best research available, so they don’t have to figure it out on their own the way my mother did,&quot; she wrote in 2009.

===Doll business===
Osmond and her mother started collecting dolls as a young child. In each city her family would tour in, they would purchase a doll as a souvenir. During her free time, Osmond started sculpting her own dolls in adulthood. Ultimately, it turned into a business in 1990 titled Marie Osmond Fine Porcelain Dolls. Osmond&#x27;s dolls were also sold at Wal-Mart retailers starting at $29. Other dolls were sold in prices between $65 and $2000. She also debuted her doll collection on the QVC network during this period. Among her most notable was the Olive May doll, based on her own mother. The doll later set a collectible record on QVC, selling three million dolls in less than 15 minutes. A total of 40 dolls in six different series comprised the original porcelain collection. They were titled: Victoriana Collection, Classic Reproductions, Children of the World, Children of All Ages and Miracle Children (in reference to Children&#x27;s Miracle Network). In 2001, Osmond claimed that she had designed an estimated 550 different dolls. According to her official website, Osmond is now &quot;retired&quot; from the doll-making industry.

===Nutrisystem===
In the 2000s, Osmond had gained roughly 40 pounds (18 kg). When her mother suffered a stroke, she told her daughter, &quot;Marie, don&#x27;t do what I did. Take care of yourself.&quot; In 2007, she chose to make a change to her lifestyle and physical wellness after her children became increasingly worried about her weight. &quot;If I didn&#x27;t feel a sense of urgency to do something for myself, I need to do it for my own children,&quot; she wrote in her autobiography. The same year, Osmond found the Nutrisystem program and she lost a total of 50 pounds (23 kg). She reportedly went from being a size 14 to a size four. Osmond then became a spokesperson for the brand shortly after losing the weight. On Nutrisystems&#x27;s official website, Osmond is listed under their category labeled &quot;success stories&quot; where she explains her journey with the program. She has since created a program through the company called &quot;Complete 50&quot; for women age 50 and older.

==Writing career==
Osmond is the author of four books, three of which have made The New York Times Best Seller list. Her first was 2001&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Smile: My Journey Out of Postpartum Depression&quot;. It was co-written with Marcia Wilkie and Osmond&#x27;s physician Dr. Judith Moore. The book described how Osmond suffered from postpartum depression following the birth of her child in the late 1990s. Her hope was that giving voice to postpartum depression would inspire other women take action of their own mental health. &quot;Ability&quot; magazine positively remarked that the book &quot;candidly discloses her experience&quot; with postpartum depression. The book made Osmond the first celebrity to speak openly about postpartum depression.

Osmond and Marcia Wilkie then co-authored a second book in 2009 titled &quot;Might as Well Laugh About It Now&quot;. The memoir discussed highlights and memories from her life. &quot;I really wanted to put some things down that were really meaningful to me. It’s really about attitude ... you can either let life get you down or you can laugh about it,&quot; she told the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot;. Along with positive memories, Osmond also described some challenging points in her life. &quot;Deseret News&quot; called the book both &quot;funny&quot; and &quot;moving&quot;. &quot;The book is easy to read and is written in a conversational tone that makes the reader feel as though Osmond is a friend retelling stories from her life instead of a distant celebrity,&quot; highlighted Emiley Morgan.

Osmond wrote two books in the 2010s decade. In 2010, she penned a book of handcrafted project designs called &quot;Marie Osmond&#x27;s Heartfelt Giving: Sew and Quilt for Family and Friends&quot;, (Martingale &amp; Company). The &quot;how-to&quot; book gave step-by-step instructions of crafts people can make using a sewing machine. In 2013, Osmond&#x27;s third book was released titled &quot;The Key Is Love&quot;. The book consisted of anecdotes from her personal life, many of which circled back to her own mother. Osmond notably talked about her son&#x27;s death in the book.

==Public image==
Along with her siblings, Osmond&#x27;s public image has been described as being &quot;squeaky clean&quot;. She has also been described as the &quot;girl next door&quot;. When describing her image, the &quot;News &amp; Record&quot; wrote, &quot;Maybe Marie Osmond needs to get in a brawl in a cool L.A. club, snatch up a Sharon Stone-type film role or start hanging out with Madonna in Miami.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; explained that the Osmond family were &quot;squeaky-clean Mormons who, by all accounts, never indulged in the better-known temptations of showbiz.&quot; At one point, she was offered $5 million to appear in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. But she declined, later saying, &quot;I could have used [the money]. I wouldn&#x27;t want to see my mom like that, and I really wanted to be a mom.&quot; In describing her own public image, Osmond commented, &quot;Those people [reviewers] probably still see a naive little girl in their minds. I have to laugh at people like that because you cannot grow up in the business and not see everything and then some. The reviewers can stay back in that time, but I&#x27;m moving forward.&quot;

==Personal life==
===Relationships, marriages, and children===
Before marrying, Osmond was briefly engaged to acting student Jeff Crayton in May 1979. However, they broke their engagement two months later. She also dated singer Andy Gibb around the same time. In 1981, she briefly dated John Schneider.

Osmond has been married three times, including twice to the same spouse. In 1982, she wed her first husband, Steve Craig, then a basketball player for Brigham Young University. Their first child, Stephen James Craig, Jr., was born in 1983. The couple divorced in 1985. &quot;Steve and I had made several attempts to go back and make our very young marriage work, but it failed. I was being scrutinized in the tabloids and the paparazzi seemed to show up wherever I went. I was emotionally exhausted,&quot; she wrote in her autobiography. In 1986, she married record producer Brian Blosil in a private ceremony with her family in attendance. Osmond was drawn to Blosil&#x27;s &quot;dry sense of humor&quot; after meeting him at a family party. Osmond and Blosil had seven children, five of whom were adopted. Their two biological children are Rachael and Matthew. Their five adopted children are Jessica, Michael, Brandon, Brianna, and Abigail. After 21 years of marriage, the couple divorced in 2007. Both parties released a joint statement stating that neither one assigned fault for the divorce.

Following her second divorce, Osmond said she &quot;never wanted to be married again&quot;. Despite this, she and her former husband Steve Craig reunited after their son arranged a meeting. They rekindled their relationship and secretly dated for two years before revealing it publicly. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want anybody to get hurt, you know if it didn&#x27;t work out. And gosh, it just worked out,&quot; Osmond said. The couple remarried on May 4, 2011 in a private ceremony at the Las Vegas Mormon Temple with the bride wearing her dress from their original wedding in 1982. A few months later, the newly remarried couple attended their son&#x27;s wedding. &quot;The thing about a second marriage is that you realize things you thought were so important aren&#x27;t. I love being with my husband. He is the sweetest man I know. He lives to serve and really listens to people&#x27;s needs,&quot; she told &quot;People&quot; magazine.

Osmond&#x27;s daughter identifies as a lesbian. In a later interview, Osmond commented, &quot;I know how I love my children and I know God loves all of his children as a father. I pray for everyone to use their lives to be happy and feel accomplished. That is what this life is for.&quot;

In March 2020, Osmond stated that she will leave her fortune to charity upon her death, stating that it would be a disservice to her children to leave the money to them, and noting that they need to make their own money.

===Personal setbacks and challenges===
In 1976, Karl Engemann began managing the recording careers of Donny, Marie, Jimmy, and the Osmond Brothers group. He was appointed personal manager at various career stages of all the Osmond children three years later, and eventually only of Marie. In December 2009, Marie parted company with Karl Engemann. Osmond and her law firm wrote that Engemann made &quot;repeated defamatory and derogatory comments to third parties, multiple breaches of fiduciary duties, entering into unauthorized commitments, seeking to obtain monies outside the purview of the management agreement and other violations of his obligations.&quot;
In 1999, Osmond publicly spoke about her battle with postpartum depression after giving birth to her son Matthew. She spoke in detail about her challenges in her 2001 book &quot;Behind the Smile&quot;. In the book, she explained that it felt &quot;much darker&quot; than the baby blues and that she was &quot;fading away minute by minute&quot;. Osmond started experiencing panic attacks, fatigue, neck pain (which resulted in a hospital visit) and suicidal ideations. In one instance, she drove miles up California&#x27;s Pacific Coast Highway leaving her children in the care of two nannies, who did not know where she was going. She then received a call from her husband, who convinced her to pull off the highway and check into a hotel. She then began receiving natural healing treatments through physician Dr. Judith Moore. Osmond found that both medication and therapeutic mind-body work ultimately lifted her depression. After discussing postpartum depression on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, Osmond said that she received &quot;thousands of emails and handwritten letters&quot; from people about their own struggles with the disorder. 

Osmond also revealed in her 2001 book that she had been sexually abused in her youth, though she did not publicly disclose the identity of her abuser. She believed that the abuse later led to her struggles with postpartum depression. &quot;In my life, the normally positive quality of putting others first resulted in long-term negative effects because it was out of balance,&quot; she wrote. She later revealed that her childhood abuse also resulted in developing body dysmorphia.

In August 2006, several U.S. tabloids suggested that she had attempted suicide. Her publicity team denied it, claiming she had suffered an adverse reaction to a medication she was taking.

On February 26, 2010, Osmond&#x27;s adopted son Michael died by suicide, jumping off an eighth-floor balcony. He reportedly battled depression and addiction, and had been in rehabilitation at the age of 12. He was also bullied from a young age. Osmond wrote in her 2013 book &quot;The Key Is Love&quot; that he had been &quot;emotionally down&quot; in the weeks prior to his suicide. Osmond later revealed that she had missed a phone call from her son shortly before his death because she was onstage in Las Vegas. An autopsy found no drugs in his system. Osmond returned to work two weeks following her son&#x27;s death. &quot;The stage is my safe place. It doesn&#x27;t scare me like it scares people. And I knew if I didn&#x27;t get back onstage I may never get back onstage.&quot;

<doc id="728776" wikidata="Q46896" url="?curid=728776" title="Zlatan Ibrahimović">
<text>Zlatan Ibrahimović (born 3 October 1981) is a Swedish former professional footballer who played as a striker. Ibrahimović is known for his acrobatic strikes and volleys, technique, ball control, and physical dominance. He is regarded as one of the greatest strikers of all time and is one of the most decorated footballers in the world, having won 34 trophies in his career. He scored over 570 career goals, including more than 500 club goals, and scored in four consecutive decades between the 1990s and the 2020s.

Ibrahimović began his career at Malmö FF in 1999, and signed for Ajax two years later, where he won two Eredivisie titles and gained a reputation as one of the most promising forwards in Europe. He departed three years later to sign for Juventus before joining domestic rivals Inter Milan in 2006. At Inter Milan, he won three consecutive Serie A titles and his popularity experienced a significant increase. In the summer of 2009, he moved to Barcelona in one of the world&#x27;s most expensive transfers. After just one season, he returned to Italy, signing for Inter&#x27;s rival AC Milan. With them, he won the Serie A title in his debut season. In 2012, Ibrahimović joined Paris Saint-Germain, leading them to their first Ligue 1 title in 19 years and soon establishing himself as a leading figure in their dominance of French football. During his four-season stay in France, he won four consecutive Ligue 1 titles, numerous domestic cups, was the top scorer in Ligue 1 for three seasons and became PSG&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer at the time. In 2016, he joined Manchester United on a free transfer, winning several trophies in his only full season with the club. Ibrahimović joined American club LA Galaxy in 2018 and rejoined Milan in 2020, winning his fifth Serie A title in 2022.

Ibrahimović is one of eleven players to have made 100 or more appearances for the Swedish national team, over a 20-year international career. He is the country&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer with 62 goals. He represented Sweden at the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups, as well as the 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 UEFA European Championships. He has been awarded &quot;Guldbollen&quot; (&quot;the Golden Ball&quot;), given to the Swedish player of the year, a record 12 times, including 10 consecutive from 2007 to 2016. Ibrahimović&#x27;s 35-yard bicycle kick goal for Sweden against England won the 2013 FIFA Puskás Award and is considered one of the best goals of all time. He has scored other memorable goals, most notably in the European Championships.

Ibrahimović was named in the FIFA FIFPro World XI in 2013 and the UEFA Team of the Year in 2007, 2009, 2013, and 2014. He finished at a peak of fourth for the FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or in 2013. In 2015, UEFA included him as one of the best players that have not won the UEFA Champions League, while in 2019, &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; magazine named him the third-greatest player never to win the competition. In December 2014, Swedish newspaper &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; ranked him the second-greatest Swedish sportsperson ever, after tennis player Björn Borg. Off the field, Ibrahimović is known for his brash persona and outspoken comments, in addition to referring to himself in the third person.

==Early life==
Ibrahimović was born in Malmö, Sweden, on 3 October 1981. He was born to a Muslim Bosniak father, Šefik Ibrahimović, who emigrated to Sweden in 1977, and a Catholic Croat mother, Jurka Gravić, who also emigrated to Sweden where the couple first met. Ibrahimović identifies with his mother&#x27;s faith and considers himself a devout Catholic Christian. He began playing football at the age of six, after receiving a pair of football boots. He alternated between FBK Balkan, a Malmö club founded by Yugoslav immigrants, Malmö BI and briefly BK Flagg football clubs.

As a child, his mother sometimes hit him on the head with a wooden spoon, which would often break. After she was arrested for handling stolen goods, social services intervened. Concerned with his divorced mother&#x27;s ability to cope with five children, one of whom, Ibrahimović&#x27;s half-sister, had a drug problem, at age nine he was sent to live with his father. With food scarce at his father&#x27;s home where the fridge was packed with beer, Ibrahimović often went hungry so he would run to his mother&#x27;s for dinner. He also shoplifted and stole bikes. On the tough upbringing that shaped his character, author David Lagercrantz, who co-wrote &quot;I Am Zlatan&quot;, states:

While in his early teens, Ibrahimović was a regular for his hometown club Malmö FF. At the age of 15, he was close to quitting his football career, in favour of working at the docks in Malmö, but his manager convinced him to continue playing. As a boy, his hero was Brazilian forward Ronaldo. An avid viewer of Italian football, another player he admired was prolific striker Gabriel Batistuta – a player with similar characteristics to himself.

==Club career==
===Malmö FF===
Ibrahimović signed his first contract with Malmö in 1996, and moved up to the senior side for the 1999 season of Allsvenskan, Sweden&#x27;s top-flight league. That season, Malmö finished 13th in the league and were relegated to the second division, but returned to the top flight the next season. Arsène Wenger unsuccessfully tried to persuade Ibrahimović to join Arsenal, while Leo Beenhakker (the technical director of Ajax) also expressed interest in the player after watching him in a friendly against Norwegian side Moss FK. On 22 March 2001, a deal between Ajax and Malmö regarding Ibrahimović&#x27;s transfer to Amsterdam was announced, and in July, Ibrahimović officially joined Ajax for 80 million Swedish kronor (€8.7 million).

===Ajax===
Ibrahimović received little playing time under manager Co Adriaanse, but when Adriaanse was sacked on 29 November 2001, new coach Ronald Koeman inserted Ibrahimović into the starting lineup as Ajax won the 2001–02 Eredivisie title. The next season, Ibrahimović scored twice in a 2–1 victory over French champions Lyon in his Champions League debut on 17 September 2002. He scored five Champions League goals overall as Ajax fell to Milan in the quarter-finals.

Ibrahimović&#x27;s profile rose when he scored an individual goal against NAC Breda on 22 August 2004 – a slaloming run past five opposition players which the commentator compared with Diego Maradona and Zinedine Zidane – that was eventually voted the Goal of the Year by Eurosport viewers. On 18 August 2004, during an international match against the Netherlands, Ibrahimović injured Ajax teammate Rafael van der Vaart, who later accused Ibrahimović of hurting him intentionally.

===Juventus===
Ibrahimović moved from Ajax to Juventus for €16 million. He was promptly inserted into the starting eleven due in part to top scorer David Trezeguet&#x27;s injury problems, and scored 16 goals. The club finished top of the Serie A, and in the Champions League they reached the quarter-finals before being knocked out by eventual champions Liverpool. Near the end of the season, Juventus reportedly rejected a €70 million bid for him from Real Madrid, which was later revealed to be a publicity stunt initiated by Ibrahimović&#x27;s agent, Mino Raiola, in order to increase his market value. At the end of his first season in Italy Ibrahimović was named Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year, and in November 2005, he was awarded the &quot;Guldbollen&quot;, a prize awarded to the best Swedish footballer of the year.

The following season was poor compared to his first season; his role in Juventus&#x27; attack changed, as he became less of a goalscorer and moved more to the sidelines, taking much part in the build-up play, especially as a target player, and his assist numbers increased. In the 2005–06 season, Juventus fans often got frustrated with him due to his anonymous presence in certain important games such as the Champions League defeat to Arsenal. Juventus were stripped of their last two &quot;Scudetti&quot; as part of the verdict from the &quot;Calciopoli&quot; scandal, and were relegated to Serie B. The new staff tried to persuade Ibrahimović and other top players to stay with Juventus, but the player and his agent were adamant to move on, with Raiola threatening legal action in order to extricate Ibrahimović from his contract.

===Inter Milan===
On 10 August 2006, Ibrahimović completed a €24.8 million move to Inter Milan, signing a four-year deal. Ibrahimović said that he had supported Inter when he was young.

Ibrahimović made his debut for Inter on 26 August 2006 against Roma in the 2006 Supercoppa Italiana, playing the full 90 minutes as Inter won after extra time. He scored in his Serie A debut against Fiorentina on 9 September as Inter commenced the league with a 3–2 win at Stadio Artemio Franchi. Three days later, in his first Champions League appearance for Inter, Ibrahimović was not able to avoid the 1–0 away defeat to Sporting CP as Inter began their European campaign in the wrong way. Later, on 28 October, in his first &quot;Derby della Madonnina&quot; match against cross-town rivals Milan, Ibrahimović scored the third Inter goal of the match and also his third league goal of the season in a 4–3 thriller win. In his first season at the club, Ibrahimović top scored for Inter in Serie A with 15 goals, as the team won the &quot;Scudetto&quot; with a record 97 points.

Ibrahimović played his 100th Serie A match on 16 September 2007 at the San Siro against Catania, where he appeared as a second-half substitute for Hernán Crespo in an eventual 2–0 win. In 2007, he signed a new contract until June 2013; it was reported that this contract had made him the world&#x27;s highest paid footballer. On 18 May 2008, Ibrahimović scored both goals in a 2–0 defeat of Parma on the final day of the 2007–08 Serie A season to give Inter a second consecutive &quot;Scudetto&quot;. Overall, he scored 17 goals in 26 league matches, and was named both Serie A Footballer of the Year and Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year.

Ibrahimović started his third Inter season by winning the Supercoppa Italiana against Roma. After the regular and extra time had finished in a draw, the match went to a penalty shootout where he successfully converted his penalty attempt. He scored his team&#x27;s only goal in the 2008–09 Serie A opening match against Sampdoria, which finished in a 1–1 draw. On 4 October, during the match against Bologna at home which Inter won 2–1, Ibrahimović scored a sensational goal, stunning Francesco Antonioli with an irresistible backheeled shot from Adriano&#x27;s left-wing cross. The goal was later voted Goal of the Year in Serie A. On 19 October 2008, Ibrahimović continued with his solid performances by scoring twice in an impressive 4–0 win at Roma, taking his tally up to five league goals. He then scored another double in the Matchday 12 win against Palermo to help Inter take the lead in the Serie A table by one point. In the next fixture, Ibrahimović provided the assist on the only goal in the &quot;Derby d&#x27;Italia&quot; match against Juventus at home, helping Inter to extend their league lead.

Ibrahimović ended the 2008–09 Serie A season as the league&#x27;s top goalscorer with 25 goals,&lt;ref name=&quot;08/09 top scorer&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; helping Inter to another league title. He was also named both Footballer of the Year and Foreign Footballer of the Year for the second consecutive season.

===Barcelona===
====2009–10: La Liga title and relationship with Pep Guardiola====
After Inter teammate Maxwell completed his transfer to Barcelona, Barça president Joan Laporta confirmed that there was an agreement in principle between Barcelona and Inter for Ibrahimović to join the club in exchange for striker Samuel Eto&#x27;o, plus a reported fee of £40 million. Ibrahimović left Inter during their United States summer tour in the World Football Challenge on 23 July 2009 for negotiations with Barcelona, with his last match for Inter being against Chelsea. After Inter agreed terms with Eto&#x27;o and Barcelona with Ibrahimović, Barcelona announced Ibrahimović would arrive on 26 July 2009 and undergo a medical test on 27 July 2009.

Ibrahimović passed his medical and was presented to a crowd of over 60,000 at Camp Nou. He signed a five-year contract, for €46 million and the exchange of Eto&#x27;o (valued at €20 million) and loan of Alexander Hleb (with an option to purchase for a €10 million fee), with a €250 million release clause, making Ibrahimović worth €66 million. The Hleb deal, however, collapsed. Eventually, Ibrahimović cost Barcelona €69.884 million, which included other fees. As per the Inter book, the fee was €69.5 million, but part of the Inter fee (max 5% according to FIFA regulation) were deducted and distributed by Barcelona to youth and young professional clubs of Ibrahimović: Malmö FF and AFC Ajax as solidarity contribution.

Ibrahimović started the 2009–10 season with his competitive debut for Barcelona on 23 August 2009 by assisting a Lionel Messi goal, leading them to the Supercopa de España, beating Athletic Bilbao 5–1 on aggregate. In his next competitive match, Barcelona won the 2009 UEFA Super Cup with a 1–0 win over Shakhtar Donetsk. In his third appearance, he scored his first goal in Barcelona&#x27;s La Liga season opener against Sporting Gijón in a 3–0 win. Ibrahimović scored in his next four games, thus setting a team record as the only player ever to score in his first five league matches.

On 20 October, he scored his first Champions League goal for Barcelona in a group stage match against Rubin Kazan. Five days later, he scored twice in a 6–1 thrashing of Real Zaragoza, giving him a league-leading seven goals in seven league matches while sending Barcelona to the top of the table. On 7 November, however, he suffered a thigh injury that kept him out for three weeks. He returned to action in week 12 of the season against Real Madrid as a second-half substitute for Thierry Henry, and scored his eighth goal of the campaign. He finished with 11 goals and 4 assists in Barcelona&#x27;s first 15 league matches. Barcelona capped off 2009 by winning the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup against Estudiantes on 19 December 2009.

Ibrahimović scored Barcelona&#x27;s only goal in the 2009–10 Copa del Rey first leg match of the round of 16 in a 2–1 loss to Sevilla on 5 January 2010. On 20 January, he was selected in the 2009 UEFA Team of the Year. His first goal of 2010 came on 14 February against Atlético Madrid. In his next appearance, Ibrahimović scored against Stuttgart in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League knockout stage fixture. He was sent off on 6 March in a league match against Almería, which Barcelona appealed to no avail, and he was suspended for one game. A calf strain during warmups before the next La Liga match following his return from suspension against Athletic Bilbao ruled Ibrahimović out of the second leg 4–1 victory over Arsenal, in which he scored two goals away from home, the return leg of &quot;El Clásico&quot; against Madrid (which Barcelona won 2–0), and the next league match against Deportivo de La Coruña. He made his return as a substitute in the 82nd minute in a 0–0 away draw against Espanyol on 17 April.

Following Barcelona&#x27;s semi-final defeat to Inter Milan in the Champions League, Ibrahimović spoke of how he confronted his coach Pep Guardiola in the changing room. &quot;I yelled: &#x27;You haven&#x27;t got any balls!&#x27; and worse than that I added: &#x27;You can go to hell!&#x27; I completely lost it, and you might have expected Guardiola to say a few words in response, but he&#x27;s a spineless coward. He just [...] left, never to mention it again, not a word.&quot; He scored his final goal for Barcelona in the 2010 Supercopa de España on 14 August in a 3–1 defeat against Sevilla, and on 25 August, he played his last match for the club against Milan for the Joan Gamper Trophy, after which he claimed to the media that his relationship with Guardiola had started deteriorating and that Guardiola had not spoken to him since February. In his autobiography &quot;I Am Zlatan&quot;, he states, &quot;&#x27;It started well but then Messi started to talk. He wanted to play in the middle, not on the wing, so the system changed from 4–3–3 to 4–5–1. I was sacrificed and no longer had the freedom on the pitch I need to succeed.&quot;

====2010–11: Loan to Milan====
On 28 August 2010, AC Milan announced via their official website that they had signed Ibrahimović for the 2010–11 season. He was loaned out to Milan for the season, with the club having the option to purchase him outright for €24 million at the end of the season. He signed a four-year deal immediately after successfully passing the medical examinations. Upon signing, Ibrahimović said, &quot;This move gives me more adrenaline. I have moved here to win the Champions League with Milan. I want to win the double.&quot;

Ibrahimović made his Milan debut in a 2–0 loss to Cesena on 11 September, in which he missed a penalty late in the match, and scored his first goals for the club when Milan defeated Auxerre in their first Champions League match of the season on 15 September. On 14 November, Ibrahimović scored in a 1–0 victory against his former club Inter in the &quot;Derby della Madonnina&quot;. On 20 November, he scored his seventh goal against Fiorentina in the 45th minute with an over-the-head bicycle kick, passing Alexandre Pato as the team&#x27;s top goalscorer for the season. On 4 December 2010, in a game against Brescia, he assisted Kevin-Prince Boateng to give Milan an early lead and then scored the third goal by a powerful shot near the edge of the penalty box to give Milan a 3–0 win. On 12 December 2010, history repeated itself in the game against Bologna after he assisted Boateng to give Milan an early lead once again and scoring later that match to make it 3–0, leading him to 13 goals with 8 assists in 21 matches in all competitions. Within days of the match, he was compared to Milan legend Marco van Basten by both the media and Van Basten himself.

Ibrahimović received a three-match ban after being shown a red card in a 1–1 home draw against Bari in March 2011 for punching Bari defender Marco Rossi in the stomach. An additional three-match ban was given to Ibrahimović in February 2012 in a 2–1 home defeat against Fiorentina for swearing at an assistant referee. Ibrahimović stated in his defence that he was talking to himself in frustration. He won his first &quot;Scudetto&quot; with Milan after a draw against Roma. All agreements between Milan and Barcelona were confirmed on 18 June 2011.

===AC Milan===
Ibrahimović started the new season on 6 August in the 2011 Supercoppa Italiana against city rivals Inter, where he scored the first goal of a 2–1 comeback victory to clinch the first trophy of the season. In the opening league match of the 2011–12 season, Ibrahimović scored Milan&#x27;s first goal of a 2–2 home draw against Lazio. He scored his first Champions League goal of the season on 28 September in a 2–0 home win against Viktoria Plzeň, which was followed by another one on 19 October against BATE Borisov in another 2–0 home win. He continued with his solid performances as he scored in a 4–1 home win against Parma and a brace in the team&#x27;s 3–2 away victory over Roma, ending a successful month of October.

November saw him score in consecutive games against BATE, in the Champions League, and Catania, in the league. Later in the month against Barcelona in another Champions League tie, Ibrahimović scored against his old club to equalise the game at 1–1. Barça eventually pulled away however with Xavi scoring the winning goal to make it 3–2 at the San Siro. He ended November with a brace against Chievo, the first of those tallies brought his Serie A career total to 100 goals. In December, Ibrahimović scored a goal in each of five Serie A games. As 2012 started, he scored against Atalanta converting a penalty kick. He was the top goalscorer of Serie A, with 14 goals in 16 appearances following a brace against Novara, of which the second goal came from a backheel. On 5 February 2012 in a match against Napoli, he was shown a red card for slapping Salvatore Aronica in an off-the-ball incident, and was given yet another three-match ban from Serie A games.

On 15 February, in the first leg of the Champions League&#x27;s round of 16, Ibrahimović set up both of Robinho&#x27;s goals and also scored by a spot kick, thus helping Milan win 4–0 over Arsenal. On 3 March, during the 4–0 away win against Palermo, Ibrahimović took the lead of the goalscorers table as he scored a first-half hat-trick to take his tally up to 17 goals. He finished the season as Serie A top scorer with 28 goals in 32 matches.

===Paris Saint-Germain===

====2012–13: First Ligue 1 title in 19 years====

On 17 July 2012, Paris Saint-Germain confirmed that they had reached an agreement to acquire the sporting and economic rights of Ibrahimović from Milan, having already agreed personal terms with the striker, for a transfer fee of €20 million. Valued at €180 million, these combined fees eclipsed those commanded by Nicolas Anelka. His three-year contract would see him receive a net annual salary of €14 million including bonuses (which would be €2 million more than what he was earning per year just before he left Milan), and make him the second best paid footballer in the world behind Samuel Eto&#x27;o.

The following day, Ibrahimović signed the contract and made the following statement during the press conference: &quot;It is a big step in my career and another dream come true. I am very happy because it is a project that I want to be involved in. I want to be part of the history of the club. I am here to win and nothing else.&quot; Ibrahimović scored twice in the second half for PSG to help them rally from 2–0 down at half-time to salvage a 2–2 home draw with Lorient in their opening 2012–13 Ligue 1 match. He scored two goals in the first half to help PSG to a 2–1 win over Lille which was PSG&#x27;s first Ligue 1 win after three successive draws in the first three league matches of the 2012–13 season.

In the opening 2012–13 Champions League Group A match against Dynamo Kyiv on 18 September 2012, Ibrahimović scored his sixth goal in only his fifth appearance for Carlo Ancelotti&#x27;s side through a penalty. He thus became the first man to score for six clubs in the UEFA Champions League. On 8 October, Ibrahimović became only the third player (after Ronaldinho and Laurent Blanc) to have played in &quot;El Clásico&quot; in Spain, the &quot;Derby della Madonnina&quot; in Italy and &quot;Le Classique&quot;, the derby between Marseille and PSG. He scored both of PSG&#x27;s goals (the first goal was from a backheel and the second was from a free kick) in the Ligue 1 &quot;Classique&quot; derby at the Stade Vélodrome on that day, with the match finishing 2–2. On 11 December 2012, he scored a hat-trick in a 4–0 away win against Valenciennes.

In January 2013, Ibrahimović was handed the number 10 jersey after the departure of Brazilian winger Nenê. In April 2013, Ibrahimović scored in a 2–2 draw against his former club Barcelona in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. PSG, however, were knocked out on away goals after drawing 1–1 at Camp Nou in the second leg. He ended the season as the assists leader in the 2012–13 Champions League, providing seven assists. On 12 May 2013, Paris Saint-Germain won the Ligue 1 title after a 1–0 away win against Lyon, their third title and first since 1994. He ended the year as Ligue 1&#x27;s top goalscorer with 30 goals, becoming the first player to reach that mark in the French top flight since Jean-Pierre Papin in the 1989–90 season. On 20 May, he was named as Ligue 1&#x27;s Player of the Year by the Union nationale des footballeurs professionnels (UNFP).

====2013–14: Back-to-back league top goalscorer and second Ligue 1 title====
Ibrahimović netted his first goal of the season on 31 August 2013, scoring deep into stoppage time as PSG recorded a 2–0 victory over Guingamp. On 24 September, it was announced that Ibrahimović had extended his contract with PSG, which would see him stay at the club until 2016. A week later on 2 October, the Swede scored twice as PSG ran out 3–0 winners over Benfica in a Champions League group match. On 19 October, he scored two goals in PSG&#x27;s 4–0 win over Bastia, one an audacious volleyed back heel as he reached behind the defender to fire the ball into the net. The goal was later named as Ligue 1&#x27;s Goal of the Season, as chosen by the public. Four days later, Ibrahimović scored four goals in PSG&#x27;s 5–0 away win against RSC Anderlecht in the Champions League; he scored the eighth-fastest hat-trick in the competition&#x27;s history (completed in 19 minutes which included a bending 30-yard half-volley clocked at 93 miles per hour), and became the 11th player to score four times or more in a Champions League match.

On 27 November, Ibrahimović made his 100th UEFA Champions League appearance, scoring the opening goal in a 2–1 win over Olympiacos at the Parc des Princes. On 16 March 2014, Ibrahimović scored both goals in a 2–0 win over Saint-Étienne to surpass Carlos Bianchi&#x27;s club record of 39 goals in a season. On 11 May, he was named Ligue 1&#x27;s Player of the Year for the second consecutive season. Ibrahimović ended the Ligue 1 season as top scorer with 26 goals as PSG won a second consecutive league title. Overall, he scored 41 goals in all competitions, including ten in eight Champions League matches.

====2014–15: Domestic quadruple and all-time second top scorer====

Ibrahimović scored his first two goals for Paris Saint Germain on 2 August 2014 against Guingamp in the 2014 Trophée des Champions, winning his first silverware of the season. In the first league match of the season, Ibrahimović scored twice but also missed an open net and had a penalty saved as PSG drew 2–2 with Reims. Ibrahimović scored his first league hat-trick of the season in a match against Saint-Étienne on 31 August. In the quarter-finals of the Coupe de la Ligue on 13 January 2015, Ibrahimović scored the only goal to win away at Saint-Étienne. The home team argued that the ball had not crossed the line, and fans threw objects onto the pitch, disrupting play for ten minutes.

On 11 March, Ibrahimović received a straight red card in a Champions League round of 16 match against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, for a foul on Oscar. PSG drew 2–2 after extra time to qualify for the quarter-finals on away goals. Nine days later, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 win over Lorient at the Parc des Princes. He netted another hat-trick on 8 April as PSG reached the 2015 Coupe de France Final with a 4–1 win over Saint-Étienne, starting with a penalty for his 100th goal for the club. He ended the match with 102 career goals for PSG, second only to Pauleta. Three days later, he scored twice as PSG defeated Bastia 4–0 in the 2015 Coupe de la Ligue Final. The first goal was a penalty which he won when fouled by Sébastien Squillaci, resulting in the Bastia defender&#x27;s dismissal.

====2015–16: Departure and all-time PSG top goalscorer====
On 4 October 2015, Ibrahimović scored both goals from penalty kicks in a 2–1 home win over Marseille to overtake Pauleta and become Paris Saint-Germain&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer with 110 goals in all official competitions. On 25 November, Ibrahimović captained PSG on his return to hometown club Malmö FF in the group stage of the 2015–16 Champions League. He scored the team&#x27;s third goal in a 5–0 win, a result that confirmed PSG&#x27;s qualification to the knockout stage of the competition. In scoring twice in PSG&#x27;s 3–0 win over Nice on 4 December 2015, Ibrahimović beat Mustapha Dahleb&#x27;s previous record of 85 goals to become the club&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer in the French first division. On 16 February 2016, in the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League round of 16 first leg against Chelsea at home, Ibrahimović scored the opener in the 39th minute with a free kick to help his team win 2–1. This was Ibrahimović&#x27;s 116th appearance in the Champions League, meaning that he overtook Carles Puyol to enter the competition&#x27;s all-time top ten appearance makers. Four days later, Ibrahimović netted twice during the 4–1 home win over Reims, taking his tally up to 23 league goals; he also set up the goals of Edinson Cavani and Gregory van der Wiel.

On 9 March, in the second leg of PSG&#x27;s Champions League tie with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Ibrahimović assisted a goal for Adrien Rabiot and scored the winning goal himself as Paris won the match 2–1 and progressed to the quarter-final stage with a 4–2 aggregate victory. With this goal, he became the 14th player to score 50 or more goals in UEFA club competitions. Four days later, he scored four times in a 9–0 win against bottom-placed Troyes that sealed PSG&#x27;s league title with eight games remaining; his hat-trick goal was his 100th in the league. His nine-minute hat-trick was the fastest in Ligue 1 history. Later that day, he announced he would be leaving PSG at the end of the season, while joking that only if they replaced the Eiffel Tower with a statue of himself would he stay. On 16 April, Ibrahimović scored twice in a 6–0 home win against Caen to earn him a season-best 32 goals in league; it was also his 41st goal of the season, equaling his season-best in 2013–14 season with two games less playing. Three days later, he netted the winner in the 2015–16 Coupe de France semi-final match away against Lorient to send Paris into the final for the second consecutive season; it was also his 42nd goal of the season, setting a new personal best. On 8 May 2016, Ibrahimović was named UNFP Ligue 1 Player of the Season for the third consecutive year.

Ibrahimović made his final Ligue 1 appearance for PSG against Nantes at the Parc des Princes on 14 May 2016, scoring twice in a 4–0 victory to become Paris Saint-Germain&#x27;s top scorer in a single Ligue 1 season with 38 goals, which put him one goal ahead of Carlos Bianchi, who managed 37 in the 1977–78 campaign. Ibrahimović ended the 2015–16 Ligue 1 season as its top scorer, the third time that he had done so. The league match was stopped briefly in the tenth minute as fans gave Ibrahimović – whose PSG shirt was number 10 – a standing ovation. He was also cheered just before the final whistle, holding his two sons in his arms. They had run onto the pitch moments earlier, wearing number 10 PSG shirts with either the word &quot;King&quot; or &quot;Legend&quot; written in English on the back. The names were in reference to their father&#x27;s &quot;I came like a king, left like a legend&quot; post on social media before the match. On 21 May 2016, Ibrahimović scored twice (his 155th and 156th goals in his 180th and final competitive match for the club) in the second half of the 2016 Coupe de France Final, and also set up Edinson Cavani&#x27;s goal. PSG defeated Marseille 4–2 in that match. He was substituted to a standing ovation in the final minutes of the match. PSG thus won the Ligue 1-Coupe de France-Coupe de la Ligue domestic treble for the second consecutive season, and equalled Marseille&#x27;s all-time record of ten Coupe de France titles. His record as PSG&#x27;s all-time top scorer was surpassed by his former strike partner Cavani in January 2018.

===Manchester United===
On 1 July 2016, Ibrahimović signed as a free agent for Manchester United on a one-year contract, which had the option of being extended depending on his performance for the club. His salary was reported to be £200,000 per week.

====2016–17: Europa League and League Cup double====
Ibrahimović was handed the number 9 jersey ahead of the 2016–17 season. On 7 August, Ibrahimović scored the match-winning goal for Manchester United in the 2016 FA Community Shield, rising above Wes Morgan to head past Leicester City goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel in a 2–1 victory. This was his record 10th domestic super cup, won in a fifth country. In his Premier League debut one week later, he scored with a long-range strike in the 3–1 away win at AFC Bournemouth on the opening day. On 20 August, he scored both goals; a header in the first half and a penalty in the second, to beat Southampton 2–0 on his home debut. On 6 November, he scored twice in a 3–1 away win against Swansea City; his first was the 25,000th goal in Premier League history. He was later booked, picking up his fifth yellow card of the season, ruling him out of the league game at home against Arsenal on 19 November. On 5 February 2017, Ibrahimović scored his 15th league goal of the season and 20th in all competitions in a 3–0 away win against Leicester City, becoming the oldest player to manage at least 15 goals in a single Premier League season at the age of 35 years and 125 days.
On 16 February, Ibrahimović registered his first Manchester United hat-trick in a 3–0 win over Saint-Étienne in the Europa League Round of 32. On 19 February, he made his first FA Cup appearance, coming on as a 62nd-minute substitute and scoring the winner in a 2–1 fifth round win against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. Exactly a week after his FA Cup debut, Ibrahimović scored two goals, a free-kick and a header (the winning goal), in the 2017 EFL Cup Final to clinch United&#x27;s fifth League Cup and to win his second trophy with the club. On 7 March, Ibrahimović was suspended for three matches by The Football Association for violent conduct after elbowing Bournemouth&#x27;s Tyrone Mings in a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford three days earlier. Later on 13 April, Ibrahimović was included in the six player shortlist for the PFA Player of the Year.

On 20 April, Ibrahimović sustained serious ligament damage in his right knee in a Europa League quarter-final against Anderlecht at Old Trafford. Several sources reported that the injury would sideline the player until at least the end of the 2016–17 season. Ibrahimović won his first major European title when Manchester United defeated Ajax in the Europa League Final at the Friends Arena in Stockholm, before being named in the UEFA Europa League squad of the season. At the end of the season, it was announced that Manchester United would release Ibrahimović at the end of his contract on 30 June 2017, although they later confirmed that they were in talks with Ibrahimović to re-sign him for the latter half of the 2017–18 Premier League season.

====2017–18: Final season in Manchester====
On 24 August 2017, it was announced that Ibrahimović had signed a new one-year contract with Manchester United. It was also announced that he would be wearing number 10 in his second season with the team. Ibrahimović made his return for the club on 18 November, replacing Anthony Martial as a substitute in a 4–1 home win against Newcastle United. The following week, he became the first ever player to feature for seven clubs in the Champions League when he came on as a substitute in a 1–0 loss to Basel. In his first start of the season on 20 December, Ibrahimović&#x27;s first goal of the season came as he scored a free-kick in a 2–1 loss against Bristol City in the quarter-final of the EFL Cup. On 22 March 2018, Manchester United announced that Ibrahimović had agreed to the termination of his contract.

===LA Galaxy===
On 23 March 2018, Ibrahimović signed for Major League Soccer (MLS) club LA Galaxy. He announced his arrival by taking out a signed full-page advertisement in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that simply said, &quot;Dear Los Angeles, you&#x27;re welcome&quot;.

====2018 season====
He made his debut on 31 March as a substitute against Los Angeles FC in the inaugural El Tráfico derby, where he scored twice, including a half volley and a header in stoppage time, helping the Galaxy come from three goals down to win the match 4–3. After his match-winning performance, Ibrahimović said, &quot;I heard the crowd saying &#x27;We want Zlatan, we want Zlatan&#x27;, so I gave them Zlatan.&quot; He scored twice for the Galaxy in a 3–2 defeat to FC Dallas on 30 May; he railed against his team after the match, saying &quot;Every game we shouldn&#x27;t be losing two or three goals and then you have to catch the game and try to win. This is not the game; this is absolutely not the game. Even if you are in MLS or Premier League, wherever, it doesn&#x27;t work like that. We need to be the leading team and play from there, not to catch the goal all the time, so obviously it&#x27;s not good.&quot;

Ibrahimović scored a penalty in a 4–0 win against the Columbus Crew on 8 July. He scored his 12th league goal of the season against the Philadelphia Union in a 3–1 victory on 21 July. Ibrahimović scored his first MLS hat-trick the following week in a 4–3 win against Orlando City, with his three goals inside 24 second-half minutes helping the Galaxy overcome a 1–2 deficit. On 15 September, Ibrahimović scored his 500th professional career goal for club and country with another acrobatic strike in a 5–3 away defeat against Toronto FC. Post match, Ibrahimović stated he was &quot;happy for Toronto because they&#x27;ll be remembered as my 500th victim&quot;. The goal was nominated in August 2019 for the 2019 FIFA Puskás Award for Goal of the Year. In his first year, despite the Galaxy missing out on the playoffs, Ibrahimović managed to be selected for the MLS All-Star Game and the MLS Best XI, as well as being awarded the MLS Newcomer of the Year Award and MLS Goal of the Year for his strike from distance against Los Angeles FC.

====2019 season====

Ibrahimović was named team captain ahead of the 2019 season. On 2 March 2019, he scored in the Galaxy&#x27;s opening match in a 2–1 win over the Chicago Fire. On 31 March, in his second appearance of the season, Ibrahimović scored two goals from the penalty spot, including one Panenka-style, in a 2–1 home win over the Portland Timbers. With this he reached 515 career goals, overtaking fellow countryman Gunnar Nordahl to become the Swedish player with the most goals in football history. On 20 July, Ibrahimović scored a perfect hat-trick against Los Angeles FC to win the match 3–2. This performance followed a debate on whether Ibrahimović was the best player in MLS compared to Los Angeles FC rival Carlos Vela, with Ibrahimović claiming himself the &quot;best by far&quot;. Ibrahimović scored a second hat-trick of the season on 15 September, in a 7–2 win against Sporting Kansas City. This brought his tally for 2019 to 26 goals, breaking the club record for most goals scored in a single regular season. Ibrahimović was again named both an MLS All-Star and to the Best XI for a second consecutive season.

Ibrahimović managed to lead the LA Galaxy to the 2019 MLS Cup Playoffs, where on 24 October, despite recording a goal and an assist, his side were eliminated in the Western Conference Semifinals, following a 5–3 away defeat against Los Angeles FC. On 13 November 2019, Ibrahimović announced he was to leave the LA Galaxy through his Twitter account, telling Galaxy fans &quot;[Y]ou wanted Zlatan, I gave you Zlatan. You are welcome. The story continues...Now go back to watch baseball&quot;.

===Return to AC Milan===

====2019–20: Return season====
On 27 December 2019, Ibrahimović returned to AC Milan on a free transfer on a six-month contract until the end of the season, with an option to extend his contract until the end of the 2020–21 season, subject to certain conditions. He made his first appearance since his return to the club on 6 January 2020, coming on as a substitute in a 0–0 Serie A home draw against Sampdoria at the San Siro. Ibrahimović scored his first goal for Milan since returning on 11 January, in a 2–0 away win against Cagliari. The landmark goal saw him score in each of the last four decades (1990s, 2000s, 2010s, 2020s). On 9 February, he assisted a goal and subsequently scored another for Milan in their eventual 4–2 loss against rivals Inter; as a result, he became the oldest goalscorer ever in the Derby della Madonnina at the age of 38 years and 129 days, breaking the previous record set by Swedish compatriot Nils Liedholm (aged 38 years and 43 days).

Ibrahimović made his 100th appearance for the club (including his previous stint) on 15 July 2020, in a 3–1 home league win over Parma. He became the first player to score 50 Serie A goals for both Milan clubs on 29 July, with a brace in a win over Sampdoria. On 1 August, Ibrahimović scored a goal in a 3–0 win over Cagliari, becoming the oldest player to score at least ten goals in a Serie A season since Silvio Piola with Novara in the 1950s, at the age of 38 years and 302 days. On 31 August 2020, Ibrahimović extended his contract until the summer of 2021.

====2020–21: Serie A runner-up and return to Champions League====
On 17 September 2020, Ibrahimović scored Milan&#x27;s first goal of the 2020–21 season in a 2–0 away win over Shamrock Rovers in the second qualifying round of the Europa League. Four days later, he scored a brace in Milan&#x27;s opening match of the Serie A season, a 2–0 home win over Bologna. After missing three games recovering from COVID-19, Ibrahimović returned in the Derby della Madonnina on 17 October, scoring twice in three minutes as Milan defeated Inter 2–1. He scored his third consecutive brace in the league in a 3–3 home draw to Roma on 26 October. On 22 November, Ibrahimović again scored twice in a 3–1 away win over Napoli, which was also his eighth consecutive league appearance with at least one goal. However, he also suffered a hamstring injury and had to be substituted.

Ibrahimović made his return to the side from injury on 9 January 2021, being brought on for the final five minutes of Milan&#x27;s 2–0 win against Torino. On 18 January, he scored both of his side&#x27;s goals in their 2–0 victory over Cagliari, ensuring Milan would stay three points clear at the top of the league table. Ibrahimović&#x27;s goals meant that he had managed to score in each of his last nine starts for the club. On 26 January, he was involved in a confrontation with former Manchester United teammate Romelu Lukaku in Milan&#x27;s Coppa Italia quarter-final match against Inter. Following a foul committed by Lukaku late in the first half, he and Ibrahimović exchanged insults as the pair clashed heads and had to be restrained by their respective teammates. Both players were booked as their arguments continued into the tunnel at half-time. Ibrahimović would be sent off during the second half following a second yellow for a foul on Aleksandar Kolarov, as Inter went on to record a 2–1 victory. Ibrahimović faced backlash after the match for his statements made in the confrontation, including when pitchside microphones picked up him telling Lukaku to &quot;go do your voodoo&quot; and calling him a &quot;little donkey&quot;, with an investigation by the Italian Football Federation to determine if the statements made constituted racial abuse. He denied using racist language, and though no evidence of racist intent was found, Ibrahimović was fined €4,000, and Lukaku €3,000.

Ibrahimović scored another brace in a 4–0 win over Crotone on 7 February, reaching the milestone of 500 and 501 total club career goals in the process. On 22 April, he signed a new contract extension to stay at the club for another season. On 9 May, Ibrahimović had to be substituted off in the second half of Milan&#x27;s 3–0 victory at Juventus following an injury to his left knee, which would rule him out for the remainder of the season.

====2021–2023: Serie A title and retirement====
On 12 September 2021, Ibrahimović made his first appearance for Milan since returning from injury and scored in a 2–0 win over Lazio, and in doing so, at the age of 39 years and 344 days he became the oldest non-Italian player to score a goal in the 123-year history of Serie A, breaking the record previously held by former Parma centre-back Bruno Alves. On 23 October, Ibrahimović scored Milan&#x27;s fourth in a 4–2 win over Bologna, becoming the fourth player to score a Serie A goal after his 40th birthday after Alessandro Costacurta, Silvio Piola and Pietro Vierchowod. On 20 November, he scored two goals in a 4–3 loss to Fiorentina, and in doing so, became the oldest player to score a brace in a Serie A game as well as the first 40-year-old player to net a brace in Europe&#x27;s top five leagues in the 21st century. On 11 December, Ibrahimović scored an acrobatic equaliser in stoppage-time in a 1–1 draw with Udinese, reaching the milestone of 300 career league goals across Europe&#x27;s top five leagues, thus becoming just the third person in the 21st century to achieve it after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.

On 24 April 2022, Ibrahimović set up Tonali&#x27;s 90th minute winner against Lazio, helping Milan take top spot in the league table. On 22 May, after the final match against Sassuolo, Milan won the Serie A title for the first time in 11 years, Ibrahimović also being part of their last title in 2011. He contributed with eight goals and three assists during the campaign. It was his overall 5th Serie A title (2 additional titles were revoked with Juventus), Ibrahimović dedicated the title to his agent and friend, Mino Raiola, who had died recently. Three days later, Ibrahimović revealed that he had played through an anterior cruciate ligament injury for six months during the season, for which he underwent surgical repair that day and would be off the pitch for at least seven months.

On 18 July 2022, it was announced that Ibrahimović had signed a one-year contract extension with Milan, staying for the next season. He returned to training in February 2023, but was left out of the club&#x27;s Champions League squad. Ibrahimović returned to first-team action on 26 February 2023, his first appearance in nine months, in a 2–0 victory over Atalanta. On 18 March, he became the oldest goalscorer in Serie A at the age of 41 years and 166 days when he scored in a 3–1 defeat to Udinese. On 4 June, Ibrahimović announced his retirement from football following Milan&#x27;s final game of the Serie A season.

==International career==
===Youth===
In 1999, Ibrahimović played four games and scored one goal for the Sweden U18 team. In 2001, he made his debut for the Sweden U21 team and played in two games in the 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifying campaign, including the second-leg game against Belgium in the qualification play-offs which saw Sweden eliminated from the competition. In total, Ibrahimović played seven games and scored six goals for the U21 team.

===Senior===

====Early career and 2002 FIFA World Cup====
Ibrahimović was eligible to represent Sweden, Bosnia and Herzegovina or Croatia at international level; he chose Sweden. He debuted in a goalless friendly draw against the Faroe Islands at Tipshallen on 31 January 2001 during the 2000–01 Nordic Football Championship. On 7 October 2001, he played his first competitive match, a 2002 World Cup qualifier against Azerbaijan, scoring his first ever international goal in a 3–0 win as Sweden topped their group to qualify for the upcoming tournament.

Ibrahimović was part of the Sweden squad at the 2002 FIFA World Cup held in Korea and Japan, who were eliminated at the round of 16 by newcomers Senegal. He appeared twice in the tournament, coming on as a substitute in the group stage game against Argentina and in the round of 16 match against Senegal.

====UEFA Euro 2004====

Sweden qualified for UEFA Euro 2004 as group winners, with Ibrahimović scoring three goals throughout the qualifying campaign. In Sweden&#x27;s opening group match of Euro 2004 against Bulgaria on 14 June, Ibrahimović assisted one of Freddie Ljungberg&#x27;s goals and later scored from a penalty in a 5–0 win. In the following match against Italy on 18 June, he scored an 85th-minute equaliser with a back-heel lob to seal a 1–1 draw and was named Man of the Match; the goal was later named the best goal of the tournament. Sweden and Denmark subsequently sealed a place in the knockout round on direct encounters following a 2–2 draw in their final group match, despite a three-way five-point tie with Italy, with Sweden topping the group. In the quarter-finals against the Netherlands, he missed a penalty in the resulting shoot-out following a 0–0 draw after extra-time, as Sweden were eliminated from the competition.

====2006 FIFA World Cup====
During the 2006 World Cup qualification campaign, Ibrahimović scored four goals in a 7–0 victory away to Malta on 4 September 2004. He scored a total of eight goals during the qualifying campaign, which ranked joint-third best among the UEFA teams together with Finland&#x27;s Alexei Eremenko but behind the Czech Republic&#x27;s Jan Koller (nine goals) and Portugal&#x27;s Pauleta (eleven goals). He did not score during the 2006 World Cup finals, as Sweden were knocked out in the round of 16, this time by Germany.

====UEFA Euro 2008====
Ibrahimović was called up for a Euro 2008 qualifier against Liechtenstein on 6 September 2006, but two days before the match, he violated team curfew by leaving the hotel with teammates Christian Wilhelmsson and Olof Mellberg, visiting a nightclub. Though none of the players consumed any alcohol, they were nonetheless all sent home by manager Lars Lagerbäck as punishment and did not take part in the match. Mellberg and Wilhelmsson did not appeal the coach&#x27;s decision, but Ibrahimović felt that it was unjust and therefore refused to take part in Sweden&#x27;s next qualifiers against Iceland and Spain. He also refused to partake in a friendly against Egypt on 7 February 2007, but ended his self-imposed boycott a month later, and returned for Sweden&#x27;s loss to Northern Ireland on 28 March. He did not score in any of the 12 qualifying matches. Ibrahimović was awarded the 2007 Swedish Golden Ball as the &quot;Country&#x27;s Top Player of the Year&quot;.

Ibrahimović ended his international goal drought, which had lasted for over two years, in a 2–0 win against Greece in Sweden&#x27;s Euro 2008 opener on 10 June 2008, in which he was named Man of the Match, also scoring in the next match, a 2–1 defeat against eventual champions Spain, four days later. He finished the tournament with two goals as Sweden were eliminated in the group stage by Russia, following a 2–0 loss.

====2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying====
Ibrahimović scored a goal in a 4–0 win against Malta on 10 June 2009 in a 2010 World Cup qualifier. On 5 September 2009, he scored a last second goal in Ferenc Puskás Stadium against Hungary in a 2–1 win for Sweden in their qualification match, although Sweden ultimately failed to qualify for the tournament, finishing third in their qualifying group.

====UEFA Euro 2012====

Ahead of the Euro 2012 qualification, Ibrahimović was named team captain on his return to the national team by manager Erik Hamrén. He scored his first goals of the qualifying game against San Marino, where he scored the first and fifth goals in a 6–0 win in front of over 21,000 home fans despite being down to ten men for over an hour. His next goals came in the form of a hat-trick against Finland, whom they beat 5–0.

At the Euro 2012 finals, Ibrahimović scored the opening goal in Sweden&#x27;s first game of the tournament, a 2–1 defeat against hosts Ukraine. He then scored with a volley, later considered the goal of the tournament, to open the score in Sweden&#x27;s 2–0 win against France in the last group match; he was later named Man of the Match. Despite the victory, Sweden were knocked out of the competition in the group stage. Although Sweden suffered a group stage elimination, Ibrahimović was named to the Team of the Tournament for his performances.

====2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying====
In October 2012, Ibrahimović scored Sweden&#x27;s first goal as they came from 4–0 down to draw 4–4 in a 2014 World Cup qualifier against Germany in Berlin. It was the first time in its history that the German national team had not won a match after leading by four goals.

On 14 November 2012, he scored all four goals in a 4–2 win over England in the first ever match at the Friends Arena. His fourth goal, a 35-yard overhead kick with his back to goal, won him praise from players and pundits, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; calling it &quot;a moment of sublime mastery&quot;, while the BBC described it as a goal that &quot;combined unfathomable imagination and expert technique&quot;. It would win Ibrahimović the 2013 FIFA Puskás Award for Goal of the Year. It is often considered one of the best goals of all time.

On 14 August 2013, Ibrahimović scored another international hat-trick at the Friends Arena, scoring Sweden&#x27;s first three goals in a 4–2 friendly win against Scandinavian rivals Norway. Ibrahimović ended Sweden&#x27;s qualifying campaign with eight goals. He scored twice in a 3–2 play-off defeat to Portugal – billed as a battle between Ibrahimović and Cristiano Ronaldo (Ronaldo scored three) – as the team failed to reach the 2014 World Cup. Ibrahimović summarised the defeat by saying: &quot;One thing is for sure, a World Cup without me is nothing to watch.&quot;

====Sweden&#x27;s top scorer, UEFA Euro 2016 and initial retirement====

On 4 September 2014, Ibrahimović scored his 50th international goal in a 2–0 friendly match victory over Estonia, making him the Swedish national team&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer. Earlier in the same match, he equaled Sven Rydell&#x27;s record of 49 by scoring the opening goal. On 8 September, he made his 100th appearance for Sweden in a Euro 2016 qualifier against Austria at the Ernst Happel Stadion in Vienna. On 14 November 2015, Ibrahimović scored the winning goal for Sweden in a 2–1 victory in the home leg of the Euro 2016 qualifying play-off against rivals Denmark. Three days later, he scored both Sweden&#x27;s goals of a 2–2 draw in Copenhagen to qualify the nation for the Euro 2016 finals. Ibrahimović scored eleven goals during the qualifying phase, making him the second-highest overall top scorer after Poland&#x27;s Robert Lewandowski.

On 11 May 2016, Ibrahimović was included in the final 23-man squad for Sweden at Euro 2016. On 21 June 2016, he announced that he would retire from international football immediately after Sweden&#x27;s last match at the tournament. The following day, Sweden finished their group in last place after a 1–0 loss against Belgium, and as a result were eliminated along with seven other teams in the first round. As captain, Ibrahimović played every minute of Sweden&#x27;s three group matches, but did not score any goals, managing only one shot on target during the tournament.

====Talks of comeback and return to the national team====

In November 2017, after Sweden clinched qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia by defeating Italy in the second qualifying round, there was speculation about a possible return of Ibrahimović to the national team. Ibrahimović himself expressed his wish to represent Sweden in the World Cup. However, in April 2018, Sweden manager Janne Andersson stated that Ibrahimović would not be called up for the World Cup, thus ending any possibility of a return. Later in June, Ibrahimović blamed the Swedish media for his World Cup absence.

In November 2020, Ibrahimović hinted in a newspaper interview once again the possibility of returning to the Swedish national side, prompting Sweden manager Janne Andersson to fly to Milan to discuss the matter with him. On 15 March 2021, Andersson included Ibrahimović in the Sweden squad for 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Kosovo and Georgia, officially confirming his comeback to the side almost five years after his initial retirement. Ibrahimović responded to the announcement by simply tweeting &quot;The return of the God&quot;. On 25 March, he started in a 1–0 home win against Georgia, providing the assist to Viktor Claesson&#x27;s decisive goal, making him the oldest man in history to play for Sweden&#x27;s national team. He then assisted Ludwig Augustinsson&#x27;s opening goal in the following 3–0 win against Kosovo before being substituted in the 67th minute.

On 15 May 2021, days before Sweden was to announce their UEFA Euro 2020 squad, Andersson confirmed that Ibrahimović would not be included in the squad due to a knee injury he sustained with Milan days prior. He appeared as a late substitute in Sweden&#x27;s 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying play-off final against Poland on 29 March 2022, as Sweden lost 0–2 and failed to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

On 15 March 2023, Andersson said Ibrahimović would be in the Sweden squad once more after a one-year absence, for their European Championship qualifiers against Belgium and Azerbaijan, but would not start the games. With his appearance against Belgium, he was initially hailed as being the oldest player to appear in a European Championship qualifier, breaking the record set by Dino Zoff, however, it was later confirmed that Lee Casciaro, four days older than Ibrahimović, had instead taken the record the same day.

==Style of play==
Ibrahimović has been described by ESPN as being &quot;good in the air, quick, tall, strong and agile, he plays well with his back to goal and boasts some of the best finishing, vision, passing and ball control around.&quot; A versatile and well-rounded attacker, from a tactical standpoint, Ibrahimović was capable of playing anywhere along the front line, due to his ability to both create and score goals for his team, although he was most often deployed as a striker, due to his composure and eye for goal. He has also functioned in a more creative playmaking role at times, as a supporting forward or even as a number 10, in particular in his later career, after losing some of his pace and stamina with age; this deeper position allowed him to drop into midfield to pick up the ball, where he utilised his technical ability, vision, passing, and movement to create space and provide assists for teammates.

While naturally right-footed, Ibrahimović throughout his career was a powerful and accurate striker of the ball from both inside or outside the penalty area with either foot, and was also known for his accuracy from penalties and dead ball situations. An accurate finisher with his head as well as with his feet, his height, elevation, and strength often gave him an advantage at winning aerial challenges, and also allowed him to function as a &quot;target man&quot;; despite his large stature, Ibrahimović was uncommonly agile for a player of his size, and his athleticism and ability in the air saw him score several goals from acrobatic strikes and volleys throughout his career, which earned him the moniker &quot;Ibracadabra&quot; in the Italian media. In spite of his size and physique, Ibrahimović possessed excellent technique and ball control, which, coupled with his balance, power, and physicality, enabled him to hold up the ball well with his back to goal, retain possession, and link up with other players; he has also been praised by pundits for his creativity and dribbling skills. Although he was not gifted with exceptional pace, in particular over shorter distances, which became more evident in his later career as he slowed down with age, he was also a quick player and a fast sprinter, who possessed significant acceleration in his youth, and was able to clock top speeds over 30 km/h even into his 30s.
Considered to be a highly talented player in his youth, due to his prolific goalscoring, consistency, and spectacular strikes, Ibrahimović came to be regarded by many in the sport to be one of the best players in the world during his prime, and as one of the greatest and most complete strikers of his generation; he has also been regarded as one of the greatest strikers of all time.

Ibrahimović drew praise from managers and teammates for his leadership and longevity, as well as his fitness, professionalism, and dedication in training. Regarding his work-ethic, his former Juventus manager Fabio Capello commented in 2016: &quot;At the beginning of his first spell at Juventus [...] I noticed that he was weaker than I thought when he had to kick the ball and was not very strong in the air. Ibrahimovic [sic] loved making assists more than scoring goals. I wanted him to become more ruthless in front of goal and improve his finishing. He had the same technical skills as Van Basten and I made him watch some videos of him to improve his finishing. I told him to watch Van Basten&#x27;s movements inside the area and the way he used to score goals. Ibra got it straight away; I think results are out there to prove it. He is a very humble guy and he worked every day to improve. He&#x27;s proud of himself too, he loves being the best.&quot;
Although Ibrahimović was criticised at times in the media for being inconsistent in high pressure situations, and for his limited work-rate and poor performances in big matches, in particular in his youth, throughout his career he scored in some of the biggest matches in football; these include the Derby della Madonnina and the Derby d&#x27;Italia in Italy, El Clásico, El Otro Clásico, and the Catalan Derbi barceloní in Spain, Le Classique in France, De Klassieker and De Topper in the Netherlands, and the Manchester Derby and North-West Derby in England, as well as UEFA Champions League and UEFA European Championship games against some of the strongest opponents in European football. He has also scored in the Helsingborgs IF–Malmö FF &quot;Skånederby&quot; in Sweden, and in &quot;El Tráfico&quot; and the &quot;California Clásico&quot; in the United States. Moreover, in addition to being a prolific striker, he was also highly successful throughout his career, winning numerous titles in several countries; additionally, he is the only player to have scored for six different clubs in the Champions League. Known for his strong mentality and leadership, as well as his extroverted and highly competitive personality, despite his success, he was criticised in the media for his arrogance, aggression and rebellious character, as well as his lack of discipline on the pitch, in particular in his early career, which led him to be involved in confrontations with other players, some of his managers and even reporters. Ibrahimović has frequently been compared to Dutchman Marco van Basten, due to their similar playing styles, physiques, and proclivity for scoring from powerful shots and volleys; despite this comparison, Ibrahimović has stated that his main influence was his idol, former Brazilian forward Ronaldo, whom he regards as the greatest player of all time. He has also been likened to the enigmatic French former footballer Eric Cantona, who also played for Manchester United.

==Post-playing career==
On 11 December 2023, RedBird Capital Partners announced the hiring of Ibrahimović as a new senior adviser to AC Milan. Since then, despite not being officially part of AC Milan&#x27;s managerial staff, Ibrahimović was deeply involved in the club&#x27;s internal organizational matters, with RedBird&#x27;s head Gerry Cardinale stating him to be his &quot;proxy&quot; at the club.

==Football-related business activities==
===Hammarby IF===
On 27 November 2019, it was announced that Ibrahimović had bought 23.5 percent of the shares in Hammarby IF, a Swedish top flight club from Stockholm. The seller was Anschutz Entertainment Group, also the owner of his former club LA Galaxy, who reduced their stake in Hammarby by half. In Sweden, all sport teams in the league systems are regulated to be nonprofit organizations, which means that a majority of the voting rights, or 51 percent, is still controlled by the members of the club. Fans of Malmö FF, who were unhappy with Ibrahimović&#x27;s investment in another Swedish club, have vandalised his statue in Malmö on numerous occasions.

==Controversies==
=== Violence ===

Ibrahimović has been involved in several violent incidents with teammates. When he was playing for Malmö FF&#x27;s junior team, Ibrahimović headbutted a teammate after he was tackled by him during a training session. The teammate&#x27;s father, a police officer, wanted the other players to sign a petition to expel Ibrahimović from the team. After a 2004 international friendly against the Netherlands, Ajax teammate Rafael van der Vaart publicly accused Ibrahimović of deliberately injuring him during the game. Ibrahimović responded by threatening to break both of van der Vaart&#x27;s legs. Ibrahimović also reportedly punched Ajax teammate Mido in the dressing room after the latter had thrown a pair of scissors at him.

In 2010, Ibrahimović was involved in a training-ground fist-fight with Milan teammate Oguchi Onyewu, after Ibrahimović had made a two-footed tackle on Onyewu, followed by a headbutt. The two were separated and the session prematurely abandoned, with Ibrahimović suffering a broken rib. Both players had accused one of insulting the other.

Ibrahimović made a violent tackle on Inter defender Marco Materazzi during a Milan derby in the 2010–2011 Serie A season, resulting in Materazzi&#x27;s hospitalization. Ibrahimović later revealed that he did so intentionally, stating that he had &quot;waited for this moment for the last four years&quot; because of a tackle that Materazzi made on him while Ibrahimović was playing for Juventus.

In March 2011, Ibrahimović was given a three-match ban for punching Bari defender Marco Rossi in the stomach during a game. He received another three-match ban in February 2012 for slapping Napoli player Salvatore Aronica. In 2011, Ibrahimović kicked teammate Antonio Cassano in the head while Cassano was speaking to reporters.

In November 2012, while with Paris Saint-Germain, Ibrahimović received a two-match ban for kicking Saint-Étienne goalkeeper Stéphane Ruffier in the chest. In December 2012, he was accused by Lyon defender Dejan Lovren and president Jean-Michel Aulas of deliberately stamping on Lovren&#x27;s head. Lovren suggested the reason Ibrahimović had escaped punishment was due to his &quot;superstar status&quot;. In February 2013, UEFA handed Ibrahimović a two-match ban for stamping on Valencia winger Andrés Guardado.

On 21 May 2018, Ibrahimović was sent off for slapping Montreal Impact player Michael Petrasso in the head, after the latter had stepped on his foot. In April 2019, Real Salt Lake defender Nedum Onuoha accused Ibrahimović of foul play and threats to injure him during a game, calling him &quot;arrogant&quot;, &quot;disrespectful&quot;, and &quot;a complete thug&quot;. In May 2019, Ibrahimović received a two-match ban for violent conduct, after he had grabbed New York City FC goalkeeper Sean Johnson by the neck.

=== Abuse ===

In March 2013, PSG winger Lucas Moura claimed that Ibrahimović regularly insulted teammates, stating, &quot;He always asks for the ball and insults a lot. He is sometimes a bit arrogant and complains.&quot; Moura later claimed, however, that the interview was twisted and badly translated. In May 2013, Ibrahimović was filmed screaming at PSG sporting director Leonardo after the club&#x27;s title victory.

Lyon coach Hubert Fournier accused Ibrahimović of abusing officials, stating in January 2015 that &quot;all the referees in this league get insulted by this person&quot;. Two months later, following a Ligue 1 loss to Bordeaux, Ibrahimović was recorded ranting about the level of officiating in the match, proclaiming: &quot;In 15 years I&#x27;ve never seen a [good] referee in this shit country ... [they] don&#x27;t even deserve PSG.&quot; He later apologised, but was criticised by French politicians, and Ligue 1 imposed a four-match ban.

On 20 July 2019, Ibrahimović elbowed Mohamed El Monir during a match with the LA Galaxy against Los Angeles FC, then had an altercation after the match with their goalkeeping coach Zak Abdel, telling him: &quot;Go home. You little bitch. Go home&quot;. More controversy followed suit when, following Galaxy&#x27;s loss to crosstown rivals Los Angeles in the playoffs, Ibrahimović was seen making obscene gestures towards heckling fans as he left the pitch.

Ibrahimović received a one-match ban following an altercation with former teammate Romelu Lukaku in his side&#x27;s Coppa Italia fixture against Inter Milan in January 2021, in which pitchside microphones picked up Ibrahimović repeatedly telling Lukaku, &quot;Go do your voodoo shit&quot;, calling him a &quot;little donkey&quot;, and telling him to &quot;call [his] mother&quot;. Ibrahimović denied accusations of racism, posting on Twitter: &quot;there is no place for racism.&quot; An investigation was opened by the Italian Football Federation, with a potential ten-match ban for Ibrahimović if found guilty of racial abuse. However, it was reported in March that he had been cleared of the charge, as the incident was deemed purely unsportsmanlike and only warranted a fine.

=== Falling out with Pep Guardiola ===
During his spell at Barcelona, Ibrahimović had a falling-out with coach Pep Guardiola, culminating in a dressing room incident in which Ibrahimović allegedly threw a training-kit box across the room and screamed insults at Guardiola. Guardiola eventually refused to speak to Ibrahimović and loaned him out to Milan. Barcelona vice president Carles Vilarrubi further revealed that Ibrahimović had threatened to publicly beat up Guardiola if he was not released to Milan. Ibrahimović stated that Pep Guardiola was &quot;not a man&quot; during an interview with CNN in November 2015.

=== Controversial remarks ===

In 2013, Ibrahimović came under fire from the Sweden women&#x27;s national team for an interview published on Christmas Day by tabloid &quot;Expressen&quot;, in which he had commented about the disparity of achievements by, and the treatment of, male and female footballers. His former teammate Anders Svensson had been rewarded with a car for becoming Sweden&#x27;s most-capped player that year, but Therese Sjögran had received no such reward for doing likewise for the women&#x27;s team, despite owning 41 more caps (187 to 146) than Svensson at the time. Ibrahimović&#x27;s response to the issue was that Sweden would be &quot;devaluing&quot; Svensson &quot;by comparing him with the ladies&#x27; individual achievements. They can get a bike with my autograph on it and then we&#x27;re good.&quot; Coach Pia Sundhage replied that his comments were &quot;sad and unfortunate&quot; and epitomised &quot;failings in the basic values of male football&quot;, while Sjögran said, &quot;I understand him when he says that the men&#x27;s national team brings in more money and exposure. That&#x27;s true. But this is about respect.&quot;

=== Hammarby investment ===

In November 2019, Ibrahimović bought a 23.5% stake in Stockholm-based club Hammarby, who were the rivals of the striker&#x27;s boyhood team, Malmö FF. In a statement, Ibrahimović expressed his admiration for the club and its fans, and how he was excited for the opportunity to support &quot;one of the most interesting and influential clubs in Sweden.&quot; However, this investment decision infuriated many fans of Malmö who considered it a betrayal, and they vandalized his bronze statue and set it ablaze. Ibrahimović responded to the incident by claiming that the decision had nothing to do with where he began his career.

=== Involvement in betting ===
In April 2021, Ibrahimović was investigated by UEFA over alleged financial interest in a betting company called &quot;Bethard&quot;. A month later, he was fined €50,000 by UEFA for breaking disciplinary regulations related to his interest in the aforementioned betting company.

=== Qatar visit ===
During the controversial 2022 FIFA World Cup, Ibrahimović visited Qatar, amidst a widespread boycott of the tournament. Ibrahimović later stated that he had a &quot;10/10&quot; experience during his time in the country and praised Qatari politics, stating that &quot;Qatar has a system that works&quot; while &quot;Sweden does not have a system that fully works&quot;. His remarks faced widespread criticism from media and numerous human rights activists who raised concerns about the state of human rights in Qatar.

==Personal life==
Ibrahimović has one sibling (Sanela) and four half-siblings. His longtime partner is Helena Seger, with whom he has two sons. He used to reside outside Los Angeles when he played for LA Galaxy. He still has a home in Malmö, where he spends his summers. Ibrahimović received an honorary black belt in taekwondo; he attended classes at the Malmö Taekwondo club &quot;Enighet&quot; (&quot;Unity&quot;) as a child. Ibrahimović is fluent in five languages: Swedish, Bosnian, English, Spanish and Italian. He has stated that he was raised as a Catholic. Ibrahimović often refers to himself in the third person.

The name &quot;Zlatan&quot; was trademarked in May 2003 at the Swedish Patent and Registration Office for &quot;most likely being perceived as Zlatan Ibrahimović&quot;, meaning he receives exclusive rights to the name for certain products, including sporting goods, clothing, and shoes.
Ibrahimović is under contract with Nike and features in their television advertising where he has appeared alongside other players endorsed by the company, including Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and Wayne Rooney. He wears the Nike Mercurial boot line and has the names and dates of birth of his sons embedded onto the external sides of his boots. In late 2007, Ibrahimović, with the help of Nike, self-funded Zlatan Court in the streets of the city district Rosengård in his hometown Malmö: he provided a playing mat, goalposts, lighting and a modern fence. In 2008, he donated new Nike kits to his youth club, FBK Balkan.

In a February 2011 interview, Ibrahimović stated that the boxer Muhammad Ali is one of his role models, going on to say: &quot;One of my idols in sport and outside the sport also [sic]...he believed in his [principles] and he never gave [them] up.&quot; While in Malmö with the national team in September 2012, Ibrahimović was honoured with the inscription of his name on the city&#x27;s &quot;Walk of Fame of Sports&quot;. The Swedish Post Office issued a set of five postage stamps featuring Ibrahimović in March 2014. Ibrahimović features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series, and was the fourth highest rated player in &quot;FIFA 15&quot;.
On 11 August 2014, Ibrahimović paid US $51,000 to send the Swedish national football team for the intellectually disabled to the INAS World Football Championships in Brazil. After teammates Johan Elmander, Kim Källström, Andreas Isaksson and Per Nilsson donated autographed jerseys to be auctioned off for the cause, Ibrahimović responded, &quot;What the hell are you going to do with a shirt? How much is it to go?&quot;. In a league match against Caen on 14 February 2015, Ibrahimović took off his shirt after scoring a goal to unveil the removable tattooed names of 50 people suffering from hunger around the world, in a gesture to raise awareness for famine in accordance with the United Nations World Food Programme.

Active on social media, Ibrahimović has over 55 million Instagram followers, the most for a Swede. Independent Swedish film production company Auto Images released the sports documentary &quot;Becoming Zlatan&quot; in February 2016 which follows Ibrahimović through his formative years with Malmö FF and Ajax all the way to his breakthrough with Juventus in 2005. The film has been featured at several film festivals including the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam, Helsinki Documentary Film Festival and the Rouen Nordic Film Festival amongst others. He does not drink alcohol.

In 2018, Ibrahimović mentioned that his wife only allows him to hang one picture of himself at home: &quot;My wife does not allow me to have pictures of myself&quot;, then added, &quot;There is one of my feet on the wall. That is what has given us what we have, it is a reminder for the family, not for me, of what we have.&quot;

On 8 October 2019, a statue of Ibrahimović was unveiled in his hometown, outside Malmö&#x27;s Stadion. The statue, created by Peter Linde, is tall and weighs almost .

===Religious and social background===
Ibrahimović was born to a Bosniak Muslim father, Šefik Ibrahimović, and a Croat Catholic mother, Jurka Gravić; his parents were immigrants to Sweden from SFR Yugoslavia—Šefik from Bijeljina, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina and Jurka from near Škabrnja, SR Croatia—and met for the first time in Sweden. Ibrahimović&#x27;s parents divorced when he was a child, and although his upbringing was divided between them, he spent more time with his father: &quot;I had time with my mother but I really lived with my father.&quot; Relatives on both sides of his family were killed in the Bosnian War of the early 1990s. He has said in a 2012 interview with PSG that: &quot;My father is Muslim, my mother is Catholic, but none of that has anything to do with football. I received a special education. I&#x27;m me and football is a religion in its own right, and everyone is welcome...&quot; Ibrahimović was incensed in 2005 when Italian media attempted to build interest in a Juventus–Inter match by describing it as a &quot;mini Balkan War&quot; between himself and Serbian opponent Siniša Mihajlović. He said that he had no interest in nationalism, partially due to his mixed Bosniak-Croat parentage and his younger half-brother being fathered by a Serb.

In an interview with CNN on 24 November 2015, he stressed that his Muslim background was &quot;not a factor&quot; in fans&#x27; perception of him: &quot;For me, it didn&#x27;t change (anything) because my father is Muslim and my mother is Catholic... For me it is all about respect. That&#x27;s how I grew up and the way I learned to be. This is what I am.&quot; Nevertheless he later described himself as a &quot;deeply faithful Catholic&quot;. The Malmö-based television presenter Teddy Landén, who was interviewed for the same documentary, noted Ibrahimović&#x27;s choice of shirt name following his 2001 transfer to Ajax. He believed that the player changed from having Zlatan to having Ibrahimović on his jersey to honour his background and show to children from Rosengård and Malmö in general: &#x27;If I can do it, you can do it.&#x27;&quot; In Ibrahimović&#x27;s autobiography, he says that this change was only because his relationship with his father had improved at the time.

On 18 February 2021, during a Europa League Round of 32 match between Red Star Belgrade and Milan at the Rajko Mitić Stadium, Ibrahimović was subjected to racism by the Red Star fans. Ibrahimović, who did not play the match, watched the game from the stands and jumped to celebrate once Milan scored, when a fan shouted insults at him, including &quot;balija&quot;—an ethnic slur targeting Bosnian Muslims. The match was played behind the closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but a few supporters were allowed to spectate from a VIP box. Red Star Belgrade issued an apology and condemned the insults; however, UEFA opened an investigation of the incident nevertheless. On 14 April 2021, the club was fined €30,000 and ordered to play a home game in European competition behind closed doors.

===Tattoos===
His surname is tattooed in Arabic on the back of his right arm, the names of his sons Vincent and Maximilian on his right arm. He has the common Buddhist &quot;Five Deva Faces Yantra&quot; representing wind, water, fire, creative perception and space, arranged in a way believed to ward off illness and injury, on his lower back, in addition to a roaring lion. Another Buddhist tattoo, a &quot;Yant Prajao Khao Nirote&quot; is a protective emblem intended to end the suffering of a family, is on his upper right arm. The phrase &quot;Only God can judge me&quot; is tattooed on his ribcage. He also has a feather, a Koi fish, Polynesian tribal, and ace of hearts and clubs.

<text>The Spring Street station is a local station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Lafayette Street and Spring Street in SoHo and Little Italy, Manhattan, it is served by trains at all times, &lt;6&gt; trains during weekdays in the peak direction, and trains during late night hours.

The Spring Street station was constructed for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) as part of the city&#x27;s first subway line, which was approved in 1900. Construction of the line segment that includes the Spring Street station started on September 12 of the same year. The station opened on October 27, 1904, as one of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway. The station&#x27;s platforms were lengthened in the late 1950s.

The Spring Street station contains two side platforms and four tracks; express trains use the inner two tracks to bypass the station. The station was built with tile and mosaic decorations, which are continued along the platform extensions. The station contains exits to Spring Street at the center of each platform. The platforms are not connected to each other within fare control.

== History ==
=== Construction and opening ===

Planning for a subway line in New York City dates to 1864. However, development of what would become the city&#x27;s first subway line did not start until 1894, when the New York State Legislature authorized the Rapid Transit Act. The subway plans were drawn up by a team of engineers led by William Barclay Parsons, the Rapid Transit Commission&#x27;s chief engineer. It called for a subway line from New York City Hall in lower Manhattan to the Upper West Side, where two branches would lead north into the Bronx. A plan was formally adopted in 1897, and legal challenges were resolved near the end of 1899. The Rapid Transit Construction Company, organized by John B. McDonald and funded by August Belmont Jr., signed Contract 1 with the Rapid Transit Commission in February 1900, in which it would construct the subway and maintain a 50-year operating lease from the opening of the line. In 1901, the firm of Heins &amp; LaFarge was hired to design the underground stations. Belmont incorporated the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) in April 1902 to operate the subway.

The Spring Street station was constructed as part of the IRT&#x27;s original line, particularly the section from Chambers Street to Great Jones Street. Construction on this section of the line began on July 10, 1900, and was awarded to Degnon-McLean Contracting Company. Two days after construction began, the contract was modified to widen the subway at Spring Street to allow for the construction of of a fifth track. By early 1902, the adjacent tunnel had been completed, and the buildings on either side of Lafayette Street (then known as Elm Street) were being underpinned in anticipation of the construction of the subway station itself. The stretch of Elm Street north of Spring Street was being repaved by that September, after the tunnel was completed. The Rapid Transit Commission had yet to pay McDonald for his work by January 1903, in part because sewage lines on the west side of Elm Street had not been completed.

By late 1903, the subway was nearly complete, but the IRT Powerhouse and the system&#x27;s electrical substations were still under construction, delaying the system&#x27;s opening. The Spring Street station opened on October 27, 1904, as one of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway from City Hall to 145th Street on the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.

=== Service changes and station renovations ===

==== 1900s to 1930s ====

After the initial system was completed in 1908, the station was served by local trains along both the West Side (now the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line to Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street) and East Side (now the Lenox Avenue Line). West Side local trains had their southern terminus at City Hall during rush hours and South Ferry at other times, and had their northern terminus at 242nd Street. East Side local trains ran from City Hall to Lenox Avenue (145th Street).

In 1909, to address overcrowding, the New York Public Service Commission proposed lengthening the platforms at stations along the original IRT subway. As part of a modification to the IRT&#x27;s construction contracts made on January 18, 1910, the company was to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car express and six-car local trains. In addition to $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) spent on platform lengthening, $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) was spent on building additional entrances and exits. It was anticipated that these improvements would increase capacity by 25 percent. Platforms at local stations, such as the Spring Street station, were lengthened by between . The northbound platform was extended to the south. Six-car local trains began operating in October 1910. The Lexington Avenue Line opened north of Grand Central–42nd Street in 1918, and the original line was divided into an H-shaped system. All local trains were sent via the Lexington Avenue Line, running along the Pelham Line in the Bronx.

In December 1922, the Transit Commission approved a $3 million project to lengthen platforms at 14 local stations along the original IRT line, including Spring Street and seven other stations on the Lexington Avenue Line. Platform lengths at these stations would be increased from . The commission postponed the platform-lengthening project in September 1923, at which point the cost had risen to $5.6 million. The commission again considered lengthening the IRT platforms at Spring Street in December 1927. At the end of the month, the Transit Commission requested that the IRT create plans to lengthen the platforms at Bleecker Street and three other Lexington Avenue Line stations to . The New York City Board of Transportation drew up plans for the project, but the federal government placed an injunction against the commission&#x27;s platform-lengthening decree, which remained in place for over a year. The commission approved the plans in mid-1929; the Spring Street station&#x27;s southbound platform was to be extended to the south, while the northbound platform was to be extended south. The IRT refused, claiming that the city government was responsible for the work, and obtained a federal injunction to prevent the commission from forcing the IRT to lengthen the platforms. In late 1930, the commission requested that the New York Supreme Court force the IRT to lengthen platforms at the Canal Street and Spring Street stations.

==== 1940s to present ====
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. In late 1959, contracts were awarded to extend the platforms at , , , , Spring Street, , , , , and to . In April 1960, work began on a $3,509,000 project (equivalent to $ million in ) to lengthen platforms at seven of these stations to accommodate ten-car trains. The northbound platforms at Canal Street, Spring Street, Bleecker Street, and Astor Place were lengthened from ; the platform extensions at these stations opened on February 19, 1962.

The station was renovated in the late 1980s. After a mosaic panel fell off the wall during 1988, the renovation was temporarily halted.

== Station layout ==


Like other local stations, Spring Street has four tracks and two side platforms. The 6 stops here at all times, rush-hour and midday &lt;6&gt; trains stop here in the peak direction; and the 4 stops here during late nights. The two express tracks are used by the 4 and 5 trains during daytime hours. The station is between to the north and to the south. The platforms were originally long, like at other local stations on the original IRT, but as a result of the 1959 platform extensions, became long. The platform extensions are at the front ends of the original platforms: the southbound platform was extended southward and the northbound platform was extended northward. This resulted in the two platforms being offset from each other. Both platforms are slightly curved.

Spring Street had a fifth center track at the time of its opening. The track was intended as a storage siding and was long. This track did not last long; it was reportedly disconnected and removed in 1906, only two years after the subway opened. The trackway is now used as the location of a mechanical room.

===Design===

As with other stations built as part of the original IRT, the tunnel is covered by a U-shaped trough that contains utility pipes and wires. The bottom of this trough contains a foundation of concrete no less than thick. Each platform consists of concrete slabs, beneath which are drainage basins. The original platforms contain circular, cast-iron Doric-style columns spaced every , while the platform extensions contain I-beam columns. Additional columns between the tracks, spaced every , support the jack-arched concrete station roofs. There is a gap between the trough wall and the platform walls, which are made of -thick brick covered over by a tiled finish.

The original decorative scheme consists of blue tile station-name tablets, light blue tile bands, a white terracotta cornice, and light blue terracotta plaques. The mosaic tiles at all original IRT stations were manufactured by the American Encaustic Tile Company, which subcontracted the installations at each station. The decorative work was performed by tile contractor Manhattan Glass Tile Company and terracotta contractor Atlantic Terra Cotta Company. The ceilings of the original platforms and fare control areas contain plaster molding. The station has small &quot;S&quot; cartouches with two poppies from 1904, made by Atlantic Terra Cotta, and large mosaic tablets by Heins &amp; LaFarge, also from 1904. Other small &quot;S&quot; and &quot;Spring St&quot; mosaics are newer.

Where the platforms have been extended, the walls have green tiles and a darker green trim line with &quot;SPRING ST&quot; written on it in black sans serif font at regular intervals.

===Exits===
Spring Street has four entrances, two to each platform. The northbound entrances are at either eastern corner of Lafayette and Spring Streets, while the southbound entrances are at either western corner of the same intersection. The entrance to the southwestern corner is located within the building line at 225 Lafayette Street, a 12-story building built in 1925 for the East River Savings Bank.

== In popular culture ==
This station is featured in the 2008 film &quot;Cloverfield&quot;. The scene was not filmed there, however. The station is featured in the season 3 episode, &quot;Lo-Fi&quot;, in the television show Criminal Minds.

<text>The Girl Who Owned a City is the only published novel by O. T. Nelson, first published in 1975. This book, sometimes taught in schools, is considered to be best suited for those between the ages of 12 and 15. A graphic novel adaptation by Dan Jolley with art by Joëlle Jones and Jenn Manley Lee was published in 2012.

==Plot==
A deadly virus has swept the world, killing off everyone over the age of twelve in the span of a month or so. In the town of Glen Ellyn, Illinois, outside of Chicago, ten-year-old Lisa Nelson and her younger brother Todd Nelson are surviving, like all the children in the story, by looting abandoned houses and shops. Although there are abandoned cars in every driveway and lining every street, Lisa is the first child to think of driving one. She is also the first to think of raiding a farm, and the first to look at the dwindling supplies in stores and deduce that groceries come from warehouses. She finds a supermarket warehouse and raids it, enlisting the help of Craig Bergman, a neighbor boy two years older than her, but makes clear to him and all the other children in her neighborhood that the entire warehouse and all its contents are her exclusive property, not to be shared unless she chooses: she assures them all that she will burn the warehouse and everything in it rather than be forced to share against her will.

She considers relocating to the farm, but decides against it because it is difficult to defend (other children are starting to form gangs) and because &quot;planning and getting the world back to the way it was, with schools, and hospitals, and electricity&quot; are much more &quot;exciting&quot; than &quot;hiding away on a farm ... digging in the dirt all day&quot;.

Lisa and her friends are approached by the &quot;Chidester Gang&quot;, led by Tom Logan. Suspecting that Lisa has a source of supplies, Logan offers a food-for-protection deal, which Lisa declines. Unhesitatingly taking charge, she forms her block-long stretch of Grand Avenue into a militia, armed with guns, Molotov cocktails, and primitive weapons. When the militia proves unsuccessful at defending the &quot;Land of Grandville&quot; against &quot;the fearful and cruel army of Chidester and Elm&quot;, and Lisa&#x27;s house is lost, Lisa comes up with the idea of moving the &quot;child-families&quot;—and the entire contents of the warehouse—into the local high school, and transforming it into a fortress-city. Within the city, Lisa is the only authority, by virtue of the fact that she saw the abandoned high school and thought of moving there: this has earned her sole title to the &quot;City of Glenbard&quot; and everything in it.

A year after completion, things proceed according to plan until Logan and his gang manage to stage a successful attack on Glenbard, during which Lisa is shot in the arm. Todd and Lisa&#x27;s friend Jill rescue her, and Jill performs basic surgery to remove the bullet from her arm, dosing her with whiskey for pain relief. When Lisa recovers, they retake the city from Logan, who has meanwhile learned that conqueror and leader are two very different things. Glenbard&#x27;s &quot;citizens&quot; have refused to work for Logan. 
When they learn Lisa is still alive, they leave the &quot;city&quot; in droves, to join her on the farm. Lisa makes several plans to recapture the city, but ultimately regains it by lecturing Logan into relinquishing control back to her.

The book ends with a foreshadowing that the citizens of Glenbard will at some time be forced to face far larger armies, led by now extremely powerful dictators, tyrants and warlords. If any semblance of a free society is to exist in the new world, the citizens of Glenbard must make themselves capable of protecting and growing it by gaining in knowledge, power, and organization, and at the same time continuing to incorporate leadership and respect for the individual person into their society.

<doc id="728799" wikidata="Q946230" url="?curid=728799" title="Chrysler Fifth Avenue">
<text>The Chrysler Fifth Avenue was a trim level/option package or model name used by Chrysler for its larger sedans from 1979 to 1993. The Fifth Avenue name was no longer used after 1993 when Chrysler introduced its new LH-platform New Yorker and similar LHS. The title &quot;Fifth Avenue&quot; references a street in New York City which contains many upscale shops and cultural attractions. The Chrysler Building is two blocks east of Fifth Avenue.

In 1980, realizing that they needed to offer a comparable luxury sedan to the Cadillac Fleetwood and Lincoln Town Car, Chrysler offered the Fifth Avenue trim package as an option on the R-body New Yorker.

In 1982, further downsizing put the New Yorker model on the M-body platform, with a Fifth Avenue package available. In 1983, to distinguish the M-body New Yorker from the new AE-body New Yorker, the Fifth Avenue name was added to the M-body, so it became the one-year-only New Yorker Fifth Avenue. In 1984, the M-body Chrysler was simply the Fifth Avenue, a name it kept through 1989. The AE New Yorker morphed into the AC body New Yorker in 1988, although all 3 New Yorker models were offered that year (AE New Yorker Turbo, AC New Yorker, and M-body Fifth Avenue).

After the discontinuance of the M-body in mid-1989, Chrysler offered an even smaller Fifth Avenue on the AC platform in 1990, which ran through 1993.

In 1994, a new LH-body New Yorker appeared, as did a companion LH Chrysler, the LHS, in 1996. The New Yorker bowed out after 1997, and was not replaced until the 2005 Chrysler 300 LX. The LHS was discontinued after 2001 and was not replaced.

==Origin and the &quot;R-Body years&quot;==
The Fifth Avenue name was first used in 1979 on an upmarket sub-model of the R-body Chrysler New Yorker sedan. This generation of Chrysler, although already smaller than its maximum size of the previous 1978 Series CS, remained V8-powered and rear wheel drive. The R-body rode on a wheelbase, which was similar to the downsized Cadillac and Lincoln competitors.

For 1979, ordering the New Yorker Fifth Avenue Edition package got the buyer a car finished in only two-tone &quot;Designer&#x27;s Cream-on-Beige&quot; exterior paint, with matching Champagne leather interior and lighter-toned &quot;driftwood&quot; woodgrain dash appliques and a unique &quot;Pentastar&quot; hood ornament. There was a standard landau vinyl roof, and somewhat unusual fixed quarter windows which were integrated with the rear doors, while the body style was a &quot;pillared hardtop&quot;, leaving the doors without metal frames around the windows. Added to the upper door frame surrounding the fixed quarter windows was a courtesy light above a leather door handle while an entry footlight was installed in the lower portion of the door.

The package was so thoroughly color-keyed that even the bumper rub strips were beige. The R-body Fifth Avenues ran for three years, although additional Fifth Avenue colors were added for 1980 and 1981. The concealed headlights were a styling feature that carried over from the discontinued Imperial LeBaron and the Chrysler New Yorker Brougham that briefly replaced the marque. The listed retail price of the New Yorker was $8,631 ($ in dollars ) and the Fifth Avenue trim package added $1,500 extra ($ in dollars ). The front suspension continued to offer Chryslers signature, but antiquated, longitudinal front torsion bars, called Torsion-Aire, and anti-sway bar with a solid rear limited-slip differential connected to leaf springs which was introduced on the 1957 Series C-76.

To add to its exclusivity, Chrysler offered &quot;Convenience and Appearance Options&quot;. The list offered Open Road Handling Package, Two-Tone Paint, interior lighting, air conditioning with an upgraded climate control feature, rear window defroster, cruise control, power adjustable front seat, power windows, power electric door locks, power trunk release, luxury appearance steering wheel with an extra cost leather wrapped feature, digital clock, locking gas cap, lighting and mirrors, halogen headlamps, cornering lamps, electric adjustable outside sideview mirrors, several AM/FM radio or separate stereo radio choices to include CB and 8-track cassette player, power electric extendable antenna, various vinyl side moldings and bumper guards, undercoating, color keyed seat belts, wheel covers, and aluminum wheels, all at extra cost.

For 1980 a second exterior color was offered called &quot;Black Walnut&quot; metallic, a simulated alligator grained padded landau vinyl roof in matching Black Walnut with gold accent body side stripes while the interior color remained only as Champagne leather interior.
The 1981 Fifth Avenues added two new exterior colors, while the Fifth Avenue trim package was now $2,092 ($ in dollars ) to the $10,459 retail price ($ in dollars ). The new colors offered &quot;Mahogany Starmist&quot; and &quot;Heather Mist&quot; exterior paint with gold pinstriping with a matching Mahogany Landau roof with the Mahogany interior offering Heather cloth or leather, or &quot;Nightwatch Blue&quot; with &quot;Heather Mist&quot;, the same color treatment on the Landau roof, with Dark Blue interior pieces instead of Mahogany. Corduroy cloth upholstery was available in Heather or Cashmere, while the leather added Dark Blue and Mahogany to the Heather and Cashmere color choices with matching dashboard, door panels and carpeting. No coupe was offered and instead Chrysler reintroduced the Imperial nameplate as a coupe only, and the Fifth Avenue shared an appearance with the Series YS Imperial coupe.

The underlying technology, consisting of engine, transmission chassis, suspension and drivetrain was shared with all full-sized R-body vehicles sold as Dodge and Plymouth products, while the exclusivity of the Chrysler name added sound insulation, color selections and more sound system choices. Overall production of the R-body New Yorkers was low (less than 75,000 from 1979 through 1981) and Fifth Avenue production was approximately 25% of them. 14 were stretched into limousines and several were provided for use during the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, NY. The others were loaned to Hollywood movie studios. During this time the Early 1980s recession in the United States began to take effect and impact sales.

North American luxury sedans began to experience competition from imported European marques, like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, BMW 7 Series, and the Jaguar XJ which offered standard equipment like fuel injection, responsive engine performance and heightened levels of luxury appearance and equipment.

Japanese marques introduced the Toyota Cressida and the Nissan Maxima offering luxurious appearances, high levels of formerly optional equipment as standard and fuel efficiency for a modest price.

===ASC LeBaron Fifth Avenue===
For 1980 only, a Fifth Avenue package was created by ASC (American Sunroof Corporation) for the Chrysler LeBaron, which shared its Chrysler M platform with the Dodge Diplomat. This rare option package, produced on 654 LeBarons for the year, included many of the exterior features found on the New Yorker Fifth Avenue on a shorter wheelbase.
==1982–1989: The M-body years==
For the 1982 model year, the R-body line was discontinued and the New Yorker nameplate transferred to the smaller M-body line. Up to this point, the Chrysler M-body entry had been sold as LeBaron, but that name was moved to a new K-car based FWD line. Following the nameplate swap, the M-body line was consolidated and simplified. 360 V8 engines were gone, as were coupes and station wagons (the K-car LeBaron&#x27;s coupe and wagon replaced them).

The Fifth Avenue option was still available as a $1,244 package ($ in dollars ) to the listed retail price of $10,851 ($ in dollars ). It was adapted from the earlier LeBaron&#x27;s package, with a distinctive vinyl roof, electro-luminescent opera lamps, and a rear fascia adapted from the Dodge Diplomat, albeit modified. Interiors featured button-tufted, pillow-soft seats covered in either &quot;Kimberley velvet&quot; or &quot;Corinthian leather&quot;, choices that would continue unchanged throughout the car&#x27;s run. In addition, the carpet was thicker than that offered in the base New Yorker, Diplomat and Gran Fury/Caravelle Salon, and the interior had more chrome trim. The Fifth Avenue option also included illuminated entry, AM/FM stereo with a rear amplifier, power door locks, power 6-way driver&#x27;s seat, power antenna, remote trunk release, dual side mirrors, full undercoating, passenger vanity mirror, tape stripes, locking wire wheel covers, as well as a standard 5.2L (318 in³) V8 engine.

The colors offered were expanded from the previous generations exclusivity, offering Goldenrod Crystal Coat, Nightwatch Blue, Charcoal Gray metallic, Formal Black, Morocco Red, Sterling Silver Crystal, Mahogany metallic, and Pearl White.

1982 was the last year for the optional AM/FM 8-track stereo, and AM/FM stereo with integrated CB. The exterior of a Fifth Avenue Edition New Yorker can be identified from a regular New Yorker by the following: opera lights, hood stripes, and Fifth Avenue Edition badges on the rear door window filler panels—New Yorkers bore &quot;New Yorker&quot; badges.
In another confusing name swap, the New Yorker name was now used for another new extended K-car line in 1983, the E-body New Yorker. The larger M-body car was now called New Yorker Fifth Avenue to distinguish it from the E-body. 1983 was the last year M-bodies were made in Canada and the last year for the optional &quot;Chronometer&quot; glovebox-mounted clock, the 225 Slant-six six-cylinder engine, and all analog tuned radios and chrome-trimmed pedals.

For 1984, the car was simply called Fifth Avenue, setting the name that would continue for six successful years. The Fifth Avenue (and its Dodge and Plymouth siblings) would prove to be the last V8-powered, rear wheel drive Chrysler vehicles until the Chrysler 300 was revived in that configuration for 2005.

All Fifth Avenues from 1984 to 1989 were powered by a V8 engine, mated to Chrysler&#x27;s well-known Torqueflite three-speed automatic transmission. Front suspension featured transverse torsion bars with anti-sway bars. As this was the largest Chrysler model available, sales took off, especially during 1985–1986, when over 100,000 were made each year.

Starting with the 1984 models, Fifth Avenue production was moved from Windsor, Ontario to St. Louis, Missouri. Beginning in mid-1987 through mid 1989 model year, they were manufactured at the American Motors plant in Kenosha, Wisconsin which had been purchased by Chrysler in 1987.

The Fifth Avenue also far outsold its Dodge Diplomat and Plymouth Gran Fury siblings, with a much greater proportion of sales going to private customers, despite its higher price tag. Production peaked at 118,000 cars for 1986 and the Fifth Avenue stood out in a by-now K-car dominated lineup as Chrysler&#x27;s lone concession to traditional RWD American sedans.

Some of the changes to the M-body Fifth Avenue through the years included:
* 1984 - New Yorker badge replaced by Fifth Avenue badge on trunklid; &quot;Fifth Avenue Edition&quot; badge continues on the rear doors, a new steering wheel was added. The regular Pentastar was replaced by a crystal one and was now used on the hood ornament and steering wheel (this would continue through 1989). Wiper arms were now black (instead of silver). Engine blocks were also now painted black (previous ones were painted light blue) Optional 10-spoke alloy &quot;Road Wheels&quot; were replaced with new optional &quot;Snowflake&quot; alloy wheels. New upholstery, and new exterior colors (most in base/clear) appeared.
* 1985 - New black gearshift knob introduced (1982 to 1984 models have chromed knobs). Turn signal lever is now also black (1984 and below models were interior color keyed) with the exception of models with two-tone paint. A revised 5.2 L V8 now had a roller camshaft, swirl-port heads, and a carburetor changed from a two-barrel Carter to a two-barrel Holley. This increased horsepower from 130 to 140 and torque was also increased to 265 lb-ft (from 230). California models now also came with the Holley 6280 2bbl carb.
* 1986 - New-style ignition key and center high-mounted stop lamp (the latter a federal mandate) introduced. Models with two-tone paint had lower roof lines. 
* 1987 - New steering wheel; final year for optional alloy wheels, two-tone paint, and rear stereo amplifier were offered. Also the last year for 17-ounce deep-pile carpeting and the last year the radio, headlight switch and climate control panels were silver.
* 1988 - Vinyl roof restyled; lower edge of sail panel covering extended below chrome window sill moldings. &quot;Fifth Avenue Edition&quot; badge replaced by a crystal Pentastar surrounded by a gold wreath which in 1990 would reappear on the Imperial. Driver&#x27;s side seat now had a manual recliner (previous models had 6-way power adjusters, but no recliner). Front headrests were more cushioned. The piping around the seats was now stitched material rather than the plastic in previous years. New radios. Door panels are restyled and new power mirrors are standard. Passenger side dash vents were now interior color-keyed (instead of black with chrome trim). A new overhead console with map lamps, compass/temperature display and sunglasses storage became available. A driver SRS with padded knee bolster affixed below the instrument panel became optional in May.
* 1989 - Final year of production. Driver&#x27;s side airbag is standard. At the time the Fifth Avenue (as well as its M body twins) was one of the only cars that offered an airbag with a tilt steering wheel. Many optional features were made standard.

During the years 1982 to 1988, approximately 60 of these cars were stretched into limousines by various coach companies.

===Production Figures/Base Prices===

Production figures for Fifth Avenue were as follows:

1982 - 50,509&lt;br&gt;

==1990–1993: New Yorker Fifth Avenue ==

1990 saw the previous relationship between New Yorker and Fifth Avenue return, as the Fifth Avenue became a model of the New Yorker. There was some substantive difference, however, as the New Yorker Fifth Avenue used a slightly longer chassis than the standard car. The new New Yorker Fifth Avenue&#x27;s larger interior volume classified it as a full-size model this time; despite having smaller exterior dimensions than the first generation. 1990 also saw the return of hidden headlamps which when off were concealed behind retractable metal covers. Hidden headlamps had not been available since the 1981 R-body New Yorker Fifth Avenue.

The New Yorker Fifth Avenue&#x27;s famous seats, long noted for their button-tufted appearance and sofa-like comfort, continued to be offered with the customer&#x27;s choice of velour or leather, with the former &quot;Corinthian leather&quot; replaced by that of the Mark Cross Company. Leather-equipped cars bore the Mark Cross logo on the seats and, externally, on an emblem attached to the brushed aluminum band ahead of the rear door opera windows.

For 1990, Chrysler&#x27;s new 3.3-liter V6 engine was the standard and only choice, teamed with the company&#x27;s A-604 four-speed electronic automatic transaxle. Beginning in 1991, a larger 3.8-liter V-6 became optional. It delivered the same 147 horsepower as the 3.3, but had more torque.
For the 1992 model year, the New Yorker Fifth Avenue (along with the New Yorker Salon) were restyled with a more rounded-off appearance front and rear.

All New Yorker Fifth Avenues of this generation were covered by Chrysler&#x27;s market-leading &quot;Crystal Key Owner Care Program&quot; which included a 5-year/50,000-mile limited warranty and 7-year/70,000-mile powertrain warranty. A 24-hour toll-free customer service hotline was also provided.

The Fifth Avenue name was discontinued at the end of the 1993 model year when the New Yorker was replaced by the redesigned, longer, and more aerodynamic 1994 New Yorker and similar LHS.

<doc id="728802" wikidata="Q917960" url="?curid=728802" title="Bristol Old Vic">
<text>Bristol Old Vic is a British theatre company based at the Theatre Royal, Bristol. The present company was established in 1946 as an offshoot of the Old Vic in London. It is associated with the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, which became a financially independent organisation in the 1990s. Bristol Old Vic runs a Young Company for those aged 7–25.

The Theatre Royal, the oldest continually-operating theatre in the English-speaking world, was built between 1764 and 1766 on King Street in Bristol. The Coopers&#x27; Hall, built 1743–44, was incorporated as the theatre&#x27;s foyer during 1970–72. Together, they are designated a Grade I listed building by Historic England. Daniel Day-Lewis called it &quot;the most beautiful theatre in England.&quot;

In 2012, the theatre complex completed the first phase of a £19 million refurbishment, increasing the seating capacity and providing up to ten flexible performance spaces. Besides the main Theatre Royal auditorium, the complex includes the Studio theatre and the Side Stage, Paint Shop and Basement performance areas. Whilst the theatre was closed, the company continued to present work in the Studio and Basement spaces, as well as at other sites around Bristol. The Theatre Royal re-opened in 2012 with &quot;Wild Oats&quot;.

== History of the theatre ==
The theatre is situated on King Street, a few yards from the Floating Harbour. From 1972 until 2016, the public entrance was through the Coopers&#x27; Hall, the earliest surviving building on the site. The Coopers&#x27; Hall was built in 1744 for the Coopers&#x27; Company, the guild of coopers in Bristol, by architect William Halfpenny. It has a &quot;debased Palladian&quot; façade with four Corinthian columns. It only remained in the hands of the Coopers until 1785, subsequently becoming a public assembly room, a wine warehouse, a Baptist chapel and eventually a fruit and vegetable warehouse.

The theatre was built between 1764 and 1766. The design of the auditorium has traditionally been taken to have been based, with some variations, on that of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London. Although Bristol architect Thomas Paty supervised construction, the theatre was built to designs by James Saunders, David Garrick&#x27;s carpenter at Drury Lane. Saunders had provided drawings for the theatre in Richmond, Surrey, built in 1765. A long section (1790, at Harvard University Theatre Collection) and a survey plan (1842, at the Local Studies Library) of the Richmond theatre show close similarities with the Bristol theatre in the proportions and in the relationship between the actors on stage and the spectators surrounding them on three sides. The site chosen was Rackhay Yard, a roughly rectangular empty site behind a row of medieval houses and to one side of the Coopers&#x27; Hall. Two (and possibly three) new passageways built through the ground floor of the houses fronting King Street gave access to Rackhay Yard and the &quot;New Theatre&quot; inside it.

Fifty numbered silver tickets were issued to shareholders, granting them unlimited free access to shows at the theatre, in return for each of them donating £50 to fund its construction. Two special golden tickets were issued to cabinet maker Edward Crump and his wife Ann Crump, for &quot;the great trouble and expense&quot; they had gone to to convince the landowners to allow the construction of the theatre.

The theatre opened on 30 May 1766 with a performance which including a prologue and epilogue given by David Garrick. As the proprietors were not able to obtain a royal licence, productions were announced as &quot;a concert with a specimen of rhetorick&quot; to evade the restrictions imposed on theatres by the Licensing Act 1737. This ruse was soon abandoned, but a production in the neighbouring Coopers&#x27; Hall in 1773 did fall foul of this law.
Legal concerns were alleviated when the royal letters patent were eventually granted following the passing of the (18 Geo. 3. c. 8), and the theatre became a patent theatre and took up the name &quot;Theatre Royal&quot;. At this time the theatre also started opening for the winter season, and a joint company was established to perform at both the Bath Theatre Royal and in Bristol, featuring performers such as Sarah Siddons, whose ghost, according to legend, haunts the Bristol theatre. The auditorium was rebuilt with a new sloping ceiling and gallery in 1800.

From 1819 the theatre was managed by William M&#x27;Cready the elder, with little success, and then, following his death in 1834 by his widow, the actress Sarah M&#x27;Cready. Following her death in 1853 the M&#x27;Creadys&#x27; son-in-law James Chute took over.
However, he became overcommitted, running the Bath Theatre Royal, the Theatre Royal Bristol and the new Prince&#x27;s Theatre, opened in 1867. In 1881 the lease on the theatre was taken up by popular actor George Melville, who invested heavily in it, carrying out heavy refurbishment. Despite the popularity of his pantomime performances, he struggled to make a profit and gave up the lease in 1893. Failures to invest in the decaying fabric of the building in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, legal battles between the proprietors and the managers, as well as the shifting nature of popular entertainment, saw the theatre struggle up to the time it was taken over by the Old Vic in 1943.

Historic documents from the history of the Theatre Royal and Bristol Old Vic can be found at Bristol Archives and University of Bristol Theatre Collection.

== Formation of the Bristol Old Vic ==

In 1942, the lease owners put the building up for sale. The sale was perceived as a possible loss of the building as a theatre and a public appeal was mounted to preserve its use, and as a result a new Trust was established to buy the building. The Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA) leased the building from the Trust and in 1946 CEMA&#x27;s successor, the Arts Council, arranged for a company from the London Old Vic to staff it, thus forming the Bristol Old Vic.

Early members of the company included Peter O&#x27;Toole (making his first appearance in &quot;Major Barbara&quot; in 1956), John Neville, Timothy West, Barbara Leigh-Hunt and Dorothy Tutin. The first artistic director was Hugh Hunt.

An early triumph for the Bristol Old Vic occurred when the 1954 première production of &quot;Salad Days&quot; transferred to the West End and became the longest-running musical on the London stage at that time. The Arts Council remained involved until 1963 when their role was taken over by the City Council. In the same year, the London Old Vic was disbanded and the Bristol company became fully independent. The Bristol Old Vic also put plays on in the council-owned Little Theatre (now the Lantern Hall, part of Bristol Beacon) from then until 1980.

A new theatre complex, designed by Peter Moro, was completed in 1972. The 1903 entrance building was demolished, as were a number of surrounding buildings and, more controversially, the stage area of the 1766 theatre. A new stage and fly tower were built along with technical facilities and offices. The 150-seat New Vic studio theatre (later known as the Studio) was built in place of the old entrance, and the Coopers&#x27; Hall provided the theatre with the grand façade and foyer area it had previously lacked.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Bristol Old Vic productions were well received both locally and on tour, but by the late 1980s faced significant underfunding. A revival under the leadership of Andrew (Andy) Hay brought an increase in audience numbers; there followed a new Arts Council funding package, and in 2003 the appointment of joint artistic directors David Farr and Simon Reade. They briefly branded the organisation the &quot;new bristol old vic&quot;.

In 2005, Reade became the sole artistic director. Artistic highlights during these times included the production of A. C. H. Smith&#x27;s &quot;Up The Feeder, Down the Mouth and Back Again&quot; during Andy Hay&#x27;s tenure, and some well-received Shakespeare productions under David Farr and Simon Reade.

== Refurbishment ==
In July 2007, the board of trustees took the controversial decision to close the theatre for refurbishment. Many members of the theatre profession feared for the future of the Old Vic. Following several public meetings in the winter of 2007/2008, a newly formed board of trustees appointed Dick Penny, the director of the Watershed Media Centre as executive chairman.

In February 2009, the company announced that Tom Morris, at that time an associate director at the Royal National Theatre and formerly artistic director at Battersea Arts Centre, had been appointed as artistic director. Emma Stenning, who had previously worked with Tom Morris at BAC, became executive director.

In October 2010, there was a merger of the Old Vic and the Theatre Royal Bristol Trust, into a combined charity to be chaired by Laura Marshall, the managing director of Icon Films.
A fundraising campaign for the £19 million planned refurbishment was assisted by appearances from, among others, Richard Briers, Stephanie Cole, Judi Dench, Prunella Scales, Timothy West and Patrick Stewart. £5.3 million was provided by the Arts Council. During the closure the company staged productions in the Studio theatre, the Basement and in other locations around Bristol, including Sally Cookson&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; on King Street in summer 2011 and Melly Still&#x27;s revival of &quot;Coram Boy&quot; at the Colston Hall at Christmas 2011.

The plan was for a flexible theatre complex, where up to ten areas are available for performance. Tom Morris has cited as inspiration the Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord in Paris. The main auditorium gained an optional thrust stage, and an increase in seating to 540. The Side Stage area was redeveloped, with additional capacity of 250, creating the option of a separate second auditorium. Other spaces redeveloped as performance areas included the Paint Shop and the rehearsal room. The Theatre Royal re-opened in September 2012, with &quot;Wild Oats&quot;.

A further round of redevelopment was undertaken between June 2016 and September 2018. The street side of the 1970s Peter Moro building, containing the Studio theatre (originally the New Vic), was demolished and replaced by a new foyer with bar and box office, which makes a feature of the previously hidden theatre walls. The Coopers&#x27; Hall was adapted to house new performance and event spaces, including a studio theatre in the barrel vaults in its basement.

== Touring ==
The Bristol Old Vic has a long history of taking productions on tour both within the United Kingdom and overseas. Production which have toured include &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; and &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; to Ceylon and Pakistan in 1962–63; &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; to America, Holland and Belgium in 1966–67 and &quot;Man and Superman&quot; to the June Schauspielhaus Festival in Zurich, 1958.
The company has also made frequent visits to the Edinburgh Festival and productions have toured to the Theatre Royal Bath, Oxford Playhouse, Royal Court Theatre, London and the Young Vic, London amongst others. Co-productions have taken Bristol Old Vic plays to most of Britain&#x27;s major theatres. Bristol Old Vic has co-produced with companies such as Kneehigh Theatre, the Royal National Theatre, West Yorkshire Playhouse and other regional theatres and companies across the UK.

Tom Morris’ production of Swallows and Amazons transferred to the Vaudeville Theatre in London&#x27;s West End followed by a major UK tour. Simon Godwin&#x27;s production of Brian Friel&#x27;s Faith Healer is playing in the 2012 Hong Kong Arts Festival. Other recent touring productions include the Bristol Old Vic/Shakespeare at the Tobacco Factory co-production of Uncle Vanya.

Bristol Old Vic&#x27;s Ferment artist development strand also sees work developed at the theatre touring across the UK and internationally.

== Artistic directors of the Bristol Old Vic ==
== Bristol Old Vic Theatre School ==
The Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, opened by Laurence Olivier in 1946, is an affiliate of the Conservatoire for Dance and Drama, an organisation securing the highest standards of training in the performing arts, and is an associate school of the University of the West of England. The School began life in October 1946, only eight months after the founding of its parent Bristol Old Vic Theatre Company, in a room above a fruit merchant&#x27;s warehouse in the Rackhay near the stage door of the Theatre Royal. (The yard of the derelict St Nicholas School adjacent to the warehouse was still used by the company for rehearsals of crowd scenes and stage fights as late as the early 1960s, notably for John Hale&#x27;s productions of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; starring the Canadian actor Paul Massie and Annette Crosbie, a former student of the School, and Rostand&#x27;s &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; with Peter Wyngarde. Students from the Theatre School frequently played in these crowd scenes and fights.)

The School continued in these premises until 1954 when royalties from the musical, &quot;Salad Days&quot; by Julian Slade and Dorothy Reynolds were given to the School towards the purchase and conversion of two large adjoining Victorian villas in Clifton, which remain their base today.

In 1995, that donation was formally recognised when a new custom-built dance and movement studio in the School&#x27;s back garden was named the &quot;Slade/Reynolds Studio&quot;. The School provides comprehensive training courses for theatre, radio, film, and television professionals and its graduates are to be found in key positions as actors, directors, set designers, costumer designers, lighting designers and stage and company managers throughout the world.

Among the most notable of the many distinguished actors on the School&#x27;s list of alumni are the Academy Award winners Daniel Day-Lewis and Jeremy Irons.

See Alumni of Bristol Old Vic Theatre School.

=== Peter O&#x27;Toole Prize ===

To coincide with their re-opening in 2012, the theatre launched an award called the Patron&#x27;s Prize, which was later renamed the Peter O’Toole prize following the actor&#x27;s death. The award is a six-month contract at the Bristol Old Vic offered to two graduating actors from the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. The inaugural winners were Emily May Smith and Isaac Stanmore.

<doc id="728806" wikidata="Q6794920" url="?curid=728806" title="Max Kellerman">
<text>Max Kellerman (born August 6, 1973) is an American sports television personality and boxing commentator. Until his departure from ESPN in June 2023, he was the host of &quot;This Just In with Max Kellerman&quot; and the co-host of &quot;Keyshawn, JWill and Max&quot; on ESPN Radio. He previously was a co-host of ESPN talk show &quot;First Take&quot; alongside Stephen A. Smith and Molly Qerim. He also previously was the co-host of the sports radio talk show &quot;Max &amp; Marcellus&quot;, with Marcellus Wiley, on ESPNLA. Kellerman hosted the ESPN panel talk show &quot;Around the Horn&quot; from the show&#x27;s inception in 2002 until 2004 and co-hosted the sports comedy talk show &quot;SportsNation&quot;, alongside Wiley and Michelle Beadle, from 2013 until 2016. He was also a studio commentator with Brian Kenny on &quot;Friday Night Fights&quot; and a color commentator for &quot;HBO World Championship Boxing&quot; and &quot;Boxing After Dark&quot;.

== Career ==

=== Sports broadcasting ===
Kellerman&#x27;s first broadcasting experience was as a teenager on a New York City public-access television cable TV program on professional boxing called &quot;Max on Boxing&quot;. Given the medium, the show was quite simple but nevertheless caught the attention of the boxing community, including a young Mike Tyson.

In the late 1990s after graduating from Columbia University with a degree in history, Kellerman was hired as an analyst on ESPN&#x27;s boxing series &quot;Friday Night Fights&quot; where he met future radio partner Brian Kenny. In November 2002 he was given his own show and, influenced by &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot;, became the architect and original host of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Around the Horn&quot;. While the show was incredibly popular, Kellerman and ESPN could not reach an agreement for him to remain with the network, and Kellerman left the network in early 2004 to host a new show called &quot;I, Max&quot; on Fox Sports Net. He would discuss sports news with Michael Holley, former &quot;Around the Horn&quot; panelist, and Bill Wolff.

Max took time off from the show after the death of his brother. He later returned, but despite his show garnering the network&#x27;s highest ratings for a period of time, it was canceled by Fox. The last &quot;I, Max&quot; show aired on February 18, 2005. Max also was the co-host of Spike TV&#x27;s 2006 series, &quot;King of Vegas&quot;.

In 2005, Tucker Carlson announced that Kellerman would be a permanent contributor on his MSNBC show &quot;Tucker&quot;. On a segment of the show called &quot;The Outsider&quot;, Kellerman generally took the position selected by Carlson. Frequently, Carlson introduced Kellerman with a bio containing a humorously enthusiastic compliment. The show was canceled in March 2008.

Starting in the week of August 21, 2006, Kellerman did at least two nights of audition shows at 7 pm for WEPN, a ESPN Radio station in New York City, hosting one night with Sid Rosenberg. On August 28, 2006, it was announced that Brandon Tierney would be taking over at 7 pm, which temporarily left Kellerman without a timeslot. On October 23, 2006, Max began hosting the 10 am to noon program on WEPN, replacing ESPN&#x27;s nationally broadcast Colin Cowherd program.

In September 2007, Kellerman began hosting a third hour, extending the show to 1 pm. Two months later, ESPNEWS and SportsCenter host Brian Kenny joined the show as co-host. On February 4, 2008, the show was added to XM Radio on ESPN Xtra. In the fall of 2008, Kenny left the radio program to attend to his SportsCenter duties and the program was again named &quot;The Max Kellerman Show&quot;.

Kellerman and ESPN Radio mutually ended their relationship on March 9, 2009. Evening host Brandon Tierney temporarily filled in Kellerman, and Colin Cowherd took his timeslot.

Kellerman continued his boxing broadcast work at HBO. He was originally hired for the network&#x27;s &quot;Boxing After Dark&quot; telecasts, working alongside Fran Charles and Lennox Lewis. In 2007, Kellerman moved up to the &quot;HBO World Championship Boxing&quot; main team alongside Jim Lampley, Harold Lederman, and a rotating guest analyst, usually Roy Jones Jr. or Emanuel Steward.

On May 12, 2010, it was announced Kellerman had been hired by CNN: &quot;Kellerman will weigh in on sports and pop culture issues on &quot;CNN American Morning&quot; and other programs. He has previously served as a contributor to MSNBC.&quot;

Kellerman was announced in December 2010 as the new midday host at ESPN Radio station KSPN in Los Angeles, alongside former NFL player co-host Marcellus Wiley, replacing LA Sports Live with Andrew Siciliano and former NBA player Mychal Thompson. Program director Mike Thompson (no relation to Mychal Thompson), who hired Kellerman, had worked with Kellerman at WEPN.

In May 2015, Kellerman covered the Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao boxing match for HBO. He received criticism online for his post-match interview with Manny Pacquiao. &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that his line of questioning was, &quot;interpreted as patronizing&quot; as his wording to Pacquiao was &quot;You thought you won today, Why?&quot; However, Kellerman retorted that he &quot;had to ask him&quot; about his disagreement with the judges&#x27; adjudication.

Kellerman replaced Skip Bayless on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;First Take&quot; as co-analyst alongside Stephen A. Smith and host Molly Qerim, effective July 25, 2016.
With HBO leaving the boxing business at the end of 2018, Kellerman signed a multiyear contract with ESPN which greatly expanded his role in the network&#x27;s boxing coverage. However, in contrast to his color-commentary role with HBO, for ESPN he presided over network coverage from the broadcast desk rather than at ringside.

Kellerman departed from &quot;First Take&quot; in September 2021 after Stephen A. Smith requested his removal, citing a lack of chemistry necessary for the show’s long-term success. Kellerman was subsequently laid off from ESPN in June 2023.

=== Acting ===
Kellerman made a brief appearance in the 2006 film &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot; alongside Lampley and Merchant, who served as the broadcast team for the fight between Rocky and Mason &quot;The Line&quot; Dixon. He would also make an appearance in the 2015 film &quot;Creed&quot;, as the reporter interviewing Donnie Creed at the conclusion of his fight with &quot;Pretty&quot; Ricky Conlan.
Kellerman played himself in the short film &quot;The Wedding Bout&quot;.

Kellerman played himself in &quot;Real Husbands of Hollywood&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Kellerman was born in The Bronx, and grew up in the Greenwich Village area of New York City. He graduated from New York City&#x27;s PS 41 in Greenwich Village, Hunter College High School in 1991 and, later, Columbia University in 1998.

His younger brother Sam was a freelance writer who also covered professional boxing. In 2004, Sam&#x27;s body was found inside his apartment in Los Angeles. As a result of the ensuing investigation, former boxer James Butler was arrested and charged with Sam&#x27;s murder. He later confessed to voluntary manslaughter and arson and was given a 29-year sentence.

Kellerman and his wife have three daughters.

Kellerman pointed out on &quot;Tucker&quot; that &quot;Max&quot; is not short for anything, and that he does not have a middle name. He is active in Jewish cultural activities and, according to &quot;The Forward&quot; and the Yiddish Book Center, speaks Yiddish. A hip hop fan, evidenced by his intro music on his ESPN Radio show, Kellerman&#x27;s favorite artists include the Wu-Tang Clan, having stated on his radio show that Raekwon&#x27;s &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...&quot; is one of his favorite albums. He was a member of a hip-hop group with his brother Sam, under the name &quot;Max and Sam&quot;. They were signed under Columbia Records in 1994 and recorded a music video titled &quot;Young Man Rumble&quot;.

Kellerman has a small permanent scar on the left side of his mouth from a childhood accident with an electrical outlet.

Kellerman is a fan of the New York Giants and New York Yankees.

<text>Gustaf Nils Algernon Adolf Stierneld (12 July 1791 – 14 November 1868) was a Swedish nobleman and non-political politician, serving twice as Prime Minister for Foreign Affairs during an important period in Swedish politics. He was the only child of Adolf Ludvig Stierneld, one of the most famous document forgers in Swedish history.
== Biography ==

Gustaf Algernon Stierneld was born to Adolf Ludvig Stierneld, one of the best and most prolific document forgers in Swedish history, and his wife Charlotte Gyldenstolpe, daughter of Nils Philip Gyldenstolpe. He attended the Caroline College of Brunswick between 1803–1806, prior to his studies at Kiel University in 1806, the University of Edinburgh in 1807, and Uppsala University in 1810 respectively.

On 26 October 1811, he held office as Second Secretary of the King&#x27;s Cabinet for Foreign Correspondence and served the chancellery of Charles, Crown Prince of Sweden during the German Campaign of 1813 and the French Campaign of 1814. He participated in the Conferences of Trachenberg and Frankfurt, as well as the Peace Congress of Kiel; the latter of which resulted in the Treaty of Kiel, where Frederick VI, King of Denmark ceded the Kingdom of Norway to Charles XIII, King of Sweden in return for Swedish Pomerania. Between 1818–1828 and 1838–1842, he served as Envoy of the Kingdom of Sweden to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and Prime Minister for Foreign Affairs respectively, offices which granted him the title of &quot;Lord of the Realm&quot;. Due to political strife however, the office was &quot;de facto&quot; served by Albrecht Elof Ihre since 5 September 1840.

He married Dorotea Anna Josefina von Engeström, daughter of Lars von Engeström, on 15 November 1803 in Stockholm. They only had one child: Charlotta Rosalia Maria Dorotea. When his wife died on 29 October 1823 in Hyères, he remarried with his cousin Jacquette Vilhelmina Gyldenstolpe, daughter of Carl Edvard Gyldenstolpe, on 21 April 1828 in Stockholm. They three children: Charlotta Vilhelmina Ulrika, Charlotta Lovisa Aurora and Emilia Aurora Charlotta. He was the owner of Ulvåsa Manor and Händelö Manor, both located in Östergötland, and when he died on 14 November 1868, the estates was inherited to his wife.
