<text>The Clancy Brothers were an influential Irish folk music group that developed initially as a part of the American folk music revival. Most popular during the 1960s, they were famed for their Aran jumpers and are widely credited with popularising Irish traditional music in the United States and revitalising it in Ireland. This contributed to an Irish folk boom with groups like the Dubliners and the Wolfe Tones.

The Clancy Brothers – Paddy, Tom and Liam – are known best for their work with Tommy Makem, recording almost two dozen albums together as The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. Makem left in 1969, the first of many changes in the group&#x27;s membership. The most notable subsequent member to join was the fourth Clancy brother, Bobby. The group continued in various formations until Paddy Clancy&#x27;s death in 1998.

The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem significantly influenced the young Bob Dylan and other artists, including Christy Moore and Paul Brady. The group was famous for its often lively arrangements of old Irish ballads, rebel and drinking songs, sea shanties and other traditional music.

==History==
===Original group with Tommy Makem===
====Early years====
The oldest member of the group, Paddy Clancy, was born on 7 March 1922 in Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary, Ireland. Tom followed on 29 October 1924, Bobby on 14 May 1927, and youngest brother Liam Clancy on 2 September 1935. Tommy Makem was born 4 November 1932 in Keady, County Armagh, Northern Ireland.

After serving in World War II in the Royal Air Force, Paddy and Tom emigrated from England to Toronto in 1947 on the S.S. Marine Flasher, accompanying 400 war brides. The only men on board were Paddy, Tom, their friend Pa Casey and the ship&#x27;s sailors. Once in Toronto, Paddy and Tom worked various odd jobs before coming to the United States two years later, through the sponsorship of two aunts. Residing for a time in Cleveland, Ohio, the two brothers began to dabble in acting. They decided to move to Hollywood, but their car broke down soon after the trip began. They relocated to the New York City area instead.

Arriving in Greenwich Village in Manhattan in 1951, Tom and Paddy established themselves as successful Broadway and Off-Broadway actors. They also made several television appearances. The two brothers created their own production company, Trio Productions, which led to the start of their professional singing careers. To help raise money for the company, Paddy and Tom organised late-night concerts of folk songs called the &#x27;Swapping Song Fair&#x27; (later renamed the &#x27;Midnight Special&#x27;) every Saturday night at the Cherry Lane Theatre, which they were renting at the time to produce Irish plays. Here they would sing some of the old Irish songs that they knew from their childhood. Some well-known folk singers, including Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, and Jean Ritchie, also participated in these concerts. At this time, younger brother Bobby Clancy briefly emigrated to New York City, joining his brothers in Greenwich Village. This was the little-known, first &#x27;unofficial&#x27; line-up of singing Clancy brothers.

In 1955, Bobby returned home to Carrick-on-Suir to take over father Robert J. Clancy&#x27;s insurance business, freeing youngest brother Liam Clancy to emigrate to New York City to pursue his dream of acting. Liam arrived in New York in January 1956.

A month earlier, Tommy Makem emigrated to the United States from his hometown of Keady. Tommy had met Liam Clancy shortly before they both emigrated. Diane Hamilton, a friend of Paddy Clancy in New York, followed in the footsteps of her mentor, Jean Ritchie, and came to Ireland in search of rare Irish songs. Her first stop was at the Clancy household, where she recorded several members of the family, including the Clancys&#x27; mother, sisters Peg and Joan, and nineteen-year-old Liam Clancy. Hamilton asked Liam and recently returned Bobby Clancy to join her on a trek through Ireland to locate and record source singers.

One of those source singers was Sarah Makem who had been recorded by Jean Ritchie in 1952 on a similar search for authentic Irish folk songs. Her son Tommy Makem, then twenty-two, and the young Liam Clancy instantly became friends. Said Liam, &quot;Our interests were so similar: girls, theatre and music. He had told me he was going to America to try his luck at acting. We agreed to keep in touch.&quot; Tommy was recorded for the first time by Hamilton in that autumn of 1955. Among the songs he sang was &quot;The Cobbler&quot;, which he continued to perform throughout his career.

====Group&#x27;s formation and Tradition Records====

In March 1956, Tommy Makem was unemployed. He had recently moved to Dover, New Hampshire, where many of his family members had emigrated to work in the local cotton mills. He had found a job there making printing presses but had an accident when a two-ton steel press that he was guiding with his hand broke from its chain. The falling press tore the tendons from the bone in three of the fingers of his left hand. His hand in a sling, and knowing the Clancy brothers in New York, he decided that he would like to make a record with them. He told this to Paddy Clancy, who with the sponsorship of Diane Hamilton and the assistance of his brother Liam founded a record company, Tradition Records, in 1956. Paddy agreed and together he, Tom, Liam, and Tommy Makem recorded an album of Irish rebel songs, &quot;The Rising of the Moon&quot;, one of the new label&#x27;s first releases. Paddy&#x27;s harmonica provided the only musical accompaniment for the first version of this debut album. It was re-recorded in 1959 with the addition of supporting musicians.

Little thought was given to continuing as a singing group. They all were busy establishing theatrical careers for themselves, in addition to their work at Tradition Records. But the album was a local success and requests were often demanded for the brothers and Tommy Makem to sing some of their songs at parties and informal pub settings. Slowly, the singing gigs began to outweigh the acting gigs and by 1959, serious thought was given to a new album. Liam had developed some guitar skills, Tommy&#x27;s hand had healed enough he was again able to play tin whistle and Uilleann pipes, and the times spent singing together had improved their style. No longer were they the rough, mostly unaccompanied group of actors singing for an album to jumpstart a record label; they were becoming a professional singing group.

The release of their second album, this one of Irish drinking songs called &quot;Come Fill Your Glass with Us&quot;, solidified their new careers as singers. The album was a success, and they made many appearances on the pub circuit in New York, Chicago, and Boston. It was at their first official gig after &quot;Come Fill Your Glass With Us&quot; that the group finally found a name for themselves. The nightclub owner asked for a name to put on the marquee, but they had not decided on one yet. Unable to agree on a name (which included suggestions like The Beggermen, The Tinkers and even The Chieftains) the owner decided for them, simply billing them as &quot;The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem&quot;. The name stuck. They decided to try singing full-time for six months. If their singing was successful, they would continue with it; if not, then they would return to acting. The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem proved successful as a singing group and in early 1961, they attracted the attention of scouts from &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.

====Famous sweaters and initial success====
The Clancy Brothers&#x27; mother read news of the terrible ice and snow storms in New York City and sent Aran jumpers (sweaters) for her sons and Tommy Makem to keep them warm. They wore the sweaters for the first time at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan, simply as part of their regular winter clothes. When the group&#x27;s manager Marty Erlichman, who had been searching for a special &quot;look&quot; for the group, saw the sweaters, he exclaimed, &quot;That&#x27;s it! That&#x27;s it! That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going to wear.&quot; Ehrlichman requested that the group wear the sweaters on their upcoming television appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. After they did, the sales of Aran sweaters rose by 700% according to Liam Clancy, and they soon became the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem&#x27;s trademark costume.
Vawn Corrigan has stated that this was not an idle boast and that the number was probably even higher as much of the export sales of Arans happened unofficially and were not therefore properly accounted.

On 12 March 1961, the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem performed for around fifteen minutes in front of a television audience of forty million people for the first time on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. A previously scheduled artist did not appear that night, and the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem were given the newly available time slot on the show, in addition to the two songs they had initially planned to do. The televised performance and the success of the Clancys&#x27; and Makem&#x27;s nightclub performances attracted the attention of John Hammond of Columbia Records. The group was offered a five-year contract with an advance of $100,000, a huge sum in 1961. For their first album with Columbia, &quot;A Spontaneous Performance Recording&quot;, they enlisted Pete Seeger, one of the leaders of the American Folk Revival, as backup banjo player. The record included songs that would soon become classics for the group, such as &quot;Brennan on the Moor&quot;, &quot;Jug of Punch&quot;, &quot;Reilly&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, &quot;Finnegan&#x27;s Wake&quot;, &quot;Haul Away Joe&quot;, &quot;Roddy McCorley&quot;, &quot;Portlairge&quot; and &quot;The Moonshiner&quot;. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Folk Recording in 1962. 

Around the same time that they recorded &quot;A Spontaneous Performance&quot;, the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem cut their final, eponymous album with Tradition Records. By the end of 1962, they released a second album with Columbia, &quot;Hearty and Hellish! A Live Nightclub Performance&quot;, and they played an acclaimed concert at Carnegie Hall. Additionally, they were making appearances on major radio and television talk shows in America.

====International stardom====
In late 1962 Ciarán Mac Mathúna, a popular radio personality in Ireland, first heard of the group while visiting America. He collected their first three Columbia albums, &quot;A Spontaneous Performance Recording&quot;, &quot;Hearty and Hellish!&quot;, and &quot;The Boys Won&#x27;t Leave the Girls Alone&quot;, brought them back home to Ireland, and played them on his radio show. The broadcasts brought the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem to fame in Ireland, where they had been unknown. In Ireland, songs like &quot;Roddy McCorley&quot;, &quot;Kevin Barry&quot; and &quot;Brennan on the Moor&quot; were slow, moving songs, but the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem had transformed those songs (some purists in Ireland argued, &quot;commercialized&quot;) and made them lively. The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem were brought over for a sold-out tour of Ireland in late 1963. Popularity in England and other parts of Europe soon followed, as well as in Australia and Canada.

By 1963, appearing on major talk shows in America, Canada, England, Australia and Ireland, as well as their own TV specials, the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem were &quot;the most famous four Irishmen in the world&quot;, according to Ireland&#x27;s &quot;Late Late Show&quot; host Gay Byrne in a retrospective interview in 1984. &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; reported that the group was outselling Elvis Presley in Ireland, adding that this was &quot;a most unusual situation&quot; for folk singers. In 1964, almost one-third of all the albums sold in Ireland were Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem records.

The 1960s continued to be a successful decade with the release of approximately two albums per year, all of which sold millions of copies. In 1963 they made a prestigious televised appearance in front of President John F. Kennedy. Makem rewrote an old song, &quot;We Want No Irish Here&quot;, expressly for the occasion.

In late 1963, the group released its most successful album, &quot;In Person at Carnegie Hall&quot;, which spent twelve weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart for the top 150 albums of any genre in release in the United States. It broke the top 50 albums in December, an unprecedented occurrence for an Irish folk music recording. The Clancy Brothers&#x27; follow-up album, &quot;The First Hurrah!&quot;, also charted in the top 100 albums in the US in 1964. A single taken from that album, &quot;The Leaving of Liverpool&quot;, was a top ten hit in Ireland. Another album, &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Grand Boys&quot;, appeared on the British charts in 1965. In the mid-1960s, the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem continued to release live albums: &quot;Recorded Live in Ireland&quot;, &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Sons&quot;, and &quot;In Concert&quot;. In 1966, they also participated in the making of &quot;The Irish Uprising&quot;, an educational recording with music, speeches, and a historical booklet, celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Easter Uprising.

The group&#x27;s popularity in the 1960s was the result of several factors. There was already an American folk revival beginning in the United States, and men such as Ewan MacColl popularising old songs on the other side of the Atlantic. But it was the Clancys&#x27; boisterous performances that set them apart, taking placid classics and giving them a boost of energy and spirit (not that they took this approach with all their songs; they would still sing the true mournful ballads with due reverence). However, by the late 1960s, the ballad and folk boom was waning. In an attempt to keep the Clancys profitable, Teo Macero, who usually worked on jazz albums, began producing their records for Columbia. Macero introduced new instrumentation to the Clancys&#x27; music, including bringing in Louis Killen to play back-up concertina, particularly on their 1968 album of sea songs, &quot;Sing of the Sea&quot;. Their last three albums for Columbia Records in 1969 and 1970 represent a significant shift in style for the group, with a multitude of string instruments and synthesizers added to the simpler traditional Clancy mix of guitar, banjo, tin whistle, and harmonica.

In 1969, the group recorded a song for a two-minute-long TV ad for Gulf Oil: &quot;Bringin&#x27; Home the Oil&quot;. They adapted a traditional Scottish tune they had recorded, &quot;The Gallant Forty Twa&quot;, with new words about large-capacity supertankers. The song and commercial featured the then-largest supertanker in the world, the &quot;Universe Ireland&quot;, which operated with sister ships &quot;Universe Kuwait&quot;, &quot;Universe Japan&quot; and &quot;Universe Portugal&quot;, all mentioned in the song and which operated from the seaport at Bantry Bay.

===Later line-ups===

====Changes in the group====

A major change occurred in 1969 when Tommy Makem amicably left the group after cutting one more album with the Clancys, &quot;The Bold Fenian Men&quot;. After a year&#x27;s notice, Makem departed in April to pursue a solo career, armed with such recent compositions as &quot;Four Green Fields&quot;, which had debuted on the 1968 album, &quot;Home Boys Home&quot;. He later explained his grounds for leaving: &quot;The reason I wanted to leave was that I found myself in a groove—a very comfortable groove where I could make a very good living. But there was no challenge there for me anymore, and I needed that challenge to stimulate myself.&quot;

Another Clancy brother, Bobby, filled Tommy Makem&#x27;s vacancy as the fourth lead vocalist. Two of the Furey Brothers, Finbar and Eddie, also joined at this time as instrumentalists and back-up singers. Paddy asked Finbar Furey if he would play the whistle and five-string banjo with the group. Finbar also added uilleann pipes to his performances, creating a new sound for the group on stage, recordings, and TV. The six-piece band recorded two new albums in the summer of 1969: &quot;Clancy Brothers Christmas&quot;, released later that year, and &quot;Flowers in the Valley&quot;, released in 1970. The latter was their final album for Columbia Records.
Finbar and Eddie Furey left in 1970, and for a short time just the four brothers, Paddy, Tom, Bobby and Liam, performed together. This line-up recorded only one album together, &quot;Welcome to Our House&quot;, in 1970 for their new label, Audio Fidelity Records. Later that same year, Liam and Bobby got into an argument that resulted in Bobby quitting the group. Bobby later said about his younger brother: &quot;With Liam, it was very hard to be equal. I try to make it as equal as possible and everybody&#x27;s happy that way. It makes it a better sound.&quot;

In 1971, the remaining Clancys recruited English folk singer Louis Killen to play the banjo, concertina, and spoons with the group. Together they made two studio albums for Audio Fidelity, &quot;Save the Land&quot; and &quot;Show Me the Way&quot;, on which they experimented with modernising their sound, musical style, and material, even including pop songs like Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Country Comfort&quot;. They recorded their final album for Audio Fidelity, the more traditional &quot;Live on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day&quot;, at the Bushnell Auditorium in Hartford, Connecticut in 1972. It was released the following year.

By the early 1970s, the Clancys reduced their touring schedule to five months a year. The brothers were moving in different directions, and all of them had young families at home. Paddy had moved back to Ireland in 1968. Tom began acting again, first on stage and then on film and television. He relocated to the Los Angeles area in 1975, where he landed parts in the films &quot;The Killer Elite&quot; with James Caan and Robert Duvall and &quot;Swashbuckler&quot; with Robert Shaw. At the same time, Liam wanted to step out from his older brothers&#x27; shadows. According to the 2009 feature documentary, &quot;The Yellow Bittern: The Life and Times of Liam Clancy&quot;, Paddy and Tom Clancy dominated the group in ways that Liam felt were personally limiting. He moved to Calgary, Alberta, Canada in 1972 and began a solo career when not touring with his brothers. In spite of the brothers&#x27; growing distance, the group made one more album with Killen for Vanguard Records, &quot;The Clancy Brothers&#x27; Greatest Hits&quot;, as well as several television appearances on the &quot;Irish Rovers Show&quot; in Canada and a TV special for Brockton television in 1974 (in which Bobby Clancy made a surprise guest appearance).

A scheduling conflict between a tour of Australia and a television role with Tom Clancy provoked Liam to leave the group in early 1976. Tom allegedly accepted a television role over the tour of Australia, even though he had already signed a contract to do the tour. When confronted over the conflict, Liam later recalled Tom telling him, &quot;Get off my fucking back, little brother.&quot; Soon afterwards, their sister Cait Clancy O&#x27;Connell was killed in a car crash. After the funeral in Ireland, Liam told his brothers that they would have to find a replacement for him. &quot;I&#x27;m not going to work with you anymore—I can&#x27;t be the &#x27;little brother&#x27; anymore,&quot; Liam said, according to an interview in &quot;The Yellow Bittern&quot;. Louis Killen left as well, and Paddy and Tom decided to take a short hiatus from singing.

The temporary dissolution of the group permitted Paddy Clancy to devote his full attention to the dairy and cattle breeding farm in Tipperary he had bought with his wife in 1963. Tom&#x27;s acting career flourished in Hollywood, where he regularly appeared in movies, TV films and shows, such as &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; and &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;. Liam, suffering financial setbacks due to tax problems, filed for bankruptcy and moved to his sister-in-law&#x27;s house in Calgary. His brother-in-law helped to get him some concert dates there. Liam was introduced to &quot;The Dutchman&quot; at this time, which became one of his most popular songs. His gigs in Calgary caught the attention of a TV producer, who signed Liam to host twenty-six episodes of his own music and talk show. In the final episode, Tommy Makem appeared as a guest. This led the two of them to be signed together for twenty-six additional episodes. Their program was called &quot;The Makem &amp; Clancy Show.&quot; The success of the show led them to form the group Makem and Clancy. After several albums and tours, an American television series, and thirteen years together, the duo split up in 1988.

====Robbie O&#x27;Connell joins====
Meanwhile, after taking the rest of 1976 off, Paddy and Tom made plans to bring back the Clancy Brothers. They asked Bobby Clancy to return to the group. Tom was at the height of his new career in Hollywood and Paddy was busy with his farm, so it was ultimately decided to tour on a part-time basis and only in the United States. Their recently deceased sister Cait&#x27;s son, Robbie O&#x27;Connell, was an up-and-coming musician in the US and in Ireland; he was also helping manage, along with Bobby, the inn that Cait had opened up years before. They asked him to take on the role Liam had vacated in the group. He played the guitar and occasionally the mandolin, while Bobby played the banjo, guitar, harmonica, and bodhrán. Paddy continued to play the lead harmonica.
Beginning in 1977, the Clancy Brothers and Robbie O&#x27;Connell toured three months a year in March, August, and November. Tom would fly over a few days before each tour and rehearse material, mostly oldies from their 1960s albums but some new ones as well. Robbie was a songwriter, composing several numbers the group sang regularly, such as &quot;Bobby&#x27;s Britches&quot;, &quot;Ferrybank Piper&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Not Irish&quot;. He also included songs written by others, such as &quot;Dear Boss&quot;, &quot;Sister Josephine&quot;, &quot;John O&#x27;Dreams&quot;, &quot;There Were Roses&quot;, and what is possibly his signature song, &quot;Killkelly&quot;. Bobby also sang numbers new to the group, including &quot;Love of the North&quot;, &quot;Song for Ireland&quot;, and &quot;Anne Boleyn&quot;. In America, the Clancy Brothers continued where they had left off the previous year, still packing Carnegie Hall. Reviews cited Robbie as a fresh addition to the group with his original compositions.

Over the next several years, Paddy and Tom brought in some new material too. &quot;The Green Fields of France&quot;, also known as &quot;Willie McBride&quot;, by Eric Bogle had become a hit with a recording by the Clancys&#x27; old back-up musicians, the Furey Brothers, in the early 1980s. Soon numerous Irish groups were singing it, including the Clancy Brothers and Makem and Clancy. It became a staple in Tom&#x27;s repertoire. He also sang &quot;Logger Lover&quot;. The group added new lyrics to the old Irish ballad, &quot;She Didn&#x27;t Dance&quot;, and reworked old classics, such as &quot;As I Roved Out&quot;, &quot;Beer, Beer, Beer&quot;, and &quot;Rebellion 1916 Medley&quot;. Some of these songs appeared on the Clancy Brothers&#x27; first album in nine years, &quot;The Clancy Brothers with Robbie O&#x27;Connell Live!&quot; (1982).

In the summer of 1983, the group travelled to their hometown in Ireland to film a 20-minute special on sea songs, sung on location on the fishing ships in the area. It was called &quot;Songs of the Sea.&quot; Directed by Irish filmmaker David Donaghy, it was broadcast on the BBC Northern Ireland. Tom tried on many occasions to put it on videocassette but the plans fell through.

====Reunion====
In 1984, Makem and Clancy&#x27;s manager Maurice Cassidy brought the original foursome together again for a documentary to be followed by a concert at Lincoln Center in New York City. Paddy and Tom Clancy took some time out from the Clancy Brothers and Robbie O&#x27;Connell and joined forces with Makem and Clancy. Paddy, Tom, Liam, and Tommy Makem were reunited, and production on the documentary commenced after a 90-minute debut on Ireland&#x27;s &quot;Late Late Show&quot; on 28 April. The documentary crew followed the group around, travelling to Carrick-on-Suir, Keady, Greenwich Village, a dress rehearsal concert at Tommy Makem&#x27;s Irish Pavilion on East 57th Street, and finally Lincoln Center for the recorded concert on 20 May 1984. The 3,000-seat Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center had sold out for the show within a week. The rowdy audience provided enthusiastic participation on the album, released as &quot;Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem Reunion&quot;. A reunion tour of Ireland, England, and the United States followed in late 1984 and the fall of 1985. After the tour, Makem and Clancy and the Clancy Brothers and Robbie O&#x27;Connell respectively regrouped.

====In the late 1980s and 1990s====
In 1988, the Clancy Brothers (Paddy, Tom, and Bobby) with Robbie O&#x27;Connell recorded a poorly mixed live album at St. Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire, &quot;Tunes &#x27;n&#x27; Tales of Ireland&quot;. Bobby Clancy called this album &quot;crap&quot;, and Paddy referred to it as &quot;not our best effort&quot;. Regardless, the album is notable as Tom Clancy&#x27;s final record.

In May 1990, Tom Clancy was diagnosed with stomach cancer. When he had surgery later in the summer, Liam filled in for him during the Clancy Brothers and Robbie O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s August tour. The surgery proved unsuccessful, and Tom Clancy died at the age of 66 on 7 November 1990. He left behind a wife, a son, and five daughters. His youngest daughter was only two years old at the time.

With the death of Tom Clancy, Liam again stepped in full-time with his brothers. This line-up experienced a more active schedule than the group had during the previous decade, with appearances on Regis and Kathie Lee in 1991, 1993 and 1995, a performance at the 30th Anniversary Bob Dylan concert at Madison Square Garden in 1992, seen by 20,000 live and 200 million people worldwide on television, and the formation of Irish Festival Cruises in 1991, an annual cruise of the Caribbean with live folk music. They also brought their own tour groups to Ireland, which Robbie O&#x27;Connell continues to do to this day.

The Bob Dylan concert inspired the recording of the first studio album by the Clancy Brothers in over twenty years, since 1973&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. Released in late 1995, &quot;Older But No Wiser&quot; introduced all newly recorded songs with the exception of &quot;When the Ship Comes In&quot;, which the group performed at the Dylan concert. It was the only recording to feature the line-up of Paddy, Bobby, Liam Clancy, and Robbie O&#x27;Connell. &quot;Older But No Wiser&quot; was the Clancy Brothers&#x27; final album.

The Irish Festival Cruises had led to financial disputes between Paddy and Liam. Liam decided to leave the group because of this. Robbie O&#x27;Connell, now with the group for nineteen years, was ready for a change as well. The two left the Clancy Brothers together and formed their own duo, simply called Liam Clancy and Robbie O&#x27;Connell. Before splitting up, the Clancy brothers and Robbie O&#x27;Connell gave a Farewell Tour of Ireland and America in February and March 1996. One performance in Clonmel as part of their Irish tour was televised and later released on video and DVD as &quot;The Clancy Brothers and Robbie O&#x27;Connell: Farewell to Ireland&quot;. On the album &quot;Older But No Wiser&quot; and the concert video &quot;Farewell to Ireland&quot;, respectively, two sons of the Clancy brothers made their recording debuts. Dónal Clancy, Liam&#x27;s youngest son, played backup on the studio album, while Bobby&#x27;s son Finbarr Clancy performed with the group on the filmed &quot;Farewell&quot; concert. Bobby was not well at this time and Finbarr was brought on, in part, to aid his father for this concert. He had first performed with the group the previous year as a replacement for his father when he had heart surgery. Finbarr did not join them for the American tour.

====Later groupings====
After the break-up, Paddy and Bobby continued touring as the Clancy Brothers, with Bobby&#x27;s son Finbarr Clancy becoming an official member of the group. The trio added a longtime friend of Bobby&#x27;s daughter Aoife, Eddie Dillon, to the group for a thirteen-city engagement in early 1997. The quartet was known as the Clancy Brothers and Eddie Dillon. Eddie Dillon, a Boston-based musician, is the only American ever to perform with the Clancy Brothers.

Liam Clancy and Robbie O&#x27;Connell toured for a while as a duo, but very soon added Liam&#x27;s son Dónal Clancy to the mix, forming the group, Clancy, O&#x27;Connell &amp; Clancy. They released two albums together, an eponymous debut album in 1997 and an album of sea songs in 1998, &quot;The Wild and Wasteful Ocean&quot;. Robbie O&#x27;Connell regards the eponymous &quot;Clancy, O&#x27;Connell and Clancy&quot; album to be his favourite of all his recordings. In 1999, with Liam in Ireland, Robbie in Massachusetts, and Dónal in New York, the trio decided to call it quits as a full-time group. They did, however, occasionally regroup for additional concerts together thereafter.

====Deaths of Paddy and Bobby Clancy====
The other group members as far back as 1996 had noticed Paddy Clancy&#x27;s unusual mood swings. In the spring of 1998, the cause was finally detected; Paddy had a brain tumour as well as lung cancer. His wife waited to tell him about the lung cancer, so as not to discourage him when he had a brain operation. The tumour was removed successfully, but the cancer was terminal. When he was told of the cancer, he accepted the diagnosis &quot;with great bravery and courage&quot;, according to his wife Mary Clancy. Paddy Clancy died in the morning hours of 11 November 1998, at the age of 76. Two weeks before he died, Bobby called Liam and Paddy together to reconcile their differences—they had been at odds for two years since Liam had left the group. The two brothers did reconcile and the three brothers sang together that night at an informal session at their local pub. Liam, Robbie, and Dónal took time out of their November tour of the US to attend Paddy&#x27;s funeral. Old partner Tommy Makem also attended. Paddy Clancy was survived by his wife and five children.

After Paddy Clancy&#x27;s death, Bobby, Finbarr, and Eddie Dillon resumed touring as a trio, The Clancys and Eddie Dillon. This new group recorded a live album in October 1998, &quot;Clancy Sing-a-Long Songs&quot;, and one in March 2001 during Bobby&#x27;s last tour. In 1999 Bobby was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, a lung ailment. During his last years Bobby was unable to stand and perform at the same time because he would quickly run out of breath, so the trio began performing sitting down.

In 2000, the Milwaukee Irish Fest had its twentieth anniversary and in celebration, the festival had the entire performing Clancy family sing together on one stage. This one time-only line-up included Robbie O&#x27;Connell, Dónal, Liam, Bobby, Finbarr, Aoife Clancy, and Eddie Dillon. These festival sets, 18–20 August 2000, were the last times any of the Clancy Brothers appeared onstage together.

By March 2002, Bobby&#x27;s illness had advanced such that he was unable to sing, necessitating Finbarr and Eddie to perform as a duo for their short March 2002 tour. Bobby made one final appearance in February 2002 on an American CBS TV spot promoting Liam&#x27;s autobiography. On 6 September 2002, Bobby Clancy died at the age of seventy-five. He was survived by three daughters, Finbarr, and his wife Moira.

====Liam Clancy&#x27;s later years====
The last surviving Clancy brother, Liam Clancy, continued to tour solo into the twenty-first century. In 2002, Doubleday published his autobiography, &quot;Mountain of the Women: Memoirs of an Irish Troubadour&quot;. The book covers his early years and the initial formation and early successes of the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. Clancy appeared in spots promoting the memoir on American and Irish television. Taking some time off from singing, he came back to the stage in full force in 2005 with his tour, &quot;Seventy Years On&quot;. He sang as part of the Irish Legends act at the Gaiety Theater in Dublin in August 2005 with Ronnie Drew and Paddy Reilly of The Dubliners.

In March 2006, fifty years after the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem recorded their debut album, Conor Murray wrote the first full-length biography on the group. The book, titled &quot;The Clancy Brothers with Tommy Makem &amp; Robbie O&#x27;Connell: The Men Behind the Sweaters&quot;, chronicles the Clancy Brothers from the birth of Paddy Clancy in 1922 to early 2006. In the same year, a two-hour documentary on Liam Clancy was aired on Irish television, &quot;The Legend of Liam Clancy&quot;, as well as a new concert special with Tommy Makem and his sons, the five-piece Irish folk group, The Makem and Spain Brothers.

From 2005 to 2009, Clancy was joined onstage and in the studio by Kevin Evans of Evans and Doherty, with whom he had worked occasionally in the 1990s. His last album, &quot;The Wheels of Life&quot;, was released in October 2008 and featured other prominent musicians, such as Donovan, Mary Black, Gemma Hayes, and Tom Paxton.

Tommy Makem died on 1 August 2007, at the age of 74, after an extended fight with lung cancer. Two years later Liam Clancy died of pulmonary fibrosis, the same ailment that had taken his brother Bobby. He died on 4 December 2009 at the age of 74 in a hospital in Cork, Ireland. He was survived by his wife and seven children.

==Legacy and influence==
===American folk revival===
The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem were significant figures in the American folk revival of the early 1960s and played important roles in promoting and influencing the early development of the folk boom. In December 1964, &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; listed the group as the eleventh best-selling folk musicians in the United States based on sales figures for that year. The Clancys&#x27; friends, Peter, Paul and Mary, Bob Dylan, and Pete Seeger, also appeared on the list in first, seventh, and ninth positions, respectively.

Tradition Records, the small company that Paddy Clancy ran with the help of his brothers, recorded several significant figures of the folk revival and gave some important musical figures their first start in the recording industry. Tradition produced Odetta&#x27;s first solo LP, &quot;Odetta Sings Ballads and Blues&quot;. Bob Dylan later cited this album as his inspiration to become a folk singer. The success of that record helped to further finance the nascent company and led to an additional LP with Odetta on the Tradition label. After the success of her Tradition records, Vanguard records signed her to a prestigious recording contract that led to many more albums.

The Clancys recorded numerous 1960s folk singers, including Jean Ritchie, Ed McCurdy, Ewan MacColl, Paul Clayton, and John Jacob Niles. Carolyn Hester&#x27;s eponymous album with Tradition led to her first public recognition and her signing with Columbia Records. The Clancys also released the only album on which folk song collector Alan Lomax sang.

Paddy Clancy and Tommy Makem were among the first singers to ever appear at the Newport Folk Festival in 1959. The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem appeared there subsequently several times during the 1960s. The festival is renowned for introducing to a national audience a number of performers who went on to become major stars, most notably Joan Baez and Bob Dylan.

===Influence on Bob Dylan===

The Clancy Brothers were contemporaries of Bob Dylan, and they became friends as they played the clubs of Greenwich Village in New York in the early 1960s. Howard Sounes in his biography of Dylan describes how Dylan listened to the Clancys singing Irish rebel songs like &quot;Roddy McCorley&quot; which he found fascinating, not only in terms of their melodies but also their themes, structures and storytelling techniques. Although the songs were about Irish rebels, they reminded Dylan of American folk heroes. He wanted to write songs on similar themes and with equal depth.

Dylan stopped Liam Clancy and Tommy Makem in the street one day in early 1962 and insisted on singing a new song he had written to the tune of &quot;Brennan On The Moor&quot;, a song from the eponymous &quot;Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem&quot; album on Tradition Records. It was called &quot;Rambling, Gambling Willie&quot; and was Dylan&#x27;s attempt to replicate Irish folk heroes in an American context. Dylan continued to use the melodies of songs from the Clancys&#x27; repertoire for his own lyrics several more times, including &quot;The Leaving of Liverpool&quot; for &quot;Farewell To You My Own True Love&quot;, &quot;The Parting Glass&quot; for &quot;Restless Farewell&quot;, and &quot;The Patriot Game&quot; for &quot;With God on Our Side&quot;.

In an interview with U2&#x27;s Bono from 1984, Dylan recalled: &quot;Irish music has always been a great part of my life because I used to hang out with the Clancy Brothers. They influenced me tremendously.&quot; Later in the interview, he added, &quot;[O]ne of the things I recall from that time is how great they all were—I mean there is no question, but that they were great. But Liam Clancy was always my favourite singer, as a ballad singer. I just never heard anyone as good.&quot;
Dylan reiterated this view on camera for the documentary, &quot;The Story of the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem&quot;.

Dylan never forgot his debt to the Clancys, which is why he invited them to perform at his 30th anniversary concert at Madison Square Garden. It was Dylan&#x27;s wish that the party after the concert be held at Tommy Makem&#x27;s Irish Pavilion, a Manhattan pub owned by Makem. At the exclusive party, attended by George Harrison and Eric Clapton among others, Liam Clancy tentatively asked Dylan if he would mind if the Clancys recorded an album of his songs, arranged in a traditional Irish style. Far from minding, Dylan was flattered by the idea: &quot;Man, would you do that? &quot;Would&quot; you?&quot; He added, &quot;Liam, you don&#x27;t realize, do you, man? You&#x27;re my fucking hero.&quot; Although the group never made an entire album of Dylan&#x27;s music, two of his songs, &quot;When the Ship Comes In&quot; and &quot;Rambin&#x27; Gamblin&#x27; Willie&quot;, appeared on the final Clancy Brothers album, &quot;Older But No Wiser&quot;, three years later. The 1997 eponymous Clancy, O&#x27;Connell, and Clancy album also contained a Dylan number, &quot;Restless Farewell&quot;.

===Irish folk revival===

In assessing the impact of the Clancy Brothers, Irish-American author Frank McCourt wrote in 1999: &quot;They were the first. Before them there were dance bands and show bands and céilidhe bands...but not since John McCormack had Irish singers captured international attention like the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. They opened the gates to the likes of the Dubliners and the Wolfe Tones and every Irish group thereafter.&quot;

Eddie Furey of The Fureys once recalled: &quot;It all starts with the Clancys. They gave us our first break, paved the road for everyone else.&quot; Ronnie Drew of the Dubliners explained about the Clancys effect on the Irish folk scene, &quot;They did open it up&quot;.

In the documentary, &quot;Bringing It All Back Home: The Influence of Irish Music in America&quot;, Christy Moore and Paul Brady cited the Clancy Brothers as sparking their initial interest in Irish folk music. In the same program, Bono proclaimed that he &quot;loved the Clancy Brothers&quot; and asserted that Liam Clancy was &quot;one of the great ballad singers&quot;.

===Continuing legacy===
The musical tradition of The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem is carried on by Makem and Spain and by the group, The Clancy Legacy, which consists of Robbie O&#x27;Connell, Aoife Clancy (daughter of Bobby Clancy) and Dónal Clancy (son of Liam Clancy). Dónal Clancy released his first solo singing folk album in 2013.

Bobby&#x27;s son, Finbarr Clancy is a member of the popular Irish folk band, The High Kings. Aoife Clancy was a member of Cherish the Ladies. She is currently performing as a solo singer, while accompanying herself on guitar. She appeared in 2003 on the WoodSongs Old-Time Radio Hour. In addition to performing with guitarist Ted Davis from Boston, on the show she talked about her work with Cherish the Ladies. Another of Bobby Clancy&#x27;s daughters, Roisin, sometimes performs with her husband, Welsh singer Ryland Teifi.

In 2006 An Post issued 75 cent stamps featuring the classic line up of Bobby, Paddy, Liam and Tommy Makem.

In the brothers&#x27; hometown of Carrick-on-Suir, the Clancy Brothers Festival has taken place every spring since 2008 to commemorate the group&#x27;s achievements and legacy.

In 2010, a new theatre production about the Clancy Brothers entitled, &quot;&#x27;Fine Girl Ye Are&#x27; – The Legendary Story of The Clancy Brothers &amp; Tommy Makem&quot;, commenced a theatrical tour of Ireland. Produced and narrated by RTÉ Producer, Cathal McCabe, the show featured the Irish ballad group, The Kilkennys.

The 2013 film &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot;, directed by the Coen Brothers, includes a performance of the Irish song, &quot;The Auld Triangle&quot;, by four unnamed folk singers in Aran sweaters intended to be Clancy Brother-like figures. Additional characters in the film were modelled after other real-life singers from the Greenwich Village folk scene in 1961, including friends of the Clancy Brothers like Tom Paxton, Bob Dylan, and Jean Ritchie.

In 2018, an Aran jumper was featured in an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York after it was chosen as one of the 111 most iconic fashion garments and accessories over the last century.

==History==
After producing many hits for other record companies, PWL launched its own label in 1987 (PWL Records) with the single &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Wait&quot; by Mandy Smith. After several promos that were eventually licensed to other labels, the next single commercially released on PWL Records (PWL8) was the biggest selling single of 1988: &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot; by Kylie Minogue. Stock Aitken Waterman also used the label to release material under their own name, including top twenty hit, &quot;Roadblock&quot;.

As an independent record label, PWL enjoyed number ones with Australian artists Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan, as well as top ten hits with British artists, such as Pat and Mick, The Reynolds Girls, American singer Sybil Lynch, and Dutch dance group, 2 Unlimited. As a production house, they produced hits for English artists including, Hazell Dean, Rick Astley, Dead or Alive, Bananarama, Sonia, Brother Beyond, Samantha Fox and Mel and Kim, all licensed to other record labels.

In the US, PWL America was established in 1989 and specialized primarily in hip-hop music, launching the careers of MCs Ed O.G. and Diamond D.
In 1992, it was renamed Chemistry Records Ltd., but it shut its doors in 1993. It was distributed in that territory by Mercury/PolyGram Records.

In the early 1990s, Pete Waterman formed a new label called PWL International in partnership with Warner Music; one of the artists that recorded for the label, Opus III, would score two number ones on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance Club Songs Chart through a US deal with Warner&#x27;s EastWest Records. However, with other projects taking up Waterman&#x27;s time, his involvement in the label decreased, and PWL International Ltd. became the Warner label Coalition.

The record label is still in operation today and operates the label EBUL through former labels Jive Records and Zomba (now labels by Sony Music Entertainment).

As of March 2017, most of the PWL catalogue is now distributed by BMG Rights Management. In November 2023, BMG Rights Management and PWL released a triple CD and two double vinyl LPs, &quot;Extended Big Hits and Surprises&quot;, containing 24 12&quot; PWL remixes of primarily Stock Aitken Waterman productions, which was well received. No tracks were licensed from other record labels. An exclusive Blu-ray edition was also released via the Super Deluxe Edition website.

<text>Wasabi is a &quot;mostly open source&quot; cross-platform application framework and skinnable GUI toolkit. It was developed as the framework for Winamp3, but designed to be flexible and extensible enough to be useful for other programs. Although most of Wasabi was zlib licensed, it depended on code still owned by Nullsoft, the creators of Winamp. Since the demise of Winamp3 Nullsoft has not publicly released any updates to Wasabi, which they use in Winamp 5.x&#x27;s to provide the &quot;Modern Skin&quot; system.

Around the time of Winamp 5&#x27;s release, a small community effort of former Winamp3 developers and fans formed to take the last open source Wasabi SDK, and make it into the platform it was originally designed to become.

<text>Lincoln is a town on Lake Ontario in the Niagara Region, Ontario, Canada. The town&#x27;s administrative and commercial centre is in the community of Beamsville.

==Geography==
Lincoln&#x27;s location between the southern shore of Lake Ontario and the Niagara Escarpment provides for a moderate climate with mild winters. The area is known in Canada for its orchards, vineyards, wineries and restaurants that feature local produce and wines. Fruit crops grown in Lincoln include cherries, peaches, apples and pears, and during the summer attract many tourists from all over Ontario, particularly Toronto. Since November 2017, the town has been served by the &quot;uLinc&quot; bus network, which runs three routes. GO Transit also serves the town.

==Communities==
The town comprises the communities of Beamsville, Campden, Jordan, Jordan Station, Rockway, Tintern, Vineland and Vineland Station.

==History==
Lincoln&#x27;s earliest known inhabitants was the Neutral Confederacy, also called the Attawandaron. Archaeologists from the Royal Ontario Museum found evidence of a Neutral encampment with a long house about two kilometers east of Beamsville, on Cave Springs Farm. Until vandals destroyed them about 30 years ago, there were a number of Indigenous faces carved in stone high on the Escarpment wall nearby.

The Neutrals were decimated by the Iroquois in 1653. When the first European settlers arrived in 1777, there were only a few semi-migrant native people living in the caves near Beamsville.

The earliest European settlers were ex-Butler&#x27;s Rangers who had fought on the side of Britain in the American Revolution. United Empire Loyalist Jacob Beam began what is now the town of Beamsville in 1788. Both of his homes the original one located on The Thirty (creek) and the one near downtown Beamsville are still intact today. Senator William Gibson is another key figure in the history of Beamsville. His mansion is now the Girls&#x27; Dorm at Great Lakes Christian College. Beamsville was also home to the annual Lincoln County Agricultural Fair, usually held on or around the first weekend of September. This fair was very well known fair throughout the area, and attracted thousands of people every year since its inception in 1857. The Fair is no longer held in Beamsville since the grounds were sold to become a housing development.

In 1898, hockey player William Fairbrother, in the town of Beamsville, was the first to make use of a hockey net. The town was also home to the first Japanese-Canadian home for the aged in 1967.

Mennonites (Pennsylvania Dutch) walking north from the United States in 1799 founded the villages of Jordan and Vineland. An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected at the Jordan Museum by the province to commemorate the first Mennonite Settlement&#x27;s role in Ontario&#x27;s heritage. The First Mennonite Church in Vineland, adjacent to the cemetery at the corner of Regional Road 81 (former Highway 8) and Martin Road, organized in 1801, is the oldest Mennonite congregation in Canada.
Good hunting and fishing as well as excellent soil and waterways attracted these early settlers. Agriculture flourished, and tanneries, grist mills, saw mills and woollen mills sprang up in Glen Elgin (now known as Ball&#x27;s Falls), Tintern, St. Mary&#x27;s, called Jordan after 1840, Rockway, The Thirty (now vanished) and Beamsville.

With a large natural harbour at the mouth of Twenty Creek, Jordan and Jordan Station became busy shipping centres for the export of logs for masts, tan bark, hides, ashes used in industrial centres for the manufacture of soap, as well as grain, flour, fruit and fruit products. A small ship building industry existed for a time on the banks of the Twenty.

Today, Lincoln is a leading area for tender fruit production and grape growing. Its wines are achieving international recognition and winning awards for quality. &quot;Greenhouse Friendly&quot; Lincoln also has the largest concentration of greenhouse operators in Canada.

In its earliest days what is now Lincoln was regarded, and governed, as an extension of the province of Quebec, but in 1791 the Canada Bill placed it in English Upper Canada. Colonel John Graves Simcoe, first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, divided the province into 19 counties. He named Lincoln County after its English counterpart, and each of its 12 townships, including Clinton and Louth, after towns in Lincolnshire, England.

The first township councils, formed in 1793, had no legislative authority. In response to the Rebellion of 1837, the 1849 Municipal Act gave local councils much more power to deal with local matters.

The Town of Lincoln came into existence on January 1, 1970, a municipal corporation created by the Legislature of Ontario through the amalgamation of the Town of Beamsville, the Township of Clinton, and approximately half the Township of Louth. Through a vote of citizens, &quot;Lincoln&quot; was chosen to be its name.

==People==
The town is home to numerous Dutch and United Empire Loyalist families, as evidenced by the large number of Dutch Reformed and Anglican churches in the area. Other ethnic groups include Italians - one family which founded the Commisso&#x27;s Food Markets supermarket chain - Germans, East Asians, and Indians.

Katherine &quot;Kay&quot; McKeever, also known as the &quot;Owl Lady of Canada,&quot; spent over forty years saving, rehabilitating, and breeding owls in Lincoln. In 1965, McKeever rescued her first owl, leading to her lifelong passion of rescuing and understanding owls. In the 1970s, Mckeever and her husband Larry founded The Owl Rehabilitation and Research Foundation, an Ontario non-profit corporation dedicated to helping injured owls. In 1994, the Foundation was re-incorporated as a Canadian non-profit corporation and renamed The Owl Foundation. The Foundation&#x27;s facility, located in Vineland, has 26 acres of property and can host up to fifty owls. The facility usually handles between 100 and 150 injured owls each year. McKeever is recognized as one of the world&#x27;s foremost experts in owl behavior. She has written and published a number of books, has two honorary doctorates, is a member of the Order of Canada, and has received numerous wildlife and volunteer awards.

William Fairbrother, the inventor of the hockey net, lived in Lincoln. Bill Berg, formerly a hockey player for the Toronto Maple Leafs, and now an NHL broadcaster, was born, and continues to make his home in Beamsville. Paul Laus, a former Florida Panthers bruiser defenceman, and Ryan Christie, who played seven games with the Dallas Stars and Calgary Flames are also Beamsville natives. Another Beamsville native of note, Tonya Verbeek, earned an Olympic silver medal in women&#x27;s wrestling at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Tonya Verbeek excelled once again by winning the bronze medal in women&#x27;s freestyle wrestling, 55 kg class. John Chayka who was a former NHLGeneral Manager for the Arizona Coyotes was raised in Jordan Station.

The band Rush practised in Beamsville in their earlier days. Drummer Neil Peart was raised in nearby Port Dalhousie.

==Industry==
The region is in the heart of Ontario&#x27;s wine country and contributes greatly to the wine industry in the Niagara Peninsula. Many wineries from the area have taken home top awards, including Grape King at the Niagara Grape &amp; Wine Festival, as well as international awards. Wineries in Lincoln include Malivoire, London Born Wines, Mike Weir Winery, Thomas and Vaughan, Thirty Bench, Angel&#x27;s Gate, Peninsula Ridge, Cave Spring Cellars, Daniel Lenko Winery, Hidden Bench, Magnotta, Mountain Road Winery, Legends Estates, Crown Bench, Megalomaniac, Featherstone, Tawse, Vineland Estates, Honsberger Estate and Corner Stone.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Lincoln had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Culture==
The Lincoln Public Library has branches in Beamsville and Vineland. The Fleming Branch in Beamsville, founded in 1852, had been located in the old Clinton-Louth town hall built in the mid-19th century. The upper floor of the building has been used by Freemasons for over a century. In June 2014, the Fleming Branch was relocated to the new community complex at 5020 Serena Drive. The Moses F. Rittenhouse Branch is located in Vineland.

Vineland is host to a large craft fair that takes place over a period of four days on Canadian Thanksgiving weekend. Craft stalls are set up on the main street, Victoria Avenue, and at the Ball&#x27;s Falls Conservation Area. This festival also extends into the ball park in Jordan.

<text>WWE Velocity is an American professional wrestling television program that was produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and ran from May 25, 2002 to June 11, 2006. It replaced two syndicated WWE shows, &quot;Jakked&quot; and &quot;Metal&quot;. Once a weekly Saturday night show on Spike TV and on Sky Sports 2 in the United Kingdom on Sunday mornings, &quot;Velocity&quot; became a webcast from 2005 to 2006. The newest episode would be uploaded to WWE.com on Saturdays and be available for the next week. Older webcast episodes were also archived. It served as a supplementary show to the SmackDown! brand, focusing more exclusively on its mid-card performers and matches, and was recorded before the week&#x27;s television taping of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. 8 episodes of &quot;Velocity&quot; are now available on Peacock in the United States and the WWE Network in international markets.

==History==
&quot;WWE Velocity&quot; was primarily used to summarize major occurrences on the latest episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, which aired Thursday and later Friday nights on UPN. Due to the WWE Brand Extension, &quot;Velocity&quot; aired matches and content from the SmackDown brand. The format was set to mirror that of &quot;WWE Heat&quot; and its relation to the Raw brand.

Following &quot;Raw&quot;&#x27;s move from Spike TV back to the USA Network in 2005, &quot;Velocity&quot; and its Raw brand counterpart, &quot;Heat&quot;, were discontinued from television broadcast in the United States and Canada and became webcasts streamed on WWE.com. Internationally, &quot;Velocity&quot; and &quot;Heat&quot; continued to be broadcast on their respective television networks due to WWE&#x27;s international programming commitments.

With the relaunch of &quot;ECW&quot;, &quot;Velocity&quot; was cancelled. The last episode of &quot;Velocity&quot; aired internationally on June 11, 2006. It was also the last episode to be streamed on WWE.com.

<doc id="730529" wikidata="Q900375" url="?curid=730529" title="VLT Survey Telescope">
<text>The VLT Survey Telescope (VST) is a telescope located at ESO&#x27;s Paranal Observatory in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. It is housed in an enclosure immediately adjacent to the four Very Large Telescope (VLT) Unit Telescopes on the summit of Cerro Paranal. The VST is a wide-field survey telescope with a field of view twice as broad as the full Moon. It is the largest telescope in the world designed to exclusively survey the sky in visible light.

The VST program is a cooperation between the Osservatorio Astronomico di Capodimonte (OAC), Naples, Italy, and the European Southern Observatory (ESO) that began in 1997. The OAC is one of the institute members of Istituto Nazionale di AstroFisica (INAF), which created a separate institute for the coordination of both technological and scientific aspects of the project, named Centro VST a Napoli (VSTceN). VSTcen was founded and directed by Prof. Massimo Capaccioli of the VST project, and hosted at the OAC. ESO and VSTceN collaborated in the commission phase, while ESO was responsible for the civil engineering works and the dome on site. The telescope has now started observations and ESO is solely responsible for managing its operations and maintenance.

==Technical information==
The VST is an alt-azimuthal wide-field survey telescope with a primary mirror diameter of 2.65 meters that was constructed from 2007 to 2011 at the ESO Cerro Paranal Observatory, in Chile. With a field of view of one square degree (roughly two full moons), its main scientific role is as a wide-field imaging instrument for exploring the large-scale structure of the universe (as visible from the southern hemisphere), able to identify the most suitable candidates for detailed examination by the VLT. Together with its camera OmegaCAM, the VST is able to obtain a high angular resolution (0.216 arcsec/pixel), and it is capable of performing stand-alone survey projects in the visible part of the spectrum.

===Telescope optics===

The telescope has two mirrors, the primary (M1) and a smaller secondary mirror (M2), which reflect light from the sky down to the OmegaCAM camera. Both mirrors are made from a crystalline ceramic material called Sitall, chosen for its low coefficient of thermal expansion. The VST primary mirror is the larger of the two, with a diameter of 265 cm and a thickness of 14 cm. The secondary mirror is less than half the size of M1 with a diameter of just 93.8 cm and a thickness of 13 cm. VST&#x27;s original optical components were manufactured at the Lytkarino Glass Factory, Moscow. The mirrors were completed ahead of schedule, but on arrival in Chile in 2002, the primary was found to be broken and the secondary was damaged. The new primary and repaired secondary arrived in Chile in 2006.

A computer-controlled active optics system controls the shape of M1 and the position of M2. This technology preserves the optical image quality by keeping the mirrors optimally positioned at all times. M1 is continuously reshaped by an actuator network of 84 axial motors distributed under the mirror surface and 24 radial dislocated laterally. Also in the primary mirror cell is another instrument able to modify the telescope&#x27;s optical configuration by moving from a corrector composed by a double set of lenses, to an atmospheric dispersion corrector (ADC) composed of a counter-rotating set of prisms, able to correct the optical dispersion phenomena due to the variation of air mass induced by changing the altitude angle. The secondary mirror is actively controlled by a deformable platform able to tilt the mirror during exposure. The active optics system also includes a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, mounted under the primary mirror cell together with the local guide system, able to furnish the optical correction feedback. These systems give the VST the capability to be autonomous in terms of guiding, tracking and active optics control.

===OmegaCAM===

At its Cassegrain focus, the VST hosts an imaging wide-field camera (OmegaCAM), comprising a mosaic of 32 2Kx4K CCDs (268 megapixels total), and produced by an international consortium between the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, and the ESO. Design features of OmegaCAM include four auxiliary CCD cameras, two for auto-guiding and two for on-line image analysis. Up to 12 filters can be used, ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared. The entire detector system operates in vacuum at about −140 degrees Celsius behind a large dewar window. This window not only protects the detectors from air and moisture, but also acts as an additional corrector lens.

==VST surveys==
The primary function of the VST is to support the Very Large Telescope by providing surveys – both extensive, multi-colour imaging surveys and more specific searches for rare astronomical objects. Three started in October 2011 as part of the Public Surveys Project, and they are anticipated to take five years to carry out. These are the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), VST ATLAS and the VST Photometric Hα Survey of the Southern Galactic Plane (VPHAS+). They focus on a wide range of astronomical issues from searching for highly energetic quasars to understanding the nature of dark energy. More information about the surveys can be found on the ESO - The VST Surveys website.

The data volume produced by OmegaCAM is large. About 30 terabytes of raw data will be produced per year and will flow back into data centres in Europe for processing. A novel and sophisticated software system has been developed at Groningen and Naples to handle the very large data flow. The end products from the processing will be huge lists of the objects found, as well as images, and these will be made available to astronomers worldwide for scientific analysis. Funding for the data analysis was uncertain in 2011.

==Construction==

The loss of the first mirror in 2002 while being transported from Europe to Chile caused delays in the construction of the telescope. The new primary and repaired secondary were completed in 2006. Testing was finished in Italy and the telescope was dismounted, painted and packed, then shipped and mounted at Paranal. The first parts arrived in June 2007, and the first phase of integration at Paranal was completed in April, 2008. The mirrors were stored while their cells were constructed; further delays occurred when the primary mirror cell suffered water damage while in transit to Chile, requiring it to be returned to Europe for repair. The first images from the VST were released on June 8, 2011.

==Science==
In planetary science, the survey telescope aims to discover and study remote Solar System bodies such as trans-Neptunian objects, as well as search for extrasolar planet transits. The Galactic plane will also be extensively studied with VST, which will look for signatures of tidal interactions in the Milky Way, and will provide astronomers with data crucial to understand the structure and evolution of our Galaxy. Further afield, the VST will explore nearby galaxies, extragalactic and intra-cluster planetary nebulae, and will perform surveys of faint object and micro-lensing events. The telescope will also peer into the distant Universe to help astronomers find answers to long-standing questions in cosmology. It will target medium-redshift supernovae to help pin down the cosmic distance scale and understand the expansion of the Universe. The VST will also look for cosmic structures at medium-high redshift, active galactic nuclei and quasars to further our understanding of galaxy formation and the Universe&#x27;s early history.
Through the VST ATLAS survey, the telescope will target one of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics today: the nature of dark energy. The survey aims to detect small-amplitude oscillations known as ´baryon wiggles’ that can be detected in the power-spectrum of galaxies and are the imprint of sound waves in the early Universe on the distribution of matter. The dark energy equation of state can be determined by measuring the features of these oscillations. Extrapolating from previous surveys, it is very likely that the VST will make some unexpected discoveries with major consequences for the current understanding of the Universe.

==First images==
The first released VST image (below on the right) shows the star-forming region Messier 17, also known as the Omega Nebula or the Swan Nebula, as it has never been seen before. This vast region of gas, dust and hot young stars lies in the heart of the Milky Way in the constellation of Sagittarius (The Archer). The VST field of view is so large that the entire nebula, including its fainter outer parts, is captured — and retains its superb sharpness across the entire image. The data were processed using the Astro-WISE software system developed by E.A. Valentijn and collaborators at Groningen and elsewhere.

The second released VST image (top on the right) may be the best portrait of the globular star cluster Omega Centauri ever made. Omega Centauri, in the constellation of Centaurus (The Centaur), is the largest globular cluster in the sky, but the very wide field of view of VST and its powerful camera OmegaCAM can encompass even the faint outer regions of this object. The view seen on the left includes about 300 000 stars. The data were processed using the VST-Tube system developed by A. Grado and collaborators at the INAF-Capodimonte Observatory.

The third released VST image (middle on the right) shows a triplet of bright galaxies in the constellation of Leo (The Lion), together with a multitude of fainter objects: distant background galaxies and much closer Milky Way stars. The image hints at the power of the VST and OmegaCAM for surveying the extragalactic Universe and for mapping the low brightness objects of the galactic halo. The image on the left is a composite created by combining exposures taken through three different filters. Light that passed through a near-infrared filter was coloured red, red light is coloured green, and green light is coloured magenta.

<text>HMCS &quot;Nootka&quot; was a that served in the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) from 1946 to 1964. Constructed too late to take part in the Second World War, the ship saw service in the Korean War. She received the unit name &quot;Nootka&quot; while still under construction in Halifax, Nova Scotia after the RCN renamed the to in 1943. &quot;Nootka&quot; was the second Canadian Tribal to be constructed in Canada and the second Canadian warship to circumnavigate the world. The ship was sold for scrap and broken up at Faslane, Scotland in 1965.

==Design==
The were ordered by the Canadian Naval Staff&#x27;s intent to build a stronger, permanent force. The Tribals were designed to fight heavily armed destroyers of other navies, such as the Japanese . Canada chose the design based on its armament, with the size and power of the Tribal class allowing them to act more like small cruisers than as fleet destroyers. The Naval Staff intended to order the construction of a flotilla of Tribals, with two under construction every year. However, due to war demands, British yards could not accommodate such a request. Therefore, it was decided that Canadian shipyards would construct the second batch of Tribals. They were ordered with modified ventilation and heating systems for North Atlantic winter service. Design modifications were made after deficiencies were noted in , the lead ship of the Canadian Tribals. Canadian Tribals were a foot longer than their British counterparts and carried an auxiliary boiler for heating and additional power requirements.

During construction delays soon began due to a shortage of skilled labour and engineering personnel. Furthermore, on the first batch, and &quot;Nootka&quot;, there was a shortage of high-quality steel in Canada required in the construction of destroyers. The steel was imported from the United States. By the time the second batch of Canadian-built Tribals, and the second , began construction, Canada was capable of providing the steel.

==Description==
===Initial design===
The ship was long between perpendiculars and long overall with a beam of and a draught of . As built, the destroyer had a standard displacement of and at deep load. &quot;Nootka&quot; had a complement of 14 officers and 245 ratings. The destroyer was propelled by two shafts driven by two Parsons single-reduction geared turbines powered by steam created by three Admiralty-type three-drum boilers. Each boiler was housed in a separate compartment and were rated at . This created and gave the ship a maximum speed of . The destroyers could carry of fuel oil. Tribals had poor freeboard and were considered &quot;wet&quot; ships. They had a range of at .

As built, &quot;Nootka&quot; was fitted with six quick firing Mk XII guns placed in three twin turrets, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from bow to stern. The turrets were placed on 40° mountings with open-backed shields. The ship also had one twin turret of QF Mk XVI guns in the &#x27;X&#x27; position. The mounts were powered by turbo generators and turbo-hydraulic units. For secondary anti-aircraft armament, &quot;Nootka&quot; was fitted with twin Mk 5 40 mm Bofors guns situated side by side. The vessel was also fitted with four torpedo tubes in one quad mounting, situated behind the second funnel for Mk IX torpedoes. Along the stern of the ships were racks for depth charges positioned along the centreline, holding six depth charges at a time and space for nine reloads. A depth charge thrower was set high on each side of the superstructure ahead of the tripod main mast.

The ship was equipped Type 291 radar for air search, Type 293 radar for target indication and Type 285 for 4.7-inch gun control and a DCT controller, utilizing a Fuze Keeping Clock, for the 4-inch guns (working with the Type 285 radar). The radar was carried on a lattice mast and the HF/DF was situated on a pole aft.

===Refit and alterations===
In 1949, &quot;Nootka&quot; underwent a conversion to a destroyer escort (DDE). The DDE conversion was composed of removing the existing 4.7-inch armament and replacing the &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; mounts with twin 4-inch mounts to give the ship uniform armament. The &#x27;Y&#x27; mount was replaced by two triple-barrelled Mark IV Squid anti-submarine mortars. In 1951, the ship underwent another alteration, replacing the 4-inch gun in &#x27;X&#x27; mount with a twin /50 caliber gun mount. The secondary armament was also upgraded, with four single 40 mm Bofors guns also installed. The 4-inch guns, all Mk XVI, were controlled by the US Mark 63 fire control system, replacing the DCT controller and the vessels were fitted with SPS-6C air search and Sperry surface search radar. &quot;Nootka&quot;″s final sensor layout was the SPS-6C, SPS-10, Type 293 and Type 262 radars and Type 170 and Type 174 sonars. A short, aluminum lattice mast was installed and the funnels were capped.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Nootka&quot; was ordered as part of the 1942–43 building programme by the RCN in June 1941. The second Tribal to be constructed in Canada, the ship&#x27;s keel was laid down on 20 May 1942 at Halifax Shipyards in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Construction of the ship was slowed by a shortage of skilled labour and engineering personnel. By the end of 1943, &quot;Nootka&quot;″s construction was several months behind schedule. This delayed the construction of the fourth Canadian-built Tribal as there were only two slips at Halifax capable of building the destroyers. Further delays were caused by the contractor for the ships&#x27; boilers ad engines, John Inglis Company. The contractor had been overwhelmed by the complexity of the design and the engines for the first Canadian Tribal, &quot;Micmac&quot; arrived only one full year after the ship&#x27;s launch. &quot;Nootka&quot; was christened by Miss R. Gallant, a shipyard employee and named for the Nuu-chah-nulth people, formerly called the &quot;Nootka&quot;, an aboriginal people of the Canadian Pacific Coast. The destroyer was launched on 26 April 1944 and commissioned into the RCN on 7 August 1946, performing sea trials off of Halifax.

After commissioning, &quot;Nootka&quot; served as a training ship for the Atlantic Fleet. She was one of the ships assigned to take part in Operation Scuttled, the training exercise designed to sink , a German U-boat that had surrendered to the RCN at the end of the Second World War. However, before &quot;Nootka&quot; and her fellow ships could find the range on the submarine, the aircraft of the Naval Air Arm successfully attacked the vessel and sank her. In September 1948, she joined the aircraft carrier and sister ship on a training cruise to the Ungava Peninsula in Quebec. There the two destroyers left the aircraft carrier and toured the north, visiting Churchill, Manitoba, becoming the first RCN warships to penetrate Hudson Bay. She remained as a training vessel until her conversion to a destroyer escort after being paid off on 15 August 1949.

During the Korean War, Canada rotated its destroyers in and out of the theatre. &quot;Nootka&quot; departed from Halifax on 25 November 1950 and transited the Panama Canal for the first of two tours of duty. On her first tour, she relieved , taking her place as one of the three Canadian destroyers assigned to the region. On 25 January, she was sent for shore bombardment duties in the Inchon area in January and was fired upon by Communist guns. For the first three months of 1951, the three Canadian destroyers in theatre spent the majority of their time screening aircraft carriers and performing inshore patrols. On 16 March 1950 she became the Senior Officer&#x27;s Ship for the Canadian force in the theatre, replacing &quot;Cayuga&quot;. In early April 1951, &quot;Nootka&quot; was assigned to the west coast blockade patrol. On 13–14 May, &quot;Nootka&quot; captured two junks, five sampans and 28 prisoners after encountering a Chinese fishing fleet off the west coast. Later in May, the destroyer transferred to the east coast, performing bombardment, aircraft carrier screening and patrol missions. &quot;Nootka&quot; sailed for home on 20 July, replaced by &quot;Cayuga&quot;.

Her second tour in Korean waters took place from 12 February 1952 until 9 February 1952. &quot;Nootka&quot; was assigned to the Island Campaign on the west coast, supporting guerrillas and Republic of Korea troops in the islands around Chodo. The ship took part in the Island Campaign in the Haeju region in March. For the majority of 1952, &quot;Nootka&quot; supported the Island campaign off the west coast. During one inshore patrol around the islands on 26 September, &quot;Nootka&quot; sank a North Korean minelaying junk, rescuing its crew of five. She returned to Halifax on 17 December 1952 via the Mediterranean Sea, having become the second Canadian warship to circumnavigate the globe and the first destroyer to do so by the Suez Canal. &quot;Nootka&quot; underwent further conversion and modernization in 1953–1954 and resumed training duties with the Atlantic Fleet. In January 1958, &quot;Nootka&quot; collided with while operating in the Atlantic with the First Canadian Escort Squadron. She participated in the massive RCN deployment for the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962; &quot;Nootka&quot; was assigned a patrol area off the northern tip of Cuba during the crisis.

In summer 1963, &quot;Nootka&quot; joined &quot;Haida&quot; for a tour of the Great Lakes. Her last deployment was for a NATO exercise in Bermuda in fall 1963 where she sustained hull damage while docking in strong winds. She was temporarily patched and returned to Halifax and was decommissioned at Halifax on 6 February 1964. She was scrapped at Faslane, Scotland in 1965.

<text>Super World of Sports, also known as Super World Sports or simply SWS, was a Japanese professional wrestling promotion from 1990 to 1992. Its motto was &quot;Straight and Strong&quot;.

==History==
===Formation===
In April 1990, Genichiro Tenryu, one of the top stars of All Japan Pro Wrestling, left the company to become a spokesmodel for Megane Super, whom were one of the best-known makers of eyeglasses in Japan at the time. However, the company decided to instead used him as the launching pad for a new pro-wrestling circuit, which Megane Super executive Hachiro Tanaka named Super World of Sports.

With his backing, Megane Super began throwing money offers around to build up their roster. Yoshiaki Yatsu, Ashura Hara, Shunji Takano, The Great Kabuki, Hiromichi Fuyuki, Tatsumi &quot;Koki&quot; Kitahara, Masao Orihara, Isao Takagi (the future Arashi), and referee Hiroyuki Umino joined in from All-Japan. But SWS would attract New Japan Pro-Wrestling talent as well, including George Takano (the former Cobra), Naoki Sano, Hisakatsu Oya, Akira Katayama, former superstar yokozuna (grand champion in sumo wrestling) Koji Kitao, and Stampede Wrestling powerhouse Dino Ventura (605 lb bench press) who had extraordinary MMA and technical wrestling skills. Because of this, fans, wrestlers, and administrators of other Japanese promotions criticized SWS as being a &quot;money puroresu&quot; (Megane Super being the money mark) because of the way wrestlers flocked to it. The feeling was compounded when in October, SWS signed a working relationship contract with Vince McMahon&#x27;s World Wrestling Federation, for interpromotional purposes.

===Working relationship with the WWF===
The SWS/WWF co-promotion produced several cards, including two shows at the Tokyo Dome. The events took place on March 30, 1991, and December 12, 1991 (The March show saw a near-shoot between former sumos Kitao and Earthquake; Kitao was fired for subsequently cutting a shoot promo exposing the business afterwards). SWS also had a small agreement with two smaller Japanese federations, Gran Hamada&#x27;s Universal Lucha Libre and Yoshiaki Fujiwara&#x27;s Fujiwara Gumi (shoot-style wrestling), which provided alternative matches and opponents to the cards.

SWS&#x27;s peak coincided with the general Japanese economic downturn of the early 1990s, though AJPW and NJPW continued to do good business during that period. Along with criticism of the wrestlers for selling out their original promotions, which was still fairly rare at that time, SWS was also hampered by the lack of Japanese vs Japanese rivalries, which had become a staple of NJPW and AJPW booking since the mid-eighties. Tenryu mainly battled foreigners such as Hogan and Flair since none of the other Japanese wrestlers in SWS were positioned as being at or near his level. As Megane Super began withdrawing its support, the company began running fewer cards, and in May 1992 Yatsu withdrew. On June 19 1992, SWS held its final card at Nagasaki International Gym. The promotion&#x27;s talent split into the following federations: Yatsu&#x27;s SPWF; Tenryu&#x27;s new promotion, WAR, including Hara, Fuyuki, Kitahara; NOW, including Kendo Nagasaki, and PWC, including the Takano brothers and Takagi.

==Wrestlers==
===Main roster===
Unlike many wrestling promotions, SWS had a wrestling roster that was divided into three stables, reminiscent of the sumo heya system. Revolution was mostly AJPW alumni, Palaestra was mostly NJPW alumni, and Geki Dojo were neutrals led by a heel manager, KY Wakamatsu. Yoshiaki Yatsu, who defected from AJPW three months after Tenryu, was added to Geki Dojo to give the group a senior level star.

<text>James Henderson Blount (September 12, 1837 – March 8, 1903) was an American statesman, soldier and congressman from Georgia. He opposed the annexation of Hawaii in 1893 in his investigation into the American involvement in the political revolution in the Kingdom of Hawai&#x27;i.

==Early life==
Blount was born near Clinton, Jones County, Georgia. He attended private schools there and in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. He graduated from the University of Georgia at Athens in 1858. He studied law and was admitted to the Georgia bar in 1859. During the American Civil War he served in the Confederate States Army as a private in the Second Georgia Battalion, Floyd Rifles for two years, and was later lieutenant colonel for two years.

==Political career==
Blount served in the United States Congress representing the sixth district of Georgia from 1873 to 1893. He was part of the faction of Southern Democrats known as the Redeemers. He was Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Relations (1891–1893).

==Hawai&#x27;i==
After a coup overthrew Queen Lili&#x27;uokalani of Hawai&#x27;i in early 1893, the new government sought to be annexed by the United States. President Benjamin Harrison was supportive and sent a treaty to the Senate. His successor, President Grover Cleveland, a Democrat like Blount, opposed annexation and sent Blount, now a private citizen, to investigate. The report he issued on July 17, 1893, is known as the Blount Report.

Blount recommended the rejection of annexation and stated that the natives should be allowed to continue their ways. When Blount blamed the U.S. consul for providing assistance for the overthrow, Cleveland proposed to use American military force to overthrow the new government by force and reinstall Liliuokalani as an absolute monarch. When the deposed Queen refused to grant amnesty as a condition of her reinstatement, she was accused of telling an American official she would &quot;behead&quot; the current government leaders and confiscate their property, Cleveland referred the matter to Congress.

The U.S. Senate, under Democratic control but angered at being shut out of a major foreign policy issue by Cleveland, then produced its own report, written by Senator John Morgan, a Democrat, and known as the Morgan Report. It completely contradicted Blount&#x27;s findings and found the revolution in Hawaii was a completely internal affair. Following the Turpie Resolution of May 1894, which vowed a policy of non-interference in Hawaiian affairs, Cleveland dropped all talk of reinstating the Queen and went on to officially recognize and maintain diplomatic relations with the Republic of Hawaii. Other nations had already recognized the Republic. In 1898 the Republic again sought annexation, which with McKinley&#x27;s strong support won Congressional approval.

==Death==
Blount died at the age of 65 in Macon, Bibb County, Georgia, and was buried at the Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon, Georgia.

He is the namesake to the community of Blount, Georgia.

<text>The Weiser River is a tributary of the Snake River in western Idaho in the United States. It drains a mountainous area of consisting primarily of low rolling foothills intersected by small streams south and east of Hells Canyon along the Idaho-Oregon border.

==Description==
It rises in northern Adams County in the Seven Devils Mountains, approximately west of New Meadows in the Payette National Forest. It flows generally southwest, between the Cuddy Mountains to the west and the West Mountains to the east, past Council and Cambridge. In southern Washington County it turns west for its lower and enters a broadening valley called the Weiser Cove along the northwestern extreme of the Snake River Plain before entering the Snake from the east at Weiser.

It receives the Little Weiser River from the east approximately southwest of Cambridge. The river descends from approximately above sea level at its source to at its mouth on the Snake. For much of its upper reaches, the river follows a narrow course through the mountains, emerging at times into several broad ranching valleys, including one around Midvale. Although it flows unimpeded, it is used for irrigation in the vicinity of its mouth upstream from Weiser, as well along tributaries in its upper reaches. The Pacific and Idaho Northern Railroad formerly followed its course from Weiser to New Meadows.

The river, as well as the town of Weiser, are named for Private Peter M. Weiser of the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804-1806.

<text>Peter M. Weiser (October 3, 1781 – death between 1813 and 1828) was an American soldier and member of the Corps of Discovery on the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

==Early life==
Weiser was born in Berks County, Pennsylvania of German parentage, the son of John Phillip Weiser. He was the great-grandson of noted settler and diplomat Conrad Weiser of the Pennsylvania Colony.

==Lewis and Clark Expedition==
Weiser enlisted as a private in the Corps of Discovery by January 1, 1804. He was probably recruited in 1803 by William Clark at Fort Kaskaskia, Illinois while serving in the 1st Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army.

Weiser was one of several soldiers in the Corps who faced disciplinary problems before the expedition left Missouri. On March 3, 1804, he, John Colter and others were disciplined for asking permission to go hunting as a pretext for an unauthorized visit to a nearby &quot;whiskey shop&quot;. As punishment they were confined to camp for ten days.

During the expedition Weiser often served as quartermaster, cook, and hunter. On August 24, when Lewis had gotten the expedition started toward Lemhi Pass, a Shoshone rode up from the rear of the column to inform Lewis that one of his men was sick. Lewis went back to discover Weiser, whom he dosed with tincture of peppermint and laudanum. During the winter of 1805–06, while the expedition was at Fort Clatsop, he was part of the salt-making detail on the Oregon coast.

In the late spring of 1806, while the Corps was camped near present-day Kamiah in north central Idaho, he took part in a detached search expedition for food in the surrounding mountains. At the time, the Corps was camped by the Clearwater River waiting for the snow to melt on Lolo Pass. After the party noticed that the local Nez Perce had fresh salmon in their lodges, Weiser, Private Frazer and Sgt. John Ordway were sent on expedition to hunt for the fish about 30 miles southwest to the Salmon River, which Clark would call the North Fork of &quot;Lewis&#x27;s River.&quot; (They had been about 125 miles upstream of the Salmon River when they descended it for a short distance in 1805 after crossing Lemhi Pass. They then turned and ascended its North Fork until they left it to cross over to the Bitterroot River, which they considered to be the main fork of Clark&#x27;s Fork [of the Pend Oreille].) Ironically, this put Weiser quite close to the headwaters of what would eventually be called &quot;Weiser River,&quot; probably the closest Weiser ever came to it.

Lewis and Clark separated in two groups on July 3, 1806 east of Lolo Pass, Lewis was to go east to meet the Missouri River at the Great Falls and Clark south; Weiser was in Clark&#x27;s group. Clark&#x27;s group ascended the Bitterroot and made their way to Three Forks where they split again. Weiser and Colter were put under the command of Ordway who would descend the Missouri to meet up with Lewis. On July 19, they met part of Lewis&#x27;s group, and on July 23, Weiser was severely injured in the leg. His group met up with the remaining four of Lewis&#x27;s group on July 28, and Weiser made it safely back to St. Louis.

==Post-Expedition years==
In 1807 Corps of Discovery members John Potts and George Drouillard, joined the party of Spanish fur trapper Manuel Lisa on the Upper Missouri River. Lisa and his company of 42 men (including John Baptiste Champlain and Benito Vázquez) moved up the Missouri until they reached the mouth of the Yellowstone River. After ascending the Yellowstone some 170 miles, they established Fort Raymond, a trading post at the mouth of the Bighorn River in present-day Montana.

Weiser and Potts were at Fort Raymond in early July 1808 and the two men contracted to enter into a joint venture, signing a note for $450 for supplies to Lisa&#x27;s company. Colter apparently affiliated with the venture, and it is unknown where Weiser was when Colter accompanied Potts that autumn to the Jefferson River where Potts was killed by the Blackfoot Indians.

The next summer, Lisa entered into a new venture with Andrew Henry and others, the Missouri Fur Company. The new company decided to relocate its main location to the Three Forks of the Missouri, and the following spring of 1810, Weiser presumably accompanied Henry to build a fort there. The fort was abandoned after a short time due to extensive hostility from the Blackfeet which resulted in the death of Drouillard and several others. Weiser returned to St. Louis in the summer of 1810 and filed suit against Potts&#x27; estate to try to recoup his share of the proceeds of the venture, but ultimately had to file for bankruptcy. He then served in the War of 1812 for 30 days in 1813.

==Death==
The circumstances of Weiser&#x27;s death are not known. It is thought that, after serving in the War of 1812, he joined back up with the fur trade and was likely killed in that endeavor. Sometime between 1825 and 1828, Clark drew up a list of the Corps members, and simply listed Weiser as &quot;killed.&quot;

==Legacy==
In his 1814 map, Clark named an ambiguous tributary of the Snake River across the Continental Divide from the headwaters of the Madison River for Weiser, and the name was eventually applied to its current feature. The nearby town of Weiser, Idaho was named after the River.

<text>Essex is a town with a population of 21,216 in Essex County in southwestern Ontario, Canada, whose municipal borders extend to Lake Erie. Essex is also the name of the largest community within the municipality.

==Communities==
The town comprises the communities of Ambassador Beach, Barretville, Belcreft Beach, Colchester, Edgars, Essex Centre, Gesto, Harrow, Klie&#x27;s Beach, Leslies Corner, Levergood Beach, Lypps Beach, Marshfield, McGregor, New Canaan, Oxley, Paquette Corners, Seymour Beach and Vereker.

==History==
The current Town of Essex was created on 1 April 1999 through the amalgamation of the former towns of Essex and Harrow, along with the former townships of Colchester North and Colchester South. Each community has a distinct history prior to amalgamation. Colchester South is notable for lying farther south than the northern border of California.

===Essex===
The Talbot Trail was heavily attributed with causing Essex to grow significantly in the last half of the 19th century. The community achieved town status in 1890.

On August 10, 1907, at the Essex Station, which is the train station located in the town of Essex, Ontario there was a large explosion that sent shock waves across the county and even into some parts of nearby Michigan. The explosion took place at roughly 9:50 am when a train cart containing of nitro-glycerine ignited causing a massive explosion to take place. This explosion had vast effects on the immediate area as well as the surrounding outskirts of town. The blast sent debris up to and over away and killed two people in the process, and injured many more. The result could have been much more severe as a train of vacationers from Brantford on their way to Detroit was scheduled to arrive in the station seconds before the explosion but was luckily running late; this delay saved the lives of many travellers. The boom of the explosion caused plaster to fall from the ceilings of buildings in Windsor and windows to rattle as far as Detroit. The explosion also caused over 250,000 dollars worth of property damage to the immediate area surrounding the blast zone. The reason for the explosion was leaking packaging of nitro-glycerine on one of the train carts in the station at the time that eventually dripped onto the track and when a spark was created the whole cart ignited into a giant explosion. The crater left by the explosion was across and deep in the centre. Families all around town found their yards and in some cases even their bedrooms littered with debris that was hurled from this earth trembling event. The results of this event were many. People began to flock to Essex from all over the county to see the devastation that was left behind, and due to the type of transportation available at the time these visitors often could not make the return trip in the same day. This posed a serious problem for the accommodations available in the town as they could not keep up with these visitors and rooms were booked solid and food sources were being used up quicker than they could be replenished. Another result of this would be the need to rebuild, the Essex Station was one building very heavily damaged along with many other properties in the surrounding area and the money needed to do so would not be easy to acquire. In an investigation to see who would be responsible for the explosion and subsequently the deaths of the two men, it was deemed that the nitro-glycerine was improperly cured; however, the railway was held responsible for the improper handling of the explosive cargo. The company would be fined 125,000 dollars for their irresponsible actions and this sum would go toward the expenses of rebuilding the areas of town that were affected. This process of rebuilding would take more than two years before all of the buildings would be completely rebuilt. The town of Essex would feel the lasting effects of this explosion for years to come.

Years later in 1980 the town would face the difficulty of another devastating explosion. This one would be the result of a natural gas meter being struck by a car setting this combustible material into flames. This explosion would reap considerable damage on the town, but no one died. This explosion would have smaller effects on the town of Essex, but it would remind people of the scare that their ancestors had experienced in the early part of the century. The Essex Station that was hit in the first explosion was rebuilt to its previous form and remains a recognizable landmark in the town today. It is often visited by tourist due to its rich and historical past. The town has even had the station put on display in one of its outdoor murals that are scattered all over town. This landmark is a symbol of the town&#x27;s past.

===Harrow===
==Governance==
Essex is divided into four wards which correspond to the four major communities involved in the 1999 amalgamation. During municipal elections, residents vote for a mayor, deputy mayor, and councillor(s) in their geographical ward.
* Ward 1 - Essex Centre (2 councillors)
* Ward 2 - Colchester North (1 councillor)
* Ward 3 - Colchester South (2 councillors)
* Ward 4 - Harrow Centre (1 councillor)

Town council as of March 2022:
* Mayor - Richard Meloche
* Deputy Mayor - Steve Bjorkman
* Ward 1 Councillor - Morley Bowman
* Ward 1 Councillor - Joe Garon
* Ward 2 Councillor - Kim Verbeek
* Ward 3 Councillor - Chris Vander Doelen
* Ward 3 Councillor - Jason Matyi
* Ward 4 Councillor - Sherry Bondy

==Climate==
==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Essex had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Sports and recreation==
The town of Essex is the home of the most successful Junior C hockey franchise in the province, the Essex 73&#x27;s. The club has won a record 19 Great Lakes Hockey League titles along with an Ontario record 7 provincial titles. The club played 36 seasons in the historic Essex Memorial Arena and now play in the new Essex Centre Sports Complex. Essex has two minor hockey associations: The Essex Minor Hockey Association based in Essex Centre and the Harrow-Colchester South Minor Hockey Association based in Harrow. The Sun County Panthers AAA teams play out of the Essex Centre Sports Complex.

The Essex Ravens football club play in the Ontario Varsity Football League and play their games at Raider Field at Essex District High School. They have won several provincial championships.

The Essex Energizers are a competitive jump rope team based in the Town of Essex. The Essex Energizers compete at the provincial, national and international levels in the sport of jump rope. Members of the team earned a bronze medal in team show in the 2004 World Championships and Cameron MacQuarrie earned sixth place overall individually in Brisbane, Australia. The Essex Energizers are consistently one of Canada&#x27;s top teams and in addition to competitions they have demonstrated at venues such as Disney World, NFL halftime shows, NBA halftime shows and Parliament Hill.

Essex has two major annual festivals. The Essex Fun Fest runs in the second week of July and the Harrow Fair occurs each labour day weekend. The Harrow Fair is the oldest community fair in Ontario.

==Education==
English-language public education for kindergarten through secondary school grades in Essex County is administered by the Greater Essex County District School Board, along with the Windsor-Essex Catholic District School Board which oversees English-language catholic education.

French-language public and catholic education are overseen by the Conseil scolaire Viamonde and the Conseil scolaire de district des écoles catholiques du Sud-Ouest respectively. The scope of all of these organizations includes both the County and the City of Windsor.

Prior to 1998 the Essex County Board of Education operated Anglophone secular public schools.

One public secondary school of the Greater Essex County District School Board is situated in Essex. Essex District High School serves Essex Centre, Colchester North and areas of Tecumseh, Lakeshore, and Kingsville. Kingsville District High School serves Harrow Centre and Colchester South, following the closure of Harrow District High School in 2016. Public school students from certain areas of Essex may attend General Amherst High School in Amherstburg. While there is no separate secondary school within the boundaries of Essex, students in the town may attend the Windsor-Essex Catholic District School Board&#x27;s St. Thomas of Villanova Catholic High School in LaSalle or Cardinal Carter Catholic High School in Leamington.

Elementary schools of the Greater Essex County District School Board include Essex Public School, Colchester North Public School, and Harrow Public School. Separate elementary schools of the Windsor-Essex Catholic District School Board include Holy Name Catholic Elementary School and St. Anthony Catholic Elementary School.

==Wildlife==
Essex was once known region-wide for its large crow population. The nightly infestation was particularly acute in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, with the consistent use of &quot;boomers&quot; and other techniques that discourage roosting at sundown, the crows eventually dispersed. Susceptible to West Nile virus, the crow population appears to have declined in recent times.

<text>Alan John Clarke (28 October 1935 – 24 July 1990) was an English television and film director, producer and writer.

==Life and career==
Clarke was born in Wallasey, Wirral, England.

Most of Clarke&#x27;s output was for television rather than cinema, including work for the famous play strands &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; and &quot;Play for Today&quot;. His subject matter tended towards social realism, with deprived or oppressed communities as a frequent setting.

As Dave Rolinson&#x27;s book details, between 1962 and 1966 Clarke directed several plays at The Questors Theatre in Ealing, London. Between 1967 and 1969 he directed various ITV productions including plays by Alun Owen (&quot;Shelter&quot;, &quot;George&#x27;s Room&quot;, &quot;Stella&quot;, &quot;Thief&quot;, &quot;Gareth&quot;), Edna O&#x27;Brien (&quot;Which of These Two Ladies Is He Married To?&quot; and &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Ever Over&quot;) and Roy Minton (&quot;The Gentleman Caller&quot;, &quot;Goodnight Albert&quot;, &quot;Stand By Your Screen&quot;). He also worked on the series &quot;The Informer&quot;, &quot;The Gold Robbers&quot; and &quot;A Man of Our Times&quot; (but not, as &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; once claimed, &quot;Big Breadwinner Hog&quot;). 

Clarke continued to work for ITV through the 1970s, but during the decade made much of his work for the BBC. This included pieces for &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; (&quot;Sovereign&#x27;s Company&quot; 1970), &quot;Play for Today&quot; and &quot;Play of the Month&quot; (&quot;The Love-Girl and the Innocent&quot;, 1973, and &quot;Danton&#x27;s Death&quot;, 1978). Distinctive work for these strands included further plays by Minton including &quot;Funny Farm&quot; (1975) and &quot;Scum&quot; (further details below), but also &quot;Sovereign&#x27;s Company&quot; by Don Shaw, &quot;The Hallelujah Handshake&quot; by Colin Welland (both 1970) and &quot;Penda&#x27;s Fen&quot; by David Rudkin (1974). He also made &quot;To Encourage the Others&quot; (1972), a powerful drama-documentary about the Derek Bentley case (the case that was later dramatised in Peter Medak&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;Let Him Have It&quot;), and several documentaries, including &quot;Vodka Cola&quot; (1981) on multinational corporations. Clarke&#x27;s other work in the mid-to-late 1970s included the initially unreleased documentary &quot;Bukovsky&quot; about the Soviet dissident and defector Vladimir Bukovsky and a companion &quot;Play For Today&quot; follow-up titled &quot;Nina&quot; (1978), which starred Jack Shepherd and Eleanor Bron.

A number of his works achieved notoriety and widespread criticism from the conservative end of the political spectrum, including &quot;Scum&quot; (1977), dealing with the subject of borstals (youth prisons), which was banned by the BBC, and subsequently remade by Clarke as a feature film released in 1979 (the original television version was only screened after his death). Clarke directed the television play &quot;Made in Britain&quot; (1982), starring Tim Roth (in his television debut) as a racist skinhead and his negative relationship with authorities and racial minorities, from a screenplay by David Leland. The feature film &quot;Rita, Sue and Bob Too&quot; (1987), was adapted by the working-class writer Andrea Dunbar from her stage work. The 1975 BBC play &quot;Diane&quot;, starring Janine Duvitski, which dealt with an incestuous relationship between a father and daughter was controversially received by the tabloid press.

Clarke&#x27;s work in the 1980s was fiercely stark and political, including the David Leland plays &quot;Beloved Enemy&quot; (1981) on multinational corporations and &quot;Psy-Warriors&quot; (1981) on military interrogation. Clarke also directed David Bowie in &quot;Baal&quot; (1982) for the BBC, part of Clarke&#x27;s interest in Bertolt Brecht. His film work became more sparse, culminating in &quot;Contact&quot; (1985) on the British military presence in Northern Ireland, &quot;Billy the Kid and the Green Baize Vampire&quot; (1985), &quot;Road&quot; (1987), and &quot;Elephant&quot; (1989).

Many of the films that Clarke directed from this period are often seen as bleak and lacking redemptive qualities – the 1986 BBC film &quot;Christine&quot; dealt with teenage drug addiction whilst &quot;Road&quot; featured a cast of characters in the depressed estates of Northern England. &quot;Elephant&quot;, lasting only 37 minutes, dealt with &#x27;the troubles&#x27; in Northern Ireland by featuring a series of shootings with no narrative and minimal dialogue; all were based on accounts of actual sectarian killings that had taken place in Belfast. The film took its title from Bernard MacLaverty&#x27;s description of the troubles as &quot;the elephant in our living room&quot; – a reference to the collective denial of the underlying social problems of Northern Ireland. His final production of Al Hunter&#x27;s &quot;The Firm&quot; (1989), covered football hooliganism through the lead character played by Gary Oldman, but also explored the politics of Thatcher&#x27;s Britain. Like several of Clarke&#x27;s previous films, the screening of &quot;The Firm&quot; as part of BBC 2&#x27;s &quot;Screen Two&quot; series was controversial and criticised by some of the British Press as being too violent and sexually explicit. Like &quot;Christine&quot;, &quot;Road&quot; and &quot;Elephant&quot;, &quot;The Firm&quot; was also notable for Clarke&#x27;s use of the steadicam, partly inspired by its earlier use in films by Stanley Kubrick like &quot;The Shining&quot;.

In 1990, Clarke travelled to America in order to pursue the idea of developing a US-based career in filmmaking. Prior to his death he was making initial plans to film &quot;Assassination On Embassy Row&quot;, later retitled &quot;An American Murder&quot;, about a murder filmed from the assassin&#x27;s point-of-view. The film never came to fruition, partly due to a lack of interest from the major US film studios and Clarke&#x27;s declining health. Another project, a script by David Yallop entitled &quot;In God&#x27;s Name&quot;, also went unmade as Clarke began radiotherapy for cancer which by that time had spread from his lungs to his spine.

In 1991, a documentary on him, &quot;Director Alan Clarke&quot; by Corin Campbell-Hill, aired on British TV. In 2016, all of Clarke&#x27;s surviving work for the BBC was released in a two-part DVD/Blu-Ray collection titled &quot;Dissent &amp; Disruption: Alan Clarke at the BBC&quot;. This set included the first official release of the 1976 documentary &quot;Bukovsky&quot; alongside extensive interviews with many of Clarke&#x27;s collaborators and contemporaries.

Clarke has inspired others, such as the director Nick Love, to direct films founded upon social realism. Love stated that watching Clarke&#x27;s &quot;The Firm&quot; had motivated him to become a filmmaker.

==Personal life==
Clarke died on 24 July 1990 after suffering from lung cancer. He was 54.

Clarke&#x27;s son is Gabriel Clarke, a sports journalist with ITV. His daughter is Molly Clarke.

==Cultural influences==
Musician Annie Locke was a close friend of Clarke for many years, and they worked together on &quot;The Love-Girl and the Innocent&quot;. After Clarke&#x27;s death, she wrote a suite of pieces in his memory, entitled &quot;A Man Called Alan&quot;.

Clarke inspired a generation of actors, writers and directors, including Paul Greengrass, Stephen Frears, Tim Roth, Ray Winstone, Gary Oldman, Danny Brocklehurst and Iain MacDonald. Filmmakers Harmony Korine and Joel Potrykus have cited Clarke as a major influence on their work. As documented in the series &quot; The Story of Film&quot; by Mark Cousins, the 2003 movie &quot;Elephant&quot; by Gus Van Sant about the Columbine High School Massacre was named after and influenced by Clarke&#x27;s earlier work of the same title, especially by Clarke&#x27;s penchant for long take tracking shots, often following one or more characters from the rear as they move through space. James Marsh&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;Shadow Dancer&quot; makes specific homage to the walking scenes in 1987 television play &quot;Christine&quot;.

Critic David Thomson has observed, &quot;No one has ever grasped the central metaphor of cramped existence in walking as well as Alan Clarke.&quot;

<text>Jean Ziegler (; born Hans Ziegler, 19 April 1934) is a Swiss former professor of sociology at the University of Geneva and the Sorbonne, Paris, and former vice-president of the Advisory Committee to the United Nations Human Rights Council. He was previously Member of the Swiss Parliament for the Social Democrats from 1981 to 1999. He has also held several positions with the United Nations, especially as Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food from 2000 to 2008, and as a member of the Advisory Committee of the UN Human Rights Council from 2008 to 2012. Ziegler has authored numerous works, is a lecturer, and is well known for this sentence: &quot;A child who dies from hunger is a murdered child.&quot;

== Early life and teaching career ==
Jean Ziegler was born on 19 April 1934 in Thun, Switzerland. His father was the president of the town&#x27;s court and a reserve artillery colonel.

Ziegler married and had one son. He studied at the universities of Bern and Geneva and has doctorates in Law and Sociology. He also earned his barrister brevet at the bar association of Geneva. In 1952, he met Abbé Pierre in Paris, and became the first director of the Emmaus charitable community of Geneva. In 1964, Ziegler admired the Cuban rebels, and was Che Guevara&#x27;s chauffeur in Geneva.

Ziegler was professor at the University of Grenoble and until 2002 at the University of Geneva and at the Graduate Institute of Development Studies, where he taught sociology. He also held the position of associate professor at the Sorbonne in Paris.

== Election and appointment to public offices ==

In 1963, Jean Ziegler was elected at the municipal council of Geneva as a social democrat. From 1967 to 1983 and from 1987 to 1999, he held a seat at the Swiss National Council. While there, he was the president of the &quot;Swiss-Third World&quot; parliamentary group. He joined the commissions for foreign affairs, science and international trade.

Nominated by Switzerland, he was the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food from 2000 to 2008. Following Ziegler&#x27;s election, the Swiss government stated that it &quot;attaches great importance to human rights and is pleased that a Swiss candidate will be able to contribute his expertise to the committee.&quot; As one of the 18 initial members of the Advisory Committee to the United Nations Human Rights Council who were elected on 26 March 2008, Jean Ziegler served a one-year term receiving forty of forty-seven votes in 2008 to finish first in a field of seven candidates. He concluded his second term 30 September 2012, but was reelected on 26 September 2013 with a term lasting until 30 September 2016. He is also a member of the advisory board of the non-profit organization Business Crime Control which targets white-collar crime.

== Honors ==
Jean Ziegler was made knight (chevalier) of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1994. He has an honorary degree from the University of Mons in Belgium. He was awarded the Medal of the Presidency of the Italian Republic. The Republic of Cape Verde awarded him the National Order of Amílcar Cabral, first degree. He received the Gaddafi Human Rights Prize in 2002.

On 17 January 2009, he received an honorary degree from the University of Paris VIII. He is a member of the Advisory Board of the left-wing South East European magazine &quot;Novi Plamen&quot; In Austria, Ziegler was awarded with the &quot;Federal State Salzburg prize for future research&quot; by Federal State Salzburg Governor Gabi Burgstaller on 20 November 2008.

He was honored with ethecon&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Blue Planet Award&quot; for his &quot;outstanding efforts towards humanitarian ethics&quot;.

== Issues during diplomatic career ==
As a United Nations official, Ziegler has dealt with both general worldwide issues such as the use of biofuels, as well as country-specific issues. Regarding the former, Ziegler has criticised the uptake of biofuels because their production can come at the expense of growing food. On 26 October 2007, Ziegler told a news conference at the UN that &quot;it&#x27;s a crime against humanity to convert agricultural productive soil into oil ... which will be burned into biofuel... What has to be stopped is ... the growing catastrophe of the massacre (by) hunger in the world.&quot;
=== Swiss banks ===
In 1997, Ziegler alleged that Swiss banking officials were lying to protect the assets of Mobutu Sese Seko, former President of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Ziegler said: &quot;This is grotesque... This is a financial empire and it is here in Switzerland.&quot; In 1994, he had already proposed to the Swiss parliament to confiscate the finances of Mobutu and give it back to the country after the end of Mobutu&#x27;s dictatorship, but his proposal was declined.

Ziegler also criticized the Swiss banks in connection with the dormant accounts scandal. In 1998, he testified before Senator Alfonse D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s hearing on the assets of Holocaust victims by the US Senate Banking Committee, against the Swiss banks and in support of the claims of the World Jewish Congress. His book &quot;The Swiss, the Gold and the Dead: How Swiss Bankers Helped Finance the Nazi War Machine&quot; was published in America in 1998.

=== Gaddafi Prize and Roger Garaudy ===
A prize foundation fund in the name of Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi was established in Geneva in 1989, and Nelson Mandela was selected the first recipient of the fund&#x27;s Gaddafi International Human Rights Prize. Some newspaper accounts have identified Ziegler as one of the panel members who administered the fund in 1989. He has denied launching the award, however, and has said that he was merely &quot;consulted.&quot; Although Libya funded the award, its winners were to be chosen by the Swiss foundation, and Ziegler said that &quot;ironclad guarantees&quot; had been established to ensure that &quot;Tripoli&#x27;s influence would not be felt.&quot;

Gaddafi Prize officials announced thirteen disparate winners in 2002, including Ziegler and the French philosopher and convicted Holocaust denier Roger Garaudy. &quot;Agence France-Press&quot; noted the irony of Ziegler, who had worked for Holocaust reparations in Switzerland, sharing the award with Garaudy. Ziegler turned down the prize, saying that he &quot;could not accept an award or distinction from any country because of my responsibilities at the United Nations.&quot;

Ziegler&#x27;s alleged associations with the Gaddafi Prize has been the subject of criticism. Alan Johnson, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; online in 2008, criticized Ziegler for &quot;launching&quot; the prize four months after the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 (which many believe to have been the work of Libyan agents). Joshua Muravchik from the American Enterprise Institute also criticized his involvement with the award in a 2006 article for the &quot;Weekly Standard&quot;.

On 25 March 2011, the Swiss television channel Schweizer Fernsehen ran a report on Ziegler&#x27;s alleged associations with Gaddafi. The piece included criticism of Ziegler from Pierre Weiss, a sociologist and member of the Swiss Liberal Party. Ziegler, for his part, said that he was never a friend of Gaddafi and repeated his claim that he never oversaw the Human Rights Prize.

The following month, the Salzburg Music Festival withdrew an invitation to Ziegler to speak at the event&#x27;s opening, citing his alleged links to Gaddafi. In the same period, Ziegler said that he now regarded Gaddafi as &quot;completely mad&quot; and as a psychopath and murderer.

In 1996, Ziegler signed a letter of support for Roger Garaudy. He later clarified that he intended to express &quot;his respect for Garaudy&#x27;s battle against all fundamentalisms — and Muslim fundamentalism, in particular,&quot; and that he &quot;most firmly condemned all revisionist activity or ideas whose purpose is to deny or to minimize the genocide of the Jewish people by the Nazis.&quot;

=== Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and South Africa ===
During the Ethiopian famine of the mid-1980s, Ziegler described the world as an &quot;immense extermination camp&quot;, wherein 40,000 people died of hunger every day. He blamed this on an economic system that allowed the rich to become richer, and the poor to become poorer.

Some of Ziegler&#x27;s critics have accused him of working as an adviser to Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam in the drafting of Ethiopia&#x27;s 1986 constitution, which established the country as a one-party state.

Ziegler defended the principle of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe&#x27;s land reforms in 2002, saying that Mugabe had &quot;history and morality on his side&quot;. He described agrarian reforms as &quot;an absolute necessity&quot; in Zimbabwe and South Africa, and was quoted as saying:

He added that Mugabe&#x27;s land reforms were being undertaken &quot;in a despicable context&quot;, however, and said that agrarian reform under democratic conditions would bring &quot;equitable distribution of the property titles to rural communities&quot;. He also clarified that he was speaking in a personal context, and not as a representative of the United Nations.

=== Iraq and its wars with the United States ===
During the buildup to the 1990 Gulf War, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein took several Swiss nationals in Iraq as hostages. Ziegler was involved in efforts to release them, initially working with former Algerian President Ahmed Ben Bella and later traveling to Baghdad himself as part of an independent delegation that managed to secure the release of some hostages. The Swiss government did not endorse this effort, and Ziegler argued that his delegation could have freed all of the hostages had the government agreed to allow the export to Iraq of medicines and powdered milk for children.

Prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Ziegler proposed that Saddam Hussein be granted a Swiss exile to prevent war from breaking out. The Swiss government did not take up this proposal. After the invasion, Ziegler accused Coalition forces of using water and food as weapons of war in Iraqi cities under attack by insurgents, to encourage civilians to flee.

=== Cuba and its relations with the United States ===
Ziegler has praised Cuba, stating in November 2007 that it is a world model for how it provides its people with food and praised it for cooperating with the United Nations and agreeing to allow him to report on the country&#x27;s respect for the &quot;right to food.&quot; Regarding a visit he made to Cuba, Ziegler stated: &quot;We cannot say that the right to food is totally respected in Cuba, but we have not seen a single malnourished person.&quot; Ziegler&#x27;s trip to Cuba was the first in several years by a U.N. rights rapporteur, and his invitation to Havana followed a decision by the U.N. Human Rights Council to stop scrutinizing Cuban human rights abuses.

According to &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, Ziegler believes that the United States is an &#x27;imperialist dictatorship&#x27; that is guilty, among other atrocities, of &#x27;genocide&#x27; against the people of Cuba by means of its trade embargo.&quot;

=== Comments about Israel ===
Ziegler criticized Israel&#x27;s conduct in the 2006 Lebanon War, stating that the International Criminal Court should investigate whether Israel is guilty of war crimes for a bombing campaign in Lebanon that blocked access to food and water. Specifically, Ziegler stated that &quot;The government of Israel should be held responsible under international law for the violations of the right to food of the Lebanese civilian population.&quot;

Itzhak Levanon, Israel&#x27;s ambassador to the UN responded that &quot;In all of his reports, Mr. Ziegler always transgresses the limits of his mandate. The latest report – which touches upon several external issues – is no exception.&quot; Israel said that Ziegler&#x27;s report focused only on the impact of Israeli bombing in Lebanon and did not cover the effects of Hezbollah rocket fire on northern Israel.&quot;

Ziegler, according to a pro-Palestinian website, stated on television that &quot;the Israeli occupation is a colonial regime and an illegal military occupation from the UN&#x27;s point of view, it continues to annex more Palestinian lands; and thus the Israeli occupation is the worst in the history of colonialism.&quot;

In 2005, Ziegler likened Gaza to &quot;an immense concentration camp&quot;, adding that he was glad the &quot;guards&quot; were about to leave (this was a reference to Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement plan under Ariel Sharon&#x27;s government). Ziegler later rejected as &quot;absurd and patently false&quot; the suggestion that he had compared Israelis to Nazis, saying that he was actually quoting an Israeli scholar when he made the remark.

=== Interactions with North Korea ===
Ziegler had several interactions with the government of North Korea while serving as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food. In 2001, he reported that some of the one million tonnes of aid provided by the World Food Programme had been taken by the army, the secret services and the government. In April 2004, a writer in the &quot;Asian Wall Street Journal&quot; called on North Korea to accept Ziegler&#x27;s repeated requests for a visit, and to help establish an accountable network for food aid. Later in the same year, Ziegler said that five of his requests to visit North Korea had been turned down by officials in Pyongyang.

== Criticisms ==
Ziegler&#x27;s appointment as U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food was criticized by &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, on the grounds that Ziegler is a sociologist by training and had no particular expertise on food or agriculture.

Ziegler&#x27;s appointment was also criticized by an independent group of political figures including Irwin Cotler and Per Ahlmark. This group criticized Ziegler for his associations with figures such as Mengistu Haile Mariam and Robert Mugabe, his involvement with the Gaddafi Prize, and his support for Roger Garaudy. Their letter opposing Ziegler was issued by the group UN Watch.

In March 2008, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-American and the ranking Republican on the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, sharply criticized Ziegler&#x27;s appointment as an advisor to the UN Human Rights Council. Ros-Lehtinen&#x27;s stated:

Ros-Lehtinen also accused Ziegler of ignoring various famine emergencies using &quot;his platform to consistently attack America and Israel&quot;.

The American Jewish Committee (AJC) opposed Ziegler&#x27;s bid for re-election to the UN Human Rights Office in 2009. The AJC cited his past support for Roger Garaudy and his criticisms of Israel.

<text>CFQC-DT (channel 8) is a television station in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, part of the CTV Television Network. Owned and operated by network parent Bell Media, the station has studios on 1st Avenue North and 23rd Street East in the Central Business District neighbourhood of Saskatoon, and its transmitter is located near Highway 41 and Burgheim Road, northeast of the city.

Master control facilities are located at the studios of CFCN-DT in Calgary, shared with eight other CTV owned-and-operated stations in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan.

==History==

CFQC-TV first signed on the air on December 5, 1954; it was originally owned by the Murphy family along with CFQC radio (AM 600, now CKBL-FM at 92.9). The first program broadcast (other than test patterns) was a film of the 42nd Grey Cup game, followed by assorted entertainment programs and the station&#x27;s first newscast. CFQC reported the next day that 40,000 viewers had tuned in, with the station&#x27;s signal reported to have been received as far away as south of Regina.

Initially a CBC affiliate, as early as 1967, the Murphys wanted to switch to CTV. However, these plans were put on hold in November 1967 when the federal government denied an application for a new CBC station, citing budget cuts, among other reasons. Eventually, however, Regina&#x27;s CBKRT (now CBKT) won permission to set up a rebroadcaster in Saskatoon. CFQC-TV, meanwhile, started airing CTV programs on tape delay in 1969, becoming a full-time CTV affiliate on October 17, 1971, when CBKST signed on as a rebroadcaster of CBKRT.
The Murphy family bowed out of broadcasting in 1972 and sold CFQC-AM-TV to Baton Broadcasting, owners of CTV&#x27;s flagship station, CFTO-TV in Toronto. There were some concerns that the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would not approve of one person owning two CTV stations, especially if that person was Baton, by far the largest and richest station owner. At the time, CTV was a cooperative based on the concept of &quot;one owner, one vote.&quot; However, a provision in the cooperative&#x27;s bylaws provided that if one owner ever bought a second station, the acquired station&#x27;s shares would be redistributed among the other seven owners so that each owner would still have only one vote out of eight. The CRTC approved the deal in late 1972, and the Murphy family earned a handsome return on patriarch Pappy Murphy&#x27;s original investment when he founded CFQC radio in 1923.

In 1986, Baton purchased CKCK-TV in Regina and CBC/CTV twinsticks in Yorkton and Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. Eventually, CFQC-TV became the centre of Baton&#x27;s Saskatchewan operations. In 1987, Baton&#x27;s six Saskatchewan stations began branding as the Saskatchewan Television Network, which joined with Baton&#x27;s Ontario stations in 1994 as the Baton Broadcast System. Baton bought controlling interest in CTV in 1997, making CFQC-TV a CTV owned-and-operated station.

In the past, it identified itself as &quot;CFQC&quot;, &quot;TV8&quot; and (during much of the 1970s and &#x27;80s) &quot;QC8, Saskatoon Television.&quot; Although now known as &quot;CTV Saskatoon&quot;, per the current branding standards for CTV affiliates, many longtime viewers in central and northern Saskatchewan still refer to the station as &quot;QC&quot; or &quot;QC8&quot;. The QC8 branding continued to be used even after the station began to air on channel 9 for those who subscribed to cable television.

A number of local programs were produced at CFQC&#x27;s Saskatoon studios over the years. Children&#x27;s television host Helen Lumby hosted a kindergarten-focused show at CFQC in her early career, before moving on to create &quot;Size Small&quot;. In the 1970s and 1980s, the station aired a number of public affairs programs, often with titles playing on the &quot;Q&quot; element of the station identity, such as &quot;Big Q Country&quot; (political discussion) and &quot;Q-Line&quot; (a phone-in program where viewers could ask questions of civic leaders, among others). CFQC also produced a companion program to the national &quot;Canada AM&quot; morning show titled &quot;Saskatchewan AM&quot;, which combined local news with children&#x27;s programming such as reruns of &quot;Rocket Robin Hood&quot;.

From 1954 until 1991, CFQC-TV shared some on-air personnel such as newsreaders with CFQC-AM, as well as studio facilities. This ended when CFQC-AM was sold. The radio station continued to share the CFQC call letters after it moved to the FM dial in 1995 (though for promotional purposes it was rebranded Hot93). In 2007, CFQC-FM officially changed call letters to CKBL-FM, leaving the TV station the only user of the original call letters dating back to 1923.

As with its Regina sister station, CFQC&#x27;s programming is aired in pattern with that of Winnipeg sister station CKY-DT, with prime time programming running from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. simultaneously with east coast stations, and CTV&#x27;s 7 p.m. ET programming bumped to 10 p.m. However, as Saskatchewan does not observe daylight saving time and remains on Central Standard Time year-round, programming is delayed by an hour in comparison to CKY when DST is in effect. As with all other CTV stations in Saskatchewan, it broadcasts the annual &quot;Telemiracle&quot; telethon (which alternates between Saskatoon and Regina on a yearly cycle) in March, supporting the Kinsmen and Kinettes of Saskatchewan.

==News operation==
As of September 15, 2023, CFQC-DT broadcasts 10 hours of news programming presented from CFQC&#x27;s Saskatoon studios each week (two hours each weekday). An additional 24 hours of provincial news programming per week from CTV Regina is simulcast on CFQC.

Alumni of CFQC&#x27;s news department include Keith Morrison, who went on to become the weekend anchor of the &quot;CTV National News&quot; before joining NBC, and Don Wittman, who became a sports commentator for the CBC. Dawna Friesen, after a stint at CFQC, furthered her career in U.S. broadcast journalism before becoming anchor of the Global network&#x27;s national newscast &quot;Global National&quot; in 2010. Natasha Staniszewski had a stint with CFQC from 2007 to 2009, became a co-anchor for the late-night edition of SportsCentre on TSN, and is now a media host for the CFL&#x27;s Calgary Stampeders and the NHL&#x27;s Calgary Flames. Jim McCrory worked for CFQC in various capacities from 1963 to his retirement in 2001; McCrory died in January 2012. One of the longest-serving alumni of the station was Greg Barnsley, who joined CFQC when it first went on the air in the 1950s and remained as a general-duties host and weather forecaster until his retirement in the mid-1990s.

Newscaster Rob MacDonald was the longest-serving on-air personality, being part of CFQC from March 15, 1976, until his retirement on January 20, 2017. Sportscaster Kevin Waugh worked at the station for close to 40 years, prior to his election as a Member of Parliament for Saskatoon—Grasswood in the 2015 Canadian federal election. Waugh and Barnsley &quot;flipped the switch&quot; that officially transferred CFQC to digital broadcasts in 2011. With the retirement of Craig Wilson in early 2019, Jeff Rogstad is currently the longest serving on-air personality active at the station.

CFQC&#x27;s newscasts are also broadcast by CIPA-TV in Prince Albert, since that station does not broadcast a local 6 or 11:30 p.m. newscast. As a result, CFQC&#x27;s program regularly includes reports from Prince Albert.

From at least the late 1980&#x27;s until 1994 (when it became part of BBS and branded its newscasts as &quot;CFQC-TV News&quot;), CFQC was one of only two television stations in Canada known to have adopted the &quot;NewsCentre&quot; branding (a Canadian variation on the popular American &quot;NewsCenter&quot; branding) for its local newscasts, the other being CBC owned and operated affiliate CBUT in Vancouver, which used it briefly in the mid- to late-1980&#x27;s.

Effective September 15, 2023, CFQC no longer broadcasts local morning, 5 p.m., 11:30 p.m., or weekend evening newscasts from its studios. These local shows were replaced with province-wide news programming originating from CTV Regina, which includes news stories and other content from the Saskatoon newsroom. The noon and 6 p.m. newscasts continued to be presented and broadcast from the CFQC studios. These changes were a result of cutbacks enacted by CTV&#x27;s parent company, Bell Media, on June 14, 2023. Previously, on October 21, 2017, CFQC had ended broadcast of a stand-alone weekly farm magazine program, Farmgate, in favour of incorporating the segments into its regular newscasts. Up to that point, Farmgate had been the most-watched agricultural program in Saskatchewan and ran for almost three decades.

CFQC&#x27;s noon newscast was cancelled on February 8, 2024, as part of nationwide programming cuts by Bell Media.

==Radio station==
The CFQC call letters were originally assigned to an AM radio station that began broadcasting in Saskatoon in 1923 under the ownership of the Murphy family. From 1953 to 1991, the television and radio stations were under common ownership (first the Murphys, then Baton), for a time sharing broadcast facilities and on-air personnel. Baton exited radio in 1991, and CFQC radio moved into its own studio facility. In 1995, the station moved to the FM dial where it became CFQC-FM or &quot;Hot 93&quot;. In November 2007, the station changed its call letters to CKBL-FM and it adopted the branding &quot;The Bull&quot;.

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
On August 31, 2011, when Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts, CFQC shut down analog signal and flash cut its digital signal into operation on VHF channel 8 at approximately 12:05 a.m. CT. The ceremonial switchover was conducted by longtime sports anchor Kevin Waugh and now-retired veteran CFQC broadcaster Greg Barnsley, who had been involved with the station when it first signed on the air.

===Former transmitters===
* CFQC-TV-1 Stranraer
* CFQC-TV-2 North Battleford

On July 30, 2019, Bell Media was granted permission to close down the analog transmitters for CFQC-TV-1 and CFQC-TV-2 as part of Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2019-268. Both transmitters were shut down by February 26, 2021.

<doc id="730564" wikidata="Q2593459" url="?curid=730564" title="Provisional Government of Hawaii">
<text>The Provisional Government of Hawaii (abbr.: P.G.; Hawaiian: &quot;Aupuni Kūikawā o Hawaiʻi&quot;) was proclaimed after the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom on January 17, 1893, by the 13-member Committee of Safety under the leadership of its chairman Henry E. Cooper and former judge Sanford B. Dole as the designated President of Hawaii. It replaced the Kingdom of Hawaii after the overthrow of Queen Liliuokalani as a provisional government until the Republic of Hawaii was established on July 4, 1894.

== Provisional government ==
Following the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, the coup leaders established the Provisional Government and set out to effect Hawaii&#x27;s speedy annexation by the United States. The provisional government sent a commission including Lorrin A. Thurston to the U.S. and negotiated a treaty with President Benjamin Harrison that was quickly sent to the U.S. Senate for approval. At the same time Princess Victoria Kaiulani was in Washington D.C. to campaign for the monarchist side and against the coup, which she decried as illegal.

Shortly after assuming office in March 1893, President Grover Cleveland, himself an anti-imperialist, withdrew the treaty and ordered a congressional investigation into the events surrounding the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. After receiving the committee&#x27;s official report (that July), Cleveland stated that the U.S. had unlawfully used military force and called for the reinstatement of Queen Liliuokalani. The matter was referred by Cleveland to Congress after Sanford Dole refused Cleveland&#x27;s demands, and the U.S. Senate held an unofficial investigation, culminating in the Morgan Report, which completely rejected that there had been any U.S. involvement in the overthrow. After the findings of this committee were submitted, Cleveland reiterated his position, and denounced the Provisional Government as being neither &quot;de facto&quot; or &quot;de jure&quot;.

== Hawaiian Army ==
Following the overthrow of the monarchy a military was formed on January 27, 1893, and put under the command of Colonel John Harris Soper. This military consisted of four companies: three national guard companies and one regular army company. The national guard companies were: the A Company made up of ethnic German volunteers, commanded by Charles W. Zeigler; B Company made up of members of the Honolulu Rifles, commanded by Hugh Gunn; and C Company made up of ethnic Portuguese volunteers, commanded by Joseph M. Camara. The regulars were D company made up, like B Company, from the Honolulu Rifles, commanded by John Good.

The military was active under the Provisional Government of Hawaii where they were activated in the Leprosy War in 1893 and the Republic of Hawaii and were again activated during the 1895 Counter-Revolution in Hawaii in 1895. After Hawaii was annexed becoming the Territory of Hawaii in 1898, the companies entered the Army National Guard system and became part of the Hawaii Army National Guard.

== Home front ==
Under the new administration the Government was made more restrictive, including denying citizenship to Chinese immigrants. The Hawaii Department of Education drove the Hawaiian language to near extinction in favor of English. They also restricted voting from 14,000 under the Bayonet Constitution to 4,000 people, most of them politicians in power of the population of approximately 100,000. James Henderson Blount would comment on this disproportion of voters and population in his report Blount Report.

The testimony of leading annexationists is that if the question of annexation was submitted to a popular vote, excluding all persons who could not read and write except foreigners (under the Australian-ballot system, which is the law of the land), that annexation would be defeated.

== Blount investigation ==

The first order of business for the Provisional Government after the overthrow of Liliuokalani was to form an interim government while Lorrin A. Thurston was in Washington, DC, to negotiate annexation with Congress. One group proposed the assumption of power of Princess Kaʻiulani while a body formed by the Committee of Safety could act as a regency government. With the physical absence of the princess from the islands, the proposal was immediately struck down.

The Provisional Government was dealt a huge blow when United States President Benjamin Harrison, who was supportive of the annexation of Hawaii, was voted out of the White House. Grover Cleveland, an anti-imperialist, assumed the presidency and right away worked to stop the treaty of annexation. Just a month before Cleveland became president, Lorrin A. Thurston had struck a deal with Congress as it prepared to ratify a treaty of annexation. Cleveland, having heard the appeals of Princess Kaʻiulani on behalf of her imprisoned aunt, withdrew the treaty and launched an investigation of the matter.

Cleveland appointed James Henderson Blount of Macon, Georgia, as Commissioner Paramount and Minister to Hawaii. His chief mission was to investigate the overthrow of Liliuokalani&#x27;s government. Blount concluded in his report that the overthrow had utilized the aid of the John L. Stevens, United States Minister to Hawaii who ordered the landing of troops from the USS &quot;Boston&quot;. On the basis of Blount&#x27;s report, Cleveland sent Albert Sydney Willis of Kentucky to Honolulu as Minister to Hawaii with secret instructions. Willis, initially rebuffed by the queen, obtained Liliuokalani&#x27;s promise to grant an amnesty after a considerable delay. After securing that promise, Willis made a formal demand for the dissolution of the Provisional Government and complete restoration of the monarchy, although unbeknownst to him by that time it was too late since Cleveland had already referred the matter to Congress. Taking the demand at face value, on December 23, 1893, Sanford B. Dole sent a reply to Willis flatly refusing to surrender the authority of the Provisional Government to the deposed queen.

== Morgan investigation ==
In response to Cleveland&#x27;s referral of the matter, the Senate passed a resolution empowering its Foreign Relations Committee to hold public hearings under oath, and cross-examine witnesses, to investigate U.S. involvement in the revolution and also to investigate whether it had been proper for President Cleveland to appoint Blount and give him extraordinary powers to represent the U.S. and intervene in Hawaii without Senate confirmation. John Tyler Morgan, an expansionist pro-annexation Senator from Alabama, chaired the commission.

On February 26, 1894, the Morgan Report was submitted. It concluded that the U.S. troops had remained completely neutral during the overthrow, exonerated Minister Stevens in landing troops, and concluded Blount&#x27;s appointment and investigation without congressional approval were constitutional. However, the nine-member Senate Foreign Relations Committee that submitted the report could not agree on a final conclusion, and the oft-executive summary was signed only by Morgan himself.

Following the Morgan Report, and the Turpie Resolution on May 31, 1894, in which Congress prohibited any further intervention by the president and other government officials against the Provisional Government of Hawaii, Cleveland officially declared the Provisional Government as &quot;neither de jure nor de facto&quot;.

On February 7, 1894, the US House of Representatives issued the following resolution:
In the U.S. House of Representatives, Feb. 7, 1894:

Resolved First. That it is the sense of this House that the action of the United States minister in employing United States naval forces and illegally aiding in overthrowing the constitutional Government of the Hawaiian Islands in January, 1893, and in setting up in its place a Provisional Government not republican in form and in opposition to the will of a majority of the people, was contrary to the traditions of our Republic and the spirit of our Constitution, and should be and is condemned.

Second. That we heartily approve the principle announced by the President of the United States that interference with the domestic affairs of an independent nation is contrary to the spirit of American institutions. And it is further the sense of this House that the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands to our country, or the assumption of a protectorate over them by our Government, is uncalled for and inexpedient; that the people of that country should have had absolute freedom and independence in pursuing their own line of policy, and that foreign intervention in the political affairs of the islands will not be regarded with indifference by the Government of the United States.

== Republic of Hawaii ==
Following the Morgan Report, and the Turpie Resolution which stated a policy of non-interference in Hawaiian affairs by the U.S., Lorrin A. Thurston and the Provisional Government of Hawaii convened a constitutional convention and established the Republic of Hawaii. This government maintained power until the U.S. annexed Hawaii in 1898 with the Newlands Resolution.

<doc id="730569" wikidata="Q968225" url="?curid=730569" title="Count of Toulouse">
<text>The count of Toulouse (, ) was the ruler of Toulouse during the 8th to 13th centuries. Originating as vassals of the Frankish kings, 
the hereditary counts ruled the city of Toulouse and its surrounding county from the late 9th century until 1270. The counts and other family members were also at various times counts of Quercy, Rouergue, Albi, and Nîmes, and sometimes margraves (military defenders of the Holy Roman Empire) of Septimania and Provence. 
Count Raymond IV founded the Crusader state of Tripoli, and his descendants were also counts there.
They reached the zenith of their power during the 11th and 12th centuries, but after the Albigensian Crusade the county fell to the kingdom of France, nominally in 1229 and &quot;de facto&quot; in 1271.

Later the title was revived for Louis Alexandre, Count of Toulouse, a bastard of Louis XIV (1678–1737).

==History==

===Carolingian era===

During the youth of young Louis the Pious his tutor, Torson (sometimes Chorso or Choson), ruled at Toulouse as the first count. In 788, Count Torson was captured by the Basques under Adalric, who made him swear an oath of allegiance to the Duke of Gascony, Lupus II. Upon his release, Charlemagne, at the diet of Worms (790), replaced him with his Frankish cousin, William of Gellone. William in turn successfully subdued the Gascons.

In the ninth century, Toulouse suffered in common with the rest of western Europe. It was besieged by Charles the Bald in 844, and taken four years later by the Normans, who had sailed up the Garonne. About 852, Raymond I, count of Quercy, succeeded his brother Fredelo as Count of Rouergue and Toulouse. It is from Raymond that all the later counts of Toulouse document their descent. His grandchildren divided their parents&#x27; estates; of these Raymond II became count of Toulouse, and Ermengol, count of Rouergue; while the hereditary titles of Septimania, Quercy and Albi were shared between them.

Raymond II&#x27;s grandson, William III (known as the first William Taillefer), married Emma of Provence, and handed down part of that lordship to his younger son Bertrand I of Forcalquier.

William&#x27;s elder son, Pons, left two children, one of whom, William IV succeeded his father in Toulouse, Albi and Quercy; while the younger, Raymond IV, ruled the vast possessions of the counts of Rouergue.

===High Middle Ages===

From this time on, the counts of Toulouse were powerful lords in southern France. Raymond IV, assumed the formal titles of Marquis of Provence, Duke of Narbonne and Count of Toulouse. Afterward, the count set sail with the First Crusade. After the conquest of Jerusalem, he set siege to the City of Tripoli in the Levant. Raymond died before the city was taken in 1109, but is considered the first Count of Tripoli. His son, Bertrand, then took the title. He and his successors ruled the Crusader state until 1187 (when the Kingdom of Jerusalem was overrun by Saladin).

While Raymond was away in the Holy Land, rule of Toulouse was seized by William IX, Duke of Aquitaine, who claimed the city by right of his wife, Philippa, the daughter of William IV; William was unable to hold it long. Raymond&#x27;s son and successor, Bertrand, had followed him to the Holy Land in 1109. Therefore, at Raymond&#x27;s death the family&#x27;s great estates and Toulouse went to Bertrand&#x27;s brother, Alfonso Jordan. His rule, however, was disturbed by the ambition of William IX and his granddaughter, Eleanor of Aquitaine, who urged her husband Louis VII of France to support her claims to Toulouse by war. Upon her divorce from Louis and her subsequent marriage to Henry II of England, Eleanor pressed her claims through Henry, who at last, in 1173, forced Raymond V to do him homage for Toulouse.

Raymond V, a patron of the troubadours, died in 1194, and was succeeded by his son, Raymond VI. Following the 1208 assassination of the Papal legate, Pierre de Castelnau, Raymond was excommunicated and the County of Toulouse was placed under interdict by Pope Innocent III. Raymond was eager to appease the Pope, and was pardoned. However, following a second excommunication, Raymond&#x27;s holdings in the Languedoc were desolated by the Albigensian Crusade, led by Simon de Montfort. Raymond&#x27;s forces were defeated in 1213, depriving him of his fees, and he was exiled to England. Montfort finally occupied Toulouse in 1215.

Raymond VII succeeded his father in 1222. He left an only daughter, Joan, who married Alphonse, the son of Louis VIII of France and brother of Louis IX of France. At the deaths of Alfonse and Joan in 1271, the vast holdings of the counts of Toulouse lapsed to the Crown.

===Within the kingdom of France===

In 1271,Toulouse passed to the Crown of France, by the Treaty of Meaux, 1229.
From 1271–1285, Philip III of France, King of France and nephew of Alphonse bore the title of count of Toulouse, but the mention of the title is abandoned after his death.

Only in 1681, Toulouse was resurrected as a royal appanage by Louis XIV for his illegitimate son with Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan, Louis-Alexandre.

They are Raymond (IV) (–961), Hugh (–972) and Raymond (V) (–978))

<text>Combat Academy (also known as &quot;Combat High&quot;) is a 1986 American made-for-television comedy film directed by Neal Israel. The film also features (a then-unknown) George Clooney.

==Synopsis==
Best friends Max Mendelsson (Keith Gordon) and Perry Barnett (Wally Ward) are a pair of misfit high school teenagers who always cause trouble at school. After starting the first day with a large amount of destructive pranks, the duo are suspended from school. They later get themselves into more trouble when they intentionally misdirect several construction workers into drilling on the wrong area, ultimately causing roadside damage and getting themselves arrested by the police. For their mischief, the judge (Sherman Hemsley) sentences them to serve a year in Kirkland Military School to teach them discipline.

Upon arriving in military school, the duo meets Cadet Major Biff Woods (George Clooney), Cadet Captain Kevin (Kevin Haley), and Cadet Sergeant Andrea Pritchett (Dana Hill), who constantly punish Max for his bad conduct and behavior. Max finds the time in military school unbearable and vows to find a way to get himself out. During a war game, Perry meets a fellow cadet named Mary-Beth (Tina Caspary) and falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Max again sets up another series of destructive pranks in the military school, hoping to get himself removed from the school. However, the principal and Biff&#x27;s father, General Ed Woods (Robert Culp), refuse to expel them, instead giving the two of them more punishments. Although Max is still unrepentant, Perry decides that he wants to straighten up his life and breaks off his friendship with Max.

Max eventually wins the friendship of other cadets by saving a drowning cadet and defending him from Biff, while Perry begin a budding romance with Mary-Beth. Meanwhile, cadets from a Soviet military school visits Kirkland and challenges them to a mock war game as part of their tour. During the welcome party, Biff steals a pocket watch from a Soviet guest. Max notices this and confronts Biff for his actions, but the two are caught by the General in front of everyone. Although Max tries to take the blame, Biff confesses to General Woods that he was the thief. He announces that he did this in revenge for his father, always praising him as a fine soldier but never regarding him as a son. Saddened by this, the general relieves him of his command for the upcoming mock war. Biff tries to drown his sorrows by drinking, but Max, who has reconciled with Perry, decides to set another plan to help Biff make up with his father.

The war game begins with Captain Kevin leading, and before he departs, Max gave him a stolen battle plan of the Soviet cadets. However, the Kirkland cadets were led into a trap and starts losing, and Kevin realizes Max tricked him. He resorts to cheating (continuing to fight despite being shot in-game) in order win by any means necessary. The other cadets, led by Max, bring a sleeping Biff to the battle, and asks him for leadership. Biff was initially reluctant to command this war, but Max encourages him to, and the group manage to successfully capture a group of Soviet cadets. Andrea meets up and joins them, then she and Max share a kiss. Elsewhere, Kevin manage to defeat the Soviets, who accuse them of cheating and a fight breaks out. Max intervenes to stop the fight, telling all of them that this is not a real war, and this mutual hostility between them is pointless. The two countries should not be seeing each other enemies, and neither should they. Max&#x27;s actions win the friendship and respect of the Soviets, and General Woods is happy at how Biff completed this mock war with a peaceful end, acknowledging him as his son.

The film ends with Perry leaving with Mary-Beth for Thanksgiving holiday; Max claims that he has changed his old ways, and asks Perry to burn a box with his old prank notebook. However, the box is actually full of fireworks, which gets set off when the workers burn it in front of the school gate. Max laughs at his final prank while the fellow cadets cheer and applaud him.

<doc id="730576" wikidata="Q848329" url="?curid=730576" title="Alex Ramírez">
<text>Alexander Ramón Ramírez Quiñónez (born 3 October 1974), nicknamed Ramichan, is a Venezuelan-born Japanese former professional baseball outfielder who had a long career in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). He is the first foreign-born player to record 2,000 hits while playing in NPB.

Before playing in Japan, he played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians (1998–2000) and Pittsburgh Pirates (2000). He batted and threw right-handed.

In October 2015 he was named as the BayStars manager for the 2016 season.

==Professional baseball career==

===American minor leagues===
He was named the Indians&#x27; 1998 Minor League Player of the Year (receiving the &quot;Lou Boudreau Award&quot;).

===Major League Baseball===
Ramírez made his MLB debut with the Cleveland Indians in 1998. On 28 July 2000, the Indians traded Ramírez and Enrique Wilson to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Wil Cordero. Across three MLB seasons, Ramírez batted .259 with 12 home runs, 48 runs batted in (RBI), 38 runs scored, 17 doubles, three triples, and three stolen bases in 135 games played.

===Nippon Professional Baseball career===
After the 2000 season, Ramírez signed with the Yakult Swallows (2001–2007) and was their cleanup hitter. During his final season with the Swallows he set the Central League record for most base hits in a single season with 204. (This record did not stand long as Hanshin Tigers outfielder Matt Murton surpassed Ramírez&#x27;s tally en route to finishing the 2010 season with 214 hits.)

The 2007 season, however, proved to be Ramírez&#x27;s last with the Swallows, who did offer him the multi-year contract he sought. Instead, the outfielder signed with the Yomiuri Giants for the 2008 season. Ramírez quickly flourished with his new team. In 2008, he led the Central League with 125 RBI while hitting .319 (6th in the league) with 45 home runs (2nd). He also hit two home runs in Game 2 of the Japan Series, including one in the bottom of the ninth to win Game 2. At the end of the 2008 season, Ramírez won the Central League MVP Award. He was the third Venezuelan player to be so honored in Japanese Baseball, joining Roberto Petagine (Central League, 2001) and Alex Cabrera (Pacific League, 2002).

After playing eight seasons in NPB, Ramirez obtained FA Right in 2008 and was no longer counted as a foreign player for roster purposes. As of 2017, only four foreign players in NPB history had accrued enough service time to achieve the classification.

On 6 April 2013, Ramirez hit a home run to record his 2,000 career hit in the NPB, becoming the 42nd player and the first foreign player to accomplish the feat. This accomplishment also earned Ramírez an invitation to the Meikyukai, a private club recognizing Japan&#x27;s elite players. He was the first Western player to be so honored.

=== Baseball Challenge League ===
Ramírez spent the 2014 season as a player-coach with the Gunma Diamond Pegasus of Japan&#x27;s Baseball Challenge League. In 45 games, he hit .305 with 7 home runs and 38 RBI. He retired after the 2014 season and signed on as the Diamond Pegasus&#x27; Senior Director.

===Coaching===
In the middle of the 2015 Ramírez joined the Orix Buffaloes as an advisor, mentoring younger players. In October 2015 he was named as the BayStars manager for the 2016 season, replacing Kiyoshi Nakahata who resigned at the end of the 2015 season due to the team&#x27;s poor performance. In his first season managing, the team finished 69-71-3, finishing third in the Central League, and advancing to the Climax Series, where the BayStars defeated the Yomiuri Giants, 2-1 in the first round before falling to the Hiroshima Toyo Carp, 4-1, in the league championship round. In his second year as manager, the BayStars reached the 2017 Japan Series, but lost to the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, 4-2.

==Career statistics==
&quot;Statistics current as of 21 November 2014&quot;
==Business career==
In February 2013, Ramirez started, with his wife and his son, a restaurant in Tokyo, Japan, called Ramichan Cafe, serving the cuisine of Puerto Rico, where his wife grew up. The restaurant has since closed.

Ramirez has spoken about his faith, saying, &quot;I believe (continuing to play baseball) is my desire, but it&#x27;s not my life. God has already blessed me with this career, and whatever God has planned for me, I will be happy to follow that, whether or not I play baseball again. It&#x27;s not what I want; it&#x27;s what God wants for me.&quot;

As of January 2019, he has been naturalised as a Japanese national.

<doc id="730578" wikidata="Q230744" url="?curid=730578" title="Anna Wintour">
<text>Dame Anna Wintour ( ; born 3 November 1949) is a British-American media executive, who has been serving as editor-in-chief of &quot;Vogue&quot; since 1988. Wintour has also served as global chief content officer of Condé Nast since 2020, where she oversees all Condé Nast publications worldwide, and concurrently serves as artistic director. Wintour is also global editorial director of &quot;Vogue&quot;. With her trademark pageboy bob haircut and dark sunglasses, Wintour is regarded as the most powerful woman in publishing, and has become an important figure in the fashion world, serving as the lead chairperson of the annual haute couture Met Gala global fashion spectacle in Manhattan since the 1990s. Wintour is praised for her skill in identifying emerging fashion trends, but has been criticised for her reportedly aloof and demanding personality. 

Her father, Charles Wintour, who was Editor of the London-based &quot;Evening Standard&quot; from 1959 to 1976, consulted with her on how to make the newspaper relevant to the youth of the era. She became interested in fashion as a teenager and her career in fashion journalism began at two British magazines. Later, she moved to the United States, with stints at &quot;New York&quot; and &quot;House &amp; Garden&quot;. She returned to London and was the Editor of British &quot;Vogue&quot; between 1985 and 1987. A year later, she assumed control of the franchise&#x27;s magazine in New York, reviving what many saw as a stagnating publication. Her use of the magazine to shape the fashion industry has been the subject of debate within it. Animal rights activists have attacked her for promoting fur, while other critics have charged her with using the magazine to promote elitist and unattainable views of femininity and beauty.

A former personal assistant, Lauren Weisberger, wrote the bestselling 2003 &quot;roman à clef&quot; &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;, later made into a successful 2006 film starring Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly, a fashion editor, believed to be based on Wintour. In 2009, Wintour&#x27;s editorship of &quot;Vogue&quot; was the original focus of a documentary film, R. J. Cutler&#x27;s &quot;The September Issue&quot;. The film&#x27;s focus switched to the creative teams and more senior fashion editors as filming progressed.

==Early life and education==
Wintour was born in Hampstead, London, to Charles Wintour (1917–1999), editor of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, and Eleanor &quot;Nonie&quot; Trego Baker (1917–1995). Her parents were married in 1940 and divorced in 1979. Wintour was named after her maternal grandmother, Anna Baker (née Gilkyson), a merchant&#x27;s daughter from Pennsylvania. Audrey Slaughter, a magazine editor who founded publications including &quot;Honey&quot; and &quot;Petticoat&quot;, was her stepmother.

Wintour&#x27;s grandfather was Major-General Fitzgerald Wintour, a British military officer and descendant of George Grenville, who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Through her paternal grandmother, Alice Jane Blanche Foster, Wintour is a great-great-great-granddaughter of the late-18th-century novelist Lady Elizabeth Foster, who was later the Duchess of Devonshire, and her first husband, the Irish politician John Thomas Foster. Her great-great-great-great-grandfather was Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol, who served as the Anglican Bishop of Derry. Sir Augustus Vere Foster, 4th Baronet, the last Baronet of that name, was a granduncle of Wintour&#x27;s. She is a niece of Cordelia James, Baroness James of Rusholme, the daughter of Fitzgerald Wintour.

Wintour had four siblings. Her older brother, Gerald, died in a traffic accident as a child. One of her younger brothers, Patrick, is also a journalist, currently diplomatic editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

Wintour attended North London Collegiate School, where she frequently rebelled against the dress code by taking up the hemlines of her skirts. At the age of 14, she began wearing her hair in a bob. She developed an interest in fashion as a regular viewer of Cathy McGowan on &quot;Ready Steady Go!,&quot; and from reading &quot;Seventeen&quot;, which her grandmother sent from the United States. &quot;Growing up in London in the &#x27;60s, you&#x27;d have to have had Irving Penn&#x27;s sack over your head not to know something extraordinary was happening in fashion&quot;, she recalled. Her father regularly consulted her when he was considering ideas for increasing readership in the youth market.

==Career==

===From fashion to journalism===
&quot;I think my father really decided for me that I should work in fashion&quot;, she recalled in &quot;The September Issue&quot;. He arranged for his daughter&#x27;s first job, at the influential Biba boutique, when she was 15. The next year, she left North London Collegiate and began a training program at Harrods. At her parents&#x27; behest, she also took fashion classes at a nearby school. Soon she gave them up, saying, &quot;You either know fashion or you don&#x27;t.&quot; An older boyfriend, Richard Neville, gave her her first experience of magazine production at his popular and controversial &quot;Oz&quot;.

In 1970, when &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar UK&quot; merged with &quot;Queen&quot; to become &quot;Harper&#x27;s &amp; Queen&quot;, Wintour was hired as one of its first editorial assistants, beginning her career in fashion journalism. She told her co-workers that she wanted to edit &quot;Vogue&quot;. While there, she discovered model Annabel Hodin, a former North London classmate. Her connections helped her secure locations for innovative shoots by Helmut Newton, Jim Lee and other trend-setting photographers. One recreated the works of Renoir and Manet using models in go-go boots. After chronic disagreements with her rival, Min Hogg, she quit and moved to New York with her boyfriend, freelance journalist Jon Bradshaw.

===New York City===
In her new home, she became a junior fashion editor at &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; in New York City in 1975. Wintour&#x27;s innovative shoots led editor Tony Mazzola to fire her after nine months. She was reportedly introduced to Bob Marley by one of Bradshaw&#x27;s friends, and disappeared with him for a week; in a 2017 appearance on &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot;, she said she had never actually met the reggae legend, but certainly would have &quot;hooked up&quot; with him if she had. A few months later, Bradshaw helped her get her first position as a fashion editor, at &quot;Viva&quot;, a women&#x27;s adult magazine started by Kathy Keeton, then the wife of &quot;Penthouse&quot; publisher Bob Guccione. She has rarely discussed working there, due to that connection. This was the first job at which she was able to hire a personal assistant, which began her reputation as a demanding and difficult boss.

In late 1978, Guccione shut down the unprofitable magazine. Wintour decided to take some time off from work. She broke up with Bradshaw and began a relationship with French record producer Michel Esteban, for two years dividing her time with him between Paris and New York. She returned to work in 1980, succeeding Elsa Klensch as fashion editor for a new women&#x27;s magazine named &quot;Savvy&quot;. It sought to appeal to career-conscious professional women who spent their own money, the readers Wintour would later target at &quot;Vogue&quot;.

The following year, she became fashion editor of &quot;New York.&quot; There, the fashion spreads and photo shoots she had been putting together for years finally began attracting attention. Editor Edward Kosner sometimes bent very strict rules for her and let her work on other sections of the magazine. She learned through her work on a cover involving Rachel Ward how effectively celebrity covers sold copies. &quot;Anna saw the celebrity thing coming before everyone else did&quot;, Grace Coddington said three decades later. A former colleague arranged for an interview with &quot;Vogue&quot; editor Grace Mirabella that ended when Wintour told Mirabella she wanted her job.

===Condé Nast===

She went to work at &quot;Vogue&quot; when Alex Liberman, who was then the editorial director for Condé Nast and publisher of &quot;Vogue&quot;, talked to Wintour about a position there in 1983. She eventually accepted after a bidding war that doubled her salary, becoming the magazine&#x27;s first creative director, a position with vaguely defined responsibilities. Her changes to the magazine were often made without Mirabella&#x27;s knowledge, causing friction among the staff. She began dating child psychiatrist David Shaffer, an older acquaintance from London. They married in 1984.

In 1985, Wintour attained her first editorship, taking over the UK edition of &quot;Vogue&quot; after Beatrix Miller retired. Once in charge, she replaced many of the staff and exerted far more control over the magazine than any previous editor had, earning the nickname &quot;Nuclear Wintour&quot; in the process. Those editors who were retained began to refer to the period as &quot;The Wintour of Our Discontent&quot;. Her changes moved the magazine from its traditional eccentricity to a direction more in line with the American magazine. Wintour&#x27;s ideal reader was the same woman &quot;Savvy&quot; had tried to reach. &quot;There&#x27;s a new kind of woman out there&quot;, she told the &quot;Evening Standard.&quot; &quot;She&#x27;s interested in business and money. She doesn&#x27;t have time to shop anymore. She wants to know what and why and where and how.&quot;

In 1987, Wintour returned to New York City to take over &quot;House &amp; Garden.&quot; Its circulation had long lagged behind rival &quot;Architectural Digest,&quot; and Condé Nast hoped she could improve it. Again, she made radical changes to staff and look, canceling $2 million worth of photo spreads and articles in her first week. She put so much fashion in photo spreads that it became known as &quot;&quot;House &amp; Garment&quot;,&quot; and enough celebrities that it was referred to as &quot;Vanity Chair&quot; within the industry. These changes worsened the magazine&#x27;s problems. When the title was shortened to just &quot;HG&quot;, many longtime subscribers thought they were getting a new magazine and put it aside for the real thing to arrive. Most of those subscriptions were eventually canceled and, while some fashion advertisers came over, most of the magazine&#x27;s traditional advertisers pulled out.

Ten months later, she became editor of U.S. &quot;Vogue&quot;. Industry insiders worried that under Mirabella, the magazine was losing ground to the recently-introduced American edition of &quot;Elle&quot;. After making sweeping changes in staff, Wintour changed the style of the cover pictures. Mirabella had preferred tight head shots of well-known models in studios; Wintour&#x27;s covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, like those Diana Vreeland had done years earlier. She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with high fashion: the first issue she was in charge of, November 1988, featured a Peter Lindbergh photograph of 19-year-old Michaela Bercu in a $50 pair of faded jeans and a bejeweled T-shirt by Christian Lacroix worth $10,000. It was the first time a &quot;Vogue&quot; cover model had worn jeans; when the printer saw it they called the magazine&#x27;s offices, thinking it was the wrong image.

In 2012, Wintour reflected on the cover:

Years later, Wintour admitted the photo had never been planned as the cover shot. In 2011, when &quot;Vogue&quot; put its entire archive online, Wintour was quoted as saying, &quot;I just said, &#x27;Well, let&#x27;s just try this.&#x27; And off we went. It was just very natural. To me it just said, &#x27;This is something new. This is something different.&#x27; The printers called to make sure that was supposed to be the cover, as they thought a mistake might have been made.&quot; In 2015, she said if she had to pick a favorite of her covers, it would be that one. &quot;[I]t was a leap of faith and it was certainly a big change for &quot;Vogue&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Wintour&#x27;s approach hit a nerve—this was the way real women put clothes together (with the likely exception of wearing multi-thousand-dollar T-shirts)&quot;, one reviewer says. On the June 1989 cover, model Estelle Lefebure was shown in wet hair, with just a bathrobe and no apparent makeup. Photographers, makeup artists, and hairstylists got credited along with the models. In August 2014, Gigi Hadid paid tribute to Wintour&#x27;s first cover.

She exerts a great deal of control over the magazine&#x27;s visual content. Since her first days as editor, she has required that photographers not begin until she has approved Polaroids of the setup and clothing. Afterwards, they must submit all their work to the magazine, not just their personal choices.

Her control over the text is less certain. Her staff claim she reads everything written for publication, but former editor Richard Story has claimed she rarely, if ever, reads any of &quot;Vogue&quot;″s arts coverage or book reviews. Earlier in her career, she often left writing of the text that accompanied her layouts to others; former coworkers claim she has minimal skills in that area. Today, she writes little for the magazine save the monthly editor&#x27;s letter. She reportedly has three full-time assistants but sometimes surprises callers by answering the phone herself.

===1990s===
Under her editorship, the magazine renewed its focus on fashion and returned to the prominence it had held under Vreeland. &quot;Vogue&quot; held its position as market leader against three contenders: &quot;Elle&quot;; &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, which had lured away Liz Tilberis, Wintour&#x27;s most prominent deputy, and &quot;Mirabella&quot;, a magazine Rupert Murdoch created for Wintour&#x27;s fired predecessor. Her most serious competitor was within the company: Tina Brown, editor of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and later &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

At the end of the decade, another of Wintour&#x27;s inner circle left to run &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. Kate Betts, seen as Wintour&#x27;s likely successor, had broadened the magazine&#x27;s reach by commissioning stories with a more hard-news edge, about women in politics, street culture, and the financial difficulties of some major designers. She had also added the &quot;Index&quot; section, a few pages of tips meant to be torn out of the magazine. At staff meetings, she earned Wintour&#x27;s respect as the only person who publicly challenged her.

The two began to disagree about the magazine&#x27;s direction. Betts felt &quot;Vogue&quot; fashion coverage was getting too limited. Wintour in turn thought that the stories with popular culture angles Betts was assigning were beneath readers, and began pairing Betts with Plum Sykes, whom Betts reportedly detested as a &quot;pretentious airhead&quot;. Eventually, she left, complaining to &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Wintour had not even sent her a baby gift. Wintour wrote an editor&#x27;s letter that complimented Betts and wished her well.

===2000s===
Betts was one of several longtime editors to leave &quot;Vogue&quot; around the new millennium. A year later, Sykes, another putative successor, left to concentrate on her best-selling novels set in the city&#x27;s upper classes and a screenplay. A number of other editors also left to assume the top jobs at other publications. While some of their replacements did not last, a new group of core editors formed.

The September 2004 issue was 832 pages, the largest issue of a monthly magazine ever published at that time, since exceeded by the September 2007 issue Cutler&#x27;s documentary covered. Wintour oversaw the introduction of three spinoffs: &quot;Teen Vogue&quot;, &quot;Vogue Living&quot; and &quot;Men&#x27;s Vogue.&quot; &quot;Teen Vogue&quot; has published more ad pages and earned more advertiser revenue than either &quot;Elle Girl&quot; and &quot;Cosmo Girl&quot;, and the 164 ad pages in the début issue of &quot;Men&#x27;s Vogue&quot; were the most for a first issue in Condé Nast history. &quot;AdAge&quot; named her &quot;Editor of the Year&quot; for this brand expansion.

Wintour was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours. However, 2008 was generally difficult year for &quot;Vogue&quot;, as a result of the Great Recession. The April issue&#x27;s cover image of LeBron James and Gisele Bündchen brought criticism for its evocation of racial stereotypes. The next month, a lavish Karl Lagerfeld gown she wore to the Met&#x27;s Costume Institute Gala was called &quot;the worst fashion &quot;faux pas&quot; of 2008&quot;. In the fall, &quot;Vogue Living&quot; was suspended indefinitely, and &quot;Men&#x27;s Vogue&quot; cut back to two issues a year as an outsert or supplement to the women&#x27;s magazine. At the end of the year, December&#x27;s cover highlighted a disparaging comment Jennifer Aniston made about Angelina Jolie, to the former&#x27;s displeasure; media observers began speculating that Wintour had lost her touch.

In 2008, rumours arose that she would retire, and be replaced by French &quot;Vogue&quot; editor Carine Roitfeld. An editor at Russian &quot;GQ&quot; reportedly introduced Russian &quot;Vogue&quot; editor Aliona Doletskaya as the next editor of American &quot;Vogue&quot;. Condé Nast responded by taking out a two-page ad in &quot;The New York Times&quot; defending Wintour&#x27;s record. In that same publication, Cathy Horyn later wrote that while Wintour had not lost her touch, the magazine had become &quot;stale and predictable&quot;, as a reader had recently complained. &quot;To read &quot;Vogue&quot; in recent years is to wonder about the peculiar fascination for the &#x27;villa in Tuscany&#x27; story&quot;, Horyn added. The magazine also dealt awkwardly with the recession, she commented.

In 2009, Wintour began making more media appearances. On a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; profile, she said she would not retire. &quot;To me, this is a really interesting time to be in this position and I think it would be in a way irresponsible not to put my best foot forward and lead us into a different time.&quot; A documentary film, &quot;The September Issue&quot;, by &quot;The War Room&quot; producer R.J. Cutler, about the production of the September 2007 issue, was released in September. It focused on the sometimes-difficult relationship between Wintour and creative director Grace Coddington. Wintour appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; to promote it, defending the relevance of fashion in a tough economy. The American Society of Magazine Editors elected her to its Hall of Fame in 2010.

===2010s===

In 2013, Condé Nast announced she would be taking on the position of artistic director for the company&#x27;s magazines while remaining at &quot;Vogue&quot;. She assumed some of the responsibilities of Si Newhouse, the company&#x27;s longtime chairman, who, in his mid-80s at the time, was retreating from his role at Condé Nast to oversee managing Advance Publications, its parent company. A company spokesman told &quot;The New York Times&quot; the position was created to keep Wintour. She described it as &quot;an extension of what I am doing, but on a broader scale.&quot;

In January 2014, the Metropolitan Museum of Art named its Costume Institute complex after Wintour; First Lady Michelle Obama opened it in May of that year. Wintour starred in &quot;The Fashion Fund&quot;, which aired on Ovation TV that year as well; she was named the 39th most powerful woman in the world by &quot;Forbes&quot;.

On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; release, in 2016, &quot;The Ringer&quot; noted how Wintour&#x27;s personal image had evolved since that film&#x27;s depiction of Miranda Priestley. &quot;A decade ago this summer, Wintour became a living, breathing avatar for a certain kind of boss—the terrible kind, with &#x27;great&#x27; a halfhearted asterisk&quot;, wrote Alison Herman. &quot;&quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; transformed Wintour&#x27;s image from that of a mere public figure into that of a cultural icon.&quot;

But since then, &quot;Wintour isn&#x27;t just redeemed. She&#x27;s openly admired, Arctic chill and all.&quot; The grievances reflected in the novel and film &quot;[seem] like an increasingly petty complaint when held up against a readership that remains well into the seven figures and the undisputed edge in ad sales that comes with it. Wintour is seemingly the only person on earth who knows how to run a steady print operation in 2016 ... At 10 years old, Miranda Priestley is iconic but ever-so-slightly out of date. Anna Wintour is still the boss...&quot;

Wintour was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to fashion and journalism and invested by Queen Elizabeth II in May 2017 at Buckingham Palace. According to a January 2017 report in &quot;The Nation&quot;, an American news magazine, it was rumored that Wintour would have become the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom had Hillary Clinton been elected President of the United States the previous November.

===2020s===
In May 2020, former editor-at-large André Leon Talley released his second memoir, &quot;The Chiffon Trenches&quot;, which exposed Talley and Wintour&#x27;s personal falling-out in 2018 after he was discontinued as &quot;Vogue&quot;″s Met Gala red carpet reporter.

Following the murder of George Floyd, Wintour was reported to have issued an apology to staff for &quot;Vogue&quot;″s complicity in racism, stating the magazine had &quot;not found enough ways to elevate and give space to Black editors, writers, photographers, designers and other creators&quot;.

In 2020, Condé Nast promoted Wintour to the role of worldwide chief content officer, as part of a company restructuring. In addition, she will be working as global editorial director of &quot;Vogue&quot;.

In 2023, Wintour suggested the creation of an event similar to the Met Gala in London to raise funds for the local arts scene, which has struggled to recover in the aftermath of COVID.

Wintour was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2023 Birthday Honours for services to fashion.

In 2025, Dame Anna Wintour was awarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

===Influence in fashion industry===
Through the years, she has come to be regarded as one of the most powerful people in fashion, setting trends and anointing new designers. Industry publicists often hear &quot;Do you want me to go to Anna with this?&quot; when they have differences with her subordinates. &quot;The Guardian&quot; has called her the &quot;unofficial mayoress&quot; of New York City. She has encouraged fashion houses such as Christian Dior to hire younger, fresher designers such as John Galliano. Her influence extends outside fashion. She persuaded Donald Trump to let Marc Jacobs use a ballroom at the Plaza Hotel for a show when Jacobs and his partner were short of cash. In 2006, she persuaded Brooks Brothers to hire the relatively unknown Thom Browne. A protégée at &quot;Vogue&quot;, Plum Sykes, became a successful novelist, drawing her settings from New York&#x27;s fashionable élite.

Her salary was reported to be $2 million a year in 2005. In addition, she receives several perks, such as a chauffeured Mercedes-Benz S-Class (both in New York and abroad), a $200,000 shopping allowance, and the Coco Chanel Suite at the Hotel Ritz Paris while attending European fashion shows. Condé Nast president Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr. had the company make her an interest-free $1.6 million loan to purchase her townhouse in Greenwich Village.

==Charity work==
Wintour serves as a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where she has organised benefits that have raised $50 million for the museum&#x27;s Costume Institute. She began the CFDA/Vogue Fund in order to encourage, support and mentor unknown fashion designers. She has also raised over $10 million for AIDS charities since 1990, by organising various high-profile benefits.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
Wintour began dating well-connected older men during her teens. She was briefly involved with novelist Piers Paul Read when she was 15 and he was 24. In her later teens, she dated gossip columnist Nigel Dempster and the two became a fixture on the London club circuit.

Wintour married child psychiatrist David Shaffer in 1984, and they had a son named Charles (born 1985) and a daughter named Katherine (born 1987) before divorcing in 1999. Charles is a graduate of the University of Oxford and Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons. Katherine wrote occasional columns for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2006 and graduated from Columbia University in 2009, and is a New York-based producer with Ambassador Theatre Group. Katherine married Italian filmmaker Francesco Carrozzini, son of &quot;Vogue Italia&quot; editor-in-chief Franca Sozzani, in 2018.

Newspapers and gossip columnists claimed that Wintour&#x27;s affair with investor Shelby Bryan ended her marriage to Shaffer. She declined to comment. A former colleague quoted in the &quot;Observer&quot; said that Bryan &quot;mellowed her&quot; and that she &quot;smiles now and has been seen to laugh&quot;.

===Residence===
Wintour resides in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village.

===Habits===
Wintour says she wakes up at 5:30 a.m., plays tennis, gets her hair and makeup done, and then arrives at the &quot;Vogue&quot; offices at 7:30 a.m. She always turns up at fashion shows well before their scheduled start, stating, &quot;I use the waiting time to make phone calls and notes; I get some of my best ideas at the shows.&quot; According to the BBC documentary series &quot;Boss Woman&quot;, she rarely stays at parties for more than 20 minutes at a time and usually goes to bed by 10:15 p.m. at the latest. She turns off her mobile phone so as not to be disturbed while eating her lunch, which is most often a steak or a hamburger without the bun. High-protein meals have been a habit of hers for a long time. A co-worker at &quot;Harpers &amp; Queen&quot; said that she would eat &quot;smoked salmon and scrambled eggs&quot; every single day and that &quot;she would eat nothing else&quot;.

===Personal fashion===
Because of her position, Wintour&#x27;s wardrobe is often closely scrutinised and imitated. Earlier in her career, she mixed fashionable t-shirts and vests with designer jeans. When she started at &quot;Vogue&quot; as creative director, she switched to Chanel suits with miniskirts. She continued to wear them during both pregnancies, opening the skirts slightly in back and keeping her jacket on to cover up. Wintour was listed as &quot;one of the 50 best-dressed over 50s&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in March 2013. Aside from sporting Chanel suits with midiskirts, she has also been seen wearing kitten heels &amp; printed midi-dresses.

According to biographer Jerry Oppenheimer, her ubiquitous sunglasses are actually corrective lenses, since she has deteriorating vision as her father did. A former colleague he interviewed recalls trying on her Wayfarers in her absence and getting dizzy. &quot;I think at this point they&#x27;ve become, you know, really armour&quot;, Wintour herself told &quot;60 Minutes&quot; correspondent Morley Safer, explaining that they allow her to keep her reactions to a show private. As she rebounded from the end of her marriage and the turnover in the magazine&#x27;s editorial staff, a fellow editor and friend noted that &quot;she&#x27;s not hiding behind her glasses anymore. Now she&#x27;s having fun again.&quot;

===Politics===
Wintour has supported the Democratic Party since Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2000 Senate run and John Kerry&#x27;s 2004 presidential campaign. She also served as a &quot;bundler&quot; of contributions during Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012. She co-hosted fundraisers for Obama&#x27;s campaigns with Sarah Jessica Parker, with one being a 50-person, $40,000-per-person dinner at Parker&#x27;s West Village town house with Meryl Streep, Michael Kors, and advertising executive Trey Laird among the attendees. She also teamed with Calvin Klein and Harvey Weinstein on fundraisers during Obama&#x27;s first term, with Donna Karan among the attendees.

In 2013, when &quot;Vogue&quot;″s former director of communications stepped down, Wintour was rumoured to be looking to hire someone with a political background. Soon after, she hired Hildy Kuryk, who worked as a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee and Obama&#x27;s 2008 campaign. She supported Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign, forming part of Clinton&#x27;s long list of wealthy donors and served as Clinton&#x27;s consultant on wardrobe choices for key moments of the campaign. Wintour endorsed Joe Biden for the 2020 United States presidential election.

==&quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;==

Lauren Weisberger, a former Wintour assistant who left &quot;Vogue&quot; for &quot;Departures&quot; along with Richard Story, wrote &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; after a writing workshop he suggested she take. It was eagerly anticipated for its supposed insider portrait of Wintour prior to its publication. Wintour told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I always enjoy a great piece of fiction. I haven&#x27;t decided whether I am going to read it or not.&quot; While it has been suggested that the fashion magazine setting and Miranda Priestly character were based on &quot;Vogue&quot; and Wintour, Weisberger claims she drew not only from her own experiences but those of her friends as well. Wintour herself makes a cameo appearance near the end of the book, where it is said she and Miranda dislike each other.

In the novel, Priestly has many similarities to Wintour—among them, she is British, has two children, and is described as a major contributor to the Met. Priestly is a tyrant who makes impossible demands of her subordinates, gives them almost none of the information or time necessary to comply and then berates them for their failures to do so.

Kate Betts, who had been fired by Harper&#x27;s after two years during which staffers said she tried too hard to emulate Wintour, reviewed it harshly in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;:
Priestly has some positive qualities. Andrea Sachs, the novel&#x27;s main character, notes that she makes all the magazine&#x27;s key editorial decisions by herself and that she has genuine class and style.

===Film adaptation===

During the production of &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; in 2005, Wintour was reportedly threatening prominent fashion personalities, particularly designers, that &quot;Vogue&quot; would not cover them if they made cameo appearances in the film as themselves. She denied it through a spokesperson who said she was interested in anything that &quot;supports fashion&quot;. Many designers are mentioned in the film. Only one, Valentino Garavani, appeared as himself.

The film was released, in mid-2006, to great commercial success. Wintour attended the première wearing Prada. In the film, actress Meryl Streep plays Priestly different enough from the book to receive critical praise as an entirely original (and more sympathetic) character. (Streep&#x27;s office in the film was similar enough to Wintour&#x27;s that Wintour reportedly had hers redecorated.)

Wintour reportedly said the film would probably go straight-to-DVD. It made over $300 million in worldwide box-office receipts. Later in 2006, in an interview with Barbara Walters that aired the day of the DVD&#x27;s release, Wintour said she found the film &quot;really entertaining&quot; and praised it for making fashion &quot;entertaining and glamorous and interesting ... I was 100 percent behind it.&quot;

That opinion of the film has not yet led her to forgive Weisberger. When it was reported that the novelist&#x27;s editor told her to start her third novel over, Wintour&#x27;s spokesman suggested she &quot;should get a job as someone else&#x27;s assistant.&quot;

Oppenheimer suggests &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; may have done Wintour a favour by increasing her name recognition. &quot;Besides giving Weisberger her fifteen minutes&quot;, he says, &quot;[it] ... place[d] Anna squarely in the mainstream celebrity pantheon. [She] was now known and talked about over Big Macs and french fries under the Golden Arches by young fashionistas in Wal-Mart denim in Davenport and Dubuque.&quot;

When &quot;The September Issue&quot; was released three years later, critics compared it with the earlier, fictional film. &quot;For the past year or so, she&#x27;s been on the media warpath to win back her image&quot;, said Paul Schrodt in &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;. Many considered the question of how similar she was to Streep&#x27;s Priestly, and praised the film for showing the real person. Manohla Dargis at &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that Priestly had helped humanise Wintour, and &quot;the documentary continues this&quot;. &quot;The movie offers insights that lift it beyond a realist version of &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;&quot;, agreed Mary Pols in &quot;Time&quot;.

The film version of the Weisberger novel (screenplay penned by Aline Brosh McKenna) has not been the only film to have a character borrowing some aspects of Wintour. Edna Mode&#x27;s similar hairstyle in &quot;The Incredibles&quot; (2004) has been noted, Johnny Depp said he partially based the demeanour of Willy Wonka in &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; (2005) on Wintour. Fey Sommers in &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; (2006–2010) was also likened to Wintour, from the trademark bob and sunglasses, to Wintour&#x27;s last name homophonous with &#x27;Winter&#x27;, while Sommers&#x27; is homophonous with &#x27;Summer&#x27;.

==Criticism==
In 2005, two years after &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;, Oppenheimer&#x27;s &quot;Front Row: The Cool Life and Hot Times of Vogue&#x27;s Editor in Chief&quot; was published. It painted a similar portrait of the real woman. According to Oppenheimer, Wintour not only declined his requests for an interview but discouraged others from talking to him.

===Personality===
Wintour is often described as emotionally distant by those who have come to know her well, even her close friends. &quot;At some stage in her career, Anna Wintour stopped being Anna Wintour and became &#x27;Anna Wintour,&#x27; at which point, like wings of a stately home, she closed off large sections of her personality to the public&quot;, wrote &quot;The Guardian&quot;. &quot;I think she enjoys not being completely approachable. Just her office is very intimidating. You have to walk about a mile into the office before you get to her desk and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s intentional&quot;, Coddington says. &quot;I don&#x27;t find her to be accessible to people she doesn&#x27;t need to be accessible to&quot;, agrees &quot;Vogue&quot; publisher Tom Florio.

She has said she admired her father Charles, known as &quot;Chilly Charlie&quot; for being &quot;inscrutable&quot;. Former coworkers told Oppenheimer of a similar aloofness on her part. But she is also known for volatile outbursts of displeasure, and the widely used &quot;Nuclear Wintour&quot; sobriquet is a result of both. She dislikes it enough to have asked &quot;The New York Times&quot; not to use it. &quot;There are times I get quite angry&quot;, she admitted in &quot;The September Issue&quot;.

&quot;I think she has been very rude to a lot of people in the past, on her way up – very terse&quot;, a friend told &quot;The Observer&quot;. &quot;She doesn&#x27;t do small talk. She is never going to be friends with her assistant.&quot; Junior staff at &quot;Vogue&quot; are said to understand, through unwritten rules, that they should not initiate interactions with her; it has been said that they are discouraged from riding an elevator with her, and if they do, should not speak to her, though Wintour has called this an exaggeration. In a 1999 profile, journalist Kevin Gray observed that one staffer appeared &quot;panic stricken&quot; when she realised she would have to be in the elevator with Wintour. Gray also reports that another employee told him that she once saw Wintour trip in a hallway, walked past her without offering assistance, and was later told she &quot;did the right thing.&quot;

Even friends admit to some trepidation in her presence. &quot;Anna happens to be a friend of mine&quot;, says Barbara Amiel, &quot;a fact which is of absolutely no help in coping with the cold panic that grips me whenever we meet.&quot; &quot;I know when to stop pushing her&quot;, says Coddington. &quot;She doesn&#x27;t know when to stop pushing me.&quot;

She has often been described as a perfectionist who routinely makes impossible, arbitrary demands of subordinates: &quot;kitchen scissors at work&quot;, in the words of one commentator. She once made a junior staffer look through a photographer&#x27;s trash to find a picture he had refused to give her. In a deleted scene from &quot;The September Issue&quot;, she complains about the &quot;horrible white plastic buckets&quot; of ice behind the bars at the CFDA&#x27;s 7th on Sale AIDS benefit and moves them out of sight. &quot;The notion that Anna would want something done &#x27;now&#x27; and not &#x27;shortly&#x27; is accurate&quot;, Amiel says of &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;. &quot;Anna wants what she wants right away.&quot; A longtime assistant says, &quot;She throws you in the water and you&#x27;ll either sink or swim.&quot;

Peter Braunstein, a former &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; media reporter convicted of sexually assaulting a coworker, allegedly planned to kill Wintour because of perceived slights. After receiving only one ticket to the 2002 &quot;Vogue&quot; Fashion Awards, which he perceived as a snub, his anger cost him his job. 

On one occasion she had to pay for her treatment of employees. In 2004, a court ruled that she and Shaffer were to pay $104,403, and Wintour herself an additional $32,639, to settle a lawsuit brought against them by the New York State Workers&#x27; Compensation Board. They had failed to pay the $140,000 judgement against them by a former employee of theirs (not the magazine) injured on the job, who did not have the necessary insurance coverage.

In the 2000s, her relationship with Bryan was credited with softening her personality at work. &quot;Even when she&#x27;s in a bad mood, she has a different posture [...] is that she&#x27;s so much more mellow and easier to work for&quot;, someone described as a &quot;Wintour watcher&quot; told &quot;The New York Observer&quot; in 2000.

===Pro-fur stance===
She has often been the target of animal rights organisations like PETA, who are angered by her use of fur in &quot;Vogue&quot;, her pro-fur editorials and her refusal to run paid advertisements from animal rights organisations. Undeterred, she continues to use fur in photo spreads, saying there is always a way to wear it. &quot;Nobody was wearing fur until she put it on the cover in the early 1990s&quot;, says &quot;Vogue&quot; co-worker Tom Florio. &quot;She ignited the entire industry.&quot;

She has &quot;lost count&quot; of the times she has been physically attacked by activists. In Paris in October 2005, she was hit with a tofu pie while waiting to get into the Chloé show. On another occasion, an activist dumped a dead raccoon on her plate at a restaurant; she told the waiter to remove it. She and &quot;Vogue&quot; publisher Ron Galotti once retaliated for a protest outside the Condé Nast offices during the company&#x27;s annual Christmas party by sending down a plate of roast beef.

Others outside of the animal rights community have raised the fur issue. Fashion journalist Peter Braunstein wrote in his manifesto that she would go to a hell guarded by large rats, where it would be so warm she would not need to wear fur. Pamela Anderson, in an early 2008 interview, said Wintour was the living person she most despised &quot;because she bullies young designers and models to use and wear fur.&quot;

===Elitism===
Another common criticism of Wintour&#x27;s editorship focuses on &quot;Vogue&quot; increasing use of celebrities on the cover, and her insistence on making them meet her standards. She reportedly told Oprah Winfrey to lose weight before her cover photograph. Likewise, Hillary Clinton was told not to wear a blue suit. At the 2005 Anglomania celebration, a &quot;Vogue&quot;-sponsored salute to British fashion at the Met, Wintour is said to have personally chosen the clothes for prominent attendees such as Jennifer Lopez, Kate Moss, Donald Trump, and Diane von Fürstenberg. &quot;I don&#x27;t think Vreeland had that kind of concentration&quot;, says &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; publisher Patrick McCarthy. &quot;She wouldn&#x27;t have dressed Babe Paley. Nor would Babe Paley have let her.&quot; By persuading designers to lend clothes to prominent socialites and celebrities, who are then photographed wearing the clothes not only in &quot;Vogue&quot; but more general-interest magazines like &quot;People&quot; and &quot;Us&quot;, which in turn influence what buyers want, some in the industry believe Wintour is exerting too much control over it, especially since she is not involved in making or producing clothes herself. &quot;The end result is that Anna can control it all the way to the selling floor&quot;, says Candy Pratts Price, executive fashion director at Style.com. She has been credited with killing grunge fashion in the early 1990s, when it was not selling well, by telling designers if they continued to avoid glamour their looks would not be photographed for &quot;Vogue&quot;. All complied.

Another &quot;Vogue&quot; writer has complained Wintour excluded ordinary working women, many of whom are regular subscribers, from the pages. &quot;She&#x27;s obsessed only about reflecting the aspirations of a certain class of reader&quot;, she says. &quot;We once had a piece about breast cancer which started with an airline stewardess, but she wouldn&#x27;t have a stewardess in the magazine so we had to go and look for a high-flying businesswoman who&#x27;d had cancer.&quot;

Wintour has been accused of setting herself apart even from peers. &quot;I do not think fiction could surpass the reality&quot;, a British fashion magazine editor says of &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;. &quot;[A]rt in this instance is only a poor imitation of life.&quot; Wintour, the editor says, routinely requests to be seated out of sight of competing editors at shows. &quot;We spend our working lives telling people which it-bag to carry but Anna is so above the rest of us she does not even have a handbag.&quot;

At Milan Fashion Week in 2008, she requested that some key shows be rescheduled for earlier in the week so she and other U.S.-based editors could have time to return home before the Paris shows. This led to complaints. Other editors said they had to rush through the earlier shows, and lesser-known designers who had to show later were denied an important audience. Dolce &amp; Gabbana said Italian fashion was getting short shrift and Milan was becoming a &quot;circus without sense&quot;.

Giorgio Armani, who at the time was co-chairing a Met exhibition on superheroes&#x27; costumes with Wintour, drew some attention for his personal remarks. &quot;Maybe what she thinks is a beautiful dress, I wouldn&#x27;t think was a beautiful dress&quot;, he said. While he claimed he could not understand why people disliked her, saying he himself was indifferent, he expressed hope she had not made a comment once attributed to her that &quot;the Armani era is over&quot;. He accused her of preferring French and American fashion over Italian. Geoffrey Beene, who stopped inviting Wintour to shows after she stopped writing about him, called her &quot;a boss lady in four-wheel drive who ignores or abandons those who do not fuel her tank. As an editor, she has turned class into mass, taste into waste.&quot;

Her remarks about obesity have caused controversy on more than one occasion. In 2005, Wintour was heavily criticised by the New York chapter of the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance after &quot;Vogue&quot; editor-at-large André Leon Talley said on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, at one point, Wintour demanded he lose weight. &quot;Most of the &quot;Vogue&quot; girls are so thin, tremendously thin&quot;, he said, &quot;because Miss Anna don&#x27;t like fat people.&quot; In 2009, residents of Minneapolis took umbrage after she told &quot;60 Minutes&quot; she could &quot;only kindly describe most of the people I saw as little houses.&quot; They noted their city had been named the third fittest in the nation that year by &quot;Men&#x27;s Fitness&quot; while New York had been named the fifth fattest.

Wintour surprised observers when developing an association with the Kardashian family and Kanye West, which culminated in having the Kardashian-Wests on a &quot;Vogue cover&quot;; Wintour reportedly commented that having only &quot;deeply tasteful&quot; people in the magazine was &quot;boring&quot;, and her decision to resort to such personalities has led some to accuse the magazine of being &quot;desperate for buzz&quot;. Wintour has nevertheless continued the association with the pair.

===Responses===
Others have defended Wintour. Amanda Fortini at &quot;Slate&quot; said she was comfortable with Wintour&#x27;s elitism since that was intrinsic to fashion:

Emma Brockes sees this in Wintour herself: &quot;[Her] unwavering ability to look as if she lives within the pages of her magazine has a sort of honesty to it, proof that, whatever one thinks about it, the lifestyle peddled by Vogue is at least physically possible.&quot;

&quot;Print publications have to be as luxurious an experience as possible&quot;, Wintour explained in 2015. &quot;You have to feel it coming off the page. You have to see photographs and pieces that you couldn&#x27;t possibly see anywhere else.&quot;

Some friends see her purported coldness as just traditional British reserve, or shyness. Brockes says it may be mutual, &quot;partly a reflection of how awkward people are with her, particularly women, who get preemptively chippy when faced with the prospect of meeting Fashion Incarnate.&quot; When Morley Safer asked her about complaints about her personality, she said,

She has made similar statements in defence of her reported refusal to hire fat people. &quot;It&#x27;s important to me that the people that are working here, particularly in the fashion department&quot;, she says, &quot;will present themselves in a way that makes sense to the outside world that they work at &quot;Vogue&quot;.&quot;

Her defenders have called criticism sexist. &quot;Powerful women in the media always get inspected more thoroughly than their male counterparts&quot;, said &quot;The New York Times&quot; in a piece about Wintour shortly after &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; release. When Wintour took over at &quot;Vogue&quot;, gossip columnist Liz Smith reported rumours she had gotten the job through an affair with Si Newhouse. A reportedly furious Wintour made her anger the subject of one of her first staff meetings; she still complained about the allegation when accepting a media award in 2002.

She has been called a feminist whose changes to &quot;Vogue&quot; have reflected, acknowledged, and reinforced advances in the status of women. Reviewing Oppenheimer&#x27;s book in the &quot;Washington Monthly&quot;, managing editor Christina Larson notes that &quot;Vogue&quot;, unlike many other women&#x27;s magazines,
Wintour, unlike Vreeland, &quot;...shifted &quot;Vogue&quot;″s focus from the cult of beauty to the cult of the creation of beauty.&quot; To Wintour, the focus on celebrities is a welcome development as it means women are making the cover of &quot;Vogue&quot; at least in part for what they have accomplished, not just how they look.

Complaints about her role as fashion &quot;éminence grise&quot; are dismissed by those familiar with how she actually exercises it. &quot;She&#x27;s honest. She tells you what she thinks. Yes is yes and no is no&quot;, according to designer Karl Lagerfeld. &quot;She&#x27;s not too pushy&quot;, agrees François-Henri Pinault, chief executive officer of Kering, Gucci&#x27;s parent company. &quot;She lets you know it&#x27;s not a problem if you can&#x27;t do something she wants.&quot; Defenders also point out she continued supporting Gucci despite her strong belief Kering should not have let Tom Ford go. Designers such as Alice Roi and Isabel Toledo have flourished without indulging Wintour or &quot;Vogue&quot;. Her willingness to throw her weight around has helped keep &quot;Vogue&quot; independent despite its heavy reliance on advertising dollars. Wintour was the only fashion editor who refused to follow an Armani ultimatum to feature more of its clothes in the magazine&#x27;s editorial pages, although she has also admitted if she has to choose between two dresses, one by an advertiser and the other not, she will choose the former every time. &quot;Commercial is not a dirty word to me.&quot;

Wintour herself, when asked about it, dismisses the notion that she has all the power attributed to her. &quot;I don&#x27;t think of myself as a powerful person&quot;, she told &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2011, when it named her 69th on its list of the world&#x27;s hundred most powerful women. &quot;You know, what does it mean? It means you get a better seat in a restaurant or tickets to a screening or whatever it may be. But it is a wonderful opportunity to be able to help others, and for that I&#x27;m extremely grateful.&quot;

In response to criticisms like Beene&#x27;s, she has defended the democratisation of what were once exclusive luxury brands. &quot;It means more people are going to get better fashion&quot;, she told Dana Thomas. &quot;And the more people who can have fashion, the better.&quot;

<doc id="730580" wikidata="Q7885397" url="?curid=730580" title="Union Bank of Halifax">
<text>The Union Bank of Halifax was granted a charter by the government of Canada in 1856 and established its head office at the corner of Hollis and Prince Streets in the port city of Halifax, Nova Scotia.

The driving force behind the bank, and its first chairman, was Halifax businessman and former mayor, William Machin Stairs (1789–1865). Amongst the Bank&#x27;s other founders was John William Ritchie who served as director until 1866. In the nine years he was in charge, William Machin Stairs began an expansion of the bank that his successors continued. The Union Bank developed a strong regional branch network as well as offices in Trinidad and Puerto Rico that served the bank&#x27;s clients with shipping and trading interests throughout the Caribbean. His son, William James Stairs served as president of the Bank from 1883 to 1898.

By the turn of the century, Montreal, and to a lesser degree Toronto, were becoming the financial centres for all of Canada. The Union Bank&#x27;s executive at the time failed to recognize the need for expansion into the growing national market. Within a few years, increased competition from much larger financial institutions meant a merger with another bank was essential for survival. Therefore, in 1910, the board of directors of the Union Bank of Halifax accepted a takeover offer from the Royal Bank of Canada, then the country&#x27;s third-largest bank.

The bank was known for the quality and fraternity of its employees. The noted financier Izaak Walton Killam began his business career in his hometown of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia as a junior clerk at the local branch of the Union Bank of Halifax.

<doc id="730585" wikidata="Q3302775" url="?curid=730585" title="Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation">
<text>The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation that provides necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality of a control with respect to a loss function. Its solution is the value function of the optimal control problem which, once known, can be used to obtain the optimal control by taking the maximizer (or minimizer) of the Hamiltonian involved in the HJB equation.

The equation is a result of the theory of dynamic programming which was pioneered in the 1950s by Richard Bellman and coworkers. The connection to the Hamilton–Jacobi equation from classical physics was first drawn by Rudolf Kálmán. In discrete-time problems, the analogous difference equation is usually referred to as the Bellman equation.

While classical variational problems, such as the brachistochrone problem, can be solved using the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, the method can be applied to a broader spectrum of problems. Further it can be generalized to stochastic systems, in which case the HJB equation is a second-order elliptic partial differential equation. A major drawback, however, is that the HJB equation admits classical solutions only for a sufficiently smooth value function, which is not guaranteed in most situations. Instead, the notion of a viscosity solution is required, in which conventional derivatives are replaced by (set-valued) subderivatives.

==Optimal Control Problems==

Consider the following problem in deterministic optimal control over the time period formula_1:

:formula_2

where formula_3 is the scalar cost rate function and formula_4 is a function that gives the bequest value at the final state, formula_5 is the system state vector, formula_6 is assumed given, and formula_7 for formula_8 is the control vector that we are trying to find. Thus, formula_9 is the value function.

The system must also be subject to

:formula_10

where formula_11 gives the vector determining physical evolution of the state vector over time.

==The Partial Differential Equation==

For this simple system, the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman partial differential equation is

:formula_12

subject to the terminal condition

:formula_13

As before, the unknown scalar function formula_9 in the above partial differential equation is the Bellman value function, which represents the cost incurred from starting in state formula_15 at time formula_16 and controlling the system optimally from then until time formula_17.

==Deriving the Equation==

Intuitively, the HJB equation can be derived as follows. If formula_18 is the optimal cost-to-go function (also called the &#x27;value function&#x27;), then by Richard Bellman&#x27;s principle of optimality, going from time &quot;t&quot; to &quot;t&quot; + &quot;dt&quot;, we have

:formula_19

Note that the Taylor expansion of the first term on the right-hand side is

:formula_20

where formula_21 denotes the terms in the Taylor expansion of higher order than one in little-&quot;o&quot; notation. Then if we subtract formula_18 from both sides, divide by &quot;dt&quot;, and take the limit as &quot;dt&quot; approaches zero, we obtain the HJB equation defined above.

==Solving the Equation==

The HJB equation is usually solved backwards in time, starting from formula_23 and ending at formula_24.

When solved over the whole of state space and formula_25 is continuously differentiable, the HJB equation is a necessary and sufficient condition for an optimum when the terminal state is unconstrained. If we can solve for formula_26 then we can find from it a control formula_27 that achieves the minimum cost.

In general case, the HJB equation does not have a classical (smooth) solution. Several notions of generalized solutions have been developed to cover such situations, including viscosity solution (Pierre-Louis Lions and Michael Crandall), minimax solution (), and others.

Approximate dynamic programming has been introduced by D. P. Bertsekas and J. N. Tsitsiklis with the use of artificial neural networks (multilayer perceptrons) for approximating the Bellman function in general. This is an effective mitigation strategy for reducing the impact of dimensionality by replacing the memorization of the complete function mapping for the whole space domain with the memorization of the sole neural network parameters. In particular, for continuous-time systems, an approximate dynamic programming approach that combines both policy iterations with neural networks was introduced. In discrete-time, an approach to solve the HJB equation combining value iterations and neural networks was introduced.

Alternatively, it has been shown that sum-of-squares optimization can yield an approximate polynomial solution to the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation arbitrarily well with respect to the formula_28 norm.

==Extension to Stochastic Problems==
The idea of solving a control problem by applying Bellman&#x27;s principle of optimality and then working out backwards in time an optimizing strategy can be generalized to stochastic control problems. Consider similar as above

:formula_29

now with formula_30 the stochastic process to optimize and formula_31 the steering. By first using Bellman and then expanding formula_32 with Itô&#x27;s rule, one finds the stochastic HJB equation

:formula_33

where formula_34 represents the stochastic differentiation operator, and subject to the terminal condition

:formula_35

Note that the randomness has disappeared. In this case a solution formula_36 of the latter does not necessarily solve the primal problem, it is a candidate only and a further verifying argument is required. This technique is widely used in Financial Mathematics to determine optimal investment strategies in the market (see for example Merton&#x27;s portfolio problem).

===Application to LQG-Control===

As an example, we can look at a system with linear stochastic dynamics and quadratic cost. If the system dynamics is given by
:formula_37
and the cost accumulates at rate formula_38, the HJB equation is given by
:formula_39
with optimal action given by
:formula_40
Assuming a quadratic form for the value function, we obtain the usual Riccati equation for the Hessian of the value function as is usual for Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control.

<doc id="730592" wikidata="Q144048" url="?curid=730592" title="Rafael Benítez">
<text>Rafael Benítez Maudes (born 16 April 1960) is a Spanish professional football manager and former player. He was most recently the manager of La Liga club Celta Vigo.

Benítez joined Real Madrid&#x27;s coaching staff at the age of 26, going on to work as the under-19 and reserve team coach, and assistant manager for the senior team. He moved away from Real Madrid in 1995, but management spells at Real Valladolid and Osasuna were short-lived and unsuccessful. He guided Segunda División club Extremadura back to La Liga in his first season in the 1997–98 season, but the team was relegated the following season. He left the club, and coached Tenerife in 2000, winning promotion in his only season.

Benítez was appointed coach of Valencia and won La Liga in the 2001–02 season. In 2004, another La Liga league title and a UEFA Cup victory were added, building on the foundation laid by Héctor Cúper who had taken Valencia to two consecutive Champions League finals: in 2000 against Real Madrid, and in 2001 against Bayern Munich. After leaving Valencia, Benitez moved to English club Liverpool of the Premier League, guiding the club to victory in the UEFA Champions League in 2005. For the second consecutive season, he was named UEFA Manager of the Year. He also won the FA Cup in 2006 and reached the 2007 Champions League final, but was unable to win the Premier League, with Liverpool&#x27;s best league performance under Benítez a second-place finish in 2008–09.

After leaving Liverpool in June 2010, Benítez was appointed manager of treble-winning side Inter Milan. Despite attaining silverware with the Supercoppa Italiana and Club World Cup, his reign at the club was short, and he was dismissed midway through the 2010–11 season. In November 2012, he was appointed interim manager of Chelsea for the remainder of the season, and he went on to win the 2013 Europa League. He returned to Italy in 2013 to coach Napoli, where he won the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana. He then left Napoli and became coach of Real Madrid in June 2015 on an initial three-year contract. It was another short-lived appointment, and on 4 January 2016, he was dismissed following a 2–2 draw against his former club, Valencia.

Benítez was appointed manager of Newcastle United in March 2016, in an attempt to save the club from relegation. He was unable to avoid relegation, but earned promotion back to the Premier League the following year, winning the Championship. He left the club in June 2019, and the following month was appointed manager of Chinese Super League club Dalian Professional. He left the club by mutual consent in January 2021, before taking over as manager at Everton in June. He was dismissed in January 2022, after a run where Everton lost nine out of thirteen games.

==Early career==
Benítez played as a midfielder for both Real Madrid Aficionados in the Tercera División and Real Madrid Castilla in the Segunda División. He also enrolled as a student at INEF, the sports faculty at the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid; in 1982, he obtained a degree in physical education.

In 1979, Benítez was selected to play for the Spain Youth U-19s at the World Student Games in Mexico City, and he scored a penalty in the opening game, a 10–0 win against Cuba. In the next game, a 0–0 draw against Canada, he was injured in a hard tackle. The injury saw him sidelined for a year, and hampered his chances of becoming a major player. In 1981, Benítez joined Tercera División side Parla. Initially, he joined Parla on loan, but eventually signed for them permanently and helped them gain promotion to Segunda División B. He also played a further three games for the Spain Universities XI. In 1985, he signed for Segunda División B club Linares and under Enrique Mateos, he served as a player/coach. Further injury problems saw him miss almost the entire 1985–86 season, and he subsequently retired as a player.

==Managerial career==
===Real Madrid youth coach===
In 1986, at the age of 26, Benítez returned to Real Madrid to join the club&#x27;s coaching staff. At the start of the 1986–87 season, he was appointed coach of Real Madrid Castilla. With this team, he won two league titles in 1987 and 1989. He won a third league title with the Real Madrid youth in 1990. Halfway through the 1990–91 season, he succeeded José Antonio Camacho as the coach of Real Madrid&#x27;s under-19 team. He won the Spain Under 19s Cup in 1991 and 1993, defeating Barcelona in both finals. In 1993, the team completed a double when they also won the national under-19 league. While at Real, Benítez also gained his coaching certificate in 1989 - and in the summer of 1990, taught at a football camp at the University of California in Davis, California.

During the 1992–93 season, Benítez also worked as an assistant coach to Mariano García Remón at Real Madrid B. After his success with the U19s, Benítez then succeeded García Remón at the start of the 1993–94 season. Real Madrid B were then playing in the Segunda División, and on 4 September 1993, he made his debut as a Segunda División manager with a 3–1 over Hércules. In March 1994, he became an assistant to Vicente del Bosque with the senior Real Madrid team, before returning to coach Real Madrid B for the 1994–95 season.

===Early coaching===
The first attempts by Benítez at senior management away from the Real Madrid fold were less than successful. He was appointed manager of Real Valladolid for the 1995–96 season, but was dismissed after only two wins in 23 games, with the club bottom of La Liga. During the 1996–97 season, Benítez took charge at Osasuna in the Segunda División, but after only nine games and one win, he was dismissed. He did, however, meet the fitness instructor Pako Ayestarán at the club, and went on to form a partnership with him at several clubs for the next decade. In 1997, he joined another Segunda División side, Extremadura, and this time led them to promotion, finishing second in the table behind Alavés, after winning 23 out of 42 games. Extremadura only survived one season in La Liga, however, and were relegated in 1999, after finishing 17th and losing a play-off to Rayo Vallecano.

Benítez subsequently resigned at Extremadura, and took a year off from football to study in England and Italy. He also worked as a commentator/analyst for Eurosport, &quot;Marca&quot;, &quot;El Mundo&quot; and local Madrid TV. In 2000, he was appointed manager of Tenerife of the Segunda División, and with a team that included Mista, Curro Torres and Luis García, he gained promotion to La Liga by finishing third in the league behind Sevilla and Real Betis.

===Valencia===
====2001–04: Twice Spanish champions and UEFA Cup winners====
In 2001, Benítez was appointed coach of Valencia, replacing Argentine Héctor Cúper. Cúper had led the club to two consecutive UEFA Champions League finals (both of which they lost), and departed to join Italian side Inter Milan. Valencia had previously approached Javier Irureta, Mané and Luis Aragonés, and had been turned down by all three. However, club director Javier Subirats recognised the potential of Benítez, and campaigned for his appointment. According to Santiago Cañizares, the squad was initially surprised, but they were immediately won over by his modesty as he presented himself as quoted: &quot;You come from the Champions League final and I come from Segunda División, but humbly I think I have tools to make you improve&quot;. Shortly after his signing was announced in June 2001, Valencia president Pedro Cortes claimed that, &quot;we believe he&#x27;s the ideal coach. He&#x27;s a professional who is highly qualified to take charge of the sort of team we want — young, aggressive and with a winning attitude.&quot; Benitez signed a two-year deal, with an annual salary of €450,000. It was well below the €1.2 million Cúper had earnt the previous season.

Valencia fans also were soon won over by Benítez, after he introduced a more attacking style of play than his predecessor. He also brought in both Mista from his former club and Francisco Rufete from Málaga, with Mista going on to become top goalscorer for Valencia, with 19 goals in the 2003–04 season. In 2002, these tactics saw Benítez lead Valencia to their first La Liga title in 31 years, winning it by a seven-point margin over second-placed Deportivo La Coruña.

However, the following season was a disappointing one; the club failed to follow up on their title success, finishing 18 points behind champions Real Madrid, and missed out on the top four by a single point. The season also saw Benítez make his debut in the Champions League, where his side reached the quarter-finals, losing to Inter Milan.

In the 2003–04 season, Valencia won La Liga with three games to spare, and beat Marseille 2–0 in the UEFA Cup final. Despite this success, Benítez fell out with Jesús García Pitarch, the club&#x27;s director of football, over control of new signings, and the club&#x27;s failure to reinforce the squad with the players he wanted. He said: &quot;I was hoping for a sofa [a defender] and they&#x27;ve brought me a lamp [Fabián Canobbio],&quot; in reference to the positions he wanted to be strengthened. These differences of opinion saw Benítez resign as Valencia coach on 1 June 2004.

===Liverpool===
On 16 June 2004, Benítez was appointed manager of Liverpool, replacing Gérard Houllier, becoming the first Spaniard to manage in the Premier League. On his arrival he stated: &quot;It is like a dream to be here. I am very, very proud to be joining one of the most important clubs in the world in one of the best leagues in the world - and I want to win.&quot;

====2004–06: Early successes====
One of Benítez&#x27;s first tasks at Liverpool was to convince club captain Steven Gerrard not to move to Chelsea. He was unable, however, to convince Michael Owen to extend his contract; he was subsequently sold to Real Madrid. Later in the summer transfer window, Benítez signed several players from La Liga, most notably Luis García and Xabi Alonso, both of whom drew immediate admiration from Liverpool supporters. Benítez also gave new life to existing Liverpool players, transforming Jamie Carragher from a utility player to one of Europe&#x27;s top centre backs, alongside Sami Hyypiä.

During his first season, Benítez was unable to improve Liverpool&#x27;s form in the Premier League. Key players missed much of the season through injury, and Liverpool failed to challenge Chelsea and Arsenal for the league title, finishing fifth. Benítez, however, did reach his first English domestic cup final, losing the League Cup final against Chelsea at the Millennium Stadium 3–2 after extra time.
In the Champions League, however, Liverpool fared differently. The club began their campaign with an unimpressive 2–1 aggregate win over Grazer AK in the qualifying rounds, and were minutes away from going out of the competition in the group stages. However, an 87th-minute goal by Steven Gerrard defeated Olympiacos 3–1, and saw the club progress to the last 16 on head-to-head difference. After defeating Bayer Leverkusen and Juventus with the aid of some bold team selections by Benítez, Liverpool faced Chelsea in the semi-final. A controversial early goal in the second leg from Luis García saw Liverpool win 1–0 on aggregate and reach the final against Milan.

In a classic final, dubbed the &quot;Miracle of Istanbul&quot;, Liverpool came from 3–0 down at half time to level the score at 3–3 in the space of just six minutes, eventually triumphing 3–2 on penalties with the assistance of goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek. Benítez&#x27;s calm, methodical approach at half time was said to give the players the belief they could pull off an improbable comeback, and win Liverpool an historic fifth European Cup. In doing so, Benítez became only the third manager in history (after Bob Paisley and José Mourinho) to win the UEFA Cup and UEFA Champions League in successive seasons, and the second Liverpool manager (after Joe Fagan) ever to win the UEFA Champions League/European Cup in his first season in charge. Benítez&#x27;s tactics were credited as a key factor in Liverpool reaching, and winning, the final, despite a relatively unimpressive squad of players. 

Dudek&#x27;s heroics in the final were not enough for him to stay as first-choice keeper, as newly signed Pepe Reina replaced him in from the start of the 2005–06 season. Benítez also quickly discarded Vladimír Šmicer and Igor Bišćan, who played key roles in the European success, but seemingly did not figure in Benítez&#x27;s long-term plans. Benítez also quickly sold Josemi and Antonio Núñez, two of his first signings in English football, after they failed to establish themselves, with the likes of Peter Crouch, Mohamed Sissoko, Daniel Agger, as well as former Liverpool player Robbie Fowler, being brought in to strengthen the side.

Benítez&#x27;s signings helped the club&#x27;s Premier League form improve considerably. Liverpool finished third in the league, missing out on second place by one point. Liverpool also won the FA Cup, beating both Manchester United and Chelsea, as well as a thrilling 5–3 win against Luton Town in the third round, on the way to the final against West Ham United. History repeated itself in the final, as they then went on to lift the trophy after a penalty shoot-out, following a dramatic 3–3 draw. Liverpool came from 2–0 down, and were losing 3–2 in stoppage time, when Steven Gerrard scored a dramatic late equalizer. This time, Pepe Reina saved three penalties during the shoot-out to secure the silverware.

====2006–08 Confrontation with new owners====
Following Benítez&#x27;s great early success, the English media were predicting Liverpool would challenge Chelsea for the 2006–07 Premier League title after Benítez addressed Liverpool&#x27;s perceived weaknesses in the transfer window, a belief reaffirmed after his side won the Community Shield with a 2–1 victory over Chelsea. The title challenge, however, fizzled out early in the season, with Liverpool&#x27;s poor form away from Anfield leading to speculation Benítez&#x27;s tenure at Liverpool was short-lived, with his agent quoted as saying Benítez would consider offers to manage in Italy. Benítez swiftly issued a statement through the club&#x27;s website, re-affirming his desire to remain with Liverpool for the long-term.

Supporters and manager joined to welcome new owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks, with the hope the new owners would bring funding for new players and a new stadium. Gillett declared himself delighted with the manager of his new investment, as Benítez overcame his domestic difficulties to lead Liverpool to another Champions League final. After Liverpool again defeated Chelsea in the semi-final, this time on penalties, Gillett stated, &quot;Rafa has been tremendous ... We knew of him but I don&#x27;t think we realized how good he was, and not just as a coach. Not only was he a brilliant coach but he is a very sharp, savvy businessman. He knows what he wants and how to get it. The more we have seen of him the more impressed we have become.&quot; Benítez did not reciprocate his owner&#x27;s kind words, demanding that his club&#x27;s new owners back him in the transfer market in order for Liverpool to progress following his side&#x27;s 2–1 loss to Milan in the final. It was reported Benítez did not feel he had the complete support of the new owners, a thought that was compounded by Liverpool&#x27;s initial lack of activity in the transfer window, although the club played these rumours down.

Benítez&#x27;s spending was, eventually, significant, breaking Liverpool&#x27;s transfer record when signing Spanish striker Fernando Torres from Atlético Madrid, as well as signing Ryan Babel, Yossi Benayoun, Lucas Leiva and Andriy Voronin. Among those Benítez sold was Craig Bellamy, who was notably phased out of the first team, following an altercation with John Arne Riise in the buildup to Liverpool&#x27;s remarkable victory over Barcelona in the Camp Nou en route to the Champions League final.

Liverpool made a good start to the 2007–08 season, topping the Premier League table for the first time under Benítez, after a comprehensive 6–0 win over Derby County. Despite this, poor results in the Champions League and a disagreement over future transfers lead to a public falling-out with the club&#x27;s owners, which played out in the media at the end of November. It was suggested that Benítez&#x27;s position was now under serious threat. The resulting coverage resulted in a show of support by fans in support of Benítez which culminated in a fans&#x27; march in support of Benítez ahead of the critical Champions League home tie with Porto, which they won 4–1. It later emerged that Jürgen Klinsmann had been offered Benítez&#x27;s job before eventually accepting the post of Bayern Munich manager. Such a revelation damaged Benítez&#x27;s relations with the Americans, with constant rumours linking the Spaniard with a move back to Real Madrid. Benítez, however, said that his future was at Liverpool and signalled his long-term intentions by appointing Sammy Lee as his new assistant to replace his long-time right-hand man, Pako Ayestarán, who quit after a reported disagreement, which Benítez admitted &quot;hurt&quot; him and arguably Liverpool&#x27;s titles hopes.

Benítez was unable to win any trophies as Liverpool&#x27;s domestic campaign falter in the winter months – including a shock FA Cup exit at home to Barnsley, with his side losing to Chelsea in the Champions League semi-finals. Despite the lack of silverware, the main talking points were off the pitch, with Benítez in the middle of a power struggle with the Liverpool board.

====2008–09: League runner-up====
In a sign of the increasingly strained relationship between the Liverpool manager and his board, Benítez was reportedly close to quitting Liverpool in the summer of 2008 over the board&#x27;s failure to back him in his bid to purchase Gareth Barry from Aston Villa. Benítez had reportedly intended to sell Xabi Alonso to fund the purchase of Barry, but Liverpool CEO Rick Parry was reported to have prioritised signing Robbie Keane over Barry, causing tension when Barry did not arrive. Striker Keane was later re-sold back to Tottenham Hotspur in the January transfer window, with some analysts claiming he was a &quot;pawn in a power struggle&quot; between Benítez and the club&#x27;s owners. This off-field turmoil was in contrast to Liverpool&#x27;s impressive start to the 2008–09 season in the Premier League, including Benítez&#x27; first ever league win against Manchester United at Anfield on 13 September and ending Chelsea&#x27;s 86 match unbeaten run in the league at Stamford Bridge. Liverpool finished the calendar year top of the Premier League for the first time since 1996.

However, Liverpool&#x27;s poor results in the New Year led to a sharper focus on Benítez, who had missed Liverpool&#x27;s draw at Arsenal in December due to an operation to remove kidney stones. An infamous attack on Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson in the media led some pundits and opposition supporters to suggest Benítez was &quot;cracking up&quot; under the pressure of a title bid. Benítez still appeared to be at odds with Liverpool&#x27;s owners, publicly turning down a contract extension and demanding more control over transfers. At one point, rumours of Benítez quitting or being dismissed became so great that bookmakers had to suspend betting on the subject.

Nevertheless, on 18 March 2009, shortly after registering a 4–0 victory over Real Madrid and 4–1 victory over Manchester United, Benítez signed a new five-year deal with the club. Benítez said, &quot;My heart is with Liverpool, so I&#x27;m delighted to sign this new deal, I love the club, the fans and the city and with a club and supporters like this, I could never say no to staying.&quot; With ten wins in their last 11 games, Liverpool finished the season on a high, finishing second in the league for the first time under Benítez, four points off champions Manchester United, with Liverpool playing an attractive brand of attacking football at odds with the side that struggled through the winter months.

====2009–10: Decline and dismissal====
Prior to Benítez&#x27;s final season at Liverpool, Xabi Alonso, one of the key members of Benítez&#x27;s squad, was sold to Real Madrid following a lengthy pursuit in a deal reportedly worth £30 million. Alonso said that Benítez&#x27;s attempts to sell him the previous summer were a deciding factor in his move. Alonso was immediately replaced in the squad by Italian midfielder Alberto Aquilani, signed from Roma for £17 million, who was recovering from a long-term injury. Also added was England defender Glen Johnson for a £17.5 million fee. A &quot;sell to buy&quot; policy enforced by the ownership due to increasing debt, combined with Alonso&#x27;s departure, prompted discontent amongst considerable sections of the club&#x27;s fanbase who believed Benítez was not being backed sufficiently in the transfer market. Benítez&#x27;s decision to sell Alonso and replace him in the side with Lucas Leiva, in addition to Aquilani having arrived at the club injured, was called into question as Liverpool&#x27;s title campaign began with two defeats in the first three games. Benítez defended his decisions, arguing Liverpool&#x27;s slow start was due to key players such as Steven Gerrard being below par.

Liverpool&#x27;s worst run in 22 years combined with an exit from the Champions League at the group stages led to the first major vocal criticism of Benítez by Liverpool fans. It was suggested that this Liverpool team was missing Benítez&#x27;s characteristic defensive rigidity despite the fact that only Manchester United and Chelsea conceded fewer goals than Liverpool, and lacked the necessary depth to cope with injuries to key players such as Gerrard and Fernando Torres while Benítez&#x27;s decision making was called into question. The club subsequently exited the UEFA Europa League at the hands of Atlético Madrid.

Benítez left the club &quot;by mutual consent&quot; on 3 June 2010 with a reported £6 million pay-off; the media speculated that this was because the team had finished seventh in the Premier League, missing out on the Champions League, and suffered poor results, including the defeat by Wigan Athletic. Shortly after his departure from Anfield, Benítez made a £96,000 donation to the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

===Inter Milan===
On 10 June 2010, and only a few days after leaving Liverpool, Benítez agreed a deal to become the new head coach of Serie A and reigning European champions Inter Milan, taking over from José Mourinho, who had left to manage Real Madrid. On 15 June 2010, Benítez was presented to the Italian media for the first time, after signing a two-year deal.
On 21 August 2010, Benítez won his first trophy as manager, the Italian Super Cup, after they defeated Roma 3–1. On 27 August 2010 in Monaco, Inter lost to Atlético Madrid in the 2010 UEFA Super Cup. Benítez&#x27;s first Serie A game in charge was on 31 August 2010 in a 0–0 draw away to Bologna at the Stadio Renato Dall&#x27;Ara. His first league win as manager came on 11 September 2010, a 2–1 win against Udinese at the San Siro.

By December 2010, Inter had slumped to sixth in Serie A, 13 points adrift of the top (although Inter played two games less), having suffered consecutive defeats against arch rivals Milan (which ended a 46 match unbeaten home record), Chievo and Lazio, as well as losing at Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League, leading to speculation that Benítez&#x27;s position was under threat. Despite criticism, Benítez guided Inter to win the FIFA Club World Cup in December 2010. Buoyed by the Club World Cup victory, he told Inter to back him with new signings, or consider whether they wanted to keep him as coach, despite the side having won the treble only a few months earlier. Benítez&#x27;s demands were dismissed out of hand by the ownership, with Massimo Moratti refusing to comment on Benítez&#x27;s continued employment by the club. On 23 December 2010, just five days after bringing Inter to triumph, Benítez was dismissed.

===Chelsea===
On 21 November 2012, following the dismissal of Roberto Di Matteo, Chelsea appointed Benítez as the interim first-team manager until the end of the 2012–13 season. He was unveiled as the new Chelsea manager at a press conference on 22 November 2012. He appointed Boudewijn Zenden as his new assistant manager at Chelsea on the same day.

The appointment was initially unpopular, with many Chelsea fans due to Benítez&#x27; association with Liverpool and comments he had previously made about Chelsea, and he received a &quot;fiercely hostile reception&quot; as he was introduced at his first home game, a 0–0 draw with Manchester City on 25 November 2012. This was followed by a 0–0 draw at home to Fulham and a 3–1 loss to West Ham. On 5 December 2012, Benítez recorded his first win as Chelsea manager, a 6–1 victory at home to Nordsjælland in the Champions League. Despite this win, Chelsea failed to progress beyond the group stage of the competition. This was followed by a 3–1 away victory to Sunderland, with Benítez presiding over his first league win as Chelsea manager.

At the FIFA Club World Cup in December 2012, Chelsea defeated Monterrey 3–1 to reach the final, where they were beaten 1–0 by Brazilian side Corinthians. Chelsea progressed to the League Cup semi-finals with a 5–1 win over Leeds United at Elland Road, and then recorded an 8–0 win over Aston Villa, equalling their record top-flight victory. They subsequently lost 1–0 at home to 20th-placed Queens Park Rangers in the Premier League, and were knocked out of the League Cup semi-finals by underdogs Swansea City 2–0 on aggregate.

On 27 February 2013, following a 2–0 win at Middlesbrough in the FA Cup fifth-round, Benítez heavily criticised the Chelsea board for giving him the title of &quot;interim manager&quot; and the Chelsea fans for their protests against him. He also confirmed that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season. He described his relationship with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich as &quot;excellent&quot; and expressed his desire to remain as Chelsea manager until the end of the season. Results continued to be mixed, and at one point, Chelsea found themselves 16 points behind league leaders Manchester United, having been just four behind when Benítez was appointed. Chelsea reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, losing 2–1 to Manchester City at Wembley Stadium, and also progressed to the final of the UEFA Europa League. In the penultimate league game of the season, Chelsea won 2–1 away to Aston Villa, a game in which Frank Lampard set the all-time scoring record at Chelsea. The win secured a top-four Premier League finish, and with it a place in the following season&#x27;s Champions League.

In the Europa League final against Benfica on 15 May, Chelsea won 2–1. This made Benítez only the second manager after Giovanni Trapattoni to have won the UEFA Cup/Europa League with two different teams, and Chelsea became the fourth club overall and first in Britain to have won all three major European trophies. Defender David Luiz credited Benítez with making critical changes at half time, saying, &quot;He changed some of our positions in the second half. That&#x27;s why we played better and won the title. He spoke a lot to us to change the intensity.&quot; On the winning goal scored by Branislav Ivanović, Juan Mata said, &quot;Rafa told us we had to aim to the far post, because it was Artur&#x27;s weakest place. I just tried to put the ball there and Ivanovic did the rest.&quot;

On 19 May, in his final competitive game as Chelsea manager, Benítez managed the team to a 2–1 home win over Everton, ensuring a third-place finish in the Premier League, and a direct spot in the following season&#x27;s Champions League group stage. Benitez did not take part in the lap of honour after the match, but many fans showed their appreciation for his efforts during the season, a notable contrast to the hostile reception he received before.

===Napoli===
On 27 May 2013, it was announced that Benítez had signed for Napoli, whose previous manager Walter Mazzarri had resigned. Benítez agreed a two-year contract after meeting club president Aurelio De Laurentiis in London.

In his first season in charge, Benítez guided the club to victory in the Coppa Italia, defeating Fiorentina 3–1 in the final, and into the last 16 of the Europa League, exiting after a 3–2 aggregate defeat to Porto. Napoli finished third in Serie A in 2013–14 to qualify for the next season&#x27;s Champions League. They lost 4–2 on aggregate to Athletic Bilbao in the qualifying stages, thus entering the Europa League.

Benítez announced that he would resign at the end of the 2014–15 season. His final match was a 4–2 defeat to Lazio, who took the final place in the Champions League at Napoli&#x27;s expense.

===Real Madrid===
On 3 June 2015, Benítez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager, signing a three-year contract. Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league, until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla in the eleventh matchday. This was followed by a 4–0 home loss in the first Clásico of the season against Barcelona. Madrid later played Cádiz in the Copa del Rey round of 32, winning away 3–1 in the first leg. However, Madrid fielded an ineligible player in the second leg and was ultimately disqualified. Meanwhile, Real topped their UEFA Champions League group with 16 points.

On 4 January 2016, Benítez&#x27;s contract was terminated following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to get good results against top sides. At the time of his dismissal, Real were third in La Liga, four points behind leaders Atlético Madrid and two points behind arch-rivals Barcelona, the latter of whom had a game in hand.

===Newcastle United===
On 11 March 2016, Benítez was appointed manager of relegation threatened Newcastle United, signing on an initial three-year deal. He suffered defeat in his first match in charge, losing 1–0 away to eventual champions Leicester City on 14 March. Benítez would have to wait until 16 April for his first win in charge of &quot;The Magpies&quot;, recording a convincing 3–0 victory over Swansea City in the Premier League.

Newcastle ended the season with a six-match unbeaten run, including a 5–1 final day win over third-place Tottenham Hotspur. However, the team was relegated to the Championship due to rivals Sunderland claiming 12 points from their final six fixtures. On 25 May 2016, it was confirmed that Benítez would remain as manager.

In May 2017, Newcastle achieved promotion, and made an immediate return to the Premier League, after one season in the Championship.

On 24 June 2019, Newcastle announced that Benítez would step down as manager upon the expiration of his contract, and he departed the club on 30 June 2019. Mike Ashley criticised Benítez following his departure, stating that Benítez&#x27;s demands made it impossible for him to remain in charge. However, in an interview with &quot;The Athletic&quot; in December 2020, Benítez stated he was left no choice but to leave the role, due to disagreements with Ashley, describing him as &quot;a businessman who I don&#x27;t believe really cares about his team.&quot;

===Dalian Professional===
On 2 July 2019, Benítez was appointed manager of Chinese Super League side Dalian Professional (formerly Dalian Yifang), signing a two-and-a-half-year deal. On 23 January 2021, Benítez left the club by mutual consent, citing concerns over the health and wellbeing of his family, due to the COVID-19 pandemic as a reason for his departure.

===Everton===
Benítez was appointed manager of Premier League club Everton on a three-year contract on 30 June 2021, replacing Carlo Ancelotti who left to re-join Real Madrid. Before signing the contract, he was a subject to threats from a group of Everton supporters, who opposed his appointment and who left a banner near his home, reading: &quot;We know where you live. Don&#x27;t sign.&quot; Benitez is only the second person to manage both Liverpool and Everton, since William Edward Barclay in the 1890s.

Under Benitez, Everton enjoyed a winning streak across the Premier League and EFL Cup in their first four games. He won his first league game in charge, beating Southampton 3–1. This win was followed up with a 2–2 draw at Leeds United, a 2–1 win at Huddersfield in the EFL Cup and a 2–0 win against Brighton in the Premier League. Due to this unbeaten run, Benitez was nominated for the Manager of the Month award.

Everton&#x27;s form declined in the following months, with the club winning only one game between match days seven and twenty-two. Its only win came in a 2–1 home victory against Arsenal. After a 2–1 defeat to bottom-placed Norwich City at Carrow Road, Benitez was relieved of his duties on 16 January 2022, after six-and-a-half months in charge, with Everton in 15th place, six points above the relegation zone, having lost nine of their previous thirteen games. With his sacking, Benitez became the fifth Everton manager to lose his job in the previous six years.

===Celta Vigo===
On 23 June 2023, Benitez was appointed manager of La Liga club Celta Vigo on a three-year contract, replacing Carlos Carvalhal.

On 12 March 2024, Benitez was sacked after gathering just five wins and 24 points from 28 matches, leaving the club sitting two points from the relegation zone. Benitez had led Celta to the quarterfinals of the Copa del Rey for the first time since 2017 in his brief stint in charge, losing 1–2 to Real Sociedad in January. His last game in charge was a 4–0 defeat to Real Madrid.

==Relations with other managers==
Benítez has had confrontations with both José Mourinho (Chelsea manager from 2004 to 2007) and Manchester United&#x27;s Sir Alex Ferguson during his time in English football. Benítez made a number of suggestions during Mourinho&#x27;s tenure as manager that Roman Abramovich&#x27;s money had bought Chelsea&#x27;s success, and the pair refused to shake hands after some matches (although Mourinho declared the feud to be over after a league game in 2006). When Mourinho exited Chelsea in 2007, Benítez said, &quot;You know my relationship with him, it is better that I do not say anything&quot;, declining to comment as Ferguson and Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger had.

On 9 January 2009, Benítez delivered a controversial appraisal of certain aspects of Sir Alex Ferguson&#x27;s tenure, accusing Ferguson and Manchester United of being nervous because Liverpool were at the top of the league, then accused the Manchester United manager of not being punished for breaking FA rules, suggesting he was &quot;the only manager in the league that cannot be punished for these things&quot;, referring to Ferguson not being punished following an FA charge for comments he made about officials Martin Atkinson and Keith Hackett following an FA Cup tie with Portsmouth. In his 2013 autobiography, Ferguson said that &quot;Benitez bought badly and made the feud personal&quot;.

Benítez has also had confrontations with Sam Allardyce when he was manager of Newcastle United and Blackburn Rovers. When Allardyce was manager of Newcastle, he suggested Benítez would have been dismissed had Liverpool&#x27;s European form been as bad as their league form. In a match in April 2009 when Allardyce was manager of Blackburn, he accused Benítez of arrogance over a gesture he made when Fernando Torres scored Liverpool&#x27;s second goal. Allardyce suggested that Benítez had signalled the game was over despite Liverpool only having a two-goal lead. This view was later supported by Sir Alex Ferguson. Benítez, however, later explained this gesture: he said he had previously told Xabi Alonso to take a short free-kick. This instruction was ignored, which resulted in a goal. Benítez said that he had jokingly signalled to Alonso to ignore his instructions and not that he thought the game was effectively over.

==Management style==

Benítez developed a reputation in English football as a hard man to please, with former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard admitting he longed for a &quot;well done&quot; from Benítez after good performances. Benítez&#x27;s ruthlessness can also be seen in the way he disposed of all but Gerrard and Jamie Carragher from his Champions League winning squad within four seasons, with penalty shoot-out hero Jerzy Dudek made back-up goalkeeper the very season after the European triumph.

Benítez&#x27;s preferred formation is a 4–2–3–1 which he adopted during his time at Valencia and Liverpool. He was highly regarded for his tactical acumen particularly in European ties, setting his team up to exploit opposition weaknesses. His calm demeanour and tactical changes at half time of the 2005 UEFA Champions League final were said to give players belief they could battle back from 3–0 down, although he had to correct his plans when it was pointed out to him his new formation would require 12 players on the pitch. Benítez often plays key players in unorthodox positions to suit a formation – notably converting both Steven Gerrard (in the 2005–06 season) and Dirk Kuyt into right-wingers. As a right winger/midfielder, Steven Gerrard had the most productive seasons trophy-wise, claiming a Champions League title, and an FA Cup.

Benítez is a firm believer in squad rotation and zonal marking. Despite heavy criticism from the English press Benítez persisted with the reward of a Champions League and FA Cup triumph in his first two seasons. Benítez argued he needed to rotate his small squad to ensure key players were fit for the latter stages of these knockout competitions.

The tactic of zonal marking was criticised by pundits when Liverpool conceded from set-pieces in spite of the fact that Benítez&#x27;s squads are usually renowned for their defensive nature and low number of goals scored against them. Benítez stood by his tactic, pointing out that teams who man-mark concede just as many, if not more, goals from set pieces.

Benítez instigated a host of backroom changes at the end of the 2008–09 season to improve the club&#x27;s youth development, including the appointment of club legend Kenny Dalglish in a senior role at the academy.

==Personal life==
Benítez&#x27;s father, Francisco, worked as a hotelier. His mother is Rosario Maudes. Rosario is a big football fan and supported Real Madrid, while his father supported Atlético Madrid. Francisco died in December 2005 while Benítez was in Japan for the FIFA Club World Championship.

Rafael Benítez married Maria Montserrat in 1998. They have two daughters: one who was born in Madrid in 1999 and one who was born in Valencia in 2002. Benítez is fluent in Spanish, English, French and Italian.

<text>Sentient computing is a form of ubiquitous computing which uses sensors to perceive its environment and react accordingly. A common use of the sensors is to construct a world model which allows location-aware or context-aware applications to be constructed.

One famous research prototype of a sentient computing system was the work at AT&amp;T Laboratories, Cambridge (now defunct). It consisted of an ultrasonic indoor location system called the &quot;Active Bats&quot; which provided a location accuracy of about 3 cm. The world model was managed via the SPIRIT database, using CORBA to access information and spatial indexing to deliver high-level events such as &quot;Alice has entered the kitchen&quot; to listening context-aware applications. The research continues at the Digital Technology Group at the University of Cambridge.

Some example applications of the system include:
* A &quot;follow-me phone&quot; which would cause the telephone nearest the recipient to ring.
* Teleporting desktops via VNC just by clicking their Active Bat near the computer.
* Spatial buttons which were activated by clicking the Active Bat at a particular spot (such as a poster).
* Measuring and surveying buildings.
* Location-based games 

== Context adaptation ==

A context adaptive system typically enables the user to maintain a certain application (in different forms) while roaming between different wireless access technologies, locations, devices and even simultaneously executing everyday tasks like meetings, driving a car etc. For example a context adaptive and hence ubiquitous navigation system would offer navigation support in the situations &quot;at home&quot;, &quot;indoor&quot;, &quot;outdoor&quot;, and &quot;in car&quot;. This involves making the navigation functionality available for different availability of output devices, input devices and location sensors as well as adapting the user interaction operability to the current speed, noise or operator handicaps while keeping in mind the overall applicability depending on the user preferences, his knowledge, current task etc.

<text>Jorge Luis Velandia Macías (born January 12, 1975) is a former Major League Baseball shortstop.

==Playing career==
Velandia played with the San Diego Padres (1997), Oakland Athletics (1998–2000), New York Mets (2000–2003), Tampa Bay Devil Rays (2007), Toronto Blue Jays (2008), and Cleveland Indians (2008). On December 1, 2006, the Devil Rays signed Velandia to a minor league deal with an invitation to spring training. His first major league home run, which was a grand slam, came on September 25, 2007. 

In December 2007, Velandia signed a minor league contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was released by the Pirates on March 29, 2008, and signed with the Toronto Blue Jays two days later. Velandia started the 2008 season playing for the Syracuse Chiefs, the Triple-A affiliate of the Blue Jays. On May 7, his contract was purchased by the Blue Jays, and was added to the active roster. On May 16, he was designated for assignment and declined an outright assignment on May 19, becoming a free agent. Velandia signed with the Cleveland Indians on May 26, 2008, and was assigned to their Triple-A affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons.

He was called up on June 12, to replace the injured Josh Barfield (who had been recently called up himself, for Asdrúbal Cabrera). Cabrera returned a month later, and Velandia was sent back to Buffalo. He was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays on August 31. On January 22, 2009, Velandia signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies.

Velandia was the captain of Tiburones de La Guaira in the Venezuelan Winter League until his retirement of active duty in January 2010.

==Coaching career==
After working for the Philadelphia Phillies as assistant minor league field coordinator, he was announced as an assistant coach for the Phillies upon former manager Ryne Sandberg&#x27;s resignation on June 26, 2015.

== Front office career ==
On December 22, 2020, the Phillies named Velandia as the team&#x27;s assistant general manager under Sam Fuld.

On December 19, 2022, the Phillies extended Velandia&#x27;s contract through the 2025 season.

<doc id="730624" wikidata="Q1779538" url="?curid=730624" title="Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission">
<text>The Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) was a multinational body that existed from 2002 to 2008 to monitor the ceasefire between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE, also known as the &quot;Tamil Tigers&quot;) during the Sri Lankan Civil War.

== Establishment and dissolution ==
The SLMM was established on 22 February 2002 to monitor the ceasefire and investigate reported violations of the ceasefire agreement. Mission members were drawn primarily from the Scandinavian countries Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland. Following the cancellation of the ceasefire agreement the SLMM ceased operations on 16 January 2008.

==Organization==
SLMM had its headquarters in Colombo, six district offices in the North and East of Sri Lanka and a liaison office in the LTTE stronghold Kilinochchi. Naval monitoring teams were based in Jaffna and Trincomalee. The SLMM also operated mobile patrol units.

Until the end of August 2006 the SLMM had approximately 60 staff and was headed by the Swedish Senior Colonel Ulf Henricsson.

On 8 June 2006 the LTTE objected to the formal engagement of citizens of European Union states in the SLMM, arguing that it was questionable whether citizens of countries which had banned the LTTE would be sufficiently impartial to be able to adjudicate critical matters on the ground. As a result, about 40 Swedish, Finnish and Danish nationals were withdrawn from the SLMM from 1 September 2006, reducing its staff to about 20 Icelandic and Norwegian nationals and transferring command to Norwegian Major General Lars Johan Sølvberg.

==Reception==
Parties on both sides of the conflict accused the Mission of impartiality and appeasement of the other side. The SLMM regarded its role as documenting violations of the ceasefire agreement, mediating between the parties and supplying factual information to the international sponsors of the peace process.

Leaked diplomatic cables revealed that SLMM caused the gunrunning vessel of the LTTE to evade capture by the Sri Lanka Navy. In 2003 Sri Lankan intelligence identified a LTTE arms re-supply vessel and prepared to intercept it. Because of the ceasefire agreement in place the SLMM was also duly notified. SLMM immediately contacted the Tigers and inquired whether one of their arms resupply ships were operating off the northeastern coast foiling the plan of the Navy to intercept the vessel. The arms resupply vessel escaped from Sri Lankan waters, out of the reach of the navy. After this incident, then Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga requested to remove SLMM chief Tryggve Tellefsen of the Norwegian government. SLMM chief had admitted to then US Ambassador that the SLMM in fact caused the events that allowed the LTTE to evade apprehension by Sri Lanka Navy.

<doc id="730625" wikidata="Q1740372" url="?curid=730625" title="Keystone Studios">
<text>Keystone Studios was an early film studio founded in Edendale, California (which is now a part of Echo Park) on July 4, 1912 as the Keystone Pictures Studio by Mack Sennett with backing from actor-writer Adam Kessel (1866–1946) and Charles O. Baumann (1874–1931), owners of the New York Motion Picture Company (founded 1909). The company, referred to at its office as The Keystone Film Company, filmed in and around Glendale and Silver Lake, Los Angeles for several years, and its films were distributed by the Mutual Film Corporation between 1912 and 1915. The Keystone film brand declined rapidly after Sennett went independent in 1917.

The name &quot;Keystone&quot; was taken from the side of one of the cars of a passing Pennsylvania Railroad train (Keystone State being the nickname of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania) during the initial meeting of Sennett, Kessel and Baumann in New York.

The original main building, the first totally enclosed film stage and studio in history, is still standing. It is located at 1712 Glendale Blvd in Echo Park, Los Angeles and is now being used as a Public storage facility.

==Production==
The studio is especially remembered for its silent film era under Mack Sennett, the Canadian-American film actor, director, and producer, who became known as the &#x27;King of Comedy&#x27;. With financial backing from Adam Kessel and Charles O. Bauman of the New York Motion Picture Company, Sennett founded Keystone Studios in Edendale, California – now a part of Echo Park – in 1912. The original main building which was the first totally enclosed film stage and studio ever constructed, is still there today. Known as Sennett&#x27;s &quot;Fun Factory&quot;, it was here that he created the slapstick antics of the Keystone Cops (from 1912) and the Sennett Bathing Beauties (beginning in 1915). Keystone comedies were noted for their hair-raising car chases and custard pie warfare, especially in the &quot;Keystone Cops&quot; series. Charlie Chaplin got his start in films at Keystone when Sennett hired him in 1914, fresh from his vaudeville career, to make silent films, in which he rapidly became a star performer and film director, participating in thirty-five films within the single year he worked there. Other actors who worked at Keystone toward the beginning of their film careers include Marie Dressler, Harold Lloyd, Mabel Normand, Roscoe Arbuckle, Gloria Swanson, Louise Fazenda, Raymond Griffith, Ford Sterling, Ben Turpin, Harry Langdon, Al St. John and Chester Conklin.

In 1915, Keystone Studios became an autonomous production unit of the Triangle Film Corporation with D. W. Griffith and Thomas Ince. Sennett left in 1917 to produce his own independent films (eventually distributed through Paramount), after which Keystone&#x27;s business declined. Keystone Studios eventually closed after bankruptcy in 1935.


==Legacy==

Much of the lighting and studio equipment from Keystone was bought by Reymond King, who started the &quot;Award Cinema Movie Equipment&quot; company in Venice, CA in November, 1935.

&quot;Keystone Studios&quot; is the fictional studio in the Cineville film &quot;Swimming With Sharks&quot; (1994). 

In 2007, when the independent film studio Cineville merged with the DVD distributor Westlake Entertainment, the companies named their joint enterprise Keystone.

The original Keystone Studios lot was an explorable location, as well as a major plot element, in the 2011 video game &quot;L.A. Noire&quot;, published by Rockstar Games.

<doc id="730629" wikidata="Q480279" url="?curid=730629" title="Abimelech (Judges)">
<text>Abimelech (; &quot;’&quot;) or Abimelek was the king of Shechem and the tribal territory of Manasseh, and a son of biblical judge Gideon. His name can best be interpreted as &quot;my father is king&quot;, claiming the inherited right to rule. He is introduced in Judges 8:31 as the son of Gideon and his Shechemite concubine, and the biblical account of his reign is described in chapter nine of the Book of Judges. According to the Bible, he was an unprincipled and ambitious ruler who often engaged in wars against his own subjects.

==Ascension to kingship==
===The killing of seventy brothers===
According to the Book of Judges, Abimelech went to Shechem to meet with his uncles and grandfather of his mother&#x27;s side, and claimed to them that he should be the sole ruler over them and Shechem and not his brothers. He asked them whether they&#x27;d prefer to be ruled by seventy rulers or just by the individual, and he affirmed them as equal brothers. Because of Abimelech&#x27;s affirmation to them, the men inclined to follow him, and gave him seventy silver shekels from the Temple of Baal Berith. He and the men then traveled to Ophrah for Gideon&#x27;s home to kill Gideon&#x27;s seventy sons, Abimelech&#x27;s brothers; they were killed on the same stone, with only one escaping, Jotham.

===Abimelech declared king===
Since Abimelech was merely a son of Gideon&#x27;s concubine, he made good of his claim to rule over Manasseh by killing his half-brothers. Jotham was the youngest brother and the only one to have escaped Abimelech&#x27;s onslaught. Abimelech was later proclaimed king by the citizens of Beth-millo and Shechem. When Jotham was informed of this news, he went on top of Mount Gerizim and cursed the people of Shechem and Beth-millo for their proclamation, then fled to Beer to hide from Abimelech.

==Battles of Shechem==
===First Battle of Shechem===
Gaal and his brothers arrive at Shechem only to plot a coup against Abimelech with the help of the men of Shechem. Before Gaal could begin his plot, Zebul – who is the governor of Shechem and an officer of Abimelech – heard Gaal&#x27;s plan and was deeply angered. Zebul then sent messengers to inform Abimelech of Gaal&#x27;s plot. Abimelech planned to ambush Gaal and his followers in front of the city gates through the night towards the morning. He divides his followers by four companies to hide and wait near Shechem. The ambush begins as soon as Gaal stands in front of the gates and fails to respond because of the uncertainty of an actual ambush approaching. Zebul taunts Gaal into fighting Abimelech. Gaal soon fights Abimelech during the battle but fails and is forced to flee with his forces. Zebul chases Gaal out of Shechem while Abimelech proceeded to Arumah.

===Second Battle of Shechem===
The next day, the people of Shechem went out into the fields. After Gaal was driven away, Abimelech gathered three companies by dividing his followers to attack the people in the fields for turning against him and siding with Ga&#x27;al. One company went to the gate and the other two attack the people in the fields. Then, Abimelech went into the city and killed the rest and spread salt around so nothing would grow there for a long time. The remaining resistance went to the tower of El-Berith to hold their ground. Abimelech hastily gathered his followers to Mount Zalmon to explain his plan. He grabbed an ax to cut down the bough of a tree and ordered everyone to follow his example. The boughs were placed and set ablaze around the tower, killing the remaining resistance along with a thousand civilians.

==Battle of Thebez and the death of Abimelech==
According to the biblical account, Abimelech and his forces then laid siege to the city of Thebez. By the time Abimelech had breached the wall, the people in the city had already fled and blockaded themselves in a heavily fortified tower. When Abimelech approached the tower to raze it, a woman hurled a runner stone down from the roof, which fell directly onto Abimelech&#x27;s head. Realizing the wound was mortal, Abimelech ordered his armor-bearer to thrust him through with his sword, so nobody would know he was killed by a woman.

==&quot;The Legends of the Jews&quot;==
Louis Ginzberg&#x27;s &quot;The Legends of the Jews&quot; records the following remarks on Abimelech: &quot;In those days the Israelites were so addicted to the worship of Beelzebub that they constantly carried small images of this god with them in their pockets, and every now and then they were in the habit of 
bringing the image forth and kissing it fervently. Of such idolaters were the vain and light fellows who helped Abimelech, the son of Gideon by his concubine from Shechem, to assassinate the other sons of his father. But God is just. As Abimelech murdered his brothers upon a stone, so Abimelech
himself met his death through a millstone. It was proper, then, that Jotham, in his parable, should compare Abimelech to a thorn-bush, while he characterized his predecessors, Othniel, Deborah, and Gideon, as an olive-tree, or a fig-tree, or a vine. This Jotham, the youngest of the sons of Gideon, was more than a teller of parables. He knew then that long afterward the Samaritans would claim sanctity for Mount Gerizim, on account of the blessing pronounced from it upon the tribe. For this reason he chose Gerizim from which to hurl his curse upon Shechem and its inhabitants.&quot;

<text>Allegheny Cemetery is one of the largest and oldest burial grounds in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is a historic rural cemetery.

The non-sectarian, wooded hillside park is located at 4734 Butler Street in the Lawrenceville neighborhood, and bounded by the Bloomfield, Garfield, and Stanton Heights areas. It is sited on the north-facing slope of hills above the Allegheny River.

In 1973 the cemetery&#x27;s Butler Street Gatehouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and, in 1980, the entire cemetery was listed on the National Register.

==History==
Incorporated in 1844, the Allegheny Cemetery is the sixth oldest rural cemetery in the United States. It has been expanded over the years and now encompasses .

Allegheny Cemetery memorializes more than 124,000 people. Some of the oldest graves are of soldiers who fought in the French and Indian War. Their remains were reinterred here, moved from their original burial site at Trinity Cathedral in downtown Pittsburgh. Many notables from the city of Pittsburgh are buried here. The cemetery was among those profiled in the PBS documentary &quot;A Cemetery Special&quot;.

In 1834, three members of the Third Presbyterian Church of Pittsburgh, Dr. J. Ramsey Speer, Stephen Colwell and John Chislett Sr. determined to establish a rural cemetery near Pittsburgh. Dr. Speer later visited several famous rural cemeteries, Mount Auburn Cemetery in Boston, Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, and Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. In 1842 the group selected the 100-acre farm of Colonel Bayard for the site. An Act of Incorporation passed the Pennsylvania Legislature and was signed by Gov. David R. Porter on April 24, 1844.

Mt. Barney was selected as the site of a memorial to naval heroes in 1848, and Commodore Joshua Barney and Lt. James L. Parker were reinterred there. On Memorial Day, 1937, a new memorial was unveiled at Allegheny Cemetery, dedicated to the more than 7,000 servicemen buried here.

<text>Arica Province () is one of two provinces of Chile&#x27;s northernmost region, Arica y Parinacota. The province is bordered on the north by the Tacna Province of Peru, on the south by the Tamarugal Province in the Tarapacá Region, on the east the Parinacota Province and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. Its capital is the port city of Arica.

==History==
Founded as Villa de San Marcos de Arica in 1541 on the site of a pre-Columbian settlement, it belonged to Peru until 1879, when it was captured by the Chileans, who gained control of the locality under the Treaty of Ancón (1883)

==Geography and demography==
According to the 2002 census by the National Statistics Institute (&quot;INE&quot;), the province spans an area of and had a population of 186,488 inhabitants (92,487 men and 94,001 women), giving it a population density of . Between the 1992 and 2002 censuses, the population grew by 9.5% (16,184 persons).

==Administration==
As a province, Arica is a second-level administrative division of Chile, consisting of two communes (&quot;comunas&quot;): Arica in the northern portion and Camarones in the south. The coastal city of Arica serves as the provincial capital. The province is administered by the presidentially appointed regional delegate of Arica y Parinacota.

<doc id="730639" wikidata="Q442449" url="?curid=730639" title="Publius Rutilius Rufus">
<text>Publius Rutilius Rufus (158 BCafter 78 BC) was a Roman statesman, soldier, orator and historian of the Rutilia &quot;gens&quot;, as well as a great-uncle of Gaius Julius Caesar (through his sister Rutilia, Caesar&#x27;s maternal grandmother). He achieved the highest political office in the Roman Republic when he was elected consul in 105 BC.

During his consulship, he reformed the drill system and improved army discipline. As legate to Quintus Mucius Scaevola, he attempted to protect the inhabitants of Asia from extortion by the equites, which provoked them to raise the accusation of extortion from those provincials. The charge was false, but as the juries were chosen from the equestrian order, he was condemned. He was exiled and went to Smyrna, where he wrote a history of Rome in Greek.

==Early life==
He was the third child of a Publius Rutilius, the other children being called Lucius and Rutilia (mother of Gaius Aurelius Cotta). Rufus studied philosophy under Panaetius (becoming a Stoic), law, public speaking under Sulpicius Galba, and Greek.

==Military career and consulship==
He started his military career in 134 BC, as a member of the staff of Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus during the Numantine War. While in Spain he must have come into contact with Gaius Marius and Jugurtha who also served under Scipio. He probably saw action during the Siege of Numantia.

In 115 BC Rufus campaigned to get elected consul. He was defeated for the consulship by Marcus Aemilius Scaurus. After the elections he prosecuted Scaurus for ambitus. Scaurus in turn prosecuted Rufus for the same charge. Both failed.

Rufus was a legate of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus in the campaign against Jugurtha of 109 BC, along with Gaius Marius. He distinguished himself in the Battle of the Muthul, where he faced a charge by Bomilcar and managed to capture or maim most of the Numidian war elephants.

In 105 BC he was elected to the consulship as a senior partner of Gnaeus Mallius Maximus. During his time as consul, Rome was faced with the crisis of potential invasion by the migrating Cimbri and Teutons, who had reached the province of Transalpine Gaul: as the senior consul, and moreover the one with a distinguished military record, one would have expected Rutilius to be the one who led the Roman army north to confront the Germanic tribes. However, for whatever reason, this duty was handed to his junior partner, with disastrous consequences as Mallius and the proconsular governor Servilius Caepio proved unable or unwilling to cooperate, resulting in a shattering defeat at the Battle of Arausio, while Rutilius himself remained in Rome. His main achievements concerned the discipline of the army and the introduction of an improved system of drill. Subsequently, he served as legate to Quintus Mucius Scaevola, governor of Asia.

==Exile and later life==
By assisting his superior in his efforts to protect the inhabitants of Asia from the extortions of the &quot;publicani&quot;, or tax farmers, Rufus incurred the hatred of the equestrian order, to which the &quot;publicani&quot; belonged. In 92 BC he was charged with extorting money from the provincials, although he had made efforts to prevent them from being extorted. The charge was widely known to be false, but as the juries at that time were chosen from the equestrian order, he was condemned, as the order bore a grudge against him. The famous Roman gourmand Apicius had a hand in his demise. His property was confiscated to satisfy claims for compensation.

He retired to Mytilene, and afterwards to Smyrna, where he spent the rest of his life &quot;as an honoured citizen among the provincials he was alleged to have oppressed&quot;. Cicero visited him there as late as the year 78 BC. Although invited by Lucius Cornelius Sulla to return to Rome, Rufus refused to do so. It was during his stay at Smyrna that he wrote his autobiography and a history of Rome in Greek, part of which is known to have been devoted to the Numantine War. He possessed a thorough knowledge of law, and wrote treatises on that subject, some fragments of which are quoted in the Digests. He was also well acquainted with Greek literature.

==Family==
Rufus was married to a Livia, the sister of Marcus Livius Drusus. Their son may have been Publius Rutilius Nudus.

==In fiction==
* In Steven Saylor&#x27;s novel &quot;Wrath of the Furies&quot;, Publius Rutilius Rufus features as one of the secondary characters.
* In Colleen McCullough&#x27;s novel &quot;The First Man in Rome&quot; (the first book in her &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; series) Publius Rutilius Rufus features as one of the secondary characters.

<text>Parinacota Province () is one of two provinces of the Chilean region of Arica y Parinacota. Its capital is Putre. It is named after the Parinacota Volcano.

==History==
Arica y Parinacota Region was created on October 8, 2007 under Law 20.175, promulgated on March 23, 2007 by President Michelle Bachelet in the city of Arica. The law divided the former Tarapacá Region into two: the northern portion became the XV Arica y Parinacota Region, and the southern portion remained the I Tarapacá Region.

==Geography and demography==
According to the 2002 census by the National Statistics Institute (&quot;INE&quot;), the province spans an area of and had a population of 3,156 inhabitants (2,106 men and 1,050 women), giving it a population density of . It is the second least populated province in the country after Antártica Chilena and fifth most sparsely populated province. Between the 1992 and 2002 censuses, the population fell by 17.3% (659 persons).

A 1995 study shows that contrary to the Chilean Spanish spoken in most of Chile there is at least among some of its inhabitants a pronunciation that lacks &quot;yeísmo&quot;.

== Administration ==
As a province, Parinacota is a second-level administrative division of Chile consisting of two communes: General Lagos in the northern portion and Putre in the south. The town of Putre serves as the provincial capital. The provincial government is led by delegate Wagner Sanhueza Guzmán, who was appointed by president Gabriel Boric.

<text>&quot;Jack Be Nimble&quot; is an English language nursery rhyme. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 13902.

==Lyrics==
The most common version of the rhyme is:

:Jack be nimble,
:Jack be quick,
:Jack jump over the candlestick.

==Origins and meaning==

The rhyme is first recorded in a manuscript of around 1815 and was collected by James Orchard Halliwell in the mid-nineteenth century. Jumping candlesticks was a form of fortune telling and a sport. Good luck was said to be signalled by clearing a candle without extinguishing the flame.

<text>41 Daphne is a large asteroid from the asteroid belt. It is a dark-surfaced body 174 km in diameter is probably composed of primitive carbonaceous chondrites. The spectra of the asteroid displays evidence of aqueous alteration. It was discovered by H. Goldschmidt on May 22, 1856, and named after Daphne, the nymph in Greek mythology who was turned into a laurel tree. Incorrect orbital calculations initially resulted in 56 Melete being mistaken for a second sighting of Daphne. Daphne was not sighted again until August 31, 1862.

The orbit of 41 Daphne places it in a 9:22 mean motion resonance with the planet Mars. The computed Lyapunov time for this asteroid is 14,000 years, indicating that it occupies a chaotic orbit that will change randomly over time because of gravitational perturbations of the planets.

In 1999, Daphne occulted three stars, and on July 2, 1999, produced eleven chords indicating an ellipsoid of 213×160 km. Daphnean lightcurves also suggest that the asteroid is irregular in shape. Daphne was observed by Arecibo radar in April 2008. Based upon radar data, the near surface solid density of the asteroid is 2.4.

== Satellite ==

41 Daphne has at least one satellite, named Peneius (provisionally S/2008 (41) 1). It was identified on March 28, 2008, and has a projected separation of 443 km, an orbital period of approximately 1.1 days, and an estimated diameter of less than 2 km. If these preliminary observations hold up, this binary system has the most extreme size ratio known.
In Greek myth, Pēneios is the god of the river of that name, and father of Daphne.

<doc id="730655" wikidata="Q5110670" url="?curid=730655" title="Christie Film Company">
<text>Christie Film Company was an American pioneer motion picture company founded in Hollywood, California by Al Christie and Charles Christie, two brothers from London, Ontario, Canada. It made comedies.

While Charles served almost exclusively in administration, it was Al Christie who made the films. Al had worked with David Horsley at his Centaur Film Company in Bayonne, New Jersey and moved to California on October 27, 1911, to run Nestor Studios, the first ever motion picture studio in Hollywood. The firm closed in 1933.

==The Christies in Hollywood==
In June 1912, Nestor Studios became part of the newly-formed Universal Film Company and Al Christie was put in charge of the comedy companies. He remained with Universal Film until January 1916 at which time he and his brother, Charles Christie, formed their own movie studio named the Christie Film Company. The two rented facilities from Universal at Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street, the place where Al Christie had first started in Hollywood. For the first six months of operations, the new Christie Film Company made comedies under a contract with Universal Film. In July of that year, the company began producing other comedies to sell to the independent distributors and their immediate success was such that they were soon able to finance the acquisition of their studio property. Within a short time, the Christie brothers doubled their stage capacity and constructed a film laboratory equipped with the latest in technology.

Unlike some of the &quot;over the top comedies&quot; being produced at the time, Christie Studios emphasized situational comedy that sometimes featured show girls in skimpy costumes. As comedy specialists, the Christie Film Company debuted comedy actors Harold Lloyd, Fatty Arbuckle, Anita Garvin, and Spencer Williams, later known for his portrayal of Andy Brown in the &quot;Amos &amp; Andy&quot; CBS Television series. The innovative Christie company began issuing &quot;Film Follies&quot;, a magazine advertising the latest films and events at the studio.

In 1921, Canadian Mary Pickford was a driving force behind the creation of the Motion Picture Relief Fund, an organization designed to help actors who had fallen on hard times. Christie Film Company supported this and Charles Christie played a major role, serving on the first Board of Trustees.

By 1922, the brothers were so successful that they set up Christie Realty Corporation (CRC) with $1 million in capital stock. In 1923 CRC bought 230 acres of land in the Westwood section of Los Angeles with plans to build a studio estimated to cost more than $1.75 million dollars (including the value of the land). 

The Christie brothers welcomed Canadian talent and stars such as Marie Dressler and Marie Prevost appeared in their films and became lifelong friends. In 1928, they hired Florence Ryerson to write several short films, including &quot;Hot Lemonade&quot;. Al Christie also hired African-American Spencer Williams as a sound technician but soon recognized Williams&#x27; many talents and involved him in script writing. In early 1929, the Christie Film Company began making the first series of talking pictures written and conceived exclusively for African-American performers. They produced a number of comedy-musical shorts that featured an all-black cast from the Lafayette Players Stock Company out of Harlem, New York. The films, based on the popular Saturday Evening Post&#x27;s &quot;Darktown Birmingham&quot; stories by Octavus Roy Cohen (1891-1959), were distributed by Paramount Studios.

==Demise of company==
However, the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression devastated many businesses and in January 1933, the Christie brothers companies went into receivership and their studio assets were acquired by another large film making company. The liquidation process began on May 26, 1932, as an attorney was instructed to begin the process of turning assets of the film company and the realty company to an assignee, which essentially put the firms into a receivership. Combined assets of the companies were estimated to be $2.5 million - $3 million, and total indebtedness was approximately $2.5 million.

In 1950 Sam Hayes gained television rights for 426 Christie comedies as part of a larger deal with Hollywood Film Enterprises.

<doc id="730658" wikidata="Q715695" url="?curid=730658" title="Strategic bombing during World War II">
<text>World War II (1939–1945) involved sustained strategic bombing of railways, harbours, cities, workers&#x27; and civilian housing, and industrial districts in enemy territory. Strategic bombing as a military strategy is distinct both from close air support of ground forces and from tactical air power. During World War II, many military strategists of air power believed that air forces could win major victories by attacking industrial and political infrastructure, rather than purely military targets. Strategic bombing often involved bombing areas inhabited by civilians, and some campaigns were deliberately designed to target civilian populations in order to terrorize them and disrupt their usual activities. International law at the outset of World War II did not specifically forbid the aerial bombardment of cities – despite the prior occurrence of such bombing during World War I (1914–1918), the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), and the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945).

Strategic bombing during World War II in Europe began on 1 September 1939 when Germany invaded Poland and the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; (German Air Force) began bombing Polish cities and the civilian population in an aerial bombardment campaign. As the war continued to expand, bombing by both the Axis and the Allies increased significantly. The Royal Air Force, in retaliation for Luftwaffe attacks on the UK which started on 16 October 1939, began bombing military targets in Germany, commencing with the Luftwaffe seaplane air base at Hörnum on the 19–20 March 1940. In September 1940 the Luftwaffe began targeting British civilians in the Blitz. After the beginning of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, the Luftwaffe attacked Soviet cities and infrastructure. From February 1942 onward, the British bombing campaign against Germany became even less restricted and increasingly targeted industrial sites and civilian areas. When the United States began flying bombing missions against Germany, it reinforced British efforts. The Allies attacked oil installations, and controversial firebombings took place against Hamburg (1943), Dresden (1945), and other German cities.

In the Pacific War, the Japanese frequently bombed civilian populations as early as 1937–1938, such as in Shanghai and Chongqing. US air raids on Japan escalated from October 1944, culminating in widespread firebombing, and later in August 1945 with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The effectiveness of the strategic bombing campaigns is controversial. Although they did not produce decisive military victories in themselves, some argue that strategic bombing of non-military targets significantly reduced enemy industrial capacity and production, and was vindicated by the surrender of Japan. Estimates of the death toll from strategic bombing range from hundreds of thousands to over a million. Millions of civilians were made homeless, and many major cities were destroyed, especially in Europe and Asia.

The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, which address the codes of wartime conduct on land and at sea, were adopted before the rise of air power. Despite repeated diplomatic attempts to update international humanitarian law to include aerial warfare, it was not updated before the outbreak of World War II. The absence of specific international humanitarian law did not mean aerial warfare was not covered under the laws of war, but rather that there was no general agreement of how to interpret those laws. This means that aerial bombardment of civilian areas in enemy territory by all major belligerents during World War II was not prohibited by positive or specific customary international humanitarian law.

Many reasons exist for the absence of international law regarding aerial bombing in World War II. Most nations had refused to ratify such laws or agreements because of the vague or impractical wording in treaties such as the 1923 Hague Rules of Air Warfare. Also, the major powers&#x27; possession of newly developed advanced bombers was a great military advantage; they would be hard pressed to accept any negotiated limitations regarding this new weapon. In the absence of specific laws relating to aerial warfare, the belligerents&#x27; aerial forces at the start of World War II used the 1907 Hague Conventions — signed and ratified by most major powers — as the customary standard to govern their conduct in warfare, and these conventions were interpreted by both sides to allow the indiscriminate bombing of enemy cities throughout the war.

General Telford Taylor, Chief Counsel for War Crimes at the Nuremberg Trials, wrote that:

Article 25 of the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions on Land Warfare also did not provide a clear guideline on the extent to which civilians may be spared; the same can be held for naval forces. Consequently, cyclical arguments, such as those advanced by Italian general and air power theorist Giulio Douhet, do not appear to violate any of the convention&#x27;s provisions. Due to these reasons, the Allies at the Nuremberg and Tokyo Trials never criminalized aerial bombardment of non-combatant targets and Axis leaders who ordered a similar type of practice were not prosecuted. Chris Jochnick and Roger Normand in their article &quot;The Legitimation of Violence 1: A Critical History of the Laws of War&quot; explains that: &quot;By leaving out morale bombing and other attacks on civilians unchallenged, the Tribunal conferred legal legitimacy on such practices.&quot;

==Ethical considerations==
The concept of strategic bombing and its wide-scale implementation during WWII led to a post-war debate if it was moral.
Three separate lines of ethical reasoning emerged.

The first was based on the Just War theory and emphasized that noncombatants possess an inherent right to be spared from the harm of war and should not be intentionally targeted. Noncombatant immunity and proportionality in use of force were insisted upon.

The second approach was grounded in the so-called &quot;industrial web theory&quot; that proposed to concentrate on destroying enemy military, industrial, and economic infrastructure instead of forces in the field as the fastest way to win the war. Proponents of this approach argued that civilian deaths inflicted by strategic bombing of the cities during the WWII were justified in the sense that they allowed to shorten the war and thus helped to avoid much more casualties.

The third approach was demonstrated by Michael Walzer in his &quot;Just and Unjust Wars&quot; (1977). Walzer formulated the so-called &quot;supreme emergency&quot; thesis. While agreeing in general with prior Just War theoretical postulates, he came to a conclusion that a grave threat to a moral order would justify the use of an indiscriminate force.

Air Marshal Sir Robert Saundby concluded his analysis of the ethics of bombing by these words, 

==Europe==
===Policy at the start of the war===
Before World War II began, the rapid pace of aviation technology created a belief that groups of bombers would be capable of devastating cities. For example, British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin warned in 1932, &quot;The bomber will always get through.&quot;

When the war began on 1 September 1939 with Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the armed neutralitarian United States, issued an appeal to the major belligerents (Britain, France, Germany, and Poland) to confine their air raids to military targets, and &quot;under no circumstances undertake bombardment from the air of civilian populations in unfortified cities&quot;. The British and French agreed to abide by the request, with the British reply undertaking to &quot;confine bombardment to strictly military objectives upon the understanding that these same rules of warfare will be scrupulously observed by all their opponents&quot;. Germany also agreed to abide by Roosevelt&#x27;s request and explained the bombing of Warsaw as within the agreement because it was supposedly a fortified city—Germany did not have a policy of targeting enemy civilians as part of their doctrine prior to World War II.

The British Government&#x27;s policy was formulated on 31 August 1939: if Germany initiated unrestricted air action, the RAF &quot;should attack objectives vital to Germany&#x27;s war effort, and in particular her oil resources&quot;. If the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; confined attacks to purely military targets, the RAF should &quot;launch an attack on the German fleet at Wilhelmshaven&quot; and &quot;attack warships at sea when found within range&quot;. The government communicated to their French allies the intention &quot;not to initiate air action which might involve the risk of civilian casualties&quot;.

While it was acknowledged bombing Germany would cause civilian casualties, the British government renounced deliberate bombing of civilian property, outside combat zones, as a military tactic. The British changed their policy on 15 May 1940, one day after the German bombing of Rotterdam, when the RAF was given permission to attack targets in the Ruhr Area, including oil plants and other civilian industrial targets which aided the German war effort, such as blast furnaces that at night were self-illuminating. The first RAF raid on the interior of Germany took place on the night of 15/16 May 1940 while the Battle of France was still continuing.

===Early war in Europe===
====Poland====

During the German invasion of Poland, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; engaged in massive air raids against Polish cities, bombing civilian infrastructure such as hospitals and targeting fleeing refugees. Notably, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombed the Polish capital of Warsaw, and the small towns Wieluń and Frampol. The bombing of Wieluń, one of the first military acts of World War II and the first major act of bombing, was carried out on a town that had little to no military value. Similarly, the bombing of Frampol has been described as an experiment to test the German tactics and weapons effectiveness. British historian Norman Davies writes in &quot;Europe at War 1939–1945: No Simple Victory&quot;: &quot;Frampol was chosen partly because it was completely defenceless, and partly because its baroque street plan presented a perfect geometric grid for calculations and measurements.&quot;

In his book, &quot;Augen am Himmel&quot; (&quot;Eyes on the Sky&quot;), Wolfgang Schreyer wrote:
Frampol was chosen as an experimental object, because test bombers, flying at low speed, weren&#x27;t endangered by AA fire. Also, the centrally placed town hall was an ideal orientation point for the crews. We watched possibility of orientation after visible signs, and also the size of village, what guaranteed that bombs nevertheless fall down on Frampol. From one side it should make easier the note of probe, from second side it should confirm the efficiency of used bombs.

The directives issued to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; for the Polish Campaign were to prevent the Polish Air Force from influencing the ground battles or attacking German territory. In addition, it was to support the advance of German ground forces through direct tactical and indirect air support with attacks against Polish mobilisation centres and thus delay an orderly Polish strategic concentration of forces and to deny mobility for Polish reinforcements through the destruction of strategic Polish rail routes.

Preparations were made for a concentrated attack (Operation Wasserkante) by all bomber forces against targets in Warsaw. However, the operation was cancelled, according to Polish professor Tomasz Szarota due to bad weather conditions, while German author Horst Boog claims it was possibly due to Roosevelt&#x27;s plea to avoid civilian casualties; according to Boog the bombing of military and industrial targets within the Warsaw residential area called Praga was prohibited. Polish reports from the beginning of September note strafing of civilians by German attacks and bombing of cemeteries and marked hospitals (marking of hospitals proved counterproductive as German aircraft began to specifically target them, until hospitals were moved into the open to avoid such targeting), and indiscriminate attacks on fleeing civilians which according to Szarota was a direct violation of the Hague Convention. Warsaw was first attacked by German ground forces on 9 September and was put under siege on 13 September. German author Boog claims that with the arrival of German ground forces, the situation of Warsaw changed; under the Hague Convention, the city could be legitimately attacked as it was a defended city in the front line that refused calls to surrender.

The bombing of the rail network, crossroads, and troop concentrations played havoc on Polish mobilisation, while attacks upon civilian and military targets in towns and cities disrupted command and control by wrecking the antiquated Polish signal network. Over a period of a few days, &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; numerical and technological superiority took its toll on the Polish Air Force. Polish Air Force bases across Poland were also subjected to &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombing from 1 September 1939.

On 13 September, following orders of the Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe (German &quot;Oberbefehlshaber der Luftwaffe&quot; (&quot;ObdL&quot;)) to launch an attack on Warsaw&#x27;s Jewish Quarter, justified as being for unspecified crimes committed against German soldiers but probably in response to a recent defeat by Polish ground troops, and intended as a terror attack, 183 bomber sorties were flown with 50:50 load of high explosive and incendiary bombs, reportedly set the Jewish Quarter ablaze. On 22 September, Wolfram von Richthofen messaged, &quot;Urgently request exploitation of last opportunity for large-scale experiment as devastation terror raid ... Every effort will be made to eradicate Warsaw completely&quot;. His request was rejected. However, Adolf Hitler issued an order to prevent civilians from leaving the city and to continue with the bombing, which he thought would encourage Polish surrender.

On 14 September, the French Air attaché in Warsaw reported to Paris, &quot;the German Air Force acted in accordance to the international laws of war [...] and bombed only targets of military nature. Therefore, there is no reason for French retorsions.&quot; That day – the Jewish New Year – the Germans concentrated again on the Warsaw&#x27;s Jewish population, bombing the Jewish quarter and targeting synagogues. According to professor Szarota the report was inaccurate – as its author Armengaud didn&#x27;t know about the most barbaric bombings like those in Wieluń or Kamieniec, left Poland on 12 September, and was motivated by his personal political goal to avoid French involvement in the war, in addition the report published in 1948 rather than in 1939.

Three days later, Warsaw was surrounded by the Wehrmacht, and hundreds of thousands of leaflets were dropped on the city, instructing citizens to evacuate the city pending a possible bomber attack. On 25 September the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; flew 1,150 sorties and dropped 560 tonnes of high explosive and 72 tonnes of incendiaries. (Overall, incendiaries made up only three percent of the total tonnage dropped.)

To conserve the strength of the bomber units for the upcoming Western campaign, the modern He 111 bombers were replaced by Ju 52 transports using &quot;worse than primitive methods&quot; for the bombing. Due to prevailing strong winds they achieved poor accuracy, even causing some casualties to besieging German troops.

The only Polish raid against a target in Germany was executed by PZL.23 Karaś light bombers against a factory in Ohlau. The Polish air force left Poland on 18 September 1939 due to the Soviet attack on 17 September 1939, and imminent capture of the Polish airstrips and aircraft stationed in eastern parts of Poland. There was no exception; even Pursuit Brigade, an organic part of the defences of the Polish capital, Warsaw, was transferred to Lublin, one week into the war.

There happened also a non-planned single bombing of the Free City of Danzig. On 7 September, at about 11 PM, a Polish Lublin R.XIII G seaplane was flying over the city, on a mission to attack the German Schleswig-Holstein battleship. However, the vessel had already left the city, so the seaplane flew over the center of Danzig, where it bombed and opened fire on the German troops celebrating the capitulation of the Polish garrison of Westerplatte.

====The Western Front, 1939 to May 1940====
On 3 September 1939, following the German invasion of Poland, the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany and the war in the West began. The RAF bombed German warships and light vessels in several harbours on 3 and 4 September. Eight German Kriegsmarine men were killed at Wilhelmshaven – the war&#x27;s first casualties from British bombs; attacks on ships at Cuxhaven and Heligoland followed. The 1939 Battle of the Heligoland Bight showed the vulnerability of bombers to fighter attack.

Germany&#x27;s first strikes were not carried out until 16 and 17 October 1939, against the British fleet at Rosyth and Scapa Flow. Little activity followed. Meanwhile, attacks by the Royal Air Force dwindled to less than one a month. As the winter set in, both sides engaged in propaganda warfare, dropping leaflets on the populations below. The Phoney War continued.

The British government banned attacks on land targets and German warships in port due to the risk of civilian casualties. For the Germans, the earliest directive from the Luftwaffe head Hermann Göring permitted restricted attacks upon warships anywhere, as well as upon troop transports at sea. However, Hitler&#x27;s &quot;OKW Direktive Nr 2&quot; and &quot;Luftwaffe Direktive Nr 2&quot;, prohibited attacks upon enemy naval forces unless the enemy bombed Germany first, noting, &quot;the guiding principle must be not to provoke the initiation of aerial warfare on the part of Germany.&quot;

After the Altmark Incident, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; launched a strike against the British navy base at Scapa Flow on 16 March 1940, leading to the first British civilian death. A British attack followed three days later against the German airbase at Hörnum on the island of Sylt, hitting a hospital, although there were no casualties. The Germans retaliated with a naval raid.

German bombing of France began on the night of 9/10 May. By 11 May, the French reported bombs dropped on Henin-Lietard, Bruay, Lens, La Fere, Loan, Nancy, Colmar, Pontoise, Lambersart, Lyons, Bouai, Hasebrouck, Doullens and Abbeville with at least 40 civilians killed.

While Allied light and medium bombers attempted to delay the German invasion by striking at troop columns and bridges, the British War Cabinet gave permission for limited bombing raids against targets such as roads and railways west of the Rhine River.

====Rotterdam Blitz====
The Germans used the threat of bombing Rotterdam, the Netherlands, to try to get the Dutch to come to terms and surrender. After a second ultimatum had been issued by the Germans, it appeared their effort had failed and on 14 May 1940, &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombers were ordered to bomb Rotterdam in an effort to force the capitulation of the besieged city. The controversial bombing targeted the centre of the besieged city, instead of providing direct tactical support for the hard-pressed German 22nd Infantry Division (under Lt. Gen. von Sponeck, which had airlanded on 10 May) in combat with Dutch forces northwest of the city, and in the eastern part of the city at the Meuse river bridge. At the last minute, the Netherlands decided to submit and sent a plenipotentiary and other negotiators across to German lines. There was an attempt to call off the assault, but the bombing mission had already begun. In legal terms, the attack was performed against a defended part of a city vital for the military objectives and in the front-line, and the bombing respected Article 25 to 27 of the Hague Conventions on Land Warfare.

Out of 100 Heinkel He 111s, 57 dropped their ordnance, a combined 97 tons of bombs. In the resulting fire of the city centre were devastated, including 21 churches and 4 hospitals. The strike killed between 800 and 1,000 civilians, wounded over 1,000, and made 78,000 homeless. In 2022, archival research showed a total of 1,150 to 1,250 civilians, and Dutch army and Nazi army personnel were killed during the Rotterdam Blitz. Nearly twenty-five thousand homes, 2,320 stores, 775 warehouses and 62 schools were destroyed.

Whilst German historian Horst Boog says British propaganda inflated the number of civilian casualties by a factor of 30, contemporary newspaper reports show the Dutch legation in Paris initially estimated 100,000 people were killed, the Dutch legation in New York later issued a revised figure of 30,000. International news agencies widely reported these figures, portraying Rotterdam as a city mercilessly destroyed by terror bombing without regard for civilian life, with 30,000 dead lying under the ruins. It has been argued that the bombing was against well-defined targets, albeit in the middle of the city, and would have assisted the advancing German Army. The Germans had threatened to bomb Utrecht in the same fashion, and the Netherlands surrendered.

====Allied response====
Following the attack on Rotterdam, RAF Bomber Command was authorized to attack German targets east of the Rhine on 15 May 1940; the Air Ministry authorized Air Marshal Charles Portal to attack targets in the Ruhr, including oil plants and other civilian industrial targets which aided the German war effort, such as blast furnaces. The underlying motive for the attacks was to divert German air forces away from the land front. Churchill explained the rationale of his decision to his French counterparts in a letter dated the 16th: &quot;I have examined today with the War Cabinet and all the experts the request which you made to me last night and this morning for further fighter squadrons. We are all agreed that it is better to draw the enemy on to this Island by striking at his vitals, and thus to aid the common cause.&quot; Due to the inadequate British bomb-sights the strikes that followed &quot;had the effect of terror raids on towns and villages.&quot; On the night of 15/16 May, 96 bombers crossed the Rhine and attacked targets in Gelsenkirchen. 78 had been assigned oil targets, but only 24 claimed to have accomplished their objective.

On the night of 17/18 May, RAF Bomber Command bombed oil installations in Hamburg and Bremen; the H.E. and 400 incendiaries dropped caused six large, one moderately large and 29 small fires. As a result of the attack, 47 people were killed and 127 were wounded. Railway yards at Cologne were attacked on the same night. During May, Essen, Duisburg, Düsseldorf and Hanover were attacked in a similar fashion by Bomber Command. In June, attacks were made on Dortmund, Mannheim, Frankfurt and Bochum. At the time, Bomber Command lacked the necessary navigational and bombing technical background and the accuracy of the bombings during the night attacks was abysmal. Consequently, the bombs were usually scattered over a large area, causing an uproar in Germany. On the night of 7/8 June 1940 a single French Navy Farman F.223 aircraft bombed Berlin, the first Allied attack on the capital.

Despite the British attacks on German cities, the Luftwaffe did not begin to attack military and economic targets in the UK until six weeks after the campaign in France was concluded.

====The Battle of Britain and the Blitz====
On 22 June 1940, France signed an armistice with Germany. Britain was determined to keep fighting. On 1/2 July, the British attacked the German warships and in the port of Kiel and the next day, 16 RAF bombers attacked German train facilities in Hamm.

The Battle of Britain began in early June 1940 with small scale bombing raids on Britain. These &quot;Störangriffe&quot; (&quot;nuisance raids&quot;) were used to train bomber crews in both day and night attacks, to test defences and try out methods. These training flights continued through July and August, and into the first week of September. Hermann Göring&#x27;s general order, issued on 30 June 1940, stated:

The &quot;Kanalkampf&quot; of attacks on shipping and fighter skirmishes over the English Channel started on 4 July, and escalated on 10 July, a day which Dowding later proposed as the official start date for the Battle. Throughout the battle, Hitler called for the British to accept peace, but they refused to negotiate.

Still hoping that the British would negotiate for peace, Hitler explicitly prohibited attacks on London and against civilians. Any airmen who, intentionally or unintentionally, violated this order were punished. Hitler&#x27;s No. 17 Directive, issued 1 August 1940, established the conduct of war against Britain and specifically forbade the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; from conducting terror raids. The Führer declared that terror attacks could only be a means of reprisal, as ordered by him.

On 6 August Göring finalised plans for &quot;Operation Eagle Attack&quot; with his commanders: destruction of RAF Fighter Command across the south of England was to take four days, then bombing of military and economic targets was to systematically extend up to the Midlands until daylight attacks could proceed unhindered over the whole of Britain, then a major attack was to be made on London causing a crisis with refugees when the intended Operation Sea Lion invasion was due to begin.
On 8 August 1940, the Germans switched to raids on RAF fighter bases. To reduce losses, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; also began to use increasing numbers of bombers at night. From the night of 19/20 August night bombing targeted the aircraft industry, ports, harbours, and other strategic targets in towns and cities, including suburban areas around London. By the last week of August, over half the missions were flown under the cover of dark. On 24 August, several off-course German bombers accidentally bombed central areas of London. The next day, the RAF bombed Berlin for the first time, targeting Tempelhof airfield and the Siemens factories in Siemenstadt. These attacks were seen by the Germans as indiscriminate due to their inaccuracy, and this infuriated Hitler; he ordered that the &#x27;night piracy of the British&#x27; be countered by a concentrated night offensive against the island, and especially London. In a public speech in Berlin on 4 September 1940, Hitler announced that:

The Blitz was underway. Göring – at Kesselring&#x27;s urging and with Hitler&#x27;s support – turned to a massive assault on the British capital. On 7 September 318 bombers from the whole KG 53 supported by eight other , flew almost continuous sorties against London, the dock area which was already in flames from earlier daylight attacks. The attack of 7 September 1940 did not entirely step over the line into a clear terror bombing effort since its primary target was the London docks, but there was clearly an assumed hope of terrorizing the London population. Hitler himself hoped that the bombing of London would terrorize the population into submission. He stated that &quot;If eight million [Londoners] go mad, it might very well turn into a catastrophe!&quot;. After that he believed &quot;even a small invasion might go a long way&quot;. Another 250 bomber sorties were flown in the night. By the morning of 8 September 430 Londoners had been killed. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; issued a press notice announcing they had dropped more than of bombs on London in 24 hours. Many other British cities were hit in the nine-month Blitz, including Plymouth, Swansea, Birmingham, Sheffield, Liverpool, Southampton, Manchester, Bristol, Belfast, Cardiff, Clydebank, Kingston upon Hull and Coventry. Basil Collier, author of &#x27;The Defence of the United Kingdom&#x27;, the HMSO&#x27;s official history, wrote:
In addition to the conclusions of Basil Collier to that effect there are also, for example, the 1949 memoirs of General Henry H. Arnold who had been in London in 1941 and supported Collier&#x27;s estimate. Harris noted in 1947 that the Germans had failed to take the opportunity to destroy English cities by concentrated incendiary bombing.

As the war continued, an escalating war of electronic technology developed. To counter German radio navigation aids, which helped their navigators find targets in the dark and through cloud cover, the British raced to work out the problems with countermeasures (most notably airborne radar, as well as highly effective deceptive beacons and jammers).

Despite causing a great deal of damage and disrupting the daily lives of the civilian population, the bombing of Britain failed to have an impact. British air defenses became more formidable, and attacks tapered off as Germany abandoned its efforts against Britain and focused more on the Soviet Union.

Operation Abigail Rachel, the bombing of Mannheim, was one of the first revenge bombings by the British against a German city on 16 December. The British had been waiting for the opportunity to experiment with such a raid aimed at creating a maximum of destruction in a selected town since the summer of 1940, and the opportunity was given after the German raid on Coventry. Internally it was declared to be a reprisal for Coventry and Southampton. The new bombing policy was officially ordered by Churchill at the start of December, on condition it receive no publicity and be considered an experiment. Target marking and most bombs missed the city centre. This led to the development of the bomber stream. Despite the lack of decisive success of this raid, approval was granted for further Abigails.

This was the start of a British drift away from precision attacks on military targets and towards area bombing attacks on whole cities.

===Germany later in the war===
Goering&#x27;s first chief of staff, &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Walther Wever, was a big advocate of the Ural bomber program, but when he died in a flying accident in 1936, support for the strategic bomber program began to dwindle rapidly under Goering&#x27;s influence. Under pressure from Goering, Albert Kesselring, Wever&#x27;s replacement, opted for a medium, all-purpose, twin-engine tactical bomber. Erhard Milch, who strongly supported Goering&#x27;s conceptions, was instrumental in the Luftwaffe&#x27;s future. Milch believed that the German industry (in terms of raw materials and production capacity) could only produce 1,000 four-engine heavy bombers per year, but many times that number of twin-engine bombers. In spring of 1937, just when the Luftwaffe&#x27;s own Technical Office had passed the Ju-89 and Do-19 heavy bomber models as ready for testing, Goering ordered a halt to all work on the four-engine strategic bomber program.

However, in 1939 the &quot;Bomber B&quot; program sought to produce a twin-engined strategic bomber that could carry nearly-equivalent bombloads of Allied four-engined heavy bombers, but as an advanced development of the pre-war &quot;Schnellbomber&quot; concept. The &quot;Bomber B&quot; designs meant to achieve top level speeds of at least 600 km/h (370 mph). The &quot;Bomber B&quot; program went nowhere, as the intended designs required pairs of combat-reliable aviation engines of at least 1,500 kW (2,000 PS) apiece, something that the German aviation engine industry had serious problems in developing. A further design program was initiated in the late spring of 1942, to develop four-engine (and later six-engine) bombers with trans-Atlantic range to attack the continental United States and aptly named the &quot;Amerika Bomber&quot;. This also went nowhere, with only five prototype airframes from two design competitors getting airborne for testing, before the war&#x27;s end.

The only heavy bomber design to see service with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in World War II was the trouble-prone Heinkel He 177A. In the initial design of November 1937, the RLM had mistakenly decided that the He 177 should also have a medium angle &quot;dive bombing&quot; capability. Ernst Heinkel and Milch vehemently disagreed with this, but the requirement was not rescinded until September 1942 by Goering himself. The He 177A went into service in April 1942, despite an ongoing series of engine fires in the small batch of A-0 series production prototype aircraft. This deficiency, along with numerous, seriously deficient design features, led Goering to decry the He 177A&#x27;s Daimler-Benz DB 606 powerplants to be nothing more than fire-prone, cumbersome &quot;welded-together engines&quot; in August of that year. Production of the B-series by Heinkel&#x27;s only subcontractor for the &quot;Greif&quot;, &quot;Arado Flugzeugwerke&quot;, would not have started until November 1944, because of Arado&#x27;s focus on the production of its own Arado Ar 234 jet-powered reconnaissance-bomber at the time. The July 1944-initiated Emergency Fighter Program (), as well as the devastating effects of Allied bombing on the entire German aviation industry, prevented any production of the He 177B design.

The He 177A entered service in April 1942. At this time, after a destructive RAF attack on Lübeck, Adolf Hitler ordered the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; to retaliate with the so-called Baedeker Blitz:
In January 1944, a beleaguered Germany tried to strike a blow to British morale with terror bombing with Operation Steinbock, nicknamed the &quot;Baby Blitz&quot; by the British. At this stage of the war, Germany was critically short of heavy and medium bombers, with the added obstacles of a highly effective and sophisticated British air-defence system, and the increasing vulnerability of airfields in occupied Western Europe to Allied air attack making the effectiveness of German retaliation more doubtful.

British historian Frederick Taylor asserts that &quot;all sides bombed each other&#x27;s cities during the war. Half a million Soviet citizens, for example, died from German bombing during the invasion and occupation of Russia. That&#x27;s roughly equivalent to the number of German citizens who died from Allied raids.&quot;
The Luftwaffe destroyed numerous Soviet cities through bombing, including Minsk, Sevastopol, and Stalingrad. 20,528 tons of bombs were dropped on Sevastopol in June 1942 alone. German bombing efforts on the Eastern Front dwarfed its commitments in the west. From 22 June 1941 to 30 April 1944, the Luftwaffe dropped 756,773 tonnes of bombs on the Eastern Front, a monthly average of 22,000 tonnes.
German scientists had invented vengeance weapons – V-1 flying bombs and V-2 ballistic missiles – and these were used to launch an aerial assault on London and other cities in southern England from continental Europe. The campaign was much less destructive than the Blitz. As the Allies advanced across France and towards Germany from the West, Paris, Liège, Lille, and Antwerp also became targets.

The British and US directed part of their strategic bombing effort to the eradication of &quot;wonder weapon&quot; threats in what was later known as Operation Crossbow. The development of the V2 was hit preemptively in Operation Hydra of August 1943 against Peenemunde research facility.

===The British later in the war===
The purpose of the area bombardment of cities was laid out in a British Air Staff paper, dated 23 September 1941:
During the first few months of the area bombing campaign, an internal debate within the British government about the most effective use of the nation&#x27;s limited resources in waging war on Germany continued. Should the Royal Air Force (RAF) be scaled back to allow more resources to go to the British Army and Royal Navy or should the strategic bombing option be followed and expanded? An influential paper was presented to support the bombing campaign by Professor Frederick Lindemann, the British government&#x27;s leading scientific adviser, justifying the use of area bombing to &quot;dehouse&quot; the German workforce as the most effective way of reducing their morale and affecting enemy war production.

Mr. Justice Singleton, a High Court Judge, was asked by the cabinet to look into the competing points of view. In his report, delivered on 20 May 1942, he concluded:
In the end, thanks in part to the dehousing paper, it was this view which prevailed and Bomber Command would remain an important component of the British war effort up to the end of World War II. A large proportion of the industrial production of the United Kingdom was harnessed to the task of creating a vast fleet of heavy bombers. Until 1944, the effect on German production was remarkably small and raised doubts whether it was wise to divert so much effort—the response being there was nowhere else the effort could have been applied, as readily, to greater effect.

Lindemann was liked and trusted by Winston Churchill, who appointed him the British government&#x27;s leading scientific adviser with a seat in the Cabinet. In 1942, Lindemann presented the &quot;dehousing paper&quot; to the Cabinet showing the effect that intensive bombing of German cities could produce. It was accepted by the Cabinet, and Air Marshal Harris was appointed to carry out the task. It became an important part of the total war waged against Germany. Professor Lindemann&#x27;s paper put forward the theory of attacking major industrial centres in order to deliberately destroy as many homes and houses as possible. Working-class homes were to be targeted because they had a higher density and fire storms were more likely. This would displace the German workforce and reduce their ability to work. His calculations (which were questioned at the time, in particular by Professor P. M. S. Blackett of the Admiralty operations research department, expressly refuting Lindemann&#x27;s conclusions) showed the RAF&#x27;s Bomber Command would be able to destroy the majority of German houses located in cities quite quickly. The plan was highly controversial even before it started, but the Cabinet thought that bombing was the only option available to directly attack Germany (as a major invasion of the continent was almost two years away), and the Soviets were demanding that the Western Allies do something to relieve the pressure on the Eastern Front. Few in Britain opposed this policy, but there were three notable opponents in Parliament, Bishop George Bell and the Labour MPs Richard Stokes and Alfred Salter.
On 14 February 1942, the area bombing directive was issued to Bomber Command. Bombing was to be &quot;focused on the morale of the enemy civil population and in particular of the industrial workers.&quot; Though it was never explicitly declared, this was the nearest that the British got to a declaration of unrestricted aerial bombing – Directive 22 said &quot;You are accordingly authorised to use your forces without restriction&quot;, and then listing a series of primary targets which included Dortmund, Essen, Duisburg, Düsseldorf, and Cologne. Secondary targets included Braunschweig, Lübeck, Rostock, Bremen, Kiel, Hanover, Frankfurt, Mannheim, Stuttgart, and Schweinfurt. The directive stated that &quot;operations should now be focused on the morale of the enemy civilian population, and in particular, the industrial workers&quot;. Lest there be any confusion, Sir Charles Portal wrote to Air Chief Marshal Norman Bottomley on 15 February,

Factories were no longer targets.

The first true practical demonstrations were on the night of 28 to 29 March 1942, when 234 aircraft bombed the port of Lübeck. This target was chosen not because it was a significant military target, but because it was expected to be particularly susceptible – in Harris&#x27;s words it was &quot;built more like a fire lighter than a city&quot;. The old timber structures burned well, and the raid destroyed most of the city&#x27;s centre. A few days later, Rostock suffered the same fate.
At this stage of the air war, the most effective and disruptive examples of area bombing were the &quot;thousand-bomber raids&quot;. Bomber Command was able by organization and drafting in as many aircraft as possible to assemble very large forces which could then attack a single area, overwhelming the defences. The aircraft would be staggered so that they would arrive over the target in succession: the new technique of the &quot;bomber stream&quot;.

On 30 May 1942, between 0047 and 0225 hours, in Operation Millennium 1,046 bombers dropped over 2,000 tons of high explosive and incendiaries on Cologne, and the resulting fires burned it from end to end. The damage inflicted was extensive. The fires could be seen 600 miles away at an altitude of 20,000 feet. Some 3,300 houses were destroyed, and 10,000 were damaged. 12,000 separate fires raged destroying 36 factories, damaging 270 more, and leaving 45,000 people with nowhere to live or to work. Only 384 civilians and 85 soldiers were killed, but thousands evacuated the city. Bomber Command lost 40 bombers.

Two further thousand-bomber raids were conducted over Essen and Bremen, but neither so utterly shook both sides as the scale of the destruction at Cologne and Hamburg. The effects of the massive raids using a combination of blockbuster bombs (to blow off roofs) and incendiaries (to start fires in the exposed buildings) created firestorms in some cities. The most extreme examples of which were caused by Operation Gomorrah, the combined USAAF/RAF attack on Hamburg, (45,000 dead), attack on Kassel (10,000 dead), the attack on Darmstadt (12,500 dead), the attack on Pforzheim (21,200 dead), the attack on Swinemuende (23,000 dead) and the attack on Dresden (25,000 dead).

According to economic historian Adam Tooze, in his book &quot;The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy&quot;, a turning point in the bomber offensive was reached in March 1943, during the Battle of the Ruhr. Over five months 34,000 of bombs were dropped. Following the raids, steel production fell by 200,000 tons, making a shortfall of 400,000 tons. Speer acknowledged that the RAF were hitting the right targets, and raids severely disrupted his plans to increase production to meet increasing attritional needs. Between July 1943 and March 1944 there were no further increases in the output of aircraft.

The bombing of Hamburg in 1943 also produced impressive results. Attacks on Tiger I heavy tank production, and of that of 88mm guns, the most potent dual-purpose artillery piece in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, meant that output of both was &quot;set back for months&quot;. On top of this, some 62 percent of the population was dehoused causing more difficulties. However, RAF Bomber Command allowed itself to be distracted by Harris&#x27; desire for a war winning blow, and attempted the fruitless missions to destroy Berlin and end the war by spring, 1944.

In October 1943, Harris urged the government to be honest with the public regarding the purpose of the bombing campaign. To Harris, his complete success at Hamburg confirmed the validity and necessity of his methods, and he urged that:

He further said,
By contrast, the United States Strategic Bombing Survey found attacks on waterways, beginning 23 September with strikes against the Dortmund-Ems Canal and Mittelland Canal, produced tremendous traffic problems on the Rhine River. It had immediate effects on shipments of goods, and especially coal deliveries, upon which Germany&#x27;s economy depended; with no more additional effort, by February 1945, rail transport (which competed for coal) had seen its shipments cut by more than half, and by March, &quot;except in limited areas, the coal supply had been eliminated.&quot;

The devastating bombing raids of Dortmund on 12 March 1945 with 1,108 aircraft – 748 Lancasters, 292 Halifaxes, 68 de Havilland Mosquitos – was a record attack on a single target in the whole of World War II. More than 4,800 tonnage of bombs was dropped through the city centre and the south of the city and destroyed 98% of buildings.

====Other British efforts====
Operation Chastise, better known as the Dambusters raid, was an attempt to damage German industrial production by crippling its hydro-electric power and transport in the Ruhr area. The Germans also built large-scale night-time decoys like the Krupp decoy site () which was a German decoy-site of the Krupp steel works in Essen. During World War II, it was designed to divert Allied airstrikes from the actual production site of the arms factory.

Operation Hydra of August 1943 sought to destroy German work on long-range rockets but only delayed it by a few months. Subsequent efforts were directed against V-weapons launch sites in France.

===U.S. bombing in Europe===

In mid 1942, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) arrived in the UK and carried out a few raids across the English Channel. The USAAF Eighth Air Force&#x27;s B-17 bombers were called the &quot;Flying Fortresses&quot; because of their heavy defensive armament of ten to twelve machine guns — eventually comprising up to thirteen heavy 12.7 mm calibre, &quot;light barrel&quot; Browning M2 guns per bomber — and armor plating in vital locations. In part because of their heavier armament and armor, they carried smaller bomb loads than British bombers. With all of this, the USAAF&#x27;s commanders in Washington, D.C., and in UK adopted the strategy of taking on the Luftwaffe head on, in larger and larger air raids by mutually defending bombers, flying over Germany, Austria, and France at high altitudes during the daytime. Also, both the U.S. Government and its Army Air Forces commanders were reluctant to bomb enemy cities and towns indiscriminately. They claimed that by using the B-17 and the Norden bombsight, the USAAF should be able to carry out &quot;precision bombing&quot; on locations vital to the German war machine: factories, naval bases, shipyards, railroad yards, railroad junctions, power plants, steel mills, airfields, etc.

In January 1943, at the Casablanca Conference, it was agreed RAF Bomber Command operations against Germany would be reinforced by the USAAF in a Combined Operations Offensive plan called Operation Pointblank. Chief of the British Air Staff Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Charles Portal was put in charge of the &quot;strategic direction&quot; of both British and American bomber operations. The text of the Casablanca directive read: &quot;Your primary object will be the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial, and economic system and the undermining of the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened.&quot; At the beginning of the combined strategic bombing offensive on 4 March 1943, 669 RAF and 303 USAAF heavy bombers were available.
In late 1943, the &#x27;Pointblank&#x27; attacks manifested themselves in the Schweinfurt raids (first and second). Despite the use of combat boxes and the assembly ships to form them, formations of unescorted bombers were no match for German fighters, which inflicted a deadly toll. In despair, the Eighth halted air operations over Germany until a long-range fighter could be found in 1944; it proved to be the North American P-51 Mustang, which had the range to fly to Berlin and back.

USAAF leaders firmly held to the claim of &quot;precision bombing&quot; of military targets for much of the war, and dismissed claims they were simply bombing cities. However, the weather over Europe seldom left the target visible. The American Eighth Air Force received the first H2X radar sets (a derivative of the British H2S navigational radar) in December 1943. Within two weeks of the arrival of these first six sets, the Eighth command gave permission for them to area bomb a city using H2X and would continue to authorize, on average, about one such attack a week until the end of the war in Europe.

In reality, the day bombing of WWII was &quot;precision bombing&quot; only in the sense that most bombs fell somewhere near a specific designated target such as a railway yard. Conventionally, the air forces designated as &quot;the target area&quot; a circle having a radius of 1,000 feet (300 m) around the aiming point of attack. While accuracy improved during the war, Survey studies show that, overall, only about 20% of the bombs aimed at precision targets fell within this target area. In the fall of 1944, only seven percent of all bombs dropped by the Eighth Air Force hit within 1,000 feet of their aim point.

Nevertheless, the sheer tonnage of explosive delivered by day and by night was eventually sufficient to cause widespread damage, and forced Germany to divert military resources to counter it. The diversion of German fighter planes and anti-aircraft 88 mm artillery from the eastern and western fronts was a significant result of the Allied strategic bombing campaign.

For the sake of improving USAAF firebombing capabilities, a mock-up German Village was built up and repeatedly burned down. It contained full-scale replicas of German residential homes. Firebombing attacks proved quite successful, in a series of attacks launched by the RAF and US forces in July 1943 on Hamburg, roughly 50,000 civilians were killed and large areas of the city destroyed.

With the arrival of the brand-new Fifteenth Air Force based in Italy, command of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe was consolidated into the United States Strategic Air Forces (USSTAF). With the addition of the Mustang to its strength — and a major change in fighter tactics by the Eighth Air Force, meant to secure daylight air supremacy for the Americans over Germany from the start of 1944 onwards — the Combined Bomber Offensive was resumed. Planners targeted the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in an operation known as &#x27;Big Week&#x27; (20–25 February 1944) and succeeded brilliantly – its major attacks came during Operation Steinbock (the so-called &quot;Baby Blitz&quot;) period for the Luftwaffe over England, while losses for the Luftwaffe&#x27;s day fighter forces were so heavy that both the twin-engined heavy fighter wings (the intended main anti-bomber force) and their replacement, single-engined of heavily armed Fw 190As became largely ineffective, clearing each force of bomber destroyers in their turn from Germany&#x27;s skies throughout most of 1944. With such heavy losses of their primary means of defense against the USAAF&#x27;s tactics, German planners were forced into a hasty dispersal of industry, with the day fighter arm never being able to fully recover in time.

On 27 March 1944, the Combined Chiefs of Staff issued orders granting control of all the Allied air forces in Europe, including strategic bombers, to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, who delegated command to his deputy in SHAEF Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder. There was resistance to this order from some senior figures, including Churchill, Harris, and Carl Spaatz, but after some debate, control passed to SHAEF on 1 April 1944. When the Combined Bomber Offensive officially ended on 1 April, Allied airmen were well on the way to achieving air superiority over all of Europe. While they continued some strategic bombing, the USAAF along with the RAF turned their attention to the tactical air battle in support of the Normandy Invasion. It was not until the middle of September that the strategic bombing campaign of Germany again became the priority for the USSTAF.

The twin campaigns—the USAAF by day, the RAF by night—built up into massive bombing of German industrial areas, notably the Ruhr, followed by attacks directly on cities such as Hamburg, Kassel, Pforzheim, Mainz and the often-criticized bombing of Dresden.

Approximately 10% of the bombs dropped on Germany are thought to have failed to explode.

===Bombing in the Netherlands later in the war===
Eventually, the Netherlands surrendered on the 15th of May 1940, after the bombings of multiple Dutch cities by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; from 10 to 14 May, which had killed 1250-1350 citizens. However, Zeeland continue to resist the German occupation with assistance from Belgian and French forces till the 27th of May, resulting in another bombing by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in Middelburg on the 17th of May.

During the German occupation of the Netherlands from May 1940, the Allied Forces would perform approximately 600 strategic air bombings on Dutch soil. In most cases there were no civilians killed but due to the damage caused by these attacks, many of the survivors were left homeless and wounded. However, in total around 10,000 Dutch civilians were killed by airstrikes from the Allied Forces between May 1940 and May 1945.

Most of the losses by Allied airstrikes in the Netherlands were caused by mistakenly bombing the wrong target, initially aiming at German-occupied factories, transportation facilities, population registries, headquarters, or even German cities at the border. The Allies generally exercised restraint when planning bombing raids. It is mainly mistakes in implementation that have often caused the greatest damage. The cities of Amsterdam, Breskens, Den Helder, Rotterdam, and The Hague suffered immense losses in civilians and bombing damage by insufficiently accurate aiming. Sometimes the targets were too small, so the risks of &#x27;collateral damage&#x27; were very high, as was shown by the bombing of the headquarters in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, the station yards of Haarlem, Utrecht, Roosendaal and Leiden, and the bridges in Zutphen and Venlo. However, the attacks on such small targets remained relatively limited. Less restraint was exercised by the Allies during the 1944–1945 bombings on the residential areas at the front line, such as Huissen, Venray, Montfort, Nijverdal, Goor and Haaksbergen, resulting in preventable civilian losses.

The occupying German forces had used the coast of the Netherlands to launch rocket attacks targeting British cities. This was another reasons for the Allies to perform airstrikes on Dutch soil, leading to one of the deadliest civilian airstrikes in the Netherlands. On 3 March 1945, the RAF mistakenly bombed the densely populated Bezuidenhout neighbourhood in the city of The Hague. The British bomber crews had intended to bomb the Haagse Bos (&quot;Forest of the Hague&quot;) district where the Germans had installed V-2 launching facilities that had been used to attack British cities. However, the pilots were issued with the wrong coordinates, so the navigational instruments of the bombers had been set incorrectly. Combined with fog and clouds which obscured their vision, the bombs were instead dropped on the Bezuidenhout residential neighbourhood. At the time, the neighbourhood was more densely populated than usual with evacuees from The Hague and Wassenaar; 532 residents were killed and approximately 30,000 were left homeless.

During the end of the war in 1944–1945, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; would again drop bombs on multiple Dutch cities, which were already liberated by the Allies in Operation Market Garden while the rest of the country was still under German occupation. The Netherlands was one of the last European countries to eventually be liberated by the Allies on 5 May 1945.

===Bombing in Romania===
The first airstrikes against Romania occurred after Romania joined the Third Reich in June 1941 during their invasion of the Soviet Union. In the following two months, Soviet Air Forces conducted several attacks against the King Carol I Bridge, destroying one of its spans and damaging an oil pipeline. However, after the successful Axis powers Crimean Campaign and overall deterioration of the Soviet position, Soviet attacks against Romania ceased.

The USAAF first dropped bombs on Romania on 12 June 1942 during the HALPRO (Halverson project) raid against Ploiești (the first U.S. mission against a European target). Thirteen B-24 Liberator heavy bombers under the command of Col. Harry A. Halverson from Fayid, Egypt dropped eight bombs into the Black Sea, two onto Constanța, six onto Ploiești, six onto Teișani, and several onto Ciofliceni. In all, three people were killed and damage was minor. The bombing of Ploiești on 1 August 1943 (Operation Tidal Wave) was a far more serious affair. &quot;Tidal Wave&quot; heavily damaged four refineries and more lightly affected three; it damaged the Ploiești rail station but did not have much impact on the city itself. Câmpina was more severely damaged. 660 American aircrew were killed or captured, while petroleum exports exceeded pre-Tidal Wave levels by October. Around 100 civilians were killed and 200 wounded as a result of Operation Tidal Wave.

Anglo-American bombers first attacked Bucharest on 4 April 1944, aiming mainly to interrupt military transports from Romania to the Eastern Front and oil transports to Germany. Bucharest stored and distributed much of Ploiești&#x27;s refined oil products. The bombing campaign of Bucharest continued until August 1944, after which Romania joined the Allies following a coup by King Michael I against Ion Antonescu. The operations against Bucharest resulted in destroying thousands of buildings and killing or injuring over 9,000 people. In all, the bombardments killed some 7,693 civilians and wounded another 7,809.

After the 23 August 1944 coup, the Luftwaffe began bombing Bucharest in the attempt to remove the King and Government from power. The raids lasted from 24 to 26 August and killed or wounded over 300 civilians and damaged many buildings.

===Bombing in Italy===

Italy, first as an Axis member and later as a German-occupied country, was heavily bombed by Allied forces for all the duration of the war. In Northern Italy, after small-scale bombings which mainly targeted factories, only causing little damage and casualties, RAF Bomber Command launched a first large-scale area bombing campaign on Milan, Turin and Genoa (the so-called &#x27;industrial triangle&#x27;) during the autumn of 1942. All three cities suffered heavy damage and hundreds of civilian casualties, although the effects were less disastrous than those suffered by German cities, mainly because Italian cities had centres made of brick and stone buildings, while German cities had centers made of wooden buildings. Milan and Turin were bombed again in February 1943; the heaviest raids were carried out in July (295 bombers dropped 763 tons of bombs on Turin, killing 792 people) and August (all three cities were bombed and a total of 843 bombers dropped 2,268 tons of bombs over Milan, causing about 900 casualties). These attacks caused widespread damage and prompted most of the cities&#x27; inhabitants to flee. The only other city in Italy to be subjected to area bombing was La Spezia, heavily bombed by the Bomber Command during April 1943, with slight casualties but massive damage (45% of the buildings were destroyed or heavily damaged, and just 25–30% remained undamaged).

During 1944 and 1945 Milan, Turin and Genoa were instead bombed by USAAF bombers, which mainly targeted factories and marshalling yards; nonetheless, imprecision in bombings caused further destruction of vast areas. By the end of the war, about 30–40% of the buildings in each of the three cities were destroyed, and both in Milan and Turin less than half of the city remained undamaged. 2,199 people were killed in Turin and over 2,200 in Milan. Several other cities in northern Italy suffered heavy damage and casualties due to USAAF bombings, usually aimed at factories and marshalling yards but often inaccurate; among them Bologna (2,481 casualties), Padua (about 2,000 casualties), Rimini (98% of the city was destroyed or damaged), Treviso (1,600 killed in the bombing of 7 April 1944, 80% of the city destroyed or damaged), Trieste (463 casualties on 10 June 1944), Vicenza (317 casualties on 18 November 1944).

In Southern Italy, after small-scale bombings by the RAF (more frequent than in the north), USAAF started its bombing campaign in December 1942. The bombings mostly targeted harbour facilities, marshalling yards, factories and airports, but the inaccuracy of the attacks caused extensive destruction and civilian casualties; among the cities hit the hardest were Naples (6,000 casualties), Messina (more than one third of the city was destroyed, and only 30% remained untouched), Reggio Calabria, Foggia (thousands of casualties), Cagliari (416 inhabitants were killed in the bombings of February 1943, 80% of the city was damaged or destroyed), Palermo, Catania and Trapani (70% of the buildings were damaged or destroyed).

Central Italy was left untouched for the first three years of war, but from 1943 onwards it was heavily bombed by USAAF, with heavy damage (usually due to inaccuracy in bombing) to a number of cities, including Livorno (57% of the city was destroyed or damaged, over 500 people were killed in June 1943), Civitavecchia, Grosseto, Terni (1,077 casualties), Pisa (1,738 casualties), Pescara (between 2,200 and 3,900 casualties), Ancona (1,182 casualties), Viterbo (1,017 casualties) and Isernia (about 500 casualties on 11 September 1943).
Rome was bombed on several occasions; the historic centre and the Vatican were spared, but the suburbs suffered heavy damage and between 3,000 and 5,000 casualties. Florence also suffered some bombings in the outskirts (215 people were killed on 25 September 1943), while the historical centre was not bombed. Venice proper was never bombed.

In Dalmatia, the Italian enclave of Zara suffered extensive bombing, which destroyed 60% of the city and killed about 1,000 of its 20,000 inhabitants, prompting most of the population to flee to mainland Italy (the town was later annexed to Yugoslavia).

Except for Rome, Venice, Florence, Urbino and Siena, damage to cultural heritage in Italy was widespread.

===Bombing in France===

German-occupied France contained a number of important targets that attracted the attention of the British, and later American bombing. In 1940, RAF Bomber Command launched attacks against German preparations for Operation Sealion, the proposed invasion of England, attacking Channel Ports in France and Belgium and sinking large numbers of barges that had been collected by the Germans for use in the invasion. France&#x27;s Atlantic ports were important bases for both German surface ships and submarines, while French industry was an important contributor to the German war effort.

Before 1944, the Allies bombed targets in France that were part of the German war industry. This included raids such as those on the Renault factory in Boulogne-Billancourt in March 1942 or the port facilities of Nantes in September 1943 (which killed 1,500 civilians). In preparation of Allied landings in Normandy and those in the south of France, French infrastructure (mainly rail transport) was intensively targeted by RAF and USAAF in May and June 1944. Despite intelligence provided by the French Resistance, many residential areas were hit in error or lack of accuracy. This included cities like Marseille (2,000 dead), Lyon (1,000 dead), Saint-Étienne, Rouen, Orléans, Grenoble, Nice, Paris and surrounds (1000+ dead), and so on. The Free French Air Force, operational since 1941, used to opt for the more risky skimming tactic when operating in national territory, to avoid civilian casualties. On 5 January 1945, British bombers struck the &quot;Atlantic pocket&quot; of Royan and destroyed 85% of this city. A later raid, using napalm was carried out before it was freed from Nazi occupation in April. Of the 3,000 civilians left in the city, 442 died.

French civilian casualties due to Allied strategic bombing are estimated at half of the 67,000 French civilian dead during Allied operations in 1942–1945; the other part being mostly killed during tactical bombing in the Normandy campaign. 22% of the bombs dropped in Europe by British and American air forces between 1940 and 1945 were in France. The port city of Le Havre had been destroyed by 132 bombings during the war (5,000 dead) until September 1944. It has been rebuilt by architect Auguste Perret and is now a World Heritage Site.

===Soviet strategic bombing===

The first Soviet offensive bomber campaign was directed against the Romanian oilfields in the summer of 1941. In response to a German raid on Moscow on the night of 21–22 July 1941, Soviet Naval Aviation launched a series of seven raids against Germany, primarily Berlin, between the night of 7–8 August and 3–4 September. These attacks were undertaken by between four and fifteen aircraft—beginning on 11 August the new Tupolev TB-7—from the island of Saaremaa, base of the 1st Torpedo Air Regiment. (At least one raid of the 81st Air Division took off from Pushkin Airport.) Besides thirty tonnes of bombs, they also dropped leaflets with Joseph Stalin&#x27;s defiant speech of 3 July. The Soviets sent a total of 549 long-range bombers over German territory in all of 1941.

In March 1942 the strategic bombing arm of the Soviet Union was reorganized as the Long Range Air Force (ADD). It raided Berlin from 26 to 29 August and again on the night of 9–10 September with 212 planes. It raided Helsinki for the first time on 24 August, Budapest on 4–5 and 9–10 September and Bucharest on 13–14 September. The German-occupied Polish cities of Kraków and Warsaw were not exempt, but the bombers concentrated primarily on military targets. There were 1,114 sorties over Germany in 1942. In March 1943 there was a strategic shift: in preparation for the Kursk Offensive, the bombers were directed against the German railroads behind the front. In April the Long Range Air Force expanded to eight air corps and eleven independent divisions containing 700 planes. After the Kursk preparations, the Soviets turned their attention to administrative and industrial targets in East Prussia in April. With 920 aircraft taking part, they dropped 700 tonnes of bombs there. The largest Soviet bomb of the war, an 11,000-pound weapon, was dropped on Königsberg during one of these raids.

Throughout 1943, the Soviets attempted to give the impression of cooperation between their bombers and those of the West. In February 1944, they again shifted priority with the goal of knocking Finland and Hungary out of the war. Helsinki was struck by 733 bombers on the night of 6–7 February, by 367 on the 15–16th and 850 on the 25–26th. A total of 2,386 tonnes of bombs were dropped. Budapest was hit four straight nights from 13 to 20 September with a total of 8,000 tonnes by 1,129 bombers. The Soviets flew 4,466 sorties into enemy territory in the year 1944. In December the Long Range Air Force was reorganized as the 18th Air Army.

The main task of the 18th Air Army was to support the final offensive against Germany, but it also undertook raids against Berlin, Breslau, Danzig and Königsberg. In total, 7,158 Soviet aircraft dropped 6,700 tonnes of bombs on Germany during the war, 3.1% of Soviet bomber sorties, 0.5% of all Allied &quot;strategic&quot; sorties against German-occupied territory and 0.2% of all bombs dropped on it.

After the war, Marxist historians in the Soviet Union and East Germany claimed that the Soviet strategic bombing campaign was limited by moral qualms over bombing civilian centres. One early bombing theorist, Vasili Chripin, whose theories influenced the Soviet Union&#x27;s first strategic bombing guidelines (1936) and the service regulations of 26 January 1940, drew back from terror bombing as advocated by Western theorists. The Spanish Civil War also convinced Soviet war planners that the air force was most effective when used in close cooperation with ground forces. Nonetheless, after the war, Marshal Vasili Sokolovsky admitted that the Soviets would have gladly launched a strategic bombing offensive had they the capability. In reality, the Soviets never geared aircraft production towards long-range bombers, beyond the small force of indigenously designed and produced Petlyakov Pe-8 four-engined &quot;heavies&quot;, and so never had enough to mount an effective campaign. The land-based nature of warfare on the Eastern Front also required closer cooperation between the air forces and ground troops than did, for example, the defence of Great Britain.

===Effectiveness of Allied Strategic Bombing===
Strategic bombing has been criticized on practical grounds because it does not work predictably. The radical changes it forces on a targeted population can backfire, including the counterproductive result of freeing non-essential labourers to fill worker shortages in war industries.

Much of the doubt about the effectiveness of the bomber war comes from the fact that German industrial production increased throughout the war. A combination of factors helped increase German war material output, these included; continuing development from production lines started before the war, limiting competing models of equipment, government enforced sharing of production techniques, a change in how contracts were priced and an aggressive worker suggestion program. At the same time production plants had to deal with a loss of experienced workers to the military, assimilating untrained workers, culling workers incapable of being trained, and utilizing unwilling forced labor. Strategic bombing failed to reduce German war production. There is insufficient information to ascertain how much additional potential industrial growth the bombing campaign may have curtailed. However, attacks on the infrastructure were taking place. The attacks on Germany&#x27;s canals and railroads made transportation of materiel difficult.

The Oil Campaign of World War II was, however, extremely successful and made a very large contribution to the general collapse of Germany in 1945. In the event, the bombing of oil facilities became Albert Speer&#x27;s main concern; however, this occurred sufficiently late in the war that Germany would soon be defeated in any case.

German insiders credit the Allied bombing offensive with crippling the German war industry. Speer repeatedly said both during and after the war that it caused crucial production problems. Admiral Karl Dönitz, head of the U-boat fleet (&quot;U-waffe&quot;), noted in his memoirs the failure to get the Type XXI U-boats into service was entirely the result of the air campaign. According to the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (Europe), despite bombing becoming a major effort, between December 1942 and June 1943, &quot;The attack on the construction yards and slipways was not heavy enough to be more than troublesome&quot; and the delays in delivery of Type XXIs and XXIIIs up until November 1944 &quot;cannot be attributed to the air attack&quot;, however, &quot;The attacks during the late winter and early spring of 1945 did close, or all but close, five of the major yards, including the great Blohm and Voss plant at Hamburg&quot;.

Adam Tooze contends that many of the sources on bombing effectiveness are &quot;highly self-critical after-the-battle analyses&quot; by the former Western Allies. In his book &quot;The Wages of Destruction&quot;, he makes the case that the bombing was effective. Richard Overy argues that the bombing campaign absorbed a significant proportion of German resources that could have been used on the Eastern Front; according to Overy, in 1943 and 1944, two-thirds of German fighters were being used to fend off bomber attacks, which Overy argues was a significant hindrance for the Luftwaffe as it prevented them from conducting bombing operations against the Soviets even though such an air campaign had caused considerable damage to the Soviets early in the war. Overy also reports that by the end of 1943, 75% of Flak 88mm guns were being used in air defence, preventing them from being used for anti-tank work on the Eastern Front despite their effectiveness in such a role. Overy also estimates that Britain spent about 7% of her war effort on bombing, which he concludes was not a waste of resources.

===Effect on morale===

Although designed to &quot;break the enemy&#x27;s will&quot;, the opposite often happened. The British did not crumble under the German Blitz and other air raids early in the war. British workers continued to work throughout the war and food and other basic supplies were available throughout.

The impact of bombing on German morale was significant according to Professor John Buckley. Around a third of the urban population under threat of bombing had no protection at all. Some of the major cities saw 55–60 percent of dwellings destroyed. Mass evacuations were a partial answer for six million civilians, but this had a severe effect on morale as German families were split up to live in difficult conditions. By 1944, absenteeism rates of 20–25 percent were not unusual and in post-war analysis 91 percent of civilians stated bombing was the most difficult hardship to endure and was the key factor in the collapse of their own morale. The United States Strategic Bombing Survey concluded that the bombing was not stiffening morale but seriously depressing it; fatalism, apathy, defeatism were apparent in bombed areas. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was blamed for not warding off the attacks and confidence in the Nazi regime fell by 14 percent. By the spring of 1944, some 75 percent of Germans believed the war was lost, owing to the intensity of the bombing.

Buckley argues the German war economy did indeed expand significantly following Albert Speer&#x27;s appointment as Reichsminister of Armaments, &quot;but it is spurious to argue that because production increased then bombing had no real impact&quot;. The bombing offensive did do serious damage to German production levels. German tank and aircraft production, though reached new records in production levels in 1944, was in particular one-third lower than planned. In fact, German aircraft production for 1945 was planned at 80,000, showing Erhard Milch and other leading German planners were pushing for even higher outputs; &quot;unhindered by Allied bombing German production would have risen far higher&quot;.

Journalist Max Hastings and the authors of the official history of the bomber offensive, Noble Frankland among them, has argued bombing had a limited effect on morale. In the words of the British Bombing Survey Unit (BBSU), &quot;The essential premise behind the policy of treating towns as unit targets for area attack, namely that the German economic system was fully extended, was false.&quot; This, the BBSU noted, was because official estimates of German war production were &quot;more than 100 percent in excess of the true figures&quot;. The BBSU concluded, &quot;Far from there being any evidence of a cumulative effect on (German) war production, it is evident that, as the (bombing) offensive progressed ... the effect on war production became progressively smaller (and) did not reach significant dimensions.&quot;

===Allied bombing statistics 1939–1945===
According to the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, Allied bombers between 1939 and 1945 dropped 1,415,745 tons of bombs over Germany (51.1% of the total bomb tonnage dropped by Allied bombers in the European campaign), 570,730 tons over France (20.6%), 379,565 tons over Italy (13.7%), 185,625 tons over Austria, Hungary and the Balkans (6.7%), and 218,873 tons over other countries (7.9%).

===Casualties===

After the war, the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey reviewed the available casualty records in Germany and concluded that official German statistics of casualties from air attack had been too low. The survey estimated that at a minimum 305,000 were killed in German cities due to bombing and estimated a minimum of 780,000 wounded. Roughly 7,500,000 German civilians were also rendered homeless. Overy estimated in 2014 that in all about 353,000 civilians were killed by Allies bombing raids against German cities. In addition to the minimum figure given in the Strategic bombing survey, the number of people killed by Allied bombing in Germany has been estimated at between 400,000 and 600,000. In the United Kingdom, 60,595 Britons were killed by German bombing, and in France, 67,078 French people were killed by Allied bombing raids.

Belgrade was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe on 6 April 1941, when more than 17,000 people were killed. According to &quot;The Oxford companion to World War II&quot;, &quot;After Italy&#x27;s surrender the Allies kept up the bombing of the northern part occupied by the Germans and more than 50,000 Italians were killed in these raids.&quot; An Istat study of 1957 stated that 64,354 Italians were killed by aerial bombing, 59,796 of whom were civilians. Historians Marco Gioannini and Giulio Massobrio argued in 2007 that this figure is inaccurate due to loss of documents, confusion and gaps, and estimated the total number of civilian casualties in Italy due to aerial bombing as comprised between 80,000 and 100,000. Over 160,000 Allied airmen and 33,700 planes were lost in the European theatre.

==Asia==

Within Asia, the majority of strategic bombing was carried out by the Japanese and the US. The British Commonwealth planned that once the war in Europe was complete, a strategic bombing force of up to 1,000 heavy bombers (&quot;Tiger Force&quot;) would be sent to the Far East. This was never realised before the end of the Pacific War.

===Japanese bombing===
Japanese strategic bombing was independently conducted by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service and the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service. The first large-scale bombing raid, carried out over Shanghai on 28 January 1932, has been called &quot;the first terror bombing of a civilian population of an era that was to become familiar with it&quot;. Bombing efforts mostly targeted large Chinese cities such as Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chongqing, with around 5,000 raids from February 1938 to August 1943 in the latter case.

The bombing of Nanjing and Canton, which began on 22 and 23 September 1937, called forth widespread protests culminating in a resolution by the Far Eastern Advisory Committee of the League of Nations. Lord Cranborne, the British Under-Secretary of State For Foreign Affairs, expressed his indignation in his own declaration.
The Imperial Japanese Navy also carried out a carrier-based airstrike on the armed neutralitarian United States at Pearl Harbor and Oahu on 7 December 1941, resulting in almost 2,500 fatalities and plunging America into World War II the next day. There were also air raids on the Philippines, Burma, Singapore, Ceylon, and northern Australia (Bombing of Darwin, 19 February 1942).

===Italian bombing===
In 1940 and 1941, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;, seeking to disrupt Allied oil supplies, struck British targets in the Middle East, mainly using the CANT Z.1007 and Savoia-Marchetti SM.82 bombers. For a year starting in June 1940, Italian bombers attacked Mandatory Palestine, mainly targeting Haifa and Tel Aviv for their large refineries and port facilities. The deadliest single attack came on 9 September 1940, when an Italian raid over Tel Aviv killed 137 people. While Italian efforts mainly focused on the Mandate of Palestine, one notable mission on 19 October 1940 struck instead at refinery facilities in Bahrain.

===Allied bombing of South-East Asia===

After the Japanese invasion of Thailand (8 December 1941), the southeast Asian kingdom signed a treaty of alliance with Japan and declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom. The Allies dropped 18,583 bombs on Thailand during the war, resulting in the death of 8,711 people and the destruction of 9,616 buildings. The primary target of the campaign was Bangkok, the Thai capital. Rural areas were almost entirely unaffected.

In August 1942, the United States Fourteenth Air Force based in southern China undertook the first air raids in French Indochina. The American bombing campaign gained intensity after the surrender of Germany in May 1945, and by July Japanese defences were incapable of impeding their movement. The Americans had attained complete air supremacy. After the victory over Japan, on 19 August the denizens of Hanoi broke into the streets and removed the black coverings off the street lamps.

In 1944–45, the Eastern Fleet of the Royal Navy undertook several raids on the occupied Netherlands East Indies. They also bombed the Japanese-occupied Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

===U.S. bombing of Japan===

The United States began effective strategic bombing of Japan in late 1944, when B-29s began operating from Guam and Tinian in the Marianas Islands. Before that, U.S. forces had mounted a single raid from an aircraft carrier in 1942, and ineffective long-range raids from China from June to December 1944. In the last seven months of the campaign, a change to firebombing resulted in great destruction of 67 Japanese cities, as many as 500,000 Japanese deaths and some 5 million more made homeless. Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s viewing of the destroyed areas of Tokyo in March 1945 is said to have been the beginning of his personal involvement in the peace process, culminating in Japan&#x27;s surrender five months later.

====Conventional bombing====
The first U.S. raid on the Japanese main island was the Doolittle Raid of 18 April 1942, when sixteen B-25 Mitchells were launched from the to attack targets including Yokohama and Tokyo and then fly on to airfields in China. The raid was a military pinprick but a significant propaganda victory. Because they were launched prematurely, none of the aircraft had enough fuel to reach their designated landing sites, and so either crashed or ditched (except for one aircraft, which landed in the Soviet Union, where the crew was interned). Two crews were captured by the Japanese.

The key development for the bombing of Japan was the B-29 Superfortress, which had an operational range of 1,500 miles (2,400 km); almost 90% of the bombs (147,000 tons) dropped on the home islands of Japan were delivered by this bomber. The first raid by B-29s on Japan was on 15 June 1944, from China. The B-29s took off from Chengdu, over 1,500 miles away. This raid was also not particularly effective: only forty-seven of the sixty-eight bombers hit the target area.

Raids of Japan from mainland China, called Operation Matterhorn, were carried out by the Twentieth Air Force under XX Bomber Command. Initially the commanding officer of the Twentieth Air Force was Hap Arnold, and later Curtis LeMay. Bombing Japan from China was never a satisfactory arrangement because not only were the Chinese airbases difficult to supply—materiel being sent by air from India over &quot;the Hump&quot;—but the B-29s operating from them could only reach Japan if they traded some of their bomb load for extra fuel in tanks in the bomb-bays. When Admiral Chester Nimitz&#x27;s island-hopping campaign captured Pacific islands close enough to Japan to be within the B-29&#x27;s range, the Twentieth Air Force was assigned to XXI Bomber Command, which organized a much more effective bombing campaign of the Japanese home islands. Based in the Marianas (Guam and Tinian in particular), the B-29s were able to carry their full bomb loads and were supplied by cargo ships and tankers. The first raid from the Mariana was on 24 November 1944, when 88 aircraft bombed Tokyo. The bombs were dropped from around 30,000 feet (10,000 m) and it is estimated that only around 10% hit their targets.
Unlike all other forces in theater, the USAAF Bomber Commands did not report to the commanders of the theaters but directly to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In July 1945, they were placed under the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific, which was commanded by Carl Spaatz.

As in Europe, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) tried daylight precision bombing. However, it proved to be impossible due to the weather around Japan, &quot;during the best month for bombing in Japan, visual bombing was possible for [just] seven days. The worst had only one good day.&quot; Further, bombs dropped from a great height were tossed about by high winds.

General LeMay, commander of XXI Bomber Command, instead switched to mass firebombing night attacks from altitudes of around 7,000 feet (2,100 m) on the major conurbations. &quot;He looked up the size of the large Japanese cities in the &quot;World Almanac&quot; and picked his targets accordingly.&quot; Priority targets were Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe. Despite limited early success, particularly against Nagoya, LeMay was determined to use such bombing tactics against the vulnerable Japanese cities. Attacks on strategic targets also continued in lower-level daylight raids.

The first successful firebombing raid was on Kobe on 3 February 1945, and following its relative success the USAAF continued the tactic. Nearly half of the principal factories of the city were damaged, and production was reduced by more than half at one of the port&#x27;s two shipyards.

The first raid of this type on Tokyo was on the night of 23–24 February when 174 B-29s destroyed around one square mile (3 km2) of the city. Following on that success, as Operation Meetinghouse, 334 B-29s raided on the night of 9–10 March, of which 282 Superforts reached their targets, dropping around 1,700 tons of bombs. Around 16 square miles (41 km2) of the city was destroyed and over 100,000 people are estimated to have died in the fire storm. It was the most destructive conventional raid, and the deadliest single bombing raid of any kind in terms of lives lost, in all of military aviation history, even when the missions on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are taken as single events. The city was made primarily of wood and paper, and the fires burned out of control. The effects of the Tokyo firebombing proved the fears expressed by Admiral Yamamoto in 1939: &quot;Japanese cities, being made of wood and paper, would burn very easily. The Army talks big, but if war came and there were large-scale air raids, there&#x27;s no telling what would happen.&quot;

In the following two weeks, there were almost 1,600 further sorties against the four cities, destroying 31 square miles (80 km2) in total at a cost of 22 aircraft. By June, over forty percent of the urban area of Japan&#x27;s largest six cities (Tokyo, Nagoya, Kobe, Osaka, Yokohama, and Kawasaki) was devastated. LeMay&#x27;s fleet of nearly 600 bombers destroyed tens of smaller cities and manufacturing centres in the following weeks and months.

Leaflets were dropped over cities before they were bombed, warning the inhabitants and urging them to escape the city. Though many, even within the Air Force, viewed this as a form of psychological warfare, a significant element in the decision to produce and drop them was the desire to assuage American anxieties about the extent of the destruction created by this new war tactic. Warning leaflets were also dropped on cities not in fact targeted, to create uncertainty and absenteeism.

A year after the war, the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey reported that American military officials had underestimated the power of strategic bombing combined with naval blockade and previous military defeats to bring Japan to unconditional surrender without invasion. By July 1945, only a fraction of the planned strategic bombing force had been deployed yet there were few targets left worth the effort. In hindsight, it would have been more effective to use land-based and carrier-based air power to strike merchant shipping and begin aerial mining at a much earlier date so as to link up with effective submarine anti-shipping campaign and completely isolate the island nation. This would have accelerated the strangulation of Japan and perhaps ended the war sooner. A postwar Naval Ordnance Laboratory survey agreed, finding naval mines dropped by B-29s had accounted for 60% of all Japanese shipping losses in the last six months of the war. In October 1945, Prince Fumimaro Konoe said the sinking of Japanese vessels by U.S. aircraft combined with the B-29 aerial mining campaign were just as effective as B-29 attacks on industry alone, though he admitted, &quot;the thing that brought about the determination to make peace was the prolonged bombing by the B-29s.&quot; Prime Minister Baron Kantarō Suzuki reported to U.S. military authorities it &quot;seemed to me unavoidable that in the long run Japan would be almost destroyed by air attack so that merely on the basis of the B-29s alone I was convinced that Japan should sue for peace.&quot;

====Nuclear bombings====
While the bombing campaign against Japan continued, the U.S. and its allies were preparing to invade the Japanese home islands, which they anticipated to be heavily costly in terms of life and property. On 1 April 1945, U.S. troops invaded the island of Okinawa and fought there fiercely against not only enemy soldiers, but also enemy civilians. After two and a half months, 12,000 U.S. servicemen, 107,000 Japanese soldiers, and over 150,000 Okinawan civilians (included those forced to fight) were killed. Given the casualty rate in Okinawa, American commanders realized a grisly picture of the intended invasion of mainland Japan. When President Harry S. Truman was briefed on what would happen during an invasion of Japan, he could not afford such a horrendous casualty rate, added to over 400,000 U.S. servicemen who had already died fighting in both the European and Pacific theaters of the war.

Hoping to forestall the invasion, the United States, the United Kingdom, and China issued a Potsdam Declaration on 26 July 1945, demanding that the Japanese government accept an unconditional surrender. The declaration also stated that if Japan did not surrender, it would be faced with &quot;prompt and utter destruction&quot;, a process which was already underway with the incendiary bombing raids destroying 40% of targeted cities, and by naval warfare isolating and starving Japan of imported food. The Japanese government ignored (&quot;mokusatsu&quot;) this ultimatum, thus signalling that they were not going to surrender.

In the wake of this rejection, Stimson and George Marshall (the Army chief of staff) and Hap Arnold (head of the Army Air Forces) set the atomic bombing in motion.

On 6 August 1945, the B-29 bomber Enola Gay flew over the Japanese city of Hiroshima in southwest Honshū and dropped a gun-type uranium-235 atomic bomb (code-named Little Boy by the U.S.) on it. Two other B-29 aircraft were airborne nearby for the purposes of instrumentation and photography. When the planes first approached Hiroshima, Japanese anti-aircraft units in the city initially thought they were reconnaissance aircraft, since they were ordered not to shoot at one or few aircraft that did not pose a threat, in order to conserve their ammunition for large-scale air raids. The bomb killed roughly 90,000–166,000 people; half of these died quickly while the other half suffered lingering deaths. The death toll included an estimated 20,000 Korean slave laborers and 20,000 Japanese soldiers and destroyed 48,000 buildings (including the headquarters of the Second General Army and Fifth Division). On 9 August, three days later, the B-29 Bockscar flew over the Japanese city of Nagasaki in northwest Kyushu and dropped an implosion-type, plutonium-239 atomic bomb (code-named Fat Man by the U.S.) on it, again accompanied by two other B-29 aircraft for instrumentation and photography. This bomb&#x27;s effects killed roughly 39,000–80,000 people, including roughly 23,000–28,000 Japanese war industry employees, an estimated 2,000 Korean forced workers, and at least 150 Japanese soldiers. The bomb destroyed 60% of the city. The industrial damage in Nagasaki was high, partly owing to the inadvertent targeting of the industrial zone, leaving 68–80% of the non-dock industrial production destroyed.

Six days after the detonation over Nagasaki, Hirohito announced Japan&#x27;s surrender to the Allies on 15 August 1945, signing the Instrument of Surrender on 2 September 1945, officially ending the Pacific War and World War II. The two atomic bombings generated strong sentiments in Japan against all nuclear weapons. Japan adopted the Three Non-Nuclear Principles, which forbade the nation from developing nuclear armaments. Across the world anti-nuclear activists have made Hiroshima the central symbol of what they are opposing.

<text>42 Isis is a large main-belt asteroid, measuring 100.2 km in diameter with a stony (S-type) composition. It was discovered by English astronomer N.R. Pogson on 23 May 1856 at Oxford, and was his first asteroid discovery. The asteroid&#x27;s name was chosen by Manuel John Johnson, director of the Radcliffe Observatory in Oxford. Although Isis is the name of an Egyptian goddess, the name was chosen in homage to Pogson&#x27;s astronomer daughter, (Elizabeth) Isis Pogson. In addition, the Isis is the stretch of the River Thames that runs through Oxford.

This asteroid is orbiting the Sun with a period of 3.82 years. The light curve inversion technique, when applied to photometric observations of this asteroid, show multiple local irregularities. The overall shape displays little elongation, with a ratio between the major and minor axes equal to 1.1. The measured rotation period for this model is 13.6 hours. The spectrum of 42 Isis reveals the strong presence of the mineral olivine, a relative rarity in the asteroid belt.

<text>Colin Archer (22 July 1832 – 8 February 1921) was a Norwegian naval architect and shipbuilder known for his seaworthy pilot and rescue boats and the larger sailing and polar ships. His most famous ship is the &quot;Fram&quot;, used for both Fridtjof Nansen&#x27;s and Roald Amundsen&#x27;s polar expeditions. 

He was born at Tollerodden in Larvik, Norway, where he also had his own house built and his boatyard. 

== Early life ==
Colin Archer was born in Larvik in southern Norway as the 12th of 13 children to parents who immigrated to Norway from Scotland in 1825. Before his career in naval architecture, he spent time as a farmer and administrator in Queensland, Australia with several of his brothers, including David who first arrived in Sydney in 1834. During his time as an administrator he was contracted to produce a map of the Fitzroy River. Their settlement is now known as Gracemere Homestead.

In 1861, Archer returned to Larvik and undertook the study of practical and theoretical shipbuilding. He married Karen Sophie Wiborg in 1869 with whom he had five children. 

==Career==
Archer designed his vessels in the workroom of his residence at Tollerodden. Before he started building sailboats, he studied the work of Fredrik Henrik af Chapman and especially his displacement curve. He also studied John Scott Russell&#x27;s theories. His first boats were designed with a combination of Chapman&#x27;s displacement parabola curve and Scott Russell&#x27;s positioning of midship section (defined as section with widest beam) that was well aft of amidships and with sharp bow waterlines. Based on this, Archer started to reform the pilot boat design in 1872.

In 1892 several of his pilot-boats rescued fishing boats in a severe off shore gale on the southeast coast of Norway, and after a design competition, he received an order to design a rescue boat for the Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue (Norsk Selskab til Skibbrudnes Redning). This 47-foot boat proved so seaworthy that 33 were built, giving Archer and his shipyard a reputation for durable and safe ships.

After the pilot boat had shown its seaworthiness, all other boat builders started to copy Archer&#x27;s lines and building method. The boats became referred to as a &quot;Colin Archer&quot; or &quot;Colin Archer-type&quot; no matter who designed or built them.

In a career that lasted until he ended his business at the age of 78, Archer built about 200 boats, 120 with ballast keels. His designs were also built at other yards, totaling about 50 during his lifetime. Archer built about 120 double-enders, but thousands have since been built worldwide. Boats are still (2017) being built and labelled &quot;Colin Archer-type&quot;. 35 of his boats are still sailing. 

Archer also became famous for his ships, especially the polar ship &quot;Fram&quot;. 

== Naval architect with ship yard ==

In 1872 Archer wanted to share his knowledge of ship and boat design. He published a 29-page design lecture that included Fredrik Henrik af Chapman&#x27;s and John Scott Russell&#x27;s theories. This was also good advertising for him that soon gave him orders.

Based on his belief in 1873 that shipbuilding is more lucrative than building boats, in 1874, Archer and investors founded the shipyard &quot;Laurvig Strandværft&quot; in Rekkevik in the Larvik fjord. At its start, Archer was a 30% owner of the shipyard. Rekkevik lies 3 km from the inner harbour of Larvik where his boatyard was situated at Tollerodden. One of the part owners of the shipyard was a ship owner and ordered the first ship. In 1886 Archer became sole owner of the shipyard.

=== Sailing ships ===
Laurvig Strandværft built four ships to Archer&#x27;s designs:

* 1875: schooner &quot;Aries&quot;, 86 feet
* 1880: brigantine &quot;Leon&quot;, 108 feet
* 1892: polar ship &quot;Fram&quot;, 140 feet
* 1900: auxiliary steam yacht &quot;Ingeborg&quot;, 94 feet

Archer also designed several three-masted barques 135–155 feet that were used for building seven sailing ships in Arendal 1875-1886 and one in Grimstad in 1887, both towns on the south coast. Archer&#x27;s shipyard also performed repair work and especially conversion and outfitting for polar expeditions.

=== The brigantine &quot;Leon;&quot; ship and model boat ===

&quot;Leon&quot; was built 1878–1880 for Herlofson brothers in Arendal. The Herlofsons were a sailing and ship owning family, and &quot;Leon&quot; remained in the family&#x27;s ownership until 1894. &quot;Leon&quot; then changed hands several times among various Norwegian owners. &quot;Leon&quot; was always rigged as a brigantine, but in Norway this rig is termed &quot;Skonnertbrigg&quot; and most often abbreviated to schooner, which has caused authors to believe the boat was re-rigged, but it was not. During late autumn of 1915 it developed a serious leak while on a voyage in the North Sea from Granton to Porsgrunn with coal, and was abandoned.

The plans for &quot;Leon&quot; were reproduced by Harold A. Underhill in 1958 in his book &quot;Plank-On-Frame Models and Scale Masting and Rigging, vol. I.&quot; Many models of &quot;Leon&quot; exist around the world, including one at Royal Museums Greenwich.

=== Polar ships ===

The most notable single ship built by Colin Archer was the &quot;Fram&quot;, used by Fridtjof Nansen in his expedition attempt to the North Pole 1893-96 and by Roald Amundsen&#x27;s 1911 historic expedition as the first to the South Pole. &quot;Fram&quot; is now preserved in the Fram Museum on Bygdøy, Oslo, Norway.

In 1886 the 3-masted bark &quot;Pollux&quot; seal and whaling ship was built to Colin Archer&#x27;s design in Arendal. In 1897 it was bought by Carsten Borchgrevink, taken to Archer&#x27;s yard, and fitted out for polar expeditions. Renamed &quot;Southern Cross&quot; it was sailed to Antarctica during 1898-1900 (the Southern Cross Expedition), where Borchgrevink made important discoveries and was the first man to step on land on the mainland of Antarctica. Information from this expedition was later used by Roald Amundsen for his expedition to the South Pole.

In 1898 the Italian prince and explorer Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi wanted to do polar expeditions. He travelled to Norway and consulted the famous polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen. In 1899 Amedo bought the former whaling vessel &quot;Jason,&quot; renamed it &quot;Stella Polare&quot; and took it to Colin Archer&#x27;s shipyard. The interior was stripped out and new beams, diagonals and knees heavily strengthened the ship. Amedo set off in June 1899 and &quot;Stella Polare&quot; had a difficult time but survived thanks to Archer&#x27;s work.

In 1899, Archer also fitted &quot;Zarya&quot; for the Russian polar expedition of 1900–02. &quot;Zarya&quot; was strengthened with internal frames and beams, and deckhouses were added. The rig was changed to barkentine (square sail on foremast only). In October 1899 the ship was certified by Norwegian authorities for a three-year expedition in the Arctic.

== Pilot boat reformator ==
Archer&#x27;s first pilot-boat, 33 feet in length, was built in 1872. Influenced by Scott Russell&#x27;s theories, it had the midship section 58% from the forward perpendicular as opposed to the traditional position of 44%. The traditional boats were thus of the old blunt &quot;Cod&#x27;s Head-Mackerel Tail&quot;-type. They were also beamy and shallow with poor windward abilities.

Archer also made his boats deeper with more ballast, built strongly with oak and they soon became known for seaworthiness and speed. Thus he started revolutionizing the Norwegian double-ended pilot-boats from his first boat.

The next and biggest pilot-boat improvement came in 1882, when he introduced the ballast keel and carvel building as before used on his yachts. With the improved stability generated by the ballast keel, Archer reduced the beam to 33% as opposed to the traditional 38-40%. The 36-foot boats were outstanding in performance and resisted capsizing.

In 1886 his pilot-boats outclassed all others in a pilot race with 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 7th place of 12 participants. After that, he was made a Knight of the Order of St. Olav.

== Rescue boats ==
After an off shore gale in 1892 when several of Archer&#x27;s pilot boats rescued fishermen, it was thought that pilots should do the rescue operations. Three cutter-rigged Archer pilot boats were built; 38-, 41- and 42-foot length, fitted out as rescue boats and put into service in 1893 manned by pilots.

To try a bigger and more specialized rescue boat, a design competition was held in 1892 and Archer got the order. He based his design on his newest pilot-boat and scaled the lines to 46 feet and reduced the beam ratio to 33.5%. Freeboard height was increased with about 20 cm. The keel was widened so the ballast keel became considerably heavier at 6.5 tons. The inside ballast remained the same, 6-7 tons. Ceiling, 45 mm planking fitted inside the frames, were made watertight and thus the boat would float and be maneuverable in case of a leak or damage. The boat was rigged as ketch and launched July 1893 as the RS 1 COLIN ARCHER.In service, it was soon realized, that the rescue boats had to sail out with fishing fleets every day. As there were no weather forecasts and no distress signals, the rescue boats had to be at the scene if a storm arrived. As the wind increased, the smallest boats were towed to safety and returned to tow larger boats. The pilots could not be with the fishermen all day so the design chosen for new boats was the large ketch.

33 ketch-rigged rescue boats were built from 1893 to 1924. 28 of the ketches were Archer’s design and 13 were built by Archer. From 1909 – 1924 the last 13 ketches were built in the Risør area (35 n.m. SW of Larvik). Only one rescue boat was lost at sea without a trace.

Archer made two new plans for rescue boats. The Mk II was built in 1897 has more overhang in the bow profile and thus more flare in the bow sections and a slightly fuller waterline in the bow. Length over deck became 47 feet and the boat had more stability for towing. Mk. III was built in 1908 with 20 cm more beam (34.4%) and a considerably fuller bow, but a finer stern. All versions have the midship section approx. 53% from the forward perpendicular. Mk. III’s lines are more symmetrically shaped than Archer normally used. The Mk. III rescue boat was considered the best boat in strong winds and most towing abilities.

Framing is kept relatively light with frame spacing 60–66 cm c-c with a thin stem bent oak rib in between. Planking was 38 mm oak and the inside of the frames was also planked (ceiling) with 50 mm pine. This was caulked watertight to the watertight cabin sole (floor) and thus, and floated when the planking got a leak.

To minimize pitching to give the boats an easier motion and keep the deck dry, the ballast was concentrated midships, and anchor windlass and chain placed aft of the mast.

The rig was ketch (two mast) with a relatively short mast and very small mizzen. In a strong wind, they normally sailed with main and staysail only, often reefed. With boats in tow, the mizzen was used to point higher to the wind and help to tack. The rig was basically the same for all boats, but the spars became heavier for each upgrade.

The last sailing rescue boat was built in 1924. Next generation boats, the Bjarne Aas design with an engine but also full rig was built in 1932. A dozen of Archer&#x27;s design served without an engine until 1940. With engine installed, they served until 1960.

== Yachts ==

Colin Archer built about 60 yachts, each to a unique drawing, half being double-enders and the other half with counter sterns. Many of both double-enders and the counter stern yachts have plum stems. All yachts have more undercut forefoot than the workboats, especially after 1897.

The beam is 22-30% of the length over the deck. (As opposed to 33-36% for the pilot-boats and the rescue boats).

All yachts, except the &quot;Asgard&quot;, and all pilot-boats, are cutter rigged (one mast). The yachts have their main boom extending the stern for several feet that with a relatively tall mast enhanced performance. (The pilot-boats&#x27; boom normally extends the sternpost by one foot. Only the rescue boats and a few fishing boats, are ketch-rigged (two masts)). The sail area for the yachts is in the range 100-125% of waterline length squared.

On almost all boats, Archer spaced grown pine frames 2 feet c-c with a thin steam-bent oak rib between. This, together with thin, canvassed decks, made the yachts fairly light. The yachts have large ballast keels and normally no inside ballast, except a little for trim.

== Archer&#x27;s Wave Form Theory ==
Archer spent much time calculating how an efficient hull should be designed. He started with Chapman&#x27;s displacement parabola curve, but with Scott Russell&#x27;s positioning of the midship section well aft of amidships and thus with sharp bow waterlines.

In 1876 he changed Chapman&#x27;s parabola for the displacement curve, with Scott Russell&#x27;s wave curves; the sine curve forward and the trochoid curve aft. The change gave designers more freedom in shaping the hull than Scott Russell&#x27;s theory.

Archer&#x27;s theory did not change Colin Archer&#x27;s early lines much, more confirmed them. Archer&#x27;s theory gave fuller bow lines than Scott Russell&#x27;s, but unless the forefoot was well undercut, Archer&#x27;s bow lines also became too sharp with a tendency to make the boats &quot;pitchy&quot; and wet. With more undercut forefoot and the displacement curve extending the designed waterline, the lines became fuller and Archer&#x27;s boats became the seaworthy boats he is known for.

We know now that none of these theories are correct, but they did away with the excessively blunt bow of the old &quot;Cod&#x27;s Head-Mackerel Tail&quot;-type.

==Legacy==
Colin Archer sold several boats to Sweden during the early 1880s and Swedish designers soon adapted the Archer type for pilot-boats and yachts. Norwegian pilot- and fishing boat builders converted to the Archer type after the rescue boat had shown its seaworthiness in 1894.

Archer also had customers in Denmark, Germany, Holland and England. In 1904, he built a boat for the writer Erskine Childers named the &quot;Asgard&quot;. Childers had just written the novel &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot;; he was later shot by firing squad.

Outside Scandinavia, the rescue boat lines have been the most popular design. The &quot;Archer-type&quot; outside of Norway has more beam and smaller rig than Archer&#x27;s actual yachts.

In 1908 the 47 feet OEGER was designed by Archer but built in Porsgrunn. The customer was the English sailor Haig that had already sailed in north Norway and wanted to have a more seaworthy boat to go to Spitsbergen. The lines were narrower version (32% beam) of the Mk. III rescue boat. The rig, however, was cutter with large sail area. The boat was sold to Ralph Stock in 1919 who undertook a cruise around the world with her. In 1921 the popular book &quot;The Cruise of the Dream Ship&quot; based on Stock&#x27;s voyage was published.

During the early 1920s, a 47 feet yacht was built in China. The lines were based on Colin Archer’s 1908 Mk. III rescue boat plans. The boat was named SHANGHAI and sailed to Denmark in 1923/24 by the Danish owners and sold to an American judge F. DeWitt Wells to undertake a voyage similar to the Vikings to America. In June 1923, plans for SHANGHAI were published in the American magazine &quot;MotorBoat&quot;.

In 1924 William Atkin was contacted by W.W. Nutting, editor of the American magazine &quot;MotorBoat&quot; and earlier Atkin customer. He wanted a yacht based on Colin Archer’s rescue boats. Atkin designed a 32 feet yacht with lines basically a scaled-down version of Colin Archer’s Mk. III rescue boat, slightly sharper bow lines and with a cutter rig. The design was called &quot;ERIC&quot; and was published in the &quot;Motorboat&quot;. Nutting, however, heard that boats were cheaper in Norway and cancelled the order. In Norway he bought a 40 feet second-hand double ender. Although built as yacht, the lines were basically of a fishing boat design with a great beam (by 14,5 feet – 36%) and without a ballast keel. It had high bulwarks and the large cockpit that was not self-draining to give access to the engine beneath. Nutting wanted to sail the northerly route to America, and in the boat LEIV ERIKSSON, left Norway at same time as SHANGHAI. Unfortunately, Nutting and his crew were lost without a trace off Greenland in September. SHANGHAI also had problems as their sails parted, they blew ashore on an island on Nova Scotia, but one crew managed to swim ashore in the breakers and pull the others ashore with lines. He thereafter managed to swim to the mainland so a boat could rescue the others.

William Atkins plans for ERIC, published in &quot;MotorBoat&quot; arose immediate interest. Plans were modified with a new interior, ketch rig and three boats were built and launched in 1925. Atkin received more orders and more Archer-type yachts were designed. The INGRID in 1934 is 37.5 feet and a stretched version (beam 30%) with well-undercut forefoot and hollow waterlines. The lines resemble Archer’s yachts except Archer had greatest beam further aft. Archer, on his later yachts, used fuller lines, especially aft.

The &quot;Eric&quot; went on to become very influential in ocean sailing, with boats such as Vito Dumas&#x27;s &quot;Lehg II&quot; and Robin Knox-Johnston&#x27;s &quot;Suhaili&quot; making notable circumnavigations. The latter was the first boat to sail single-handed and non-stop around the world in 1968 Golden Globe Race. &quot;Suhaili&quot; was very under canvassed and definitely the slowest boat in the race, but as the only one of nine boats to complete the race, she took both first prizes; the first and fastest boat!

Another Colin Archer type boat to become very famous in the 1968 Golden Globe Race, was the French sailor and author Bernard Moitessier in his custom-built 39-foot steel ketch &quot;Joshua.&quot; She had a tall rig and was catching up on &quot;Suhaili&quot;, but instead of passing the finishing line, Moitessier continued around the world to Tahiti, thus sailing 1.5 times around the globe, non-stop, single-handed.

During the 1970s, Atkin&#x27;s ERIC design was adapted to glass-reinforced plastic by William Crealock, and became the Westsail 32 and has inspired many imitations, so that the &quot;Archer double-ender&quot; style of boat continues to be popular to the present day.

The Argentinian naval architect Manuel M. Campos based his designs on Archer/Atkin and built Vito Dumas&#x27;s &quot;Lehg II&quot; in 1934 in Argentina. Other of Campos designs have less draught that the typical Archer-type.

The Tahiti ketch is derived from the Archer-type. The Tahiti ketch is characterized by a straight sternpost, less draught and its small rig. The straight sternpost and hull shape make it easier to build.

The &#x27;Venus&#x27; yachts built by Paul Erling Johnson in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s are also heavily influenced by Colin Archer&#x27;s designs.

<doc id="730668" wikidata="Q2112141" url="?curid=730668" title="Rate of profit">
<text>In economics and finance, the profit rate is the relative profitability of an investment project, a capitalist enterprise or a whole capitalist economy. It is similar to the concept of rate of return on investment. 

==Historical cost &quot;vs.&quot; market value==
The rate of profit depends on the definition of &quot;capital invested&quot;. Two measurements of the value of capital exist: capital at historical cost and capital at market value. Historical cost is the original cost of an asset at the time of purchase or payment. Market value is the re-sale value, replacement value, or value in present or alternative use. 

To compute the rate of profit, replacement cost of capital assets must be used to define the capital cost. Assets such as machinery cannot be replaced at their historical cost, but must be purchased at the current market value. When inflation occurs, historical cost would not take account of rising prices of equipment. The rate of profit would be overestimated, using lower historical cost for computing the value of capital invested. 

On the other side, due to technical progress, products tend to become cheaper. This in itself should, theoretically, raise rates of profit, because replacement cost declines.

==A prisoner&#x27;s dilemma==

If, however, firms achieve higher sales per worker the more they invest per worker, they will try to increase investments per worker as long as this raises their rate of profit. If some capitalists do this, all capitalists must do it, because those who do not will fall behind in competition. 

This, however, means that replacement cost of capital per worker invested, now calculated at the replacement cost necessary to keep up with the competition, tends to be increased by firms more so than sales per worker before. This squeeze, that investments per worker tend to be driven up by competition more so than before sales per worker have been increased, causes the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. Thus, capitalists are caught in a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma or rationality trap. 

This &quot;new&quot; rate of profit (r&#x27;), which tends to fall, would be measured as 

::: r&#x27; = (surplus-value)/(capital to be invested for the next period of production in order to remain competitive).

==Numerical example==
At the beginning of a &quot;year&quot; (possibly another length of time period, in this case other numerical values will arise) the capitalist has to invest an amount of capital. 

For example, he must invest: 
*&quot;100 €&quot; for wages (variable capital &quot;v&quot;)
:Furthermore he must invest for constant capital &quot;c&quot;:
*&quot;100 €&quot; for “production material”
*&quot;100 €&quot; for “instruments” (life span 2 years)
*&quot;100 €&quot; for “machines” (life span 4 years)
*&quot;100 €&quot; for “equipment” (life span infinity).
:In total he invests at the beginning of the year &quot;500 €.&quot;

Now, it is assumed that during the year the capitalist can produce and sell commodities at a total price of &quot;300 €&quot;. Volume of sales, therefore, is &quot;300 €&quot;. 

From volume of sales costs of the year must be deducted. Costs of circulating capital are expenses for “production material” and for labour power, both of them are consumed in production during the year (that is the definition of “circulating capital”):
*&quot;100 €&quot; wage costs (variable capital) – see assumption above.
*&quot;100 €&quot; expenses for material – see assumption above.
*costs of fixed capital (depreciation).
:Fixed capital are those means of production, which are in use for more than one year: The capitalist must take into account, that “instruments” and “machines” do not live forever, but must finally be replaced after usage. From sales he must take aside certain sums of money (depreciation) to be able to replace “instruments” and “machines” at their end of life. For “instruments”, the depreciation expense per year is &quot;50 €&quot; (&quot;100 €&quot; purchase cost divided by lifespan of 2 years, straight-line depreciation assumed) and for “machines” &quot;25 €&quot; (100 € purchase cost divided by 4 years). For “equipment” there is no depreciation expense, because, in this example, it is assumed that equipment holds forever, there is no wear and tear for equipment.

In total, costs are &quot;275 €&quot;.

Sales of &quot;300 €&quot; minus costs of &quot;275 €&quot; gives a profit of &quot;25 €&quot;. &quot;25 €&quot; in relation to an initial capital investment of &quot;500 €&quot; gives a rate of profit of &quot;5 %&quot;. From year to year capital can grow at a rate of 5%, if all profits are invested or accumulated.

==Marxian economics==
In Marxian political economy, the rate of profit (r) would be measured as 

::: r = (surplus value)/(capital invested).

where surplus value corresponds to unpaid labor in the production process or to profits, interest, and rent (property income).

<text>The Libertador General Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins Region (, ), often shortened to O&#x27;Higgins Region (), is one of Chile&#x27;s 16 first order administrative divisions. It is subdivided into three provinces. It is named in honour of Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins Riquelme, one of Chile&#x27;s founding fathers.

The Libertador General Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins Region is bordered to the west by the Pacific Ocean, to the east by the Republic of Argentina, to the north by the Valparaíso and Santiago Metropolitan Regions, and to the south by the Maule Region. It extends approximately between the parallels of 33° 51&#x27; and 35° 01&#x27; south latitude, and between the meridian of 70° 02&#x27; west longitude and the Pacific Ocean.

The capital and largest city of the region is Rancagua. The second major town is San Fernando.

==Geography==
In pre-Quaternary times extensive Nothofagus forests covered much of Libertador General Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins Region.

The Libertador General Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins Region is part of the very restricted range of the endangered Chilean Wine Palm, &quot;Jubaea chilensis&quot;; in prehistoric times this Chilean endemic tree had a significantly larger range.

==History==
From 9000 BCE to 300 BCE (the Archaic Period), the humans who inhabited the region moved between the coast and the valley as well as the Andes. At sites such as Pichilemu, Cáhuil and Bucalemu, they left trash deposits or shell middens bearing testimony to their raids . During the Agroalfarero Period (300 BCE – 1470 CE), the inhabitants experienced changes in their way of life, the most important being the cultivation of vegetables and the manufacture of clay objects. From 600 CE onwards, they started cultivating beans, maize, squashes, pumpkins and quinoa. All of these except quinoa and some types of maize required irrigation, which prompted them to move to the banks of creeks and rivers. During this period, groups of people lived in Quincha houses with straw roofs, in the vicinity of irrigation channels and horticulture crops, a style of life attributable to the Promaucaes or Picunches and to the Chiquillanes. During the Colonial Period (1541 CE to 1811 CE), the region became dominated, like the rest of the country, by the Spanish, and a system of ranching became predominant .

==Demography==

The Libertador General Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins region contains a large part of the rural population (surpassed only by the Maule Region). Amongst the highly populated cities, Rancagua (206,971 inhabitants) stands out for having been transformed, in recent times, into an outskirt of Santiago. It is close being located 87 km south of Santiago. It is the capital of the Cachapoal Province as well the Libertador General Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins Region. According to the census of 2002, other densely populated cities are: San Fernando (49,519 inhabitants); Rengo (30,891); Machalí (23,920); Graneros (21,616); San Vicente de Tagua Tagua (18,914); Santa Cruz (18,603); Chimbarongo (13,795); Pichilemu (12,392), a well-known beach resort city founded by Agustin Ross Edwards in the late 19th century; and San Francisco de Mostazal (12,037).

==Economy==
The main industrial and export activity takes place at CODELCO&#x27;s El Teniente mine, which contributes 7.7% of Chile&#x27;s copper production. The ore is processed at the Sewell and Colón concentrator plants, smelted and refined at Caletones, and shipped from the port of San Antonio, in the Valparaíso Region. Byproducts include molybdenum and silver.

Agriculture contributes 30.1% of the region&#x27;s GDP. One out of every four hectares of fruit orchards in Chile is in the Libertador General Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins Region. The main crops are apples and pears, followed by table grapes, plums, kiwis, and nectarines.

Manufacturing activity in the region is mostly related to copper mining, agribusiness, and food and beverages. One particular growth area is the production of fruit juices and pulp, and dehydrated fruit.

Over the past few years, there has been significant development in the forestry sector, especially plantations of eucalyptus and radiata pine.

==Law and government==

The region is co-governed by a presidential regional delegate, who is appointed by the president —currently independent Fabio López— and popularly-elected governor of O&#x27;Higgins, Pablo Silva Amaya, who was elected in 2021 and will serve until 2025. 

The administration of the region rests with the regional government which is headed by the regional governor and the regional council (&quot;Consejo Regional de Chile&quot;). The latter comprises twenty regional council members, who are popularly elected since 2013 (thirteen from Cachapoal, five from Colchagua, and two from Cardenal Caro).

===Administrative divisions===
For purposes of interior administration, the Libertador General Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins Region is divided into three provinces:
* Cachapoal Province, capital: Rancagua,
* Colchagua Province, capital: San Fernando,
* Cardenal Caro Province, capital: Pichilemu.

The provinces are subdivided into 33 communes.


== Education ==
==Culture==
This area is known as the &quot;huaso province&quot; after the name of the Chilean cowboy, the huaso. Sashes and mantas – traditional items of the huaso costume – are woven in Doñihue on heavy vertical looms. Designs imitate vine leaves, bunches of grapes, pines and copihues. Other designs of colored stripes are woven on horizontal looms.

The population is a mixture of both European (including Argentine immigrants) and indigenous races and cultures, thus the region has a homogeneous culture known as &quot;Chileanidad&quot; is present and a mestizo imprint is evident.

The Libertador General Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins Region was settled by Spaniards (notably Andalusians, Basques, Aragonese and Navarrese) and other Europeans. French and Italian families established agriculture including the important wine industry: the Wine Route is one of the main tourist attractions of the Colchagua valley. Breweries can be found as well, the legacy of German and Swiss immigration. Livestock herding was especially influenced by British, Greek and Yugoslavian settlers.

<text>43 Ariadne is a fairly large and bright main-belt asteroid. It is the second-largest member of the Flora asteroid family. It was discovered by N. R. Pogson on 15 April 1857 and named after the Greek heroine Ariadne.

==Characteristics==
Ariadne is very elongate (almost twice as long as its smallest dimension) and probably bi-lobed or at least very angular. It is a retrograde rotator, although its pole points almost parallel to the ecliptic towards ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (−15°, 253°) with a 10° uncertainty. This gives an axial tilt of about 105°.

==Studies==
43 Ariadne was in a study of asteroids using the Hubble FGS. Asteroids studied include (63) Ausonia, (15) Eunomia, (43) Ariadne, (44) Nysa, and (624) Hektor.

<doc id="730672" wikidata="Q2166" url="?curid=730672" title="Maule Region">
<text>The Maule Region (, ) is one of Chile&#x27;s 16 first order administrative divisions. Its capital is Talca. The region derives its name from the Maule River which, running westward from the Andes, bisects the region and spans a basin of about 20,600 km2. The Maule river is of considerable historic interest because, among other reasons, it marked the southern limits of the Inca Empire.

==Geography and ecology==

The region covers an area of and is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean; on the east by the Argentina; on the north by the O&#x27;Higgins Region, and on the south by the Ñuble Region.

From west to east, the region extends from the Pacific coast over the Chilean Coast Range (Cordillera de la Costa) to include a portion of the Chilean Central Valley, and the Andes mountains from the foothills to the crest.

There are a number of flora and fauna species present in Maule. For example, the endangered Chilean wine palm (&quot;Jubaea chilensis&quot;) is found in a very limited distribution that includes the Maule Region. The limited-range and endangered trees &quot;Nothofagus alessandrii&quot; and &quot;Gomortega keule&quot; are also found in the region.

Protected areas in the region include Altos de Lircay National Reserve, Federico Albert National Reserve, 
Laguna Torca National Reserve, Los Bellotos del Melado National Reserve, Los Queules National Reserve, Los Ruiles National Reserve, and Radal Siete Tazas National Park.

==Demography==

According to the 2017 census, the population of the region was 1,033,197. With one third of its population living in rural areas, Maule has a greater proportion of rural inhabitants than any other region of Chile. Its most populated city is the regional capital, Talca, with 235,000 inhabitants, followed by Curicó (120,700) and Linares (127,000). Other important cities are: Constitución (50,914), Parral (47,000), Cauquenes (43,000), Molina (42,000) and San Javier (40,000).

===Population density===
The average density of the Maule Region is 34.1 inhabitants per km2, with less dense areas towards the mountains, and dense areas in the central valley.

===Composition by age and sex===
According to the composition pyramid of the population of the Region, those younger than fifteen years old are becoming greater in number than the adult population. The annual growth rate of the population of the Maule Region is 1.06%; this comparatively low figure arises from the low birth rate in the Region. The average life expectancy in the Region is 76.3 years.

==Economy==

Forestry and agriculture, led by wine grape plantations, are the main economic activities. The Maule region is Chile&#x27;s leading wine-making region, producing 50% of all the country&#x27;s fine export wines, and a number of the largest vineyards are located here. Owing to its high concentration of vineyards, the Curicó Valley, which means &quot;black water&quot; in Mapudungun, is considered the core of Chile&#x27;s wine industry. Wine-making is a traditional activity, some vineyards dating back to 1830. The increased wine-growing area is matched by the development of the industry&#x27;s infrastructure, technology, and equipment.

In addition to wine, two export-oriented agricultural items have emerged dynamically: fruit, vegetables and flowers.

Electricity, gas and water are the second most important economic activity. The Maule River feeds five hydroelectric power plants, including the Colbún-Machicura complex.

==Political divisions==
The four provinces of the Maule Region are divided into 30 communes.

==History==

===Heritage===
The Maule Region has produced a remarkable number of famous men and women, in particular writers and poets but also, statesmen and presidents, scientists and naturalists, churchmen, musicians and folklorists, journalists and historians. Thus, the Maule river, the long and wide artery that runs through the region, has been considered Chile&#x27;s literary river &quot;par excellence&quot;. Many novels and short stories have had the river as their main background or protagonist. Several anthologies, author&#x27;s dictionaries and essays have given their account of the cultural wealth of the region.

The region boasts of many small towns and villages with well-preserved colonial rural architecture, both in the religious as well as the civil fields. The Talca and Linares dioceses (the two Roman Catholic dioceses in the Maule region) have several parish churches of particular beauty and architectural and historic value.

===27 February 2010 earthquake and aftermath===

At 03:34 local time (06:34 UTC), an 8.8 magnitude earthquake occurred off the Maule coast approximately southwest of Curanipe and north-northeast of Chile&#x27;s second largest city, Concepción. The earthquake lasted nearly four minutes, severely affected the region through its action and the resultant tsunami. Cauquenes was damaged by the earthquake. Constitución was damaged by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Restoring power in both cities in the immediate aftermath was impossible because of damage from the tsunami.

* Rodrigo Galilea Vial

===Provincial Governors===
* Curicó Province: Gloria Rojas
* Talca Province: María Elena Villagrán
* Linares Province: Luis Suazo
* Cauquenes Province: María Angélica Sáez

===Members of Parliament (&quot;Diputados&quot;)===

The Maule Region is divided into five parliamentary districts. Each one of these returns two members of parliament or deputies.

The table shows the district number, the municipalities encompassed in each district and the names (and party) of the respective members of parliament.

===Senators (&quot;Senadores&quot;)===

The Maule Region is divided into two senatorial circumscriptions. One (Circumscription North) is composed of the provinces of Curicó and Talca and the other by the provinces of Linares and Cauquenes. Thus, senatorial circumscription North encompasses parliamentary districts 36, 37 and 38, and senatorial circumscription South encompasses parliamentary districts 39 and 40. Each circumscription elects two senators.

<doc id="730677" wikidata="Q515673" url="?curid=730677" title="Gush Shalom">
<text>Gush Shalom () is an Israeli peace activism group founded by Uri Avnery in 1993. Avnery–a former journalist, Irgun and Knesset member–also led the organization till his death in 2018. In 2010, the American Friends Service Committee has described the group as &quot;one of Israel&#x27;s most influential peace organizations&quot;.

==Organisation==
The movement was established in 1993 by Uri Avnery. Avnery stated that he started Gush Shalom because other Israeli peace groups did not take a strong stance against what he considered &quot;the repressive measures&quot; of the government of Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.

Gush Shalom is an extra-parliamentary organization, independent of any party or other political grouping although it has members who are associated with various political parties.

==Stance==
Gush Shalom objects to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, and argues that the occupation is illegal and that Israel is committing war crimes on a daily basis. It opposes Israel&#x27;s policies of blockade and non-recognition of the Gaza Strip. It supports a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine question, with the Green Line as the border between Israel and Palestine (with minor exchanges of territories), and with Jerusalem as the capital of both states.

The movement supports soldiers&#x27; refusal to serve in the West Bank or Gaza strip, recognition in principle of Palestinian right of return, and an Israeli withdrawal to the Green Line. Gush Shalom activists regularly confront Israeli security forces at construction sites in settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, and along the Separation Barrier. Gush Shalom said that Israel&#x27;s offer to Yasser Arafat in the Camp David negotiations of 2000 was not a &quot;generous offer&quot; but &quot;a humiliating demand for surrender&quot;, publishing the maps from the proposal (seldom published in the US), and an animation from the maps showing how little would be left for a Palestinian state under the proposal Avnery was among the first to meet and negotiate with PLO leader Yasser Arafat. In 2001 the organisation made a peace proposal on the basis of a two-state solution with the 1967 boundaries.

During the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict, Gush Shalom was a vigorous critic of the Israeli attack on Gaza. Avnery described it as &quot;the Election War&quot; since he believed it was intended to increase the election chances of Defence Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni in the planned February elections.

Gush Shalom in one of numerous Israeli organizations pertaining to the radical left. It has been described as left-wing in the Israeli and US media.

Avnery wrote: 
Every left-wing body fears with terror the one who is on its left. The right-wing of the Avoda party is afraid of its left-wing. The left wing is afraid of Meretz. Meretz is afraid of Yossi Beilin, who was pushed out of the Avoda by Amram Mitzna and his leftist friends and that Meretz also didn&#x27;t give him a realist position on its list. Meretz is afraid of &quot;Shalom Achshav&quot;. &quot;Shalom Achshav&quot; is afraid of &quot;Gush Shalom&quot; and the Arab parties.

==Praise and criticism==
===Praise===
International human rights groups, including Amnesty International, American Friends Service Committee, and others, have lauded Gush Shalom for promoting peace and understanding between Israelis and Palestinians. The AFSC awarded Avnery the &quot;Profiles of Peace&quot; honor for his work for peace. The Haaretz newspaper publishes a weekly editorial statement by Gush Shalom in its weekend edition.

In 2001, Gush Shalom received the Right Livelihood Award &quot;for their unwavering conviction, in the midst of violence, that peace can only be achieved through justice and reconciliation&quot;.

===Criticism===
Israeli journalist Uri Dan, a close friend and confidant of Ariel Sharon, described Gush Shalom in &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; as &quot;lunatic fringe&quot; due to the group&#x27;s statement that they are monitoring Israeli soldiers&#x27; activities and will consider submitting collected evidence to international courts. Dan described the announcement as &quot;preparing to inform on their brother soldiers – who are defending them too&quot;.

Isi Leibler, an influential Jewish leader and commentator, criticized the group for techniques that mirror images of the Soviet models, &quot;exploit[ing] emotions&quot; by creating bodies associated with &#x27;mothers&#x27; and &#x27;children&#x27;, such as &quot;Women in Black&quot; and &quot;Mothers against War&quot;. He stated this was done in order to further their interests under the guise of promoting peace, and noted that, in a similar manner, communists also encouraged draft evasion in democratic countries as Gush Shalom are doing. Leibler criticized the group members for &quot;[believing] they and they alone represent the true apostles of peace and those opposing them are fascists, racists, and warmongers&quot;, further describing the group as &quot;[part of] the radical wings of Israel&#x27;s contemporary peace movement&quot;.

<text>Beaver Island () is one of the Beaver Island group of Falkland Islands. It lies west of Weddell Island and south of New Island and has an area of .

Other islands in the group include Staats Island, with an area of ; Tea Island, which covers ; Governor Island, which covers ; Split Island, with an area of and a few smaller islands. Though the smaller islands in the group are low-lying, the larger islands are very hilly, with many peaks of more than and some more than . The highest elevation in the Beaver Island Group is .

==History and population==
Beaver Island was named after the whaling vessel &quot;Beaver&quot; which was recorded as being the first whaling ship to double Cape Horn.

Beaver Settlement lies on the island, with an airstrip nearby. It is owned by Sally and Jerome Poncet.

==Wildlife==
Wildlife on the island includes gentoo penguins, South American gray foxes (introduced, not to be confused with the Falkland Islands wolf), peregrine falcons, crested and striated caracaras, guanacos, fur seals, and many seabirds. Beds of kelp can be found offshore.

The Beaver Island Group has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area. At least 40 species have been recorded, with 34 known to breed there. Species for which the group is an important breeding site include Falkland steamer ducks (245 pairs), gentoo penguins (2850 pairs), Magellanic penguins (2000 pairs), and southern giant petrels (300 pairs).

<text>44 Nysa is a large and very bright main-belt asteroid, and the brightest member of the Nysian asteroid family. It is classified as a rare class E asteroid and is probably the largest of this type (though 55 Pandora is only slightly smaller).

== Discovery ==
It was discovered by Hermann Goldschmidt on May 27, 1857, and named after the mythical land of Nysa in Greek mythology.

== Physical properties ==
In 2002 Kaasalainen &quot;et al.&quot; used 63 lightcurves from the Uppsala Asteroid Photometric Catalog (UAPC) to construct a shape model of 44 Nysa. The shape model is conical, which they interpreted as indicating the asteroid may actually be a contact binary.

In 2003, Tanga &quot;et al.&quot; published results obtained from the Fine Guidance Sensor on the Hubble Space Telescope in which high-precision interferometry was performed on Nysa with the goal of a more accurate shape determination. Due to Hubble&#x27;s orbit around the Earth, hours-long photometry sessions, as are normally used to resolve the asteroid&#x27;s shape, were not possible. Instead, the team used interferometry on the asteroid at the time in its rotation when it would have its longest axis perpendicular to the Earth. Ellipsoidal shape models were then fit to the resulting data to determine an estimate of the asteroid&#x27;s shape. Both single and double ellipsoid models were fit to the data with both providing approximately the same goodness of fit; leaving the team unable to differentiate between a single elongated object and the contact binary model put forth by Kaasalainen &quot;et al.&quot;
An observation of an occultation by 44 Nysa of TYC 6273-01033-1 from the Dutch amateur astronomer Harrie Rutten showed a two-phase reappearance on March 20, 2012. This confirms the conical shape or the binary nature of Nysa.

In December 2006, Shepard &quot;et al.&quot; performed three days of radar observations on Nysa with the Arecibo radio telescope. The asteroid was found to have a high radar polarization value (&quot;μc&quot;) of 0.50 ± 0.2, a radar albedo (formula_1) of 0.19 ± 0.06, and a visual albedo (&quot;pv&quot;) of 0.44 ± 0.10. The albedo measurements were based on a shape model worked out at Arecibo. The best fit shape model as measured by the Arecibo team has parameters a/b = 1.7 ± 0.1, a/c = 1.6–1.9, with an a-axis of 113 ± 10 km; this gives an effective diameter of 79 ± 10 km, which is in agreement with the HST study by Tanga &quot;et al.&quot; in 2003. The data gathered also showed signs of significant concavity in Nysa&#x27;s structure, but the dip in the radar curves is not pronounced enough to indicate bifurcation, calling into question whether or not Nysa really is a contact binary.

Nysa has so far been reported occulting a star three times.

==Studies==
44 Nysa was in a study of asteroids using the Hubble FGS. Asteroids studied include 63 Ausonia, 15 Eunomia, 43 Ariadne, 44 Nysa, and 624 Hektor.

<doc id="730685" wikidata="Q2170" url="?curid=730685" title="Biobío Region">
<text>The Biobío Region ( ) is one of Chile&#x27;s sixteen regions (first-order administrative divisions). With a population of 1.5 million, thus being the third most populated region in Chile, it is divided into three provinces: Arauco, Biobío and Concepción. The latter contains its capital and largest city, Concepción, a major city and metro area in the country. Los Ángeles, capital of the Biobío Province, is another important city in the region.

==Geography==

The Region of the Biobío is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, on the east by Argentina, on the north by the Chilean Region of Ñuble, and on the south by the Chilean Region of Araucanía.

The Region has been hit by many Chilean earthquakes, including the most powerful earthquake ever recorded (in 1960) and the great earthquake of 2010. Many communities in the region were greatly affected by the earthquake of 2010 and the subsequent tsunami. That earthquake damaged Talcahuano and Dichato; the tsunami destroyed much of what remained of the port town.

==History==

===Historic regions===
This is an inland valley between the cities of Concepción and Los Angeles, and it felt the greatest impact of the earthquake of 27 February 2010. The Department of Rere was a vital settlement area of Chileans and the three-hundred-year struggle (until the 1870s) to defeat the strong indigenous tribe of the Mapuches.

Chilean settlers of Spanish California from the present Region of the Bio Bío (especially from Concepción, Talcahuano, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and the Department of Rere) may have played a part in the establishment of Los Angeles and the rest of southern California in the period between 1775 and 1820.

Thousands of Chilean miners, ranchers, and shopkeepers from the Biobío Region are thought to have settled the coasts, mountains, and valleys of what became American California, both before and after the Mexican–American War, and to have helped create the cities of San Francisco, San Jose, Santa Barbara, and San Diego, California.

==Demographics and cities==
According to data from the 2017 census, the Region of the Biobío, with 2,018,803 inhabitants, is the second most populous region of Chile, after the Metropolitan Region of Santiago. In connection with the 1992 census, reflecting a total population of 1,734,305 inhabitants, there was a population growth of 7.3% in 10 years (1992–2002), the second lowest nationally, after the Region Magallanes and Chilean Antarctica. Taking into account their 37062.6 km ² in area, was in 2002, a density of 50.23 inhabitants per km2, the third highest nationally.

The 2002 census showed an urban population of 1,528,306 inhabitants, corresponding to 82.1% of regional population and a rural population of 333,256 inhabitants, equivalent to 17.9% of the population of the region. Of the 1,861,562 inhabitants of the region of Biobío in 2002, 915,200 (49.16%) were men and 946,362 (50.84%) were women.

The metropolitan area of Concepción is one of the most populated conurbations in the country with a population of 979,937 inhabitants, corresponding to the sum of the population of the ten districts of Greater Concepción: Concepción (216,061 inhabitants) Talcahuano (250,348), Hualpén (88,046), San Pedro de la Paz (80,447) Chiguayante (81,302) Colonel (95,528) Lota (49,089) Penco (46,016) Tomé (52,440) and Hualqui (20,660).

Another of the most populated cities in the region are Chillán, with 165,528 inhabitants, is the tenth most populous urban area in the country, and is a conurbation with a portion of its population living in urban areas of the town of Chillán (146,701 inhabitants), and another that lives in the urban area of the town of Chillán Viejo (21,827 inhabitants), and Los Angeles, with its 166,556 inhabitants, is the eighteenth most populous urban area in the country.

With regard to the Province of Biobío, in addition to Los Angeles, other major cities are: Mulchén with 21,819 inhabitants, Birth to 20,884 inhabitants, the conurbation La Laja-San Rosendo, with a total population of 19,537 inhabitants, with 11,947 inhabitants in Cabrero.

With regard to the Province of Arauco, the most populated cities are: Curanilahue with 30,126 inhabitants, Lebu, the provincial capital, with 20,838 inhabitants, with 19,839 inhabitants Canete, Arauco with 16,291 inhabitants, and Los Alamos with 13,035 inhabitants.

With regard to membership or Indigenous Native Peoples, 52,918 people declared in the census of 2002 as Mapuche. This is 2.84% of the regional population and used the relationship Paternal = Female: Amerindian to determine the racial classification of persons identified as Mapuche. 

=== Communes ===
The communes of the Biobío Region are:
===Ethnography===

Along with Araucania, Ñuble, Maule and O&#x27;Higgins regions, Biobío&#x27;s population is believed to be a remarkably homogeneous culture, but is of various ethnic and racial backgrounds. About 70% of inhabitants are of European origin, primarily of Spanish, German, French and other European communities. The mestizos make up 27% of the population and are the result of mixing between Europeans and Amerindians, while Amerindian population is 3%, mainly Mapuche. There is a romantic symbol of Chilenidad: huaso or cowboy/ shepherd &quot;culture&quot;, typical of Chile.

Large numbers of Andalusians, Asturians, Basque, Galicians, Leonese, Murcian, Navarrans, and Valencians nationalities other than the &quot;Castilian&quot; Spanish established the nation and culture and gave the Spanish language to Chile.

Other waves of non-Spanish settlement of the region include Germans from Germany, Austria and Switzerland; French and Italians, whom contributed to the regional wine industry; British people, like English and Scottish, have densely settled Concepción on the coast; Dutch, Greek and Portuguese founded the oceanic fishing industry; Arab peoples like the Lebanese and Palestinians established several small businesses; and small scattering of U.S. Americans, Scandinavians and Eastern Europeans (mostly from the former Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, especially Croats) established themselves in Chile as they fled political turmoil.

===Religion===
According to a 2002 census 58.63% of the inhabitants of the Biobío Region profess Catholicism, equivalent to 805,517 people, the third largest concentration of Catholics in a region in Chile, while the lowest percentage of Catholics corresponding to a region nationwide. 28.36% declare themselves as Protestant or Evangelical, equivalent to 389,632 people, the second largest concentration of Protestants in a region, while the highest percentage of Evangelicals corresponding to a region nationwide.

The province of Arauco is the only province to national level in which the number of Evangelicals, corresponding to 47.47% of the population, is greater than that of Catholics, corresponding to 36.33% of the population. It is a result of Protestant (Lutheran and Calvinist), Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Seventh-day Adventist and Mormon missionary work in Arauco during the 20th century.

Biobío tends to show a more culturally conservative attitude in contrast to the urban areas of Santiago/Valparaiso, which have a more liberal cosmopolitan position. It is more common for residents to attend church regularly, be it Catholic or Protestant.

==Economy==
For decades, the characteristic feature of the Biobío Region has been its manufacturing industry, which contributes 35.6% of its GDP and operates mainly around the ports of Talcahuano, San Vicente, Lirquén, and Coronel, the greatest concentration of ports in Chile. The range of activities is broad, extending from iron and steel making to foodstuffs manufacture, petrochemicals, metalworking, oil refining, and shipyards.

The region&#x27;s dynamism is also rooted in its large rivers. The important hydroelectric power complex on the Laja River is composed of the El Toro, Abanico, and Antuco power plants, and the Pangue and Ralco plants on the upper Biobío River. These facilities supply 26.6% of the energy used from Taltal in the north to Chiloé Archipelago to the south.

The region contains almost 44% of Chile&#x27;s forest plantations, of which around 82% are radiata pine. It is the largest exporter of forestry products and supplies raw materials for pulp and paper plants, sawmills, and related activities.

The fishing industry is another dynamic sector. The region possesses 32% of the country&#x27;s total fishing fleet, while approximately 50% of the national catch is unloaded at its ports. Moreover, this region alone is responsible for 4% of the world&#x27;s catch of seafood. Main items include shellfish and conger eel, sardines, anchovy, mackerel, hake, mollusks, crustaceans, and algae.

High-quality fertile soils support a wide variety of crops, principally produce, grains, vegetables, artificial and improved pastures.

Animal husbandry focuses on production of beef, milk, and dairy products. Mining activity includes non-metallic minerals, principally quartz for the glass and steel industries.

<doc id="730687" wikidata="Q4899405" url="?curid=730687" title="Beverley Flynn">
<text>Beverley Flynn (born 9 June 1966) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who was a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Mayo constituency from 1997 to 2011.

==Early life and political career==
She is the daughter of the former Fianna Fáil minister and European commissioner, Pádraig Flynn, who once described her as a &quot;class act&quot;. She first stood for election in the June 1994 Mayo West by-election as the Fianna Fáil candidate, but was not successful. The by-election was caused by the appointment of her father as Ireland&#x27;s European commissioner and was won by Michael Ring of Fine Gael. She was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1997 general election, as a Fianna Fáil TD for the Mayo constituency. In 2003, given that her marriage to John Cooper had ended some time previously, she requested that the media refer to her as Beverley Flynn rather than Beverley Cooper-Flynn.

==Libel action==
The RTÉ journalist Charlie Bird claimed in a report that, while an employee of National Irish Bank, Flynn had assisted clients of the bank in evading tax by funnelling undeclared income to Clerical Medical schemes based in the Isle of Man. She denied the claims and sued RTÉ, Bird and retired farmer James Howard for libel in the High Court in 2001. The jury found that although RTÉ had not proved its case (it was a different employee who had handled Howard&#x27;s account), the allegations were found to be substantially true (that RTÉ had proved Flynn had encouraged others to avail of illegal investment schemes). Thus, despite Flynn technically winning the case, she was awarded no damages as her reputation was not materially damaged), along with costs being awarded against her. Flynn appealed against the decision to the Supreme Court, where she lost.

===Delay in paying costs===
Flynn at first offered to settle with RTÉ for €590,000. RTÉ rejected this and moved to have her declared bankrupt. When the bankruptcy action against her opened in the High Court in June 2007, her lawyers were granted a postponement to allow her to challenge the constitutionality of legislation which bars bankrupts from Dáil membership. Lawyers for RTÉ accused Flynn of embarking on a &quot;litigious frolic in her own interest&quot;. She subsequently abandoned plans to challenge the legislation, which was eventually changed in 2014 with Mick Wallace, a bankrupt TD, sitting from 2016 to 2019.

On 24 June 2007, Flynn announced that she had reached a final settlement with RTÉ, paying €1.24 million of the outstanding €2.4 million The settlement created a major outcry from the public, the print media and by some TDs as RTÉ, Ireland&#x27;s public service broadcaster, is part-funded by a television license fee. The then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, &quot;rejected as &quot;contemptuous&quot; and &quot;sinister&quot; any implication that he was involved in the settlement [between Flynn and RTÉ]&quot;. Ahern issued the denial after allegations made by Fine Gael and the Labour Party that RTÉ bowed to pressure from him to reach a settlement with Flynn. RTÉ also denied this took place.

==Relationship with Fianna Fáil==
Flynn has had a difficult relationship with Fianna Fáil. She was forced to resign from the party in February 1999 for refusing to support a Government motion against her father, but rejoined in November 1999. In April 2001, she was expelled again over her libel case, but was again allowed to rejoin before the 2002 general election. She was expelled again in May 2004, after the results of her libel appeal. A &quot;cumann&quot; (branch) of Fianna Fáil that had continued to support Flynn was disbanded by the party headquarters, a first for the party. She successfully contested the 2007 general election as an independent and was elected on the eighth count. She was readmitted to the Fianna Fáil once more, at a meeting of its national executive on 3 April 2008, in what has been described as &quot;questionable circumstances&quot;.

==Independent TD allowance==
After she rejoined Fianna Fáil, controversy arose about Flynn&#x27;s entitlement to a tax-free allowance available to independent TDs. This allowance is to allow independent TDs to compete with those who are from a political party on level terms for the duration of their term as an elected representative. However, upon her return to Fianna Fáil there were questions about whether or not she continued to qualify.

She responded that, in addition to her €106,000 basic salary, she qualified for the €41,000 allowance as she won her seat as an independent TD. After meeting with the Taoiseach Brian Cowen on 6 January 2009, she stated that she would no longer claim the allowance. She also stated that the allowance was used to benefit her constituents.

She retired from politics at the 2011 general election. In the period from 2011 to 2014, she received pension and lump sums of around €194,921.

<doc id="730689" wikidata="Q2176" url="?curid=730689" title="Araucanía Region">
<text>The Araucanía ( ), La Araucanía Region ( ) is one of Chile&#x27;s 16 first-order administrative divisions, and comprises two provinces: Malleco in the north and Cautín in the south. Its capital and largest city is Temuco; other important cities include Angol and Villarrica.

Chile did not incorporate the lands of the Araucanía Region until the 1880s, when it occupied the area to end resistance by the indigenous Mapuche by both military and political means. This opened up the area for Chilean and European immigration and settlement.

In the 1900–1930 period, the population of Araucanía grew considerably, as did the economy despite recessions striking the rest of Chile. Araucanía became one of the principal agricultural districts of Chile, gaining the nickname of &quot;granary of Chile&quot;. The administrative Araucanía Region was established in 1974, in what was the core of the larger historic region of Araucanía.

In the 21st century, Araucanía is Chile&#x27;s poorest region in terms of GDP per capita. About a third of the region&#x27;s population is ethnic Mapuche, the highest proportion of any Chilean region. The Araucanía Region has been the main location of the confrontations of the ongoing Mapuche conflict, as the Mapuche have pressed their land claims against the central government.

==History==
===Early Mapuche resistance===
The Araucanía region is the heartland of the indigenous Mapuche people, who resisted both Incan and Spanish attempts at conquest. After sending many forces against the Mapuche, the Spanish would cut their losses, establishing the southern border of their colony at the northern banks of the Biobío River. Following the occupation of Araucanía by the Chilean government, which subdued the people, the territory has been a part of Chile ever since 1885.

===Chilean conquest===
Following independence, the Chilean government opted for peaceful relations with the Mapuche. Effective territorial occupation did not begin until 1862. During this time, the government allowed settlers to found new towns and constructed the railroad, telegraph, and roads into the area. After an occupation and sustained military action, Araucanía was fully incorporated into Chile in 1882. Many cities and towns in Araucanía were first developed as army outposts during and after the occupation of Araucanía. The last portions of the region to be reached by the army were Alto Biobío and Toltén River&#x27;s lowlands.

These are the regions where Mapuche communities have thrived the best since the Chilean conquest. With the construction of the Malleco Viaduct in the 1890s, the region became more accessible. Settlements in southern Chile became more consolidated.

===Granary of Chile===

Until the mid-20th century, the large agricultural estates (&quot;estancias&quot;) that were established in Araucanía were cultivated in wheat, led to its being called the &quot;Granary of Chile&quot;. With naturally fertile soil and the implementation of modern technology such as tractors, wheat harvests were extraordinarily high, but because the farmers did not perform crop rotation, and indiscriminate logging and burning of woodlands was permitted, soils were prone to extensive erosion. They lost their fertility and much topsoil was lost to erosion.

Beginning in the 1930s, Villarrica Lake was developed as a tourism area.

===Economic expansion and renewed Mapuche conflict===

With the return of democracy in Chile in 1990, Mapuche organizations renewed their land claims on certain territories. Rising violence has accompanied what is now called the Mapuche conflict. Coordinadora Arauco-Malleco and similar activist groups have sometimes used arson attacks and death threats to back up their claims; other organizations, such as the Consejo de Todas Las Tierras, have sought and enjoyed international support from nongovernmental and their indigenous organizations.

==Geography==
Virgin forests, featuring &quot;coigüe&quot;, &quot;raulí&quot; and &quot;tepa&quot; trees, as well as &quot;lingue&quot;, &quot;tihue&quot; and cordilleran cypress, criss-cross the region in all directions. The majestic conifer &quot;Araucaria araucana&quot;, or monkey-puzzle tree (known locally as &quot;pehuén&quot;), towers above the landscape. Its fruit, the &quot;piñón&quot; (a type of massive pine nut, often growing to the size and weight of a basketball or a bowling ball) is still a staple food for the indigenous Pehuenches and local residents.

A large part of this natural wealth is protected in various national parks (Nahuelbuta, Tolhuaca, Conguillío, Villarrica, and Huerquehue National Parks) and national reserves (Malalcahuello, Las Nalcas, and Alto Biobío).

==Demography==

Spanish settlers first arrived in Araucanía (one of two regional names) in the 1550s, but were unable to subdue the indigenous Mapuche.

In the late 19th century, the Chilean government endorsed a large-scale immigration and settlement program for the area. At the time, Chile often endorsed land allotment advertisement to Europeans, notably in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, from where most of the new arrivals came. Beginning in the mid-19th century, with the German Revolutions, immigrants were often fleeing political upheaval and poor economies, seeking a new place to live. Other immigrants included Basques, from the northern Spanish border with southwest France, and some Argentines from across the Andes.

The current population is descended mostly from internal migration from the Central Zone of Chile; to a lesser extent, it consists of descendants of European settlers who arrived during and after the &quot;pacification of Araucanía&quot;. The region has the highest proportion of indigenous residents of any in Chile, around 25%, of which the majority is Mapuche people. About 25% of the population is white or &quot;castizo&quot; (another form of&quot; mestizo&quot; (50%) of partial European-Amerindian descent), and a large proportion of them is at least partially descended from Spanish colonists.

In 1903, a fleet of 88 Canarian families—400 persons—arrived in Budi Lake (and currently have more than 1,000 modern descendants) as a response to the government&#x27;s call to populate the region, and signed contracts for the benefit of a private company. While many Canarians obeyed their servitude, some of those who disobeyed the provisions of repopulation tried to escape their agreements and were arrested, or the indigenous Mapuche people took pity on the plight of these individuals who were on their former lands. The Mapuche welcomed some of them, and joined their demonstrations, in the so-called &quot;revolt of the Canarians&quot;; many Canarians integrated into the Mapuche population, thus adding to the large mestizo population that exists in Chile.

Smaller numbers of Arab (largely Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian), Chinese, Japanese, Korean and people of Euro-North American and Australian descent settled in La Araucania in the early 20th century. Temuco has a thriving Chinese, Taiwanese, and Syrian presence, and Capitán Pastene has a largely ethnic Italian community. Villarrica was where several thousand Afrikaners (or Dutch South Africans) settled after their expulsion from South Africa, following the Boer War (1899–1903). These towns also were influenced by early Dutch colonists in the 16th century, when the region was nicknamed New Flanders. The Netherlands later ceded it to Spanish colonial rule.

During the past three decades, the city of Temuco has had the fastest rate of growth in Chile. According to the census of 1970, about 88,000 inhabitants lived in Temuco. In the census of 2000, 30 years later, the population had tripled to 250,000. The resort-town of Villarrica, on Lake Villarrica, has expanded rapidly. It is located next to the fast-growing resort of Pucón, now one of the four largest tourist destinations in Chile. According to the 2002 census, the most- populated cities are: Temuco (260,783, includes Padre Las Casas), Villarrica (45,531), Angol (43,801), Victoria (23,977), Lautaro (18,808), New Imperial (14,980), Collipulli (14,240), Loncoche (14,191), and Traiguén (14,140).

==Economy==
Until recently, Araucanía was dependent on cereal farming and was known as Chile’s granary. Agriculture has become highly diversified; wheat is still the main crop, but production of oats, grapes, and lupines has increased significantly, and fruit and flower growing are also emerging.

The main tourism centre in the region is the Villarrica Lake and Pucón.

==Municipalities==
The region consists of 38 municipalities: 

*Angol
*Carahue
*Cholchol
*Collipulli
*Cunco
*Curacautín

<text>A papal legate or apostolic legate (from the ancient Roman title &quot;legatus&quot;) is a personal representative of the Pope to foreign nations, to some other part of the Catholic Church, or representatives of the state or monarchy. He is empowered on matters of Catholic faith and for the settlement of ecclesiastical matters.

The legate is appointed directly by the Pope—the Bishop of Rome and head of the Catholic Church. Hence a legate is usually sent to a government, a sovereign or to a large body of believers (such as a national church) or to take charge of a major religious effort, such as an ecumenical council, a crusade to the Holy Land, or even against a heresy such as the Cathars.

The term &quot;legation&quot; is applied both to a legate&#x27;s mandate and to the territory concerned (such as a state, or an ecclesiastical province). The relevant adjective is &quot;legatine&quot;.

== History ==

In the High Middle Ages, papal legates were often used to strengthen the links between Rome and the many parts of Christendom. More often than not, legates were learned men and skilled diplomats who were not from the country they were accredited to. For example, the Italian-born Guala Bicchieri served as papal legate to England in the early 13th century and played a major role in both the English government and church at the time. By the Late Middle Ages it had become more common to appoint native clerics to the position of legate within their own country, such as Cardinal Wolsey acting as legate to the court of Henry VIII of England. The reason for this switch in policy could be attributed to a change in attitude on the eve of the Reformation; by this point, foreign men representing the papacy would be more likely to reinforce dissent than bring Christendom closer together.

Papal legates often summoned legatine councils, which dealt with church government and other ecclesiastical issues. According to Pope Gregory VII, writing in the &quot;Dictatus papae&quot;, a papal legate &quot;presides over all bishops in a council, even if he is inferior in rank, and he can pronounce sentence of deposition against them&quot;. During the Middle Ages, a legatine council was the usual means that a papal legate imposed his directives.

== Diplomatic ranks ==
There are several ranks of papal legates in diplomacy, some of which are no longer used.

===Apostolic nuncio===

The most common form of papal legate today is the apostolic nuncio, whose task it is to strengthen relations between the Holy See and the Catholic Church in a particular country and at the same time to act as the diplomatic representative of the Holy See to the government of that country. An apostolic nuncio is generally equivalent in rank to that of ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary, although in Catholic countries the nuncio often ranks above ambassadors in diplomatic protocol. A nuncio performs the same functions as an ambassador and has the same diplomatic privileges. Under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, to which the Holy See is a party, a nuncio is an ambassador like those from any other country. The Vienna Convention allows the host state to grant seniority of precedence to the nuncio over others of ambassadorial rank accredited to the same country, and may grant the deanship of that country&#x27;s diplomatic corps to the nuncio regardless of seniority.

====Pro-nuncio====
Pro-nuncio was a term used from 1965 to 1991 for a papal diplomatic representative of full ambassadorial rank accredited to a country that did not accord him precedence over other ambassadors and &quot;ex officio&quot; deanship of the diplomatic corps. In those countries, the papal representative&#x27;s precedence within the corps is exactly on a par with that of the other members of ambassadorial rank, so that he becomes dean only on becoming the senior member of the corps.

====Apostolic delegate====
For countries with which the Holy See has no diplomatic relations, an apostolic delegate is sent to serve as a liaison with the Catholic Church in that country, though not accredited to its government.

===&quot;Legati&quot;===

====&quot;Legatus a latere&quot;====
This highest rank (literally &quot;from the (pope&#x27;s) side&quot;, i.e. &quot;intimately&quot; trusted) is normally awarded to a priest of cardinal rank. It is an exceptional investiture and can either be focused or broad in scope. The legate &quot;a latere&quot; is the alter ego of the Pope, and as such, possesses full plenipotentiary powers.

====&quot;Legatus natus&quot;====
Literally &quot;born legate&quot;, i.e. not nominated individually but &quot;ex officio&quot;, namely a bishop holding this rank as a privilege of his see, e.g. archbishops of Canterbury (pre-Reformation), Prague, Esztergom, Udine, Salzburg, Gniezno and Cologne. The &quot;legatus natus&quot; would act as the Pope&#x27;s representative in his province, with a &quot;legatus a latere&quot; only being sent in extraordinary circumstances. Although limited in their jurisdiction compared to &quot;legati a latere&quot;, a &quot;legatus natus&quot; was not subordinate to them.

====&quot;Legatus missus&quot;====
Literally &quot;sent legate&quot;, possessing limited powers for the purpose of completing a specific mission. This commission is normally focused in scope and of short duration.

== Gubernatorial legates ==
Some administrative (temporal) provinces of the Papal States in (mostly central) Italy were governed by a papal legate. This has been the case in Benevento, in Pontecorvo (of Campagna e Marittima/of Frosinone) and in Viterbo. In four cases, including Bologna, this post was awarded exclusively to cardinals; the Velletri post was created for Bartolomeo Pacca.

The title could be changed to Apostolic Delegate, as happened in Frosinone (for Pontecorvo) in 1827.

<text>The Aysén del General Carlos Ibáñez del Campo Region (, , &#x27;), often shortened toAysén RegionorAisén, is one of Chile&#x27;s 16 first order administrative divisions. Although the third largest in area, the region is Chile&#x27;s most sparsely populated region with a population of 102,317 as of 2017. The capital of the region is Coyhaique, the region&#x27;s former namesake. The region&#x27;s current namesake is the former President of Chile, General Carlos Ibáñez del Campo.

The landscape is marked by several glaciations that formed many lakes, channels and fjords. The region contains icefields including the Northern Patagonian Ice Field and the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, the world&#x27;s third largest after those in Antarctica and Greenland. The northern half of the region feature a north-south string of volcanoes. While the western part of the region is densely vegetated and mountainous, the eastern reaches contain open grasslands and much flat and rolling terrain. 

Aysén Region was the last major area to be effectively incorporated into the Republic of Chile, with the first permanent settlements emerging in the second half of the 19th century and the inland part being settled at the turn of the century. Until the construction of Route 7 (the &quot;Carretera Austral&quot;, or Southern Highway) in the 1980s, the only overland routes from north to south through the region were extremely primitive tracks.

==Demography==
Region XI, Aysen del General Carlos Ibanez del Campo, is the least populated of the country. According to the 2002 census there were only 91,492 inhabitants in an area of 106,990.9 km². The population density is 0.85 inhabitants per km². Between 2000 and 2005, the average annual growth rate was estimated at 1.35 per 100 inhabitants.

The largest cities according to the 2002 census are Coyhaique (population 44,850), Puerto Aysen (16,936), Chile Chico (3,042), Puerto Cisnes (2,517), Cochrane (2,217), Melinka (1,411) and Mañihuales Villa (1,401).

==Climate==

Aysén Region climate&#x27;s is classified as a cool oceanic climate with low temperatures, abundant precipitation and strong winds. The relief found throughout the region results in different types of climate zones in the western and eastern parts. There are four distinct climate zones found within the region. Coastal areas to the west have a cool temperate climate. The coastal areas receive abundant precipitation throughout the year with mean annual precipitation that can reach . For example, Puerto Aysen receives of precipitation per year while on San Pedro Island, it receives . Most of the precipitation are associated with strong winds from the northwest and the north. The winter months are usually the wettest months. Mean annual temperatures are between with January being the warmest month. Temperatures decrease with latitude although owing to maritime influence which is reinforced with strong westerly winds throughout the year, temperatures are not extremely low compared to inland areas. As a result, mean temperatures rarely fall below in the coldest months, while the diurnal range is small, averaging . Owing to the high precipitation year-round, relative humidity is high, averaging 87% with no months averaging below 80%. High cloud cover dominates the coastal areas year round.

In more inland areas to the east (about to the east of the coastal areas), precipitation is much lower, averaging in Cochrane to in Coyhaique. Precipitation is the highest from May to August, which receives 50% of the annual precipitation. During periods of cold temperatures, precipitation can fall as snow during these months. Being located inland and farther away from the maritime influence, the climate is more continental than coastal areas. Mean temperatures average between which tends to be lower than coastal areas at the same latitude. With lower precipitation, relative humidity is lower, averaging between 71% and 74% in Cochrane and Coyahique respectively. Cloud cover is lower and there are more clear days in inland areas than coastal areas.

Corresponding to the Northern Patagonian Ice Field and the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, which are located at higher altitudes, temperatures are cold enough to maintain permanent ice fields. These two ice fields receive abundant precipitation year-round, particularly in the west facing slopes of the Andes that descend to the ocean and fiords. The climate is very windy. No meteorological stations exist in the ice fields so it is estimated that the average high, average low and mean temperatures are below in all months to maintain permanent ice fields.

The easternmost parts of the region have a cold steppe climate. Precipitation is significantly lower than the other parts of the region with mean monthly precipitation below . Precipitation is concentrated from May to August where these months are responsible for 55% to 65% of the total annual precipitation. Snowfall can occur during these months owing to colder temperatures. Mean annual precipitation ranges from in Chile Chico to in Balmaceda. Mean temperatures are lower than areas to the east, averaging between . Mean summer temperatures can exceed in Chile Chico, which permits agriculture, similar to the one in the central parts of the country. This is due to the moderating influence of General Carrera Lake which prevents temperatures from dropping too low. The vegetation is mostly shrubs owing to the low temperatures and precipitation. Relative humidity is lower, with mean annual values varying between 62% and 71%.

==Economy==
The primary sector dominates in the regional economy, which focuses on the exploitation and processing of marine, mining, forestry, and animal resources. Aquaculture is also an important activity and the region contributes 80% of Chile&#x27;s salmon output.

The archipelago and fjord region in the west is primarily oriented towards the exploitation and cultivation of marine resources. Since the 1980s, the extraction of sea urchins and &quot;locos&quot; have featured prominently in the economy of Guaitecas Archipelago. In 1985 the discovery of &quot;merluza&quot; fishing grounds in Moraleda Channel sparkled a fishing boom. In the 1990s, salmon aquaculture became an important economic activity and has remained so.

An industrial park, devoted mainly to producing frozen and, to a lesser extent, canned, products has developed around Puerto Chacabuco, Puerto Aisén, and Puerto Cisnes.

Although mining, based on polymetallic deposits of zinc, gold, and silver, makes a small contribution to Chile&#x27;s total mining GDP, it is significant in regional exports.

Exploitation of forests and the production of yard timber, plywood, and panels for furniture is mostly geared to export markets. Animal husbandry focuses on beef cattle, sheep, and sheep&#x27;s wool, part of which is exported.

The region contains about 15,240 ha of &quot;Sphagnum&quot; bogs, and given an exploitation boom in 2010s extraction of &quot;Sphagnum&quot; in Chile is regulated by law since August 2, 2018. The commune that concentrates most of the region&#x27;s &quot;Sphagnum&quot; bogs —28.5%— is O&#x27;Higgins. Given &quot;Sphagnum&quot;’s property to absorb excess water and release it during dry months overexploitation of &quot;Sphagnum&quot; may threaten the water supply in the archipelagoes of Aysén Region.

==Government and administration==
Aysén del General Carlos Ibáñez del Campo Region is subdivided into 4 provinces in which each province is divided into municipalities (communes). There are a total of 10 municipalities in Aysén Region.

According to a 2021 study Aysén Region is one of the three Chilean regions that are most prone to suffer nepotism and elite capture.

==History==
===Early inhabitants===
The earliest historically known inhabitants of the fjords and channels of Aysén Region are the Chono and Kawésqar. These two groups shared a life style as canoe-faring hunther-gatherers. They also shared physical traits such as being of low stature, long-headed (&quot;Dolichocephalic&quot;) and having a &quot;low face&quot;. Despite similarities their languages were completely different. The Chono moved around in the area from Chiloé Archipelago to 50° S and the Kawésqar from 46° S to the Strait of Magellan. Thus both groups overlapped in Gulf of Penas, Guayaneco Archipelago and other islands. Yaghans inhabited a reduced area south of Tierra del Fuego. Both Chonos and Kawésqar used &quot;Pilgerodendron uviferum&quot; as firewood as well as wood for rows, boats and houses.

Guaitecas Archipelago made up the southern limit of Pre-Hispanic agriculture as noted by the mention of the cultivation of potatoes by a Spanish expedition in 1557.

===Colonial era ===
Pedro de Valdivia sought originally to conquer all of southern South America to the Straits of Magellan (53° S). He did however only reach Reloncaví Sound (41°45&#x27; S). Later in 1567 Chiloé Archipelago (42°30&#x27; S) was conquered, from there on southern expansion of the Spanish Empire halted. The Spanish are thought to have lacked incentives for further conquests south. The indigenous populations were scarce and had ways of life that differed from the sedentary agricultural life the Spanish were accostumed to. The harsh climate in the fjords and channels of Patagonia may also have deterred further expansion. Indeed, even in Chiloé did the Spanish encounter difficulties to adapt as their attempts to base the economy on gold extraction and a &quot;hispanic-mediterranean&quot; agricultural model failed.

During colonial times, the fjords and channels of Patagonia were first explored by the Spaniards. There were a number of motivations for their explorations, including a desire to Christianize indigenous peoples, to prevent intrusions of foreign powers into territory claimed by Spain, to increase geographic knowledge of the zone, and finally, to search for a mythical city called City of the Caesars. False rumours of European settlements near the Straits of Magellan led the Spanish to organize the Antonio de Vea expedition of 1675–1676 which was the largest expedition to the date. In 1792, the viceroy of Peru ordered the exploration of the Patagonian channels in order to find an entrance to the interior of Patagonia. The said order was carried of by José de Moraleda who led an expedition that visited many of the main channels of the zone.

Following the decline of the Chono populations in the archipelago in the 18th century, the area gained a reputation of &quot;emptyness&quot; among Chileans akin to the description of eastern Patagonia as a &quot;desert.&quot; However, the islands were often visited and traversed in the 19th century by fishermen, lumberjacks, and hunters from Chiloé. This makes it clear that many areas that were traversed by explorers were already known to the inhabitants of southern Chiloé who visited these areas for wood, fish or hunting.

Over-all the physical infrastructure of the Spanish in the fjords and channels during the colonial period was negligible and consisted of a few chapels built in the 1610s and 1620s and a wooden fortress built in 1750. All these buildings were abandoned after a few years.

===Becoming part of Chile===
The Aysen region was the last to be integrated into the Chile state, long after even the southernmost region of Magallanes and Chilean Antarctica. Its geographical location and transport difficulties explain the lack of interest in the nineteenth century for this region, to the point that no one even thought of colonizing it with immigrants, as happened with the other southern regions.

In 1870, Aysén Fjord was explored by Enrique Simpson onboard the &quot;Chacabuco&quot;, who discovered its usefulness for accessing more inland locations. The exploitation of &quot;Pilgerodendron uviferum&quot; () in the archipelagoe and fjords of Aysén Region contributed to link early economy of the region to Chiloé Archipelago further north.

Following the signing of the Boundary Treaty with Argentina in 1881, European settlers came from the Pampas to the valleys that cross the Andes from east to west. These private efforts led to the uncoordinated creation of cities of Puerto Aysen in 1904 and Balmaceda and Coyhaique in 1917 and 1929, respectively. The oldest town is Melinka, established by the mid-nineteenth century on Ascension Island in the Guaitecas Archipelago.

The indigenous population was sparse. In the insular region, the Guaitecas and Chonos inhabited the Chonos Archipelago. They are believed to have become extinct in the 20th century. In the archipelagos south of the Gulf of Penas and to Tierra del Fuego lived the Alacalufes or Kaweshkar, also fishermen. Both groups were quickly decimated by disease and attacks by settlers in the late 19th century coming from northern and southern Chile and Europe; a great number of the Europeans were from Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the former Yugoslavia, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and the United Kingdom. Large numbers of Russians, Croats, Scots, Welsh, Irish, and Sudeten Germans from present Czech Republic arrived by government invitation and land sale programs to assist in populating southern Chile and to reduce the number of indigenous peoples.

===Culture===
The Aysén region of Chile, represents a cultural exchange mainly between Argentina and the Chiloé Archipelago which form the main settler groups that inhabit the area. The Gaucho is an important symbol of the region shaping the cuisine, dance, and music of Aysén rather than the Huaso of Central Chile. The main difference between the Guacho and Huaso is the former is involved in cattle and sheep herding, while the latter tends to be more oriented around farming. The settler heritage of the region arising from Argentina and Chiloé have also led to a unique dialect of Spanish distinct from Central Chile, especially in the areas along the border with Argentina. It is the blend of these cultures and geographic isolation that make Aysén a region distinct from the national identity of Chile which to a large degree developed around the center of the country.

<doc id="730707" wikidata="Q1070502" url="?curid=730707" title="Shermy">
<text>Shermy is a fictional character from the comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot;, by Charles Schulz. Schulz named him after a friend from high school. When Peanuts made its debut on October 2, 1950, Shermy sat on the curb with another early character, Patty, and spoke the first lines of dialogue, ending with &quot;Good ol&#x27; Charlie Brown ... How I hate him!&quot; which is ironic, considering how he became one of Charlie Brown&#x27;s closest friends, along with Linus van Pelt and Schroeder.

Shermy famously played a shepherd in the holiday television special, &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;.

As &quot;Peanuts&quot; matured, however, Shermy became an extraneous character who was used less and less frequently, until his final appearance in 1969. In a television interview, Schulz said that in the 1950 debut of the strip, it was solely Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and a few minor characters, then showed the first strip, in which the &quot;minor characters&quot; he spoke of were clearly Patty and Shermy. Shermy&#x27;s name first was mentioned on December 18, 1950, making him the last of the original characters to have their name revealed. In Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot;-precursor strip &quot;Li&#x27;l Folks&quot;, a character resembling Shermy went by the name Charlie Brown.

==Personality and characteristics==
Shermy was named after Sherman Plepler, a good friend of Schulz from high school. He was often portrayed as Charlie Brown&#x27;s superior at the things that mattered to Charlie Brown, especially athletics. Shermy&#x27;s first line in the strip was commenting to Patty, &quot;Good ol&#x27; Charlie Brown. ... &quot;How I hate him!&quot;&quot; The relationship between Shermy and Charlie Brown became more neutral, and eventually friendlier, as the strip progressed. Simultaneously, though, Shermy&#x27;s role fairly quickly declined in prominence; even as early as 1952, Shermy was seen significantly less frequently than the other characters in the then-small cast. (Only eight characters appeared in &quot;Peanuts&quot; through 1953: Charlie Brown, Shermy, Patty, Snoopy, Violet, Schroeder, Lucy and Linus.) Nevertheless, by default, Shermy served as Charlie Brown&#x27;s closest friend until Linus grew old enough to fill that role. 

Shermy&#x27;s major physical characteristic was his short, black hair, which he had styled in a crew cut on April 18, 1953, and kept that way thereafter. Shermy sometimes made reference to the fact he seemed doomed to have that look; he complained to Charlie Brown he got a new hairstyle one weekend only to shortly come down with an illness that kept him from attending school. By the time the illness subsided, Shermy&#x27;s hair had returned to its normal look, to which Shermy exclaims &quot;I wasted a good haircut!&quot; in not getting to model it at school. Apparently Schulz was not a big fan of this look, as he once commented that he &quot;disliked&quot; the way he drew Shermy&#x27;s hair, a possible reason for the character being removed. Shermy sometimes was said to play the position of first base on Charlie Brown&#x27;s baseball team and was referred to as the designated hitter in the Sunday strip from March 13, 1977. In at least one early strip (September 29, 1951), Shermy is implied to be the original owner of Snoopy, several years before Charlie Brown was established as the dog&#x27;s owner in 1958. Shermy was sometimes shown as being in a relationship with Patty, who seemed mainly interested in him for his collection of comic books. (an example is present in the strip from November 29, 1950)

Shermy&#x27;s disappearance from the strip was faster and more complete than those of Patty and Violet, who were mostly gone from the series by the late 1960s; as early as late 1952, his appearances were becoming noticeably rare because of the success of newly introduced characters Lucy and Linus. And in later strips, he is seen as the bystander of jokes and sometimes consults Charlie Brown at the wall when he is feeling low. In 1968, his remaining role as straight man was effectively overtaken by Franklin.

==Movies and television specials==
Shermy appears in multiple animated &quot;Peanuts&quot; TV specials (although he becomes more of a minor character after the 1960s), beginning with &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; in 1965, where he has one line of dialogue. Upon being cast as a shepherd in the gang&#x27;s Christmas pageant, he laments being typecast: &quot;Every Christmas it&#x27;s the same: I always end up playing a shepherd.&quot; His appearances also include (sometimes with dialogue and sometimes without) &quot;Charlie Brown&#x27;s All-Stars&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re in Love, Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Not Elected, Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;Is This Goodbye, Charlie Brown?&quot;, &quot;Why, Charlie Brown, Why?&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Spring Training, Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;It Was My Best Birthday Ever, Charlie Brown&quot;, and &quot;I Want a Dog for Christmas, Charlie Brown&quot; with the latter eight being produced several years after he had disappeared from the comic strip. Shermy is mentioned briefly in the musical &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot; in the song &quot;The Doctor Is In,&quot; but does not appear or have a speaking part; and he makes appearances in three feature films, including &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;, as well as a cameo appearance in &quot;Snoopy Come Home&quot;.

Shermy is seen several times in &quot;The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show&quot; and mentioned by name in Episode 13 from television (as seen on the &quot;Go Snoopy Go!&quot; DVD). Interestingly enough, despite being one of Charlie Brown&#x27;s best friends, he was largely only seen hanging out or even interacting with Charlie Brown in &quot;It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown&quot; (although he is somewhat nicer than everyone else when he is quitting the baseball team in Charlie Brown&#x27;s All-Stars, where he says, &quot;Sorry, Charlie Brown, but I guess I&#x27;ll quit too, I&#x27;m the kind who needs to win now and then. With you it&#x27;s different. I think you get sort of a neurotic pleasure out of losing all the time,&quot; but that technically does not count) in which he tells Charlie Brown about the canoe race and tells him he only got a few feet from the dock, and then Charlie Brown talks to him at the boys&#x27; camp while they wonder who can beat the girls&#x27; camp in a challenge.

In the 2008 &quot;Peanuts Motion Comics&quot; videos, Shermy appears in a couple episodes, without dialogue, as well as WildBrain&#x27;s Peanuts animations.

Shermy returned to the animated specials in the 2011 Direct-to-DVD &quot;Happiness Is A Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown&quot;, which includes a scene based on the very first &quot;Peanuts&quot; strip, where Shermy notes how much he hates Charlie Brown to Patty. He also plays a supporting role in the 2015 animated film &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot;, where his last name is revealed to be Plepler. It is shown in the same movie that he has a younger sister, and there was no mention of one in the strips or TV specials.

==Final appearance==
Shermy&#x27;s last actual appearance in a Peanuts strip came on June 15, 1969. Schulz expressed no regrets at dropping Shermy from the cast, remarking many years later that it had gotten to the point by then where he used Shermy only in situations where he &quot;needed a character with very little personality.&quot; A character similar to him appears in the top right panel of a Sunday strip from November 9, 1975, but was never confirmed to be him. Shermy was referred to by name a few times after 1969; in the March 13, 1977 strip where Charlie Brown and Lucy are discussing players on their baseball team, Shermy is mentioned as the team&#x27;s designated hitter, instead of being in the position of first base like the strips prior.

<text>Saunders Island () is the fourth largest of the Falkland Islands, lying north west of West Falkland. The island is run as a sheep farm.

The island has an area of and a coastline of . It is about from east to west and almost that distance from north-east to south-west. It consists of three peninsulas linked by narrow necks, and it has three large upland areas. The highest point, Mount Richards, is high.

==History==
Port Egmont on the island was the site of the first British settlement, established in 1765.

Unaware of the French presence at Port Louis, in January 1765, British captain John Byron explored and claimed Saunders Island, at the western end of the Falkland Islands, where he named the harbour of Port Egmont, and sailed near other islands, which he also claimed for King George III. A British settlement was built at Port Egmont in 1766. Also in 1766, Spain acquired the French colony, and after assuming effective control in 1767, placed the islands under a governor subordinate to Buenos Aires.

During the Falkland Crisis of 1770, five Spanish frigates entered the port and the small British force had to surrender. This edged Britain and Spain closer to war. In 1771, Spain agreed to abandon Port Egmont to the British. In 1776, for economic reasons, the British abandoned Port Egmont. At that time, they placed a plaque at the site proclaiming their sovereignty over the Falklands. The island&#x27;s present settlement, Saunders Island Settlement, lies on the east coast and has an airstrip.

There is one listed building here, known as the Stone House. There are permanent structures outside the Settlement with heat, electricity and running water for the island&#x27;s tourist industry. There is a building that holds eight guests at the Neck and an additional building that holds four guests called the Rookery Inn. The island is currently owned by the Pole-Evans family that maintains the farm at the Settlement.

==Conservation==
Conservation issues include the danger of fire, some erosion prone areas near the coast, overgrazing and the presence of feral cats, mice, rats and rabbits. Clearance of these introduced species is unlikely in the near future because of the size of the island and the varied geography. Spear thistle, accidentally introduced to the island, is a problem; volunteers from Falklands Conservation continue to help control the infestation and there are hopes that the plant can eventually be eradicated. There is a small breeding colony of southern elephant seals at Elephant Point, while a few southern right whales come into bays to rest or feed.

===Important Bird Area===
Saunders Island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). Birds for which the site is of conservation significance include Falkland steamer ducks (250 breeding pairs), ruddy-headed geese, king penguins, gentoo penguins (6700 pairs), southern rockhopper penguins (6900 pairs), magellanic penguins (4200 pairs), black-browed albatrossess (11,000 pairs) and white-bridled finches. The island is near the southernmost range limit of the Magellanic penguin, while gentoos range much further south into Antarctica. The island also supports near threatened striated caracaras, who closely associate with the abundant seabird colonies at the island&#x27;s primary isthmus during austral summer. The Royal Air Force Ornithological Society&#x27;s members conducted a complete coastal survey in 1995.

<text>Hope Is Important is the debut studio album by Scottish rock band Idlewild, released 26 October 1998 through Food Records. After finalizing their line-up and releasing two singles in 1997, the band released their mini album &quot;Captain&quot; in early 1998. Afterwards, the band signed with Food Records, and recorded their debut album between February and June 1998 at Chapel Studios in Lincolnshire and Westland Studios in Dublin with producer Paul Tipler. Described as a grunge and punk rock album, &quot;Hope Is Important&quot; was compared to &quot;Bleach&quot; (1989) by Nirvana.

&quot;A Film for the Future&quot; and &quot;Everyone Says You&#x27;re So Fragile&quot; were released as the album&#x27;s first two singles on 27 April 1998 and 6 July 1998, respectively. They were followed with some festival performances and a tour with labelmates Blur. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;I&#x27;m a Message&quot;, was released on 12 October 1998. Early in 1999, the band went on tour in the UK. On February 5, 1999, the band released the album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;When I Argue I See Shapes.&quot;

&quot;Hope Is Important&quot; received generally favourable reviews from music critics, some of whom praised the songwriting and Idlewild&#x27;s energy. The album charted at number 44 in Scotland, and number 53 in the UK; it was also certified silver in the UK. All of the songs appeared on the Scottish and UK Singles Charts, with &quot;When I Argue I See Shapes&quot; charting the highest at number 15 in Scotland, and number 19 in the UK. &quot;Hope Is Important&quot; appeared on a best-of-the-year album list by &quot;NME&quot;, as well as a best Scottish albums list by &quot;The Herald&quot;.

==Background and production==
Roddy Woomble lived in Greenville, South Carolina, USA, between the ages of 13 and 15, where his music taste assimilated various punk and alternative rock albums. Upon moving to Scotland, he wanted to start a band that emulated the sound of those releases. In late 1995, Idlewild formed in Edinburgh, with its initial line-up consisting of Woomble on vocals, Rod Jones on guitar, Phil Scanlon on bass, and Colin Newton on drums. After a year of touring, the band released their debut single, &quot;Queen of the Troubled Teens&quot;, in March 1997 through local label Human Condition. The band parted ways with Scanlon and replaced him with Bob Fairfoull. As &quot;Queen of the Troubled Teens&quot; received attention from media outlets, the band signed with Fierce Panda Records. With this label, the band released their next single &quot;Chandelier&quot; in December 1997. The band released the mini album &quot;Captain&quot; in January 1998; it was intended as a single for Deceptive Records before becoming a mini album.

Around this time, the members had abandoned plans for university or employment to focus on the band full-time, and Bruce Craigie became the band&#x27;s manager. Publicity from their live performances, which included tours with Midget and the Warm Jets, resulted in the band signing with Food Records. &quot;Hope Is Important&quot; was recorded in several separate sessions throughout 1998: 8–12 February and 5–17 April at Chapel Studios in Lincolnshire, and 9–22 June at Westland Studios in Dublin. Tipler produced the sessions, and mixed the recordings in July 1998 at Matrix Wessex in London. They were assisted at Chapel by James Anderson, at Westland by Dave Slevin, and at Wessex by Andrew Nicolls. Woomble that the album was recorded &quot;in stages&quot; as the band&#x27;s label wanted them to tour as much as they could: &quot;So rather than laterally we would record an album in one go, or two gos, we kind of did bits and pieces all through that year until the album was done.&quot;

==Composition and lyrics==
Musically, the sound of &quot;Hope Is Important&quot; has been described as grunge and punk rock, with influence from indie rock, drawing comparison to &quot;Bleach&quot; (1989) by Nirvana. Woomble said the album&#x27;s title could be interpreted as &quot;either the most positive thing you could ever say or the vaguest statement you could ever make&quot;. Half of the tracks were written in 1997, with the remainder being done in the opening months of 1998. Author Andy Greenwald said the album switched between &quot;minute-long punk screamfests&quot; and &quot;string-laden melodic odes&quot;. In 2008, Woomble viewed it as an &quot;incomplete album&quot; due to its sound of an artist that is &quot;split between their past and future and with barely any studio experience to document it properly&quot;.

The album opens with the hardcore punk song &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost Your Way&quot;, an earlier version of which was sung by Jones. Woomble said it was a fair representation of the band&#x27;s live performances from the time period due to its abrasive and upbeat sound. &quot;A Film for the Future&quot; was cited by Woomble as an example of Jones and Fairfoull &quot;working together to make a better rock song&quot;, and how it detailed the little interest he had in his film studies at university. &quot;Paint Nothing&quot; evokes the sound of Talking Heads, and mixed jangle pop with distortion. The song talks about the times the band used to visit the club The Egg during the Britpop era, a period that Woomble disliked. The band, sans Woomble, wrote &quot;When I Argue I See Shapes&quot;; they attempted to pay tribute to Pavement. Woomble came up with its lyrics, which were influenced by arguments he was having with his girlfriend, at their rehearsal space in Tollcross, Edinburgh.

Woomble had been in pub bands prior to Idlewild, many of whom styled themselves after the Velvet Underground. &quot;4 People Do Good&quot; was written as a reaction to those acts, as all he &quot;really wanted to do was rock out&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m Happy to Be Here Tonight&quot; is an acoustic song that was compared to R.E.M. Its title paraphrases Andy Warhol&#x27;s catchphrase, which he would say after arriving at a party. Woomble said the band were concerned &quot;Everyone Says You&#x27;re So Fragile&quot; would get them shoehorned into the UK pop-punk scene, with the likes of Midget, Snug, and Symposium, despite the song being considered a throwaway. The song was influenced by underground American indie rock bands they were listening to, such as Archers of Loaf. Magnapop, and Superchunk. Woomble said &quot;I&#x27;m a Message&quot; was simply a &quot;great little pop song&quot;.

The lo-fi track &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have the Heart&quot; was one of the last tracks written for the album. The band tried to emulate the Jesus Lizard with the song&#x27;s chorus sections. Justine Frischmann of Elastica was scheduled to sing during the verses, but had to cancel due to issues with her tonsils. As a result, the band brought in Salli Carson, who did administrative work at Deceptive Records. &quot;Close the Door&quot;, another lo-fi song, features the lyric &quot;barbecue lungs&quot;, which was a reference to the amount of cigarettes the band were smoking. Ken Rice, a school teacher from Dublin, plays violin on &quot;Safe and Sound&quot;. Its title was taken from a bridge that had been graffitied on the M6 motorway. The album closes with another hardcore punk track, &quot;Low Light&quot;. When played live, it would often stretch to over ten minutes in length. Tipler, who had seen the band live several times, decided to tackle the song from a live perspective. He had the band play live-in-the-studio after drinking several beverages.

==Release==
&quot;A Film for the Future&quot; was released as a single on 27 April 1998 with &quot;Mince Showercap (Part 1)&quot; and &quot;What Am I Going to Do?&quot;, which was followed by the band performing at the Glastonbury Festival. &quot;Everyone Says You&#x27;re So Fragile&quot; was released as a single on 6 July 1998 with &quot;Mince Showercap (Part 2)&quot; and &quot;Theory of Achievement&quot;. Additional performances at other festivals, and a stint with labelmates Blur followed. &quot;I&#x27;m a Message&quot; was released as a single on 12 October 1998; two versions were released on CD: the first included &quot;Mince Showercap (Part 3)&quot; and &quot;This Is Worse&quot;, while the second also had radio session versions of &quot;Satan Polaroid&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost Your Way&quot;. Music videos for &quot;A Film for the Future&quot;, &quot;Everyone Says You&#x27;re So Fragile&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m a Message&quot; were directed by Berg.

&quot;Hope Is Important&quot; was released on 26 October 1998 through Food Records. To promote the release, the band supported Ash on their European tour. In January and February 1999, the band toured the UK as part of the NME Premier Tour with Unkle, Delakota, and the Llama Farmers. A re-recorded version of &quot;When I Argue I See Shapes&quot; was released as a single on 1 February 1999. Two versions were released on CD: the first with a cover of &quot;Palace Flophouse&quot; (1999) by Peeps into Fairyland and a re-recorded version of &quot;Chandelier&quot;, while the second featured the album version of &quot;When I Argue I See Shapes&quot;, alongside &quot;(1903-70)&quot; and a live version of &quot;Last Night I Missed All the Fireworks&quot;. The music video for &quot;When I Argue I See Shapes&quot; was directed by filmmaker duo James and Alex. In March 1999, the band performed at the Bowlie Weekender. &quot;Hope Is Important&quot; was released in the United States on 12 October 1999 through Odeon and Capitol Records.

&quot;Hope Is Important&quot; was played in full in December 2008 at King Tut&#x27;s Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow as part of a series of shows where the band performed all of their albums. It was released as a two-CD package with their second studio album &quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; in 2002. &quot;When I Argue I See Shapes&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m a Message&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s first compilation album, &quot;Scottish Fiction: Best of 1997–2007&quot; (2007), alongside the music videos for all of the album&#x27;s singles. &quot;When I Argue I See Shapes&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Happy to Be Here Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Everyone Says You&#x27;re So Fragile&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s third compilation album, &quot;The Collection&quot; (2010).

==Reception==
===Critical response===

&quot;Hope Is Important&quot; was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer Mike Flaherty said the band of &quot;pop craftsmen [were] more mature than four years together would indicate, gilding sophisticated pop tunesmanship with a ragged indie edge&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; Jim Wirth wrote that the album had a &quot;proper pop sensibility&quot; that was &quot;alive with imaginative twists and the sort of impenetrable lyrics that made early Manics singles so special&quot;. In a review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote that the band were &quot;sometimes lyrical, sometimes heavy, mostly headlong, less confused than the people they write to and about&quot;. The staff at &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot; said the album is &quot;one of those records that just grabs you&quot;, with the band able to &quot;truly transcend their inspirations and create music which sounds truly original&quot;. &quot;Ink 19&quot; writer David Lee Beowülf saw it as &quot;schizophrenic&quot;, but also &quot;pretty darn hard and punk&quot;, which Christina Apeles of &quot;Consumable Online&quot; agreed with.

AllMusic reviewer MacKenzie Wilson said the album &quot;exudes the fiery nature of four young guys yearning to make their own way in modern rock despite the popularity of the three-chord riff&quot;. She said the lyrics were not as poetic as they would be on the band&#x27;s second studio album &quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; (2000), &quot;[b]ut it&#x27;s there, and it&#x27;s enjoyably humorous&quot;. In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Chris Ryan said the album is &quot;very much a love letter to their favorite bands&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; joint writers Beatty and Garrett noted the short timeframe of recording, leading to the album coming across as &quot;immediate and desperate&quot;, with some of the songs that would have been discarded otherwise &quot;deposited onto the album as filler&quot;.

===Commercial performance and accolades===
&quot;Hope Is Important&quot; peaked at number 44 in Scotland, and number 53 in the UK. &quot;A Film for the Future&quot; charted at number 39 in Scotland, and number 53 in the UK. &quot;Everyone Says You&#x27;re So Fragile&quot; charted at number 42 in Scotland, and number 47 in the UK. &quot;I&#x27;m a Message&quot; charted at number 31 in Scotland, and number 41 in the UK. &quot;When I Argue I See Shapes&quot; charted at number 15 in Scotland, and number 19 in the UK. &quot;Hope Is Important&quot; was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry.

&quot;Hope Is Important&quot; was included in a list of writers&#x27; favourite Scottish albums by &quot;The Herald&quot;, where journalist Martin Williams described it as &quot;a startling explosion of singalong hooks, soft-loud dynamics and crashing guitars&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at number 33 on their list of the top 50 albums of the year. Mastersystem have cited it and &quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; as influences on their debut album &quot;Dance Music&quot; (2018).

<text>Kempele is a municipality south of the city of Oulu and south of the Oulu Airport in Northern Finland. Historically it was in the province of Oulu, but today it is in the region of North Ostrobothnia. The population of Kempele is () and the municipality covers an area of (excluding sea), of which is inland waters (). The population density is (). The municipality of Kempele was founded in 1867.

Kempele is the birthplace of former NHL goaltender Pekka Rinne.

The neighbouring municipalities are Liminka, Oulu and Tyrnävä.

==History==
Kempele was first permanently settled about 500 years ago, at a time when the coastline was closer than it is today. Kempele was considered part of Greater Liminka and consisted of only three houses in 1568, when it was called Kempele for the first time in official records. In 1774 full church privileges were granted to Kempele, which meant separation from Liminka and establishment as an autonomous parish. The municipal government was established in 1867.

==Sights==

The old church of Kempele, which was built between 1688 and 1691, is one of the oldest wooden churches in Finland. Kempele was granted the right to build a prayer room in 1688, but parishioners decided to construct a church with a steeple. Given the custom of burying local notables under the church, there are about 150 graves in the crypt, the last of them dating from 1796. The church includes decorations by the noted Finnish painter Mikael Toppelius.

The old church ceased to be in active use after a new church was built next to it in the 1990s, but some events are still held in it from time to time.

Kempele may be best known for being the headquarters of the world-famous heart rate monitor corporation Polar Electro, which first brought the device to market in 1978.

==Sports==
The men&#x27;s pesäpallo club Kempeleen Kiri competes in the Superpesis national league, playing at Sarkkiranta Stadium.

<text>46 Hestia is a large, dark main-belt asteroid. It is also the primary body of the Hestia clump, a group of asteroids with similar orbits.

Hestia was discovered by N. R. Pogson on 16 August 1857, at the Radcliffe Observatory, Oxford. Pogson awarded the honour of naming it to William Henry Smyth, the previous owner of the telescope used for the discovery. Smyth chose to name it after Hestia, Greek goddess of the hearth. This created a problem in Greek, where 4 Vesta also goes by the name &quot;Hestia&quot;.

The computed Lyapunov time for this asteroid is 30,000 years, indicating that it occupies a chaotic orbit that will change randomly over time because of gravitational perturbations of the planets.

Hestia has been studied by radar. 13-cm radar observations of this asteroid from the Arecibo Observatory between 1980 and 1985 were used to produce a diameter estimate of 131 km. In 1988 a search for satellites or dust orbiting this asteroid was performed using the UH88 telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories, but the effort came up empty.

==Properties==
Photometric observations made in 2012 at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico produced a light curve with a period of 21.040 ± 0.001 hours. There are two brightness minima, having luminosity variations of 0.05 and 0.12 in magnitude, respectively.

In 2000, Michalak estimated Hestia to have a mass of 3.5 kg.

Even though Hestia is only about 124 km in diameter, in 1997, Bange and Bec-Borsenberger estimated Hestia as having a mass of 2.1 kg, based on a perturbation by 19 Fortuna. This older 1997 estimate would give it a density of 14+ g/cm3 and make Hestia more massive than several much larger asteroids.
