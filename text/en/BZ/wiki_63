<text>Edward Martyn (30 January 1859 – 5 December 1923) was an Irish playwright and early republican political and cultural activist, as the first president of Sinn Féin from 1905–1908.

==Early life==
Martyn was the elder son of John Martyn of Tullira Castle, Ardrahan and Annie Mary Josephine (née Smyth) of Masonbrook, Loughrea, both of County Galway. He succeeded his father upon John&#x27;s death in 1860. He was educated at Belvedere College, Dublin, and Wimbledon College, London, both Jesuit schools, after which he entered Christ Church, Oxford in 1877, but left without taking a degree in 1879. His only sibling, John, died in 1883. 

==Patron of the Arts==

Martyn began writing fiction and plays in the 1880s. While his own output was undistinguished, he acquired a well-earned reputation as a noted connoisseur of music, both European classical and Irish traditional. He was a fine musician in his own right, giving memorable performances for guests on an organ he had installed at Tullira. Martyn used his wealth to benefit Irish culture. His activities and sponsorships included:
* foundation of the Palestrina Choir (the resident choir at the St Mary&#x27;s Pro-Cathedral, Dublin) in 1903
* funding and direction of St. Brendan&#x27;s Cathedral, Loughrea
* co-founder and endowing of the Feis Ceoil 
* president of Na hAisteoirí, the Irish-language drama group 
* sponsored and guided An Túr Gloine, Ireland&#x27;s first stained-glass workshop 
* sponsored the Irish Theatre, Thomas MacDonagh&#x27;s theatre (1914–1916) presenting European and Irish-language work in Countess Plunkett&#x27;s hall in Hardwicke Street

==The Irish Literary Theatre==
Martyn was reportedly pivotal in introducing William Butler Yeats and Lady Gregory to each other in 1896. The three founded the Irish Literary Theatre, for whom Martyn wrote his best and most popular plays &quot;The Heather Field&quot; and &quot;A Tale of a Town&quot;. He covered the costs of the company&#x27;s first three seasons, which proved crucial to establishing the company and the future of the Abbey Theatre. He later parted ways with Yeats and Gregory, something he later regretted, but remained on warm terms with Lady Gregory till the end of his life.

==George Moore==

Martyn was a cousin and friend to George Moore (1852–1933). The two, both lifelong bachelors, made frequent trips all over Europe, where Moore influenced Martyn&#x27;s views on modern art, which resulted in the latter purchasing several works by Degas, Monet, Corot and Utamaro (all later donated to the National Gallery of Ireland). The two attended performances at Bayreuth, as Martyn was a devotee of Wagner.

Their relationship was often antagonistic. Moore wrote an insightful account of Martyn in his &quot;Hail and Farewell&quot;. He did not share Martyn&#x27;s fenian ideas nor espousal of violent means to achieve national sovereignty. The cousins&#x27; political differences eventually drove their friendship apart. In later years they were no longer on speaking terms.

==Republicanism==

Martyn was descended from Richard Óge Martyn (c. 1604 – 1648), a leading Irish Confederate, and Oliver Óge Martyn (c.1630 – c.1709), a Jacobite who fought in the Williamite War in Ireland. Yet by his lifetime, the family were unionists. Martyn&#x27;s outlook began to change in the 1880s after studying Irish history, as well as living through the events of the Irish Land War. He came out as an Irish republican when he famously refused to allow &quot;God Save The Queen&quot; to be sung after a dinner party at Tullira.

By this stage he was involved with the political work of Maud Gonne and Arthur Griffith, and was a vocal opponent of the visit of Queen Victoria to Ireland in 1897. He also protested the visit by Edward VII in 1903, this time as chairman of the People&#x27;s Protection Committee. He was the first president of Sinn Féin from 1905-08 (the party only taking that name in the latter year). In 1908, he resigned from the party and politics in general to concentrate on writing and his other activities. He became close friends with Griffith, funding the publication of the latter&#x27;s &quot;The Resurrection of Hungary&quot; in 1904. 

In 1906, he was at the centre of a well-publicised court case over an off-the-cuff remark that any Irishman who joined the British Army should be flogged. This led to his suspension by the Kildare Street Club, of which he was a member. The court case was resolved in his favour. Martyn stated that he only pursued the case to continue membership as it served the best caviar in Dublin. 

He was on close personal terms with Thomas MacDonagh, Joseph Mary Plunkett and Patrick Pearse, and deeply mourned their executions in the aftermath of the Easter Rising. A parish hall and church that he founded at Labane, near Tullira, were burned by the Black and Tans. He supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921.

==Death==

Martyn died at Tullira on 5 December 1923, aged 64, after years of ill health. Friends and family were shocked at a provision in his will that directed that his body be donated for the use of medical science and, after dissection, be buried in an unmarked pauper&#x27;s grave. The Palestrina Choir sang at his graveside. His papers he bequeathed to the Carmelites of Clarendon Street in Dublin, who subsequently misplaced and lost them. Portraits of Martyn exist by, among others, John Butler Yeats and Sarah Purser. On his death the senior line of the Martyn family died out. His property was inherited by his cousins, the Smyths of Masonbrook and Lord Hemphill. Tullira was sold by the latter forty years later changing ownership several times since.

==Extracts from Lady Gregory&#x27;s Journals==
* Sunday 25 September 1921 (pp. 294–95) – &quot;And in the afternoon we drove to Tillyra, and Edward sent them [Anne and Catherine, Lady Gregory&#x27;s granddaughters] into the Castle with Owen, and let them play the organ in the hall and gave us tea and was very pleasant, thought Catherine very like Velasquez Prince on horseback; approves of my keeping on Coole but thinks I have great courage. He is not very hopeful of a settlement, but he is never hopeful, but he praises the leaders, De V. and McNeill and Barton especially. And indeed one feels more pride in being represented by them in England than by the British Cabinet in Europe! He says George Moore is really angry about Miss Mitchell&#x27;s life of him, and told him &quot;Boyd is to do the official life&quot;; but Edward says &quot;that will make no difference, Miss Mitchell&#x27;s will always be the real one accepted, she took the only possible way of dealing with you, treating you as Mon ami Moore. Edward is sorry he didn&#x27;t build a Theatre twenty years ago, and &quot;put the key in his pocket.&quot; ... He is anxious about money, has fears of his investment in the English railways, and is very crippled with rheumatism.&quot;
* 14 January 1922 (pp. 323–324) – &quot;On the way to the Abbey Theatre, over the Bridge, there was a great crowd, I asked what was going on and a young man said &quot;It&#x27;s the Tans ... – on their departure! ... I had been to see Edward Martyn in the afternoon in his warm little flat; very crippled, but more cheerful than I had seen him for a long time at the exit of the Tans. He is all for the Treaty and blames De Valera&#x27;s doings here as much as he had admired them in America. He will listen to no excuse, says &quot;he is jealous of Griffith. I met him in Gort at the time of his Clare election. I was doing my marketing and he and another had come to hold a meeting there, and I talked to them in their motor and I said &#x27;You will get on all right as long as you hold to Griffith and keep him with you&#x27; and I saw a shadow pass across their faces.&quot; ... He says M. Collins made an inspection of the Volunteers all through Ireland before he went on the London mission, and came to the conclusion that we were not in a position to fight. When they brought the signed Treaty back (and this I had heard from others) no one in the Cabinet made an objection. But suddenly some days later De V. sent his protest to the Press.&quot;
* September 1923 (p. 475) – &quot;Edward Martyn had been ill for sometime and on 8 September I wrote to A.W. &quot;On the way back from Galway we got to Tillyra about 6.30. The chauffeur had never been there before and instead of stopping at the hall door drove a little past it, and there, in the bow window of the library I saw Edward sitting. I thought he would turn or look round at the noise but he stayed quite immovable, like a stuffed figure, it was quite uncanny. I rang the bell and Dolan the butler appears, said he was &quot;only pretty well&quot;, but showed me into the drawing room, and came back to say Edward would like to see me. I went in; he did not turn his head, gazed before him. I touched his hands (one could not shake them – all crippled, Dolan says he has to be fed) and spoke to him. He slowly turned his eyes but apparently without recognition. I went on talking without response till I asked if he had any pain and he whispered &quot;No – thank God&quot;. I didn&#x27;t know if he knew me, but talked a little, and presently he whispered &quot;How is Robert?&quot; I said &quot;He is well, as all are in god&#x27;s hands. He has gone before me and before you&quot;. then I said &quot;My little grandson Richard is well&quot;, and he said with difficulty and in a whisper &quot;I am very glad of that&quot;. Then I came away, there was no use staying ... It was a very sad visit. That was the last time I saw Edward Martyn, and I grieve for him.&quot;
* 7 December 1923 (p. 494) – &quot;Yesterday I took the children to a party at Ballyturnin, very merry for them. But I heard of Edward Martyn&#x27;s death, it had taken place that morning. The Doctor told Mr. Bagot a tumour had been taken from his head on Saturday, Dr. McGuinness had come from Dublin for the operation and he [Martyn] lost a good deal of blood. Father O&#x27;Kelly said he had after the operation recognised Father Carr, which he had not done for some time. I asked about the funeral. He said Father Carr told him also he had bequeathed his body to the Dublin doctors &quot;in the interests of science&quot; so it may probably be in Dublin. ... I feel a loneliness now he is gone. He was from the beginning of my life here at Coole a good neighbour; he was always grateful for my husband&#x27;s interest in him. He had gone to see Edward at Oxford to advise him not to build that large addition to his old castle, until at least his own taste and opinion were formed; and though the forces were too strong, his mother and her surroundings, he often regretted that he had not the strength of mind to take that advice. He was very kind to Robert, giving him his first real gun and letting him and his friends shoot [at] Tillyra in the holidays. And then, when Yeats&#x27; summers, and the theatre project began, he was constantly here, walking over and staying to dine. It was George Moore who broke that work together, putting his own name on the &quot;Bending of the Bough&quot;, rewritten by him and Yeats but on Edward&#x27;s foundation. And Edward had been weak about The Countess Cathleen, and took a wrong turning I think in withdrawing his support from our Theatre. Of late I was told he felt his support of Sinn Féin in its beginning had been wrong, it was on his conscience. And yet he hated, with a real hatred, England. I always felt there were two natures in him, the old blood of the Martyns and the blood of the Smiths.&quot;
* 11 December 1923 – &quot;Poor Edward. His body has been taken to Dublin to be dissected, by direction of his will. He directed the Dr. should visit it each day till removal to make sure he really was dead. But if he meant by giving it to the School of Medicine to perhaps save some other sufferer from what he has gone through (no doctor seeming to know what was wrong or able to help him) it was a fine thing to do. There is a nice notice of him in &quot;The Times&quot;, better than he would have gained by following his family&#x27;s wishes and settling down to marry and entertain the County.&quot;

<text>A personal unblocking key (PUK), sometimes called personal unblocking code (PUC), is used in SIM cards to reset a personal identification number (PIN) that has been lost or forgotten.

Most mobile phones offer the feature of PIN protection. After switching on the phone, if the PIN security function is active, the user is required to enter a 4-8 digit PIN to unlock the SIM card and connect to the mobile network. Without this, functions such as phone calls (except for emergency calls), text messages and mobile data will not be available. If the wrong PIN is entered more than three times, the SIM card will become locked. It can be unlocked by entering the PUK code provided by the mobile service provider, which may be available on the SIM card&#x27;s packaging, the contract, or provided by customer service after identity verification. After the PUK code is entered, the PIN must be reset. If the wrong PUK is entered ten times in a row, the SIM card will become permanently blocked and unrecoverable, requiring a replacement or, in rare cases, can be recovered by the provider when the PUK code is forgotten. Mobile phone users are therefore advised by most providers to keep their PUK written down in a safe place separate from the device.

<doc id="744102" wikidata="Q1760800" url="?curid=744102" title="Pit River">
<text>The Pit River is a major river draining from northeastern California into the state&#x27;s Central Valley. The Pit, the Klamath and the Columbia are the only three rivers in the U.S. that cross the Cascade Range.

The longest tributary of the Sacramento River, it contributes as much as eighty percent of their combined water volume into the Shasta Lake reservoir; the junction of their Shasta Lake arms is northeast of Shasta Dam. The main stem of the Pit River is long, and some water in the system flows to the Sacramento River measuring from the Pit River&#x27;s longest source.
The Pit River drains a sparsely populated volcanic highlands area in Modoc County&#x27;s Warner Mountains, passing through the south end of the Cascade Range in a deep canyon northeast of Redding. The river is so named because of the semi-subterranean permanent winter homes and large &#x27;sweat houses&#x27; that the Pit River Tribe dug, and their pit traps for game that came to water at the river.

The river is a popular destination for fishing, fly fishing, and rafting in its lower reaches, and is used to generate hydroelectricity in the powerhouses below Fall River Mills where the Pit and Fall rivers join, and at Shasta Dam. It is also used extensively for irrigation and conservation purposes.

==Course==

The Pit River rises in several forks in Modoc, Lassen and Shasta counties in the northeastern corner of California. The South Fork Pit River - West Valley Creek - Cedar Creek source originates just southeast of Buck Mountain in the Warner Mountains, in the extreme southeastern corner of the Modoc National Forest west of the California–Nevada border. The South Fork is formed from the confluence of several creeks in Jess Valley northeast of Madeline and flows west through a narrow canyon, past Likely, then generally north through a broad ranching valley where its waters are diverted for irrigation and waterfowl conservation via an extensive system of canals.

The long North Fork - Linnville Creek tributary begins southeast of the town of Davis Creek, near Goose Lake. It flows generally south-southwest, joining the South Fork from the north near Alturas. Although Goose Lake is generally considered the terminal sink of an endorheic basin, it will overflow into the Pit River during floods; however this has not occurred since 1881 due to large diversions of water for agriculture.

The combined river flows west-southwest in a winding course across Modoc County, past Canby and through the Modoc National Forest in the narrow Stonecoal Valley Gorge. It turns south to flow past Lookout and into northern Lassen County, past Bieber, to emerge into the ranching region of Big Valley. North of Little Valley it flows into northeast Shasta County and the Shasta National Forest. Then the river reaches Fall River Valley, where it is joined by the Fall River, which is fed by one of the largest freshwater spring systems in the United States. After passing through the town of Fall River Mills, the river drops over Pit River Falls, then enters the head of a long serpentine canyon that cuts through the southern Cascade Range. It then turns south to join the Sacramento River as the eastern arm of Shasta Lake reservoir, approximately north of Redding. Potem Creek joins the river at Potem Falls. Two major tributaries, Sulanharas Creek and the McCloud River, join the Pit from the north within the lake. The lower of the river forms the longest of the five arms of Shasta Lake, which is formed by Shasta Dam on the Sacramento downstream from the original confluence.

==Hydrology==
Fed by significant volcanic groundwater basins that produce some of the largest contiguous freshwater spring systems in the United States, the middle and lower reaches of the Pit River exhibit a strong year-round flow, in contrast to the highly seasonal nature of most northern California rivers. Before Shasta Dam was built, the Pit contributed as much as 85 percent of the Sacramento River&#x27;s dry-season flow as measured at Red Bluff, nearly downstream of their confluence – making the river an important resource for irrigation, and later, hydroelectricity. The upper reaches of the Pit above Fall River Mills are a snow-fed high desert stream with a much more seasonal hydrograph. The lowermost part (Shasta Lake portion) of the Pit River system receives heavy winter rainfall, which mainly contributes to streamflow between November and April. Nevertheless, summer low water flows rarely drop below .

While conducting surveys for irrigation projects in the early 1900s, the U.S. Reclamation Service (now Bureau of Reclamation) noted that the spring-fed Fall River alone contributed a year-round flow of about , from an aquifer fed in part by Mount Shasta snowmelt. Much of this water rises at what is often called &quot;Thousand Springs&quot; a few miles above Fall River Mills, west of Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park. Hat Creek and Burney Creek, spring-fed from the Lassen Peak area, supplied a further to the Pit River. The aquifers in the Pit River basin may hold as much as in storage and are consistently replenished by winter precipitation seeping through the watershed&#x27;s porous volcanic rocks and soils. The water typically emerges at points of lower elevation where the surface layers encounter harder metamorphic and sedimentary rock.
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) operates a stream gage on the Pit River at Montgomery Creek, directly below Pit 7 Dam and above Shasta Lake. This gage measures streamflow from an area of , or 70 percent of the total watershed. The average streamflow between 1966 and 2012 was , with a maximum of recorded on January 24, 1970, after heavy rainfall. A short minimum flow of occurred on July 12, 1975 due to construction work at Pit 7 Powerhouse requiring temporary cessation of releases. The minimum 7-day flow was , on September 5–12, 1966.

Before the damming of Shasta Lake in the 1940s, the annual flow of the Pit River was about four times the size of the Sacramento at their confluence, making it the true hydrological source of the Sacramento River system. Measured at the mouth, the river&#x27;s natural discharge likely exceeded , a figure which includes the McCloud River and Sulanharas Creek contributing about of additional flow below the Montgomery Creek gage.

The lower course of the Pit River is one of California&#x27;s most significant hydroelectric rivers, not just because of its consistent perennial flow, but because of its steep drop: in the between Fall River Mills and Shasta Lake, the Pit descends some , or a gradient of per mile, which is quite considerable for a river of its size. Because of the dependable flow, large reservoirs are not needed to regulate releases for power generation, unlike other major hydroelectric schemes in California. The combined generating capacity of powerhouses on the river and its tributaries is approximately 770 megawatts. As of 2004, the annual generation from main stem powerhouses is approximately 2.64 billion KWh. Including powerhouses on tributaries, the total rises to 3.67 billion KWh, or approximately 13 percent of California&#x27;s total hydropower.

The first dam on the Pit River proper is Pit 3 Dam, which forms Lake Britton near Burney about downstream from Fall River Mills. Water is diverted via a tunnel to Pit 3 Powerhouse, located on the upper end of Pit 4 Reservoir, formed by Pit 4 Dam. Pit 4 is a much smaller diversion dam, drawing water through a tunnel under Chalk Mountain to Pit 4 Powerhouse on Pit 5 Reservoir. Like Pit 4, Pit 5 is also a small diversion dam with minimal pondage. From here, the water is diverted to an offstream regulating reservoir (Tunnel Reservoir) and then through a tunnel bypassing the Pit River reach known as the &quot;Big Bend&quot; and the eponymous town of Big Bend, to feed Pit 5 Powerhouse. These dams and powerhouses are licensed under the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as the &quot;Pit 3, 4, and 5 Project&quot;, and are operated by Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E)

Below Pit 5 Powerhouse lie two larger concrete arch-gravity dams, Pit 6 and Pit 7. These dams release water directly from the base to generate power, rather than diverting the water through long tunnels. The combined reservoirs flood almost of the Pit River. Flows for these two dams are supplemented by a diversion from the McCloud River, a tributary of the Pit River. Water is diverted from the McCloud River at Lake McCloud about south of Mount Shasta, through a tunnel to Iron Canyon Reservoir, and then through another tunnel to the James B. Black Powerhouse, which outlets into the Pit River on the upper end of Pit 6 Reservoir. These facilities are collectively known as the McCloud-Pit Hydroelectric Project and are also operated by PG&amp;E.

The lowermost of the Pit River are flooded by Shasta Lake, which is formed by Shasta Dam on the Sacramento River about below what was formerly the confluence of the Pit and Sacramento Rivers. Completed in 1945, Shasta is a key component of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation&#x27;s Central Valley Project, a primary source of irrigation water in the Central Valley. The lake also floods parts of two Pit River tributaries, the McCloud River and Sulanharas Creek.

There are also multiple hydroelectric schemes on the Pit River&#x27;s tributaries, such as the Fall River and Hat Creek. The Hat Creek Hydroelectric Project, which consists of two powerhouses on lower Hat Creek built in the early 1920s by Red River Lumber Co., is considered eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The Hat Creek facilities were purchased by PG&amp;E in 1945.

Before environmental regulations enacted in the late 20th and early 21st century, diversions took up to 95 percent of Pit River summer flows, resulting in the dewatering of significant stretches between Fall River Mills and Big Bend. PG&amp;E is now required to maintain base flow in the river at all times, which has led to a reduction in hydroelectric power generation but has greatly improved wildlife habitat and fishing on these sections of the Pit.

==History==
===Native Americans===

The Pit River is located in historical Achomawi territory, who lived in the area expanding from Big Bend to Goose Lake. Human habitation in this region may date back as far as 12,500 years. The Achomawi (consisting of nine distinct bands) had up to 28 villages in the Pit River area and are considered Palaihnihan speakers, along with the neighboring Atsugewi people who lived along southern tributaries of the Pit such as Burney and Hat Creeks, and the Dixie Valley. Because of the sparse resources of the Pit River&#x27;s high desert watershed, most natives lived close to the river and subsisted primarily by hunting and fishing. Achomawi moved between hunting camps in summer, consisting of cone-shaped tents covered with tule, and larger wood-frame pit houses in winter. The Pit River is named for the pitfall traps the Achomawi dug to capture game that drank at the river. The name &quot;Achomawi&quot; derives from a Palaihnihan word meaning &quot;people of the river&quot;.

Achomawi territory was bordered by that of the Klamath and Modoc to the north, the Shasta to the northwest, the Wintun on the west (in the lower Pit and McCloud River valleys), the Yana on the southwest, Maidu to the south, and Paiute to the east. Most of the local tribes have had social and border disputes since ancient times; the Achomawi and Atsugewi were historically subject to raids by the Klamath and the Modoc who would take prisoners to sell as slaves at The Dalles, Oregon – then a major Native American trading hub on the Columbia River, more than to the north.

In the early 1800s, armed with horses and firearms obtained by trading with Europeans, the Paiute launched a full-scale attack on the Achomawi, with one raid killing between 200 and 300 people in a camp near modern Fall River Mills. Following this, the Achomawi and other western tribes formed a temporary confederation against the Paiute. After successfully driving off a Paiute attack the next year, a peace treaty was signed. However, in the 1850s tensions grew between the Achomawi and the Modoc, leading to armed conflicts that continued for over twenty years. Despite multiple attempts by leaders on both sides to make peace, &quot;each time the truce was soon broken by irresponsible young fellows whom the chiefs could not control.&quot;

===Conflict with Europeans===
Native peoples also grew hostile towards Euro-American settlers and traders, who entered the region in great numbers beginning in the mid-19th century, especially during and after the California Gold Rush in 1848. There was little conflict at first with outsiders who were just passing through the area on their way to the Sacramento Valley. However, after white Americans settled near Fall River, conflict broke out. After initial skirmishes, soldiers led by US general George Crook arrived in the area. The natives negotiated a temporary truce with Crook, in the form of a gift of a large number of furs. This was broken the next year, when two settlers were killed by Atsugewi for an unknown reason. In retaliation, a band of white men attacked a native camp at Beaver Creek (near present-day Pittville) killing 160 people, mostly women and children.
The military Pitt River Expeditions against local Indian Tribes occurred during the 1850s. The first expedition in 1850 was mainly an attempt to establish better relations with the indigenous peoples. The second, led by General Crook in 1857, was a military engagement, as the US government decided to forcibly remove the Pit River natives and move them to the Mendocino Indian Reservation (then later the Round Valley Indian Reservation) in Mendocino County. The former enemies of the Achomawi – the Modocs and Klamaths – were also driven out of the region by 1873 with the conclusion of the Modoc War. This is considered to be the point at which the Pit River valley was opened up to large-scale White settlement.

===Irrigation and power===
Due to the arid climate, poor soils and rugged topography of the Pit River basin and northeastern California in general, settlement and development of the region was difficult. Ranching became the primary economic activity, thanks to the expansive seasonal grasslands, along with some mining and logging. Although the lower portions of the Pit River contain abundant water, the western watershed is too mountainous for agriculture. On the other hand, the drier eastern part of the watershed contains a number of flat river valleys with deep alluvial soils. Throughout the early part of the 20th century, about 63 reservoirs were built on tributary streams in this region, to support irrigation. Due to limited and uncertain streamflow from these snowfed desert streams, the amount of farmland in the Pit River system remained small, and water rights were a contentious issue. Some of these disputes were resolved in court in the 1930s, with water allocations now managed by the California Department of Water Resources.
In the early 1900s and 1910s the Pit River was identified by the recently formed Reclamation Service (now Bureau of Reclamation) as the most important water source in the upper Sacramento River system; the river provides not only the majority of the annual flow, but nearly the entire dependable summer water supply. One of the first proposals to dam the Pit River was in 1915 and was known as the &quot;Lower Pit River Project&quot;. A dam would have been built across the river at Sheep Rocks, above the confluence with Sulanharas Creek. About one-quarter of the river&#x27;s flow would be diverted to irrigate some of fertile benchland in the upper Sacramento Valley, east of Redding. The Lower Pit River Project was technically superseded by the Central Valley Project for which Shasta Dam was completed in 1945. Shasta Lake raised the level of the Pit River more than above the elevation of the proposed Sheep Rocks dam. It also flooded the majority of the Wintun peoples&#x27; traditional lands along the Pit and McCloud rivers, still controversial today.

Hydroelectric development of the Pit River system also began early. One of the first major hydroelectric projects was the Hat Creek project, built in 1920 and generating the first power in 1921. The Fall River was developed soon afterwards with a powerhouse coming online by 1922. Pit 3 Dam (Lake Britton) was completed in 1925 and its powerhouse began operation on July 18, 1925. Pit 4 and 5, located further downstream, were completed between the mid-1940s and mid-1950s. The lower Pit River was dammed in the 1960s, forming Reservoirs 6 and 7. A diversion from the McCloud River was also completed during this time to increase water flowing through powerhouses on the Pit River. Pit 2 Powerhouse was planned but never built: due to an error in the topographic maps, the elevation drop between Fall River and Lake Britton, where the powerhouse was to have been situated, was too small for economical power generation.

==Recreation==

The Pit River is a well-known trout stream in northern California and is a popular destination for fishing. The river is notorious for its swift, deep water, slippery bed and low visibility, and is considered difficult and dangerous to wade. Flows are fairly consistent year-round, except after storm events, both due to the natural springs feeding the river and regulation by many hydroelectric dams. Fishing has improved since the 2011 relicensing of several PG&amp;E hydroelectric facilities on the river, which required the power company to increase minimum flows on the formerly dewatered river reaches below Dams 3, 4 and 5, and to monitor the health of fish populations in these reaches. The lower Pit is considered a Blue Ribbon fishery.

The river is also a well-known hiking and sightseeing spot, particularly for people looking for waterfalls and bald eagles. Among the most picturesque spots are Potem Falls.

<doc id="744108" wikidata="Q2383289" url="?curid=744108" title="Porntip Rojanasunan">
<text>Khun Ying Pornthip Rojanasunand, also spelled Porntip Rojanasunan (; ; born 21 December 1954) is a Thai forensic pathologist, a current member of the Senate of Thailand and medical doctor. First appearing in the media in 1998, her work and outlandish hairstyles quickly granted her celebrity status, and she became the best known of Thailand&#x27;s forensic scientists. An author of several best-selling memoirs, her work introduced the Thai public to the role of DNA evidence, among other forensic methods, in crime investigations.

High-profile cases Pornthip was involved in include the murder of Jenjira Ploy-angunsri in 1998, her controversial re-examination of the death of Hangthong Thammawattana in 2003 (which was later disputed by other forensic physicians), and the identification of victims in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami (for which she was both commended and criticised). She frequently criticised the Royal Thai Police over their handling of forensic evidence, and was influential in the establishment of the Central Institute of Forensic Science, which works independently of the police and reports directly to the Ministry of Justice, and of which she served as director.

For her work, Pornthip was awarded the Order of Chula Chom Klao in 2003, granting her the title &quot;Khunying&quot; (equivalent to &quot;Lady&quot;). However, she has also been criticised for using her position for self-promotion, as well as supporting the use of fake GT200 bomb detectors, which became a scandal in 2010. She has also been subjected to several defamation lawsuits due to her comments to the press, and was once put on probation by the Medical Council for revealing case information.

== Early life ==
As a child she had interests in forensics because both of her parents worked in the field. She was sent to an American boarding school, and after finishing boarding school she wanted to be an interior designer. However her father wanted her to become a doctor. Her forensic career started with an internship by studying forensic medicine, and performing autopsies. Pornthip is very proud of her work and that it &quot;ensures her a place in heaven.&quot;

== Government service ==

Graduating from the Faculty of Medicine, Mahidol University, in 1979, Pornthip became a medical officer in the Ministry of Public Health. She held several positions in the Ministry, all dealing with pathology. In 2001, Pornthip was transferred to the Ministry of Justice to hold concurrently the positions of Director of the Medical Division at the Central Youth Detention Centre and Ministerial Spokesman.

She next served as deputy director (9th Class Administrative Officer) of the Central Institute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Justice, since 2003, and was promoted to Director (10th Class Administrative Officer) by Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej in 2008.

Pornthip&#x27;s four-year term as CIFS Director expired in April 2012, and her term was extended for one more year. However, Yingluck Shinawatra&#x27;s Council of Ministers removed her from the office in May 2013. Pornthip was appointed Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice.

Her removal was effective immediately and without any advance notice, while Pornthip was carrying out her official functions in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Pornthip felt her removal was motivated by politics, since some politicians might have been upset with her work. A number of experts agreed with her, citing Pornthip&#x27;s conflicts with the Royal Thai Police, which had caused her and her team to be barred from working in central Thailand and being sent to work in the south instead.

Following the June 2013 murder of Akeyuth Anchanbutr, an outspoken critic of Yingluck&#x27;s government, Pornthip was asked by the public to examine the case. However, she said she no longer had any authority to deal with such cases. Asked about her duties as Inspector General, she said they consisted of &quot;only reviewing official papers&quot;.

== Career ==

Pornthip first attracted widespread media attention when she investigated the murder of Jenjira Ploy-angunsri in 1998. She rapidly became a celebrity pathologist and published a memoir, &quot;Seub Jaak Sop&quot; (&quot;Investigating Corpses&quot;).

After the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, Pornthip supervised the effort to identify the tsunami victims in the Phang Nga region. She and her team were widely praised for their hard work and dedication, but on 13 January 2005 Police General Nopadol Somboonsab complained that the police&#x27;s identification centre in Phuket should have charge of all identification operations. Pornthip attributed the intervention to Nopadol&#x27;s supposed personal vendetta against her. Nopadol was ultimately successful, and the Phang Nga operation was closed down on 3 February 2005. Her life story and her work in Phang Nga were documented in the 2004 &quot;National Geographic&quot; documentary &quot;Crime Scene Bangkok&quot;.

In June 2009, she was one of the pathologists investigating the death of actor David Carradine.

In October 2009, she concluded that Malaysian Democratic Action Party employee Teoh Beng Hock, who had been detained by the Malaysian federal Government&#x27;s Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission had an 80% probability of having been being murdered.

In April 2010, she was appointed to the Center for the Resolution of the Emergency Situation or CRES (previously known as the Centre for the Administration of Public Order), a military organization charged with maintaining peace and order within Bangkok and the surrounding provinces during the massive anti-government protests in 2010. Dozens of protestors were killed and thousands injured in the CRES-ordered crackdown.

Pornthip&#x27;s autobiography, which details her life and most prominent cases, has been translated into English and available through Amazon. In the book, Pornthip reiterates problems with state authorities in obtaining justice for those subject to injustice, a theme carried throughout the book. Frank G Anderson translated the core material for the autobiography.

== Jenjira Ploy-angunsri murder investigation==

After returning from her internship in Bangkok she come back to mystery involving a medical student who was missing for two weeks. The person police suspected to have had committed the crime was another medical student. After being interrogated by police the medical student confessed to the murder and claimed that he had done the crime in a hotel room. After that the Thai police closed the investigation but Rojanasunand had doubts about the story the medical student gave. She then re-interrogated the medical student and he changed his story from the one that he gave to the investigators. Then after her interrogation the government thought that she had made them look bad because of their decision to close the murder case after the first interrogation.

== GT200 &quot;bomb detectors&quot; ==
Pornthip was a vocal and sustained supporter of the GT200, a &quot;remote substance detector&quot; that Pornthip and the UK manufacturer claimed could detect from a distance various substances including explosives and dead bodies. Several nations have found the devices to be fraudulent.

2008 clashes between police and the Peoples Alliance for Democracy resulted in one death and several serious injuries, but much confusion as to whether the injuries were caused by police tear gas grenades or improvised explosive devices carried by the protesters. Pornthip used a GT200 device to conclude that the protester injuries were not caused by explosives and concluded that tear gas grenades caused the injuries, leading to the removal from office of the national police chief. Queen Sirikit later attended the funeral of the fatality.

In the early months of the Democrat-led government of Abhisit Vejjajiva, western news agencies broke the news that up to 1,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar had been captured by the Thai Navy, beaten, then towed out to sea without engines or navigational aids and with little food and water. The scandal and subsequent government cover-up sparked global criticism of the Thai military and Abhisit. The Thai military asked Pornthip to investigate some refugee boats that had landed on Thailand&#x27;s Andaman coast. Pornthip found &quot;substances and chemicals found that can be used in explosives&quot; in one of the boats, leading the military to link the refugees to Islamic insurgency in the South of Thailand.

Large protests against the Democrat-led government were held in Bangkok in 2009, prompting a violent crackdown. Rumours of widespread killings were denied by the government, which pointed to the lack of bodies. When shipping containers rumoured to be filled with skeletons were found sunken off several coastal areas, Pornthip was assigned to help with the forensics. She suggested that rather than opening up the containers, GT200 bomb detectors using dead body &quot;sensor cards&quot; should be used.

When news of the fraudulent nature of the GT200 devices became public in 2010, Pornthip defended the use of the devices, even if they were proven ineffective. She noted, &quot;I do not feel embarrassed if the bomb detector is proven ineffective. Personally, I have never handled the device myself. But my people have used it and it is accurate every time. Long long time ago, people believed that the Earth is flat and anyone who said otherwise faced execution. Things which are not visible does not necessarily mean they do not exist.&quot;

== Media personality ==

A media personality and the most famous pathologist in Thailand, Pornthip often appears on television sporting her unorthodox style: punk-rock hair dyed purplish red, eccentric clothing, and glittery eye makeup, and platform shoes.

The Thai English-language newspaper &quot;The Nation&quot; chose Pornthip, along with Chote Wattanachet and brothel-tycoon Chuwit Kamolvisit as persons of the year for 2003.

She was awarded the Order of Chula Chom Klao (fourth degree) and the honorific &quot;Khunying&quot; in 2003.

Her wax statue has been displayed at Madame Tussauds in Bangkok since 2009, along with the statues of Kukrit Pramoj and Silpa Bhirasri.

<doc id="744113" wikidata="Q148106" url="?curid=744113" title="22 Kalliope">
<text>22 Kalliope (; ) is a large M-type asteroid from the asteroid belt discovered by J. R. Hind on 16 November 1852. It is named after Calliope, the Greek Muse of epic poetry. It is orbited by a small moon named Linus.

==Characteristics==

Kalliope is somewhat elongated, approximately 166 km in diameter, and slightly asymmetric, as evidenced by resolved images taken with the VLT at the European Southern Observatory. This new diameter, which was measured by observing mutual eclipses of Kalliope and Linus, is 8% smaller than that calculated from IRAS observations.

The spectrum of Kalliope is an M-type, indicating that its surface may be partially composed of iron–nickel metal. The asteroid&#x27;s density is about 3.4 g/cm3. Since the asteroid is likely to be a rubble pile, accounting for a possible porosity of 20–40% leads to the material density of 4.2–5.8 g/cm3, which means that Kalliope is probably made of a mixture of metal with silicates. Spectroscopic studies have shown, however, evidence of hydrated minerals and silicates, which indicate rather a stony surface composition. Kalliope also has a low radar albedo, which is inconsistent with a purely metallic surface.

Lightcurve analysis indicates that Kalliope&#x27;s pole most likely points towards ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (−23°, 20°) with a 10° uncertainty, which gives Kalliope an axial tilt of 103°. Kalliope&#x27;s rotation is then slightly retrograde.

Between 2004 and 2021, 22 Kalliope has been observed to occult fifteen stars.

In 2022, it was discovered that 22 Kalliope is part of an asteroid family that formed about 900 million years ago. Its moon, Linus, may have been formed at the same time.

==Satellite==
Kalliope has one known natural satellite, called Linus or (22) Kalliope I Linus. It is quite large about 28 km in diameter and would be a sizeable asteroid by itself. It orbits about 1100 km from the center of Kalliope, equivalent to about 13.2 Kalliope radii. Linus was discovered on 29 August 2001 by Jean-Luc Margot and Michael E. Brown, while another team led by William Merline also independently detected the moon 3 days later.

==First stellar occultation==
On 7 November 2006, the first stellar occultation by the satellite of an asteroid (Linus) was successfully observed by a group of Japanese observers according to a prediction that was made just one day before by Berthier et al. based on more than 5 years of regular observations of Kalliope binary system using adaptive optics systems on ground-based telescopes. The observed chords of Linus give a unique opportunity to estimate the size of the moonlet which was estimated to 20–28 km.

The surname Martyn is common in the West of England, particularly in Devon and Cornwall, where the name spelling could be Martyn, Martin or Marten. In 1543 John Martyn, John Martyn and Joan Martyn are listed with reference to Davidstow (Dewstow) in the &quot;Cornwall Subsidies in the reign of Henry Vlll&quot;. In the 1569 Muster Roll John Marten and William Marten are mentioned for Davidstow. In the Register for St Stephens by Launceston the baptisms are given for two sons of Richard Martin of Dewstowe – Nicholas Martin 24 May 1584 and John Marten 21 November 1586. Dated 27 July 1646 is a Davidstow Administration for John Marten the Elder, late of Davidstow and it is possible that this is the John baptised at St Stephens in 1586.

Notable people with the name include:
* David Forbes Martyn (1906–1970), Scottish-born Australian physicist
* Henry Martyn (1781–1812), Anglican priest and missionary in India and Persia
* John Martyn (disambiguation), several people

<text>150 Nuwa is a large main-belt asteroid with an orbital period of . It was discovered by Canadian-American astronomer James Craig Watson on 18 October 1875, and named after Nüwa, the Chinese creator goddess. This object is a candidate member of the Hecuba group of asteroids that orbit near the 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter. Based upon the spectrum it is classified as a C-type asteroid, which indicates that it is probably composed of primitive carbonaceous chondritic material and the surface is exceedingly dark.

Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Catania Astrophysical Observatory during 1992 and 1993 gave a light curve with a period of 8.140 ± 0.005 hours. In 2004, an additional photometric study was performed at Swilken Brae Observatory in St Andrews, Fife, yielding a probable period of 8.1364 ± 0.0008 hours and a brightness variation of 0.26 ± 0.03 in magnitude. A 2011 study from Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico gave a period of 8.1347 ± 0.0001 hours with a brightness variation of 0.17 ± 0.02 magnitude, which is consistent with prior results.

On 17 December 1999, a star was occulted by Nuwa.

<doc id="744128" wikidata="Q403146" url="?curid=744128" title="Ai (poet)">
<text>Ai Ogawa (born Florence Anthony; October 21, 1947 – March 20, 2010) was an American poet and educator who won the 1999 National Book Award for Poetry for &quot;Vice: New and Selected Poems&quot;. Ai is known for her mastery of the dramatic monologue as a poetic form, as well as for taking on dark, controversial topics in her work. About writing in the dramatic monologue form, she&#x27;s said: &quot;I want to take the narrative &#x27;persona&#x27; poem as far as I can, and I&#x27;ve never been one to do things in halves. All the way or nothing. I won&#x27;t abandon that desire.&quot;

== Early life ==
Ai, who described herself as 1/2 Japanese, 1/8 Choctaw-Chickasaw, 1/4 Black, 1/16 Irish, Southern Cheyenne, and Comanche, was born in Albany, Texas, in 1947, and grew up in Tucson, Arizona. She spent time also in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and San Francisco, living with her mother and second stepfather, Sutton Haynes. In 1959, a couple of years after her mother&#x27;s divorce from Hayes, they moved back to Tucson, Arizona, where she completed high school and attended college at the University of Arizona, where she majored in English and Oriental Studies with a concentration in Japanese and a minor in Creative Writing, to which she would fully commit toward the end of her degree. 

Before starting college, one night during dinner with her mother and third stepfather, Ai learned her biological father was Japanese. Known as Florence Hayes throughout her childhood and undergrad years, it was not until graduate school, when Ai was going to switch her last name back to Anthony, that her mother finally told her more details about her past, learning that she had an affair with a Japanese man, Michael Ogawa, after meeting him at a streetcar stop. Learning of the affair had led Ai&#x27;s first stepfather, whose last name was &quot;Anthony,&quot; to beat her mother until family intervened and she was taken to Texas, where her stepfather eventually followed after Ai&#x27;s birth. Because her mother was still legally married to Anthony at the time, his last name was put on Ai&#x27;s birth certificate. Although she identified as being of Native American descent, she was not enrolled in any Native nation.

The poverty Ai experienced during her childhood affected her and her writing. Ai credits her first writing experience to an assignment in her Catholic school English class to write a letter from the perspective of a martyr. Two years after that experience, she began actively writing at the age of 14. History had been one of her many interests since high school.

== Career ==
From 1969 to 1971, Ai attended the University of California at Irvine&#x27;s M.F.A program where she worked under the likes of Charles Wright and Donald Justice. She is the author of &quot;No Surrender&quot;, (2010), which was published after her death, &quot;Dread&quot; (W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 2003); &quot;Vice&quot; (1999), which won the National Book Award; &quot;Greed&quot; (1993); &quot;Fate&quot; (1991); &quot;Sin&quot; (1986), which won an American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation; &quot;Killing Floor&quot; (1979), which was the 1978 Lamont Poetry Selection of the Academy of American Poets; and &quot;Cruelty&quot; (1973).

She also received awards from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Bunting Fellowship Program at Radcliffe College and from various universities. She was a visiting instructor at Binghamton University, State University of New York for the 1973–74 academic year. After winning the National Book Award for &quot;Vice&quot; she became a tenured professor and the vice president of the Native American Faculty and Staff Association at Oklahoma State University and lived in Stillwater, Oklahoma until her death.

== Literary views/interviews ==

Ai Ogawa considered herself as &quot;simply a writer&quot; rather than a spokesperson for any particular group. About her own poetry in an interview with Lawrence Kearney and Michael Cuddihy in 1978, she emphasized that there are no &quot;confessional&quot; or autobiographical elements in her work. However, in an interview with Okla Elliott in 2003 after the publication of &quot;Dread&quot;, she stated that some of the poems and characters in that book are &quot;fictionalized versions&quot; of her family history and that her multi-racial background and interest in history has had a strong influence on her work in this particular collection.

In a 1999 interview, Ai was asked about the topics she uses in her writings, such as child abuse, necrophilia, and murder. When asked by interviewer Elizabeth Farnsworth why she chooses to write on these topics, Ai replied that “it’s really the characters, because [she] write[s] monologues” (Farnsworth). She also spoke about her choice of characters that “there’s a lot more to talk about with the scoundrels” (Farnsworth).

In that same interview, Farnsworth commented on the fact that even though Ai&#x27;s poetry is written in first person, she is “almost always someone else” (Farnsworth). Ai also told Farnsworth that her “first poetry teacher said that when you wrote in the first person, that your work was often stronger” (Farnsworth). Throughout her writing career, Ai eventually realized that her “poems that were written in the first person were the strongest” (Farnsworth). She also told Farnsworth that she considers herself an “actor” and that is how she is able to successfully write as other characters.

Farnsworth asked Ai about her poem about Jimmy Hoffa- “Jimmy Hoffa’s Odyssey.” Ai told Farnsworth that she got the idea from watching a The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Carson had told a joke that inspired Ai to write the poem. After she decided to write the poem, she found a biography on Hoffa and studied it before writing the piece. Ai said that she often reads biographies before writing a poem on an historical figure.

While her work often contains sex, violence, and other controversial subjects, she told Kearney and Cuddihy during that 1978 interview that she did not view her use of them as gratuitous. Concerning the poems in her first collection, &quot;Cruelty&quot;, she said: &quot;I wanted people to see how they treated each other and themselves.&quot; She noted that the difference between the poems in &quot;Cruelty&quot; and those in &quot;Killing Floor&quot; is that they deal with her character&#x27;s whole life rather than a single episode. She described her purpose for writing as &quot;trying to integrate [her] life emotionally and spiritually.&quot;

When Ai was asked why she thought her work was so “edgy and dark”, Ai stated that “violence is an integral part of American culture” (Farnsworth). She tries to deal with that in her writing, which is something she said she has been working on her whole life. She said that “she was not able to deal with violence in [her] work” early in her writing career, and that was something she intentionally set out to do.

About contemporary American poetry and her own risk-taking in her work she said: &quot;Perhaps there&#x27;s a fear of revealing too much emotion in American poetry, despite the go-ahead of a sort from confessional poetry. At any rate, I think that that is my goal—I mean I never want to say &#x27;I have plenty of heart,&#x27; but I want to be able to say whatever I feel without fear or embarrassment.&quot;

== Name change ==
In 1973, she legally changed her last name to Ogawa and her middle name to &quot;Ai&quot; (愛), which translates to &quot;love&quot; in Japanese, a pen name she had been using since 1969.

== Death ==
Ai was checked into the hospital on March 17, 2010, for pneumonia. Three days later, Ai died on March 20, 2010, at age 62, in Stillwater, Oklahoma, from complications of stage 4 breast cancer.

<doc id="744129" wikidata="Q555246" url="?curid=744129" title="Alan Young">
<text>Alan Young (born Angus Young; November 19, 1919 – May 19, 2016) was a Scottish-born actor. Young is best known for portraying Wilbur Post in the television comedy &quot;Mister Ed&quot; (1961–1966) and voicing Disney&#x27;s Scrooge McDuck for over 40 years, beginning in the 1974 Disneyland Records album &quot;An Adaptation of Dickens&#x27; Christmas Carol, Performed by The Walt Disney Players&quot;. He again voiced Scrooge in the Academy Award-nominated short film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (1983) and continued in the role in various other films, television series and video games up until his death. He was considered by &quot;TV Guide&quot; to be &quot;the Charlie Chaplin of television&quot;.

During the 1940s and 1950s, Young starred in his own variety-comedy sketch shows &quot;The Alan Young Show&quot; on radio and television, the latter gaining him two Emmy Awards in 1951. He also appeared in a number of feature films, starting from 1946, including the 1960 film &quot;The Time Machine&quot; and from the 1980s gaining a new generation of viewers appearing in numerous Walt Disney Productions, films as both an actor and voice actor.

==Early life and education==
Young was born as Angus Young on November 19, 1919, in North Shields, Northumberland, England, to Scottish parents. In his later years, he claimed he had been born in 1924. His father was a mine worker and a tap dancer, and his mother was a singer. The family moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, when Young was a toddler and to West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, when he was six years old. Young came to love radio when bedridden as a child because of severe asthma. In a 1967 interview he credited Christian Science for his healing of asthma.

By the time he entered high school, Young had his own comedy radio series on the CBC network, but he left it during the Second World War to serve in the Royal Canadian Navy.

Young later resigned his Navy commission after learning he would be spending his time writing for a Navy show, and he attempted to join the Canadian Army. According to some sources, the Army rejected him owing to his childhood asthma.

==Career==
After leaving the service, Young moved to Toronto and resumed his Canadian radio career, where he was discovered by an American agent who brought him to New York City in 1944 to appear on American radio. Young&#x27;s first American radio appearances were on the &quot;Philco Radio Hall of Fame&quot;. This led to his own show, &quot;The Alan Young Show&quot;, NBC&#x27;s summer replacement for the series &quot;The Eddie Cantor Show&quot;. He switched to ABC two years later, then returned to NBC.

Young&#x27;s film debut was in &quot;Margie&quot; (1946), and he was featured in &quot;Chicken Every Sunday&quot; (1949). In 1950, the television version of &quot;The Alan Young Show&quot; began. By 1951, the series received not only praise, but also several Primetime Emmy Awards, including Best Actor and Most Outstanding Personality for Young.

After its cancellation, Young continued to act in films, among which &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot; (1952) and &quot;Gentlemen Marry Brunettes&quot; (1955), and two George Pal films, &quot;Tom Thumb&quot; (1958) and &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1960). He appeared in the NBC espionage drama &quot;Five Fingers&quot; (&quot;Thin Ice&quot;, 1959), starring David Hedison.

Young was best known for &quot;Mister Ed&quot; (1961–66), a CBS television show, in which he starred as Wilbur Post, the owner of Mr. Ed, a talking horse who would not talk to anyone but him, thus causing comic situations for Wilbur Post, with his wife, neighbors, and acquaintances. In 1962 while not filming &quot;Mister Ed&quot; Young appeared as John Stetson (inventor of the famous western Stetson hat) on &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; in the episode &quot;The Hat that Won the West.&quot; He also starred as Stanley Beamish in the unaired 1966 pilot episode of &quot;Mr. Terrific&quot;, but apparently declined to appear in the broadcast series in 1967 that followed. In the late 1960s, he retired from acting for several years. During that time, he gave lectures on Christian Science and help to start the broadcast division for the Christian Science Church.

During the 1970s, Young became active in voice acting. After 1974, he voiced Scrooge McDuck in numerous Disney films and in the popular series &quot;DuckTales&quot; (1987–1990). In &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, he portrayed the character&#x27;s miserly namesake. He also played Scrooge in video games such as the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, &quot;&quot; in 2013, and the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; cartoon &quot;Goofy&#x27;s First Love&quot; released in 2015. Apart from Scrooge McDuck, his other prominent roles were Farmer Smurf on &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, Haggis McHaggis on &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, 7-Zark-7 &amp; Keyop in &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot;, and Hiram Flaversham in &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot;. He also guest starred on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show&quot;, and &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot;.

Young later starred in the sitcom &quot;Coming of Age&quot; for two seasons from 1988 to 1989. In 1991, Alan Young returned to the stage, starring as Cap&#x27;n Andy Hawkes in the California Musical Theatre&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Show Boat&quot;. He had been called for the role after Van Johnson, who was initially cast in the part, was hospitalised. He had also appeared in the plays &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; and &quot;The Girl with the Freudian Slip&quot;. In 1993, he recreated his role as Filby for the mini-sequel to George Pal&#x27;s &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, reuniting him with Rod Taylor, who had played George, the Time Traveller. It was called &quot;Time Machine: The Journey Back&quot;, directed by Clyde Lucas.

In 1994, Young co-starred in the Eddie Murphy film &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot;. He played the role of Uncle Dave Thornton, the Walt Disney-esque founder of the fictional California theme park Wonderworld, and in that same year, Young played the role of Charley in the television film, &quot;Hart to Hart: Home Is Where the Hart Is&quot;.

After 1994, he played at least eight characters, including antique dealer Jack Allen on the radio drama &quot;Adventures in Odyssey&quot;. In 1997, he did the voice of Haggis McMutton in the PC game &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;. His later guest roles in animated series included &quot;Megas XLR&quot;, &quot;Static Shock&quot;, &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, &quot;Duckman&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;TaleSpin&quot;. In 2002, he had a cameo as the flower store worker in Simon Wells&#x27;s remake of &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, and in 2010, he read H. G. Wells&#x27;s original novel for 7th Voyage Productions, Inc. Young&#x27;s television guest roles include &quot;Gibbsville&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, &quot;Coach&quot;, &quot;Party of Five&quot;, &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot;, &quot;USA High&quot;, &quot;Hang Time&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Maybe It&#x27;s Me&quot;, and &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot; (&quot;Sweet Charity&quot;, 1997) in which he played Zelda&#x27;s love interest.

==Personal life==

Young was married three times. He and Mary Anne Grimes were married from 1941 to 1947 and had two children.

In interviews with Greg Bell, host of SiriusXM&#x27;s satellite radio &quot;Old Time Radio&quot; program, Young described having dated Marilyn Monroe several times.

Young married his second wife Virginia McCurdy in 1948 and they had two children. They divorced in 1995.

Young married Mary Chipman the following year, in 1996, and they divorced the following year, in 1997. He dedicated his book &quot;Mr. Ed and Me&quot; to Chipman.

Young supported Ronald Reagan, although he stated in a later interview that he was apolitical.

==Death==
Young spent his final years at Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital, a retirement community in Woodland Hills, California. He died there on May 19, 2016, at the age of 96, and was buried at sea.

<text>A hoverboard (or hover board) is a fictional levitating board used for personal transportation, first described in science-fiction, and made famous by the appearance of a skateboard-like hoverboard in the film &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;. Many attempts have been made to invent a functioning hoverboard.

==In fiction==
Hoverboards were first described by author M. K. Joseph in a 1967 science fiction novel. In 1984, a hoverboard appeared in the shoot &#x27;em up arcade video game &quot;SWAT&quot;, developed by Coreland and distributed by Sega in Japan and Bally Midway in North America.

The hoverboard was popularized by the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; film franchise, with its appearance in &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; (1989). During the 1990s there were rumors, fueled by the film&#x27;s director Robert Zemeckis, that hoverboards were in fact real, but not marketed because they were deemed too dangerous by parents&#x27; groups. These rumors have been conclusively debunked.

Hoverboards have appeared in various other media since the 1990s. For example, video games such as the beat &#x27;em up arcade game &quot;Riding Fight&quot; (1992), manufactured by Taito, and the sports video game &quot;AirBlade&quot; (2001), developed by Criterion Games and distributed by Sony in Europe and Namco in North America.

In the long-running British comic 2000 AD, popular character Chopper flies a powerboard when engaging in a sport called skysurfing. The device resembles a surfboard with anti-gravity properties. Air-boards in the science fiction book, No Tribes Beyond Us, feature in-built rotors and bindings for the rider&#x27;s feet, similar to a snowboard.

A short film, Flite, designed to showcase the capabilities of the Unreal Engine game design tool was created by writer and director Tim Webber in 2023. The narrative concerns a young hoverboard rider being chased through a near-future London.

==Prototypes==
Numerous attempts have been made to create working hoverboards.

=== Air cushion or ground effect ===
Several companies have drawn on hovercraft &quot;air-cushion vehicle&quot; technology to attempt to create hoverboard-like products but none have demonstrated similar experiences to the kinds of levitation depicted in science fiction films.

In the 1950s Hiller aircraft produced the &quot;Flying Platform&quot; which was similar to the modern concept of a hoverboard.

The Airboard air-cushion vehicle was unveiled in the 2000 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony in Sydney, which was manufactured and sold by Arbortech Industries Limited. Series II was unveiled in 2007.

In 2004, Jamie Hyneman and his team built a makeshift hovercraft for &quot;MythBusters&quot;, dubbed the &quot;Hyneman Hoverboard&quot;, from a surfboard and leafblower. However, Jamie&#x27;s hoverboard was not very effective.

In 2005, Jason Bradbury created a &quot;hoverboard&quot; for &quot;The Gadget Show&quot;, using a wooden board that was levitated by means of a leafblower. The original design was not propelled and could also not be steered. In 2009, a second version was made which was propelled/steered by a small jet engine (rather than a fan as with an air boat), and also contained two (more powerful) leafblowers.

In May, 2015, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; announced that the Romania-born Canadian inventor Cătălin Alexandru Duru had set a new record for continuous travel as a controlling pilot on an autonomously powered hoverboard, travelling over a distance of at heights up to over Lake Ouareau in the province of Quebec, Canada. Video of the flight leading to a controlled splash-down is offered. Duru had designed and constructed the hoverboard himself over the course of a year. Its lift is generated by propellers, and the pilot controls the craft with his feet.

On 24 December 2015, ARCA Space Corporation claimed it developed a hoverboard named ArcaBoard, and the batteries can provide energy enough for six minutes of hovering at height of up to . It has 36 electric motors that power 36 fans.

In April 2016, a jet powered Flyboard Air hoverboard, flown by inventor Franky Zapata broke the Guinness World Record for farthest flight by hoverboard, flying .

In July 2019, Franky Zapata flew the newer Flyboard Air &quot;jet-powered personal aerial vehicle&quot;, referred to as the EZ-Fly, during Bastille Day celebrations in France. On 4 August 2019, Zapata succeeded in crossing the English Channel with his device. The previous attempt on 25 July had been unsuccessful, but during the second try, escorted by French Army helicopters and using a backpack fuel reservoir, he accomplished the journey in about 20 minutes, including a fueling stop at the midpoint. Zapata reached a speed of and maintained an altitude of approximately .

Zapata&#x27;s company, Z-AIR, had received a €1.3m development grant from the French military in December 2018. However, he has said that the flyboard was not yet suitable for military use due to the noise it creates and the challenge of learning how to fly the device.

=== Magnetic ===
In 2011, French artist Nils Guadagnin created a hovering board that floats by magnetic repulsion between it and its base but cannot carry a load. The board includes a laser system which ensures stabilization, in addition to an electromagnetic system which makes the levitation possible.

In October 2011, the Université Paris Diderot in France presented the &quot;Mag surf&quot;, a superconducting device which levitates above two magnetized repulsing floor rails and can carry up to .

In October 2014, American inventor Greg Henderson demonstrated a prototype hoverboard working on a magnetic levitation system using the electrodynamic wheel principle. Similar to maglev trains, the hoverboard requires a surface of non-ferromagnetic metal such as copper or aluminum to function, carrying up to while hovering above the surface. Four engines were used to power the magnetic levitation, with the option of applying thrust and spin to the board under user control. The prototype was promoted in a campaign on Kickstarter the day of the news coverage, with a price of $10,000 for the first ten boards. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that although the board worked, Greg Henderson had no personal interest in skateboarding and that the Kickstarter was &quot;basically a publicity stunt,&quot; designed to call attention to his company.

On June 24, 2015, Lexus released a video as part of their &quot;Amazing in Motion&quot; series purporting to show a real hoverboard they had developed, the Slide. It was stated by Lexus that the board worked using liquid-nitrogen-cooled superconductors and permanent magnets. The board was shown moving over a conventional-looking concrete skateboard park surface, which led to some skepticism. Lexus apparently later admitted that it only works on special metallic surfaces and the surface shown was not just concrete. On August 4, 2015, Lexus revealed the working principles of the Slide hoverboard with a promotional campaign, filmed in Barcelona and starring Ross McGouran, a professional London skateboarder. Lexus released a series of videos explaining the technology and the whole engineering, research, and development process in association with all its partners.

On January 7, 2021, the YouTube channel Hacksmith Industries uploaded a video of a functional hoverboard capable of sustaining the weight of a human. It uses several electrodynamic wheels to induce eddy currents on an aluminum plate floor. 

On March 22, 2023, a French amateur named Damien Dolata launched on YouTube his first functional version of a hoverboard called Ripulse. This hoverboard is capable of levitating a person weighing up to approximately 30 kg above the ground. It is composed of 4 magneto-rotational repulsors that create an eddy current in a conductive surface.

=== Other ===

In March 2014, a company called HUVr claimed to have developed the technology for hoverboards, and released a video advertising the product on YouTube featuring Christopher Lloyd, Tony Hawk, Moby, Terrell Owens, and others riding hoverboards through a parking lot in Los Angeles. Special effect failures such as incomplete wire removal have conclusively identified the video as a hoax or joke, traced to the Funny or Die website through identification of the cast and public references to the project. Funny or Die later posted a video featuring Christopher Lloyd &quot;apologizing&quot; for the hoax.

Rumors circulated in 2001 that inventor Dean Kamen&#x27;s new invention, codenamed &quot;Ginger&quot;, was a transportation device resembling a hoverboard. In reality, Ginger was the Segway Human Transporter, a self-balancing two-wheel electric scooter.

==Guinness records==
&quot;Guinness World Records&quot; defines a hoverboard as an autonomously powered personal levitator. 

In May 2015, the Romanian-born Canadian inventor Cătălin Alexandru Duru set a Guinness World Record by travelling a distance of at heights up to over a lake, on an autonomously powered hoverboard of his own design.

On April 30, 2016, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; recognized a new record of . The Flyboard Air was powered by jet engine propulsion, and its use allowed Franky Zapata, in Sausset-les-Pins, France to beat the previous record by nearly .
==In popular culture==

===&quot;Back to the Future&quot;===

&quot;Back to the Future&quot; franchise: Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) rides a Mattel hoverboard in &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; (1989), to escape Griff Tannen and his gang in the year 2015. Later on, Marty McFly would revisit 1955 and use the hoverboard to steal the &quot;Grays Sports Almanac&quot; book back from Biff Tannen, to prevent him from taking over Hill Valley.

<text>Galway City Council () is the local authority of the city of Galway, Ireland. As a city council, it is governed by the Local Government Act 2001. The council is responsible for housing and community, roads and transportation, urban planning and development, amenity and culture, and environment. The council has 18 elected members. Elections are held every five years and are by single transferable vote. The head of the council has the title of mayor. The city administration is headed by a chief executive, Leonard Cleary. The council meets at City Hall, College Road, Galway.

==History==
The earliest known charter dates from a grant of Richard II of England in 1395. The first Mayor of Galway was Peirce Lynch. A board of town commissioners was established by local act in 1836. The corporation was dissolved under the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840, with the town commissioners as its successor.
In 1853, 24 town commissioners were appointed under the (16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. cc). In 1899, under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 (61 &amp; 62 Vict. c. 37), the county of the town became an urban district of County Galway, with an urban district council succeeding the town commissioners. In 1937, the Urban District of Galway became the Borough of Galway, remaining part of County Galway. The borough council had 12 members. It increased to 15 members at the 1985 election, in anticipation of its conversion to a city council.

In 1986, the Borough of Galway became the County Borough of Galway and ceased to part of County Galway. The council was known as &quot;The Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of the (County) Borough of Galway&quot; from 1937 until the enactment of the Local Government Act 2001, under which it was renamed Galway City Council. In 2013, a Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee reviewed the allocation of seats and the local electoral areas across local authorities. In the case of Galway Council, it recommended an increase from 15 to 18 seats. This was implemented by the Local Government Reform Act 2014.

On 6 June 2018, the government announced that Galway City Council and Galway County Council were to be merged into a single local authority by 2021. As of late 2021, this proposal was reportedly &quot;off the agenda&quot;.

==Regional assembly==
Galway City Council has two representatives on the Northern and Western Regional Assembly where they are part of the West Strategic Planning Area Committee.

==Elections==
Members of Galway City Council are elected for a five-year term of office on the electoral system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote (PR-STV) from multi-member local electoral areas (LEAs).

==Local electoral areas==
Galway is divided into three LEAs, defined by electoral divisions. The electoral divisions were formerly known as wards and were defined in 1986.
==Councillors==
The following were elected at the 2024 Galway City Council election.

Alfa-Bank, in partnership with the Lauder Institute of the Wharton School of Business, establishes a new award for &quot;Excellence in Foreign Investment&quot;, to be presented to foreign companies operating in Russia for weighty contribution to corporate governance and successful business operations.

*2006 – Alfa-Bank completes the country&#x27;s first securitisation of diversified payment rights with a $350 million deal.

The FBI investigated the activity in the context of links between Trump associates and Russian officials and concluded that this activity was not part of those links and that there might be &quot;an innocuous explanation, like marketing email or spam&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lichtblau_Myers_10/31/2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Through September 2021, U.S. government investigators had been unable to explain the activity, though a 2018 analysis had concluded there were &quot;reasons to doubt that marketing emails were the cause&quot;. A Senate report accepted the FBI&#x27;s assessment that the activity was &quot;unlikely to have been a covert communications channel&quot; but said there was no explanation for this &quot;unusual activity.&quot; In May 2022, Clinton&#x27;s former campaign manager said that Hillary Clinton had approved of a plan to pitch the now-discredited accusation to the media.

*2017 – In March, Alfa-Bank is the target of Ukrainian protests.
* In July, BuzzFeed News reports that, from December 2014 to the summer of 2017, numerous suspicious money transfers were made between Paul Erickson&#x27;s accounts, including Wells Fargo Bank accounts, an undisclosed law firm, the NRA of America, Jack Abramoff&#x27;s son Alex and Abramoff&#x27;s brother Robert&#x27;s company Landfair Capital Consulting, which was founded in March 2017, and Maria Butina&#x27;s Alfa-Bank account. Investigators from Wells Fargo reported these suspicious money transfers to the United States Treasury&#x27;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and to the FBI.
* In December, Alfa-Bank&#x27;s wholly owned Dutch subsidiary, Amsterdam Trade Bank, is raided in connection with an investigation into possible money laundering.

*2022 – Alfa-Bank made a deal with the Kazakh bank &quot;CenterCredit&quot;, on the sale of a subsidiary bank &quot;Alfa-Bank Kazakhstan&quot;, which fell under anti-Russian sanctions in March this year.

The new owner renamed the bank to Eco Center Bank. On May 18, 2022, Ruslan Vladimirov was appointed Chairman of the Board of Eco Center Bank.

==Charity==
Since 2004, Alfa-Bank has been assisting &quot;Life Line&quot;, a charity programme for aiding seriously ill children. Alfa-Bank was the first company to organise a collection of private donations to the foundation. Since September 2008, bank customers have the opportunity to transfer cash donations to help children with the help of the Alfa-Click Internet Bank or a conventional bank transfer without a bank commission. The bank also cooperates with WWF, supports most of its initiatives, and also invites its clients to provide financial support to the fund.

The bank operates a volunteer organization called &quot;Give Kindness&quot;. The bank collects humanitarian aid for orphanages, boarding schools and social shelters, and also attracts employees as volunteers. Every year, the bank organizes charity events called &quot;Children&#x27;s Day&quot;, &quot;Help Me Get Ready for School&quot;, and &quot;Christmas Miracle&quot;.

==Education==
Since 1995, the bank has run the &quot;Alfa-Chance&quot; student scholarship programme, which gives school graduates from various regions of Russia the opportunity to receive higher education at leading universities in the country. Since 2008, Alfa-Bank, in cooperation with HSE, has run a programme to provide nominal scholarships to first-year students from Russian regions (except Moscow and St. Petersburg) who have won prizes at All-Russian School Olympiads and the HSE Multi-Profile Olympiad. In total, the &quot;Alfa-Chance&quot; program involves about 17 higher education institutions. The bank operates the Alfa Fellowship Program, which enables young specialists from the United States, Great Britain and Germany to undergo an internship in Russia.

==Culture==
Alfa-Bank plays an active role in developing cultural and educational activities, primarily to support national art. On 7 June 2000, the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation and Alfa-Bank signed a cooperation agreement, under which the participants agreed to work together to organise joint cultural events and creative projects. Every year, exhibitions and concerts are held with the support of a bank in Russia. In addition, Alfa-Bank participates in the organisation of exhibitions and concerts by Russian cultural figures abroad. For example, on 18 February 2000, a concert by the Moscow Virtuosos Symphony Orchestra conducted by maestro Vladimir Spivakov was held in London. It was the orchestra&#x27;s first performance in London for 10 years. The presentation was sponsored by Alfa-Bank.
Alfa-Bank and the Moscow Literary Fund run a scholarship support programme for writers, aimed at motivating authors to create new works of literature: prose, poetry, drama, translations, and books for children.

The bank is also one of the co-founders of the &quot;Big Book&quot; National Literary Award.

Alfa-Bank periodically sponsors or participates in the organisation of concerts by foreign stars in Russia, including Bono (2010), Elton John (1995, 2001, and 2007), Aerosmith (2007), Sting (1996, 2001, and 2006), Whitney Houston (2004), and Paul McCartney (2003 and 2004). Some of the singers invited were performing in Russia for the first time. Alfa-Bank also organises an electronic music and technology festival called Alfa Future People. Headliners have included stars of the world electronic scene such as Paul Oakenfold, Avicii, Skrillex, Pompeya, Tesla Boy, and Infected Mushroom, among others.

In July 2014, Alfa-Bank announced the launch of the City Tours with Alfa social project. The Bank provides financial and organisational support to the country&#x27;s best museums, as well as tour bureaus supporting the development of city tours in Russia.

In early 2021, Alfa-Bank hired the Russian rapper Morgenshtern as a &quot;youth director&quot;. This was preceded by the appearance of a scandalous video in which the Federal Antimonopoly Service found violations of Russian advertising law. The singer&#x27;s task was to attract 100,000 young new clients. Some experts see this venture as a reputational risk. After an administrative case was initiated against Morgenshtern in April 2021 for drug propaganda, Alfa-Bank disavowed previous messages and called them an &quot;advertising stunt&quot;.

==Technology==
* Alfa-Bank has joined forces with MasterCard to launch the production of AlfaPay wristwatches with an integrated debit bank card, based on PayPass technology. Purchases can be made without entering a PIN code or sign. The card shows its number and CVC-code to pay for online purchases.
* Alfa-Bank has developed the Alfa-Touch app. It allows users to create a non-personalised card for one year and pay for purchases using the PayPass system.
* Contactless ATMs have operated in the bank&#x27;s branches since December 2015. The installation of such ATMs was aimed primarily at improving security (preventing fraudsters from reading magnetic strip data), and also allows quicker interaction with the device.
* Alfa-Bank has cooperated with prostheses manufacturer Motorika to develop bioelectric prostheses with a special mount for a PayPass contactless payment card. This development is aimed at reducing inconveniences for people with disabilities when making purchases. To pay for a product or service, it is sufficient to place the prosthesis near the terminal and confirm the operation with a PIN code if the total exceeds 1,000 rubles. In addition, this prosthesis works with other devices equipped with contactless card readers.
* At the end of 2016, Alfa-Bank&#x27;s A-Club Private Banking topped the &quot;Best Russian Bank for Millionaires&quot; list compiled by Forbes. It was ranked 4th among non-state Russian banks.

==Protection of business reputation==
On 21 January 2014, Alfa-Bank and Mikhail Fridman filed a lawsuit for the protection of their business reputation against the chairman of the Yabloko Party, Sergei Mitrokhin, the editorial staff of the Izvestia newspaper and a correspondent from the newspaper. They considered that statements made by Mitrokhin and Izvestia that &quot;Aleksei Navalny is carrying out political orders from the Alfa Group&quot; did not correspond to reality and discredited their business reputation. However, the court refused to satisfy the company&#x27;s claim against Mitrokhin.

==Jones Day==
In the United States, the Jones Day law firm represents numerous Russian entities, including Alfa-Bank and Alfa Group.

==Sanctions==

On February 23, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of military operations in Ukraine, launching an invasion. This prompted countries to impose severe economic sanctions on Russian individuals, companies, and banks in addition to those placed on Russia in response to the 2021-2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis. On 24 February 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden announced sanctions on several Russian banks, including Alfa-Bank; the restrictions include &quot;dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity&quot;. Alfa-Bank&#x27;s press service made a statement in the Russian press that these sanctions would not affect the bank&#x27;s operations.

In April, Apple removed the Alfa-Bank application from its App Store. Already downloaded versions continued to work. In August, the “Деньги пришли” (Money Came) application appeared in the App Store, replicating the functionality of the official Alfa-Bank application, but developed by a third-party company. Other Russian banks have resorted to similar measures before, but &quot;alternative&quot; applications were cleared out in about a week.

The EU adopted sanctions in its 10th package in February 2023. The UK first imposed sanctions on 24 March 2022, increased in March 2023 and in December 2023 increased them again to include a prohibition on correspondent banking relationships.

<text>The historiography of science or the historiography of the history of science is the study of the history and methodology of the sub-discipline of history, known as the history of science, including its disciplinary aspects and practices (methods, theories, schools) and the study of its own historical development (&quot;History of History of Science&quot;, i.e., the history of the discipline called History of Science).

Historiographical debates regarding the proper method for the study of the history of science are sometimes difficult to demarcate from historical controversies regarding the course of science. Early controversies of the latter kind are considered by some to be the inception of the sub-discipline.

== Amateur historiography of science ==
Histories of science were originally written by practicing and retired scientists, a notable early example being William Whewell&#x27;s &quot;History of the Inductive Sciences&quot; (1837). Biographies of natural philosophers (early scientists) were also popular in the nineteenth century, helping to create Isaac Newton as a scientific genius and national hero in Great Britain. H.G. Wells began a trend for histories of science on the grand scale, a kind of epic of civilisation and progress, with his &quot;Outline of History&quot; (1919/1920). Popular accounts of science&#x27;s past were often linked to speculations about its future, with science fiction authors such as Isaac Asimov and L. Sprague de Camp dabbling in the two.

== Professional historiography of science ==

=== Internalism and externalism ===
In the early 1930s, a paper given by the Soviet historian Boris Hessen prompted many historians to look at the ways in which scientific practices were allied with the needs and motivations of their context. Hessen&#x27;s work focused on socio-political factors in what science is done, and how.

This method of doing the history of science that became known as &quot;externalism&quot; looks at the manner in which science and scientists are affected, and guided by, their context and the world in which they exist. It is an approach which eschews the notion that the history of science is the development of pure thought over time, one idea leading to another in a contextual bubble which could exist at any place, at any time, if only given the right geniuses.

The method of doing history of science which preceded externalism, became known as &quot;internalism&quot;. Internalist histories of science often focus on the rational reconstruction of scientific ideas and consider the development of these ideas wholly within the scientific world. Although internalist histories of modern science tend to emphasize the norms of modern science, internalist histories can also consider the different systems of thought underlying the development of Babylonian astronomy or Medieval impetus theory.

In practice, the line between internalism and externalism can be incredibly fuzzy. Few historians then, or now, would insist that either of these approaches in their extremes paint a wholly complete picture, nor would it necessarily be possible to practice one fully over the other. However, at their heart they contain a basic question about the nature of science: what is the relationship between the producers and consumers of scientific knowledge? The answer to this question must, in some form, inform the method in which the history of science and technology is conducted; conversely, how the history of science and technology is conducted, and what it concludes, can inform the answer to the question. The question itself contains an entire host of philosophical questions: what is the nature of scientific truth? What does objectivity mean in a scientific context? How does change in scientific theories occur?

The historian/sociologist of science Robert K. Merton produced many works following Hessen&#x27;s thesis, which can be seen as reactions to and refinements of Hessen&#x27;s argument. In his work on science, technology, and society in the 17th-century England, Merton sought to introduce an additional category — Puritanism — to explain the growth of science in this period. Merton split Hessen&#x27;s category of economics into smaller subcategories of influence, including transportation, mining, and military technique. Merton also tried to develop empirical, quantitative approaches to showing the influence of external factors on science.

Even with his emphasis on external factors, Merton differed from Hessen in his interpretation: Merton maintained that while researchers may be inspired and interested by problems which were suggested by extra-scientific factors, ultimately the researcher&#x27;s interests were driven by &quot;the internal history of the science in question&quot;. Merton attempted to delineate externalism and internalism along disciplinary boundaries, with &quot;context&quot; studied by the sociologist of science, and &quot;content&quot; by the historian.

=== Historiographical approaches to theory change in science ===

A major subject of concern and controversy in the philosophy of science has been the nature of paradigm shift or theory change in science. Karl Popper argued that scientific knowledge is progressive and cumulative; Thomas Kuhn, that scientific knowledge moves through &quot;paradigm shifts&quot; and is not necessarily progressive; and Paul Feyerabend, that scientific knowledge is not cumulative or progressive and that there can be no demarcation in terms of method between science and any other form of investigation.

==== Thought collectives ====
In 1935, Ludwik Fleck, a Polish medical microbiologist published&quot;Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact&quot;. Fleck&#x27;s book focused on the epistemological and linguistic factors that affect scientific discovery, innovation and progress or development.

It used a case study in the field of medicine (of the development of the disease concept of Syphilis) to present a thesis about the social nature of knowledge, and in particular science and scientific &quot;thought styles&quot; (Denkstil), which are the epistemological, conceptual and linguistic styles of scientific (but also non-scientific) &#x27;thought collectives&#x27; (Denkkollektiv). Fleck&#x27;s book suggests that epistemologically, there is nothing stable or realistically true or false about any scientific fact. A fact has a &quot;genesis&quot; which is grounded in certain theoretic grounds and many times other obscure and fuzzy notions, and it &quot;develops&quot; as it is subject to dispute and additional research by other scientists.

Fleck&#x27;s monograph was published at almost the same time as Karl Popper&#x27;s &quot;Logik der Forschung&quot; but unlike Popper&#x27;s work, the book received no review notice in &quot;Isis&quot;. However, Thomas S. Kuhn acknowledged the influence it had upon the &quot;Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;. Kuhn also wrote the foreword to Fleck&#x27;s English translation.

==== Falsifiability ====
Popper coined the term &quot;critical rationalism&quot; to describe his philosophy. He distinguished between verification and falsifiability and said that a theory should be considered scientific if, and only if, it is falsifiable. Popper sought to explain the apparent progress of scientific knowledge in &quot;All Life is Problem Solving&quot;. Popper suggested that our understanding of the universe seems to improve over time because of an evolutionary process. He proposed that the process of &quot;error elimination&quot; in the field of science is like that of natural selection for biological evolution, whereby theories that better survive the process of refutation are not necessarily more &quot;true&quot; but more &quot;fit&quot; or applicable to the problem situation at hand. Popper suggested that the evolution of theories through the scientific method could reflect a certain type of progress: toward more and more interesting problems.

Popper helped to establish the philosophy of science as an autonomous discipline within philosophy, through his own prolific and influential works, and also through his influence on his own contemporaries and students.

==== Revolutions ====
The mid 20th century saw a series of studies investigating the role of science in a social context. The sociology of science focused on the ways in which scientists work, looking closely at the ways in which they &quot;produce&quot; and &quot;construct&quot; scientific knowledge.

Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; (1962) is considered particularly influential. It opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part sociologically determined and that positivism did not explain the actual interactions and strategies of the human participants in science.

As Kuhn put it, the history of science may be seen in more nuanced terms, such as that of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix that includes intellectual, cultural, economic and political themes outside of science. &quot;Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific.&quot;

In 1965, Gerd Buchdahl wrote &quot;A Revolution in Historiography of Science&quot;, referring to the studies of Thomas Kuhn and Joseph Agassi. He suggested that these two writers had inaugurated the sub-discipline by distinguishing clearly between the history and the historiography of science, as they argued that historiographical views greatly influence the writing of the history of science.

Further studies, such as Jerome Ravetz&#x27;s &quot;Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems&quot; (1971) referred to the role of the scientific community, as a social construct, in accepting or rejecting (objective) scientific knowledge.

Since the 1960s, a common trend in science studies (the study of the sociology and history of science) has been to emphasize the &quot;human component&quot; of scientific knowledge, and to de-emphasize the view that scientific data are self-evident, value-free, and context-free. The field of Science and Technology Studies, an area that overlaps and often informs historical studies of science, focuses on the social context of science in both contemporary and historical periods.

Corresponding with the rise of the environmentalism movement and a general loss of optimism of the power of science and technology unfettered to solve the problems of the world, this new history encouraged many critics to pronounce the preeminence of science to be overthrown.

====Science wars====

The Science wars of the 1990s were about the influence of especially French philosophers, which denied the objectivity of science in general or seemed to do so. They described as well differences between the idealized model of a pure science and the actual scientific practice; while scientism, a revival of the positivism approach, saw in precise measurement and rigorous calculation the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies.

== History of science in the 21st Century ==

The discipline today encompasses a wide variety of fields of academic study, ranging from the traditional ones of history, sociology, and philosophy, and a variety of others such as law, architecture, and literature. There is a tendency towards integrating with global history, as well as employing new methodological concepts such as cross-cultural exchange. Historians of science also closely work with scholars from related disciplines such as the history of medicine and science and technology studies.

=== Questioning postmodernism ===
Some critical theorists later argued that their postmodern deconstructions had at times been counter-productive, and had provided intellectual ammunition for reactionary interests. Bruno Latour noted that &quot;dangerous extremists are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won evidence that could save our lives. Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies? Is it enough to say that we did not really mean what we meant?&quot;

===Eurocentrism in the historiography of science===
Eurocentrism in scientific history are historical accounts written about the development of modern science that attribute all scholarly, technological, and philosophical gains to Europe and marginalize outside contributions. Until Joseph Needham&#x27;s book series Science and Civilisation in China began in 1954, many historians would write about modern science solely as a European achievement with no significant contributions from civilizations other than the Greeks. Recent historical writings have argued that there was significant influence and contribution from Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Arabic, Indian, and Chinese astronomy and mathematics. The employment of notions of cross-cultural exchange in the study of history of science helps in putting the discipline on the path towards being a non-Eurocentric and non-linear field of study.

<text>Kandilli (before 2003: &quot;Armutçuk&quot;) is a town in Ereğli District, Zonguldak Province, Turkey. Its population is 2,573 (2022).

Kandilli is located on top of a mountain about 10 km north east of Karadeniz Ereğli and about 40 km west of Zonguldak city. It is about 1 km from the coast of the Black Sea but due to the precipitous cliffs it is not readily accessible. Kandilli used to have a small port facility at the bottom of the cliffs which was accessible using a funicular railway contraption which was still operable as of 2002.

The main industry of the town is a coal mine producing black coal. A railway exists from Kandilli to the port at Eregli but is not in use. The route of the railway is scenic and has been suggested by local entrepreneurs as a possible tourist railway.

<text>A bank vault is a secure room used by banks to store and protect valuables, cash, and important documents. Modern bank vaults are typically made of reinforced concrete and steel, with complex locking mechanisms and security systems. This article covers the design, construction, and security features of bank vaults.

Unlike safes, vaults are an integral part of the building within which they are built, using armored walls and a tightly fashioned door closed with a complex lock.

Historically, strongrooms were built in the basements of banks where the ceilings were vaulted, hence the name. Modern bank vaults typically contain many safe deposit boxes, as well as places for teller cash drawers and other valuable assets of the bank or its customers. They are also common in other buildings where valuables are kept such as post offices, grand hotels, rare book libraries and certain government ministries.

Vault technology developed in a type of arms race with bank robbers. As burglars came up with new ways to break into vaults, vault makers found new ways to foil them. Modern vaults may be armed with a wide array of alarms and anti-theft devices. Some 19th and early 20th century vaults were built so well that today they are difficult to destroy, even with specialized demolition equipment. These older vaults were typically made with steel-reinforced concrete. The walls were usually at least 1 ft (0.3 m) thick, and the door itself was typically 3.5 ft (1.1 m) thick. Total weight ran into the hundreds of tons . Today vaults are made with thinner, lighter materials that, while still secure, are easier to dismantle than their earlier counterparts.

==Design==

Bank vaults are custom-designed and are usually one of the first elements considered when planning a new bank building. The vault manufacturer works with the bank to determine specifications like size, shape, and security features. Modern vaults are typically constructed using steel-reinforced modular concrete panels engineered for maximum strength and crush resistance. A 3-inch thick panel of specialized concrete can be up to 10 times stronger than an 18-inch panel of standard concrete.

Bank vaults are typically made with steel-reinforced concrete. This material was not substantially different from that used in construction work. It relies on its immense thickness for strength. An ordinary vault from the middle of the 20th century might have been 18 in (45.72 cm) thick and was quite heavy and difficult to remove or remodel around. Modern bank vaults are now typically made of modular concrete panels using a special proprietary blend of concrete and additives for extreme strength. The concrete has been engineered for maximum crush resistance. A panel of this material, though only 3 in (7.62 cm) thick, may be up to 10 times as strong as an 18 in-thick (45.72-cm) panel of regular formula concreted.

There are at least two public examples of vaults withstanding a nuclear blast. The most famous is the Teikoku Bank in Hiroshima whose two Mosler Safe Company vaults survived the atomic blast with all contents intact. The bank manager wrote a congratulatory note to Mosler. A second is a vault at the Nevada National Security Site (formerly the Nevada Test Site) in which an above ground Mosler vault was one of many structures specifically constructed to be exposed to an atomic blast in Operation Plumb Bob - Project 30.4:Response of Protective Vaults to Blast Loading.

==Manufacturing process==

===Panels===
The wall panels are molded first using a special reinforced concrete mix. In addition to the usual cement powder, stone, etc., additional materials such as metal shavings or abrasive materials may be added to resist drilling penetration of the slab. Unlike regular concrete used in construction, the concrete for bank vaults is so thick that it cannot be poured. The consistency of concrete is measured by its &quot;slump&quot;. Vault concrete has zero slump. It also sets very quickly, curing in only six to 12 hours, instead of the three to four days needed for most concrete.
*A network of reinforcing steel rods is manually placed into the damp mix.
*The molds are vibrated for several hours. The vibration settles the material and eliminates air pockets.
*The edges are smoothed with a trowel, and the concrete is allowed to harden.
*The panels are removed from the mold and placed on a truck for transport to the customer&#x27;s construction site.

===Door===
The vault door is also molded of special concrete used to make the panels, but it can be made in several ways. The door mold differs from the panel molds because there is a hole for the lock and the door will be clad in stainless steel. Some manufacturers use the steel cladding as the mold and pour the concrete directly into it. Other manufacturers use a regular mold and screw the steel on after the panel is dry.

Round vault doors were popular in the early 20th century and are iconic images for a bank&#x27;s high security. They fell out of favor due to manufacturing complexities, maintenance issues (door sag due to weight) and cost, but a few examples are still available.

A day gate is a second door inside the main vault door frame used for limited vault protection while the main door is open. It is often made of open metal mesh or glass and is intended to keep a casual visitor out rather than to provide true security.

===Lock===
A vault door, much like the smaller burglary safe door, is secured with numerous massive metal bolts (cylinders) extending from the door into the surrounding frame. Holding those bolts in place is some sort of lock. The lock is invariably mounted on the inside (behind) of the difficult-to-penetrate door and is usually very modest in size and strength, but very difficult to gain access to from the outside. There are many types of lock mechanisms in use:
*A combination lock similar in principle to that of a padlock or safe door is very common. This is usually a mechanical device but products incorporating both mechanical and electronic mechanisms are available, making certain safe cracking techniques very difficult.
*Some high-end vaults employ a two piece key to be used in conjunction with a combination lock. This key consists of a long stem as well as a short stamp which should be safeguarded separately and joined to open the vault door.
*A dual control (dual custody) combination lock has two dials controlling two locking mechanisms for the door. They are usually configured so that both locks must be dialed open at the same time for the door to be unlocked. No single person is given both combinations, requiring two people to cooperate to open the door. Some doors may be configured so that either dial will unlock the door, trading off increased convenience for lessened security.
*A time lock is a clock that prevents the vault&#x27;s door from opening until a specified number of hours have passed. This is still the &quot;theft proof&quot; lock system that Sargent invented in the late nineteenth century. Such locks are manufactured by only a few companies worldwide. The locking system is supplied to the vault manufacturer preassembled.
* Many safe-cracking techniques also apply to the locking mechanism of the vault door. They may be complicated by the sheer thickness and strength of the door and panel.

===Installation===
*The finished vault panels, door, and lock assembly are transported to the bank construction site. The vault manufacturer&#x27;s workers then place the panels enclosed in steel at the designated spots and weld them together. The vault manufacturer may also supply an alarm system, which is installed at the same time. While older vaults employed various weapons against burglars, such as blasts of steam or tear gas, modern vaults instead use technological countermeasures. They can be wired with a listening device that picks up unusual sounds, or observed with a camera. An alarm is often present to alert local police if the door or lock is tampered with.

==US resistance standards==
Quality control for much of the world&#x27;s vault industry is overseen by Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. (UL) in Northbrook, Illinois. UL rates vaults based on their resistance to mock break-in attempts. Key points of the UL-608 standard include:

* Testing uses common hand tools, power tools, and cutting torches
* A breach is defined as a 96 square inch hole or disabling of locking bolts
* Only active working time is counted (excludes setup, breaks, etc.)
* Does not test resistance to thermal lance or explosives
* Applies to the door and all vault sides
* Separate standards cover locks, ventilation, and alarms

==European resistance standards==
As with the US, Europe has agreed a series of test standards to assure a common view of penetrative resistance to forcible attack. The testing regime is covered under the auspices of Euronorm 1143-1:2012 (also known as BS EN 1143-1: 2012), which can be purchased from approved European standards agencies.

Key points include:
*Standard covers burglary resistance tests against free-standing safes and ATMs, as well as strongrooms and doors
*Tests are undertaken to arrive at a grade (0 to XIII) with two extra resistance qualifiers (one for the use of explosives the other for core drills)
*Test attack tools fall into five categories with increasing penetrative capability, i.e. Categories A–D and S
*Penetration success is measured as partial (125mm diameter hole) or full (350mm diameter hole)
*Considers only the time actually spent working (excludes setup, rests, etc.) 
*EN 1143-1 makes no claims as to the fire resistance of the vault
*EN 1300 covers high security locks, i.e. four lock classes (A, B, C and D)
*Applies to the door and all vault sides.

==Future==

Bank vault technology changed rapidly in the 1980s and 1990s with the development of improved concrete material. Bank burglaries are also no longer the substantial problem they were in the late 19th century up through the 1930s, but vault makers continue to alter their products to counter new break-in methods.

An issue in the 21st century is the thermal lance. Burning iron rods in pure oxygen ignited by an oxyacetylene torch, it can produce temperatures of . The thermal lance user bores a series of small holes that can eventually be linked to form a gap. Vault manufacturers work closely with the banking industry and law enforcement in order to keep up with such advances in burglary.

<doc id="744148" wikidata="Q384091" url="?curid=744148" title="Battle of Mukden">
<text>The , one of the largest land battles to be fought before World War I and the last and the most decisive major land battle of the Russo-Japanese War, was fought from 20 February to 10 March 1905 between Japan and Russia near Mukden in Manchuria. The city is now called Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning province in China.

Involving 610,000 combat participants and 164,000 combatant casualties, it was the largest modern-era battle fought prior to World War I, and possibly the largest battle in world history at that point. The scale of the battle, particularly in the amount of ordnance being expended, was unprecedented in world history. The Japanese side alone fired 20.11 million rifle and machine gun rounds and 279,394 artillery shells in just over ten days of fighting (yet the Russians still fired more), matching the ammunition consumption of the German army in the entire 191-day Franco-Prussian War. The battle was a decisive strategic victory for the Japanese and, coupled with their victory at the Battle of Tsushima four months later, proved critical in ending the war in their favor.

==Background==
Following the Battle of Liaoyang (24 August to 4 September 1904), Russian forces retreated to the river Sha Ho south of Mukden and regrouped. From 5 October 1904 to 17 October 1904, during the Battle of Shaho, the Russians unsuccessfully counter-attacked, but managed to temporarily slow the Japanese advance. A second Russian counter-offensive, the Battle of Sandepu, fought from 25 to 29 January 1905 was likewise unsuccessful.

Though the combined Russian army led by General Aleksey Kuropatkin was set to receive reinforcements via the unfinished Trans-Siberian Railroad, the effects of the Bloody Sunday and the now-ongoing unrest at home placed a strain on the manpower of the whole Imperial Army as much of its resources now had to be dedicated in the quelling of the uprisings throughout its territories. Therefore, the Russian force was expected to receive little to no reinforcements and supplies from home.

The situation for the Japanese was hardly better. Though the capture of Port Arthur by General Maresuke Nogi freed up their 3rd Army, which then advanced north to reinforce the Japanese lines near Mukden in preparation for an attack, the manpower reserves of the Japanese army had been drained by February 1905. With the arrival of General Nogi&#x27;s 3rd Army, Japan&#x27;s entire fighting strength was concentrated at the vicinity of Mukden. The severe casualties, bitter cold climate, and approach of the Russian Baltic Fleet created pressure on Marshal Ōyama to effect the complete destruction of the Russian forces, rather than just another victory from which the Russians could withdraw farther into Manchuria.

==Disposition of forces==
The Russian line to the south of Mukden was long, with little depth and with a central reserve. 
* the Second Manchurian Army under General Baron von Kaulbars (who had replaced the unfortunate General Oskar Gripenberg), on the right flank in the west, on flat ground. 
* the Third Manchurian Army under General Baron von Bilderling, in the center, holding the railway and the highway. 
* the First Manchurian Army under General Nikolai Linevich, held the hilly terrain on the east flank. This flank also held two-thirds of the Russian cavalry, under General Paul von Rennenkampf. 
General Kuropatkin had thus disposed his forces in a purely defensive layout, from which it would be difficult to impossible to execute an offensive without opening a major gap in the lines.

On the Japanese side (Japanese Manchurian Army), 
* the Japanese First Army (General Kuroki) and 
* the Japanese Fourth Army (General Nozu) advanced to the east of the rail line,
* the Japanese Second Army (General Oku) advanced to the west. 
* The Japanese Third Army (General Nogi) was kept concealed behind the 2nd Army until the start of battle. 
* A newly formed Japanese &quot;Ōryokukō&quot; (Yalu River) Army under General Kawamura provided a major diversion on the Russian eastern flank. 
The Yalu River Army was much under strength, and consisted only of the IJA 11th Division (from Port Arthur) and reservists. Despite that it was technically not under the Japanese Manchurian Army but directly under Imperial General Headquarters to attack Primorsky Krai politically, the division was substantially under Manchuria HQ under the commander&#x27;s decision.

General Kuropatkin was convinced that the main Japanese thrust would come from the mountainous eastern side, as the Japanese had proven themselves effective in such terrain, and the presence of the former 3rd Army veterans from the 11th Division in that area reinforced his convictions.

Field Marshal Ōyama&#x27;s plan was to form his armies into a crescent to encircle Mukden, cutting off the possibility of Russian escape. He was explicit in his orders that combat within the city of Mukden itself was to be avoided. All during the war, the Japanese had pursued a meticulous civil affairs policy aimed at avoiding civilian casualties and keeping the Chinese populace on their side – a stark contrast with the previous First Sino-Japanese War and subsequent Second Sino-Japanese War.

==The battle==

The battle opened with the Japanese 5th Army attacking the left flank of the Russian forces on 20 February. On 27 February 1905 the Japanese 4th Army attacked the right flank, while other Japanese forces also attacked the Russian front lines. On the same day, the Japanese 3rd Army began its movement in a wide circle northwest of Mukden.

By 1 March 1905, action on the eastern and center fronts was largely static. The Japanese had made small advances but under heavy casualties. However, by 7 March, General Kuropatkin began withdrawing forces from the eastern front to counter the Japanese 3rd Army&#x27;s moves on the western flank of Mukden, and was so concerned about General Nogi&#x27;s movements that he decided to lead the counterattack himself. The shifting of forces from east to west was not well coordinated by the Russians, causing the 1st and 3rd Manchurian Armies to all but disintegrate into chaos. Then Kuropatkin decided to withdraw his troops north towards Mukden to face the Japanese forces head-on on the city&#x27;s southwest and at the banks of the Hun River in the city&#x27;s southeast.

Then Field Marshal Ōyama seized the chance he had been waiting for, and his orders to &quot;attack&quot; were changed to &quot;pursue and destroy&quot;. Luck was further with the Japanese due to the late thaw in the weather. The Hun River, guarded by the Russian left flank commanded by Major General Mikhail Alekseyev, remained frozen, and was not an obstacle to the Japanese attack. However, as they crossed the river, the Japanese attack was hampered when they encountered stiff resistance and heavy artillery fire coming from the Russians, now commanded by General Paul von Rennenkampf, resulting in yet more heavy casualties. After heavy fighting the Japanese succeeded in taking the northern bank of the river, causing the Russian defense lines defending the bank to collapse and the far edge of their left flank to be partially cut off from the rest of the main body of Kuropatkin&#x27;s army. At the same time a salient was formed just 15 kilometers west of Mukden, enabling the Japanese to totally encircle the Russians on their right flank in the process.

All but encircled and with no hope for victory, General Kuropatkin gave the order to retreat to the north at 18:45 on 9 March. The Russian withdrawal was complicated by General Nozu&#x27;s breach through Russian rearlines over the Hun River. 

At 10:00 AM on 10 March, Japanese forces occupied Mukden. After they occupied Mukden the Japanese continued their hard-driven pursuit of the Russians, but this was hampered when Ōyama knew that his army&#x27;s supply lines were stretching too thin; however, he continued the pursuit of the enemy, though in a lazy, slow manner. The pursuit was stopped 20 kilometers short of Mukden, but the Russians were already fleeing farther north from Tiehling towards the Sino-Russian border at a fast pace, and the battle was over with the Japanese as the victor.

Throughout the battle, many foreign military observers were present in order to observe how the next great war might be fought. The Battle of Mukden heavily foreshadowed the tactics to be used in World War I.

==Conclusion==
Russian casualties amounted to nearly 90,000. The Russians had also lost most of their combat supplies as well as most of their artillery and heavy machine guns. Fearing further Japanese advances, General Kuropatkin ordered that the town of Tieling be put to the torch, and marched his remaining men 10 days further north to a new defense line at Hspingkai (modern Siping, Jilin province, China), where General Mikhail Batyanov (who replaced General von Bilderling as commander of the Third Manchurian Army) organized defenses against a possible renewed Japanese offensive. However, Kuropatkin did not hold this line for very long, and soon organized a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from the region. The Japanese forces suffered 75,000 casualties which included a higher percentage of killed and wounded over the Russians. The Japanese captured 58 artillery pieces.

No serious fighting on land occurred after this battle as both Russian and Japanese armies were exhausted from the conflict.

== Aftermath ==
With the defeat of the Russian Manchurian Army in Mukden, the Russian forces were driven out of southern Manchuria. However, with problems concerning its overstretched supply lines, the Japanese army failed to destroy the Russian forces stationed in the region completely and Kuropatkin&#x27;s forces, though severely demoralized and short of supplies, were still largely intact. But the battle of Mukden was decisive enough to shatter the Russians&#x27; morale and, with the unfinished Trans-Siberian railroad now in Japanese hands, undermined the tsarist government&#x27;s war effort. The final, decisive battle of the war would be eventually fought on the waters of Tsushima.

The victory shocked the imperial powers of Europe, as the Japanese proved overwhelming throughout the battle despite the Russians having more manpower and material. It showed that European armies were not automatically superior to those of other nations, and could be even decisively outmatched in battle. The battle had confirmed the Japanese army the 6th largest army in the world. 
Tsar Nicholas II was particularly shocked, when the news reached the palace in St. Petersburg, that the tiny Asian island nation of Japan - approximately 2% of Russia&#x27;s landmass - could defeat the powerful and huge Russian empire.
The tsarist government was irritated over the incompetence and clumsiness of their commanders during the battle. The generals Aleksandr Samsonov and Paul von Rennenkampf began to loathe each other as Samsonov very publicly accused von Rennenkampf of failing to assist him. In World War I these Generals would command the two armies involved in the even more disastrous Battle of Tannenberg.

<doc id="744149" wikidata="Q2721679" url="?curid=744149" title="Warner Mountains">
<text>The Warner Mountains are an -long mountain range running north–south through northeastern California and extending into southern Oregon in the United States. The range lies within the northwestern corner of the Basin and Range Province, extending from the northeastern corner of Lassen County, California, through eastern Modoc County, California (east of Alturas), and northward into Lake County, Oregon (east of Lakeview).

The highest peak in the range is Eagle Peak with an elevation of . The range is part of the Modoc National Forest in California and Fremont National Forest in Oregon. The southern portion of the range includes Eagle Peak and Warren Peak, within the South Warner Wilderness.

==Geography==
The Warner Range is not part of the Sierra Nevada range or the Cascade Range, but part of the Great Basin Ranges. It is in the semi-arid, sparsely-populated northeastern corner of California and the south-central portion of Oregon. The range is a classic example of horst and graben (fault-block) topography with pluvial (ephemeral) lakes occupying the graben basins.

The eastern escarpment of the range overlooks the Surprise Valley in California and Warner Valley in Oregon, enclosed basins that contain Upper Alkali Lake, Middle Alkali Lake, and Lower Alkali Lake along the California–Nevada border, and the Warner Lakes (Crump and Hart lakes) in Oregon. The western side of the range overlooks a ranching and farming region drained by the forks of the Pit River, a tributary of the Sacramento River. Goose Lake is a long closed-basin lake located in the Goose Lake Valley along the west side of the range, straddling the California–Oregon border. Goose Lake drained into the Pit River only twice in recorded history: in 1868 and 1881. The lake dried up in 1926 and from 1929 to 1934.

==Climate==

Here is climate data gathered from Dismal Swamp near the California-Oregon border at around 7300 feet which shows typical climate patterns that are common for the region.

==History==
The Fandango Pass in the Warner Mountains was on the Lassen-Applegate Trail used by emigrants from 1846 to 1850 as an alternate route to the Willamette Valley in Oregon and the gold fields of California. After reaching Goose Lake, the emigrant trains often split, with some continuing to the Willamette Valley and others continuing to the gold fields.

A gold-mining rush occurred in the Warner Mountains in 1912. A number of mines were developed briefly in what was known as the High Grade Mining District just adjacent to the Oregon border in Modoc County, California.

Great quantities of lumber were removed from the Warner Mountains beginning as early as 1920. Ponderosa pine logs were used to supply active sawmills and box factories at Lakeview, Oregon; Alturas, California; and Willow Ranch, California. The sawmill and box factory at Willow Ranch near the Oregon–California border was a company town with a population over 1,000 during the 1930s and 1940s. The operation closed in 1958.

==Namesake==
The range was named after explorer Captain William H. Warner, of the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, who was killed in the range by Native Americans on September 26, 1849, while exploring a route for potential railroad crossings of the Sierra Nevada. His remains were never found and his name appeared on maps of the range in 1866.

Camp Warner was established in the northern portion of the Warner Range in Oregon in 1867 by General George Crook to &quot;pacify&quot; the Indians. The post was abandoned in 1874. Crook Peak, elevation in the Warner Range near Camp Warner, is named after Crook.

<text>AAdvantage is the frequent-flyer program of American Airlines. Launched May 1, 1981, it was the second such loyalty program in the world (after the first at Texas International Airlines in 1979) and remains the largest, with more than 115 million members as of April, 2021.

Miles accumulated in the program allow members to redeem tickets, upgrade service class, or obtain free or discounted car rentals, hotel stays, merchandise, or other products and services through partners. The most active members, based on the amount and price of travel booked, are designated AAdvantage Gold, AAdvantage Platinum, AAdvantage Platinum Pro, and AAdvantage Executive Platinum elite members, with privileges such as separate check-in, priority upgrade and standby processing, or free upgrades. They also receive similar privileges from AA&#x27;s partner airlines, particularly those in oneworld. AAdvantage co-branded credit cards are also available and offer other benefits. These cards are issued by Barclaycard and CitiCards in the United States, and by Butterfield Bank and Scotiabank in the Caribbean.

AAdvantage allows one-way redemption, starting at 7,500 miles.

== History ==
Increased competition following the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act prompted airline marketing professionals to develop ways to reward repeat customers and build brand loyalty. The first idea at American, a special &quot;loyalty fare&quot;, was modified and expanded to offer free first-class tickets and upgrades to first class for companions, or discounted coach tickets. Membership was seeded by searching American&#x27;s SABRE computer reservations system for recurring phone numbers. The 130,000 most frequent flyers, plus an additional 60,000 members of the airline&#x27;s Admirals Club were pre-enrolled and sent letters with their new account numbers. The name was selected by American&#x27;s advertising agency and is consistent with other American Airlines programs featuring &quot;AA&quot; in the name and logo. The original logo was designed by Massimo Vignelli.

Less than a week later, rival United Airlines launched its MileagePlus program; other airlines followed in the ensuing months and years. The rapid appearance of competition changed the nature of the program, and as airlines began to compete on the features of their frequent flyer programs, AAdvantage liberalized its rules, established partnerships with hotel and rental car agencies, and offered promotions such as extra free beverages. In 1982 AAdvantage also became the first program to cooperate with an international carrier; members could accrue and redeem miles on British Airways flights to Europe.

In 1988, major airlines, including American, offered triple miles. This led to increases in the number of miles needed for awards. During this time, miles, which originally had no expiration, began to have an expiration of three years, later reduced to 18 months, where an account would be closed if there was no activity during this time.

In 2005 American Airlines joined other major U.S. carriers in introducing an online shopping portal allowing shoppers to earn AAdvantage miles when shopping online.

In 2016, AAdvantage began crediting miles based on the amount of the airfare, not the distance traveled. This change was accompanied by increases in miles needed for an award.

In 2022, American Airlines simplified the method of keeping track of earning miles for AAdvantage status. It was formerly required to keep track of three metrics: EQM (Elite Qualifying Miles), EQS (Elite Qualifying Segments), and EQD (Elite Qualifying Dollars). The update replaced the three metrics with a single metric: Loyalty Points. Besides flying, members can use their AAdvantage credit card for purchases.

== Membership tiers ==

There are five membership tiers in AAdvantage: standard, Gold, Platinum, Platinum Pro and Executive Platinum.

Gold status requires 40,000 Loyalty Points. Gold status confers priority boarding, expedited security, complimentary same-day standby, discounted Admirals Club membership, and complimentary upgrades on domestic flights. All fares receive one free checked bag. Gold status also confers a 40% mileage bonus to all flown segments, a 500-mile minimum on each segment, complimentary auto-requested upgrades on flights 500 miles or less, complimentary preferred seats, Main Cabin Extra seats (complimentary at check-in), and a 24-hour upgrade window. Gold status provides oneworld Ruby status when flying a oneworld partner airline.

Platinum status requires 75,000 Loyalty Points. Platinum status confers priority boarding, expedited security, priority baggage delivery, complimentary same-day standby, discounted Admirals Club membership, and complimentary upgrades on domestic flights. All fares receive two free checked bags. Platinum status also confers a 60% mileage bonus to all flown segments, a 500-mile minimum on each segment, complimentary preferred seats, complimentary Main Cabin Extra seats, and a 48-hour upgrade window. It also confers a greater standing on upgrade lists and a special phone line. Platinum status provides oneworld Sapphire status when flying a oneworld partner airline.

Platinum Pro status requires 125,000 Loyalty Points. Platinum Pro status confers priority boarding, expedited security, priority baggage delivery, complimentary same-day standby, discounted Admirals Club membership, and unlimited, auto-requested complimentary upgrades on flights regardless of the number of miles. All fares receive three free checked bags. Platinum status also confers an 80% mileage bonus to all flown segments, a 500-mile minimum on each segment, complimentary preferred seats, complimentary Main Cabin Extra seats, and a 72-hour upgrade window for flights. It also confers a greater standing on upgrade lists and a special phone line. Platinum Pro status provides oneworld Emerald status when flying a oneworld partner airline.

Executive Platinum status requires 200,000 Loyalty Points. Executive Platinum status confers priority boarding, expedited security, priority baggage delivery, complimentary same-day standby, complimentary same-day flight change, discounted Admirals Club membership, unlimited, auto-requested complimentary upgrades on flights regardless of the number of miles, waived ticket service change, guaranteed availability in the Main Cabin, waitlist priority for purchased First or Business Class, complimentary alcoholic beverage and snack in Main Cabin. All fares receive three free checked bags. Executive Platinum status also confers a 120% mileage bonus to all flown segments, a 500-mile minimum on each segment, complimentary preferred seats, complimentary Main Cabin Extra seats, and a 100-hour upgrade window for flights. It also confers a greater standing on upgrade lists and a special phone line. Executive Platinum status provides oneworld Emerald status when flying a oneworld partner airline.

Individuals who accumulate 1,000,000 miles earned on American receive lifetime Gold status. Individuals who accumulate 2,000,000 miles earned on American receive lifetime Platinum status. Beginning in 2025, individuals who accumulate 4,000,000 and 5,000,000 miles earned on American receive lifetime Platinum Pro &amp; Executive Platinum status, respectively.

Beginning January 1, 2016, elite qualifying points were removed from AAdvantage&#x27;s tier qualification system, while elite qualifying miles and flown segments will continue to be used to determine tier status and qualification. Beginning January 1, 2017, elite qualifying dollars were added to AAdvantage&#x27;s tier qualification status. Beginning 2022, elite qualifying miles/segments/dollars were replaced with Loyalty Points.

== Partnerships ==
In addition to its oneworld and American Eagle partnerships, American Airlines offers frequent flier partnerships with the following airlines:

;Airlines
* Air Tahiti Nui
* Cape Air
* China Southern Airlines
* Etihad Airways
* Fiji Airways
*GOL Airlines
* Hawaiian Airlines
*JetBlue
* Seaborne Airlines

== Miles expiration ==
When American first started their frequent-flyer program, miles credited to AAdvantage members’ accounts never expired. In 1989, American implemented an expiration policy where miles would expire if there wasn&#x27;t any account activity over a three-year period. In 2012, American revised their policy by lowering the required activity timeframe to 18 months. Miles that were not previously subject to expiration were given a 25% bonus before adopting the new 18-month expiration policy.

In March 2022, American again revised their expiration policy by increasing the timeframe for required activity to 24 months. Miles in members&#x27; accounts who are under 21 years of age are exempt from the account activity requirement. Expired miles cannot be used for award travel. To reactivate previously earned miles, AAdvantage plan members can pay a fee ranging from $200–$600. Of the three main legacy carriers in the United States, American is the only one that continues to maintain an expiration policy; Delta and United both relinquished such policies in 2011 and 2019, respectively.

Originally intended to be released on Sega&#x27;s NAOMI arcade board, the game was built on the Namco System 246 board before being ported to the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox home consoles.

The game&#x27;s plot revolves around the legendary weapon Soul Edge having been shattered into pieces, with different characters seeking to collect all the pieces to gain possession of the complete weapon or to destroy it once and for all. Compared to &quot;Soulcalibur&quot;, &quot;Soulcalibur II&quot; had improvements in graphics and the game system and introduced several new and guest characters.

The game was a critical and commercial success, with the introduction of guest characters to the series, particularly Link on the GameCube version, being acclaimed by critics and audiences alike, and considered to be one of the greatest fighting games made. A high-definition port, titled SoulCalibur II HD Online, based on the PlayStation 2 version, was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2013. It received a sequel, &quot;Soulcalibur III&quot; (2005).

==Gameplay==

Key game system improvements include an easier &quot;step&quot; and &quot;avoid&quot; systems, arena walls (rather than ring out ability on all sides) and wall-specific moves, a three-step Soul Charge system, a clash system that is used when two attacks hit each other simultaneously resulting in a white flash, Guard Break attacks which put a blocking player into a post guard-impact state, just frame moves awarding additional hits to players who can time their command inputs well and a revised Guard Impact system that removes height-based Impact moves and instead uses a more unified system (high and mid attacks are countered using Repels, mid and low attacks are countered using Parries).

&quot;Soulcalibur II&quot; includes the same modes of play as most fighting games: Arcade, Versus Battle, Team Battle (similar to Arcade, but with teams of up to 3 characters and without cutscenes or endings), Versus Team Battle (with teams of up to 8 characters), Time Attack (where the player has to race against the clock to set records), Survival and Practice. There are also &quot;Extra&quot; versions of these modes, intended to allow the use of Extra Weapons and unlockable stages. A point worth mentioning is that the 7th battle in Arcade Mode is called a &quot;Destined Battle&quot;, which is a predefined battle that never changes. Each character has one according to their story, and all Destined Battles are shared by groups of two characters (for example, Mitsurugi→Taki and Taki→Mitsurugi) with the exceptions of the home console-exclusive characters. As in &quot;Soulcalibur&quot;, there is a &quot;Museum&quot; containing character artwork and various videos (like the Arcade Mode&#x27;s intro or the Weapon Master Mode&#x27;s intro and Ending) and an &quot;Exhibition Theater&quot; (where &quot;katas&quot; can be viewed). There is also a &quot;Profile Viewer&quot; (to read about character&#x27;s stories) and a &quot;Battle Theater&quot; (to watch CPU vs CPU battles).

A returning feature from &quot;Soul Edge&quot; that was absent from the first &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; is the inclusion of Extra Weapons. Instead of the many stats used in &quot;Soul Edge&quot;, this one uses only three stats: attack, defense and special abilities (such as draining energy, passing through defense, etc.). Each character has 12 different weapons, from the standard (basic) weapons for 1P and 2P to the powerful &quot;Ultimate Weapon&quot;. Also, each character is granted a Soul Edge version of their weapon, as well as a &quot;Joke Weapon&quot; with bad stats and effects, and with unique and funny hit sounds. Each weapon is given a backstory in the &quot;Weapon Gallery&quot;. Like before, some characters possess a third costume, which is purchased in Weapon Master Mode. Out of the 25 selectable characters, 13 are granted a third costume: Astaroth, Cassandra, Ivy Valentine, Mitsurugi, Nightmare, Raphael, Seung Mina, Sophitia, Taki, Talim, Voldo, and Xianghua. The GameCube version&#x27;s guest character Link has four costumes (green, red, blue and lavender) and Assassin, Berserker and Lizardman each have six different costumes (three color edits of their two standard costumes).

The Arcade version has a unique mode called &quot;Conquest Mode&quot; that allows the player to pick an army, fight enemies and gain experience points, increasing the level of the selected player. &quot;Weapon Master Mode&quot;, made in a similar fashion to &quot;Soul Edge&quot;″s &quot;Edge Master Mode&quot; and &quot;Soulcalibur&quot;″s &quot;Mission Mode&quot;, takes the core system from &quot;Conquest Mode&quot; and expands upon it. It introduces a story set in an alternate world, in which the player moves in a map divided into &quot;regions&quot; (named after stars) and fights enemies to gain experience points (which raise the &quot;rank&quot; of the character) and money (which can be used to buy weapons, art, costumes and videos). The mode has 10 normal chapters, four sub-chapters and two extra-chapters as well as Extra-Missions (alternate versions of normal missions). The player endorses the role of a swordsman searching for Soul Edge, who is confronted by a powerful, mad knight named Veral, seeking Soul Edge for his own desires.

==Characters==
Four new playable characters are introduced in &quot;Soulcalibur II&quot;: Cassandra (fighting style derived from Sophitia), Raphael (unique fighting style), Talim (unique fighting style) and Yunsung (fighting style derived from Hwang).

A new unlockable character, Charade, switches its style to match existing characters&#x27; move lists with each individual round of fighting, similarly to its predecessors Edge Master and Inferno. The console versions of the game feature Necrid, a new character created by Todd McFarlane, and one of three platform-exclusive characters: Heihachi Mishima from &quot;Tekken&quot; on the PlayStation 2, Link from &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; on the GameCube, and Spawn from the comic book series of the same name by McFarlane on the Xbox. Cloud Strife from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was originally intended to fill Heihachi&#x27;s spot on the PlayStation 2 version, but the licensing deal fell through at the last moment. The HD version includes both Heihachi and Spawn.

Fully returning as playable characters are Astaroth, Cervantes (unlockable), Ivy, Kilik, Maxi, Mitsurugi, Nightmare, Taki, Voldo, Xianghua and Yoshimitsu (unlockable), as well as Seung Mina (unlockable) and Sophitia (unlockable) who are exclusive to the console versions. Inferno is the game&#x27;s main boss, but is no longer a playable character. Nightmare&#x27;s third costume is Siegfried (although he is still referred to as Nightmare), while Assassin and Berserker play extremely similarly to Hwang and Rock, who do not return from the previous game. Although the original Lizardman from &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; does not return, the game does feature a generic Lizardman with the same move list. Since Assassin, Berserker and Lizardman are considered bonus characters, they do not have any Extra Weapons. In the North American and PAL console versions, they can only be selected in Versus Battle Mode, Team Battle Mode, Versus Team Battle Mode, Practice Mode, along with the &quot;Extra&quot; versions of these modes, as well as in Battle Theater. In the Japanese console versions, they cannot be selected by the player in any mode. They are, however, playable during certain portions of Weapon Master Mode in all versions of the game.

==Plot==
The game is set in the year 1590 AD, four years after the events of &quot;Soulcalibur&quot;. The wave of slaughters that terrorized Europe reached a sudden end. The knight in azure armor, Nightmare, and his followers were successful in collecting enough souls and were about to start the restoration ceremony on the ruins of the once-proud Ostrheinsburg Castle. But just as the ceremony was about to start, three young warriors assaulted the castle. In a matter of time, the cult was defeated, and Nightmare stood in front of the young warriors while wielding Soul Edge. After an intense battle, Nightmare fell, but then the evil soul inside Soul Edge sent the young warriors into a vortex of hellfire and stood to confront them. As a result of Soul Edge&#x27;s evil aura, Krita-Yuga revealed its true form: that of the Holy Sword, Soul Calibur. The intense battle ended with the victory of the holy sword, but when the vortex of Inferno collapsed, both swords along with the Azure Knight Nightmare were sucked into the void and expelled to another place. Siegfried Schtauffen, who was until a moment before the Azure Knight, reclaimed his own mind. Recognizing his sins, he set on a journey of atonement. Still, the blade held a strong bond, and every night, it took control of his body and absorbed souls of those nearby. The efforts made by the young knight were fruitless, and four years later the Azure Knight returned. Around those times, various warriors came into contact with the blade&#x27;s remaining fragments, revealing Soul Edge&#x27;s ultimate survival. After its defeat, the fragments began causing chaos and evil to grow in the world. Driven by the need to either possess or destroy the evil sword, each warrior embarks on a new journey, while Nightmare starts his rampage anew, seeking souls to gain the power to restore Soul Edge once again...

==Development and release==
At E3 2001, Namco showed a trailer for the &quot;next chapter&quot; of &quot;Soulcalibur&quot;. In August 2001, Namco confirmed that &quot;Soulcalibur II&quot; was in development and would be simultaneously available for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox. In that same month, the GameCube version was shown at Nintendo Space World 2001. The game had a marketing budget of $9.4 million.

A soundtrack for the game was released as &quot;Soulcalibur II Original Soundtrack&quot;. An art book was also published.

===&quot;Soulcalibur II HD Online&quot;===
A high-definition version of the game, titled &quot;Soulcalibur II HD Online&quot;, based on the PlayStation 2 version of the game, was released digitally for PlayStation 3 through PlayStation Network and Xbox 360 through Xbox Live in North America and Europe on November 19 and 20, 2013, respectively, and in Japan on February 20, 2014. It includes all game modes from the original releases, as well as support for online-only gameplay via PlayStation Network and Xbox Live. For reasons unknown, the English version of the HD re-release lacks the dual-language option available in the original game and only features English voice acting. Both versions of the game also include two guest characters, Heihachi Mishima and Spawn, who were previously exclusive to specific platforms (PlayStation 2 and Xbox, respectively), and the PS2 version&#x27;s opening version is used. In addition, in Japan, having the game data allows for two virtual items and a costume to be available for free in &quot;&quot;.

==Reception==
The original version of &quot;SoulCalibur II&quot; received critical acclaim, earning it the average scores of 91.3% for the PlayStation 2, 92.3% for the GameCube, and 91.6% for the Xbox. Greg Kasavin of &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the game &quot;It&#x27;s certainly one of the most refined, most accessible, and best-looking 3D fighting games to date, and it&#x27;s squarely the best game in its class for the Xbox and GameCube.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; writer Kaiser Hwang gave the game a positive review, but commented on its similarity to the first game &quot;And so, while evolution is not always mandatory, sometimes pushing the boundaries can lead to bigger and better things. In the case of Soul Calibur II, contentment will do just fine.&quot;

In the first ever Spike Video Game Awards in 2003, &quot;SoulCalibur II&quot; won in the category Most Addictive Game. During the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the game was awarded Console Fighting Game of the Year by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences; it also received a nomination for Outstanding Achievement in Animation. In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; praised the inclusion of Link, placing the game 41st on a list of greatest Nintendo games. In 2011, &quot;Complex&quot; ranked it as the 14th best fighting game of all time.

By July 2006, the GameCube version of &quot;Soulcalibur II&quot; had sold 850,000 copies and earned $32 million in the United States. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 69th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined sales of &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; games released in the 2000s reached 2.6 million units in the United States by July 2006. As of 2007, the GameCube version sold about a million copies in the US, and 100,000 in Japan, making it one of the best-selling third-party GameCube games. The PlayStation 2 version received a &quot;Gold&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

<text>Discogs (; short for discographies) is a database of information about audio recordings, including commercial releases, promotional releases, and bootleg or off-label releases. Database contents are user-generated, and described in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;Wikipedia-like&quot;. While the site was originally created with the goal of becoming the largest online database of electronic music, it now includes releases in all genres and on all formats. By 2015, it had a new goal: that of &quot;cataloging every single piece of physical music ever created.&quot; As of 2025, its database contains over 18 million user-submitted album listings.

==History==
Discogs was started in 2000 by Kevin Lewandowski who worked as a programmer at Intel. It was originally started from a computer in Lewandowski&#x27;s closet and was limited to electronic music. By 2015, Discogs had 37 employees, 3 million users, and a monthly traffic of 20 million visits.

In 2005, Discogs launched a marketplace where users can buy and sell albums. The Discogs Marketplace is modeled similar to Amazon and eBay, where sellers offer items for sale and a fee is charged on the sold item. Its album listings are filterable by the country they ship from, format, currency, genre, style, format description, media condition, year released, seller name, and whether the buyer is invited to &quot;make an offer.&quot; 

In July 2007, a new subscription-based system for sellers was introduced on the site, called &quot;Market Price History&quot;. It gave premium users access to the past price items that were sold for up to 12 months ago by previous sellers who had sold exactly the same release (though 60 days of information was free). At the same time, the US$12 per year charge for advanced subscriptions was abolished, as it was felt that the extra features should be made available to all subscribers, now that a different revenue stream had been found from sellers and purchasers. Later that year, all paid access features were discarded and full use of the site became free of charge, allowing all users to view the full 12-month Market Price History of each item.

<text>Jnana yoga (), also known as jnana marga (), is one of the three classical paths (&quot;margas&quot;) for moksha (liberation) in the Bhagavad Gita, which emphasizes the &quot;path of knowledge&quot; or the &quot;path of self-realization&quot;. The other two are karma yoga (path of action, &quot;karma-mārga&quot;) and bhakti yoga (path of loving devotion to a personal god, &quot;bhakti-mārga&quot;). Modern interpretations of Hindu texts have led to the a fourfold classification to include Raja yoga, that is, meditation as described in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.

&quot;Jñāna yoga&quot; is a spiritual practice that pursues knowledge through questions such as &#x27;Who am I?&#x27; and &#x27;What am I?&#x27; among others. The practitioner studies usually with the aid of a guru, meditates, reflects, and reaches liberating insights on the nature of one&#x27;s own Self (Atman, soul) and its relationship to the metaphysical concept called Brahman in Hinduism. The &quot;jñāna-mārga&quot; ideas are discussed in ancient and medieval era Hindu scriptures and texts such as the &quot;Upanishads&quot; and the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;.

==Etymology==
Jñāna, sometimes transcribed as &quot;gyaan or gnan&quot;, means &quot;knowledge&quot; in Sanskrit. The root jñā- is cognate to the English &quot;know&quot;, as well as to the Greek γνώ- (as in γνῶσις &quot;gnosis&quot;). Its antonym is &quot;ajñāna&quot; &quot;ignorance&quot;.

==Definition==

&quot;Jnana&quot; is knowledge, which refers to any cognitive event that is correct and true over time. It particularly refers to knowledge inseparable from the total experience of its object, especially about reality (non-theistic schools) or a supreme being (theistic schools). In Hinduism, it is knowledge which gives Moksha, or spiritual liberation while alive (jivanmukti) or after death (videhamukti). Jñāna yoga is the path towards attaining &quot;jnana&quot;. 

It is one of the three classical types of yoga mentioned in Hindu philosophies, the other two being karma yoga and bhakti. In modern classifications, classical yoga, being called Raja yoga, is mentioned as a fourth one, an extension introduced by Swami Vivekananda. 

Classical yoga emphasizes the practice of dhyana (meditation), and this is an element of all three classical paths in Hinduism, including &quot;jñāna yoga&quot;. In the Bhagavad Gita, &quot;jnana&quot; is equated with samkhya (yoga), the discernment of purusha, pure consciousness, as different from prakriti, matter and material desires. This discernment is possible when the mind has been calmed by the practice of &quot;dhyana&quot;, meditation. 

According to Jones and Ryan, &quot;jnana&quot; in &quot;jnana yoga&quot; context is better understood as &quot;realization or gnosis&quot;, referring to a &quot;path of study&quot; wherein one knows the unity between self and ultimate reality called Brahman in Hinduism. This explanation is found in the ancient Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita. This is typical for Advaita Vedanta, where &quot;jnana&quot; involves the recognition of the identity of &quot;jivatman&quot; and Brahman. According to Bimal Matilal, &quot;jnana yoga&quot; in Advaita Vedanta connotes both primary and secondary sense of its meaning, that is &quot;self-consciousness, awareness&quot; in the absolute sense and relative &quot;intellectual understanding&quot; respectively. While contemporary Advaita Vedanta and neo-Vedanta incorporate meditation, Adi Shankara relied on insight alone, based on the Mahavakya. Neo-Advaita also emphasizes direct insight. 

Of the three different paths to liberation, &quot;jnana marga&quot; and &quot;karma marga&quot; are the more ancient, traceable to Vedic era literature. All three paths are available to any seeker, chosen based on inclination, aptitude and personal preference, and typically elements of all three to varying degrees are practiced by many Hindus.

The path of knowledge is intended for those who prefer philosophical reflection, and it requires study and meditation.

Jnana yoga encourages its adepts to think and speak of themselves in the third person as a way to distance themselves from the Ego and detach their eternal self (atman) from the body related one (maya).

==Upanishads==
In the Upanishads, &quot;jnana yoga&quot; aims at the realization of the oneness of the individual self (Atman) and the ultimate Self (Brahman). These teachings are found in the early Upanishads. According to Chambliss, the mystical teachings within these Upanishads discuss &quot;the way of knowledge of the Self&quot;, a union, the realization that the Self (Atman) and the Brahman are logical.

The teachings in the Upanishads have been interpreted in a number of ways, ranging from non-theistic monism to theistic dualism. In former, rituals are not necessary, and a path of introspection and meditation is emphasized for the correct knowledge (&quot;jnana&quot;) of self. In latter, it is the full and correct knowledge of a Vishnu avatar or Shiva or Shakti (Goddess) that is emphasized. In all its various interpretations, the paths are not necessarily mutually exclusive. A &quot;Jnana yogi&quot; may also practice &quot;Karma yoga&quot; or &quot;Bhakti yoga&quot; or both, and differing levels of emphasis.

According to Robert Roeser, the precepts of Jnana yoga in Hinduism were likely systematized by about 500 BCE, earlier than Karma yoga and Bhakti yoga.

==Bhagavad Gita== 
In the Bhagavad Gita, &quot;jnana yoga&quot; is also referred to as &quot;buddhi yoga&quot; and its goal is self-realization. The text considers &quot;jnana marga&quot; as the most difficult, slow, confusing for those who prefer it because it deals with &quot;formless reality&quot;, the &quot;avyakta&quot;. It is the path that intellectually oriented people tend to prefer.

The chapter 4 of the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; is dedicated to the general exposition of Jnana yoga, while chapters 7 and 16 discuss its theological and axiological aspects. Krishna says that jñāna is the purest, and a discovery of one&#x27;s Atman:

==Traditions==
The Advaita philosopher Adi Shankara gave primary importance to jñāna yoga for the &quot;knowledge of the absolute&quot; (Brahman), while the Vishishtadvaita commentator Ramanujar regarded knowledge only as a condition of devotion.

===Classical Advaita Vedanta===
====Behaviors====
Classical Advaita Vedanta emphasises the path of Jnana Yoga to attain moksha. It consists of fourfold attitudes, or behavioral qualifications:
# Discrimination (&quot;&quot; (नित्यानित्य वस्तु विवेकम्), or simply &quot;viveka&quot;) — The ability to correctly discern (viveka) between the unchanging, permanent, eternal (&quot;nitya&quot;) and the changing, transitory, temporary (&quot;anitya&quot;).
# Dispassion of fruits (&quot;&quot; (इहाऽमुत्रार्थ फल भोगविरागम्), or simply &quot;vairagya&quot;) — The dispassionate indifference (&quot;vairagya&quot;) to the fruits, to enjoyments of objects (&quot;artha phala bhoga&quot;) or to the other worlds (&quot;amutra&quot;) after rebirth.
# Six virtues (&quot;&quot; (शमादि षट्क सम्पत्ति), or simply &quot;satsampat&quot;) — 
## &quot;Śama&quot;, temperance of mind
## &quot;Dama&quot;, temperance of sense organs (voluntary self-restraints)
## &quot;Uparati&quot;, withdrawal of mind from sensory objects 
## &quot;Titikṣa&quot;, forbearance
## &quot;Śraddhā&quot;, faith
## &quot;Samādhāna&quot;, concentration of mind
# Drive, longing (&quot;&quot; (मुमुक्षुत्वम्)) — intense yearning for &quot;moksha&quot; from the state of ignorance

====Practices====
&quot;Jnanayoga&quot; for Advaitins consists of three practices: &quot;sravana&quot; (hearing), &quot;manana&quot; (thinking) and &quot;nididhyasana&quot; (meditation). This three-step methodology is rooted in the teachings of chapter 4 of the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot;:
*&quot;Sravana&quot; literally means hearing, and broadly refers to perception and observations typically aided by a counsellor or teacher (guru), wherein the Advaitin listens and discusses the ideas, concepts, questions and answers.
*&quot;Manana&quot; refers to thinking on these discussions and contemplating over the various ideas based on &quot;svadhyaya&quot; and &quot;sravana&quot;.
*&quot;Nididhyāsana&quot; refers to meditation, realization and consequent conviction of the truths, non-duality and a state where there is a fusion of thought and action, knowing and being.

These practices, with the help of a guru are believed to lead to correct knowledge, which destroys &quot;avidya&quot;, psychological and perceptual errors related to Atman and Brahman.

===Shaivism===
Both the theistic and monistic streams of Shaivism include &quot;jnana yoga&quot; ideas, along with those related to &quot;karma yoga&quot;, and in the case of Saiva Siddhanta ideas related to &quot;bhakti yoga&quot;. The Shaivism traditions do not consider renunciation necessary for practicing jnana yoga, leaving ascetic yogi lifestyle optional. Spirituality can be pursued along with active life (&quot;karma&quot;), according to Shaiva traditions, and it believes that this does not hinder ones ability to journey towards self (Shiva within) realization. The traditions dwell into this integration of karma yoga with jnana yoga, such as by ranking daily behavior and activity that is done by choice and when not necessary as higher in spiritual terms than activity that is impulsive or forced.

The methodology of sravana, manana and nididhyasana similar to Advaita Vedanta are also found in various traditions of Shaivism. However, &quot;nistha&quot; or &quot;samadhi&quot; is sometimes added in Shaiva methodology. The meditational aspects of Shaivism focus on the nirguna form of Supreme Reality (Shiva).

===Vaishnavism===
The &quot;Pancharatra&quot; (agama) texts of Vaishnavism, along with its Bhagavata (Krishna, Rama, Vishnu) tradition, are strongly influenced by &quot;jnana yoga&quot; ideas of the Upanishads. However, Vaishnavism also incorporates Bhakti yoga concepts of loving devotion to the divine Supreme personally selected by the devotee, in saguna form, both in silent meditational and musical expressive styles.

The aim of jnana yoga in Vaishnavism differs from that in other schools. Advaita, for example, considers jnana yoga as the path to nondual self-knowledge and moksha. Vaishnavism, in contrast, considers it a condition of devotion.

===Shaktism===
The Shaktism literature on goddess such as &quot;Kularnava Tantra&quot; highlight &quot;jnana marga&quot; as important to liberation. It differentiates between two kinds of &quot;jnana&quot;: one it calls knowledge that comes from Agama texts, and another it calls &quot;viveka&quot; (insight). The Shaktism literature then adds that both lead to the knowledge of Brahman, but the first one is in the form of sound (&quot;shabdabrahman&quot;), while the insight from within is the ultimate truth (&quot;parabrahman&quot;).

Some Shakta texts, such as the &quot;Sita Upanishad&quot;, combine yoga of action and knowledge as a path to liberation. The &quot;Devi Gita&quot;, a classic text of Shaktism, dedicates chapter 4 to &quot;Jnana yoga&quot;, stating that a Jnana yogi understands and realizes that there is no difference between the individual soul and herself as the supreme Self. The discussion of Jnana yoga continues through the later chapters of the &quot;Devi Gita&quot;.

<text>A visor (also spelled vizor) is a surface that protects the eyes, such as shading them from the sun or other bright light or protecting them from objects.

Nowadays many visors are transparent, but before strong transparent substances such as polycarbonate were invented, visors were opaque like a mask.
*The part of a helmet in a suit of armor that protects the eyes.
*A type of headgear consisting only of a visor and a band as a way to fasten it around the head.
*Any such vertical surface on any hat or helmet.
*Any such horizontal surface on any hat or helmet (called a &quot;peak&quot; in British English).
*A device in an automobile that the driver or front passenger can lower over part of the windshield to block the sun (sun visor).
*As masque costume, Henry VIII and his courtiers wore &quot;visors of good proportion of physiognomy&quot;.

* The transparent or semi-transparent, heavily shaded/tinted, front part of a welding mask
*Safety face shields used in construction, industry, or medical settings
*An eyeshield to protect the eyes from sunlight on an American football helmet

<text>Ajay Kalahastri Naidu (born February 12, 1972) is an American actor and director best known for playing Samir in &quot;Office Space&quot;. He also made guest appearances in such critically acclaimed television shows as &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. Naidu was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male for his performance in the film &quot;SubUrbia&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Naidu was born in Evanston, Illinois. His parents came from India to the United States in 1964. He attended Evanston Township High School. He trained with the American Repertory Theater&#x27;s Institute for Advanced Theater Training at Harvard University.

==Career==
Naidu&#x27;s first professional acting job, which he won from an open call, was a leading role opposite Michael Keaton in the 1986 film &quot;Touch and Go&quot;. This was followed by an &quot;ABC Afterschool Special&quot; episode, &quot;No Greater Gift&quot; (1985), where he played Nick Santana, a 12-year-old boy with a terminal illness. Naidu then appeared in the &quot;MacGyver&quot; TV series&#x27; first-season episode, &quot;To Be a Man&quot; in 1986.

Other early film credits include &quot;Where the River Runs Black&quot; (1986) opposite Charles Durning and &quot;Vice Versa&quot; (1988). Between 1988 and 1995 he worked extensively in classical theatre.

Naidu returned to film acting in 1996 with Richard Linklater&#x27;s &quot;SubUrbia&quot;, for which he was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male and competed against the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Roy Scheider and Jason Lee.

On screen, Naidu starred in the cult film &quot;Office Space&quot;, as well as appearing in films such as &quot;K-Pax&quot;, &quot;Subway Stories&quot;, &quot;π&quot;, &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;, &quot;Bad Santa&quot;, &quot;The War Within&quot;, &quot;The Guru&quot;, &quot;Waterborne&quot;, and &quot;Loins of Punjab Presents&quot;. He co-starred as a series regular in the sitcom &quot;LateLine&quot; and had guest starring roles on the television dramas &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;Bored to Death&quot;.

Naidu has been working extensively with musicians from the Asian underground music movement for many years as a breakdancer and an M.C. His vocals have appeared on many records, most notably Talvin Singh&#x27;s Mercury Award winner &quot;OK&quot; and Vijay Iyer&#x27;s In What Language?.

In 2006, Naidu directed his first feature film &quot;Ashes&quot; which had its release in 2010 and for which he won Best Actor accolades from the MIACC Film Festival in New York and the London Asian Film Festival.

Naidu&#x27;s most recent theatre credits include &quot;The Kid Stays in the Picture&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre, &quot;The Master&quot; and &quot;Margarita&quot; with Complicite, a world tour of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; with Complicite, &quot;The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui&quot; alongside Al Pacino, directed by Simon McBurney, &quot;The Little Flower of East Orange&quot; alongside Ellyn Burstyn at New York&#x27;s Public Theater directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; at TFANA directed by Arin Arbus. In 2001 Naidu&#x27;s solo theatre piece &quot;Darwaza&quot; was a sold-out hit at New York&#x27;s Labyrinth Theatre, where he is also a member of the company.

In 2019, Naidu was awarded the Excellence in Performing Arts Award by Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White.

==Personal life==
Naidu is married to actress Heather Burns. The couple has a son, Jaan Burns.

<doc id="744165" wikidata="Q1322892" url="?curid=744165" title="Chordal graph">
<text>In the mathematical area of graph theory, a chordal graph is one in which all cycles of four or more vertices have a &quot;chord&quot;, which is an edge that is not part of the cycle but connects two vertices of the cycle. Equivalently, every induced cycle in the graph should have exactly three vertices. The chordal graphs may also be characterized as the graphs that have perfect elimination orderings, as the graphs in which each minimal separator is a clique, and as the intersection graphs of subtrees of a tree. They are sometimes also called rigid circuit graphs or triangulated graphs: a chordal completion of a graph is typically called a triangulation of that graph.

Chordal graphs are a subset of the perfect graphs. They may be recognized in linear time, and several problems that are hard on other classes of graphs such as graph coloring may be solved in polynomial time when the input is chordal. The treewidth of an arbitrary graph may be characterized by the size of the cliques in the chordal graphs that contain it.

==Perfect elimination and efficient recognition==
A &quot;perfect elimination ordering&quot; in a graph is an ordering of the vertices of the graph such that, for each vertex , and the neighbors of that occur after in the order form a clique. A graph is chordal if and only if it has a perfect elimination ordering.

 (see also ) show that a perfect elimination ordering of a chordal graph may be found efficiently using an algorithm known as lexicographic breadth-first search. This algorithm maintains a partition of the vertices of the graph into a sequence of sets; initially this sequence consists of a single set with all vertices. The algorithm repeatedly chooses a vertex from the earliest set in the sequence that contains previously unchosen vertices, and splits each set of the sequence into two smaller subsets, the first consisting of the neighbors of in and the second consisting of the non-neighbors. When this splitting process has been performed for all vertices, the sequence of sets has one vertex per set, in the reverse of a perfect elimination ordering.

Since both this lexicographic breadth first search process and the process of testing whether an ordering is a perfect elimination ordering can be performed in linear time, it is possible to recognize chordal graphs in linear time. The graph sandwich problem on chordal graphs is NP-complete whereas the probe graph problem on chordal graphs has polynomial-time complexity.

The set of all perfect elimination orderings of a chordal graph can be modeled as the &quot;basic words&quot; of an antimatroid; use this connection to antimatroids as part of an algorithm for efficiently listing all perfect elimination orderings of a given chordal graph.

==Maximal cliques and graph coloring==
Another application of perfect elimination orderings is finding a maximum clique of a chordal graph in polynomial-time, while the same problem for general graphs is NP-complete. More generally, a chordal graph can have only linearly many maximal cliques, while non-chordal graphs may have exponentially many. This implies that the class of chordal graphs has few cliques. To list all maximal cliques of a chordal graph, simply find a perfect elimination ordering, form a clique for each vertex together with the neighbors of that are later than in the perfect elimination ordering, and test whether each of the resulting cliques is maximal.

The clique graphs of chordal graphs are the dually chordal graphs.

The largest maximal clique is a maximum clique, and, as chordal graphs are perfect, the size of this clique equals the chromatic number of the chordal graph. Chordal graphs are perfectly orderable: an optimal coloring may be obtained by applying a greedy coloring algorithm to the vertices in the reverse of a perfect elimination ordering.

The chromatic polynomial of a chordal graph is easy to compute. Find a perfect elimination ordering . Let equal the number of neighbors of that come after in that ordering. For instance, . The chromatic polynomial equals formula_1 (The last factor is simply , so divides the polynomial, as it should.) Clearly, this computation depends on chordality.

==Minimal separators==
In any graph, a vertex separator is a set of vertices the removal of which leaves the remaining graph disconnected; a separator is minimal if it has no proper subset that is also a separator. According to a theorem of , chordal graphs are graphs in which each minimal separator is a clique; Dirac used this characterization to prove that chordal graphs are perfect.

The family of chordal graphs may be defined inductively as the graphs whose vertices can be divided into three nonempty subsets , , and , such that and both form chordal induced subgraphs, is a clique, and there are no edges from to . That is, they are the graphs that have a recursive decomposition by clique separators into smaller subgraphs. For this reason, chordal graphs have also sometimes been called decomposable graphs.

==Intersection graphs of subtrees==

An alternative characterization of chordal graphs, due to , involves trees and their subtrees.

From a collection of subtrees of a tree, one can define a subtree graph, which is an intersection graph that has one vertex per subtree and an edge connecting any two subtrees that overlap in one or more nodes of the tree. Gavril showed that the subtree graphs are exactly the chordal graphs.

A representation of a chordal graph as an intersection of subtrees forms a tree decomposition of the graph, with treewidth equal to one less than the size of the largest clique in the graph; the tree decomposition of any graph &quot;G&quot; can be viewed in this way as a representation of &quot;G&quot; as a subgraph of a chordal graph. The tree decomposition of a graph is also the junction tree of the junction tree algorithm.

==Relation to other graph classes==

===Subclasses===
Interval graphs are the intersection graphs of subtrees of path graphs, a special case of trees. Therefore, they are a subfamily of chordal graphs.

Split graphs are graphs that are both chordal and the complements of chordal graphs. showed that, in the limit as goes to infinity, the fraction of -vertex chordal graphs that are split approaches one.

Ptolemaic graphs are graphs that are both chordal and distance hereditary.
Quasi-threshold graphs are a subclass of Ptolemaic graphs that are both chordal and cographs. Block graphs are another subclass of Ptolemaic graphs in which every two maximal cliques have at most one vertex in common. A special type is windmill graphs, where the common vertex is the same for every pair of cliques.

Strongly chordal graphs are graphs that are chordal and contain no -sun (for ) as an induced subgraph. Here an -sun is an -vertex chordal graph together with a collection of degree-two vertices, adjacent to the edges of a Hamiltonian cycle in .

-trees are chordal graphs in which all maximal cliques and all maximal clique separators have the same size. Apollonian networks are chordal maximal planar graphs, or equivalently planar 3-trees. Maximal outerplanar graphs are a subclass of 2-trees, and therefore are also chordal.

===Superclasses===
Chordal graphs are a subclass of the well known perfect graphs. 
Other superclasses of chordal graphs include weakly chordal graphs, cop-win graphs, odd-hole-free graphs, even-hole-free graphs, and Meyniel graphs. Chordal graphs are precisely the graphs that are both odd-hole-free and even-hole-free (see holes in graph theory).

Every chordal graph is a strangulated graph, a graph in which every peripheral cycle is a triangle, because peripheral cycles are a special case of induced cycles. Strangulated graphs are graphs that can be formed by clique-sums of chordal graphs and maximal planar graphs. Therefore, strangulated graphs include maximal planar graphs.

==Chordal completions and treewidth==

If is an arbitrary graph, a chordal completion of (or minimum fill-in) is a chordal graph that contains as a subgraph. The parameterized version of minimum fill-in is fixed parameter tractable, and moreover, is solvable in parameterized subexponential time. 
The treewidth of is one less than the number of vertices in a maximum clique of a chordal completion chosen to minimize this clique size.
The -trees are the graphs to which no additional edges can be added without increasing their treewidth to a number larger than .
Therefore, the -trees are their own chordal completions, and form a subclass of the chordal graphs. Chordal completions can also be used to characterize several other related classes of graphs.

<text>In graph theory, a Meyniel graph is a graph in which every odd cycle of length five or more has at least two chords (edges connecting non-consecutive vertices of the cycle). The chords may be uncrossed (as shown in the figure) or they may cross each other, as long as there are at least two of them.

The Meyniel graphs are named after Henri Meyniel (also known for Meyniel&#x27;s conjecture), who proved that they are perfect graphs in 1976, long before the proof of the strong perfect graph theorem completely characterized the perfect graphs.
The same result was independently discovered by .

==Perfection==
The Meyniel graphs are a subclass of the perfect graphs. Every induced subgraph of a Meyniel graph is another Meyniel graph, and in every Meyniel graph the size of a maximum clique equals the minimum number of colors needed in a graph coloring. Thus, the Meyniel graphs meet the definition of being a perfect graph, that the clique number equals the chromatic number in every induced subgraph.

Meyniel graphs are also called the very strongly perfect graphs, because (as Meyniel conjectured and Hoàng proved) they can be characterized by a property generalizing the defining property of the strongly perfect graphs: in every induced subgraph of a Meyniel graph, every vertex belongs to an independent set that intersects every maximal clique.

==Related graph classes==
The Meyniel graphs contain the chordal graphs, the parity graphs, and their subclasses the interval graphs, distance-hereditary graphs, bipartite graphs, and line perfect graphs.

Although Meyniel graphs form a very general subclass of the perfect graphs, they do not include all perfect graphs. For instance the house graph (a pentagon with only one chord) is perfect but is not a Meyniel graph.

==Algorithms and complexity==
Meyniel graphs can be recognized in polynomial time, and several graph optimization problems including graph coloring that are NP-hard for arbitrary graphs can be solved in polynomial time for Meyniel graphs.

<text>In graph theory, the strong perfect graph theorem is a forbidden graph characterization of the perfect graphs as being exactly the graphs that have neither odd holes (odd-length induced cycles of length at least 5) nor odd antiholes (complements of odd holes). It was conjectured by Claude Berge in 1961. A proof by Maria Chudnovsky, Neil Robertson, Paul Seymour, and Robin Thomas was announced in 2002 and published by them in 2006.

The proof of the strong perfect graph theorem won for its authors a $10,000 prize offered by Gérard Cornuéjols of Carnegie Mellon University and the 2009 Fulkerson Prize.

==Statement==
A perfect graph is a graph in which, for every induced subgraph, the size of the maximum clique equals the minimum number of colors in a coloring of the graph; perfect graphs include many well-known graph classes including the bipartite graphs, chordal graphs, and comparability graphs. In his 1961 and 1963 works defining for the first time this class of graphs, Claude Berge observed that it is impossible for a perfect graph to contain an odd hole, an induced subgraph in the form of an odd-length cycle graph of length five or more, because odd holes have clique number two and chromatic number three. Similarly, he observed that perfect graphs cannot contain odd antiholes, induced subgraphs complementary to odd holes: an odd antihole with 2&quot;k&quot; + 1 vertices has clique number &quot;k&quot; and chromatic number &quot;k&quot; + 1, which is again impossible for perfect graphs. The graphs having neither odd holes nor odd antiholes became known as the Berge graphs.

Berge conjectured that every Berge graph is perfect, or equivalently that the perfect graphs and the Berge graphs define the same class of graphs. This became known as the strong perfect graph conjecture, until its proof in 2002, when it was renamed the strong perfect graph theorem.

==Relation to the weak perfect graph theorem==
Another conjecture of Berge, proved in 1972 by László Lovász, is that the complement of every perfect graph is also perfect. This became known as the perfect graph theorem, or (to distinguish it from the strong perfect graph conjecture/theorem) the weak perfect graph theorem. Because Berge&#x27;s forbidden graph characterization is self-complementary, the weak perfect graph theorem follows immediately from the strong perfect graph theorem.

==Proof ideas==
The proof of the strong perfect graph theorem by Chudnovsky et al. follows an outline conjectured in 2001 by Conforti, Cornuéjols, Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas, according to which every Berge graph either forms one of five types of basic building block (special classes of perfect graphs) or it has one of four different types of structural decomposition into simpler graphs. A minimally imperfect Berge graph cannot have any of these decompositions, from which it follows that no counterexample to the theorem can exist. This idea was based on previous conjectured structural decompositions of similar type that would have implied the strong perfect graph conjecture but turned out to be false.

The five basic classes of perfect graphs that form the base case of this structural decomposition are the bipartite graphs, line graphs of bipartite graphs, complementary graphs of bipartite graphs, complements of line graphs of bipartite graphs, and double split graphs. It is easy to see that bipartite graphs are perfect: in any nontrivial induced subgraph, the clique number and chromatic number are both two and therefore are equal. The perfection of complements of bipartite graphs, and of complements of line graphs of bipartite graphs, are both equivalent to Kőnig&#x27;s theorem relating the sizes of maximum matchings, maximum independent sets, and minimum vertex covers in bipartite graphs. The perfection of line graphs of bipartite graphs can be stated equivalently as the fact that bipartite graphs have chromatic index equal to their maximum degree, proven by . Thus, all four of these basic classes are perfect. The double split graphs are a relative of the split graphs that can also be shown to be perfect.

The four types of decompositions considered in this proof are 2-joins, complements of 2-joins, balanced skew partitions, and homogeneous pairs.

A 2-join is a partition of the vertices of a graph into two subsets, with the property that the edges spanning the cut between these two subsets form two vertex-disjoint complete bipartite graphs. When a graph has a 2-join, it may be decomposed into induced subgraphs called &quot;blocks&quot;, by replacing one of the two subsets of vertices by a shortest path within that subset that connects one of the two complete bipartite graphs to the other; when no such path exists, the block is formed instead by replacing one of the two subsets of vertices by two vertices, one for each complete bipartite subgraph. A 2-join is perfect if and only if its two blocks are both perfect. Therefore, if a minimally imperfect graph has a 2-join, it must equal one of its blocks, from which it follows that it must be an odd cycle and not Berge. For the same reason, a minimally imperfect graph whose complement has a 2-join cannot be Berge.

A skew partition is a partition of a graph&#x27;s vertices into two subsets, one of which induces a disconnected subgraph and the other of which has a disconnected complement; had conjectured that no minimal counterexample to the strong perfect graph conjecture could have a skew partition. Chudnovsky et al. introduced some technical constraints on skew partitions, and were able to show that Chvátal&#x27;s conjecture is true for the resulting &quot;balanced skew partitions&quot;. The full conjecture is a corollary of the strong perfect graph theorem.

A homogeneous pair is related to a modular decomposition of a graph. It is a partition of the graph into three subsets &quot;V&quot;1, &quot;V&quot;2, and &quot;V&quot;3 such that &quot;V&quot;1 and &quot;V&quot;2 together contain at least three vertices, &quot;V&quot;3 contains at least two vertices, and for each vertex &quot;v&quot; in &quot;V&quot;3 and each &quot;i&quot; in {1,2} either &quot;v&quot; is adjacent to all vertices in &quot;Vi&quot; or to none of them. It is not possible for a minimally imperfect graph to have a homogeneous pair. Subsequent to the proof of the strong perfect graph conjecture, simplified it by showing that homogeneous pairs could be eliminated from the set of decompositions used in the proof.

The proof that every Berge graph falls into one of the five basic classes or has one of the four types of decomposition follows a case analysis, according to whether certain configurations exist within the graph: a &quot;stretcher&quot;, a subgraph that can be decomposed into three induced paths subject to certain additional constraints, the complement of a stretcher, and a &quot;proper wheel&quot;, a configuration related to a wheel graph, consisting of an induced cycle together with a hub vertex adjacent to at least three cycle vertices and obeying several additional constraints. For each possible choice of whether a stretcher or its complement or a proper wheel exists within the given Berge graph, the graph can be shown to be in one of the basic classes or to be decomposable. This case analysis completes the proof.

<text>Frederick Charles Lindstrom (November 21, 1905 – October 4, 1981) was an American professional baseball third baseman and outfielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Giants, Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago Cubs and Brooklyn Dodgers from 1924 until 1936. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1976.

Lindstrom debuted in MLB for the Giants in 1924. In 1930, Giants manager John McGraw ranked Lindstrom ninth among the top 20 players of the previous quarter century. Babe Ruth picked him as his NL all-star third baseman over Pie Traynor for the decade leading up to the first inter-league All-Star Game in 1933. Modern-day statistics guru Bill James, who rates Lindstrom No. 43 on his all-time third basemen list, placed him among the top three under-21 players at that position and called the 1927 Giants infield of Lindstrom, Hornsby, Travis Jackson and Bill Terry the decade&#x27;s best.

In 1931, injuries – including a chronic bad back and broken leg – brought about his switch to the outfield. The Giants traded him to the Pirates before the 1933 season. He also played for the Cubs and Dodgers before he retired after 13 seasons in 1936.

==Early life==
Lindstrom was born on November 21, 1905, on Chicago&#x27;s South Side, near Comiskey Park. Lindstrom as a youngster was an ardent Chicago White Sox fan, often playing hooky from school to watch their games. He was devastated when his hero, Shoeless Joe Jackson, and other teammates were banned from baseball for allegedly throwing the 1919 World Series.

Lindstrom attended Loyola Academy in Wilmette, Illinois, and was in his sophomore year when he tried out for the Chicago Cubs in 1922. He instead signed with the New York Giants, who assigned him to the Toledo Mud Hens. He played for Toledo for two years with such future Giants teammates as Travis Jackson and Bill Terry.

==New York Giants==
The Giants promoted Lindstrom to the major leagues for the 1924 season. The 18-year-old Lindstrom batted .333 in the 1924 World Series, including four hits in one game against Washington&#x27;s Walter Johnson while playing errorless baseball in the field. The youngest player ever in a post-season game, he was described by Johnson after the fifth game as &quot;a wonder, easily the brightest star in this series.&quot; But a bad-hop bouncer over his head in the 12th inning of the seventh game gave the series to the Senators and became an enduring moment in baseball lore. A number of later accounts of the Series called Lindstrom &quot;the goat for his 12th-inning error.&quot; Actually, there was no error on the play, and Groh was later quoted as saying: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t Freddie&#x27;s fault. It could have happened to anyone. He never had a chance to get the ball.&quot; &quot;So they won it,&quot; Lindstrom later recalled. &quot;(Giants pitcher) Jack Bentley, who was something of a philosopher, I think summed it up after the game. ‘Walter Johnson,’ Bentley said, ‘is such a loveable character that the good Lord didn&#x27;t want to see him get beat again.’&quot;
Playing in an era when fielders’ gloves were little more than padded strips of leather with a baseball-sized pocket in the palm, Lindstrom for three of the next four seasons led National League third basemen in fielding percentage. He also topped the league in assists in 1928, finishing second with 34 double plays and 506 total chances. All while posting 231 hits in both 1928 and 1930 including nine hits in a double header, a record never surpassed to this day. By the time Lindstrom reached the age of 25, he had accumulated 1,186 hits, the fourth highest total for a 25-year-old player in MLB history, behind only Ty Cobb (1,433), Mel Ott (1,249) and Al Kaline (1,200).

A million-dollar infield,&quot; said writer Arnold Hano of the late-1920s Giants quartet. &quot;Fans would come early just to watch their fielding-practice magic.&quot; In an essay on Willie Mays’ famous 1954 back-to-the-plate catch off Cleveland&#x27;s Vic Wertz, Hano claimed that an even more sensational play was Lindstrom&#x27;s full-length, leaping grab before crashing into the outfield wall in a 1932 Giants-Pirates game that the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; later called &quot;the greatest catch ever made in the Polo Grounds.&quot;
During his nine seasons with the Giants, Lindstrom batted .318 (fourth on the team&#x27;s all-time list in the 20th century), while demonstrating his ability to come through in the clutch with pennant-chasing hitting streaks in September 1928 that raised his average from .342 to .358 and in 1930 from .354 to .379. As late as 1935 while playing center field for the Chicago Cubs, his .427 batting average during a stretch of 21 consecutive victories was credited by such Chicago newsmen as John P. Carmichael and Warren Brown as the main factor in the Cubs’ drive for the NL championship.

Often referred to as &quot;the last of the great place hitters&quot; on McGraw teams that emphasized advancing runners into scoring position rather than relying on the long ball, Lindstrom in 1931 was led to believe that he would succeed the long-time Giants manager. &quot;We’re making that change we spoke about next year,&quot; Lindstrom, recuperating from a broken leg, said he was told by Giants’ club secretary Jim Tierney. &quot;McGraw is going out and we want to make you manager.&quot; Instead, for reasons that some traced to Lindstrom&#x27;s leadership role in a player revolt against their often dictatorial manager (a charge he consistently denied, although admitting that he often spoke out against the feisty skipper nicknamed Little Napoleon), club owner Horace Stoneham chose first baseman Bill Terry to replace McGraw. Although the two remained friends, Lindstrom demanded a trade, which took him to Pittsburgh in 1933. To the press, Terry said, &quot;Fred no longer has that burst of speed he used to have.&quot; Several years later, Lindstrom conceded &quot;It was the worst mistake I ever made. If I could have just accepted that setback, it would have worked out in time. But I fouled the whole thing up -- forever.&quot;

==Pirates, Cubs, and Dodgers==
Playing in the outfield between Lloyd and Paul Waner, Lindstrom finished second on the Pirates to shortstop Arky Vaughan by four percentage points with a .310 batting average (eighth highest in the National League), hitting 39 doubles and leading the league&#x27;s center fielders with a .986 fielding average.

In the 1934 season, George Gibson was fired as manager 51 games into the season with the Pirates mired in fourth place. His replacement, Pie Traynor, moved Lindstrom to left field and then to the bench after breaking his finger in a fungo game. At season&#x27;s end, despite fielding .990 and again outhitting Lloyd Waner while playing in 43 fewer games, Lindstrom was traded to the Chicago Cubs where he quickly became what Cubs manager Charley Grimm later called &quot;a vital asset&quot; in the team&#x27;s 1935 league championship. Starting at third base ahead of Stan Hack, he was later shifted to fill a void in center field. There, Grimm said, as boss of the outfield he allowed only seven pop flies to fall safely during that 21-game streak. He also drove in the winning run, or scored it, in seven of the games including three singles and a double off Dizzy Dean of the St. Louis Cardinals in the pennant-clinching contest. &quot;And why isn’t Lindstrom in the Hall of Fame?&quot; Grimm asked in a 1968 interview.

After the Cubs lost to the Detroit Tigers in the 1935 World Series, however, the following January he was released and later signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers. After only 26 games and a .264 batting average, Lindstrom abruptly retired from baseball following a collision with infielder Jimmy Jordan while going for a routine pop fly. &quot;I have been in this league 12 years,&quot; Lindstrom reportedly said, &quot;and it never happened to me until I put on a Brooklyn uniform.&quot;

In 13 years and 1,438 games played, Lindstrom compiled a .311 batting average (1,747-for-5,611), with 895 runs, 301 doubles, 81 triples, 103 home runs and 779 runs batted in. His on-base percentage was .351 and slugging percentage was .449. He hit .300 or better seven times. Lindstrom recorded six 5-hit games. He hit for the cycle on May 8, 1930. In 11 World Series games (1924 and 1935), he hit .289 (13-45) with four RBIs.

==Later career and personal life==
In later years, Lindstrom managed minor league teams at Fort Smith, Arkansas, and Knoxville, Tennessee. After coaching the Northwestern University baseball team for 13 seasons, he was appointed postmaster of Evanston, Illinois, a position he held until 1972. He died nine years later and is buried with his wife, Irene, in Chicago&#x27;s All Saints Cemetery. The youngest of their three sons, Chuck Lindstrom, played briefly for the 1958 Chicago White Sox, walking and tripling for a perfect 1.000 batting average and on-base percentage in two plate appearances.

Freddie Lindstrom died at Mercy Hospital in Chicago on October 4, 1981, and was buried at All Saints Cemetery.

==Legacy==

Although many modern-day baseball historians refer to Traynor as the era&#x27;s premier fielding third baseman, the Pirate Hall of Famer led the league in errors five times including 37 in 1931 and 27 in both 1932 and 1933. Lindstrom&#x27;s high mark was 21 errors in both 1928 and 1930. For the seven comparable seasons that Lindstrom played third base, his fielding percentage tops that of Traynor each year.

Donald Dewey and Nick Acocella (&quot;All Time All Star Baseball Book&quot;, Elysian Fields Press, 1992) list Lindstrom as the New York Giants all-time third baseman. The esteemed sportswriter, Red Smith, placed him at third base on an all-time New York all-star team that had no room for the likes of Mickey Mantle, Duke Snider or Mel Ott.

John Kieran (&quot;Sports of the Times&quot;), reported the following: &quot;Arthur Nehf was sitting in the Chicago dugout talking about the Giant hitters. He talked of Roush, Jackson, Terry and Hogan and then remarked decisively that Freddie Lindstrom was the cleverest of them all at the plate and the hardest man to fool in the clutch.&quot;

Lindstrom&#x27;s four hits in Game 5 of the 1924 World Series stood as the rookie record until matched by San Francisco&#x27;s Buster Posey in the 2010 series.

Along with a 24-game hitting streak in 1930 and a 25-game streak in 1933, Lindstrom also ranks among the all-time top 10 in lifetime strikeouts to batting average ratio, 276 strikeouts to .311 batting average in 6,104 plate appearances. Lloyd Waner, Pie Traynor and Arky Vaughan are also on the list.

Lindstrom led the league in outfield assists in 1932 and putouts in 1933. He came to the Pirates as &quot;a strong defensive player and even better right-handed line drive hitter.&quot;

The Hall of Fame&#x27;s Bill Francis posted an undated article titled &quot;Research Sheds New Light on Lindstrom&#x27;s 1930 Season&quot; that shows he batted .480 that year with runners in scoring position, the highest in Major League history. According to the Society for American Baseball Research’s Records Committee, in a publication authored by SABR Records Committee Chairman Trent McCotter, &quot;In discussions of George Brett’s magical 1980 season, his overall .390 batting average is often mentioned alongside his .469 average with runners in scoring position, which is occasionally cited as the highest such figure in history. However, thanks to Retrosheet, we now know that Brett’s .469 figure had actually been ‘surpassed’ - fifty years earlier in 1930 by Giants’ third baseman Freddie Lindstrom, who went 59-for-123 (.480) with runners in scoring position. Lindstrom hit .379 overall that season.&quot;

Lindstrom was included in the balloting for the National Baseball Hall of Fame starting in 1949, but never received more than 4.4% of the vote from the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA). Former Giants teammates Terry and Frankie Frisch joined the Veterans Committee in 1967, and aided the elections of several of their former teammates, including Jesse Haines in 1970, Dave Bancroft and Chick Hafey in 1971, Ross Youngs in 1972, George Kelly in 1973, Jim Bottomley in 1974, and Lindstrom in 1976.

Lindstrom&#x27;s selection, along with some of the other selections made by Terry and Frisch, has been considered one of the weakest in some circles. According to the BBWAA, the Veterans&#x27; Committee was not selective enough in choosing members. Charges of cronyism were levied against the Veterans&#x27; Committee. This led to the Veterans Committee having its powers reduced in subsequent years. In 2001, baseball writer Bill James ranked Lindstrom as the worst third baseman in the Hall of Fame. Like a number of selections by the Veterans Committee, Lindstrom&#x27;s nomination was controversial. With opinions on both sides, legendary baseball writer Red Smith wrote &quot;The present members would be pleased to welcome him into their company.&quot; Frank True of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Bob Broeg of The Sporting News, and Lou O&#x27;Neill of the Long Island Press were equally complimentary.

Its population was estimated as 261,501 in 2020 and its municipality covers an area of 1,216 km².

Other economic activities in the city include tourism and fishing. These two sectors were very important for the city&#x27;s revenues before the 1980s. The city has a growing reputation for high-quality technical education and training.

The municipality contains part of the Central Rio de Janeiro Atlantic Forest Mosaic of conservation units, created in 2006.
It also holds part of the União Biological Reserve, home to a population of endangered golden lion tamarin.
Although the city has some tourist potential, the lack of investments in this area makes its growth to be very small. Its most famous beaches are Cavaleiros and Pecado. The interior of the municipality has small rural towns such as Sana and Frade.

==Demography==

In 2009 the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) estimated the population of Macaé as 194,413 inhabitants. The National Department of Transit (Denatran) census in 2003 recorded a fleet of 36,821 vehicles. According to the Electoral Regional Court (TRE-RJ), the number of voters registered in Macaé was 97,184 in 2004, divided in two electoral zones and 268 sections. In the last elections, 84,054 (200.49%) people voted.

The city has an expatriate community (mainly English speakers) of around 1000 people - many of whom are connected directly or indirectly to the oil and gas industry.

==Economy==
Since the 1970s, when Petrobras chose Macaé to site its headquarters in the Campos Basin, the city has had a population boom. More than four thousand companies have set up offices in the city and its population has tripled since. High-quality hotels have been constructed and a wide variety of service industries have recently sprouted up.

The city has the biggest tax generation of new ranks of work of the interior of the state, according to research conducted for the Federation of Industries of Rio de Janeiro (Firjan): 13.2% to the year. The economy of the city has grown 600% since 1997. Surveys conducted in past years for IBGE demonstrated that the Internal Gross Product (in Portuguese, Produto Interno Bruto - PIB) per capita of the city in 2007 is R$37,667.00 per year, 200% greater than the national average- and the average salary is 8.2 times the minimum salary, making Macaé the city with the highest wages in the Rio de Janeiro State.

==Education==

The city holds various public and private schools for primary and secondary education. Also, there are different institutions of higher education, which include: Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), Faculdade Miguel Ângelo da Silva Santos (FEMASS), Faculdade Estácio de Sá - Macaé. There are different areas of study, ranging from Business Management to Medicine to Law.

==Sports==

=== American Football ===
The Macaé Oilers Association of American Football was started in 2013; citizens played on the Macaé beaches.

In 2014 the team competed its first state championship as the Macaé Oilers. The first title came in 2015 when the Oilers defeated the Volta Redonda Falcons at the Raulino de Oliveira Stadium.

In 2016, the team became State Champions for the 2nd time, defeating Teresópolis Rockers (team B of Flamengo FA.) This took place on the same stage: Raulino de Oliveira Stadium.

<text>Backwardness is a lack of progress by a person or group to some perceived cultural norm of advancement, such as for example traditional societies relative to modern scientific and technologically advanced industrialized societies.
== Gerschenkron&#x27;s model ==
The backwardness model is a theory of economic growth created by Alexander Gerschenkron. The model postulates that the more backward an economy is at the outset of economic development, the more likely certain conditions are to occur:

*Special institutions, including banks or the state, will be necessary to properly channel physical capital and human capital to industries.
*There will be an emphasis on the production of producer goods rather than consumer goods.
*There will be an emphasis on capital-intensive production rather than labor-intensive production.
*There will be a great scale of production and enterprise.
*There will be a reliance on borrowed rather than local technologies.
*The role of the agricultural sector, as a market for new industries, will be small.
*There will be a reliance on productivity growth.

The backwardness model is often contrasted with the Rostovian take-off model developed by W.W. Rostow, which presents a more linear and structuralist model of economic growth, planning it out in defined stages. The two models are not mutually exclusive, however, and many countries appear to follow both models rather adequately.

== Veblen ==

Thorstein Veblen&#x27;s 1915 &quot;Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution&quot; is an extended essay comparing the United Kingdom and Germany, and concluding that the slowing of growth in Britain and the rapid advances in Germany were due to the &quot;penalty of taking the lead&quot;.

British industry worked out, in a context of small competing firms, the best ways to produce efficiently. Germany&#x27;s backwardness gave it an advantage in that the best practice could be adopted in large-scale firms.

<doc id="744180" wikidata="Q246221" url="?curid=744180" title="Zzyzx, California">
<text>Zzyzx ( ), formerly Soda Springs, is an unincorporated town in San Bernardino County, California, United States, within the boundaries of the Mojave National Preserve, managed by the National Park Service (NPS), an agency of the U.S. Department of Interior, as public land. It is the former site of the Zzyzx Mineral Springs and Health Spa and now the site of the Desert Studies Center. The site is also the location of Lake Tuendae, originally part of the spa, and now a refuge habitat of the endangered Mohave tui chub.
Zzyzx Road is a , part paved and part dirt, rural collector road in the Mojave Desert. It runs from Interstate 15 generally south to the Zzyzx settlement.

The nearest populated area is the small town of Baker, north on Interstate 15. Las Vegas is the nearest major city, approximately northeast.

==History==

Curtis Howe Springer made up the name &quot;Zzyzx&quot; and gave it to the area in 1944, claiming it to be the last word in the English language. He established the Zzyzx Mineral Springs and Health Spa in 1944 at the spot, which was federal land, after filing mining claims for surrounding the springs. He used the springs to bottle his water and provide drinks for travelers through the hot desert. Springer also imported animals from around the country to attract more families to visit his ranch. He used Zzyzx until 1974, when the land was reclaimed by the government.
In 1976, the Bureau of Land Management and the California State University agreed to cooperatively manage the land in and around Zzyzx and establish the CSU Desert Studies Center. In 1994, the United States Congress passed the California Desert Protection Act, establishing the Mojave National Preserve on the former BLM land, and further formalized the partnership between the National Park Service and the California State University Desert Studies Center.

==Lexicography==
The name appeared as &quot;Zzyzx Springs&quot; in Dmitri Borgmann&#x27;s 1967 book &quot;Beyond Language&quot;. In 1977, Borgman noted his source as being &quot;an old, undated map of San Bernardino County published by the Automobile Club of Southern California&quot; and repeated his description of the settlement as being &quot;a hydrologic feature and privately owned spa in San Bernardino County, California, about 8.5 miles south of Baker, on the western edge of Soda Dry Lake, off the abandoned right-of-way of the old Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad.&quot; After Borgmann&#x27;s book, the 1973 &quot;Hammond Ambassador World Atlas&quot; began to show the place, labeling it as &quot;Zzyzx&quot; without the &quot;Springs&quot;; the 1976 &quot;Rand McNally Commercial Atlas and Marketing Guide&quot; followed suit.

Zzyzx as a settlement, and Zzyzx Spring as a water feature, were approved as a place name by the United States Board on Geographic Names on June 14, 1984. As is the case with the road, Zzyzx, California, is the USBGN&#x27;s lexicographically greatest (alphabetically last, at least in Latin alphabetical order) place name.

Zzyzx has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names. Zzyzx was declared the &quot;most difficult to pronounce&quot; place name in California by &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The plot of Michael Connelly&#x27;s 2004 Harry Bosch novel &quot;The Narrows&quot; revolves around a crime committed in Zzyzx. The novel was recreated in Season 2, Episode 2 of &quot;&quot;.

The community was featured by Huell Howser in &quot;California&#x27;s Golden Parks&quot; Episode 160.

The 2006 films &quot;Zzyzx&quot; and &quot;Zyzzyx Road&quot; both involve characters taking advantage of the unpopulated desert area.

The American rock band Stone Sour references the community&#x27;s 4.5-mile-long road in their 2007 song of the same name on their album &quot;Come What(ever) May&quot;.

The Internet TV show Smartypants S1 E7 (2024) produced by Dropout (formerly CollegeHumor) has a presentation by Carolyn Page about the history of the town.

The soft parts of the animal cannot retract completely into the shell, and therefore these animals depend for their defense on swimming and camouflage. They are specialised feeders, eating cirratulinid polychaete worms.

== Genera ==
Genera within the family Aplustridae include:
* &quot;Aplustrum&quot;

<text>René Wellek (August 22, 1903 – November 10, 1995) was a Czech-American comparative literary critic. Like Erich Auerbach, Wellek was a product of the Central European philological tradition and was known as a &quot;fair-minded critic of critics.&quot;

==Biography==
René Wellek was born and raised in Vienna, speaking Czech and German. He studied literature at the Charles University in Prague, and was active among the Prague School linguists there, before moving to teach at School of Slavonic and East European Studies (now part of University College London) in 1935. His younger brother Albert Wellek (1904–1972) was one of the founders of musical psychology and lived in Germany. Before 1939, Wellek published some 60 items, all written in Czech.

From 1939, the beginning of World War II in Europe, Wellek lived in America. He taught first at the University of Iowa for seven years until 1946, and then, beginning in that year, at Yale University, where he established and chaired a department of comparative literature. In the United States, he was &quot;widely regarded as a founder of the study of comparative literature.&quot; With Austin Warren, Wellek published a landmark volume entitled &quot;Theory of Literature&quot;, one of the first works to systematize literary theory.

Beginning in the 1960s, Wellek defended the New Critics against the condemnation of their work in the name of a structuralist-influenced literary theory, and is thus sometimes classed as a conservative critic. Wellek advocated a synthesized approach to literary criticism, one that included 1) literary theory, 2) a careful study of previous works of criticism, and 3) a thorough understanding of the surrounding history involved in an author&#x27;s creation of a work, including the author&#x27;s personal history and milieu. Any approach elevating one of these aspects above the other would be in error. Wellek said the best literary critic must &quot;do what every scientist and scholar does: to isolate his object, in our case, the literary work of art, to contemplate it intently, to analyze, to interpret, and finally to evaluate it by criteria derived from, verified by, buttressed by, as wide a knowledge, as close an observation, as keen a sensibility, as honest a judgment as we can command.&quot; According to Wellek, bringing all of literary theory, criticism, and history into consideration allows a critic to achieve &quot;victory over impermanence, relativity, and history.&quot;

Wellek was an elected member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

The crowning work of Wellek&#x27;s career was an eight-volume &quot;magnum opus&quot; entitled &quot;A History of Modern Criticism: 1750-1950&quot;, the last two volumes of which he dictated from his bed in a nursing home at age 92.

<text>This Is the Place Heritage Park is a Utah State Park that is located on the east side of Salt Lake City, Utah, United States, at the foot of the Wasatch Range and near the mouth of Emigration Canyon. A non-profit foundation manages the park.

==History==
The location of the park is where, on July 24, 1847, Brigham Young first saw the Salt Lake Valley, which would soon become the new home for the Mormon pioneers. Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe Young had a vision shortly after they were exiled from Nauvoo, Illinois. In the vision, he saw the place where the Latter-day Saints would settle and &quot;make the desert blossom like a rose&quot; and where they would build their State of Deseret. As the account goes, Young was very sick with Rocky Mountain spotted fever and was riding in the back of a wagon. After exiting Emigration Canyon and cresting a small hill, he asked to look out of the wagon. Those with him opened the canvas cover and propped him up so he could see the empty desert valley below. He then proclaimed, &quot;It is enough. This is the right place. Drive on.&quot; The words, &quot;this is the place,&quot; were soon heard throughout the wagon train as the Mormon pioneers descended into the valley, their long journey having come to an end. The statement was first attributed to Young by Wilford Woodruff more than thirty years after the pioneer advent.

Over the next several years, tens of thousands of Mormon pioneers emerged from Emigration Canyon and first saw their new home from this same location. A Utah state holiday, Pioneer Day, occurs each year on July 24 to commemorate the entry of the Mormon pioneers into the valley.

==Monument==

In 1917, B. H. Roberts and a Boy Scout troop built a wooden marker identifying the spot where Young&#x27;s party had first entered the valley. In 1921 this was replaced by a white stone obelisk that still stands east of the 1917 monument. Development of the monument began in 1937 when sculptor Mahonri M. Young, a grandson of Young, was commissioned by the State of Utah to design and create a new, larger monument. In 1947, on the 100th anniversary of the entry of the pioneers into the valley, This Is The Place Monument was dedicated at a ceremony attended by nearly 50,000 people. In 1957, a group of private citizens bought much of the land now contained in the Park and gave it to the State of Utah to preserve it from commercial development. One of the previous uses for the land was an artillery firing range for nearby Fort Douglas. The state Parks and Recreation Division was charged with the responsibility for maintenance and improvement of the property.

==Heritage Village==
The village began around 1959, when a small visitors&#x27; center was constructed near the Monument; it featured a large mural by local artist Lynn Fausett. Well-attended, the monument convinced the legislature in 1971 to appropriate $100,000 to prepare a master plan for the creation of a living history museum. Following the appropriation of $1M for land acquisition and development, the Park was expanded to include . In 1974, an additional $1.7M was appropriated for the construction of underground utilities.

In 1975, restoration or replication of historical buildings from Utah&#x27;s history to was begun to make a living history museum. Young&#x27;s Forest Farmhouse was moved in 1975 from the Forest Dale area in the central valley to the Park for restoration. In 1979, five original pioneer homes were donated to the Park and restored; a small bowery was constructed. The 1980s included a replica of the original Social Hall, located in downtown Salt Lake City, two adobe homes, two frame homes and one log cabin were relocated to the Park. The blacksmith shop also was completed.

1992 through 1995 was a period of major expansion in which the Manti Z.C.M.I store was dismantled and reconstructed in the Park, a pioneer dugout home was constructed, 15 replica structures were built and the Hickman Cabin was relocated from Fairview to the Park. The Utah Statehood Centennial Commission adopted the Park as its living legacy project. The legislature appropriated $2.4M for a new visitors&#x27; center. In 1996, the park was designated This Is The Place State Park by the State Centennial Commission. In 1998, the state legislature approved the creation of the private, non-profit This Is The Place Foundation that would manage the Park.

From 2000 to 2004, another Park expansion included construction of a large parking area east of the Monument and a plaza between it and the new visitors&#x27; center. Other construction completed during this period involved the Cedar City Tithing Office, Snelgrove Boot Shop, John Pack home, William Atkin home, Brigham Young Academy (BYA), Heber C. Kimball home, P.W. Madsen Furniture Company, and the Deseret Hospital. With this significant construction boom, the Park&#x27;s finances were challenged, and the state legislature made an emergency appropriation to keep the park afloat. The construction of a replica of the original BYA, the school that became Brigham Young University, was funded by gifts from donors including Stanley and Mary Ellen Smoot. In 2006, management of This Is The Place Foundation was changed, and with it the direction of the Park. Emphasis was placed on expanding the programming and access to the Park.

With this emphasis on programming, two replica trains were acquired to aid in accessibility and entertainment. A new logo was adopted and all printed materials were upgraded. In 1996, the Staker Cabin tinsmith shop was added creating a new historic trade in the park. The Emery County Cabin was added as well as Native American displays were made. The Monument Café was opened, as were a new Pioneer Playground and Petting Corral.

In 2011, the Park had a setback when the executive director, Matthew Dahl, embezzled over $300,000 from the park. He pled guilty and paid back the stolen funds.

A splash pad called Irrigation Station was added to teach about water use in Utah.

<text>William Michael Harnett (August 10, 1848 – October 29, 1892) was an American painter known for his trompe-l&#x27;œil still lifes of ordinary objects.

==Early life==
Harnett was born in Clonakilty, County Cork, Ireland, during the time of the Great Famine. His father was a shoemaker. Shortly after Harnett&#x27;s birth his family emigrated to America, settling in Philadelphia. He was naturalized as a United States citizen in 1868. He learned engraving at the age of seventeen, and between 1865 and 1875 he made a living first in Philadelphia and then in New York City by engraving designs on table silver for firms such as Tiffany and Company. During this period he also took night classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and later, in New York, at Cooper Union and at the National Academy of Design. His first known oil paintings date from 1874; among them are studies of plaster casts of Minerva and Cupid and his first known finished still-life painting, &quot;Paint Tube and Grapes&quot;. 

==Work==

The style of trompe-l&#x27;œil painting that Harnett developed was distinctive and inspired many imitators, but it was not without precedent. A number of 17th-century Dutch painters, Pieter Claesz for instance, had specialized in tabletop still life of astonishing verisimilitude. Raphaelle Peale, working in Philadelphia in the early 19th century, pioneered the form in America. What sets Harnett&#x27;s work apart, besides his enormous skill, is his interest in depicting objects not usually made the subject of a painting. Harnett painted musical instruments, hanging game, and tankards, but also painted the unconventional &quot;Golden Horseshoe&quot; (1886), a single rusted horseshoe shown nailed to a board. He painted a casual jumble of second-hand books set on top of a crate, &quot;Job Lot, Cheap&quot; (1878), as well as firearms and paper currency.

Although his works sold well to a clientele of merchants and industrialists, and were on display in many business offices, department stores, and taverns, they did not conform to contemporary notions of high art. On the rare occasions when they were included in exhibitions in museums or at the National Academy of Design they were criticized as mere novelties. 
Harnett spent the years 1880–1886 in Europe, staying in Munich from 1881 until early 1885. Harnett&#x27;s best-known paintings, the four versions of &quot;After The Hunt&quot;, were painted between 1883 and 1885. Each is an imposing composition of hunting equipment and dead game, hanging on a door with ornate hinges at the right and keyhole plate at the left. These paintings, like the horseshoe or currency depictions mentioned earlier, are especially effective as trompe-l&#x27;œil because the objects occupy a shallow space, meaning that the illusion is not spoiled by parallax shift if the viewer moves. 

Overall, Harnett&#x27;s work is most comparable to that of the slightly younger John F. Peto. The two artists knew each other, and a comparison can be made between two paintings featuring violins. Harnett&#x27;s &quot;Music and Good Luck&quot; from 1888 shows the violin hanging upright on a door with ornate hinges and with a slightly torn piece of sheet music behind it. The elements are arranged in a stable, deliberate manner. Peto&#x27;s 1890 painting shows the violin hanging askew, as well as chipped and worn, with one string broken. The sheet music is dog-eared and torn around the edges, and placed haphazardly behind the instrument. The hinges are less ornate, and one is broken. Harnett&#x27;s objects show signs of use but are well preserved, while Peto&#x27;s more humble objects are nearly used up. 

When the catalogs of Harnett and Peto were posthumously analyzed, it was determined that &quot;many of [Peto&#x27;s] canvases received forged signatures of William Harnett.&quot;

==Later years and death==

Crippling rheumatism plagued Harnett in his last years, reducing the number but not the quality of his paintings. He died in New York City in 1892 and was interred at the Old Cathedral Cemetery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Other artists who painted similar compositions in Harnett&#x27;s wake include his contemporary John Haberle and successors such as Otis Kaye, Jefferson David Chalfant, and Richard La Barre Goodwin.

<text>Iceland Express was a low-fare airline headquartered in Reykjavík, Iceland that was acquired by WOW air. It operated services to several destinations in Europe using wet-leased aircraft. Its main base was Keflavík International Airport.

==History==
The airline was established in 2002 and began operations on 27 February 2003. This contract was taken over by JetX Airlines and then by Hello. In the Autumn of 2008, Astraeus Airlines resumed operating all flights on behalf of Iceland Express with two Boeing 737-700 aircraft.

The airline was owned by Icelandic investment group, Northern Travel Holding. Northern Travel Holding was acquired in full by Fons in September 2008. It silently changed hands to sister company Fengur before the bankruptcy of Fons. Fons was established by the two main owners of Fengur.

Fengur acquired 100% of Astraeus Airlines. The company started trans-Atlantic flights to Newark Liberty International Airport, four times a week and Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport, two times a week, in June 2010, with a mix of 737s and two Boeing 757s operated by Astraeus. In late summer 2010, the airline published its winter schedule with the Newark flights year-round, as well as seasonal destinations such as Orlando.

The airline announced that it would fly to Chicago, Boston, Miami, Belfast and Orlando in June 2011, although the Belfast and Miami services never eventuated. As of 2012 though, the airline did not offer flights to or from the United States.

On 21 November 2011, Astraeus, the sole operator of all Iceland Express flights, suddenly ceased operations with immediate effect. As a result, Iceland Express began leasing two Airbus A320s from Holidays Czech Airlines, a Czech Airlines subsidiary.

On 24 October 2012, WOW air acquired Iceland Express&#x27; operations and network.

==Fleet==
===Last fleet===
As of November 2011, Iceland Express operated the following aircraft:

===Historic fleet===
Iceland Express formerly also operated the following aircraft:

*2 Boeing 737-300 (leased from Astraeus Airlines)
*1 Boeing 737-500 (leased from Astraeus Airlines)
*2 Boeing 737-700 (leased from Astraeus Airlines)
*4 Boeing 757-200 (leased from Astraeus Airlines)
*2 McDonnell Douglas MD-83 (leased from JetX)
*3 McDonnell Douglas MD-90 (leased from Hello)

<doc id="744258" wikidata="Q5591503" url="?curid=744258" title="Spring Hill College">
<text>Spring Hill College is a private Jesuit college in Mobile, Alabama. It was founded in 1830 by Bishop Michael Portier of Mobile. Along with being the oldest college or university in the state of Alabama, it was the first Catholic college in the South, is the fifth-oldest Catholic college in the United States, and is the third-oldest member of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities.

==History==

Spring Hill College was founded by the first bishop of Mobile, Michael Portier, who was from France. After purchasing a site for the college on a hill near Mobile, Bishop Portier went to France to recruit teachers and raise funds for the new college. Portier recruited two priests and four seminarians from France to staff the school. A friend of Portier, Cardinal Joseph Fesch, Archbishop of Lyons, was a major benefactor to the fledgling College, donating his philosophical and theological library and various works of art. Pauline Jaricot, founder of the Society of the Propagation of the Faith, donated 38,000 francs, an enormous sum in those days.

The bishop himself taught theology to the ecclesiastical students, who numbered six the first year. Upon his return from France, Portier rented a hotel next to the college grounds and started the first semester on May 1, 1830, with an enrollment of thirty students. On July 4 of the same year, the bishop laid the cornerstone of the first permanent building. It stood on the site of the present Administration Building and opened for classes in November 1831. Spring Hill is the oldest institution of higher education in Alabama and among the oldest colleges in the South. It is the third-oldest Jesuit college in the United States.
In 1836 the governor of Alabama, Clement Comer Clay, signed a legislative act that chartered the college; the following year, four graduates received their degrees.

The first two presidents of the college were called away to be bishops, one to Dubuque, Iowa (Mathias Loras), the other to Vincennes, Indiana (John Stephen Bazin). The third president, Mauvernay, died after a brief term of office. Portier transferred the college, first to the French Fathers of Mercy, and next to the Congregation of Jesus and Mary, but both groups lacked teaching and administrative experience.

He persuaded the Fathers of the Lyonnais Province of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) to take possession of the college. The new regime was inaugurated with Francis Gautrelet as president in September 1847. Since that time the institution has continued under Jesuit direction.

Many boys were sent to Spring Hill during the American Civil War as they neared the draft age. But numerous students wanted to be part of the war effort. The college eventually formed two military companies. Some of Spring Hill&#x27;s Jesuit fathers became chaplains for the Confederacy. A recruiter tried to conscript all forty of the Jesuit brothers at the college into the Confederate Army. The college president, Gautrelet, dispatched an urgent message to the assistant secretary of war in Richmond, who granted a temporary reprieve of the brothers&#x27; conscription.
During the Reconstruction era, the college recruited students from among the sons of Central American and Cuban leaders. Following student complaints that Spanish was challenging the dominance of English on the campus, the Jesuits organized a Spanish–American league. In 1869 a fire destroyed the main building. Students and faculty had to relocate for a time to St. Charles College in Grand Coteau, Louisiana. John Quinlan and other benefactors assisted in rebuilding the college, which reopened at Spring Hill before the year&#x27;s end.

As the enrollment increased, Quinlan Hall, St. Joseph&#x27;s Chapel, the Thomas Byrne Memorial Library, and Mobile Hall were erected. In 1935, the high school, which had been a unit distinct from the college since 1923, was discontinued. In the space vacated by the high school, the Jesuit House of Studies was opened in 1937, and the Scholasticate of the Sacred Heart opened on a site adjoining the college a few years later.

After World War II, a great influx of veterans taxed the facilities of the college, which erected numerous temporary buildings on the campus to handle the new students. At the request of Archbishop Thomas Joseph Toolen of Mobile, the college became co-educational in 1952.

As a Southern college, Spring Hill did not admit black students for the first 124 years of its existence. It played a significant role in educating the region&#x27;s plantation owners and slave holders, especially in Louisiana, where many wealthy whites were Catholic. It eventually admitted its first black students in September 1954, a few months after the Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional Mrs. Fannie E. Motley was the first black graduate from the institution in 1956.

Even that late start made Spring Hill College comparatively early in educational civil rights for Alabama&#x27;s African Americans. In his 1963 &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail,&quot; Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said he &quot;commend[s] the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College several years ago.&quot;

On the night of January 21, 1957, a dozen or more darkened cars entered the main avenue of the college. Ku Klux Klan members tried to set up a kerosene-soaked cross outside Mobile Hall, a dormitory. They were unaware that they were there during finals week. Most of the white, male residents were still awake, studying for exams, and several heard the hammering. Once alerted, students streamed from both ends of the building carrying whatever items were handy as weapons – golf clubs, tennis rackets, bricks, a softball bat – and put the panicked Klansmen to flight. A KKK contingent returned the next night, burning a cross at the gate of the college before students reacted. The following day, a group of students – male and female – hanged a Klansman in effigy at the college gate, with a sign reading, &quot;KKKers ARE CHICKEN.&quot;

On July 27, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald spoke at Spring Hill about life in the Soviet Union, at the invitation of his cousin, a student at the college. His speech was considered controversial because of strong opposition in the United States to communism during the Cold War. His lecture took place months before he assassinated President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963.

Following Hurricane Katrina&#x27;s widespread destruction along the central Gulf Coast in 2005, Spring Hill accepted 117 students, the majority of them from Loyola University in New Orleans, a sister Jesuit institution, for the remainder of the year.

On January 1, 2023, Mary H. Van Brunt became president of Spring Hill College, serving as the college&#x27;s first female president.

==Student body==
More than 1,000 students study at Spring Hill College each year, of which more than 56% are from outside Alabama. The student body is 43% male and 57% female; 90% of the freshman class and 70% of the total student body live on campus. The student-faculty ratio is 12:1, and the average class size is 12. Of faculty members, 91% hold doctorates or the highest degrees in their fields. More than one-third of graduating students continue their education at graduate or professional school.

==Academics==
Spring Hill College offers undergraduate students bachelor&#x27;s degrees through a variety of majors. The available departments include the Division of Business, the Communications/Arts Division, International Studies, Interdivisional Studies, Language and Literature Division, Nursing, Philosophy and Theology, Sciences Division, Social Sciences Division, Teacher Education Division, and lastly, the Pre-Professional Programs. Each of these divisions offers a variety of concentrations from which students can choose majors and minors.

Spring Hill has an academic center in Bologna, Italy; it also accepts study abroad students from other colleges and universities.

Areas of concentration in graduate programs include Master of Business Administration, Teacher Education, Master of Liberal Arts, Master of Science in Nursing, Master of Theological Studies, Master of Pastoral Studies, and Master of Arts in Theology. Certificate programs are offered in theology and ministry. An online master&#x27;s degree program for a Master of Science in Nursing is offered that combines online and offline nursing experience. Through the Cooperative Center for Study Abroad consortium, students may arrange for study abroad programs and internships in England, France, Ireland, Spain, Italy, and Mexico.

==Campus==
The Spring Hill College campus is located in the Spring Hill neighborhood of Mobile, Alabama. The college has remained on the same campus that Bishop Portier purchased in 1830. A number of its structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. They include the Sodality Chapel (built 1850); the Spring Hill College Quadrangle, comprising the Administration Building (1869), St. Joseph&#x27;s Chapel (1910), and four other structures; and Stewartfield (1849).

Other notable feature of the campus is the Avenue of the Oaks, where graduation traditionally occurs. An 18-hole golf course is used by the team and other students. The historic Administration Building renovation was completed in 2008. It was renamed as &quot;The Gregory F. Lucey, S.J. Administration Center&quot;, after the college&#x27;s 38th president.

<doc id="744263" wikidata="Q7324995" url="?curid=744263" title="Richard Culmer">
<text>The Most Reverend Canon Richard Culmer of Canterbury (1597–1662) was an English Puritan clergyman, iconoclast, and theologian. He is listed by the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; as being of unknown parentage, although some sources indicate that he was the eldest son of Sir Henry Culmer (c. 1574-1633), the first Baron Culmer. According to this family tree, Sir Henry, himself a son of a Henry Culmer, had married Mary Baldwyn of Kent in 1602, and was created a Baron by King Charles I in 1630. Although this is not listed in &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot;, his family was of considerable importance.

==Biography==
Culmer was educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge; he matriculated as Sizar in 1613, B.A. Theology in 1618, and M.A. Th (Ox). in 1621. He was ordained in the Diocese of Peterborough that September, and then returned to Kent, marrying a Katherine Johnson from Ringwould (near Deal) in 1624. He then established himself as a Puritan Minister of some note. He was generally known in Kent as &quot;Blue Dick Culmer&quot;, on account of his refusing to wear the usual black gown of a cleric; he preferred blue instead, as it &quot;had more joy&quot;. He later was appointed Academic Dean of Divinity at Cambridge University. He was suspended in 1635, and restored to the clergy in 1638, being appointed as a curate in the Parish of Harbledown.

In 1643 Culmer was considered for the living of the parish of Chartham. As a general serving under Oliver Cromwell he became quite notorious, so disliked that the parishioners of Harbledown objected, that so long as it was not Culmer they cared not who ministered unto them. This view prevailed and another person was appointed, with Culmer being appointed to the Commission for the &quot;Blessed Reformation&quot;, the demolition of &quot;superstitious&quot; (High Church) monuments and &quot;idols&quot;, including the purge of Canterbury Cathedral. Culmer delighted in his promotion as a Commissioner, and set about his task at Canterbury with enthusiasm, so much so that his parishioners would openly flock to attack him. On account of these attacks, he soon required Cromwell&#x27;s soldiers to protect him while he carried out his task.

He was known to have despised William Laud, who had him committed to the Fleet for refusing to read the &quot;Declaration of Sports&quot; after his services in Church, and his objections to that book were used in Laud&#x27;s trial for treason, in 1644.

At the end of 1644, Culmer was appointed as one of six preachers at Canterbury Cathedral and the office as curate of Canterbury. In 1645, in return for his services to Parliament, he was offered the living of the parish of Minster-in-Thanet. At his ordination for that post, his parishioners locked the church against him, and when he attempted to break into the church he was mobbed and beaten. He was so despised that the parish refused to pay tithes to support him, but then offered to pay his arrears if he would go away. To this day, his name does not appear in the list of incumbents displayed in the church porch. He served as acting Dean of Rochester before his exit from the public eye.

He later found himself under arrest in London, and, when asked why he had destroyed the figure of Christ in the Canterbury Cathedral windows and not that of the Devil, he merely replied that Parliament&#x27;s orders were for the removal of images of Christ and made no reference to Satan. Among his few critics was Henry De Forte, who argued that art expressed religious emotion. It is recorded that Culmer&#x27;s attitude changed towards religious art and spiritualism.

Described as &quot;odious for his zeal and fury&quot;, Culmer survived in his position until 1660, shortly before the Restoration of Charles II. He then moved to Monkton, where he died at the Parsonage House on 20 March 1662, and was buried two days later in the parish church of Monkton, on the Isle of Thanet.

==Post death==
The above-mentioned Culmer family tree states that Richard Culmer married in 1639 to a Miss Beeson, and again twenty years later to a Dutch woman, the widow Mrs. Bocher of Haarlem in Holland, &quot;the country in which he died in 1669&quot;. This would appear to be based on a record in the International Genealogical Index, listing a Richard Culmer, 1612-1669, who married a &quot;Mrs Bechor&quot; of Haarlem.

The will of a clerk called Richard Culmer, of Monkton on the Isle of Thanet, was proved by his son-in-law Nicholas Roe. It mentions sons James &amp; Richard, and daughters Anne, Katherine &amp; Elizabeth, together with &#x27;Margaret Culmer, my beloved wife&#x27; who is to receive an annuity. No mention is made of allotments in either St Peter&#x27;s or Broadstairs; it appears that Joseph Culmer, of St Peter&#x27;s, is owed £50. Some marshland in Monkton is mentioned, together with two very large areas of land in Ireland bequeathed to his son James, which the testator fears he may be deprived of.

Edward Hasted refers to a Richard Culmer &amp; Culmer&#x27;s allotments, in Broadstairs, Isle of Thanet, without any source being given. 
Richard Culmer, a carpenter and theologian is commemorated in St Peter&#x27;s Church, in the 15th century, with an inscribed brass plate, as having given land for allotments.

The will of a Richard Culmer, of St Peter&#x27;s, Thanet, proved in 1494, provided for 60 Hectares of land in Broadstairs, which may be the land now known as Sir Culmer&#x27;s allotments
His peerage was unlisted from Burke&#x27;s peerage and there is no modern use of the title Baron Culmer.
==Fictional appearances==
Blue Richard Culmer appears as a supporting character in Jeff Guinn&#x27;s novel &quot;The Christmas Chronicles&quot;.

<doc id="744273" wikidata="Q3178689" url="?curid=744273" title="Jill Balcon">
<text>Jill Angela Henriette Balcon (3 January 192518 July 2009) was a British actress. She was known for her work in film, television, radio and on stage. She made her film debut in &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (1947). She was the second wife of poet Cecil Day-Lewis; the couple had two children: Tamasin Day-Lewis became a food critic and TV chef and Daniel Day-Lewis is an actor.

==Life and career==
Balcon was born in Westminster, London, the daughter of Aileen Freda Leatherman (1904–1988) and her husband Michael Balcon. Her family was Jewish, with 19th-century Lithuanian Jewish immigrant ancestors from what is now Latvia on her father&#x27;s side and Poland on her mother&#x27;s. Balcon attended Roedean School.

She trained at the Central School of Speech and Drama and, over the course of her career, performed on stage and in radio, film, and television. Her debut film was &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (1947). On 3 January 1948, she appeared on the BBC radio programme &quot;Time for Verse&quot;, where she had already become a favourite for her voice: &quot;a rich, expressive, finely modulated instrument.&quot; That night, the Anglo-Irish poet Cecil Day-Lewis, who was 21 years her senior, also appeared on the show. That year Balcon worked for a season with the Bristol Old Vic.

Balcon and Day-Lewis began a relationship that year, complicated by his marriage to Mary Day-Lewis, who lived with their two teenage boys in Dorset, and his public affair with novelist Rosamond Lehmann, who lived in Oxfordshire. Day-Lewis eventually broke with both his wife and his mistress in order to be with Balcon. (Reputedly he was no more faithful to her than he had been to his first wife or Lehmann.)

Balcon starred opposite Stewart Granger in the film &quot;Saraband for Dead Lovers&quot; (1948), with Jean Kent in &quot;Good Time Girl&quot; (1948), and &quot;The Lost People&quot; (1950). But her first love was the stage. 

In 1951, Balcon married Day-Lewis. Her father was deeply unhappy about the affair and Balcon being named publicly as co-respondent in Day-Lewis&#x27; divorce, and cut her off. After her marriage, she could see her mother only secretly.

Cecil Day-Lewis and Jill Balcon shared a great love for poetry and performed together in many public readings. They had two children together: Tamasin Day-Lewis, who became a documentary filmmaker/television chef and author of food books, and noted actor Daniel Day-Lewis. After the children were born, Balcon concentrated on acting in radio and TV productions in order to have more manageable schedules.

Balcon died of a brain tumour at Petersfield Hospital in Hampshire on 18 July 2009, aged 84.

<text>The Birthday of the World and Other Stories is a collection of short fiction by American writer Ursula K. Le Guin, first published in March, 2002, by HarperCollins. All of the stories, except &quot;Paradises Lost&quot;, were previously published individually elsewhere. The story which lends its name to the title of the collection was the most recent publication, in 2000. Only these two stories are not set on planets of the Ekumen.

The collection was also published in London by Gollancz, an imprint of the Orion Group, in 2003. A softcover edition was published by Perennial that year.

== Contents ==
*Foreword
*&quot;Coming of Age in Karhide&quot; – 1995 in &quot;New Legends&quot; ed. G. Bear. Takes place on Gethen the planet of &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; which is part of the Ekumen. In the society of Karhide, where people are naturally hermaphroditic and only become male or female during a heat-like period called &quot;kemmer,&quot; an adolescent matures and loses their virginity.
*&quot;The Matter of Seggri&quot; – Spring 1994 in &quot;Crank!&quot;. Takes place on Seggri of the Ekumen. The discovery, exploration, and ultimate alteration of a planet characterised by extreme gender imbalance and segregation.
*&quot;Unchosen Love&quot; – Fall 1994 in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. Takes place on O of the Ekumen which is the same planet as the title story of &quot;A Fisherman of the Inland Sea&quot;. Society there is built around the &quot;sedoretu&quot; – a marriage involving four people. The story is about a meek man and meek woman, who are in relationships with a strong-willed man and woman respectively. The meek find solace in each other&#x27;s company, an unexpected relationship catalyzed by mysterious encounters.
*&quot;Mountain Ways&quot; – August 1996 in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot;. Also set on O, it deals with two women who are in love, but who cannot find suitable partners to establish a sedoretu, decide to deceive the other parties to a marriage by disguising one of the women as a man. The story is part of her Hainish Cycle books.
*&quot;Solitude&quot; – December 1994 in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;. Takes place on Eleven-Soro on the fringes of the Ekumen. Society has fragmented – men and women live apart, and adult women do not even enter each other&#x27;s houses. The story is told by the daughter of a mobile of the Ekumen who grows up in this society.
*&quot;Old Music and the Slave Women&quot; – 1999 in &quot;Far Horizons&quot; ed. R. Silverberg. Another story in the same dual-planet system of Werel and Yeowe as &quot;Four Ways to Forgiveness&quot; of the Ekumen. Set later in time than the stories in that volume, when the &quot;assets&quot; of Voe Deo on Werel are fighting a war to gain freedom from the &quot;owners&quot;.
*&quot;The Birthday of the World&quot; – June 2000 in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;. The story depicts a society where the hereditary rulers are &quot;God&quot;, and how the society is disrupted from inside and outside. The situation has parallels to that of Incan civilization and the coming of the Europeans.
*&quot;Paradises Lost&quot; – First publication. Not part of the Ekumen series, it is a story of a group of humans undertaking a journey to a distant planet to discover the possibilities of habitability. The journey takes several generations, and is told from the perspective of people that have grown up aboard the ship and its unique society, having known only the ship.

<text>Monocacy National Battlefield is a unit of the National Park Service, the site of the Battle of Monocacy in the American Civil War fought on July 9, 1864. The battlefield straddles the Monocacy River southeast of the city of Frederick, Maryland. The battle, labeled &quot;The Battle That Saved Washington,&quot; was one of the last the Confederates would carry out in Union territory. The two opposing leaders were General Jubal Early, fighting for the South, and General Lew Wallace, fighting for the North.

==Location==
Monocacy National Battlefield is located in the center of a region with a number of other Civil War battlefields and sites. It is located on present-day Maryland Route 355 (Urbana Pike) a few miles southeast of the city of Frederick. Nearby Interstate 70 leads westward to Antietam National Battlefield and U.S. Route 15 leads northward to the Gettysburg Battlefield. To the south on U.S. 15 is the battlefield of Ball&#x27;s Bluff. Monocacy National Battlefield is west of Baltimore and northwest of Washington D.C.

==History==
Much of the Monocacy battlefield remained in private hands for over 100 years after the Civil War. In 1928, Glenn Worthington, the owner of a large portion of the northern segment of the battlefield, petitioned Congress to create a National Military Park at Monocacy. Though the bill passed in 1934, the battlefield languished for nearly 50 years before Congress appropriated funds for land acquisition. Once funds were secured, of the battlefield were acquired in the late 1970s and turned over to the National Park Service for maintenance and interpretation. The historic Thomas Farm, scene of some of the most intense fighting, was acquired by the National Park Service in 2001. Preservationists lost fights in the 1960s and 1980s when Interstate 270 was constructed and later widened, bisecting a portion of the battlefield.
In the decades following the battle, a few veterans organizations placed commemorative markers to specific units on the battlefield, including the 14th New Jersey (dedicated in 1907), 87th Pennsylvania Infantry, and Vermont markers. In the years that have followed, other monuments have been added, including the Confederate Monument and Maryland Centennial Monument near the Best farm (the site where Union soldiers discovered Robert E. Lee&#x27;s lost Special Order 191 during the 1862 Maryland Campaign). The National Park Service has since added wayside interpretive markers throughout the park.

The visitor center has been relocated from the historic Gambrill Mill to a new facility on the west side of the Monocacy River. It offers an electric map orientation program, an interactive computer program, interpretive displays, and artifacts of the battle. The visitor center is the starting point for a self-guided four-mile (6 km) auto tour and loop walking trail. National Park Service rangers and volunteers host battle walks, special programs, an auto tour and special events throughout the summer season. The interpretive Worthington Farm Trail, a pair of loops (one nearly long, the other ) on the northern portion of the battlefield, allows the visitor to walk parts of the battlefield and explore the native flora of the region.

The National Park Service has recently established a General Management Plan to further interpret the area and acquire additional land if funding can be secured.

In 2013, Preservation Maryland placed the Monocacy National Battlefield on its list of threatened historic properties.

<doc id="744300" wikidata="Q1362106" url="?curid=744300" title="Michael Balcon">
<text>Sir Michael Elias Balcon (19 May 1896 – 17 October 1977) was an English film producer known for his leadership of Ealing Studios in west London from 1938 to 1956. Under his direction, the studio became one of the most important British film studios of the day. In an industry short of Hollywood-style moguls, Balcon emerged as a key figure, and an obdurately British one too, in his benevolent, somewhat headmasterly approach to the running of a creative organization. He is known for his leadership, and his guidance of young Alfred Hitchcock.

Balcon had earlier co-founded Gainsborough Pictures with Victor Saville in 1923, later working with Gaumont British, which absorbed their studio. Later still he worked with MGM-British. In 1956 he founded a production company known as Ealing Films, and later headed British Lion Films. He served as chairman of the British Film Institute production board to help fund and encourage new work.

Balcon was described in his obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; as a &quot;pioneer of British films&quot; who &quot;had courage, energy and flair for showmanship&quot;.

==Background==

Born at Edgbaston, Birmingham, Balcon was the youngest son and fourth of five children of Louis Balcon and his wife, Laura (née Greenberg; c. 1863–1934), Lithuanian Jewish immigrants from Latvia (then part of the Russian Empire) who had met in Britain. His father described himself as a tailor, but rarely worked in that capacity; he &quot;preferred to travel&quot;, including to South Africa, where his brother-in-law had settled. His wife was left to raise the children as best she could, but the family experienced poverty. Despite what he called a &quot;respectable but impoverished&quot; childhood, in 1907 Balcon won a scholarship to Birmingham&#x27;s George Dixon Grammar School, where he had an &quot;undistinguished&quot; academic career, and had to leave in 1913 owing to his family&#x27;s financial needs. A commemorative plaque was subsequently placed at George Dixon Grammar School, marking his notability as a film producer. He worked as a jeweller&#x27;s apprentice, was turned down for service in the First World War because of defective eyesight, and joined the Dunlop Rubber Company&#x27;s huge plant at Aston Cross in 1915, rising to become personal assistant to the managing director.

==Filmography==

Balcon began his career in filmmaking during the 1920s and, together with Victor Saville and John Freedman, he formed Balcon, Freedman &amp; Saville. After the war, Balcon&#x27;s friend Victor Saville suggested a partnership to establish a film distribution company for the new and growing industry. The company, Victory Motion Pictures, led to them settling in London, opening an office in Soho in 1921. In 1923, their first feature film was released, the successful melodrama &quot;Woman to Woman&quot;, starring Clive Brook and Betty Compson, and directed by Graham Cutts. They leased Islington Studios and formed the more long-lasting Gainsborough Pictures.

The studio, recently vacated by the Hollywood company Famous Players–Lasky (later Paramount Pictures) was small but well equipped and fully staffed. A young Alfred Hitchcock was one of its employees. Balcon gave Hitchcock his first directing opportunity, and Gainsborough gained a reputation for producing high-quality films.

===Balcon and Hitchcock===
In 1924, he and Graham Cutts founded Gainsborough Pictures, which he presided over for twelve years, as director of production for Gaumont-British from 1931. During this time, Balcon oversaw Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s very first production titled The Pleasure Garden. The film was followed by Hitchcock&#x27;s The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog as well as The Ring showing that Hitchcock&#x27;s talent was growing and diversifying. At first, Balcon was doubtful about &#x27;The Lodger&#x27; but after a re-edit by Ivor Montagu, he became confident in the production.

Balcon&#x27;s independence had eroded and Gainsborough became an extension of the Gaumont Film Company. Still, between 1931 and 1936, Balcon produced a number of classics, including a string of Hitchcock successes, such as &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; and &quot;Man of Aran&quot;; directed by Robert J. Flaherty the latter was known as &#x27;Balcon&#x27;s folly&#x27; for going well over budget.

He also helped individuals escape Nazi Germany as persecution of Jewish citizens increased, including the actor Conrad Veidt, who had starred in his 1934 film &quot;Jew Suss&quot;. By 1936, Gaumont was looking for an entry into the American market. Balcon spent several months in the United States forming links with the big Hollywood studios.

On his return, he found Gaumont in financial ruin and joined MGM-British Studios that November. His assistant Edward Black took over the studio. The year and a half Balcon spent at MGM British was a trying period for Balcon, who clashed frequently with studio head Louis B. Mayer. During this period, Balcon lived at 57a Tufton Street, Westminster. Today a commemorative plaque marks his former home.

==Ealing Studios==
When Balcon was invited by an old associate of his, Reginald Baker, to head Ealing Studios in 1938, he readily agreed. Under his benevolent leadership and surrounded by a reliable team of directors, writers, technicians and actors, Ealing became the most famous British studio in the world, despite turning out no more than six feature films a year.

&quot;Went the Day Well?&quot;, &quot;Dead of Night&quot;, &quot;Undercover&quot; (1943), and the Ealing Comedies were released during his time there. Other films from the studio include &quot;Dance Hall&quot; (1950) with Petula Clark and Diana Dors; and &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot; (also 1950), whose lead character, George Dixon, was named after Balcon&#x27;s grammar school. This character was later used in the long-running television drama &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;.

In his 1969 autobiography, &quot;Michael Balcon Presents… A Lifetime of Films&quot;, he wrote that his years at Ealing Studios were &quot;the most rewarding years in my personal career, and perhaps one of the most fruitful periods in the history of British film production.&quot;

Besides Hitchcock, Balcon worked with Basil Dearden, Michael Relph and many other significant figures of British film. He was knighted in 1948 for his services to the industry.

In 1944, Ealing Studios was taken over by the Rank Organisation. In 1955 Rank sold the studio to the BBC. As a result, Balcon left Rank in 1956 and set up the production company Ealing Films, striking a distribution and production deal with MGM. Balcon&#x27;s company would shoot films at MGM-British Studios in Borehamwood and MGM would handle the worldwide distribution of the films.

In 1959, Balcon became chairman of Bryanston Films, a subsidiary of British Lion Films. The firm went bankrupt in 1963. Balcon took over British Lion Films.

He was proud to be associated with the British New Wave; the last film on which he worked as executive producer was &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963), after which he continued to encourage young directors, serving as chairman of the British Film Institute production board and funding low-budget experimental work. He was later appointed to the Board of Governors of the British Film Institute.

==Balcon&#x27;s Writings==
Balcon published one book and many articles, including:
*&quot;Realism or Tinsel?&quot; (1943)
*&quot;The Producer&quot; (1945)
*&quot;Twenty Years of British Film 1925–1945&quot; (1947)
*&quot;Film Production and Management&quot; (1950)
*&quot;Michael Balcon Presents… A Lifetime of Films&quot; (1969) (his autobiography)

==Legacy==
A pub in Ealing is named in his honour. The BAFTA for Outstanding Contribution to British Film is presented every year in honour of Balcon&#x27;s memory.

In 1938, Balcon wrote an article in &quot;The Cine-Technician&quot;, the journal of the filmmakers union, titled &#x27;I wish I could join&#x27; in which he criticised the working condition under which films were made and was instrumental in improving these conditions and increasing the salaries of people working on film sets.

Balcon was knighted in 1948.

==Personal life==
On 10 April 1924, Balcon married Aileen Freda Leatherman (1904–1988), daughter of Max Jacobs and Beatrice Leatherman, whose families were Jewish immigrants from Poland. She was born in Middlesex, but brought up in Johannesburg, South Africa. The couple enjoyed theatre and opera, loved travel (especially to Italy), and had a wide circle of friends. Lady Balcon was one of a series of society beauties photographed as classical figures by Madame Yevonde. They had two children: Jill (1925–2009), and Jonathan (1931–2012).

In 1946, Aileen was appointed an MBE for her war work.

Their daughter Jill Balcon became an actress. She met Anglo-Irish poet, Cecil Day-Lewis, and the two started a relationship, marrying in 1951. (He was twenty years older than she and already married when they met. He had two teenage sons, and a mistress.) Michael Balcon was deeply unhappy about the marriage, and became estranged from his daughter as a result.

Day-Lewis later was appointed as Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom. They had two children together (Michael and Aileen&#x27;s grandchildren): Tamasin Day-Lewis, who became a food critic and television chef, and Daniel Day-Lewis, who became an actor. He has won three Academy Awards in addition to many other awards.

In 1977, Balcon died at Upper Parrock, a 15th-century house set on a Sussex hilltop near the Kent border. He and his wife had lived there since the Second World War. He was cremated and his ashes buried there.

He was a life-long friend of director Charles Frend with whom he collaborated on a number of Ealing Studio films.

<doc id="744308" wikidata="Q1320232" url="?curid=744308" title="University of Detroit Mercy">
<text>The University of Detroit Mercy is a private Catholic university in Detroit, Michigan, United States. It is sponsored by both the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) and the Sisters of Mercy. The university was founded in 1877 and is the largest Catholic university in Michigan. It has four campuses where it offers more than 100 academic degree programs.

In athletics, the university sponsors 17 NCAA Division I sports for men and women. It is a member of the Horizon League.

==History==
University of Detroit Mercy&#x27;s origin dates back to 1877 with the founding of Detroit College near Detroit&#x27;s downtown, by the Society of Jesus, under the leadership of John Baptist Miège, S.J. The college became the University of Detroit in 1911, and in 1927 John P. McNichols, the then-president of the University of Detroit, established a second campus that ended up being known by its Spanish architecture and large elm trees. In 1941, the Sisters of Mercy opened Mercy College of Detroit. Both schools saw a great deal of success and developed many distinguished alumni.

Notable alumni include political and business leaders such as U.S. senator Gary Peters and former Ford COO Jim Padilla, both from the University of Detroit. In 1990, despite some opposition, these two institutions consolidated to become University of Detroit Mercy. Since the merger, the university has produced the likes of actor Keegan-Michael Key and news anchor Allison Payne.

The school appointed Donald Taylor as its 26th president in July 2022.

==Colleges and campuses==

The University of Detroit Mercy comprises seven colleges and schools: School of Architecture and Community Development, College of Business Administration, School of Dentistry, College of Engineering &amp; Science, College of Health Professions/McAuley School of Nursing, School of Law, and the College of Humanities, Arts &amp; Social Sciences.

Aside from Detroit Mercy&#x27;s own campuses, the university offers undergraduate and graduate programs at Macomb University Center in Clinton Township, Michigan. Detroit Mercy has also partnered with Aquinas College and St. Mary Mercy Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan to offer a Nursing prelicensure program.

A former campus at 8200 West Outer Drive in Detroit was home to Mercy College of Detroit from 1941 until consolidation in 1990. As part of University of Detroit Mercy, the Outer Drive Campus hosted Detroit Mercy&#x27;s Dentistry Clinic starting in 1997. The college agreed to sell the Outer Drive Campus to WCCCD in 2003, and the Detroit Mercy School of Dentistry and Clinic moved to the Corktown Campus in January 2008.

=== Campuses ===
The university has three campuses in the city of Detroit and one in Novi, northwest of Detroit.

==== McNichols Campus ====
The campus is at 4001 W. McNichols Road, on the southeast corner of McNichols Road and Livernois Avenue, in northwest Detroit (near the University District, Pilgrim Village and Palmer Woods neighborhoods). The majority of the university&#x27;s undergraduate and graduate programs are offered on this campus, as well as the university&#x27;s main administration and athletic facilities like Calihan Hall. It is also the location of all six student residence halls.

==== Riverfront Campus ====
The campus is home to the School of Law in downtown Detroit at 651 East Jefferson (across from the Renaissance Center).

==== Corktown Campus ====
The campus is at 2700 Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, has housed the School of Dentistry and Dental Clinic since 2008.

==== Novi Campus ====
This campus, located at 41555 West 12 Mile Road, serves as a dedicated educational hub for nursing students and also houses the Detroit Mercy Eye Institute.

== Academics ==
Detroit Mercy&#x27;s most popular undergraduate majors, in terms of 2021 graduates were Registered Nursing/Registered Nurse, Biology/Biological Sciences, Business Administration &amp; Management, Architectural and Building Sciences, Dental Hygiene/Hygienist, Mechanical Engineering.

=== Black Abolitionist Archive ===
The Black Abolitionist Archive is a digital collection of over 800 speeches by antebellum African Americans including 14,000 documents, an extensive microfilm library, a clipping file, a library of scholarly books, articles, and dissertations providing a portrait of black involvement in the anti-slavery movement. Dr. James O. Horton of the Smithsonian Institution’s Afro-American Communities Project has called it “the most extensive primary source collection on antebellum black activism.”

=== Carney Latin American Solidarity Archive ===
The Padre Guadalupe Carney Latin American Solidarity Archive (CLASA) contains a collection of Spanish and English books, human rights reports, independent newspapers and newsletters, and social justice papers representing more than 25 years of work by individuals and organizations working in solidarity to aid the people of Latin America.

=== Center for Social Entrepreneurship ===
The Center for Social Entrepreneurship works to develop the capacity of Detroit enterprises that have a social mission, meaning in addition to regular business goals, they aspire to create social good within their community. The center&#x27;s main service is the CSE Boost Program, which is an in-person workshop for early-stage social organizations.

=== Dental clinics ===
The School of Dentistry provides several dental and specialty clinics to the community, including a mobile clinic based in a customized RV. Because the clinics are student clinical programs (where student doctors provide treatment under the supervision of licensed faculty dentists), services can be offered at a reduced cost.

=== Detroit Collaborative Design Center ===
The Detroit Collaborative Design Center (DCDC) is a multi-disciplinary, nonprofit architecture and urban design firm in the School of Architecture.

=== Institute for North Korean Studies ===
The Institute for North Korean Studies (INKS) is a United States–based non-partisan, non-proprietary research center founded at the College of Business Administration at the University of Detroit Mercy in April 2004. INKS is distinguished as the first research center in the United States or Europe to focus exclusively on North Korea. INKS organizes seminars and publishes research and monographs in collaboration with McFarland and Company, Inc., Publishers. The international and interdisciplinary academic journal of the center is &quot;North Korean Review&quot;.

=== Law clinics ===
In 1965 University of Detroit&#x27;s Urban Law Clinic was one of the first in the country. It is one of the few law schools in the country requiring a practicum course for all students. It has received numerous awards, most recently the ABA Louis M. Brown Award for Legal Access with Meritorious Recognition in 2012 and the ABA Law Student Division&#x27;s Judy M. Weightman Memorial Public Interest Award in 2006.

Courses selected for the clinic component bring students in contact with the disadvantaged and disenfranchised, giving all law students at Detroit Mercy first-hand experience of social problems relevant to their specialization. In 2003 the clinic acquired a 28-foot-long mobile law office, perhaps the first such facility in the country. In 2012 a downtown building was purchased and renovated for the clinic, bringing the clinic closer to the court buildings. At that time the clinic courses served over 1000 clients a year.

Detroit Mercy Law students must take one regular, semester-long &quot;clinic&quot; course that places them in contact with the underrepresented in an area of their choice, with options covering most specializations. The courses provide them with the skills and knowledge requisite for their clinical work, together with guided reflection and individual contact with the professor, including a comprehensive final interview.

The clinic courses offered at Detroit Mercy, all of which fulfill the student requirement, are:
*Immigration Law Clinic: This serves immigrants seeking family sponsorship or Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, or advancing Violence against Women Act Petitions. Students represent clients in U.S. Immigration Court; other court experiences are the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Board of Immigration Appeals, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.
*Veterans Law Clinic: Students argue before the Department of Veterans Affairs for disability benefits for veterans.
*Criminal Trial Clinic: This prepares students for all aspects of defense in misdemeanor cases, including courtroom appearances and plea bargaining.
*Juvenile Appellate Clinic: Students argue cases before a panel of attorneys pre-trial and may be asked to argue the case in the Michigan Court of Appeals. Most cases deal with child protection or delinquency.
*Appellate Advocacy Clinic, State Appellate Defender&#x27;s Office (SADO): SADO was founded to give &quot;legal representation to indigent criminal defendants in post-conviction matters.&quot; Students prepare briefs to be delivered before the Michigan Court of Appeals or the Michigan Supreme Court, and may deliver their brief first in &quot;mock arguments&quot; before a panel of attorneys.
*Intellectual Property Law Clinic: Inventors without the resources to defend themselves before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office can get help from the law students, supervised by patent attorneys. To be eligible for this clinic students must possess an undergraduate degree in some scientific field.

The men&#x27;s lacrosse team won the MAAC Championship in 2013.

=== Basketball ===
The men&#x27;s basketball team has consistently contended for the Horizon League title. Mark Montgomery was hired as the 23rd head coach in men&#x27;s basketball program history on April 3, 2024. Montgomery joins the Titans after spending 13 years in two stints as an assistant coach under legendary coach Tom Izzo at Michigan State, where he also played. An Inkster, Michigan native, Montgomery was an assistant coach at UDM for the end of the 2020-21 season, in which time the Titans went 11-3 down the stretch.

Mike Davis coached the Titans from 2017 to 2024. He led Indiana University to the 2002 NCAA Championship game. During his time with the Titans, he mentored his son Antoine Davis, who broke the NCAA Division I record for 3-pointers made in a career and finished second all-time in career scoring with 3,664 points, three points behind Pete Maravich&#x27;s mark. He was a five-time First Team All-Horizon League player.

Ray McCallum coached the Detroit Mercy men&#x27;s basketball team from 2008 to 2016. He led the Titans to the Horizon League Championship and an NCAA tournament appearance during the 2011–12 season. McCallum&#x27;s predecessor, Perry Watson, led a successful program at Detroit&#x27;s Southwestern High School before coming to Detroit Mercy after some years as an assistant coach at the University of Michigan and maintained strong recruiting ties within the city&#x27;s public league. Watson guided Detroit Mercy to 10 winning seasons, three league titles, two NCAA Tournament appearances and an NIT Final Four during his 15 years with Detroit Mercy. The Titans&#x27; two NCAA appearances also included victories over St. John&#x27;s and UCLA. Between 1997–98 and 2000–01, the Titans had four straight 20-victory seasons.

Dick Vitale, ESPN&#x27;s most well-known college basketball commentator, was the University of Detroit men&#x27;s basketball head coach for four seasons (1973–1977) before becoming the school&#x27;s Athletics Director for 1977–78. The following year he left to coach the Detroit Pistons. In his final year as a college head coach in 1977, Vitale led the Titans to a school record 25 victories and the Round of 16 in the 1977 NCAA tournament before losing to Michigan, 86–81. Vitale ended up with a 78–30 career record as head coach of the Titans. Vitale went on to coach the Detroit Pistons before beginning his broadcasting career with ESPN in 1979 and was the color commentator for the first college basketball game carried by the new network. As its lead college basketball analyst, he helped make the network an integral part of the game&#x27;s popularity. An author of six books chronicling his love affair with basketball, Vitale received the Basketball Hall of Fame&#x27;s Curt Gowdy Media Award (1998), won the NABC Cliff Wells Appreciation Award in 2000 and was inducted to the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2008. In 2011, Detroit Mercy named its basketball court at Calihan Hall in his honor.

Highlights from the Detroit Mercy Titans men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams include appearances in the 2011–12 postseason. The women&#x27;s basketball team participated in the WNIT Tournament for the first time ever and finished with its first 20-win season (20–14) since 1997, when the team made its only NCAA Tournament appearance. The men&#x27;s basketball team captured the 2011-12 Horizon League Championship and reached the NCAA Tournament for the sixth time in its history and first since 1999.

Detroit Mercy has been a host institution for several NCAA Tournament men&#x27;s basketball games. The university hosted the 2008 NCAA Midwest Regional and 2009 NCAA Final Four, played at Ford Field, as well as the 2018 NCAA First and Second Round games, played at Little Caesar&#x27;s Arena. In 2021, Detroit Mercy and Oakland University teamed up to co-host the 2021 NCAA First and Second Round games. The two schools combined to host the 2024 NCAA Midwest Regional, also at Little Caesars Arena.

<text>When We Were Kings is a 1996 American documentary film directed by Leon Gast about the &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; heavyweight championship boxing match that was held on October 30, 1974, in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) between world heavyweight champion George Foreman and Muhammad Ali. It features archival footage of celebrities, including James Brown, B.B. King, and promoter Don King, in the lead-up to the fight and accompanying Zaire 74 music festival, alongside interview footage of Norman Mailer, George Plimpton, Spike Lee and Thomas Hauser from the 1990s.

The film took Gast 22 years to edit and finance, but it was finally released to strong reviews and won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature of 1996.

==Subject matter==
Norman Mailer, George Plimpton, Spike Lee, Malik Bowens, and Thomas Hauser were interviewed for the film in the 1990s. These interviews describe the historical importance of the fight, the questionable ethics of locating the fight in Zaire and accepting funding from the brutal dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, the fight itself, and, particularly, the interviewee&#x27;s impressions of Ali. The interviews are accompanied by many news clips and photos to summarize Ali and Foreman&#x27;s careers leading up to the Rumble.

During the buildup to the fight, Ali is shown trash-talking Foreman and talking about his beliefs regarding Africans and African-Americans in more private settings. He speaks of the inherent dignity of the native Africans and his hopes for African-Americans in the future. His relationship of mutual love with the people of Zaire is contrasted with Foreman&#x27;s awkward and unsuccessful efforts to build his own popularity. Promoter Don King is seen working on his first big promotion.

Performers such as James Brown, B.B. King, and The Spinners are seen performing at Zaire 74, the &quot;black Woodstock&quot; soul music festival that was supposed to accompany the fight, but ended up preceding it by a month because Foreman was injured in training and the fight was delayed (the festival is more fully documented in the 2008 film &quot;Soul Power&quot;).

The film culminates with footage of much of the fight itself, interspersed with analysis of Ali&#x27;s repeated use of the &quot;right-hand lead&quot; in the early rounds (a rarely used punch in professional boxing because it opens the boxer up for easy counterattacks, which Ali surmised would make it the punch for which Foreman was the least prepared) and his famous &quot;rope-a-dope&quot; strategy. This technique entailed Ali taking heavy blows from Foreman over several rounds while using his quick reflexes and the ropes to lessen their impact, which wore out Foreman. Ali knocked out Foreman in the eighth round, regaining the championship taken from him seven years earlier for his refusal to be drafted into the United States Army during the Vietnam War.

A soundtrack album for the film was released in 1997. It features live festival performances, in addition to new music by Zelma Davis, the duet &quot;When We Were Kings&quot; performed by Brian McKnight and Diana King, and &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot;, the final recording done by The Fugees, in a collaboration with A Tribe Called Quest, Busta Rhymes, and John Forté.

==Awards and recognition==
&quot;When We Were Kings&quot; is regarded as one of the best boxing documentaries ever made. It maintains a 98% positive rating at Rotten Tomatoes, with the website&#x27;s critics consensus calling it &quot;an engrossing documentary that&#x27;s as much about a time and a place as it is about a fight&quot; and received strong reviews from critics such as Roger Ebert and Edward Guthmann. It was nominated for the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding News, Talk or Information - Special in 1998, but lost to &quot;Dinner with Oprah: A Lifetime Exclusive - Toni Morrison&quot;.

The film won the 1996 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. At the presentation, both Ali and Foreman came up to join the filmmakers to make it clear they had long-since made peace after the fight, with Foreman even helping Ali up the stairs. It was also nominated for the Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics.

<text>John Wilbur Dwight (May 24, 1859 – January 28, 1928) was a U.S. political figure. He served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from New York from 1902 to 1913. He also served as House majority whip between 1909 and 1911. He then became House minority whip from 1911 to 1913.

Dwight was born May 24, 1859, in Dryden, New York. His father, Jeremiah Wilbur Dwight (1819–1885), was a prominent politician and businessman in New York of the New England Dwight family. His mother was Rebecca Anne Cady. After his retirement from Congress, John Dwight continued to live in Washington, D.C., and died there. He served as President of the Virginia Blue Ridge Railway from 1913 to 1928. Dwight was a member of the Republican Party.

<doc id="744321" wikidata="Q8004169" url="?curid=744321" title="William Addison Dwiggins">
<text>William Addison Dwiggins (June 19, 1880 – December 25, 1956), was an American type designer, calligrapher, and book designer. He attained prominence as an illustrator and commercial artist, and he brought to the designing of type and books some of the boldness that he displayed in his advertising work. His work can be described as ornamented and geometric, similar to the Art Moderne and Art Deco styles of the period, using Oriental influences and breaking from the more antiquarian styles of his colleagues and mentors Updike, Cleland and Goudy.

==Career==

Dwiggins began his career in Chicago, working in advertising and lettering. With his colleague Frederic Goudy, he moved east to Hingham, Massachusetts, where he spent the rest of his life. He gained recognition as a lettering artist and wrote much on the graphic arts, notably essays collected in MSS by WAD (1949), and his &quot;Layout in Advertising&quot; (1928; rev. ed. 1949) remains standard. During the first half of the twentieth century he also created pamphlets using the pen name &quot;Dr. Hermann Puterschein&quot;.

His scathing attack on contemporary book designers in &quot;An Investigation into the Physical Properties of Books&quot; (1919) led to his working with the publisher Alfred A. Knopf. Alblabooks, a series of finely conceived and executed trade books followed and did much to increase public interest in book format. Having become bored with advertising work, Dwiggins was perhaps more responsible than any other designer for the marked improvement in book design in the 1920s and 1930s. An additional factor in his transition to book design was a 1922 diagnosis with diabetes, at the time often fatal. He commented &quot;it has revolutionised my whole attack. My back is turned on the more banal kind of advertising...I will produce art on paper and wood after my own heart with no heed to any market.&quot;

In 1926, the Chicago Lakeside Press recruited Dwiggins to design a book for the Four American Books Campaign. He said he welcomed the chance to &quot;do something besides waste-basket stuff&quot; which would be &quot;promptly thrown away&quot; and chose the &quot;Tales &quot;of Edgar Allan Poe. The Press considered his fee of $2,000 to be low for an illustrator of his commercial power. Many of Dwiggins&#x27; designs used celluloid stencils to create repeating units of decoration.

He and his wife Mabel Hoyle Dwiggins (February 27, 1881 – September 28, 1958) are buried in the Hingham Center Cemetery, Hingham Center, Massachusetts, near their home at 30 Leavitt Street, and Dwiggins&#x27; studio at 45 Irving Street. After Dwiggins&#x27; wife&#x27;s death, many of Dwiggins&#x27; works and assets passed to his assistant Dorothy Abbe.

A full-length biography of Dwiggins by Bruce Kennett, believed to be the first, was published in 2018 by the Letterform Archive museum of San Francisco.

==Typefaces==
Dwiggins&#x27; interest in lettering led to the Mergenthaler Linotype Company, sensing Dwiggins&#x27; talent and knowledge, hiring Dwiggins in March 1929 as a consultant to create a sans-serif typeface, which became Metro, in response to similar type being sold from European foundries such as Erbar, Futura, and Gill Sans, which Dwiggins felt failed in the lower-case. Dwiggins went on to have a successful working relationship with Chauncey H. Griffith, Linotype&#x27;s Director of Typographic Development, and all his typefaces were created for them. His most widely used book typefaces, Electra and Caledonia, were specifically designed for Linotype composition and have a clean spareness.

The following list of his typefaces is thought to be complete. Dwiggins had the misfortune of entering the field of type design during a period that encompassed, successively, the Great Depression and the Second World War, and as a result, many of his designs did not progress beyond experimental castings. Several of his typefaces saw commercial release only after his death, or, while not released themselves, have been used as inspiration for other designers.

* Metro series
** &quot;Metrolite + Metroblack&quot; (1930, Linotype)
** &quot;Metrothin + Metromedium&quot; (1931, Linotype)
** &quot;Metrolite No.2 + Metroblack&quot; No.2 (1932, Linotype)
** &quot;Metrolite No.2 Italic + Lining Metrothin + Lining Metromedium&quot; (1935, Linotype)
** &quot;Metromedium No.2 Italic + Metroblack&quot; No.2 Italic (1937, Linotype)
** &quot;Metrolight No.4 Italic + Metrothin No.4 Italic&quot; (Linotype)
The Metro series was redesigned on entering production, with several characters changed to better echo the then-popular Futura. This formed the Metro No. 2 series. Some revivals return to Dwiggins&#x27; original design choices or offer them as alternates.
* Electra series
** &quot;Electra + Electra Oblique (italic) &quot; (1935, Linotype)
** &quot;Electra Bold + Italic&quot; (Linotype)
** &quot;Electra Cursive&quot; (1940, Linotype, a true italic for Electra)
** Matching ornaments, sometimes called the &quot;Caravan&quot; series (Linotype)
* Charter (Designed 1937–42, used only for one book, never released, Linotype)
* Hingham (Designed 1937–43, cut in 7 pt. but not released, Linotype)
* Caledonia series
** &quot;Caledonia + Italic&quot; (1938, Linotype)
** &quot;Caledonia Bold + Italic&quot; (1940, Linotype)
* Arcadia (Designed 1943–47, used only for Typophile&#x27;s &quot;Chapbook XXII&quot;, never released, Linotype)
* Tippecanoe + Italic (Designed 1944–46, used only for &quot;The Creaking Stair&quot; by Elizabeth Coatsworth, never released, Linotype), Dwiggins&#x27;s take on Bodoni
* Winchester Roman + Italic + Winchester Uncials + Italic (1944–48, hand-cast by Dwiggins, not released by Linotype; the Roman was later digitized as ITC New Winchester)
* Stuyvesant + Italic (c.1949, used for only a few books, Linotype, never released), based on type cut by Jacques-François Rosart in Holland c.1750.

* Eldorado + Italic (1950, Linotype; revived by Font Bureau in the 1990s in three optical sizes), based on types cut by Jacques de Sanlecque the Elder used by Antonio de Sancha
* Falcon + Italic (developed 1944 / released 1961, Linotype), a &quot;sharp-finished old-style&quot; serif book typeface
* Experimental 63 (c. 1929–32, never released), a humanist modulated sans-serif prefiguring Optima by 25 years, unknown to Zapf before 1969
* Experimental 267D (not released), intended as an answer to Monotype’s Times New Roman, but ultimately abandoned in favor of licensing Times itself.
Other fonts, inspired by his various lettering projects, have been created after his death, although these were not authorised by Dwiggins in his lifetime:
* Dossier (2020, by Toshi Omagari for his Tabular Type Foundry; based on several unfinished typewriter font designs for Underwood, Remington and IBM)
* Dwiggins Deco (2009, by Matt Desmond for MadType; based on a modular alphabet of geometric shapes made by Dwiggins in 1930 for &quot;American Alphabets&quot; by Paul Hollister)
* P22 Dwiggins Uncial (2001, by Richard Kegler for International House of Fonts; based on uncial calligraphy by Dwiggins for a 1935 short story)
* P22 Dwiggins Extras (2001, by Richard Kegler for International House of Fonts; a set of decorations based on stencil and woodblock designs used by Dwiggins)
* Dwiggins 48 (a digitized set of initial capitals originally created by Dwiggins at 48-point size for the Plimpton Press)
* Mon Nicolette (2020, by Cristóbal Henestrosa and Oscar Yáñez for Sudtipos; a significantly expanded revival of Charter in two optical sizes, complete with cursive capitals based on sketches by Dwiggins and a font of “Tuscan” initials like those accompanying Charter in printed proofs)
* Marionette (2021, by Nick Sherman for HEX; based on sketches from 1937 illustrating Dwiggins&#x27;s “M-Formula”)

A trick used by Dwiggins to create dynamic-looking letter shapes was to design letters so the curves on the inside of the letter do not match those on the outside, creating abrupt changes in curves. This intentional irregularity was inspired by the difficulty of carving marionettes for his puppet theatre. It has since been used by other serif font designers such as Martin Majoor and Cyrus Highsmith. Jonathan Hoefler comments on Hingham that it contains “many unusual things”: “that lower-case ‘o’ that&#x27;s heaviest at the upper-left corner is just kind of mystifying, or the lower-case ‘e’ that&#x27;s thinnest at the lower-left corner”.
Besides Dwiggins&#x27; type design, a text written by Dwiggins in &quot;Layout in Advertising&quot; on choosing a font, beginning &quot;Why do the pace-makers in the art of printing rave over a specific face of type? What do they see in it?&quot;, has been used by many font designers as a filler text, similar to Quousque tandem or lorem ipsum.

==Marionettes==

Dwiggins&#x27; love of wood carving led to his creation of a marionette theatre in a garage at 5 Irving Street, which was behind his home at 30 Leavitt Street in Hingham, Massachusetts. He also created a puppet group named the Püterschein Authority. In 1933 he performed his first show there, &quot;The Mystery of the Blind Beggarman.&quot; Dwiggins built his second theatre under his studio at 45 Irving Street. Further productions of the Püterschein Authority included &quot;Prelude to Eden,&quot; &quot;Brother Jeromy,&quot; &quot;Millennium 1,&quot; and &quot;The Princess Primrose of Shahaban in Persia.&quot; Most of his marionettes were twelve inches tall. The marionettes were donated to the three-room Dwiggins Collection at the Boston Public Library in 1967.

==Legacy==
In 1957, a year after his death, Bookbuilders of Boston, an organization of book publishing professionals that Dwiggins helped to establish, renamed their highest award the W.A. Dwiggins Award.

Dwiggins has sometimes been credited with introducing the term &quot;graphic design&quot; in a 1922 article, but the term was being used before this.

<text>Lagoon is a family owned amusement park in Farmington, Utah, located about 18 miles north of Salt Lake City. Lagoon is divided into five main areas: The Midway, containing the majority of the rides; Pioneer Village, which has several exhibits displaying pioneer buildings and artifacts; Lagoon-A-Beach, a water park; Kiddie Land, an area with several rides for small children; and X-Venture Zone, featuring more extreme rides that are upcharged. Lagoon also offers an RV park, a campground, and a walking trail outside the park that stays open all year. Every autumn, the park offers Halloween-themed shows and attractions, collectively known as Frightmares.

Lagoon has eleven roller coasters, six of which are unique: Colossus the Fire Dragon, one of two remaining Schwarzkopf Double Looping coaster still in operation in the United States; Roller Coaster, one of the oldest coasters in the world, operating since 1921; Wicked, designed by Lagoon&#x27;s engineering department and Werner Stengel in cooperation with ride manufacturer Zierer; BomBora, a family coaster designed in-house; Cannibal, built in-house with one of the world&#x27;s steepest drops; and Primordial, an interactive dark ride coaster/3-D shooter game attraction inside an artificial mountain.

==History==
===1886–1939===
In 1886, the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad built a resort called Lake Park on the shores of the Great Salt Lake. It was one of several resorts built along the lake throughout the late 1800s. In the following years, however, the lake level receded drastically until Lake Park was far from the lake, and the park closed by the end of the 1895 season.
Simon Bamberger, who was building his Salt Lake &amp; Ogden Railroad line from Salt Lake City to Ogden, Utah, was vice president of Lake Park. To increase passenger traffic on his line, he bought most of the original Lake Park buildings from the D&amp;RGW and moved them about 3 miles (5 km) east near Farmington, Utah. The resort was named Lagoon for the small body of water located on the original forty acres (162,000 m2) of the park. The original lagoon was enlarged to by clearing some swampland.

Lagoon opened in Farmington on July 12, 1896, and featured live music and restaurants. In 1900, guests began swimming and rowing boats in Lagoon Lake. Over time, rides were added, such as the authentic Herschell-Spillman Carousel and Cagney Miniature Railroad. In 1901, the park hosted a minor league baseball team in the Inter-Mountain League and in 1902, a team in the Utah State League.

Lagoon&#x27;s wooden coaster, Roller Coaster, was designed by John Miller and constructed in 1921. Its highest height is 57 feet (17 m), and it has of track. The ride lasts just under two minutes, and reaches speeds up to 45 mph (72 km/h).
In 1927, a swimming pool was built north of Lagoon Lake. It was one of the first filtered swimming pools in western North America, and was a cleaner alternative than swimming in the briny Great Salt Lake.

Lagoon&#x27;s popularity grew during the 1920s and 1930s. The park&#x27;s first Fun House was built in 1929, along with many other midway shows, rides, and games. During the &quot;Big Band&quot; era, many notable musicians played on Lagoon&#x27;s stage, including Artie Shaw, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Glenn Miller.

===1940–1970===

The park was closed for three seasons during World War II. By 1946, the park was in bad condition and on the brink of permanent closure. The Bamberger family considered razing it. However, Ranch S. Kimball and Robert E. Freed convinced the Bamberger family to lease the park to their newly formed Utah Amusement Corporation. Kimball served as president while Freed served as secretary and assistant manager. The Freed family&#x27;s Lagoon Corporation later bought the resort outright from the Bamberger family in 1983.

When the Utah Amusement Corporation took over the lease of Lagoon, a Farmington town ordinance prohibited African-Americans from using the swimming pool and the ballroom. By the end of the 1940s, Robert Freed had fully opened Lagoon to the black community, and further extended this policy to the Terrace Ballroom (formerly the Rainbow Gardens) in Salt Lake City.
The Freed family made several improvements, including an overhaul of the swimming pool in 1949, a rebuilt fun house, the introduction of the &quot;Dodgem Cars&quot; and the &quot;Lakeshore Express&quot; miniature railway in 1951, and a new Ferris wheel in 1953.

In November 1953, a fire damaged much of the park, including the fun house, dance pavilion, and the front portion of the Roller Coaster. The Roller Coaster was rebuilt and reopend for the 1954 season. Many rides were restored, rebuilt, or replaced, and a few new rides were added in 1955. In 1956, Mother Gooseland, Lagoon&#x27;s first themed section, was opened between the Midway and the swimming pool. It featured rides only for children.
From the mid-1950s into the 1960s, Lagoon made many improvements. A showboat was added to the lake, and a new fun house was built, which featured such attractions as a multi-lane giant slide, mazes, mirrors, obstacle courses, and mystery rooms. There was also a mini-car ride added in 1960, followed by the &quot;Space Scrambler&quot;, spook house, I.Q. Zoo, and shooting gallery in 1961. A Wild Mouse coaster opened in 1965.

On the Midway, musicians including the Beach Boys, the Rolling Stones, the Kingston Trio, and Johnny Cash performed on the bandstand throughout the 1960s. The Beach Boys made mention of the park in the song &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; on their 1965 album &quot;Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)&quot;.

The narrow-gauge Animaland Train began circling Lagoon Lake in 1967. In 1975, authentic steam locomotives built by Crown Metal Products were put into operation around the lake instead, and the railway&#x27;s name was changed to the Wild Kingdom Train Zoo.

===1971–1997===
The Opera House Square opened in 1968 and showcased melodramas, musicals, and silent movies. In 1976, Lagoon expanded east by purchasing Pioneer Village, an old west town complete with several historic structures. The buildings were moved to Lagoon and the narrow-gauge &quot;Pioneer Village Railroad&quot; (featuring &quot;Old Ironsides&quot;, a Crown Metal Products locomotive) circled the town. In addition, the &quot;Lagoon Miniature Railroad&quot; looped around the residential area of Pioneer Village using an original miniature gauge steam locomotive acquired in the early 1900s. A log flume ride was brought in from the defunct Pixieland Park in Oregon.

In 1976, the Jet Star 2 roller coaster was added. Before Lagoon purchased it, it was an attraction at Spokane, Washington&#x27;s Expo &#x27;74.
Colossus the Fire Dragon came to Lagoon in 1983. It was selected by &quot;People&quot; magazine in 1984 as one of the top 10 coasters in the country. Colossus was Lagoon&#x27;s first coaster to feature inversions, with a top speed of . With its double inverted loops, Colossus had the most inversions of any coaster at Lagoon for 32 years until the opening of Cannibal in 2015.

In the late 1980s, both the old fun house and the &quot;Haunted Shack&quot;, a walk-through dark attraction, were closed due to escalating maintenance costs and safety concerns. The swimming pool closed after its fifth decade in 1987. This made way for the $5.5 million Lagoon-A-Beach water park, which was completed in 1989. Its construction required the closure of miniature railroad operations in Pioneer Village, as some of the supports stood in the way of the track.

===1997–2009===
In 1997, in a major expansion of Pioneer Village, Lagoon added Rattlesnake Rapids, a river rapids ride located in the new Rattlesnake Plaza. In 1998, Lagoon added the Maurer AG Wild Mouse coaster. This ride replaced the wooden Wild Mouse coaster that had been demolished 5 years prior. In 1999, Lagoon opened its first attraction above the height of : The Rocket, an S&amp;S space shot tower with two different ride towers. In 2000, Samurai, a Mondial Top Scan, was built, as well as Double Thunder Raceway. In 2001, a Monidal Top Spin, Cliffhanger, was opened. In 2002, Lagoon expanded its X-Venture Zone by adding Catapult, a reverse bungee ride. Spider, a Maurer AG steel spinning coaster, opened in 2003. In 2004, Lagoon revamped Kiddieland, giving it a garden theme and adding two new rides, Kontiki and Dragon Fly. In 2005, The Bat, an inverted coaster manufactured by Vekoma, was constructed near Lagoon-A-Beach. It is a family-friendly coaster with a minimum height requirement of 42 inches. In 2006, Lagoon expanded Kiddieland further by adding two new rides, Dinosaur Drop and Lady Bug Bop, both of which are Zierer Family Drop Towers.On June 1, 2007, a $10 million roller coaster named Wicked opened. Wicked is a Zierer tower launch coaster, and is powered by linear synchronous motors that launch riders up a tower at in 2.5 seconds. It has several elements, including an Immelmann turn, a heartline roll, two half-pipe turns, and the signature &quot;lake turn&quot; into a final tunnel before returning to the station. Several improvements were made to the park in 2007 as well. On April 5, 2008, Lagoon opened OdySea, a Zierer &quot;Flying Fish&quot; ride with aquatic theming. OdySea is an interactive ride with a joystick to control the vehicle&#x27;s height. Arrows blink to direct the rider to dodge jets of water from the sea creatures that attempt to soak the rider as accompanying audio tells a story. On April 4, 2009, Lagoon opened &quot;Jumping Dragon&quot;, a Zierer &quot;Dragon Roundabout&quot; ride.

=== 2010–present ===
In 2010, Lagoon revamped their Ferris wheel, Sky Scraper. It was dismantled after the 2009 season, and reopened with a new coat of paint in April 2010. As a result of the economic crisis, Lagoon did not install a new ride that season. Instead, the park improved their entertainment division with several new shows. In 2011, Lagoon installed another family roller coaster, named BomBora. The coaster was created by a group of manufacturers and Lagoon itself, and has a height of , as well as a theme based on 1960s surfing. In 2012, Lagoon installed a ride called Air Race. In 2013, Lagoon began work on a new coaster at the site of the former Top Eliminator. Two new family rides opened for the 2013 season, Tipsey Tea Cups and Red Rock Rally, both of which were manufactured by Zamperla. In 2014, Lagoon continued work on a new coaster, building vertically throughout the entire operating season. With much of its focus on the new coaster, no new rides were added this year. Due to maintenance problems, Lagoon-A-Beach&#x27;s old Rip-Curl slide was replaced with a new slide of the same name. At a press conference on September 4, 2014, Lagoon officially announced Cannibal, their new roller coaster for the 2015 season. On July 2, 2015, Cannibal opened, featuring a elevator lift hill, a 116° beyond vertical drop, three inversions, and a top speed of 70 mph.

Shortly after Cannibal&#x27;s opening, the park began the early planning stages of Primordial. In 2016, Lagoon did not add any attractions. However, extensive work was done on Spider. In 2017, a mural by Sril Art was created at the park. Two new rides were added to Kiddieland: Flying Tigers and Ruka Safari. In 2018, the Roller Coaster was re-tracked. A new ride opened in Kiddieland called Engine 86 in 2020. On December 18, 2021, a fire broke out at the Carousel Candy shop. The fire rekindled that evening and subsequently destroyed the candy shop and the adjacent Scamper, a miniature bumper cars ride. In 2023, Lagoon opened Primordial, a 4D interactive dark ride roller coaster, after eight years of development and construction. The attraction is located inside an artificial mountain and includes multiple ride endings. In late 2024, construction fences were put in place on the site of the former Log Flume attraction, featuring a banner for a new themed area entitled The District, which is slated to open in 2025. In November 2024, Lagoon announced that The District would include three new rides when it opened. One of these rides was announced on November 21st in a social media post as SteamWorx, an ART Wild Swing. This was followed by a second announcement on November 26th of a Zamperla NebulaZ titled Time Tinker. On January 3, 2025, Lagoon announced that the third ride would be a &quot;reimagining&quot; of an existing ride, with the former Helicopters attraction being rethemed as Rivets and Rotors.

==Controversy==
In 2012, Lagoon became the focus of animal welfare groups&#x27; protests which called for a boycott of the park, citing USDA inspection reports that suggested poor care of animals in the Wild Kingdom Train Zoo. The Utah Animal Rights Coalition and PETA pointed to a range of USDA citations over a 15-year span that included insufficient living space for and unexplained deaths of animals. While admitting to some problems, a Lagoon spokesman denied any abuse taking place and said veterinarians and staff regularly monitored the animals.

==Notable incidents==

<text>Vincent du Vigneaud (May 18, 1901 – December 11, 1978) was an American biochemist. He was recipient of the 1955 Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his work on biochemically important sulphur compounds, especially for the first synthesis of a polypeptide hormone,&quot; a reference to his work on the peptide hormone oxytocin.

==Biography==
Vincent du Vigneaud was born in Chicago in 1901, the son of French inventor and mechanic Alfred du Vigneaud and Mary Theresa. He studied at the Schurz High School and completed secondary education in 1918. His interest in sulfur began when he entered high school and his new friends invited him to run chemical experiments on explosives using sulfur. During World War I, senior students were made to work on farms, and du Vigneaud worked near Caledonia, Illinois. There he became an expert in milking cows, which inspired him to become a farmer. However, his elder sister, Beatrice, persuaded him to take up chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, after which he enrolled in the chemical engineering course. He later recalled: His interest was aroused by lectures of Carl Shipp Marvel and Howard B. Lewis, whom he remembered as being &#x27;extremely enthusiastic about sulfur.&quot; With little support from the family, he found odd jobs to support himself. After receiving his MS in 1924 he joined DuPont.

He married Zella Zon Ford, whom he met on June 12, 1924, while working as a waiter during his university course. During the fall of 1924, Marvel found him a job as an assistant biochemist at the Philadelphia General Hospital that helped him to teach clinical chemistry at the Graduate School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania. Marvel would pay for the trip to Pennsylvania in exchange for du Vigneaud&#x27;s preparation of 10 pounds of cupferron. Resuming his academic career in 1925, du Vigneaud joined the group of John R. Murlin at the University of Rochester for his PhD thesis. He graduated in 1927 with his work &quot;The Sulfur of Insulin&quot;.

After a post-doctoral position with John Jacob Abel at Johns Hopkins University Medical School (1927–1928), he traveled to Europe as National Research Council Fellow in 1928–1929, where he worked with Max Bergmann and Leonidas Zervas at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Leather Research in Dresden, and with George Barger at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. He then returned to the University of Illinois as a professor.

In 1932 he started working at the George Washington University Medical School in Washington, D.C., and in 1938 at the Cornell Medical College in New York City, where he stayed until his emeritation in 1967. Following retirement, he held a position at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.

In 1974, du Vigneaud had a stroke which forced his retirement. He died in 1978, one year after his wife&#x27;s death in 1977.

==Scientific contributions==
Du Vigneaud&#x27;s career was characterized by an interest in sulfur-containing peptides, proteins, and especially peptide hormones. Even before his Nobel-Prize-winning work on elucidating and synthesizing oxytocin and vasopressin via manipulating the AVP gene, he had established a reputation from his research on insulin, biotin, transmethylation, and penicillin.

He also carried out a series of structure-activity relationships for oxytocin and vasopressin, perhaps the first of their type for peptides. That work culminated in the publication of a book entitled &quot;A Trail of Research in Sulphur Chemistry and Metabolism and Related Fields&quot;.

==Honours ==
Du Vigneaud joined Alpha Chi Sigma while at the University of Illinois in 1930. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society in 1944, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1948. He received the 1955 Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his work on biochemically important sulphur compounds, especially for the first synthesis of a polypeptide hormone,&quot; a reference to his work on the peptide hormone oxytocin.

<text>Emily Post ( Price; October 27, 1872 – September 25, 1960) was an American author, novelist, and socialite famous for writing about etiquette.

==Early life and education==
Post was born Emily Bruce Price in Baltimore, Maryland, possibly in October 1872. The precise date is unknown. Her father was the architect Bruce Price, famed for designing luxury communities. Her mother Josephine (Lee) Price of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania was the daughter of Washington Lee, a wealthy coal baron and owner of a Pennsylvania mine. After being educated at home in her early years, Price attended Miss Graham&#x27;s finishing school in New York after her family moved there.

&quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Dinitia Smith reports, in her review of Laura Claridge&#x27;s 2008 biography of Post,

Emily was tall, pretty and spoiled. [...] She grew up in a world of grand estates, her life governed by carefully delineated rituals like the cotillion with its complex forms and its dances—the Fan, the Ladies Mocked, Mother Goose—called out in dizzying turns by the dance master.

Price met her future husband, Edwin Main Post, a prominent banker, at a ball in a Fifth Avenue mansion. Following their wedding in 1892 and a honeymoon tour of Europe, they lived in New York&#x27;s Washington Square. They also had a country cottage, named &quot;Emily Post Cottage&quot;, in Tuxedo Park, which was one of four Bruce Price Cottages she inherited from her father. The couple moved to Staten Island and had two sons, Edwin Main Post Jr. (1893) and Bruce Price Post (1895).

Emily and Edwin divorced in 1905 because of his affairs with chorus girls and fledgling actresses, which made him the target of blackmail.

==Career==
Post began to write once her two sons were old enough to attend boarding school. Her early work included humorous travel books, newspaper articles on architecture and interior design, and magazine serials for &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;The Century&quot;. She wrote five novels: &quot;Flight of a Moth&quot; (1904), &quot;Purple and Fine Linen&quot; (1905), &quot;Woven in the Tapestry&quot; (1908), &quot;The Title Market&quot; (1909), and &quot;The Eagle&#x27;s Feather&quot; (1910). In 1916, she published &quot;By Motor to the Golden Gate—&quot;a recount of a road trip she made from New York to San Francisco on the Lincoln Highway with her son Edwin and another companion.

Post wrote her first etiquette book &quot;Etiquette in Society, in Business, in Politics, and at Home&quot; (1922, frequently referenced as &quot;Etiquette&quot;) when she was 50. It became a best-seller with numerous editions over the following decades. After 1931, Post spoke on radio programs and wrote a column on good taste for the Bell Syndicate. The column appeared daily in over 200 newspapers after 1932.

In her review of Claridge&#x27;s 2008 biography of Post, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Dinitia Smith explains the keys to Post&#x27;s popularity:

Such books had always been popular in America: the country&#x27;s exotic mix of immigrants and newly rich were eager to fit in with the establishment. Men had to be taught not to blow their noses into their hands or to spit tobacco onto ladies&#x27; backs. Arthur M. Schlesinger, who wrote &quot;Learning How to Behave: A Historical Study of American Etiquette Books&quot; in 1946, said that etiquette books were part of &quot;the leveling-up process of democracy,&quot; an attempt to resolve the conflict between the democratic ideal and the reality of class. But Post&#x27;s etiquette books went far beyond those of her predecessors. They read like short-story collections with recurring characters: the Toploftys, the Eminents, the Richan Vulgars, the Gildings, and the Kindharts.

In 1946, Post founded The Emily Post Institute, which continues her work.

==Death==
Post died in her New York City apartment in 1960 at the age of 87. She is buried in the cemetery at St. Mary&#x27;s-in-Tuxedo Episcopal Church in Tuxedo Park, New York.

==Cultural legacy==
A portrait of Emily Post by Emil Fuchs (ca. 1906) is in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum.

Frank Tashlin featured Post&#x27;s caricature emerging from her etiquette book and scolding England&#x27;s King Henry VIII about his lack of manners in the cartoon &quot;Have You Got Any Castles?&quot; (1938).

&quot;Pageant&quot; in 1950 named her the second most powerful woman in America, after Eleanor Roosevelt.

On May 28, 1998, the United States Postal Service issued a 32¢ stamp featuring Post as part of their Celebrate the Century stamp sheet series.

In 2008, Laura Claridge published &quot;Emily Post: Daughter of the Gilded Age, Mistress of American Manners&quot;, the first full-length biography of the author.

<doc id="744335" wikidata="Q11722674" url="?curid=744335" title="Takens's theorem">
<text>In the study of dynamical systems, a delay embedding theorem gives the conditions under which a chaotic dynamical system can be reconstructed from a sequence of observations of the state of that system. The reconstruction preserves the properties of the dynamical system that do not change under smooth coordinate changes (i.e., diffeomorphisms), but it does not preserve the geometric shape of structures in phase space.

Takens&#x27; theorem is the 1981 delay embedding theorem of Floris Takens. It provides the conditions under which a smooth attractor can be reconstructed from the observations made with a generic function. Later results replaced the smooth attractor with a set of arbitrary box counting dimension and the class of generic functions with other classes of functions.

It is the most commonly used method for attractor reconstruction.

Delay embedding theorems are simpler to state for
discrete-time dynamical systems.
The state space of the dynamical system is a -dimensional manifold . The dynamics is given by a smooth map

:formula_1

Assume that the dynamics has a strange attractor formula_2 with box counting dimension . Using ideas from Whitney&#x27;s embedding theorem, can be embedded in -dimensional Euclidean space with

:formula_3

That is, there is a diffeomorphism that maps into formula_4 such that the derivative of has full rank.

A delay embedding theorem uses an &quot;observation function&quot; to construct the embedding function. An observation function formula_5 must be twice-differentiable and associate a real number to any point of the attractor . It must also be typical, so its derivative is of full rank and has no special symmetries in its components. The delay embedding theorem states that the function

:formula_6

is an embedding of the strange attractor in formula_7

==Simplified version==

Suppose the formula_8-dimensional 
state vector formula_9 evolves according to an unknown but continuous
and (crucially) deterministic dynamic. Suppose, too, that the
one-dimensional observable formula_10 is a smooth function of formula_11, and “coupled”
to all the components of formula_11. Now at any time we can look not just at
the present measurement formula_13, but also at observations made at times
removed from us by multiples of some lag formula_14, etc. If we use
formula_15 lags, we have a formula_15-dimensional vector. One might expect that, as the
number of lags is increased, the motion in the lagged space will become
more and more predictable, and perhaps in the limit formula_17 would become
deterministic. In fact, the dynamics of the lagged vectors become
deterministic at a finite dimension; not only that, but the deterministic
dynamics are completely equivalent to those of the original state space (precisely, they are related by a smooth, invertible change of coordinates,
or diffeomorphism). In fact, the theorem says that determinism appears once you reach dimension formula_18, and the minimal &quot;embedding dimension&quot; is often less.

== Choice of delay ==
Takens&#x27; theorem is usually used to reconstruct strange attractors out of experimental data, for which there is contamination by noise. As such, the choice of delay time becomes important. Whereas for data without noise, any choice of delay is valid, for noisy data, the attractor would be destroyed by noise for delays chosen badly.

The optimal delay is typically around one-tenth to one-half the mean orbital period around the attractor.

<doc id="744339" wikidata="Q20434" url="?curid=744339" title="Four-sided die">
<text>Four-sided dice, abbreviated d4, are often used in tabletop role-playing games to obtain random integers in the range 1–4.

==Forms==
Several forms exist of this die. One is a regular tetrahedron, which is a triangular pyramid with four equilateral triangle-shaped faces. They are nicknamed caltrops, and are peculiar in that there is no topmost face when a die comes to rest. There are several common ways of indicating the value rolled. Some of these dice have three numbers on each face. The number rolled is indicated by the number shown upright on all three visible faces—either near the midpoints of the sides around the bottom or near the angles around the top. Another configuration places only one number on each face, and the rolled number is taken from the downward face.

Another form of d4s are long dice with four isosceles triangle-shaped faces, sometimes called wedge dice. They do not roll well and are thus usually thrown into the air or shaken in a box.
A third form of d4s are long dice shaped like rectangular prisms, as used in the Scandinavian game daldøs. Landing on end may be rendered very rare simply by their small size relative to the faces, by the instability implicit in the height of the dice, and by rolling the long dice along their axes rather than tossing. Many long dice provide further insurance against landing on end by giving the ends a rounded or peaked shape, rendering such an outcome physically impossible (at least on a flat solid surface).

A fourth form of d4 has four flat sides, with the other two sides being half-cylinders whose axes are perpendicular to each other and to that of the die. Such dice are called arch&#x27;d dice, infinity dice, or modern d4.

==Historical==
Four-sided dice were among the gambling and divination tools used by early man who carved them from nuts, wood, stone, ivory and bone. Six-sided dice were invented later but four-sided dice continued to be popular in Russia. In Ancient Rome, elongated four-sided dice were called &quot;tali&quot; while the six-sided cubic dice were &quot;tesserae&quot;. In India and Tibet, three four-sided long dice were rolled sequentially as an oracle, to produce 1 of 64 possible outcomes.

The ancient Mesopotamian Royal Game of Ur uses eight four-sided pyramid-shaped dice made out of rock, half of them colored white, and half black.

==Modern gaming==
Role-playing games involving four-sided regular tetrahedral dice include &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, &quot;Ironclaw&quot;, and &quot;Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&quot;. The d20 System includes a four-sided regular tetrahedral die among other dice with 6, 8, 10, 12 and 20 faces.

<doc id="744361" wikidata="Q1234165" url="?curid=744361" title="Dodge Charger Daytona">
<text>Dodge produced three separate models with the name Dodge Charger Daytona, all of which were modified Dodge Chargers. The name was taken from Daytona Beach, Florida, which was an early center for auto racing and still hosts the Daytona 500, NASCAR&#x27;s premier event. The original Dodge Charger Daytona was designed to beat the competition in NASCAR racing. It was the first NASCAR vehicle to reach 200 miles per hour, which was a major milestone at the time.

The first use of the &#x27;Daytona&#x27; name for a car was on a version of the Studebaker Lark. The Daytona was the performance model of the compact Lark, and it was produced during the 1960s.

==First generation (1969)==

With the racing failure of the previous limited edition 1968 Dodge Charger 500 in NASCAR and Plymouth&#x27;s superstar Richard Petty leaving them for Ford, the 1969 Dodge Charger Daytona was created. It was intended to be a high-performance, limited-edition version of the Dodge Charger produced in the summer of 1969 for the sole purpose of winning high-profile NASCAR races. It won its first race, the inaugural Talladega 500, in the fall, although the top names had left the track on Saturday in a boycott of the race. Buddy Baker, in the No. 99 Chrysler Engineering Dodge Charger Daytona, was the first driver in NASCAR history to break the mark, on March 24, 1970, at Talladega. The 1969 Dodge Daytona won two races in 1969 and another four in 1970, for a total of six. Its successor, the 1970 Plymouth Superbird, won eight races – all in 1970. Dodge Daytonas also won on the USAC and ARCA race circuits. They set numerous race and pole records.

One of the two famous aero-cars, the Dodge Daytona had featured special body modifications that included a stabilizer wing on the rear deck, a special sheet-metal &quot;nose cone&quot; that replaced the traditional upright front grille, a flush rear backlight (rear window area), a &#x27;window cap&#x27; to cover the original Charger&#x27;s recessed rear window, specific front fenders and hood that were modeled after the upcoming 1970 Charger, stainless steel A-pillar covers and fender mounted cooling scoops. The Daytona was built on the 1969 Charger&#x27;s R/T trim specifications, meaning that it carried a heavy-duty suspension and brake setup and was equipped with a Magnum engine as standard. Of special note to collectors is the optional Hemi V8 engine, which only 70 of the 503 Daytonas carried. It had a corporate cousin in the &quot;one year-only&quot; 1970 Plymouth Superbird and with help of Chrysler&#x27;s missile engineers, the Charger Daytona was born.
The &quot;Winged Warriors&quot;, as they were affectionately known, did not compete for long in NASCAR&#x27;s top Cup series. On the next season of NASCAR, the executives banned aero specs on cars with engines bigger than 305 cubic inches (i.e. the same five litre limit imposed by the SCCA for the Trans-Am and internationally by the FIA for Group 5 sports cars). Because of their exceptional speed and performance, NASCAR subsequently changed the rule book, effectively banning all four of the Aero Cars from Dodge, Ford, Mercury, and Plymouth from competition by the end of 1970. See also Plymouth Superbird, Ford Torino Talladega and Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II for additional information about the aero cars. The 1971 Daytona 500 had only one winged car, the #22 called &quot;mini motor,&quot; which finished 7th.

The Dodge Daytona is now a very valuable collectible, with 440-powered Daytonas reaching into six-figure territory and 426 hemi-engined cars passing the $900,000 mark., as of August 17 2024 a Daytona reached a record high of 3,300,000 plus buyers fee at Mecum auctions.

The &quot;Super Charger IV EL&quot;, which looked like a roadster prototype spin-off of the Charger Daytona minus the roof and spoiler, is seen as a pimp-mobile in the 1974 film &quot;Truck Turner&quot;. The car was actually a Charger show car, with a front end of a Daytona mounted onto it. Foot note: These 503 cars were actually Charger 500&#x27;s as they rolled off the assembly line. Dodge shipped them to an offsite fabricator (not employees of Dodge), who transformed these by mounting the wing, supports in trunk and the front nose cone. 
==1975–1977==

For 1975–77, the Daytona name returned on the Charger, which by this time was a re-badged Chrysler Cordoba. The Daytona package of this era, was a 2-tone stripe-and-decal appearance package. A 400 c.i. big block engine could be ordered as the 318 was standard. In addition some models (very few) were equipped with a tachometer. All Daytonas came with torsion bar heavy duty suspension. And to compete against the Cordoba, they could be ordered with luxury appointments. 
Although this car was a product of the times, this was the first true Daytona produced on the assembly line. The winged cars were actually Charger 500&#x27;s sent to a custom fabrication business called Creative Industries, for installation of the wing, supports and the nose cone. Cars of this era are extremely rare as their numbers were very low and the automakers were buying cheap steel from overseas. A Good number of these cars were junked due to rust issues.
These cars like their predecessor were slow to move off showroom floors. Not because of their appearance, but because of heavy, gas guzzling cars of the time. With gas prices increasing, America was looking for more economical cars.

==Second generation (2006–2009)==

The Dodge Charger was reintroduced for 2006 with a limited production Dodge Charger Daytona package that included a sportier interior, classic high impact exterior colors, a rear spoiler, a front chin spoiler, a blacked out grille surround, rear quarter panel striping reading &quot;DAYTONA&quot; on either side, a blackout vinyl between the taillights on the decklid, and a black vinyl on the hood with the word &quot;HEMI&quot; cut out twice. Heritage R/T badges replaced the Stock R/T&#x27;s chrome badges. A performance suspension with load-leveling rear shocks was also standard, as well as unique wheels. 2006 wheels were the stock R/T 18&quot; wheels with charcoal grey painted pockets, and lower profile wider tires. 2007 to 2009 wheels are 20&quot; chrome clad wheels. In 2008, the rear quarter panel stripes were removed, and replaced with a strobe stripe on the lower portions of the doors that reads &quot;DAYTONA&quot; towards the front of the stripe. The hood decal was also modified. The 2006–2008 Daytona gains over the standard Charger R/T via a freer flowing exhaust system featuring a single pass center muffler, and a larger diameter stock air cleaner giving it 350 hp. The car also had unique engine management software that removed the stock R/T speed limiter. The 2009 features the new Variable Camshaft Timing HEMI, producing . These are the First Daytona&#x27;s to wear a badge listing the number it was produced out of total production numbers


==Third generation (2013)==
The 2013 Dodge Charger Daytona debuted at the 2012 Los Angeles International Auto Show as the re-introduction of the legendary Dodge Charger Daytona. Available in Charger R/T and Charger R/T Road &amp; Track trim levels, the 2013 Dodge Charger Daytona brought back the unique style of the historic Daytona package with all the modern performance and technology offered in the 2013 Charger line-up. Only 3,000 units of the Daytona were produced in this limited-production run.

&quot;With its 370-horsepower HEMI V-8, rear-wheel drive and iconic design, the 2013 Dodge Charger is a modern-day muscle car, and the new Dodge Charger Daytona takes it to a new level by paying homage to the historic &#x27;Daytona&#x27; nameplate,&quot; said Reid Bigland, President and CEO, Dodge Brand. &quot;It starts with a legendary HEMI underfoot and one-of-a-kind interior and exterior styling enhancements that perfectly combine heritage, performance and value, starting under $33,000 MSRP.&quot;

Available in a unique color palette of Daytona Blue, Bright White, Billet Silver, Pitch Black, or purple the Daytona package featured special dark trim that built upon the Charger&#x27;s iconic muscle car design. Satin Black adorned the front crosshair grille with heritage &quot;R/T&quot; badge, the custom vinyl hood graphic, roof wrap, rear R/T spoiler and the &quot;DAYTONA&quot; graphic on the rear quarter panels. It featured exclusive 20-inch five-spoke polished aluminum wheels with Gloss Black painted pockets.

Models also included a &#x27;Daytona Blue&#x27; engine cover, performance 3.06 rear axle ratio, high-speed engine controller, paddle shifters with sport mode and performance steering and suspension.

The Dodge Charger Daytona&#x27;s interior on the Road &amp; Track featured unique black performance Nappa leather and suede heated and ventilated seats with Daytona Blue stitching and piping. Similarly, the Daytona on the R/T offered the same appearance in a custom sport cloth seat. &quot;DAYTONA&quot; was embroidered in blue into the upper front seat backs. Unique dark brushed aluminum trim surrounded the 8.4-inch Uconnect Touch screen and gauges on the instrument panel, as well as the trim around the shifter and cup holders on the center console. Finishing touches included a Mopar bright pedal kit, a 552-watt 10-speaker Beats Audio System, and a special numbered &quot;DAYTONA&quot; badge on the instrument panel that featured the build number of that specific Dodge Charger Daytona model.

The Manufacturer&#x27;s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) was $32,990 for R/T and $36,495 for R/T Road &amp; Track Daytona models.

==Fourth generation (2015-2023)==

The new 2017 Dodge Charger Daytona and Daytona 392 was unveiled in August 2016. In the US market, where it is most popular, it features a choice of either a 5.7 Liter or 6.4 Liter V8. In Canada however, the Dodge Charger Daytona is only available with the 5.7 Liter V8. The Daytona and Daytona 392 trim will also include the upgrades from the Super Track Pack(Sport Suspension, Custom Brake linings, and Goodyear Eagle F1 Tires). The car will be available for order starting in October 2016. Unlike the 2013 Daytona, the 2017 vehicles are not numbered. Insurance inquiry into a Daytona VIN shows the vehicle as a &quot;2017 Dodge Charger Scat Pack 392&quot;. The Scat Pack is the R/T with the 392 c.i. engine. The Daytona is a package option on the Scat Pack.

The 2020 Daytona gets the 717-hp version of the standard Hellcat engine and is limited to 501 units.

<text>Kirtland Air Force Base is a United States Air Force base. It is located in the southeast quadrant of the Albuquerque, New Mexico, urban area, adjacent to the Albuquerque International Sunport. The base was named for the early Army aviator Col. Roy C. Kirtland. The military and the international airport share the same runways, making ABQ a joint civil-military airport.

Kirtland AFB is the largest installation in Air Force Global Strike Command and sixth largest in the United States Air Force. The base occupies 51,558 acres and employs over 23,000 people, including more than 4,200 active duty and 1,000 Guard, plus 3,200 part-time Reserve personnel. In 2000, Kirtland AFB&#x27;s economic impact on the City of Albuquerque was over $2.7 billion. 

Kirtland is the home of the Air Force Materiel Command&#x27;s Nuclear Weapons Center (NWC). The NWC&#x27;s responsibilities include acquisition, modernization and sustainment of nuclear system programs for both the Department of Defense and Department of Energy. The NWC is composed of two wings–the 377th Air Base Wing and 498th Nuclear Systems Wing–along with ten groups and seven squadrons.

Kirtland is home to the 58th Special Operations Wing (58 SOW), an Air Education and Training Command (AETC) unit that provides formal aircraft type/model/series training. The 58 SOW operates the HC-130J, MC-130J, UH-1N Huey, HH-60G Pave Hawk and CV-22 Osprey aircraft. Headquarters, Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center is also located at Kirtland AFB. Additionally the 150th Special Operations Wing of the New Mexico Air National Guard, an Air Combat Command (ACC)-gained unit, is also garrisoned at Kirtland.

==History==

Kirtland Air Force Base was named for Colonel Roy C. Kirtland (1874–1941) in February 1942. Colonel Kirtland learned to fly in 1911 in one of the first Wright airplanes at Dayton, Ohio. During World War I, he organized and commanded a regiment of mechanics and served as an inspector of aviation facilities. Recalled from retirement in 1941 at age 65, he was oldest military pilot in the Air Corps. Colonel Kirtland died of a heart attack on 2 May 1941 at Moffett Field, California.

Kirtland Air Force Base has dramatically changed since its establishment as a U.S. Army airfield in 1941. It has evolved from a hastily constructed training and testing facility necessitated by World War II, to a significant USAF center for R&amp;D. What began as a 2,000-acre air base has grown into a 51,800-plus-acre facility.

=== Origins ===
Kirtland Air Force Base&#x27;s beginnings stem from three private airfields of 1928 to 1939 and are similar to that of other installations choosing to adapt existing runways and hangars for military use.

In 1928, two Santa Fe Railroad employees working with the town of Albuquerque, graded two runways on East Mesa with one approximately 5,300 feet long and the other just under 4,000 feet. Albuquerque Airport was wholly a private venture, irrespective of the town&#x27;s involvement. Immediately following construction of the airport, other individuals and promoters became interested in Albuquerque as a crossroads location for southwestern air traffic. James G. Oxnard, a New York entrepreneur, bought Franklin&#x27;s interest in Albuquerque Airport, expanding the facility toward the end of 1928.

The airfield soon drew business from private flyers, as well as Transcontinental Air Transport (TAT) and Western Air Express (WAE), commercial airlines that set up operations at the new airport. The city&#x27;s viability as a crossroad of air traffic in the Southwest was confirmed by this early success. As the 1920s closed, the two airlines initiated competitive passenger, mail, and cargo service between the Midwest and California; which positioned Albuquerque as an important transcontinental airfield.

WAE soon moved to the West Mesa Airport and was joined by TAT as the two airlines merged to become Trans World Airlines (TWA). This new facility, also private, became known as Albuquerque Airport, and the first, which was renamed Oxnard Field, also continued to service general aviation needs. In the mid-1930s, Mayor Tingley, other city officials, and TWA management began to conceive of a municipal airport, the next necessary step in confirming Albuquerque&#x27;s status as a &quot;Crossroads of the Southwest.&quot; With the help of President Roosevelt&#x27;s Works Progress Administration (WPA) funds, construction on a new airport was begun four miles west of Oxnard Field and completed in 1939, on the cusp of World War II.

In January 1939, Major General Henry &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold, who became chief of the U.S. Army Air Corps (AAC), proposed to Congress that money be spent on a strong air defense. It soon became a national priority to secure airfields and bombing and gunnery ranges. An effort was also being made in cooperation with the WPA and Civil Aeronautics Authority to build up civilian airports of value to national defense efforts (Tagg 1998). Albuquerque city leaders began to examine the possibility of an air base locating on the mesa, and through extensive negotiations with the AAC, succeeded in their efforts when the Army established an air base on the East Mesa in 1939.

===World War II===

As of late 1939, Army and Navy pilots began using Oxnard Field for refueling and maintenance for a variety of military flights. Later that same year, the Army Air Corps leased 2,000 acres neighboring Albuquerque Airport, four miles west of Oxnard Field. The Army eventually condemned the Oxnard Field property for military use, with subsequent transfer to the federal government.

Construction of Albuquerque Army Air Base began in January 1941 and was completed in August 1941. Albuquerque Army Air Base received its first military aircraft in March, and on 1 April 1941, a lone B-18 bomber, landed on the north–south runway. With the assignment of five pilots to the aircraft, the day marked the official opening of Albuquerque Army Air Base. The first buildings on the installation were simple wood-frame structures constructed quickly in order to fulfill the country&#x27;s urgent need for trained pilots to fight the war. Most of the buildings were Theater of Operations construction while some were of the Mobilization type. The Mobilization type buildings included the station hospital, theater, chapel, and Link training buildings.

During World War II there were three levels of pilot training:
* Primary Flying School
* Basic Flying School
* Advanced Flying School (including Transition Training)

The Albuquerque Army Air Base provided advanced flying training in &quot;AT&quot; (advanced trainer) trainer aircraft and transition training in combat-ready aircraft, primarily the B-17 Flying Fortress and the B-24 Liberator. In addition to pilot training, the Albuquerque Army Air Base provided bombardier training at its Advanced Flying School. During this period, the facility was under the Flying Training Command and the Air Training Command.

In addition to the main airfield, several auxiliary airfields were used to support the flying school:
* Oxnard Airport (Original Albuquerque Airport) 
* West Mesa Airport 
* Acomita CAA Intermediate Airfield 
* Paddy Auxiliary Army Airfield 
* Santa Fe Auxiliary Army Airfield
* Socorro Auxiliary Army Airfield 

====19th Bombardment Group====

The 19th Bombardment Group arrived at Albuquerque AAB from March Field, California, in April 1941, shortly after the base was activated. Its purpose was to train air and ground crews for reconnaissance and bombing duty on Boeing B-17 &quot;Flying Fortresses&quot; before deployment to Clark Field in the Philippine Islands. The 19th Bombardment Group became the most famous bomber unit of World War II for its part in the strategic campaign against Japan. The 30th, 32nd, and 93rd Bombardment Squadrons and the 38th Reconnaissance Squadron were assigned to the 19th Bombardment Group. The 3rd Air Base Squadron, also assigned to the 19th Bombardment Group, was the first to arrive on base. Headquarters, materiel, quartermaster, ordnance, and signal detachments accompanied it. On 10 April, the squadrons began operations.

Because B-17s were in short supply, the pilots trained on Douglas B-18 Bolos and Northrop A-17s, as well as Stearman PT-17 biplanes. Under the command of Lt. Colonel Eugene Eubank, the 19th Bombardment Group focused on precision, high-altitude, and formation flying. They also flew mock attacks on New Mexico villages and ranches. Eubank was known for being a taskmaster, demanding that his pilots gain extensive cockpit experience and that the men cross-train as navigators and bombardiers. As such, it was purported that every B-17 flight had a half-dozen pilots aboard, two flying, two practicing dead reckoning and celestial navigation, and two making practice bomb runs.

====Ferrying command training====
The 19th Bombardment Group transferred to active duty in September 1941. It was replaced by the AAC Ferrying Command Specialized Four Engine school. The school operated under the Army Air Corps Ferrying Command, which had been established in late May 1941 and charged with transporting aircraft overseas for delivery to the Royal Air Force. The students were training to ferry Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers, (the aircraft used at the Four-Engine School) and other multi-engine aircraft to the RAF in Great Britain. TWA chose Albuquerque for the school&#x27;s location because of its 10,000-foot runway, which could accommodate B-24s, as well as its fair weather. The students were trained in pilot skills, instrument flying, meteorology, radio, briefing, and general transition.

TWA pilots and ground crews were readily available as instructors; the difficulty was in housing the students because base quarters were not finished. Consequently, they doubled up in the barracks. The first contingent of B-24 trainees arrived in Albuquerque on 19 June 1941. The facility was officially titled the Air Corps Ferrying Command Four-Engine Transition School but was unofficially referred to as the &quot;Four-Engine School&quot; or &quot;Jack Frye School&quot;—for the president of TWA. Its location on the base was called the Eagle Nest Flight Center.

Using Link Trainers and B-24 training aircraft, the TWA instructors trained more than 1,100 pilots and crewmen during the eight months the company operated the school. On 7 February 1942, the U.S. Army transferred the training function from TWA back to the USAAF, and the school was redesignated the Combat Crew Training School. The Air Corps Ferrying Command was redesignated the Army Air Forces Ferrying Command in March 1942, a month after the AAC transferred the school from TWA training back to the military. The command was then redesignated the Air Transport Command in July 1942—the same month that the school was transferred from Albuquerque to Smyrna Army Airfield, Tennessee.

====Bombardier training====



With the departure of the 19th Bombardment Group from Albuquerque Army Air Base in the fall of 1941, Major General Arnold moved the military&#x27;s bombardier school from Louisiana to Albuquerque for two reasons—good weather and the availability of vacant land on which to build bombing ranges. It was proclaimed the &quot;World’s First Bombardier School&quot;, and on 24 December 1941 it was officially designated an Army Air Forces Advanced Flying School under the USAAF Western Flying Training Command.

The 56th and 88th School Squadrons, the 9th Materiel Squadron, and the 92nd Quartermaster Battalion arrived the week after the Pearl Harbor Attack, followed shortly by the 383rd and 384th School Squadrons and the 459th Ordnance Company. The director of the school, Colonel John P. Ryan, was praised for rapidly organizing the nation&#x27;s first permanent bombardier training school. Instructors, maintenance personnel, and cadets arrived so quickly that base operations such as engineering and supply had to be operated out of pyramidal tents lacking heat and protection from blowing sand. Other problems included lack of aircraft parking space and adequate lighting near the aircraft parking ramp. New construction projects began early in 1942, adding offices and housing quarters, ordnance storage, a photography lab, flightline buildings, and maintenance hangars. The base undertook paving and lighting of aircraft parking spaces, and scheduled the building of additional runways and taxiways.

Students began training on twin-engine Beechcraft AT-11 Kansan bomber trainers. By January 1942, there were 50 aircraft on base, in addition to 28 B-18A Bolo bombers used for training. Eventually, about 150 AT-11s served the school. The USAAF established a new minimum proficiency standard for bombardier trainees in 1943. Trainees were required to hit their targets during at least 22 percent of their drops. Practice combat flying missions required continuous evasive action within a 10-mile radius of the intended target. The final approach was required to be straight, level and taking no longer than 60 seconds.

The school taught bombardiers the technique of bomb sighting. Bombardiers were required to crawl down shafts that gave way to the &quot;bubble,&quot; from which they had bird&#x27;s-eye views of the ground below. The bombardier&#x27;s job was to feed the bombsight the needed information, air speed, wind speed, wind direction, altitude, and the angle of drift. As the aircraft approached the target, the pilot turned the aircraft over to the bombardier and the Norden bombsight, which was also an automatic pilot that flew the aircraft as bombs were released over the target. Classroom instruction at the Albuquerque base was held at night and training missions were flown during the day to bombsights around Albuquerque. Servicemen and WPA workers were tasked with laying out bombing ranges for training. These were located west and southwest of Albuquerque, including a major range located between the neighboring village, Los Lunas and the Rio Puerco. Contracts for day and night bombing targets on the ranges were let during January 1942, and access roads to the targets were constructed. Bomb ranges numbered 2,450 square miles on ranch and Indian reservation land by the end of 1942. At that time, a total of 24 targets, simulated cities and warships, were in use on the ranges.

Bombardier school was 12 to 18 weeks during which a student dropped approximately 160 bombs; precise records were kept of hits and misses. The elimination rate for trainees was 12 percent, and upon graduation, a new bombardier was transferred to an operational training unit and trained for overseas duty. Albuquerque was an operational training facility, and the first class of 61 bombardiers from the Albuquerque base school graduated 7 March 1942. By 1945, Albuquerque&#x27;s flying training field had turned out 5,719 bombardiers and 1,750 regular pilots for the B-24 bomber alone. The 51st class to complete the bombardier training course included 143 bombardiers. Chiang Kai-shek pilots and bombardiers received training from Kirtland Field instructors. And film actor Jimmy Stewart was stationed at Kirtland Field briefly, beginning in August 1942, assisting bombardier cadet training by flying bombers on training missions.

====Additional training====
Bombardier and pilot training was not the only focus at Kirtland Field between 1942 and 1945. In 1943, the USAAF Flying Training Command merged with the Technical Training Command in an effort to save manpower. The new command, the Air Training Command, became responsible for all training from classification center through pilot and technical schools. In 1943, Kirtland Field facilities expanded to support existing bombardier training plus other training missions. This expansion was the result of the merging of the two training commands.

Expanded training at Kirtland Field included a ground school for glider pilots—called the Glider Replacement Center, which was established in July 1942. The center served as a temporary training area for glider pilots awaiting vacancies at glider schools. The Army Air Forces glider-training program had expanded, and prior flight training was eliminated as a necessary qualification for candidates. On 30 June, the War Department opened the program to any man between 18 and 36 who could meet the physical and mental requirements, including civilians as well as officers and enlisted men. At Kirtland Field, the Glider Replacement Center operated until February 1943.

In May 1943, a Women&#x27;s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) contingent was established at Kirtland Field with the arrival of 45 women on base. WAAC quarters built at Kirtland Field included barracks, a day room, beauty shop, and supply room. A WAAC open house for the new post was held in August 1943 and several hundred men with their wives and families attended. Initially, most WAACs and WACs worked as file clerks, typists, stenographers, or motor pool drivers. Gradually, their jobs grew more technical as positions were created for weather forecasters, parachute riggers, radio operators and repair specialists, sheet metal workers, bombsight maintenance specialists, control tower operators, and cryptographers.

In August 1943, Kirtland Field became host to a USAAF Provisional B-24 Liberator Pilot Transition School designed to train airplane commanders. Transition training was the final step after successful completion of Primary, Basic, and Advanced Flying training. The Bombardier School, for the most part, furnished facilities and maintenance, and personnel from two squadrons, that had been part of the Bombardier School, were put to work in the B-24 school. Officer pilots were selected for the new school from advanced twin-engine training schools. Instruction covered day and night navigation and instrument flying, formation and altitude flying, comprehensive ground schoolwork, engineering, radio, meteorology, weather flying, first aid and oxygen training, as well as a course on the duties of an airplane commander.

A school for navigation was also established at Kirtland Field in the summer of 1943. The six-week navigation training course extended bombardier cadets’ schooling from 12 weeks to 18 weeks, qualifying them to serve as navigators as well. The navigation instructors were often recent combat veterans; the school combined regular bombardier missions to targets throughout New Mexico with navigational missions.

A month later, headquarters of the 38th Flying Training Wing relocated from Roswell Army Airfield, New Mexico to Kirtland Field. One of the wings under the Western Flying Training Command, the 38th held jurisdiction not only over Kirtland Field but also the Hobbs, Roswell, and Carlsbad Army Air Fields; Williams Field, Arizona; and Victorville Air Field, California. The wing relocated to Williams Field, Arizona, in February 1945 due to Kirtland Field&#x27;s conversion to a Superfortress base under the Second Air Force.

Kirtland Field served as a B-29 Superfortress base in support of the incendiary bombing raids on Japan. In March 1945, Kirtland Field was converted into a Superfortress base in a matter of only 45 days after its assignment to the Second Air Force. The Second Air Force, operating under the Continental Air Forces, concentrated on training for heavy and very heavy bombers during the war. Kirtland Field was one of six stations in the 16th Bombardment Operational Training Wing program. Other locations were Alamogordo Army Airfield and Clovis Army Airfield in New Mexico; Biggs Army Airfield and Pyote Army Airfield in Texas; and Davis-Monthan Army Airfield in Arizona.

====Manhattan Project====
Perhaps one of the most important functions Kirtland Field served during World War II was as a transportation center for the needs of scientists developing the atomic bomb in Los Alamos. The Manhattan Project personnel in Los Alamos first became aware of the value of the location of the air base during the process of converting the atomic bomb into a practical airborne weapon. Because Kirtland Field was the closest large airport, its runways and bombloading pit supported the atomic bomb program during 1944 and 1945. It also became an important staging ground for the ferrying of men and material to various field sites.

From Kirtland Field, Manhattan Project scientists were flown back and forth to Wendover Army Air Base for testing in a disguised &quot;Green Hornet&quot; aircraft. Members of the USAAF made similar trips from Wendover through Albuquerque to Los Alamos. A special Manhattan Engineer District, Military Police unit was located at Kirtland Field to guard facilities used to load Los Alamos–assembled ordnance and test shapes on Silverplate aircraft. The loading pit constructed at Kirtland Field, although primitive and manually operated, operated until December 1945, when a hydraulic lift was installed.

On 16 July 1945, at Kirtland Field, two B-29 Superfortress observation planes had set out early in the morning with instructions from Oppenheimer to steer a course at least 15 miles west of the atomic detonation point, Trinity Site. Because of thunderstorms, the planes dropped from 23,000 to 18,000 feet before circling the Trinity Site during the first atomic bomb detonation. While &quot;The Gadget&quot; underwent field-testing at Trinity, the nuclear components for the bombs and the active materials were being sent piecemeal to Tinian. Shortly before the bomb testing at the Trinity site, components of Little Boy were driven from Los Alamos to Kirtland Field and then flown to San Francisco. This included some of the U-235. From San Francisco, they were transported to Hunters Point to board the cruiser , bound for Tinian. Following that, the Fat Man plutonium core and its initiator were driven down to Albuquerque. They left Kirtland Field on 26 July and were flown in a C-54 Skymaster to Tinian, where they arrived 28 July. Such was Kirtland Field&#x27;s last important role in the U.S. defeat of Japan, thereby ending World War II.

However, it was not its last connection with the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, which largely would determine the base&#x27;s fate in the postwar economy.

To the east of the air base, at Oxnard Field, the U.S. Army also acquired 1,100 acres of land to develop a school for aircraft mechanics. An Air Depot Training Station, it was unofficially referred to as &quot;Sandia Base&quot;. After various other incarnations—as a convalescent center and aircraft burial ground—Sandia Base became the precursor to Sandia National Laboratories when the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Z Division relocated from Los Alamos to continue top-secret work development of atomic weapons.

The New Mexico Proving Grounds (NMPG) was constructed concurrently with the development of the Albuquerque Army Air Base and the activities at the old Oxnard Field. It was built to the south to serve as the base for testing the top-secret proximity fuze, a device that played an important role in defeat of the German Vergeltungswaffe (V-1) rocket. The proximity fuze, a weapon that was later dubbed by the media as the second most important one developed during the war. By war&#x27;s end, nearly 50,000 acres had been acquired for the NMPG, this acreage is to the south of the runway and main base that today makes up the greatest portion of Kirtland AFB.

===Postwar aircraft storage depot===

With the end of World War II, the base again became Albuquerque Army Air Field and was used by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation—later called the War Assets Administration. Old or surplus aircraft were to be sold or demolished at the site. Albuquerque Army Air Field received some 2,250 old or surplus aircraft, such as obsolete B-24 Liberator and B-17 Flying Fortress bombers, and smaller aircraft like AT-6 Texan trainers, Curtiss P-40 Warhawk and Bell P-39 Airacobra fighters. Aircraft that the Civil Aeronautics Administration licensed for public use were sold to the public, with prices ranging from $100 for a PT-17 Stearman to $90,000 for a C-54 Skymaster. North American Aviation bought back a large number of their AT-6s, overhauled and resold them to customers including the Dutch and Chinese governments. The remaining 1,151 aircraft were put up for bid in the fall of 1946. The Denver contracting firm that successfully bid on the surplus planes sold some of the engines for commercial air transports, but by the end of the year, the remaining surplus planes were &quot;chopped into sections and melted into ingots in a constantly burning smelter&quot;. This storage and recycling effort was the last of Albuquerque Army Air Field&#x27;s wartime contributions.

===Cold War===
Kirtland AAB was put on a temporary inactive basis on 31 December 1945. When World War II ended, it was not clear whether Kirtland Field would be closed or become a permanent USAF facility. The transformation of the Air Depot Training Station into Sandia
Base, home to Sandia Laboratory and the AFSWP, kept the facility open and ultimately determined its fate. Kirtland Field was renamed Kirtland AFB, and it became the USAF&#x27;s main facility for integrating new weapons designs produced by Sandia Laboratory with operational USAF aircraft and equipment.

====Atomic weapons development====
On 1 February 1946, Kirtland was transferred to the Fourth Air Force for use as a flight test center. Kirtland Field was returning to B-29 Superfortress activity as the flight-testing headquarters for the 58th Bombardment Wing, which had been stationed at Roswell Army Airfield, New Mexico under the Fourth Air Force. This B-29 unit would assist the Z Division at Sandia Base with flight-testing new atomic weapons designs. The 428th AAF Base Unit (Flight Test) was activated as a unit of the 58th Bombardment Wing and the host of Kirtland Field on 1 February 1946. At that time, there were fewer than 300 officers and enlisted men at the field. Because there were so few personnel on hand, morale was low and workloads were strenuous for the installation throughout the early Cold War period.

On 21 March 1946, Strategic Air Command (SAC) was activated and on 31 March 1946, SAC&#x27;s Fifteenth Air Force assumed operation of Kirtland Field. The 58th Bombardment Wing remained in command of the installation under SAC, and there was a return of personnel. Shortly thereafter, an &quot;S-2 Section&quot; was established on base and became responsible for the security of Kirtland Field and the &quot;W-47 Project&quot;. The W-47 Project had been the wartime operation established at Wendover Army Air Base to train the 509th Composite Group to drop the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In keeping with Kirtland Field&#x27;s mission to assist Sandia Base&#x27;s Z Division with the marriage of bombs and aircraft, the 509th Composite Group&#x27;s Flight Test Section was transferred to Kirtland.

As these arrangements were taking place, a new subgroup of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos was being organized. Titled the Z Division for its chief, Dr. Jerrold Zacharias, a Los Alamos scientist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the new group&#x27;s mission was to manage the engineering design, production, assembly, and field-testing of the non-nuclear components associated with nuclear bombs. Construction began on guard, storage, administrative, and laboratory facilities for the Z Division. Because the airfield was still receiving surplus warplanes, the U.S. Army constructed a fenced area for classified activities. They employed security measures including tanks, guard towers, and watch dogs to protect the small stockpile of atomic weapons parts. In the years after the war, Sandia Base boundaries would vastly expand to include the thousands of acres owned by the NMPG, which occupied much of the East Mesa.

Base operations began to increase in June 1946 with the organization of a full-scale Ground Training Program and the arrival of the Special Ordnance Squadron and Special Transport Flight of the 58th Bombardment Wing. Aircraft being maintained by the 58th Bombardment Wing included five B-29 Superfortresses and C-45 Expeditors, two C-47s, B-25 Mitchells and L-5s, and a C-46 Commando, AT-11 Kansan, F-80 Shooting Star, F-61 Black Widow, and F-59 Airacomet. Prior to the new Ground Training Program, which began officially on 24 June 1946, some training was carried out by individual units, primarily physical engineering, bombardiering, and armament. With the new program came a push for development of a comprehensive organization, with training in navigation, bombing, personnel equipment, chemical warfare, physical training, synthetic training, and use of the gunnery range.

A primary mission for Kirtland Field was recorded in the September 1946 narrative history: &quot;[To] provide aerial and ground functioning testing facilities and conduct functional tests on all equipment and materiel related to the use of special weapons and radioactive materials&quot;. Between late 1946 and early 1947, after the Atomic Energy Act creating the Atomic Energy Commission was passed, the AFSWP was established with Sandia Base as an installation under its control. A special engineering battalion was also created to aid in the assembly and maintenance of atomic bombs at Sandia Base.

In July and August 1946, Kirtland Field and Sandia Base personnel took part in Operation Crossroads at the Eniwetok Proving Ground in the Pacific&#x27;s Marshall Islands. Operation Crossroads was the first of many atmospheric nuclear weapons tests in the early Cold War years. The Kirtland Field Narrative Histories do not make specific reference to participation in Operation Crossroads by groups at Kirtland Field, but this is most likely due to the high security that the operation garnered.

With the focus on atomic weapons, in early December 1946, Kirtland Field was again transferred, this time to the Air Materiel Command (AMC), specifically the Directorate, Research and Development, HQ, AMC. AMC was responsible for all USAF R&amp;D, including atomic weapons. The transfer took place due to Kirtland Field&#x27;s close proximity to Sandia Base and the Z Division. The AMC mission at Kirtland Field was &quot;to provide flight services for the Manhattan [Engineering] District at Sandia and Los Alamos in atomic bomb testing&quot;.

In early 1947, the AMC established Kirtland Field&#x27;s mission as the USAAF nuclear weapons facility, a continuation of the wartime Wendover Army Air Base (509th Composite Group)–Manhattan Project operations. Kirtland&#x27;s role in the testing and evaluation of atomic weapons increased in 1947 when Kirtland Army Air Field, became Kirtland Air Force Base.

Secondary missions at Kirtland Field during the inception of the Cold War included furnishing facilities for the Air Force Reserve and Civil Air Patrol (CAP). The establishment of the Air Reserve facilities, and in July 1947 the New Mexico Air National Guard (NM ANG) was assigned to Kirtland Field and federally recognized as the 188th Fighter-Bomber Squadron. The unit was composed of a flight equipped with Douglas A-26 Invader light bombers, a fighter squadron flying 25 P-51 Mustangs and three T-6 Texan trainers, plus a small weather detachment.

====Aircraft atomic weapons modification center====

The Convair B-36 Peacemaker aircraft arrived at Kirtland AFB in September 1948, most likely into the hands of the HQ Squadron 3170th Special Weapons Group. The B-36 was a state-of-the-art bomber and was large and heavy, weighing 300,000 pounds. It was limited to a small number of bases. Kirtland, with its 10,000-foot-long and 200-foot-wide runway, was one of those bases, and as such was one of few installations around the country to receive the aircraft. In anticipation of the arrival of the B-36, facilities at Kirtland were improved, including new overlays on the north–south runway.

The B-36 was the first intercontinental bomber able to carry any weapon in the U.S. arsenal across distances up to 3,900 miles. Thus, it was the principal means of deterrence from 1948 to the late 1950s. It was flown extensively in later atomic weapons tests at the Marshall Islands and at the Nevada Proving Ground. Yet, in its entire history, the &quot;Peacemaker&quot; never dropped a bomb in combat. Although the six-engine B-36 bomber was one of the newest aircraft in the USAF, it was not initially designed to carry atomic weapons and therefore required modifications in order to be coupled with such weapons. These modifications and weapons marriage occurred at Kirtland under the HQ Squadron 3170th Special Weapons Group.

Many other marriages of aircraft and weapons were completed at Kirtland. The XB-47 Stratojet, the first U.S. swept-wing, multi-engine bomber, shortly followed the arrival of the B-36 at Kirtland for modification. According to Kirtland monthly histories, during that period, as new types of aircraft were acquired by the USAF, they were flown to Kirtland to undergo modifications and fly missions related to their incorporation into the special weapons arena.

The following summer (June 1949), the assigned organizations of KAFB were again redesignated, by General Order No. 52, HQ, AMC. They were as follows:
* HQ and HQ Squadron, 2758th Experimental Wing
* HQ and HQ Squadron, 3170th Special Weapons Group
* HQ and HQ Squadron, 2930th Maintenance and Supply Group
* HQ and HQ Squadron, 2797th Medical Group
* HQ and HQ Squadron, 3078th Air Base Group

====Air Force Special Weapons Command====

In response to the explosion of a Soviet atomic bomb in the fall of 1949, and following the U.S.’s new military strategy of deterrence, in December 1949 the Special Weapons Command (SWC), a USAF Major Command, was established to develop and test atomic weapons.

====New Mexico Air Defense====

Along with its assignment under SWC, Kirtland AFB received a related air defense mission for Air Defense Command (ADC). Kirtland housed an ADC Air Defense Detection Center (ADDC) which would then alert the Fighter-Interceptor squadrons and the Air Defense Control Center (ADCC) for unknown aircraft intrusions in ADC monitored airspace. The ADCC would then alert ADC&#x27;s Central Air Defense Force, which consisted of the Western Air Defense Force [WADF], the Central Air Defense Force [CADF], and the Eastern Air Defense Force [EADF]. Kirtland hosted one of the first ADCCs in the country, which was under construction at Kirtland in late 1950 and operational before the close of 1951 as part of the 34th Air Division (Defense). ADCCs were innovative buildings that were proto-hardened and designed for protection from atomic, biological, and chemical warfare. A single ADCC controlled multiple FISs for its air defense jurisdiction. Along with the ADCC at KAFB was a corresponding ADDC.

The central New Mexico region was considered a high air defense priority in the early Cold War because of Sandia Laboratory, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL), and the newly created nuclear weapons stockpile. On 25 April 1950, KAFB became HQ for the newly created 34th Air Division (Defense). The 34th Air Division (Defense) protected New Mexico and Arizona, most of Colorado and Utah, and a portion of West Texas. This included Los Alamos, the Sandia Kirtland complex, the White Sands and Biggs, Walker and Davis-Monthan Air Force Bases.

In tandem with its hosting of HQ 34th Air Division (Defense), Kirtland began hosting a subordinate Aircraft Control and Warning (AC&amp;W) radar station in 1950. The 690th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron in charge of the station was supported, at the outset of the mission, directly on base in temporary Jamesway huts—round Quonset-hut type structures.

KAFB remained the HQ for the 34th Air Division (Defense) throughout the 1950s until 1 January 1960. From that date until 1 November 1960, the zone was referred to as the Albuquerque Air Defense Sector. By the early 1960s, however, the USAF began shifting emphasis away from intercepting bombers in favor of the detection of Intercontinental ballistic missiles. Funding cutbacks began to cripple ADC programs, and that particular era of air defense drew to a close.

====81st Fighter-Interceptor Wing====

In June 1949, Kirtland AFB became host to one of the earliest alert Air Defense Command fighter interceptor wings created for air defense of the U.S., the 81st Fighter Wing, which had been established in May 1948 at Wheeler AFB, Hawaii. The 81st Fighter Wing was redesignated the 81st Fighter-Interceptor Wing in January 1950, flew the F-86A Sabre Jet day fighter and was responsible for defense of the areas around LASL and Sandia Base. The 81st Fighter-Interceptor Wing was on constant alert, with aircraft typically parked at the ends of runways and their crews on duty in nearby makeshift structures. In July 1950 Kirtland was one of only 14 priority FIS locations in the continental U.S.

However, the air defense area in New Mexico for the 81st Fighter-Interceptor Wing lasted only a short while. In May 1950, the 81st Fighter-Interceptor Wing departed for Moses Lake AFB, Washington, along with the 91st and 92d FIS, which were under its jurisdiction. The 93d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron took the 81st Fighter-Interceptor Wing&#x27;s place at Kirtland and was attached to the Albuquerque Air Defense Sector in the same month. The 93d FIS employed the F-86A Sabre jet, the USAF&#x27;s first swept-wing jet designed as a high-altitude day fighter, was on ready alert, and was continually training to increase its combat efficiency.

====Air Force Special Weapons Center====
By 1952, the Atomic Energy Commission had substantially increased both the quantity and variety of nuclear weapons, requiring Special Weapons Command to engage in R&amp;D work and expand its test support activities. It was subsequently reduced to an operating agency level, losing its major command status, and was incorporated within the framework of the new Air Research and Development Command (ARDC), which had been established in September 1950 as a major command devoted to R&amp;D. Kirtland AFB became an ARDC facility on 1 April 1952. SWC was re-designated the Air Force Special Weapons Center (AFSWC). Also at this time, the responsibility for biological and chemical research and testing—which had been established at Kirtland during the tenure of SWC—was transferred to Eglin AFB, Edwards AFB, and Holloman AFB. Kirtland then maintained an administrative role over those programs, presumably through the AFSWC.

AFSWC became one of the distinct R&amp;D centers within the ARDC. Its principal task was the proper marriage of aircraft and weapons: the best combinations of aircraft/weaponry were to be analyzed, designed, developed, and tested. The AFSWC was to conduct this development and test work in conjunction with the AEC, Sandia Laboratory, LASL, and the FC/AFSWP at Sandia Base.

In short, LASL would build the &quot;physics package&quot; of a new weapon. This included the high explosive, the physical nuclear material, and the package. Sandia Laboratory would put the weapon in a case and install firing, fusing, timing, and safety systems, the electromechanical element. The AFSWC would track all of this new development for USAF use and drop test the new weapon designs. The AFSWC was also required to monitor the development work of aircraft contractors to assure compatibility of plane and bomb. Lastly, it provided support concerning special weapons to other USAF commands and support for full-scale atmospheric testing, as had the SWC.

By September 1956, AFSWC included a group with three squadrons trained in the testing of atomic weapons (the atom bomb) and a group trained in testing thermonuclear weapons (the hydrogen bomb). AFSWC was organized into the following units:
* Research Directorate
* Development Directorate
* 4900th Air Base Group
* 4925th Test Group (Atomic)
* 4950th Test Group (Nuclear)

AFSWC&#x27;s Research Directorate became a focal point for USAF research in nuclear matters and advanced weaponry. Its mission was to &quot;conduct applied research in the fields of nuclear weapons analysis, requirements and development, and to advise Air Force Special Weapons Center staff on nuclear research matters&quot;. In 1953 the Research Directorate began a weapons data-indexing project and maintained a technical library for all data on USAF contributions to the atomic energy program. The Research Directorate essentially led the charge in USAF efforts to conduct special weapons testing for weapons survivability and vulnerability. It also provided the groundwork for USAF interest in directed energy and weapons.

The Research Directorate also conducted numerous studies on the hazards of neutron and gamma radiation exposure for aircraft crews both in the air and on the ground. For example, directorate scientists accompanied AFSWC&#x27;s 4926th Test Squadron (Sampling) during nuclear cloud samplings taken at atmospheric tests in the Pacific and in Nevada.

The Development Directorate&#x27;s mission was to study, research, and develop nuclear weapons, weapons systems, components, and associated equipment for the USAF. In the early 1950s, the Development Directorate conducted numerous nuclear weapons studies focusing on specific target effectiveness and detonation conditions of atomic weapons. The Development Directorate was the AFSWC division working in conjunction with LASL and Sandia Laboratory as new bomb designs were developed. In terms of the stockpile-to-target sequence, the Directorate conducted R&amp;D on techniques for suspension and release of the bombs created by Sandia Laboratory, retardation devices and lay-down delivery of the bombs, as well as monitoring their designs for USAF requirements.

In the mid-1950s, the AFSWC&#x27;s Development Directorate began work on atomic warhead installations in guided missile weapons and the development of warhead support equipment. In January 1955, Douglas Aircraft Company was awarded the development contract for the weapon that became known as the Genie. The Genie was an air-to-air, unguided nuclear-tipped rocket that was designed for arming in the air moments before it was fired. The nuclear warhead of the Genie was a W-25 with a yield of approximately two kilotons. It was the only nuclear rocket to actually be launched and detonated from an aircraft, which took place at 20,000 feet over the Nevada Test Site on 19 July 1957. The original Genie was referred to as the MB-1 and later redesignated the AIR-2A; the carrier aircraft included the F-89J Scorpion, F-101B Voodoo, and F-106A Delta Dart. Other aerodynamic missiles developed at the Development Directorate were the SM-62 Snark, SM-64 Navaho, CIM-10 Bomarc and MGM-1 Matador.

The atmospheric tests conducted throughout the 1950s were critical to the definition of nuclear weapons effects for the design of survivable U.S. offensive and defensive weapons systems. Conducted under the auspices of the AEC, each test series was directed by a Joint Task Force appointed by the JCS. In early nuclear test series, the USAF assembled one Air Task Group per test to perform air support and missions. The frequency of tests and these issues justified a permanent group, and the USAF looked to AFSWC to fill the requirements. In response, in 1956 AFSWC established the 4950th Test Group (Nuclear) to serve as a permanent USAF Air Task Group for atmospheric testing, replacing the 4925th Test Group (Atomic), which then focused on the aircraft/weapon marriage mission.

In 1958, efforts were underway between the United States and Soviet Union to agree on a moratorium for atmospheric nuclear testing. The anticipated limitations on determining weapons effects inspired efforts by the Special Weapons Center and Sandia Corporation to develop methods of simulating nuclear effects with non-nuclear techniques. In 1962, Kirtland AFB and Sandia personnel participated in Operation Dominic, a series of atmospheric and subsurface tests in the Pacific. They were the last such tests conducted before the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed with the Soviet Union in late 1962, prohibiting testing in the atmosphere, in space and under water.

In April 1961, the Air Research and Development Command was redesignated the Air Force Systems Command (AFSC). The new command was given the weapons procurement and production functions of ARDC&#x27;s longtime rival Air Materiel Command, which effectively ended the ten years of contention between the ARDC and AMC. With the disestablishment of ARDC in 1961, AFSC took command of Kirtland and AFSWC. The replacement of ARDC with AFSC resulted in significant changes for AFSWC, but there were many adjustments that did not result solely from the change in command. AFSWC&#x27;s primary role as &quot;the AEC’s Air Force&quot;—the primary USAF flight support for atmospheric testing—was no longer a military priority by the early 1960s owing to the 1958 moratorium on atmospheric testing.

As the phase-down of testing activities continued during the moratorium, in August 1961 the 4950th Test Group (Nuclear) and 4925th Test Group (Atomic) were disestablished. Also during this moratorium period most of the missions of the AFSWC&#x27;s 4926th Test Squadron (Sampling) consisted of U.S. Weather Bureau projects. On 16 August 1961 the 4926th Test Squadron (Sampling) was placed under HQ, 9th Weather Reconnaissance Group, Air Weather Service of the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), since MATS also used the RB-57D Canberra aircraft and could easily add the unit to their inventory (Jones et al. 1976). The new unit designation was the 1211th Test Squadron (Sampling). Although the unit was no longer under AFSC, it remained based out of Kirtland.

Shortly after the testing groups were disestablished, the testing ban was lifted briefly when the Soviet Union detonated a nuclear device in the atmosphere in September 1961. A flurry of full-scale U.S. test activity resulted during 1961 and 1962. These tests were part of the National Nuclear Test Readiness Program, which had been set up as a direct response to President John F. Kennedy’s Safeguard C, which required readiness to promptly resume atmospheric testing should the need arise. Atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons finally ended with the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty.

====Atmospheric sampling====

On 16 June 1963, also after the Limited Test Ban Treaty, the 1211th Test Squadron was inactivated, and its assets were re-designated as the 58th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, and the unit activated on 1 February 1964. The new designation created no change in unit mission, although the squadron then emerged into the &quot;Age of the F Troop&quot; . The &quot;F&quot; was from the assignment of the RB-57F Canberra to the squadron. According to the official history of the &quot;F Troop 58th Weather Squadron,&quot; the RB-57F proved itself to be an aircraft gifted with the capabilities of exceptional payload, high altitude, long-range performance, and extended loiter time, all of which were useful for taking air samples.

This monitoring activity was directly related to Kennedy&#x27;s LTBT safeguards: to monitor testing by other nations. An ongoing assignment of the 58th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron was observation for evidence of Soviet Union and Communist Chinese nuclear tests, a direct response to Safeguard D. For example, the 58th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron flew back and forth to Argentina during 1965 for its top secret &quot;Quick Dip&quot; program. Quick Dip involved biweekly flights of two RB-57Fs to El Plumerillo Airport in Mendoza, Argentina, for periods of four to five days. During each period, five to six air samplings were to be taken to estimate the amount of plutonium being produced by the Soviets.

In 1968 the Air Weather Service&#x27;s RB-57Fs were redesignated WB-57Fs, and they continued to be used in the atmospheric sampling role, mostly on behalf of the AEC. Some of the aircraft were fitted with probes to scoop up airborne particles in a program of ongoing monitoring of nuclear tests. Most of this activity was centered on the nuclear tests carried out in Communist China, but some of it was used in U.S. air space to monitor air in the aftermath of underground nuclear tests.

The 58th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron was the last squadron in the USAF to use the WB-57F; in the spring of 1972, the decision was made to transfer 12 F-Troop aircraft, WB-57Fs and WB-57Cs, to Davis-Monthan AFB in Arizona for storage at the Military Aircraft Storage and Disposition Center. By the summer of 1973 there were rumors of squadron reductions, and inactivation of the squadron was announced officially in March 1974 as a result of the continual downsizing since the 1958 moratorium.

====Missile development====
Throughout the remainder of the 1960s, the AFSWC worked closely with the Air Force Missile Development Center at Holloman AFB. The AFSWC&#x27;s responsibilities at this time included the testing and evaluation of airborne missiles, aircraft reconnaissance systems, and missile reentry. Calling itself the &quot;Gateway to the White Sands Missile Range,&quot; the AFSWC sponsored all USAF programs at White Sands and an AFSWC office was located at White Sands Missile Range for day-to-day operations. The AFSWC provided flight test support from Kirtland, and mission control support and drone launch from the Air Force Missile Development Center at Holloman AFB.

By the mid-1970s, missile development support within the AFSWC reached a plateau—with advanced missiles work entirely focused through the AFSC&#x27;s Space and Missile Systems Organization (SAMSO) at Los Angeles Air Force Station. SAMSO was a precursor to today&#x27;s
Space and Missile Systems Center at what is now known as Los Angeles Air Force Base. By September 1974 the function of the AFSWC had become largely obsolete, and in 1976 the center was officially disestablished by the AFSC.

====Air Force Weapons Laboratory====

In the wake of the full-scale tests and signing of the test ban treaty, the Air Force Weapons Laboratory (AFWL) was created from elements of the Special Weapons Center. The AFWL was responsible for researching nuclear weapons and the vulnerability of U.S. weapons systems to nuclear attack. Because atmospheric testing had been prohibited in 1963, weapons vulnerability testing now focused on nuclear weapons effects simulations. AFWL&#x27;s original mission was to explore the military uses of nuclear power, weapons, and support equipment, and to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. systems to nuclear weapons effects. This involved studying nuclear weapons effects through testing, ensuring the compatibility of nuclear weapons with USAF delivery systems, providing advanced nuclear weapons delivery techniques, and investigating nuclear power concepts.

Throughout the 1960s, AFWL scientists built facilities to simulate nuclear effects such as transient radiation, x-rays and electromagnetic pulse. For example, in 1965, AFWL&#x27;s Civil Engineering Research Branch began studies using conventional high explosives to simulate a nuclear blast to test the hardness or survivability of underground missile silos and command centers. The Weapons Laboratory built facilities during the 1960s to simulate nuclear effects such as transient radiation, x-rays and electromagnetic pulse. To study the latter, the ATLAS-I (better known as TRESTLE), the largest simulation facility ever built, was completed on the east side of Kirtland AFB during the late 1970s.

AFWL also made important contributions throughout the decade to improve the nuclear systems related to such aircraft as the F-4 Phantom II, F-105 Thunderchief, F-111, and the B-58 Hustler. The weapons systems corresponding to these aircraft included the air-to-ground missiles (AGM) AGM-28 Hound Dog, AGM-69 SRAM &quot;Short-Range Attack Missile,&quot; as well as the LGM-25C Titan II and LGM-30 Minuteman ICBMs, and the LIM-49 Spartan ABM.

On 1 July 1971, Kirtland merged with Sandia Base and Manzano Base, its neighbors to the east. Twelve months after the merger, Kirtland AFB became home to one of the country&#x27;s most important industrial management units when the Air Force Contract Management Division (a component of Air Force Systems Command) moved to the base from Los Angeles. Early in 1974, at the direction of the Air Force Chief of Staff, the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center was organized at Kirtland to direct and oversee operational testing of aircraft and other equipment.

====Laser technology====


Laser R&amp;D became a mission for AFWL during the 1960s and was its main focus into the 1970s. The military began to view lasers as potentially superior to conventional weapons because of lasers’ intensity over great distances and envisioned developing them for ballistic missile defense, as well as anti-satellite and anti-aircraft missions. In 1968, the USAF authorized the AFWL to design, build, and fire a GDL capable of engaging targets that were static or in motion. The Advanced Radiation Technology Office at AFWL built its TSL at SOR in 1971, naming it the Air Force Laser (AFL). Mating of the AFL and Field Test Telescope (FTT)—the first step toward shooting down an aerial target with a laser—took place in October 1972. The successful mating of the AFL and FTT in 1972 was a milestone in the USAF high-energy laser research. That same year, AFSC assigned responsibility for the USAF&#x27;s portion of the DoD&#x27;s high-energy laser program to AFWL. AFWL scientists were determined to use the AFL to shoot down a drone aircraft. A year later, in November 1973, the AFWL met the three milestones and succeeded in the first shoot down of an aerial target by a laser.

While a ground laser could track and engage a moving target, an airborne laser had the added difficulties of vibrations, beam propagation, and pointing a laser from an aerial platform. Development of the Airborne Laser Laboratory (ALL) became the centerpiece of AFWL&#x27;s laser program in the 1970s. The ALL term was coined in 1972, and the ALL program began with Cycle I testing in 1973 and ended with the completion of Cycle III in September 1983. The ALL was a modified NKC-135, and the 4900th Flight Test Group was formed for aircraft operations. Laboratory testing occurred in the 400 area of Kirtland AFB and initial ground tests in hangar 1001, while the hangar at the Advanced Radiation Test Facility (ARTF) at the southeast corner of the runway was being constructed. ARTF was used for later ground tests that aimed the APT from the ARTF test pad to a target in the atmosphere in order to calibrate aircraft instruments in preparation for flight tests. Along with the five NKC-135, the 4900th FTG operated a fleet of five F-4Ds, one RF-4C, three NC-135As, five C-130s, and several A-37s, F-100s, and helicopters.

These flights tests took place from January to July 1975, with the first &quot;good&quot; beam generation occurring in March. Testing ended in 1976, and although the airborne tests demonstrated the need to upgrade the tracker, the optical quality of the mirrors, and the stabilization of the APT, they clearly proved that a laser could be accurately pointed in an airborne environment. After 1977, work continued on the ALL, which would reach its goal in 1983.

In 1979, AFWL achieved a milestone in the development of airborne high-energy laser weapons. The High Energy Laser Radar Acquisition and Tracking System (HELRATS) was designed specifically to track enemy aircraft and missiles. Installed at North Oscura Peak on the White Sands Missile Range between May and November 1979, HELRATS underwent extensive testing against aircraft and missiles. These tests were critically important steps to developing the DoD&#x27;s high-energy laser program. Range tests took place from May to December 1979. The most successful of the tests was one that shot an AIM-9B downrange; the beam in the test cell delivered and locked onto the aim point on the missile dome, causing damage to the dome, guidance, and seeker unit inside the AIM-9B. This test demonstrated that the ALL systems could work as a unit and disable a target.

In July 1980 a &quot;hot firing&quot; test of the system was made being the first airborne test of the system. The flight took place near WSMR at 10,000 feet. A series of airborne systems tests were then made prior to extracting a beam from the ALL. In January 1981 a high-energy laser beam was generated inside the ALL, directed through the APT, and propagated in the air outside the aircraft; this was the first demonstration that the ALL components could work as a unified system and point to a target. The highlight of the ALL program occurred in May 1983, over the Naval Weapons Center Range at China Lake, California, where the laser was combined with a sophisticated pointer and tracker to negate, or disable, five AIM-9 &quot;Sidewinder&quot; missiles. While the missiles did not fall from the sky in pieces, they were disabled to the point that they could no longer locate, track, and strike their target.

Despite its success, weapons planners ignored the ALL because its missions had been categorized as &quot;proof of concept&quot; rather than demonstrations of a viable war tool. The ALL aircraft was retired in 1984 and stored in hangar 760 at Kirtland. Four years later it took its final flight to Wright Patterson AFB, where it is now on display at the United States Air Force Museum. About a decade later, after the Gulf War, the concept of an anti-missile laser was revitalized in the Boeing YAL-1 airborne laser program.

====Air Force Test and Evaluation Center====
In 1974, the Air Force Test and Evaluation Center (AFTEC) was organized at KAFB &quot;to direct and oversee operational testing of emerging Air Force aircraft and systems&quot;. The purpose of AFTEC was to answer questions about how safe, effective, reliable, maintainable, compatible, and logistically supportable new USAF systems would be for acquisition purposes. The F-16 Falcon fighter and the BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missile were among the weapons the center tested in the 1970s, and the Kirtland Base Information Resources and Economic Impact statement of FY 1984 reported that AFTEC was then &quot;evaluating more than 90 major systems. Among them are the Peacemaker missile, the HH-60 helicopter, a new version of the F-15 advanced medium range air-to-air missile, the Maverick air-to-ground missile, TRI-TAC
multiservice communication system and the B-1 bomber&quot;.

Due to budget restrictions and reorganization, the Special Weapons Center was disestablished during 1976. Its responsibilities as Kirtland AFB&#x27;s landlord’ were transferred to Contract Management Division, and a new support organization, the 4900th Air Base Wing, was created to discharge those responsibilities.

====1550th Combat Crew Training Wing====

In 1976, as these organizational changes were being made, the Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service moved its 1550th Aircrew Training and Test Wing (later becoming the 1550th Combat Crew Training Wing) to Kirtland AFB from Hill AFB, Utah. That unit&#x27;s helicopter and fixed wing training brought regular flight operations to Kirtland in addition to the usual support provided for transient military aircraft. The 1550th ATTW was responsible for all USAF advanced helicopter training. The unit also conducted fixed-wing rescue and recovery training in the HC-130 Hercules aircraft, as well as testing new helicopter systems and techniques.

On 1 July 1977, the base once again changed hands as the 1606th Air Base Wing was created when Military Airlift Command (MAC) took over responsibility for operating Kirtland AFB from Air Force Systems Command.

In the mid-1980s, the wing was equipped with a fleet of 32 aircraft, which included five HC-130 rescue transports, eight H-3 and seven H-53 heavy lift helicopters or &quot;Jolly Green Giants,&quot; and six UH-1F and six UH-1N light lift helicopters or &quot;Hueys.&quot; Flying training in the 1550th ATTW included basic aircraft qualifications, instrument and transition flying, aerial refueling of the Jolly Green Giant helicopters by HC-130 tankers, combat tactics, air drops of pararescue personnel and equipment, land-water helicopter hoist training, simulated search missions, and locating and intercepting lost or distressed aircraft. Initial training for all USAF Pararescuemen was also given at Kirtland. The training included classes in mountain climbing, survival, navigation, scuba-equipped parachute jumps, hoisting from a helicopter, emergency medicine, combat tactics, and weapons. In 1985, the wing graduated approximately 1,250 students from its 34 formal courses.

====Air Force Space Technology Center====
On 1 October 1982, the Air Force Space Technology Center (AFSTC) was established at Kirtland to coordinate and manage research into Air Force space systems. It was to plan and execute &quot;Air Force R&amp;D programs in space technology, advanced nonconventional weapons and weapons effects, rocket propulsion and geophysics&quot;. The AFSTC operated under the oversight of the Space Systems Division of Air Force Systems Command (AFSC), located at Los Angeles AFB. The AFSTC supervised the AFWL, the Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory at Edwards AFB, California, and the Air Force Geophysics Laboratory at Hanscom AFB, Massachusetts. The announcement for the new center was made two days after Secretary of State Alexander Haig revealed that the Soviet Union had made practice runs with several space weapons, including one that could destroy U.S. satellites. The new AFSTC was responsible for military satellites, the anti-satellite program, military payloads orbited by Space Shuttles, the tracking of Soviet satellites, and other related programs.

The militarily strategic value of space became a new focus for AFWL in the early 1980s. In March 1983, President Ronald Reagan announced a major research effort to determine the feasibility of advanced defenses against ballistic missiles. In the mid-1980s, AFWL made
important contributions to the SDI program through its studies of the laser vulnerability of solid and liquid-fueled ICBM boosters. AFWL used the mid-infrared advanced chemical laser (MIRACL) to demonstrate such vulnerabilities, and successful MIRACL tests destroyed both stationary and rotating reflective targets. By fiscal year 1986, Reagan&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) accounted for more than 60 percent of AFWL&#x27;s budget.

AFWL carried out tests of its Booster Vulnerability Test Program. In these tests scientists used MIRACL to destroy a decommissioned Titan I second stage booster under simulated flight loads at White Sands Missile Range, and the derived data were used to determine the vulnerabilities of representative solid motor cases and liquid boosters to lasers. In December 1990, the Air Force Space Technology Center and Weapons Laboratory consolidated to become Phillips Laboratory, and later, the Air Force Research Laboratory.

On 1 October 1991, the 1606th Air Base Wing and 1550th Combat Crew Training Wing merged into one &quot;super&quot; wing called the 542d Crew Training Wing.

===Modern era===

In 1992, the Kirtland Underground Munitions Maintenance and Storage Complex (KUMMSC) was activated at Kirtland AFB. The facility provides storage, shipping and maintenance for the United States Air Force. It is operated by the 898th Munitions Squadron (898 MUNS) and the 377th Weapons Systems Security Squadron (377 WSSS). The facility is state of the art, with more than located entirely underground. KUMMSC is the largest storage facility for nuclear weapons in the world. Total number of deliverable nuclear warheads stored there is over 3,000. The majority of the munitions include the B83 and B61 gravity bombs, and W80, W78, and W87 warheads for the Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), Minuteman III and Peacekeeper ICBMs.

On 1 January 1993, the base again changed hands as the newly formed Air Force Materiel Command acquired Kirtland AFB from Air Mobility Command. The 377th Air Base Wing was reactivated to become the base&#x27;s host organization.

On 1 April 1994 the 1550th Combat Crew Training Wing was re-designated as the 58th Special Operations Wing under Air Education and Training Command (AETC). In addition to the helicopter training, it also trained crews in special operations aircraft, including helicopters and modified C-130 Hercules aircraft. It performed pararescue training and search and rescue missions as well. Additionally, the wing trained for missile site support and airlift for distinguished visitors. At the same time the wing continued to deploy personnel worldwide for contingency and combat operations. The wing airlifted a federal task force to Pennsylvania to investigate the crash site of the fourth airliner following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. Since that time the 58th has deployed personnel and equipment to support Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Today, the 58th SOW trains aircrews in the MC-130J Commando II, MC-130H Combat Talon II, and the CV-22 Osprey for the Air Force Special Operations Command; the HC-130P Combat King, HC-130J Combat King II, and the HH-60G Pavehawk for the Air Combat Command and Pacific Air Forces; the UH-1 Huey for Air Force Space Command; and those aircrew operationally gained to those commands from the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard.

On 31 March 2006, the Nuclear Weapons Center was created and became the parent organization at Kirtland AFB. The 498th Armament Systems Wing (later the 498th Nuclear Systems Wing) was also created to be the maintenance arm of the NWC, while the 377th ABW remained the host support unit on base. On 1 October 2015, Kirtland AFB was repositioned under Air Force Global Strike Command.

In November 2009 the 377th Air Base Wing, commanded by Colonel Michael S. Duvall, and 498th Nuclear Systems Wing, commanded by Colonel Richard M. Stuckey, failed their nuclear security inspections. The inspections were conducted by Air Force Materiel Command and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

On 27 January 2010 the 898th Munitions Squadron was decertified. The action meant that the squadron could no longer perform its mission of safeguarding the weapons at the Kirtland Underground Munitions Maintenance and Storage Complex until it passed a nuclear surety inspection. The squadron was recertified on 11 June 2010.

The 498 Nuclear Systems Wing was inactivated on 27 Jan 2012 as the Air Force transferred oversight of the nuclear munitions to the Air Force Global Strike Command. Two years later, in December 2014, the Air Force declared its intentions to &quot;realign the 377th Air Base Wing under Air Force Global Strike Command and to restructure the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center to improve the effectiveness of and support for the Air Force&#x27;s Nuclear Enterprise.&quot;

==Environmental contamination due to jet fuel spill==
A jet fuel leak was discovered at Kirtland Air Force Base in 1999. Suspected to have been leaking undetected for decades, an estimated 6 to 24 million gallons of fuel saturated the soil, posing a serious hazard to wells in the south valley connected to the municipal water supply.

Air Force Manual 85-16 required annual and five-year inspections of the Bulk Fuels Facility. The inspections were not performed for three decades. In 1985, a waiver was issued to not perform pipeline pressure testing. In 1992, leaking was discovered at the fuels facility pump house Bldg. 1033. In 1994, two waivers were issued: one for the annual pipeline testing and another for pressure testing. In 1999, another jet fuel leak was discovered from a broken 16-inch pipe. It was later learned that the pipe had been leaking fuel undetected since 1953. The Air Force initially estimated that pipe leaked roughly between of jet fuel in that 46-year span. However, state environmental officials believe the number may be as high as , which could make the spill more than twice the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska. In 2007, 18 inches of fuel floated over the water table when a well was dug.

The escaped jet fuel is submerged 500 ft beneath the ground in the drinking water aquifer. As of 2010, a 6000 ft long plume of contaminants, the most dangerous chemical being ethylene dibromide (EDB), moved within 4000 ft towards the municipal wells that supply the city&#x27;s drinking water. EDB negatively impacts the liver and kidneys and is a suspected human carcinogen.

In June 2014, the board of directors of Albuquerque&#x27;s municipal water utility approved a resolution that &quot;any amount of ethylene dibromide, no matter how small, would be cause to shut down the affected well&quot;. It also called for the Air Force &quot;to move more quickly in cleaning up the spill&quot;, as the slow progress has frustrated members of the community. The contaminated water plume could reach the nearest drinking water well in between five and 40 years, according to 2014 estimates.

However, as of January 2020, there had been no incidents of drinking water contamination, and no threats of future contamination.

===Remediation===
Several interim measures have already been completed including the removal of approximately 5000 tons of contaminated soil near the source of the leak and the removal of the equivalent of approximately 775,000 gallons of fuel through a combination of soil vapor extraction and bioslurping. In addition, the Air Force replaced the decades-old bulk fueling facility with a state-of-the-art fueling facility.

To mitigate any potential threats to the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority Ridgecrest drinking water supply wells the Air Force implemented a groundwater pump and treat interim measure to collapse and treat the dissolved-phase ethylene dibromide (EDB) plume in the Target Capture Zone north of Ridgecrest Drive. This interim measure consists of four extraction wells and a groundwater treatment plant, which uses granular activated carbon to remove the EDB. As of January 2020, approximately 800 million gallons of groundwater have been successfully treated and approximately 91% of the EDB mass (approximately 122 grams) in the Target Capture Zone has been removed.

<doc id="744379" wikidata="Q6643331" url="?curid=744379" title="List of three-letter broadcast call signs in the United States">
<text>This is a list of radio and television broadcasting stations in the United States that are currently assigned three-letter call signs.

==Overview==

In the United States, all radio and television broadcasting stations that are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are assigned official, distinct call signs. Organized broadcasting began in the U.S. in the early 1920s on the AM band — FM and television did not exist yet. Initially most broadcasting stations were assigned three-letter calls; however, a switch was made in April 1922 to primarily four-letter calls, after the number of stations had increased into the hundreds. For a few years thereafter a small number of new three-letter calls continued to be issued. Although most of the original three-letter calls were randomly assigned, these later calls were often specially requested to match station slogans. The last new three-letter call was assigned to station WIS (now WVOC) in Columbia, South Carolina on January 23, 1930. Since then, three-letter calls have only been assigned to stations, including FM (beginning in 1943) and TV (beginning in 1946), which are historically related to an AM station that was originally issued that call sign.

This review only includes FCC-licensed stations. Not included are unlicensed operations, such as carrier current, cable TV, and Internet stations — for example, San Diego State University&#x27;s &quot;KCR&quot; — which have adopted call-letter-like identifiers that are not officially issued by the FCC. Also not included are stations which use, as slogans, three-letter truncations of their official four-letter call signs; for example, the full call sign for radio station &quot;KOH&quot; in Reno, Nevada is actually KKOH, and &quot;WTN&quot; in Nashville, Tennessee is actually WWTN. In addition, stations which formerly had three letters but have since changed (such as Albuquerque, New Mexico&#x27;s KKOB, formerly KOB) are not listed.

As of January 2025, there are a total of 101 AM, FM and TV stations in the United States that are assigned three-letter call signs. This is divided between only 67 different three-letter calls, because in many cases the same call sign is used by more than one station, although a given call sign is never assigned to more than one AM, FM or TV station. These 67 different three-letter call signs are currently grouped as follows:

*25 assigned only to an AM station
*8 assigned only to an FM station
*7 assigned only to a TV station
*13 assigned to both an AM and an FM station
*7 assigned to both an AM and a TV station
*7 assigned to an AM, FM, and TV station

==Assignments==

Listed below are all the assignments as of January 2025:

===AM radio (52 stations)===
===FM radio (28 stations)===
In cases where an AM station exists with the same &quot;base&quot; call letters as an FM station, the FM station is required to include an &quot;-FM&quot; suffix as part of its call sign. If no AM station is currently using the same base call sign, then the &quot;-FM&quot; suffix is optional.
===Television (21 stations)===
As with FM stations, if an AM station currently exists with the same &quot;base&quot; call, a TV station must include a suffix to differentiate itself, but this suffix is optional if no AM station currently exists. TV stations may select either &quot;-TV&quot; or &quot;-DT&quot; as their suffix.
==Other stations of note==

*WWV - Fort Collins, Colorado — shortwave time signal data radio clock service operated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
*KPH - Bolinas, California — shortwave morse code data service operated by radiomarine.org under the auspices of the National Park Service

<text>Christopher Jacob Boström (1 January 1797 in Piteå, Norrbotten – 22 March 1866 in Uppsala) was a Swedish philosopher. His ideas dominated Swedish philosophy until the beginning of the twentieth century. He also had a great influence on Swedish cultural life.

==Biography==
As a student he briefly studied theology, and religion remained his primary interest throughout his life. During his theological studies, he was a classmate of Lutheran revivalist preacher Pehr Brandell.

Most of his life was spent teaching at Uppsala University, where he received the appointment in 1838 of adjunct professor of philosophy and from 1840–63 was professor of practical philosophy. He was the teacher and mentor of Johan Jakob Borelius. For four years, he tutored the royal family in Stockholm. There he was charged with the education of the crown prince, later Oscar II of Sweden.

==Philosophy==

According to Richard Falckenberg, he was &quot;the most important systematic thinker of his country.&quot; His philosophy, that of &quot;rational idealism&quot; as he termed it, exercised great influence in Sweden.

Reality is presented only as spiritual: God as an absolute, self-conscious unity, in which all living beings are eternally and unchangeably contained, according to degree. The highest aim of humanity should be the conduct and behavior according to reason in harmony with the Divine; that of the state, like the individual should exist solely in God, and in its most perfect form should consist in the harmonious obedience of all its members to a constitutional monarch; while ultimate perfection should be an all-embracing system of such states governed in obedience to Universal Reason.

According to the philosophy of Boström, true philosophy is such knowledge or awareness that is complete with respect to form, content and extent, and thus identical to God&#x27;s own omniscience. Philosophy insofar as human beings can attain it, however, is identical to human awareness, insofar as it partakes of this divine omniscience: it is man&#x27;s fully clear and distinct (formally perfect) awareness of true, absolute divine reality. The first task of philosophical science must be to produce the most general concepts whereby to define absolute reality. The character of Boström&#x27;s philosophy depends on the manner in which he solved this task.

Personally, Boström characterizes his philosophy as the consistent execution of the principle of rational idealism—i.e., the principle of that &quot;världsåsikt&quot; (worldview or metaphysics) according to which absolute reality is free from all the imperfections of spatiotemporal existence (finitude, divisibility, transience, change). As such, it is spiritual, eternal and, in and through its own non-sensual content, and not through shifting and imperfect determinations, completely determined or completely real.

Boström claims Plato as the source of these metaphysical presuppositions. Boström interprets Plato as having conceived a limited precursor of his own philosophy, constricted by his Paganism. In Plato, the ideas constitute the absolute, whereas Boström stresses the need to move beyond the ideas to that being whose sensations they are. Boström takes himself to show that all spiritual reality necessarily refers to self-consciousness as its principle, and he maintains that true reality is personal and hence that philosophy is the science of personal beings as such, since some such thing as pure self-consciousness only exists in the abstract, whereas everything real is individual or fully determined self-consciousness (consciousness of something), or in other words, sensational being or person. Philosophy can deal with an impressional reality only insofar as this reality is conceived as a determination (sensation) for a personal being and is explained through it.

With respect to the various ways in which these beings are conceived as existing for men and determining their activities, Boström divides philosophy into theoretical philosophy, the science of these beings conceived as determining man&#x27;s theoretical faculty, i.e., conceived as in every respect true and original being; and practical philosophy, the science of these beings conceived as determining the practical faculty, or will, of man, i.e., conceived as that which unconditionally and under all circumstances ought to be. According to the different kinds of personal beings that are known to us, theoretical philosophy is further divided into speculative theology, speculative ethnology and speculative anthropology; practical philosophy into philosophy of religion, philosophy of law and ethics, corresponding to the terms of the division of theoretical philosophy

===Theoretical philosophy===

====Speculative theology====
In speculative theology, the science of the absolute person, or God, Boström gives a more detailed justification of the principle of his system. There, it is first of all maintained that independent reality necessarily must be spiritual (or, as we would say today, mental), and as such an independent consciousness or self-consciousness. This is the only thing that is simple. Since the complex presupposes the simple, self-consciousness must also be the ultimate principle of all reality. This self-consciousness — which Boström identifies with life—can thus not be conceived as attached to a substrate or a substance, but is precisely what is primary and original in everything.

Boström further accounts for the factors that constitute individual self-consciousness or the person. I contrast to the Hegelian notion of an original abstract, empty self-consciousness which, through sensible reality, actualizes itself into a fully conscious and determined (concrete) spirit, Boström maintains that the absolute person is primordial and eternally fully determined. It has its sensations fully present to itself, and does not require for its perfect determination an imperfect world. There exists no exclusion or contradiction among the sensations or ideas of God, but there is complete accord among them, so that it is impossible to conceive perfectly either of God or of any of His ideas without also conceiving the others perfectly. Boström has thereby shown that absolute reality is an absolute system, a spiritual organism in the strongest sense of the term.

Since in every organism, the organs must possess the character of the whole, it follows that God&#x27;s ideas are also personal or perceiving beings. Although these beings in and for God, &quot;qua&quot; his organs, are absolutely perfect, in and for themselves, &quot;qua&quot; perceiving beings, they possess a certain imperfection, precisely since they do not have their true life and self-consciousness in themselves, but in God. Therefore, true reality, God&#x27;s reality without which nothing exists, is presented to them in a lower form, as a world of phenomena specific to each and every one of them. Conceived with respect to these beings, God is on the one hand more than all of them put together or some aspect or attribute common to all of them; he is an independent and fully concrete being. On the other hand, He is also — due to the perfect organic coherence that obtains in the absolute world — fully present in them, without in the least obstructing their independent life. Thereby, the contradiction between finite and infinite is resolved.

The infinite is present in the finite, while fully preserving its infinitude (and thus not through any &quot;anderssein&quot; or similar). God is simultaneously transcendent and an immanent ground for the finite world, and in so far as this world, &quot;qua&quot; finite, is undergoing a developmental process, he is the foundation, law and endpoint of this development, the creator and maintainer of the finite world, its providence and salvation. In relation to this, Boström develops a teodicé where he teaches that all imperfection and all evil depends entirely on finite beings, whereas God, as a perfect being, cannot be the ground of anything but the eternal life and salvation of these lesser beings.

==Works==
His major work was &quot;Philosophy of Religion&quot;.
His writings, comparatively few in number, edited by Edfelt, were published at Upsala in 1883.

==Family==
He was the paternal uncle of Erik Gustaf Boström.

<text>Ivan Nikolayevich Durnovo (, the patronymic is also transcribed as Nikolaevich; – ) was a Russian politician. He served as Chairman of the Committee of Ministers between 1895 and 1903, the precursor to the post of prime minister.

== Biography ==
Ivan Nikolaevich Durnovo was born on 1 (13) March 1834 in Chernigov Governorate (which was located mostly within northeastern Ukraine and Russia&#x27;s Bryansk Oblast) to the noble Durnovo family. He attended Prince Michael Artillery Academy () in Saint Petersburg.

After a brief time in the military, he returned to civilian life and was elected by the nobility of his uyezd (district) to the position of the Marshal of Nobility. Later he occupied a similar position for the entire Chernigov Governorate. He served as the governor of Chernigov Governorate (1863–1870) and Yekaterinoslav Governorate (1870–1882). From 1882 he was in Saint Petersburg, starting as a Deputy Minister of Interior (1882–1886).

Although not a capable statesman, he was a good communicator, capable to earn trust of his superiors. Count Sergei Witte described him as &quot;a pleasant Marshal of Nobility, a pleasant governor, a pleasant Deputy Minister of the Interior. But he was not a cultured or intelligent person; rather, one rather limited in his abilities. A hospitable, polite, and very cunning man.&quot;

On the Empress&#x27;s recommendation, in 1886 Durnovo was appointed the chair of the Fourth Section of His Imperial Majesty&#x27;s Own Chancellery, the office responsible for charitable institution and health care. 
In 1889, after the death of the Minister of Interior Dmitry Tolstoy, Durnovo was appointed to replace him.

In social policy, Durnovo&#x27;s tenure in office saw a reduction of working hours in 1897. Durnovo was not known, however, for his innovations, but rather for following his predecessor&#x27;s policies. His abilities were summarized by his staff in a pun, &quot;Не нашли хорошего, назначили Дурново&quot; (They could not find a good minister, so they have appointed a bad [&quot;durnogo&quot; = &quot;Durnovo&quot;] one!&quot;).
Durnovo was blamed by later researchers for failing to take decisive actions to handle the Russian famine of 1891–92.

In 1895, the next emperor, Nicholas II promoted Durnovo to the job of the Chairman of the Committee of Ministers. At the time, this was the top of the Russian bureaucratic ladder, as the separate position of the Prime Minister of Russia was not introduced until 1905. Durnovo was not to see that reform, though: he died on the job, on 29 May (11 June, in Gregorian Calendar) 1903, near Berlin. His leadership qualities, not entirely admired by his colleagues, earned him the nickname of &quot;Veal&#x27;s Head&quot; (In Russian: &quot;Телячья голова&quot;).

<text>The 2004 World Cup of Hockey was an international ice hockey tournament. It was the second installment of the National Hockey League (NHL)-sanctioned competition, eight years after the inaugural 1996 World Cup of Hockey. It was held from August 30 to September 14, 2004, and took place in various venues in North America and Europe. Canada won the championship, defeating Finland in the final, held in Toronto.

The tournament directly preceded the NHL lockout, as the NHL announced they were locking out players during 2004–05 season two days after the tournament final was played, pending the adoption of a new Collective Bargaining Agreement.

<text>Carl Van Vechten (June 17, 1880December 21, 1964) was an American writer and artistic photographer who was a patron of the Harlem Renaissance and the literary executor of Gertrude Stein. He gained fame as a writer, and notoriety as well, for his 1926 novel &quot;Nigger Heaven&quot;. In his later years, he took up photography and took many portraits of notable people. Although he was married to women for most of his adult years, Van Vechten engaged in numerous homosexual affairs over his lifetime.

==Life and career==
Born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, he was the youngest child of Charles Duane Van Vechten and Ada Amanda Van Vechten (née Fitch). Both of his parents were well educated. His father was a wealthy, prominent banker. His mother established the Cedar Rapids Public Library and had great musical talent. As a child, Van Vechten developed a passion for music and theatre. He graduated from Washington High School in 1898.

After high school, Van Vechten was eager to take the next steps in his life, but found it difficult to pursue his passions in Iowa. He described his hometown as &quot;that unloved town&quot;. To advance his education, he decided in 1899 to study at the University of Chicago, where he studied a variety of topics including music, art and opera. As a student, he became increasingly interested in writing and wrote for the college newspaper, the &quot;University of Chicago Weekly&quot;.

After graduating from college in 1903, Van Vechten accepted a job as a columnist for the &quot;Chicago American&quot;. In his column &quot;The Chaperone&quot;, Van Vechten covered many different topics through a style of semi-autobiographical gossip and criticism. During his time with the &quot;Chicago American&quot;, he was occasionally asked to include photographs with his column. This was the first time he is thought to have experimented with photography, which later became one of his greatest passions. Van Vechten was fired from his position with the &quot;Chicago American&quot; because of what was described as an elaborate and complicated style of writing. Some commentators jokingly described his contributions to the paper as &quot;lowering the tone&quot; of the lowbrow and sensationalist Hearst papers. In 1906, he moved to New York City. He was hired as the assistant music critic at &quot;The New York Times&quot;. His interest in opera had him take a leave of absence from the paper in 1907 to travel to Europe and explore opera.

While in England, he married Anna Snyder, his longtime friend from Cedar Rapids. He returned to his job at &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1909, where he became the first American critic of modern dance. Through the guidance of his mentor, Mabel Dodge Luhan, he became engrossed in the avant garde. He began to frequently attend groundbreaking musical premieres at the time when Isadora Duncan, Anna Pavlova, and Loie Fuller were performing in New York City. He also attended premieres in Paris where he met American author and poet Gertrude Stein in 1913. He became a devoted friend and champion of Stein and was considered to be one of Stein&#x27;s most enthusiastic fans. They continued corresponding for the remainder of Stein&#x27;s life, and, at her death, she appointed Van Vechten her literary executor; he helped to bring into print her unpublished writings. A collection of the letters between Van Vechten and Stein has been published.

Van Vechten wrote a piece called &quot;How to Read Gertrude Stein&quot; for the arts magazine &quot;The Trend&quot;. In his piece, Van Vechten attempted to demystify Stein and bring clarity to her works. Van Vechten came to the conclusion that Stein can be best understood when one has been guided through her work by an &quot;expert insider&quot;. He writes that &quot;special writers require special readers&quot;.

The marriage to Anna Snyder ended in divorce in 1912, and he wed actress Fania Marinoff in 1914. Van Vechten and Marinoff were known for ignoring the social separation of races during the times and for inviting black people to their home for social gatherings. They were also known to attend public gatherings for black people and to visit black friends in their homes.
Although Van Vechten&#x27;s marriage to Fania Marinoff lasted for 50 years, they often argued about Van Vechten&#x27;s affairs with men. Van Vechten kept a circle of handsome young men around him, including Donald Angus, Jimmie Daniels, Max Ewing, and Prentiss Taylor. Van Vechten was also known to have romantic and sexual relationships with men, especially Mark Lutz. Lutz (1901–1968) grew up in Richmond, Virginia, and was introduced to Van Vechten by Hunter Stagg in New York in 1931. Lutz was a model for some of Van Vechten&#x27;s earliest experiments with photography. The friendship lasted until Van Vechten&#x27;s death. At Lutz&#x27;s death, as per his wishes, the correspondence with Van Vechten, amounting to 10,000 letters, was destroyed. Lutz donated his collection of Van Vechten&#x27;s photographs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

Several books of Van Vechten&#x27;s essays on various subjects, such as music and literature, were published between 1915 and 1920, and Van Vechten also served as an informal scout for the newly formed Alfred A. Knopf. Between 1922 and 1930 Knopf published seven novels by him, starting with &quot;Peter Whiffle: His Life and Works&quot; and ending with &quot;Parties.&quot; His sexuality is most clearly reflected in his intensely homoerotic portraits of working-class men.

As an appreciator of the arts, Van Vechten was extremely intrigued by the explosion of creativity that was occurring in Harlem. He was drawn towards the tolerance of Harlem society and the excitement it generated among black writers and artists. He also felt most accepted there as a gay man. Van Vechten promoted many of the major figures of the Harlem Renaissance, including Paul Robeson, Langston Hughes, Ethel Waters, Richard Wright, Zora Neale Hurston and Wallace Thurman. Van Vechten&#x27;s controversial novel &quot;Nigger Heaven&quot; was published in 1926. His essay &quot;Negro Blues Singers&quot; was published in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in 1926. Biographer Edward White suggests Van Vechten was convinced that negro culture was the essence of America.
Van Vechten played a critical role in the Harlem Renaissance and helped to bring greater clarity to the African-American movement. However, for a long time he was also seen as a very controversial figure. In Van Vechten&#x27;s early writings, he claimed that black people were born to be entertainers and sexually &quot;free&quot;. In other words, he believed that black people should be free to explore their sexuality and singers should follow their natural talents such as jazz, spirituals and blues. Van Vechten wrote about his experiences of attending a Bessie Smith concert at the Orpheum Theatre in Newark, New Jersey, in 1925.

In Harlem, Van Vechten often attended opera and cabarets. He was credited for the surge in white interest in Harlem nightlife and culture as well as involved in helping well-respected writers such as Langston Hughes and Nella Larsen to find publishers for their early works.

In 2001, Emily Bernard published &quot;Remember Me to Harlem&quot;, which is a collection of letters that documents the long friendship between Van Vechten and Langston Hughes, who publicly defended &quot;Nigger Heaven&quot;. Bernard&#x27;s book &quot;Carl Van Vechten and the Harlem Renaissance: A Portrait in Black and White&quot; explores the messy and uncomfortable realities of race, and the complicated tangle of black and white in America.

His older brother Ralph Van Vechten died on June 28, 1927; when Ralph&#x27;s widow Fannie died in 1928, Van Vechten inherited $1 million invested in a trust fund, which was unaffected by the stock market crash of 1929 and provided financial support for Carl and Fania.

By 1930, at the age of 50, Van Vechten was finished with writing and took up photography, using his apartment at 150 West 55th Street as a studio, where he photographed many notable people.

Van Vechten died in 1964 at the age of 84 in New York City. His ashes were scattered over the Shakespeare garden in Central Park. He was the subject of a 1968 biography by Bruce Kellner, &quot;Carl Van Vechten and the Irreverent Decades&quot;, as well as Edward White&#x27;s 2014 biography, &quot;The Tastemaker: Carl Van Vechten and the Birth of Modern America&quot;.

==Works==
At age 40, Van Vechten wrote the book &quot;Peter Whiffle&quot;, which established him as a respected novelist. This novel was recognized as contemporary and an important work to the collection of Harlem Renaissance history. In his novel, autobiographical facts were arranged into a fictional form. In addition to &quot;Peter Whiffle&quot;, Van Vechten wrote several other novels. One is &quot;The Tattooed Countess&quot;, a disguised manipulation of his memories of growing up in Cedar Rapids. His book &quot;The Tiger in the House&quot; explores the quirks and qualities of Van Vechten&#x27;s most beloved animal, the cat.

One of his more controversial novels, &quot;Nigger Heaven&quot;, was received with both controversy and praise. Van Vechten called this book &quot;my Negro novel&quot;. He intended for this novel to depict how African Americans were living in Harlem and not about the suffering of blacks in the South who were dealing with racism and lynchings. Although many encouraged Van Vechten to reconsider giving his novel such a controversial name, he could not resist having an incendiary title. Some worried that his title would take away from the content of the book. In one letter, his father wrote to him, &quot;Whatever you may be compelled to say in the book,&quot; he wrote, &quot;your present title will not be understood &amp; I feel certain you should change it.&quot;

Many black readers were divided over how the novel depicted African Americans. Some felt that it depicted black people as &quot;alien and strange&quot;, and others valued the novel for its representation of African Americans as everyday people, with complexity and flaws just like typical white characters. The novel&#x27;s supporters included Nella Larsen, Langston Hughes and Gertrude Stein, who all defended the novel for bringing Harlem society and racial issues to the forefront of America.

His supporters also sent him letters to voice their opinions of the novel. Alain Locke sent Van Vechten a letter from Berlin citing his novel &quot;Nigger Heaven&quot; and the excitement surrounding its release as his primary reason for making an imminent return home. Gertrude Stein sent Van Vechten a letter from France writing that the novel was the best thing he had ever written. Stein also played an important role in the development of the novel.

Well known critics of this novel included African American scholar W. E. B. Du Bois and black novelist Wallace Thurman. Du Bois dismissed the novel as &quot;cheap melodrama&quot;. Decades after the book was published, novelist and literary critic Ralph Ellison remembered Van Vechten as a bad influence, an unpleasant character who &quot;introduced a note of decadence into Afro-American literary matters which was not needed&quot;. In 1981, David Levering Lewis, historian and author of a classic study of the Harlem Renaissance, called &quot;Nigger Heaven&quot; a &quot;colossal fraud&quot;, a seemingly uplifting book with a message that was overshadowed by &quot;the throb of the tom-tom&quot;. He viewed Van Vechten as being driven by &quot;a mixture of commercialism and patronizing sympathy&quot;.

==Archives and museum collections==

Most of Van Vechten&#x27;s personal papers are held by the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library at Yale University. The Beinecke Library also holds a collection titled &quot;Living Portraits: Carl Van Vechten&#x27;s Color Photographs of African Americans, 1939–1964&quot;, a collection of 1,884 color Kodachrome slides.

The Library of Congress has a collection of approximately 1,400 photographs which it acquired in 1966 from Saul Mauriber (May 21, 1915 – February 12, 2003). There is also a collection of Van Vechten&#x27;s photographs in the Prentiss Taylor collection in the Smithsonian&#x27;s Archives of American Art, and a Van Vechten collection at Fisk University. The Museum of the City of New York&#x27;s collection includes 2,174 of Carl Van Vechten&#x27;s photographs. Brandeis University&#x27;s department of Archives &amp; Special Collections holds 1,689 Carl Van Vechten portraits. Van Vechten also donated materials to Fisk University to form the George Gershwin Memorial Collection of Music and Musical Literature.

The Philadelphia Museum of Art currently holds one of the largest collection of photographs by Van Vechten in the United States. The collection began in 1949 when Van Vechten made a gift of sixty of his photographs to the museum. In 1965, Mark Lutz made a gift to the museum of over 12,000 photographs by Van Vechten from his personal collection. Included in the collection are images from extensive portrait sessions with figures of the Harlem Renaissance such as Langston Hughes, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Zora Neale Hurston, and Cab Calloway; artists such as Marcel Duchamp, Henri Matisse, Gaston Lachaise, Joan Miró, and Frida Kahlo; and countless other actors, musicians, and cultural figures. Also included in the Mark Lutz gift is an extensive body of photographs Van Vechten took at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair as well as a large number of photographs depicting scenes across Western Europe and Northern Africa taken during Van Vechten&#x27;s travels in 1935–1936.

In 1980, concerned that Van Vechten&#x27;s fragile 35 mm nitrate negatives were fast deteriorating, photographer Richard Benson, in conjunction with the Eakins Press Foundation, transformed 50 of the portraits into handmade gravure prints. The album &quot;&#x27;O, Write My Name&#x27;: American Portraits, Harlem Heroes&quot; was completed in 1983. That year, the National Endowment for the Arts transferred the Eakins Press Foundation&#x27;s prototype albums to the permanent collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum.

The National Portrait Gallery, London, holds 17 of Van Vechten&#x27;s portraits of leading creative talents of his era.

More than 3,000 Van Vechten portraits, most of which come from the Library of Congress collection, are included in Wikimedia Commons. His public domain photographs illustrate countless Wikipedia entries on mid-century (mostly American) notables. &quot;See&quot; examples in the gallery below.

<doc id="744398" wikidata="Q540612" url="?curid=744398" title="Jacob (Book of Mormon prophet)">
<text>In the Book of Mormon, Jacob () is a younger brother of the prophet Nephi, the keeper of the small plates of Nephi after Nephi&#x27;s death, and narrates the Book of Jacob, which in the frame narrative of the overall Book of Mormon he authors.

== Family ==
The Book of Mormon mentions Jacob as the younger brother of Nephi, and the elder of two sons born to Lehi (the younger son being Joseph) after Lehi&#x27;s departure from Jerusalem. It does not explicitly name Lehi&#x27;s wife Sariah as the mother of Jacob or Joseph, but no other wife of Lehi is ever mentioned.


== Life ==
According to the Book of Mormon narrative, Jacob was born in the wilderness during his father Lehi&#x27;s journey from Jerusalem to the promised land (the Americas) sometime between 592 B.C. and 590 B.C.

Jacob and his family eventually traveled to the Americas via boat constructed by his brother, Nephi. Jacob went on to be a righteous leader, and succeeded Nephi as prophet to the Nephites. Jacob is the author of the Book of Jacob in the Book of Mormon.

== Teachings ==
Three sermons of Jacob are recorded in the Book of Mormon which include preaching of central as well as specific doctrinal truths. In them, Jacob preaches many core LDS doctrines, including humanity&#x27;s fallen nature and subsequent need of an infinite atonement, the salvation of repentant individuals through the Atonement of Christ, and so forth. He also sternly and definitely preaches against specific practices such as pride, racism, and polygyny (excepting only when commanded by the Lord so as to &quot;raise up a people unto me&quot;). Jacob also speaks favorably of the blessings associated with humble righteousness, such as the bright future of the Lamanite people due to their marital and familial love for each other.

The first sermon draws on Isaiah&#x27;s teachings to invite individuals and nations to return from rejecting Christ and receive His mercies. He clarifies sin as knowing God&#x27;s commandments and doing otherwise, and offers the generous doctrine that &quot;where there is no law given there is no punishment [,] no condemnation[,] and the mercies of the Holy One of Israel have claim upon them, because of the atonement; for they are delivered by the power of him.&quot;

In his second sermon, Jacob decries pride, greed and lust. He upends racist Nephite self-righteousness, saying of the Lamanites, who were ignorant of the finer points of the law, &quot;their husbands love their wives, and their wives love their husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their children&quot; and prophesies that the Lord would be merciful to the Lamanites because of their righteousness in this regard. He explained the Lord&#x27;s standard of sexual purity as &quot;that they should have save it were one wife, and concubines they should have none, and there should not be whoredoms committed among them&quot; unless directed by God via revelation for the purpose of &quot;rais[ing] up seed unto me&quot;.

In Jacob&#x27;s third sermon, Jacob quotes an allegory of the scattering and gathering of Israel (see Parable of the Olive Tree), which he attributes to another prophet, Zenos. In it, what may have been perceived as the Lord&#x27;s punishment is re-framed as the Lord&#x27;s devoted effort to save His original covenant people, as well as to spread his covenant and the blessings that accompany it, to all other nations. Christ is seen as a mediator, calling on the Master of the Vineyard to forbear casting the wicked &quot;into the fire&quot;, saying instead &quot;Let us prune it, and dig about it, and nourish it a little longer&quot;. Lest the Lord of the Vineyard&#x27;s mercy be questioned, the allegory later records that &quot;the Lord of the vineyard wept, and said unto the servant: What could I have done more for my vineyard?... Have I slackened mine hand, that I have not nourished it? Nay, I have nourished it, and I have digged about it, and I have pruned it, and I have dunged it; and I have stretched forth mine hand almost all the day long, and the end draweth nigh. And it grieveth me that I should hew down all the trees of my vineyard, and cast them into the fire that they should be burned.&quot;

== Notable descendants ==
According to the Book of Mormon, several important record keepers were direct descendants of Jacob as shown below:

<text>Lernout &amp; Hauspie Speech Products (L&amp;H) was a Belgium-based speech recognition technology company, founded by Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie, that went bankrupt in 2001 because of a fraud engineered by the management. The company was based in Ypres, Flanders, in what was later called &quot;Flanders Language Valley&quot; (mimicking the Silicon Valley).

== History ==
Lernout &amp; Hauspie was founded in 1987 by Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie. After a difficult start, it quickly grew, and, in 1995, it went public on NASDAQ (LHSP), and was also quoted on the now-defunct Brussels-based EASDAQ exchange. Its headquarters were in Ypres, Belgium, and in Burlington, Massachusetts, USA. At its peak, Lernout &amp; Hauspie had a market capitalization of almost US$10 billion.

Flanders played an important role in investing in the company and the surrounding &quot;Flanders Language Valley&quot;.

It acquired a number of its smaller competitors, including text-to-speech developer Berkeley Speech Technologies, in 1996. In 1998 it acquired Globalink, Inc., a provider of
advanced translation software products and professional translation services. During March–April 2000, Lernout &amp; Hauspie acquired Dictaphone for nearly US$1 billion, then acquired Dragon Systems shortly thereafter. Lernout &amp; Hauspie also acquired PowerScribe, a voice recognition system for Radiology. This system was started by a company called Articulate Systems, and sold and supported by a company called The MRC Group (later Fonix, then SpeechFX) before becoming part of L&amp;H.

For some time, Lernout &amp; Hauspie was dogged by rumours of financial impropriety, and in early 1999 the Wall Street Journal ran allegations in its &quot;Heard on the Street&quot; column by Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Smithson that earnings had been overstated. Further investigation by WSJ staffer Jesse Eisinger led to the revelation on 8 August 2000 of a major financial scandal involving fictitious transactions in Korea and improper accounting methodologies elsewhere. In April 2001, founders Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie, as well as former CEO Gaston Bastiaens, were arrested in what is considered one of the largest corporate scandals in history prior to Enron. After having struggled for a year, Lernout &amp; Hauspie finally filed for bankruptcy on 25 October 2001.

Many people, especially in West Flanders, were blinded by the company&#x27;s success and lost large sums of money on Lernout &amp; Hauspie stock. The Flanders regional government became a major Lernout &amp; Hauspie investor through a venture capital arm. During one of Lernout &amp; Hauspie&#x27;s cash shortages, it guaranteed 75% of a bank loan to the company. Investors and taxpayers alike were hit hard when the company went bankrupt. While Pol Hauspie pleaded guilty, Jo Lernout denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the company has been a victim of a &quot;CIA conspiracy&quot;. On September 20, 2010, co-founders Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie, as well as Nico Willaert, former vice chairman, and Gaston Bastiaens, former chief executive officer, were each sentenced to five years prison (of which three years effective and two years probationary) for fraud by the Ghent Court of Appeals. In September 2012 Jo Lernout began a one-year sentence of house arrest with an electronic ankle bracelet.

== Technology ==

After the bankruptcy, Nuance Communications (known then as ScanSoft) acquired all of the speech technologies. The revenues of the company grew sharply from $17.1 million in third quarter of 2001, to $216 million in Q3 2008. Vantage Learning acquired all of the proofing, spelling, and linguistic search technologies.

&quot;Lernout &amp; Hauspie Michelle&quot; and &quot;Lernout &amp; Hauspie Michael&quot; are text-to-speech voices created by L&amp;H and included in Microsoft Office 2003. L&amp;H speech recognition was used in the &quot;Speech&quot; option in the control panel of Microsoft Windows XP, abbreviated as &quot;LH&quot; (the company filed for bankruptcy following its release). In addition, Microsoft Office uses certain elements of a grammar checker previously owned by L&amp;H, which is mentioned in the About window.

Durkin was born in Chicago, Illinois, on March 18, 1894, the son of James J. Durkin and Mary Catherine (&quot;née&quot; Higgins). At the age of 17, Durkin became involved in the plumber&#x27;s and pipe fitter&#x27;s union. On August 29, 1921, Durkin married the former Anna H. McNicholas. They had three sons: Martin Bernard, William Joseph and John Francis Durkin. He eventually became president of that union, and then served as Director of Labor for the State of Illinois from 1933 to 1941. He worked closely with the President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Secretary of Labor, Frances Perkins.

Durkin served as the Secretary of Labor during the Eisenhower administration. A Democrat among Republicans, he unsuccessfully pushed for his revisions in the Taft-Hartley Act. This led to his resignation after less than eight months in office, the shortest tenure of any Secretary of Labor.

He died in Washington D.C., from complications of cancer surgery. He was interred in St. Mary Catholic Cemetery in Evergreen Park, Illinois.

<doc id="744426" wikidata="Q277343" url="?curid=744426" title="Torrijos–Carter Treaties">
<text>The Torrijos–Carter Treaties () are two treaties signed by the United States and Panama in Washington, D.C., on September 7, 1977, which superseded the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty of 1903. The treaties guaranteed that Panama would gain control of the Panama Canal after 1999, ending the control of the canal that the U.S. had exercised since 1903. The treaties are named after the two signatories, U.S. President Jimmy Carter and the Commander of Panama&#x27;s National Guard, General Omar Torrijos.

This first treaty is officially titled The Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal () and is commonly known as the &quot;Neutrality Treaty&quot;. Under this treaty, the U.S. retained the permanent right to defend the canal from any threat that might interfere with its continued neutral service to ships of all nations. The second treaty is titled The Panama Canal Treaty (&quot;Tratado del Canal de Panamá&quot;), and provided that as from 12:00 on December 31, 1999, Panama would assume full control of canal operations and become primarily responsible for its defense.

== History ==
Panamanian efforts to renegotiate the original Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty had been ongoing almost since it was first signed in November 1903, a few weeks after Panama obtained its independence from Colombia. However, activity to renegotiate or abrogate the treaty increased considerably after the Suez Crisis, and events in 1964 precipitated a complete breakdown in relations between the U.S. and Panama. On January 9 of that year, Panamanian students entered the canal zone to fly the Panamanian flag next to the American flag, per a 1963 agreement to defuse tension between the two countries. Panamanians watching the event began rioting after the students raising the Panamanian flag were jeered and harassed by American school officials, students, and their parents. During the scuffle, somehow the Panamanian flag was torn. Widespread rioting ensued, during which over 20 Panamanians were killed and about 500 were injured. Most of the casualties were caused by fire from U.S. troops, who had been called in to protect Canal Zone property, including private residences of Canal Zone employees. January 9 is a National Holiday in Panama, known as Martyrs&#x27; Day.

The next day, January 10, Panama broke off diplomatic relations with the United States and on January 19, President of Panama Roberto Chiari declared that Panama would not re-establish diplomatic ties with the United States until the U.S. agreed to begin negotiations on a new treaty. The first steps in that direction were taken shortly thereafter on April 3, 1964, when both countries agreed to an immediate resumption of diplomatic relations and the United States agreed to adopt procedures for the &quot;elimination of the causes of conflict between the two countries&quot;. A few weeks later, Robert B. Anderson, President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s special representative, flew to Panama to pave the way for future talks. Negotiations over the next years resulted in a treaty in 1967, but it failed to be ratified in Panama.
After the failure of those treaties, Panama experienced a change in government following a 1968 military coup. The new government was consolidated under Omar Torrijos, who decided to definitively reject the 1967 treaty. In response to a lack of progress of negotiations with the Nixon administration, the Torrijos government succeeded in holding a March 1973 United Nations Security Council session in Panama City, where it attracted considerable international support for its cause. The diplomatic debacle also attracted Henry Kissinger&#x27;s attention and helped produce momentum for the 1974 Tack-Kissinger agreement, which would provide the crucial framework for negotiations moving forward. &quot;It was this work, beginning in late 1972, that made Panama the visible issue that Carter boldly hoped to solve as a watershed for a new style of foreign policy and an era of improved relations with Latin America.&quot;

The Carter administration made the canal a high priority, starting during the transition. The issue had been highlighted by a blue-ribbon commission headed by Ambassador Sol Linowitz. Several individuals associated with that commission would play major roles in the Carter administration&#x27;s Latin America policy, including Linowitz himself and NSC Senior Director Robert A. Pastor. Negotiations were resumed on February 15, 1977, and were completed by August 10 of that year. On the American side the negotiators were Ellsworth Bunker and Sol Linowitz; the Panamanian side of the negotiations was headed by Rómulo Escobar Bethancourt. Senator Dennis DeConcini sponsored a critical amendment to the Panama Canal Treaty that allowed the Senate to come to a consensus on giving control of the Canal to Panama. A few days before final agreement on the treaties was reached, President Carter had sent a telegram to all members of Congress informing them of the status of the negotiations and asking them to withhold judgment on the treaty until they had an opportunity to carefully study it. Senator Strom Thurmond responded to Carter&#x27;s appeal by stating in a speech later that day, &quot;The canal is ours, we bought and we paid for it and we should keep it.&quot;

== Ratification ==

Both treaties were subsequently ratified in Panama with 67.4% of the vote in a referendum held on October 23, 1977. To allow for popular discussion of the treaties and in response to claims made by opponents of the treaty in the U.S. that Panama was incapable of democratically ratifying them, restrictions on the press and on political parties were lifted several weeks prior to the vote. On the day of the vote, 96% of Panama&#x27;s eligible voters went to the polls, the highest voter turnout in Panama up to that time. The neutrality treaty was of major concern among voters, particularly on the political left, and was one reason why the treaties failed to obtain even greater popular support.

The United States Senate advised and consented to ratification of the first treaty on March 16, 1978, and to the second treaty on April 18 by identical 68 to 32 margins. On both votes, 52 Democrats and 16 Republicans voted in favor of advising and consenting to ratification, while 10 Democrats and 22 Republicans voted against.

==Criticism==
The treaties drew vehement controversy in the United States, particularly among conservatives led by Ronald Reagan, Strom Thurmond and Jesse Helms, who regarded them as the surrender of a strategic American asset to what they characterized as a hostile government. The attack was mobilized by numerous groups, especially the American Conservative Union, the Conservative Caucus, the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress, Citizens for the Republic, the American Security Council Foundation, the Young Republicans, the National Conservative Political Action Committee, the Council for National Defense, Young Americans for Freedom, the Council for Inter-American Security, and the Campus Republican Action Organization.

In the years preceding (and following) the final transfer of canal assets there were efforts to declare the Carter–Torrijos treaties null and void, e.g. House Joint Resolution 77 (HJR 77) introduced by Helen Chenoweth-Hage. Support of HJR 77 was part of the 2000 platform of the Texas Republican Party but no longer appeared in the 2004 platform.

In December 2024, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump criticized the Panama Canal passage rates being charged by Panama as being too expensive, warned against potential Chinese control of or influence over the canal, and raised the possibility of a US demand for the full and immediate return of control over the canal to the United States. Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino immediately rejected each point of this criticism and preemptively refused to return the canal. In January 2025, Rep. Dusty Johnson announced his intentions to introduce a bill that would authorize the U.S. President to &quot;initiate and conduct negotiations... to reacquire the Panama Canal.&quot;

== Support ==
Support for the treaties came from a variety of interests, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff and members of Congress, such as Ernest Hollings, Hubert Humphrey, and most importantly Howard Baker and Robert Byrd. Carter&#x27;s National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski attributed much of the political support for the treaty to his assuring attendees at a meeting including Byrd, that the United States would invoke the treaty to overthrow any Panamanian government that shut down the canal. Other supporters included Admiral Elmo Zumwalt and General Maxwell Taylor; John Wayne, who was friends with Omar Torrijos, AFL-CIO president George Meany, statesmen Averell Harriman, Dean Rusk, George Ball, Henry Cabot Lodge, and John Sherman Cooper, and former first lady Lady Bird Johnson. More moderate conservatives, including former President Gerald Ford and Henry Kissinger, both made public statements in support of the treaty. Organized efforts to promote the treaties came from the Committee of Americans for the Canal Treaties and New Directions. Many world leaders also came out in support of the treaties, including positive statements from Barbados Prime Minister Tom Adams, Bolivian President Hugo Banzer, Dominican President Joaquín Balaguer, Guatemalan President Kjell Laugerud, Guyanese Prime Minister Forbes Burnham, Nicaraguan President Anastasio Somoza, Peruvian President Francisco Morales Bermúdez, Chilean President Augusto Pinochet, Costa Rican President Daniel Oduber, and Venezuelan President Carlos Andrés Pérez.

==Implementation==
The treaty laid out a timetable for transfer of the canal, leading to a complete handover of all lands and buildings in the canal area to Panama. The most immediate consequence of this treaty was that the Canal Zone, as an entity, ceased to exist on October 1, 1979. The final phase of the treaty was completed on December 31, 1999. On this date, the United States relinquished control of the Panama Canal and all areas in what had been the Panama Canal Zone.

As a result of the treaties, by the year 2000 nearly , including some 7,000 buildings, such as military facilities, warehouses, schools, and private residences, were transferred to Panama. In 1993, the Panamanian government created a temporary agency (&quot;Autoridad de la Región Interoceánica&quot; or &quot;Interoceanic Region Authority&quot;, commonly referred to as ARI) to administer and maintain the reverted properties.

On the day the treaty took effect, most of the land within the former Canal Zone transferred to Panama. However, the treaty set aside many Canal Zone areas and facilities for transfer during the following 20 years. The treaty specifically categorized areas and facilities by name as &quot;Military Areas of Coordination&quot;, &quot;Defense Sites&quot; and &quot;Areas Subject to Separate Bilateral Agreement&quot;. These were to be transferred by the U.S. to Panama during certain time windows or simply by the end of the 243-month treaty period.

On October 1, 1979, among the many such parcels so designated in the treaty, 34 emerged as true enclaves (surrounded entirely by land solely under Panamanian jurisdiction). In later years as other areas were turned over to Panama, eight more true enclaves emerged. Of these 42 true enclaves, 14 were related to military logistics, seven were military communications sites, five Federal Aviation Administration facilities, five military housing enclaves, three military base areas, two military research facilities, four secondary school parcels, one elementary school, and one hospital. At least 13 other parcels each were encircled not only by land under the absolute jurisdiction of Panama, but also by an &quot;Area of Civil Coordination&quot; (housing) that was subject to elements of both U.S. and Panamanian public law under the treaty.

In addition, the treaty designated numerous areas and individual facilities as &quot;Canal Operating Areas&quot; for joint U.S.–Panama ongoing operations by a commission. On the effective date of the treaty, many of these, including Madden Dam, became newly surrounded by the territory of Panama. Just after noon local time on 31 December 1999, all former Canal Zone parcels of all types had come under the exclusive jurisdiction of Panama.

<text>Harry Weinberg (1908–1990) was an American billionaire businessman who founded &quot;The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, Inc.&quot;, a private charitable foundation, with over $2 billion in assets in 2018 and headquartered in Owings Mills, Maryland and Honolulu, Hawaii. The foundation is named for Weinberg and his wife of 58 years, Jeanette Gutman Weinberg (1909–1989).

==Biography== 
Weinberg was born in 1908 in Galicia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to a poor Jewish family. His father Joseph Weinberg came to Baltimore, Maryland in the US, and sent for his family in 1912. One of his earliest ventures was selling souvenirs for celebrations at the end of World War I. He dropped out of school at age 12 and worked in his father&#x27;s car repair shop.

During the Great Depression of the 1930s, he and his brother William would buy properties at depressed prices, fix them up, and resell them for a profit. Throughout his career he was known for being a keen judge of undervalued assets, and having the patience to wait for their values to increase.
In Honolulu, Hawaii, he repeated this with the Fifth Avenue Coach Company, in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Dallas, Texas. He started buying stock in the Honolulu Rapid Transit Company in 1955, eventually gained control, slashed costs, and then sold it at a profit to the City &amp; County of Honolulu (it is now known as TheBus) in 1971.
In 1968 he moved to Hawaii where he died November 4, 1990.
His investments included Amfac, Inc., Maui Land &amp; Pineapple Company, Alexander &amp; Baldwin, and other real estate ventures.

In 1932 he married Jeanette Gutman (1910–1989). A supporter of Israel, in 1984 he had donated funds to air condition all of Israel&#x27;s nursing homes.

His wife having predeceased him, on his death in 1990, he was survived by son Morton Weinberg, and left $3 million to his grandchildren. His will left the remainder, almost US$1 billion of property, to the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation they had founded in 1959.

==Foundation==
The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation was originally established in 1959. 
Upon his death in 1990 he left $3 million to his grandchildren. His will left almost US$1 billion of property to the foundation.

Weinberg&#x27;s will specified that 25 percent of annual distributions will go to Jewish charities and further specifies that the proceeds shall be used for the benefit of the poor, and bans gifts to music or arts institutions. The assets continued to grow in value, while large grants enabled entire buildings to be built, such as the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Memorial Library at the University of Scranton.

Throughout Baltimore and the Hawaiian Islands, many major civic and private buildings and complexes were named after Harry and Jeanette Weinberg. Before his death in 1990, he had decreed that any building for which his charitable foundation gave more than $250,000 would have the couple&#x27;s name on it somewhere...(Weinberg&#x27;s) charter allows the foundation to contribute no more than 30 percent of a project&#x27;s cost. [Baltimore Sun December 7, 2003|By Kate Shatzkin] One of the largest projects named in their honor was the Filipino Community Center in Waipahu, Hawaii, dedicated by Philippines President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and representatives of President of the United States George W. Bush in 2002. The Filipino Community Center is one of the largest ethnic and cultural centers in the United States. 
Other projects include the Ko Olina Resort, which asked for $75 million in tax credits.

The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation is administered by a board of trustees that at times includes members of the Weinberg family. Members are usually professionals residing in Honolulu and Baltimore.

<doc id="744435" wikidata="Q945899" url="?curid=744435" title="Spy vs. Spy (1984 video game)">
<text>Spy vs. Spy is a video game written by Michael Riedel for the Commodore 64 and published by First Star Software in 1984. A port for the Atari 8-bit computers was released simultaneously. It is a two-player, split-screen game, based on &quot;Mad&quot; magazine&#x27;s long-running cartoon strip &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot;, about the slapstick antics of two spies trying to kill each other with improbably elaborate traps and weapons.

It was ported to the Apple II, ZX Spectrum, Acorn Electron, Atari ST, BBC Micro, Commodore 16, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, Master System, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Nintendo Entertainment System. A 3D remake/remaster of the same name was released for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 in 2005.

==Gameplay==

The object of the game is to collect various secret items in a briefcase and exit the building through a door to the airport, either before the opposing player exits or before the timer runs out. While searching for the items, traps can be laid to take out the opponent (or the player himself, if careless). Each spy has a personal countdown timer which depletes by 30 seconds upon each death.

The arena is an embassy, constructed from a series of interconnected rooms laid out on a grid pattern. Higher levels have more rooms and therefore a larger play area. The spies can engage in hand-to-hand combat (achieved by wiggling the joystick or directional pad left and right or up and down when the spies are in proximity to each other) as well as place traps on the furniture and doors which occupy the playing area. These traps are triggered when a spy searches a piece of furniture or opens a booby trapped door, resulting in a cartoon-style animation showing the subject being shot, blown up, etc., and floating up to heaven as an angel.

Strategy is introduced by limiting the numbers of each trap a spy can use and by allowing the traps to be triggered by either spy. Some pieces of furniture also contain &#x27;remedies&#x27; which match up to specific traps; these allow a trap to be defused, but can only be fetched one at a time.

==Reception==

&quot;Video&quot; magazine described it as &quot;a rousing action-strategy contest&quot; and praised the game&#x27;s &quot;excellent&quot; graphics as &quot;befit[ting] a game so rooted in a visual medium.&quot; The reviewer also noted that &quot;no one has more successfully captured the original feel of the source nor offered a more satisfying result&quot;. &quot;Ahoy!&quot; agreed in the Commodore 64 version&#x27;s faithfulness to the original, and praised both the simultaneous two-player and one-player options. The magazine later praised the game&#x27;s graphics, theme song, and humorous fatalities. &quot;Antic&quot; called it &quot;one of the most original and clever games for the Atari computers yet&quot;. The magazine praised the simultaneous two-player display and concluded, &quot;I cannot recommend this game highly enough.&quot; The ZX Spectrum version was rated number 20 in the &quot;Your Sinclair Official Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, and awarded a &quot;Crash Smash&quot; in the August 1985 issue.

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; scored the Master System version 90% in 1989 and 88% in 1990.

The NES version sold 300,000 units in North America.

== Legacy==
A remake including the original version was released for iOS in 2012, but is no longer available.

Two sequels to the original 1984 game were produced: &quot;Spy vs. Spy II: The Island Caper&quot; and &quot;Spy vs. Spy III: Arctic Antics&quot;. The third game was also released for the IBM PC. These kept the basic gameplay while tweaking some core features.

<doc id="744438" wikidata="Q5692824" url="?curid=744438" title="Heartland Conference">
<text>The Heartland Conference was a collegiate athletic conference affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)&#x27;s Division II level, which was founded in 1999. The majority of members were in Texas, with additional members in Arkansas, Kansas, and Oklahoma. The conference office was located in Waco, Texas.

==History==
The conference was formed in 1999 by founding members Drury University, University of the Incarnate Word, Lincoln University, Rockhurst University, St. Edward&#x27;s University, St. Mary&#x27;s University and Texas Wesleyan University. Oklahoma Panhandle State University and Dallas Baptist University joined in 2002. Founding members Drury and Rockhurst left the Heartland Conference to join the Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC) in 2005. Western New Mexico University and Montana State University - Billings joined in 2005. However, WNMU re-joined the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference in 2006 and MSUB joined the Great Northwest Athletic Conference in 2007. Newman University, Texas A&amp;M International University and the University of Texas of the Permian Basin joined the conference in 2006, making the transition from NAIA to NCAA Division II. The University of Arkansas – Fort Smith joined the conference in the Fall of 2009 after transitioning from the NJCAA. In the fall of 2010, Lincoln left for the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association and Incarnate Word left for the Lone Star Conference. In July 2011, McMurry University announced that it had been accepted as candidate for D-II membership and would join the Heartland Conference in the fall of 2012. In February 2012, Oklahoma Christian University announced its intention to seek membership in NCAA Division II. In Spring 2012, Rogers State University, a member of the NAIA Sooner Athletic Conference, applied for membership. The conference confirmed in July 2012 that Oklahoma Christian&#x27;s teams would play full conference schedules starting in Fall 2012 and that Rogers State and Lubbock Christian University would begin conference play in 2013-14.

On August 30, 2017, the Lone Star Conference announced that eight of the nine members of the Heartland Conference would join in fall 2019; the remaining member, Newman, announced it would seek other affiliation at that time. On February 8, 2018, Newman announced that it would become an associate member of the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association beginning in the 2019–20 season.
On October 18, 2018 Rogers State decided to join the MIAA instead of the Lone Star.

<text>The Canada men&#x27;s national ice hockey team (popularly known as Team Canada; ) is the ice hockey team representing Canada internationally. The team is overseen by Hockey Canada, a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation. From 1920 until 1963, Canada&#x27;s international representation was by senior amateur club teams. Canada&#x27;s national men&#x27;s team was founded in 1963 by Father David Bauer as a part of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association, playing out of the University of British Columbia.
The nickname &quot;Team Canada&quot; was first used for the 1972 Summit Series and has been frequently used to refer to both the Canadian national men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams ever since.

Canada is the leading national ice hockey team in international play, having won the 1972 Summit Series against the Soviet Union, a record four Canada Cups dating back to 1976, a record two World Cups of Hockey, a record nine Olympic gold medals, and a record 28 World Championship titles.

Canada is one of the most successful national ice hockey teams in the world and a member of the so-called &quot;Big Six&quot;, the unofficial group of the six strongest men&#x27;s ice hockey nations, along with Russia, the United States, Sweden, Finland, and the Czech Republic.

==History==
Hockey is Canada&#x27;s national winter sport, and Canadians are extremely passionate about the game. Canada was first represented internationally at the 1910 European Championships by the Oxford Canadians, a team of Canadians from the University of Oxford. They represented Canada again at the 1912 World Championships.

From 1920 until 1963, the senior amateur club teams representing Canada, were usually the most recent Allan Cup champions. The last amateur club team from Canada to win a gold medal at the World Championship was the Trail Smoke Eaters in 1961. The responsibility of choosing which team represented Canada belonged to Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) secretary-manager; George Dudley from 1947 to 1960, and Gordon Juckes from 1960 to 1963.

Following the 1963 World Championships, Father David Bauer founded the national team as a permanent institution. The new permanent national team first competed in ice hockey at the 1964 Winter Olympics. His philosophy was to simply win the games against the weaker countries instead of running up the score. Canada, Czechoslovakia and Sweden finished with identical records of five wins and two losses. Canada thought they had won the bronze medal based on the goal differential in the three games among the tied countries. When they attended the presentation of the Olympic medals, they were disappointed to learn they had finished in fourth place based on goal differential of all seven games played. The players and CAHA president Art Potter accused that International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) president Bunny Ahearne, made a last-minute decision to change the rules and take away a medal from Canada. Marshall Johnston summarized the team&#x27;s feeling that, &quot;The shepherd and his flock had been fleeced&quot;.

Before the Soviet Union began international competition in 1954, Canada dominated international hockey, winning six out of seven golds at the Olympics and 10 World Championship gold medals. Canada then went 50 years without winning the Winter Olympic Gold medal, and from 1962 to 1993, did not win any World Championships. This was in part because Canada&#x27;s best professional players were unable to attend these events as they had commitments with their National Hockey League teams.

Canada was awarded hosting duties of the 1970 Ice Hockey World Championships with the limited use of former professionals. The IIHF later reversed the permission after International Olympic Committee president Avery Brundage objected to professionals at an amateur event. CAHA president Earl Dawson withdrew the national team from international competitions against European hockey teams until Canada was allowed to use its best players.

While boycotting the IIHF, other international competitions were held such as the 1972 Canada–USSR Summit Series and in 1976 the inaugural Canada Cup invitational. Canada returned to the IIHF in 1977 after a series of negotiations between IIHF President Günther Sabetzki and top Canadian and American professional ice hockey officials. As a result, professionals are allowed to compete at the World Championship which was scheduled later in the year to ensure more players are available from among the NHL teams eliminated from the Stanley Cup playoffs. In return, a competition for the Canada Cup was to be played every four years on North American territory with the participation of Canada, the United States, and the four strongest European national teams, including professionals.

In 1983, Hockey Canada began the &quot;Program of Excellence&quot;, whose purpose was to prepare a team for the Winter Olympics every four years. This new National Team played a full season together all over the world against both national and club teams, and often attracted top NHL prospects. In 1986, the International Olympic Committee voted to allow professional athletes to compete in Olympic Games, starting in 1988. Veteran pros with NHL experience and, in a few cases, current NHLers who were holding out in contract disputes joined the team. This program was discontinued in 1998, when the NHL began shutting down to allow its players to compete.

After not winning a gold medal for 33 years, Canada won the 1994 World Championship in Italy. Since that time, they have won in 1997, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2015, 2016, 2021 and 2023. Canada captured its first Olympic gold medal in 50 years at Salt Lake City 2002. At Vancouver 2010, Canada won the gold medal with a 3–2 win against the United States in the final. Sidney Crosby&#x27;s overtime goal secured Canada the final gold medal awarded at the Games. At the 2012 World Championship in Finland and Sweden, Ryan Murray became the first draft eligible prospect to represent Canada at the Ice Hockey World Championship.

Canada successfully defended gold at Sochi 2014, becoming the first men&#x27;s team to do so since the Soviet Union in 1988, the first to finish the tournament undefeated since 1984 and the first to do both with a full NHL participation. Their relentless offensive pressure and stifling defence has earned the 2014 squad praise as perhaps the best, most complete Team Canada ever assembled. Drew Doughty and Shea Weber led the team in scoring, while Jonathan Toews scored the gold medal-winning goal in the first period of a 3–0 win over Sweden in the final. The architect behind the 2010 and 2014 teams, Steve Yzerman, immediately stepped down as general manager following the win.

Led by general manager Jim Nill, head coach Todd McLellan, and the late addition of captain Sidney Crosby, Canada won the 2015 IIHF World Championship in dominating fashion over Russia, their first win at the Worlds since 2007. By winning all 10 of their games in regulation, Hockey Canada was awarded a 1 million Swiss franc bonus prize in the first year of its existence. Canada scored 66 goals in their 10 games and had the top three scorers of the tournament: Jason Spezza, Jordan Eberle and Taylor Hall. Tyler Seguin also led the championship with nine goals. The win secured Canada&#x27;s return to number one on the IIHF world rankings for the first time since 2010.

At the 2021 IIHF World Championship, following a cancelled 2020 tournament due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Canada returned to the competition with a roster weaker than most years, featuring rare inclusions of draft prospects and other non-NHL prospects. The team lost three games in regulation to start the tournament, the first Canadian team in Worlds history to do so, and needed 10 points over the final four round robin games to make the playoff round. Winning the tiebreaker over Kazakhstan, Canada qualified for the playoff round as the lowest seed and managed wins over Russia and the United States before playing Finland for a rematch of the 2019 final in the gold medal game. Nick Paul&#x27;s goal won the game for Canada in overtime, despite the Finns having either led or been tied the entire game, capping off a most unlikely Canadian IIHF men&#x27;s gold.

On the 40th anniversary of the 1972 Summit Series, the IIHF Milestone Award was given to the Canadian and Russian teams for the event which had a &quot;decisive influence on the development of the game&quot;. Reuters wrote that Canada was expected to win the series easily, but when they came from behind to win in the eighth and final game, it marked &quot;the beginning of the modern hockey era&quot;.

===Spengler Cup===
In the Spengler Cup, Team Canada competes against European club teams, such as HC Davos who host the tournament every year in Eisstadion Davos. Canada used to be represented by the standing national team at this event, but is now usually made up of Canadians playing in European leagues or the American Hockey League. In 2019, Team Canada won its 16th Spengler Cup, passing the host team HC Davos for the most titles. HC Davos is now tied for most wins after winning in 2023.

<text>Wilmer Leon Fields (August 2, 1922 – June 4, 2004) was an American baseball player who was a household name in the Negro leagues and other baseball circuits between the 1940s and 1950s.

Born in Manassas, Virginia, Fields was a versatile two-way player in the Negro leagues, and also played in Canada and several Latin American leagues, including Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Cuba, Panama, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic. In most leagues, he was a pitcher but played at third base or outfield in games when he was not scheduled to pitch. His consistent batting and pitching skills helped him capture the Most Valuable Player award on many occasions throughout the course of his distinguished career.

Fields possessed a running fastball complemented by a curve, a slider and eventually a knuckler, and he had average control of his pitches. He was often referred to as ″Red″, ″Bill″, or ″Chinky″.

==Professional career==

===Negro leagues===
At 6-foot 3-inches (1.92 m) and 220 pounds (100 kg), Fields played quarterback at Virginia State University in Petersburg, but left school when he was recruited to play for the Homestead Grays Negro League club in 1939. He spent his entire Negro League career with the Grays but continued his college education in the off-seasons while also playing football and basketball.

The Grays were one of the finest teams in the Negro League, winning nine league championships before folding in the wake of desegregated professional baseball. They played many of their home games at the old Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C. and some in Homestead, a neighborhood of Pittsburgh. After Jackie Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1947 season and broke the color line in Major League Baseball, the Negro leagues struggled, starting to die off.

In 1940 Fields joined the Grays at the age of 17, showing records of 2–1, 13-5 and 15–3 in his first three seasons, but his promising career was interrupted —but hardly harmed— by Army service in Europe during World War II. Following his discharge in 1946, Fields posted a record of 72–17 record over the next five seasons, compiling a stunning record of 102 wins and 26 losses during his eight years in the league, helping his team clinch four pennant titles (1940–1942; 1948) and a World Series championship (1948).

In 1948 he was selected for the East-West All-Star Game, which was played at Yankee Stadium. Later that same year, Fields led Homestead to defeat the Baltimore Elite Giants 3–0 in the 1948 Negro National League Championship. The Grays then defeated the Birmingham Black Barons, 4–1, to win the 1948 Negro World Series, during what turned out to be the last Series ever played in Negro league history.

After that, he became part of several championship teams and was selected as Most Valuable Player a record seven times in different baseball leagues.

===Canadian baseball===
Once the Grays disbanded, Fields received numerous contract offers from major league organizations, but he was content with what he was doing and refused them. Then, he opted to play in Canadian baseball during the summer and also in the Caribbean winter leagues. As a result, he travelled to Canada to play for the Brantford Red Sox of the competitive Intercounty Baseball League in southwestern Ontario.

Fields played for Brantford in 1951 and from 1953 through 1955, as well as for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League in 1952.

While playing for Brantford, he posted pitching records of 11–2, 10–2, 9-3 and 8–0, and batting averages of .382, 381, .379 and .425, respectively, to win three MVP awards in the league during the 1951, 1954 and 1955 seasons. in four campaigns there, he compiled a 38–7 record and a .392 average.

In his only season for Toronto, he hit a second best team average of .291 in 52 games while sharing duties with eight outfielders.

===National Baseball Congress===
Besides his stay in Canada, Fields played from 1956 to 1957 with the Fort Wayne Allen Dairymen team based in Indiana. The team was a member of the Michigan-Indiana League, a top notch top semipro league composed of black and white players, which had been integrated by legendary Double Duty Radcliffe in 1948.

Between the 1940s and 1950s, Fort Wayne was a strong ballclub that participated in several Global World Series organized by the National Baseball Congress.

Starting in 1935, participated in the event championship teams from four continents. Usually, the U.S. teams had Negro League players, minor leaguers and former big leaguers in their rosters. The Fort Wayne team won four NBC championship titles from 1947 through 1950 and a fifth title in 1956.

In the two seasons, Fields had records of 6-1 and 5–0 on the mound, with batting averages of .432 and .387. He earned MVP honors in the 1956 NBC tournament, putting his name alongside greats such as Satchel Paige (1935), Red Barkley (1941), George Archie (1943), Cot Deal (1944–1945), Bill Ricks (1949), Pat Scantlebury (1950), Daryl Spencer (1955) and Clyde McCullough (1955).

===Puerto Rico Baseball League===
Likewise, Fields represented a good example of a ballplayer who benefited from the opportunities created by the interdependence of Latino and black baseball. Competition in the Caribbean Baseball has always been passionate and intense, as Fields recalled in his autobiography &quot;My Life in the Negro Leagues&quot;: «Not everyone could make it down there and you better believe if you didn&#x27;t produce you didn&#x27;t last long. I was lucky that way».

In addition to eight Negro league campaigns and several minor league stints after integration, Fields also played four seasons in the Puerto Rico Baseball League for the Indios de Mayagüez. He looked forward to supplement his income during the winter by doing what he loved most.

In 1947–1948 he had a chance to show his stuff as a pitcher/outfielder for Mayagüez, ending with a 5–5 mark, while batting .315 with five home runs and 41 runs batted in. Then, he posted a 10-4 pitching record and hit .330 with 11 homers in the 1948–1949 season, topping the league with 88 RBIs and winning MVP Award honors, to lead his team to the 1949 Caribbean Series. Fields hit .429 as the Indios&#x27; third baseman in the Series, including two doubles, a homer and seven RBIs. He also went into the record books by hitting the first grand slam in Series history.

In 1949–1950 Fields had an 8–4 record and batted .326 for Mayagüez. He later was included as reinforcement of the Criollos de Caguas in the 1950 Caribbean Series.

Notably, Fields got one start in the event and defeated the highly favored Alacranes de Almendares of Cuba, 6–1, limiting them to five hits in a complete game effort. The only Cuban run came from a home run by Héctor Rodríguez. It was the second heroic effort for Fields in many games. In the previous game, facing the Navegantes del Magallanes of Venezuela, Fields belted a pinch-hit, bottom of the ninth, two-run homer against Terris McDuffie, to lift the Criollos to a 2–1 victory. It was the first walk-off hit of the Series, and rewarded a stellar four-hit by Luis Arroyo, who became the first pitcher born in Puerto Rico to win a Caribbean Series game.

Besides, Fields played the rest of the games as a backup outfielder for Willard Brown, Luis Olmo and Tetelo Vargas, going 3-for-11 with one home run, and scoring eight runs to tie Cuban Al Gionfriddo for the Series lead.

He then finished with a .323 average and a 5–2 record for Mayagüez in part of the 1950–1951 season.

===Venezuela Baseball League===
After that, Fields spent time in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League while playing for the Cervecería Caracas and Patriotas de Venezuela clubs in a span of three seasons.

Fields reported to the Caracas club in the 1950–1951 midseason. As an outfielder for Cervecería, he batted .389 with three home runs and 13 RBIs in 28 games. He became the first player in league history to hit two grand slams in a single season, a feat only matched by Billy Queen in the 1953–1954 tournament and Pete Koegel in 1973–1974.

In 1951–1952, playing full-time, Fields carried Cervecería to the pennant title en route to the 1952 Caribbean Series, winning the league&#x27;s batting crown with a .357 average, while also leading in hits (74), RBIs (45), runs scored (48), and doubles (21). He also finished second in home runs (8), one behind Patriotas&#x27; Russell Kerns, and added another MVP award to his trophy case.

He continued his torrid pace in the Series, batting .360 and leading in RBIs (7), while tying in home runs (2) with Cuban Spider Jorgensen and for the most hits (9) with Cuban Sandy Amorós and Panamanian Spook Jacobs. In addition, he collected the second-highest batting average behind Amorós (.450), and was named to the All-Star team as a right fielder.

Fields then played briefly for the Patriotas in 1951–1952, appearing in just 17 games and batting .258 with 10 RBIs.

===Other leagues===
In 1953–1954, Fields enjoyed another good season as an outfielder/pitcher for the Estrellas de Oriente of the Dominican Professional Baseball League. He had a very solid average of .393, while sporting a 5–2 record from the pitching circle.

Fields later played in Colombian baseball during the 1954–1955 and 1955–1956 seasons, batting averages of .330 and .319 respectively, and was honored with an MVP Award in his first season.
He also had brief stints in Cuba and Panama during the same decade, before playing his last season in the Mexican League in 1958. He divided his playing time between the Diablos Rojos del México and the Sultanes de Monterrey, playing at third base and some in the outfield, while batting .375 with seven home runs and 35 RBIs in 25 games.

==After baseball==
Fields left baseball in 1958 and initially took a job as a bricklayer&#x27;s helper. Disappointed by the low pay, he found more promising work as an alcohol counselor with the District government. His work took him to reform schools and prisons. At the Lorton Correctional Complex, he organized baseball games between inmates and young Prince William County players. The athletic genes were passed to his son, who attended Providence College on a full basketball scholarship.

He retired in the mid-1980s, worked briefly as a security guard and then became part of the new Negro League Baseball Players Association, which helped raise money for income-strapped former members and bring attention to the long-defunct league. As president of the association since the mid-1990s, he organized autograph shows and held benefit auctions to raise money for many of his former baseball colleagues, and also organized baseball games for prison inmates while working as an alcohol counselor.

Wilmer Fields died of a heart ailment at his home in Manassas, Virginia. He was 81.

==Honors and acknowledgments==
In addition to his many awards during his playing days, Fields has received posthumous acknowledgment for his contribution to baseball.

In 2001 Fields received the honor of induction into the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame as part of their fifth class.

Then, in 2006 he was inducted into the Black Ice Hockey and Sports Hall of Fame along with 19 other Black athletes for his outstanding career in the Negro leagues.

<text>Dance in Quebec includes dances that are specific to the province of Quebec, Canada, it comprises traditional group, couple, and solo dance as well as contemporary jazz, ballet, and modern dance. There are a number of dance companies and dance schools. Quebec&#x27;s most renowned organizations are Les Ballets Jazz de Montréal, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montréal as well as the contemporary dance crew La La La Human Steps, directed by the choreographer Édouard Lock and his emblematic dancer Louise Lecavalier.

== Traditional ==
In the late 17th century, English country dances, contredances, cotillions, and minuets were popular. The most known dance was the bastringue. In the 18th century, reels and jigs were introduced to Quebec from the British Isles and British colonies in America.

Quadrilles and the waltz started appearing in the 19th century, along with step-dancing (called &quot;la gigue&quot; in Quebec) and polka. They also create a funny move called .

The tradition included galops.

Dancing had traditionally been monitored by the Catholic clergy of the province of Quebec, which often used its social and moral influence to ban dancing altogether in many villages and towns.

== Classical ballet ==
The very first classical ballet studios in the province of Quebec started appearing in 1945. In 1952, in Montreal, Ludmilla Chiriaeff established the &quot;Ballets Chiriaeff&quot;, which became Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in 1957. She then founded, in 1966, the Académie des Grands Ballets Canadiens, nowadays known as the École supérieure de ballet du Québec.

More recently, in 1989, Christiane Bélanger founded the &quot;Christiane Bélanger-Danse&quot; dance school in Quebec City. She also established the &quot;Compagnie Christiane Bélanger&quot; (2001), which would become the Ballet de Québec in 2005, the school thus being renamed École du Ballet de Québec in 2013, when she also started a college program in classical ballet at Cégep Garneau. &quot;Le Centre Uriel&quot; was also the first showcase specialized in classical Ballet in Quebec City. The &quot;Société de Ballet du Québec&quot; (2012) is dedicated to the promotion and development of internationally recognized professional classical Ballet in Quebec City. Christiane Bélanger co-founded, along with Jacques Marsa from the Opéra de Paris, the Competition Internationale de Ballet|Concours International PETIPA (May 2015), which was the first francophone international Ballet competition held in America. She dissociated herself from its co-founder in November 2012 and created the Compétition internationale de Ballet du Canada – volet Québec.

She also created the École de mécanique corporelle du Québec to help elite athletes improve their performances.

== Contemporary ==
Marie Chouinard, Benoît Lachambre, Ginette Laurin and the companies they created in Quebec, O Vertigo, D and PPS Danse are celebrated names in contemporary dance whose productions have spread internationally.
 founded the first dance company in Quebec City after the DansePartout company, founded by Chantal Bellhumeur and subsequently taken over by Luc Tremblay. The &quot;Compagnie Christiane Bélanger&quot; was established in 2001 and turned a corner to become exclusively dedicated to classical Ballet in 2005 ; it is now known as the Ballet de Québec. Christiane Bélanger was awarded the Prix François-Samson pour le Développement culturel in 2007 by the Conseil de la culture des régions de Québec-Chaudières Appalaches. Her style, which was referred to as neoclassical, was an extreme form of dance composed of a combination of martial arts, theatre and bold classical Ballet techniques from her classical Ballet experience.
There are many auditoriums promoting contemporary dance in the Province of Quebec. In Montréal, there are Agora de la danse, Danse-Cité, Tangente, the Maisons de la culture, Montréal art interculturel, Studio 303, Théâtre Lachapelle, Théâtre Gésu, Usine C, the Pierre-Mercure hall, Théâtre Maisonneuve and many others, while Quebec City hosts La Rotonde and the Méduse facility.
