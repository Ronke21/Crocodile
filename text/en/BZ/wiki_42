It is located near the mouth of the Kuantan River. Kuantan is the 14th largest city in Malaysia based on a 2020 population of 548,014 and the largest city on the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia.

==History==

Kuantan in the first century was a part of Chih-Tu empire. In the 11th century, this piece of land was conquered by another small empire called Pheng-Kheng before being taken over by the Siamese during the 12th century. During the 15th century, Kuantan was ruled by the Malaccan Empire.

Kuantan is said to have been founded in the 1850s. The name was notably mentioned in Munshi Abdullah&#x27;s travelogue &quot;Kisah Pelayaran ke Kelantan&quot; circa 1851/2:

In its early days, it was known as &quot;Kampung Teruntum&quot; (lit. &#x27;Lumnitzera Village&#x27;). The village was situated at the mouth of Teruntum River which is in front of the current hospital and it was established by Haji Senik and his followers in the 1850s. Early primary economic activities included fishing and small businesses. The main evidence of the establishment of the village is the cemetery that is situated near Taman Esplanade in front of the current Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan.

Towards the late 19th century, arrival of Chinese miners and traders saw the establishment of a township in Kuantan and nearby tin mining areas such as Gambang and Sungai Lembing. Similar to what occurred in other states in Peninsular Malaysia, rubber plantations attracted Indian settlers as well.

<text>Kangar (Kedah Malay: &quot;Kangaq&quot;) is the state capital and the largest town in Perlis, Malaysia. It has a population of 48,898 and an area of 2,619.4 ha. It is located next to the Thailand border, in the northernmost point of Peninsular Malaysia. It is situated by the Perlis River.

The town is also a gathering centre for the paddy rice production of the surrounding district. Its municipal government is unified with that of the neighbouring communities of Arau and Kaki Bukit. The centre of Kangar is Sena Province. The town is the smallest state capital in Malaysia and its inhabitants are mostly farmers and civil servants. Its industries include cement, saw milling, rubber, paper, and processing of sugar and prawns.

== History ==
Kangar existed from about 350 years ago, that is since 1653 when Kota Sena was built as the administrative centre for the 14th Sultan of Kedah, Sultan Muhyiddin Mansor Shah. Kangar was then a land port or &quot;pengkalan&quot; where boats and tongkangs anchor at the confluence of Perlis River, which runs through Kangar town to Kuala Perlis.

The name &quot;Kangar&quot; was derived from a type of tree. It was here at the port that trading was done, under a big tree that gave shade and respite to the traders. This tree that became a &quot;witness&quot; to many business deals was called &quot;Pohon Kangar&quot;. Every trader and merchant who came and went to this place began calling it the &quot;Pohon Kangar&quot; Port, in honour of the tree.

== Demographics ==
The majority of Kangar&#x27;s population speaks Perlis Malay which is a sub-dialect of Kedah Malay but also has its own unique features compared to those of neighbouring Kedah.

The Han Chinese, the second largest community in Kangar are primarily Hokkien speaking, with the language serving as the lingua franca of the city&#x27;s Chinese population. In addition, significant knowledge of Mandarin and English is also present amongst them.

Other languages spoken in Kangar includes Tamil, Telugu, Malayali as well as Punjabi and Hindi among the Kangar Indian population and Southern Thai by the Kedah-Siamese community.

==Places of interest==

<text>is a 2002 science fiction and romantic comedy anime television series directed by Yasunori Ide, written by Yōsuke Kuroda, and produced by Bandai Visual. It was later adapted into a manga and light novel and centers on a group of friends and the odd things that happen to them after they get a new teacher.

The &quot;Please Teacher!&quot; anime series premiered in Japan on the WOWOW satellite television network between January 10 and March 28, 2002, spanning a total of 13 episodes, including twelve originally premiering on television plus an OVA episode released on DVD on October 25, 2002. It was adapted very soon into a manga, serialized in MediaWorks&#x27;s shōnen manga magazine, &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot;, in January 2002, and was also later adapted into a light novel, entitled &quot;Onegai Teacher: Mizuho and Kei&#x27;s Milky Diary&quot;, published in March 2003.

The &quot;Please Teacher!&quot; anime series was soon continued with a spin-off sequel, &quot;Please Twins!&quot;, which premiered on WOWOW between July 15 and October 14, 2003.

The setting of the series, though left unsaid in either anime or manga, is Lake Kizaki, located in Nagano, Japan, and the region and its surrounding locations are featured prominently and accurately across the series. The novel states that the school the characters attend is the Nagano Prefectural Kizaki High School. This school is based upon the Old Matsumoto High School located in Agatanomori Park of Matsumoto, about an hour south of Lake Kizaki on the JR Ōito Line. The tower on which Kaede and Hyosuke stand upon can be found in Joyama Park on the northwest part of the city.

==Plot==
&quot;Please Teacher!&quot; is a story mainly revolving around a tight-knit group of friends in high school and how they cope with several life-changing events that are never too far off from intimate relationships. The main character is a boy named Kei Kusanagi who suffers from a very rare disease which causes a comatose state referred to as a &quot;standstill&quot; whenever he is under severe emotional distress.

Before the beginning of the story, Kei, at 15 years of age, had fallen into a &quot;standstill&quot; lasting three years after witnessing the suicide of his elder sister. After recovering, he quietly moved away from home in order to avoid social difficulty due to his long absence, and began living with his uncle, a medical doctor, and aunt. Due to the strange nature of how he came to live there, Kei wanted to keep the situation a secret from his new friends for fear of being ostracized as being too old to associate with them. After Kei had established himself in his new surroundings and had entered into a close group of mutually supportive friends, a Galactic Federation starship had entered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere stealthily, approached Honshū Island and landed surreptitiously in Lake Kizaki.

The story begins with Kei suffering a minor &#x27;standstill&#x27; while in the vicinity of the lake, witnessing several unexplainable phenomena happening there, and then watching as a beautiful half-human alien named Mizuho Kazami materialize beside the shore. Kazami was sent to observe planet Earth by a seemingly benevolent Galactic Federation in order to prevent humans from making developmental mistakes. Kei, upon observing the materialization, attempts to escape the pursuing Kazami. Kazami is under strict orders to prevent her true identity and mission from being discovered. During his attempt to escape, Kei falls into the lake. Kazami rescues Kei and, using information from his identification, is able to return him home in secret. The next day, Kazami has become Kei&#x27;s new homeroom teacher and next-door neighbor.

During assisting her in moving in, Kei suffers another standstill, and while in a weakened state explains his predicament to the compassionate Mizuho, who ends up revealing her own origins and purpose on Earth. Several accidental activations of Mizuho&#x27;s teleport technology (which were inadvertently caused by Kei) eventually place Kei and Mizuho in a couple of compromising situations in front of his uncle and aunt and his school&#x27;s headmaster, but Kei protects Mizuho from charges for an inappropriate relationship between student and teacher by impulsively stating that they are married, resulting in an actual civil marriage that later blossoms into genuine affection for each other. The headmaster relents, partly because he, too, had married a former student younger than himself and can understand their situation personally. Both are allowed to stay so long as they do not reveal their status to the other students, and do not engage in any public displays of affection.

The remainder of the series concerns the budding intimate relationships between the close friends, one of whom (Koishi Herikawa) is romantically interested in Kei, and another (Ichigo Morino) who has suffered even greater loss of time from the same disease as he has; the problems of having to maintain the secrecy of the marriage; an interfering parent and sibling visiting from the Galaxy Federation; and Kei learning to overcome the ever-present threat of another lengthy &#x27;standstill&#x27; stealing more of his life, particularly as he has fallen deeply in love with Mizuho and desperately wants to remain with her.

Eventually Kei falls into another major &quot;standstill&quot; and in order to bring him out of it, Mizuho has to use her technology which is against the law. As a result, her status on Earth is revoked, she is banned from the planet and all memory of her is erased from everyone&#x27;s, including Kei&#x27;s, minds. With the help of her mother and sister she sneaks back and is devastated to learn that Kei, who she is deeply in love with, has no memory of her. While helping her move back in, Kei reveals that his memory has returned and the two express their love for each other and get married again.

==Characters==
:
:Kei is an 18-year-old who retains a 15-year-old body after a three-year-long &quot;standstill&quot;, which is a coma-like state that occurs during a time of extreme emotional distress. Standstills are derived from an unknown, possibly psychological, disease that Kei and his friend Ichigo Morino have. He tends to be a very frail and shy boy, not often wanting to assert himself when need be.

:After observing the landing of a UFO while on the bank of the nearby lake and subsequently observing the alien on the lake shore, odd things begin happening to Kei in connection with this alien. The next day, Kei is surprised to find, like everyone else, that one of their teachers quit and a quick replacement was found which just happened to turn out to be the alien - Mizuho Kazami. After a few more encounters with each other, Kei is taken to her spaceship where the whole situation goes from bad to worse. Upon striking Marie, a tiny computer helper of Mizuho&#x27;s, it effectively is unable to perform as well as it seemed to work, which often puts the characters in strange situations if they cannot rely on the help of Marie.

:Eventually, after Kei and Mizuho are found in a locked storage room by Kei&#x27;s uncle and the principal of the school, his uncle impulsively tells the principal that Kei and Mizuho are married. Later, Kei and Mizuho do get married, though only the paperwork is done while there was no official ceremony. This whole situation is kept secret from Kei&#x27;s friends as Ichigo Morino constantly tries to pair Kei up with a friend of hers, Koishi, and all the while Kei and Mizuho&#x27;s relationship and attraction for each other only grows. Kei also appears occasionally in the sequel &quot;Please Twins!&quot;, but as cameos.
:
:Mizuho is a 23-year-old half-Earthling who is visually indiscernible from a regular human being. She is very attractive, which, while garnering the attention of the various male characters in the show, does serve to protect her secret. She comes to Earth to monitor the planet, but inadvertently she was seen by Kei just as she was landing. This leads to a catastrophic set of events that while nearly killing them both leads to a bond materializing between Kei and Mizuho. Although she did not trust him at first, she started to become attracted to Kei and eventually falls in love with him after they shared secrets about their past with one another. In a conversation with Mizuho&#x27;s younger sister Maho, Kei learns that she is the youngest member of the GF Observers ever to gain a license. She is stripped of her surveyor status in episode twelve after violating several key tenets of GF Law in order to save Kei. Also from Maho we learn that Mizuho apparently has never had a romantic relationship, which is verified when she admits as much to Kei.

:One of the main conflicts in the story involves Mizuho and how she tends to have great jealousy and misjudgment. While she underwent training prior to her arrival of Japanese and Earth history and customs, she was ill-prepared for dealing with the social interactions of adolescents. This trouble is further compounded by her initial, almost childlike, lack of understanding of romance. She even went to such great lengths as to spy on Kei while he was hanging out with a friend from school, Koishi Herikawa, in a set-up date. She does eventually realize her feelings for Kei once they begin living together and, at later points of the series, shows restraint and maturity that she at other times lacks. Mizuho&#x27;s character can almost be thought of as two personalities. The first of a well-mannered school teacher who is soft spoken and kind. The other, seen mostly with Kei and the Edajima&#x27;s is more outgoing, opinionated, and even violent on some occasions. This last point can be illustrated by the events of episode 13 where Mizuho&#x27;s mother held Kei hostage in a love hotel.

:She loves to eat Pochy, a Japanese snack food that consists of a biscuit stick covered with chocolate. She eats Pochy because it reminds her of her dead father; an empty box of Pochy was all Mizuho has left of him. Her mother and sister are also seen eating it in several episodes. Pochy is a fictional version of an actual snack known as Pocky. Her catch phrase is &quot;Saiyūsen jikō yo!&quot; (&quot;This is a priority one!&quot;). She also appears as a regular character in the same school in the sequel series &quot;Please Twins!&quot;
:
:She is one of Kei&#x27;s close friends who also pursues a romantic relationship with Kei. Her parents own a grocery store and she often has to go to deliver food that people ordered.

:Koishi has a happy-disposition to her personality and is only ever seen crying when it comes to matters that involve Kei. In time, she discovers that Kei has already committed his heart to someone else, and eventually grows close to her teacher Yamada, with whom she is eventually implied to have entered a romantic relationship on her own in episode 13. Also briefly appears as a cameo in &quot;Please Twins!&quot;
:
:An evidently shrewd young woman who is seemingly wise beyond her (apparent) years, and who associates with very few friends. Surprisingly, even though she resembles a diminutive 15-year-old or perhaps younger, her real age is 21; her physical development was stunted due to her &quot;standstills&quot;, in the same way that they affect Kei. She had been in a &quot;standstill&quot; for 6 years. Ichigo&#x27;s loss of time and her sense of life cruelly having passed her by due to the illness (she wistfully reveals to Kei that she has a younger sister who is now married and expecting a child) tends to cause her to have a much more cynical and serious demeanor than is normal for someone of her seeming age, which is sometimes commented upon by her (much younger) friends.

:Her keen mind causes her to suspect the too-often &#x27;coincidences&#x27; regarding their former teacher&#x27;s departure, the new one&#x27;s arrival and strange events in their neighborhood immediately after that to be connected, but her much younger and guile-less friends dismiss those connections. She also features in the sequel &quot;Please Twins!&quot; as a regular character, but with a much more mischievous behavior as class president and resembling a dictator, in fact the Morino&#x27;s attitude from &quot;Please Teacher&quot; is completely opposite from &quot;Please Twins&quot; seeming that she chose (thanks to Kei) to enjoy her live to the fullest even after the 6 years she lost, the first time she shows that mischievous behaviour is in the after-credits scene of the OVA where she reveals Kei&#x27;s relationships with Mizuho, Hatsuho, and Maho.
:
:Also one of Kei&#x27;s friends, Kaede tends to be a rather shy girl most of the time. Her physical characteristics include that she is one quarter Irish, tall (for a Japanese) and with red hair and freckles. Despite her shyness, during an accidental visit to her hotel room by a sleep-deprived Hyosuke, in which he mistakenly climbed into her bed, she awoke from a lightly inebriated slumber and claimed that he had appeared to her in a dream which now seems to have come true. She then sweetly confesses her love for him and proceeds to seduce him. The two become inseparable and are seen together throughout the series, to the point of being seen exiting a love hotel together in the OVA. Kaede also features in &quot;Please Twins!&quot; briefly.
:
:Hyosuke aspires to attend college at Tokyo University and become a professional statesman, much like his brother. Hyousuke&#x27;s demeanor is initially that of a shallow attention-seeker. Despite his negative attitude, he is a hard worker even impressing his friend by his high scores.
:He gets very confused after Kaede (half awake believing Hyosuke being a dream) sweetly confessed to him, he overcame that confusion thanks to Kei setting a meeting with her, unbeknown to him and even angering him to the point of almost hitting Kei, he manages to cool down himself in time and grants that his friend actually is doing the best for him, and he manages to talk to Kaede and after a minor hesitation they both proceed to start a relationship.
:After he becomes romantically involved with Kaede, a deeper and much more sensitive and reflective side is revealed. Kaede confirms to Ichigo and Koishi that the private Hyosuke is actually a very different person; of him, she says &quot;He&#x27;s a gentleman and he&#x27;s sweet.&quot; Of Kei&#x27;s group of friends, he tends to be the most hyperactive of them all and often does the strangest things too. Hyosuke also appears in &quot;Please Twins!&quot; briefly.
:
:A rather serious student who is also into astronomy, Matagu seems to be the most hopeless of the cast, a classic &#x27;nerd&#x27;, never even getting to the point of gaining a girlfriend by the end of the series. He is much less confident and self-assured than Hyosuke, or even Kei, leading one to conclude that he suffers from crippling shyness. His stated fondest dream is to meet with &#x27;an alien creature from outer space&#x27;, totally unaware of the fact that his teacher certainly qualifies as such, and that he has had several conversations with his life&#x27;s dream in a very normal setting. He even considered to confess his love to her, but his shyness put a halt to his plans. Matagu appears as a common comic relief character in &quot;Please Twins!&quot; He is portrayed as a pervert when his sister is around, who only appears in &quot;Please Twins!&quot;.
:
:Kei&#x27;s uncle and doctor of the local clinic. Minoru is something of a lecherous rogue, continually making wolfish comments regarding the attractiveness of passing women. He even does within earshot of his wife, who often retaliates with a measured degree of physical violence. He is openly jealous of Kei&#x27;s relationship with Mizuho and is more than a little perverted (in the Japanese sense of the word). Despite this, he often covers for and helps Kei and Mizuho out, such as moving Kei&#x27;s possessions into the married couple&#x27;s new apartment, purchasing a proper wedding ring for their private ceremony, and paying for an expensive hotel in Okinawa for their honeymoon.
:
:Kei&#x27;s aunt and nurse of the local clinic. A warm, kind-hearted and quite attractive woman who puts up with her husband&#x27;s behavior only so much before she starts to get really angry at him. It is evident that she is the more mature member of their pair, and is quite able to curb Minoru&#x27;s wayward eye and lecherous comments with a significant look or gesture. She is not above using a small degree of force to cause her husband to &#x27;heel&#x27; if his behavior gets too outrageous. She seems very sexually amorous towards her husband and loves him deeply. She is very supportive of Kei and Mizuho&#x27;s relationship, backing Minoru&#x27;s initial lie to the Headmaster about the couple being married, and then providing a second-hand wedding dress for Mizuho to wear in a private ceremony with only her, Mizuho, Kei and Minoru present.
:
:A quasi-organic master control program for Mizuho&#x27;s ship. Totally self-repairing and maintenance free. Hovers around in an inner tube and on occasion plays a miniature guitar. Due to Kei fearfully striking &#x27;him&#x27; during an initial escape attempt when Mizuho revealed her true identity, Marie&#x27;s programming became scrambled, endangering both Kei and Mizuho. Communicating partly through indistinct sounds and through gestures, Marie is essentially a portable link to the ship&#x27;s operating system. But &#x27;he&#x27; is also capable of emotion, as witnessed by the romantic relationship formed between &#x27;himself&#x27; and Miruru and his sorrow at their parting. Additionally, in the OVA they are implied to have sex, and both of them become embarrassed when they see others display affection. The implication provided in the series &#x27;extras&#x27; is that Marie and Miruru are but extensions of the ships themselves, and thus are the ships. Marie also appears in &quot;Please Twins!&quot;, often eating a different brand from Pochy, called &quot;Prech&quot;.
:
:A quiet and shaggy male teacher whose hobby is creating human-powered planes (one of which flies successfully in the final episode, earning him a trophy). At first he appears to be something of a physically developed nerd, obsessed with his hobby. Koishi delivers him meals from her parents&#x27; grocery store, and eventually both of them grow close; in episode 13 it is implied that they actually may have entered a romantic (and sexual) relationship. He trimmed his hair after Koishi states that he would be handsome if would do so, he forgets this after Mizuho gets forcefully removed from everyone memories after she is stripped of her rank still he remains his new neat look. Yamada appears occasionally in &quot;Please Twins!&quot;
:
:Mizuho&#x27;s little sister, who disapproves of Kei but eventually comes to accept him. Initially, she is incensed that a member of the powerful Galactic Federation&#x27;s elite Observers (which it is revealed that Mizuho has the honor of being its youngest member) would stoop to marry such an evident primitive (conveniently overlooking the fact that she is ostensibly the product of just such a union, claiming that the only time that she had ever seen Mizuho cry was when their father died; the implication of wildly different growth rates between alien and human are suggested here, as Maho is much younger-looking than Mizuho and Mizuho had stated that she could barely recall her father&#x27;s appearance). Maho even attempts to use Miruru to hurt Kei. During the process, she learns just how deeply Kei loves Mizuho and vice versa, and she relents, and later actually shows him a degree of affection with a stolen kiss, but she still possesses a playfully devious nature and is not above blackmailing Kei with videos of intercourse between him and Mizuho to get what she wants.
:Hatsuho even states that Maho is in love with Kei as she possibly look him like the ideal boyfriend.
:
:Mizuho&#x27;s and Maho&#x27;s widowed mother, who is very fond of Kei. She is a self-assured, bold but subtly assertive woman. She is not above playfully teasing her oldest daughter and son-in-law, demanding to know intimate details regarding their relationship. She greatly resembles Mizuho, with the exception of having purplish hair instead of pink, green eyes and a small beauty mark on her chin.

;: Mizuho&#x27;s, Maho&#x27;s father, Hatsuho&#x27;s late husband, and a Japanese astronaut; no image of him has ever been seen in the series. The 2009 Mars expedition ship he was a crew member of was presumed lost in space. However, a GF vessel rescued the crew, but the (never verified) implication was that he was not allowed to return to Earth. One of the crew of the GF spacecraft that rescued the Mars expedition was Hatsuho, which is how they came to meet and be married. Unable (or unwilling) to return to Earth, possibly due to the Federation&#x27;s strict laws governing contact with non-incorporated races, he remained in Federation space and raised a family there. The assumption is that he had attained citizenship, either through marriage or through naturalization, and at that point may have been abjured from returning. Eventually, he went on to develop a planetary contact program for Earth for the Galactic Federation. He died when Mizuho was still a child. The only thing of Earth that he had left behind had been an empty box of Pochy, which Mizuho had treasured.
:
:Another computer intelligence hologram and Maho&#x27;s sister, dressed in female-like clothing. The implication is that both Marie and Miruru are in fact commlinks for the ships, themselves. In other words, the ships house self-aware AIs capable of emotions, which are reflected in the actions of the two miniature beings. Seems also to be romantically involved with Marie. Like her counterpart, Miruru lacks human language, instead she utters &quot;Miru&quot; at random opposing to Marie&#x27;s high-pitched shriek-like cries.
:
:Kei Kusanagi&#x27;s elder sister. In a flashback which is shown during a critical &#x27;standstill&#x27;, it is revealed that Kozue was a very bright, though possibly mentally disturbed, girl who felt that human emotions were the cause of much suffering in the world, and sought to escape them by committing suicide, which Kei had the misfortune of witnessing. The trauma of having done so and the guilt that he had felt at being unable to prevent it led to his first &#x27;standstill&#x27;.
:
:Known as the little girl during the summer who finds a boy (Kei in this anime, Maiku in &quot;Please Twins!&quot;) who she quickly becomes attracted to. Soon after, she finds out the person she falls in love with already has a love interest. Her dog is then pulled on the neck by the leash when she staggers away broken-hearted. She also appears in &quot;Please Twins!&quot;

==Media==
===Anime===
The &quot;Please Teacher!&quot; anime series, authored and scripted by Yōsuke Kuroda, directed by Yasunori Ide, and produced by Bandai Visual, Studio Orphee and Daume, originally premiered in Japan on the satellite television network WOWOW, between January 10 and March 28, 2002, spanning a total of thirteen episodes, including twelve originally premiering on television plus an OVA episode concluding the series, released on DVD on October 25, 2002.

It has also been broadcast across Japan by the anime satellite television network, Animax, who have aired the series across its respective networks worldwide, including East Asia, Latin America, and as well as its English language networks in Southeast Asia and South Asia. The series has been licensed for North American distribution by Bandai&#x27;s distributive unit across the region, Bandai Entertainment, who have released the series via a four-volume DVD release, and whose English dub has also been broadcast by Animax across its English-language networks in Southeast Asia and South Asia. The series is now licensed by Right Stuf under their Nozomi Entertainment label.

The &quot;Please Teacher!&quot; anime series was soon continued with a spinoff, &quot;Please Twins!&quot;, which premiered on WOWOW between July 15 and October 14, 2003, featuring many of the characters featured in the series, as the series&#x27; story happens after &quot;Please Teacher!&quot;.

The series&#x27; opening theme is &quot;Shooting Star&quot; by Kotoko, and the ending theme is by Mami Kawada. The song by Kikuko Inoue is used as an insert song in episode 11, and the song &quot;Love a Riddle&quot; by Kotoko is used as the ending theme in episode 12.

An official AMV of the series was released as &quot;Snow Angel&quot;, the music is from the entry #6 of Kotoko&#x27;s album &quot;Stokesia&quot;.


===Manga===
&quot;Please Teacher!&quot; was adapted into a manga series, authored by Japanese manga artist Shizuru Hayashiya, which was serialized in MediaWorks&#x27;s manga magazine, &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot;, in January 2002, its run consisting of two-bound volume compilations. The manga has since been licensed for North American distribution by ComicsOne and in Brazil by Editora JBC, under the title &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot;.

The story maintains the basic plot, but adds comic humor that suits the manga format well, taking full advantage of still frames. However, there are quite a few minor details that have been omitted from the anime or were completely changed: the relationship between Hyosuke and Kaede is deflected, with Hyosuke ending up with Ichigo; Yamada is never introduced; Minoru is much more overt with his lecherousness, but is a great deal of help in Kei and Mizuho&#x27;s relationship; Koishi&#x27;s role is diminished somewhat; Hatsuho is only shown in only two frames, as a transmission call to the couple warning them of Maho&#x27;s wrath and in the other world when Kei has a standstill; and finally, the Okinawan honeymoon is never shown or mentioned.

===Light novel===
The light novel version entitled &quot;Onegai Teacher: Mizuho and Kei&#x27;s Milky Diary&quot; was written by Gō Zappa and illustrated by Taraku Uon and Hiroaki Gōda. It was published in Japan by MediaWorks in March 2003 and was only one volume in length. The English edition was released by Comics One in October 2003.

==Reception==
Critical reception of &quot;Please Teacher!&quot; has been generally positive.

Carlos Ross and Lauren Smoller of THEM Anime Reviews praised the series, giving the TV series 4 out of 5 stars, and 3 out of 5 stars for the OVA. Ross praised the animation, cast of characters, character designs and development, the opening track, the chemistry between Kei and Mizuho, but handed out criticism regarding the plot. He states that &quot;the plot does rely on a whole lot of circumstances and cliches that do get grating as the series goes on. While the accessory characters are often just as well characterized as the leads, you do get really sick of them popping up to interfere with the main relationship.&quot; Overall, Ross concludes that &quot;there are moments in this show that are pure magic. While its flaws prevent it from being the best of the best, this anime is very well worth watching and picking up the moment you see it on the shelf.&quot; Smoller handed out mild praise for the OVA&#x27;s animation, and the chemistry between the two main leads, but handed out criticism for the lack of a coherent plot, the jokes, and the supporting cast. She also notes that the OVA&#x27;s main target audience is for adults, stating that it is &quot;basically soft-core hentai.&quot;

Theron Martin of Anime News Network gave the series a B− rating, praising the soundtrack, animation, character designs and development, as well as the chemistry between Kei and Mizuho, but criticized the plot for being too cliched. He handed out mild praise for the English dub, stating that it sticks very closely to the original Japanese, and handed out good marks for Sandy Fox&#x27;s performance as Maho Kazami. Martin ultimately concludes that &quot;it is a mildly entertaining series with occasional strong points and some storytelling aspects which offer a different feel than most current romantic fare.&quot;

<doc id="737709" wikidata="Q28106789" url="?curid=737709" title="Falcated duck">
<text>The falcated duck or falcated teal (Mareca falcata) is a gadwall-sized dabbling duck from the east Palearctic (East Siberia and Mongolia to North Japan; wintering to India).

==Taxonomy==
The closest relative of this species is the gadwall, followed by the wigeons. The species was assigned to the proposed genus &quot;Mareca&quot; after its previous placement in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; was found to be paraphyletic in 2009.

There are many species that have mitochondrial DNA lineages that are phylogenetically intermixed with other species, but studies have rarely tested the cause of such paraphyly. In a study that was conducted, there were tested two hypotheses that could explain mitochondrial paraphyly of Holarctic gadwalls (&quot;Anas strepera&quot;) with respect to Asian falcated ducks (&quot;A. falcata&quot;). First, hybridization could have resulted in falcated duck mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) introgressing into the gadwall gene pool. Second, gadwalls and falcated ducks could have diverged so recently that mtDNA lineages have not sorted to reciprocal monophyly. They used coalescent analyses of three independent loci to distinguish between these two hypotheses. Two lines of evidence support introgression. First, analyses of the three loci combined show that some introgression is necessary to explain current genetic diversity in gadwalls. Second, they generated alternative predictions regarding time since divergence estimated from mtDNA: falcated ducks and gadwalls would have diverged between 65,000 and 700,000 years before present (ybp) under the introgression hypothesis and between 11,000 and 76,000 ybp under the incomplete lineage sorting hypothesis. The two independent nuclear introns indicated that these species diverged between 210,000 and 5,200,000 ybp, which did not overlap the predicted time for incomplete lineage sorting. These analyses also suggested that ancient introgression (similar to 14,000 ybp) has resulted in the widespread distribution and high frequency of falcated-like mtDNA (5.5% of haplotypes) in North America. This is the first study to use a rigorous quantitative framework to reject incomplete lineage sorting as the cause of mitochondrial paraphyly.

==Distribution and habitat==
The falcated duck breeds in eastern Asia. It nests in eastern Russia, in Khabarovsk, Primorskiy, Amur, Chita, Buryatia, Irkutsk, Tuva, eastern Krasnoyarsk, south central Sakha, Sakhalin, extreme northeastern North Korea and northern China, in northeastern Inner Mongolia, and northern Heilongjiang, and in northern Japan, Hokkaidō, Aomori, and the Kuril Islands. It is widely recorded well outside its normal range, but the popularity of this beautiful duck in captivity clouds the origins of these extralimital birds.

This dabbling duck is strongly migratory and winters in much of Southeast Asia. In India: Uttar Pradesh, Bihār, Assam, eastern Haryāna. Also in northern Bangladesh, northern and central Myanmar, northern Laos to the Mekong River, northern Vietnam (from about Hanoi north), and China: Hainan, Taiwan, Yunnan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, northern Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong, southern Hebei, Shanxi, northern Shaanxi. It is gregarious outside the breeding season and will then form large flocks.

It is estimated that there are about 89,000 falcated ducks in total; this is much higher than the previous population estimate of 35,000 worldwide.

During a survey done in Central China, a migratory area in the winter for the falcated duck, the numbers of animals sighted was minimal. In 2004 only 4 were recorded, and in 2005 only 10.

This is a species of lowland wetlands, such as water meadows or lakes, and usually feeds by dabbling for plant food or grazing.

The National Nature Reserves supported high proportions of eastern China&#x27;s populations of globally threatened Anatidae species (IUCN, 2009): 30% of the near threatened falcated duck (&quot;Anas falcata&quot;) populations. There is about twenty-seven percent of falcated duck species existing in the National Nature Reserves.

===Migration===
The falcated duck has a large range, with an estimated global extent of occurrence of .

The breeding range of the falcated duck is from eastern Siberia and Mongolia to northeastern China and northern Japan with wintering grounds in the northern part of southeast Asia to northeastern India. There have also been a small number of sightings of falcated ducks in western North America and Poland. However, these sightings have been attributed to vagrants and ducks that have escaped from captivity.

==Identification==
Males and females have similar lengths at . Their weight can range from , with males weighing more than their female counterparts. Wingspans range from . The breeding male is unmistakable. Most of the body plumage is finely vermiculated grey, with the long sickle-shaped tertials, which give this species its name, hanging off its back. The large head is dark green with a white throat, and a dark green collar and bronzed crown. The vent region is patterned in yellow, black and white.

The female falcated duck is dark brown, with plumage much like a female wigeon. Its long grey bill is an aid to identification. The eclipse male is like the female, but darker on the back and head. In flight both sexes show a pale grey underwing. The blackish speculum is bordered with a white bar on its inner edge. Young birds are buffer than the female and have short tertials.

Juveniles have plumage similar to females of the species.

These ducks are usually quiet except on breeding territory. The male duck has a shrill whistle &quot;tyu-tyu-vit…tyu-vit…tyu-tyu-vit&quot; (Dementiev and Gladkov 1952) and a quiet whistle ending with a wavering &quot;uit-trr&quot; (Flint et al. 1984). The female duck has a hoarse, quack, short two-syllable inciting call, and a high pitched, two to four syllable Decrescendo call (Lorenz and Von de Wall 1960).

==Behavior==
===Diet and role in ecosystem===
Falcated ducks have food habits generally consisting of small invertebrate and other insects as well as plant foods. They mainly eat vegetation or insects near to the water, consuming animals such as larvae, crustaceans, and mollusks. They likewise eat plant foods: leaves as well as seeds, grains, and nuts. Many assume that the falcated duck helps disperse seeds over large areas because of their diet. These ducks are primarily herbivorous. These ducks are hosts to a number of different parasites (ticks, fleas, lice) and thus carry diseases such as: the West Nile virus, avian influenza, avian pox, salmonellosis, staphylococcosis, and &quot;E. coli&quot;. Moreover, they carry viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoans that can be transferred to other creatures, for instance vertebrates and even humans.

===Breeding and life cycle===
The clutch is 6–10 eggs. Eggs are generally laid in late May. They have their nests on the ground in thick grasses, tussocks, swamped shrubbery, or hidden in deadwood. Usually the eggs are nested near water but have also been seen in small bushes approximately from the water. The eggs have a color of white with a pinkish yellow tint. Females incubate the eggs alone, 24–25 days in captivity. The males will leave the female during incubation.

Falcated ducks have a very intricate courtship ritual. Females perform a series of inciting calls and other movements while preening behind the wings of their targeted male. Males use a courting method similar to others in the Anas genus, including an introductory shake, a neck-stretching burp call, a grunt whistle, and a head-up-tail-up display. During the mating season the falcated ducks form monogamous pairs that last throughout the mating season.
It is not known how long the falcated duck lifespan is. There is also not much information on their territory size because these ducks are not studied as closely as other more popular species like swans or geese.

===Hybridization===
A fieldwork study at Hyo-ko Waterfowl Park, a nature preserve in Niigata, Japan, found what they presumed was a male hybrid of a falcated duck and a Eurasian wigeon. They have found these &quot;wild&quot; hybrids in several instances over the past few years. These birds shared morphological traits with both species. Still, most of the traits favored the falcated duck. It was reported that these hybrid birds have joined courting parties of Eurasian wigeon and even attempted to compete with wigeon males. Grunt-whistling, and burping calls being the method of inciting courtship, even resemble that of the falcated duck and not of the Eurasian wigeon. The hybrid bird most be closely watched, was quite sexually active, however, it is not yet known if they can reproduce with either of the female species.
Hybridization between two different species often leaves the offspring sterile, but this genus shows a surprising amount of hybrid fertility. This hybrid species performed courtship rituals more closely related to the falcated duck, yet socially was active in Eurasian wigeon flocks. Successful reproduction was not seen between the hybrid species and a pure Eurasian wigeon female during the fieldwork study. Further study of hybrid avian species can help shed light onto avian reproduction and their evolutionary biology.

==Conservation==
===Threats===
A primary threat to the falcated duck is hunting, as people want them for food and their feathers. Their habitat loss is also caused by the drainage of the wetlands. Although the overall population of the falcated duck is larger than once believed and is no longer classified as an endangered species, it is still considered &quot;near threatened&quot; on the IUCN&#x27;s (or the International Union for the Conservation of Nature&#x27;s) Animal Red List.

===Human influence on population===
The falcated duck requires coastal wetlands for its survival. One of the most ecologically sensitive areas in the world is the eastern end of Nanhui county, China, and is a site for the falcated duck during the migratory season. This area is crucial for the falcated duck due to its population being extremely low. Urbanization and economic growth of this area has led to a significant environmental disturbance in this area. A reclamation project to create artificial wetlands was started in 1999 and finished in 2005. Studies have been done to see if the artificial wetlands were as efficient as the natural ones, and although the artificial wetlands did see migratory shorebirds present, their population was not as high as the natural wetlands. Much more research needs to be done before the artificial wetlands can match the natural wetlands, and provide an acceptable habitat for the falcated duck.

Around the time of the harvesting seasons during the Chinese spring festival of winter in Nanhui County of Shanghai, China, the pond managers drain the water in the pond in order to catch fish for commercial purposes. Around that time, the pond was dominated by falcated ducks roosting there. After the pond is drained it remains dry until the following spring when water is replenished for fresh cultivation. The time that the water is replenished is very critical for migrant waterbirds in the spring. If the water is replenished too late then the dry pond is inapt for shorebirds and herons.

===Status and protection===
The falcated duck is currently in a state of near threatened on the IUCN&#x27;s Red List. They are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and their overall population seems to be (for the most part) stable and growing. Falcated duck populations are present in a number of wildlife preservers, national parks and other protected areas, and zoos.

===Proposed actions===
There are several proposed plans of action in protecting the falcated duck. Conservationists are keen to continue monitoring populations that have unfortunately stopped breeding, and plan to petition for hunting and shooting regulations on both the local and national level, respectively. Conservationists are also aware as to the great lack of education in regards to waterfowl extinction. For hunters who make a living off of either using the falcated duck as a food source or from simple sport hunts, conservationists are looking for alternative employment opportunities. Finally, conservationists hope to improve the management and coordination of already existing nature reserves where the falcated duck is present.

<doc id="737711" wikidata="Q2351287" url="?curid=737711" title="1996 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1996 Atlantic hurricane season had the most major hurricanes since 1950, which are Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The season was above-average, featuring a total of thirteen named storms, nine hurricanes, and six major hurricanes. The season officially began on June 1, 1996 and ended on November 30, 1996, dates which conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The season&#x27;s first tropical cyclone, Tropical Storm Arthur, developed on June 17, while the final cyclone, Hurricane Marco dissipated on November 26. The most intense hurricane, Edouard, was a powerful Cape Verde-type hurricane that affected portions of the Mid-Atlantic states and New England. The season featured nine tropical cyclone landfalls, including six hurricanes, one of which was a major hurricane. In total, six major hurricanes formed during the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season—the highest number produced in a single season since 1950.

The four most notable tropical cyclones of the season were hurricanes Bertha, Cesar, Fran, and Hortense. Bertha made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane on the coast of North Carolina, causing a total of 12 deaths and $335 million (1996 USD) in damage. Hurricane Fran made landfall in the same general area a little over a month later as a Category 3 hurricane, causing 37 deaths and $5 billion in damage. Hurricane Cesar developed in the east Caribbean during late-July, struck Nicaragua, then crossed into the Pacific as a tropical storm, at which time it was given the name Douglas. The system produced strong winds and flooding, leading to 113 deaths and $202.96 million in damage. Finally, Hurricane Hortense formed in the east Atlantic during the month of September and crossed Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, causing 39 direct deaths and $158 million in damage. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season caused $6.52 billion in damage and 256 deaths.

== Seasonal forecasts ==
=== Pre-season forecasts ===

Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU) and the Weather Research Center (WRC). A normal season, as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has 12.1 named storms, of these 6.4 reach hurricane strength, and 2.7 major hurricanes, which are Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson scale. Additional, the 1950-2000 CSU average for a normal season is 9.6 named storms, of these 5.9 reach hurricane strength, and 2.3 become major hurricanes.

In December 1995, CSU predicted that only 8 named storms would form and 5 of those would become hurricanes; no specific number of major hurricanes was given. However, in April 1996, CSU revised their forecast, stating that 11 named storms would develop, with seven of those intensifying into a hurricane, and three reaching major hurricane intensity. In June, CSU predicted 10 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes. The forecast by the WRC in early 1996 was 10 named storms and 6 hurricanes, though there was no prediction on the number of major hurricanes.

== Seasonal summary ==

The 1996 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, but the first named storm did not form until seventeen days later. It was an above average season in which 13 tropical cyclones formed, with all cyclones attaining tropical storm status. Nine of these sixteen attained hurricane status and six of those reached major hurricane status, which was well above the 1980–2010 average of 2.7 per season. Although there was neither an El Niño or a La Niña, the above average activity in the season was likely due to abnormally warm sea surface temperatures. Six hurricanes and three tropical storms made landfall during the season, causing 256 deaths and $6.52 billion in damage. Hurricane Edouard and Hurricane Marco also caused damage and fatalities, but neither storm made an official landfall. Additionally, the 1996 season was only the second on record in which more than one storm crossed between the Atlantic Pacific basins (Cesar and Dolly). This record would be tied again 26 years later in 2022.

Tropical cyclogenesis in the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season began with the development of Tropical Storm Arthur on June 17. In the month of July, two tropical cyclones formed, both of which later attained hurricane status. August was the most active month of the season, with a total of four storms developing in that period of time. The month of August also featured the strongest and costliest tropical cyclones of the season, Hurricane Edouard and Hurricane Fran, respectively. Although September is the climatological peak of hurricane season, only two tropical cyclones developed in that month. Despite this, both reached major hurricane status. Three tropical cyclones formed in October, with one attaining hurricane status. Finally, one tropical cyclone developed in November, Hurricane Marco. The storm lasted 10 days before dissipating on November 26.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index of 166. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding , which is the threshold for tropical storm strength.

== Systems ==
=== Tropical Storm Arthur ===
An area of increasing convection, possibly associated with a tropical wave, developed into Tropical Depression One on June 17 at 1800 UTC, while located near Grand Bahama. Initially, the depression moved north-northwestward and then northward around the western periphery of an Atlantic subtropical ridge. Despite moderately strong wind shear, the depression strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arthur while re-curving northeastward at 0000 UTC on June 19. About 24 hours later, Arthur made landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina with winds of . The storm weakened to a tropical depression early on June 20, before becoming extratropical the next day.

On June 18, a tropical storm warning was issued for coastal locations from Edisto Beach, South Carolina to Cape Lookout, North Carolina. Shortly thereafter, a tropical storm watch was issued north of Cape Lookout to the North Carolina/Virginia border, including Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds. The tropical storm watch was later extended from the North Carolina/Virginia border to Cape Charles, Virginia, including Virginia Beach. By late on June 19, all advisories were discontinued. One tornado touched down in Florida. As the center of Arthur passed east of Cape Romain, South Carolina, minor increases in surf were reported. In North Carolina, swells ranged as high as 7 ft (2.1 m). Rainfall peaked at around 5 inches (127 mm) in Georgetown, South Carolina, though because it fell gradually, no significant flooding was reported, other than minor ponding of water on roads. In addition, Arthur also brought precipitation to Georgia and Virginia, though the amounts of rainfall recorded rarely exceeded 3 inches (76 mm). Sustained winds of 46 mph (74 km/h) were reported, and offshore, the &quot;Atlantic Huron&quot; reported a sustained wind of 48 mph (77 km/h) at 1500 UTC on June 19, while located 35 mi (56 km) southeast of Arthur&#x27;s center. In addition, a C-Man station located about 34.5 mi (55.5 km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina reported sustained winds of 39 mph (64 km/h) and gusts up to 45 mph (75 km/h). Overall, damage caused by Arthur was minimal, totaling only $1 million (1996 USD).

=== Hurricane Bertha ===
A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Two at 0000 UTC on July 5, while located about east of Cape Verde. Twelve hours later, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bertha. Over the next few days, it continued to strengthen, becoming a hurricane on July 7, prior to moving through the northern Leeward Islands. A period of rapid intensification began late on July 8, with Bertha peaking as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of on the following day. Moving around the western periphery of a subtropical ridge, Bertha passed north of the Bahamas as a weakening hurricane before turning towards the north-northeast and re-strengthened. Late on July 12, Bertha made landfall between Wrightsville Beach and Topsail Beach, North Carolina with winds of . Gradual weakening ensued the following day as Bertha moved up the Mid-Atlantic states and into New England before becoming extratropical on July 14.

In the United States Virgin Islands, heavy rainfall and hurricane-force winds damaged about 2,500 homes, of which 43 lost their roofs. Many boats were destroyed. Total damage was estimated near $7.5 million. The storm caused 3 deaths in Puerto Rico. Additionally, damage in Puerto Rico totaled $7.5 million. Two deaths were confirmed in Saint Martin. The storm caused numerous power outages and damaged 10 homes in Antigua and Barbuda. Four deaths occurred in Florida, three of which due to rip currents. North Carolina bore the brunt of the hurricane in the United States. Storm surge destroyed several fishing piers, marinas, and boats. A combination of storm surge and strong winds damaged over 5,000 homes and buildings, with at least 4 destroyed. There were 2 deaths in the state. The remnants brought local flooding and minor wind damage to the Mid-Atlantic, New England, and Atlantic Canada. One surfer died in New Jersey. Overall, the storm caused 12 deaths and about $285 million in damage, primarily in eastern North Carolina.
=== Hurricane Cesar ===
A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on July 17. It developed into Tropical Depression Three near Isla Margarita of Venezuela on July 24. The depression headed westward, steered by a strong high pressure area over the Bahamas. On July 25, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Cesar. Around that time, it struck Curaçao. Cesar caused minor damage in the ABC islands to roofs and trees; one person drowned in heavy surf on Curaçao. An additional three people drowned offshore Venezuela. In Colombia, heavy rainfall caused 3 deaths, 2 of which were from a mudslide in Pueblo Bello. Strong winds and significant amounts of precipitation lashed the Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina, unroofing 60 homes, and resulting in 11 fatalities, and resulting in 800 million COP ($440,00 USD) in damage. The storm continued westward and intensified into a hurricane on July 27.

At 0400 UTC on July 28, Cesar made landfall near Bluefields, Nicaragua, with winds of . After weakening to a tropical storm later that day, Cesar moved into the Pacific and was reclassified as Tropical Storm Douglas on July 29. In Nicaragua, the storm wrought about $50.5 million in losses. More than 2,500 homes, 39 bridges and of roads were destroyed. The storm killed 42 people and left an estimated 100,000 homeless in Nicaragua. In Costa Rica, river flooding damaged or destroyed 3,874 homes; 150 bridges were also destroyed. The road network was significantly damaged. Across the country, at least 39 people were killed and damage amounted to $151 million. Additionally, 12 people died in El Salvador. Overall, Cesar caused 113 deaths and $202.96 million in damage.
=== Hurricane Dolly ===
A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Four at 0600 UTC on August 19, while located west-southwest of Jamaica. The system strengthened into Tropical Storm Dolly about twelve hours later. Dolly headed westward and intensified into a Category 1 hurricane late on August 20. It then made landfall near Chetumal, Quintana Roo with winds of . The system weakened to a tropical depression on August 21. Later that day or early on August 22, Dolly emerged into the Bay of Campeche and quickly re-strengthened into a tropical storm. The storm deepened further and was upgraded to a hurricane again at 1200 UTC on August 23; Dolly simultaneously peaked with winds of . Around that time, it struck between Tuxpan, Veracruz and Tampico, Tamaulipas. Dolly quickly weakened to a tropical depression early on August 24, but remained intact while crossing Mexico and dissipated over the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 25.

The storm brought heavy rainfall to much of Mexico, peaking at . In Quintana Roo, flooding destroyed a large amount of farmlands. Widespread flooding occurred after a river in the Pueblo Viejo area overflowed its banks. Hundreds of homes were destroyed, displacing about 35,000 people. Large scale evacuations occurred in San Luis Potosí, while about 6,500 fled their homes in the Tampico area. Communications and power outages were reported as far west as Mazatlán, Sinaloa. Throughout Mexico, there were fourteen fatalities reported, six in Veracruz, three in Nuevo León, and one in Monterrey. Additionally, two people were left missing in Nuevo León. The outer bands of Dolly brought rainfall to southern Texas, which caused minor flooding, but was mostly beneficial due to drought conditions in the state.
=== Hurricane Edouard ===
A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Five on August 19, while located about southeast of Cape Verde. The depression moved westward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Edouard on August 22. Further intensification occurred, with the storm being upgraded to a hurricane on the following day. Early on August 24, the storm re-curved west-northwestward and began to undergo rapid deepening. At 0600 UTC on August 25, Edouard attained its maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of ; it was the most intense tropical cyclone of the season. The storm remained a major hurricane for nearly eight days. Edouard passed well north of the Lesser Antilles and then began re-curving northward on August 29. Later, the storm passed midway between Cape Hatteras and Bermuda on September 1.

Edouard approached Nantucket, Massachusetts, but turned to the east before reaching land. On September 3, the storm weakened and became extratropical. It was absorbed by a larger system on September 7. Edouard brought rough seas and gusty winds along the East Coast of the United States from South Carolina northward. Strong waves in New Jersey drowned 2 people. Minor erosion and coastal flooding also occurred in several states, especially in New York and Massachusetts. In the latter, wind gusts up to left two-thirds of Nantucket, most of Cape Cod, and all of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard without electricity. Gusty winds in Maine left about 1,900 without power in Portland. Damage in the United States totaled about $20 million. In Canada, the storm brought rainfall up to and gusts to . Rough seas disrupted ferry service and caused the closure of several beaches.
=== Hurricane Fran ===
A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Six on August 23, while located southeast of Cape Verde. The depression moved westward for several days and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fran on August 27 while east of the Lesser Antilles. Fran tracked west-northwestward and intensified into a hurricane on August 29. However, Fran became less organized after a disruption to inflow due to Hurricane Edouard and weakened back to a tropical storm. Fran quickly re-intensified into a hurricane by August 31. While moving west-northwestward and then north-northwestward, the storm slowly strengthened. At 0000 UTC on September 5, Fran peaked as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Early on the following day, the storm made landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina at the same intensity. Fran weakened and moved inland, becoming extratropical over Ontario on September 8. Its remnants moved over the Great Lakes and were absorbed by a front on September 10.

In South Carolina, the outer bands of Fran produced high winds and light to moderate rainfall, downing numerous trees and power lines. As a result, a number of cars were damaged and over 63,000 people were left without electricity. Damage in South Carolina reached about $40 million. The state of North Carolina bore the brunt of the storm. Wind gusts as strong as were reported. Additionally, storm tide heights ranging from lashed the coast. Damage was most severe in the Raleigh area, exceeding $2 billion. Several hundred thousand falling trees damaged at least 10,000 homes. Throughout the state, approximately 1.7 million people were left without electricity. Damage in North Carolina reached about $5.1 billion, with about $2.3 billion to homes and businesses, $1.1 billion to public property, $1 billion to forestry and timber, and $700 million to agriculture. Elsewhere, Fran brought flooding to several states, including Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, as well as Washington, D.C. Outside North Carolina, effects were worst in Virginia, where flooding and winds left 400,000 people without electricity and caused about $350 million in damage. Hurricane Fran was responsible for 37 deaths, with 24 of them in North Carolina. Property damage in the United States was estimated at $5 billion.
=== Tropical Storm Gustav ===

An area of disturbed weather, accompanied with a low-level circulation, emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on August 24. It organized further over the next few days, becoming Tropical Depression Seven on August 26, while located about south of Cape Verde. With a ridge to its north, the system moved west-southwestward. Conditions were initially unfavorable for development due to outflow from Hurricane Fran. On August 28, the depression began moving northwestward due to an approaching trough. Around the same time, the influence from Fran decreased, allowing it to intensify into Tropical Storm Gustav on August 28.

At 0000 UTC on August 29, Gustav reached its peak intensity as a and a minimum barometric pressure of . Thereafter, the trough previously causing the storm&#x27;s northwestward motion transitioned into an upper-level low, increasing shear across the region. As a result, the storm slowly weakened and was downgraded to a tropical depression late on September 1. Gustav dissipated at 0600 UTC on the following day, while situated about east-northeast of the northernmost Lesser Antilles.
=== Hurricane Hortense ===
A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Eight on September 3, while located about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. The depression headed westward and barely strengthened until becoming Tropical Storm Hortense early on September 7. Hortense passed over Guadeloupe on the following day and entered the Caribbean Sea. It strengthened into a hurricane on September 9 and then curved northwestward. The storm intensified slightly further, before making landfall near Guánica, Puerto Rico with winds of at 0600 UTC on September 10. It soon moved back offshore and brushed Dominican Republic while crossing the Mona Passage. After re-entering the Atlantic, Hortense substantially strengthened and peaked as a Category 4 hurricane early on September 13. Thereafter, the storm weakened as it tracked rapidly north-northeastward. Early on September 15, Hortense made landfall in Nova Scotia as a minimal Category 1 hurricane. It quickly weakened further to a tropical storm before re-entering the Atlantic and became extratropical later that day.

The storm produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds as it passed through the Lesser Antilles. On Guadeloupe, damage was most significant to crops, with over 50% of banana plantains destroyed. Localized flooding was reported on Martinique. Impact was most significant in Puerto Rico. Across the island, 11,463 houses were severely damaged. About 1.4 million people on Puerto Rico were left without electricity – equivalent to about 40% of the island&#x27;s population. Damage in Puerto Rico was estimated at $153.4 million. There were also 19 deaths, most of which due to drowning during flash floods. In the Dominican Republic, strong winds damaged a number of buildings and houses, and downed several power lines. Flooding also forced the closure of several roads and impacted 80% of crops in Samaná Province. At least 3 fatalities were confirmed in that country. The storm brought strong winds to the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands, and lesser winds to Bermuda. Later in its duration, Hortense struck Nova Scotia, bringing heavy rainfall and hurricane-force winds to isolated locations. There were many power outages, trees blown down, roofs torn away, and roads damaged in the province. New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island were also impacted, though not as severely as in Nova Scotia. Damage in Atlantic Canada reached approximately $3.64 million.
=== Hurricane Isidore ===

A tropical wave with a well-defined circulation developed into Tropical Depression Nine at 1200 UTC on September 24, while located south of Cape Verde. Due to an anticyclone to its north, the depression initially moved west-northwestward. After convection wrapped around the circulation and banding features increased, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Isidore on September 25. Isidore deepened further and began developing an eye feature. Early on September 26, the storm was upgraded to a hurricane. About 24 hours later, it reached Category 2 intensity. At 0000 UTC on September 28, Isidore attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of 960 mbar (hPa; 28.35 inHg).

After reaching peak intensity on September 28, steering current from a quasi-stationary mid- to upper-level low pressure area turned Isidore northward. Later that day, the eye feature disappeared and the storm began weakening due to strong upper-level winds. On September 28, Isidore weakened to a Category 2 hurricane. By the following day, it was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. Early on September 30, Isidore weakened to a tropical storm. The storm deteriorated further and was downgraded to a tropical depression at 1200 UTC on the following day. Because much of the deep convection diminished, Isidore was declared extratropical at 0000 UTC on October 1, while located about west-southwest of Flores Island in the Azores.
=== Tropical Storm Josephine ===
Tropical Depression Ten developed from the remnants of a cold front in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on October 6. Moving generally eastward, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Josephine on October 6. The next day, it peaked with winds of . Josephine made landfall in Taylor County, Florida near peak intensity early on October 8. Shortly after moving inland, the storm became extratropical. Early in its duration, the system interacted with a ridge, resulting in strong winds and high tides in Texas. The outer bands caused flooding rainfall in southern Texas, and in Louisiana, high tides flooded roads and stranded residents on Grand Isle. In Florida, the storm produced a storm surge reaching in Suwannee. High tides flooded about 3,600 houses along the west coast. Strong winds left about 400,000 people without power. The storm also spawned at least 16 tornadoes, one of which damaged 130 homes.

The extratropical remnants of Josephine moved along the eastern coast of the United States, producing wind gusts as strong as in St. Mary&#x27;s County and in Ocean City, Maryland. The winds caused widespread power outages, including 26,000 in Virginia and 31,000 in New Jersey. Heavy rainfall flooded low-lying areas and rivers along the storm&#x27;s path, including in North Carolina which had previously been affected by hurricanes Bertha and Fran earlier in the year. In the Southeastern United States, the storm contributed to dozens of traffic accidents, which killed a person each in Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia. Damage throughout the United States totaled about $130 million. Josephine later moved offshore, and after passing southeast of Cape Cod, moved through Atlantic Canada with moderate rainfall and gusty winds.
=== Tropical Storm Kyle ===

A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on September 27 and crossed the Atlantic and Caribbean before eventually developing into Tropical Depression Eleven on October 11. The depression drifted slowly southwestward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Kyle later that day. Slightly further intensification occurred and Kyle peaked as a tropical storm early on October 12. However, upper-level southwesterly shear caused Kyle to quickly weaken back to a tropical depression later that day. At 1800 UTC on October 12, Kyle made landfall in eastern Guatemala with winds of . By early on October 13, the storm had completely dissipated inland.

Portions of the coasts of Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico were under a tropical storm warning or hurricane watch as Kyle was approaching; however they were cancelled after Kyle weakened back to a tropical depression. Impact from Kyle was minimal and limited to light rainfall in the countries of Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. In Belize, rainfall peaked at . Rainfall to the northwest of the center of Kyle was heavier, with some areas of Mexico&#x27;s Yucatán Peninsula receiving over ; precipitation peaked at in Tulum.
=== Hurricane Lili ===
A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Twelve on October 14. After the storm formed, further strengthening of Lili was gradual, first to tropical storm status on October 16 and then to hurricane status on October 17. The next day, Lili made landfall in Matanzas Province, Cuba with winds of and moved across the central portion of the island; it was first hurricane to hit the country since Kate in 1985. After emerging into the Atlantic Ocean, the hurricane accelerated northeastward, briefly peaking as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of near the Bahamas on October 19. For almost an entire week, Hurricane Lili oscillated in intensity while fluctuating several times in forward speed. About two weeks passed before Lili transitioned into an extratropical storm north of the Azores on October 27, which subsequently moved across Ireland and Great Britain.

Early in its duration, Lili caused flooding in Central America that left thousands homeless and killed 14 people. In Cuba, 269,995 people were evacuated in advance of Lili, resulting in no deaths in the country. Damage was heaviest in Cuba, mostly due to the hurricane&#x27;s heavy rainfall peaking at . The hurricane affected 11 Cuban provinces, damaging 92,542 houses and destroying another 6,369. The rains heavily damaged the sugar cane and banana crops. Overall, damage in the country was estimated at $362 million. In nearby Florida, one person died after being swept into a drain during the storm&#x27;s heavy rains. Moisture from Lili also fueled a storm that struck the northeastern United States, which contributed indirectly to a death when a man in Maine tried to drive across a flooded roadway. Damage in the Bahamas was not severe and was limited to some damaged roofs and downed trees. When the remnants of Lili struck Ireland and the United Kingdom, it produced strong winds and high seas that damaged hundreds of houses, causing $300 million in damage and six deaths.
=== Hurricane Marco ===
A cold front interacted with several tropical waves, eventually spawning Tropical Depression Thirteen late on November 16, while southwest of Jamaica. Initially a tropical depression, it remained weak while tracking southwestward and eventually southward. On November 19, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Marco. It re-curved eastward and continued to strengthen, briefly becoming a hurricane on November 20. Marco weakened back to a tropical storm later that day. The storm turned northeastward toward Hispaniola, but later became stationary before curing eastward. Afterwards Marco doubled-back to the west. After weakening to a tropical depression on November 23, Marco became a tropical storm again on the following day. Thereafter, it tracked northwestward while fluctuating in intensity, before dissipating on November 26.

Although it did not make landfall, Marco produced heavy rainfall in the Greater Antilles and Central America, which caused significant flooding in some areas. In Honduras, 4,000 homes were destroyed, 40 bridges washed away, and nearly 50,000 acres of fruit plantations were flooded. Nine deaths were also reported. Flood damage in other Central American countries was also reported, though affects were less severe. Heavy rainfall was also reported in Cuba. Marco also contributed to an ongoing flood in Jamaica and caused three additional fatalities in Dominican Republic. Overall, Marco caused 15 fatalities and approximately $8.2 million in damage.
===Other system===
On September 13, a rare low-pressure area moved into Lake Huron where it gained subtropical characteristics. It reached its peak intensity of and a central pressure of , before making landfall in southwestern Ontario and dissipating soon afterward. The cyclone was dubbed &quot;Hurricane Huron&quot;, as it maintained subtropical characteristics while situated over Lake Huron. The Lake Huron cyclone caused heavy rainfall and flooding across Michigan and Eastern Canada, as well as parts of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and the Northeast Coast.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1996. This is the same list used for the 1990 season, with the exceptions of &quot;Dolly&quot; and &quot;Kyle&quot;, which replaced &quot;Diana&quot; and &quot;Klaus&quot;, respectively. The name &quot;Dolly&quot; was previously used under the old naming convention. A storm was named &quot;Kyle&quot; for the first time this year.

=== Retirement ===

In the spring of 1997, the World Meteorological Organization retired the names &quot;Cesar&quot;, &quot;Fran&quot;, and &quot;Hortense&quot; from the Atlantic hurricane name lists. They were replaced with &quot;Cristobal&quot;, &quot;Fay&quot;, and &quot;Hanna&quot; for the 2002 season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration (within the basin), peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1996 USD.

<text>&quot;Second Class Male&quot; and &quot;Time to Go&quot; were a series of 12 spoof newspaper columns written by Chris Morris and Robert Katz under the pseudonym Richard Geefe in &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1999.

&quot;Second Class Male&quot; was a feature column written by a handsome though ineffectual sort who has a lack of luck in life. After the sixth article, the writer of the column decides that on a certain date he will commit suicide, and the rest of his columns, retitled &quot;Time To Go&quot;, will be written about the state of mind of someone knowing they are going to die on a particular date. The last article, consisting of accounts by Geefe&#x27;s dinner party guests on the night of his death, was published after Morris&#x27;s co-authorship had been revealed.

The articles were presented as fact and not as a Chris Morris production, although the premise was very similar to a monologue from his &quot;Blue Jam&quot; radio programme, titled &quot;Suicide Journalist&quot; on the &quot;Blue Jam&quot; compilation CD. The last pseudonymous column included a man speared by frozen urine and a suicide by repeated jumps from a first floor window, both situations from earlier work by Morris.

The series attacked what some saw as the self-absorption of columnists writing about personal and domestic matters, and the quasi-fashion for columns about dying typified by those written by John Diamond and Ruth Picardie. 

According to the IMDb a 7-minute short film (titled &quot;Second Class Male&quot;) based on the second column (in which Geefe gets locked out of his flat) was made in 2006.

<text>Cleisthenes ( ; ) was the tyrant of Sicyon from , who aided in the First Sacred War against Kirrha that destroyed that city in 595 BC. He was also said to have organized a successful war against Argos because of his anti-Dorian feelings. After his victory he abolished all the rhapsodes of Homer, because they praised the citizens of Argos. The key innovation of his reign, which Herodotus mentions, was the reformation of the tribal system in the city of Sicyon. Herodotus states that he gave new names to the four tribes of Sicyon, calling his own tribe &quot;Rulers of the People&quot; and naming the other three tribes after swine, donkeys, and pigs. However, Herodotus does not describe the nature of Cleisthenes&#x27; reform. Whatever it was, all the tribes kept their new names for sixty years after Cleisthenes&#x27; death.

Cleisthenes of Sicyon organized a competition whose prize would be marriage to his beautiful daughter Agariste. The two main competitors were the Alcmaeonid Megacles and Hippocleides. Because Hippocleides made a fool of himself by dancing drunkenly in front of Cleisthenes, Megacles was chosen to marry Agariste.

Descendants of Cleisthenes include his grandson Cleisthenes of Athens and his great-granddaughter Agariste, mother of Pericles of Athens.

His death is estimated around 570 or 545 BC.

<text>USS &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; (LHA-3), nicknamed &quot;Devil Dog&quot;, was an amphibious assault ship and the second ship named after the World War I Battle of Belleau Wood. Her keel was laid down on 5 March 1973 at Pascagoula, Mississippi, by Ingalls Shipbuilding. She was launched on 11 April 1977, and commissioned on 23 September 1978.

&quot;Belleau Wood&quot; was the third of five ships in a new class () of general-purpose amphibious assault ships, which combined into one ship type the functions previously performed by four different types: the landing platform helicopter (LPH), the amphibious transport dock (LPD), the amphibious cargo ship (LKA), and the dock landing ship (LSD). She was capable of landing elements of a United States Marine Corps battalion landing team and their supporting equipment by landing craft, helicopters, or a combination of both.

==Operational history==
Homeported at Naval Base San Diego, California beginning in October 1978, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; participated in her first full-scale operation in 1979 off the coast of Hawaii. In early 1979, she reported to Long Beach Naval Shipyard in Long Beach, California for a one-year engine overhaul.

&quot;Belleau Wood&quot; began her first major deployment in January 1981. The ship rescued 150 Vietnamese refugees on April 21, 1981, earning the crew the Humanitarian Service Medal. The deployment included three major exercises and nine port visits to include Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Diego Garcia and Australia. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; crossed the equator into the southern hemisphere on May 9th, 1981. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; returned to San Diego in August 1981.
August 1982 marked the ship&#x27;s second deployment where she participated in four major amphibious exercises in the Philippines, Thailand, Somalia, and Australia - including Valiant Usher; Team Spirit and Jade Tiger 83 and eleven port visits. Ports visited were Honolulu, Hawaii (2 times); Hong Kong; Subic Bay, Philippines (2 times); Singapore (2 times); Phuket, Thailand; Diego Garcia; Barbara, Somalia; and Perth, Australia. The ship returned to San Diego in February 1983. She went to an extensive yard period in Naval Station Long Beach for almost eight months from early March to late October 1983. Her third successful deployment ran from January 1984. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; joined numerous major amphibious exercises in Hawaii, Korea, and the Philippines. The ship visited twelve ports including Honolulu, Hawaii (2 times); Hong Kong (2 times); Subic Bay, Philippines (2 times); Yokosuka, Japan; Singapore; Pohang and Pusan, South Korea and Phuket, Thailand. She returned to homeport in mid-July 1984.

The ship then completed an 11-month complex overhaul at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington from March 1985 to February 1986. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; then traveled to her home base at Naval Station San Diego. After completing numerous exercises in 1986, the ship received the Battle-E, for Battle Readiness and was ready for deployment.

In January 1987, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; got underway for her fourth deployment. The crew participated in four major exercises, including the first winter amphibious exercises conducted off the Aleutian Islands in the Bering Sea since World War II, and introduced the ship to the AV-8B Harrier &quot;jump jet&quot;. The ship also received the Admiral Flatley Memorial Award for Aviation Safety in 1987.

Whilst in the Bering Sea, the ship and crew battled seas sailing through an area where two cyclones had merged. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; received extensive damage from the storm which led to an extended stay in the naval shipyards at Subic Bay. Other ports of call during the deployment included Okinawa, Japan; Pohang and Pusan; Pattaya Beach, Thailand, and Phuket.

After the Crossing the Line Ceremony at the Equator, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; lost power as both engines and one of the two generators stopped, causing her to drift for five days at sea and have to be towed by . Destined for Tasmania, she limped into Sydney Harbor for repairs to the boilers while &quot;Anchorage&quot; replaced her off Tasmania. Both the &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; and Battle Groups sailed into Sydney Harbour. After which, the Battle Groups participated with the Australian Navy in exercises.
&quot;Belleau Wood&quot; underwent repairs at the Long Beach Naval Ship Yards during 1987–1988. In January 1989, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; departed for the Western Pacific. Over the next five months, the ship participated in Exercise Team Spirit 89 in Korea and Exercise Valiant Usher in the Philippines and Korea. On 4 October, the ship hosted the Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union during his historic visit to the United States.

&quot;Belleau Wood&quot; entered her second complex overhaul at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard in 1990. Major work included an upgrade to CIWS and installation of the Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) system. On 31 August 1992, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; sailed out of San Diego, bound for her new homeport in Sasebo, Japan. During this transit, the ship provided disaster relief to the people of Kauai, Hawaii after Hurricane Iniki ravaged the island. For this, the crew was awarded its second Humanitarian Service Medal. On arrival in Japan, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; joined Amphibious Group 1 and Amphibious Squadron 11, and became the world&#x27;s only forward-deployed large-deck amphibious ship.

On the night of 27 October 1992, two members of the &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; crew murdered a fellow crew member in a public park just outside the Sasebo Naval Base in what was later described as one of the most horrific homophobic acts in US naval history. The murder and subsequent cover-up by the United States Navy became one of the strongest arguments forcing the US Department of Defense to implement the &quot;Don&#x27;t ask Don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy pertaining to openly gay men and women serving in the US military. The murder of the crew member and the subsequent collective punishment implemented by the replacement commanding officer led to a diminished ability of &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; as a naval asset. Following the exposé published in Esquire Magazine relating to the murder and collective punishment by the new commanding officer, the ship was given the moniker of the &quot;Prison Ship Belleau Wood&quot; by many of the ship&#x27;s crew. It was the first murder of this kind in the city of Sasebo for nearly 90 years.

On 24 November 1992, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; became the last ship to sail out of the Philippines while conducting the final withdrawal of U.S. forces from Subic Bay Naval Base and Naval Air Station Cubi Point.

Following her move to Japan, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; became a familiar sight at joint military exercises such as Valiant Usher in Australia, Team Spirit in Korea, Cobra Gold in Thailand, and Tandem Thrust near Guam (originally in Australia). &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; also became the first large-deck Navy ship to undergo pierside maintenance by COMLOGWESTPAC in Singapore.

From January to April 1995, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; served as the Command Platform for Operation United Shield. In 1996, the &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; was one of several naval movements involved in the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis.

&quot;Belleau Wood&quot; was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping task force from 5 to 28 October 1999.

In July 2000, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; took part in the largest crew swap to date when she was relieved as a forward-deployed amphibious assault ship. The procedure started when arrived in Sasebo on 13 July 2000. The swap was part of a planned rotation of forward-deployed naval forces in Japan and was the third crew-swap exchange. The ships’ crews simply switched ships, minimizing the impact of moving families from homeport to homeport. Sailors in Sasebo assigned to &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;, moved on to &quot;Essex&quot;, while sailors from San Diego assigned to &quot;Essex&quot; moved aboard &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; and the San Diego–based crew then returned to San Diego in mid-August to begin overhaul and maintenance cycles.

From 17 January to 16 June 2001 &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; conducted a five-month dry dock planned maintenance availability, during which time she had a fifth air conditioning system installed, upgraded collection holding and transfer systems, and revamped combat system and intelligence suites.

On 15 June 2002, the ship deployed to the Indian Ocean in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. While deployed, she participated in exercises Infinite Moonlight in Jordan and Eager Mace in Kuwait. She also provided humanitarian assistance off the east coast of Djibouti in October and off East Timor in November before returning to San Diego on 15 December. During 2002, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; was the backdrop for the making of the movie &quot;Antwone Fisher&quot;.
On 22 January 2003, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; entered the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company Shipyard at San Diego for a complex overhaul that lasted till 8 October 2003. In November 2003, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; was the site of another first when Brigadier General Joseph V. Medina took command of Expeditionary Strike Group Three, of which &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; was the flagship. This event marked the first time in history that a United States Marine Corps officer took command of a naval flotilla.

In July 2004, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; lead the amphibious ready group that transported the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit to Kuwait and disembarked the Marines. After months of sailing in the Persian Gulf, the ships returned to San Diego without the Marines who later flew back to CONUS. The ship was decommissioned on 28 October 2005. She was expended as a target and sunk off the coast of Hawaii as part of RIMPAC &#x27;06 exercises on 13 July 2006.

==Significance of the name==

The ship was named in memory of the World War I Battle of Belleau Wood, in which United States Marines of the Fourth Brigade, American Expeditionary Forces, defeated German forces after nearly four weeks of intense fighting. It is said that the Germans referred to them as &quot;Teufel Hunde&quot; (correctly &quot;Teufelshunde&quot;)—Devil Dogs—and it was this moniker that became the ship&#x27;s mascot, and one of the nicknames for US Marines (Devil Dog).

===Coat of arms===
The official seal of &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; is a blend of symbols. An image of a fighting U.S. Marine, in World War I battle dress, is at the center of the plaque. He carries a rifle with bayonet, and seems to be beckoning someone to follow him. Surrounding the figure are the gold cross, shield and swords of the Croix de guerre, the French medal awarded to the Marines who distinguished themselves at Belleau Wood. In that tradition, Marines of the Fourth Brigade are permitted to wear the French fourragère to this day.
Twelve gold battle stars in a field of blue line the top of the coat of arms. They stand for the World War II record of the first . The gap between the sixth and seventh stars represents the ship&#x27;s only break in her war record. On 30 October 1944, while off Leyte Gulf, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; was struck by a kamikaze. The light aircraft carrier had to undergo repairs and an overhaul, hence the gap.

Blue and gold, prevailing hues of the coat of arms, are the traditional colors of the United States Navy. The tricolor (red over white over blue) is a reminder that the Battle of Belleau Wood occurred in France, and that Marines who gave their lives at Belleau Wood did so in the defense of another nation&#x27;s freedom. The segments also bring to mind the colors of the United States.

<doc id="737718" wikidata="Q7997728" url="?curid=737718" title="Why Bother? (radio show)">
<text>Why Bother? is a comedy radio series made for BBC Radio 3, consisting of five 10-minute-long spoof interviews between Chris Morris and Peter Cook&#x27;s character Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling. Recorded in late 1993, the show was originally broadcast from 10–14 January 1994. Cook received the sole writing credit whilst Morris also produced the series, although the pair ad-libbed the majority of the dialogue, which Morris then edited.

Morris played a variation on the abrasive interviewer character he had created in &quot;On the Hour&quot; and later used in &quot;The Day Today&quot;. The short pieces provide further insights into the Streeb-Greebling character that Cook had created for &quot;Not Only... But Also&quot; in 1965.

==Subjects==
Topics of conversation include Streeb-Greebling&#x27;s experiments on eels, his role in the racial violence during the 1992 Los Angeles riots following the Rodney King trial, his military career, including his time in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp during World War II, and his habit of strangling his business partners. The listener learns that Streeb-Greebling was put in prison by his father at the age of four, once spent a &#x27;year and a quarter&#x27; standing on Lake Ontario with only bears for company, and hears of his next project: cloning from the fossilised remains of the infant Christ with the assistance of BMW, Honda and Sony.

==Interview style==
When questioned on how structured the interviews were, Morris replied that the pair had agreed to &quot;just shoot from the hip&quot; and that &quot;the preparation that existed, existed only in terms of the things we had already done&quot;, with each of the characters being familiar roles. Morris described the recording:

== Reception ==

Reviewing the CD release in 1999, &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote &quot;this flimsy collection of five short interviews [...] leaves you wondering why you did bother&quot;.

On an episode of &quot;With Great Pleasure&quot;, John Finnemore cited &quot;Why Bother?&quot; as one of his favorite pieces of comedy, citing a moment in the track &quot;Bears&quot; in which Cook attempts to move on from a subject and Morris prompts him to improvise further.

==CD release==
The complete series was released on CD and cassette through BBC Radio Collection in 1999, with the show intros and credits removed to create a tight 50-minute comedy album presumably designed to evoke the Derek and Clive records.

==Episode/track listing==
#&quot;Eels, Love and Guns&quot;
#&quot;Bears&quot;
#&quot;Christ&quot;
#&quot;Prisoner of War&quot;
#&quot;Drugs etc&quot;

<text>William Johnson McDonald (December 21, 1844 – February 8, 1926, though some sources give his date of death as February 6
) was a Paris, Texas banker who left $850,000 (the bulk of his fortune) to the University of Texas System to endow an astronomical observatory.

The bequest was unexpected, and his will was contested, but after prolonged legal disputes the university received the money. At the time, the university had no faculty of astronomy, so in 1932 it formed a collaboration with Otto Struve at the University of Chicago, who supplied astronomers.

The McDonald Observatory is named after him, with Otto Struve becoming the first director.

McDonald was the eldest of the three sons of Sarah Johnson and Henry Graham McDonald of Paris, Texas. As a young man, he was a private in the Confederate Army. He became wealthy through his businesses as a lawyer and a banker, but remained frugal his entire life. He never married and had no children.

<doc id="737725" wikidata="Q2840528" url="?curid=737725" title="Alucard (Castlevania)">
<text>, better known as , is a character in Konami&#x27;s &quot;Castlevania&quot; series of video games. His first appearance in the series was in the 1989 game &quot;Castlevania III: Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot;, but he is best known for his role in the critically acclaimed &quot;&quot;, released in 1997. His design in &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; was created by Ayami Kojima, marking her first contribution to the &quot;Castlevania&quot; franchise.

In the series, Alucard is the son of Dracula, the antagonist of the &quot;Castlevania&quot; series. Due to his human mother, Lisa, Alucard is a dhampir, a half-human, half-vampire. His mother&#x27;s death and admonition not to hate humanity caused him to take up arms against his father. In &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot; and &quot;Castlevania Legends&quot;, he fights against his father alongside the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan, and he is featured as the protagonist of &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot;. Alucard additionally is present in &quot;&quot; and the follow-up sequel &quot;&quot;, where he interacts with the protagonist of both games, Soma Cruz, as the Japanese government agent . The &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; reboot series, starting with the character&#x27;s introduction in &quot;&quot;, introduces a reimagined Alucard with a new backstory, revealing him as Trevor Belmont, once a mortal who was transformed into a vampire after his death at the hands of his biological father, the remorseful Dracula.

Several video game publications have provided praise and criticism on Alucard&#x27;s character. While Alucard debuted in &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot;, his characterization stood out more in &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; for being a different type of protagonist from his predecessors. In &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot;, where Alucard was present as Genya Arikado, reviewers noted that although he fell into a stereotypical character mold, the greater concentration on supporting characters was a welcomed change from previous &quot;Castlevania&quot; games. Alucard&#x27;s portrayal in the &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; and Netflix series also led to positive response by the media.

==Conception and development==
Alucard was intended to be a mirror image of his father, as evidenced by his name, his father&#x27;s name spelled backwards. The original &quot;Castlevania&quot; games for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) contained references to the Universal Horror films, with Alucard being a tribute to Lon Chaney Jr.&#x27;s role as Count Alucard from the 1943 film, &quot;Son Of Dracula&quot;. 

The idea of using Alucard as a protagonist in &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; came from Konami&#x27;s idea for a character whose abilities could grow and change, and also a character who could transform into other things. Given those two points, and the need to connect the protagonist to the history of &quot;Castlevania&quot;, they chose Alucard. The original design was not found appealing by the staff, and they redesigned him. While the game does not explain it, Alucard can use holy weapons thanks to his human heritage. 
The ending of &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; where Maria chases after Alucard was left to the player&#x27;s interpretation. Though the idea about a romantic interaction was planned, the team did not want Alucard to turn Maria into another vampire. Another idea Igarashi had was that Alucard defeated Dracula in the original plotline by Bram Stoker, instead of Quincy Morris. Despite pressure for the change of protagonist, Alucard was highly popular to the fanbase with the staff members thinking it was due to him being cool.

When it came to the reboot &quot;&quot;, Mercury Steam told the audience the spin-off &quot;Mirror of Fate&quot; would include Trevor Belmont and Alucard as different playable characters, before later revealing them to be the same character but transformed. With &quot;Mirror of Fate&quot;, Mercury Steam wanted to explain the story that connects the Belmont Clan with Dracula. Alcuard plays a major in the sequel due to his connection with Dracula. For the DLC of the next game, Alucard became playable with the plot being focused more on his relationship with Dracula before the events of &quot;Lords of Shadow 2&quot;.

For the Netflix series of &quot;Castlevania&quot;, the art team were given directions from Konami staff members. One of those factors was Alucard&#x27;s ambidextrous talents, or lack thereof. In the original animation for the show&#x27;s fourth and final episode of its first season, animation director Spencer Wan had drawn Alucard holding a sword in his left hand. It was only after revisiting notes from Konami that Wan remembered the video game publisher had reminded the art team at Powerhouse Animation that Alucard had to be drawn as right-handed. This led to several changes in the making of the series in order to make Netflix&#x27;s Alucard fit Konami&#x27;s ideas. The first encounter between Alucard and Trevor was one of the most challenging fights to animate but the staff found that Alucard being shirtless made it easier. Despite the narrative focusing too much on tragedy, the staff made sure to give Alucard and Trevor Belmont a friendly relationship that often comes across as childish to balance the tone. For the fourth season, the team promised the emotionally destroyed Alucard would recover his humanity in this new arc.

The writers always planned to bring back Alucard for &quot;Nocturne&quot; even if he only appeared in the last scene from its first season. They wanted to make it a surprise return as well as make it as beautiful as possible. In retrospective, Producer Adi Shankar said that &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; stood out for deviating from the franchise&#x27;s common narrative elements of the Belmont clan and instead focused on Alucard who is too different from previous protagonists. He further compared the story with how different the Marvel Universe films are as they go from &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot; (2011) to &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016). This version of Alucard was later confirmed as bisexual on Twitter by Sam Deats, one of the series directors. Alucard also appears in &quot;&quot;.

===Design===
Alucard debuted in &quot;Castlevania III: Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot; for the Nintendo Entertainment System, where he was designed by T. Fujimoto and I. Urata. Much of the original artwork for the game was lost during the Great Hanshin earthquake. Alucard&#x27;s subsequent appearances would largely be designed by Ayami Kojima, who managed the character designs for &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

Kojima&#x27;s work in &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; was her first breakthrough into the gaming industry, and her dark, gothic style borrows heavily from &quot;bishōnen&quot;-style art. From a visual perspective, Toshiharu Furukawa found it appealing to have a stylish man as the lead for this installment. Along with the change in lead, there was also a switch in visual style from an anime-esque look to one inspired by Baroque art. Kojima was inspired by the novels &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano when working in the game, with Alucard being highly influenced by its title and main character.

In &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot;, Kojima&#x27;s designs followed the new theme that producer Koji Igarashi was attempting to pursue by placing it in a futuristic setting. Following this theme, Alucard&#x27;s appearance as Genya Arikado was made much more contemporary, featuring modern attire compared the historical appearances of previous &quot;Castlevania&quot; characters. Kojima was not present in the design team for &quot;&quot;, and Arikado, along with the rest of the cast, were drawn in an anime style. Igarashi, also the producer of &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot;, wished to utilize the anime style as a marketing technique due to his belief that the Nintendo DS targeted a younger audience than previous systems had. The anime style would also serve as a litmus test as to whether future &quot;Castlevania&quot; games would incorporate the style. For the Netflix series, Alucard&#x27;s design was inspired by &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; with the director noting it was &quot;deep&quot; for the character despite Trevor and other characters being influenced by other games.

For &quot;Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate&quot;, Alucard&#x27;s human form, Trevor Belmont, was created as a parallel to Dracula&#x27;s former self, Gabriel Belmont. MercurySteam had more freedom with this game resulting in connections between the Belmont and Dracula. Despite being Dracula&#x27;s child, Alucard was designed with the idea of being his opposite as shown with how he is attached to the light. The staff wanted Trevor to stand out and not look identical to Gabriel. Meanwhile, there were less hints about Simon Belmont being Trevor&#x27;s son. The themes of fate and the parallels involving Alucard and Dracula was inspired by Christopher Nolan&#x27;s film, &quot;Memento&quot; (2000). The powers Alucard has access to in the &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; reboot were loosely based on &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot;.

===Voice actors===

&quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; is the second &quot;Castlevania&quot; game to employ voice actors for the characters (the first being the &quot;&quot; for the PC Engine Super CD-ROM²). The Japanese voice actor for Alucard was Ryōtarō Okiayu, and the English voice actor was Robert Belgrade. Igarashi especially liked the final scene, when Alucard says &quot;Trouble the soul of my mother no more!&quot; as it emphasizes the character&#x27;s humanity, in contrast to his quiet and emotionless lines earlier in the game. The English actor, Robert Belgrade, grew fond on the game and noticed he received favorable feedback from the fans. Belgrade lamented he was not called by Konami for later works which he attributes due to the localization team being moved.

Igarashi noted that due to fan complaints over the voice acting in &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot;, a new script for the game as well as a set of new voice actors were used in &quot;The Dracula X Chronicles&quot;. Yuri Lowenthal replaced Belgrade for this version.

In the &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; series, Alucard is voiced by Richard Madden. Producer Dave Cox claimed Madden was chosen due to his popularity and talent in order to fit with other famous actors like Robert Carlyle and Patrick Stewart.

James Callis voices Alucard in the 2017 Netflix series &quot;Castlevania&quot; and its 2023 sequel, &quot;&quot;. Callis originally auditioned for Trevor. However, the way he did his Trevor audition was exactly how he voices Alucard, which the staff found funny. This led to Callis taking the role of Alucard. The team enjoyed recording several lines due to how violent and humorous some interactions were.

Caliis recalls being a fan of vampire stories in his youth but played few &quot;Castlevania&quot; games during that time. As a result, he had no knowledge of the franchise when being cast for the role. He was impressed by Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Castlevania&quot;. In describing his character, he considers it fair to say that he plays his Alucard&#x27;s very close to himself. He added that the character &quot;has lived, loved, experienced humanity in all its glory and its despair&quot; and manages to become more human when interacting with the human race. He felt that if he had one word to describe his tragic heritage, it would be a &quot;torn&quot;. Callis further claimed Alucard &quot;as having the visage and demeanor of a placid lake&quot;, repressing his human instincts.
==Appearances==
===Video games===
In the 1989 &quot;Castlevania III: Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot; for the NES, Alucard is initially a boss encountered by the primary protagonist, Trevor Belmont. If the player defeats Alucard, he can be utilized as a playable character in the game.

Alucard&#x27;s following appearance in the series is in the 1997 game, &quot;&quot;, where he is featured as the game&#x27;s protagonist and primary playable character. Due to the brainwashing of the current member of the Belmont clan, Richter Belmont, Alucard heads to his father&#x27;s castle to find Richter and ensure that Dracula does not return. He encounters Richter, who has been controlled by the dark priest Shaft into believing he is the lord of Dracula&#x27;s castle, and Alucard manages to free him from the spell controlling him. In response, Shaft creates an inverted version of Dracula&#x27;s castle for Alucard to travel through, and Alucard defeats him, and ultimately, Dracula as well. &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; also expands on Alucard&#x27;s background, revealing how his human mother, Lisa, was hunted down and executed by humans who believed her to be a witch. Despite this, Lisa admonished Alucard to respect humans and not hate them as his father did. In an alternative ending, the young Maria either chases Alucard in the hope of helping him, or resigns herself to Alucard&#x27;s fate and leaves with Richter.

The 1997 &quot;Castlevania Legends&quot; was Alucard&#x27;s third appearance in the series. Similar to his initial appearance in &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot;, he is a boss challenging the skills of the game&#x27;s protagonist, Sonia Belmont. After she defeats him, he accepts her strength and decides to submerge his powers by entering a deep sleep, believing that she will defeat Dracula in his stead.

In the 2003 &quot;&quot;, Alucard is disguised as the enigmatic Japanese government agent Genya Arikado in order to prevent the powers of his father, who was finally killed by Julius Belmont, from ending up in the wrong hands. He meets the game&#x27;s protagonist, Soma Cruz, and explains his &quot;power of dominance,&quot; or his ability to absorb the souls of the monsters he defeats and use their abilities. He instructs him to seek out the castle&#x27;s throne room, where Soma realizes that he is Dracula&#x27;s reincarnation. Arikado subsequently advises Soma to destroy the flow of chaos in the castle to free himself from his fate, which Soma succeeds in doing.

Alucard reprises his role as Arikado in the sequel to &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot;, &quot;Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow&quot; (2005), where he works to stop the machinations of a cult headed by Celia Fortner to create a new dark lord by killing Soma. Arikado initially requests that Soma does not become involved, but gives him a letter and talisman from Mina when he encounters him later in the game. After both of Celia&#x27;s &quot;dark lord&#x27;s candidates,&quot; Dmitrii Blinov and Dario Bossi, are defeated, Arikado stops Celia&#x27;s attempt to force Soma to awaken as the new dark lord, but inadvertently allows Dmitrii to revive himself. He confronts him, but is stopped when Dmitrii uses Celia as a sacrifice to seal his powers. Following Soma&#x27;s battle with Menace, a giant demon that sprouts from Dmitrii, Arikado explains to Soma that he is not destined to become the dark lord, nor does he need to. In the game&#x27;s , Arikado is playable as Alucard after he is found in the castle. Alucard was one of the playable characters in &quot;Castlevania Judgment&quot; for the Nintendo Wii, a fighting game based on the series.

Alucard appears in &quot;&quot;, the second installment in the &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; reboot series. In the first half, Alucard assists the protagonist, his son Simon Belmont, into defeating Dracula. The second half reveals that Alucard&#x27;s human life as Trevor Belmont who goes on a journey to kill his father. However, Trevor is defeated by Dracula who learns in his last moments he is his son. Shocked, Dracula passes Trevor his blood, reviving him as the vampire Alucard. Alucard later appears in the sequel &quot;&quot; as a supporting character... His human persona appears to Dracula requesting him to reform the Mirror of Fate. In the climax, it is revealed that the real Alucard had sent his father into a comatose state in order to make their enemies Zobek prepare for Satan&#x27;s return and end the world. When Alucard remembers this, it is revealed Alucard has been taking the form of Zobek&#x27;s bodyguard. Both Dracula and Alucard join forces to defeat Zobek but Satan returns and possesses the young vampire. Dracula manages to kill Satan while saving Alucard at the same time. Alucard then asks his father what will they do as the father breaks the Mirror of Fate. MercurySteam also released a downloadable content chapter &quot;Revelations&quot;, where Alucard is the playable character as he protects his father in preparations for the events of &quot;Lords of Shadow 2&quot;, while also defeating one of Zobek&#x27;s guardians to take his armor and remain hidden.

Alucard makes a cameo appearance as an Assist Trophy in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. He also debuted as a playable fighter in &quot;Brawlhalla&quot; on October 19, 2022.

Alucard appears as a Legendary skin for Trevor Belmont in &quot;Dead by Daylight&quot;, released alongside him with the &quot;Castlevania&quot; expansion in August 2024.

===Animated series===
A version of Alucard makes a minor appearance in &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot;. Here, he is depicted as a rebellious teenager who enjoys skateboarding and music, much to his father&#x27;s chagrin. He appears in the Season 3 episode &quot;Return to Castlevania&quot;, initially posing as an ally to the heroes before revealing himself to be in league with the Count.

Alucard, voiced by James Callis, appears as a major character in the 2017 &quot;Castlevania&quot; animated series, which is primarily based on the 1989 video game &quot;Castlevania III: Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot;. In the first season, Alucard meets and engages Trevor and Sypha. Alucard reveals that the myth of the &quot;sleeping soldier&quot; was actually himself, and that he was testing their abilities. The three prepare to challenge Dracula and end the conflict for good. For the second season, the trio go to locate Dracula&#x27;s castle, as it can teleport from place to place. Trevor fights off the demons as Alucard uses the distance mirror to locate Dracula&#x27;s castle. Eventually, Alucard reaches the study and attacks Dracula. Dracula is overcome by remorse before allowing Alucard to stake him through the heart, killing him. Alucard is upset about having killed his father, eventually being overcome by grief and breaks down crying.

In the third season, a month after Dracula&#x27;s death, Alucard tries to adjust to his loneliness, but he misses Trevor and Sypha and fears he is going insane. At the Belmont Hold, Alucard is visited by a pair of vampire hunters from Japan, Sumi and Taka, who wish to be trained by him in order to defend their people, which he accepts. During the night, Sumi and Taka enter Alucard&#x27;s room to have sex with him in an attempt to trap him. They accuse Alucard of withholding his knowledge of magic from them and not teaching them how to operate the castle. Before they can stake him, he uses his sword to slit their throats. A grieving Alucard leaves Sumi and Taka&#x27;s impaled bodies outside of Dracula&#x27;s castle as a warning to future visitors, just as Dracula had before him. During season four, Alucard accepts the village leader Greta&#x27;s request to act as its protector. Alucard also meets Saint Germain who request to protect their people. Alucard and Greta lead the refugees in a desperate fight against the vampire Dragan&#x27;s forces, but are eventually forced back into Dracula&#x27;s castle. Trevor and Sypha arrive through the mirror at Dracula&#x27;s castle, where they reunite with Alucard and fight through the invaders. After defeating Death, the three reflect on all they survived together and look forward to a brighter future. Alucard also makes a cameo in the spin-off &quot;&quot;.

==Reception==

Alucard has received praise and criticism from several video game publications, primarily concentrating on his role in &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; featured him in their article &quot;All Time Greatest Game Hero&quot;. Magazines have also described him as one of the best and greatest video game character. In a review of &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot;, &quot;RPGFan&quot; celebrated the fact that Alucard was not a member of the Belmont clan, the protagonists of most &quot;Castlevania&quot; games, and that the fact he was Dracula&#x27;s son added &quot;an element of depth to the plot&quot; due to the varied reactions he would receive from the inhabitants of Dracula&#x27;s castle. &quot;RPGamer&quot; disagreed with this assessment, noting that the plot and Alucard&#x27;s role &quot;isn&#x27;t very deep&quot; and secondary to the concentration on gameplay. James Paul Gee noted that &quot;even though Alucard is a vampire hunter, he has no distinctive skills associated with this profession&quot;. In the book &quot;A New Literacies Sampler&quot;, the writer expressed a favoritism in Alucard though he did not find his skills and moves were unique for a vampire hunter or soldier when compared with &quot;Full Spectrum Warrior&quot;, and wrote that instead his moves feel more similar to Mario. In contrast to Ritcher, Alucard&#x27;s encounter with the villain was seen as more personal as the game explores the father and son relationship with heavy emphasis on Alucard&#x27;s mental state as the dialogue he shares with Dracula embodies the theme of grief and identity. Another major area the two vampires share is the fate of Lisa, Alucard&#x27;s mother and Dracula&#x27;s wife, who none of the characters managed to surpass.

Kojima&#x27;s design of Alucard from &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; was noted to be highly popular within the audience to the point &quot;Polygon&quot; noticed it popularized the &quot;vampire skin,&quot; which appeared as a full-blown trend in 2022. Writer Kazuma Hashimoto from the same website dressed as Alucard too, praising the design the character has. Artist Brock Otterbacher was fond of Kojima&#x27;s designs, claiming &quot;I had always come across and looked at her art, especially from the game. And this one image in particular that always kind of stuck out to me, which was an image of Alucard. His cape is part-bat, part-wolf, and that direct image is the inspiration for this. This was made years ago, I was like, &#x27;Wow, I would love to someday get the opportunity to do the statue of this.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Game Informer&quot; was in particular shocked by an Alucard cosplayer who managed to look nearly identical to his later incarnations.

Alucard&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot; as Genya Arikado was also noted by reviewers. &quot;RPGamer&quot; celebrated how the greater concentration on supporting characters, including Arikado, were a welcome change from previous &quot;Castlevania&quot; games. &quot;RPGFan&quot; derided Arikado&#x27;s &quot;cool and impassive personality&quot; as stereotypical, but praised the game&#x27;s character development as setting him apart from previous supporting characters in the series. The switch to an anime style for the character designs in &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot; was notably criticized, as many reviewers preferred the designs made by Ayami Kojima. &quot;GameSpy&quot; deplored the &quot;shallow, lifeless anime images&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot; called the images &quot;down to the level of &#x27;generic Saturday morning Anime&#x27; quality.&quot; While noting his role in &quot;Symphony&quot;, James Paul Gee praised the handling of Alucard for coming across as one unique character due to how different he was from previous playable characters.

&quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; praised the handling of Alucard&#x27;s characterization in the &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; series for how he handles his relationship with his father even if the ending might come across as too tragic as both father and son appeared to hate their own nature and wanted to end the Belmont bloodline with their own lives. &quot;GameSpot&quot; said there was a major confusion about the identity of Alucard in &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; due to him being first known as the hunter Trevor Belmont who dies fighting Dracula and later being revealed to have revived as Alucard in &quot;Mirror of Fate&quot;. In retrospect, &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the handling of Alucard in the &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; trilogy as the twist of Trevor being future Alucard subverted their expectations due to its emotional value. However, they criticized Dracula&#x27;s and Alucard&#x27;s final showdown in &quot;Lords of Shadow 2&quot; as the both father and son fail to conquer their inner demons. Alucard&#x27;s DLC &quot;Revelations&quot; was praised by the media for how different are Alucard&#x27;s abilities from Dracula&#x27;s as well as more entertaining.

The animated version of Alucard&#x27;s characterization in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Castlevania&quot; series earned mixed responses, as he and his allies were overshadowed by Dracula&#x27;s underlings, who were seen as more fleshed out cast members than Alucard. &quot;GameSpot&quot; agreed that the trio&#x27;s appearances in the first episodes were underwhelming and that their relationship gets uninteresting quickly, as the cast spends most of their time interacting in a library. On the other hand, Blasting News felt that the second season of &quot;Castlevania&quot; gave more screen time to develop the chemistry between Alucard and his friends, in contrast to his brief role in the first season. A review from &quot;Destructoid&quot; expressed similar sentiments, largely due to the way Alucard and Trevor push aside their differences to defeat Dracula while insulting each other across the story, leaving good comic relief in the process. &quot;IGN&quot; felt that the relationship between Alucard and his father was one of the best aspects of the second season due to the performance of their voice actors. In an analysis from the franchise, E. Charlotte Stevens from Birmingham City University claimed that Alucard&#x27;s gaming appearance make him noticeably androgynous, stylish and glammorised. Paul Martin noticed the character often shows signs of humanity despite the idea that he is a monster whereas the Netflix anime makes him look more sympathetic and lonely as a result of his father&#x27;s death.

<text>In the United States and Canada, low-speed vehicle (LSV) regulations allow relaxed design and registration laws for four-wheel vehicles that have a maximum capable speed of about . Several other countries have similar regulations.

==Canada==
Under Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations, a low-speed vehicle is defined as a vehicle, other than an all-terrain vehicle, a truck or a vehicle imported temporarily for special purposes, that is powered by an electric motor, produces no emissions, is designed to travel on 4 wheels and has an attainable speed in 1.6 km of more than but not more than on a paved level surface.

Low-speed vehicles are currently street legal in British Columbia, Quebec, and Ontario.

SC Carts was the first Canadian manufacturer to begin producing street legal low-speed vehicles.

==France==
Quadricycles (the EU vehicle classification covering this type of vehicle) can be driven without a car licence, and are known as &quot;voitures sans permis&quot; (VSP), literally “cars without licence”. Despite this name, drivers must first sit a written road-safety exam, and be at least 14 years old before legally being allowed to drive this type of vehicle.

==Philippines==
The Philippines Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board has created a Low-Speed Vehicle category for four--wheeled motor vehicles that use alternative fuel (such as electricity) and have a maximum speed of .

This regulation was created for the E-jeepney electric-powered minibuses, which were introduced in 2007. The E-jeepney carries 17 passengers and can run 120 km on an 8-hour charge from an electric outlet.

==United States==

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has published safety guidelines in the United States which apply to vehicles operating in the 20–25 mile-per-hour speed range. Low-speed vehicles are defined as a four-wheeled motor vehicle that has a gross vehicle weight rating of less than and a top speed of between .

States which have specific regulations for LSVs include Alaska, California, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine Maryland, Missouri, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah and Washington, DC.

Nearly all 50 states allow LSVs, also called Neighborhood Electric Vehicles (NEVs), to drive on their roads where the speed limit is 35 mph or less. Either they follow FMVSS500 (25 mph top speed on 35 mph limit roads), or make their own more aggressive law. Because of federal law, car dealers cannot legally sell the vehicles to go faster than , but the buyer can easily modify the car to go . However, if modified to exceed , the vehicle then becomes subject to additional safety requirements.

These speed restrictions, combined with a typical driving range of per charge and a typical three-year battery durability, are required because of a lack of federally mandated safety equipment and features which NEVs cannot accommodate because of their design. To satisfy federal safety requirements for manufacturers, NEVs must be equipped with three-point seat belts or a lap belt, running lights, headlights, brake lights, reflectors, rear view mirrors, and turn signals; windshield wipers are not required. In many cases, doors may be optional, crash protection from other vehicles is partially met compared to other non-motorized transport such as bicycles because of the use of seat belts. In 2011, a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article concluded that the lack of passenger safety protection made most LSVs unfit for city driving, despite their excellent maneuverability.
=== Short commute vehicles ===
Short commute vehicle (SCV) is a term sometimes used for vehicles that are used for regular trips of or less. The term &quot;ultra small vehicle&quot; is also used for similar styles of vehicle.

SCVs are faster than —walking pace—and not regulated by other Motor Vehicle Legislation. It would include vehicles regulated under FMVSS500 (USA Low Speed Vehicle Regulation), CMVSS500 (Canadian Low Speed Vehicle Regulation) and certain L-category vehicles (Quadricycle L6 and L7) in the EU. Battery electric vehicles (BEV) are highly suited as Short Commute Vehicles due to their inherent short operating range; however, SCVs do not have to be BEVs.

Since 2010, the American Association of Retired Persons and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety have expressed concerns about mixed traffic flows including this class of vehicle.

<text>Léonce Lagarde, Count de Rouffeyroux, Duke of Enttoto (1860 – 15 February 1936) was a French colonial governor of French Somaliland and ambassador.

==Biography==
In 1882, Lagarde was named secretary to the governor of Cochinchina. One year later, he was designated &quot;Commandant de Cercle&quot; of French Senegal. However, it was a post that time did not allow him to serve because he was soon appointed French colonial governor of Obock Territory in Africa, a position he held for fifteen years, from 1884 to 1899.

Lagarde founded the port city of Djibouti in 1888 and moved his administration there from the city of Obock. He expanded French territory outwards around the Gulf of Tadjoura. In doing so, he created the protectorate known as the French Somali Coast (&quot;Côte française des Somalis&quot;), also called &quot;French Somaliland.&quot; (It was later named the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas, and in 1977, gained its independence as the Republic of Djibouti.)

As ambassador to Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II, Lagarde built-up French presence in the Horn of Africa to protect the colony from British domination, which was slowly expanding from Egypt. In 1896, he gained approval to build a railway line directly from Djibouti to Addis Ababa.

At the beginning of World War I in 1914, Lagarde headed the Service for Wounded Sailors and Prisoners of War. He remained at the Naval Ministry in an administrative position after the war, from 1920 to his retirement in 1929.

<doc id="737731" wikidata="Q560132" url="?curid=737731" title="Vatroslav Jagić">
<text>Vatroslav Jagić (; July 6, 1838 – August 5, 1923) was a Croatian scholar of Slavic studies in the second half of the 19th century.

==Life==
Jagić was born in Varaždin, where he attended the elementary school and is the place where he started his secondary-school education. He finished that level of education at the Gymnasium in Zagreb. Having a particular interest in philology, he moved to Vienna, where he was lectured in Slavic studies under the guidance of Franz Miklosich. He continued his studies and defended his doctoral dissertation &quot;Das Leben der Wurzel dê in den slavischen Sprachen&quot; [&quot;The Life of the Root dê in Slavic Languages&quot;] in Leipzig (Germany) in 1871.

Upon finishing his studies, Jagić returned to Zagreb, where from 1860 to 1870 he held the position of professor at a Croatian high school.

In 1869, Jagić was elected a full member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (now named the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts), and a correspondent member of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg. Next year, 1871, he became a professor of Slavic studies at Odessa University (Novorossiysk University) and worked also in Berlin, where he moved in 1874 to become the very first professor of Slavic studies at the prestigious Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin. Jagić held this post until 1880, when he moved again and became teacher at the University of St Petersburg.

In 1886, he returned to Vienna, where his studies started to be a replacement for retiring former lecturer Miklosich at the University of Vienna. Here he taught, did research, and published until his own retirement in 1908.

Jagić died in Vienna but was laid to rest in his native Varaždin.

==Works==
Works on literature and language written by Jagić started to be published for the first time in the reports of the high school where he worked. In 1863, with his fellow researchers Josip Torbar and Franjo Rački he launched the journal &quot;Književnik&quot;. In this journal, he published several articles regarding the problems of the grammar, syntax, orthography, and history of the language used by Croats. His works were noticed within the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (JAZU), founded in Croatia in 1866. His works were mainly related to verbs, paleography, vocalization of the language, folk poetry, and its sources. He polemicised against the Rijeka Philological School through scathing reviews of &#x27;s books &quot;Recimo koju&quot; [&quot;Let&#x27;s Say a Few Words&quot;] (1860) and &quot;Fluminensia&quot; (1862), and especially against the dominant Zagreb Philological School, represented by Adolfo Veber Tkalčević and Bogoslav Šulek, regarding the problems of orthography and pronunciation (&quot;Naš pravopis&quot; [&quot;Our Orthography&quot;], 1864). Although earlier he had held the opposite stance (&quot;Quomodo scribamus nos?&quot; [&quot;How Do We Write?&quot;], 1859), in the 1864 article he criticised Zagreb School&#x27;s usage of the &quot;-ah&quot; ending in the genitive plural form of nouns, as it lacked basis in the history of language, instead arguing for the &quot;-â&quot; ending, in line with the norm espoused by Vuk Karadžić and his followers; he also argued for introducing moderate elements of phonemic orthography to the otherwise morphological and etymological norm of the Zagreb School. In his arguments he introduced the methods of comparative linguistics in Croatia, and their influence paved the way for the Vukovian standard prevailing over Zagreb School&#x27;s. However, in the following decades he also criticised Vukovian scholarship (Maretić&#x27;s 1899 grammar, and Broz&#x27;s and Iveković&#x27;s 1901 dictionary, among others).

He prepared many critical editions of premodern texts, mainly Croatian and Old Church Slavonic. He was among the founders of the &quot;Stari pisci hrvatski&quot; [&quot;Old Croatian Writers&quot;] series published by JAZU, which focused on publishing Croatian literature from the Renaissance to the era of the Illyrian movement, beginning with an edition of the works of Marko Marulić (1869, co-edited by Jagić and Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski). For the series Jagić also edited the works of Šiško Menčetić and Džore Držić (1870), Mavro Vetranović (1871-1872, co-edited with and Đuro Daničić), and and Nikola Nalješković (1872, co-edited with Daničić). Elsewhere he published critical editions of medieval Croatian texts, Glagolitic Old Church Slavonic texts such as Codex Zographensis (1879), Codex Marianus (1883), Kiev Missal and Fragmenta Vindobonensia (1890), and others.

In Berlin, he started publishing the &quot;Archiv für slavische Philologie&quot; (Archive for Slavic Philology) in 1875, and kept editing it for 45 years. The periodical focused the attention of scholars and the general public on the Slavs, increasing their interest in Slavic languages and their culture. It also confirmed the importance of Slavic studies, its methodology, and its validity as a scholarly discipline.

While in Vienna, his intention was to write an encyclopedia related to the philology of the Slavs. This idea led him to write &quot;Istorija slavjanskoj filologii&quot; [&quot;History of Slavic philology&quot;]. The book was published in St. Petersburg in 1910 and meticulously described the development of Slavic studies from the beginning to the end of the 19th century.

In his work on Old Church Slavic he concluded and proved that the language did not originate in the central plains of Pannonia, as it was previously claimed by Jernej Kopitar and Franz Miklošič, but in southern Macedonia. In his later years he also studied the life and works of Juraj Križanić (1618–1683), a Dominican priest that had shown considerable interest in Pan-Slavism and cooperation between Catholicism and Orthodoxy.

Jagić&#x27;s work is regarded as impressive in scope and quality: Croatian linguist Josip Hamm has remarked that Jagić&#x27;s collected works would, put together, number more than 100 volumes of large format, and considers his work to have brought Slavic studies onto an equal footing with the other major philological branches.

Among his most famous students were the Polish Slavic specialist Aleksander Brückner and the Ukrainian poet and scholar Ivan Franko.

<text>Deadly Games is an American action science fiction television series that aired on UPN from September 5, 1995, to January 16, 1996. The basic plot of the show is about video game characters that come to life, re-enacting their deadly plans for wanton destruction and world domination in the real world. The series was produced by Viacom Productions.

==Plot==
The first episode introduces the protagonist, Dr. Gus Lloyd, an Antimatter physicist, engineer and video game designer who has created a live-action game in his spare time to exert his indignant feelings about his recent divorce and all the people in his life who have all made his life hell on Earth (his father, his ex-wife&#x27;s mother, his ex-wife&#x27;s divorce lawyer, his ex-girlfriend, his former employer, a high school football-Quarterback bully, his old camp counselor, the garbage man, a corrupt car mechanic); the villains of the game are modeled after all these people. The master villain is Jackal, who is a combination of the devil and Gus&#x27; father. The Jackal wears a vanilla-white ice cream suit and drives a Chrysler convertible to match.

The hero is &quot;The Cold-Steel Kid,&quot; a warrior trying to save the dying world, dons commando wear and is naturally modeled after Gus himself, and the sometimes helplessly captive, sometimes active heroine ingenue The Kid is always trying to rescue — &quot;The Girl&quot; — is based on Lauren Ashborne, Gus&#x27; ex-wife (wearing the kind of dress of a &quot;Damsel in distress&quot;).

In an accident involving an experimental laboratory project, Jackal and the villains step out of the game and into the real world to cause the apocalyptic carnage and domination they were programmed to for the game.

Each week, one of the villains tries to carry out an evil plot according to the rules of the video game, and Gus, Lauren, and Gus&#x27; friend Peter Rucker try to defeat and destroy the said villain. Almost indestructible and superhumanly strong, each villain is programmed with specific weapons and weaknesses based on that villain&#x27;s &quot;theme&quot;; e.g., &quot;Killshot&#x27;s&quot; Achilles&#x27; Heel was being sprayed with water, The Boss would &quot;fire&quot; people with exploding pink slips and his weak link was red ink, The Evil Shirley&#x27;s was dirt and she would be wiped out by having a house fall on her, The Camp Counselor would get burned by being hit with fast-lighting charcoal and would be killed off by an arrow shot right through the bulls-eye on his T-shirt, The Practical Joker could only be defeated by his master prank being foiled, The Divorce Attorney was a being that sucked up electricity and distributed it in the form of lightning bolts (her weakness was being hit with a foam-rubber arrow), The Motivational Speaker literally ate Bologna sausage and killed people with a gun that ejected audiocassettes and would reduce them to nothing but his audiotape, and he could only be destroyed by eating his own words. He could be slowed down with shots from a paintball gun.

Another weekly bad guy was a corrupted car mechanic who tasered people with a calculator and would be destroyed by seeing his own reflection. And of course, The Garbage Man was damaged by cleaning products and The Orthodontist (as well as his assistant) had an aversion to sugar. The Ex-Girlfriend was a misandrist with a hatred for all men, especially The Cold-Steel Kid. Her weakness was gold. All the henchmen were instantly obliterated—going up in smoke and blue light when the Jackal&#x27;s evil weekly master scheme was foiled. The Jackal&#x27;s own vice was being hit with a baseball—the very one autographed by Bobby Mercer that Gus got from the only baseball game he ever went to with his own father. Jackal is present in every episode, commanding the other villains and vexing the heroes, usually with a glass of champagne in hand.

<doc id="737739" wikidata="Q6214709" url="?curid=737739" title="Joged dance">
<text>&quot;Joged&quot; dance () is a style of dance from the Island of Bali derived from the traditional Gandrung dance. The term &quot;joged&quot; or &quot;joget&quot; is also a common word for dance in Indonesia. The dance is typically accompanied by a gamelan ensemble of bamboo instruments, called a gamelan joged bumbung. Its dancers usually wear attire consisting of a Kebaya and Sarong. Unlike most Balinese dances, &quot;joged&quot; is not a religious or ritual one. It is more of a secular social dance for entertainment purposes only. During a &quot;joged&quot; performance, a single or several female dancers will perform for usually predominantly male audience to dance with them. Dancers may often invite a spectator to join in the &quot;joged&quot; using a fan and sash. which unlike many dances has no set moves and is largely improvised. It is considered impolite to refuse such an invitation. 

The dance often involves movements that are erotic and teasing, showing various interactions between the dancers and their male counterpart, ranging from humorous to seductive. The more provocative nature that this dance can have was called &quot;[incompatible] with the ethics of Balinese culture&quot; by Putu Beratha, head of Bali Province&#x27;s Cultural Affairs Department, with a youth-led movement &quot;Stop Joged Jaruh&quot; attempting to remove recordings of the dance from YouTube. In 2016 Governor Made Mangku Pastika attempted to ban the dance, calling it &quot;pornographic&quot;. In August 2017, the Bali Provincial Government held a &quot;joged bumbung&quot; festival to attempt to improve the dance.

The dance is quite comparable with other Indonesian dance traditions, such as those of Javanese &quot;ronggeng&quot; and Sundanese &quot;jaipongan&quot;.

<text>Three Rivers Stadium was a multi-purpose stadium in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, from 1970 to 2000. It was home to the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL).

Built to replace Forbes Field, which opened in 1909, the US$55 million ($ million in 2025) multi-purpose facility was designed to maximize efficiency. Ground was broken in April 1968 and construction, often behind schedule, took 29 months. The stadium opened on July 16, 1970, with a Pirates game. In the 1971 World Series, it hosted the first World Series game played at night. The following year, the stadium was the site of the Immaculate Reception. The final game in the stadium was won by the Steelers on December 16, 2000. Three Rivers also hosted the Pittsburgh Maulers of the United States Football League and the University of Pittsburgh Panthers football team for a single season each.

After its closing, Three Rivers was imploded in 2001, and the Pirates and Steelers moved into new dedicated stadiums: PNC Park and Heinz Field (now Acrisure Stadium), respectively.

==History==

===Planning and construction===
A proposal for a new sports stadium in Pittsburgh was first made in 1948; however, plans did not attract much attention until the late 1950s. The Pittsburgh Pirates played their home games at Forbes Field, which opened in 1909, and was the second oldest venue in the National League (Philadelphia&#x27;s Shibe Park/Connie Mack Stadium was oldest, having opened only two months prior to Forbes). The Pittsburgh Steelers, who had moved from Forbes Field to Pitt Stadium in 1964, were large supporters of the project. For their part, according to longtime Pirates announcer Bob Prince, the Pirates wanted a bigger place to play in order to draw more revenue.

In 1958, the Pirates sold Forbes to the University of Pittsburgh for $2 million ($ million today); it wanted the land for expanded graduate facilities. As part of the deal, the university leased Forbes back to the Pirates until a replacement could be built. An early design of the stadium included plans to situate the stadium atop a bridge across the Monongahela River. It was to call for a 70,000-seat stadium with hotels, marina, and a 100-lane bowling alley. Plans of the &quot;Stadium over the Monongahela&quot; were eventually not pursued. A design was presented in 1958 which featured an open center field design—through which fans could view Pittsburgh&#x27;s &quot;Golden Triangle&quot;. A site on the city&#x27;s Northside was approved on August 10, 1958, due to land availability and parking space, the latter of which had been a problem at Forbes Field. The same site had hosted Exposition Park, which the Pirates had left in 1909. The stadium was located in a portion of downtown difficult to access; political debate continued over the &quot;North Side Sports Stadium&quot; and the project was often behind schedule and over-budget. Arguments were made by commissioner (and former Allegheny County Medical Examiner) William McCelland that the Pirates and Steelers should fund a higher percentage of the $33 million project ($ million today). Due to lack of support, however, the arguments faded.
Ground was broken in 1968 on April 25, and due to the Steelers&#x27; suggestions, the design was changed to enclose center field. Construction continued, though it became plagued with problems such as thieves stealing materials from the building site. In April 1969, construction was behind schedule and the target opening date of April 1970 was deemed unlikely to be met. That November, Arthur Gratz asked the city for an additional $3 million ($ million today), which was granted. In January 1970, the new target date was set for May 29; however, because of a failure to install the lights on schedule, opening day was delayed once more to July 16. The stadium was named in February 1969 for its location at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which forms the Ohio River. It would sometimes be called &quot;The House That Clemente Built&quot; after Pirates&#x27; right-fielder Roberto Clemente.

===Opening Day===
In their first game after the All-Star Break in 1970, the Pirates opened the stadium against the Cincinnati Reds on Thursday, July 16; who won, 3–2. The team donned new uniform designs for the first time that day, a similar plan was for new &quot;mini-skirts&quot; for female ushers. However, the ushers&#x27; union declined the uniform change for female workers. A parade was held before opening ceremonies. The expansive parking lot, both Pirates and Steelers team offices, the Allegheny Club (VIP Club) and the press boxes and facilities were not opened until weeks later due to extended labor union work stoppages. Instead of allowing cars to park, the team instructed fans to park downtown and walk to the stadium over bridges or take shuttle buses. The opening of Three Rivers marked the first time the Pirates allowed beer to be sold in the stands during a game since the early 1960s.

During batting practice on that day, a stray foul ball hit a woman named Evelyn Jones in the eye while she was walking the stadium&#x27;s concourse. She sued the Pirates and their subsidiary that managed the stadium, arguing that the Baseball Rule, which usually prevents spectators at baseball games from holding teams liable for foul ball injuries, did not apply because she was away from the seating areas and not watching what was going on on the field. A jury awarded Jones $125,000, but it was reversed on appeal. That decision was in turn reversed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which agreed with her argument about the Baseball Rule and also noted that the opening to the concourse through which the foul had passed was a purely architectural choice that was not necessary to the game of baseball.

===Design and alterations===

Three Rivers Stadium was similar in design to other stadiums built in the 1960s and 1970s, such as RFK Stadium in Washington, Shea Stadium in New York, Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati, the Houston Astrodome, Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, and Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis, which were designed as multi-purpose facilities to maximize efficiency. Due to their similar design these stadiums were nicknamed &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; or &quot;concrete doughnut&quot; ballparks. The sight lines were more favorable to football; almost 70% of the seats in the baseball configuration were in fair territory. It originally seated 50,611 for baseball, but several expansions over the years brought it to 58,729. In 1993, the Pirates placed tarps on most of the upper deck to create a better baseball atmosphere, reducing capacity to 47,687.

Three Rivers was the first multi-purpose stadium and the first in either the NFL or MLB to feature 3M&#x27;s Tartan Turf (then a competitor to the dominant AstroTurf), which was installed for opening day. It had a dirt skin infield on the basepaths for baseball through 1972, until converted to &quot;sliding pits&quot; at the bases for 1973. Renovations for the start of the 1983 baseball season included replacing the Tartan Turf with AstroTurf, the center field Stewart-Warner scoreboard being removed and replaced with new seating—while a new Diamond Vision scoreboard with a White Way messageboard was installed at the top of the center field upper deck—and the outfield fence being painted blue from the previous aqua. The field originally used &quot;Gamesaver vacuum vehicles&quot; to dry the surface, though they were later replaced by an underground drainage system.

In 1975, the baseball field&#x27;s outfield fences were moved 10 feet (3 m) closer to home plate, in an attempt to boost home run numbers. The bullpens were moved to multiple locations throughout the stadium&#x27;s history; however, their first position was also their final one—beyond the right-field fence. A &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; story in 1970 stated that the new stadium boasted 1,632 floodlight bulbs.
Due to Three Rivers Stadium&#x27;s multi-purpose design, bands including Alice Cooper, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones, and The Who hosted concerts at the venue. On August 11, 1985, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band hosted the largest concert in Pittsburgh history, when they performed for 65,935 on-lookers. And in 1992, the Pittsburgh Penguins celebrated their second Stanley Cup victory at the Stadium. The stadium hosted various Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses conventions, including international conventions in 1973 and 1978, and a centennial conference in 1984. A Billy Graham Crusade took place at Three Rivers in June 1993. The venue also served as the premiere of the 1994 Disney film &quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot; which, despite being based around the California Angels, paid homage to the original 1951 film, which featured the Pirates in &quot;heavenly&quot; need.

Three Rivers Stadium had a beverage contract with Coca-Cola throughout its history. It was during the Steelers&#x27; stay in Three Rivers that the now famous &quot;Mean Joe&quot; Greene Coke commercial aired, leading to a longstanding relationship between the two. When Heinz Field opened, Coca-Cola also assumed the beverage contract for that stadium (the Pirates signed a deal with Pepsi for PNC Park before signing with Coke again in 2014), and also became the primary sponsor for the Steelers&#x27; team Hall of Fame, the Coca-Cola Great Hall. After the initial 10-year contract expired, Heinz Field contracted with Pepsi for exclusive pouring rights, breaking a 50-year tradition with the Steelers.

===Replacement===
By the early 1990s, multipurpose stadiums had gone out of fashion. They were considered by many to be ugly and obsolete, as well as not financially viable. Joining a wave of sports construction that swept the United States in the 1990s, both the Pirates and Steelers began a push for a new stadium. This eventually culminated in the Regional Renaissance Initiative, an 11-county 1997 voter referendum to raise the sales tax in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Allegheny County and ten adjacent counties 0.5% for seven years to fund separate new stadiums for the Pirates and Steelers, as well as an expansion of the David L. Lawrence Convention Center and various other local development projects. After being hotly debated throughout the entire southwestern Pennsylvania region the initiative was soundly defeated in all 11 counties; only in Allegheny County was it even close (58-42).

The initiative&#x27;s defeat led to the development of &quot;Plan B&quot;, an alternate funding proposal that used a combination of monies from the Allegheny Regional Asset District (an extra 1% sales tax levied on Allegheny County), state and federal monies and a number of other sources. Despite polls which showed that the public was opposed to this plan as well, on February 3, 1999, the state funding portion of &quot;Plan B&quot; passed the Pennsylvania State House and Senate, clearing the way for construction.

Ground was broken for the new stadiums in 1999. On October 1, 2000, the Pirates were defeated 10–9 by the Chicago Cubs in their final game at Three Rivers Stadium. After the game, former Pirate Willie Stargell threw out the ceremonial last pitch (he died the following April hours before the first regular season game was played at PNC Park). Two months later on December 16, 2000, the Steelers concluded play at Three Rivers Stadium, with a 24–3 victory over the Washington Redskins.

Three Rivers Stadium was imploded on February 11, 2001, at 8:03 a.m. on a chilly day. Over 20,000 people viewed the implosion from Point State Park. Another 3,000-4,000 viewing from atop Mount Washington and an uncounted number of people viewed the demolition from various high points across the city. Mark Loizeaux of Controlled Demolition, Inc. pushed the button that set off the 19-second implosion, while Elizabeth and Joseph King pushed the &quot;ceremonial old fashioned dynamite plunger&quot;. The demolition cost $5.1 million and used of explosive. With the newly constructed Heinz Field only away, effects from the blast were a concern. Doug Loizeaux, Mark&#x27;s younger brother and vice president of Controlled Demolition, Inc., was happy to report that there was no debris within of Heinz Field.

At the time of the demolition, Three Rivers Stadium still had $27.93 million in debt ($ million today), some of it from the original construction but the rest from renovations in the mid-1980s, bringing more criticism to the public funding of sports stadiums. The debt was finally retired by 2010.

Like most stadiums demolished during this time whose replacements were located nearby (including the Civic Arena over a decade later), the site of Three Rivers Stadium mostly became a parking lot. Much like the Pittsburgh Penguins would do with the site of Civic Arena, the Steelers retained development rights to the site of Three Rivers, and would later build Stage AE on portions of the site, as well as an office building that hosts the studios for AT&amp;T SportsNet Pittsburgh, the headquarters of StarKist Tuna, and the regional headquarters of Del Monte Foods. In 2015, the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; moved into a new office building also built on a portion on the site after 53 years in the former &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; building and more than two centuries in Downtown.

On September 30, 2012, members of the Society for American Baseball Research marked and painted the home plate and second base of the former stadium on the 40th Anniversary of Roberto Clemente&#x27;s 3,000th hit. First and third bases could not be marked as the West General Robinson Street now runs over those locations. 

On December 23, 2012, on the 40th anniversary of the Immaculate Reception, the Steelers unveiled a monument at the exact spot where Franco Harris made the reception in the parking lot and corresponding sidewalk. The yard lines were also painted on the sidewalks. In the process of marking the yard lines, the second base was accidentally painted over.

In 2022, the faded home plate print and the missing second base were replaced by metal plaques created by the Society for American Baseball Research. The pitcher&#x27;s mound was also marked for the first time. The new plaques were officially revealed on September 30, 2022, the 50th Anniversary of Roberto Clemente&#x27;s 3,000th hit. 

In 2011, the &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot; reported that the Three Rivers Stadium website was still active, 11 years after the facility&#x27;s demolition. The newspaper has revisited the issue and reported several times that the website remained active. In 2020, nearly twenty years after the stadium had been demolished, the site had finally been taken down due to the domain expiring. However, an archive of the original site still exists, albeit at a different domain name.

==Stadium usage==

===Panthers===
The Pitt Panthers played at Three Rivers Stadium on multiple occasions. The Panthers played their full home schedule there for the 2000 season, going 7–4. They played there in the following games:

===Pirates===
Three Rivers Stadium opened on July 16, 1970, but the Pirates lost 3–2 to the Cincinnati Reds in front of 48,846 spectators. The first pitch was thrown by Dock Ellis—a strike—to Ty Cline. The first hit in the stadium was by Pittsburgh&#x27;s Richie Hebner, in the bottom of the first inning. The Pirates lifted their television blackout policy for home games so that local fans could see the inaugural game. The Pirates&#x27; lowest season of attendance was 1985, at an average of 9,085. The average attendance would peak in 1991, when the Pirates averaged 25,498 per game. Game one of the 1970 NLCS, at Three Rivers Stadium, was the first postseason baseball game to be played on an artificial surface. The following season, the Pirates advanced to the World Series against the Baltimore Orioles. Three Rivers Stadium hosted game four, in which the Pirates defeated the Orioles in the first night game in the history of the World Series. Pittsburgh hosted its third All-Star Game in 1974. The National League won the game 7–2 and the Pirates&#x27; Ken Brett was the winning pitcher. In 1979, the Pirates again won a World Championship, yet again defeating the Baltimore Orioles in a seven-game World Series. Games 3, 4 and 5 of the Series were played at Three Rivers. 15 years later, the midsummer classic returned in 1994. With 59,568 in attendance, the largest crowd to ever attend a baseball game at the stadium, the National League won 8–7 in the tenth inning. On July 6, 1980, the Pirates beat the Chicago Cubs 5–4 in 20 innings—the most innings ever played at the stadium. The longest game at the stadium was played on August 6, 1989, when Jeff King hit a walk-off home run 5 hours and 42 minutes into the 18-inning contest, as the Pirates once again beat the Cubs 5–4. On September 30, 1972, Pirates&#x27; right-fielder Roberto Clemente got his 3,000th hit at Three Rivers Stadium, three months before his death.

Only 13 home runs were ever hit into the upper deck of Three Rivers Stadium. Willie Stargell is the all-time leader in upper deck shots at the stadium with four; Jeff Bagwell hit two, while Bob Robertson, Bobby Bonilla, Devon White, Greg Luzinski, Glenallen Hill, Howard Johnson, and Mark Whiten (his home run struck the facade) hit one each.

It was at this venue in 1998 where Sammy Sosa hit his Cub-franchise record 57th homer of the season, besting Hack Wilson, whose record stood for 68 years.

===Steelers===
The Pittsburgh Steelers played their first game in Three Rivers Stadium on September 20, 1970—a 19–7 loss to the Houston Oilers. Throughout their 31 seasons in Three Rivers Stadium, the Steelers posted a record of 182–72, including a 13-5 playoff record, and defeated every visiting franchise at least once from the stadium&#x27;s opening to close, enjoying perfect records there against seven teams. The Steelers sold out every home game from 1972 through the closing of the stadium, a streak which continues through 2008. The largest attendance for a football game was the 1994 AFC Championship Game on January 15, 1995, when 61,545 spectators witnessed the Steelers lose to the San Diego Chargers. On December 23, 1972, Three Rivers Stadium was site to the Immaculate Reception, which became regarded as one of the greatest plays in NFL history. Three Rivers Stadium hosted seven AFC Championship Games from 1972 to 1997; the Steelers won four. In the 1995 AFC Championship Game, the Steelers&#x27; Randy Fuller deflected a Hail Mary pass intended for Indianapolis Colts receiver Aaron Bailey as time expired, to send the franchise to Super Bowl XXX. A Steelers symbol recognized worldwide, the Terrible Towel debuted on December 27, 1975, at Three Rivers Stadium. The Steelers would move to Heinz Field after it was closed.

<doc id="737742" wikidata="Q731840" url="?curid=737742" title="Francisco Xavier do Amaral">
<text>Francisco Xavier do Amaral (3 December 1937 – 6 March 2012) was an East Timorese politician. A founder of the &quot;Frente Revolucionária de Timor Leste Independente&quot; (Fretilin), Amaral was sworn in as the first President of East Timor when the country, then a Portuguese colony, made a unilateral declaration of independence on 28 November 1975. He was a member of the National Parliament for the Timorese Social Democratic Association from 2001 until his death in 2012. Amaral was also known as &quot;Abo (Grandfather) Xavier&quot;, a term of endearment, by East Timorese.

==Biography==

===Early life===

A member of the Mambai ethnic group, Amaral was a descendant of kings who ruled what is now the south-central Manufahi District of East Timor.

===President of East Timor===

Amaral founded the Timorese Social Democratic Association in the early 1970s. The party, which is considered a forerunner of the Fretilin, advocated for independence from Portugal.

Amaral was sworn in as the country&#x27;s first President on 28 November 1975, when the Democratic Republic of East Timor declared independence from Portugal. His tenure in the presidency last only 10 days before he was forced to flee into the mountainous interior with the Fretilin due to the Indonesian invasion of the country on 7 December 1975. Though most world governments refused to recognise East Timor&#x27;s independence or Amaral&#x27;s authority during his ten-day rule in 1975, the East Timorese people regarded Amaral as the country&#x27;s first president, according to Damien Kingsbury, a political science professor at Deakin University and a leading expert on East Timor.

===Imprisonment and exile===

Amaral was ousted from Fretilin and imprisoned by the party&#x27;s Marxist faction in 1977 amid disagreements over strategy for opposing the Indonesian occupation. The Fretilin faction held and moved him frequently as they battled the Indonesian military forces. He was abandoned in August 1978 when his Fretilin captors were ambushed, and was promptly arrested by the Indonesian Army.

From the late 1980s until 1999, Amaral was co-chairman of the Indonesian-Portugal Friendship Association (PPIP), an NGO established in Jakarta to establish dialogue with Portuguese community leaders in attempts to find a non-political people-initiated solution for East Timor.

The Indonesian government used Amaral as a propaganda tool to divide the East Timorese independence movement following his capture. He was exiled to Bali, where he was forced to work as a house servant for General Dading Kalbuadi, a leader of the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. He was moved to Jakarta in 1983, where he befriended another Timorese exiled prisoner, Xanana Gusmão. Amaral and Gusmão became close friends during their imprisonment in Jakarta.

Amaral attempted to negotiate several peace agreements with the Indonesian government while in exile in Jakarta. His negotiations with Indonesia proved highly controversial with other East Timorese separatists. He was released from General Kalbuadi&#x27;s house in Jakarta, but lived in poverty for the remainder of his exile. Amaral remained in Jakarta from 1983 until Indonesia&#x27;s withdrawal from East Timor in 1999.

===Return to East Timor (2000–2012)===

Amaral relaunched his Timorese Social Democratic Association once he returned from exile. He was a candidate for President of East Timor in three presidential elections in 2002, 2007, and 2012.

In late 2001, his Timorese Social Democratic Association nominated him as a presidential candidate in the first post-occupation election, held in April 2002. His opponent in the 2002 election was his friend, Xanana Gusmão. Amaral publicly stated that he expected to lose to Gusmão, but believed that East Timor&#x27;s young democracy deserved to have a real competition in the race. Gusmão won the election in a landslide.

Amaral ran for president for a second time in the April 2007 presidential election, taking fourth place with 14.39% of the vote in the first round. Another of Amaral&#x27;s friends, Jose Ramos Horta, won the second round and was elected president.

Amaral received a cancer diagnosis in 2011. Amaral was one of thirteen candidates nominated for the 2012 presidential election, which was held on 17 March 2012. However, Amaral proved too seriously ill to appear at the official launch of the presidential campaign on 29 February 2012, which jeopardised his candidacy and the election. The National Parliament of East Timor met in a plenary session in early March 2012, specifically to amend the presidential election law so that Amaral&#x27;s absence from the launch would not negate the entire election.

Francisco Xavier do Amaral died at Guido Valadares National Hospital in Dili at 8:44 a.m. on 6 March 2012, at the age of 74. Following a three day period of national mourning, he was given a state funeral and buried at the in Dili.

==Legacy==

On 20 May 2017, for the 15th anniversary of the restoration of East Timor&#x27;s independence, a statue of Francisco Amaral was inaugurated in Dili, at the roundabout near the Convention Center.

<doc id="737748" wikidata="Q1151177" url="?curid=737748" title="PNC Park">
<text>PNC Park is a baseball stadium on the North Shore of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is the fifth location to serve as the ballpark of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Pittsburgh Pirates. Opened during the 2001 MLB season, PNC Park sits along the Allegheny River with a view of the Downtown Pittsburgh skyline. Constructed of steel and limestone, it has a natural grass playing surface and can seat 38,747 people for baseball. It was built just to the east of its predecessor, Three Rivers Stadium, which was demolished in 2001.

Plans to build a new stadium for the Pirates originated in 1991 but did not come to fruition for five years. Funded in conjunction with Acrisure Stadium and the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, the park was built for $216 million in 24 months, faster than most modern stadiums. Built in the &quot;retro-classic&quot; style modeled after past venues like Pittsburgh&#x27;s Forbes Field, PNC Park also introduced unique features, such as the use of limestone in the building&#x27;s facade. The park has a riverside concourse, steel truss work, an extensive out-of-town scoreboard, and local eateries. Several tributes to former Pirate Roberto Clemente are incorporated into the ballpark, and the nearby Sixth Street Bridge was renamed in his honor. In addition to the Pirates&#x27; regular-season and postseason home games, PNC Park has hosted other events, including the 2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game and numerous concerts.

PNC Financial Services originally purchased the naming rights in 1998 for $30 million over 20 years, and currently holds the rights through 2031.

Several writers have called PNC Park one of the best baseball stadiums in America, citing its location, views of the Pittsburgh skyline and Allegheny River, timeless design, and clear angles of the field from every seat.

==History==

===Planning and funding===
On September 5, 1991, Pittsburgh mayor Sophie Masloff proposed a new 44,000-seat stadium for the Pittsburgh Pirates on the city&#x27;s North Side. Three Rivers Stadium, the Pirates&#x27; and Steelers&#x27; home at the time, had been designed for functionality rather than &quot;architecture and aesthetics&quot;. As well, its location made it hard to reach from much of the city, with traffic congestion before and after games. Discussions about a new ballpark took place, but were never seriously considered until entrepreneur Kevin McClatchy purchased the team in February 1996. Until McClatchy&#x27;s purchase, plans about the team remaining in Pittsburgh were uncertain. In 1996, Masloff&#x27;s successor, Tom Murphy, created the &quot;Forbes Field II Task Force&quot;. Made up of 29 political and business leaders, the team studied the challenges of constructing a new ballpark. Their final report, published on June 26, 1996, evaluated 13 possible locations. The &quot;North Side site&quot; was recommended due to its affordable cost, potential to develop the surrounding area, and opportunity to incorporate the city skyline into the stadium&#x27;s design. The site selected for the ballpark is just upriver from the site of early Pirates home field Exposition Park.
After a political debate, public money was used to fund PNC Park. Originally, a sales tax increase was proposed to fund three projects: PNC Park, Heinz Field (home of the Steelers, now called Acrisure Stadium), and an expansion of the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. That proposal was soundly rejected in a 1997 referendum known as the Regional Renaissance Initiative.

The city then developed &quot;Plan B,&quot; which proved similarly controversial. It was labeled &quot;Scam B&quot; by opponents who said it would consume too much public money; one member of the Allegheny Regional Asset District board called the use of tax dollars &quot;corporate welfare&quot; while others said the Pirates should contribute more than their pledged $40 million. Still, the board approved Plan B on July 9, 1998; it included $228 million for PNC Park in a total package of $809 million. Shortly thereafter, the Pirates made a deal with Pittsburgh city officials to remain in the city until at least 2031.

There was popular sentiment by fans for the Pirates to name the stadium after former outfielder Roberto Clemente. However, locally based PNC Financial Services purchased the stadium&#x27;s naming rights in August 1998. Under the agreement, PNC Bank paid the Pirates about $2 million each year through 2020; it also maintains a full-service PNC branch at the stadium. The total cost of PNC Park was $216 million. Shortly after the naming rights deal was announced, the city of Pittsburgh renamed the 6th Street Bridge near the southeast corner of the site of the park the Roberto Clemente Bridge as a compromise to fans who had wanted the park named after Clemente.

===Design and construction===
Kansas City-based Populous (then HOK Sport), which designed many other major league ballparks of the late 20th and early 21st century, designed the ballpark. The design and construction management team consisted of the Dick Corporation and Barton Malow. An effort was made in the design of PNC Park to salute other &quot;classic style&quot; ballparks, such as Fenway Park, Wrigley Field, and Pittsburgh&#x27;s Forbes Field; the design of the ballpark&#x27;s archways, steel truss work, and light standards are results of this goal. PNC Park was the first two-deck ballpark to be built in the United States since Milwaukee County Stadium opened in 1953. The park features a 24 by 42 foot (7.3 by 12.8 m) Sony JumboTron, which is accompanied by the first-ever LED video boards in an outdoor MLB stadium. PNC Park is the first stadium to feature an out-of-town scoreboard with the score, inning, number of outs, and base runners for every other game being played around the league. The out-of-town scoreboard was disabled for the 2022 season and replaced with advertising. After significant fan outcry, the decision was reversed, and the out-of-town scoreboard was returned in 2023.
Ground was broken for PNC Park on April 7, 1999, after a ceremony to christen the newly renamed Roberto Clemente Bridge. As part of original plans to create an enjoyable experience for fans, the bridge is closed to vehicular traffic on game days to allow spectators to park in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Golden Triangle and walk across the bridge to the stadium. PNC Park was built with Kasota limestone shipped from a Minnesota river valley, to contrast the brick bases of other modern stadiums. The American-made raw steel for the ballpark was fabricated in Brownsville, Pennsylvania, by Wilhelm and Krus. The stadium was constructed over a 24-month span—at the time of construction, three months faster than any other modern major league ballpark—and the Pirates played their first game less than two years after groundbreaking. The quick construction was accomplished with the use of special computers, which relayed building plans to builders 24 hours per day. In addition, all 23 labor unions involved in the construction signed a pact that they would not strike during the building process. As a result of union involvement and attention to safety regulations, the construction manager, the Dick Corporation, received a merit award for its safety practices from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

=== Statues ===

Statues of Pirates&#x27; Hall of Famers Honus Wagner, Roberto Clemente, Willie Stargell and Bill Mazeroski are positioned at various points outside of PNC Park. Wagner and Clemente&#x27;s statues were previously located outside of Three Rivers Stadium, and after the venue was imploded, the two statues were removed from their locations, refurbished, and relocated outside PNC Park.

Wagner&#x27;s statue was originally unveiled at Forbes Field in 1955. The base of Clemente&#x27;s statue is shaped like a baseball diamond, with dirt from three of the fields Clemente played at—Santurce Field in Carolina, Puerto Rico, Forbes Field, and Three Rivers Stadium—at each base.

On October 1, 2000, after the final game at Three Rivers Stadium, Stargell threw out the ceremonial last pitch. He was presented with a model of a statue that was to be erected in his honor outside of PNC Park. Stargell&#x27;s statue was officially unveiled on April 7, 2001; however, Stargell did not attend due to health problems and died of a stroke two days later. A statue for Mazeroski was added at the right field entrance, at the south end of Mazeroski Way, during the 2010 season. This was the 50th anniversary of the Pirates&#x27; 1960 World Series championship, which Mazeroski clinched with a Game 7 walk-off home run at Forbes Field. The statue itself was designed based on that event.

===Opening and reception===

The Pirates opened PNC Park with two exhibition games against the New York Mets—the first of which was played on March 31, 2001. The first official baseball game played in PNC Park was between the Cincinnati Reds and the Pirates, on April 9, 2001. The Reds won the game by the final score of 8–2. The first pitch—a ball—was thrown from Pittsburgh&#x27;s Todd Ritchie to Barry Larkin. In the top of the first inning, Pittsburgh native Sean Casey&#x27;s two-run home run was the first hit in the park. The first Pirates&#x27; batter, Adrian Brown, struck out; however, later in the inning Jason Kendall singled—the first hit by a Pirate in their new stadium.

PNC Park had an average attendance of 30,742 people per game throughout its inaugural season, though it would drop approximately 27% the following season to 22,594 spectators per game. Throughout the 2001 season, businesses in downtown and on the Northside of Pittsburgh showed a 20–25% increase in business on Pirate game days.

Pirates&#x27; vice-president Steve Greenberg said, &quot;We said when construction began that we would build the best ballpark in baseball, and we believe we&#x27;ve done that.&quot; Major League Baseball executive Paul Beeston said the park was &quot;the best he&#x27;s seen so far in baseball&quot;. Many of the workers who built the park said that it was the nicest that they had seen. Jason Kendall, Pittsburgh&#x27;s catcher at the opening of the park, called PNC Park &quot;the most beautiful ballpark in the game&quot;. Different elements of PNC Park were used in the design of New York&#x27;s Citi Field.
Upon opening in 2001, PNC Park was praised by fans and media alike. ESPN.com writer Jim Caple ranked PNC Park as the best stadium in Major League Baseball, with a score of 95 out of 100. Caple compared the park to Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Fallingwater, calling the stadium itself &quot;perfect&quot;, and citing high ticket prices as the only negative aspect of visiting the park. Jay Ahjua, author of &quot;Fields of Dreams: A Guide to Visiting and Enjoying All 30 Major League Ballparks&quot;, called PNC Park one of the &quot;top ten places to watch the game&quot;. Eric Enders, author of &quot;Ballparks Then and Now&quot; and co-author of &quot;Big League Ballparks: The Complete Illustrated History&quot;, said it was &quot;everything a baseball stadium could hope to be&quot; and &quot;an immediate contender for the title of best baseball park ever built&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Men&#x27;s Fitness&quot; named the park one of &quot;10 big league parks worth seeing this summer&quot;. A 2010 unranked list of &quot;America&#x27;s 7 Best Ballparks&quot; published by ABC News noted that PNC Park &quot;combines the best features of yesterday&#x27;s ballparks—rhythmic archways, steel trusswork and a natural grass playing field—with the latest in fan and player amenities and comfort&quot;. In 2017, a panel of &quot;Washington Post&quot; sports writers ranked it the 2nd-best stadium in MLB. A 2018 article in &quot;Parade&quot; dubbed PNC Park &quot;The Jewel of the Allegheny&quot;.

===Alterations===
An exhibit honoring Pittsburgh&#x27;s Negro league baseball teams was introduced in 2006. Located by the stadium&#x27;s left-field entrance, the display features statues of seven players who competed for the city&#x27;s Homestead Grays and Pittsburgh Crawfords, including Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige. The exhibit also includes the Legacy Theatre, a 25-seat facility that plays a film about Pittsburgh&#x27;s history with the Negro leagues. The Pirates donated the statues to the Josh Gibson Foundation in 2015.
In 2007, Allegheny County passed a ban on smoking in most public places, thus making PNC Park completely smoke-free. Before the 2008 season, the Pirates made multiple alterations to PNC Park. The biggest change was removing the Outback Steakhouse located in the left field stands, and adding a new restaurant known as &quot;The Hall of Fame Club&quot;. Unlike its predecessor, &quot;The Hall of Fame Club&quot; is open to all ticket-holders on game days; it includes an outdoor patio with a bar and seats with a view of the field. The Pirates feature bands in &quot;The Hall of Fame Club&quot; after the completion of select games—the first performance was by Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers. The Pirates also announced a program to make the park more environmentally friendly, by integrating &quot;greening initiatives, sustainable business practices and educational outreach&quot;. In addition, club and suite sections were outfitted with new televisions.

In 2012, the &quot;Budweiser Bow Tie,&quot; a bar and lounge located in the right-field corner of the ballpark, was added. The section includes ticketed seats as well as areas for groups and the general public. This addition was expected to cost about $1 million.

Improvements made for the 2015 season include the left-field terrace between the left-field bleachers and the Rivertowne Brewing Hall of Fame Club. Its two levels for standing room, including of drink rails, are open to any fan with a ticket. Added next to the terraces was &quot;The Porch&quot;, a patio that overlooks the center field and has bar tables and outdoor sofa-style seating and accommodates groups of 25 people. Other 2015 additions include The Corner, a bar at the base of the left-field rotunda with nine flat-screen TVs; Terrace Bar, a bar in the upper concourse; and Pirates Outfitters, a merchandise shop next to the home-plate entrance. The Pirates paid all costs for the additions to the park.

Before the 2017 season, the manual out-of-town scoreboard on the right-field wall was replaced by an LED screen.

Improvements for the 2022 season included the replacement of several rows of seats in center field and the security booth located next to the batter&#x27;s eye by two open-air bars, where fans can watch the game while ordering drinks. A pirate-ship-themed playground for kids was added in this area, along with signs and plaques detailing the club&#x27;s history and five championships. Outside the park, the Pirates added a display near the Center Field entrance commemorating the team&#x27;s retired numbers, and large baseballs along the Allegheny River bearing the names of Pittsburgh-based members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, including players from the local Negro league franchises, the Homestead Grays and Pittsburgh Crawfords. In September 2022, the Pirates unveiled their own Hall of Fame, located in the Legacy Square area of the ballpark near the left field rotunda. The inaugural class featured 15 members.

Ahead of the 2023 season, the Pirates replaced and expanded the main scoreboard.

==Notable events==

===Baseball===
PNC Park hosted the 77th Major League Baseball All-Star Game on July 11, 2006. The American League defeated the National League 3–2, with 38,904 spectators in attendance. The first All-Star Game in PNC Park, it was the 5th All-Star Game hosted in Pittsburgh, and the first since 1994. During the game, late Pirate Roberto Clemente was honored with the Commissioner&#x27;s Historic Achievement Award; his wife, Vera, accepted on his behalf. The stadium hosted the Home Run Derby the previous evening; Ryan Howard, of the Philadelphia Phillies, won the title. During the Derby, Howard and David Ortiz hit home runs into the Allegheny River.

On September 28, 2012, PNC Park saw its first no-hitter when Reds pitcher Homer Bailey no-hit the Pirates, 1–0. PNC Park has yet to see a no-hitter or perfect game thrown by a Pirate.

On October 1, 2013, the Pirates hosted the Cincinnati Reds in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. This marked the first time a playoff game was played at PNC Park. The Pirates won 6–2, their first postseason victory since 1992, in front of a record crowd of 40,629. The 2014 and 2015 National League Wild Card games were also played at PNC Park.

On July 20, 2020, it was reported that the Pirates were exploring offering use of PNC Park as a temporary home stadium for the Toronto Blue Jays for the 2020 MLB season, as the team was unable to obtain clearance from the Canadian government to play at Rogers Centre under travel restrictions issued because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The team&#x27;s current GM Ben Cherington previously worked for the Blue Jays before being hired by the Pirates. On July 22, 2020, the Toronto Blue Jays were denied permission to play home games at PNC Park by the Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine and Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf.

===College baseball===
The first collegiate baseball game at PNC Park was played on May 6, 2003, between the Pitt Panthers and the Duquesne Dukes, who won 2–1. Dubbed the City Game, it was played annually (except in 2007, when the game was canceled because of poor field conditions) through 2010, at which point Pitt had won four games and Duquesne two. Duquesne disbanded their baseball program after the 2010 season.

===Concerts===
PNC Park has hosted many touring artists and musicians, including Pink, Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band, Styx, Jason Aldean, Billy Joel, Elton John, The Rolling Stones, Pearl Jam, Jimmy Buffett, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, Dave Matthews Band, Ed Sheeran, Zac Brown Band, Green Day, Fall Out Boy, Weezer, Metallica, Def Leppard and Mötley Crüe.

===In film===
The park served as a location for the films &quot;She&#x27;s Out of My League&quot; (2010), &quot;Abduction&quot; (2011), &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; (2012) and &quot;Sweet Girl&quot; (2021).

===Other events===
PNC Park has hosted drills to practice evacuation and other responses to a terrorist attack. Members of the United States Department of Homeland Security laid out the groundwork for the initial drill in February 2004. In May 2005, 5,000 volunteers participated in the $1 million evacuation drill, which included mock explosions. A goal of the drill was to test the response of 49 western Pennsylvania emergency agencies. In April 2006, the Department of Homeland Security worked with the United States Coast Guard to develop a plan of response for the 2006 All-Star Game. Similar exercises were conducted on the Allegheny River in 2007.

==Special features==
===Playing surface and dimensions===

The playing surface of PNC Park is Tuckahoe Bluegrass, which is a mixture of various types of Kentucky Bluegrass. Installed before the 2009 season, the grass surface was selected for its &quot;high-quality pedigree that is ideal for Northern cities such as Pittsburgh&quot;. The infield dirt is a mixture known as &quot;Dura Edge Custom Pro Infield Mix&quot; and was designed solely for PNC Park. The warning track is crushed lava rock. The drainage system underneath the field is capable of handling of rain per hour. The original playing surface consisted of sand-based natural grass, and was replaced before the 2006 season. The playing surface also underwent a significant renovation following the 2016 season. The 2016 renovation included excavation of the top of rootzone soil, importing of rootzone material with improved physical properties, deep tillage, laser grading, and installation of new Kentucky bluegrass sod. The infield skin was also excavated to a depth of and replaced with new Dura Edge infield mix. Unlike most ballparks, PNC Park&#x27;s home dugout is located along the third base line instead of the first base line; giving the home team a view of the city skyline. The outfield fence ranges from a height of in left field to in center field and in right field, a tribute to former Pirate right fielder Roberto Clemente, who wore number &quot;21&quot;. The distance from home plate to the outfield fence ranges from in right field to in left center; the straightaway center field fence is set at . At its closest point, the Allegheny River is from the plate. On July 6, 2002, Daryle Ward became the first player to hit the river &quot;on the fly&quot;. On June 2, 2013, Garrett Jones became only the second player to accomplish the feat, and was the first Pirate to do so. On May 19, 2015, Pirates first baseman Pedro Alvarez became the third person to do this, although the ball actually landed in a boat on the river rather than in the water. Within a two-week period (May 8 and May 22, 2019), Pirates first baseman Josh Bell splashed the fourth and fifth home runs directly into the Allegheny River; the first one is estimated to have traveled better than , while the second traveled more than . The longest home run in PNC Park history was hit to left-center field by Sammy Sosa on April 12, 2002. On June 30, 2023, Carlos Santana became the fifth person to accomplish this feat when he hit a walk-off home run to win.
===Seating, attendance, and ticket prices===
During its opening season, PNC Park&#x27;s seating capacity of 38,496 was the second-smallest of any major league stadium (the smallest being Fenway Park). Seats are angled toward the field and aisles are lowered to give spectators improved views of the field. The majority of the seats (26,000) are on the first level, and the highest seat in the stadium is above the playing surface. At , the batter is closer to the seats behind home plate than to the pitcher. At their closest point, seating along the baselines is from the bases. The four-level steel rotunda and a section above the out-of-town scoreboard offer standing-room-only space. With the exception of the bleacher sections, all seats in the park offer a view of Pittsburgh&#x27;s skyline.

In its opening season, PNC Park&#x27;s tickets were priced between $9 and $35 for general admission. One of only two teams not to increase ticket prices entering the 2009 season, PNC Park ranked as having the third-cheapest average ticket prices in the league in 2009. Despite price increases in the 2015 season, the average ticket price at PNC Park remained in the bottom five among MLB teams. The stadium&#x27;s average ticket price held between $15 and $17 from 2006 to 2013 (among the lowest in Major League Baseball), then rose to $18.32 in 2014, $19.99 in 2015, and $29.96 in 2016.

In the stadium&#x27;s first decade, average attendance dipped under 20,000 fans per game four times. Before 2013, the Pirates had only one winning record since 1992. Through 2004, 5% of games played at PNC Park were sold out. The number of sellouts increased in 2012 and 2013; after filling PNC Park 17 times in 2012, the team played to capacity crowds at 23 games in 2013. In 2014, average attendance crossed the 30,000 mark for the first time since PNC Park&#x27;s inaugural season in 2001, and remained above 30,000 in 2015 before dropping to 27,000 in 2016.

===Eateries===

The main eating concourse, known as &quot;Tastes of Pittsburgh&quot;, features a wide range of options including traditional ballpark foods, hometown specialties, and more exotic fare like sushi. Pittsburgh&#x27;s hometown specialties include Primanti Brothers sandwiches, whose signature item consists of meat, cheese, hand-cut French fries, tomatoes, and coleslaw between two slices of Italian bread. Other local eateries offered include Mrs. T&#x27;s Pierogies, Quaker Steak &amp; Lube, Augustine&#x27;s Pizza, and Benkovitz Seafood. Located behind center field seating is Manny&#x27;s BBQ, which offers various barbecue meals. It is named for former Pirates&#x27; catcher Manny Sanguillén, who has been known to sign autographs for fans waiting in line. For the 2008 season, the Pirates created an all-you-can-eat section in the right field corner. Fans seated in the section are allowed &quot;unlimited hot dogs, hamburgers, nachos, salads, popcorn, peanuts, ice cream and pop&quot; for an entire game. In addition to the food offered, fans are free to bring their own food into the stadium, a rarity among the league&#x27;s ballparks.

For its first 13 years, PNC Park sold Pepsi products, a contrast from its predecessor Three Rivers Stadium, which sold Coca-Cola products, as well as Heinz Field and Mellon Arena. In right field, several versions of the Pepsi Globe as well as a Pepsi bottle were displayed on large posts behind the stands and lit up every time the Pirates hit a home run. In 2014, the Pirates switched to Coca-Cola. The Pepsi signage in right field was converted into advertising for locally based health insurance company Highmark.

In 2016, PNC Park made news with their introduction of the &quot;Cracker Jack &amp; Mac Dog&quot;. The foot-long all-beef hot dog was topped with macaroni and cheese, salted caramel sauce, deep-fried pickled jalapeños and a side of caramel-covered popcorn. Instead of a bun, naan bread was used to hold everything together.

===Contractors===
As with its predecessor, PNC Park&#x27;s concessions service provider is Aramark, while the premium seating areas (The Lexus Club, PBC Level and Suites Level) are serviced by Levy Restaurants. In 2019, The Lexus Club was replaced by the Hyundai Club and Aramark took over food service.

===Public address announcers===
From its opening until 2021, Tim DeBacco served as PNC Park&#x27;s public address announcer. He is famous for his opening &quot;Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls and welcome to PNC Park&quot;, and signing off &quot;Thank you, and good night.&quot; After retirement in 2022, various Pittsburgh personalities including Guy Junker, Adam Gusky, Larry Richert, and Dave Cawley served as guest announcers. Junker became the public address announcer for the 2023 season with Joe Klimchak and Debbie Becker serve as the co-announcers.

==Transportation access==
PNC Park is located at exit 1B of Interstate 279 and within of both Interstate 376 and Interstate 579. The park is also served by the North Side transit station of the Pittsburgh subway system.

<text>William Wilson Morgan (January 3, 1906 – June 21, 1994) was an American astronomer and astrophysicist. The principal theme in Morgan&#x27;s work was stellar and galaxy classification. He is also known for helping prove the existence of spiral arms in our galaxy. In addition to his scientific achievements he served as professor and astronomy director for the University of Chicago&#x27;s Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin and was the managing editor for George Hale&#x27;s Astrophysical Journal.

==Scientific achievements==
Along with Philip Keenan he developed the MK system for the classification of stars through their spectra. He also developed several galaxy morphological classification systems, including the first systems to use the physical, quantifiable properties of galaxies, as opposed to simple, qualitative, eyeball estimates favoured by Edwin Hubble. He invented the now widely used classification cD for massive galaxies in the centres of galaxy clusters. In 1970, along with astronomer Laura P. Bautz, they created the still-used Bautz-Morgan classification scheme for clusters, which identifies those containing cD galaxies as the richest, type I clusters.

He worked at Yerkes Observatory for much of his career, including acting as its director from 1960 to 1963. Along with Donald Osterbrock and Stewart Sharpless, he used distance measurements of O and B type stars to show the existence of spiral arms in the Milky Way Galaxy.

From 1947 to 1952, Morgan was managing editor of the Astrophysical Journal, a publication originally started by George Hale to promote scientific cooperation between the world&#x27;s astrophysicists.

==Education==
Morgan attended Washington and Lee University but left just before the start of his senior year. He began working as a research assistant at Yerkes Observatory and started taking classes there (Yerkes is affiliated with the University of Chicago). Morgan graduated from the University of Chicago in 1927 with a Bachelor of Science degree on the basis of transfer credits from Washington and Lee combined with his subsequent courses at Yerkes Observatory. While at UC/Yerkes, Morgan continued his post-graduate studies and received a doctorate in December 1931.

==Professorship==
Morgan continued on at the University of Chicago and became an assistant professor in 1936, full professor in 1947, and was promoted to distinguished service professor in 1966.

One of his early graduate students in stellar classification was Nancy Grace Roman, who went on to become NASA&#x27;s first Chief of Astronomy. Morgan was the chairman of the UC Department of Astronomy from 1960 to 1966.

<doc id="737754" wikidata="Q295175" url="?curid=737754" title="Theuderic III">
<text>Theuderic III (also spelled Theuderich, Theoderic or Theodoric; , 651–691) was King of the Franks in the 7th century. He ruled Neustria and Burgundy on two occasions (in 673 and again from 675 to 691), as well as Austrasia from 679 until his death in 691.

The son of Clovis II and Balthild, Theuderic has been described as a puppet ruler – a &quot;roi fainéant&quot;. After the death of his older brother Chlothar III, he was appointed King in Neustria by Ebroin, Mayor of the Palace, in 673, though Childeric II of Austrasia displaced him soon thereafter. After Childeric II was killed in 675, Theuderic II retook the throne. He subsequently fought a war against Dagobert II, with his forces under Ebroin victorious at the Battle of Lucofao. After Dagobert was murdered in 679, Theuderic was also recognized as king in Austrasia as well.

He and the Neustrian mayor of the palace, Waratton, made peace with Pepin of Heristal, mayor of the palace of Austrasia, in 681. However, on Waratton&#x27;s death in 686, the new mayor, Berchar, made war with Austrasia and Pepin vanquished the Burgundo-Neustrian army under Berchar and Theuderic (a Neustrian) at the Battle of Tertry in 687, thus paving the way for Austrasian dominance of the Frankish state.

==Marriage and issue==
Theuderic married Chrothildis, a daughter of Ansegisel and Saint Begga of Landen.

They had the following children:

* Chlodwig III, king (677–694)
* Childebert III, king (678/679–711)
* Bertrada of Prüm, badess of Prüm (660 – after 721)

He married Amalberge (Saint Amalaberga) before 674, daughter of Wandregisis and Farahild.

<doc id="737757" wikidata="Q933307" url="?curid=737757" title="List of Castlevania characters">
<text>Listed below are characters from all of the &quot;Castlevania&quot; video games and related media adaptations, in the order of their introduction and the work&#x27;s release.

== Video games ==

===&quot;Castlevania&quot; (1986) and &quot;Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot;===

====Dracula====

The main antagonist of the &quot;Castlevania&quot; series is , based on the original character by Bram Stoker and his depiction in film. His real name is Dracula Vlad Tepes, and he is estimated to be over 800 years old by the time of &quot;&quot; (1997). With a few exceptions, he has starred in every title. The series mainly takes place in the eponymous castle of Count Dracula, which resurrects every hundred years to take over the world. Players often assume the role of the Belmonts, a family of vampire hunters who have opposed Dracula and his forces for centuries using the Vampire Killer, a legendary whip.

Dracula debuts in &quot;Castlevania&quot; (1986), as a vampire who was once defeated by Christopher Belmont one hundred years ago in Transylvania. He rises from the dead after his followers hold a black mass. Christopher&#x27;s descendant, Simon Belmont, enters Dracula&#x27;s castle and defeats him. Later titles introduce Dracula&#x27;s son, the dhampir Alucard, who sided with Trevor Belmont against his father. &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; reveals Alucard&#x27;s mother to be Lisa, a human Dracula fell in love with. Her execution for false charges of witchcraft left him griefstricken.

The 2010 reboot, &quot;&quot;, reintroduces Dracula as Gabriel Belmont, a member of the Brotherhood of Light who fights the Lords of Shadow to obtain the God Mask, which he believes can bring back his deceased wife, Marie. Gabriel eventually becomes a vampire and stars as Dracula in the sequels &quot;&quot; (2013) and &quot;&quot; (2014), where he searches for a way to end his immortality.

====Death====
 is present in all &quot;Castlevania&quot; games, except for &quot;Haunted Castle&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Castlevania II: Belmont&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. He is considered Dracula&#x27;s second-in-command and most trusted minion, and is often a boss fought toward the end of the game. As well, he has sometimes played an important role in the storyline, such as in &quot;&quot;. He is a playable character as the skeletal knight in &quot;Castlevania Judgment&quot;.

In most appearances, Death closely resembles the cultural personification of the Grim Reaper, being a legless skeleton who wears a hooded cloak and wields a scythe. Like Dracula, he can change into a second form upon being defeated, although this ability is not used as often.

Death also appears in the 2018 crossover fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; as a background character on the Dracula&#x27;s Castle stage. Simon and Richter&#x27;s reveal trailer features Death claiming the soul of a panicked Luigi before Simon intervenes.

The character of Zobek, Lord of the Dead (voiced by Patrick Stewart) in the reboot &quot;Castlevania: Lords of Shadow&quot; has been speculated to be the version of Death in this universe, due to his relationship with Dracula. Additionally, the Lord of the Necromancers is at one point referred to as &quot;Death itself&quot;. In the game&#x27;s , when Gabriel Belmont is forced into a confrontation with Zobek, he sheds his human form and takes on an appearance resembling a more traditional depiction of Death, including wielding a large scythe.

====Simon Belmont====

 is the first protagonist to appear in the series. He has appeared in &quot;Castlevania&quot;, &quot;Vampire Killer&quot;, &quot;Haunted Castle&quot;, &quot;Castlevania II: Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot;, &quot;Super Castlevania IV&quot;, &quot;Castlevania Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Castlevania Judgment&quot;, and &quot;,&quot; as well as in other games, such as &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.&quot;

====Carmilla====
 is a devoted worshipper of chaos and Dracula. Her name is a reference to the title character of the 1872 novel &quot;Carmilla&quot;, which predated Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; by 25 years. Her first appearance was as an antagonist in &quot;Castlevania II: Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot;. She later reappeared in &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; (styled as Camilla, non-canon), and &quot;Castlevania Judgment&quot;. 

Carmilla&#x27;s appearances and names have differed. In &quot;Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot;, she was originally known as in the instruction manual, though the in-game hidden clue refers to her as Camilla. The Camilla spelling is also used in &quot;Circle of the Moon&quot;, while all other appearances favor the Carmilla spelling. Her initial appearance in &quot;Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot; was interpreted as a mask that leaked tears of blood, while later appearances give her a humanoid form.

In &quot;Circle of the Moon&quot;, she successfully resurrects Dracula in her Austrian castle in 1830. However, he had not regained his full power, so to restore it they plan to sacrifice the vampire hunter Morris Baldwin, father to Hugh Baldwin and mentor to Nathan Graves, during a lunar eclipse of the full moon. As Nathan makes headway in his efforts to rescue his master, Camilla brainwashes Hugh and challenges Nathan to a battle in the Underground Waterway. Despite dying, Camilla revels in the fact the rite to restore Dracula&#x27;s power is nearly complete.

In &quot;Rondo of Blood&quot;, Carmilla has a blue-haired companion called , named after the central protagonist and narrator from &quot;Carmilla&quot;. She is a non-boss enemy in &quot;Portrait of Ruin&quot;, but is referred to as &quot;Carmilla&#x27;s eternal servant&quot; in her bestiary entry. In the reboot &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot;, Laura is Carmilla&#x27;s daughter, who challenges the main character Gabriel with dangerous games.

In the reboot &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot;, Carmilla is played by Sally Knyvette. She is one of the titular Lords, ruling over the vampires and is the second lord faced by the protagonist, Gabriel Belmont. She has a vampire &quot;daughter&quot; named Laura. Before sacrificing her soul to heaven, she was known to be a kind woman who loved all of Earth&#x27;s creatures, and became the opposite as a Lord of Shadow. This is a marked departure from the description of her in life in the original novel. However, the explicit sexuality sometimes attributed to her, most prominently in &quot;Castlevania: Judgment,&quot; is a reference to her characterization in the novel. She reappears in the sequel, &quot;&quot;, with a different appearance.

She appears in the 2018 crossover fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; as a background character on the Dracula&#x27;s Castle stage, based on her appearance in &quot;Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot;. She also appears at the end of Simon and Richter&#x27;s reveal trailer, frightening Luigi as his soul is about to re-enter his body.

====Ferryman====
The is a character whose task is to carry people across dangerous rivers, and takes characters to &quot;meet their destiny&quot;. He first appeared in &quot;Simon&#x27;s Quest,&quot; helping him to reach Rover Mansion. He later appears in &quot;&quot; and its remake, &quot;&quot;, &quot;,&quot; and&quot; &quot;.

===&quot;&quot; and &quot;Belmont&#x27;s Revenge&quot;===

====Christopher Belmont====
 starred in three &quot;Castlevania&quot; games as a protagonist, two for the Game Boy and one for the Wii. He was a pre-existing character in the &quot;Castlevania&quot; universe even before the games he starred in were released, as he is mentioned by name in the Japanese manual for the first Famicom &quot;Castlevania&quot; title, as the last Belmont to have defeated Dracula, one hundred years before Simon. The two Game Boy games were &quot;&quot; and &quot;Castlevania II: Belmont&#x27;s Revenge&quot;; in the former, Christopher sets out to defeat Dracula, while in the latter, he has to rescue his son, Soleil Belmont, after he is kidnapped by Count Dracula. He also appears in the Nintendo Wii game &quot;,&quot; which is a remake of &quot;The Adventure&quot;. He also was the protagonist in the limited &quot;Castlevania: The Belmont Legacy&quot; comic book series released by IDW Publishing. 

====Soleil Belmont====
 appears as a non-playable character in &quot;Castlevania II: Belmont&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, which was released for the Game Boy in 1991. He was called Soleiyu in the original release of &quot;Belmont&#x27;s Revenge,&quot; which was later corrected to Soleil (French for sun) in the 1998 re-release of the game for the European market.

In 1591, Soleil, who has recently celebrated his coming of age, is captured by Dracula&#x27;s minions and bewitched to do his bidding. With Soleil&#x27;s powers, Dracula is able to take human form once again. Christopher Belmont, his father, sets out to stop Dracula and rescue him, which he ultimately succeeds in.

===&quot;Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot; and &quot;&quot;===

====Trevor Belmont====
Trevor Belmont, known as in Japan, appears in &quot;Castlevania III: Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot;, &quot;Castlevania: Judgment&quot;, &quot;Akumajo Dracula Pachislot&quot;, and as a supporting character in &quot;.&quot;

In &quot;Castlevania III,&quot; Trevor defeated Dracula with help from Grant Danasty, Sypha Belnades and Alucard. He later marries Sypha Belnades and has children with her, adding the prodigious magical powers of the Belnades line to the Belmont line, which would be most prominently seen in Juste Belmont.

He later plays a secondary role in &quot;Curse of Darkness&quot;, where he investigates the rise of Dracula in the region. He confronts the Devil Forgemaster Hector, and although he initially treats Hector with contempt, he aids him in his quest. After Isaac injures him, Julia LaForeze gets to him in time, but he is unable to help in the battle. Meanwhile, Hector succeeds in stopping Isaac and sending Dracula&#x27;s castle back into the abyss, effectively lifting the curse placed three years prior. In the game, he is unlocked after beating the game with Hector.

He, along with Sypha Belnades and Grant Danasty, later makes a cameo appearance in &quot;,&quot; when zombies impersonate them to antagonize Alucard. These zombies also appear in &quot;,&quot; as Jonathan Morris and Charlotte Aulin trek through the Nest of Evil.

As shown in &quot;Castlevania: Judgment,&quot; by the time of Simon Belmont&#x27;s era, Trevor Belmont is looked up to by his future descendants, along with his wife Sypha, his ally Alucard, and his friend Grant, who are known as the &quot;Greatest Three&quot;. This pushes Simon, who is trapped in the Time Rift, to seek them to prove his worthiness. According to the Bradygames Official Guide, Trevor is approximately 185 cm (6&#x27;1&quot;) tall.

In the &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; series, Trevor is the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont. He debuts in &quot;Mirror of Fate,&quot; which reveals that, under orders from Pan, who foresaw Gabriel&#x27;s turn to darkness, the Brotherhood of Light kept his existence secret from his father, and he was not told of his parentage until adulthood. Shamed by his lineage, he ventures to Dracula&#x27;s castle to defeat his father and avenge his mother, but falls to Dracula and is impaled by his own combat cross. The Mirror of Fate reveals the truth of his father&#x27;s circumstances to Trevor, leading him to pity Dracula and reveal his identity as he dies. Horrified, Dracula attempts to revive Trevor by making him drink his blood, but seemingly fails. Never knowing Trevor&#x27;s true name, Dracula buries him within his castle in a coffin bearing the name &quot;Alucard&quot;. Thirty years later, Trevor reawakens as a vampire and takes on the name Alucard, after what was engraved on the coffin. He returns in the sequel &quot;Lords of Shadow 2,&quot; where he plays an important part in his father&#x27;s journey of redemption.

Trevor is voiced by Richard Madden in &quot;Mirror of Fate&quot;.

====Grant Danasty====
 is a character in &quot;Castlevania III&quot; and &quot;Castlevania: Judgment&quot;. He is a young pirate (listed as an acrobat in the ending sequence of &quot;Castlevania III&#x27;s&quot; Japanese version) and skilled knife fighter. His ship was corrupted by Dracula&#x27;s magic, and he was transformed into a demon who took over a clock tower in Wallachia. After being defeated by Trevor Belmont, he becomes human again and decides to travel with Trevor to Dracula&#x27;s castle; after Dracula&#x27;s defeat, he oversees the restoration of the lands that were affected by his evil. &quot;Castlevania Judgement&quot; reveals that he had loved Sypha and wanted to marry her; as a result, he was jealous toward Trevor and chose not to go to their wedding. While rebuilding the nation, he ended up in a time rift and was challenged to fight several champions. He believed that the time rift would give him a chance to change history, allowing him to marry Sypha instead. Instead, his encounters led him to do battle with both Sypha and Trevor; after defeating them, he learned to forgive his friend. After he is returned to his own time, he is later remembered not as the one who helped defeat Dracula, but as the man who rebuilt Wallachia. Despite this, Simon Belmont is shown to remember him as one of the &quot;Greatest Three&quot;, forever linked to the Belmont Family as a friend of his ancestors and a strong warrior. His surname is likely a reference to the historical House of Dăneşti, who were persecuted by the historical Vlad III. Dracula is similar to Vlad the Impaler, and is said to have killed Grant&#x27;s family. This mirrors the real life Vlad Dracula, who killed the Dăneşti Clan, the cousins of the family Vlad&#x27;s grandfather usurped.

====Sypha Belnades====
 appears in &quot;Castlevania III&quot; and &quot;Castlevania: Judgment&quot;. She is a priestess, although she introduces herself as a vampire hunter to Trevor in &quot;Castlevania III&#x27;s&quot; Japanese version, and witch of the church, who uses elemental magic in battle, Sypha hid her gender to become a vampire hunter, and fought for the church to destroy evil, despite her sister witches being hunted down by the church. In &quot;Judgement&quot;, she went on a journey to confront and destroy Dracula, but ended up in the Time Rift and took it upon herself to defeat those tainted by darkness, regardless of their alignment. After the Time Reaper is defeated, she is returned to her own era and continues her journey to destroy Dracula, but is defeated by his minion, the Cyclops, and imprisoned in stone. She is freed when Trevor Belmont kills the Cyclops, and aids him in his battle against Dracula. After Dracula&#x27;s death, she and Trevor married, adding her magical aptitude to the Belmont bloodline.

In the manual included with the Japanese &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot;, it is stated she lost her parents when she was young and was found wandering near a monastery in Wallachia, where she was adopted by the monks there. &quot;Judgment&quot; elaborates that she belonged to a coven of witches who were executed as a result of Dracula&#x27;s scheming. &quot;Judgment&#x27;s&quot; storyline reveals that Grant had carried a torch for her since their first meeting in Castlevania, but lacked the resolve to confess to her his feelings and let her slip into Trevor Belmont&#x27;s arms. Despite this, Sypha is said to have missed her friend when he chose to refuse his invitation to her marriage, patching up their friendship only after Grant&#x27;s return from the Rift. Sypha, Grant and Trevor are known in Belmont history as &quot;The Greatest Three&quot;, supreme friends and warriors who are an example for their descendants to follow.

In &quot;Lords of Shadow – Mirror of Fate&quot;, Sypha Belmont, née Belnades, is the wife of Trevor and the mother of Simon. She tries to comfort Trevor when he learns of his parents&#x27; fate, and sees him off as he ventures forth to battle Dracula. Following Trevor&#x27;s death, Dracula&#x27;s forces are unleashed and she is attacked, telling Simon to escape as she is killed by one of Dracula&#x27;s werewolves. Years later, her soul is found by Simon beneath Dracula&#x27;s castle, though he is unaware of her identity, and she joins him to protect him on his quest.

She is voiced by Charlotte Emerson in &quot;Lords of Shadow – Mirror of Fate&quot;.

====Alucard====

 is Dracula&#x27;s only child, the half-vampire son of him and a human woman named Lisa. He appears in &quot;Castlevania III&quot;, &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot;, &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot;, &quot;Judgment&quot;, &quot;Legends&quot;, and stars in &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot;. As a reference to the movie &quot;Son of Dracula&quot;, Alucard is &quot;Dracula&quot; spelled backwards. This is a title Alucard seems to have adopted for himself, as his actual full name is Adrian Fahrenheit Ţepeş.

Alucard also appeared in &quot;Captain N: The Game Master,&quot; voiced by Ian James Corlett.

Alucard appears in &quot;Mirror of Fate&quot;, the second game in the &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; series. It is revealed that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont, the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont, before he was turned into a vampire. Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were. Believing that Dracula murdered his mother in cold blood, he decides to pursue him in hopes of destroying him and bringing peace. During the fight, Trevor is defeated and stabbed with his Combat Cross. As he is dying, through the Mirror of Fate he finally realizes the truth of what happened to Gabriel and feels sorry for him, calling him his father. Dracula learns who Trevor was through the Mirror of Fate, and feeling remorseful for killing his own son, tries to bring him back to life by making him drink his blood, which seemingly fails. After this, Dracula places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard, since he never learned his real name. Many years later, Alucard awakens, now with pale white skin, white hair, and glowing orange eyes. He meets up with Dracula and his own son, Simon, and tries to finish what he started, angry that he turned him into a vampire. Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the Brotherhood, but Alucard refuses. Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont, wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life. Alucard and Simon manage to defeat Dracula and part ways as Dracula&#x27;s castle crumbles.

Alucard also appears as a supporting character in the sequel, &quot;&quot;, playing an important role in his father&#x27;s journey of redemption. He is playable in the DLC &quot;Revelations,&quot; which takes place shortly before the events of the main game. In the &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; series Alucard is voiced by Richard Madden.

====Hector====
 is the Devil Forgemaster and the main protagonist of &quot;Curse of Darkness&quot;. He has silver hair and wields a war hammer or sword. After betraying Dracula and leaving for a normal life, he regains his devil forgemaster powers to defeat Isaac and bring peace to the land. The player controls Hector in the normal play mode. 

====Isaac====
 appears in &quot;Curse of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Akumajo Dracula Pachislot&quot; as a recurring antagonist. He is Hector&#x27;s villainous rival, who stayed loyal to Dracula after Trevor defeated him a few years before the start of the game. The player will fight Isaac a few times over the course of the game.

====Julia Laforeze====
 is Isaac&#x27;s sister and a witch, who provides items for the player at a shop. Hector notes she resembles Rosaly, his deceased lover.

====Saint Germain====
 appears in &quot;Curse of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Akumajo Dracula Pachislot&quot;. 

====Angela====
Angela is a girl who appears in the &quot;Akumajo Dracula Pachislot&quot; games, aiding Ralph C. Belmont on his quest to stop Dracula, who has prematurely risen again. She can use magic, such as casting a spell that annihilates hordes of skeletons and using magic to revive Ralph.

===&quot;Kid Dracula&quot;===
Kid Dracula is a lighthearted spinoff of the Castlevania series set sometime in the distant future. In Japan, the series is called &quot;Akumajō Dracula Special: Boku Dracula-kun&quot;. Though elements from the series have been referenced throughout the main Castlevania series, the series has not been listed on any timeline published by Konami.

====Kid Dracula====
Kid Dracula is a 10,009 year old being and the lord of Castlevania. He had to retake the castle from Galamoth to return to his throne. In the Game Boy sequel, Kid Dracula defeated Galamoth a second time after the being attempted to capture the castle again. Throughout the series, Kid Dracula makes references to his &quot;father&quot;, hinting at him to be an alternative version of Alucard.

In &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, Kid Dracula&#x27;s shadow can sometimes be seen in the background of the Dracula&#x27;s Castle stage, and he can also be obtained as a collectible Spirit.

====Galamoth====
 (aka Garamoth) is the Lord of Space. He is originally from the Kid Dracula series. Sometime in the distant future, Galamoth tried to take over the Dracula&#x27;s Castle to become the new Demonlord, but was defeated by Kid Dracula (Kid Dracula Famicom/Mobile phones). He tried to retake the castle again, but was defeated a second time (Kid Dracula GB). Galamoth later appeared as an optional boss in Symphony of the Night, located in the Floating Catacombs. Galamoth appeared in Aria of Sorrow as a soul that allowed Soma Cruz to see past areas blocked by time.

He is referred to by name in &quot;Castlevania Judgment&quot; when the Time Reaper is defeated. He is implied to be the one who sent the Time Reaper back 10,000 years into the past destroy Dracula and erase his reign from the timeline.

===&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;===

====Richter Belmont====
 has starred as a protagonist in &quot;Castlevania: Rondo of Blood&quot; (and its remakes), &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot;, and &quot;Akumajō Dracula: The Medal&quot; (an arcade medallion slot game). His first appearance is the main character in &quot;&quot;. In &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot;, a direct sequel which takes place five years later, he became a brainwashed primary antagonist; however, completing the game unlocks an option to play the entire game as Richter. However, there is an alternate ending to &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; that suggests that he was the cause of Dracula&#x27;s return. He is also playable in an extra mode in &quot;&quot;.

Hero of the &quot;&quot; games and a major character in &quot;&quot;, Richter had to battle legions of Dracula&#x27;s monsters to save his love interest Annette. In &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot;, Richter mysteriously disappears upon investigating Dracula&#x27;s recently reconstructed castle. It is later revealed that he was brainwashed by Shaft, a dark priest and servant of Dracula. Players will end up facing Richter: physically defeating him will result in the game ending early, whereas freeing him from Shaft&#x27;s control will continue the game.

In his first two appearances, as well as the prologue for the third, Richter wears a headband and a blue uniform. In &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot;, only in the Saturn version following the prologue, his hair is noticeably longer and his attire appears more regal, matching Ayami Kojima&#x27;s redesign of the character (the PlayStation version reuses the &quot;Rondo of Blood&quot; sprites). He also gains a few new abilities, notably a dash, a slide attack, and a super jump that doubles as an uppercut.

In &quot;Portrait of Ruin&quot;, Jonathan Morris fights a recreation of Richter (called &quot;Whip&#x27;s Memory&quot;) in a test created by Stella and Loretta Lecarde to unlock the Vampire Killer&#x27;s full power, as he is the last known Belmont to wield the whip before Julius Belmont killed Dracula in 1999. Richter also appears in the game as one of the Five Greatest. Richter appears in the 2018 crossover fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; as a playable character alongside his ancestor Simon, to whom he has a similar set of moves, being labelled as an &quot;echo fighter&quot;. &quot;Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania&quot; features Richter Belmont as a playable character.

In Japanese, Richter is voiced by Jin Horikawa in &quot;Castlevania: Rondo of Blood&quot; and by Kiyoyuki Yanada in all subsequent appearances with the exception of the 2008 audio drama &quot;Akumajō Dracula X: Tsuioku no Yasōkyoku&quot;, where he is voiced by Shin-ichiro Miki. In English, Richter is voiced by Scott McCulloch in &quot;Castlevania: Symphony of the Night&quot;, by David Vincent in &quot;&quot; (including the &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; redub), and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, by Bérenger Dupré in &quot;Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania&quot;, and by SungWon Cho in &quot;Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania&quot;.

====Maria Renard====
 is a local village girl with the power to control the Four Symbols of Chinese mythology. She appears in the PC Engine video game &quot;Akumajō Dracula X: Rondo of Blood&quot; (and its remakes &quot;Dracula X Chronicles&quot; for PSP and &quot;Castlevania Dracula X&quot; for Super NES), as well as in &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot;, &quot;Castlevania Judgment&quot;, and &quot;Akumajō Dracula: The Medal&quot;. She is a distant blood relative of the Belmont clan (no mention of that connection is to be found in &quot;&quot;, where she is instead said to be the daughter of a local lord). In the Super NES version of &quot;&quot;, she&#x27;s also said to be the sister of Richter&#x27;s beloved Annette, a detail that&#x27;s not alluded to in the other games. She was later adopted by the Belmont family in &quot;Castlevania Judgment&quot;.

In 1792, Maria&#x27;s parents were killed, and she was captured, along with several other young women, and taken to Dracula&#x27;s castle. Richter Belmont saved Maria from Shaft, one of Dracula&#x27;s servants, who was attempting to cast a spell on her. Once Maria is rescued, she becomes playable and uses various magically enhanced animal attacks for combat. There exists an ending in which, instead of Richter doing it, Maria confronts and defeats the Count. In the introduction sequence to &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; (a retelling of the final boss battle in &quot;Rondo of Blood&quot;), if Richter&#x27;s health completely runs out, a 12-year-old Maria will appear and amplify Richter with her magic in his effort to defeat Dracula. &quot;Judgment&quot; further explains that she fought alongside Richter in defeating Dracula and has power that rivals the Belmonts. Unlike Annette, if you fail to save her in &quot;Rondo of Blood&quot;, you will not face her at the end.

Four years after the defeat of Dracula, Richter vanished. Maria immediately set out to find him. After a year of searching, in 1797, she finally found Castlevania. In the castle she learned that Richter was working in concert with the dark forces. With Maria&#x27;s help, the half-vampire Alucard was able to break Shaft&#x27;s hold on Richter and defeat Dracula. Depending on certain player actions in Symphony, the player will receive different endings. In one, Maria will admit to not being able to live without Alucard and go after him. In another, she will resign herself due to the fact that she cannot ease his torment and returns home with Richter.

Maria also appears in &quot;Judgment&quot; with a more bratty personality. She constantly trips and miscalculates her powerful magics, for comedic effect, and she acts mostly unaware of the Time Rift&#x27;s nature, for example believing that Simon and Trevor merely stole the Vampire Killer from her friend Richter. She is also seemingly obsessed with her young age and diminutive body, going so far to openly complain against Carmilla and Shanoa for their developed bodies, and claim that Sypha&#x27;s large breasts are a &quot;gift from God&quot;, lashing out to her for suggesting that her beauty may pose a liability in combat.

====Shaft====
 is a dark priest that appears as the secondary antagonist of &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. In 1792, Shaft aids Dracula in his plans to kidnap several young women. He is defeated by Richter after conjuring several monsters in an attempt to defeat him. Later in the game, Shaft&#x27;s ghost makes a final attempt to stop the hero.

In 1797, Dracula&#x27;s monsters kidnap Richter and brainwash him. Shaft is instrumental in using his evil powers to control Richter, turning him against anyone who seeks to defy Dracula. Maria guesses that he is under their influence and helps Alucard to see past Shaft&#x27;s deception. Alucard is able to save Richter instead of killing him, and goes on to defeat Shaft, although not before Shaft successfully revives Dracula just before being stopped for good.

====Annette====
 is Richter&#x27;s fiancée. In &quot;&quot;—and also &quot;Dracula X&quot; for the SNES and &quot;Dracula X Chronicles&quot; for the PSP—she was kidnapped by Dracula&#x27;s minions, along with Maria, Iris, and Terra. Failing to save her will result in having to face her in &quot;Dracula X&quot; and &quot;The Dracula X Chronicles&quot;, where she is turned into a vampire who takes Death&#x27;s and Shaft&#x27;s ghost&#x27;s respective places as the boss. In the English localization of the SNES game &quot;&quot;, her name was spelled as &quot;Anett&quot; during the game&#x27;s intro storyline. Depicted as a purple haired young girl in her original &quot;Rondo of Blood&quot; design, she was redesigned as a blonde in the same way as Maria, and wearing more aristocratic attire in &quot;Dracula X&quot; for the SNES and in &quot;Chronicles&quot; for the PSP.

====Iris and Tera====
 is the head nun of Richter&#x27;s village, and is the doctor&#x27;s daughter. They were kidnapped by Dracula&#x27;s minions to taunt Richter, along with Annette and Maria. Tera sees Richter as a warrior of God and Maria as angel sent by Heaven, thanking them both for saving her. Iris, being a doctor&#x27;s daughter, helps heal the wounds of the duo when they rescue her as a show of thanks.

====Lisa====
 is Alucard&#x27;s mother and Dracula&#x27;s second wife, seeing past her husband&#x27;s personality to see the lonely man he truly is. She was executed on the charge of witchcraft after healing villagers with penicillin, spurring Dracula&#x27;s genocidal vendetta against humanity. Alucard witnessed her death and promised her not to hate humans and tells Dracula she will love him for eternity, which Alucard relays in &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot;.

====Golem====
Golem is a recurring character found throughout the Castlevania series. His first appearance was in Rondo of Blood. Golem was originally created by Carmilla to be a mindless guard of ancient ruins. When he was pulled into the time rift by Aeon, the rift gives him self-awareness. He fought the champions to become human, and discover the meaning of his existence. He lost his self-awareness, after being returned to his own time frame (Castlevania Judgment). IGA says he is based on Golem-type monsters, like the Franken, from Castlevania I.

====Master Librarian====
The is the loyal servant of Dracula in charge of the knowledge of the library. He will sell items to young master Alucard for a price.

====Succubus====
In &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot;, a assumed the guise of Lisa at the time of her death to tempt Alucard into turning on the humans, only to be killed upon him learning her true identity. Succubus, or a member of her race, appears in &quot;Lament of Innocence&quot; and &quot;Akumajo Dracula Pachislot&quot;. 

====Olrox====
In &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot;, is a vampire with his own designated section of the castle. During his battle with Alucard, he transforms into a large gecko-like monster but is defeated. Olrox later appears as the central antagonist of the 2008 light novel &quot;Akumajō Dracula: Kabuchi no Tsuisoukyoku&quot;, where he assumes leadership of the remnants of Graham Jones&#x27; doomsday cult.

Olrox is a pastiche of Count Orlok, the central antagonist of the 1922 horror film &quot;Nosferatu&quot;.

===&quot;Legends&quot;===
Castlevania Legends and Sonia Belmont were rendered non-canonical when the game was redacted from IGA&#x27;s series timeline due to inconsistencies.

====Sonia Belmont====
 is the protagonist of &quot;Castlevania Legends&quot;. At the age of seventeen she lived in a remote part of Transylvania. She was born with special abilities that allowed her to sense the presence of physical and spiritual beings, and was taught how to use a whip by her grandfather. It is not explicitly stated whether the whip she uses is the Vampire Killer or not.

Within the castle, she encounters Alucard, the half-vampire son of Dracula. She had met him some time before and it can be inferred from their dialogue that the two had formed a romantic relationship. Alucard was intent on dissuading Sonia from her goal, planning to stop his father alone. When Sonia would not yield, he challenged her to a battle to test her abilities. After she defeated him, Alucard was confident that Sonia could overcome Dracula and he went into a self-imposed sleep. Sonia defeated Dracula, and spared Europe from his evil influence for a time. Sometime after Dracula&#x27;s defeat, Sonia bore a child who &quot;would carry on the fate and tragedy of the Belmont family, and the bloodline of dark ways.&quot; The child would grow up to fight Dracula again and become a hero.

Sonia was one of the confirmed leads in the Dreamcast game &quot;Castlevania: Resurrection&quot;, up until that game&#x27;s cancellation.

Sonia appears as a playable character for the &quot;Ode to Castlevania&quot; DLC in Vampire Survivors.

===&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;===

====John Morris====
John Morris, known as in Japan, made an appearance in a single &quot;Castlevania&quot; game, &quot;&quot;. He is a descendant of the Belmont family, and wields the Vampire Killer whip, much like his ancestors. John died some time after the events of &quot;Bloodlines&quot;, as it was revealed his wounds wouldn&#x27;t heal. This was caused by his using the Vampire Killer whip, which would sap the strength of someone that was not a full-blooded descendant of the Belmont lineage, but by the time John learned this, it was too late.

&quot;Bloodlines&quot; is deeply intertwined with the storyline of Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula. As such, the father of John Morris is Quincy Morris, a character from the novel. It is only known that the Morrises are somehow of Belmont lineage. In the novel, Quincy stabs Dracula at the cost of his life, while Harker cuts off Dracula&#x27;s head. However, that fact he managed to unknowingly deal a crippling blow to Dracula may have been the foundation for his part in the &quot;Castlevania&quot; version of these events. Though he does not appear in any &quot;Castlevania&quot; game, Quincy is a playable character in &quot;Vampire Survivors&quot; as part of the &quot;Ode to Castlevania&quot; DLC.

====Eric Lecarde====
 appears in Bloodlines, Portrait of Ruin, and Judgment. Born on May 3, 1892, in Segovia, Spain, he uses the Alucard Spear (mistranslated as &quot;Alcarde Spear&quot; in &quot;Bloodlines&quot;). The spear was created by Alucard to complement the power of the Vampire Killer, and fight alongside the Morris line. When Elizabeth Bartley attempted to revive Dracula, Eric volunteered to fight alongside his friend John Morris in the hunt. However, he had not told John the real reason behind his appetite for vengeance: the Countess turned the love of his life, Gwendolyn, into a vampire.

Years later, Eric set out towards Dracula&#x27;s Castle to investigate its reappearance, but was slain by the vampire Brauner. Unbeknownst to him, Eric&#x27;s daughters had followed him into the castle and bore witness to his death, but both were then bitten by Brauner and turned into vampires. Unable to cross into the afterlife, Eric&#x27;s ghost remained in the castle and was later met by Jonathan Morris and Charlotte Aulin. Initially calling himself &quot;Wind&quot;, Eric tested the pair&#x27;s abilities with various side-quests. After being confronted by Jonathan following a skirmish with Stella, in which a locket holding a photo of him and his daughters was recovered, Eric disclosed his true identity and the full story behind himself, his daughters, and Jonathan&#x27;s father. Once his daughters are rescued and Brauner and Dracula are both destroyed, Eric appears before his friends and family and gives them one last heartfelt moment together before crossing over into the afterlife.

In &quot;Judgment&quot;, Eric believed that the spear&#x27;s potential was greater than the whip, and sought to prove that. While training he found himself in a time rift, having been brought there by Aeon. Eric believed the rift would give him a chance to prove the spear&#x27;s potential against the Vampire Killer. After the defeat of Galamoth he was returned to his own time (Judgment).

====Elizabeth Bartley====
According to the game&#x27;s story, is Dracula&#x27;s niece, raised back from the dead by her servant . She triggered the start of World War I by assassinating the Crown Prince of Austria, then gathered the souls of those who died in the war to revive Dracula. In the final stage, she initially fights John and Eric in the form of a Medusa, then attacks with elemental spells before ultimately being killed.

She is based on the actual Countess Erzsébet Báthory, and was likely intended to &quot;be&quot; her, as Báthory&#x27;s first name is commonly anglicized to &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, and the name &quot;Bartley&quot; likely being a mistranslation.

====Drolta Tzuentes====

Drolta Tzuentes is a subservient witch of Elizabeth Bartley who resurrects her master. (The American &quot;Castlevania: Bloodlines&quot; instruction book gives contradictory information, saying that she is an &quot;amateur witch&quot; who &quot;casts a spell which inadvertently brings Elizabeth Bartley back to life&quot;.) Drolta then accompanies Elizabeth in their plot to resurrect Count Dracula.

Drolta Tzuentes is based on Dorottya Szentes (Dorottya Semtész) who is one of the servants of Erzsébet Báthory (the historical version of Elizabeth Bartley) who, along with 2 others, are said to have been tried, convicted, and executed as accomplices to the crimes done by the noblewoman.

====Jonathan Morris====
 is a member of the Morris family of vampire hunters and appears in &quot;&quot;. The wielder of the Vampire Killer in 1944, Jonathan received basic training from his father John Morris as a child. He tends to be a reckless youth, a trait which makes his childhood friend Charlotte Aulin worry about his well-being much of the time. He can, however, be very observant. After his father died, Jonathan grew to resent him, though neither he nor Charlotte knew that the soul-sapping effects of a non-Belmont using the Vampire Killer in battle resulted in his death.

After learning the truth about his father and the Vampire Killer from Eric, Jonathan gained a newfound respect for his father. Jonathan may then choose whether or not to battle the whip&#x27;s memory of Richter Belmont, who was the last Belmont to wield the whip. and successfully unleash the full power of the Vampire Killer. He knows full well that he may perish from using it, though it is up to the player to decide whether to engage this optional encounter, and the canonical choice is unknown. Regardless, Jonathan and Charlotte traveled to the top of Dracula&#x27;s Castle, and battled the combined forces of Count Dracula and Death, which had not previously occurred before according to Charlotte. When Dracula was vanquished, his castle was destroyed and Jonathan and the others escaped unscathed.

====Charlotte Aulin====
 is a magic user said to be descended from the Belnades clan. She shows strong potential as a sorceress. Along with Jonathan, she ventures into the castle to destroy Dracula. She is a smart girl who relies on enchanted books for information, to cast spells, and to summon weapons for close-range attacks. She also tends to be a nosy and talkative person, which is how she found out about Jonathan and the Vampire Killer, something which, according to Jonathan, she was supposed to keep secret. Charlotte is concerned about Jonathan&#x27;s ability to wield the whip and assists him with the best she can, but she hates getting treated as (or even being called) a child. She tends to take things rationally and logically, which makes her seem unemotional but she is in fact a caring and compassionate young woman.

====Brauner====
 is a famous painter who forsook his humanity after losing his daughters during World War I. Now a vampire, he screams for vengeance upon humanity for their deaths.

When Dracula&#x27;s Castle first appeared, Brauner used his special paintings to keep Dracula sealed so that he could keep the dark lord&#x27;s power all for himself. Eric Lecarde set off to investigate the castle, but was ambushed by Brauner and slain. At the same time, Eric&#x27;s daughters Stella and Loretta arrived to bear witness to their father&#x27;s death, and Brauner bit both girls so as to turn them into his new vampiric &quot;daughters&quot;.

When Jonathan and Charlotte finally confront Brauner, he flies into a rage over having lost his &quot;daughters&quot; again and attacks the pair. As he is defeated, Brauner explains the reasons for his actions, but is then slain by Death in order to revive Dracula.

====Stella and Loretta====
 and are the daughters of Eric Lecarde, the older sister Stella being a master swordswoman with powerful wind-based attacks while Loretta wields powerful ice spells while serving as Stella&#x27;s support. The vampire Brauner believe the two of them to be the reincarnations of his deceased daughters, having turned them to vampires and subjected them to a spell that causes their past lives to take control of them.

Brauner&#x27;s &quot;daughters&quot; initially prevent Jonathan and Charlotte from investigating the castle. After a short fight with Stella, the two learn of the sisters&#x27; true identities when they find a locket containing a picture with both girls and Eric Lecarde, prompting Eric&#x27;s ghost to reveal what happened to his daughters. The four of them later confront each other in the highest areas of the castle. While it is possible to kill the sisters (triggering a bad ending), Jonathan and Charlotte must use the &quot;Sanctuary&quot; spell to restore Stella and Loretta to their true selves. Their minds and humanity restored, the sisters open a door that leads to Brauner&#x27;s studio and also offer Jonathan a way to unlock the true power of the Vampire Killer.

Upon defeating Dracula, Jonathan, Charlotte, Stella, and Loretta escape the castle, where Eric appears before them and tells his daughters to not burden themselves over their actions and move. Eric passes to the other side, leaving Stella and Loretta in tears, but they soon recover and thank Jonathan and Charlotte.

Stella and Loretta are playable in &quot;Sisters Mode&quot;, which takes place before the main game and chronicles their search for their missing father. Unlike Jonathan and Charlotte, the player use the stylus to attack and the D-Pad to move them around, as they can also fly. As Stella, the player attacks enemies by slicing enemies with the stylus, and as Loretta, the player points at enemies to shoot a beam of ice.

====Vincent Dorin====
 is a priest that serves as the game merchant. Jonathan and Charlotte meet him in front of the castle and then near the entrance. Vincent is a rather greedy person, even if he explains that it is for the church. He also gets bitten during the game and begs the two heroes to cure him (the player can choose to cure him or not, and while it affects the ending, it is not something noticeable). Even when cured, he isn&#x27;t as much in debt concerning his merchandise.

His name was reused for an abbot in the reboot, &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot;. He went insane by isolating himself and protecting a priceless artifact, while his townspeople were being slaughtered by supernatural creatures.

===&quot;Castlevania&quot; (1999) and &quot;&quot;===
IGA claimed in 2006 that &quot;Castlevania&quot; and &quot;Legacy of Darkness&quot; for the Nintendo 64 were considered side projects to his timeline. However, the games were later listed on the 20th Anniversary Timeline, without any description. IGA later clarified that he looks at the titles as &quot;...a Castlevania &quot;gaiden&quot; (subseries)&quot; and complemented them by stating &quot;...they both have a really unique take on the Castlevania world.&quot; Iga later included Cornell in Castlevania Judgment (Nov 2008) (drawn from his era of the timeline by magical forces). The game and manual makes references to Legacy of Darkness story. Events and characters related to the game such as Ada are mentioned during Cornell&#x27;s mission and by some of the characters who encounter Cornell during their missions (such as Death &amp; Camilla). Legacy of Darkness is said to be Cornell&#x27;s previous appearance in the manual.

====Reinhardt Schneider====
Though the Belmont surname may no longer follow , the blood inside of his veins remains the same, and his destiny is no different. He is the son of Michael Gelhart Schneider. Villagers have been found mutilated and drained of blood near Dracula&#x27;s castle, and Reinhardt has to stop it. He carries the typical Vampire Killer whip but can also wield a shortsword for close-range combat for which the whip may prove unsuitable; although the surname &quot;Schneider&quot; usually carries the same connotation as does the English surname &quot;Tailor,&quot; its literal translation from German is the more general &quot;one who cuts.&quot;

He is voiced by Andrew Hanikson.

====Carrie Fernández====
 is a magic-wielding girl descended from the Belnades clan. She was estranged from the populace of Wallachia for her affinity with magic, her mother dying to protect her from an angry mob. She turned her back on others, but when she learned that Dracula had once again risen, she took it upon herself to use her powers to stop him. She is Camilla Fernández&#x27;s cousin, who is also captured by a vampire and turned into one.

She is voiced by Bianca Allen.

====Actrise====
 is a Dracula&#x27;s witch servant, she sacrificed her own child to become immortal. She plays an antagonist role in Carrie&#x27;s quest, offering her a chance to join Dracula, in which Carrie refuses. In the Castle Center, Actrise sics a Fernández warrior, who became a vampire, on Carrie in an attempt to stop her from reaching Dracula. After Carrie defeats her cousin, she and Actrise do battle on top of one of the castle towers, in which Actrise is overwhelmed and killed by Carrie. She also appears in Cornell&#x27;s quest and taunts him, and is revealed to be responsible for turning Henry&#x27;s father into a vampire.

====Rosa====
 is a woman who was recently turned into a vampire. She meets Reinhardt and Carrie in the Villa, watering flowers with blood. She plays a major role in Reinhardt&#x27;s quest. She is seen next attempting to kill herself, walking into sunlight. Reinhardt stops her. She is then encountered with Death in the Castle Center in which she and Reinhardt do battle. She is defeated by him but is spared before Death takes her away. When Death ambushes Reinhardt, Rosa sacrifices herself by throwing herself into the path of Death&#x27;s scythes. Rosa is comforted by Reinhardt as she dies, and then Death is defeated by a vengeful Reinhardt. In the end, after Dracula&#x27;s defeat, Rosa is seen restored into human form and she and Reinhardt look upon Dracula&#x27;s sunken castle.

====Gilles de Rais====
 is one of Dracula&#x27;s servants. He used Cornell&#x27;s power to reincarnate his master in the body of Malus. He later disguises himself as Dracula in preparation for his lord&#x27;s eventual resurrection and kidnapped children to offer them as sacrifice and thus resurrect his master. He is later defeated by Reinhardt and Carrie in Dracula&#x27;s throne room, where it is revealed he was an imposter.
He is probably based on the historical person of the same name.

====Renon====
 is a demonic salesman who appears intermittently throughout the game. He claims that &quot;one needs gold even in Hell these days&quot;, and will gladly sell the player various power-ups such as spells and potions. Renon can be summoned by picking up a contract scroll that appears in various levels. The scroll then turns into an open briefcase. If the player spends more than 30,000 gold pieces before encountering Dracula, Renon transforms into his demon form and attempts to claim your soul for Hell.

====Charles Vincent====
 is a vampire hunter. His mannerisms seem to indicate that he is very intelligent, but lacks real experience with vampires or other evils. Charles plays a key role in the game.

If the player takes less time in reaching the Castle Keep and defeats Dracula for the first time, he changes back into Malus, but Charles douses him with holy water, before Dracula warps the player to an alternate dimension for the final battle. After Dracula&#x27;s defeat, Charles&#x27; fate is unknown.

However, if the player takes more time in reaching the Castle Keep, Charles will arrive before them. He will fail in his attempt to subdue Dracula, and will be turned into a vampire instead. The player will be forced to fight and kill Charles. If this happens, then the heroes will not see through Dracula&#x27;s illusions and ultimately fail in their quest.

====Cornell====
, also known as &quot;Blue Crescent Moon&quot;, is a werewolf seen in both &quot;&quot; and &quot;Castlevania Judgment&quot;. He is a member of a warrior clan cursed to turn into beastmen. He is the only member of his clan who had the ability to control his change. He was the only one of his brethren who refused to join the forces of Dracula. He honed his skills in the hopes of finding a cure for his clan and to protect his sister Ada. One day while out training he found himself unable to control his powers and was stuck in beast form (&quot;Castlevania Judgement&quot;). He encountered Aeon, a time traveler, who told him he had entered a time rift. Aeon challenged him, and told him the time rift would let him learn more about the nature of the curse. After encountering several champions from different eras, he learns from Camilla and Death that they still need him, and is told that there is a possibility of a cure for him (though he doesn&#x27;t trust them). After the defeat of the Time Reaper, Cornell was returned to his own era, 1844. He returned to find his village in flame, and his sister Ada kidnapped. He then journeyed after the kidnappers to save his sister. He discovered that Dracula&#x27;s castle had risen again, and that his fellow man-beast Ortega had kidnapped his sister. During his battles he saves the young Henry Oldrey, and later defeats Ortega. He learned from Ortega, that Death, Gilles De Rais, and Actrise had plotted the kidnapping of Ada to empower a newly raised Dracula. Dracula later reveals to the audience that his sister is not a blood relative. Cornell fights Dracula to save her causing Dracula to be pulled into a vortex of energy. Dracula traps Cornell with his last power and tries to take Ada with him. The beast within Cornell freed itself from his body and saves Ada, but is captured and pulled into the vortex by Dracula. Cornell had become fully human, and was able to live the rest of a normal life with Ada (Legacy of Darkness).

According to IGA, &quot;I believe many people did not expect to see Cornell. I really wanted to include a beast man type character, so I picked him.&quot;

He is voiced by John Nuzzo (Legacy of Darkness).

A new version of Cornell appears in Lords of Shadow, voiced by Richard Ridings. He is the Dark Lord of the Lycans and the first Lords of Shadow that Gabriel encounters.

====Ortega====
 grew up in the same village as Cornell, a fellow man-beast, being a friend of his, but also a rival. The rivalry caused Ortega an increasing amount of frustration, as he was constantly being outdone on every occasion, and he started searching for a way to gain the kind of powers that would make him stronger than even Cornell.

This search led him on the path of darkness, as the only one able to grant him the request proved to be Dracula. As a condition for gaining the new powers, Dracula demanded of Ortega to aid his demons on their mission to kidnap Cornell&#x27;s sister Ada and destroy the village. He was also to stop Cornell from rescuing Ada. Ortega accepted these conditions, and thus sealed his pact with the devil, gaining amazing power, but losing his humanity.

Ortega eventually fights Cornell as a Chimera on top one of the castle towers, but is defeated by him. Ortega accepts his defeat, but with his powers becoming out of control, he leaps off the castle tower to his death.

====Henry Oldrey====
 is the son of Mary and J. A. Oldrey. He was rescued by Cornell. Years later he became a knight of the church. He helped rescue the children kidnapped by Gilles de Rais.

He is voiced by Takashi Bratcher.
IGA claimed in 2006 that &quot;Circle of the Moon&quot; was considered a side project to his timeline. Elements from the game were mentioned in the English Xtreme Desktop Timeline, but the game itself was not included on the timeline. The English language timeline, distributed with preordered versions of Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin in North America by Konami of America, includes the date for Circle of the Moon though the events are not described. Circle of the Moon continues to occupy an ambiguous place in the timelines published by Konami of Japan, Konami of America, and various gaming publications.

====Nathan Graves====
 is the protagonist of Circle of the Moon. Nathan&#x27;s parents were friends of his teacher, Morris Baldwin. Ten years before the events in &quot;Circle of the Moon&quot;, Nathan&#x27;s parents banished Dracula, at the cost of their lives. Morris managed to survive, and took Nathan as a student. Nathan was trained alongside Morris&#x27; son, Hugh, to become a vampire killer. Nathan has been chosen by Morris to be the successor of the Hunter Whip. He encounters many of Carmilla&#x27;s cohorts, such as , before saving his master from lord Dracula.

====Hugh Baldwin====
 is the son of Morris and Nathan&#x27;s rival. Hugh envies Nathan for being chosen by his father for possession of the Hunter Whip. However, Nathan does not reciprocate his hate, and often tries to reason with him. Dracula takes advantage of Hugh&#x27;s discontent and entices him to kill Nathan near the end of the game. After being defeated, Hugh comes back to his senses and feels a new-found respect for Nathan and his father&#x27;s decision to give Nathan the Hunter Whip.

====Morris Baldwin====
 is Hugh&#x27;s father and a veteran Vampire Hunter. He and Nathan&#x27;s parents sealed Count Dracula in 1820, ten years before the events in &quot;Circle of the Moon&quot;. Morris chose Nathan as his successor instead of his son, Hugh, because he suspected that his son only wanted the whip for the glory of inheriting the family heirloom. Though the game was not listed, Morris Baldwin was mentioned in the English Xtreme Desktop Timeline.

====Juste Belmont====
 is the primary protagonist in &quot;.&quot; In 1748, he entered Dracula&#x27;s castle with his ally Maxim Kischine to locate the remaining relics of Dracula and save his friend Lydie Erlanger. He wears his bracelet, as does Maxim his own, and carries the &quot;Vampire Killer&quot; whip. Juste is an exceptional spell caster due to the Belnades blood running through his veins, and his abilities are considered prodigious among his fellow family members. Juste received the Vampire Killer when he was only 16.

Juste appears in &quot;Portrait of Ruin&quot; when using the &quot;Greatest Five&quot; attack.

Richter Belmont is the grandson of Juste Belmont.

====Maxim Kischine====
 is a childhood friend and rival of Juste, and the wielder of the Stellar Sword. He is responsible for unwillingly triggering the events that take place in 1748, during &quot;Harmony of Dissonance&quot;, by wishing to relieve Juste of his fate and become more powerful than he is. Inspired by the tale of Simon Belmont, Maxim gathered the cursed remains of Count Dracula so he could destroy them, and in doing so created an evil Maxim in his soul that hungered for power and destruction like Dracula did.

In the best ending, Juste helps Maxim overcome his dark influence by wearing their bracelets as a reminder of their friendship. Though not at full power, the evil Maxim takes Dracula&#x27;s remains (gathered by Juste during his quest) and turns into a ghostly incarnation of Dracula (Dracula Wraith), then into a giant creature made of the body parts before finally being slain. Maxim is restored to normal afterwards.

Maxim is playable in a secret gameplay mode of &quot;Harmony of Dissonance&quot;. His Stellar Sword is also an obtainable weapon in &quot;Portrait of Ruin&quot;. When wielding it, Jonathan can summon multiple illusions of himself to attack all on-screen enemies, similar to Maxim&#x27;s own abilities.

====Lydie Erlanger====
 is a childhood friend to both Juste and Maxim, and a person whom they deeply care about. Her presence is comforting to the young men, who underwent strict physical training. She was first kidnapped by Maxim&#x27;s dark side and held within Dracula&#x27;s castle, then kidnapped by Death so that the evil Maxim could take her blood and be properly resurrected as Dracula. After the Dracula Wraith is slain, her bite wounds are healed.

====Merchant====
A shopkeeper character in &quot;Harmony of Dissonance&quot;. All that is known about him is that he stumbled into Dracula&#x27;s castle during his travels and, being unable to escape, set up shops through the castle. Many of his shops can only be accessed when Juste meets certain status conditions, such as having an even number of Hearts or when possessing a rare item.

===&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;===

====Soma Cruz====
Soma Cruz, known in the original Japanese version as , is the protagonist and primary playable character of both &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot;, and also is one of starting characters in . His Japanese voice actor in all games is Hikaru Midorikawa. Soma&#x27;s presence in two &quot;Castlevania&quot; games, unusual for most &quot;Castlevania&quot; characters, was made by producer Koji Igarashi, who noted that one of the reasons he made &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot; was to utilize Soma Cruz in another game.

In both games&#x27; international versions, he is depicted as a transfer student from Romania studying in Japan (or simply as a Japanese high school student, in the Japanese version), living a peaceful life with his childhood friend Mina Hakuba. During the events of &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot;, Soma awakens in Dracula&#x27;s castle, where he learns of his &quot;power of dominance,&quot; which enables him to absorb the souls of monsters and use their powers. He ventures through Dracula&#x27;s castle, learning that Dracula had been destroyed years prior, and his reincarnation was coming to the castle that day. Defeating Graham Jones, who had harbored the notion that he was Dracula&#x27;s reincarnation, causes Soma to realize that he is Dracula&#x27;s reincarnation. With the aid of his friends, he is able to escape his fate by defeating the manifestation of the castle&#x27;s chaos. In &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot;, Soma returns into battle to combat Celia Fortner&#x27;s cult, which seeks to kill Soma and revive the dark lord. Soma manages to defeat them, and realizes at the end of the game that he is free to determine his own destiny rather than inevitably become another Dracula.

====Mina Hakuba====
 is the childhood friend of Soma Cruz and the only daughter of the priest of the Hakuba shrine. Her attire in &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot; reflects this, as her attire is that of a traditional miko. She is transported into Dracula&#x27;s castle alongside Soma at the start of &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot; and remains outside the castle for the duration of the game, offering Soma advice that she acquires from Arikado. When Soma realizes that he is Dracula&#x27;s reincarnation, Mina is able to accept him for who he is, and offers him moral support. After Soma escapes his fate, Mina returns to the Hakuba shrine with him. In &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot;, Mina is briefly present in the game, present solely in the opening and ending sequences. In the beginning of &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot;, she and Soma are nearly killed by Celia Fortner, who is repelled by Soma and Arikado. Mina spends the remainder protected by Arikado&#x27;s subordinates, but sends a letter and talisman to Soma during the course of the game. A doppelgänger of her also appears in a later stage in the game. When confronted by Soma, Celia fakes killing the doppelgänger in front of him, prompting a furious Soma to begin to transform into the dark lord. The talisman she sends him however, delays the transformation enough for Genya to reveal the truth to Soma, halting his transformation. At the end of the game, she and Soma share a tender moment, to the amusement of their onlooking friends. Given the striking similarity, Mina&#x27;s name seems to have been inspired by Mina Harker from the original Bram Stoker works.

====Julius Belmont====
 is the latest member of the Belmont clan featured in the &quot;Castlevania&quot; series.
Members of the Belmont clan have been the protagonists of most &quot;Castlevania&quot; games, and Julius&#x27; role as a supporting character is unusual for the series. His Japanese voice actor in both games is Tetsu Inada. In both &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot;, Julius is playable through &quot;Julius Mode.&quot; While the &quot;Julius Mode&quot; in &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot; solely features Julius, Yoko Belnades and Alucard can be unlocked as playable characters in the &quot;Julius Mode&quot; in &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot;. In Harmony of Despair he becomes a DLC character.

Prior to the event taking place in Aria of Sorrow, Julius is the last and only Belmont to permanently defeat Dracula in 1999 thus ending his rebirth cycle by sealing his source of power (Dracula&#x27;s Castle) inside a solar eclipse. However Julius somehow became amnesiac and wandered the land until he arrived at Dracula&#x27;s castle as the amnesiac &quot;J,&quot; having forgotten his identity after defeating Dracula prior to the start of the game. He encounters Soma Cruz, and Soma&#x27;s dark power awakens Julius&#x27; memories. Julius later confronts Soma after realizing that Soma is Dracula&#x27;s reincarnation, and battles him. Julius, unwilling to pit his full power against Soma, is defeated. After Soma escapes his fate of becoming another dark lord, Julius sends his thanks. After the events in &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot;, Julius works for the Roman Catholic Church as a paranormal investigator alongside Yoko Belnades. In &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot;, he travels to the base housing Celia Fortner&#x27;s cult with Yoko. Julius later battles Dario Bossi, one of the &quot;dark lord&#x27;s candidates&quot; and Celia&#x27;s henchman, and is defeated. After Celia and Dmitrii Blinov, the last candidate, flee into the depths of the castle, Julius uses all his power to shatter the barrier guarding their flight. He is greatly weakened as a result, and does not participate in the final battle; although he appears during the final cutscene of the game.

====Genya Arikado====

 is a member of a Japanese government organization related to national security. In truth, he is Alucard, the son of Dracula, best known as the protagonist in Konami&#x27;s highly acclaimed &quot;&quot;. During the events in &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot;, he comes to Dracula&#x27;s castle to ensure that a dark lord is not created. He instructs Soma Cruz to seek the throne room in Dracula&#x27;s castle, hoping that Soma will absorb Dracula&#x27;s powers. The gambit succeeds, and Soma nearly becomes the dark lord. However, Arikado reveals that if Soma destroys the flow of chaos into the castle, he will be able to escape his fate. After Soma succeeds, Arikado congratulates him.

In &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot;, Arikado battles Celia Fortner&#x27;s cult, which wishes to revive the dark lord. Arikado saves Soma from certain death after Celia attempts to kill him personally, and instructs Soma not to pursue her. Soma ignores his directive, and travels to the cult&#x27;s base. Arikado confronts him, and gives him a letter and talisman from Mina. Arikado later appears to stop Celia from using a doppelgänger to force Soma to become the dark lord, but is forced to let her leave after a revived Dmitrii Blinov threatens Soma&#x27;s life. Arikado travels into the castle&#x27;s basement, and attempts to stop Dmitrii. Dmitrii uses Celia as a sacrifice to seal Arikado&#x27;s powers, leaving Soma to battle him. After Soma is victorious, Arikado reveals that he is not predestined to become the dark lord, and notes that one will emerge if necessary. Arikado becomes playable as Alucard if the player unlocks &quot;Julius Mode&quot;.

====Yoko Belnades====
 is a witch in the service of the Church. She is a member of the Belnades clan, whose members are adept at magic, a trait they inherited from the clan&#x27;s progenitor, Sypha Belnades. In both games, she is voiced by: Hiroko Takahashi. Yoko comes to Dracula&#x27;s castle during the events of &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot; to stop Graham Jones, whom she believes will inherit Dracula&#x27;s powers. She solicits the aid of Soma Cruz, but is stabbed by Graham when he confronts her. She is saved by Arikado, and later thanks Soma for saving her, expressing her shock that he was Dracula&#x27;s reincarnation.

Yoko returns in &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot; as an associate of Julius Belmont. However, Julius quickly abandons her to search the castle. Yoko teaches Soma the use of a Magic Seal, and offers to increase the power of his weapons by binding the souls under his dominance to them. Although Hammer is infatuated with her, she appears to be either oblivious or uncaring of his affections. She appears during the final cutscene at the end of the game. Yoko is playable in the game&#x27;s &quot;Julius Mode.&quot; and in Harmony of Despair as a DLC character.

====Hammer====
 is a member of the United States military that comes to the Hakuba shrine on orders from his superiors. He quickly abandons his mission when he is teleported into Dracula&#x27;s castle, and on meeting Soma Cruz, becomes his vendor, serving as the game&#x27;s in-game shop. During this time, he falls in love with Yoko Belnades, who does not reciprocate his affection. After Soma defeats the manifestation of chaos in the castle, he expresses his thanks to Soma, and says that he will quit the military to pursue his ambition of becoming a salesman.

After leaving the military, Hammer starts his work as an independent merchant, and acts as an information broker through his &quot;shady business contacts.&quot; It is through this information that Soma discovers the location of Celia Fortner&#x27;s base in &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot;. Hammer arrives, and promises to be Soma&#x27;s vendor again. He stations his shop directly opposite Yoko&#x27;s, and constantly hounds Soma over his infatuation with Yoko over the course of the game. He appears with the other characters at the end of the game during the final cutscene.

====Graham Jones====
 is the primary antagonist of &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot;. He was born on the day of Dracula&#x27;s death, giving him supernatural powers. He founded a religious sect preaching apocalyptic prophecies, and acted as its chief missionary. Graham arrives at Dracula&#x27;s castle in &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot;, believing that he will receive Dracula&#x27;s powers due to being Dracula&#x27;s reincarnation. He is forced to contend with Yoko Belnades and Julius Belmont, who have arrived at the castle to prevent Dracula&#x27;s powers from falling into the wrong hands. Graham corners Yoko and stabs her, and begins to increase his powers by absorbing the castle&#x27;s energy. He faces Soma in battle, partially mimicking Dracula&#x27;s battle style and then transforming into a demonic creature. Soma manifests Dracula&#x27;s powers, and is able to defeat Graham. His death forces Soma to absorb the energy Graham had been collecting, and realizes that he himself is Dracula&#x27;s incarnation.

====Celia Fortner====
 is one of the antagonists of &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot;. She is the head of a cult seeking to revive the dark lord. Although she claims that she wishes to revive the dark lord to make God a completely good being, she desires a dark lord to prevent the loss of her magical powers. She recruits Dmitrii Blinov and Dario Bossi, the &quot;dark lord&#x27;s candidates,&quot; whom can become the new dark lord by destroying Dracula&#x27;s soul. To do this, she attempts to kill Soma Cruz. Her initial attempts are foiled by Genya Arikado, and her candidates are defeated by Soma. In a final effort, she uses a dopplegänger posing as Mina Hakuba, Soma&#x27;s childhood friend, and &quot;kills&quot; it to induce Soma to become the dark lord himself. Although this fails, Dmitrii, whose soul Soma had absorbed, escapes into the dopplegänger. She aids him in increasing his powers, but Dmitrii uses her as a sacrifice to seal Arikado&#x27;s powers.

====Dmitrii Blinov====
 is one of the antagonists of &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot;. He is one of the &quot;dark lord&#x27;s candidates,&quot; or those born on the same day that Dracula died, bestowing upon him the power to duplicate the magical powers of others He joins Celia Fortner&#x27;s cult, seeking to find the purpose behind his powers by becoming the new dark lord although he espouses no loyalty to Celia. He is defeated by Soma, who inadvertently absorbs Dmitrii&#x27;s soul. Dmitrii uses this opportunity to copy Soma&#x27;s &quot;power of dominance,&quot; or his ability to use the abilities of the monsters he defeats. Dmitrii manages to escape Soma&#x27;s body after Celia&#x27;s attempt to turn Soma into the dark lord fails. He leaves with Celia, who summons monsters to increase his power. He then sacrifices Celia to remove the threat of Genya Arikado. Before he begins to battle Soma, Soma&#x27;s power of dominance overwhelms his soul, and he dies when the monsters under his control escape his body.

====Dario Bossi====
 is one of the antagonists of &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot;. Similar to Dmitrii Blinov, Dario is one of the &quot;dark lord&#x27;s candidates,&quot; born on the day of Dracula&#x27;s demise. This affords him supernatural powers, specifically pyrokinesis. This correlates with his personality, as he is quick to anger, and acts on his instincts. He is a wanted criminal, responsible for countless incidents of &quot;inexplicable&quot; arson. He joins Celia Fortner&#x27;s cult, seeking to become the new dark lord by killing Soma Cruz. Soma defeats him in combat, and he is saved by Celia&#x27;s intervention. Celia then binds a powerful fire demon named Aguni to his soul, which increases his powers. Dario confronts Julius Belmont and defeats him, as Julius cannot prevent Dario from regenerating all damage. He fights Soma once more, but Soma strips him of his powers by defeating Aguni, breaking the demon&#x27;s bond to his soul.

====Leon Belmont====
 was a baron in 11th-century Europe up to the events of &quot;&quot;. He lost both parents at a very young age, and was knighted at the age of 16. When his love interest Sara Trantoul is kidnapped by the vampire Walter Bernhard he enters the castle grounds unarmed, but is given a whip that is blessed with the power of alchemy by the old man Rinaldo Gandolfi, who lives on the grounds. Rinaldo also enchants Leon&#x27;s left gauntlet with the power to absorb magical attacks. Using the whip and his magic gauntlet, he enters the castle hoping to rescue his fiancée.

Within the castle, Leon fights five guardians: Medusa, a Succubus, a Golem, the vampire Joachim Armster (Walter Bernhard&#x27;s former ally), and an undead parasite. He gets a magical orb from each of them that unlocks the way to Walter&#x27;s lair. When he gets past the initial barrier, Walter is there with Sara, who appears to be in some sort of trance. Walter returns Sara to Leon, who finds out that Sara has been tainted and will soon become a vampire. In an act of self-sacrifice, Sara offers her soul to Leon in a ritual that will make Rinaldo&#x27;s magic whip deadly to vampires and thus allow Leon to defeat Walter. This is where the whip officially becomes &quot;Vampire Killer.&quot; Leon, armed with the powerful whip, Rinaldo&#x27;s grief, and his anger for Sara&#x27;s death, defeats Walter. However, Walter&#x27;s death was in actuality orchestrated by Leon&#x27;s friend Mathias Cronqvist to get Walter&#x27;s Soul, and absorb its powers to become a powerful vampire through the Crimson Stone, (an artifact that allowed a person to steal a Vampire&#x27;s soul and make their power theirs, at the price of becoming a vampire themselves) and Vampire Killer can now sense his having abandoned Humanity. He offers Leon eternal life, which Leon refuses, saying that eternal life would be empty without Sara. Mathias then sends his servant Death after Leon, who is defeated by him and gives him a message to pass on to Mathias. Leon swears that his clan and the whip he now carries will destroy Mathias one day, and from that day onward the Belmont clan would hunt the night. Mathias would later be known as Dracula.

Leon appears in sprite form in Portrait of Ruin as one of the &quot;Greatest Five&quot;.

====Rinaldo Gandolfi====
 is an alchemist whose daughter was taken and turned into a vampire by Walter Bernhard. He now lives in a small hut in the Forest of Eternal Night. Rinaldo creates the Whip of Alchemy for Leon to use in Walter&#x27;s castle. This whip is later fused with the soul of Sara Trantoul to create the Vampire Killer, which would be present, in one form or another, in every Castlevania game.

====Sara Trantoul====
 is the fiancée of Leon Belmont. She is kidnapped by Walter Bernhard and bitten. Not wanting to become a vampire, she sacrifices herself to create the Vampire Killer whip.

====Walter Bernhard====
 is a vampire of unknown age. Having grown bored with eternal life, he decides to kidnap young maidens and play a game of Cat-and-mouse with the Hunters who come to rescue them, and attempt to destroy him. He is the antagonist of the game, luring the protagonist Baron Leon Belmont to his castle by kidnapping his fiancée, Sara Trantoul. The forest where he lives is called Eternal Night, as it is covered in unending darkness by the means of a jewel called the &quot;Ebony Stone&quot;. In the end, Walter is defeated, and Mathias absorbs his soul.

====Joachim Armster====
 is another vampire who is kept prisoner by Walter in his castle. Joachim has a hatred for Walter and what he has done to him. As well as being a minor boss character, the game includes an unlockable secret mode where Joachim is a playable character; he has the ability to summon flying swords of darkness.

====Shanoa====
 is the most prodigious member of the Order of Ecclesia, a secret organization devoted to stop Dracula from reviving after the Belmont clan disappeared. She is also a glyph user, capable of absorbing sigil-like characters and using them as weapons. She is chosen by Barlowe to bear Dominus, a series of glyphs designed to destroy Dracula, but her fellow member Albus interferes during the ceremony and steals the glyphs. As a result, Shanoa becomes an amnesiac who is only able to simulate emotions (she cannot truly feel them).

After being retrained by Barlowe, Shanoa is dispatched to seek out and retrieve Dominus from Albus by any means necessary. As she travels, she slowly learns Albus&#x27;s true intentions and the dark reality behind Ecclesia, but she is unable to stop the return of Dracula. With nothing left to her except her mission, Shanoa enters Dracula&#x27;s castle and destroys the evil count using Dominus.

====Albus====
 is one of Ecclesia&#x27;s veteran members. He wields a magically infused flintlock pistol named Agartha that is capable of firing a variety of projectiles, and also has the ability to warp across short distances. Initially, Barlowe promised Albus that he would receive the Dominus seal, but changed his mind without his consent and chose Shanoa instead. After stealing Dominus from Ecclesia during the ceremony in which it was to be implanted within Shanoa, Albus flees with the glyph and becomes the enemy of Ecclesia. He spends much of the time researching the Dominus glyph and devising a way to incorporate it into himself. However, when he absorbs one part of the glyph (as he had given the other two away in order to observe how glyphs are absorbed) he is driven mad and Shanoa is forced to slay him.

If Shanoa kills Albus after rescuing all of the villagers, Albus will speak to her through Dominus and reveal his intentions in stealing the glyph. He had acted the way he did in order to protect Shanoa, who was raised as his younger sister, from the soul-stealing effects of the glyph, as channeling it would kill the user. He also has her promise not to use Dominus, as it would kill her. She also gains Albus&#x27; memories, some of which correlate with the ones she had lost. As it transpires, Albus&#x27;s soul remains within Shanoa as she explores Dracula&#x27;s castle, and he uses this opportunity to find a way to unlock her emotions, though her own memories are forever lost. When Shanoa uses Dominus to destroy Dracula, Albus offers his own soul as sacrifice, allowing Shanoa to live. Before his soul vanishes, Albus restores Shanoa&#x27;s emotions and asks that she smile for him, which she manages before crying.

====Barlowe====
 is Ecclesia&#x27;s leader, who has been tasked with seeking a way to combat Dracula&#x27;s power in the absence of the Belmont clan. To this end, he created the Dominus glyph out of Dracula&#x27;s power and was in the process of giving them to Shanoa when Albus interfered and made off with the glyphs. When Shanoa returns after learning the truth about Dominus and the cost for its use, Barlowe reveals that he himself has been corrupted by Dracula&#x27;s power, and that his goal all along was to have Shanoa sacrifice her soul to Dracula through Dominus so the evil count can return once more. After Shanoa critically wounds him in battle, Barlowe uses the last of his strength to bring Dracula to life again.

====Villagers of Wygol====
In her travels, Shanoa encounters villagers from a location called Wygol, whom Albus captures and takes blood from in his studies on Dominus. After being rescued, the villagers will offer various side-quests for Shanoa to complete in exchange for money and special items. Shanoa must rescue all thirteen of the villagers in order to continue the storyline after defeating Albus.

After Albus&#x27;s death, the villagers are revealed to be indirect descendants of the Belmont clan, and their blood is what allows Albus&#x27;s soul to live within Shanoa after he himself is killed.

===&quot;Judgment&quot;===
According to Iga, &quot;So as many of you know, the Castlevania timeline goes over 1000 years&quot;, &quot;And there is a character trying to destroy that timeline. Due to magic forces, a variety of characters from different eras are brought together.&quot;

====Aeon====
 is a time-obsessed warrior with no era to call his own. He pulled together various heroes and villains from different eras into a time rift to collect soul keys, and to find a champion to stop the Time Reaper from destroying the universe. Of note is that Aeon utters some of the Same lines used by Time Traveler Saint Germain in &quot;Castlevania: Curse of Darkness&quot;, an association between the two characters is not implicitly stated.

====Time Reaper====
The Time Reaper is a being sent from 10,000 years in the future by Galamoth to destroy Dracula and the timeline.
While the team members worked actively with IGA to ensure the game was consistent with the canon, Order of Shadows is considered a side story to the Castlevania canon.

====Desmond, Zoe and Dolores Belmont====
Desmond Belmont is the main character of &quot;Order of Shadows&quot;. Zoe and Dolores Belmont are the sisters of Desmond. Dolores is the youngest of the three vampire hunter siblings. She is equally capable of handling the Vampire Killer Whip, though she is not of age yet.

====Giovanni====
Giovanni is a descendant of Rinaldo Gandolfi who aided the Belmont Clan in tracking The Order in the game Order of Shadows. The Belmont sisters came upon the Alchemic Gauntlet in the Order&#x27;s possession and he tells them that it will be able to give its owner the ability to use alchemical artifacts.

====Rohan Krause====
Rohan Krause is the leader of The Order who attempts to resurrect Dracula in the late 17th century. He claims to have killed Desmond Belmont&#x27;s father even though he had the Vampire Killer Whip. He is a master of alchemy and was in possession of the Magic Gauntlet which Rinaldo had given Leon Belmont centuries ago. He plotted to resurrect Dracula using a blood sacrifice and planned to serve at his side. However, the Belmont&#x27;s and their allies were able to track down the order long before they were ready to revive the Dark Lord properly. He is defeated at the hand of Desmond, who indicated that he was only seeking the prevention of Dracula&#x27;s revival, not revenge for what he had done to his father. Though his dreams of being one of Dracula&#x27;s right-hand men during his reign was shattered, his own blood was sufficient to raise his lord and Desmond had to battle an early risen Dracula shortly afterwards.

===&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;===
&quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; is being described as a reboot of the franchise; it is not part of the main series&#x27; timeline.

====Gabriel Belmont====
 is the central character of the &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; series. He is a member of the Brotherhood of Light, an elite group of holy knights who protect and defend the innocent against the supernatural. He learns of a Mask which has the power to bring back the dead, and contemplates on using it to revive his recently murdered wife.

As an infant he was found abandoned at the door of one of the Brotherhood of the Light convents. It is not known who his original parents were. Some suspect he was the unwanted child of a local wealthy landowner, most likely from the Cronqvist family, though this has never been proven. The Order named the boy after the blessed Archangel Gabriel and raised him as one of their own. The precocious child quickly proved to be extremely talented, developing a mastery of the fighting arts unprecedented in the Brotherhood. Gabriel took the surname of Belmont, due to his love for mountains and the high places of the world. The name Belmont is of French origin, and it means &quot;beautiful mountain&quot;. The name is the union of two French words: &quot;bel&quot;, meaning beautiful and &quot;mont&quot; meaning mountain.

Prone to dark moods and occasional ambivalence, Gabriel was deeply affected by the death of his childhood sweetheart, Marie. Gabriel has embarked on this journey at the request of the elders of the Brotherhood, rejecting the help of his comrades and stoking a burning desire for revenge. In a post-credits scene, Gabriel is shown to have become the powerful vampire lord Dracula and subsequently the second game explores his quest for redemption and goal to put an end to his immortal existence.

Gabriel is voiced in all three games by Scottish actor Robert Carlyle.

====Zobek====
 is a mysterious swordsman who encourages Gabriel to use The Mask to bring back his dead wife Marie.

If the recorded chronicles of the Brotherhood are to be believed, Zobek is one of their longest-serving warriors. The list of heroic deeds attributed to him is as impressive as his vast knowledge of the art of war or indeed the mighty fighting skills he can deploy, despite his age.

His weapon of choice is a simple long sword which he handles with skill and alacrity. Strangely, he likes to use an old-fashioned uniform of the Brotherhood of Light that, according to him, was inherited from one of his ancestors; one of the founding members of the Brotherhood of Light. In reality, he is the dark side left by one of the founding members of the order, the Lord of the Dead. This has led to speculation that he is this universe&#x27;s Death which is confirmed by the producers.

====Marie Belmont====
 is Gabriel&#x27;s beloved wife. She was brutally murdered by the evil forces of darkness and her soul was trapped for eternity. Her spirit guides him on his quest to rid the land of evil.

 is the ancient Greek god of the old forest who may hold a clue to the circumstances surrounding the death of Gabriel&#x27;s wife. Pan has contacted the Brotherhood of the Light to tell them that Marie Belmont calls from the other side and wishes to speak to her husband, so Gabriel searches for Pan&#x27;s hidden grotto to seek the truth. During Gabriel&#x27;s journey, Pan assumes several forms including a horse, an eagle, and an armor-clad knight.

Voiced by Eve Karpf.

====Satan====
 is the main antagonist of the series, and plotted all of the events of the first game. He is also the final boss.

Satan&#x27;s primary motivation seems to be to have his vengeance against God for being cast out of Heaven. He reveals himself as the manipulator of the first game&#x27;s events in the end. After he is defeated by Gabriel Belmont, he drops the God Mask, which Gabriel uses to speak to his deceased wife for a short time. He reappears in &quot;Lords of Shadow 2&quot;, where he serves as the main antagonist and final boss again. After his Acolytes manage to summon him to the mortal world, this time Satan chooses to possess Alucard, the son of Gabriel, who is now known as the powerful vampire Dracula. After his defeat, he flees from Alucard&#x27;s body and is killed by Dracula, who uses his old Vampire Killer weapon to deliver the final blow.

Voiced by Anthony Howell.

====Toy Maker====

At a time, the Toy Maker was the brightest pupil of Rinaldo Gandolfi; Though, he much preferred to build toys for children and the skill that gave him his name made him legendary across the lands. However, hearing of his skill was Walter Bernhard, a member of the Bernhard family who offered the Toy Maker a place in his Castle to make his craft.

In time, the Toy Maker realized that Walter came from a family of dark occultists. Walter summoned a demon to possess the Toy Maker&#x27;s kindly soul, thereby twisting his craft in the darkest way and making weapons of death and destruction, some being the Dark Pain, the Stopwatch, the Macabre Puppet, and Gargoyles.

The demon, however, was unable to completely corrupt the Toy Maker&#x27;s soul, resulting in something of a split personality; the original kind old man and the childish, sadistic demon within. Sometime during this period, the Toy Maker was touched by the puppet of a child seeking to free his soul from the demon and escape Walter Bernhard. He then discovered he had regained his innocence and Walter removed his heart, putting the Toy Maker into a deep slumber.

His fate is unknown when Carmilla took over the castle, and only then until Gabriel Belmont, rechristened as Dracula, took over as well.

Voiced by Mark Healy.

====Agreus====

Agreus is the brother of the deceased Pan, coming to Dracula&#x27;s Castle to seek revenge against his killer, the vampire lord Dracula. First Agreus lures Dracula into the Castle&#x27;s gardens with a fragment of the Mirror of Fate knowing that he would seek the fragment for his son Trevor Belmont. As Dracula attempts to claim the fragment, Agreus steals it from him and informs the vampire that he intends to avenge Pan&#x27;s death. Dracula tries to reason with Agreus that his brother chose to sacrifice himself for a cause that he believed in, but Agreus retorts that Pan only died to serve his quest for power. Declaring that Dracula would pay for what he had done, Agreus retreats into the maze, goading the vampire to follow him.

Now trapped inside the maze with the vengeful God, Dracula is forced to evade him in order to escape. Agreus taunts the vampire, claiming that he would relish hunting him down but Dracula manages to avoid him long enough to reclaim the fragment from his Owl Familiar. Enraged, Agreus vows to destroy Dracula and challenges him to a final battle. Eventually the two warriors tumble off the edge of the cliff but Dracula uses Agreus to break his fall. With the Old God weakened and unable to fight back, Dracula proceeds to crush Agreus&#x27; skull, killing him.

====Gorgon Sisters====

The Gorgon Sisters, Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa are a trio of Old God females who take on the macabre appearances of young girls while having snake-like appendages flailing out of their bodies, which resulted from centuries of living and staying together underground in the City of the Damned. They keep the Chaos claws that Gabriel needs for his journey. Euryale and Stheno provide tips and warnings for Gabriel, but by the time they reunite with their sister, it is discovered that Medusa has been infected with the Castle&#x27;s Evil Blood. She spreads it to her sisters and the three transform into a single three-headed Gorgon titan that Gabriel kills after slicing off two of its heads and extracting its heart, turning the creature into stone.

==Animated series==
===Overview===

===&quot;Castlevania&quot; (2017–2021)===
====Trevor Belmont====
Trevor Belmont (voiced by Richard Armitage) is the last surviving member of the Belmont clan, a noble family of monster hunters; whose dedication to protecting the citizens of Wallachia led to the Church excommunicating them and evicting them from their ancestral lands, as they were accused of practicing black magic. He first appears to be a washed-up lazy drunkard, though he eventually sobers up to reveal his great skill in slaying monsters. Despite his cynical and pessimistic attitude, he remains dedicated to protecting the innocent from the forces of evil.

====Sypha Belnades====
Sypha Belnades (voiced by Alejandra Reynoso) is a young witch and member of a community of nomadic scholars known as the Speakers, who are demonized by the Church as they are falsely accused of causing the attacks conducted by Dracula&#x27;s army. She seeks out the &quot;sleeping soldier&quot; that she hopes will stop Dracula&#x27;s attack, only to be turned to stone by a cyclops before being saved by Trevor Belmont, who helps her find Alucard and release him from his prison. In the Belmont estate&#x27;s repository of knowledge, she finds an incomplete spell meant to force Dracula&#x27;s castle to appear in a given place and trap it there. Completing the spell, she successfully casts it which destroys the mechanisms that allow the castle to teleport, allowing the trio to confront Dracula. After Alucard drives a wooden stake through Dracula&#x27;s heart and Trevor beheads him, Sypha burns what&#x27;s left with her magic. Following Dracula&#x27;s defeat, Sypha proposes to Trevor that they continue traveling together, fighting monsters and forming a romantic relationship. Finding themselves in the town of Lindenfeld, Sypha and Trevor ally themselves with Saint Germain to stop an attempt to resurrect Dracula. Sypha&#x27;s enthusiasm for her lifestyle is soured by the events in Lindenfeld, which sees the entire town sacrificed in the efforts to revive Dracula. After weeks of chasing down vampires trying to resurrect Dracula, she complains that being around Trevor has made her more like him. She and Trevor find themselves in Targoviste and resolve to be more active in the events around them rather than reactive. Their battles in Targoviste lead them to a transmission mirror through which they follow Varney to arrive back at Dracula&#x27;s Castle. They aid Alucard who is fending off an invasion and successfully stop Saint Germain and Death (who had disguised himself as Varney) from returning both Dracula and Lisa Tepes to life. After Trevor seemingly perishes defeating Death, Sypha realizes that she is pregnant and prepares to return to her Speaker caravan. Alucard convinces her to stay with the community that is making the grounds of the castle and the Belmont Hold its home, and immediately after, Trevor returns, to Sypha&#x27;s equal joy and frustration.

====Alucard====

Adrian &quot;Alucard&quot; Țepeș (voiced by James Callis) is the dhampir son of Dracula and Lisa. He opposes Dracula&#x27;s mission to eradicate humanity, but loses their first confrontation, forcing him into slumber to heal his wounds. He is awakened by Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belnades, and after testing them in battle, joins them in a quest to stop Dracula.

Alucard returns in &quot;&quot; (still voiced by James Callis), which is set over 300 years after the first animated series. Alucard first appears at the end of the Season 1 finale to help the heroes fight Erzsebet Báthory, first by killing her second-in-command Drolta Tzeuntes and threatening their vampire minions into fleeing.

====Dracula====

Vlad Dracula Țepeș (voiced by Graham McTavish) is the father of Alucard, husband of Lisa, and the main antagonist of Seasons 1 and 2. He is an infamous vampire sorcerer and warlord who is the de-facto leader of all vampires in the world, due to being the most powerful of his kind. After his beloved human wife Lisa was executed by the Church on dubious charges of witchcraft, Dracula declares a genocidal war to exterminate all of humanity, beginning with Wallachia.

====Lisa Ţepeş====
Lisa Țepeș (voiced by Emily Swallow) is the human mother of Alucard and wife of Dracula. She is a doctor and scientist who seeks out Dracula to educate her in his medical knowledge, quickly befriending and falling in love with him. Her backstory remains mostly the same from the video game series, with the exception that she was accused of witchcraft because she reverse engineered the more advanced technology Dracula possessed to improve the lives of the Wallachian people, which the Church condemned as the Devil&#x27;s work.

====The Bishop====
The Bishop (voiced by Matt Frewer) is the secondary antagonist of Season 1. He is a corrupt and zealously fanatical Christian clergyman from Gresit who triggers the series&#x27; overall conflict by ordering Lisa&#x27;s execution on trumped-up charges of witchcraft, thus provoking Dracula&#x27;s wrath and inspiring his mission to destroy the entire human race. This ultimately comes back around to result in his own downfall and demise, as a group of Night Creatures break into the Bishop&#x27;s unsanctified church in Gresit, with one of them (a demon named Blue Eyes) killing the Bishop, after thanking him for inadvertently causing this entire crisis and mocking the Bishop&#x27;s misplaced faith in a God who hates his sinful hypocrisy.

====The Elder====
The Elder (voiced by Tony Amendola) is the wise old leader of the Speakers, a nomadic tribe of wandering scholars. He is also the grandfather of Sypha Belnades. While he and his people are staying in Gresit despite violent persecution by the Church and relentless attacks by Night Creatures, his granddaughter Sypha has gone missing in the underground catacombs, so he requests Trevor&#x27;s help with finding and rescuing his grandchild.

====Isaac====
Isaac (voiced by Adetokumboh M&#x27;Cormack) is a Devil Forgemaster, a skilled necromancer who serves as one of two human generals under Dracula, creating and commanding demonic monsters called Night Creatures for Dracula&#x27;s army. He is portrayed as a former African slave who was regularly whipped for small offenses. His suffering led to him developing a complete misanthropic disdain for humanity, and he soon killed his master. His loyalty to Dracula and his cause comes from Dracula treating him with far more respect than any human he ever met.

====Hector====
Hector (voiced by Theo James) is a Devil Forgemaster, a skilled necromancer who serves as one of two human generals under Dracula, creating and commanding demonic monsters called Night Creatures for Dracula&#x27;s army. As a child, he was beaten and isolated for his penchant of resurrecting dead animals as undead pets. After burning down his house (parents included), he worked to perfect his craft in necromancy, leading to his eventual recruitment into Dracula&#x27;s forces.

====Godbrand====
Godbrand (voiced by Peter Stormare) is a Viking vampire warrior and one of several generals in Dracula&#x27;s army. He enjoys the thrill of hunting, fighting and killing humans, but it doesn&#x27;t take long for him to realize that Dracula&#x27;s campaign to exterminate all of humanity will eventually result in the starvation of all vampires. He is eventually persuaded by Carmilla (whom Godbrand has one-sided sexual lust for) to join her in betraying Dracula; but when he makes an ill-fated attempt to recruit Isaac as well, this ultimately results in Isaac killing Godbrand out of unwavering loyalty to Dracula&#x27;s cause.

====Carmilla====
Carmilla (voiced by Jaime Murray) is the leader of the Council of Sisters, a quartet of vampire noblewomen who rule Styria. Despite also serving as a general for Dracula, she is shown to have a distinct disloyalty to him, as she considers him to be a suicidal madman whose genocidal vendetta against the humans is threatening the existence of the vampire race. She tricks Hector into betraying Dracula, and takes him captive in the aftermath of Dracula&#x27;s defeat. Carmilla then plans to claim the scattered territories between Wallachia and her home territory of Styria, a plan which hinges on having Hector forge Night Creatures to provide her with an army. While her co-ruler Lenore manages to coerce Hector&#x27;s cooperation, Carmilla&#x27;s ambitions ultimately do not proceed very far. Her other co-rulers Striga and Morana muse that ruling such a large swatch of land full of humans who will not submit to vampire rule is impractical, and Isaac manages to assault her castle shortly after Hector begins forging for her. She fights Isaac in a duel to the death, and kills herself rather than suffer defeat at his hands.

====Lenore====
Lenore (voiced by Jessica Brown Findlay) is one of the four members of the Council of Sisters, serving as their professional diplomat and negotiator. She is in charge of watching over their slave Hector and convincing him to forge them an army. Going against Carmilla, Lenore then gives Hector clothes and moves him to a candle-lit cell with a desk and a blanket. Over time, Hector falls for Lenore&#x27;s charms. She tricks Hector by slipping a magic ring onto his finger as they are having sex, which enslaves him. Lenore presents the Council with rings she had forged to make Hector&#x27;s night creatures loyal to them. The ring will also instantly kill Hector if he attempts to run away from them.

====Morana and Striga====
Morana (voiced by Yasmine Al Massri) and Striga (voiced by Ivana Miličević) are the other two members of the Council of Sisters, who are also in a romantic relationship with each other. Morana serves as a political strategist and interrogator/torturer, while Striga is the commanding general of Styria&#x27;s vampire army.

====Saint Germain====
Saint Germain (voiced by Bill Nighy) is an alchemist and magician who is seeking access to the Infinite Corridor, an interdimensional portal in which an unnamed woman he loves is trapped. In Season 3, he assists Trevor and Sypha with infiltrating a demon-infested priory in exchange for access to the arcane knowledge of its library.

In Season 4, he sides with the forces of evil to attempt to resurrect Dracula via an alchemical Rebis, believing it will give him the ability to travel freely through the Infinite Corridor and rescue his beloved. Eventually he realizes he has been deceived by Death, and dies while casting a spell that saves Trevor&#x27;s life.

====The Judge====
The Judge (voiced by Jason Isaacs) is the leader of the village of Lindenfeld, who recruits Trevor and Sypha to help him try and thwart the sinister schemes of Sala&#x27;s Satanist cult.

====Sala====
Sala (voiced by Navid Negahban) is the leader of the monks in the Lindenfeld priory. Formerly a devoted Christian, he and his fellow monks have now converted into a Satanist cult under the influence of a gigantic Night Creature who is secretly living inside the priory&#x27;s basement. Their ultimate goal is to resurrect Dracula from the depths of Hell using the Infinite Corridor.

====Sumi and Taka====
Sumi (voiced by Rila Fukushima) and Taka (voiced by Toru Uchikado) are Japanese vampire hunters who travel to Wallachia to be trained by Alucard. They were once enslaved by a Japanese vampiress named Chō, who actually enlisted as a general in Dracula&#x27;s army, but was killed by Sypha in the Season 2 finale. Alucard originally suspected they were thieves but began to bond with them, going as far as showing them the Belmont Hold.

While he was in his bed one night, they entered his room and proceeded to have sex with him, but they then suddenly restrain Alucard by using a trap. Taka and Sumi accuse Alucard of withholding his knowledge of magic from them and not teaching them how to operate the castle. Before they can stake him, he uses his sword to slit their throats. Following their betrayal, Alucard is later seen prostrate and weeping on the floor. The third season ends with Alucard at the castle&#x27;s entrance, where he has left the impaled bodies of Sumi and Taka as a warning to future visitors.

====FlysEyes====
FlysEyes (voiced by Gildart Jackson) is a Night Creature, one of many demonic monsters created by Isaac through necromancy. He is an insect-like humanoid demon, whose body contains the soul of a long-deceased damned sinner from Hell. He is one of few Night Creatures who are capable of intelligibly speaking like a human, and does so very eloquently.

FlysEyes recounts his backstory during a conversation with Isaac: centuries ago during his human life, he was a Greek philosopher from Athens who was persecuted by Christian authorities for questioning God&#x27;s existence. He gave up the names of his friends in a failed attempt to save himself, but was executed anyways. Because of his betrayal of his own comrades, he was condemned to eternal damnation in Hell, gradually being twisted into the demonic creature he is now.

====The Captain====
The Captain (voiced by Lance Reddick) is a sailor who semi-reluctantly helps Isaac sail across the Mediterranean Sea from Tunis to Genoa. He is a rather chill and laidback man who engages in a prolonged conversation with Isaac, persuading Isaac to moderate his misanthropic worldview.

====Miranda====
Miranda (voiced by Barbara Steele) is an old woman whom Isaac meets during his travels. She turns out to be a witch, and had witnessed another unnamed magician abduct all of her neighbors and turn them into his mind-controlled slaves.

====Zamfir====
Zamfir (voiced by Toks Olagundoye) is the head guard of Targoviste&#x27;s underground court.

====Greta====
Greta of Danesti (voiced by Marsha Thomason) is introduced in Season 4 as the leader of the village of Danesti and love interest of Alucard; she is based on Grant Danasty from the &quot;Castlevania&quot; video games.

====Varney / Death====
Varney (voiced by Malcolm McDowell) is the main antagonist of Season 4. He is initially introduced as an arrogant vampire from London who claims to have been a close associate of Dracula, though he is unrecognized by most people who encounter him.

In reality, Varney is actually a disguised alter-ego of Death; though this version is not a true personification of death, but is more like a parasitic spiritual entity who feeds on the deaths of all living beings. Disguising himself as both Varney and the Alchemist (voiced by Christine Adams), Death manipulates Saint Germain into resurrecting Dracula via an alchemical process as a Rebis containing the souls of both Vlad and Lisa Tepes. With the two souls in one body driving Dracula insane, Death plans to feast on the resulting mass murder of humanity.

After Trevor Belmont destroys the Rebis, he engages Death in a climactic duel to the death, the final battle of the whole series. Trevor ultimately kills Death with a magical dagger designed to destroy divine beings.

====Ratko====
Ratko (voiced by Titus Welliver) is a Slavic vampire soldier who is reluctantly allied with Varney, despite feeling nothing but contempt for Varney and his scheming ways. Ratko arrogantly claims to be the greatest vampire warrior, preferring to use ruthlessly dirty tactics to destroy his enemies as efficiently as possible.

He is tasked by Varney with tracking down the location of Targoviste&#x27;s underground court and eliminating all the humans within. While leading an assault against the underground court, he is ultimately killed in combat by Trevor.

====Dragan====
Dragan (voiced by Matthew Waterson) is a Slavic vampire general who is also allied with Varney. He commands a vast army of Night Creatures and vampire warriors from all over the world to assault Dracula&#x27;s castle, where Alucard and Greta are sheltering human refugees from Danesti.

He also aids Varney&#x27;s plot to resurrect Dracula by recruiting Saint Germain and four unnamed vampire magicians to create a Rebis which will contain the souls of Dracula and Lisa. After Trevor, Sypha, and Alucard eliminate all the other demons and vampires invading the castle, including the four vampire magicians, they engage Dragan in combat and ultimately kill him as well.

He makes a deal with Erzsebet Báthory to cement their alliance, intending to sacrifice Maria to her. In the end, his actions cost Tera her freedom and humanity.

====Edouard====
Edouard (voiced by Sydney James Harcourt) is an opera singer and Annette&#x27;s close friend. He aided her in a slave uprising in Saint-Domingue. He dies in France and is turned into a night creature by the Abbot, although he still has memories of his former life. His singing allows him to awaken the memories and humanity within certain Night Creatures.

====Tera Renard====
Tera Renard (voiced by Nastassja Kinski) is a Speaker magician, Maria&#x27;s mother, and a distant relative of the Belmont clan. She respects the Abbot and fears Báthory. She offers herself to Báthory in lieu of her daughter, and she is turned into a vampire.

<doc id="737761" wikidata="Q8075922" url="?curid=737761" title="ZymoGenetics">
<text>ZymoGenetics, Inc was one of the oldest biotechnology/pharmaceutical companies in the USA, based in Seattle, Washington. The company was involved in the development of therapeutic proteins. Located on Lake Union, the address of the ZymoGenetics headquarters was 1201 Eastlake Avenue East. It was closed in 2019 after its acquisition by Bristol Myers Squibb.

The company was founded in 1981 by Professors Earl W. Davie and Benjamin D. Hall of the University of Washington and 1993 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry Michael Smith of the University of British Columbia. Initially named Zymos, the company was forced to change its name to ZymoGenetics under threat of trademark infringement from the similarly named semiconductor company ZyMOS. Soon after its founding, ZymoGenetics began working on recombinant proteins with Danish company Novo Nordisk, and was acquired by that company in 1988. It was spun off as a public company in 2000. Bristol-Myers Squibb acquired the company in 2010 for $885 million.

ZymoGenetics&#x27; headquarters was previously in the landmark Lake Union Steam Plant building. This structure was built from 1914 to 1921 by Seattle City Light, the municipal electric utility. At the time, the building was in poor condition with many broken windows; Bruce Carter, the chief executive at the time, described it as &quot;the mother of all fixer-uppers&quot;. In December 2016, ZymoGenetics announced that they would not renew the lease to the Steam Plant building, due to expire in 2019; the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center later moved into it. At the time, ZymoGenetics did not plan on closing its Bothell manufacturing site; however, it was sold to Seattle Genetics in August 2017. ZymoGenetics closed completely in 2019.

==Corporate governance==
In late 2013, the company&#x27;s president, Stephen W. Zaruby, left and took up the president and chief executive officer roles at Aurinia Pharmaceuticals.

<doc id="737763" wikidata="Q3651664" url="?curid=737763" title="Camp Upton">
<text>Camp Upton was a port of embarkation of the United States Army during World War I. During World War II, it was used as an Army induction center, an internment camp for enemy aliens, and a hospital. It was located in Yaphank, New York, in Suffolk County on Long Island, on the present-day location of Brookhaven National Laboratory.

==History==

===World War I===

Camp Upton, with a capacity of 18,000 troops, was one of three transient embarkation camps directly under control of the New York Port of Embarkation during World War I. The camp was named after Emory Upton, a Union general of the Civil War. The camp was created in 1917 to house troops as they awaited ships for deployment overseas. From Camp Mills the units traveled by trains of the Long Island Rail Road to board ferryboats for the overseas piers in Brooklyn or Hoboken when scheduled for embarkation aboard troop ships.

The 152nd Depot Brigade was the garrison unit that received new recruits and prepared them for service overseas, and then out processed demobilizing soldiers at the end of the war. Irving Berlin, the composer, and Alvin York, the most decorated soldier of the American army in World War I, were processed at Camp Upton. The 77th Division was first organized there. During part of the war, the 82nd Division was quartered there.

At the end of World War I, the camp was used to demobilize and inactivate units. Some of the units demobilized at the camp were: the 327th Infantry Regiment, the 325th Infantry Regiment, the 27th Infantry Division&#x27;s 53rd Brigade (105th, 106th Infantry Regiments and the 105th Machine Gun Battalion), and the 101st Signal Battalion.

In May 1919, Camp Upton became the site of the Recruit Educational Center, an Army program that enrolled foreign-born, non-English speaking, and illiterate soldiers. Most of the Recruit Educational Center&#x27;s inductees were immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. In practice, the program aimed to &quot;Americanize&quot; these immigrants through instruction in the English language, military protocol, U.S. history, geography, citizenship, and political economy. Soldiers who graduated from the Recruit Educational Center at Camp Upton were eligible for a three-year term of military service, after which they could be naturalized as American citizens.

In 1921, the federal government sold the buildings and equipment but kept the land. In 1925 the site was designated as Upton National Forest, but was rescinded in 1927. Many of the structures from the camp were transported to form the first large scale settlement at Cherry Grove, New York on Fire Island.

===World War II===
Camp Upton was used as an Army induction center in the mobilization of 1940 that preceded the American entry into World War II. Later it was an internment site holding German, Italian and Japanese citizens who were in New York City or on merchant vessels at the time war broke out. On March 16, 1943, the internees were transferred to Fort George G. Meade in Maryland. In September 1944, Camp Upton became a convalescent and rehabilitation hospital.

===Brookhaven National Laboratory===
In 1946, after the camp was closed, the federal government chose the site to build a nuclear research facility that would retain America&#x27;s preeminence in that field. The former Camp Upton was renamed Brookhaven National Laboratory and was operated by AUI, a consortium of universities, for the United States Atomic Energy Commission.

==In popular culture==
Irving Berlin, while stationed at Camp Upton, wrote a musical, &quot;Yip, Yip, Yaphank&quot;, which included the memorable song &quot;Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning.&quot; The musical was turned into a 1943 movie &quot;This Is The Army&quot; which starred Ronald Reagan.

<text>Olin Chaddock Wilson (January 13, 1909 – July 13, 1994) was an American astronomer best known for his work as a stellar spectroscopist.

Born in San Francisco, California as the son of a lawyer, Wilson showed an interest in physics at an early age. He studied astronomy and physics at the University of California, Berkeley and wrote his first scientific paper in 1932 on the subject of the speed of light. He received his PhD from the California Institute of Technology in 1934.

Wilson was a staff member of Mount Wilson Observatory (not named after Olin Wilson) for most of his research career where he studied stellar chromospheres. He was the first scientist to discover activity cycles, similar to the solar 11-year sunspot cycle, in other stars. In collaboration with Vainu Bappu, an Indian astronomer, he also showed that there was a correlation between the width of the Ca II lines in stellar spectra and the star&#x27;s luminosity, the Wilson–Bappu effect.

He gave the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship in 1977 and won the Bruce Medal in 1984.

<text>The noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala) is a bird in the honeyeater family, Meliphagidae, and is endemic to eastern and southeastern Australia. This miner is a grey bird, with a black head, orange-yellow beak and feet, a distinctive yellow patch behind the eye, and white tips on the tail feathers. The Tasmanian subspecies has a more intense yellow panel in the wing, and a broader white tip to the tail. Males, females and juveniles are similar in appearance, though young birds are a brownish-grey. As the common name suggests, the noisy miner is a vocal species with a large range of songs, calls, scoldings and alarms, and almost constant vocalisations, particularly from young birds. One of four species in the genus &quot;Manorina&quot;, the noisy miner itself is divided into four subspecies. The separation of the Tasmanian &quot;M. m. leachi&quot; is of long standing, and the mainland birds were further split in 1999.

Found in a broad arc from Far North Queensland through New South Wales and Victoria to Tasmania and southeastern South Australia, the noisy miner primarily inhabits dry, open eucalypt forests that lack understory shrubs. These include forests dominated by spotted gum, box and ironbark, as well as in degraded woodland where the understory has been cleared, such as recently burned areas, farming and grazing areas, roadside reserves, and suburban parks and gardens with trees and grass, but without dense shrubbery. The density of noisy miner populations has significantly increased in many locations across its range, particularly in human-dominated habitats. The popularity of nectar-producing garden plants, such as the large-flowered grevilleas, was thought to play a role in its proliferation, but studies now show that the noisy miner has benefited primarily from landscaping practices that create open areas dominated by eucalypts.

Noisy miners are gregarious and territorial; they forage, bathe, roost, breed and defend territory communally, forming colonies that can contain several hundred birds. Each bird has an &#x27;activity space&#x27;, and birds with overlapping activity spaces form associations called &#x27;coteries&#x27;, which are the most stable units within the colony. The birds also form temporary flocks called &#x27;coalitions&#x27; for specific activities, such as mobbing a predator. Group cohesion is facilitated not only by vocalisations, but also through ritualised displays, which have been categorised as flight displays, postural displays, and facial displays. The noisy miner is a notably aggressive bird, so that chasing, pecking, fighting, scolding, and mobbing occur throughout the day, targeted at both intruders and colony members.

Foraging in the canopy of trees, on trunks and branches, and on the ground, the noisy miner mainly eats nectar, fruit, and insects. Most time is spent gleaning the foliage of eucalypts, and it can meet most of its nutritional needs from manna, honeydew, and lerp gathered from the foliage. The noisy miner does not use a stereotyped courtship display, but copulation is a frenzied communal event. It breeds all year long, building a deep cup-shaped nest and laying two to four eggs. Incubation is by the female only, although up to twenty male helpers take care of the nestlings and fledglings. Noisy miners have a range of strategies to increase their breeding success, including multiple broods and group mobbing of predators. The noisy miner&#x27;s population increase has been correlated with the reduction of avian diversity in human-affected landscapes. Its territoriality means that translocation is unlikely to be a solution to its overabundance, and culling has been proposed, although the noisy miner is currently a protected species across Australia.

==Taxonomy==
English ornithologist John Latham described the noisy miner four times in his 1801 work &quot;Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae&quot;, seemingly not knowing it was the same bird in each case: the chattering bee-eater (&quot;Merops garrulus&quot;), black-headed grackle (&quot;Gracula melanocephala&quot;), hooded bee-eater (&quot;Merops cucullatus&quot;), and white-fronted bee-eater (&quot;Merops albifrons&quot;). Early notes recorded its tendency to scare off prey as hunters were about to shoot. It was as the chattering bee-eater that it was painted between 1792 and 1797 by Thomas Watling, one of a group known collectively as the Port Jackson Painter. John Gould treated the name &quot;Merops garrulus&quot; as the original description, and renamed it &quot;Myzantha garrula&quot; in his 1865 work &quot;Handbook to the Birds of Australia&quot;, giving it the common name of garrulous honeyeater, and noting the alternate name of chattering honeyeater. He noted the colonists of Tasmania called it a miner, and aboriginal people of New South Wales called it &quot;cobaygin&quot;. &quot;Que que gang&quot; was a local aboriginal name from the Blue Mountains.

In the early 19th century, Australian ornithologists started using the name &quot;Manorina melanocephala&quot; instead, because it was listed first by Latham in 1801. This usage did not follow the letter of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, and in 2009 the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature conserved the current name by formally suppressing the name &quot;M. garrula&quot;. The species name &quot;melanocephala&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek words &quot;melas&quot; &#x27;black&#x27;, and &quot;kephale&quot; &#x27;head&#x27;, referring to its black crown. Other common names include Mickey miner and soldierbird. Four subspecies are recognised, including subspecies &quot;leachi&quot; found in eastern Tasmania. The mainland population was split into three subspecies in 1999 by Richard Schodde—&quot;titaniota&quot; from Cape York Peninsula in Queensland as far south as Mareeba, &quot;lepidota&quot; from central Queensland and inland New South Wales west of Nyngan, and the nominate subspecies &quot;melanocephala&quot; from southeastern New South Wales, Victoria, and southern South Australia. There are broad zones where birds are intermediate between subspecies. Further study is required to settle the taxonomic status of these populations.

The noisy miner is one of four species in the genus &quot;Manorina&quot; in the large family of honeyeaters known as Meliphagidae. The other three species of the genus &quot;Manorina&quot; are the black-eared miner (&quot;M. melanotis&quot;), the yellow-throated miner (&quot;M. flavigula&quot;), and the bell miner (&quot;M. melanophrys&quot;). One of the most obvious characteristics of the genus is a patch of bare yellow skin behind the eyes, which gives them an odd &#x27;cross-eyed&#x27; look. Within the genus, the noisy, black-eared and yellow-throated miners form the subgenus &quot;Myzantha&quot;. The noisy miner occasionally hybridises with the yellow-throated miner. Molecular analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and the Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea.

== Description ==

===Appearance===
The noisy miner is a large honeyeater, in length, with a wingspan of , and weighing . Male, female and juvenile birds all have similar plumage: grey on the back, tail and breast, and otherwise white underneath, with white scalloping on the nape and hind-neck, and on the breast; off-white forehead and lores; a black band over the crown, bright orange-yellow bill, and a distinctive patch of yellow skin behind the eye; a prominent white tip to the tail; a narrow olive-yellow panel in the folded wing; and orange-yellow legs and feet. A juvenile can be distinguished by softer plumage, a brownish tinge to the black on its head and the grey on its back, and a duller, greyish-yellow skin-patch behind the eye.

The noisy miner is similar in appearance to the yellow-throated miner and the black-eared miner; it has a dull white forehead and a black crown, while the others have grey heads.

====Geographical variations====
Size variation in the noisy miner over its range follows Bergmann&#x27;s rule; namely, birds tend to be larger where the climate is colder. Adults from central-eastern and northern Queensland tend to have little or no olive-yellow edging to the feathers of the back and wings, and have a wider white fringe on the feathers of the hind-neck and back, giving birds from Queensland the appearance of having more distinctive scalloping than other populations. Wing length generally increases with latitude, yet &quot;M. m. leachi&quot; has measurably shorter wings than the nominate race, although no significant difference in wing length was found in a study comparing populations north of 30° S and south of the Murray River. The subspecies &quot;leachi&quot; also has finer scalloping on the hind-neck than the nominate race, a more intense yellow tinge to the wing panels, and a slightly broader off-white tip to the tail.

The far north Queensland subspecies &quot;titaniota&quot; has a shorter tail, paler crown, larger yellow skin-patch, and paler upper parts without the yellow-olive of the nominate race; and &quot;lepidota&quot;, found in western New South Wales, is smaller than the nominate race with a black crown, and darker, more mottled upperparts.

=== Vocalisations ===
As the common name suggests, the noisy miner is an unusually vocal species. Previously known as the garrulous honeyeater, it has a large and varied repertoire of songs, calls, scoldings, and alarms. Most are loud and penetrating, and consist of harsh single notes. It has two broad-frequency alarm calls that are used when mobbing intruders into their territory, or when predators (including humans) are sighted; and a narrow-frequency alarm call that is primarily used when airborne predators are seen, such as the brown falcon (&quot;Falco berigora&quot;), or other large flying birds, including the Australian magpie (&quot;Gymnorhina tibicen&quot;) and the pied currawong (&quot;Strepera graculina&quot;). The aerial predator alarm call is a series of high-pitched, slurred whistling notes. The broad-frequency alarm calls are a series of &#x27;churr&#x27; notes, low-pitched and harsh, occurring at low and high levels of intensity. The narrow-band call is used in situations where the bird signals the presence of a predator and restricts information about its own location, while the broad-band alarm is used to attract attention, and can initiate mobbing behaviour. These churring calls vary between individuals, and laboratory tests show that noisy miners can distinguish calls by different birds. Hence, this may be integral to the complex social structure of the species.

Contact or social facilitation calls are low-pitched sounds that carry long distances. &#x27;Chip&#x27; calls are given by individual birds when foraging, and a similar call is given by nestlings that call at an increased rate as the mother approaches the nest. Where there is a high level of social activity, such as during territorial disputes with conspecifics, calls are a series of quick, regular, single notes. The noisy miner has a mating display flight song: a soft warble of low-frequency notes given during short, undulating flights by the male, and responded to by the female with a low-frequency whistle. The noisy miner is found in open woodland habitats, where it is an advantage to call from the air, so as to overcome sound attenuation. Another display call, described as &#x27;yammer&#x27;, is a rapid rhythmical series of notes that is uttered during open-bill, wing-waving displays. The noisy miner has a song described as the &#x27;dawn song&#x27;—a communal song of clear, whistled notes emitted in chorus in the early hours of the morning from May through January. The dawn song, which is also sung at dusk, is audible over long distances and features duets that often involve antiphony.
A nestling begins to give the &#x27;chip&#x27; call soon after it emerges from the egg, and it calls frequently for the first two-thirds of the nestling period and constantly for the last third. The call does not vary in the presence of an adult at the nest, so it seems likely that the call is not directed at the adult bird. The nestling becomes silent when an adult gives an alarm call, and makes a squealing sound when the adult delivers food. The begging call of a fledgling is similar to the call of the nestling, but significantly louder and covering a greater frequency range (which may make it more directional). The rate of calling, on average, is 85 to 100 calls in a minute, and in open scrub, the call can be heard up to a kilometre away. Subsong, a juvenile vocalisation comprising elements of various calls, begins to be uttered when the fledgling is around thirty days old.

The noisy miner also produces non-vocal sounds by clicking or snapping its bill, usually during antagonistic encounters with other bird species, or when mobbing a predator.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The noisy miner is endemic to eastern and southeastern Australia, occupying a broad arc from Far North Queensland where there are scattered populations, to New South Wales where it is widespread and common from the coast to a line from Angledool to Balranald, through Victoria into southeastern South Australia, and eastern Tasmania. Its range in South Australia has been steadily expanding since it was first recorded near Adelaide in the early 1890s. It is sedentary over its entire range. The noisy miner is territorial, and the territory of a colony is aggressively defended—which has led to a significant reduction in avian diversity in areas occupied by the noisy miner, with smaller species excluded.
The noisy miner primarily inhabits dry, open eucalypt forest without understory shrubs. It is commonly found in open sclerophyll forests, including those on coastal dunes or granite outcrops; forests dominated by spotted gum on mountain ridges and exposed slopes; box and ironbark forests on the foothills of the Great Dividing Range; mixed forests of eucalypts and cypress (&quot;Callitris&quot;); forests dominated by yapunya, mulga, gidgee, brigalow or emu bush; in stands of belah and scattered clumps of boree; on the edges of woodlands of river red gum, including swamp woodlands bordering floodplains, and areas dominated by exotic species, such as European ash and willow. It regularly inhabits degraded patches of forest where the understory has been cleared, including recently burned areas, and modified habitats, such as lightly-timbered farming and grazing areas, roadside reserves, bushland remnants in towns and cities, and suburban parks and gardens with trees and grass, but without dense shrubbery.

The noisy miner has benefited from the thinning of woodland on rural properties, heavy grazing that removes the understory, fragmentation of woodland that increases the percentage of edge habitat, and urban landscaping practices that increase open eucalypt environments. It has been described as a &#x27;reverse keystone&#x27; species, as it is colonising an ever-increasing range of human-dominated habitats, and aggressively excluding smaller bird species from urban environments. This phenomenon has been also observed in rural areas. A field study across the South West Slopes of New South Wales showed that the noisy miner&#x27;s presence corresponded with reduced numbers of insectivorous birds, such as fantails, whistlers, the restless flycatcher (&quot;Myiagra inquieta&quot;), and other honeyeater species, and that this decrease was most marked in sites with better access to water and nutrients. While it has been hypothesised that the proliferation of large-flowering grevillea cultivars has contributed to the abundance of noisy miners, recent research has identified the proliferation of lightly treed, open areas, and the presence of eucalypt species as the most significant factors in the population increase. Large-flowered grevillea hybrids, such as Grevillea &#x27;Robyn Gordon&#x27;, can benefit the noisy miner, in that an abundance of resources is usually dominated by larger, aggressive honeyeaters, and a continuous nectar source could provide an advantage for the non-migratory species. A field study in box-ironbark country in central Victoria found that noisy miner numbers were correlated with the occurrence of yellow gum (&quot;Eucalyptus leucoxylon&quot;), which reliably produces flowers (and nectar) each year. The abundance of the noisy miner is primarily determined by habitat structure.

While the range of the noisy miner has not significantly expanded, the density of the population within that range has substantially increased. High densities of noisy miners are regularly recorded in forests with thick understory in southern Queensland, or more from the forest/agricultural land edge. Many of these sites have extensive road networks used for forest management, and picnic areas and walking tracks for recreational use, and it has been found that these cleared spaces play a role in the abundance of noisy miners in the forest. There is evidence to suggest that higher road densities correspond with higher noisy miner population levels. Field work in Victoria showed that noisy miners infiltrated anywhere from into remnant woodland from the edges, with greater penetration occurring in less densely forested areas. This has implications for the size of woodland habitat needed to contain miner-free areas—around . Revegetation projects restoring buloke woodland, a species of she-oak integral to the survival of the red-tailed black cockatoo (&quot;Calyptorynchus banksii&quot;), have been interplanted with a nurse species, usually fast-growing eucalypts. Noisy miner populations were more likely in those buloke woodlands where eucalypts had been planted at densities of up to 16 per hectare (6.4 per acre). The presence of noisy miners was accompanied by a substantial difference in number and types of other birds found in the woodland.

== Behaviour ==

===Social organisation===
The noisy miner is a species, and the birds are rarely seen singly or in twos; they forage, move and roost in colonies that can consist of several hundred birds
Within a colony, a male bird will occupy an &#x27;activity space&#x27;, which will overlap with the activity spaces of other males. Males with overlapping activity spaces form associations called &#x27;coteries&#x27;, usually consisting of 10 to 25 birds. Coteries are the most stable unit within the colony. The birds also form temporary flocks when engaged in the same activity. These flocks, called &#x27;coalitions&#x27;, usually comprise five to eight birds, although coalitions of up to 40 birds can occur when mobbing a potential predator. Membership of the coalition changes frequently as individuals leave the group as it passes beyond the boundary of their activity space, or the activity ends or changes, as when the breeding season begins. Females use activity spaces that overlap with those of male birds, but not other females, so that females will join coalitions with males in their area, but only rarely will there be more than one female in the coalition. The exclusivity of female activity spaces leads to young females being driven out of the colony in which they were born, and also makes it difficult for them to gain a place in a new colony. A study of banded nestlings that survived in one colony until the next breeding season, found that they were all male birds, suggesting that all female nestlings had died or left the colony. Emigration of males does not seem to occur until the population density of the colony reaches a critical level.

Looking after the young is communal, with males of the coterie bringing food to the nestlings and removing faecal sacs. Communal feeding increases after fledging, when males from nearby coteries may even bring food to the young birds, if not driven off. Roosting is usually communal, with two to six adults and juveniles roosting in contact with each other, usually near the end of a hanging branch up to above ground, within their activity space. They select a new site each evening, often selecting and rejecting several sites, and engaging in aggressive calling and chasing as other birds attempt to join the group. They are often the last birds to roost at night, but appear to sleep soundly, undisturbed by torchlight. Noisy miners drink together at the edge of lakes and dams, and from cattle troughs, often perching on a submerged branch. They bathe by diving head first into water and, when almost totally submerged, flapping their wings vigorously and ducking their heads under the water. They shake excess water off and then fly to a nearby branch to preen. They have been observed using rain- or dew-soaked foliage to bathe, and in dry weather will dust-bathe in dry soil or fine litter, such as grass clippings. Bathing is communal, with birds stimulated to participate by observing others. They are occasionally observed anting.

====Flock behaviour====

The noisy miner engages in most activities in a group. Roosting, foraging, preening, bathing and dust-bathing or anting are communal activities. Dawn song is a communal chorus, particularly during the breeding season. The communal interaction is facilitated by ritualised displays that have been categorised as flight displays, postural displays, and facial displays. In &#x27;long flight&#x27; displays, initiated by either male or female birds, groups of up to twenty birds from more than one coterie fly about above the canopy for distances of up to from the colony, constantly calling and not returning to the colony for about twenty minutes. As they return, the remaining birds show signs of agitation, and sometimes fly up to join them. The &#x27;short flight&#x27; display is performed by the male, and may be analogous to the territorial advertising displays of other birds. In a ritualised movement, the noisy miner flies out from a perch across an open area, in a rhythmic undulating pattern, usually calling in flight. At the end of the clearing it turns on an upward swoop and flies silently back to a perch near the starting point. The &#x27;head-up flight&#x27; is performed by the female during the nesting period, and may function to attract male helpers. In its most intense form the body and tail are held almost vertically, with legs dangling, and the head held up and back. It is performed by the female when she is selecting the nest site, and when carrying nest-building material, and probably has the function of indicating the location of the nest to other group members.
Postural displays include tall and low poses, pointing, open-bill and wing-waving. The &#x27;tall posture&#x27; is used when in close contact with another bird and is a mild threat. The bird holds itself upright with neck and legs stretched, and it faces the other bird. The &#x27;low posture&#x27; is a submissive gesture; the bird sits low on a perch with legs obscured by fluffed feathers, and often faces away from the other bird. Fledglings threatened by adult birds will adopt a low posture and open their bill widely. &#x27;Pointing&#x27; is a threat display where the bird stretches out horizontally, with feathers sleeked and the bill pointed at the target of the aggression. A bill snap will sometimes accompany pointing. An &#x27;open-bill display&#x27; is used by subordinates in encounters between two birds, and by a female on the nest when other birds approach. The &#x27;trident bill display&#x27; involves a fully open bill with the tongue raised and protruding, and is a higher-intensity submissive display. &#x27;Wing-waving&#x27; is often performed at the same time as an open-bill display. The wings are flexed and held slightly away from the body, and flapped out and up around three to six times. Wing-waving may be accompanied by a yammer call. &#x27;Eagle&#x27; displays involve holding the wings and tail spread out, in either a vertical or horizontal position.

Eye displays are made by exposing or covering the bare yellow patch behind the eye—when the feathers are completely sleeked the entire patch is visible, and when they are fluffed the patch is hidden. Eye displays are used in conjunction with postural displays, with the yellow patch fully displayed by dominant birds using threat postures, and immature birds tending to reduce the size of the eye-patch when under attack from other members of the coterie.

On occasion early in the breeding season, mass displays erupt, where twenty or thirty birds perform the various wing-spreading displays, short flights, and constant calling. Displaying birds are attacked by others, and groups of silent but agitated birds watch the interactions. Mass displays are more common in the early morning, can last for up to 40 minutes, and seem to be a combination of sexual and agonistic behaviour.

A &#x27;corroboree&#x27; (from the word for a ceremonial meeting of Aboriginal Australians) is a group display, where birds converge on adjacent branches and simultaneously pose hunchbacked, giving wing-waving and open-bill displays, and the yammer call. A corroboree occurs when birds meet after a change in the social environment, such as a bird returning after an absence, or the repulsion of an intruder, or the coming together of different coteries. The corroboree appears to have a bonding function, and may involve all members of a colony.

====Agonistic behaviour====
Described as &quot;always at war with others of the feathered kind&quot; in early notes, the noisy miner is one of the most aggressive of the honeyeaters. Much of the activity within a noisy miner colony is agonistic with chasing, pecking, fighting, scolding, and mobbing occurring frequently throughout the day. The birds unite to attack predators and to defend the colony area against all other species of birds; the species is also highly aggressive intraspecifically.

Female noisy miners are aggressive towards each other, and one cause of a male-biased sex-ratio in colonies may be the females&#x27; greater intolerance for each other, driving immatures out of the colony and preventing the immigration of new females. Aggression at the nest is common between males. Adult males begin attacking juveniles when they are around 11 weeks old, and attackers can include males that previously cared for the fledgling. Adult females are less aggressive towards young birds, although mothers do occasionally attack their own offspring, and infanticide has been recorded. There is little male to female aggression other than the &#x27;driving flights&#x27; that form part of the mating ritual. In direct attacks on young birds, pecks are directed at the eye-patch. Agonistic behaviour has been observed among nestlings, with aggression intensifying after fledging and at times resulting in the death of a sibling.

The noisy miner colony unites to mob inter-specific intruders and predators. The noisy miner will approach the threat closely and point, expose eye patches, and often bill-snap. Five to fifteen birds will fly around the intruder, some birds diving at it and either pulling away or striking the intruder. The mobbing continues until the intruder remains still, as with a tawny frogmouth (&quot;Podargus strigoides&quot;), or it leaves the area. Mobbing of snakes and goannas is particularly intense, and most species of bird, even non-predators, entering the territory are immediately chased. The noisy miner has been recorded attacking an Australian owlet-nightjar (&quot;Aegotheles cristatus&quot;) during the day, grebes, herons, ducks and cormorants on lakes at the edge of territories, crested pigeons (&quot;Ocyphaps lophotes&quot;), pardalotes, and rosellas. Non-predatory mammals such as bats, cattle, sheep, and wallabies are also attacked, though less vigorously than birds.

Noisy miner attacks are not limited to chasing the intruder, and aggressive incidents often result in the death of the trespasser. Reports include those of two noisy miners repeatedly pecking a house sparrow (&quot;Passer domesticus&quot;) at the base of its skull and killing it in six minutes; one noisy miner grasping a striated pardalote (&quot;Pardalotus striatus&quot;) by the wing, while another pecked it on the head until it died; and a sacred kingfisher (&quot;Todiramphus sanctus&quot;) being chased and harassed for over five hours, and then found dead with a fractured skull.

====Response to threats====
Noisy miners make louder alarm calls in noisier sections of urban environments, such as main roads. The most common initial response to alarm calls is to stay in the area and scan for threats, rather than withdraw. A study conducted in Melbourne and a nearby rural area found that noisy miners in urban areas were less likely to take flight, and when they did they flew shorter distances. It is unclear whether this is an adaptation or that bolder miners had been the ones to settle in the city. A field study in Canberra found that superb fairywrens (&quot;Malurus cyaneus&quot;) that lived in areas frequented by noisy miners recognised miner alarm calls and took flight, and had learnt to ignore their non-alarm calls, while those that live in areas not frequented by noisy miners did not respond to miner alarm calls. This suggests that the species has adapted and learnt to discriminate and respond to another species&#x27; vocalisations.

=== Breeding ===
The noisy miner does not use a stereotyped courtship display; displays can involve &#x27;driving&#x27;, where the male jumps or flies at the female from away, and if she moves away he pursues her aggressively. The female may perform a &#x27;bowed-wing display&#x27;, where the wings and tail are spread and quivered, with the wings arched and the head pointing down. The male may adopt a vertical or horizontal &#x27;eagle display&#x27;, with wings and tail spread wide and held still for several seconds. Copulation is frequent and conspicuous, with both males and females copulating with several birds, while other members of the colony display or otherwise interfere with the mating pair. Copulation usually occurs on larger, exposed branches close to the nest site and can occur at any time of the day, although slightly more often between 11:00 and 13:00, when communal activities are less frequent. The frenzied courtship activity had led to speculation that the female mates promiscuously to recruit males to help care for the young, but recent genetic testing shows that 96.5% of noisy miner broods result from monogamous mating and that multiple paternity is rare. An observation of banded birds noted that while females copulated repeatedly, it was always with the same male. Mate switching between broods is uncommon, with pairs staying together over several years.
The noisy miner breeds all year long, with most activity from July through November, though the peak period is subject to seasonal variations, with sharp peaks in laying activity when conditions are particularly favourable for raising young. The nest is built in prickly or leafy trees, and the noisy miner is often recorded nesting in eucalypts, and also in wattles, &quot;Araucaria&quot;, &quot;Banksia&quot;, &quot;Bursaria&quot;, &quot;Hibiscus&quot;, mistletoe, &quot;Melaleuca&quot;, &quot;Pittosporum&quot;, &quot;Schinus&quot;, and jacaranda. It seems to prefer moderately dense foliage for nesting, often near the end of drooping horizontal branches. Support for the nest may be the primary criterion of a suitable nest site, rather than characteristics of the vegetation or location. The female alone builds the nest, which is deep and cup-shaped, woven of twigs and grasses with other plant material, animal hair and spider webs. Occasionally, the nest will include man-made materials such as twine, scraps of material, and tissue paper. It is lined with wool, hair, feathers, flowers or plant down, and padded with a circular mat woven from fibres pulled from the cocoons of the processional caterpillar. The female noisy miner walks around on the ground close to the nest site, picking up material. She gathers material from disused nests of other birds, or dismantles its most recent nest to build a new one. The female completes the nest in five or six days. On average, nests have an external diameter of and an external depth of . The internal depth of the nest is around .
Eggs vary greatly in size, shape and markings, but are generally elongated ovals; white to cream or pinkish or buff coloured; freckled, spotted or blotched with reddish brown to chestnut or a purplish red, sometimes with underlying markings of violet or purplish grey. The clutch consists of two to four eggs. Incubation is by the female only, and the incubation period is around sixteen days. Hatching is asynchronous, with up to six days being recorded between the hatching of the first and last chicks in a clutch. Young are naked at hatching, and develop a cover of down within two to three days. The fledging period is around sixteen days, and young begin to find food for themselves between twenty-six and thirty days after fledging, but are still regularly fed by adults to thirty-five days. The young leave the nest before they are fully fledged, and only able to fly downwards, and scramble up. They do not go far from the nest, return to it at night, and take some weeks to completely leave the nest. Many fledglings are found on the ground and in low shrubs during this period, where they continue to be cared for until they can make their way up into the trees. These birds are often mistakenly &#x27;rescued&#x27;. The fledglings seek out siblings if separated, and huddle together for up to three weeks after fledging.

The noisy miner has some of the largest group sizes of any communally breeding bird, with up to twenty males and one female attending a single brood. Only males help with a nest, and while many birds may be associated with a particular brood, some males devote all their time to a single nest, while others spread their helping efforts across five or six nests. Behavioural evidence and genetic testing indicate that helpers are male offspring of the breeding pair, or full siblings of the male parent. Males nearly always bring food to the nestling singly, and if several arrive at once, one will pass food to a nestling while the others wait. The female leaves the nest quickly when a male bird arrives, and never takes food from one of the helpers. Communal feeding of the young increases after fledging, and the young beg for food with constant &#x27;chip chip&#x27; calls and gaping mouths. The female rarely feeds the young birds after they have fledged.

====Nest predation====
Cooperative breeding has been described as a strategy for decreasing nest predation, although one study found no relationship between the number of helpers visiting a nest site and its success or failure. Noisy miners were seen to have a range of strategies to increase their breeding success, including multiple broods, laying eggs early in the season, nesting low in the canopy and group mobbing of predators; these measures did not guarantee against nest failure, due to the diversity of potential predators in the noisy miner&#x27;s open woodland habitat.

=== Feeding ===

The noisy miner primarily eats nectar, fruit, and insects, and occasionally it feeds on small reptiles or amphibians. It is both arboreal and terrestrial, feeding in the canopy of trees, on trunks and branches, and on the ground. It forages within the colony&#x27;s territory throughout the year, usually in groups of five to eight birds, although hundreds may gather at a stand of flowering trees, such as banksia. The noisy miner collects nectar directly from flowers, hanging upside down or straddling thin branches acrobatically to access the nectar; it takes fruit from trees or fallen on the ground; gleans or hawks for invertebrates; and picks through leaf litter for insects. It has been recorded turning over the dried droppings of emu (&quot;Dromaius novaehollandiae&quot;) and eastern grey kangaroo (&quot;Macropus giganteus&quot;), searching for insects.
In a study of birds foraging in suburban gardens, the noisy miner was seen to spend more time in banksia, grevillea and eucalypt species, and when in flower, callistemon, than in other plants including exotics. Most time was spent gleaning the foliage of eucalypts, and noisy miners were significantly more abundant in sites where eucalypts were present. The noisy miner can meet most of its nutritional needs from manna, honeydew, and lerp gathered from the foliage of eucalypts. Lower numbers of noisy miner were recorded at banksias and grevilleas than other large honeyeaters, such as little wattlebird (&quot;Anthochaera chrysoptera&quot;) and red wattlebird (&quot;Anthochaera carunculata&quot;).

Detailed studies of the diet of the noisy miner record it eating a range of foods including: spiders; insects (leaf beetles, ladybirds, stink bugs, ants, moth and butterfly larvae); nectar (from &quot;Jacaranda mimosifolia&quot;, &quot;Erythrina variegata&quot;, &quot;Lagunaria patersonia&quot;, &quot;Callistemon salignus&quot;, &quot;Callistemon viminalis&quot;, eucalypts Argyle apple, sugar gum, yellow gum, grey ironbark, and grey gum, &quot;Banksia ericifolia&quot;, &quot;B. integrifolia&quot;, &quot;B. serrata&quot;, &quot;Grevillea aspleniifolia&quot;, &quot;G. banksii&quot;, &quot;G. hookeriana&quot;, &quot;G. juniperina&quot;, &quot;G. rosmarinifolia&quot;, and flowering quince); seeds from oats, wheat and pepper tree; fruit from saltbush, mistletoe and crabapple; frogs and skinks; and other matter, such as bread, pieces of meat and cheese, and food scraps.

In the first study to demonstrate different learning techniques in a single species, the noisy miner was found to employ different cognitive strategies, depending upon the resource it was foraging. When searching for nectar, which does not move but is readily depleted, the noisy miner uses a spatial memory-based strategy, identifying characteristics of the environment—a strategy that is efficient in new environments and is not affected by changes in the bird&#x27;s activities. When searching for invertebrates, it appears to employ a different strategy based on learned rules of insect movement (they improve at finding invertebrates with practice). The two different strategies imply the existence of adapted cognitive mechanisms, capable of responding appropriately to different foraging contexts.

==Conservation status==
Abundant throughout its significant range, the noisy miner is considered of least concern for conservation, and its extreme population densities in some areas actually constitute a threat to other species. The strong correlation between the presence of noisy miners and the absence of avian diversity has been well documented. The role played by the noisy miner in the steep decline of many woodland birds, its impact on endangered species with similar foraging requirements, and the level of leaf damage leading to die-back that accompanies the exclusion of insectivorous birds from remnant woodlands, means that any strategy to restore avian diversity will need to take account of the management of noisy miner populations. Some habitat restoration and revegetation projects have inadvertently increased the problem of the noisy miner by establishing the open eucalypt habitat that they prefer. A focus of many regeneration projects has been the establishing of habitat corridors that connect patches of remnant forest, and the use of eucalypts as fast-growing nurse species. Both practices have sound ecological value, but allow the noisy miner to proliferate, so conservation efforts are being modified by planting a shrubby understory with the eucalypts, and avoiding the creation of narrow protrusions, corners or clumps of trees in vegetation corridors. A field study conducted in the Southern Highlands found that noisy miners tended to avoid areas dominated by wattles, species of which in the study area had bipinnate leaves. Hence the authors proposed that revegetation projects include at least 15% &quot;Acacia&quot; species with bipinnate leaves if possible, as well as shrubby understory plants.

Translocation of noisy miners is unlikely to be a solution to their overabundance in remnant habitats. In a Victorian study where birds were banded and relocated, colonies moved into the now unpopulated area, but soon returned to their original territories. The translocated birds did not settle in a new territory. They were not assimilated into resident populations of miners, but instead wandered up to from the release point, moving through apparently suitable habitat occupied by other miners—at least for the first 50 days following translocation. Two birds with radio tracking devices travelled back to their site of capture. Although noisy miners are protected across Australia, and a permit is required to cull them, culling has been proposed as the most humane and practical method of reducing their impact, particularly where combined with rehabilitation of the habitat to suit a wider variety of bird life. An unsanctioned cull took place on private rural property over 1991 and 1992, which, combined with extensive and dense plantings of native trees, reportedly resulted in an increase in species diversity.

==Alcatel==
This lists Alcatel switches before the merger with Lucent Technologies.
* 1000 E10 / S12 (during the 1990s the E10 and S12 systems were converted into a single product line)
* E10 versions:
** E10A (E10N3)- Original switch introduced in 1972 one of the earliest deployments of TDM switching in the world.
** E10B (E10N1)- Major revision in the 1980s which eventually saw ISDN capabilities. Common in France, Ireland, China, India and elsewhere.
** E10B3 - major revision in the 1990s. Common in France &amp; Ireland
** OCB-283 - Another name for more modern versions of E10B and often the name used in India to distinguish it from older versions.
** E10-MT formerly Thomson MT-25 found mostly in France, and MT20 too.
** E10-Five E10B adapted for the North American environment as a class-5 switch.
** E10S satellite switching unit.
** E10-MSC mobile switching center for GSM and other protocols.
** 1000 (MM) E10 - Evolved switch for multimedia / broadband and IP network environments. Provides POTS/ISDN and next generation services.
* S12 - Formerly known as &quot;System 12&quot; or the ITT 1240 or acquired by Alcatel when it purchased ITT&#x27;s assets in Europe. This is a very widely deployed switching system found in Italy, Germany, Belgium, Australia and many other countries around the world. There are a large number of versions of this type of switch ranging from local, to transit to international gateway to mobile switching centers. The line was converted with the E10 family of exchanges.

== Hasler ==
List of the mainly electro mechanical switching systems from Hasler AG Bern, which were used in public telephone network in Switzerland for many decades. Hasler AG finally merged into Ascom in 1987.

* HS 25 (modified from the Ericsson OL-100 system with double relays and 25-point selector (Ericsson license), mainly used for small villages and towns in the counties)
* HS 31 (new developed register system, introduced in 1931, based on a new flat type relay and a 100-point two-motion selector, suitable for small and large exchanges)
* HS 52 (new developed register system, introduced in 1953, based on a new 120-point selector, which was in fact a 4 x 30-point uniselector with 2 x 4 brushes offset by 180°, no zero position)
* HS 52 A (new variant of HS 52 from 1973 with an almost full-electronic register evaluation unit called &#x27;Umrechner&#x27;, not processor based but centralized programmable by diode matrices)
* HS 52 B (Processor controlled multiregister system with identifier, but the relay and selector based coupling stage was maintained from the original HS 52 system)
* HS 68 (prototype of a semi-electronic switching system, based on adhesive reed-relays in the coupling stage. One sample system built but not pursued because of the arising PTT IFS-project)
* AXE-10 (digital switching system from Ericsson, initially built and adapted for the Swiss market by Ascom Hasler under Ericsson license)

The last HS 52 A and B exchanges were in operation until the end of 1997. The personnel-intensive electro mechanical systems were shut down prematurely then, due to the imminent opening of the telecoms market in Switzerland. The last AXE-10 local subscriber were migrated to VoIP in June 2020.

==North Electric (Galion, Ohio)==
* CX &quot;All-Relay Exchanges:
(CX evolved from the &quot;Automanual&quot; system designed by Edward Clements: &quot;Clement eXchange&quot; or &quot;Community eXchange&quot;)
** CX30 (30 line)
** CX60 (60 line)
** CX100 (100 line)
** CX200 (&quot;broadspan&quot; up to 200 lines)
** CX1000 (large CX expandable to 10,000 lines)
*MCX A version of the CX product line designed by F.R. McBerty after leaving Western Electric/Bell Labs and becoming President of North Electric.
The McBerty design used an early &quot;wire spring relay&quot; and welded piano wire interconnections rather than complex wire multiples. The system never achieved the reputation of the CX product due to problems with poor contact pressure in the interconnection relays. Despite its much lower cost of production and installation, the level of maintenance required to keep these systems on good order doomed this variation of the CX design.
* DSS1 (North&#x27;s first digital switch for local exchanges)
This later was renamed the ITT 1210 product upon purchase of North electric by ITT.
* DSS2
* ETS4 (Large #4A-ETS class toll switch based on Ericsson &quot;code switch&quot;)
* NTS4E (4-wire toll switch with Xbar switches and &quot;Omni&quot; processors)
* NX1 (Family NX1A, B, C &amp; D; All based on Ericsson By-Path Crossbar license)
L.M. Ericsson purchased North Electric in the early 1950s and brought this Swedish design to North where it was reworked to conform to U.S. telecommunications requirements.
** NX1D (Final production version)
** NX1E (NX-1D with OMNI Processor for line/directory, trunk and number-group translation services)
The NX-1E was not a SPC switch, rather it was a conventional path controlled switching matrix with electronic processors (computers) replacing the control, route selection and translation (directory number to line ID) functions.
* NX2 (Family Small 90–1800 line CDO Xbar)
** NX2 (Original design 1959–1960)

* Stored Program (SP) (Electronic Stored Program Control using mini-bar switches)
** SP1 2-Wire (Local)
*** The SP1 processor was constructed using Small Scale Integration (SSI) Diode Transistor (DTL) Logic. Two types of memory was used. Processor read/write scratch memory (called CALL STORE) was implemented using a magnetic core variant called Ferrite Sheet. Program and Data Store (used to store Software and infrequently changed data) was implemented using a technology called piggy back twistor - in modern parlance a write once, read many times non-volatile memory system). As was the case with the #1ESS systems, processors and memory were duplicated with automatic comparison of processing results and automatic recovery in the event that a mismatch was discovered. It did not however support the complex recovery mechanism provided in the #1ESS where a processor from one half of the complex could be connected to a mix of memory (both call store and program store) modules from both halves of the complex in order to achieve a working combination. Processor diagnostics would generally narrow a problem down to a board or three. Connection was made via a crossbar switch.
*** A SP1 2-wire variant was also available that provided Centrex services.
*** A version of the SP-1 ESS that could provide both 2 &amp; 4 wire services was also built. The first instance was installed in Vegreville Alberta in 1976 or 1977.
** SP1 4-Wire (Toll)
*** The first example of this switch was installed for Bell Canada, in Thunder Bay, Ontario in late 1973. It provided toll services for North Western Ontario and CAMA (Centralized Message Accounting) for the City of Thunder Bay. The City of Thunder Bay which operated its own Telephone Company installed a number of 2W SP1s.
** SP1E (used NT40 processor which was later the first processor system for the DMS-100 Family of switches)
* NE-1ESS (Northern Electric version of Western Electric) #1ESS {licensee} 
** Bell Canada operated NE-1ESS 2 wire switches (some of which also provided Centrex services) in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal. A 4W NE-1ESS was installed in Thunder Bay to provide telephone switching services (SAGE and AUTOVON)for USA and Canadian bases in that part of North America. The #1ESS was implemented using discrete diode transistor logic. A typical circuit board would implement a single 4 input &quot;NAND&quot; gate. Of the myriad of cards in the system - many were dedicated diagnostic gates. The diagnostic software had a very high (95% +) success rate identifying a single failing card. The success rate dropped quickly thereafter. Drifting Voltage Regulator cards caused a lot of angst.

<doc id="737787" wikidata="Q833508" url="?curid=737787" title="Spectacled eider">
<text>The spectacled eider (pronounced ) (Somateria fischeri) is a large sea duck that breeds on the coasts of Alaska and northeastern Siberia.

The spectacled eider is slightly smaller than the common eider at 52–57 cm (20–22 inches) in length. The male is unmistakable with its black body, white back, and yellow-green head with the large circular white eye patches which give the species its name. The drake&#x27;s call is a weak crooning, and the female&#x27;s a harsh croak.

The female is a rich brown bird, but can still be readily distinguished from all ducks except other eider species on size and structure. The paler goggles are visible with a reasonable view and clinch identification. Immature birds and eclipse adult drakes are similar to the female.

The binomial commemorates the German scientist Johann Fischer von Waldheim.

==Distribution==
Spectacled eiders occur along the coast of Alaska and easternmost Russia and into the Bering Sea. There are two breeding populations in Alaska and one in Russia. Historically there were more breeding individuals in Alaska but more recently the Russian population is much larger. The United States population is an estimated 3,000–4,000 nesting pairs

The spectacled eider molts at sea anywhere from from the shore and north of 63°N. Since they are rarely seen outside of their breeding grounds, their wintering grounds in the Bering Sea were not known until recently with the help of satellite telemetry in 1995.

==Conservation status==
The spectacled eider was listed as Threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1993 but remains listed as under Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. The Red List keep the listing in this category because the spectacled eider does not meet the range size criterion or the population trend criterion. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service originally listed the spectacled eider as Threatened because of a more than 96% drop in breeding population size in Alaska. With this listing and protection from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1991, it is illegal to harvest any individuals through either sport or subsistence hunting.

==Life history==
As a diving duck, the spectacled eider forages for food in the water by swimming and diving underwater. It is believed to be able to remain submerged longer than most diving ducks and mostly feeds on mollusks while at sea and aquatic insects, crustaceans, and plant material while on the breeding grounds.

Breeding pairs are formed in the wintering grounds before spring migration through male displays and female selection. Once at the nesting sites, females build a nest close to the pond on a raised ridge, called a hummock, that are lined with plant materials and feathery down. Nests may be reused for future years. Females are the sole incubators and caretakers of the eggs and chicks and will lay on average three to six eggs with an olive buff color. Eggs are incubated for 24 days and chicks leave the nest shortly after hatching to be led to the water by the female. The female protects the chicks but they do find all their own food. Spectacled eiders have a fairly rapid development to be such large birds; it only takes about 53 days or less before they can fly.

==Threats==
There are multiple factors that threaten spectacled eider populations in the future including climate change and habitat loss. Historically their range was much larger than just the coast of Alaska and Russia. It also used to extend from the Nushagak Peninsula to Barrow and almost all the way to the Canadian border. Since spectacled eiders live in frigid areas that are not easily accessible to humans their main habitat loss has been a result of climate change. A future threats to their habitat is the possible development of oil and gas drilling near Teshekpuk Lake which has well been established as a globally significant important bird area.

<doc id="737794" wikidata="Q336321" url="?curid=737794" title="Hymne monégasque">
<text>&quot;Hymne Monégasque&quot; (; ), also known as (&quot;The March of Monaco&quot;), is the national anthem of Monaco. It was originally adopted in 1848 with French lyrics by Théophile Bellando de Castro and music by Bellando and Castil-Blaze. The current official lyrics, which are in Monégasque, were written in 1931 by Louis Notari, while the current musical arrangement was composed in 1914 by Léon Jehin.

==History==
Under the reign of Prince Florestan I who become the Monegasque sovereign in 1841, the Principality experienced an unstable internal situation. As early as 1821, repeated troubles broke out in Menton encouraged by agents of the Kingdom of Sardinia, abusively interpreting the treaty of Stupinigi signed on November 8, 1817, as a treaty submitting the Prince of Monaco and the Principality to a foreign authority. In order to respond to the broadcast in Monaco of seditious songs imported from the County of Nice, Monégasque lawyer Théophile Bellando de Castro wrote French lyrics and composed the music of the first version of the &quot;Hymne Monégasque&quot; in 1841 as a tribute of loyalty to the Prince and his family. Later, French musicologist Castil-Blaze modified the melody and made several other minor changes. In 1848, the National Guard, created by Prince Florestan, adopted Bellando&#x27;s song, and it became the &quot;March of the National Loyalists&quot;. In 1896, a new arrangement for piano composed by Monégasque composer Charles Albrecht was published by Tihebaux in Paris and titled &quot;Air National de Monaco&quot;. In 1897, Decourcelle, a publisher in Nice, printed a new version of Albrecht&#x27;s composition numbered 429 and titled &quot;Hymne National de Monaco&quot;.

Years later, Monégasque musician François Bellini orchestrated the song by Albrecht; this new arrangement for a trio was judged to be too long for people in 1900 and ceased being played. The modern version was created by French composer Léon Jehin in 1914 and was played for the first time during the 25th anniversary of the beginning Prince Albert&#x27;s reign. Finally, in 1931, Monégasque poet Louis Notari wrote the lyrics in the Monégasque language.

Fernand Bertrand of the Comité National des Traditions Monégasques (National Committee of Monégasque Traditions) later simplified the Monégasque lyrics while retaining the meaning, because people were finding it difficult to sing the first verse, which had a fast rhythm. Bertrand also noted that the second verse was no longer being played or sung. This is the version currently taught in schools to children and that almost all the population sings today.

== Lyrics ==
Only the Monegasque lyrics are official, reportedly dating back to a request from the Prince. The national anthem is rarely sung aloud in Monaco, except at official occasions.

=== Current lyrics ===
Sometimes, a version of these lyrics is sung that does not include the verse in the middle, which instead is left as an instrumental interlude.

<text>1969 is a 1988 American drama film written and directed by Ernest Thompson and starring Robert Downey Jr., Kiefer Sutherland and Winona Ryder. The original music score is composed by Michael Small. The film deals with the Vietnam War and the resulting social tensions between those who support and oppose the war in small-town America.

==Plot==
Two boys, Ralph and Scott, hitchhike home from college, arriving on Easter morning and shout their greetings across the glen to their families during a lakeside Easter Sunrise service, much to the amusement of Ralph&#x27;s younger sister, Beth, and mother, Ev, and embarrassment of Scott&#x27;s mother, Jessie, and father, Cliff. Later that day, they drive Scott&#x27;s older brother, Alden, who is shipping off to Vietnam, to the bus depot; Alden and Scott fight when Scott accuses the Marine of being afraid to go to Vietnam. Their father arrives, wondering what is going on.

A few weeks later, Scott and Ralph again return home from college to attend Beth&#x27;s high school graduation, where they learn that Ralph has flunked out of college (thus making him eligible to be drafted). The boys decide to spend the summer on the road, living out of their van, experiencing all the freedom that the counterculture has to offer. Eventually, they arrive back at their hometown in the middle of its summer festival, where they learn that Alden has disappeared and is considered MIA. Ralph and Scott hatch a plan to steal their files from the local draft board office, but they are caught, and Ralph is arrested.

Scott is now determined to avoid Ralph&#x27;s fate, planning to head to Canada to avoid the draft. Scott invites Beth to travel with him on his trip, and to stay away until the end of the war. Admitting their attraction to each other, they make love in the van. Later, they decide to visit Ralph in jail to tell him they are leaving. Ralph reveals in a very sarcastic tone that he actually wants to go to Vietnam. When he learns that his friend and his sister have had sexual relations, he disowns Scott and ignores Beth.

Scott and Beth get to the Canada–US border and are about to cross but have a change of heart and head back to Maryland. When they get home, they learn of Alden&#x27;s death in the line of duty. Scott leads a huge march downtown in the midst of the funeral, where Ralph is released from jail and the friends are reunited. The film ends with a narration by Scott, announcing that his family and friends later join hundreds of thousands of other Americans towards Washington, D.C. to protest the Vietnam War.

==Cast==
* Robert Downey Jr. as Ralph Carr
* Kiefer Sutherland as Scott Denny
* Bruce Dern as Cliff Denny
* Mariette Hartley as Jessie Denny
* Winona Ryder as Beth Carr
* Joanna Cassidy as Ev Carr

==Critical reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 55% based on reviews from 11 critics.

Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;[The film] &quot;1969&quot;, the directorial debut of Ernest Thompson, is an aimless drama, its purpose and promise lost in a thicket of false endings and a fog of nostalgia&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described how &quot;Mr. Dern, unusually laconic here, is unexpectedly moving as the character who seems most confused by changing times. &quot;Variety&quot; said, &quot;Affecting memories and good intentions don&#x27;t always add up to good screen stories, and such is the case in &quot;1969&quot;, one of the murkiest reflections on the Vietnam War era yet, notwithstanding good performances all around and bright packaging of Kiefer Sutherland and Robert Downey Jr. in the leads.&quot;

==Box office ==
The film was a disappointment at the box office, grossing only $5,979,011 against a $7 million budget.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s soundtrack consists of original period rock. However, it also includes a notable re-recording of The Youngbloods&#x27; classic hit &quot;Get Together&quot;, performed as a solo by the Youngbloods&#x27; lead singer Jesse Colin Young, as well as a new cover, by The Pretenders, of the 1967 Burt Bacharach/Hal David song &quot;The Windows of the World.&quot;

<doc id="737798" wikidata="Q427071" url="?curid=737798" title="Hydroxyl radical">
<text>The hydroxyl radical, •HO, is the neutral form of the hydroxide ion (HO–). Hydroxyl radicals are highly reactive and consequently short-lived; however, they form an important part of radical chemistry. Most notably hydroxyl radicals are produced from the decomposition of hydroperoxides (ROOH) or, in atmospheric chemistry, by the reaction of excited atomic oxygen with water. It is also an important radical formed in radiation chemistry, since it leads to the formation of hydrogen peroxide and oxygen, which can enhance corrosion and stress corrosion cracking in coolant systems subjected to radioactive environments. Hydroxyl radicals are also produced during UV-light dissociation of H2O2 (suggested in 1879) and likely in Fenton chemistry, where trace amounts of reduced transition metals catalyze peroxide-mediated oxidations of organic compounds.

In organic synthesis hydroxyl radicals are most commonly generated by photolysis of &quot;1-Hydroxy-2(1H)-pyridinethione&quot;.

The hydroxyl radical is often referred to as the &quot;detergent&quot; of the troposphere because it reacts with many pollutants, often acting as the first step to their removal. It also has an important role in eliminating some greenhouse gases like methane and ozone. The rate of reaction with the hydroxyl radical often determines how long many pollutants last in the atmosphere, if they do not undergo photolysis or are rained out. For instance, methane, which reacts relatively slowly with hydroxyl radicals, has an average lifetime of &gt;5 years and many CFCs have lifetimes of 50+ years. Pollutants, such as larger hydrocarbons, can have very short average lifetimes of less than a few hours.

The first reaction with many volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is the removal of a hydrogen atom, forming water and an alkyl radical (R•):
:•HO + RH → H2O + R•
The alkyl radical will typically react rapidly with oxygen forming a peroxy radical:

:R• + O2 → RO2

The fate of this radical in the troposphere is dependent on factors such as the amount of sunlight, pollution in the atmosphere and the nature of the alkyl radical that formed it (See chapters 12 &amp; 13 in External Links &quot;University Lecture notes on Atmospheric chemistry)

== Biological significance ==
Hydroxyl radicals can occasionally be produced as a byproduct of immune action. Macrophages and microglia most frequently generate this compound when exposed to very specific pathogens, such as certain bacteria. The destructive action of hydroxyl radicals has been implicated in several neurological autoimmune diseases such as HIV-associated dementia, when immune cells become over-activated and toxic to neighboring healthy cells.

The hydroxyl radical can damage virtually all types of macromolecules: carbohydrates, nucleic acids (mutations), lipids (lipid peroxidation) and amino acids (e.g. conversion of Phe to m-Tyrosine and o-Tyrosine). The hydroxyl radical has a very short &quot;in vivo&quot; half-life of approximately 10−9 seconds and a high reactivity. This makes it a very dangerous compound to the organism.

Unlike superoxide, which can be detoxified by superoxide dismutase, the hydroxyl radical cannot be eliminated by an enzymatic reaction. Mechanisms for scavenging peroxyl radicals for the protection of cellular structures include endogenous antioxidants such as melatonin and glutathione, and dietary antioxidants such as mannitol and vitamin E.

== Importance in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere ==
The hydroxyl •HO radicals is one of the main chemical species controlling the oxidizing capacity of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, having a major impact on the concentrations and distribution of greenhouse gases and pollutants. It is the most widespread oxidizer in the troposphere, the lowest part of the atmosphere. Understanding •HO variability is important to evaluating human impacts on the atmosphere and climate. The •HO species has a lifetime in the Earth atmosphere of less than one second. Understanding the role of •HO in the oxidation process of methane (CH4) present in the atmosphere to first carbon monoxide (CO) and then carbon dioxide (CO2) is important for assessing the residence time of this greenhouse gas, the overall carbon budget of the troposphere, and its influence on the process of global warming. The lifetime of •HO radicals in the Earth atmosphere is very short, therefore •HO concentrations in the air are very low and very sensitive techniques are required for its direct detection. Global average hydroxyl radical concentrations have been measured indirectly by analyzing methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3) present in the air. The results obtained by Montzka &quot;et al.&quot; (2011) shows that the interannual variability in •HO estimated from CH3CCl3 measurements is small, indicating that global •HO is generally well buffered against perturbations. This small variability is consistent with measurements of methane and other trace gases primarily oxidized by •HO, as well as global photochemical model calculations.

== Astronomical importance ==
=== First detection of interstellar •HO ===

The first experimental evidence for the presence of 18 cm absorption lines of the hydroxyl (•HO) radical in the radio absorption spectrum of Cassiopeia A was obtained by Weinreb et al. (Nature, Vol. 200, pp. 829, 1963) based on observations made during the period October 15–29, 1963.

=== Important subsequent reports of •HO astronomical detections ===

=== Energy levels ===

•HO is a diatomic molecule. The electronic angular momentum along the molecular axis is +1 or -1, and the electronic spin angular momentum S=1/2. Because of the orbit-spin coupling, the spin angular momentum can be oriented in parallel or anti parallel directions to the orbital angular momentum, producing the splitting into Π1/2 and Π3/2 states. The 2Π3/2 ground state of •HO is split by lambda doubling interaction (an interaction between the nuclei rotation and the unpaired electron motion around its orbit). Hyperfine interaction with the unpaired spin of the proton further splits the levels.

=== Chemistry of the molecule •HO ===

In order to study gas phase interstellar chemistry, it is convenient to distinguish two types of interstellar clouds: diffuse clouds, with T=30-100 K, and n=10–1000 cm−3, and dense clouds with T=10-30K and density n=-. Ion chemical routes in both dense and diffuse clouds have been established for some works (Hartquist 1990).

==== &quot;•HO production pathways&quot; ====

The •HO radical is linked with the production of H2O in molecular clouds. Studies of •HO distribution in Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1) suggest that in dense gas, •HO is mainly formed by dissociative recombination of H3O+. Dissociative recombination is the reaction in which a molecular ion recombines with an electron and dissociates into neutral fragments. Important formation mechanisms for •HO are:

H3O+ + e− → •HO + H2 (1a) Dissociative recombination

H3O+ + e− → •HO + •H + •H (1b) Dissociative recombination

HCO2+ + e− → •HO + CO (2a) Dissociative recombination

•O + HCO → •HO + CO (3a) Neutral-neutral

H− + H3O+ → •HO + H2 + •H (4a) Ion-molecular ion neutralization

==== &quot;•HO destruction pathways&quot; ====

Experimental data on association reactions of •H and •HO suggest that radiative association involving atomic and diatomic neutral radicals may be considered as an effective mechanism for the production of small neutral molecules in the interstellar clouds. The formation of O2 occurs in the gas phase via the neutral exchange reaction between •O and •HO, which is also the main sink for •HO in dense regions.

We can see that atomic oxygen takes part both in the production and destruction of •HO, so the abundance of •HO depends mainly on the abundance. Then, important chemical pathways leading from •HO radicals are:

•HO + •O → O2 + •H (1A) Neutral-neutral

•HO + C+ → CO+ + •H (2A) Ion-neutral

•HO + •N → NO + •H (3A) Neutral-neutral

•HO + C → CO + •H (4A) Neutral-neutral

•HO + •H → H2O + photon (5A) Neutral-neutral

==== &quot;Rate constants and relative rates for important formation and destruction mechanisms&quot; ====

Rate constants can be derived from the dataset published on the website . Rate constants have the form:

k(T) = alpha*(T/300)beta*exp(-gamma/T)cm3s−1

The following table has the rate constants calculated for a typical temperature in a dense cloud T=10 K.

Formation rates rix can be obtained using the rate constants k(T) and the abundances of the reactants species C and D:

rix=k(T)ix[C][D]

where [Y] represents the abundance of the specie Y. In this approach, abundances were taken from &quot;The UMIST database for astrochemistry 2006&quot;, and the values are relatives to the H2 density. Following table shows the ratio rix/r1a in order to get a view of the most important reactions.

The results suggest that (1a) reaction is the most prominent reaction in dense clouds. It is in concordance with Harju et al. 2000.

Next table shows the results by doing the same procedure for destruction reaction:

Results shows that, 1A reaction is the main sink for HO in dense clouds.

=== Importance of interstellar •HO observations ===

Discoveries of the microwave spectra of a considerable number of molecules prove the existence of rather complex molecules in the interstellar clouds, and provides the possibility to study dense clouds, which are obscured by the dust they contain. The •HO molecule has been observed in the interstellar medium since 1963 through its 18-cm transitions. In the subsequent years •HO was observed by its rotational transitions at far infrared wavelengths, mainly in the Orion region. Because each rotational level of •HO is split in by lambda doubling, astronomers can observe a wide variety of energy states from the ground state.

==== •HO as a tracer of shock conditions ====

Very high densities are required to thermalize the rotational transitions of •HO, so it is difficult to detect far-infrared emission lines from a quiescent molecular cloud. Even at H2 densities of 106 cm−3, dust must be optically thick at infrared wavelengths. But the passage of a shock wave through a molecular cloud is precisely the process which can bring the molecular gas out of equilibrium with the dust, making observations of far-infrared emission lines possible. A moderately fast shock may produce a transient raise in the •HO abundance relative to hydrogen. So, it is possible that far-infrared emission lines of •HO can be a good diagnostic of shock conditions.

==== In diffuse clouds ====

Diffuse clouds are of astronomical interest because they play a primary role in the evolution and thermodynamics of ISM. Observation of the abundant atomic hydrogen in 21 cm has shown good signal-to-noise ratio in both emission and absorption. Nevertheless, HI observations have a fundamental difficulty when are directed to low mass regions of the hydrogen nucleus, as the center part of a diffuse cloud: Thermal width of hydrogen lines are the same order as the internal velocities&#x27; structures of interest, so clouds components of various temperatures and central velocities are indistinguishable in the spectrum. Molecular lines observations in principle doesn&#x27;t suffer from these problems. Unlike HI, molecules generally have excitation temperature Tex « Tkin, so that emission is very weak even from abundant species. CO and •HO are considered to be the most easily studied candidate molecules. CO has transitions in a region of the spectrum (wavelength &lt; 3 mm) where there are not strong background continuum sources, but •HO has the 18 cm emission, line convenient for absorption observations. Observation studies provide the most sensitive means of detections of molecules with sub thermal excitation, and can give the opacity of the spectral line, which is a central issue to model the molecular region.

Studies based in the kinematic comparison of •HO and HI absorption lines from diffuse clouds are useful in determining their physical conditions, especially because heavier elements provide higher velocity resolution.

==== •HO masers ====
•HO masers, a type of astrophysical maser, were the first masers to be discovered in space and have been observed in more environments than any other type of maser.

In the Milky Way, •HO masers are found in stellar masers (evolved stars), interstellar masers (regions of massive star formation), or in the interface between supernova remnants and molecular material. Interstellar HO masers are often observed from molecular material surrounding ultracompact H II regions (UC H II). But there are masers associated with very young stars that have yet to create UC H II regions. This class of •HO masers appears to form near the edges of very dense material, places where H2O masers form, and where total densities drop rapidly, and UV radiation from young stars can dissociate the H2O molecules. So, observations of •HO masers in these regions, can be an important way to probe the distribution of the important H2O molecule in interstellar shocks at high spatial resolutions.

Application in water purification

Hydroxyl radicals also play a key role in the oxidative destruction of organic pollutants.

<text>Richard Tousey (May 18, 1908 – April 15, 1997) was an American astronomer. He was a pioneer in the observation of the sun from space and took the first photographs of the sun&#x27;s ultraviolet spectrum.

Richard Tousey was born on May 18, 1908, in Somerville, Massachusetts, to Coleman and Adella Hill Tousey. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Tufts University (1928), then MA (1929) and Ph.D.(1933) in physics from Harvard University. His dissertation related to measuring optical properties of fluorite at 1216 angstroms was completed under Theodore Lyman.

Tousey taught and conducted research at Harvard from 1933 to 1936, then Tufts until 1941. Upon invitation by E.O. Hulburt, Tousey joined the Naval Research Laboratory where his initial work focused on night vision. Using captured V-2 rockets made available for research at White Sands Missile Range, he was able to measure the first ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of the sun.

He married Ruth Lowe in 1932 and together they had one daughter, Joanna. The family shared an interest in music and collected musical instruments. They also collected and researched antique silverware and its makers. Richard was a member of the American Silver Guild.

Tousey died of pneumonia on April 15, 1997, at Prince Georges Hospital Center in Maryland.

<text>Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael is a 1990 American comedy drama film that was directed by Jim Abrahams. It stars Winona Ryder and Jeff Daniels.

==Plot==
Dinky Bossetti is a 15-year-old girl who was adopted as a baby and is constantly picked on at school. Dinky&#x27;s antisocial attitude and behavior is caused by her intelligence, her adoptive parents not accepting her for who she is, and being bullied by her peers. Dinky&#x27;s adoptive mother Rochelle is disappointed that her daughter has no interest in &quot;feminine&quot; things, such as makeup and nice clothing. Her adoptive father, Les, passively allows his wife to scold Dinky and send her to various &quot;counselors&quot; who are little more than temporary jailers. Her teachers give her no support when classmates ostracize, taunt, and throw things at her. Dinky enjoys thumbing her nose at her peers and embarrasses Gerald, a cute popular boy, by reading a condescending love poem to him in class.

Dinky is befriended by the new school guidance counselor Elizabeth Zaks, who recognizes her intelligence and spirit. Ms. Zaks tries to encourage Dinky to improve her appearance and get along better with others without compromising her true self. Gerald begins to show interest in Dinky and tries to get other students to stop harassing her, but Dinky takes no notice as she becomes convinced that she is the abandoned daughter of Roxy Carmichael, a former town resident who left for Hollywood and has been invited to return for the dedication of a new municipal building. Dinky becomes fixated on the many similarities she shares with Roxy and questions the townsfolk for memories of her. Dinky is then led to Denton Webb, Roxy&#x27;s old boyfriend. He reveals that he and Roxy secretly had a child before she left town. Dinky&#x27;s questions about Roxy prompt Denton to become obsessed with revisiting his romance, causing him to become more short-tempered and dismissive of his family. Fed up, his wife leaves him and tells him that Roxy never loved him.

Meanwhile, Dinky becomes convinced that when Roxy arrives for the ceremony, she will take Dinky away to a new life. On the day of Roxy&#x27;s arrival, Dinky packs her suitcase and dresses up for the building dedication. At the ceremony, Rochelle reveals that she invited representatives from a boarding school to send Dinky away, but Les finally stands up to his wife and reminds her Dinky is their daughter no matter what. The townspeople eagerly await Roxy&#x27;s arrival and expect her to emerge from a limousine that pulled up to the ceremony. Instead, the townspeople are left with a note explaining that Roxy is unable to attend. Distressed, Dinky runs after the car and Denton finally realizes the reason for Dinky&#x27;s interest in Roxy. He tells her that his child with Roxy was born premature and did not survive, so Dinky is not Roxy&#x27;s child.

Devastated, Dinky is comforted by Gerald and realizes she was chasing a fantasy. She decides to make peace with herself and her life as it is. Meanwhile, Rochelle tears up the boarding school brochures while Denton burns his Roxy memorabilia, hinting at a possible reconciliation with his wife. Dinky returns home where Gerald greets her, saying, &quot;Welcome home, Dinky Bossetti.&quot;

==Production notes==
The setting of the film, Clyde, Ohio, is a real town. However the film features locations in Sandusky, Ohio as well. Located on the shore of Lake Erie.

==Reception==
&quot;Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael&quot; received mixed reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 55% approval rating based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 44 out of 100 based on 19 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

One of the most outspoken detractors of the film was &quot;Variety&quot;, whose comments about it were that &quot;fans of Winona Ryder will definitely want to catch her in an offbeat role as the town rebel in this teen-oriented small-town saga; unfortunately, the rest of the production doesn&#x27;t quite match up.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film 2 stars in his original review, and said that &quot;Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael&quot; contains one small treasure: a perceptive and particular performance by Winona Ryder in the role of a high school outcast&quot;, and that &quot;her work is surrounded by a screenplay so flat-footed that much of our time is spent waiting impatiently for foregone conclusions.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
Thomas Newman composed the original score for the film, which was released on cassette and compact disc by Varèse Sarabande. Although Melissa Etheridge wrote and performed two original songs for the film - &quot;Don&#x27;t Look At Me&quot; and &quot;In Roxy&#x27;s Eyes (I Will Never Be the Same)&quot; - neither is included on the soundtrack album; while the former has never been released, the latter is included on her 1993 album &quot;Yes I Am&quot; as &quot;I Will Never Be the Same&quot;.

<text>Dumb and Dumber is a 1994 American buddy comedy film directed by Peter Farrelly, who cowrote the screenplay with Bobby Farrelly and Bennett Yellin. It is the first installment in the &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; franchise. Starring Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, it tells the story of Lloyd Christmas (Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Daniels), two dumb but well-meaning friends from Providence, Rhode Island, who set out on a cross-country road trip to Aspen, Colorado, to return a briefcase full of money to its owner, thinking it was abandoned as a mistake, though it was actually left as a ransom. Lauren Holly, Karen Duffy, Mike Starr, Charles Rocket, and Teri Garr play supporting roles.

The film was released on December 16, 1994, to mixed reviews from critics. It grossed $247 million at the box office and has since developed a cult following. The success of &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; launched the career of the Farrelly brothers, established the range of the heretofore dramatically acclaimed Daniels as a gifted comedic actor and revitalized his Hollywood career, and solidified Carrey&#x27;s reputation as one of the most prominent actors of the 1990s. The film also spawned an animated TV series, a 2003 prequel, and a 2014 sequel.

==Plot==

Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne are two good-hearted but dimwitted best friends and roommates living in Providence, Rhode Island. Lloyd, a chip-toothed limousine driver, is instantly smitten with his passenger Mary Swanson, who is flying to Aspen, Colorado. She leaves a briefcase in the airport and Lloyd attempts to return it, unaware it contains ransom money she has left for criminals Joe &quot;Mental&quot; Mentalino and J. P. Shay. Her plane has already departed, and Lloyd falls out of the jetway.

Fired for leaving the scene of an accident, Lloyd returns home to learn that Harry, a dog groomer, has also been fired for showing up late to a dog show with the dogs covered in food. Mental and Shay follow Lloyd home, but he and Harry mistake the crooks for debt collectors and flee, returning later to find Harry&#x27;s parakeet has been decapitated. Lloyd convinces Harry that they should return Mary&#x27;s briefcase, and they set off for Aspen in Harry&#x27;s dog-styled van.

In league with Nicholas Andre, a friend of Mary&#x27;s family, Mental poses as a hitchhiker and is picked up by Harry and Lloyd, who annoy him with their childish antics. Stopping for lunch, Mental plans to slip the duo rat poison pills, but they prank him by putting chili peppers in his burger, aggravating his stomach ulcer. Mistaking the pills for his medication, they inadvertently kill him with the poison but continue their trip.

At a gas station, Harry flirts with fellow Aspen-bound driver Beth, and unwittingly saves Lloyd from being assaulted by Sea Bass, a trucker they offended earlier. Police wait to intercept the duo on the road to Colorado, but Lloyd takes a wrong turn and drives all night through Nebraska. Harry gives up on the journey, but Lloyd persuades him to continue after trading their van for a minibike.

The duo arrives in Aspen but cannot find Mary, and a frustrated Harry attacks Lloyd, breaking open the briefcase and discovering the money, which they use on a hotel suite and lavish spending spree. They read in the newspaper that Mary and her family are hosting a charity gala, where a nervous Lloyd asks Harry to talk to her on his behalf. However, Harry agrees to go skiing with Mary instead, lying to Lloyd that he arranged a date for him.

While Harry and Mary have an enjoyable time together, Lloyd waits at the hotel bar and encounters Beth. Visiting Mary&#x27;s home, he realizes that Harry lied to spend the day with her himself. In retaliation, Lloyd serves him coffee laced with laxatives, causing Harry to spontaneously defecate in Mary&#x27;s broken toilet, while Lloyd reintroduces himself to Mary. Taking her to the hotel to return the briefcase, he confesses his love for her, but she rejects him.

They are held at gunpoint by Nicholas, who is behind the abduction of Mary&#x27;s husband, Bobby, and is furious to discover that Harry and Lloyd spent the ransom, replacing it with IOUs. Harry arrives and is shot by Nicholas, and plays dead before ineptly returning fire. An FBI team bursts in led by Beth, who is actually an agent on the kidnappers&#x27; trail and prepared Harry with a bulletproof vest and gun. Nicholas and Shay are arrested, and Mary and Bobby are reunited, much to Lloyd&#x27;s dejection.

Their trip rendered pointless, their hopes for the trip crushed, Harry and Lloyd travel home on foot, after all their purchases were confiscated and their minibike broke down. They encounter a busload of bikini models on a national tour, but ignorantly reject an offer to be their &quot;oil boys&quot;. Harry tells Lloyd that they will get their &quot;break&quot; one day, and they play a game of tag as they walk back to Rhode Island.

==Production==
John Hughes conceived the film before he sold it to the Farrelly brothers and asked for his name to be removed from the writing credits. His concept was named &quot;Ski Nuts&quot; and was about &quot;two dumb guys in Aspen&quot;. The Farrelly brothers had been trying for years to get their first movie made. Director Peter&#x27;s agent encouraged him to make a movie himself, alongside his brother Bobby. The Farrelly brothers did not know who Jim Carrey was; they were only told that he was &quot;The White Guy&quot; on &quot;In Living Color&quot;. Only after a screening of Carrey&#x27;s first major acting role, &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot;, did they become interested in casting him. Based on the box-office success of Ace Ventura, Carrey was able to negotiate a salary of $7 million for this film.

Nicolas Cage, who was proposed to be Carrey&#x27;s co-star, tried to negotiate a $2 million increase in his fee but New Line Cinema decided against casting him and signed Jeff Daniels instead. Cage said he turned it down to do &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; instead. Daniels was only paid around $50,000. New Line Cinema originally did not want Daniels in the film, as he was known only for his dramatic work at the time. However, the Farrellys and Carrey wanted Daniels for the part. Although New Line Cinema agreed to their demands, Daniels was offered the low salary in the hopes it would discourage him from signing on to the film. Daniels ultimately accepted the role, despite his agent reportedly dissuading him out of fears it would kill his career.

Steve Martin and Martin Short both turned down the role of Lloyd. According to Splitsider, Gary Oldman and Cage were the original choices for Lloyd and Harry. Chris Elliott and Rob Lowe were both also considered for the role of Harry. Carrey&#x27;s chipped tooth was genuine, resulting from a fight with a classmate in his childhood, but he had since had it capped. He simply had the crown temporarily removed from that tooth to portray Lloyd.

===Filming===
Scenes taking place in Aspen were filmed in Breckenridge, Colorado and Park City, Utah. The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado was transformed into the &quot;Danbury Hotel&quot; for the filming of the movie. The &quot;Danbury Hotel&quot; bar scene and staircase shot were the shots filmed there. The scenes filmed in the snow were shot at Copper Mountain Resort, Colorado. Some of the external street scenes were filmed in Salt Lake City, and the airport scene was filmed at Salt Lake City International Airport. Some scenes from the beginning of the film were shot on location in the Providence metropolitan area, including shots of the skyline and The Big Blue Bug; scenes from the beginning of their road trip were shot in locations in Cumberland, Rhode Island. Parts of the film were also shot in Ogden, Utah and American Fork Canyon.

==Music==
===Soundtrack===

The original soundtrack to the film was released by RCA Records on November 22, 1994. The soundtrack album&#x27;s first single, &quot;New Age Girl&quot; by Deadeye Dick, was a chart hit, reaching number 27 in the US, while the music video for the Crash Test Dummies&#x27; version of &quot;The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead&quot; featured Jeff Daniels reprising his role of Harry.

The soundtrack album has generally seen positive reception from critics. Joe Bishop of &quot;Vice&quot; named the album his favorite movie soundtrack, while the same site&#x27;s Cameron Matthews described it as &quot;a perfect slice of the mid-&#x27;90s sound: bubbly pop rock with jangly chords and just enough grit, or aka the thing you can give your kids when they one day ask you what the &#x27;90s were like&quot;.

Though not present on the soundtrack, the film famously features Carrey and Daniels singing an a cappella version of &quot;Mockingbird&quot; to Mike Starr&#x27;s character. Also missing on the soundtrack is Apache Indian&#x27;s &quot;Boom Shack-A-Lak&quot;, which accompanies the film&#x27;s opening sequence, as well as several other songs appearing in the film. Songs not included on the soundtrack are &quot;Red Right Hand&quot; by Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds, &quot;The Rain, The Park and Other Things&quot; by The Cowsills, &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; by Crash Test Dummies, &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot; by Roy Orbison, &quot;Can We Still Be Friends?&quot; by Todd Rundgren and &quot;Rollin&#x27; Down the Hill&quot; by The Rembrandts.

Beck had been approached about including his song &quot;Loser&quot; on the soundtrack, but he refused. He recalled the process: &quot;I remember getting a phone call one day. My manager said, &#x27;There&#x27;s a film. They want to use &#x27;Loser&#x27; as the theme song&#x27;. There was a long pause, and he said, &#x27;The name of the film is &quot;Dumb And Dumber&quot;. And I just remember: That sums up what the world thinks of me at this point. I tried to have fun with it, tried to not take it too serious. But at the same time, it was a little disheartening sometimes.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; opened at No. 1 in its opening weekend, earning $16.4 million. It went on to gross $127,175,374 in the United States, and $247,275,374 worldwide, and topping the holiday season film gross.

===Critical response===
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 68% of 53 surveyed critics gave &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; a positive review; the average rating is 6.1/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;A relentlessly stupid comedy elevated by its main actors: Jim Carrey goes bonkers and Jeff Daniels carries himself admirably in an against-type performance&quot;. On Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from film critics, it has a score of 41 based on reviews from 14 critics, which indicates &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film two of four stars for the hit-or-miss comedic elements, but praised the performances of Carrey and Daniels, dubbing the former a &quot;true original&quot;, and writing that the dead parakeet joke &quot;made me laugh so loudly I embarrassed myself. I just couldn&#x27;t stop&quot;. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Carrey &quot;the new Jerry Lewis&quot;, and Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;riotous&quot;, &quot;rib-splitting&quot;, and gave the film praise for being both a crude and slapstick comedy and a &quot;smart comedy&quot; at the same time.

===Accolades===

Although &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; did not secure any major American film awards, it was successful at the 1995 MTV Movie Awards. Carrey won for Best Comic Performance, Carrey and Holly (a couple who would later endure a short-lived marriage) won for Best Kiss, and Carrey and Daniels were nominated for Best On-Screen Duo. In 2000, readers of &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine voted &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; the fifth greatest comedy film of all time. The film ranks 445th on &quot;Empire&quot;″s 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.

=== Year-end lists ===
* 7th – David Stupich, &quot;The Milwaukee Journal&quot;
* Worst films (not ranked) – Jeff Simon, &quot;The Buffalo News&quot;
* 2nd worst – Sean P. Means, &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot;
* Top 10 worst (listed alphabetically, not ranked) – Mike Mayo, &quot;The Roanoke Times&quot;

==Other media==
===Animated series===

In 1995, a Hanna-Barbera-produced animated series aired on ABC, as part of its Saturday morning cartoon lineup; Matt Frewer provided the voice of Lloyd, while Bill Fagerbakke voiced Harry. In the cartoon, Harry and Lloyd have reacquired their van, now named &quot;Otto&quot;. The cartoon also features a new character, Kitty, a female pet purple beaver who appears to be smarter than both men. The animated series was written by Bennett Yellin, co-writer of the film, and aired for only one season, having been cancelled.

===Prequel===

In 2003, a prequel was theatrically released, entitled &quot;Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd&quot;. The film featured a cast and crew different from the previous film, and the Farrelly brothers had no involvement in the film&#x27;s production. It was panned by critics, receiving a 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It grossed approximately $39.2 million worldwide against a $19 million budget, as opposed to the original film&#x27;s far greater $247 million worldwide gross against a $17 million budget.

===Sequel===

The Farrelly brothers returned to make a sequel to &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;. The sequel, titled &quot;Dumb and Dumber To&quot;, was shot in the fall of 2013. Carrey and Daniels returned, and Bobby and Peter Farrelly returned to direct along with original screenwriter Bennett Yellin. Actors reprising their roles from the first film include Brady Bluhm, who played Billy in (Apartment) 4C, and Cam Neely, who played Sea Bass. &quot;Dumb and Dumber To&quot; was released on November 14, 2014. Compared to the original film, &quot;Dumb and Dumber To&quot; was met with mixed reviews from critics, although it did well commercially. &quot;Dumb and Dumber To&quot; was not released by Warner Bros. Pictures (who now owns New Line Cinema), but rather by Universal Pictures. New Line was given studio credit from Universal.

<text>The Walker River is a river in west-central Nevada in the United States, approximately long. Fed principally by snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada of California, it drains an arid portion of the Great Basin southeast of Reno and flows into the endorheic basin of Walker Lake. The river is an important source of water for irrigation in its course through Nevada; water diversions have reduced its flow such that the level of Walker Lake has fallen between 1882 and 2010. The river was named for explorer Joseph Reddeford Walker, a mountain man and experienced scout who is known for establishing a segment of the California Trail.

==Course==
The Walker River is formed in southern Lyon County, south of Yerington, by the confluence of the East Walker and West Walker rivers. The West Walker River originates at Tower Lake in Mono County, California, above sea level in the Stanislaus National Forest. It flows north through a rugged canyon which provides the route for U.S. Route 395. It then emerges into Antelope Valley, where some water is diverted to the Topaz Lake reservoir, enters Nevada in Douglas County, and turns northeast. It flows through Hoye Canyon into Lyon County, then across the Smith Valley, past Smith, and finally through Wilson Canyon into the Mason Valley, where it joins the East Walker.

The East Walker River also begins in Mono County, California, in the Bridgeport Valley, fed by several Sierra streams originating in the Hoover Wilderness, including Buckeye, Robinson, Green, and Virginia creeks. After forming the Bridgeport Reservoir at the town of Bridgeport, the East Walker flows northeast into Nevada in Lyon County, receives Rough Creek, and flows north along the eastern edge of the Toiyabe National Forest before its confluence with the West Walker.

Below the forks, the Walker River flows initially north through the Mason Valley, past Yerington, into central Lyon County. It turns sharply to the southeast around the north end of the Wassuk Range, flowing through the Walker River Indian Reservation where it is dammed to create Weber Reservoir. It flows past Schurz, where most of the remaining water is diverted for irrigation. The river seasonally continues south to empty into Walker Lake, approximately north-northwest of Hawthorne.

The Walker River naturally discharged about of water into Walker Lake, although this varies greatly between wet and dry years. Large irrigation diversions have reduced the average flow into Walker Lake to about . As a result, the level of Walker lake has dropped by between 1882 and 2010, with about of that occurring between 1996 and 2010. The lake has lost more than half its original surface area and 80 percent of its water volume.

==Watershed==
The Walker River&#x27;s endorheic drainage basin covers an area of , which is approximately 80 percent of the total Walker Lake watershed of . The U.S. Geological Survey divides the basin into 4 sub-basins:
*West Walker of 
*East Walker of 
*Walker River of 
*Walker Lake of 

The Walker River headwaters originate along a large section of the Sierra Crest at elevations of or more. The southern boundary of the Walker River drainage basin forms the northern border of Yosemite National Park. The Sweetwater Mountains lie between the West Walker and East Walker rivers, and the Pine Nut Mountains lie northwest of the West Walker. The lower Desert Mountains form the northern edge of the Walker River watershed. The Wassuk Range lies between the main Walker River watershed and Walker Lake in the east; the Walker River makes a long detour around the north end of the range in order to reach Walker Lake.

The river irrigates a total of , of which about 38 percent is in California and 62 percent in Nevada. Of the irrigated areas, 23 percent are in the Bridgeport Valley (California), 15 percent are in the Antelope Valley (California), 15 percent in the Smith Valley (Nevada), 44 percent in the Mason Valley (Nevada), and 2 percent on the Walker River Indian Reservation. Average annual consumptive use between 1939 and 1993 was , leaving only to flow to Walker Lake, mostly in wet years such as 1997–98.

==Geology==
Sedimentary evidence suggests that the Walker River has changed course in the past, flowing northwest through the Adrian Valley from a point near present-day Wabuska into the Carson River. There were some anecdotal observations of this phenomenon during the early 20th century. During these course changes, the Walker River ceased to flow into Walker Lake, causing it to dry up. Sediment deposits around Walker Lake have happened at least twice in the previous 13,000 years, although this may also have been due to severe drought.

==History==
The first humans to inhabit the Walker River basin may have arrived as early as 11,000 years ago. Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the Walker River was part of the territory of the Northern Paiute people.

The first European to see the Walker River was probably Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company fur trapper Peter Skene Ogden, who had discovered the Humboldt River in 1828 and returned in 1829 to trap beaver south of the Humboldt Sink, although records are scant.

In 1833, Joseph R. Walker led a party sent by Captain Benjamin Bonneville to find a route from the Great Salt Lake to California via the Humboldt River, the Humboldt Sink, the Carson Sink, and then up into the Sierra Nevada by either the Carson River or the Walker River to near the headwaters of the Merced River and thence down to the San Joaquin River. John C. Frémont named Walker Lake after the trapper, and the United States Geographic Board named the river after Walker in its Fifth Report.

Due to a very heavy snowpack in the winter of 1996/1997 and a very warm spring, the West Fork of the Walker River flooded to unprecedented levels. Much of Highway 395 for the 30-mile span where it shares a canyon with the river was completely washed away.

==Ecology==
That North American beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;) were once native to the Walker River is evidenced by a 1906 article in the &quot;Nevada State Journal&quot; newspaper by newspaper mining writer Fitz-James MacCarthy (aka Fitz-Mac), who stated that the Mason&#x27;s Valley of the Walker River in Yerington was well known to &quot;the early trappers and fur hunters...Kit Carson knew it to the bone...The beavers of course were all trapped long ago, and you never see an elk nowadays...&quot; Beaver have since re-colonized the Walker River watershed.

The Walker River and Walker Lake formerly supported Lahontan cutthroat trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi&quot;) or LCT; however, increases in salinity due to the declining water level have decimated the fishery. The last confirmed catch of LCT from Walker Lake was in 2009. A remnant population of LCT are still extant in By-Day Creek, a tributary of the East Walker River.

The riparian zone of the lower Walker River and its delta at Walker Lake provide important habitat for migratory birds.

==In popular culture==

=== In music ===
The popular song &quot;Darcy Farrow&quot;, written in 1964, references the Walker River and geographic features from around the associated region in Nevada:

He spent the first six weeks of his life in Georgia where his father was teaching before the family moved to his parents&#x27; native Michigan where he grew up in Chelsea. His father owned the Chelsea Lumber Company and was a one-time mayor of the town.

Daniels briefly attended Central Michigan University and participated in the school&#x27;s theater program. In the summer of 1976, he attended the Eastern Michigan University drama school to participate in a special Bicentennial Repertory program, where he performed in &quot;The Hot L Baltimore&quot; and three other plays performed in repertoire.

Daniels performed in New York in &quot;The Shortchanged Review&quot; (1979) at Second Stage Theatre.

==Career==
=== 1977–1989: Early roles and breakthrough ===
Daniels starred in several New York productions, on and off Broadway. On Broadway, he made his debut as the assistant stage manager and various roles in the Albert Innaurato play &quot;Gemini&quot; (1977). He also acted in Lanford Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Fifth of July&quot; (1980) alongside William Hurt, for which he was nominated for a Drama Desk Award for Best Supporting Actor, and starred in A. R. Gurney&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Age&quot; (1984) with Stockard Channing. Daniels made his screen debut in Miloš Forman&#x27;s &quot;Ragtime&quot; in 1981. His next film was in James L. Brooks&#x27;s &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The film follows an emotional relationship between mother (Shirley MacLaine) and daughter (Debra Winger). Daniels plays Winger&#x27;s callow and unfaithful husband, a role which would prove to be his breakthrough.

In 1985, Daniels starred in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; alongside Mia Farrow and Danny Aiello. The film was met with critical praise earning a 91% on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus reading, &quot;lighthearted and sweet, &quot;Purple Rose&quot; stands as one of Woody Allen&#x27;s more inventive – and enchantingly whimsical – pictures.&quot; Daniels garnered a Golden Globe Award nomination for his performance. It was the film that inspired the name for the theater company he established. In 1986, he starred in Jonathan Demme&#x27;s &quot;Something Wild&quot; as an unassuming businessman swept up into a wild night by a mysterious woman (Melanie Griffith) and earned his second Golden Globe nomination. Also that year, Daniels had a supporting role alongside Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep in &quot;Heartburn&quot;, directed by Mike Nichols. In 1988, he co-starred with Kelly McGillis in Peter Yates&#x27; neo-noir &quot;The House on Carroll Street&quot;, and appeared in the ensemble dramedy &quot;Sweet Hearts Dance&quot; with Susan Sarandon, Don Johnson and Elizabeth Perkins. He had the lead in &quot;Checking Out&quot; (1989), which received only a limited theatrical release.

===1990–2008: Established actor ===
Daniels starred in a pair of romantic comedies, &quot;Love Hurts&quot; (1990) and &quot;The Butcher&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1991), playing Demi Moore&#x27;s love interest in the latter. His sci-fi vehicle &quot;Timescape&quot; (1992) went straight to video. His next significant role was as Colonel Joshua Chamberlain in &quot;Gettysburg&quot; (1993). Daniels reprised the role of Chamberlain 10 years later in the prequel film &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;.

Daniels continued his work in the theater with &quot;Redwood Curtain&quot; (1993). Off-Broadway, he starred in Lanford Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Lemon Sky&quot; with Cynthia Nixon where he received a Drama Desk nomination for and an Obie Award for his performance in the Circle Repertory Company production of &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot;.

In 1994, Daniels would co-star with Jim Carrey in one of his most commercially successful films, &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;. It was a noted departure for Daniels, owing to his status as a dramatic actor. Earlier that year, Daniels appeared with Keanu Reeves in the action blockbuster &quot;Speed&quot;; the film was an enormous hit, grossing over $350 million at the box office. Daniels would then host &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; a second time before the release of the 1996 Disney live-action remake of &quot;101 Dalmatians.&quot; Daniels starred as the owner of a litter of dalmatians stolen by the evil Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close). The film was successful, grossing $320 million. Daniels plays a grungy cop Alvin Strayer along with Eric Stoltz in 2 Days in the Valley. Also in 1996 was the family hit film &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; with Daniels as the supportive single father of Anna Paquin&#x27;s goose-raising preteen. Daniels then had a critical and commercial misfire with &quot;Trial and Error&quot; (1997). He would rebound, however, with 1998&#x27;s &quot;Pleasantville&quot; as diner owner Bill Johnson, who learns to act as an individual and rebel against the norm at the urging of Tobey Maguire&#x27;s David. Also starring Reese Witherspoon, Joan Allen, and Don Knotts, &quot;Pleasantville&quot; was nominated for three Academy Awards. Daniels starred alongside Christopher Lloyd&#x27;s comedy &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;.

Daniels starred in the TV films &quot;The Crossing&quot;, &quot;Cheaters&quot;, and the direct-to-video release &quot;Chasing Sleep&quot;. At this point, in the early 2000s, he began to focus more on his theater work at The Purple Rose Theatre as well as writing, starring, and directing the films &quot;Escanaba in da Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Super Sucker&quot;. Daniels&#x27;s next major film role would be in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Blood Work&quot;, which received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure. He would rebound later that year with Stephen Daldry&#x27;s Academy Award-winning &quot;The Hours&quot; alongside Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Nicole Kidman. The film was also a financial success, grossing well over $100 million. &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; followed in 2003, as did the action film &quot;I Witness,&quot; which co-starred James Spader. Daniels then starred in &quot;Imaginary Heroes&quot; and the 2004 television film adaptation of fellow Michigander and friend Mitch Albom&#x27;s bestseller &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot;.

The year 2005 proved to be a strong year for Daniels as he garnered notice as the star of the lauded Noah Baumbach film &quot;The Squid and the Whale&quot; with Laura Linney. Daniels received his third Golden Globe nomination for the film, about a divorcing couple and the effect the split has on their children. That year Daniels also starred in the family film adaptation of &quot;Because of Winn-Dixie.&quot; He would round out the year with a supporting role in George Clooney&#x27;s Oscar-nominated film &quot;Good Night and Good Luck,&quot; starring David Straithairn, Patricia Clarkson, Robert Downey Jr., and Frank Langella. In 2006, Daniels appeared in the Truman Capote biopic &quot;Infamous&quot; starring Toby Jones, Sandra Bullock, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Sigourney Weaver. The film was compared by critics to Bennett Miller&#x27;s 2005 film &quot;Capote&quot; starring Philip Seymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener, and Chris Cooper. 

Daniels appeared in an Off-Broadway production of David Harrower&#x27;s &quot;Blackbird&quot; in 2007 alongside Allison Pill, with whom he would later reunite in Aaron Sorkin&#x27;s &quot;The Newsroom&quot;. Daniels then starred in Barry Sonnenfeld&#x27;s family film &quot;RV&quot;, alongside Robin Williams, as the redneck comic foil to Williams&#x27; uptight businessman. He also starred in two other independent films, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Boy&quot; and &quot;The Lookout,&quot; for which he was nominated for a Satellite Award and &quot;Traitor&quot; (2008) with Don Cheadle.

<text>Wolfgang Walter Droege (or Dröge) (25 September 1949 – 13 April 2005) was a German-born Canadian white supremacist, neo-Nazi and founding leader of the Heritage Front. He was killed during a bungled drug deal in 2005.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Droege was born in Forchheim, Germany. His parents and grandparents had been enthusiastic supporters of the Nazi Party, and Julius Streicher was a friend of the family. Droege and his mother moved to Canada in 1962. In 1967, he moved back to Germany to join the military but was rejected for health reasons, so he returned to Canada and became a Canadian citizen in the early 1970s.

===1970s===
Droege became interested in far-right politics. He joined an extremist group, the Western Guard, in 1974 at the prompting of Don Andrews and later joined Andrews&#x27;s Nationalist Party of Canada. He was arrested, charged, and convicted of damage to property and mischief in 1975 after spraying &quot;white power&quot; slogans along the route of the African Liberation Day march in Toronto. In December 1976, he joined the Ku Klux Klan, then led by David Duke, after attending the &quot;International Patriotic Congress&quot; in New Orleans organized by Duke. Droege was second in command to Canadian Grand Wizard James Alexander McQuirter and the pair attempted to start a KKK branch in Toronto. He also organized for the Klan in British Columbia where he spread Duke&#x27;s &quot;one law for all&quot; and &quot;equal rights for everyone&quot; slogans.

===1980s===
In 1981, Droege helped organize a failed attempt, codenamed &quot;Operation Red Dog&quot;, to invade Dominica, overthrow its government, and restore deposed Prime Minister Patrick John to power. According to testimony presented at the trial of Droege and his nine co-conspirators, in exchange for restoring John to power, Droege would have been permitted to use the island as the centre of a drug-refinement and trafficking operation.

The attempted coup went awry after a CFTR radio reporter who had been approached about an &quot;exclusive story&quot; decided to contact the police. Droege was sentenced to a three-year prison sentence for his mercenary activities. As it was launched from New Orleans, this event was derided as the &quot;Bayou of Pigs&quot; fiasco by critics such as Don Andrews.

A book about the plot, by Canadian journalist Stewart Bell, was published in August 2008.

In 1985, he was arrested in Alabama as an illegal alien and charged with cocaine possession, as well as possession of an illegal knife. He served four years of a 13-year sentence. Upon his release from jail in 1989, Droege went to Libya to attend a congress of what became the International Third Position and then returned to Canada to found the Heritage Front.

===1990s===
In 1992, Droege&#x27;s connections with racist organizations led to his expulsion from the Reform Party of Canada—Droege and a number of others from this community were trying to enter the Reform Party when it expanded in Ontario, and to take advantage of the party&#x27;s inexperience. Later, in the 1993 Federal Election, Droege and other Heritage Front members made a point of being seen outside of Reform Party events in the city of Toronto. In 1993, following an attack with ARA members in retaliation for their attack on the house of Gary Schipper, the Heritage Front&#x27;s spokesman, Droege was charged and convicted of aggravated assault and possession of dangerous weapons, and he served two months of a three-month sentence. Following his release from prison, Droege drifted away from organized racial activities and worked for a time as a bailiff with a longtime acquaintance, Al Overfield. After losing his job, he returned to cigarette and drug trafficking as well as auto theft.

Droege ran for Scarborough city council in the 1994 municipal elections, receiving 802 votes in a two-person contest. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to possession of a stolen car.

===2000s===
Droege&#x27;s fifty-fifth birthday party was held at Jack Astor&#x27;s restaurant in Etobicoke, Ontario, just weeks after the same restaurant was the site of a confrontation between Anti-Racist Action and supporters of Ernst Zündel.

Droege was found shot to death on 13 April 2005 in the hallway of his lowrise apartment in Scarborough, Ontario, outside of his door. The gunman, Keith Deroux, had approached him to purchase cocaine. Deroux shot Droege in the throat, and panicked before shooting him in the head. On 16 June 2006, Deroux pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to ten years in prison. According to an agreed statement of facts read out in court, Deroux was an alcoholic with paranoid delusions.

<text>David Anthony Pirner (born April 16, 1964) is an American songwriter, singer, and producer best known as the lead vocalist and frontman for the alternative rock band Soul Asylum.

==Early life and work==
Pirner was born in Green Bay, Wisconsin and graduated from Minneapolis West High School in 1982. He taught himself how to play the drums. By age 20, Pirner started his career drumming with a punk band called Loud Fast Rules as part of the Minneapolis scene, together with Karl Mueller (bass) and Dan Murphy (guitar). When Pirner switched to singing and playing rhythm guitar, Pat Morley joined on drums. Morley was later replaced by Grant Young, and the band changed their name to Soul Asylum. After touring the United States for a number of years they gathered a cult following of fans, but did not quite reach commercial visibility. Pirner at the time was the band&#x27;s songwriter and he produced the album, &quot;Coup De Grace,&quot; by the Minneapolis metal band the Coup de Grace in 1990.

==Commercial success==
The band achieved commercial success and visibility on MTV and VH1 with the 1993 single &quot;Runaway Train&quot;, followed by another hit song, &quot;Black Gold&quot;; both from their album &quot;Grave Dancers Union&quot;. As Soul Asylum grew in popularity, Pirner was seen guesting on albums of differing genres, including artists like Paul Westerberg, Jason Karaban, Mike Watt, The Autumn Defense and Victoria Williams. His disheveled appearance and blonde matted dreadlocks made an unmistakable impression on fans and critics alike, making Pirner easily recognized and associating the band with the grunge scene.
By 1999, Soul Asylum went into hiatus after making their eighth album &quot;Candy from a Stranger&quot; (1998). After four years, the band reunited and started writing songs in the studio. Bassist Karl Mueller died on June 17, 2005, at the age of 42 from esophageal cancer. About a year after his death, Soul Asylum released &quot;The Silver Lining&quot; on Legacy Recordings, which was dedicated to Mueller. Soul Asylum toured with their new line-up, which consisted of Pirner on guitar and vocals, Dan Murphy on lead guitar, Michael Bland on drums and Tommy Stinson on bass (as well as John Fields standing in on bass and piano for Mueller). A few years later, on July 17, 2012, Soul Asylum released an album titled Delayed Reaction. In 2016, the band released Change Of Fortune and in 2020 released Hurry Up And Wait.

Pirner had a small role in the film &quot;Reality Bites&quot; in 1994. He was also part of the all-star band assembled for the soundtrack of the 1994 film &quot;Backbeat&quot;. Pirner also contributed to the soundtrack of Kevin Smith&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; with an instrumental song called &quot;Tube Of Wonderful&quot;. There are two songs by the band Soul Asylum featured in the film: &quot;Lucky One&quot; and &quot;We 3&quot;. Pirner also composed the incidental music for the film. The song &quot;Can&#x27;t Even Tell&quot; is featured in Smith&#x27;s &quot;Clerks&quot;, and Smith used &quot;Misery&quot; in the sequel, &quot;Clerks II&quot;.

In 2002 Pirner released his first solo album entitled &quot;Faces &amp; Names&quot; on Ultimatum Music. He also contributed guest vocals on the song &quot;Chillout Tent&quot; in The Hold Steady&#x27;s 2006 release, &quot;Boys and Girls in America&quot;. In 2020 he released the book Loud Fast Words: Soul Asylum Collected Lyrics and when the pandemic stopped the tour Soul Asylum was making for their new album, Pirner and the band&#x27;s guitar player Ryan Smith played 100 original songs on weekly Facebook streams that were called The Quarantine Sessions.

<text>Otto Eduard Neugebauer (May 26, 1899 – February 19, 1990) was an Austrian-American mathematician and historian of science who became known for his research on the history of astronomy and the other exact sciences as they were practiced in antiquity and the Middle Ages. By studying clay tablets, he discovered that the ancient Babylonians knew much more about mathematics and astronomy than had been previously realized. The National Academy of Sciences has called Neugebauer &quot;the most original and productive scholar of the history of the exact sciences, perhaps of the history of science, of our age.&quot;

== Career ==
Neugebauer was born in Innsbruck, Austria. His father Rudolph Neugebauer was a railroad construction engineer and a collector and scholar of Oriental carpets. His parents died when he was quite young. During World War I, Neugebauer enlisted in the Austrian Army and served as an artillery lieutenant on the Italian front and then in an Italian prisoner-of-war camp alongside fellow countryman Ludwig Wittgenstein. In 1919, he entered the University of Graz in electrical engineering and physics and in 1921 he transferred to the University of Munich. From 1922 to 1924, he studied mathematics at the University of Göttingen under Richard Courant, Edmund Landau, and Emmy Noether. During 1924–1925, he was at the University of Copenhagen, where his interests changed to the history of Egyptian mathematics.

He returned to Göttingen and remained there until 1933. His thesis &quot;Die Grundlagen der ägyptischen Bruchrechnung&quot; (&quot;The Fundamentals of Egyptian Calculation with Fractions&quot;) (Springer, 1926) was a mathematical analysis of the table in the Rhind Papyrus. In 1927, he received his venia legendi for the history of mathematics and served as Privatdozent. In 1927, his first paper on Babylonian mathematics was an account of the origin of the sexagesimal system.

In 1929, Neugebauer founded &quot;Quellen und Studien zur Geschichte der Mathematik, Astronomie und Physik&quot; (QS), a Springer series devoted to the history of the mathematical sciences, in which he published extended papers on Egyptian computational techniques in arithmetic and geometry, including the Moscow Papyrus, the most important text for geometry. Neugebauer had worked on the Moscow Papyrus in Leningrad in 1928.

In 1931, he founded the review journal Zentralblatt für Mathematik und ihre Grenzgebiete (Zbl), his most important contribution to modern mathematics. When Adolf Hitler became chancellor in 1933, Neugebauer was asked to sign an oath of loyalty to the new German government, but he refused and was promptly suspended from employment. In 1934, he joined the University of Copenhagen as a full professor of mathematics. In 1936, he published a paper on the method of dating and analyzing texts using diophantine equations. During 1935–1937, he published a corpus of texts named &quot;Mathematische Keilschrift-Texte&quot; (MKT). MKT was a colossal work, in size, detail, and depth, and its contents showed that Babylonian mathematics far surpassed anything one could imagine from a knowledge of Egyptian and Greek mathematics. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1928 in Bologna and a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1936 in Oslo.

In 1939, after the &quot;Zentralblatt&quot; was taken over by the Nazis, he moved to the United States, joined the mathematics department at Brown University, and founded &quot;Mathematical Reviews&quot;. He became an American citizen and remained at Brown for most of his career, founding the History of Mathematics Department there in 1947 and becoming University Professor. Jointly with the American Assyriologist Abraham Sachs, he published &quot;Mathematical Cuneiform Texts&quot; in 1945, which has remained a standard English-language work on Babylonian mathematics. In 1967, he was awarded the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship by the American Astronomical Society. In 1977, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and in 1979, he received the Award for Distinguished Service to Mathematics from the Mathematical Association of America. In 1984, he moved to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he had been a member since 1950.

Neugebauer was also interested in chronology. He was able to reconstruct the Alexandrian Christian calendar and its origin from the Alexandrian Jewish calendar as of about the 4th century, at least 200 years prior to any other source for either calendar. Thus, the Jewish calendar was derived by combining the 19-year cycle using the Alexandrian year with the seven-day week, and was then slightly modified by the Christians to prevent Easter from ever coinciding with Passover. The ecclesiastical calendar, considered by church historians to be highly scientific and deeply complex, turned out to be quite simple.

In 1988, by studying a scrap of Greek papyrus, Neugebauer discovered the most important single piece of evidence to date for the extensive transmission of Babylonian astronomy to the Greeks and for the continuing use of Babylonian methods for 400 years even after Ptolemy wrote the Almagest. His last paper, &quot;From Assyriology to Renaissance Art&quot;, published in 1989, detailed the history of a single astronomical parameter, the mean length of the synodic month, from cuneiform tablets, to the papyrus fragment just mentioned, to the Jewish calendar, to an early 15th-century book of hours.

In 1986, Neugebauer was awarded the Balzan Prize &quot;for his fundamental research into the exact sciences in the ancient world, in particular, on ancient Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Greek astronomy, which has put our understanding of ancient science on a new footing and illuminated its transmission to the classical and medieval worlds. For his outstanding success in promoting interest and further research in the history of science&quot; (Motivation of the Balzan General Prize Committee). Neugebauer donated the prize money of 250,000 Swiss francs to the Institute for Advanced Study.

Neugebauer began his career as a mathematician, then turned to Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics, and then took up the history of mathematical astronomy. In a career which spanned sixty-five years, he largely created modern understanding of mathematical astronomy in Babylon and Egypt, through Greco-Roman antiquity, to India, the Islamic world, and Europe of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The noted physicist and astronomer Gerry Neugebauer at Caltech was his son.

<doc id="737817" wikidata="Q1273695" url="?curid=737817" title="Viva, Viva a FRELIMO">
<text>&quot;Viva, Viva a FRELIMO&quot; () was the national anthem of Mozambique from independence from Portugal on 25 June 1975 to 30 April 2002, when it was replaced by &quot;Pátria Amada&quot;.

==History==
The anthem was written by Justino Sigaulane Chemane in 1975 and adopted as the national anthem of the People&#x27;s Republic of Mozambique on 25 June 1975. The lyrics celebrate Mozambique&#x27;s independence, socialism and Mozambique&#x27;s main political party, FRELIMO, which brought the country to its independence in 1975.

In 1994, multi-party elections were held in Mozambique, and consequently the lyrics to the anthem were often omitted from most public performances and radio broadcasts, as they were felt to be inappropriate in a multi-party, capitalist country. In April 1997, the government initiated a national contest to see who could write the best new lyrics for the national anthem. Initially, this contest sought to change the lyrics and keep the melody, however eventually the requirement for the melody was dropped. &quot;Pátria Amada&quot; became Mozambique&#x27;s national anthem on 30 April 2002, after a majority vote by the Assembly of the Republic.

<text>Robert Henry Dicke (; May 6, 1916 – March 4, 1997) was an American astronomer and physicist who made important contributions to the fields of astrophysics, atomic physics, cosmology and gravity. He was the Albert Einstein Professor in Science at Princeton University (1975–1984).

==Biography==
Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Dicke completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree at Princeton University and his doctorate, in 1939, from the University of Rochester in nuclear physics. During the Second World War he worked in the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he worked on the development of radar and designed the Dicke radiometer, a microwave receiver. He used this to set a limit on the temperature of the microwave background radiation, from the roof of the Radiation Laboratory, of less than 20 kelvins.

In 1946, he returned to Princeton University, where he remained for the remainder of his career. He did some work in atomic physics, particularly on the laser and measuring the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron. An important contribution to the field of spectroscopy and radiative transfer was his prediction of the phenomenon called Dicke narrowing: When the mean free path of an atom is much smaller than the wavelength of one of its radiation transitions, the atom changes velocity and direction many times during the emission or absorption of a photon. This causes an averaging over different Doppler states and results in an atomic linewidth that is much narrower than the Doppler width. Dicke narrowing occurs at relatively low pressures in the millimeter wave and microwave regions (where it is used in atomic clocks to improve precision). Dicke narrowing is analogous to the Mössbauer effect for gamma rays.

In 1956, approximately two years before Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow filed their patent application, Dicke filed a patent titled &quot;Molecular Amplification Generation Systems and Methods&quot; with claims of how to build an infrared laser and the use of an open resonator and the patent was awarded on September 9, 1958.

He spent the remainder of his career developing a program of precision tests of general relativity using the framework of the equivalence principle. In 1957, he first proposed an alternative theory of gravitation inspired by Mach&#x27;s principle and Paul Dirac&#x27;s large numbers hypothesis. In 1961, this led to the Brans–Dicke theory of gravitation, developed with Carl H. Brans, an equivalence-principle violating modification of general relativity. A highlight experiment was the test of the equivalence principle by Roll, Krotkov and Dicke, which was a factor of 100 more accurate than previous work. He also made measurements of solar oblateness which were useful in understanding the perihelion precession of Mercury&#x27;s orbit, one of the classical tests of general relativity.

Dirac had hypothesized that because the gravitational constant &quot;G&quot; is very roughly equal to the inverse age of the universe in certain units, then &quot;G&quot; must vary to maintain this equality. Dicke realized that Dirac&#x27;s relation could be a selection effect: fundamental physical laws connect &quot;G&quot; to the lifetime of what are called main sequence stars, such as the Sun, and these stars, according to Dicke, are necessary for the existence of life. At any other epoch, when the equality did not hold, there would be no intelligent life around to notice the discrepancy. This was the first modern application of what is now called the weak anthropic principle.

In the early 1960s, work on Brans–Dicke theory led Dicke to think about the early Universe, and with Jim Peebles he re-derived the prediction of a cosmic microwave background (having allegedly forgotten the earlier prediction of George Gamow and co-workers). Dicke, with David Todd Wilkinson and Peter G. Roll, immediately began building a Dicke radiometer to search for the radiation. They were preceded by the accidental detection made by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson (also using a Dicke radiometer), who were working at Bell Labs near Princeton. Nevertheless, Dicke&#x27;s group made the second clean detection, and their theoretical interpretation of Penzias and Wilson&#x27;s results showed that theories of the early universe had moved from pure speculation into well-tested physics.

In 1970, Dicke argued that the universe must have very nearly the critical density of matter needed to stop it expanding forever. Standard models of the universe pass through stages dominated by radiation, matter, curvature etc. Transitions between stages are very special cosmic times which &quot;a priori&quot; could differ by many orders of magnitude. Since there is a non-negligible amount of matter, either we are coincidentally living close to the transition to or from the matter-dominated stage, or we are in the middle of it; the latter is preferred since the coincidences are highly unlikely (an application of the Copernican principle). This implies a negligible curvature, so the universe must have almost critical density. This has been called the &quot;Dicke coincidence&quot; argument. In fact it gives the wrong answer, since we seem to be living at the time of transition between the matter and dark energy stages. An anthropic explanation of the failure of Dicke&#x27;s argument was given by Weinberg.

Dicke was also responsible for developing the lock-in amplifier, which is an indispensable tool in the area of applied science and engineering. Many of Dicke&#x27;s experiments capitalize on lock-in in some way or another. However, in an interview with Martin Harwit he claims that even though he is often credited with the invention of the device; he believes he read about it in a review of scientific equipment written by Walter C. Michels, a professor at Bryn Mawr.

Dicke is also credited with the invention of a kind of radio receiver, called a &quot;Dicke Radiometric Receiver&quot; or simply &quot;Dicke Radiometer&quot;, developed by Dicke during WWII. His radiometer was characterized by a noise temperature calibration technique using a switchable resistor, known as &quot;Dicke Resistor&quot;.

Dicke was awarded the 1970 National Medal of Science. In 1973, he was awarded the Comstock Prize in Physics from the National Academy of Sciences, of which he was a member. He was also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. Dicke was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics multiple times. Peebles ended his own 2019 Nobel Lecture with a statement of disappointment that Dicke had never been awarded the prize, then said, &quot;But I am satisfied now because my Nobel Prize is closure of what Bob set in motion, his great goal of establishing an empirically based gravity physics, by the establishment of the empirically-based relativistic cosmology.&quot;

== Marriage and family life ==
Dicke married Annie Currie in 1942. Currie, of Scottish descent, was born in Barrow-in-Furness in England in 1920 and as a young girl immigrated to Rochester, New York, via Australia and New Zealand, of which Annie had very fond memories.

At the beginning of World War II, Dicke was asked to assist the war effort by applying his skills to the development of radar with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

At the end of the war, Dicke and Currie moved to Princeton, New Jersey, where Robert was on the faculty at Princeton University. Dicke died there March 4, 1997. Currie continued to live in Princeton until 2002. For the last years of her life she lived in Hightstown, New Jersey at Meadow Lakes Retirement Community until her death in 2005.

They had one daughter, Nancy born in 1945, and two sons, John born in 1946 and James born in 1953. At the time of Dicke&#x27;s death they had six grandchildren and a great grandchild.

<text>Jeremy Weate (born in September 1969 in Wheaton Aston) studied philosophy at the University of Hull, the University of Liège and the University of Warwick, graduating with a PhD in European philosophy from Warwick in 1998. His PhD thesis was &quot;Phenomenology and Difference: the Body, Architecture and Race&quot;.

Weate is the author of the children&#x27;s book &quot;A Young Person&#x27;s Guide to Philosophy&quot;, which was published by Dorling Kindersley in 1998 and translated into 9 languages.

After completing his PhD, Weate became an international development consultant, focusing on transparency, accountability and good governance in the extractive industries. He has worked in over twenty-five countries across Africa and Asia on projects related to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, policy and legal frameworks as well as political economy analyses.

During his time living in Nigeria, Weate worked closely with Dele Olojede to set up NEXT, a pioneering newspaper that aimed to raise standards in Nigerian journalism and challenge vested interests. Weate also co-founded Cassava Republic Press with Bibi Bakare-Yusuf, one of the most influential publishing companies in Africa. He has also written a number of articles about African literature.

After fifteen years as an international development consultant, Weate switched careers and now runs an ibogaine-assisted retreat centre - Tabula Rasa Retreat - in Portugal. He is also Executive Director of the Global Ibogaine Therapy Alliance . Weate was featured in a December 2017 article on ibogaine in The Observer and was one of the organisers of the European Ibogaine Forum in Vienna in 2017.

He is also a keen film-maker, currently working on two projects - one about an abandoned airfield near Wheaton Aston, and the other a documentary about ibogaine - The Ibogaine Stories.

<text>Abilene Network was a high-performance backbone network created by the Internet2 community in the late 1990s. In 2007 the Abilene Network was retired and the upgraded network became known as the &quot;Internet2 Network&quot;.

==History==
One of the aims of the Abilene project was to achieve 10 Gbit/s connectivity between every node by the end of 2006. Over 230 member institutions participated in Abilene, mostly universities and some corporate and affiliate institutions, in all of the US states as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
It connected to European research networks NORDUnet and SURFnet.
The legal entity behind the network was the University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development.

When it was established in 1999, the network backbone had a capacity of 2.5 Gbit/s. An upgrade to 10 Gbit/s began in 2003 and was completed on February 4, 2004.

The name &quot;Abilene&quot; was chosen because of the project&#x27;s resemblance, in ambition and scope, to the railhead in Abilene, Kansas, which in the 1860s represented the frontier of the United States for the nation&#x27;s railroad infrastructure.

==Abilene and Internet2 and the Internet2 Network==
The media often incorrectly used the term &quot;Internet2 Network&quot; when referring to the &quot;Abilene Network&quot;. Some sources even suggest that Internet2 is a network wholly separate from the Internet. This is misleading, since, at the time of the Abilene Network, Internet2 was the consortium and not a computer network. It is possible that many news sources adopted the term Internet2 because it seems like a logical name for a next-generation Internet backbone. Articles that reference Internet2 as a network were in fact referring to the Abilene Network. Internet2 adopted the name &quot;Internet2 Network&quot; for its entire network infrastructure.

Abilene formed a high-speed backbone by deploying cutting edge technologies not yet generally available on the scale of a national network backbone. Abilene was a private network used for education and research, but was not entirely isolated, since its members usually provide alternative access to many of their resources through the public Internet.

==Operations Center (NOC)==
Abilene&#x27;s Network Operations Center (NOC) was hosted at Indiana University since its inception. &quot;The cross-country backbone is 10 gigabits per second, with the goal of offering 100 megabits per second of connectivity between every Abilene connected desktop.&quot;

==2006/2007 Upgrade==
The Abilene project had used optical fiber networks donated by Qwest Communications. In March 2006, Internet2 announced its upgrade plans and migration to Level 3 Communications. Internet2&#x27;s Abilene transport agreement with Qwest expired in October 2007. Unlike the previous architecture, Level 3 manages and operated an Infinera Networks based DWDM system devoted to Internet2. Internet2 has control over provisioning and uses the 40 wavelength capacity to provide IP backbone connectivity as well as transport for a new SONET-based dynamic provisioning network based on the Ciena Corporation CoreDirector platform. The IP network was based on the Juniper Networks T640 routing platform.

When the transition to the new Level3-based infrastructure was complete, the name &quot;Abilene&quot; ceased to be used in favor of &quot;The Internet2 Network&quot;.

<doc id="737834" wikidata="Q14966119" url="?curid=737834" title="Urinal deodorizer block">
<text>Urinal deodorizer blocks (commonly known as urinal cakes, urinal cookies, urinal biscuits (or jocularly piscuits), urinal donuts, toilet lollies, trough lollies, urinal pucks, toilet pucks, or urinal peons (alternately urinal pee-ons)) are small disinfectant blocks or tablets that are added to urinals. As these products originally contained para-dichlorobenzene (pDCB) they may also be called para blocks. Besides disinfecting, the purpose of these materials is to deodorize restroom urinals. They are placed above the urinal drain, often in the confines of a small plastic device called a &quot;urinal screen&quot; that prevents loss down the drain when they dissolve down to a small size.

==Chemistry==

The chemicals composing the block vary. The original formulations were based upon naphthalene and then later para-dichlorobenzene, both now known to be hazardous to health by inhalation. In some areas, the use of para-dichlorobenzene-based blocks has been banned; in other areas para-dichlorobenzene blocks or &quot;para blocks&quot; are still used. Para-dichlorobenzene- and naphthalene-based blocks do not readily dissolve in water/urine, but easily sublime into the air, creating a sickly-sweet odor that has anti-microbial effects.

Many urinal blocks are now para-dichlorobenzene and naphthalene free; these water-soluble alternative blocks are made from a mixture of fragrances and surfactants (normally quaternary ammonium compounds),
which offer some active cleaning and antibacterial efficacy. The new water-soluble blocks improve the cleaning of the pipes which helps to reduce odor. Some recent formulations also include bacterial spores which, coupled with the surfactant cleaning power, can more completely get rid of odors and blockages caused by the buildup of solids in the traps and pipes. Some manufacturers claim that these &quot;biological blocks&quot; can enable completely no-flush waterless urinals to be fitted.

Some urinal blocks also have enzymes added to help digest buildup within pipes.

Autoflush and/or ice are sometimes used as alternatives.

<doc id="737838" wikidata="Q1323006" url="?curid=737838" title="Railfan">
<text>A railfan, train fan, rail buff or train buff (American English), railway enthusiast, railway buff, trainspotter (Australian/British English) or ferroequinologist is a person who is recreationally interested in trains and rail transport systems.

Railfans often combine their interest with other hobbies, especially photography and videography, radio scanning, railway modelling, studying railroad history and participating in railway station and rolling stock preservation efforts. There are many magazines and websites dedicated to railfanning and railway enthusiasts, including &quot;Trains&quot;, &quot;Railfan &amp; Railroad&quot;, &quot;The Railway Magazine&quot;, &quot;Locomotive Magazine&quot; and &quot;Railway Gazette International&quot;.

==Other names==
In the United Kingdom, rail enthusiasts are often called trainspotters or anoraks. The term &quot;gricer&quot; has been used in the UK since at least 1969 and is said to have been current in 1938 amongst members of the Manchester Locomotive Society, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. There has been speculation that the term derives from &quot;grouser&quot;, one who collects dead grouse after a shoot, but other etymologies have also been suggested.

In Australia, they are sometimes referred to as &quot;&quot;.

In Japan rail enthusiasts are known as &quot;densha otaku&quot;, although numerous terms exist to describe activities falling within the category including &quot;Toritetsu&quot; for fans of photographing and/or filming trains, &quot;Nori-tetsu&quot; (people who enjoy travelling by train) and &quot;Eki-tetsu&quot; (enthusiasts of train station architecture).

In the United States, they can be referred to pejoratively as &quot;&quot;. There is a dispute over the origin of this term. Some cite the extensive use of styrofoam to create scenery and landscaping in model railroad building, while others trace its origins to the related term &quot;Foamite&quot; (which stands for &quot;Far Out and Mentally Incompetent Train Enthusiast&quot;) or claim it refers to &quot;the notion of foaming-at-the-mouth craziness&quot;.

&quot;Ferroequinologist&quot; derives from the use of &quot;Iron horse&quot; as a nickname for early steam locomotives.

==Activities==

The hobby extends to all aspects of rail transport systems. Railfans may have one or more particular concentrations of interest, such as:

*Railway locomotives and rolling stock
*Still-used or disused railroad lines, bridges, tunnels, stations, signal boxes and other infrastructure
*Subways and other local rail transit systems
*Railway history
*Railway photography
*Railway books and magazines
*Railtours
*Railway signalling
*Playing train simulators
*Railway modelling, both physical and virtual model railroading, toy train collecting, live steam and outdoor miniature railways, and model engineering.
*Collection of railway artifacts, in particular: tickets, timetables, posters, railway paper, route maps, locomotive whistles, number plates, builder&#x27;s plates, builder&#x27;s photos, badges, uniforms, railway crockery and other railwayana. Many items, such as timetables and railway paper (i.e. internal railway documents), are collected for study and not just as collectibles.
*Railway art or architecture
*Railway operations, economics or commerce
*Railway advocacy and politics relating to railways (in some democratic countries)
*Railway preservation/restoration
*Level crossings and their infrastructure. This is where the railfan can also be interested in the railroad or &quot;grade&quot; crossing signals.
*Monitoring railroad radio communications with a radio scanner.
The scope of the subject is so large that fans may additionally concentrate their interest on a particular country, town, railway company, field of operations or era in history – or a combination of any of the above.

=== Railway photography ===


Train photography is a common activity of railfans. Most railfans do their photographing from public property, unless they have permission to use a specific private property owner&#x27;s land. Occasionally, they run into problems with law enforcement, especially due to post 9/11 security concerns, because they are sometimes viewed as suspicious. In 2004, for example, the New York City Subway attempted to institute a photo ban, which was met with fierce opposition and ultimately scrapped. In sharp contrast, the Port Authority Trans–Hudson (PATH) successfully implemented a photo ban that is still in effect (although it predated the 11 September attacks and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing); it has led to confiscations and arrests on the PATH system.

* In the United Kingdom, photography is allowed at all stations on the National Rail network. Transport for London, however, does not allow photography without permission and a permit issued by the TfL Film Office. However, photography for personal use, without ancillary equipment is allowed without a permit. The Tyne &amp; Wear Metro prohibits all photography without written permission from Nexus, the system&#x27;s operators. As of 2015, it is the only system in the UK with such a policy.
* In Singapore, private photography is allowed at any one time, except those on movie productions or wedding photoshoots, they may need approval from the public transport operators&#x27; offices.
* Spanish railroad company Renfe used to ask for a permit, but since 2018 it is not needed.
* In Greece, railway photography is permitted on all networks
* In Russia, railway photography is permitted on all networks
* In Italy, the Royal Decree n°1161 enacted on 11 July 1941, concerning &quot;military secrets&quot;, prohibited all and any photographs and video recordings in and around a number of civilian and military installations, including public railways. Railway photography was largely tolerated by tacit agreement, but could be prosecuted as a felony. The law was repealed by Legislative Decree n°66 enacted on 15 March 2010.
* In Germany, allows non-commercial photography as long as no additional equipment such as tripods are used.
* In Indonesia, Kereta Api Indonesia allows photography on a train station and inside the train as long is for private use, on a public area and without ancillary equipment such as tripod and drones. Such equipment must have additional permission from the station master or operating divisions&#x27; public relations.

=== Trainspotting ===
A trainspotter may use a data book listing the locomotives or equipment in question, in which locomotives seen are ticked off. An early trainspotter was 14-year-old Fanny Gordon, who in 1861 recorded the names of locomotives passing Westbourne Park station on the Great Western Main Line. The hobby is referenced in Edith Nesbit&#x27;s 1905 children&#x27;s book &quot;The Railway Children&quot;. In Great Britain, this aspect of the hobby was given a major impetus by the publication from 1942 onward of the Ian Allan &quot;ABC&quot; series of booklets, whose publication began in response to public requests for information about the locomotives of the Southern Railway.

=== Railway trips ===

====Bashing====
In general terms, bashing, a term used by British railway enthusiasts, describes a trip, excursion or holiday primarily involving train travel, usually with the intention of collecting mileage on a train or for covering unexplored parts of the rail network.

The practice of bashing dates back to the decline of steam locomotive operations, when more passionate trainspotters wished to note which steam engines they had travelled behind. Following the withdrawal of mainline steam in 1968, a new generation of bashers took to accumulating mileage behind diesel locomotives; the variety of diesel types, destinations to travel behind them, and the pursuit of clearing classes all fuelled the popularity of bashing. Today, despite the majority of British trains being formed of multiple units, bashing still remains a popular pastime for railway enthusiasts.

&quot;Shed bashing&quot; describes going out to as many railway sheds or depots as possible. It was very popular in the 1950s and 1960s. As they required a permit that could be hard to obtain, some &quot;shed bashers&quot; were illegal.

====Fantrips====
Many railway preservation groups run special trips for railfans using restored trains, often on &quot;rare mileage&quot; lines that do not see regular passenger service. These trips are both social events and opportunities for railfans to photograph unusual trains. Chasing a fantrip by road for the purposes of photography is often referred to as &quot;motorcading&quot; in Australia.

===Other activities===
Some enthusiasts combine their interest in trains with the hobby of monitoring radio communications, specializing in listening to radio communications of railroad operations using a scanner.

In some busy rail corridors, local governments have budgeted, constructed and maintain railfan viewing platforms, sometimes part of a park area or nearby rail museum, which they promote along with other tourist attractions. One such example is the Folkston Railfan Platform along CSX tracks in Folkston, Georgia, USA, where viewers can see regular Florida freight traffic, as well as Amtrak passenger trains, including its daily &quot;Auto Train&quot;.

In some democratic countries, such as Canada, many railfans advocate politically for expanded railway infrastructure and promote civic engagement that encourages further development of railways.

==Safety==

Owing to their presence at stations and near other areas of rail infrastructure, railfans have sometimes been requested to aid railways and legal authorities alike in observing and reporting safety breaches and incidents of crime. Railfans in the United States have been asked by BNSF to keep railroad areas safer by reporting crimes and suspicious activity.

In the United Kingdom the British Transport Police have asked trainspotters to report any unusual behaviour and activities at stations.

In the United States, concerns about terrorism have led to situations where railfans are followed or confronted by local law enforcement or transit police. This has also led to situations where certain transportation agencies have implemented photography bans systemwide.

A railfan was a factor in the 2008 Chatsworth train collision, as the engineer responsible for the accident had been distracted by texting the railfan while in charge of his train, eventually causing it to pass a signal at danger and crash into an oncoming Union Pacific freight train, killing 25 and injuring 135 others.

BNSF instituted the &quot;Citizens for Rail Security&quot; (CRS) program for the general public to report suspicious activities on their railways. Obtaining this card was common for railfans and is a derivative of the BNSF &quot;On Guard&quot; program for employees. However, this card does not recognize members as employees or contractors, asks them to keep off railway property, and is no longer obtainable. Amtrak offers a similar program, &quot;Partners for Amtrak Safety and Security&quot; (PASS).

In Japan, &quot;toritetsu&quot; have been frequently criticised for their behaviour when photographing trains, including incidents of vandalism and trespassing into restricted areas to set up cameras, destruction of lineside property and plants to clear a view of the track, stealing goods to sell on to fund expensive cameras, theft of railway equipment, being rude towards station staff and train drivers, physical assault, and attempting to intimidate passengers and road users for inadvertently interfering with their activities.

Network Rail, the British rail infrastructure owner and station operator, has produced guidelines for the behaviour and responsibilities of railway enthusiasts at its stations. In May 2010, the dangers of acting carelessly in the vicinity of an active railway were highlighted after an enthusiast, standing immediately next to a double track line photographing the &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot;, failed to notice a Bombardier Turbostar express train approaching at ~70 mph (112 km/h) on the nearer track in the other direction, and came within inches of being struck by it.

<doc id="737839" wikidata="Q2440762" url="?curid=737839" title="Exotic baryon">
<text>In particle physics, exotic baryons are a type of hadron (bound states of quarks and gluons) with half-integer spin, but with a quark content different from the three quarks (&quot;qqq&quot;) present in conventional baryons. An example would be pentaquarks, consisting of four quarks and one antiquark (&quot;qqqqq̅&quot;).

So far, the only observed exotic baryons are the pentaquarks , discovered in 2015, in 2019 and in 2022 by the LHCb collaboration.

Several types of exotic baryons that require physics beyond the Standard Model have been conjectured in order to explain specific experimental anomalies. There is no independent experimental evidence for any of these particles. One example is supersymmetric R-baryons, which are bound states of 3 quarks and a gluino. The lightest R-baryon is denoted as S and consists of an up quark, a down quark, a strange quark and a gluino. This particle is expected to be long lived or stable and has been invoked to explain ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Stable exotic baryons are also candidates for strongly interacting dark matter.
It has been speculated by futurologist Ray Kurzweil that by the end of the 21st century it might be possible by using femtotechnology to create new chemical elements composed of exotic baryons that would eventually constitute a new periodic table of elements in which the elements would have completely different properties than the regular chemical elements.

<doc id="737840" wikidata="Q467283" url="?curid=737840" title="An American Werewolf in Paris">
<text>An American Werewolf in Paris is a 1997 comedy horror film directed by Anthony Waller, screenplay by Tim Burns, Tom Stern, and Waller, and starring Tom Everett Scott and Julie Delpy. It follows the general concept of, and is a sequel to, John Landis&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;. The film is an international co-production between companies from the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.

Unlike its predecessor &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; which was distributed by Universal Pictures, this film was distributed by Buena Vista Pictures under its Hollywood Pictures label. The film was met with negative reviews from critics and grossed over $26 million against a $25 million budget at the box office.

== Plot ==
Andy McDermott is a tourist seeing the sights of Paris with his friends Brad and Chris. When Serafine Pigot leaps off the Eiffel Tower just before Andy is about to bungee jump, he executes a mid-air rescue. She vanishes into the night, leaving Andy intrigued. That night, Andy, Chris, and Brad attend Club de la Lune, a nightclub hosted by Serafine&#x27;s friend Claude. Serafine is not present, so Chris volunteers to go back to her house. He frees her from a cell in the basement and is locked in it. He escapes after finding a legless werewolf confined to a bed. The club&#x27;s owner, Claude, is actually the leader of a werewolf society that uses the club as a way to lure in people to be killed. Serafine arrives, tells Andy to run away, and transforms into a werewolf. The club owners transform into werewolves as well and butcher all the guests, including Brad.

The next day, Andy wakes up at Serafine&#x27;s house. She tells him he is transforming into a werewolf. This revelation is interrupted by the ghost of Serafine&#x27;s mother. Andy jumps out the window in panic and runs away. Chris tries to get his attention, but Claude kidnaps him. Brad&#x27;s ghost appears to Andy and explains his werewolf condition. For Andy to become normal again, he must eat the heart of the werewolf that bit him, and for Brad&#x27;s ghost to be at rest, the werewolf that killed him must be killed. After developing an appetite for raw meat, Andy hooks up with American tourist Amy Finch at a cemetery. He transforms and kills her and a cop who tailed him, suspecting Andy was involved in the Club de la Lune massacre. Andy is arrested but escapes. He begins to see Amy&#x27;s ghost, who tries to find ways to get him killed.

Claude and his henchmen capture Andy and pressure him to join their society, but Andy must kill Chris to prove his loyalty. Serafine again saves him, and they return to her home to find her basement ransacked and her stepfather, the confined werewolf, dead. Her stepfather prepared a drug to control werewolf transformations, but it had the opposite effect: forced transformation. As a result of testing on Serafine, she killed her mother and savaged her stepfather. Claude stole the drugs during the ransacking.

Andy and Serafine learn of a Fourth of July party Claude has planned and infiltrate it. They try to help the people escape but flee after seeing that police have entered. Claude and his men inject themselves with the drug and slaughter almost all the guests. Andy and Serafine flee after killing a werewolf and setting Brad&#x27;s spirit free. Serafine takes the drug to fight another werewolf when they become separated. Andy encounters them and, not knowing who is who, accidentally shoots her, leaving her to be found by the police. A werewolf then attacks him, chasing him down to an underground train track. The train stops due to it hitting the werewolf. It gets on the train where it attacks the driver and several passengers. The drug wears off, revealing Claude as the werewolf. Claude tries to inject himself with the last vial but is interrupted by Andy. In the ensuing fight, Andy finds that Claude is the culprit behind his infection. The two struggle to obtain the last vial of the drug, and Andy is accidentally injected. After transforming, Andy kills Claude and eats his heart, thus ending his own curse and presumably Serafine&#x27;s (this point is not clarified since earlier in the movie Serafine implied that Claude had stolen &quot;her&quot; blood to become a werewolf. In an alternate ending, after Andy eats Claude&#x27;s heart, Serafine has a vision of her stepfather in the back of an ambulance, explaining how he found a cure before his death). An ambulance transports her to the hospital.

Serafine and Andy celebrate their wedding atop the Statue of Liberty with Andy&#x27;s pal Chris, who survived. They bungee jump off when Chris accidentally drops the wedding ring from the statue.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
The film&#x27;s title has its roots in the production of its predecessor; when production of the original &quot;London&quot; film ran into trouble with British Equity, director John Landis, having scouted locations in Paris, considered moving the production to France and changing the title of his film to &quot;An American Werewolf in Paris&quot;.

Landis was approached by PolyGram Pictures to develop a sequel to the first movie, as Landis explained in the book &quot;Beware the Moon: The Story of An American Werewolf in London&quot;:I was asked to do a sequel by PolyGram in 1991. The company, under Jon Peters and Peter Guber, made something like 10 or 12 movies, and the only one that made money was American Werewolf. They then left the company and were replaced by a guy called Michael Kuhn. He called me and said that they were interested in making a sequel. I entertained the idea for a little bit and then came up with something that I liked and wrote a first draft of the script.

Landis&#x27;s draft focused on Debbie Klein (a character mentioned but never seen or heard in the original film) getting a job in London, and her subsequent investigation into the deaths of David and Jack. Several characters from the original film, including Alex Price, Dr. Hirsch, and Sgt. McManus returned, but the studio turned down the script. Polygram Pictures still wanted to do a sequel, but Landis, unwilling to write a second treatment, told them to just make the sequel without him.

Around the same time, writer/director John Lafia had written and submitted his own draft to the studio. The storyline for Lafia&#x27;s draft focused on a schoolteacher in Paris who holds forth on good and evil in a class he teaches. The teacher is bitten by a lycanthrope and goes through the expected changes, while on his trail is the doctor from the first film, who has been working on a werewolf serum. In a December 1990 interview in &quot;Fangoria&quot; #99, Lafia had stated that the studio was not interested in his script: &quot;As it stands now it will most likely never be made, which is too bad. Maybe I&#x27;ll retitle it and call it The Howling VII: The Intelligent Version&quot;.

After Lafia left the project, Tom Stern and Tim Burns, who had previously worked on the short-lived MTV series &quot;The Idiot Box&quot; and the 1993 comedy film &quot;Freaked&quot;, were hired to write a new script, with Stern set as director. Stern and Burns&#x27;s script followed a young American named Andy McDermott, who is vacationing in Spain when he is called to Paris after hearing that his uncle was savaged by a mysterious beast there. In keeping with the tradition of &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;, Stern and Burns loaded the script with as many songs referring to the moon as they could find. As part of the preproduction process, Stern had makeup effects (FX) artists Steve Johnson and Tony Gardner work on preliminary designs for the monster, and Phil Tippett, who had worked on Jurassic Park, was going to use computer graphics to bring the beast to life for full-body shots, while the closeups would be handled by the makeup FX crew using animatronic heads. Once they turned in their script to the studio, the studio informed Stern that while they liked the script, he was no longer going to be directing the film. Stern said in an interview: &quot;They were planning to do it on, a medium-low budget, around $10-12 million, and they felt comfortable with me directing it at that level. Then when I handed it in, they liked it so much that they wanted to do it on a higher budget, and they needed a big-name director they could use the foreign presales, since Polygram, which owns Propaganda, is a foreign company.&quot;

Marco Brambilla, whose film &quot;Demolition Man&quot; was a major international hit, was brought on to take over directing. According to Stern, Brambilla&#x27;s approach was going to involve the traditional half-man, half-wolf look, with FX to be created by Amalgamated Dynamics.

After a meeting with Brambilla, both Stern and Burns left and moved on to other projects, with Burns stating: &quot;There wasn’t any shouting or anything... but it was such a strange feeling. We’d been working on this for a year and a half, and put all this thought into it. He&#x27;d been on it for a week and was saying &#x27;I don&#x27;t think the ending works&#x27; and &#x27;this scene&#x27;s got to go&#x27;.&quot; Stern added, &quot;We took pride in writing a villain that was somewhat charming and had a compelling argument because the great villains are the ones that have a great pitch and make you think &#x27;wow, I can see the logic to this.&#x27; He just wanted a cartoon villain that was twirling his moustache and being all &#x27;ultimate evil&#x27;.&quot;

The project fell into limbo for about two years. During that time, 12 screenwriters, including Larry Brothers, Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade did rewrites on Stern and Burn&#x27;s script, with Purvis and Wade contributing the danger tour and the bungee jump off the Eiffel Tower. During the hiatus, Brambilla left, and was replaced by Anthony Waller, who had gained a cult following for his low-budget thriller &quot;Mute Witness&quot;. Upon joining the project, Waller rewrote the script. After the arbitration process, the final screenplay credit went to Stern, Burns, and Waller.

=== Locations ===
Filming took place in Amsterdam, Luxembourg, Metz, and New York City, and on location in Paris.

=== Alternate endings ===
In an alternate ending, after Andy eats Claude&#x27;s heart, Serafine has a vision of her stepfather in the back of an ambulance, explaining how he found a cure before his death. The closing scene shows Andy and Chris visiting Serafine at a hospital, where she has given birth to a child, whose eyes shift to look like the werewolves&#x27;; another version of the alternate ending features Inspector LeDuc (in Chris&#x27;s place) at the hospital.

== Release ==
&quot;An American Werewolf in Paris&quot; opened theatrically in the United Kingdom on October 31, 1997, in the United States on December 25, and in France on May 6, 1998.

=== Box office ===
In its opening weekend, the film ranked seventh in the United States and Canada box office and third among new releases, earning $7.6 million. By the end of its run, &quot;Paris&quot; grossed $26.6 million from a $25 million budget.

=== Critical reception ===

Upon its release, &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film two out of four stars, citing unfunny gags, a &quot;charmless&quot; performance by lead actor Tom Everett Scott, and a failure to tap into the Parisian setting, though they praised Anthony Waller&#x27;s direction. Russell Smith of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; called &quot;An American Werewolf in Paris&quot; &quot;a fast-paced, entertaining homage that recaptures a fair amount of the old lunatic energy and subversive humor [of the original].&quot; While he criticized that the characters often seem clueless in the face of obvious danger, he found the film offered a great deal of fun and that the transformation effects, while not enhanced by the usage of CGI, are &quot;repulsively convincing&quot;. He gave it two and a half out of five stars. Writing for &quot;ReelViews&quot;, James Berardinelli derided the film&#x27;s sitcom-level comedy, unintentionally humorous scares, and gratuitous nudity, but said the emotionally compelling performance by Julie Delpy and the occasional strong directorial strokes prevent it from succeeding as campy, &quot;so bad it&#x27;s good&quot; entertainment. He gave it one and a half out of four stars.

Unlike its predecessor, which had Oscar-winning special make-up effects by Rick Baker, &quot;Paris&quot; relied heavily on CGI for its transformation effects and chase sequences, a common point of derision from most critics.
The film was nominated for Worst Sequel at the 1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, but lost to &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot;.

John Landis, the director of &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;, said, &quot;I was really disappointed when I saw that film, I thought it was lousy&quot;.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 7% based on reviews from 30 critics, with an average rating of 3.72/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Markedly inferior to its cult classic predecessor in every way, &quot;An American Werewolf in Paris&quot; is felled by the silver bullets of clumsy storytelling and chintzy special effects.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 31 out of 100 based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B-&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

== Soundtrack ==

A soundtrack for &quot;An American Werewolf in Paris&quot; was released on CD and cassette tape through Hollywood Records on September 23, 1997. It featured music from artists such as Bush, Better Than Ezra, and Cake. The film&#x27;s soundtrack is largely responsible for the Bush song &quot;Mouth&quot; releasing as a single in October 1997, as it was featured prominently in the film and trailer. The single, marked as a release from the soundtrack, charted on several &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, including the Mainstream Rock Tracks and Modern Rock Tracks charts.

The soundtrack was on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s &quot;Top Album Sales chart for five weeks but, at its peak, only placed at number 80.

Although appearing in the film, the Smash Mouth song &quot;Walkin&#x27; on the Sun&quot; is not on the soundtrack.

<doc id="737841" wikidata="Q2670027" url="?curid=737841" title="House of Representatives (Indonesia)">
<text>The House of Representatives of the Republic of Indonesia (, DPR-RI or simply DPR) is one of two elected chambers of the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPR), the national legislature of Indonesia. It is considered the lower house, while the Regional Representative Council (DPD) serves as the upper house; while the Indonesian constitution does not explicitly mention the divide, the DPR enjoys more power, privilege, and prestige compared to the DPD.

Members of the DPR are elected through a general election every five years. Currently, there are 580 members; an increase compared to 575 prior to the 2024 elections. Its members are called Members of Parliament (&quot;anggota dewan&quot;).

== History ==
===&quot;Volksraad&quot;===
In 1915, members of the Indonesian nationalist organisation Budi Utomo and others toured the Netherlands to argue for the establishment of a legislature for the Dutch East Indies, and in December 1916 a bill was passed to establish a &quot;Volksraad&quot; (People&#x27;s Council). It met for the first time in 1918. Ten of its nineteen members elected by local councils were Indonesians, as were five of the nineteen appointed members. However, it had only advisory powers, although the governor-general had to consult it on financial matters. The body grew in size to 60 members, half of who were elected by a total of 2,228 people.

In 1925, the &quot;Volksraad&quot; gained some legislative powers. It had to agree to the budget and internal legislation, and could sponsor laws of its own. However, it had no power to remove the governor general and remained nothing more than a gesture.

In 1940, after the German invasion of the Netherlands, and the fleeing of the Dutch government to exile in London, there was a motion calling for an inquiry into turning it into a quasi-legislature, but this was withdrawn after a negative response from the government. In July 1941, the &quot;Volksraad&quot; passed a motion calling for the creation of a militia made up of up to 6,000 Indonesians. In February 1942, the Japanese invasion began, and in May 1942 the Dutch formally dissolved the &quot;Volksraad&quot;. It was replaced by a council made up of heads of departments.

===Japanese occupation===
The Japanese invaded Dutch East Indies in 1942. By 1943, the tide had turned against them, and to encourage support for the war effort, the Japanese appointed Indonesian advisors (&quot;sanyo&quot;) to the administration and appointed Sukarno leader of a new Central Advisory Board (&quot;Chuo Sangi-kai&quot;) in Jakarta. In March 1945, the Japanese established the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence () or BPUPK, chaired by Radjiman Wediodiningrat, with Sukarno, Hatta and Thamrin among its members. This body drew up a constitution for an independent Indonesia over several weeks of meetings. At a session of the committee on 1 June 1945, Sukarno laid down the principles of Pancasila by which an Indonesia would be governed.

On 7 August, the day after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence () or PPKI was established. Sukarno was chairman, and Hatta vice-chairman. The two proclaimed the Independence of Indonesia on 17 August. On 18 August, the PPKI accepted the constitution drawn up by the BPUPK as the provisional Constitution of Indonesia and decided that during a six-month transition period, the new republic would be governed according to the constitution by a president, assisted by a National Committee, who would establish the two chamber legislature mandated by the constitution. The upper chamber, the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly would then have six months to draw up a new constitution, leaving open the possibility that this would be an entirely new document free of the influence of the situation prevailing during World War II. The PPKI also named Sukarno as president and Hatta vice-president.

===National Revolution===
The Central Indonesian National Committee () or KNIP was a body appointed to assist the president of the newly independent Indonesia, Sukarno, on 29 August 1945. It was originally planned to have a purely advisory function, but on 18 October, Vice-president Hatta issued Edict No.X transferring the powers the Constitution conferred on the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly and House of Representatives from the president to the KNIP. The day-to-day tasks of the KNIP would be carried out by a Working Committee whose first leaders were Sutan Sjahrir and Amir Sjarifuddin.

During the War of Independence, the entire KNIP was unable to meet regularly. Therefore, the KNIP acted as the upper house, the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly in the constitution, meeting only infrequently to discuss fundamental and pressing national issues, while the Working Committee acted as the day-to-day parliament fulfilling the duties of the House of Representatives during wartime.

===Federal legislature===

In January 1948, the Dutch authorities established the Provisional Federal Council for Indonesia (&quot;Voorlopige Federale Raad voor Indonesia&quot;) comprising Lieutenant Governor Hubertus van Mook and eight Indonesians chosen by him to represent the views of Indonesia. Two months later, the council made up of heads of departments that the Dutch had set up to replace the pre-war &quot;Volksraad&quot; officially became the Provisional Federal Government (&quot;Voorlopige Federale Regering&quot;). This body invited heads of the states making up the United States of Indonesia to send delegates to the Federal Conference in Bandung in May 1948. That month, leaders of states and other areas joined to establish the Federal Consultative Assembly (&quot;Bijeenkomst voor Federaal Overleg&quot; or BFO) to represent the federal regions.

Following the transfer of sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia (RIS), in December 1949, the state adopted a bicameral system, with a 150-member House of Representatives (DPR-RIS) and a Senate with two representatives from each of the 16 component areas of the RIS. Initially the House of Representatives had 50 MPs appointed from the Republic of Indonesia and 100 MPs coming from the other 15 component states of the RIS. The plan was for elections within a year. The KNIP and its Working Committee had its final sessions held before adjorning &quot;sine die&quot; on 15 December 1949 to agree to the Republic of Indonesia joining the RIS, and the planned 50 would transfer to the new RIS House of Representatives.

This House of Representatives had its opening session on 15 February 1950 at the former Sociëteit Concordia Building on Jalan Wahidin, Jakarta. Most of the sessions were held in this building, but it also met at other buildings, including the Hotel Des Indies. The DPR-RIS passed seven laws in its six months of existence, but was soon overtaken by events as the federal system collapsed as the individual states dissolved themselves into the unitary Republic of Indonesia. The House adjourned for the last time on 16 August the same year.

===Liberal democracy===
Given that the Republic of Indonesia did not want the RIS parliament to become the legislature of the unitary republic, in May 1950, Hatta and representatives from the federal states agreed to establish a new legislature comprising the 150 members of the RIS House of Representatives, 46 members of the KNIP Working Committee, 13 from the Republic of Indonesia Supreme Advisory Council and 32 RIS senators, making 241 members. On 17 August 1950, the RIS was formally dissolved and the unitary Republic of Indonesia came into being.

The Provisional House of Representatives met for the first time on 16 August 1950. By then there had been minor changes to the agreed composition as three RIS senators had refused to take their seats and 21 representatives from the State of Pasundan were replaced by 19 members appointed by the Republic. Of the 236 members, only 204 took their oaths of office on 20 August, and only 170 voted in the election of the speaker, which was narrowly won by Sartono of the Indonesian National Party (PNI). Masyumi was the largest parliamentary party with 49 seats. Its main rival, the PNI had 36 seats and no other party had more than 17.

In 1952, the DPR demanded a reorganisation of the Ministry of Defense and the dismissal of the Army leadership in response to military opposition to troop reductions. This led to the &#x27;17 October 1952&#x27; incident with large-scale demonstrations at the presidential palace by soldiers and civilians demanding the DPR be dissolved. The crowd dispersed after Sukarno addressed it.

Despite the election bill being introduced in 1951, it was not passed until 1953 and elections were finally held in 1955. The results surprised everybody. The Indonesian Socialist Party (PSI) did worse than expected, as did Masyumi, while the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) did better than predicted. Following the election, the PNI and Masyumi had 57 seats each, the Nahdlatul Ulama had 45 and the PKI 39. There were now 28 parties in parliament, compared with 20 before the election. Only 63 of the 257 pre-election members of parliament still maintain their seats, but there were 15 women members compared with eight before. The new parliament met on 26 March 1956, forming the first elected House of Representatives (1956–1959).
Over the next few years, public dissatisfaction with the political parties grew. In 1957, Sukarno announced his concept of a national unity cabinet and a National Council made up of functional groups to advise the cabinet. This council was established in May 1957. On 5 July 1959, Sukarno issued a decree, which as well as reviving the provisional 1945 Constitution, dissolved parliament.

The new DPR took office on 22 July 1959. It accepted the president&#x27;s decree by acclamation and said it was ready to work as stipulated by the 1945 Constitution. However, in March 1960 it unexpectedly rejected the government&#x27;s budget. Sukarno then dissolved it as it was seen as no longer fulfilling the president&#x27;s hopes that it would work with him in the spirit of the 1945 Constitution, Guided Democracy and the Political manifesto (&quot;Manipol&quot;, referring to Sukarno&#x27;s 1959 Independence Day speech). The DPR session adjourned on 24 June &quot;sine die&quot;.

===Guided Democracy===

Sukarno then used this difference of opinion with the legislature as justification for the establishment of a Mutual Assistance House of Representatives (, DPR-GR). The membership was no longer based on the results of the 1955 election, but was determined by the president, who could appoint and dismiss members at will, as well as its speaker. Political opponents were sidelined, and some who opposed the establishment of the DPR-GR refused to take their seats. As Masyumi and the Indonesian Socialist Party did not agree with Sukarno, they were given no seats, meaning there was no longer a parliamentary opposition. A number of representatives from various functional groups including the National Armed Forces were also appointed to the House. As of mid-1962, there were 281 MPs; 130 from 10 political parties, 150 sectoral representatives and 1 representative from West Irian.

The responsibilities and duties of the parliament were dramatically curtailed as it was reduced to helping the government implement its policies. In 1960 it produced only 9 laws, compared with 87 in 1958 and 29 in 1959. It became little more than a rubber stamp for Sukarno&#x27;s policies. For example, it passed a law allowing volunteers to be sent to participate in the Confrontation with Malaysia.

===New Order===
Following the coup attempt of the 30 September Movement in 1965, which was officially blamed on the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), the DPR-GR was purged of PKI members – 57 communist members were removed from their seats. On 14 November parliament resumed without the PKI MPs, including deputy speaker M.H. Lukman. In 1969, the government passed an election law that set the membership of the DPR at 360 elected and 100 appointed MPs. The number of representatives from the military increased to 75 - including police officers. Elections were finally held in 1971, having been delayed to allow preparations to ensure a victory for the government&#x27;s Golkar organisation.

Following the election, the words &quot;Gotong Royong&quot; were removed and the body became the &quot;Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat&quot; again. In 1973 the remaining political parties were reduced to two, the United Development Party and the Indonesian Democratic Party. For the remainder of the New Order, Golkar won absolute majorities at every elections, while the parliament did not produce a single law on its own initiative, its role being reduced to passing laws proposed by the government.

===Reform era===

In May 1998, President Suharto stepped down, leading to Indonesia&#x27;s first free elections since 1955 taking place the following year. Of the 500 seats, 462 were elected, while 38 seats were reserved for the military/police. In the 2004 elections, all 550 seats were elected. In the 2009 elections the number of seats was increased to 560, and for the 2019 elections this rose to 575. There are now no appointed military officers in the legislature.

==Powers==
As is common in countries with presidential system, the President does not hold the power to suspend or dissolve the DPR. On the other hand, the legislature does not have full control over the President or the government in whole.

===The Three Functions===
Under Article 20A of the amended 1945 Constitution, the DPR has three main functions: legislative, budgeting, and oversight. The legislative function of the DPR consists of:

* Drafting the &quot;Program Legislasi Nasional&quot; or &quot;Prolegnas&quot; (lists of prioritized drafts and bills);
* Drafting and holding deliberations on the &quot;Rancangan Undang-Undang&quot; or the bills of law;
* Receiving the bills of law proposed by the DPD, especially on the subjects of regional autonomy; Central-Regional governance relations; creations, proliferations, and mergers of regional territories; management of regional resources; and Central-Regional fiscal balance;
* Holding deliberations on the bills of law proposed either by the President or by the DPD; 
* Jointly passing the bills of law into Law with the President;
* Passing or rejecting the &quot;Peraturan Pemerintah Pengganti Undang-Undang&quot; (Perppu) or Government Regulation in-lieu-of Law enacted by the President. If passed, the Perppu is enshrined as Law.

The budgeting function of the DPR consists of:

* Approving and passing into Law the &quot;Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Negara&quot; (APBN) or National Budget proposed by the President;
* Taking into considerations the opinions of the DPD, especially on the subjects of taxes, education, and religious affairs;
* Following up the state financial accountability reports made by the &quot;Badan Pemeriksa Keuangan&quot; (BPK) or Audit Board of Indonesia;
* Approving the transfers of any state assets and properties which are considered impactful on the people and the national finance.

The oversight function of the DPR consists of:

* Overseeing the execution of the Laws, National Budget, and government policies;
* Holding deliberations and following up on the oversights exercised by the DPD, especially on the subjects of regional autonomy; Central-Regional governance relations; creations, proliferations, and mergers of regional territories; management of regional resources; Central-Regional fiscal balance; execution of the National Budget; and on the subjects of taxes, education, and religious affairs.

=== The Rights ===
The 1945 Constitution guarantees several rights of the DPR. Especially in regard to the oversight function, they include the right to question the government regarding any government policy considered important, strategic, and impactful (&quot;Hak Interpelasi&quot;); the right to investigate allegations of breach of the Laws by government policy (&quot;Hak Angket&quot;); and the right to express opinions (&quot;Hak Menyatakan Pendapat&quot;) on any government policy, on extraordinary domestic or foreign events, on the follow up of the exercise of the rights to question and to investigate government policy, as well as on the initial impeachment process of the President and/or the Vice President.

The MPs themselves are vested with rights in order to execute their duties. They include:

* Right to propose drafts and bills of Laws;
* Right to question the government and its officials;
* Right to express opinions and offer suggestions;
* Right to elect and be elected into parliamentary duties;
* Right to defend oneself on alleged violations of parliamentary code of ethics;
* Right of immunity from prosecution due to any statements, questions, and opinions made for the purpose of parliamentary duties, except in violation of parliamentary code of ethics and code of conducts; 
* Right to be assigned certain stately protocols;
* Right to financial and administrative benefits;
* Right to oversee the execution of the National Budget, as well as the interests of the people and their constituency;
* Right to propose and promote programs for the benefit of their constituency;
* Right to promote and inform the creation of a new Law.

==Current composition==
The House of Representatives has 580 members resulting from the 2024 legislative election. The representatives come from 8 political parties.

== Structure ==
=== Leadership ===

The DPR leadership consist of a Speaker and four Deputy Speakers. The most recent Speaker&#x27;s election was conducted under provisions of Law No. 13/2019 (Amendment) of the Law No. 17/2014 on the MPR, DPR, DPRD, and DPRD; popularly known as UU MD3.

== The Opposition ==
The Opposition is a term used to describe political parties which are represented in the DPR, but not in the cabinet, and thus organized themselves as an opposition faction. However it is not a formal term and they considered themselves a &#x27;critical partner of the government&#x27;.

During the 2019 Election, the incumbent president Joko Widodo (&#x27;Jokowi&#x27;) led a majority coalition of ten parties which already supported him during the previous 2014 Election. Opposing him is Prabowo Subianto, who led a minority coalition of five parties. Eventually after the election, the Jokowi Administration invited Gerindra and PAN into the governing coalition, appointing Subianto as Defence Minister.

Under the current Prabowo Administration, there is no opposition parties in the DPR. The opposition coalition effectively went into dormancy.

==Criticism==
The DPR has been the subject of frequent public criticism due to perceived high levels of fraud and corruption.

== Buildings of the legislature ==
Throughout its history, the legislature has convened in multiple buildings.
=== &quot;Volksraad&quot; ===
The Volksraad convened in the &quot;Volksraadgebouw&quot; (Building of the Volksraad) since 1918 until 1942 during Japanese occupation when it was dissolved. Today the building is known as &quot;Gedung Pancasila&quot;, located within the Foreign Ministry complex, and is still used for hosting important state events.

=== Central Indonesian National Committee ===
In August 1945, the KNIP was established to assist the President in the early days of Indonesian independence. Soon after, KNIP was granted legislative powers and would function as a legislature until a democratically elected national legislature can be formed. Meanwhile, the presidential system was replaced by parliamentary system, and Sutan Syahrir was appointed as the first prime minister of Indonesia. Due to the unstable situation during those days, the KNIP was unable to convene in single, permanent place.
The first meeting of the KNIP following its inauguration was held on 29 August in &quot;Schouwburg Weltevreden&quot;, today known as &quot;Gedung Kesenian Jakarta&quot; (Jakarta Art Building). Due to lack of available working space, the secretariat was run from the defunct &quot;Jawa Hokokai&quot; headquarters close to Lapangan Banteng. Meanwhile, second meeting of the KNIP was held on 16 and 17 October in old &quot;Binnenhof Hotel&quot; in Kramat Raya street, Jakarta. The secretariat was also moved, this time to a building in Cilacap street, now occupied by a Marriott hotel. Third meeting of the KNIP was held in a building in Prince Diponegoro street, now known as PSKD 1 Senior High School, situated right across the &quot;Centraal Burgerlijke Ziekenhuis&quot; (which now constitutes part of the Cipto Mangunkusumo Central Hospital).

Fourth meeting of the KNIP was held not in Jakarta, but in Surakarta in Central Java. It was held in Gedung Republik Indonesia, from 28 February until 3 March. The Working Committee (the permanent standing committee of the KNIP) and the secretariat later moved to &quot;Hotel van Laar&quot; in Purworejo, provided by the regent of Purworejo. Fifth meeting of the KNIP was held on 25 February until 3 March 1946 in &quot;Societeit Concordia Building&quot; in Malang, East Java. Following the fifth meeting, the Working Committee and the secretariat again moved to Yogyakarta, temporarily occupying an Indonesian Red Cross building, before later moved to &quot;Loge Theosofie&quot; Building (part of &quot;Gedung Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah Yogyakarta&quot;) in Malioboro, occupying it until 1950. Few years later, the sixth meeting of the KNIP was held on 6th until 15 December 1949 in Sitihinggil Keraton (part of the Yogyakarta Kraton).

=== Federal legislature ===

Following the agreement reached during the 1949 Round Table Conference, a federal constitution was drafted for Indonesia, and thus KNIP was dissolved and replaced by the DPR-RIS. The Parliament was now able to settle down, although the venues might move. Established along with it was the Federal Senate, which served as an upper house, separate from the DPR-RIS. This parliament was inaugurated on 16 February 1950 in Societeit Concordia Building in Jakarta, now located within the Finance Ministry complex (not to be confused with Societeit Concordia Building in Bandung, now known as Gedung Merdeka). Following the inauguration, meetings were held instead in the upper floor of Hotel Des Indes. The hotel was later demolished in 1971 and replaced by Duta Merlin Shopping Center on its site.

=== Liberal democracy legislature ===

After the federal system collapsed and Indonesia returned to its unitary form in 1950, a provisional constitution established a provisional parliament (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Sementara/DPRS), as well as a constitutional assembly (Konstituante) for drafting a new, permanent constitution for Indonesia. The DPRS convened in Jakarta, while the Konstituante convened in Societeit Concordia Building in Bandung.

The DPRS was finally replaced by a proper DPR after September 1955 election was held, followed shortly with the December 1955 election for electing members of the Konstituante.

=== Guided Democracy legislature ===
Following years of political instability, as well as the Konstituante&#x27;s failure to draft a new constitution, in 1959 President Sukarno assumed executive powers and ordered to return to the 1945 Constitution, dismantling the parliamentary system of governance that had run since KNIP was granted legislative powers in 1945. Through executive orders and decisions, the provisional People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat Sementara/MPRS), the national legislature of Indonesia as prescribed by the 1945 Constitution, was finally established alongside various other constitutional bodies.

The DPR based on 1955 election was later dissolved in 1960, and replaced with DPR-GR (GR stands for Gotong Royong), whose members were appointed by the President. The DPR-GR first used the Societeit Concordia Building in Jakarta to convene and then moved to Gedung Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat near Lapangan Banteng, while the MPRS convened in Gedung Merdeka in Bandung. Because most members of the MPRS were residents of Jakarta, a branch secretariat of the MPRS was established in Jakarta and occupied Stannia Building on Cik Ditiro street.

In 1964 DPR-GR moved to convene in a temporary building within Senayan Sport Complex while the DPR Building went under renovation. This temporary building previously served as the headquarter for 1962 Asian Games construction and development office (Komando Urusan Pembangunan Asian Games/KUPAG). Events following the September 30th Movement in 1965, however, moved the renovation process to a halt. The DPR-GR was forced to use the basketball court building previously used in 1964 Asian Games. The 1966 MPRS General Session and 1967 MPRS Special Session was held in the Gedung Istana Olah Raga (Istora).

=== New Order legislature ===
After the 1962 Asian Games, President Sukarno ordered the construction of a building complex next to Senayan Sport Complex, to be used as a political venues for a &quot;Conference of the New Emerging Forces&quot; (CONEFO) to rival the United Nations, and international games to be held next door as GANEFO to rival the Olympics. The chief architect for this project was Soejoedi Wirjoatmodjo, a graduate of Technische Universität Berlin and head of the Department of Architecture in Bandung Institute of Technology.

The constructions was halted following President Sukarno&#x27;s fall from power, and the project later resumed under Suharto presidency, when it was officially promulgated with &quot;Ampera Cabinet Presidium Decision No. 79/U/Kep/11/1966&quot;, dated 9 November 1966 that the old CONEFO political venues project were to be repurposed for the national legislature.

The construction proceeded gradually; Main Conference Building completed in March 1968, Secretariat Building in March 1978, Auditorium Building in September 1982, and Banquet Building in February 1983.

The MPR/DPR Complex in Senayan, Jakarta remains the seat of Indonesia&#x27;s legislature to this day.
=== &quot;Reformasi&quot; legislature ===
With the fall of President Soeharto and his New Order regime, a wave of political and social reform appeared in Indonesia, primarily in the form of four amendments of the 1945 Constitutions. A new chamber of the legislature, Dewan Perwakilan Daerah (Regional Representative Council), was established and occupied the same site as MPR and DPR.

During Widodo Administration, a plan to move the national capital to Kalimantan was announced. The legislatures are planned to be moved there alongside many other central government bodies.

<text>The Tornados (the Tornadoes in North America) were an English instrumental rock group of the 1960s that acted as backing group for many of record producer Joe Meek&#x27;s productions and also for singer Billy Fury. They enjoyed several chart hits in their own right, including the UK and US no. 1 &quot;Telstar&quot; (named after the satellite and composed and produced by Meek), the first US no. 1 single by a British group. 

== History ==
The Tornados were formed in 1961 as a session band for Joe Meek, although the name did not come until early 1962. In 1961 they provided the instrumentals for the film short &quot;The Johnny Leyton Touch&quot;, including a jazzed up version of &quot;Taboo&quot;, originally by Margarita Lecuona. From January 1962 to August 1963, the Tornados were the backing band for Billy Fury (as well as recording and performing as an act in their own right); they toured and recorded with Fury as the Tornados. Their recordings with Fury were produced by Mike Smith and Ivor Raymonde.

The Tornados made a scopitone film (an early form of music video) for &quot;Telstar&quot; and another for their chart hit &quot;Robot&quot; featuring members of the group walking around a woodland dressed in appropriate headgear with their guitars, flirting with various young women and being finally arrested by policemen after lighting a campfire.

For a time the Tornados were considered serious rivals to the Shadows. The Tornados&#x27; single &quot;Globetrotter&quot; made it to no. 5 in the UK Singles Chart. However, pop instrumentals began to lose a following with the British audience during 1963 as the &quot;Mersey Sound&quot;, from the Beatles and other groups, began to take root. In the summer of 1963, Joe Meek induced the Tornados&#x27; bassist Heinz Burt to start a solo career, as the Tornados&#x27; chart success as an instrumental outfit waned, and from that point onwards the Tornados began to fall apart. By 1965 none of the original line-up remained.

On some promotional items, later line-ups were credited as &quot;Tornados &#x27;65&quot; and &quot;The New Tornados&quot;, but these names were never used on the Tornados&#x27; releases. In the mid-1960s the Tornados backed Billy Fury again, with Dave Watts on keyboards, Robby Gale on guitar and John Davies on drums. In 1968, in Israel to perform in Mandy Rice-Davies&#x27; night club Mandys, the band stayed for a ten-week tour after which they disbanded, leaving Watts and Huxley in Israel, playing with The Lions of Judea and The Churchills, respectively.

=== Later years ===
After drummer and bandleader Clem Cattini left the Tornados in 1965, he became a successful session musician, playing on recording sessions for other artists, and was featured in Cliff Richard&#x27;s backing bands. He holds the record for appearing the most times on UK no. 1 singles.

The rhythm guitarist, George Bellamy, is the father of Matt Bellamy of the alternative rock band Muse.

They re-formed as The New Tornados in the early 1970s as the backing group for Marty Wilde, Billy Fury and others on a year-long UK Rock n Roll Tour. They continued for another few years with lead guitarist Antz Cowell, bassist Willie Bath, saxophonist Robin Foster and drummer Jon Werrell. They also toured with original members Norman Hale and Heinz Burt, plus &quot;The King of Rock Roll&quot; Carl Simmons. The group was often part of a 1960s package with other artists, including Wee Willie Harris and Screaming Lord Sutch.

During a break in touring, Jon Werrell loaned his Silver Premier drum kit to John Bonham when Led Zeppelin played their famous impromptu December 1975 gig at Behans St Helier while tax exiles in Jersey.

In 1975, Clem Cattini, Roger LaVern, Heinz Burt and George Bellamy reunited and released a version of &quot;Telstar&quot; as the &#x27;Original Tornados&#x27;. In the 1970s, Billy Fury formed a new backing band called Fury&#x27;s Tornados with a completely unrelated line-up. They also recorded and released a version of &quot;Telstar&quot; in the mid-1970s.

In 1996, Ray Randall wrote and recorded a three-track CD with Bryan Irwin and Stuart Taylor, using the band name Ray Randall&#x27;s Tornados, as a tribute to the late Joe Meek, 30 years after Meek&#x27;s death. Randall has since recorded a solo album entitled &quot;Polly Swallow&quot; (1997).

In 2007, Panda Bear sampled two Tornados songs on his album &quot;Person Pitch&quot;.

=== &quot;Do You Come Here Often?&quot; ===
The B-side of the final single that the group released, in 1966, &quot;Do You Come Here Often?&quot;, is considered to be the first openly &quot;gay&quot; pop record release by a UK major label. It started off as a standard organ-inspired instrumental, but Joe Meek decided that the organ playing was a little too jazzy for the style of the group. To remedy this, around two-thirds in, a casual conversation between what appears to be two gay men (Dave Watts playing keyboards and Robb Huxley playing guitar) was overdubbed. The song was featured, along with other gay-flavoured releases, on a 2006 compilation CD, &quot;Queer Noises&quot;.

<text>Adel al-Jubeir (; born 1 February 1962) is a Saudi diplomat serving as the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs since 2018. He also serves as a Member of the Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia and has been the Climate Affairs Envoy since 2022. Notably, he is the second non-royal to hold the office of the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, succeeding Ibrahim bin Abdullah Al Suwaiyel. Previously, al-Jubeir was the Saudi Ambassador to the United States from 2007 to 2015 and a foreign policy advisor to King Abdullah.

==Early life==
Al-Jubeir was born in Al Majma&#x27;ah, Riyadh Province, Saudi Arabia. He attended schools in Saudi Arabia, Germany, Yemen, Lebanon and the U.S. He obtained a B.A. summa cum laude in political science and economics from the University of North Texas in 1982, and an M.A. in international relations from Georgetown University in 1984. In 2006, he received an Honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters from the University of North Texas.

==Political career==
In 1987, Al-Jubeir was appointed into the Saudi Diplomatic Service and posted to the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington, DC, where he served as Special Assistant to then Ambassador Prince Bandar bin Sultan. In 1991, during the first Gulf War, Al-Jubeir first appeared to the world as a spokesman for the Saudi government. In 1990–91, he was part of the Saudi team that established the Joint Information Bureau at Dhahran, a city in Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Eastern Province, during Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm. He was a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council delegation to the Madrid Peace Conference in October 1991, and a member of the Saudi delegation to the Multilateral Arms Control Talks in Washington, DC in 1992. In December 1992, he was dispatched with the Armed Forces of Saudi Arabia to Somalia as part of Operation Restore Hope.

Al-Jubeir was a member of the Saudi Arabian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, and was a visiting diplomatic fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City, 1994–95. During his tenure at the Saudi embassy, Al-Jubeir developed strong ties on Capitol Hill, in the Administration, the media and with major think tanks in Washington. In 2000, Al-Jubeir became Director of the Saudi Information and Congressional Affairs Office at the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington, DC. In late 2000, he was named Foreign Affairs Advisor in the Crown Prince&#x27;s Court. In August 2005, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz appointed Al-Jubeir to the position of Advisor at the Royal Court.

Following the September 11 attacks, Al-Jubeir returned to the United States to address the many questions and criticisms that faced the Kingdom at that time. Al-Jubeir became the face of Saudi Arabia through hundreds of television appearances as well as other media interviews and visited more than 25 cities across the country where he gave talks to World Affairs Councils, universities, civic organizations, business institutions and other interested groups about current events and the state of Saudi/U.S. relations.
While on diplomatic mission in Budapest, Adel al-Jubeir gave a lecture on Saudi Foreign Policy and Reforms Of Vision 2030.

==Diplomatic career==

On 29 January 2007 Al-Jubeir was appointed as Saudi Ambassador to the United States of America with the rank of Minister. As ambassador, Al-Jubeir focused on strengthening the bilateral relationship by building ties across government departments in both countries. Another key area of focus was the welfare of Saudi citizens living in the United States. Other issues of focus included counter-terrorism, regional peace and security, bilateral trade, cultural exchange and interfaith dialogue. Prior to becoming ambassador, he was instrumental in establishing and maintaining the U.S.-Saudi Strategic Dialogue, which was initiated by King Abdullah and President Bush as a means to institutionalize relations between the two nations and deepen coordination on strategic, political and economic issues.

As Ambassador Al-Jubeir travelled frequently to the Kingdom for consultations with the King and other senior Saudi officials. He was regularly seen with King Abdullah in meetings with world leaders and accompanied King Abdullah on many state visits including Oman, China, India, Pakistan, Malaysia in 2006, Germany, Italy, Turkey, and Egypt in 2007, the G20 London Summit and Doha Arab Summit in 2009 and G20 Toronto Summit in 2010.

Ambassador Al-Jubeir was part of King Abdullah&#x27;s delegation on his visit to the Vatican in November 2007, where King Abduallah met with Pope Benedict XVI, the first meeting between a Saudi monarch and a Pope. In July 2008, King Abdullah convened an interfaith conference in Madrid, Spain, bringing together major figures from Islam, Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Shintoism and Confucianism to reinforce the common values shared by their respective faiths.

In November 2007, Al-Jubeir joined Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal for the meeting of the Arab League Foreign Ministers in Cairo in preparation for the Annapolis Peace Conference. He was also a member of the Saudi delegation to the Annapolis Peace Conference in November 2007.

During Ambassador Al-Jubeir&#x27;s tenure, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. signed a series of bilateral agreements in key areas including civil nuclear cooperation, enhanced security arrangements, reciprocal visa policies, health and medical services, science and technology cooperation, among others. The two countries also established two Joint Task Forces—one to combat terrorists, another to combat terror financing. Experts from both governments and militaries worked side-by-side, sharing real-time information about terror networks.

In October 2010, Saudi intelligence provided key information to American officials that foiled an attempted terrorist plot involving parcel bombs heading to the United States that originated in Yemen. The bombs were found and defused before reaching their intended targets. According to news reports, a double-agent in Yemen was the source of the tip-off.

Al-Jubeir enhanced the embassy&#x27;s focus on its ties with the United States Congress through extensive meetings and briefings with members of Congress and staff as well as facilitating visits to the Kingdom. In the spring of 2007, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi visited the Kingdom with a Congressional delegation, the first visit by a sitting Speaker of the House. In addition, the tempo of visits by senior U.S. officials increased substantially during his tenure as ambassador, including two visits by President Bush, multiple visits by Vice President Dick Cheney and visits by President Obama in 2009 and 2014. Other visits included National Security Advisors James L. Jones and Thomas Donilon; Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry; Secretaries of Treasury Henry Paulson and Timothy Geithner; Secretary of Energy Steven Chu; Secretaries of Defense Robert Gates, Leon Panetta and Chuck Hagel; CENTCOM Commanders Generals David Petraeus, James Mattis and Lloyd J. Austin III; FBI Director Robert Mueller; Homeland Security Advisor John O. Brennan and Special Envoys George J. Mitchell, Dennis Ross, Richard Holbrooke and a large number of sub cabinet officials.

Visits to the United States by senior Saudi officials since 2007 have included two Heads of State visits by King Abdullah in November 2008 and July 2010. In addition, there were a number of visits by Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal, then Minister of Defense now King Salman bin Abdulaziz, Minister of Interior Prince Muhammad bin Nayef, then Assistant to the Minister of Interior for Security Affairs now Second Deputy Prime Minister, Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Ali Al-Naimi, Finance Minister Ibrahim Abdulaziz Al-Assaf, then Governor of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, Mohammed al-Jasser, then Minister of Commerce Abdullah Alireza, President of the Saudi Commission for Tourism and Antiquities Prince Sultan bin Salman and Minister of Higher Education Dr. Khalid Al-Angary.

In addition to visits by government officials, there have been numerous trade delegations to and from both countries as well as academic exchanges, including visits by the head of the Human Rights Committee and members of the Majlis Al-Shura (Consultative Council).

These visits reflect the breadth and depth of the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.

Ambassador al-Jubeir served as the Escorting Minister for Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama on their respective visits to the Kingdom.

On 3 June 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama traveled to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on a two-day official visit to Saudi Arabia. President Obama was received by King Abdullah, Second Deputy Prime Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz and Ambassador Al-Jubeir at King Khalid International Airport.

During his visit to Saudi Arabia, President Obama stated that he chose Saudi Arabia as the first stop on his Middle East tour because the Kingdom is a key ally and the cradle of Islam. The President and King Abdullah met and held extensive bilateral talks at the King&#x27;s ranch in al-Janadriyah on the outskirts of Riyadh. During their discussions, the two leaders focused on regional and international developments and Saudi-U.S. bilateral relations. King Abdullah presented President Obama with the Collar of Abdulaziz Al Saud, the Kingdom&#x27;s highest award bestowed upon heads of state.

On 29 June 2010, Ambassador Al-Jubeir attended a meeting between King Abdullah and U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington, D.C. The two held on talks on a wide range of issues of mutual interest and common concern.

On 8 January 2011, Ambassador Al-Jubeir attended a meeting in New York between King Abdullah and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former U.S. President Bill Clinton as well as meetings between the King and French President Nicolas Sarkozy and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

In 2007, he headed the Kingdom&#x27;s delegation to the Law of the Seas Conference at the United Nations. In 2009, he met with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to discuss the ongoing situation in Darfur and in July 2011, he led the Saudi delegation to the U.N. High Level Meeting on Youth.

==Developments during tenure as ambassador==
In 2012, the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in the Kingdom issued more than 90,000 visas to Saudis. The Saudi Embassy in Washington and Consulates in the U.S. issued more than 70,000 visas. These are historically high numbers. As a result of an agreement reached in May 2008, the two countries agreed to issue five-year multiple-entry visas to citizens of both countries. In May 2013, Saudi Arabia and the United States signed a bilateral agreement for air services aimed at implementing an open skies policy between the two countries. As a consequence, American carriers can expand services into Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabian Airlines can increase the frequency of its flights to the U.S.
Former U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, James B. Smith stated, &quot;Offering new types of visas to foreign scientists and experts, as well as for student exchanges in scientific fields, opens doors for the people of Saudi Arabia to learn from other countries and for the world to learn from and about Saudi Arabia.&quot;

Saudi Arabia is the 10th largest trading partner of the United States. Investments between the two countries are also at record numbers. The United States is the number one source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Saudi Arabia. Strategic partnerships between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. continue to flourish. In 2010, Alcoa and Saudi Ma&#x27;aden signed a contract worth approximately $15 billion to build the world&#x27;s largest aluminum refinery and smelter complex in the Kingdom. In 2011, Saudi Aramco and Dow Chemical Company approved the formation of a joint venture to build and operate a world-scale, fully integrated chemical complex in Jubail Industrial City, valued at $20 billion. In 2013, the Saudi government Public Investment fund signed a management contract with Fluor for the $7 billion Riyadh–Jeddah railway project. Also in 2013, a Bechtel led consortium was selected for a multibillion-dollar rail project of the Riyadh Metro network. Saudi Arabia is also a large investor in the U.S. economy.

Since the beginning of the conflict in Yemen in 2015, the Saudi-led coalition provided billions of dollars in humanitarian aid to the country, while pursuing a military agenda against the Houthi rebellion. As of 2018, the Saudi-led coalition has given over $3 billion in humanitarian assistance.

===Arms transfers===
In 2008, the Kingdom secured sophisticated weapon systems, which include the Joint Direct Attack Munitions. In December 2011, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia finalized defense packages that included F-15 fighter aircraft and upgrades for 70 existing aircraft, as well as munitions, spare parts, training, maintenance and logistics to Saudi Arabia. The sale was worth $29.4 billion.

==Foreign minister==


In April 2015, he was appointed as foreign minister by King Salman of Saudi Arabia. He is the second person from outside the House of Saud to hold the position.

===Saudi–Iranian tensions===
Speaking on the nuclear program of Iran, al Jubeir said the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action appeared to have the provisions needed to curtail Iran&#x27;s ability to obtain a nuclear weapon. Adel al-Jubeir told reporters the kingdom was reassured by Washington while consultations continued about the deal, which he said stipulated effective inspections, and the possibility of snap-back sanctions if Iran violated the agreement. &quot;We are currently in talks with the American government regarding these details, but it (the deal) generally seems to have achieved these objectives,&quot; said al-Jubeir, in Washington in July 2015.

In November 2017, Al-Jubeir called for sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism and for violating the ballistic missile resolutions of the United Nations.

On 14 February 2019, at a conference in Warsaw, Al-Jubeir argued that Iran&#x27;s &quot;evil behavior&quot; in the Middle East makes Israeli-Palestinian peace impossible to achieve. Al-Jubeir said that any attempt to be nice to Iran encourages Iran to behave worse. Al-Jubeir was critical of the nuclear deal with Iran. He worried that in ten years, &quot;Iran ends up with a nuclear weapon — it is theoretically capable of doing one very quickly because [there are] no limits on enrichment — who is going to suffer? We are.”

===Russian involvement in Syria===
Following the Russian intervention in Syria in support of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in 2015, al-Jubeir declared: “There is no future for Assad in Syria”. He spelled out that if the Syrian president did not step down as part of a political transition, his country would embrace a military option, “which also would end with the removal of Bashar al-Assad from power”. In February 2018, Al-Jubeir came out in favor of a draft UN resolution by France, the United States, and the United Kingdom which would condemn Iran for allowing ballistic missiles into the hands of Houthi rebels in Yemen.

===Removal of Assad===
&quot;Bashar al-Assad will leave—have no doubt about it,&quot; al-Jubeir told CNN in February 2016. &quot;He will either leave by a political process or he will be removed by force.&quot; Saudi Arabia has sent troops and fighter jets to a Turkish military base ahead of a possible ground invasion of Syria. Jubeir said Saudi Arabia was prepared to contribute ground troops to the fight in Syria, but only as part of a US-led coalition. He added: &quot;We will push as much as we can to ensure that the political process works. But if that doesn&#x27;t work, it will be because of the obstinance of the Syrian regime and that of its allies. &quot;And should that prove to be the case, then it becomes clear that there is no option to remove Bashar al-Assad except by force.&quot;

On October 30, 2015, Saudi Arabia took part in the Syria Talks in Vienna to find a solution to the Syrian Civil War. Al-Jubeir used this opportunity to rebuke Iranian influence in Syria. He unsuccessfully tried to set conditions for the removal of Assad and the removal of Iranian troops from Syria. The talks eventually resulted in a final nine-point declaration signed off by all participants, which established a framework for continuing diplomatic peace efforts for the Syrian Civil War. In August 2017, Al-Jubeir reaffirmed this position, stating that the Kingdom supported an international agreement for the end of hostilities in the Syrian conflict, and that Assad should have no role in the transition to a peacetime government.

In August 2017, al-Jubeir informed the Syrian opposition that Saudi Arabia was disengaging from them.

===Saudi Arabia&#x27;s intervention in Yemen===
In September 2016, al-Jubeir said that the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s close ally, must continue to support Saudi Arabia&#x27;s military intervention in Yemen, saying: &quot;Saudi Arabia is fighting a legitimate war. We did not start this: the Iranian-backed Houthis started this. We have a situation where many of the claims being made about civilian casualties are not accurate. ... many of the schools and hospitals that have been hit were no longer being used as schools and hospitals but as military centres by the Houthis.&quot; Regarding the Yemen crisis, Al-Jubeir called it a tragedy and reminded that the Kingdom was the world&#x27;s largest donor of humanitarian assistance to Yemen. On January 22, 2018, he announced another influx of aid totaling over $1 billion, and re-established his country&#x27;s commitment to finding peace in Yemen in cooperation with the United Nations.

===Diplomatic dispute with Canada===
In August 2018, Canada called for the immediate release of Saudi blogger Raif Badawi and his sister Samar. In response to Canada&#x27;s criticism, Saudi Arabia expelled Canada&#x27;s ambassador, and froze trade with Canada. Al-Jubeir said &quot;Canada made a mistake, and the onus is on them to remedy, we don’t interfere in Canada, and we don’t get involved in their domestic policies. They did with ours, and it’s on them to fix it.&quot;

===Demotion to Minister of State===
In December 2018, al-Jubeir was demoted from his position as Minister of Foreign Affairs to Minister of State for Foreign Affairs. This was done in the wake of the Assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, in an apparent reshuffle of government officials by King Salman of Saudi Arabia. Al-Jubeir was seen as a fierce defender of Saudi&#x27;s royal family following the assassination and was the first Saudi official to state publicly that Khashoggi was murdered by &quot;rogue elements&quot; of the Saudi government. Although it is not likely that al-Jubeir had any prior knowledge of the assassination, the crime happened on the grounds of a Saudi consulate and as Minister of Foreign Affairs, he was thereby responsible to a certain degree hence his demotion to the Minister of State. 

==Assassination attempt==
United States officials alleged on October 11, 2011, there was a plot tied to the Iranian government to assassinate Adel al-Jubeir in the United States. The plot was referred to as the &quot;Iran assassination plot&quot; or the &quot;Iran terror plot&quot; in the media, while the Federal Bureau of Investigation named the case &quot;Operation Red Coalition&quot;.
