<text>Mack Fletcher Jones (November 6, 1938 – June 8, 2004), nicknamed &quot;Mack The Knife&quot;, was an American Major League Baseball left fielder who played for the Milwaukee / Atlanta Braves (1961–1967), Cincinnati Reds (1968), and Montreal Expos (1969–1971). He batted left-handed, threw right-handed and was listed as tall and .

==Professional career==
A native of Atlanta, Jones was a graduate of Henry McNeal Turner High School. After playing baseball for an Atlanta semi-pro team, Jones was signed by the Milwaukee Braves as an amateur agent in 1958. In his major-league debut, on July 13, 1961, Jones tied a &quot;modern&quot; (post-1900) National League record by collecting four hits (three singles and a double) in his first game, a 6-4 Braves road win over the St. Louis Cardinals and future Baseball Hall of Famer Bob Gibson. Leading off the game, Jones&#x27; first career hit was a single off Gibson. An inning later he notched his first career run batted in with a double off Gibson that scored Joe Torre.

In 1964, the Braves loaned Jones to the Detroit Tigers&#x27; Triple-A affiliate, the Syracuse Chiefs of the International League. Jones responded with one of the best seasons ever by a Syracuse player, when batting .317 with 15 doubles, 18 triples, 39 home runs and 102 runs batted in. He holds modern-day single-season Syracuse records for runs (111), total bases (337), RBIs, triples and home runs, all set in 1964. Jones was part of a Syracuse outfield that season that included future Tiger stars Willie Horton and Jim Northrup.

Jones returned to the majors the next year, and had his most productive season in 1965, when he batted .262 with 31 home runs and 75 runs batted in. Jones teamed up that year with Hank Aaron, Eddie Mathews, Joe Torre, Felipe Alou, and Gene Oliver, as the Braves set a National League record with six 20-home run hitters in one season. When the Braves moved to Jones&#x27; native Atlanta in 1966, he hit 23 homers despite a shoulder injury.

After the 1967 season, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds along with two other players for Deron Johnson. He played only one season for the Reds, appearing in 103 games in 1968, and his numbers fell off significantly from his past several seasons performance.

In the 1968 MLB expansion draft, Jones was the second player selected by the Montreal Expos (the fourth pick overall), behind Manny Mota. He made his Expos debut on opening day, April 8, 1969, at Shea Stadium in a game against the Mets. Six days later, on April 14, 1969, Jones hit a three-run home run and two-run triple in the Expos&#x27; first home victory as a franchise, an 8–7 win over the St. Louis Cardinals at Jarry Park. The home run came with Staub and Don Bosch on base and was the very first to be hit in a Major League regular season game in Canada. Jones finished that season with a career-high .270 batting average, 22 homers and 79 runs batted in. So popular was Jones in Montreal that the left-field bleachers in Jarry Park were nicknamed &quot;Jonesville.&quot; After the 1971 season, in which he only appeared in 43 games, he was released by the Expos.

Over his 11-year major-league career, Jones was a .252 hitter with 778 hits, 133 home runs, 415 RBI, 485 runs, 132 doubles, 31 triples, and 65 stolen bases in 1,002 games.

Jones was inducted into the Syracuse Baseball Wall of Fame in 2000, and into the International League Hall of Fame in 2013.

==Personal life==
Mack Jones died in Atlanta of complications from stomach cancer at age 65. He was survived by his wife Esther Levon Buggs Hill Jones, daughter Gayle Jones, son Rontae Jones, three grandchildren and stepson Antonio Hill.

==In popular culture==
Jones is portrayed by actor Phillip Jarrett in the French-Canadian baseball film &quot;A No-Hit No-Run Summer&quot;.

<doc id="733165" wikidata="Q466866" url="?curid=733165" title="Nessus (mythology)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Nessus () was a famous centaur who was killed by Heracles, and whose poisoned blood in turn killed Heracles. He was the son of Centauros. He fought in the battle with the Lapiths and became a ferryman on the river Euenos.

==Mythology==
Nessus is known for his famous role in the story of the Tunic of Nessus. After carrying Deianeira, the wife of Heracles, across the river, he attempted to have intercourse with her. Heracles saw this from across the river and shot a Hydra-poisoned arrow into Nessus&#x27;s breast. As he lay dying, as a final act of malice, Nessus told Deianeira that his blood would ensure that Heracles would be true to her forever, knowing the blood to be infected with the hydra&#x27;s poison.

Deianeira foolishly believed him. Later, when her trust began to wane because of Iole, she spread the centaur&#x27;s blood on a robe and gave it to her husband. Heracles went to a gathering of heroes, where his passion got the better of him. Meanwhile, Deianeira accidentally spilled a portion of the centaur&#x27;s blood onto the floor. To her horror, it began to fume by the light of the rising sun.

She instantly recognized it as poison and sent her messenger to warn Heracles but it was too late. Heracles lay dying slowly and painfully as the robe burned his skin—either in actual flames or by the heat of poison. He died a noble death on a funeral pyre of oak branches. Heracles was then taken to Mount Olympus by Zeus and welcomed among the gods for his heroic exploits.

A similar theme appears in certain versions of the story of Medea.

Sophocles&#x27; play &quot;Trachiniae&quot; (&quot;Women of Trachis&quot;) is extensively based on a retelling of this myth.

== Before the Myth ==
Before the ancient Greeks told the story of Nessus and &#x27;created&#x27; centaurs, the Kassites used them as guiding spirits. There may also be a connection to the origin of centaurs in this myth. One etymological explanation for centaur stems from the meaning water-whipper, or water spirit.

==In popular culture==
* In Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, Nessus is among the centaurs who patrol the outer rings of the Circle of Violence, making sure those immersed in the Phlegethon don&#x27;t get out of their position. He was appointed by Chiron to guide Dante and Virgil alongside the Phlegethon.
* Nessus appears as an antagonist in the Disney movie &quot;Hercules&quot; voiced by Jim Cummings. In the film, he is portrayed as a lecherous river guardian and is Hercules&#x27;s first major opponent. Hercules defeats him in battle and saves Megara from him, but it is later revealed that Megara had been sent by Hades to recruit Nessus for his cause. Nessus appears in the video game based on the film and serves as the game&#x27;s first boss, in the episode &quot;Hercules and the Arabian Night&quot; as Hades&#x27;s chessboard piece from the animated series based on the film and in the episode &quot;Salute to Sports&quot; as a cameo from the TV series &quot;House of Mouse&quot;.
* One of the main characters in Larry Niven&#x27;s series of books from the &quot;Ringworld&quot; universe is called Nessus. He is of an alien race with a three-legged body similar to an ostrich without feathers and two snake-like heads on long necks.
* In Gene Wolfe&#x27;s novel &quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot;, the metropolis Nessus seems to be named for this character&#x27;s poisoned blood, as the city had a different name back when &quot;the river was unpoisoned.&quot;
* Nessus appears in &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno: An Animated Epic&quot; (which is based on the video game &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot;) voiced by Charlotte Cornwell. This version is depicted as a female and is a good friend of Virgil. She helps Dante and Virgil across the Phlegethon.
* The episode is the basis for a section of T.S. Eliot&#x27;s Four Quartets, Little Gidding IV, mirroring the greater theme of the poem.

== Historical Allusions ==
The Nessus Shirt story can be connected to real world events and figures of speech. It has been used as an allusion to the early settlers giving infected blankets to Native Americans.

<text>Robert Brown Parker (September 17, 1932 – January 18, 2010) was an American writer, primarily of fiction within the mystery/detective genre. His most famous works were the 40 novels written about the fictional private detective Spenser. ABC television network developed the television series &quot;&quot; based on the character in the mid-1980s; a series of TV movies was also produced based on the character. His works incorporate encyclopedic knowledge of the Boston metropolitan area. The Spenser novels have been cited as reviving and changing the detective genre by critics and bestselling authors, including Robert Crais, Harlan Coben, and Dennis Lehane.

Parker also wrote nine novels featuring Jesse Stone, a Los Angeles police officer who moves to a small New England town; six novels with Sunny Randall, a female private investigator; and four Westerns starring the duo Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch. The first was &quot;Appaloosa&quot;, made into a film starring Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen. The Jesse Stone books were adapted into a series of TV films starring Tom Selleck.

Since Parker&#x27;s death, his family and estate have allowed all of his series to continue with various different authors involved: the Spenser books have been taken over by Ace Atkins (2012-2022) and Mike Lupica (2023-present); Jesse Stone by Michael Brandman (2011-2013), Reed Farrel Coleman (2014-2019) and Lupica (2020-2022); Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch by Robert Knott; and Sunny Randall by Lupica (2018-2020) and Alison Gaylin (2023).

==Early life==
Parker was born in Springfield, Massachusetts. In 1956, Parker married Joan H. Parker, whom he claimed to have met as a toddler at a birthday party. They spent their childhoods in the same neighborhood.

After earning a bachelor of arts degree from Colby College in Waterville, Maine, Parker served as a soldier in the US Army Infantry in Korea. In 1957, he earned his master&#x27;s degree in English literature from Boston University and then worked in advertising and technical writing until 1962. Parker received a PhD in English literature from Boston University in 1971. His dissertation, titled &quot;The Violent Hero, Wilderness Heritage, and Urban Reality,&quot; discussed the exploits of fictional private-eye heroes created by Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and Ross Macdonald.

==Career==
Parker wrote his first novel in 1971 while teaching at Northeastern University. He became a full professor in 1976, and turned to full-time writing in 1979, with five Spenser novels to his credit.

Parker&#x27;s popular Spenser novels are known for his characters of varied races and religions. According to critic Christina Nunez, Parker&#x27;s &quot;inclusion of [characters of] other races and sexual persuasions&quot; lends his writings a &quot;more modern feel&quot;. For example, the &quot;Spenser&quot; series characters include Hawk and Chollo, African American and Mexican American, respectively, as well as Spenser&#x27;s Jewish girlfriend, Susan, various Russians, Ukrainians, Chinese, a gay cop, Lee Farrell, and even a gay mob boss, Gino Fish. The homosexuality of both his sons gave his writing &quot;[a] sensibility,&quot; Ms. Nunez feels, &quot;[which] strengthens Parker&#x27;s sensibility [toward gays].&quot; In 1985, &quot;Spenser&quot; was made into a successful television series, &quot;Spenser for Hire&quot;, which starred Robert Urich, Avery Brooks, and Barbara Stock.

In 1994, Parker collaborated with Japanese photographer Kasho Kumagai on a coffee-table book called &quot;Spenser&#x27;s Boston&quot;, exploring the city through Spenser&#x27;s &quot;eyes&quot; via high quality, four-color photos. In addition to Parker&#x27;s introduction, excerpts from several of the Spenser novels were included.

Parker created female detective Sunny Randall at the request of actress Helen Hunt, who wanted him to write a part for her to play. He wrote the first book, and the film version was planned for 2000, but never materialized. His publisher liked the character, though, and asked him to continue with the series.

Another figure created by Parker was Jesse Stone, a troubled former LAPD detective, who starts a new career as a police chief in a small New England town. Between 1997 and 2010, he wrote nine novels featuring Jesse Stone, all of which have been adapted as a series of TV movies by CBS starring Tom Selleck as Jesse Stone.

Aside from crime writing, Parker also produced several Western novels, including &quot;Appaloosa&quot;, and children&#x27;s books. Like Parker&#x27;s Spenser series, his Westerns have received critical attention. Chris Dacus, who has written on other authors including Cormac McCarthy, has written of the intellectual depth and importance of Parker&#x27;s Westerns in &quot;The Stoic Western Hero: Robert B. Parker&#x27;s Westerns&quot;.

Parker and his wife created an independent film company called Pearl Productions, based in Boston. It was named after their German Shorthaired Pointer, Pearl.

==Personal life==
Parker and his wife, Joan, had two sons, David and Daniel. Originally, the character of Spenser was to have been called &quot;David&quot;, but Parker did not want to appear to favor one of his sons over the other, so Parker omitted Spenser&#x27;s first name entirely, and it was never revealed.

Parker and his wife separated at one point, but then came to an unusual arrangement. They lived in a three-story Victorian house just outside of Harvard Square; she lived on one floor and he on another, and they shared the middle floor. This living arrangement is mirrored in Spenser&#x27;s private life: his girlfriend, Susan, had an aversion to marriage and living together full-time. Living separately suited them both, although they were fully committed to each other. Explaining the arrangement in an interview on &quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot;, Parker said, &quot;I want to make love to my wife for the rest of my life, but I never want to sleep with her again.&quot;

He had a great fondness for dogs, including German Shorthair Pointers. Dogs were included in his Spenser stories, aging along with the character and appearing in the ongoing series of novels. The dogs were always named Pearl.

Parker&#x27;s favorite books were &quot;The Bear&quot;, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot;, &quot;Dubliners&quot;, &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, &quot;U.S.A. trilogy&quot;, and &quot;The Ambassadors&quot;.

===Awards===
Parker received three nominations and two Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America. He received the first award, the &quot;Best Novel Award&quot; in 1977, for the fourth novel in the Spenser series, &quot;Promised Land&quot;. In 1983, he received the Maltese Falcon Award, Japan, for &quot;Early Autumn&quot;. In 1990, he shared, with wife Joan, a nomination for &quot;Best Television Episode&quot; for the TV series &quot;B.L. Stryker&quot;, but the award went to David J. Burke and Alfonse Ruggiero Jr. for &quot;Wiseguy&quot;.

In 2002, he received the Grand Master Award Edgar for his collective &quot;oeuvre&quot;.

Parker received the 2002 Joseph E. Connor Memorial Award from the Phi Alpha Tau Fraternity at Emerson College. He was inducted into the fraternity as an honorary brother in spring 2003.

In 2008, he was awarded the Gumshoe Lifetime Achievement Award.

==Death==
Parker was 77 when he died suddenly of a heart attack at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on January 18, 2010; discovered at his desk by his wife Joan, he had been working on a novel.

Joan Parker, the inspiration for the Susan Silverman character in the Spenser series, died June 12, 2013. 

Later written by Ace Atkins, the Spenser series continued following Parker&#x27;s death. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote that while some people might have &quot;viewed the move as unseemly, those people didn&#x27;t know Robert B. Parker, a man who, when asked how his books would be viewed in 50 years, replied: &#x27;Don&#x27;t know, don&#x27;t care.&#x27; He was proud of his work, but he mainly saw writing as a means of providing a comfortable life for his family.&quot;

==Works==

===Novels===
====Series continuations====
After Parker died, his family, together with Parker&#x27;s publishers, chose to continue the Jesse Stone, Spenser, and Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch series.

Ace Atkins was selected to continue the Spenser novels. The book Parker was working on at the time of his death was completed by his literary agent Helen Bran.

Eleven Jesse Stone novels have been published since Parker&#x27;s death. The first three were by Parker&#x27;s longtime friend and collaborator, Michael Brandman, and the next six by Reed Farrel Coleman. Mike Lupica wrote the 10th in 2020 and eleventh in 2021.

Parker&#x27;s Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch series was continued by actor and screenwriter Robert Knott.

The Sunny Randall series continued with &quot;Blood Feud&quot; (November 27, 2018) and &quot;Grudge Match&quot; (May 4, 2020). The books were written by Parker&#x27;s friend, sports journalist Mike Lupica. The eleventh book in the Sunny Randall series, &#x27;Bad Influence&#x27;, was written by Alison Gaylin and published in 2023.

<doc id="733176" wikidata="Q1130211" url="?curid=733176" title="The Double Life of Veronique">
<text>The Double Life of Veronique (, ) is a 1991 drama film directed by Krzysztof Kieślowski, and starring Irène Jacob and Philippe Volter. Written by Kieślowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz, the film explores the themes of identity, love, and human intuition through the characters of Weronika, a Polish choir soprano, and her double, Véronique, a French music teacher. Despite not knowing each other, the two women share a mysterious and emotional bond that transcends language and geography.

&quot;The Double Life of Veronique&quot; was Kieślowski&#x27;s first film produced partly outside his native Poland. It won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury and the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival, as well as the Best Actress award for Jacob. Although selected as the Polish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 64th Academy Awards, it was not accepted as a nominee.

==Plot==
In 1968, a Polish girl glimpses the winter stars, while in France, another girl witnesses the first spring leaf. In 1990, a young Polish woman named Weronika is singing at an outdoor concert with her choir when a rainstorm interrupts their performance. Later that night, she has sex with her boyfriend, Antek, before leaving for Kraków the next day to be with her sick aunt. She tells her father that she has a strange feeling that she is not alone in the world. Once in Kraków, Weronika joins a local choir and successfully auditions. One day, while walking through the Main Square, she spots a French tourist who looks identical to her and watches as her doppelgänger boards a bus and takes photographs. During the choir&#x27;s next concert, while singing a solo part, Weronika suffers a cardiac arrest and dies.

On the same day in Clermont-Ferrand, France, Véronique, who looks exactly like Weronika, is overcome with grief after having sex with her boyfriend and later tells her music teacher that she is quitting the choir. At school, Véronique attends a marionette performance with her class and then leads them in a musical piece by 18th-century composer Van den Budenmayer, who also wrote the music Weronika performed before her death. That night, Véronique sees the puppeteer at a traffic light motioning to her not to light the wrong end of her cigarette. Later, she hears a choir singing Van den Budenmayer&#x27;s music on a mysterious phone call. Véronique visits her father and confesses to being in love with someone she does not know and feeling like she has lost someone from her life.

Back home, Véronique receives a package containing a shoelace. She identifies the puppeteer as Alexandre Fabbri, who is also a children&#x27;s book author. Véronique reads his books and then receives a new package from her father with a cassette tape containing sounds such as a typewriter, a train station and a fragment of music by Van den Budenmayer. The postage stamp on the envelope leads her to the Gare Saint-Lazare in Paris, where Alexandre is waiting for her in a café. He confesses to sending the packages to see if she would come to him. Enraged, Véronique leaves and checks into a nearby hotel. Alexandre follows her and apologises to her. They confess their feelings for each other and fall asleep together.

The next morning, Véronique tells Alexandre that throughout her life, she has felt like she is &quot;in two places at the same time&quot;, and believes that someone has been guiding her life. She shows him the contents of her handbag, including a proof sheet of photos from her recent trip to Poland. Alexandre notices what he thinks is a photo of Véronique, but she assures him that it is not her. Overwhelmed, Véronique breaks down in tears, and Alexandre comforts her. It becomes clear that Weronika&#x27;s fate has influenced Véronique&#x27;s decision to stop singing and avoid a similar fate.

Later, Véronique visits Alexandre at his apartment and sees him working on a pair of marionettes that resemble her. Alexandre explains that he needs a backup in case the original puppet gets damaged. He demonstrates how to operate the puppet while the duplicate lies on the table. Alexandre reads her his new book about two women born on the same day in different cities who have a mysterious connection. Later that day, Véronique visits her father&#x27;s house and touches an old tree trunk. Her father, who is inside the house, seems to sense her presence.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Filming style===
The film incorporates a strong metaphysical element, yet the supernatural aspect of the story remains unexplained. Similar to &quot;Three Colours: Blue&quot;, Preisner&#x27;s musical score plays a significant role in the plot and is credited to the fictional Van den Budenmayer. The cinematography is highly stylized, utilizing color and camera filters to create an ethereal atmosphere. Sławomir Idziak, the cinematographer, had previously experimented with these techniques in an episode of &quot;Dekalog&quot;, while Kieślowski expanded on the use of color for a wider range of effects in his &quot;Three Colours trilogy&quot;. Kieślowski had previously explored the concept of different life paths for the same individual in his Polish film, &quot;Przypadek&quot; (&quot;Blind Chance&quot;). The central choice faced by Weronika/Véronique is based on a brief subplot in the ninth episode of &quot;Dekalog&quot;.

===Filming locations===
The film was shot at locations including Clermont-Ferrand, Kraków and Paris.

===Alternative ending===
In November 2006, a Criterion Collection region 1 DVD was released in the United States and Canada, which includes an alternative ending that Kieślowski changed in the edit at the request of Harvey Weinstein of Miramax for the American release. Kieślowski added four brief shots to the end of the film, which show Véronique&#x27;s father emerging from the house and Véronique running across the yard to embrace him. The final image of the father and daughter embracing is shot from inside the house through a window.

===Music===
Zbigniew Preisner composed the score; however, in the film, the music is attributed to a fictitious 18th-century Dutch composer named Van den Budenmayer, who was created by Preisner and Kieślowski for use in screenplays.

Music credited to this imaginary composer also appears in Kieślowski&#x27;s &quot;Dekalog&quot; (1988) and &quot;Three Colours: Blue&quot; (1993). In the latter, a theme from Van den Budenmayer&#x27;s &quot;musique funebres&quot; is quoted in the &quot;Song for the Unification of Europe&quot;, and the E minor soprano solo is foreshadowed in Weronika&#x27;s final performance.

===Puppetry===
The puppet acts were performed by American puppeteer and sculptor Bruce Schwartz. Unlike most puppeteers who usually hide their hands in gloves or use strings or sticks, Schwartz shows his hands while performing.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;The Double Life of Veronique&quot; received mostly positive reviews. In her review in &quot;Not Coming to a Theater Near You&quot;, Jenny Jediny wrote, &quot;In many ways, &quot;The Double Life of Veronique&quot; is a small miracle of cinema; ... Kieslowski’s strong, if largely post-mortem reputation among the art house audience has elevated a film that makes little to no sense on paper, while its emotional tone strikes a singular—perhaps perfect—key.&quot;

In his review in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Hal Hinson called the film &quot;a mesmerizing poetic work composed in an eerie minor key.&quot; Noting that the effect on the viewer is subtle but very real, Hinson concluded, &quot;The film takes us completely into its world, and in doing so, it leaves us with the impression that our own world, once we return to it, is far richer and portentous than we had imagined.&quot; Hinson was particularly impressed with Jacob&#x27;s performance:
In her review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Caryn James wrote, &quot;&quot;Veronique&quot; is poetic in the truest sense, relying on images that can&#x27;t be turned into prosaic statements without losing something of their essence. The film suggests mysterious connections of personality and emotion, but it was never meant to yield any neat, summary idea about the two women&#x27;s lives.&quot;

In his review in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;The movie has a hypnotic effect. We are drawn into the character, not kept at arm&#x27;s length with a plot.&quot; Ebert singled out Sławomir Idziak&#x27;s innovative use of color and cinematography:
In 2009, Ebert added &quot;The Double Life of Veronique&quot; to his Great Movies list. Krzysztof Kieślowski&#x27;s &quot;Dekalog&quot; and &quot;The Three Colours Trilogy&quot; are also on the list.

In his review for &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, David Parkinson called it &quot;a film of great fragility and beauty, with the delicacy of the puppet theatre.&quot; He thought the film was &quot;divinely photographed&quot; by Slawomir Idziak, and praised Irène Jacob&#x27;s performance as &quot;simply sublime and thoroughly merited the Best Actress prize at Cannes.&quot; Parkinson viewed the film as &quot;compelling, challenging and irresistibly beautiful&quot; and a &quot;metaphysical masterpiece.&quot;

Elbert Ventura of AllMovie rated the film four out of five stars, calling it Kieślowski&#x27;s &quot;most ravishing film&quot; and writing, &quot;With its oblique story line, cryptic rhyming patterns, and focus on mood and tone, this elusive movie is more poem than narrative.&quot; In a five-star review of the DVD release of &quot;The Double Life of Veronique&quot;, Ivana Redwine of About.com described the film as &quot;[c]aptivating&quot; and &quot;mesmerizing&quot;, while praising Jacob&#x27;s performance as &quot;superb&quot;. At BBC, Matthew Leyland gave the film three stars out of five and wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s a ravishingly pretty piece, but it may tax viewers searching for answers that remain out of reach.&quot; Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the film five stars out of five.

On the review aggregator website &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot;, the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10.

<text>The Bubi people (also known as Bobe, Voove, Ewota and Bantu Bubi) are a Bantu ethnic group of Central Africa who are indigenous to Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea. Once the majority group in the region, the population experienced a sharp decline due to war and disease during Portuguese expeditions. By the end of Spanish colonial rule in the mid 20th century, and after substantial intermarriage with newly introduced populations, such as Afro-Cubans, Krio people, Portuguese people and Spaniards, the Bubi people, again, experienced a great decline in number. Seventy-five percent perished due to tribal/clan rooted political genocide during a civil war that led to Spanish Guinea&#x27;s independence from Spain. This, too, sparked mass exodus from their homeland with most of the exiles and refugees immigrating into Spain. The indigenous Bubi of Bioko Island have since co-existed with non-indigenous Krio Fernandinos; and members of the Fang ethnic group, who have immigrated in large numbers from Río Muni. Once numbering approximately 3 million, the Bubi currently number around 100,000 worldwide.

The Bubi people, both living in Equatorial Guinea and exiled abroad, have long held little political power and economic stake in their native land. However, appointed government officials, such as the former Prime Minister Miguel Abia Biteo Boricó and several other members of the current Equatorial Guinea government, are of ethnic Bubi descent.

Most Bubi people that remain on Bioko Island, as well as those native to Gabon, speak the Bube language. Many of the islanders also speak Spanish, French and Portuguese as a secondary language.

== Etymology ==

The name applied to the tribe, &quot;Bubi&quot;, did not originate from within the tribe. It was given to them by pre-colonial visitors to the island of Bioko. It has been suggested that the term &quot;bubi&quot; was derived from the bubi word &quot;boobè&quot; (the people from the south of the island use &quot;moomè&quot;) which means &quot;man&quot;. More than likely, the term was taken from Europeans who had heard the manner in which the indigenous people of Bioko Island greeted one another. &quot;A boobe, oipodi&quot; translates into &quot;good morning, man&quot;. From the word &quot;boobè&quot;, meaning male, the term Bubi was derived by foreigners. Subsequently, the term &quot;bubi&quot; was adopted by the indigenous people.

=== Endonyms ===
Originally the Bubi referred to themselves as &quot;people of the land who are among the living&quot;. In the Bubi language, the translation of this phrase varied per region within the Bubi Kingdom: 
* North — &quot;bochoboche&quot;; plural &quot;bechoboche&quot;
* Northeast — &quot;bosoboiso&quot;; plural &quot;besoboiso&quot;
* East — &quot;boschosboricho&quot;; plural &quot;bachosboricho&quot;
* South — &quot;mochomorischo&quot;; plural &quot;bachoboricho&quot;
* Southwest — &quot;menchomoboncho&quot;; plural &quot;bandiobaboncho&quot;

== History ==

The Bubi people are subdivided into a number of tribes and subtribes that go back centuries. Indigenous Bubi folklore indicate that the tribe immigrated to Bioko Island some 3,000 years ago as a means of escaping servitude. The Bubi immigrated to Bioko Island some time during the 13th century, some 200 years before it was colonized by the Portuguese. Other reports suggest that the tribe arrived between the 5th and the 18th centuries from southern Cameroon and the mainland area of the Río Muni.

One perspective offers that the Bubi were once enslaved by a single continental African tribe, likely another Bantu ethnic group that once occupied areas along the shores of West Africa. Another suggests those who immigrated to Bioko 3,000 years ago descended from enslaved members from a number of ethnic groups that existed up and down the West-Central African region during that time. In essence, the tribe is a result of an amalgamation of small tribal groups who immigrated to Bioko Island in several waves, and each group established its own enclave upon the island. Throughout their history, these groups engaged in brutal battles for supremacy, though the fighting was not relegated strictly to inter-clan rivalries. The Bubi were known to have had long battles against one another on an individual, family, district, city, and tribal level—this led to a near constant state of warfare on the island.

The Bubi were isolated and undisturbed for much time, leading them to form a unique society, language and belief system different from the mainland Bantus.
With the arrival of Portuguese explorer Fernando Po, life changed drastically for the native Bubi. Explorers killed the Bubis, and those Bubi who escaped the explorers caught diseases such as whooping cough, smallpox, and dysentery from the foreigners. For several centuries, Europeans attempted to penetrate the island of Bioko. They, however, were met with staunch resistance, purported savagery, by the Bubi. A German Gold Coast merchant wrote &quot;The island of Fernando Po is inhabited by a savage and cruel sort of people,&quot; and that Europeans did not dare to dock upon their beaches, for fear of surprise attacks from natives with dart-weapons. Surprise attacks on explorers and colonists were a common phenomenon during this period—in fact, the Bubi had a system of social rank that depended largely on how many rivals a man had killed through stealth or subterfuge. Because of this, the Bubi remained unconquered by European imperialism until the start of the 20th century. Led by their kings, the Bubi were well aware of the slave trade in the region and, for centuries, were very wary of outsiders. This was later reduced when the island leadership began to trade and barter with the Europeans, so Europeans were able to infiltrate the island&#x27;s social and political structures.

Gradually, European influence on the island increased. Portugal laid claim to it, and then traded it to Spain. By the early 19th century, Bioko was a short-term integral point in the transfer of slaves from mainland Africa to the Americas. However, the flow of humans trafficked through the port was constantly disrupted by indigenous groups who organized to steal and free many of those transported. The port was closed by the end of the 19th century at the order of the British government who set up military occupation of the port for the latter half of the century. Over time, the influence of the Bubi has greatly diminished, and they are now a minority upon the island, as well as in the nation of Equatorial Guinea itself.

=== 20th century and 21st century ===

Francisco Macías Nguema was the first President of Equatorial Guinea, from 1968 until his overthrow in 1979. During his presidency, he declared himself a &quot;Hitlerian-Marxist&quot; and his country was nicknamed &quot;the Auschwitz of Africa&quot;. Nguema&#x27;s regime was characterized by its abandonment of all government functions except internal security, which was accomplished by terror; he acted as chief judge and sentenced thousands to death. This led to the death or exile of up to 1/3 of the country&#x27;s population. Out of a population of 300,000, an estimated 80,000 had been killed, in particular those of the Bubi ethnic minority on Bioko associated with relative wealth and intellectualism. All schools were ordered closed in 1975. The economy collapsed, and skilled citizens and foreigners left.

On August 3, 1979, he was overthrown by Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. Macías Nguema was captured, tried for genocide and other crimes along with 10 others. All of them were found guilty, four received terms of imprisonment, while Nguema and the other six were executed a few weeks later on September 29.
In 1998, many Bubi people were tortured to extract confessions following their arrest after launching several attacks on military barracks in which three soldiers and several civilians were killed. At least six detainees reportedly died after being tortured. Bubi women were publicly humiliated in the courtyard of the police station in Malabo with some being forced to swim naked in the mud in front of other detainees whilst others were sexually abused.

John B. Quigley in &quot;The Genocide Convention: An International Law Analysis&quot; points out that at Macías Nguema&#x27;s trial for genocide that Equatorial Guinea had not ratified the Genocide Convention and that records of the court proceedings show that there was some confusion over whether Nguema and his co-defendants were tried under the laws of Spain, or whether the trial was justified on the claim that the Genocide Convention was part of customary international law. Quigley states that &quot;The Macias case stands out as the most confusing of domestic genocide prosecutions from the standpoint of the applicable law. The Macias conviction is also problematic from the standpoint of the identity of the protected group.&quot;

Traditionally, the prime minister of Equatorial Guinea has been from the Bubi minority. The last Bubi prime minister was Miguel Abia Biteo Boricó, following the forced resignation of Boricó&#x27;s cabinet in August 2006 on charges of corruption and incompetence. Obiang then appointed Ricardo Mangue Obama Nfubea, who was a Fang.

== Religion ==
The Bubi people are mainly Catholics. This is due to Spanish influence during the colonial age when the Spanish ruled over Bioko Island and Río Muni. 

Traditional pre-Christian beliefs are prevalent in Bubi spirituality. In the ancient belief system of the Bubi, the head god was called Rupe (or Eri in the southern region of the island) who created and cared for the world. The spirit world was said to consist of three parts: &quot;Labako-ppua&quot; (heaven and the angels), &quot;Ommo ich&#x27;ori&quot; (hell and the bad angels), and &quot;Ommo boeboe&quot; (limbo). The spiritual world and material world constantly melded and layered upon each other which meant that the Bubi people and the supernatural spirits shared the land. Sinister spirits were blamed for illness, accidents, and misfortune. Every unique natural landmark was also said to be associated with a spirit with rivers, lakes, and mountains having specific spiritual power.

<text>Polyacetylene (IUPAC name: polyethyne) usually refers to an organic polymer with the repeating unit . The name refers to its conceptual construction from polymerization of acetylene to give a chain with repeating olefin groups. This compound is conceptually important, as the discovery of polyacetylene and its high conductivity upon doping helped to launch the field of organic conductive polymers. The high electrical conductivity discovered by Hideki Shirakawa, Alan Heeger, and Alan MacDiarmid for this polymer led to intense interest in the use of organic compounds in microelectronics (organic semiconductors). This discovery was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000. Early work in the field of polyacetylene research was aimed at using doped polymers as easily processable and lightweight &quot;plastic metals&quot;. Despite the promise of this polymer in the field of conductive polymers, many of its properties such as instability to air and difficulty with processing have led to avoidance in commercial applications.

Compounds called polyacetylenes also occur in nature, although in this context the term refers to polyynes, compounds containing multiple acetylene groups (&quot;poly&quot; meaning &quot;many&quot;), rather than to chains of olefin groups (&quot;poly&quot; meaning &quot;polymerization of&quot;).

==Structure==

Polyacetylene consists of a long chain of carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds between them, each with one hydrogen atom. The double bonds can have either &quot;cis&quot; or &quot;trans&quot; geometry. The controlled synthesis of each isomer of the polymer, &quot;cis&quot;-polyacetylene or &quot;trans&quot;-polyacetylene, can be achieved by changing the temperature at which the reaction is conducted. The &quot;cis&quot; form of the polymer is thermodynamically less stable than the &quot;trans&quot; isomer. Despite the conjugated nature of the polyacetylene backbone, not all of the carbon–carbon bonds in the material are equal: a distinct single/double alternation exists. Each hydrogen atom can be replaced by a functional group. Substituted polyacetylenes tend to be more rigid than saturated polymers. Furthermore, placing different functional groups as substituents on the polymer backbone leads to a twisted conformation of the polymer chain to interrupt the conjugation.

==History==
One of the earliest reported acetylene polymers was named cuprene. Its highly cross-linked nature led to no further studies in the field for quite some time. Linear polyacetylene was first prepared by Giulio Natta in 1958. The resulting polyacetylene was linear, of high molecular weight, displayed high crystallinity, and had a regular structure. X-ray diffraction studies demonstrated that the resulting polyacetylene was &quot;trans&quot;-polyacetylene. After this first reported synthesis, few chemists were interested in polyacetylene because the product of Natta&#x27;s preparation was an insoluble, air sensitive, and infusible black powder.

The next major development of polyacetylene polymerization was made by Hideki Shirakawa’s group who were able to prepare silvery films of polyacetylene. They discovered that the polymerization of polyacetylene could be achieved at the surface of a concentrated solution of the catalyst system of Et3Al and Ti(OBu)4 in an inert solvent such as toluene. In parallel with Shirakawa&#x27;s studies, Alan Heeger and Alan MacDiarmid were studying the metallic properties of polythiazyl [(SN)x], a related but inorganic polymer. Polythiazyl caught Heeger&#x27;s interest as a chain-like metallic material, and he collaborated with Alan MacDiarmid who had previous experience with this material. By the early 1970s, this polymer was known to be superconductive at low temperatures. Shirakawa, Heeger, and MacDiarmid collaborated on further development of polyacetylene.

Upon doping polyacetylene with I2, the conductivity increased seven orders of magnitude. Similar results were achieved using Cl2 and Br2. These materials exhibited the largest room temperature conductivity observed for a covalent organic polymer, and this seminal report was key in furthering the development of organic conductive polymers. Further studies led to improved control of the &quot;cis&quot;/&quot;trans&quot; isomer ratio and demonstrated that &quot;cis&quot;-polyacetylene doping led to higher conductivity than doping of &quot;trans&quot;-polyacetylene. Doping &quot;cis&quot;-polyacetylene with AsF5 further increased the conductivities, bringing them close to that of copper. Furthermore, it was found that heat treatment of the catalyst used for polymerization led to films with higher conductivities.

To account for such an increase in conductivity in polyacetylene, J. R. Schrieffer and Heeger considered the existence of topologically protected solitonic defects, their model is now known as the Su–Schrieffer–Heeger model, which has served as model in other contexts to understand topological insulators.

==Synthesis==
===From acetylene===

A variety of methods have been developed to synthesize polyacetylene. One of the most common methods is via passing acetylene gas over a Ziegler–Natta catalyst, such as Ti(O&quot;i&quot;Pr)4/Al(C2H5)3. This method allows control over the structure and properties of the final polymer by varying temperature and catalyst loading. Mechanistic studies suggest that this polymerization involves metal insertion into the triple bond of acetylene.
By varying the apparatus and catalyst loading, Shirakawa and coworkers were able to synthesize polyacetylene as thin films, rather than insoluble black powders. They obtained these films by coating the walls of a reaction flask under inert conditions with a solution of the Ziegler–Natta catalyst and adding gaseous acetylene resulting in immediate formation of a film. Enkelmann and coworkers further improved polyacetylene synthesis by changing the catalyst to a Co(NO3)2/NaBH4 system, which was stable to both oxygen and water.

Polyacetylene can also be produced by photopolymerization of acetylene. Glow-discharge, gamma, and ultraviolet irradiation have all been used. This method avoid the use of catalysts and solvents, but requires cryogenics to produce usable polymer. Gas-phase polymerization typically produces irregular cuprene, whereas liquid-phase polymerization, conducted at −78 °C produces linear &quot;cis&quot;-polyacetylene, and solid-phase polymerization, conducted at still lower temperature, produces &quot;trans&quot;-polyacetylene.

===Ring-opening metathesis polymerization===
Polyacetylene can be synthesized by ring-opening metathesis polymerisation (ROMP) from cyclooctatetraene, a precursor that is more expensive but easier to handle than the acetylene monomer. This synthetic route also provides a means for introducing solubilizing groups to the polymer while maintaining the conjugation. Polymers with linear groups such as &quot;n&quot;-octyl had high conductivity but low solubility, while highly branched &quot;tert&quot;-butyl groups increased solubility but decreased conjugation due to polymer twisting to avoid steric crowding. They obtained soluble and conductive polymers with &quot;sec&quot;-butyl and neopentyl groups, because the methylene (CH2) unit directly connected to the polymer reduces steric crowding and prevents twisting.
===From precursor polymers===
Polyacetylene can also be synthesized from other polymers. This method enables modification and processing of the polymer before conversion into the highly insoluble polyacetylene. Short, irregular segments of polyacetylene can be obtained by dehydrohalogenation of poly(vinyl chloride):

More efficient methos for synthesizing long polyacetylene chains exist and include the Durham precursor route in which precusor polymers are prepared by ring-opening metathesis polymerization, and a subsequent heat-induced reverse Diels–Alder reaction yields the final polymer, as well as volatile side products.
==Doping==
When polyacetylene films are exposed to vapors of electron-accepting compounds (p-type dopants), the electrical conductivity of the material increases by orders of magnitude over the undoped material. p-Type dopants include Br2, I2, Cl2, and AsF5. These dopants act by abstracting an electron from the polymer chain. The conductivity of these polymers is believed to be a result of the creation of charge-transfer complexes between the polymer and halogen. Charge transfer occurs from the polymer to the acceptor compound; the polyacetylene chain acts as a cation and the acceptor as an anion. The &quot;hole&quot; on the polymer backbone is weakly associated with the anionic acceptor by Coulomb potential. Polyacetylene doped with (p-type) dopants retain their high conductivity even after exposure to air for several days.

Electron-donating (n-type) dopants can also be used to create conductive polyacetylene. n-Type dopants for polyacetylene include lithium, sodium, and potassium. As with p-type dopants, charge-transfer complexes are created, where the polymer backbone is anionic and the donor is cationic. The increase in conductivity upon treatment with an n-type dopant is not as significant as those achieved upon treatment with a p-type dopant. Polyacetylene chains doped with n-type dopants are extremely sensitive to air and moisture.

Polyacetylene can also be doped electrochemically.

The conductivity of polyacetylene depends on structure and doping. Undoped &quot;trans&quot;-polyacetylene films have a conductivity of 4.4×10−5 Ω−1cm−1, while &quot;cis&quot;-polyacetylene has a lower conductivity of 1.7×10−9 Ω−1cm−1. Doping with bromine causes an increase in conductivity to 0.5 Ω−1cm−1, while a higher conductivity of 38 Ω−1cm−1 is obtained through doping with iodine. Doping of either &quot;cis&quot;- or &quot;trans&quot;-polyacetylene leads to an increase in their conductivities by at least six orders of magnitude. Doped &quot;cis&quot;-polyacetylene films usually have conductivities two or three times greater than doped &quot;trans&quot;-polyacetylene even though the parent film has lower conductivity.

==Properties==
The structure of polyacetylene films have been examined by both infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, and found that the structure depends on synthetic conditions. When the synthesis is performed below −78 °C, the &quot;cis&quot; form predominates, while above 150 °C the &quot;trans&quot; form is favored. At room temperature, the polymerization yields a ratio of 60:40 &quot;cis&quot;:&quot;trans&quot;. Films containing the &quot;cis&quot; form appear coppery, while the &quot;trans&quot; form is silvery. Films of &quot;cis&quot;-polyacetylene are very flexible and can be readily stretched, while &quot;trans&quot;-polyacetylene is much more brittle.

The synthesis and processing of polyacetylene films affects the properties. Increasing the catalyst ratio creates thicker films with a greater draw ratio, allowing them to be stretched further. Lower catalyst loadings leads to the formation of dark red gels, which can be converted to films by cutting and pressing between glass plates. A foam-like material can be obtained from the gel by displacing the solvent with benzene, then freezing and subliming the benzene. Polyacetylene has a bulk density of 0.4 g/cm3, while density of the foam is significantly lower, at 0.02–0.04 g/cm3. The morphology consists of fibrils, with an average width of 200 Å. These fibrils form an irregular, web-like network, with some cross-linking between chains. The insolubility of polyacetylene makes it difficult to characterize this material and to determine the extent of cross-linking in the material.

For applications, polyacetylenes suffer from many drawbacks. They are insoluble in solvents, making it essentially impossible to process the material. While both &quot;cis&quot; and &quot;trans&quot;-polyacetylene show high thermal stability, exposure to air causes a large decrease in the flexibility and conductivity. When polyacetylene is exposed to air, oxidation of the backbone by O2 occurs. Infrared spectroscopy shows formation of carbonyl groups, epoxides, and peroxides. Coating with polyethylene or wax can slow the oxidation temporarily, while coating with glass increases stability indefinitely.

==Applications==
Polyacetylene has no commercial applications, although the discovery of polyacetylene as a conductive organic polymer led to many developments in materials science. Conducting polymers are of interest for solution-processing for film-forming conductive polymers. Therefore, attention has shifted to other conductive polymers for application purposes including polythiophene and polyaniline. Molecular electronics could also be a potential application of conductive polyacetylene.

<text>Poly(&quot;p&quot;-phenylene) (PPP) is made of repeating &quot;p&quot;-phenylene units, which act as the precursor to a conducting polymer of the rigid-rod polymer family. The synthesis of PPP has proven challenging, but has been accomplished through excess polycondensation with the Suzuki coupling method.

Early efforts typically produced black, insoluble powders that were difficult to characterize. For example, a 1962 paper reports &quot;The solid glowed red-hot in a Bunsen flame, with no evidence of flame formation, and disappeared only slowly.&quot; (J. Polym. Sci. (1960), 47, 45) Initially, the chemical and thermal stability of the material drove interest in its synthesis. It was used in rocket nozzles and some fabrics requiring high thermal stability.

Oxidation or the use of dopants is used to convert the non-conductive form to a semiconductor.

<text>William Wouldhave (1751–1821) is a rival of Lionel Lukin for recognition as inventor of the lifeboat. His tombstone (erected thirteen years before Lukin’s) describes him as:

::::::‘&quot;Inventor of that invaluable blessing to mankind the Lifeboat&quot;’.

==Personal history==
William Wouldhave was born in Liddle Street, North Shields, Northumberland in 1751 and baptised in Christ Church then in the parish of Tynemouth. He was apprenticed as a house painter before moving to become parish clerk in South Shields. Wouldhave married with Hannah Crow on 1 March 1775 at the parish church of St Hilda, South Shields. After his death a memorial was erected and that stone still exists (2010) in the former graveyard of St Hilda’s Church, South Shields.

==Invention of the lifeboat==
He did not succeed with the practical application of his invention until 1789, three years after Lukin’s converted coble was presented to Dr Sharpe. In this year a competition was launched to reward any inventor who could provide a craft for the purpose of saving lives from a shipwreck. This following the tragic fate of the doomed Newcastle ship, the &quot;Adventure&quot;, that had gone aground near the coast at the mouth of the Tyne. From the shore, although the shipwreck clearly visible, little could be done to save the passengers and crew who were seen to be dropping from the rigging into the sea.

Wouldhave&#x27;s boat was to be built of copper, made buoyant by the use of cork, and incapable of being capsized. Although it did not meet with full approval, Wouldhave was awarded one guinea for his trouble. Henry Greathead also made a submission, which was deemed to resemble a &quot;butcher&#x27;s tray&quot;, in that it was oblong and was a copy of a U.S. troop carrier, totally unsatisfactory for the short breaking seas of the North East Coast, he was however employed to build a boat designed by the committee, principally by Nicholas Fairles.

Wouldhave&#x27;s claims to have invented the lifeboat were hampered by his poverty and violent language. Mr. Hailes, a mathematician familiar with marine architecture, supported Wouldhave&#x27;s claim to the invention, and believed that the curved keel was an error. In a letter to the editor of The Monthly Magazine dated Feb.16,1807, Hailes says that around the time of Greathead&#x27;s recognition in parliament in 1802, he had asserted Wouldhave&#x27;s right to the invention, and invited Greathead to prove otherwise. He had not done so, apart from some letters to newspapers, and editors continued to present Greathead to the public as the inventor of the lifeboat. In 1806 Hailes published a pamphlet titled &quot;An enquiry concerning the invention of the lifeboat&quot;. In July of that year a letter was published in the Gentlemans Magazine claiming the invention for Lukin.

<text>Peter John Ramos Fuentes (born May 23, 1985), nicknamed as Mr. Beast, is a Puerto Rican former professional basketball player and professional wrestler. He is the sixth athlete from Puerto Rico to play in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the third drafted, gathering success in the NBA Development League (NBDL), where he was an All Star during the 2006–07 season. Ramos has also played in Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN), the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) and the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). He was a member of the Puerto Rico national basketball team from 2004 to 2016, making his Olympic debut in the game where Puerto Rico defeated the United States at Athens.

As a professional wrestler, Ramos began his career in the World Wrestling Council (WWC) in 2019.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ramos&#x27; father abandoned their home when he was five years old. He would then travel to New York with his mother and siblings. Early in his life, Ramos&#x27; unusual height made him victim to verbal harassment. In 1999, when he was fourteen years old, already seven feet tall, Ramos was noticed by former basketball player Santiago Gotay in a clothing store. When Gotay learned that Ramos was born in Puerto Rico he contacted Félix Rivera, owner of the Criollos de Caguas in the National Superior Basketball (BSN).

Rivera decided to recruit Ramos and bring him to the BSN, and traveled to New York to offer him a contract, despite the fact he had not seen him play basketball. Ramos met members of his family when he came to Caguas and he began studies at the Colegio Bautista. Under the guidance of coach Leonel Arril, Ramos began learning the techniques of the basketball game. Ramos continued getting taller, and by 2004 he was already 7&#x27;3&quot;. He led his high school to two National Championships. In the Puerto Rican Basketball League, Ramos developed quickly and in 2002, he won the Most Improved Player Award. In 2003, he earned a spot in the Puerto Rico national basketball team and participated in the Pan American Games.

===National Basketball Association===
Ramos participated in the 2004 season of the BSN, finishing with averages of 20.4 points and 9.4 rebounds per game. In April Ramos announced he would enter the 2004 NBA draft, hinting that he would withdraw if not a top 15 selection. On draft night, he was picked as the 32nd selection in the draft&#x27;s second round, by the Washington Wizards. Frustrated with himself, Ramos abandoned the ceremony once the first round concluded.

During summer of 2004, Ramos participated with the Wizards during the NBA Summer Pro League, and was a member of the 2004 Puerto Rican National Basketball Team which defeated the United States in the 2004 Olympic Games.

During the 2004–05 NBA season Ramos played in six games scoring 11 points with 4 rebounds and 1 block. Ramos spent most of the year on the inactive/injured reserve list.

During the summer of 2005, Ramos participated with the Wizards during the NBA Summer Pro League for a second straight year.

At the start of the 2005–06 season Ramos was assigned to the Roanoke Dazzle of the NBA Development League. He was called up by the Wizards on January 19, 2006, and reassigned back to Roanoke on 21 January. Ramos finished the season in the NBA D-League second in blocks with 78.

In 2006 Ramos participated with the Wizards during the NBA Summer Pro League for a third straight year. And again represented Puerto Rico in the Basketball World Championship 2006. Ramos was waived by the Washington Wizards during 2006 Pre-Season Training Camp. On November 2, 2006, Ramos was drafted by the Idaho Stampede with the 9th pick of the first round of the 2006 NBA Development League draft. That season Ramos was selected as a participant for the NBDL All-Star Game, but did not participate in All Star game due to injury. On February 28, 2007, Ramos was waived by the Idaho Stampede due to injury. Ramos earned All-NBA Development League Honorable Mention for his 2006–07 performance.

===Puerto Rico and Europe===
In 2007 Ramos returned to the Criollos de Caguas of the National Superior Basketball after a two-year absence. He finished with an average of 17.5 points per game.

In 2007, Ramos represented Puerto Rico as a member of the Puerto Rican National Basketball Team during the 2007 Pan American Games, winning the silver medal.

Ramos signed with Alta Gestión Fuenlabrada to play in the 2007–08 season of the Spanish Liga ACB league. Ramos played the 2008 BSN season with averages of 17.5 points and 9.8 rebounds per game. He was selected as a starter in the 2008 BSN All-Star Game, where he was selected the game&#x27;s most valuable player and scored twenty-two points and nine rebounds. While Caguas participated in the BSN &quot;Super-6&quot; round, Ramos claimed that he had matured since traveling to Spain, which helped him in his game. Ramos later played for the Piratas de Quebradillas, Capitanes de Arecibo and currently is playing with Los Brujos de Guayama in Puerto Rico.

In 2018, he returned to Puerto Rico,to play with the Leones de Ponce. He was selected as part the reserves of the All Star team for the league&#x27;s all star game against the Puerto Rican National Team.

===Asia===
In 2011, Ramos signed with the Seoul Samsung Thunders in South Korea.
On November 7, 2011, he was released from Seoul Samsung Thunders after averaging 18.1 pts. and 9.9 reb. In December 2014, Ramos signed with the Kia Carnival at the Philippine Basketball Association and will play as an import for the team at the 2015 PBA Commissioner&#x27;s Cup. Ramos was chosen by Kia head coach Manny Pacquiao for his shot blocking skills. Kia is banking on Ramos to turn its fortunes around after finishing its maiden PBA conference with a woeful 1–10 win–loss record.

In 2017, the 25th of February, Ramos signed with one of the best Clubs in Asia Club Sagesse from Lebanon.

In 2018, he joined Alab Pilipinas with fellow Puerto Rican, Renaldo Balkman. With Ramos and Balkman, the Philippine squad managed to dominate the league but fell short in two games against the Eastern Sports Club (basketball) of Hong Kong in the playoffs.

==Professional wrestling career==
===World Wrestling Council (2019–2020)===
In 2016, Ramos expressed interest in making a crossover into professional wrestling following his retirement from basketball, noting he had already declined invitations to do so. Others in his family were already involved in the business, his brother-in-law is an in-ring performer and his sister is a referee. Two years later he reaffirmed this plan, believing that the retirement of several high-profile tall wrestlers created more opportunities to succeed. On September 18, 2019, Ramos made his first backstage appearance for the World Wrestling Council, becoming involved in a segment with Puerto Rico Heavyweight Champion Pedro Portillo III. This led to Ramos appearing as the guest referee of a retirement match between Ray González and Gilbert (storyline boss to Portillo) at Noche de Campeones. Prior to this, Carlos Colón Sr. noted that he was monitoring his progress.

Ramos was booked in a heel turn on González, afterward joining the villainous faction known as El Sindicato, which was disbanded at the end of the season. Afterwards he became the enforcer of a nascent stable known as The Dynasty, joining Eddie Colón and Gilbert. Ramos’ in ring debut took place on January 25, 2020, in a handicap match where he easily defeated two independent wrestlers. The following week he scored another swift win over Jax, a third party performer for the regional Borinquén Sport Promotion (BSP). An extreme rules match against fellow multi-sport athlete Carlos Cotto was scheduled for February 15, 2019, but later postponed when Ramos refused to perform in “a small town” by citing contractual clauses. This role actually helped his basketball career, since it allowed him to drop 30 pounds and begin the 2020 BSN season in shape.

===Beast Mode (2020–present)===
During the hiatus caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Ramos left WWC and joined Germán Figueroa to form a team known as Beast Mode, with Qatar Pro Wrestling as their first promotion abroad. When the BSN resumed the 2020 season in a bubble, he didn&#x27;t participate with the Leones in order to dedicate full time to professional wrestling. On December 18, 2021, Beast Mode made its debut for Organization International de Lucha (OIL) with a win over Sons of Samoa. The alliance that this company had with Robles Promotions led to Ramos wrestling in Mexico in January 2022, adopting Mr. Beast as his ring name. The team also made appearances for Wrestling República Dominicana (WRD).

In 2023, Ramos joined the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and debuted in &quot;NWA Powerrr&quot; against Trevor Murdoch, performing under the ring name Beast Mode.

<text>In horticulture, the term (&quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, &quot;through the year&quot;) is used to differentiate a plant from shorter-lived annuals and biennials. It has thus been defined as a plant that lives more than 2 years. The term is also loosely used to distinguish plants with little or no woody growth (secondary growth in girth) from trees and shrubs, which are also technically &quot;perennials&quot;. Notably, it is estimated that 94% of plant species fall under the category of perennials, underscoring the prevalence of plants with lifespans exceeding two years in the botanical world.

Perennials (especially small flowering plants) that grow and bloom over the spring and summer, die back every autumn and winter, and then return in the spring from their rootstock or other overwintering structure, are known as [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] perennials. However, depending on the rigours of the local climate (temperature, moisture, organic content in the soil, microorganisms), a plant that is a perennial in its native habitat, may be treated by a gardener as an annual and planted out every year, from seed, from cuttings, or from divisions. Tomato vines, for example, live several years in their natural tropical/ subtropical habitat but are grown as annuals in temperate regions because their above-ground biomass does not survive the winter.

There is also a class of evergreen perennials which lack woody stems, such as &quot;Bergenia&quot; which retain a mantle of leaves throughout the year. An intermediate class of plants is known as subshrubs, which retain a vestigial woody structure in winter, e.g. &quot;Penstemon&quot;.

The symbol for a perennial plant, based on &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; by Linnaeus, is , which is also the astronomical symbol for the planet Jupiter.

==Life cycle and structure==
Perennial plants can be short-lived (only a few years) or long-lived. They include a wide assortment of plant groups from non-flowering plants like ferns and liverworts to highly diverse flowering plants like orchids, grasses, and woody plants. Plants that flower and fruit only once and then die are termed monocarpic or semelparous; these species may live for many years before they flower. For example, a century plant can live for 80 years and grow 30 meters tall before flowering and dying. However, most perennials are polycarpic (or iteroparous), flowering over many seasons in their lifetime. Perennials invest more resources than annuals into roots, crowns, and other structures that allow them to live from one year to the next. They often have a competitive advantage because they can commence their growth and leaf out earlier in the growing season, and can grow taller than annuals. In doing so they can better compete for space and collect more light.

Perennials typically grow structures that allow them to adapt to living from one year to the next through a form of vegetative reproduction rather than seeding. These structures include bulbs, tubers, woody crowns, rhizomes, turions, woody stems, or crowns which allows them to survive periods of dormancy over cold or dry seasons; these structures typically store carbohydrates which are used once the dormancy period is over and new growth begins. In climates that are warm all year long, perennials may grow continuously. Annuals which complete their life cycle in one growing season, in contrast with perennials, produce seeds as the next generation and die; the seeds may survive cold or dry periods or germinate soon after dispersal depending on the climate.

Some perennials retain their foliage year-round; these are evergreen perennials. Deciduous perennials shed all their leaves part of the year. Deciduous perennials include herbaceous and woody plants; herbaceous plants have stems that lack hard, fibrous growth, while woody plants have stems with buds that survive above ground during dormancy. Some perennials are semi-deciduous, meaning they lose some of their leaves in either winter or summer. Deciduous perennials shed their leaves when growing conditions are no longer suitable for photosynthesis, such as when it is too cold or dry. In many parts of the world, seasonality is expressed as wet and dry periods rather than warm and cold periods, and deciduous perennials lose their leaves in the dry season.

Some perennial plants are protected from wildfires because they have underground roots that produce adventitious shoots, bulbs, crowns, or stems; other perennials like trees and shrubs may have thick cork layers that protect the stems. Herbaceous perennials from temperate and alpine regions of the world can tolerate the cold during winter.

Perennial plants may remain dormant for long periods and then recommence growth and reproduction when the environment is more suitable, while most annual plants complete their life cycle during one growing period, and biennials have two growing periods.

The meristem of perennial plants communicates with the hormones produced due to environmental situations (i.e., seasons), reproduction, and stage of development to begin and halt the ability to grow or flower. There is also a distinction between the ability to grow and the actual task of growth. For example, most trees regain the ability to grow during winter but do not initiate physical growth until the spring and summer months. The start of dormancy can be seen in perennial plants through withering flowers, loss of leaves on trees, and halting of reproduction in both flowering and budding plants.

Perennial species may produce relatively large seeds that have the advantage of generating larger seedlings that can better compete with other plants. Perennials also produce seeds over many years.

An important aspect of cold acclimation is overexpression of DNA repair genes. In &quot;Thinopyrum intermedium&quot; a perennial relative of common wheat &quot;Triticum aestivum&quot;, conditions of freezing stress were shown to be associated with large increases in expression of two DNA repair genes (one gene product a photolyase and the other, a protein involved in nucleotide excision repair).

==Cultivation==
Perennials that are cultivated include: woody plants like fruit trees grown for their edible fruits; shrubs and trees grown as landscaping ornamentals; herbaceous food crops like asparagus, rhubarb, strawberries; and subtropical plants not hardy in colder areas such as tomatoes, eggplant, and coleus (which are treated as annuals in colder areas). Perennials also include plants grown for their flowering and other ornamental value including bulbs (like tulips, narcissus, and gladiolus); lawn grass, and other groundcovers, (such as periwinkle and &quot;Dichondra&quot;).
Each type of plant must be separated differently; for example, plants with fibrous root systems like daylilies, Siberian iris, or grasses can be pried apart with two garden forks inserted back to back, or cut by knives. However, plants such as bearded irises have a root system of rhizomes; these root systems should be planted with the top of the rhizome just above ground level, with leaves from the following year showing. The point of dividing perennials is to increase the amount of a single breed of plant in your garden. In the United States more than 900 million dollars worth of potted herbaceous perennial plants were sold in 2019.

==Benefits in agriculture==

Although most of humanity is fed by the re-sowing of the seeds of annual grain crops, (either naturally or by the manual efforts of humans), perennial crops provide numerous benefits. Perennial plants often have deep, extensive root systems which can hold soil to prevent erosion, capture dissolved nitrogen before it can contaminate ground and surface water, and out-compete weeds (reducing the need for herbicides). These potential benefits of perennials have resulted in new attempts to increase the seed yield of perennial species, which could result in the creation of new perennial grain crops. Some examples of new perennial crops being developed are perennial rice and intermediate wheatgrass. A perennial rice developed in 2018, was reported in 2023, to have provided a similar yield to replanted annual rice when evaluated over eight consecutive harvests.

==Location==
Perennial plants dominate many natural ecosystems on land and in fresh water, with only a very few (e.g. &quot;Zostera&quot;) occurring in shallow sea water. Herbaceous perennial plants are particularly dominant in conditions too fire-prone for trees and shrubs, e.g., most plants on prairies and steppes are perennials; they are also dominant on tundra too cold for tree growth. Nearly all forest plants are perennials, including trees and shrubs.

Perennial plants are usually better long-term competitors, especially under stable, resource-poor conditions. This is due to the development of larger root systems which can access water and soil nutrients deeper in the soil and to earlier emergence in the spring. Annual plants have an advantage in disturbed environments because of their faster growth and reproduction rates.

==Types==
* Herbaceous – plants that have foliage and stems that die to the ground at the end of the growing season and which show only primary growth. Examples include frost-tender plants such as Rudbeckias, Mirabilis jalapa, Momordica charantia, mint, tobacco, common purslane, alfalfa, petunias, Thinopyrum intermedium, Red clover, Hylotelephium telephium and Cochliasanthus caracalla.
* Evergreen – plants that have persistent foliage without woody stems. Examples include many Senecios, Begonia, Gaillardias, Dimorphothecas, Gazanias, Thunbergias, Dietes, Osteospermums, Tradescantias and Vincas, among others.
* Woody – plants with persistent above ground stem that survive from one growing season to the next, with primary and secondary growth, or growth in width protected by an outer cortex. Some may be deciduous. Examples of many shrubs, lianas and trees such as Ipomeas, banana, lilacs, Geraniums, Lantanas, Hydrangeas, Nandinas, Pandoreas, grape, Hederas, pine, apple, Jasmines, Trachelospermums, Gardenias, Plumbagos, Cistus and Rosas, among others.
* Monocarpic – plants that flower, set seeds once and then die. Examples include, &quot;Agave&quot; and some species of &quot;Streptocarpus&quot;

==List of perennials==
Each section contains a short list of species related to that topic, these are an example as the true lists would fill several books.
===Perennial flowers===
Perennials grown for their decorative flowers include very many species and types. Some examples include:

* Achillea
* Aster
* Bergenia
* Dahlia
* Foxglove
* Hollyhock
* Kniphofia
* Lupin
* Salvia
* Phlox
===Perennial fruits===
The majority of fruit bearing plants are perennial even in temperate climates. Examples include:

* Apple
* Blackcurrant
* Blueberry
* Blackberry
* Currant
* Grape
* Pear
* Plum
* Raspberries
* Strawberry
===Perennial herbs===
Many herbs are perennial, including these examples:

* Fennel
* Mint
* Rosemary
* Sage
* Thyme
===Perennial vegetables===

Many vegetable plants can grow as perennials in tropical climates, but die in cold weather. Examples of some of the more completely perennial vegetables are:

* Asparagus
* Chives
* Globe artichoke
* Jerusalem artichoke
* Kale
* Leek
* New Zealand spinach
* Rhubarb
* Sea kale
* Sweet potato
===Aquatic plants===

Many aquatic plants are perennial even though many do not have woody tissue. Examples include:
* Crassula helmsii – New Zealand Stonecrop
* Pontederia cordata – Pickerell weed
* Stratiotes aloides – Water Soldier which sinks to the bottom of the pond in winter
* Utricularia vulgaris – Common bladderwort which produces turions as its overwintering stage

The region is divided into five regional county municipalities (French: &quot;municipalité régionale de comté&quot;, or MRC) and 79 municipalities. Its economy continues to be dominated by resource extraction industries. These include logging and mining all along the rich geologic Cadillac Fault between Val-d&#x27;Or and Rouyn-Noranda, as well as agriculture.

==History==

The Algonquins are indigenous to the region. The first French expeditions were made in 1670 by Radisson as part of the development of the fur trade industry across the Hudson Bay region and through most of the New France colony. Fort Témiscamingue, located on the east banks of Lake Timiskaming and erected by a French merchant on Anishinaabe lands in 1720, was an important crossroads of the fur trade along the Hudson Bay trading route.

Until 1868, Abitibi was owned by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company; it was then purchased by Canada and became part of the North-West Territories. After negotiations with the federal government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Abitibi was annexed to the province of Quebec on June 13, 1898, by a federal decree. For its part, Témiscamingue had been part of Lower Canada and so was already part of Quebec at Confederation.

The region started to develop during the late 19th and early 20th century, with the development of agriculture and forest industries. This began in the southern areas, leading to the foundation of Ville-Marie in 1886 and Témiscaming in 1918. However, the greatest wave of colonization occurred between World War I and World War II when a large population came from urban centres due to the effects of the Great Depression. In the 1930s, federal and provincial plans such as the Plan Vautrin and the Plan Gordon incited jobless residents to move to undeveloped regions of the province, igniting the beginning of the second colonization flow.

The first migration flow brought people to the northern part of the region along the National Transcontinental Railway, leading to the establishment of towns such as La Sarre in 1917 and Amos in 1914, as well as other infrastructure as the internment camp at Spirit Lake for so-called enemy aliens arrested under the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; during World War I.

The mining industry, mainly extracting gold and copper, also contributed to the growth of the region when numerous mines were opened. New cities were created, such as Rouyn-Noranda in 1926 and Val-d&#x27;Or in 1934, and mining is still the backbone of the region&#x27;s economy nowadays, along with forestry and agriculture.

As an administrative region, it was created in March 1966, when the entire province was reorganized into 10 regions. Originally called Nord-Ouest (North-West), the region was renamed to Abitibi-Témiscamingue in 1981.

==Geography==

The Abitibi-Témiscamingue region is the fourth largest region of the province after the Nord-du-Québec, Côte-Nord and Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean regions. It has a total area of 65,000 km2. Its largest cities are Rouyn-Noranda and Val-d&#x27;Or.

The region&#x27;s landscape features mixed forest to the south across the Témiscamingue area which falls within the St. Laurence watershed of southern Quebec, while boreal forest covers the Abitibi section further north in the Hudson Bay watershed of northern Quebec.

The southern part of the region has a humid continental climate, while the northern part has more of a sub-arctic climate due to its latitude and its proximity to Hudson Bay and the Arctic.

==National park==

Aiguebelle National Park, the only national park of the region, is located in the centre of the Abitibian region and intends to protect natural heritage.

==Economy==

The region&#x27;s workforce has one of the highest percentages in the primary sector of any region of Quebec, with nearly one out of six employees working in that sector. The mining sector is the most important economic activity of the region. Despite recent declines in workforce, the agriculture and forest industries still contribute significantly to the region&#x27;s economy.
Economic activities are mainly dedicated to exportation products, and are even closely linked to the Middle North region in its development through hydroelectrical and mining projects, and through exchanges with First Nation northern communities.

Sportive tourism, including winter sports, fishing, hunting and cycling competition, is also a significant economic sector even if negligible by comparison with the industrial sector.

==Colleges and universities==

===University===

The region is home to one university: UQAT — the Université du Québec en Abitibi-Témiscamingue, which is part of the Quebec public university network. UQAT has its main campus at Rouyn-Noranda, a campus dedicated to the first nations at Val-d&#x27;Or and several branches in different cities of the region.

===College===
The only college in the region is the Cégep de l&#x27;Abitibi-Témiscamingue, which has campuses in Amos, Rouyn-Noranda and Val-d&#x27;Or, and centres for continuing education in Ville-Marie and La Sarre.

==Architecture and urban planning==

Because of its history and its development, the regional urban planning and the architectural landscape is quite rich in contrasts, showing two main typologies of development.

===Rural and agricultural settlement===

The agricultural development of northern Abitibi and the northern part of Témiscamingue by a relatively homogeneous population of French Canadian Catholic settlers has introduced a mainly rural land development. There, small towns, gravitating around a low density node generally composed of a wooden Roman Catholic church, an elementary school and few houses spread over the territory, according to an orthogonal division on the land, with rectangular parcels. Those small towns are gravitating themselves around a larger city, as La Sarre, Amos, Macamic and Ville-Marie, where major institutions are established. If small towns might seem more or less vernacular, major cities are often more planned and influenced by British urban planning, with sometime an orthogonal grid with lane network.
Because of their central location, main architectural elements are also on those cities. For instance, the Cathedral of Sainte-Thérèse d&#x27;Avila in Amos is one of the most outstanding architectural element of the region by its size and its Romano-Byzantine style, standing on the upper part of the city, and being at a symbolic central location of the region. However, if the cityscapes are often more various, the rural landscape features more local particularities. The wooden farms and barns built according to many vernacular forms, the fieldstone churches and the wooden houses with locally so-called “Canadian Roof” (steep roof ending with long curved overhang covering a front balcony) are widespread.

===Boomtowns and industrial cities===

The cities of Southern Abitibi and the city of Témiscaming were established later and for industrial concerns, and follow a quite different organization. As they grew up often very quickly, the urban planning of these industrial cities is often eclectic. The initial boroughs of Val-d’Or and Rouyn-Noranda, for instance, are both built according to two different schemes; an industrial and planned borough built and planned by the mine, and a “boomtown” borough built suddenly with minimal planning for the thousands of people who arrived attracted by the effervescence of the gold rush. Bourlamaque mining village is a remarkable example of a borough planned by the mine still visible today in Val-d&#x27;Or, with its log houses for workers orderly settled between the mine and the commercial streets, this, at a glace from the foremen’s houses and the hospital.

Noranda was also built according to that scheme, however, the other great example of an industrial town is Témiscaming. The Témiscaming Garden City plan, designed by Scottish architect Thomas Adams (1871–1940) is a rare example in Quebec of a mono-industrial city where a company planned and endeavoured to grant comfort of its workers. There, the dwellings, and even the plan, which follows the shape of the hill, was not alone to grant this comfort, elements as Italian renaissance fountain, landscaping were also included into the cityscape.

Those cities, and many other industrial cities of that part of the region, contrast with the rest of the region, and even generally with the other country regions of Quebec. As the mining industry was mainly led by owners coming from the anglosphere in the early 20th century, industrial towns even show more similarities with Ontarian industrial cities than other cities in Quebec. Added to North American modernity concerns of the 1930s and 1940s, streets are broader and often have numbered names, blocks are orthogonally organized with lanes where boomtown buildings with their peculiar facades are aligned along the main streets while residential buildings take place nearby. Many mining cities disappeared or have decreased since, but their industrial core often keep being seenable today. Duparquet and Cadillac, for example, have kept their boomtown appearance, through their street organization, even if the industrial and population exodus gave them a look of oversized village.

Moreover, the multi-cultural settlement of those towns brought many singular architectural elements. The Russian Orthodox and Catholic Ukrainian churches in Val-d’Or and Rouyn add to the omnipresent architectural eclecticism. Nowadays, confronted with urban sprawl, those cities tend to develop in a very low density and functionalistic way, as other Quebec and North American cities. Some great buildings dominate the architectural landscape, as the Rouyn-Noranda campus of the Université du Québec, which could be seen by many aspects as the greatest element of contemporary architecture of the region.

==Sports==

The region hosts the yearly Tour de l&#x27;Abitibi, which first took place in 1969, and which is still the only North American stopover point of the Union Cycliste Internationale Junior World Cup. Abitibi-Témiscamingue also hosts a long segment of the Route Verte, the most extensive bicycle and multipurpose recreational trail in North America.

No professional league sports teams are based in Abitibi. It is home to two Quebec Major Junior Hockey League teams: the Val-d&#x27;Or Foreurs and the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies.

<text>Polythiophenes (PTs) are polymerized thiophenes, a sulfur heterocycle. The parent PT is an insoluble colored solid with the formula (C4H2S)n. The rings are linked through the 2- and 5-positions. Poly(alkylthiophene)s have alkyl substituents at the 3- or 4-position(s). They are also colored solids, but tend to be soluble in organic solvents.

PTs become conductive when oxidized. The electrical conductivity results from the delocalization of electrons along the polymer backbone. Conductivity however is not the only interesting property resulting from electron delocalization. The optical properties of these materials respond to environmental stimuli, with dramatic color shifts in response to changes in solvent, temperature, applied potential, and binding to other molecules. Changes in both color and conductivity are induced by the same mechanism, twisting of the polymer backbone and disrupting conjugation, making conjugated polymers attractive as sensors that can provide a range of optical and electronic responses.

The development of polythiophenes and related conductive organic polymers was recognized by the awarding of the 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Alan J. Heeger, Alan MacDiarmid, and Hideki Shirakawa &quot;for the discovery and development of conductive polymers&quot;.

==Mechanism of conductivity and doping==
PT is an ordinary organic polymer, being a red solid that is poorly soluble in most solvents. Upon treatment with oxidizing agents (electron-acceptors) however, the material takes on a dark color and becomes electrically conductive. Oxidation is referred to as &quot;doping&quot;. Around 0.2 equivalent of oxidant is used to convert PTs (and other conducting polymers) into the optimally conductive state. Thus about one of every five rings is oxidized. Many different oxidants are used. Because of the redox reaction, the conductive form of polythiophene is a salt. An idealized stoichiometry is shown using the oxidant [A]PF6:
:(C4H2S)n + 1/5n [A]PF6 → (C4H2S)n(PF6)0.2n + 1/5 nA
In principle, PT can be n-doped using reducing agents, but this approach is rarely practiced.

Upon &quot;p-doping&quot;, charged unit called a bipolaron is formed. The bipolaron moves as a unit along the polymer chain and is responsible for the macroscopically observed conductivity of the material. Conductivity can approach 1000 S/cm. In comparison, the conductivity of copper is approximately 5×105 S/cm. Generally, the conductivity of PTs is lower than 1000 S/cm, but high conductivity is not necessary for many applications, e.g. as an antistatic film.

===Oxidants===
A variety of reagents have been used to dope PTs. Iodine and bromine produce highly conductive materials, which are unstable owing to slow evaporation of the halogen. Organic acids, including trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, and sulfonic acids produce PTs with lower conductivities than iodine, but with higher environmental stabilities. Oxidative polymerization with ferric chloride can result in doping by residual catalyst, although matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) studies have shown that poly(3-hexylthiophene)s are also partially halogenated by the residual oxidizing agent. Poly(3-octylthiophene) dissolved in toluene can be doped by solutions of ferric chloride hexahydrate dissolved in acetonitrile, and can be cast into films with conductivities reaching 1 S/cm. Other, less common p-dopants include gold trichloride and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid.

==Structure and optical properties==

===Conjugation length===
The extended π-systems of conjugated PTs produce some of the most interesting properties of these materials—their optical properties. As an approximation, the conjugated backbone can be considered as a real-world example of the &quot;electron-in-a-box&quot; solution to the Schrödinger equation; however, the development of refined models to accurately predict absorption and fluorescence spectra of well-defined oligo(thiophene) systems is ongoing. Conjugation relies upon overlap of the π-orbitals of the aromatic rings, which, in turn, requires the thiophene rings to be coplanar. The number of coplanar rings determines the conjugation length—the longer the conjugation length, the lower the separation between adjacent energy levels, and the longer the absorption wavelength. Deviation from coplanarity may be permanent, resulting from mislinkages during synthesis or especially bulky side chains; or temporary, resulting from changes in the environment or binding. This twist in the backbone reduces the conjugation length, and the separation between energy levels is increased. This results in a shorter absorption wavelength.

Determining the maximum effective conjugation length requires the synthesis of regioregular PTs of defined length. The absorption band in the visible region is increasingly red-shifted as the conjugation length increases, and the maximum effective conjugation length is calculated as the saturation point of the red-shift. Early studies by ten Hoeve &quot;et al.&quot; estimated that the effective conjugation extended over 11 repeat units, while later studies increased this estimate to 20 units. Using the absorbance and emission profile of discrete conjugated oligo(3-hexylthiophene)s prepared through polymerization and separation, Lawrence &quot;et al.&quot; determined the effective conjugation length of poly(3-hexylthiophene) to be 14 units. The effective conjugation length of polythiophene derivatives depend on the chemical structure of side chains, and thiophene backbones.

The absorption band of poly (3-thiophene acetic acid) in aqueous solutions of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) shifts from 480 nm at pH 7 to 415 nm at pH 4. This is attributed to formation of a compact coil structure, which can form hydrogen bonds with PVA upon partial deprotonation of the acetic acid group.

Shifts in PT absorption bands due to changes in temperature result from a conformational transition from a coplanar, rodlike structure at lower temperatures to a nonplanar, coiled structure at elevated temperatures. For example, poly(3-(octyloxy)-4-methylthiophene) undergoes a color change from red–violet at 25 °C to pale yellow at 150 °C. An isosbestic point (a point where the absorbance curves at all temperatures overlap) indicates coexistence between two phases, which may exist on the same chain or on different chains. Not all thermochromic PTs exhibit an isosbestic point: highly regioregular poly(3-alkylthiophene)s (PATs) show a continuous blue-shift with increasing temperature if the side chains are short enough so that they do not melt and interconvert between crystalline and disordered phases at low temperatures.

===Optical effects===
The optical properties of PTs can be sensitive to many factors. PTs exhibit absorption shifts due to application of electric potentials (electrochromism), or to introduction of alkali ions (ionochromism). Soluble PATs exhibit both thermochromism and solvatochromism (see above) in chloroform and 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran.
==Substituted polythiophenes==
Polythiophene and its oxidized derivatives have poor processing properties. They are insoluble in ordinary solvents and do not melt readily. For example, doped unsubstituted PTs are only soluble in exotic solvents such as arsenic trifluoride and arsenic pentafluoride. Although only poorly processable, &quot;the expected high temperature stability and potentially very high electrical conductivity of PT films (if made) still make it a highly desirable material.&quot; Nonetheless, intense interest has focused on soluble polythiophenes, which usually translates to polymers derived from 3-alkylthiophenes, which give the so-called polyalkylthiophenes (PATs).

===3-Alkylthiophenes===
Soluble polymers are derivable from 3-substituted thiophenes where the 3-substituent is butyl or longer. Copolymers also are soluble, e.g., poly(3-methylthiophene-&#x27;co&#x27;-3&#x27;-octylthiophene).

One undesirable feature of 3-alkylthiophenes is the variable regioregularity of the polymer. Focusing on the polymer microstructure at the dyad level, 3-substituted thiophenes can couple to give any of three dyads:
*2,5&#x27;, or head–tail (HT), coupling
*2,2&#x27;, or head–head (HH), coupling
*5,5&#x27;, or tail–tail (TT), coupling
These three diads can be combined into four distinct triads. The triads are distinguishable by NMR spectroscopy.

Regioregularity affects the properties of PTs. A regiorandom copolymer of 3-methylthiophene and 3-butylthiophene possessed a conductivity of 50 S/cm, whereas a more regioregular copolymer with a 2:1 ratio of HT to HH couplings had a higher conductivity of 140 S/cm. Films of regioregular poly(3-(4-octylphenyl)thiophene) (POPT) with greater than 94% HT content possessed conductivities of 4 S/cm, compared with 0.4 S/cm for regioirregular POPT. PATs prepared using Rieke zinc formed &quot;crystalline, flexible, and bronze-colored films with a metallic luster&quot;. On the other hand, the corresponding regiorandom polymers produced &quot;amorphous and orange-colored films&quot;. Comparison of the thermochromic properties of the Rieke PATs showed that, while the regioregular polymers showed strong thermochromic effects, the absorbance spectra of the regioirregular polymers did not change significantly at elevated temperatures. Finally, Fluorescence absorption and emission maxima of poly(3-hexylthiophene)s occur at increasingly lower wavelengths (higher energy) with increasing HH dyad content. The difference between absorption and emission maxima, the Stokes shift, also increases with HH dyad content, which they attributed to greater relief from conformational strain in the first excited state.

===Special substituents===
Water-soluble PT&#x27;s are represented by sodium poly(3-thiophenealkanesulfonate)s. In addition to conferring water solubility, the pendant sulfonate groups act as counterions, producing self-doped conducting polymers. Substituted PTs with tethered carboxylic acids also exhibit water solubility. and urethanes

Thiophenes with chiral substituents at the 3 position have been polymerized. Such chiral PTs in principle could be employed for detection or separation of chiral analytes.

Poly(3-(perfluorooctyl)thiophene)s is soluble in supercritical carbon dioxide Oligothiophenes capped at both ends with thermally-labile alkyl esters were cast as films from solution, and then heated to remove the solublizing end groups. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images showed a significant increase in long-range order after heating.

Fluorinated polythiophene yield 7% efficiency in polymer-fullerene solar cells.

===PEDOT===
The 3,4-disubstituted thiophene called ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) is the precursor to the polymer PEDOT. Regiochemistry is not an issue in since this monomer is symmetrical. PEDOT is found in electrochromic displays, photovoltaics, electroluminescent displays, printed wiring, and sensors.

==Synthesis==
===Electrochemical synthesis===
In an electrochemical polymerization, a solution containing thiophene and an electrolyte produces a conductive PT film on the anode. Electrochemical polymerization is convenient, since the polymer does not need to be isolated and purified, but it can produce polymers with undesirable alpha-beta linkages and varying degrees of regioregularity. The stoichiometry of the electropolymerization is:

:n C4H4S → (C4H2S)n + 2n H+ + 2n e−

The degree of polymerization and quality of the resulting polymer depends upon the electrode material, current density, temperature, solvent, electrolyte, presence of water, and monomer concentration.

Electron-donating substituents lower the oxidation potential, whereas electron-withdrawing groups increase the oxidation potential. Thus, 3-methylthiophene polymerizes in acetonitrile and tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate at a potential of about 1.5 V vs. SCE, whereas unsubstituted thiophene requires an additional 0.2 V. Steric hindrance resulting from branching at the α-carbon of a 3-substituted thiophene inhibits polymerization.

In terms of mechanism, oxidation of the thiophene monomer produces a radical cation, which then couple with another monomer to produce a radical cation dimer.

===From bromothiophenes===
Chemical synthesis offers two advantages compared with electrochemical synthesis of PTs: a greater selection of monomers, and, using the proper catalysts, the ability to synthesize perfectly regioregular substituted PTs. PTs were chemically synthesized by accident more than a century ago. Chemical syntheses from 2,5-dibromothiophene use Kumada coupling and related reactions
Regioregular PTs have been prepared by lithiation 2-bromo-3-alkylthiophenes using Kumada cross-coupling. This method produces approximately 100% HT–HT couplings, according to NMR spectroscopy analysis of the diads. 2,5-Dibromo-3-alkylthiophene when treated with highly reactive &quot;Rieke zinc&quot; is an alternative method.
===Routes employing chemical oxidants===
In contrast to methods that require brominated monomers, the oxidative polymerization of thiophenes using ferric chloride proceeds at room temperature. The approach was reported by Sugimoto &quot;et al.&quot; in 1986. The stoichiometry is analogous to that of electropolymerization.

This method has proven to be extremely popular; antistatic coatings are prepared on a commercial scale using ferric chloride. In addition to ferric chloride, other oxidizing agents have been reported. Slow addition of ferric chloride to the monomer solution produced poly(3-(4-octylphenyl)thiophene)s with approximately 94% H–T content. Precipitation of ferric chloride in situ (in order to maximize the surface area of the catalyst) produced significantly higher yields and monomer conversions than adding monomer directly to crystalline catalyst. Higher molecular weights were reported when dry air was bubbled through the reaction mixture during polymerization. Exhaustive Soxhlet extraction after polymerization with polar solvents was found to effectively fractionate the polymer and remove residual catalyst before NMR spectroscopy. Using a lower ratio of catalyst to monomer (2:1, rather than 4:1) may increase the regioregularity of poly(3-dodecylthiophene)s. Andreani &quot;et al.&quot; reported higher yields of soluble poly(dialkylterthiophene)s in carbon tetrachloride rather than chloroform, which they attributed to the stability of the radical species in carbon tetrachloride. Higher-quality catalyst, added at a slower rate and at reduced temperature, was shown to produce high molecular weight PATs with no insoluble polymer residue. Factorial experiments indicate that the catalyst/monomer ratio correlated with increased yield of poly(3-octylthiophene). Longer polymerization time also increased the yield.
In terms of mechanism, the oxidative polymerization using ferric chloride, a radical pathway has been proposed. Niemi &quot;et al.&quot; reported that polymerization was only observed in solvents where the catalyst was either partially or completely insoluble (chloroform, toluene, carbon tetrachloride, pentane, and hexane, and not diethyl ether, xylene, acetone, or formic acid), and speculated that the polymerization may occur at the surface of solid ferric chloride. However, this is challenged by the fact that the reaction also proceeds in acetonitrile, which FeCl3 is soluble in. Quantum mechanical calculations also point to a radical mechanism. The mechanism can also be inferred from the regiochemistry of the dimerization of 3-methylthiophene since C2 in [3-methylthiophene]+ has the highest spin density.

A carbocation mechanism is inferred from the structure of 3-(4-octylphenyl)thiophene prepared from ferric chloride.

Polymerization of thiophene can be effected by a solution of ferric chloride in acetonitrile. The kinetics of thiophene polymerization also seemed to contradict the predictions of the radical polymerization mechanism. Barbarella &quot;et al.&quot; studied the oligomerization of 3-(alkylsulfanyl)thiophenes, and concluded from their quantum mechanical calculations, and considerations of the enhanced stability of the radical cation when delocalized over a planar conjugated oligomer, that a radical cation mechanism analogous to that generally accepted for electrochemical polymerization was more likely. Given the difficulties of studying a system with a heterogeneous, strongly oxidizing catalyst that produces difficult to characterize rigid-rod polymers, the mechanism of oxidative polymerization is by no means decided. The radical cation mechanism is generally accepted.

==Applications==

As an example of a static application, product (&quot;Clevios P&quot;) from Heraeus has been extensively used as an antistatic coating (as packaging materials for electronic components, for example). AGFA coats 200 m × 10 m of photographic film per year with PEDOT:PSS because of its antistatic properties. The thin layer of PEDOT:PSS is virtually transparent and colorless, prevents electrostatic discharges during film rewinding, and reduces dust buildup on the negatives after processing.

===Proposed applications===
PEDOT also has been proposed for dynamic applications where a potential is applied to a polymer film. PEDOT-coated windows and mirrors become opaque or reflective upon the application of an electric potential, a manifestation of its electrochromic properties. Widespread adoption of electrochromic windows promise significant savings in air conditioning costs.

Another potential application include field-effect transistors, electroluminescent devices, solar cells, photochemical resists, nonlinear optic devices, batteries, diodes, and chemical sensors. In general, two categories of applications are proposed for conducting polymers. Static applications rely upon the intrinsic conductivity of the materials, combined with their processing and material properties common to polymeric materials. Dynamic applications utilize changes in the conductive and optical properties, resulting either from application of electric potentials or from environmental stimuli.

PTs have been touted as sensor elements. In addition to biosensor applications, PTs can also be functionalized with receptors for detecting metal ions or chiral molecules as well. PTs with pendant crown ether functionalities exhibit properties that vary with the alkali metal. and main-chain.

Polythiophenes show potential in the treatment of prion diseases.

<text>Polypyrrole (PPy) is an organic polymer obtained by oxidative polymerization of pyrrole. It is a solid with the formula H(C4H2NH)nH. It is an intrinsically conducting polymer, used in electronics, optical, biological and medical fields.

==History==
Some of the first examples of PPy were reported in 1919 by Angeli and Pieroni, who reported the formation of pyrrole blacks from pyrrole magnesium bromide. Since then pyrrole oxidation reaction has been studied and reported in scientific literature.

Work on conductive polymers including polypyrrole, polythiophene, polyaniline, and polyacetylene was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000 to Alan J. Heeger, Alan G. MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa .

==Synthesis==
Different methods can be used to synthesize PPy, but the most common are electrochemical synthesis and chemical oxidation.

Chemical oxidation of pyrrole:
:n C4H4NH + 2n FeCl3 → (C4H2NH)n + 2n FeCl2 + 2n HCl

The process is thought to occur via the formation of the pi-radical cation C4H4NH+. This electrophile attacks the C-2 carbon of an unoxidized molecule of pyrrole to give a dimeric cation [(C4H4NH)2]++. The process repeats itself many times.

Conductive forms of PPy are prepared by oxidation (&quot;p-doping&quot;) of the polymer:
:(C4H2NH)n + 0.2 X → [(C4H2NH)nX0.2]

The polymerization and p-doping can also be effected electrochemically. The resulting conductive polymer are peeled off of the anode. Cyclic voltammetry and chronocoulometry methods can be used for electrochemical synthesis of polypyrrole.

Most recent micro and nano droplet researches have been conducted in the synthesis of polypyrrole microstructures using various fluid templates formed on different solid surfaces.

==Properties==
Films of PPy are yellow but darken in the air due to some oxidation. Doped films are blue or black depending on the degree of polymerization and film thickness. They are amorphous, showing only weak diffraction. PPy is described as &quot;quasi-unidimensional&quot; vs one-dimensional since there is some crosslinking and chain hopping. Undoped and doped films are insoluble in solvents but swellable. Doping makes the materials brittle. They are stable in the air up to 150 °C at which temperature the dopant starts to evolve (e.g., as HCl).

Doping the polymer requires that the material swell to accommodate the charge-compensating anions. The physical changes associated with this charging and discharging have been discussed as a form of artificial muscle. The surface of polypyrrole films present fractal properties and ionic diffusion through them show anomalous diffusion pattern.

==Applications==
PPy and related conductive polymers have two main application in electronic devices and for chemical sensors and electrochemical applications.

==Research trends==
PPy is a potential vehicle for drug delivery. The polymer matrix serves as a container for proteins.

Polypyrrole has been investigated as a catalyst support for fuel cells and to sensitize cathode electrocatalysts.

Together with other conjugated polymers such as polyaniline, poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) etc., polypyrrole has been studied as a material for &quot;artificial muscles&quot;, a technology that offers advantages relative to traditional motor actuating elements.

Polypyrrole was used to coat silica and reverse phase silica to yield a material capable of anion exchange and exhibiting hydrophobic interactions.

Polypyrrole was used in the microwave fabrication of multiwalled carbon nanotubes, a rapid method to grow CNT&#x27;s.

A water-resistant polyurethane sponge coated with a thin layer of polypyrrole absorbs 20 times its weight in oil and is reusable.

The wet-spun polypyrrole fibre can be prepared chemical polymerization pyrrole and DEHS as dopant.

<text>Polyaniline (PANI) is a conducting polymer and organic semiconductor of the semi-flexible rod polymer family. The compound has been of interest since the 1980s because of its electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. Polyaniline is one of the most studied conducting polymers.

==Historical development==
Polyaniline was discovered in the 19th century by F. Ferdinand Runge (1794–1867), Carl Fritzsche (1808–1871), John Lightfoot (1831–1872), and Henry
Letheby (1816–1876). Lightfoot studied the oxidation of aniline, which had been isolated only 20 years previously. He developed the first commercially successful route to the dye called Aniline black. The first definitive report of polyaniline did not occur until 1862, which included an electrochemical method for the determination of small quantities of aniline.

From the early 20th century on, occasional reports about the structure of PANI were published.
Polymerized from the inexpensive aniline, polyaniline can be found in one of three idealized oxidation states:
* leucoemeraldine – white/clear &amp; colorless (C6H4NH)n
* emeraldine – green for the emeraldine salt, blue for the emeraldine base ([C6H4NH]2[C6H4N]2)n
* (per)nigraniline – blue/violet (C6H4N)n

In the figure, &quot;x&quot; equals half the degree of polymerization (DP). Leucoemeraldine with n = 1, m = 0 is the fully reduced state. Pernigraniline is the fully oxidized state (n = 0, m = 1) with imine links instead of amine links. Studies have shown that most forms of polyaniline are one of the three states or physical mixtures of these components. The emeraldine (n = m = 0.5) form of polyaniline, often referred to as emeraldine base (EB), is neutral, if doped (protonated) it is called emeraldine salt (ES), with the imine nitrogens protonated by an acid. Protonation helps to delocalize the otherwise trapped diiminoquinone-diaminobenzene state. Emeraldine base is regarded as the most useful form of polyaniline due to its high stability at room temperature and the fact that, upon doping with acid, the resulting emeraldine salt form of polyaniline is highly electrically conducting. Leucoemeraldine and pernigraniline are poor conductors, even when doped with an acid.

The colour change associated with polyaniline in different oxidation states can be used in sensors and electrochromic devices. Polyaniline sensors typically exploit changes in electrical conductivity between the different oxidation states or doping levels. Treatment of emeraldine with acids increases the electrical conductivity by up to ten orders of magnitude. Undoped polyaniline has a conductivity of S/m, whereas conductivities of S/m can be achieved by doping to 4% HBr. The same material can be prepared by oxidation of leucoemeraldine.

===Synthesis===
Although the synthetic methods to produce polyaniline are quite simple, the mechanism of polymerization is probably complex. The formation of leucoemeraldine can be described as follows, where [O] is a generic oxidant:

:n C6H5NH2 + [O] → [C6H4NH]n + H2O

A common oxidant is ammonium persulfate in 1 M hydrochloric acid (other acids can be used). The polymer precipitates as an unstable dispersion with micrometer-scale particulates.

(Per)nigraniline is prepared by oxidation of the emeraldine base with a peracid:
:{[C6H4NH]2[C6H4N]2}n + RCO3H → [C6H4N]n + H2O + RCO2H
Aniline can also be electrochemically polymerised directly onto conductive surfaces without the use of a chemical oxidant.

===Processing===
The synthesis of polyaniline nanostructures is facile.

Using surfactant dopants, the polyaniline can be made dispersible and hence useful for practical applications. Bulk synthesis of polyaniline nanofibers has been researched extensively.

A multi-stage model for the formation of emeraldine base is proposed. In the first stage of the reaction the pernigraniline PS salt oxidation state is formed. In the second stage pernigraniline is reduced to the emeraldine salt as aniline monomer gets oxidized to the radical cation. In the third stage this radical cation couples with ES salt. This process can be followed by light scattering analysis which allows the determination of the absolute molar mass. According to one study in the first step a DP of 265 is reached with the DP of the final polymer at 319. Approximately 19% of the final polymer is made up of the aniline radical cation which is formed during the reaction.

Polyaniline is typically produced in the form of long-chain polymer aggregates, surfactant (or dopant) stabilized nanoparticle dispersions, or stabilizer-free nanofiber dispersions depending on the supplier and synthetic route. Surfactant or dopant stabilized polyaniline dispersions have been available for commercial sale since the late 1990s.

==Potential applications==
The major applications are printed circuit board manufacturing: final finishes, used in millions of m2 every year, antistatic and ESD coatings, and corrosion protection. Polyaniline and its derivatives are also used as the precursor for the production of N-doped carbon materials through high-temperature heat treatment. Printed emeraldine polyaniline-based sensors have also gained much attention for widespread applications where devices are typically fabricated via screen, inkjet or aerosol jet printing.

<doc id="733243" wikidata="Q5036840" url="?curid=733243" title="Captain Ultra">
<text>Captain Ultra (Griffin Gogol) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Roy Thomas, George Pérez, and Joe Sinnott, the character first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #177 (December 1976). Captain Ultra has been a member of the Revengers at various points in his history.

==Development==

=== Concept and creation ===
Roy Thomas asserted, &quot;Captain Ultra was a parody character that George Perez and I made up for FF #177, in our own spoof of DC&#x27;s auditions for the Legion of Super-Heroes (it had that quasi-legion of rejected heroes, remember?). We deliberately gave him what I&#x27;ve always called a &quot;church-window&quot; costume... one that has a zillion design pieces, and nearly as many colors, with nothing to really focus the eye. But of course, since he was a virtual Superman, we had to give him a &quot;Kryptonite,&quot; so we made it fire, as a sort of homage to the Martian Manhunter. The joke was that the Frightful Four, if they had let him join, would have been going up against the Fantastic Four--with its Human Torch--aided by a man who passed out in the presence of any kind of flame.&quot;

=== Publication history ===

Captain Ultra debuted in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #177 (December 1976), and was created by Roy Thomas, George Pérez, and Joe Sinnott.

==Fictional character biography==
Griffin Gogol was a plumber who underwent psychological treatment and hypnosis to cure his smoking habits. Unbeknownst to him, his psychologist is an alien, and the hypnosis unlocks his innate superhuman abilities. Donning a clashing, colorful costume, Gogol became the superhero Captain Ultra. However, it is revealed he suffers from severe pyrophobia (fear of fire) as a side-effect.

Captain Ultra subsequently applies to join the Frightful Four. They eagerly accept him, but later reject him after he faints in the presence of a match. He also works with the Defenders in New York, but never considers joining them.

Soon after, he moves to Chicago. He has since had a minor career as a solo superhero, often teaming up with heroes like Thor to battle minor villains.

Ultra later overcomes his pyrophobia after undergoing therapy with Doc Samson and becomesma comedian. His comedy career takes him across the country. Superheroics interfere with this, such as when the underground dirt creature Mud Pi kidnaps the citizens of Wash Basin, Texas. Captain Ultra manages to rescue them all.

Doorman begged him to join the Great Lakes Avengers, but Captain Ultra angrily rejects him.

Griffin then became the leader for the Nebraska team of the Initiative program, part of a government controlled superhero program. After two of his teammates, Paragon and Gadget are killed, Griffin briefly fights Iron Man to protect the rest of his group. He is seen investigating the circumstances of Paragon and Gadget&#x27;s tragic deaths with Samson and Iron Man. During the course of their investigation it is revealed that there are two new Initiative recruits in the process of being fast-tracked to the Nebraska team, although Captain Ultra expressed irritation at the prospect of having to &quot;babysit the punks&quot;.

Captain Ultra is recruited by Wonder Man to join his Revengers. During the Revengers&#x27; attack on Avengers Mansion, he is scared off when Doctor Strange uses an illusion spell to make him believe he is on fire. He and the rest of the Revengers were defeated by all three Avengers teams and were remanded to the Raft. Captain Ultra&#x27;s reason for joining the Revengers is that despite the fact that he was on the Initiative, he resents being disrespected despite having as much power as an Avenger.

In &quot;&quot;, Captain Ultra appears as an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.

==Powers and abilities==
Captain Ultra acquired a range of superpowers through hypnosis by an alien. He possesses superhuman attributes, such as superhuman strength, speed, durability, and stamina. He also gained the psionic ability to become intangible at will, see through substances (X-ray vision), and the ability to project his breath forward with great concussive force — among others. Captain Ultra has the power of flight.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
Daniel Jurlan of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; ranked Captain Ultra 4th in their &quot;15 Obscure Marvel Characters Who Deserve Their Own Movie&quot; list.

==In other media==
* Captain Ultra appears in the &quot;Fantastic Four: World&#x27;s Greatest Heroes&quot; episode &quot;The Cure&quot;, voiced by Paul Dobson. This version is a failed applicant to the Fantastic Four.
* Captain Ultra appears in the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; episode &quot;Damage Control&quot;, voiced by Cam Clarke. This version is a spokesperson for Damage Control.

<doc id="733248" wikidata="Q5283563" url="?curid=733248" title="Districts of the Northwest Territories">
<text>The vastness of Canada&#x27;s Northwest Territories (spelled &#x27;North-West Territories&#x27; from 1870 to 1906) meant that for much of its history it was divided into several districts for ease of administration. The number and size of these territorial districts varied as other provinces and territories of Canada were created and expanded. The districts of the Northwest Territories were abolished in 1999 with the creation of the Nunavut territory and the contraction of the Northwest Territories to its current size.

==North-West Territories before districts==
The North-West Territories were administered as a single entity, with no districts, from 1870 to 1882.

In 1870, Canada gained control of Rupert&#x27;s Land and the North-Western Territory from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. That same year, a small piece of Rupert&#x27;s Land was formed into the province of Manitoba, but the rest of the area was merged and renamed the North-West Territories. This region included the vast bulk of Canada&#x27;s present day landmass and covered an area about the size of western Europe.

In 1876, the North-West Territories contracted in size when a large area of , between Manitoba and Ontario and along the entire west coast of Hudson Bay, was established by Canada as a territory named the District of Keewatin. This autonomous territory is not to be confused with the &#x27;districts&#x27; which would later be created &quot;within&quot; the North-West Territories.

In 1880, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago was ceded to Canada by the United Kingdom and this land was added to the North-West Territories.

==Timeline==
===1882===

As the southern part of the North-West Territories became populated, four districts were created in 1882 for ease of administration; unlike Keewatin, these areas remained a part of the North-West Territories, and thus were formally called &quot;provisional districts&quot;:
*The District of Alberta was where the southwestern part of the province of Alberta is today, east of British Columbia, west of the line between ranges 10 and 11 of the Dominion Land Survey (about 112° west) and north of the Canada–US border.
*The District of Athabasca covered the northern half of what is today Alberta.
*The District of Assiniboia was where the southernmost quarter of Saskatchewan is today (south of the Ninth Correction Line, about 51.97° north), but also stretched further west into what is today Alberta.
*The District of Saskatchewan was to the north of Assiniboia extending halfway up modern Saskatchewan (18th Correction Line, about 55.11° north). It stretched further east than Assiniboia, running all the way to the shore of Lake Winnipeg and the Nelson River. It also stretched west into what is now Alberta.

===1886===
The southwestern border of the autonomous District of Keewatin was adjusted to conform to the boundaries of the District of Saskatchewan.

===1895===

In 1895, the northern portion of the North-West Territories was divided into four more internal districts for ease of administration:
*The District of Franklin was made up of the Arctic islands.
*The District of Ungava was made up of what is today northern Quebec, parts of Labrador, and offshore islands (in Hudson, James and Ungava Bays) that are today part of Nunavut.
*The District of Yukon was made up of what is today the Yukon.
*The District of Mackenzie was the rest, stretching from the Yukon border in the west to the Keewatin border in the east, and containing none of the islands.
*The District of Athabasca expanded and covered the northern half of what is today both Alberta and Saskatchewan.
*The portion of the North-West Territories north of Ontario was ceded to the autonomous District of Keewatin.

===1897===
Southampton Island, Coats Island, Akimiski Island, and other islands were ceded to the autonomous District of Keewatin, whereas Boothia Peninsula and Melville Peninsula, which were previously part of the autonomous District of Keewatin, were added to the District of Franklin.

===1898===
The North-West Territories shrunk in 1898 when the Klondike Gold Rush necessitated the conversion of the District of Yukon into the autonomous Yukon Territory. Also, the southernmost part of Ungava was ceded to Quebec.

===1901===
The eastern border of Yukon Territory was slightly adjusted, thus exchanging some area with the North-West Territories.

===1905-06===
The North-West Territories experienced significant adjustments between 1905 and 1906:

*The Districts of Alberta, Assiniboia, Athabasca, and Saskatchewan were reorganized to form the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan (1905).
*The autonomous District of Keewatin, portions of which had been converted into the expansion of Manitoba and Ontario, gave up its autonomy and became a district within the North-West Territories (1905).
*The easternmost portions of the (now) defunct Districts of Saskatchewan and Athabaska were added to the District of Keewatin (1905).
*The Northwest Territories now consisted of the Districts of Franklin, Ungava, Mackenzie and Keewatin.
*The hyphen was removed from North-West Territories, so that the area was now named the Northwest Territories (1906).

===1912===
The Northwest Territories experienced further attrition in 1912:
*The entire continental portion of the District of Ungava was converted into the northern expansion of the province of Quebec. Only the district&#x27;s more than 1500 almost entirely uninhabited offshore islands remained part of the Northwest Territories; they were made a part of the Franklin District in 1920.
*Most of the District of Keewatin (i.e., everything south of 60 degrees north) was converted into the northern expansion of the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba. In 1920, the easternmost portion of the District of Mackenzie was added to the District of Keewatin.

The Northwest Territories now consisted of the Districts of Franklin, Mackenzie and Keewatin. Ungava remained a district until 1920, but with no population to administer, this district designation was effectively unused after 1912.

The three remaining districts continued to be used for a number of decades, but as control over the territory was moved from departments of the federal government to a centralized government in Yellowknife starting in 1967, they began to have far less use. Although the Districts of Franklin, Mackenzie and Keewatin continued to appear on many maps (and continued to exist), by the 1980s the practical governance of the Northwest Territories was divided into four administrative regions: Inuvik, Fort Smith, Keewatin and Baffin. A fifth region, the Central Arctic Region, subsequently called the Kitikmeot, was later carved out of the Fort Smith Region.

===1999===
In 1999, the Northwest Territories was reduced to its current size - and the notion of the &#x27;districts&#x27; was abolished - with the creation of the territory of Nunavut. The former District of Keewatin, most of the Arctic Islands of the District of Franklin, and a northeast portion of the District of Mackenzie now form Nunavut, with the remainder of Franklin and the majority of Mackenzie forming the current version of the Northwest Territories.

<doc id="733250" wikidata="Q936654" url="?curid=733250" title="Oscar Temaru">
<text>Oscar Manutahi Temaru (born November 1, 1944) is a Tahitian politician. He has been President of French Polynesia (&quot;président de la Polynésie française&quot;), an overseas collectivity of France, on five occasions: in 2004, from 2005 to 2006, from 2007 to 2008, in 2009, and from 2011 to 2013 and mayor of Faa&#x27;a since 1983.

==Career==
He first served as the President of French Polynesia (&quot;président de la Polynésie française&quot;) from June 15, 2004 until his Government lost a no-confidence motion on October 8, 2004. He was the caretaker President for two weeks after that, but was forced to give up the presidency until March 2005, when he was reelected after parliamentary by-elections.

He is leader of the five party coalition Union For Democracy, which includes his pro-independence party Tavini Huiraatira (People&#x27;s Servant Party) and other smaller parties that support autonomy for French Polynesia rather than independence. Those parties unexpectedly defeated supporters of long-time leader Gaston Flosse in the May 2004 parliamentary elections.

On October 8, 2004, his government was censured and ousted by the Parliament, the Assembly of French Polynesia (&quot;Assemblée de la Polynésie française&quot;) by a vote of 29 to 28. There were calls for the French Government to step in and hold new elections, and allegations by the French Socialist Party that his Government was subject to acts of &quot;methodical destabilisation&quot; on the part of the French government. Gaston Flosse was re-elected President by the Assembly in a simple majority vote on October 22. The President of the Assembly, Antony Géros, cast doubt on the legitimacy of this election saying the vote for President (&quot;président de la Polynésie française&quot;) should occur on October 25 (see French Polynesia political crisis 2004). As a compromise, by-elections were set for February 13, 2005 for certain seats, which Temaru&#x27;s coalition won. He was re-elected president (&quot;président de la Polynésie française&quot;) on March 3, 2005.

Temaru lost a vote of no confidence on 13 December 2006, after months of protests against the high cost of living in French Polynesia. Temaru had lost control of parliament due to defections. Gaston Tong Sang won the presidential election on December 26.

Temaru ran for parliament in the 2007 elections, but failed to win a seat.

On September 14, 2007, Temaru was elected as President of French Polynesia for the third time in three years (with 27 of 44 votes). He replaced Tong Sang, who lost a no-confidence vote on August 31.

On 12 February 2009, he was elected president yet again. He fell in a vote of no confidence on 25 November 2009, and was again replaced by Tong Sang.

He became President again on 1 April 2011.

It was under Temaru&#x27;s presidency that French Polynesia became, in November 2011, a founding member of the Polynesian Leaders Group, a regional grouping intended to cooperate on a variety of issues including culture and language, education, responses to climate change, and trade and investment.

He was twice elected as the President of the Assembly of French Polynesia from February 2008 to February 2009, and from April 2010 to April 2011.

He was re-elected to the Assembly in the 2023 election.

==Background==
Temaru was born at Faa&#x27;a on the island of Tahiti. He was educated in Faa&#x27;a and Papeete, where he received a thorough religious education. He was born to a Tahitian father and a Cook Island Māori mother, and has stated that he has Chinese ancestry.

An early political influence was Jean-Marie Tjibaou, philosopher and former leader of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS), who was assassinated in New Caledonia in 1989.

Temaru entered the French Navy for three years in 1961 and participated in the Algerian War of Independence. On his return to French Polynesia, he sat the exam to become a customs officer in Tahiti. In 1983, he retired from this position.

Temaru has been a vocal campaigner against nuclear testing by France at Moruroa and Fangataufa Atolls since the 1970s. His main power base has been in the poor suburb of Faa&#x27;a on the outskirts of the capital Papeete.

In 1977, Oscar Temaru formed his political party, the Front for the Liberation of Polynesia (FLP). The party changed its name in 1983 to Tavini Huiraatira (People&#x27;s Servant Party). The same year he was elected mayor of Faa&#x27;a, which position he continues to hold (as of 2024).

In 1986, Tavini Huiraatira obtained two seats in the territorial assembly, four seats in 1991, eleven in 1996, and thirteen in 2001. In 2004 the Union for Democracy Coalition won 27 of the 57 seats.

Temaru&#x27;s coalition government program in 2004 included the gradual increase of the minimum wage to 150.000 Fcfp, work days that don’t start before 9am, an improvement of social services, political decentralisation, educational reform, and a revision of the new autonomy statute after French Polynesia was declared a French Overseas Country (&quot;pays d&#x27;outre-mer&quot;) in March 2004.

He pledged there would be no immediate moves to independence.

When asked by an Australian Broadcasting Corporation reporter &quot;Most people call this place French Polynesia. What do you call it?&quot; he replied &quot;This is French-occupied Polynesia. That is the truth. This country has been occupied.&quot;

==Racist comments controversy==
In 2007, Temaru was found guilty of &quot;racial discrimination&quot; by the criminal court of Papeete for having referred to the European people living in French Polynesia as &quot;trash&quot;, &quot;waste&quot;. Temaru has appealed his conviction for racial discrimination.

==Conflict of interest conviction==
In September 2019, Oscar Temaru was convicted of &#x27;unlawful taking of interests&#x27; (&quot;prise illégale d&#x27;intérêts&quot;) by the criminal court of Papeete for exercising undue influence as mayor of Faaa. The court found that under Temaru&#x27;s watch, the municipality of Faaa had funded to the tune of 150 million Pacific francs (US$1.4 million) a pro-independence community station, Radio Tefana, which relayed the propaganda of Temaru&#x27;s political party. Oscar Temaru was given a suspended six-month prison sentence and fined 5 million Pacific francs (US$46,500). In May 2023 the conviction was thrown out on appeal, after the court found that the government had not provided any evidence that the broadcasts were propaganda.

==2007-2008 Presidential Cabinet==
Oscar Temaru announced his new presidential cabinet on September 19, 2007, shortly after his election as President of French Polynesia. The sixteen cabinet members include three women.

<text>Gaston Flosse (born 24 June 1931) is a French Polynesian politician who has been President of French Polynesia on five separate occasions. He is currently a member of the Senate of France and has been a French junior minister under Jacques Chirac. He received sentences for corruption, which are under appeal.

==Life and career==
Flosse was born in Rikitea, Mangareva, French Polynesia. He is of both French and Polynesian descent.

Flosse supports the current autonomy arrangement between French Polynesia and France and has led the conservative pro-autonomy and anti-independence party Tahoera&#x27;a Huiraatira (People&#x27;s Rally for the Republic Party) for more than 20 years. He was the vice-president of the government council from 1982 to 1984, when more autonomy was gained and he became President of the Governing Council. He held that position from 1984 to 1987 and from 1991 to 2004.

On 27 February 2004 French Polynesian autonomy was again increased, and Flosse became President of French Polynesia (&quot;Le président de la Polynésie française&quot;). Shortly after, though, his party lost the parliamentary elections, and on June 15, he left office when the parliament, the Assembly of French Polynesia (&quot;Assemblée de la Polynésie française&quot;), elected the pro-independence leader, Oscar Temaru, to the post.

On 22 October 2004 he was re-elected to the presidency, and he took office that day, although doubt was cast on the legitimacy of this election by Antony Géros, the President of the French Polynesia Assembly (see French Polynesia political crisis 2004). On 13 February 2005 Flosse&#x27;s party lost the parliamentary by-elections, which had been called as a compromise after pressure from Temaru&#x27;s supporters. On 15 February 2005 Flosse lost the presidency again in a parliamentary confidence vote, and on 3 March 2005 Temaru took over.

Apart from having been president of the territory, he has also been both tourism minister and housing minister. He is the mayor of Pirea municipality north of Papeete and has represented the territory in the National Assembly of France. He was first elected to the Senate of France on 1 October 1998.

Flosse was able to govern French Polynesia with the support of centrist parties and groupings. He and former French President Jacques Chirac had a close personal association, Chirac being a godfather to Flosse&#x27;s youngest son. This relationship gave the Tahitian special access to the highest levels of power in France, which he utilised in negotiating aid packages and financial support for the territory.

On 21 June 2006 Flosse was convicted of corruption and given a three-month suspended sentence. The court found that he had abused his political office in connection with a hotel purchase. He continued to be a member of the territorial assembly and French Senate.

Flosse&#x27;s party came third in the February 2008 legislative assembly elections, but with the support of Oscar Temaru and his UPLD (Union for Democracy) party, which came second, Flosse became President of French Polynesia again on 23 February 2008. He was replaced by Gaston Tong Sang after losing a vote of confidence on 15 April 2008, however.

Flosse was re-elected to the French Senate in the September 2008 Senate election.

In January 2022 Flosse declared his support for independence for French Polynesia, saying that autonomy within France had worked as long as Jacques Chirac was French president and had since been eroded.

In July 2024 he stepped down as president of the ʻĀmuitahiraʻa o te Nūnaʻa Māʻohi party.

<doc id="733258" wikidata="Q3546921" url="?curid=733258" title="Cerise (comics)">
<text>Cerise is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, in particular those featuring Excalibur and other books of the X-Men franchise. Created by Alan Davis, the character first appeared in &quot;Excalibur&quot; #47 (March 1992).

== Publication history ==
Cerise first appeared in &quot;Excalibur&quot; #47 (March 1992), created by Alan Davis. Visually the character was a reuse of a design for a proposed series called &quot;Warpforce&quot;, pitched to DC Comics by Davis and Paul Neary. When DC passed on the series Davis decided to refine the design and include it in &quot;Excalibur&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
Cerise is an extraterrestrial from the planet Shaskofrugnon in the Shi&#x27;ar Empire. As she has revealed in her first appearance, she is the gene stock of Subruki, Zarstock, and Kuli Ka. She was accidentally transported to Earth after deserting the empire&#x27;s brutal army, the Ghrand Jhar, refusing to fire upon innocents and as a result causing the death of her crew. She became a member of Excalibur upon encountering them, and later became romantically involved with Nightcrawler.

Alongside Excalibur, she battled the Anti-Phoenix&#x27;s rock creatures. She also fought Necrom alongside Excalibur. She later encountered the Crazy Gang. Alongside Excalibur, she was attacked by Jamie Braddock and Sat-Yr-9, but the team managed to overpower their attackers. She next aided Excalibur and the X-Men against Troll Associates. Cerise and Nightcrawler then encountered the Knight Errant. She was then attacked by the Sentinels and captured by Nigel Orpington-Smythe. She then met Khaos, and alongside Khaos and Excalibur she battled his foe Ghath on their planet Irth, and invited Khaos to join Excalibur.

During the &quot;Warpies Saga&quot;, wherein superhuman children were being manipulated, Cerise was baffled with the concept of &quot;children&quot;. Shadowcat tried to explain to her how infants are born and grow up to become adults. Cerise reveals that she &quot;emerged from the source&quot; as she is.

Eventually, Cerise was taken into custody by the Starjammers for her crimes against the Shi&#x27;ar Empire. She was sent to the pan-dimensional prison Krag, where she was revealed to have destroyed the Shi&#x27;ar recruitment vehicle (Ghrand Jhar) to prevent it from carrying out further acts of genocide. She was forced to kill the second Fang in personal combat. The Shi&#x27;ar empress Lilandra pardoned Cerise for her crimes, given their circumstances, and allowed her to serve out her prison sentence as a personal aide. Cerise&#x27;s role in the Shi&#x27;ar Empire is to investigate reports of brutality and violence among Shi&#x27;ar officials.

During 2000&#x27;s &quot;Maximum Security&quot; crossover, Nightcrawler professed at one point that he still loves her, but at the time he was planning to become a Catholic priest, and thus could not rekindle their relationship.

Cerise appeared in the 2006 storyline &quot;Annihilation&quot; as a member of the Graces, a group of female warriors, led by Gamora.

==Powers and abilities==
Cerise is a member of the alien Shi&#x27;ar race, making her physical abilities somewhat more powerful than an Earth human.

She also has the ability to generate and psionically manipulate energy fields of coherent red spectrum light force. She can project the light as simple brightness, or as concussive blasts, or use it to form &quot;solid&quot; objects such as swords, force fields, shields, funnels, and more. She was even able to make a light armor covering Nightcrawler as he trained with Captain Britain. Cerise can create a bubble of coherent light around herself which she can levitate through the air. She once even used this energy to fly a whole broken Sentinel holding her friends within, across the Atlantic Ocean as a means of disguise. She can also fly naturally (without use of her energy fields), and hold her breath for six or seven minutes.

Cerise wears gloves that contain broad-band sensor arrays which allow her to search for specific life-forms, energy, and temporal/dimensional abnormalities in a surrounding area. She also wore a &quot;transit suit&quot; permitting travel through hyperspace. Her equipment was designed by Shi&#x27;ar scientists and craftsmen.

Cerise is a superb warrior, having received intensive combat training in the Shi&#x27;ar military, and is a trained starship navigator.

<doc id="733259" wikidata="Q146218" url="?curid=733259" title="Polyphenylene sulfide">
<text>Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) is an organic polymer consisting of aromatic rings linked by sulfides. Synthetic fiber and textiles derived from this polymer resist chemical and thermal attack. PPS is used in filter fabric for coal boilers, papermaking felts, electrical insulation, film capacitors, specialty membranes, gaskets, and packings. PPS is the precursor to a conductive polymer of the semi-flexible rod polymer family. The PPS, which is otherwise insulating, can be converted to the semiconducting form by oxidation or use of dopants.

Polyphenylene sulfide is an engineering plastic, commonly used today as a high-performance thermoplastic. PPS can be molded, extruded, or machined to tight tolerances. In its pure solid form, it may be opaque white to light tan in color. Maximum service temperature is . PPS has not been found to dissolve in any solvent at temperatures below approximately .

An easy way to identify the compound is by the metallic sound it makes when struck.

==Manufacturers and trade names==
PPS is marketed by different brand names by different manufacturers. The major industry players are China Lumena New Materials, Solvay, Kureha, HDC Polyall, Celanese, DIC Corporation, Toray Industries, Zhejiang NHU Special Materials, SABIC, and Tosoh. Other manufacturers include Chengdu Letian Plastics, Lion Idemitsu Composites, and Initz (a joint venture of SK Chemicals and Teijin).

The following are examples of brand names by manufacturer and PPS type:

* Tedur, Albis Plastic, linear type
* DIC.PPS, DIC Corporation, linear and cross-linked
* DURAFIDE, Polyplastics Co. Ltd, linear type
* ECOTRAN, HDC Polyall, distributed and compounded via A. Schulman
* Fortron, Ticona, linear type
* Petcoal, Tōsō
* Therma-Tech TT9200-5001, PolyOne Corporation
* Ryton, Solvay Specialty Polymers, linear and cross-linked
* Torelina Toray
* NHU-PPS, Zhejiang NHU Company Ltd., linear type and cross-linked

==Characteristics==
PPS is one of the most important high temperature thermoplastic polymers because it exhibits a number of desirable properties. These properties include resistance to heat, acids, alkalies, mildew, bleaches, aging, sunlight, and abrasion. It absorbs only small amounts of solvents and resists dyeing.

==Production==
The Federal Trade Commission definition for sulfur fiber is &quot;A manufactured fiber in which the fiber-forming substance is a long chain synthetic polysulfide in which at least 85% of the sulfide (–S–) linkages are attached directly to two (2) aromatic rings.&quot; The generic name for this synthetic fiber is Sulfar.

The PPS (polyphenylene sulfide) polymer is formed by reaction of sodium sulfide with 1,4-dichlorobenzene:


The process for commercially producing this material was initially developed by Dr. H. Wayne Hill Jr. and James T. Edmonds at Phillips Petroleum. N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) is used as the reaction solvent because it is stable at the high temperatures required for the synthesis and it dissolves both the sulfiding agent and the oligomeric intermediates.

Linear, high-molecular-weight PPS that is capable of being extruded into film or melt spun into fiber was invented by Robert W. Campbell.

The first U.S. commercial sulfur fiber was produced in 1983 by Phillips Fibers Corporation, a subsidiary of Phillips 66.

<text>Ahom or Tai-Ahom (Ahom:𑜁𑜪𑜨 𑜄𑜩 𑜒𑜑𑜪𑜨 or 𑜁𑜨𑜉𑜫 𑜄𑜩 𑜒𑜑𑜪𑜨; ) is a dormant, Southwestern Tai language formerly spoken by the Ahom people. It&#x27;s currently undergoing a revival and mainly used in religious and educational purposes. Ahom language was the state language of Ahom kingdom. It was relatively free of both Mon-Khmer and Indo-Aryan influences and has a written tradition dating back to the 13th century.

The Ahom people established the Ahom kingdom and ruled parts of the Brahmaputra river valley in the present day Indian state of Assam between the 13th and the 18th centuries. The language was the court language of the kingdom, until it began to be replaced by the Assamese language in the 17th century. Since the early 18th century, there have been no native speakers of the language, though extensive manuscripts in the language still exist today. The tonal system of the language is entirely lost. The language was only partially known by a small group of traditional priests of the Ahom religion, and it was being used only for ceremonial or ritualistic purposes.

There has been efforts to revive the language in recent times. A reconstructed version is taught in various educational institutions in Assam by AHSEC and Dibrugarh University.

==Classification==
Tai-Ahom is classified in a Northwestern subgrouping of Southwestern Tai owing to close affinities with Shan, Khamti and, more distantly, Thai. The immediate parent language from which Ahom is descended has been reconstructed as Proto-Tai, a language from 2000 years ago, in the Kra–Dai family (unrelated to Chinese, but possibly related to the Austronesian languages), within the (proposed but debated) subgroup of Kam–Tai, although some say that Tai languages are a discrete family, and are not part of Kra–Dai. Ahom is distinct from but closely related to Aiton, which is still spoken in Assam to this day.

== Description ==
Ahom has characteristics typical of Tai languages, such as:

* Subject Verb Object (SVO) word order 
* Tonality 
* Monosyllabic roots 
* Each syllable is tonal, and begins with a consonant or consonant cluster. A vowel or diphthong follows. A final consonant may be added, but is not necessary.
* Lack of inflection 
* Analytic syntax 
When speaking and writing Ahom, much is dependent upon context and the audience interpretation. Multiple parts of the sentence can be left out; verb and adjectives will remain, but other parts of speech, especially pronouns, can be dropped. Verbs do not have tenses, and nouns do not have plurals. Time periods can be identified by adverbs, strings of verbs, or auxiliaries placed before the verb.
Ahom, like other Tai languages, uses classifiers to identify categories, and repetitions of words to express idiomatic expressions. However, the expressions, classifiers, pronouns, and other sentence particles vary between the Tai languages descended from Proto-Tai, making Tai languages mutually unintelligible.

It has its own script, the Ahom script.

== History ==

The Ahom people and their language originated in Yunnan in south-west China. They migrated from the border between northern Vietnam and the Guangxi province of China, to the Hukawng Valley, along the upper reaches of the Chindwin river, northern Burma. In the 13th century, they crossed the Patkai Range. and settled in the Brahmaputra River valley, in Northeast India. After increasing their power in Upper Assam, the Ahom people extended their power to the south of the river Brahmaputra and east of the river Dikho, which corresponds to the modern day districts of Dibrugarh and Sibsagar, Assam, where the Ahom still reside today. Tai-Ahom was the exclusive court language of the Ahom kingdom, where it was used to write state-histories or &#x27;Buranjis&#x27;.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the small Ahom community expanded their rule dramatically toward the west and they successfully saw off challenges from the Mughal Empire and other invaders. The rapid expansion resulted in the Ahom people becoming a small minority in their own kingdom, of which they kept control. During the 17th century, the Assamese language entered the Ahom court and co-existed with the Tai-Ahom for some time before finally replacing it. Eventually the Ahom peasants too adopted the Assamese language over the Ahom language for secular purposes, while Ahom was restricted to religious use by Ahom priests. The everyday usage of Ahom language ceased completely by the early 19th century. Although the language is no longer spoken, the exhaustive 1795 Ahom-Assamese lexicon known as the &quot;Bar Amra&quot; preserves the lexical forms of the language towards the end of the Ahom Kingdom.

The language today is used chiefly for liturgical purposes, and is no longer used in daily life. While the written language (and ritualistic chants) survive in a vast number of written manuscripts, Ahom is therefore usually regarded as a dead language. It retains cultural significance and is used for religious chants and to read literature. This is complicated however by the fact that the phonology with its tone system has been completely lost, because the Ahom script does not mark tone and under-specifies vowel contrasts, which obscures the meaning of words as tones are important to distinguish the meaning of words in tonal languages.

=== Translation efforts ===

Fabricated samples of the Ahom script delayed translation of legitimate Ahom texts. Several publications were created based on the fabricated samples, leading to incorrect grammatical analysis and dictionary resources that acted as a barrier to future researchers. A later translation of &quot;Ahom Buranji&quot;, a major Ahom script was provided by Golap Chandra Barua, the same man responsible for fabricating samples of translated Ahom script. It was discovered years later, by Professor Prasert na Nagara, that the translation was unreliable. Despite these difficulties, along with the lack of native speakers and specific text, studies in Ahom have prevailed, and certain available scripts have been translated and transliterated, using known words, characters and context.

=== Revitalization efforts ===
In 1954, at a meeting of Ahom people at Patsaku, Sibsagar District, the Tai Historical and Cultural Society of Assam was founded. Since the late 1960s, Ahom culture and traditions have witnessed a revival. In 1981 the Eastern Tai Literary Organization has been founded in Dhemaji, which produced language text books and publications in the Ahom script. Schools in Dibrugarh and Sibsagar districts started offering Tai language classes, teaching a mix of Tai Ahom, Phakey, Khamti and Central Thai. The scholar Terwiel notes that the view of the Ahom language being a dead language is hotly contested by Ahom priests and spokesmen of the revival movement. According to them, the language did not die out because Ahom priests still use the language for religious purposes. Some even claim that the priestly class speaks Ahom as their mother tongue. Upon further investigation, it was determined that the priests could decipher the Ahom script and read the words aloud. However, because they did not know any tones, they did not have any idea of the meaning of the words except for the simplest expressions.

According to Terwiel, there are great differences between the old Ahom language of the manuscripts, which is easily recognizable as a Tai language, and what the revivalists call Ahom, which does not follow the rules of Tai grammar. It has also changed greatly regarding semantics, literally translating Assamese into Tai words, which leads to sentences which do not make sense to any Tai speaker. Terwiel therefore calls this revived language &#x27;pseudo-Ahom&#x27;. Nevertheless, this revived language has been used passionately by revitalists and many neologisms have been created. The demand for translation into Tai-Ahom led to the creation of the first adequate modern dictionary by Nomal Chandra Gogoi in 1987, titled &quot;The Assamese-English-Tai Dictionary&quot;. This dictionary allowed a reader to find the translation of 9,000 Assamese words into English and Tai. This dictionary filled in missing gaps of the Ahom vocabulary with Aiton and Khamti words and if those were not available, Lanna and Thai words were used. The result was a hodgepodge of multiple Tai languages, that was only linked to the Ahom language by the Ahom script in which the dictionary entries were written. The scholar Terwiel recommended in 1992 to base neo-Ahom on the grammar and tones of the very closely related Aiton language, which is still spoken in Assam. Summarizing, the revivalists use a language consisting of a mixture of Tai words from multiple Tai languages, overlaid on an Assamese grammatical base.

In 1999, the scholar Morey reported that Ahom priests have resorted to compounding words to differentiate between words that are homophones in the revived language, since Ahom lost its tone system. For example in old Ahom, the word &quot;su&quot; for tiger and &quot;su&quot; for shirt would have sounded differently by pronouncing them with a different tone. In revived Ahom, they are now differentiated by compounding them with another word: &quot;tu&quot; for animal and &quot;pha&quot; for cloth respectively. Subsequently, &quot;tu su&quot; and &quot;pha su&quot; can be differentiated.

An effort has been made to revive the language by following the phonology of existing sister languages, especially Tai-Aiton and Tai-Phake.

The Institute of Tai Studies and Research (ITSAR), is a Tai-Ahom language teaching institute in Moran, Sivasagar, Assam, India, established in 2001 and affiliated to Dibrugarh University. It offers a one-year Tai-Ahom language diploma course and a three-month certificate course in spoken Tai-Ahom. Other initiatives have been taken, such as workshops and language classes. In 2019, the &#x27;Tai Ahom Yuva Chatra Sanmilan, Assam&#x27; (TAYCSA), demanded that the Tai-Ahom language be included in the school curriculum of the state of Assam. They also demanded the creation of a two-year diploma course in Mahdavdeva University.

An online dictionary containing nearly 5,000 entries (see External links) has been created by analyzing old manuscripts, especially the Bar Amra. A descriptive grammar of Ahom, based on the grammar found in old manuscripts, is being worked on. A sketch has been released, titled “A Sketch of Tai Ahom” by Stephen Morey.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
The Tai Ahom consonants have been reconstructed as the following, by analyzing old texts:

The semi-vowel /w/ is missing from the system, however it is an allophone of /b/ that occurs only in the word final position. Consonants found in the word final position are: /p, t, k, m, n, ŋ, j, b [w]/.

===Vowels===
Vowels can occur in syllable medial and final positions only. The following vowel inventory has been reconstructed:
===Tones===
The language had a tone system, but because the Ahom script did not spell out any tones, the tones are now unknown.

==Grammar==
===Pronouns===
The Ahom language has the following pronouns:
===Demonstratives===
Ahom uses the proximal demonstrative &quot;nai&quot; meaning &#x27;this&#x27; and the distal demonstrative &quot;nan&quot; meaning &#x27;that&#x27;.

===Syntax===
Tai-Ahom mainly used an SVO word order, but an SOV word order has also been attested.

===Nouns===
Classifiers are used when forming plurals, counting entities and when specifically referring to one single entity. Some classifiers are: &#x27;kun&#x27; (used for persons), &#x27;tu&#x27; (used for animals) and &#x27;an&#x27; (general). For example &#x27;khai song tu&#x27; means two buffalo, where &#x27;khai&#x27; means buffalo, &#x27;song&#x27; means two and &#x27;tu&#x27; is the classifier for animals.

===Interrogatives===
The following interrogatives are found:
==Vocabulary==
===Numerals===
Ahom has the following basic numerals:

0 in Ahom script is &quot;𑜰&quot;.

<doc id="733270" wikidata="Q2745635" url="?curid=733270" title="Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium">
<text>Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium was a baseball stadium in Omaha, Nebraska, the former home to the annual NCAA Division I College World Series and the Triple-A Omaha Royals (now Storm Chasers). It was the largest minor league ballpark in the United States until its demolition (Sahlen Field in Buffalo now holds the distinction).

The final College World Series game at Rosenblatt Stadium was played on June 29, 2010. The final game for the Royals in the stadium, and under the Royals name, was played on September 2, with the Royals defeating the Round Rock Express. The Omaha Nighthawks played their 2010 season at Rosenblatt.

Following those events, Rosenblatt was replaced by TD Ameritrade Park Omaha (now Charles Schwab Field Omaha). Rosenblatt Stadium began renovation in late July after being reopened during the 2012 College World Series for fans to visit again. The pressbox girders were imploded on the morning of August 22, 2012. Re-construction of Rosenblatt in playground-esque form began in March 2013, and was officially opened by Mayor Jim Suttle on June 7, 2013. The site is currently owned by the adjacent Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium.

==Professional baseball history==
Omaha Municipal Stadium was built during 1947–1948, and was ready to host the single-A Omaha Cardinals for the 1949 season. The Omaha Cardinals had spent the 1947 and 1948 seasons playing their home games across the Missouri River, at the American Legion Park in Council Bluffs, Iowa. The Cards opened the new Omaha ballpark on April 25, 1949, defeating Des Moines 9-8 in 12 innings.[Lincoln &quot;Nebraska State Journal&quot;, April 26, 1949, p.9]

Over the next few years the ballpark hosted clubs in several different leagues. In 1969, the Kansas City Royals moved their triple-A franchise here, which played at Rosenblatt through the 2010 season.

In 1964, the stadium was renamed to honor former mayor Johnny Rosenblatt (1907–1979), who was instrumental in bringing professional baseball and the College World Series to Omaha.

===Omaha teams===

Team moved into Pacific Coast League (PCL) in 1998, after the AA folded.

Team was named &quot;Omaha Golden Spikes&quot; during 1998–2001.

==Rosenblatt and the College World Series==
From 1950 to 2010 Rosenblatt Stadium was home to the College World Series. After the initial contract between the NCAA and the City of Omaha expired, the parties quickly agreed to renew. Currently, the NCAA and the city of Omaha have agreed to continue hosting the Men&#x27;s College World Series in Omaha through the 2035 season. The South Carolina Gamecocks won the last college World Series in the stadium.

Due to growth in the event, the City of Omaha devoted resources to the stadium to accommodate teams and fans. In 2001, for example, more than $7 million was spent on the stadium. One of the major additions was 10,000 new seats, bringing the total capacity to 23,145.

The record for most consecutive sell-outs at Rosenblatt stands at 82 consecutive games. In 2002, the College World Series surpassed the 5 million spectator mark in all-time attendance.

In 1999, the local event organizers, College World Series of Omaha, Inc., placed the sculpture &quot;Road to Omaha&quot; in front of the main entrance. Created by local artist John Lajba, the sculpture shows three players celebrating by lifting one of their teammates in the air. One of the players whose likeness was used to create the statue (far right) is the current University of Virginia head coach Brian O&#x27;Connor. O&#x27;Connor is a native of Council Bluffs, Iowa and was a CWS participant at Rosenblatt as a pitcher for Creighton in &#x27;91, as an assistant with Notre Dame in &#x27;02, and with Virginia as their head coach in 2009 and 2011.

With the anticipated opening of TD Ameritrade Park Omaha in 2011, the College World Series moved to this new stadium, and the renamed Storm Chasers moved to Werner Park in Sarpy County.

==Rosenblatt and the Omaha Royals==

Although the stadium&#x27;s size was not an issue for the College World Series, expansions over the years made it far too large for a Triple-A team. In its final configuration, it had over 5,000 more seats than the next-largest stadium, Buffalo&#x27;s Sahlen Field. The Royals struggled for years to fill it for regular season games. In the stadium&#x27;s final years, capacity was reduced to 8,500 for Royals games. During the CWS, the Royals were forced to go on an extended road trip for much of June.

There had been discussion since 2003 of building a separate venue for the Royals, which also could have been shared by Creighton University and/or the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Royals president and part owner Alan Stein stated he would be willing to invest $10 million into a new 7,500 seat stadium for the Royals. Although initial plans called for TD Ameritrade Park to be reduced to 12,000 seats for Royals games, Stein said that would not be a viable alternative, presumably because the Royals would have still had to go on an extended road trip in June during the CWS. The Royals believed that a smaller, more intimate stadium would double annual attendance up to 500,000–600,000. According to Stein, that increase would have been unlikely at either Rosenblatt or a large downtown stadium.

The Royals had named multiple other cities with whom they had discussed relocation, but decided to stay in the greater Omaha area with the construction of Werner Park in Sarpy County, Nebraska, which opened in 2011.

==Efforts to save Rosenblatt Stadium==
In May 2007 a grassroots organization called &quot;Save Rosenblatt&quot; tried to save the stadium for the use by College World Series. The group aired a TV commercial with actor Kevin Costner and proposed architectural plans for a renovation of Rosenblatt. The group also created an informational website. The group was composed primarily of governmental spending critics and homeowners near Rosenblatt Stadium who stood to lose money from the loss of proximity of the College World Series.

The members of &quot;Save Rosenblatt&quot; believed that Rosenblatt Stadium should be retained and enhanced, saying that the CWS and the City of Omaha would have been better served by a remodeled Rosenblatt and modified area around the stadium. However, on February 27, 2008, after nearly five months of deliberation, Omaha Mayor Mike Fahey and the stadium committee made a public recommendation for a new downtown stadium. This proposal included plans for the demolition of Rosenblatt Stadium. Many citizens of South Omaha responded with disappointment and frustration over the lack of public participation in the project planning and a lack of a public vote on a multimillion-dollar project. Other concerns focused on the financing and certainty of the construction costs of the new stadium.

In response, fans have begun a movement to build an online museum of Rosenblatt Stadium.

===New agreement===
On April 30, 2009, the city and the NCAA agreed on a memorandum of understanding, outlining a preliminary agreement to keep the World Series in Omaha for another 25 years through 2035. The agreement stipulated that the series be moved to the new downtown stadium by 2011.

===Omaha Nighthawks===
On April 15, 2010, it was announced that Rosenblatt Stadium would be home to the Omaha Nighthawks in the United Football League for its inaugural 2010 season. For 2011 and beyond, the Nighthawks would move into the new TD Ameritrade Park.

The Nighthawks played four games at Rosenblatt Stadium during the 2010 UFL season, selling out all four, the only UFL team to do so. The league was so impressed by the attendance that they awarded the 2010 UFL Championship Game to Rosenblatt, which was the last sporting event ever held there.

===2011–present: Future use and remodeling===
Rosenblatt held tractor pulls and tributes to its legacy through 2011. In June 2012, the Omaha Henry Doorly Zoo Foundation opened Rosenblatt to the public during the 2012 College World Series. Plans called for the site of Rosenblatt Stadium to be sold to pay off the debt remaining from the stadium&#x27;s multimillion-dollar updates. The adjacent Henry Doorly Zoo purchased control of the land and remodeled Rosenblatt once the new downtown stadium was completed. A tribute to Rosenblatt, sized to Little League standards, will be the product of the renovations to Rosenblatt. On March 8, 2011, the Omaha City Council formally approved the sale of Rosenblatt to the Zoo for $12 million. Renovation of Rosenblatt began in July 2012; the city of Omaha will use the money gained from Rosenblatt&#x27;s sale to pay off debts which had been incurred in the stadium&#x27;s updates over the years. On June 7, 2013, the Zoo unveiled the tribute to the stadium, Rosenblatt Park.

==Atmosphere==
Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium was one of the few stadiums to still use live music instead of prerecorded music. Lambert Bartak, an organist for the Royals, is one of only three organists ever to be ejected during a game, the others being Wilbur Snapp and Derek Dye.

The playing field in Rosenblatt Stadium had the ability to stay playable with even an 8.5 inch (220 mm) per hour rainfall.

==Earlier dimensions==
Before reconfiguration for the 2002 season, the foul lines were (later ), the power alleys were (later ), and center field was (later ). The field was aligned northeast (home plate to center field) at an approximate elevation of above sea level, nearly above the Missouri River.

<doc id="733274" wikidata="Q7226279" url="?curid=733274" title="Polydiacetylenes">
<text>Polydiacetylenes (PDAs) are a family of conducting polymers closely related to polyacetylene. They are created by the 1,4 topochemical polymerization of diacetylenes. They have multiple applications from the development of organic films to immobilization of other molecules.

==History==
The first polydiacetylene to be discovered was Poly(1,6-bishydroxy hexa-2,4-diacetylene) by Gerhard Wegner in 1969. This was achieved by exposing crystals of 1,6-bishydroxy hexa-2,4-diyne to UV light. Polymerization was assumed to occur because of the spatial arrangement of diynes in the crystal, but this was not confirmed until 1972 when Raymond H. Baughman coined the term &quot;topochemical polymerization&quot; to describe polymerization due to spatial arrangement and put forth the spatial requirements needed for a polymerization of this sort.

==Synthesis==

Synthesis of polydiacetylenes occurs through topochemical polymerization of 1,3-diynes. Typically, this must occur in the solid state, because many diynes undergo both 1,2 and 1,4 polymerization in solution – such is the case with diiodobutadiyne, and other diynes with electron withdrawing substituents. The ideal arrangement of diynes in the solid state is a repeat distance of 5Å, a 45° tilt angle, and a 3.5Å distance between C1 of one monomer and C4 of the adjacent diyne monomer.

Usually, polymerization is accompanied by a color change, due to the presence of an extended π-system. In addition, many PDAs exhibit thermochromism caused by twisting of the polymer backbone, changing the amount of conjugation in the system. Depending upon the structure of the monomer, the resulting PDA can have interesting properties such as formation of a vesicle or tube structure.

The chromatic transition from blue to red phase of PDA is caused by the electronic structure of PDAs&#x27; backbone which is featured by the alternative carbon double bond and carbon triple bond. Upon exposure to the external stimuli such as thermal, chemical and mechanical stimulus, the conjugation effect will endow the chromatic properties to this type material. As far as the pure or &quot;intrinsic&quot; PDAs are concerned, the blue to red phase transition is irreversible, however if the head groups of the PDAs&#x27; side chain are strengthened by other structure, for example chelation with metal oxide nanoparticles, it could provide resilience of the backbone to conduct the reversible color change. Several recent researches which assisted by DFT simulation have shown that the chromatic properties could be modified by adjusting the side chain structures of PDA. With the development thin film fabrication technology such as inkjet printing, PDAs could be coated on different substrate materials as multifunctional sensor, for example Kapton films, aluminum foil or even conventional paper.

Zhu et al. have recently published an article about the synthesis of polydiacetylene using copper catalyst. This is first report on synthesis of polydiacetylenes in the solution phase.

<text>The Hammer Museum, which is affiliated with the University of California, Los Angeles, is an art museum and cultural center known for its artist-centric and progressive array of exhibitions and public programs. Founded in 1990 by the entrepreneur-industrialist Armand Hammer to house his personal art collection, the museum has since expanded its scope. The Hammer Museum also hosts over 300 programs throughout the year, from lectures, symposia, and readings to concerts and film screenings. As of February 2014, the museum&#x27;s collections, exhibitions, and programs are completely free to all visitors.

==Exhibitions==

The Hammer opened November 28, 1990, with an exhibition of work by the Ukrainian Suprematist painter Kazimir Malevich which originated at the National Gallery of Art in Washington and subsequently travelled to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The museum has since presented important single-artist and thematic exhibitions of historical and contemporary art. It has developed an international reputation for reintroducing artists and movements that have often been overlooked in the art historical canon. Notable examples include a 2003 retrospective of Lee Bontecou, co-organized with the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; &quot;Heat Waves in a Swamp: The Paintings of Charles Burchfield&quot;, curated by the artist Robert Gober; and &quot;Now Dig This!: Art and Black Los Angeles, 1960–1980&quot;, the Hammer Museum&#x27;s contribution to the Getty&#x27;s 2011 Pacific Standard Time initiative. The Hammer is dedicated to diversity and inclusion. Of all of the solo exhibitions on view in Los Angeles between January 2008 and December 2012, the Hammer is the only institution to devote 50% of its exhibition programming to female artists. The Hammer also hosts roughly fifteen Hammer Projects each year, offering international and local artists a laboratory-like surrounding to create new and innovative work.

===Los Angeles Biennial: &quot;Made in L.A.&quot;===
In 2010 the Hammer announced its inaugural biennial devoted exclusively to Los Angeles artists. Though the museum has routinely featured California artists as part of its ongoing exhibition program, the &quot;Made in L.A.&quot; series has emerged as an important and high-profile platform to showcase the diversity and energy of Los Angeles as an emerging art capitol. Organized by Hammer senior curator Anne Ellegood, Hammer curator Ali Subotnick, LAXART director and chief curator Lauri Firstenberg, LAXART associate director and senior curator Cesar Garcia, and LAXART curator-at-large Malik Gaines, the inaugural &quot;Made in L.A.&quot; in 2012 featured work by 60 Los Angeles artists in spaces throughout the city including the Hammer Museum itself, LAXART, and the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery in Barnsdall Art Park. In conjunction with the exhibition, the Hammer also sponsored a satellite exhibition, the Venice Beach Biennial on the Venice Boardwalk, between July 13 and 15th of that year.

The second iteration of &quot;Made in L.A.&quot; in 2014 took over the entire space of the museum to feature work by more than 30 different artists and collectives. The 2014 exhibition was organized by Hammer chief curator Connie Butler and independent curator Michael Ned Holte.

The most recent &quot;Made in L.A.&quot; exhibition, &quot;Acts of Living&quot;, was organized by curators Diana Nawi and Pablo José Ramírez and Luce Curatorial Fellow Ashton Cooper, features 39 artists, collectives, and organizations representing a cross-section of Los Angeles.

==Collections==
The Hammer Museum manages five distinct collections: The Hammer Contemporary Collection; the collection of the UCLA Grunwald Center for the Graphic Arts; the Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden; the Armand Hammer Collection, and the Armand Hammer Daumier and Contemporaries Collection.

===Hammer Contemporary Collection===
The Hammer Contemporary Collection, inaugurated in 1999, is the museum&#x27;s collection of modern and contemporary art. The collection includes works on paper, primarily drawings and photographs, as well as paintings, sculpture, and media arts. The Contemporary Collection houses works from artists, including many active in Southern California from 1960 to the present. Hammer Contemporary Collection works are often acquired in tandem with exhibitions presented at the museum, including the Hammer Projects series focusing on the work of emerging artists.

The 2009 exhibition Second Nature: The Valentine-Adelson Collection at the Hammer exhibited selections from Dean Valentine and Amy Adelson&#x27;s gift to the Hammer Contemporary Collection. The gift of fifty sculptures by 29 Los Angeles artists represents a significant milestone in the Hammer&#x27;s commitment to collecting the works of Southern California artists.

In 2012, the Hammer showcased selections from the Susan and Larry Marx Collection. The exhibition was made possible by a substantial gift from longtime museum supporters Susan and Larry Marx and includes more than 150 paintings, sculptures, and works on paper by over 100 international artists from the post-World War II period. The collection includes examples of Abstract Expressionism on canvas and paper by the American artists Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Philip Guston as well as works by contemporary artists including Mark Bradford, Rachel Whiteread, Mary Heilmann, and Mark Grotjahn among others.

Highlights from the contemporary collection include: &quot;The Battle of Atlanta: Being the Narrative of a Negress in the Flames of Desire - A Reconstruction&quot; (1995) by Kara Walker, Untitled (2007) by Mark Bradford, Migration (2008) by Doug Aitken, Untitled #5 (2010) by Lari Pittman, Mirage (2011) by Katie Grinnan, Ruby I (2012) by Mary Weatherford, Mimus Act I (2012) by Mary Kelly.

Notable recent acquisitions to the Hammer Contemporary Collection include Suzanne Lacy&#x27;s &quot;Three Weeks in May&quot; (1977), as well as major works by Lisa Anne Auerbach, Fiona Connor, Bruce Conner, Jeremy Deller, Jessica Jackson Hutchins, Friedrich Kunath, Tala Madani, Allan McCollum, Robert Overby, Martha Rosler, Sterling Ruby, Allen Ruppersberg, Barbara T. Smith, William Leavitt, and Eric Wesley.

===UCLA Grunwald Center for the Graphic Arts at the Hammer Museum===

The UCLA Grunwald Center for the Graphic Arts is one of the largest collections of works on paper in the country. Housed at the Hammer Museum, the center was established in 1956 after a gift from Fred Grunwald and today houses over 40,000 prints, drawings, photographs, and artists&#x27; books. The collection includes works dating from the Renaissance to the present, including European old master prints and drawings, Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints, and a collection of contemporary photography initiated by UCLA photographer Robert Heinecken (1931–2006).

In 1988 the Grunwald Center received a bequest of over 850 landscape drawings and prints from the collection of Los Angeles–based architect Rudolf L. Baumfeld. The Baumfeld Collection includes important examples of European landscapes from the 16th to 20th-centuries and includes pure landscapes, as well as views of architectural ruins and urban scenes. The Eunice and Hal David Collection, bequeathed to the Grunwald Center by lyricist Hal David and his wife Eunice, is a collection of 19th and 20th-century drawings by European and American artists. Selections from the collection were exhibited at the Hammer in 2003. The 2014 exhibition showcased works from the Elisabeth Dean Collection of 19th and 20th-century works on paper. The collection of approximately 900 prints and illustrated books is among the most significant gifts received by the Grunwald Center in recent years.

The Grunwald Center is also home to several important collections of Los Angeles–based contemporary artists. The Grunwald Center&#x27;s collection features over 1,000 works by Sister Corita Kent, an influential pop printmaker and social justice activist, including rare preparatory studies and sketchbooks. Additionally, the Grunwald maintains an archive of the first twenty years of June Wayne&#x27;s influential Tamarind Lithography Workshop, offering a rare overview of contemporary print-making in Los Angeles. Jointly acquired by the Grunwald and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Grunwald Center maintains a complete archive of prints by Los Angeles publisher Edition Jacob Samuel which documents the activity of master intaglio print-maker Jacob Samuel. Highlights from the archive were exhibited in the 2010 exhibition Outside the Box: Edition Jacob Samuel, 1988-2010.

A research and education resource, the Grunwald Center study room is available by appointment to faculty, students, and members of the public.

Highlights from the Grunwald&#x27;s collection include: &quot;Melencolia I&quot; (1514) by Albrecht Dürer, &quot;Christ Preaching&quot; (1652) by Rembrandt van Rijn, &quot;Maple trees at Mama, Tekona Shrine and linked Bridge&quot; (1857) by Utagawa Hiroshige, &quot;Les Grands Baigneurs&quot; (1896) by Paul Cézanne, &quot;Le Repas Frugal&quot; (1904) by Pablo Picasso, and &quot;Entropia (review)&quot; (2004), by Julie Mehretu.

===Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden===
The Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden at UCLA was inaugurated in 1967 and dedicated to the eponymous chancellor of the university. Designed by famed landscape architect Ralph Cornell, the garden houses over 70 works of modern and contemporary sculpture in a five-acre, park-like setting. Group tours of the garden can be scheduled through the Hammer&#x27;s online request form.

The 72 object collection comprises works by Deborah Butterfield, Alexander Calder, Henri Matisse, Joan Miró, Henry Moore, Isamu Noguchi, Auguste Rodin, and David Smith. A fully illustrated catalogue, including scholarly entries for each artist, was published by in 2007 by the Hammer Museum.

===Armand Hammer Collection===
The Armand Hammer Collection is a small selection of European and American paintings, drawings, and prints that formed the original impetus for the foundation of the Hammer Museum. Armand Hammer, the founder and namesake of the museum, assembled and refined the collection through decades of involvement in the art market, both as a collector in his own right and as a co-founder of Hammer Galleries in New York City. The focus of the collection is primarily 19th century and early-20th century French impressionist and post-impressionist paintings, though the collection itself spans the 16th through the 20th century.

Selections from the collection are on permanent display in the Hammer Museum&#x27;s third floor galleries. Highlights of the collection include: &quot;Juno&quot; (ca. 1665-1668) by Rembrandt van Rijn, &quot;The Education of the Virgin&quot; (1748-1752) by Jean-Honoré Fragonard, &quot;El Pelele&quot; (ca. 1791) by Francisco Goya, &quot;Salome Dancing before Herod&quot; (1876) by Gustave Moreau, &quot;Dr. Pozzi at Home&quot; (1881) by John Singer Sargent, &quot;Bonjour Monsieur Gauguin&quot; (1889) by Paul Gauguin, and &quot;Hospital at Saint-Remy&quot; (1889) by Vincent van Gogh.

===Daumier and Contemporaries Collection===
The Honoré Daumier and Contemporaries Collection at the Hammer Museum is one of the most important collections of Daumier works outside France. Housing over 7,500 works of art by the French satirist Honoré Daumier (1808-1879) and other contemporary caricaturists, it is the largest of its kind outside of Paris. Daumier was an extremely prolific artist whose work spans multiple media, and as such the collection includes paintings, drawings, lithographs, and a series of bronze portrait busts.

Highlights from the Daumier and Contemporaries Collection include Daumier&#x27;s &quot;Le passé - Le present - L&#x27;avenir&quot; (1834), &quot;Un Avocat Plaidant,&quot; (ca. 1845) &quot;Nadar élevant la Photographie á la hauteur de l&#x27;Art&quot; (1862), and &quot;Don Quixote et Sancho Panza&quot; (1866-1868).

==Programs==
The Billy Wilder Theater opened at the Hammer Museum in late 2006, after a $5 million gift from Audrey L. Wilder, the widow of Billy Wilder, enabled the museum to resume building a 300-seat theater left unfinished at Armand Hammer&#x27;s death. Its 2006 opening coincided with the centennial of Wilder&#x27;s birth. The venue currently houses the UCLA Film and Television Archive&#x27;s well-known cinematheque as well as the Hammer&#x27;s 300 public programs a year.

Popular series include a weekly meditation program, the Libros Schmibros book club, and the Hammer Conversations which place major cultural, political, and intellectual leaders in dialog with one another. Past Hammer Conversations participants include the writers Joan Didion, Jonathan Lethem, and George Saunders, the filmmakers Atom Egoyan and Miranda July, journalist Naomi Klein, comedians Jeff Garlin and Patton Oswalt, playwright and screenwriter David Mamet, magician Ricky Jay, artists Betye Saar and Sam Durant, actors Leonard Nimoy and Zachary Quinto, and many others. Since 2010, the Hammer has partnered with the radio station KCRW to host an annual outdoor summer concert series. In the past, the Hammer traditionally focused on university-level education programs because of its affiliation with UCLA. 

===Mohn Award===
In conjunction with the inaugural &quot;Made in L.A.&quot; exhibition in 2012, the Hammer offered the first iteration of the Mohn Award. The Mohn Award is funded by Los Angeles philanthropists and art collectors Jarl and Pamela Mohn and the Mohn Family Foundation.

The award originally consisted of a catalogue and a $100,000 cash prize and was decided by public vote after a jury of experts narrowed the 60 participants to five finalists. In 2014 the Hammer announced it was offering three awards in conjunction with &quot;Made in L.A. 2014&quot;: The Mohn Award ($100,000), the Career Achievement Award ($25,000)—both of which are selected by a professional jury—and the Public Recognition Award ($25,000), which is awarded by popular vote among exhibition visitors. All three awards are again funded by Jarl and Pamela Mohn and the Mohn Family Foundation.

Past recipients are:
* 2012 – Meleko Mokgosi
* 2014 – Alice Könitz; Michael Frimkess and Magdalena Suarez Frimkess (Career Achievement Award); Jennifer Moon (Public Recognition Award)
* 2016 – Adam Linder; Wadada Leo Smith (Career Achievement Award); Kenzi Shiokava (Public Recognition Award)
* 2018 – Lauren Halsey; Daniel Joseph Martinez (Career Achievement Award); EJ Hill (Public Recognition Award)
* 2021 – Kandis Williams; Monica Majoli (Career Achievement Award); Mr. Wash (Public Recognition Award)
* 2023 – Akinsanya Kambon; Pippa Garner (Career Achievement Award); Jackie Amézquita (Public Recognition Award)

==History==

The museum was founded by Armand Hammer, the late CEO of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, as a venue to exhibit his extensive art collection, at the time valued at $250 million. A Los Angeles County Museum of Art board member for nearly 20 years, Hammer withdrew from a non-binding agreement to transfer his paintings to LACMA after disagreements regarding how his collection would be displayed. Shortly thereafter, on January 21, 1988, Hammer announced plans to build his own museum on the site of a Westwood parking garage adjacent to the Occidental headquarters. Community leaders who hailed the plan as a positive turning point in the neighborhood&#x27;s development were soon overshadowed by complaints from Occidental shareholders who sued the company over the museum&#x27;s escalating construction costs, which were capped by a federal judge at $60 million.

Designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, the New York–based architect responsible for the Dallas Museum of Art and the Walker Art Center, the building housing the museum was conceived as a Renaissance palazzo with galleries centered around a tranquil, interior courtyard and a relatively austere exterior profile.

In 2006, architect Michael Maltzan designed the Billy Wilder Theater and the museum&#x27;s café. Michael Maltzan Architecture also designed the John V. Tunney Bridge, which opened in February 2015. The pedestrian bridge, named in honor of John V. Tunney, longtime Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Hammer Museum, connects the upper level galleries over the Hammer Courtyard.

Hammer died less than a month after his namesake museum opened to the public in November 1990, leaving the fledgling institution mired in litigation over its financing and prompting new legal battles regarding the disposition of Hammer&#x27;s estate. While the museum&#x27;s operating budget was provided by a $36 million annuity purchased by Occidental Petroleum, questions remained regarding the future of the museum&#x27;s collections and the role that the Hammer family would play in its administration. In 1994, the Regents of the University of California entered into a 99-year operating agreement with the Armand Hammer Foundation to assume management of the museum, which afforded the fledgling institution a measure of stability. At that point the exhibition programs of the Wight Art Gallery, UCLA&#x27;s existing museum, and the Grunwald Center for the Graphic Arts, the university&#x27;s print collection, were moved to the Hammer. 

In 2001, Hammer Foundation president Michael Armand Hammer threatened to trigger a contract clause establishing the museum with University of California regents, giving it the right to reclaim the collection and some endowment funds, if strict donation rules were breached. Led by board chairman John V. Tunney and John Walsh, a settlement between the UC Regents and the Hammer Foundation in 2007 formally ended long-simmering disputes over the Hammer collection&#x27;s ownership and established new guidelines for its display that allowed the museum more space for exhibitions and a growing contemporary collection. As part of the agreement, the foundation received 92 paintings — including Chaïm Soutine’s &quot;The Valet&quot; (1929) — together valued at $55 million, while the museum retained more than 100 paintings by Rembrandt, Vincent van Gogh, John Singer Sargent and othersm, valued at $250 million, and 7,500 works by Honoré Daumier and his contemporaries, valued at $8 million.

In 2017, the Hammer opened its renovated third-floor galleries; in 2018, it debuted a newly designed courtyard performance space along with a gallery for new media art. The Annenberg Terrace for education, installations and programming, featuring ping pong tables and couches, opened in 2019. In 2022, a works-on-paper gallery and a study room for the museum’s Grunwald Center Collection opened, along with the museum’s renovated store. The Lynda and Stewart Resnick Cultural Center opened in 2023, thanks to a $30 million gift from the couple-the largest individual gift in the museum&#x27;s history. 

Despite the institutional hurdles that earned it the nickname &quot;America&#x27;s vainest museum&quot; at its inception, the Hammer is now widely acknowledged as &quot;a hot spot for contemporary art and ideas and a venue for serious exploration of overlooked historical subjects.&quot; Under current leadership, the Hammer&#x27;s budget has grown from $5 million to roughly $20 million annually, with a full-time staff of over 100.

In 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the museum was temporary closed and laid off its 150 part-time student employees.

==Management==

===Directors===
In 1994, Henry Hopkins, then director of the Wight gallery and professor in the Department of Art at UCLA, became director of the museum. He served in that position until his retirement in 1998. In 1999 Ann Philbin, previously director of The Drawing Center in New York, was named director. Philbin led the museum for 25 years until her retirement in November 2024. In January 2025, Zoë Ryan, previously director of the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania, became the Hammer&#x27;s director.

===Board of Directors and Board of Overseers===

The Hammer Museum was founded by Dr. Armand Hammer. Michael Armand Hammer is Chairman Emeritus, and Armie Hammer and Viktor Armand Hammer are Honorary Directors. Michael Rubel serves as President, Nelson C. Rising serves as Vice President, and Steven A. Olsen serves as Treasurer. Under Chair Marcy Carsey, the Hammer&#x27;s Board of Directors also includes Heather R. Axe, Renée Becnel, Gene Block, Lloyd E. Cotsen, Eric Esrailian, Erika J. Glazer, Manuela Herzer, Larry Marx, Anthony Pritzker, Lee Ramer, Kevin L. Ratner, Chip Rosenbloom, Steven P. Song, John V. Tunney, Kevin Wall, John Walsh, and Christopher A. Waterman. Members of the Board of Overseers include artists Barbara Kruger and Lari Pittman. The museum does not disclose its annual board membership dues.

===Funding===
In 1994, the Regents of the University of California entered into a 99-year operating agreement with the Armand Hammer Foundation and assumed management of the Hammer Museum, with the foundation retaining some control, including a &quot;reversionary clause,&quot; granting the foundation rights to reclaim the art collection and some of the endowment funds. The museum had long desired to eliminate these clauses. Operating money came from a bond portfolio, UCLA&#x27;s existing art budgets, private donations, and revenue from the museum. In 2009, the museum operates on an annual operating budget of $14 million, 10% to 12% of which comes from the university. By the fiscal year 2011, its budget of $16 million surpassed that of the much larger Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.
On January 19, 2007, the Hammer Museum and the Armand Hammer Foundation agreed to dissolve their relationship, dividing the remaining 195 objects which founded the museum; the foundation retaining 92 paintings valued at $55 million, while the museum retaining 103 objects, valued at $250 million. By 2020, the museum will use its bond portfolio, valued at about $55 million, to purchase the building that houses the museum and Occidental&#x27;s former headquarters.

In addition, the Hammer Museum&#x27;s annual Gala in the Garden serves as a fundraiser for the museum. The 2019 edition raised $2.7 million. Recent museum honorees include Robert Gober, Tony Kushner, Barbara Kruger, Cindy Sherman, Judy Chicago, Jordan Peele and Charles Gaines and Chase Strangio.

===Attendance===
At the Hammer Museum, 2010 attendance was an estimated 175,000, up from 150,000 in 2009. As of 2013, annual attendance for permanent collection, special exhibitions and programs stands at about 200,000. The museum does not provide exact figures as it does not have a computerized ticketing system. 

===Deaccessioning===
In 1994, the Hammer Museum made headlines by selling Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s Codex Leicester to Microsoft founder Bill Gates for $30.8 million. The Codex Leicester was one of Dr. Hammer&#x27;s proudest acquisitions, purchased in 1980 for $5.12 million, and one which he unsuccessfully tried to rename the &quot;Codex Hammer&quot;. Most museums have collection guidelines for deaccessing art, which require the revenue from sales to be used for future acquisitions. The Hammer Museum instead sold the 72-page scientific notebook to fund the museum&#x27;s exhibitions and programs.

<text>El Progreso () is a department in Guatemala. The departmental capital is Guastatoya. The Spanish established themselves in the region by 1551, after the Spanish conquest of Guatemala. El Progreso was declared a department in 1908, but was dissolved in 1920 before being reestablished in 1934. Guastatoya was badly affected by the 1976 Guatemala earthquake.

The department is located in northeastern Guatemala. It is bordered by the departments of Alta Verapaz, Baja Verapaz, Guatemala, Jalapa, and Zacapa. The department occupies an intermediate zone between the hot lowlands and the cooler Guatemalan Highlands, and has a generally hot climate. The most important river is the Motagua. To the north, the department is crossed by the Sierra de las Minas mountain range. The main population centres in El Progreso are Guastatoya, Sanarate and San Agustín Acasaguastlán. The CA-9 Atlantic Highway links the department with Guatemala City and the Atlantic port of Puerto Barrios.

The vast majority of the population of the department are Spanish-speaking Ladinos. The population is growing, but at a rate below the national average. At the same time, the illiteracy rate is falling.

==History==
Historically, the area now included in the department of El Progreso was known as &quot;Guastatoya&quot; or &quot;Huastatoya&quot;, derived from Nahuatl &quot;huäxyötl&quot; or &quot;huäxin&quot; (&quot;calabash&quot;) and &quot;atoyac&quot; (&quot;last&quot;), meaning the last place that calabashes grow, a reference to the change in altitude that occurs in the department, and corresponding climatic change from cold to hot.

===Early history===
The Spanish colonial &quot;corregimiento&quot; of San Cristóbal Acasaguastlán was established in 1551 with its seat in the town of that name, in what is now the eastern portion of the modern department. Most of the area of the modern department fell within the corregimiento of Chiquimula. Acasaguastlán was one of few pre-conquest centres of population in the middle Motagua River drainage, due to the arid climate. In El Progreso it included San Agustín de la Real Corona (modern San Agustín Acasaguastlán) and La Magdalena, but covered a broad area that also included parts of Baja Verapaz and Zacapa. San Cristóbal Acasaguastlán and the surrounding area were reduced into colonial settlements by friars of the Dominican Order; at the time of the conquest the area was inhabited by Poqomchi&#x27; Maya and by the Nahuatl-speaking Pipil. In the 1520s, immediately after conquest, the inhabitants paid taxes to the Spanish Crown in the form of cacao, textiles, gold, silver and slaves. Within a few decades taxes were instead paid in beans, cotton and maize. Acasaguastlán was first given in &quot;encomienda&quot; to conquistador Diego Salvatierra in 1526. The region was subject to a strong influx of Spanish colonists due to its location on the route between the colonial capital and the Caribbean Sea, and hence to Spain, resulting in the hispanicisation of the territory. Guastatoya was mentioned as a village in an edict issued in Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, the colonial capital, in 1758. In 1825, various settlements were integrated into the Acasagustlán district that would later be included in El Progreso department. In the 1870s, the territory was divided between the departments of Guatemala, Zacapa and Chiquimula.

===Departmental history===
The department of El Progreso was created by executive decree on 13 April 1908, to include the municipalities of Acasaguastlán, Cabañas, Guastatoya (which was renamed as El Progreso), Morazán, Sanarate, Sansaria (now known as Sansare), San Antonio La Paz, and San José El Golfo. For a short time from December 1919 to June of the following year, the department was renamed Estrada Cabrera at the request of its constituent municipalities, in order to honour the then-president. On 9 June 1920, after the president was overthrown, the department was dissolved by the government. The municipalities that it had incorporated were returned to their previous jurisdictions. The department was reestablished on 3 April 1934 by the legislative assembly.

The departmental capital of Guastatoya was badly affected by the 1976 Guatemala earthquake, which completely destroyed all historic architecture in the town.

==Geography==
The department of El Progreso is located in northeastern Guatemala. It is bordered to the southwest by the department of Guatemala, to the southeast by Jalapa, to the east by Zacapa, to the west by Baja Verapaz, and to the north by the department of Alta Verapaz.

Other rivers in El Progreso include the Hato, Huija, Huyús, Las Ovejas, Morazán, Plátanos, and Sanarate rivers. To the north of the Motagua, the department is crossed by the Sierra de las Minas mountain range. The highest point in the department is Cerro El Pinalón, in the Sierra de las Minas, at .

The main population centres in El Progreso are Sanarate, Guastatoya, and San Agustín Acasaguastlán. The CA-9 Atlantic Highway crosses the department from west to east, en route from Guatemala City to the Atlantic port of Puerto Barrios. Other principal highways are the CA-17 from El Rancho towards Cobán, and the RN-19 from Sanarate towards Jalapa.

According to the 2018 census, the population of El Progreso was 176,632. In 2013, the non-indigenous proportion of the population was 98.2% against 1.8% indigenous. The majority of the population consists of Spanish-speaking Ladinos, although some traces of indigenous culture survive, such as in modes of dress, linguistic traces, and local customs and beliefs. By 2013 the total population had grown to 163,537. The 2012–2013 population growth rate was 1.73%, below the national average of 2.32%. By gender, 51.9% of the population are female, and 48.1% male.

<doc id="733291" wikidata="Q1153057" url="?curid=733291" title="Sundial Bridge at Turtle Bay">
<text>The Sundial Bridge (also known as the Sundial Bridge at Turtle Bay) is a cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge for bicycles and pedestrians that spans the Sacramento River in Redding, California, United States and forms a large sundial. It was designed by Santiago Calatrava and completed in 2004 at a cost of US$23.5 million. The bridge has become iconic for Redding.

== Description ==
The Sundial Bridge provides pedestrian access to the north and south areas of Turtle Bay Exploration Park, a complex containing environmental, art and history museums and the McConnell Arboretum and Gardens. It also forms the gateway to the Sacramento River Trail, a trail completed in 2010 that extends along both sides of the river and connects the bridge to the Shasta Dam. Drift boats of fishermen are often seen passing beneath the bridge as they fish for salmon, steelhead and rainbow trout. In the distance, Mount Shasta is barely visible. Shasta Bally is visible to the West looking upstream the Sacramento.
== Sundial ==

The support tower of the bridge forms a single mast that points due north at a cantilevered angle (42 degrees), allowing it to serve as the gnomon of a sundial. The spar&#x27;s angle is slightly incorrect for it to be accurate the whole year, as the bridge&#x27;s latitude is approximately 40.59 degrees. It has been billed as the world&#x27;s largest sundial, although Taipei 101 and the associated sundial design of its adjoining park are much larger. The Sundial Bridge gnomon&#x27;s shadow is cast upon a large dial to the north of the bridge. The shadow cast by the tower is said by the nearby time markings (see photo) to be exactly accurate on only one day in a year – the summer solstice, June 20 or 21 – but that has not been demonstrated. The time is given as Pacific Daylight Time. The tip of the shadow moves at approximately one foot per minute so that the Earth&#x27;s rotation about its axis can be seen with the naked eye.

== Design ==
The Sundial Bridge is a cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge, similar to Calatrava&#x27;s earlier design of the &quot;Puente del Alamillo&quot; in Seville, Spain (1992). This type of bridge does not balance the forces by using a symmetrical arrangement of cable forces on each side of its support tower; instead, it uses a cantilever tower, set at a 42-degree angle and loaded by cable stays on only one side. This design requires that the spar resist bending and torsional forces and that its foundation resists overturning. While this leads to a less structurally efficient structure, the architectural statement is dramatic. The bridge is in length and crosses the river without touching the water, a design criterion that helps protect the salmon spawning grounds beneath the bridge. The cable stays are not centered on the walkway but instead divide the bridge into a major and minor path.

The cable for the bridge totals and was made in England. The dial of the sundial and a small plaza beneath the support tower are decorated with broken white tile from Spain. The bridge&#x27;s deck is surfaced with translucent structural glass from Quebec, which is illuminated from beneath and glows aquamarine at night. The steel support structure of the bridge was made in Vancouver, Washington and transported in sections by truck to Redding.
== History ==
Plans for the Sundial Bridge began in the 1990s, when the city of Redding budgeted $3 million for a pedestrian bridge across the river. However, costs escalated after Calatrava&#x27;s design was chosen in 1996, and the project supported by a small group of doctors, lawyers, and other professionals and opposed by other residents who thought it would be too expensive and who favored a more &quot;folksy&quot; covered bridge design. The bridge was completed in 2004, three years later than originally planned, at a cost of $23.5 million, with funding from the Redding-based McConnell Foundation. The expense was justified on the basis that it would increase tourism in the Redding area, which also features Shasta Dam as another architectural marvel, and it has been successful in that goal.

== Tourism ==
In the fiscal year following its grand opening, Turtle Bay Exploration Park, adjacent to the bridge, saw a 42-percent increase in its visitation. As of 2011, Redding&#x27;s city manager stated that the bridge &quot;continues to generate millions of dollars worth of commerce and tourism each year&quot;.

== Events ==
In 2009, Nor-Cal Think Pink, a non-profit organization dedicated to raising awareness of the importance of early detection of breast cancer, received approval from the City of Redding to illuminate the Sundial Bridge in pink for its Think Pink Day. The event now takes place annually.

== In popular culture==
The bridge is the cover image of a general physics textbook by Serway and Jewett, demonstrating the bridge resisting forces of wind and gravity.

<doc id="733297" wikidata="Q2602677" url="?curid=733297" title="Nate Grey">
<text>Nathaniel &quot;Nate&quot; Grey (X-Man) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. Created by writer Jeph Loeb and artist Steve Skroce, the character first appeared in &quot;X-Man&quot; #1 (March 1995).

X-Man is an alternate version of the regular Marvel Universe hero Cable, hailing from the alternate timeline Earth-295, first established in the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; storyline. He is the biological son of his dimension&#x27;s Scott Summers and Jean Grey, born of genetic tampering by Mr. Sinister. His first name is derived from his creator&#x27;s (Mr. Sinister&#x27;s) real name, Nathaniel Essex, and his last name from his genetic mother, Jean Grey. Due to not being infected by a techno-organic virus, as Cable was, Nate achieved vast telepathic and telekinetic powers (reflecting those that Cable would have had without the virus), and was one of the most powerful mutants in existence during his lifetime.

&quot;X-Man&quot; was originally a mini-series replacing &quot;Cable&quot; during 1995&#x27;s &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; alternate reality storyline. After that storyline ended, Marvel transported Nate Grey to Earth-616, the primary shared universe in which most Marvel Comics are set. The series ran until 2001, during which Nate struggled with adjusting to a strange and foreign world, while being the most powerful person in this selfsame world. The series ended with his seemingly sacrificial death.

Despite his name, X-Man was only briefly a member of the X-Men, both in the Age of Apocalypse reality and on Earth-616. Initially, the character was referred to only by his real name, both in &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; and on Earth-616. Shortly before the &quot;Onslaught&quot; storyline, Nate began to be sporadically referred to as X-Man, without explanation for the in-universe origin of the code name.

==Publication history==

Nate Grey first appeared in an eponymous four-issue miniseries in 1995 written by Jeph Loeb and drawn by Steve Skroce. Afterward, the character starred in a self-titled ongoing series. When sales began to wane in 2000, the series was revamped by Warren Ellis as part of the Revolution event beginning with issue 64 with Nate under the name of Shaman. The new direction was unsuccessful, and &quot;X-Man&quot; was canceled at issue 75 in 2001.

The character returned during the 2008 - 09 &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, appearing in the miniseries &quot;Dark X-Men&quot;. He was also featured in &quot;New Mutants&quot; (vol. 3) #25-50.

== Fictional character biography ==

=== Age of Apocalypse ===
In the parallel reality known as The Age of Apocalypse, Mister Sinister, one of the elite Horsemen of the High Lord Apocalypse, artificially created Nate (naming him Nathaniel Grey), from genetic material from Cyclops and Phoenix. Sinister created Nate as the ultimate mutant and hoped to use him in his own bid for power against Apocalypse.

However, Cyclops, in his many subversive raids on Sinister&#x27;s pens, helped Nate escape Sinister&#x27;s hideout; neither Cyclops nor Nate knew their connection to each other. Nate came under the tutelage of Forge and several other mutant outcasts. Forge began the long process of teaching Nate how to control his powers as well as the benefits of being a &quot;good guy&quot;. Nate also began to see the horrors of Apocalypse&#x27;s world firsthand, and was determined to bring him down.

Sinister infiltrated Forge&#x27;s group disguised as the wanderer Essex in order to follow Nate&#x27;s progress. Sinister eventually killed both Brute and Forge. Nate battled Sinister to avenge Forge&#x27;s death. During the conflict, Sinister allowed Nate to read his mind, revealing both Nate&#x27;s origin and his ultimate destiny of defeating Apocalypse. Sinister emerged from the fight mortally wounded, and Nate left to battle Apocalypse. That battle occurred while the alternate X-Men were beginning their final gambit—defeating this reality with the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal.

Holocaust interrupted Nate&#x27;s battle with Apocalypse as the X-Men&#x27;s plan succeeded and the Age of Apocalypse was washed away. In response, an angry Nate impaled Holocaust with a shard of the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal, with unexpected results — both vanished.

===A New World===

The consequences of that act were unexpected and far-reaching, as Nate and Holocaust were both transported to the actual reality when it reasserted itself. Nate arrives in Switzerland, and is approached by a very alive but amnesic Madelyne Pryor. Madelyne helps Nate adjust to this reality, but they are separated soon after by Selene. Nate wanders the Earth alone, encountering many who either desire to use his power or genuinely want to help him, only for Nate&#x27;s own suspicious nature to prompt him to drive them away. During this time, he unintentionally contributes to the eventual manifestation of Onslaught: Nate senses Xavier&#x27;s astral form spying on him, and drags him into the real world. This feat inspires the aspects of Onslaught in Xavier&#x27;s mind to create a psychic body for himself, resulting in Onslaught manifesting an independent body.

Eventually, Nate meets Threnody, one of Sinister&#x27;s underlings seeking freedom. After rescuing her from the Marauders, the pair form a mutually beneficial partnership: Nate provides protection, while Threnody acts as his guide to the world. They are briefly separated during the events set into motion by Onslaught, but soon reunite and take refuge in New York following his defeat. Their relationship deepens despite Nate&#x27;s lingering doubts on her connection to Sinister, but Threnody eventually leaves, unwilling to answer questions about her past.
Believing Threnody to be dead, Nate takes up a firm if tentative friendship with Spider-Man. Nate is then attacked by Morbius the Living Vampire, who is drawn to Threnody via the strong attachment to her in Nate&#x27;s blood. Due to her own death-fueled mutant ability, Threnody is drawn to Morbius as well, but Nate and Spider-Man intervene. Nate challenges Threnody to return to him once she has given up on stealing life from others and leaves her. He soon finds Madelyne collapsed in Switzerland. The reunion is interrupted by Jean Grey, who is alerted to Madelyne&#x27;s return by Madame Sanctity. Nate is doubly shocked, first when Madelyne immediately begins trying to kill their visitor, and again when he sees that the two women are virtually twins. Madelyne assumes Nate will side with Jean and attacks them both.

Nate instinctively aids Jean, and together they are able to pierce Madelyne&#x27;s mind, in the process revealing that Nate is responsible for her revival. In his confusion, after crash-landed in Switzerland, Nate unconsciously resurrects Madelyne Pryor in his subconscious attempt to reach out to his &quot;mother&quot;. Nate sorrowfully attempts to undo his mistake, but Madelyne refuses to die again. She returns the power Nate used to animate her and escapes. Nate turns down Jean&#x27;s offer to contact the X-Men, but then discovers that his telekinesis is gone. Nate visits Moira MacTaggert for answers, which she provides: Nate&#x27;s telekinetics are still there, but his own body is suppressing them. Havok appears as Nate is leaving, and invites him to join the Brotherhood of Mutants.

Nate helps the Brotherhood liberate Aurora, a former member of Alpha Flight, from Department H. Havok helps Nate regain his telekinesis to the point where he can fly again via a meditation chamber. Nate later discovers the operation to free Aurora had a second purpose: to obtain canisters of Coldsnap-9, a deadly gas. Worse, Nate learns that Dark Beast is a member of the Brotherhood. Nate tries to separate Aurora from the Brotherhood, but quickly learns that due to her personality shifts, she needs treatment that Dark Beast can best provide. However, Nate refuses to leave the gas in the Brotherhood&#x27;s hands, and opens all of the canisters, exposing himself to the gas.

Nate survives due to the timely return of his telekinetics at their peak, but collapses from exhaustion in New York, where he is found and cared for by three mysterious girls named Jam (Jasmine Archer), Marita, and Bux. Soon after, Nate is telepathically alerted by Cable that he is the only one close enough to protect the children of Jean&#x27;s sister, Sara Grey, from the Prime Sentinels of . Nate rescues the kids despite his weakened state, leaving Joey and Gailyn in the care of their grandparents.

Nate&#x27;s time in New York is marked by near-endless conflict and his powers spiraling out of control. He is attacked by the psychotic killer Jackknife, a remnant of the Abomination&#x27;s followers. Nate himself unknowingly unlocked Jackknife&#x27;s latent potential in the past, and though Jackknife proves immune to Nate&#x27;s abilities, Nate manages to defeat him, earning the favor of many citizens who witness the battle. The next day, Jam loses an arm in a motorcycle crash, but is mysteriously healed by a doctor who has had contact with Nate. The miracle boosts Nate&#x27;s popularity even more, and he is admired by hundreds of followers. Nate thwarts a terrorist attack, but when lives are still lost, his admirers turn on him. Nate learns that the one responsible for Jam&#x27;s accident, as well as his curiously fast rise to and fall from fame, is the Purple Man, who has been controlling Nate and the citizens with his pheromones.

The Purple Man hopes to turn Nate into a modern messiah and use his power to alter reality. The plan backfires: Nate resists being controlled, and upon learning that Jam&#x27;s healed arm was only a solid psionic projection, he loses faith in himself. In desperation, Nate tries to erase all memories of himself from the minds of New Yorkers. Spider-Man intervenes, pleading with Nate not to do it. The two come to blows, but are attacked by the Psi-Ops, a mysterious team of armored psi-talents seeking to capture Nate. Nate and Spider-Man defeat them, saving a bridge full of people in the process, but are still blamed for the entire mess. Nate is still plagued by self-doubt when Madelyne Pryor returns to him.

Once they relocate to Canada, the new Madelyne seems intent on forcing Nate to admit he needs her. Nate resists, and is troubled by a nightmarish vision of his end: battling a masked madman in a pyramid, a stranger watches from the shadows as Nate and half of the world are consumed by an explosion of his power. This causes him to unleash a huge burst of power in the real world, which awakens three of the Great Beasts: Tundra, Kolomaq, and Somon. Nate destroys Tundra, and launches Kolomaq and Somon into space to keep them from destroying a nearby town. Madelyne refuses to play the part of the hero and help Nate fight, but returns to teleport him back to Switzerland.

While recovering in Madelyne&#x27;s care, Nate realizes that Threnody&#x27;s mutant power might not only allow her to escape death, but also to drain his power, keeping it at controllable levels. He seeks her on the psi-plane, but Madelyne jealously interferes. Nate&#x27;s effort is interrupted when the psi-plane shatters around him, robbing he and Madelyne both of their telepathy.

Nate and Madelyne protect the town of Clifden from several disasters, which are eventually linked to tech-gnomes. During this they meet and are constantly shadowed by Ness, a member of the secret human/demon hybrid race, the Hellbent, who also had a vision that Nate would soon be responsible for the destruction of the planet. They travel to Dublin, where a series of murders have left victims burned down to their bones. Nate detects an AOA energy signature on the corpses, and discovers that Nemesis is responsible. With Madelyne&#x27;s help, Nemesis&#x27;s armor implodes, leaving him to escape in his human form.

Nate then learns that Blaquesmith has been sending him the visions as a warning, and the tech-gnomes as a test, in order to prepare Nate for a future that he must avoid at all costs (the very same that Ness seeks to prevent). He transports Nate and Madelyne to Latveria for a confrontation with the resurrected Stryfe, Cable&#x27;s evil clone and thus yet another sibling/counterpart of Nate, during the &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; crossover. Stryfe uses Doom&#x27;s power siphon to drain Nate&#x27;s enormous power into himself, but with assistance from Cable and Madelyne, he is defeated. It is revealed that it was Stryfe (the masked madman from Nate&#x27;s vision) and not Nate, who would be responsible for the end of the world.

Nate was also continually hunted by Operation: Gauntlet, a special task force of the United Nations, who had been especially ordered to target and destroy him specifically, as the potential single greatest threat to all life on Earth. During their final confrontation in Ireland, Ness was killed and Madelyne was presumed to have died as well. However, she had merely been drained of her life energy during the intense battle to the point that she was now physically extremely aged, and secretly chose to abandon Nate rather than let him see her in such a condition.

Nate went on to have additional rematches with fellow AoA refugees Dark Beast (who again teamed up with Gene Nation against Nate, who teamed up briefly with Generation X), Sugar Man and Holocaust (now calling himself Nemesis).

Nate visited his &quot;parents,&quot; Scott and Jean, who were at the time recuperating in Alaska. The strength of the newly forged bonds between Nate and his &quot;parents&quot; was shown when, soon after, as the X-Men had been disbanded, Nate (alongside Archangel, Wolverine and Cable) was one of the few people Jean and Scott called for help, as they needed to defend the new race &quot;the Mannites&quot; from the mysterious &quot;Death&quot;. After meeting with the Fantastic Four, Nate would then be captured by a re-villainous Caliban, upon orders of Apocalypse who planned to use Nate as the new host-body for his soul, during the &quot;Twelve Saga&quot;. However, Cyclops ultimately sacrificed himself instead, in place of his &quot;son&quot;, an act that would eventually have many significant repercussions much later in time for the rest of the X-Men.

Nate was also reunited with Threnody, who revealed the circumstances of their separation (mainly, that Madelyne had killed her), which had been unknown to Nate until then. However, during their time apart, Threnody had fully evolved into a mutant death-goddess, constantly pursued by &quot;zomboids&quot;, and with no desire to reform despite Nate&#x27;s devotion to saving her. They separated for good, and though Threnody is revealed to have given birth to a monstrous baby, the father&#x27;s identity remains unknown.

===Shaman to the Mutant Tribe===
Madelyne Pryor eventually returned some time later, but she was manipulating Nate in his sleep and making him destroy things. She finally revealed that she was a Madelyne from another dimension, who had killed the original Madelyne shortly after her last meeting with Nate in Ireland. This alternate-Madelyne needed Nate to do something for her and showed him how to shift between parallel earths or alternate realities, and she had Nate take them to the alternate reality that she was from. She wanted to use Nate&#x27;s vast power to help her rule her Earth. Nate rejected her, and was located by that alternative reality&#x27;s version of himself, who was a broken version of Nate Grey (meaning he could never reach his full potential in power) and was slightly insane from his experiences; he also considered himself a shaman to the people of that Earth. Nate read the mind of his alternate self to learn the intricacies of alternate realities.

Nate also learned how Madelyne would take each Nate Grey from these alternate realities hoping to find &quot;fully functional&quot; ones to use as weapons to rule. He also showed Nate how to talk with a dead man so that they could get information from him about Madelyne; the dead man was that reality&#x27;s Forge, who was at one time Madelyne&#x27;s lover. Forge revealed that Madelyne was really a Jean Grey from yet another parallel Earth who posed as Madelyne and ruled that world. That reality&#x27;s real Madelyne had died, but it was said she would return again. Forge also told them how this alternate Jean Grey had used him to make her a machine so she could travel from parallel world to parallel world. At this point, they were attacked by Madelyne&#x27;s personal bodyguard, Mr. Scratch and in the process, merged parts of themselves to throw him off. Mr. Scratch&#x27;s mutant power was that no other mutant power had any effect on him, so the Nates had to literally change characteristics to fool him.

After the merger, only one Nate remained, so Mr. Scratch crippled him and brought him back to Madelyne, who quickly realized that Mr. Scratch had the wrong Nate. The broken version of Nate told Madelyne he sent Nate somewhere she would never find him. She killed the broken Nate and began to power her parallel world device to find Nate again, but Nate returned and put an end to her world conquering days. As a result of the merger of the two Nates, a black x-shaped tattoo appeared on Nate&#x27;s chest to act as a genetic brand - passed on to him from the alternate version of himself - that prevented his powers from killing him as they had threatened to do from the start.

After the defeat of this evil &quot;Queen Jean&quot;, Nate set out to make a difference in the world and considered himself a Mutant Shaman, a teaching he embraced from the alternate version of himself. Nate became immensely powerful, and had few qualms about using his power to mete out justice to his fellow mutants. He then dealt with and stopped the madman Qabiri from destroying all alternate earths on the Spiral of Earths. Qabiri was a being from an alternate Earth far upspiral, he wanted to destroy every earth below his on the Spiral of Earths because he feared that someone from these lower earths would one day invade his earth and bring it to ruin. Qabiri succeeded in destroying several alternate earths before Nate was able to stop him.

Finally, he confronted the Anti-Man, an alien sent to Earth to inseminate his genetic code into all living cells on the planet so that his people could harvest the resulting energy. To save the world from destruction, Nate merged himself with the Anti-Man, in essence &quot;poisoning&quot; the cells of Earth with his presence, and dissipating both of them across the globe.

Dark Beast commented that the peculiar circumstances of X-Man&#x27;s demise would theoretically allow him to be restored to life.

===Return===
Nate resurfaces once more, in a small town, where his presence causes several of the inhabitants to dreamwalk and continuously repeat &quot;I&#x27;m an X-Man.&quot; Norman Osborn sends his team of X-Men, consisting of Mimic, Weapon Omega, Dark Beast and Mystique, to investigate and to raise public opinion.

As Norman&#x27;s X-Men investigate, both Mimic and Omega are overwhelmed with Nate&#x27;s energies and go on a rampage leaving Mystique and Dark Beast alone with a patient that they were examining. Shortly Nate once more takes physical form, much to Beast&#x27;s shock and horror, believing Mystique to be his mother Jean Grey, since she had taken her form.

Nate angrily attacks Beast but does not realize that Jean is actually Mystique who manages to distract him long enough in order to save Dark Beast&#x27;s life. Following that incident Osborn tasks his X-Men to hunt down and possibly capture Nate for experimentation and to feed Weapon Omega. In order to do that the Osborn&#x27;s X-Men go to H.A.M.M.E.R.&#x27;s PSI-division, which has taken a cult like appearance. The PSI-Division manages to contact Nate only for him to absorb most of their psychic energies and to learn what has happened to the world and to the mutant race in his absence. Angrily he demands to know what they, presumably Osborn&#x27;s X-Men, had done.

Nate finally manages to materialize and confronts Norman&#x27;s X-Men. He dispatches the Sentry by telling him of their mutual past, something that he claims to be the truth, which upsets Sentry so that he retreats in order to consider this. The other members of Norman&#x27;s team do not fare better either. Only Ares poses a threat. Since Ares is the personification of War, Nate is unable to perceive any future or probability that does not include Ares fighting him. Mimic, still rattled by the vision he saw, attempts to learn more. He drags Nate into another plane of existence. After a short conversation they are once more confronted by Ares, who has followed them and is overjoyed to have an opponent such as Nate. Ares finally manages to overpower Nate and while Norman attempts to confirm Nate&#x27;s death, a flash of light knocks them all back leaving the room empty and Nate&#x27;s body missing.

Unbeknown to the Dark X-Men, Nate has taken possession of Norman&#x27;s body, something that only Mystique notices. After trying and failing to persuade Nate to remove the tech in her body which is rigged to explode should she betray Norman, she recruits the rest of the Dark X-Men to invade Norman&#x27;s mind and to confront X-Man. While Nate and Norman are engaged in a battle of wills Norman gloats that he and Nate are evenly matched. Yet Nate reveals that this was his plan all along, and that while he and Norman are deadlocked his X-Men are free to roam the deepest recesses of Norman&#x27;s mind. They do and by doing so they unlock Norman&#x27;s Green Goblin personality which gloatingly states is about to kill them all.

After a brief battle between the Green Goblin and the Dark X-Men within Osborn&#x27;s mind, Nate is defeated when Green Goblin forces Mimic to replicate Omega&#x27;s powers, turning the pair into a powerful siphon that drains Nate&#x27;s energies. Now returned to the physical world, a powerless Nate is tortured in front of the Dark X-Men as an example to them. Norman asks him if he has any last words before he&#x27;s &quot;used as coal&quot; in Dark Beast&#x27;s Omega Machine, but a gloating Norman cuts off Nate before he has a chance to finish speaking. Nate is taken away to the machine, though his eventual fate is not shown.

===Rescue Mission===
Learning that Nate Grey had returned to the living, Cyclops reorganizes the New Mutants roster under Danielle Moonstar&#x27;s leadership and tells them to find Nate and bring him home. Nate is found in an abandoned H.A.M.M.E.R. facility in a sadistic scheme of the Sugar Man. Sugar Man has Nate hooked up into the Omega Machine, a device built by Norman Osborn to open portals to other realities, hoping that he will open a portal to Sugar Man&#x27;s home reality. Realizing that the only way Sugar Man will leave him alone is to give him what he wants, Nate uses all of his strength and willpower to open a portal to his home reality, but before Sugar Man can escape into it, he is defeated by the New Mutants and was going to be taken into custody by Captain Steve Rogers.

Nate is taken to Utopia, where it is revealed that he burnt out most of his powers while opening Sugar Man&#x27;s portal, and the only remaining power he has is telekinesis. Cyclops then welcomes Nate to Utopia, hoping he will make it his new home.

===Fear Itself===
Spending most of his time in Utopia&#x27;s danger room, Nate tested his new limits and quickly realized just how diminished his telekinesis was. Seeing Nate as a younger version of her father, Cable, Hope Summers took a keen interest in Nate and watched as his frustration grew. She stepped in and offered to teach Nate what Cable taught her: how to get by without powers. Nate gladly accepted and the two began to train regularly together.
Perhaps feeling indebted to them for their rescue, Nate joined Moonstar&#x27;s team without being asked. Although feeling insecure with his lessened powers, he began to use his telekinesis more effectively after taking Sunspot&#x27;s advice to visualize a symbol. After an accidental side trip to Hell the team journeys to the Nordic Hel to aid the goddess Hela against the Serpent&#x27;s undead soldiers. Nate&#x27;s memories of the Age of Apocalypse play a pivotal role in victory and he continues to learn how to cope with his diminished powers.

===Schism===
After an explosive argument over the way the younger generation of mutants were being treated, Wolverine decided to part ways from Cyclops and reopen the school in Westchester. Agreeing with the idea that the X-Men shouldn&#x27;t be concerned with shielding kids from the harsh realities of life and wanting to get to know Cyclops better, Nate wanted to stay on his side. At the same time, Nate was used to being independent and decided to join Dani&#x27;s team when they moved into a house in San Francisco where they would continue to report to Cyclops but attempt to live normal lives, as well as helping the team search for Clarice Fergison. They join her on her mission to discover why a rock band is causing natural disasters. Following their adventure Blink decides to journey to the Jean Grey School to learn more about her powers.

===Re-Animator===
After suffering a series of nightmares, Doug Ramsey convinced the team to visit Paradise Island, the place where he once died. Tensions flared when Nate began to question Doug&#x27;s mental stability which led to Dani insulting Nate&#x27;s low-level telekinesis. While Nate admitted that he could still only pick up with telekinesis what he could lift physically, he later demonstrated his new method of telekinetic attack when the team came under attack from the island&#x27;s Ani-Mates. By focusing his telekinesis into the shape of an X, Nate was able to target his power more precisely. The trip proved to be worthwhile when they discovered a plot by the Ani-Mator to return to life in virus form. Infected by the virus and fused together, a feverish Nate and Dani began to acknowledge their attraction to each other.

The Ani-Mator was defeated but the horrific mission took a toll on the team. Noticing the somber mood, X-Men ally Blink took the team for a night out in Madripoor. While the rest of the team partied, Nate drifted off by himself, unsure how to act in such a jovial atmosphere. Dani reached out to comfort him and the two finally expressed their feelings for each other with an intimate kiss.

===Exiled===
Nate&#x27;s mutant abilities began to steadily improve. He mastered his X-shaped telekinetic technique and even managed to use his telepathy in small doses. The New Mutants and the gods of Asgard soon come into conflict when the &quot;First Hero&quot; Sigurd returns and is pursued by the vampiric Disir. When Sigurd&#x27;s spell turns the Asgardians into mortals and erases their memories it is up to the New Mutants team and Kid Loki to save the day. Danielle Moonstar journeys to Hel to retrieve Bor, the Father of Odin to free the Disir from his curse. Finally the truth behind the Disir is revealed and Hela acquires bold new allies.

His knowledge and familiarity of alternate universes became handy when the New Mutants found themselves in one created by a future megalomaniac version of Doug Ramsey. When the X-Men and Avengers went to war over how to handle the Phoenix Force, Nate fought bravely on the front lines; first to protect Hope Summers and then to defend Cyclops&#x27; utopian rule. When Cyclops became corrupt due to the Phoenix Force, his leadership came to a disastrous end and Dani&#x27;s team went their separate ways. When Moonstar joined the superhero team, the Defenders, Nate remained close to her and the pair finally confirmed their relationship status when they awkwardly ran into Dani&#x27;s former flame, Cannonball.

Nate Grey&#x27;s whereabouts are presently obscure, but Matthew Rosenberg has confirmed that he is backpacking through Europe on a soul-searching journey in response to a fan&#x27;s comments on Twitter. He later went on to admit that his earlier statement was a joke and has since said that Nate is a mystery, he &quot;vanishes, maybe he&#x27;ll come back at some point?&quot;

===Horsemen of Salvation===
Nate Grey has since made his presence known in the Prime Earth apparently with all his powers intact and a change of heart since he had kidnapped Magneto, Warren Worthington, Blob and Omega Red in order to turn them into his Horsemen of Salvation, an inversion of the Horsemen of Apocalypse, and also abducted Kitty Pryde, anti-mutant senator Ashton Allen and Apocalypse himself and sent the Horsemen to remove the X-Men from their way and used his telepathy to reach every mind on Earth to share his vision of the world and to reshape it to his image. He may had also used the Horsemen to hunt down Dark Beast and Sugar Man, or more likely hunted them down himself and while Dark Beast was able to survive, Sugar Man wasn&#x27;t that lucky. Nate later reveals that his powers are killing him, even though he possesses the black x-shaped tattoo, and for that reason he decided to change the world for better. During the last stand, Nate takes Jean Grey to his own mind and finally reveals to her that he&#x27;s dying because he found and used the Life Seed on himself which not only made him recover his powers but also increased them to the point of overriding the black x-shaped tattoo which was protecting him and in the process twisted his mind. Though Jean tries to reason with him, Nate nevertheless uses all his powers to finally reshape the world in his image, a world where the X-Men no longer exists.

===Age of X-Man===

By using the Life Seed he possessed, Nate Grey created hope out of thin air and secretly took the X-Men to this new plane of existence where everyone is a mutant and no longer persecuted for being different. He also implanted fake memories on them so they couldn&#x27;t remember their old lives in the Marvel Prime Universe. However, fissures in the air teased that everything isn&#x27;t as it seems with certain individuals beginning to remember their old lives once the floodgates opened. Nate just couldn&#x27;t stop those memories from appearing, no matter how hard he tried. Eventually some confront X-Man over his deception, while others try to protect him from their attack as he attempts to explain his thought process. At one point a fissure opens, revealing a scene from the Prime Universe with Cyclops, Havok, Mirage and Mystique squaring off against Office of National Emergency soldiers. Later, other X-Men begin to revert to their pre-Age of X-Man appearances. Surprisingly, while a majority of the X-Men are furious with Nate for his deception, there are a few who wish to remain in this false reality.

Bishop tries to be the voice of reason among his teammates by urging them to leave the world behind. However, X-Man offers up a solution by handing over the Life Seed that helped him create the utopia. Once the X-Men have passed back through the breach, Magneto would plunge the Life Seed in Nate&#x27;s chest, destroying the Age of X-Man once and for all.

But instead of using the Life Seed, Magneto and Nate sit down to discuss how they both can help one another. Because Nate allowed Magneto to live in a world that was the exact opposite of what he was born into, Magneto hands the Life Seed back to Nate to allow the Age of X-Man to live on. Once Magneto exits, his Age of X-Man counterpart reappears, which possibly means he left a part of himself behind.

==Powers and abilities==
Originally designed so his powers would eventually kill him, Nate was an Omega-level mutant who had the ability to tap into the enormous psychic resources of the astral plane in order to manipulate matter and energy at vast scales until his powers were burnt out by the Omega Machine. The Omega Machine, designed by Dark Beast, greatly diminished Nate&#x27;s once incredible psychic powers including telepathy, precognition, and telekinesis.

He could use his telepathy to read and control multiple minds at once and even read residual thought imprints left on objects touched by people (psychometry), communicate with others by broadcasting his thoughts, create illusions by altering the perceptions of others, fire psionic blasts that could scramble an opponent&#x27;s thought processes (causing the victim either intense pain, or rendering them unconscious), project his mind into the astral plane and even pull the astral projections of other telepaths into the physical world, and sense dimensional rifts or anomalies. He once even used the photoelectric transmission of a Shi&#x27;ar hologram to psionically connect his mind with that of Lilandra over an unknown interstellar distance.

His telekinesis was so powerful that he could move massive objects with his mind, fire blasts of psychokinetic energy that could shatter steel, create mental barriers that could stop most attacks, levitate his body, and fly at supersonic speeds. He was powerful enough to single handedly defeat Tundra of the Great Beasts and was even able to psionically isolate the planet&#x27;s gravitational pull on the two other Great Beasts, Tolomaq and Somon. He also crushed the whole city of San Francisco de Quito, Ecuador while asleep in Buenos Aires, Argentina; the cities are over 2600 miles apart.

His control over his telekinesis was so acute that he was able to create holograms by mentally manipulating water, molecules and dust to refract light, bend security lasers to avoid detection, and even move the atoms of a wall around his form so that he passed through the wall like a ghost. He was also able to use his telekinesis to bend the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and create electromagnetic pulses. His telekinesis extended to at least a molecular level, and he could imbue himself with super human physical attributes by focusing his telekinesis inwards.

After his brief return from his dimensional travels that equipped him with a special genetic dampener that would eventually prevent his powers from killing him, Nate displayed further abilities, which included the power to view and traverse higher planes of existence, to reconstitute his body from astral energy in a similar manner as Onslaught and to transform his physical body back into astral energy. Though not a real teleporter, he then could traverse alternate realities by breaking the barriers between universes and once &#x27;teleported&#x27; multiple people all over an alternate version of New York into another dimension. Since he was able to connect any point in one dimension with any point in the dimension he was in at the moment, he could theoretically also use this to cross vast interstellar distances by traveling back and forth.

An alternate version of Jean Grey, &quot;Queen Jean&quot; described Nate Grey as the ultimate telekinetic with the statement: &quot;It is what all Nate Greys have been on every earth&quot;.

Upon examination by Moira MacTaggert, she suggested his psionic powers rivaled that of a Phoenix Force-imbued Jean Grey. In another instance, he was measured as having a psionic energy output matching that of the Dark Phoenix. He was even described by Norman Osborn as powerful enough to go toe-to-toe with the Sentry.

However, Nate lost most of his powers after using nearly all of his strength and willpower to open a portal to Sugar Man&#x27;s home reality, a process that gave him acute nerve damage, which effectively burnt out his power set. Although at first the only ability he had was some residual telekinesis, which has had been defined by himself as an extension of his physical strength and therefore limited to masses equivalent to what he can lift or manipulate physically. He has also shown the power to produce small but powerful telekinetic blasts and demonstrated some residual telepathy that enabled him to deliberately scan and perceive his immediate vicinity for sentient beings; along with assist his teammate Cypher in entering his own mind. He is also able to levitate himself over short-distances.

Recently, Nate was able to use a Life Seed to restore his powers. However, this process overruled his X-shaped genetic tattoo. Because of this Nate was slowly being killed once again by the level of his powers. He can capture and humiliate Apocalypse; turn off Kitty Pryde&#x27;s powers; control Omega-level mutants like Magneto and Storm, turning them into his Horsemen of Salvation; telepathically communicate with everyone on Earth; wipe out all places of worship on Earth with a thought; overpower Legion in Legion&#x27;s own mind and take over his body; and create a new reality where everyone is a mutant, and then transport people to that reality against their will. Legion claims that Nate is so powerful that he belongs to a level above Omega.

==Reception==
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked X-Man/Nate Grey 99th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.
* In 2018, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked X-Man 19th in their &quot;Age Of Apocalypse: The 30 Strongest Characters In Marvel&#x27;s Coolest Alternate World&quot; list.

==Relationship to Cable==
Although Nate Grey (X-Man) is the Age of Apocalypse counterpart of Nathan Christopher Summers (Cable), their parentage is not identical. Both are descended from the genetic material of Scott Summers and Jean Grey, but the circumstances of Cable&#x27;s and Nate&#x27;s birth/creation are entirely different: Nate was grown in a laboratory in an alternate dimension by Mr. Sinister from the genes of Scott and Jean, and Cable was born to Scott and Madelyne Pryor (a clone of Jean Grey also created by Mr. Sinister). As a result, Cable has taken to referring to Nate as his half-brother.

Due to their genetic similarities, and lending support to the notion of their being counterparts, Nate and Cable have identical psychic profiles, resulting in a painful feedback to both parties when they are in close proximity to each other, in a way never demonstrated when either was in close proximity to Stryfe, Cable&#x27;s clone - though this is shown to vary with the strength of their respective telepathic abilities. For instance, when Cable&#x27;s telepathy was burnt out, they did not face that problem. Both are physically quite similar, with the same glowing left eye and blanched hair (though to different degrees due to age). Moreover, when Cable was de-aged in &quot;Cable and Deadpool&quot;, he greatly resembled Nate Grey, while a &quot;What If?&quot; set in a possible future showed that Nate would grow up to look identical to Cable, though that is not uncommon for siblings, which - genetically speaking - they are.

However, Nate and Cable are distinct in a number of ways. First, Nate, having done no time traveling, is much younger than Cable. Second, Nate is much more powerful than Cable, as Cable&#x27;s techno-virus infection means that he must continuously use most of his power to keep the virus at bay, while Nate has full access to his mutant abilities - though at least at first, Cable had a far greater degree of skill in using those powers. Finally, Cable possesses extensive military and weapons skills as a result of being raised in a war torn future ruled by Apocalypse, while Nate primarily relies on his considerable mutant powers.

The juxtaposition of the two characters allowed writers to address issues of identity and nature versus nurture and explore the complex nature of family relationships in the X-Men&#x27;s world.
==Collected editions==
==Other versions==
During his time on Earth 998, ruled by the evil Queen Jean, X-Man not only met one of his counterparts, but he also learned that there had been many Nate Greys in the multiverse. Obviously, he was not as unique as he thought. Apparently, the one thing all Nates had in common was that they had been born/created on a different Earth than the one they later ended up living on. Each Nate Grey being the ultimate telekinetic weapon, Queen Jean hunted them down and lured them to her reality, to make good use of them. She had her scientists come up with a special genetic brand that would prevent the Nates from burning out their powers. However, most of the Nate Greys were dysfunctional and, when the Queen was unsatisfied with their performance, she killed them and moved on to the next. It is unknown how many Nate Greys fell prey to Queen Jean before she was stopped.

===Shaman===
Nate Grey came to the Earth-998 from his native reality, Earth-2098, which was sacrificed to restore Earth-998. The Red Queen wanted to use him as an ultimate weapon, but he was dangerously unstable, so she gave him a genetic insignia, to stabilize his powers. In the process of experimentation, his mind was damaged and he went mad. The Queen seemingly slew him, but he actually survived and escaped.

Becoming a Shaman, he built a hidden village where his &quot;tribe&quot;, the people who fought with the Queen, could live. At some point, his tribe had stolen and preserved the body of Forge, Queen&#x27;s best maker.

Eight years later, when Nate Grey from Earth-295 came to Earth-998, Shaman helped him escape from the Red Queen. He told X-Man that the Queen tried to use his powers, but failed, and began traveling to different realities, in search of the perfect weapon, a &quot;working Nate Grey&quot;. But in all realities she found only a &quot;defective&quot; Nate, until she met X-Man. Together both Nate&#x27;s went to a hidden village where, under the guidance of the Shaman, X-Man used his powers to talk with Forge, who told them the truth about the Queen. Immediately thereafter, the village was attacked by Mr. Scratch and the Black Knights. Scratch destroyed Forge&#x27;s body, paralyzed X-Man, and almost strangled Shaman while the Knights killed all the villagers. Shaman used his powers to stabilize X-Man&#x27;s power, gave him his X-Gene insignia and sent him home to Earth-616. Thinking it was Nate Grey from Earth-295, Scratch captured Shaman and took him to the Red Queen who, realizing the ruse, killed him.

===Nate Xavier===
On Earth-253 Nate Xavier was one of the three strongest people on the planet. Nate was a member of the team of heroes known as the People&#x27;s Protectorate. When Qabiri arrived on Earth-253 the team tried to stop him, but they all failed, Nate was killed by Qabiri, and the entire reality was destroyed.

===Earth-9806===
Nate Grey used his precognitive powers and saw a future, where he fought with Stryfe to death, and when he died his powers destroyed the half Earth.

===Earth-9997===
In the universe designated as Earth-9997 (Earth X), Nate Grey was eventually infected by the Techno-Organic Virus, and became Stryfe. He battled Cable, and died trying to protect Madelyne Pryor.

===What If?===
In the alternate Age of Apocalypse depicted in &quot;What If? X-Men Age of Apocalypse&quot;, both Xavier and Magneto were killed when Legion travelled back in time. Nate wasn&#x27;t created in a lab but was the natural son of Scott Summers and Jean Grey and grew up in a peaceful haven that mutants created for themselves in the Savage Land. Apocalypse rose to power and attacked this mutant community, declaring them traitors. Nate was the sole survivor and joined a band of heroes led by Captain America to end Apocalypse&#x27;s rule. This version of Nate was vengeful and ruthless and when the time came, he deemed that simply killing Apocalypse wasn&#x27;t enough. Betraying his teammates, Nate acquired the power to travel back in time and stop Legion&#x27;s initial attack himself. When Captain America attempted to stop him, disaster struck and in addition to Xavier, Magneto, and Legion, thousands of innocent civilians died, resulting in countless new alternate timelines that Apocalypse would also rule.

<doc id="733298" wikidata="Q1322006" url="?curid=733298" title="2004 Summer Olympics torch relay">
<text>The 2004 Summer Olympics Torch Relay took the Olympic Flame across every habitable continent, returning to Athens, Greece. Every city which had hosted, will host, or coincidentally elected to host the Summer Olympics until the 2028 Summer Olympics was visited or revisited by the torch, as well as several other cities chosen for their international importance. The main reason the torch relay went around the world was to highlight the fact that the Ancient Olympic Games started in Greece, and in modern times have been held around the world but finally took place again in Greece in 2004. 

The relay was the first time the Olympic flame had travelled to Africa and South America. The flame was transported from country to country aboard a specially equipped Boeing 747 leased from Atlanta Icelandic (Registration TF-ARO) called &quot;Zeus&quot;. On board the flame was carried and burned continuously in specially modified miners&#x27; lamps.

==Route in Greece (first phase)==
==International route==
The International Leg of the 2004 Olympic Torch Relay officially began on 4 June 2004, when the flame touched down in Sydney, Australia, previous host city of the 2000 Summer Olympics. In Sydney, it visited Stadium Australia, the 2000 Summer Olympics main venue, prior to the National Rugby League match between the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and Sydney Roosters; in Melbourne, it visited the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the 1956 Summer Olympics main venue, at half-time of the Australian Football League match between and .

===Route in Oceania===
===Route in Asia===
===Route in Africa===
===Route in Americas===
===Route in Europe (excluding Greece) ===
The International Leg of the 2004 Olympic Torch Relay concluded on July 8, 2004, just over a month after it began its global journey and just over a month before the 2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony on 13 August 2004.

==Route in Greece (second phase)==
After visiting Cyprus, the Greek Leg of the Torch Relay resumed on 9 July 2004, with the flame touching down in Crete in the city of Heraklion. During the Greek Leg of the relay, the torch also made a cursory stopover in Albania when the torch was carried through a lake on the Greek-Albanian border.
==Aftermath==
The International Olympic Committee has indicated that, due to the success of the 2004 run, they might sanction a global circumnavigation of the flame before every succeeding Olympics. However, those plans were abandoned in March 2009 due to the protests in the international leg of the torch relay of the 2008 Summer Olympics (with an exception made for the 2010 Youth Olympic Games).

<text>Dado Pršo (born 5 November 1974) is a Croatian former professional footballer who played as a forward.

Pršo played for seven different teams and made over 300 league appearances as a professional. He was included in the Monaco team that reached the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final, and part of the Rangers team that won the League and Cup double in 2005. Pršo received 32 caps for Croatia and was part of the squad at UEFA Euro 2004 and 2006 FIFA World Cup. He retired in June 2007 from the Scottish Premier League club Rangers.

Pršo acquired French nationality by marriage, thus he was not considered a foreigner at the end of his stay in Ligue 1. He was a coach for a youth team in Villefranche-sur-Mer.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in Zadar, Pršo began training with the local clubs NK Bagat and NK Zadar before moving to HNK Hajduk Split, at aged 12. He went through the ranks of Hajduk until, in 1991, a medical check allegedly revealed that he had an irregular heartbeat, prompting the team to release him, thinking he was therefore unfit for professional football. Pršo showed no traces of such a defect ever since though. When the Croatian league was formed he joined NK Pazinka, playing his only season at the top level of Croatian football at 18 years of age. In 1993, he moved to France to play for FC Rouen, and then moved to Saint Raphaël in 1995, where he worked as a car mechanic while he continued playing football.

===Monaco===
In 1996, then-AS Monaco manager Jean Tigana noticed Pršo and recruited the forward, although he would spend that season in the reserve side (alongside David Trezeguet), he was sent on loan to AC Ajaccio. In 1999–2000, he helped AS Monaco win the national championship. Pršo also helped them to the UEFA Champions League final in 2004. He is perhaps best remembered for his four goals in the 8–3 win over Deportivo La Coruña (a game which was played on his 29th birthday), which was the highest scoring Champions League scoreline. That night, he also equaled the competition record, joining Marco van Basten and Simone Inzaghi as the competition&#x27;s top scorer in a single match; this has since been surpassed by Lionel Messi, Luiz Adriano and Erling Haaland.

===Rangers===
In May 2004, Pršo signed for Scottish side Rangers on a free transfer. In his first season at the club he played 34 league matches, scoring 18 goals to help Rangers win the Scottish Premier League amid dramatic scenes in the final minutes on the last day of the season; he also won the Scottish League Cup. Departing Rangers manager Alex McLeish hailed Pršo as his &quot;best Rangers signing,&quot; at the end of the 2005–06 season.

Pršo remained a member of the 2006–07 Rangers team, despite announcing his retirement from international football. He suggested he would retire from club football on the expiration of his contract in 2007. Despite this, Pršo&#x27;s agent stated early in 2007 that he would like to continue playing for Rangers if his fitness allowed it, only to announce in February 2007 that his retirement was potentially imminent. Shortly afterwards, it was confirmed that Pršo could play on for a minimum of one season. But this comment proved to be premature as Pršo announced he would part company with Rangers at the end of the 2007 season due to his recurring knee problems. Pršo&#x27;s agent also stated that he would seek a transfer to a league where physical fitness was not as much of a requirement, rather than end his footballing career completely, and suggested North America and Asia as possible destinations.

At Pršo&#x27;s last game at Ibrox Stadium, he walked out after the final whistle wearing a brace on his leg due to damage to his ankle. He waved at the 50,000 fans who waited, and was then given the &quot;Guard of Honour&quot; by his teammates, led by Barry Ferguson before going back up the tunnel with tears in his eyes.

It was announced on 8 June 2007 that Rangers would release a DVD featuring highlights of Pršo&#x27;s three seasons at Ibrox, with a large amount of proceeds donated to the Rangers Charity Foundation.

==International career==
He made his debut for Croatia in a March 2003 European Championship qualification match against Belgium and earned a total of 32 caps, scoring 9 goals. Pršo was part of the Croatian team at UEFA Euro 2004 where he played in three games. Pršo is remembered in this tournament for the one goal he scored against France in Leiria on 17 June 2004. After scoring four goals during qualifying he was selected to represent his country at the 2006 FIFA World Cup. But he scored no goals during the tournament itself (where the team, as in 2004, was eliminated after the first round).

His final international was at that World Cup against Australia.

==Personal life==
Pršo comes from a family located in Obrovac, Zadar County. His nephew Milan Pršo has mostly played for FK Rad and represented the Serbian national youth team. According to Milan, Dado&#x27;s parents once lived in Bačka Topola, Serbia, but moved back to Zadar, Croatia.

Pršo and his wife Carol, who is French, have two children, Nicoline (born c. 1999) and Lorenzo (born 2001), who is also a footballer.

<doc id="733301" wikidata="Q1023655" url="?curid=733301" title="Salamá">
<text>Salamá is a city in Guatemala. It is the capital of the department of Baja Verapaz and it is situated at 940 m above sea level. The municipality of Salamá, for which the city of Salamá serves as the administrative centre, covers a total surface area of 764 km2 with a population of 65,275 inhabitants at the 2018 census.

==Etymology==
Salamá comes from Kʼicheʼ &quot;Tz&#x27;alam Ha&quot; meaning table on water.

==History==

Salamá was settled as a doctrine by the Order of Preachers in the 1550s, as part of the Tezulutlán Capitulations that friar Bartolomé de las Casas lobbied from the Crown. The friars had thousands of acres with hills, forest, a section of the plain and abundant water supply. Both location and weather were ideal for vines; the characteristic soil and dried grass from the rest of the plain was replaced by vines thanks to a superb irrigation system the friars built inspired by the Romans.

After independence in 1821, the Central Ameran liberal criollos tried to remove the Catholic Church from power, along with the Guatemalan aristocrats of the . By 1829, the liberal forces of general Francisco Morazán expelled both the aristocrats and the regular orders from Central America, including the Order of Preachers, one of the richest. In Salamá, they had to leave behind their monastery, church and vines, which were confiscated by the Guatemalan State government, but remained abandoned due to the political turmoil of the times.

=== Battle of Salamá of 1839 ===


In early 1838, Morazán&#x27;s liberal forces were back in Guatemala after a peasant revolt ousted Guatemalan governor Mariano Gálvez. Morazán and his Guatemalan ally José Francisco Barrundia invaded Guatemalan soil and when they arrived in San Sur, they summarily executed Chúa Álvarez, general Rafael Carrera&#x27;s father-in-law, because Carrera was the leader of the revolt. Morazán&#x27;s soldiers placed Álvarez&#x27; head on top of a spike as a warning to Carrera&#x27;s followers. Upon learning the news, both Carrera and his wife, Petrona Álvarez – who had left Guatemala City to face Morazán and were in Mataquescuintla – promised to avenge Chúan even after Morazán&#x27;s death. The liberals sent several envoys to try to meet with Carrera, but he did not want to talk to them –especially not to Barrundia, who was told that he should not try to come in to talk to Carrera if he wanted to remain alive. After this, Morazán began a strong offensive, destroying every single town in his path, stealing the few belongings and forcing Carrera militants to hide in the mountains.

Thinking that Carrera was completely defeated, Morazán and Barrundia went on to Guatemala City, where governor Valenzuela and the conservative criollos of the Aycinena family celebrated finally having a leader like Morazán, who had defeated Carrera and his peasant revolt once and for all. The Guatemalans offered to sponsor any campaign that Morazán wanted at that point. Morazán helped Los Altos and appointed Mariano Rivera Paz, who was close to the Aycinena family; however he did not return to the former aristocrats any of their confiscated possessions. In return, Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol, leader of the family, voted in favor of dissolving the Central American Federation, thus forcing Morazán to return to El Salvador to try to save what was left of his presidential powers. On his way to El Salvador, he increased repression, on anybody suspect of helping Carrera in the past.

Knowing that Morazán was on his way to El Salvador, Carrera tried to take Salamá with the little forces that he still had left, but was defeated and even lost his brother Laureano in the battle. With only a handful of men he was able to escape, badly wounded, to Sanarate. After a halfway recovery, Carrera had a few more battles where he won, but suffered considerable casualties.

Finally, the liberal forces captured Carrera, but could not shoot him, because the Central American Federation was in turmoil and they needed the caudillo to keep the peasants in check. Morazán was forced to appoint him as commander in Mita. Morazán would come to regret that decision, as Carrera would eventually defeat him in 1840, finishing the Honduran general run as the main political figure of Central America.

As of 1850, the population was estimated to be 4,500.

=== Miguel Enríquez and president Barillas in 1892 ===

In 1892, president general Manuel Barillas called an election. It was the first time a Guatemalan president had become tired of the office and it was also the first election in Guatemala that allowed the candidates to run propaganda in the local newspapers. Among the candidates who ran for office were:

* Lorenzo Montúfar y Rivera: a well known a respected liberal intellectual. He was the only one of all candidates who made an engraving of his portrait to publish it in the newspapers and was accused of wasting resources for doing this.
* General José María Reina Barrios: nephew of former president Justo Rufino Barrios and eventual winner.
* Miguel Enríquez: a Salamá landowner. Enríquez had been a liberal, but became a conservative after the persecution that he suffered from the Barillas administration.

Barillas was unique among all liberal presidents of Guatemala between 1871 and 1944: he handed over power to his successor peacefully. When election time approached, he sent for the three Liberal candidates to ask them what their government plan would be. Satisfied with the response of Reyna Barrios, Barillas made sure a huge column of Quetzaltenango and Totonicapán Indigenous people came down from the mountains to vote for the general. The official agents did their job: Reyna was elected president and, so as not to offend the losing candidates, Barillas gave them checks to cover the costs of their presidential campaigns. Reyna Barrios of course received nothing, but he went on to become President on March 15, 1892.

Only Enríquez was not compensated; on the contrary, after the elections he had to run away from his farmland in Salamá after being accused of sedition; he was captured and executed near Zacapa.

=== Miguel Ángel Asturias in Salamá ===
In 1904, the father of future Literature Nobel Prize awardee Miguel Ángel Asturias, who was a judge, freed several students that had been detained after rioting. In consequence president Manuel Estrada Cabrera, and removed him from his post. In 1905, the family was forced to move to Salamá, where Miguel Ángel Asturias lived on his grandparents&#x27; farm and came in contact with Guatemalan natives for the first time. His nanny, Lola Reyes, was a native girl who told him stories, myths and legends from her culture which eventually would impact heavily in his work. In 1908, when Asturias was nine years old, his family returned to Guatemala City.

=== Anticommunist rebellion in 1953 ===


During the revolutionary government of colonel Jacobo Árbenz, the opposition – mainly formed by Guatemalan landlords and United Fruit Company executives – was completely against any reform that the government of Juan José Arévalo had established: social security, creation of commercial and public labor unions, democracy and freedom of press, among others. At the election of Árbenz in 1950, the Guatemalan elite was desperate, but most of its members hoped that the new president would back out of the policies of his predecessor, whom they accused of communism. Árbenz&#x27; image convinced them of that: the Guatemalan colonel was married to María Cristina Vilanova, a lady from the Salvadorian elite. He was an Army officer, lived in a mansion in zone 10 in Guatemala City and had the proper aristocratic presence. But their hopes were shattered when Árbenz supported the formation of the Guatemalan Communist Party and then pushed for aggressive agrarian reform. Confronted with the situation, the opposition had only one clear goal: to defend the privileges that they had enjoyed in Guatemala for generations and so they embraced anticommunism to justify their fight against the government. On the other hand, the middle class enjoyed benefits that allowed them to prosper and they were loyal to Árbenz. The peasants were for the first time since the Rafael Carrera government treated with respect and dignity.

This was the political and economic situation of the country when on 29 March 1953 the anticommunist opposition assaulted Salamá at dawn: approximately 100 rebels invaded Salamá and neighboring San Jerónimo. The invasion was not properly organized and by 6:00 a.m. was completedly defeated by army forces that arrived from Cobán. This event however began government prosecution of anticommunist elements, which gradually escalated until it became pure repression in May 1954, when CIA Operation PBSuccess and the Carlos Castillo Armas invasion were well in progress and the Arbenz regime was practically doomed.

<doc id="733303" wikidata="Q3221546" url="?curid=733303" title="The Rivan Codex">
<text>The Rivan Codex is a collection of background material to the Belgariad and Malloreon fantasy saga by David and Leigh Eddings. It consists of two bodies of material used in writing the novels, one for each series, with three informal essays by David Eddings. &quot;Belgarath the Sorcerer&quot; and &quot;Polgara the Sorceress&quot; do not have dedicated sections, but are referred to in the Eddingses&#x27; discussions, and drew on the material of the first ten books. In particular, one text presented in the background to the Belgariad forms the basis for the first chapter of &quot;Belgarath the Sorcerer&quot;.

The Rivan Codex also contains the holy writings of the various religions in the world and the economic diversities of the different countries. It starts off with a creation story where each god takes a people and then goes into their specific money, religion, economy method, trade relations, weights/measures, etc.

One of the essays also lists the following formula for epic fantasy:
# The Underlying Theology (Polytheistic/Monotheistic/Buddhist/Other)
# The Quest (object of the hero&#x27;s existence, reason for the group)
# The Magic Talisman (Holy Grail/One Ring/Magic Sword/Jewel)
# The Hero: Galahad the Pure, Gawain the Brave, Percival the Dumb (Naive), or Lancelot the Heavyweight Champion of the World.
# The Resident Wizard (Gandalf, Merlin, Belgarath)
# The Heroine (Ce&#x27;Nedra)
# The Villain, usually with some diabolical agenda (Torak)
# The Companions (generally a multicultural crew who can protect the hero until he defeats the villain)
# The Romantic Interests for 8.(NB: both 8&amp;9 must be well-rounded groups, with individualized personalities and flaws)
# The kings, queens, emperors, generals, courtiers, and such, who make up the governments of the world.</text><links>

<doc id="733305" wikidata="Q588367" url="?curid=733305" title="Cortistatin (neuropeptide)">
<text>Precortistatin is a protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;CORT&quot; gene. The 105 amino acid residue human precortistatin in turn is cleaved into cortistatin-17 and cortistatin-29. Cortistatin-17 is the only active peptide derived from the precursor. Cortistatin (or more specifically cortistatin-17) is a neuropeptide that is expressed in inhibitory neurons of the cerebral cortex, and which has a strong structural similarity to somatostatin. Unlike somatostatin, when infused into the brain, it enhances slow-wave sleep. It binds to sites in the cortex, hippocampus and the amygdala.

== Function ==

Cortistatin is a neuropeptide with strong structural similarity to somatostatin (both peptides belong to the same family). It binds to all known somatostatin receptors, and shares many pharmacological and functional properties with somatostatin, including the depression of neuronal activity. However, it also has many properties distinct from somatostatin, such as induction of slow-wave sleep, apparently by antagonism of the excitatory effects of acetylcholine on the cortex, reduction of locomotor activity, and activation of cation selective currents not responsive to somatostatin.

<doc id="733309" wikidata="Q15088261" url="?curid=733309" title="Daniel Knox, 6th Earl of Ranfurly">
<text>Thomas Daniel Knox, 6th Earl of Ranfurly, (29 May 1914 – 6 November 1988), known as Dan Ranfurly, was a British Army officer and farmer, who served as Governor of the Bahamas. His exploits in the Second World War, along with those of his wife, Hermione, and his valet, Whitaker, were chronicled in his wife&#x27;s memoirs from the time, &quot;To War With Whitaker: The Wartime Diaries of the Countess of Ranfurly, 1939–1945&quot;.

==Background==
Lord Ranfurly was born, patrilineally, into an Ulster-Scots aristocratic family and was the son of Captain Thomas Uchter Caulfield Knox, Viscount Northland, and succeeded his grandfather, The 5th Earl of Ranfurly, in the earldom in October 1933. He was educated at Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned into the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry in 1936. He and his wife met in 1937 when he was an aide-de-camp to Lord Gowrie, the Governor-General of Australia, an appointment Ranfurly held from 1936 to 1938. Two years later, both aged 25, they returned to Britain and were married. They later had a daughter, Caroline.

==Action in World War II==
On the outbreak of the Second World War, Second Lieutenant Lord (Dan) Ranfurly of the Nottinghamshire Yeomanry (Sherwood Rangers) – 1st Cavalry Division was initially posted to British-controlled Palestine, thence to join with the 7th Division in Egypt. His wife, violating multiple British Army protocols forbidding the wives of soldiers at the front, repeatedly hatched schemes to join him as he was shuffled across the Middle East and North Africa, finally succeeding to meet up with him in Cairo in 1941.

Soon after, Ranfurly, who had been appointed as ADC to Lt. Gen. Philip Neame, was captured with Neame in the Cyrenaica desert between Derna and Mechili on 6 April 1941. He was taken to Sulmona camp in the Abruzzo near Rome, but joined Neame again when they were both transferred to Castello di Vincigliata PG12 in October 1941. He was amongst many distinguished British officers, including generals Richard O&#x27;Connor and Adrian Carton de Wiart. He became friends with Carton De Wiart, and adapted to prison life, managing the officers&#x27; house-keeping and Red Cross parcels. As de Wiart wrote, &#x27;He was our most expert gambler, did me the good turn of teaching me to play backgammon.&#x27; Boyd&#x27;s ADC Flt. Lt. Leeming wrote &#x27;Four more prisoners arrived ..including Lieutenant Lord Ranfurly, who took over the management of the household in my place. He helped with the tunnel escape. &#x27;Air Marshal Owen Tudor Boyd and Ranfurly made a cover for our hole from the lift shaft to the chapel, and Ranfurly plastered it over and it was never detected&#x27;.

He was amongst the small party including some NCOs released by General Chiappe in September 1943 after the Italian Armistice. They were driven to Firenze Campo di Marte railway station from where a special train took them to Arezzo. The party eventually dispersed and spent many months with the partisans in the Apennines. He, together with Rudolph Vaughan, John Combe, Ted Todhunter and Guy Ruggles-Brise (who was an old school friend) from Vincigliata. Two young officers, American pilot Jack Reiter (who had been shot down over Italy, escaped from a military hospital to join the partisans), American diplomat Walter Orebaugh, together with John Kerin, an Irish Sapper, who they had picked up along the way, managed to reach the coast. After further delays, they put out to sea in a boat, which began to leak badly. After rowing and bailing for 24 hours they were at last picked up by an Italian vessel which landed them at Ancona, from where they were shipped to brigade HQ on 30 May 1944. Lady Ranfurly records this incident in her book of memoirs, &quot;To War with Whittaker&quot;.

==Post-war==
Following the end of World War II, Lord Ranfurly worked briefly in insurance at Lloyd&#x27;s of London, not long before being appointed Governor of the Bahamas by Winston Churchill. Ranfurly assumed office on 21 December 1953. While in the Bahamas, he and his wife began the Ranfurly Library Service in Nassau.

After they returned to England in 1957, Lady Ranfurly continued to ship books to parts of the world short on libraries, founding an organisation now known as Book Aid International. Lord Ranfurly, meanwhile, took up farming at his Buckinghamshire estate.

<text>Swift water rescue (also called &quot;white water rescue&quot;) is a subset of technical rescue dealing in white water river conditions. Due to the added pressure of moving water, swift water rescue involves the use of specially trained personnel, ropes and mechanical advantage systems that are often much more robust than those used in standard rope rescue. The main goal is to use or deflect the water’s power to assist in the rescue of the endangered person(s), as in most situations there is no easy way to overcome the power of the water.

==Rescue operations==
As a swift water rescue scene evolves, the Incident Command System (ICS) will emerge. ICS is a national used for managing emergencies in the United States. Initially created by Jim Segerstrom and Michael Croslin co-founders of Rescue 3, Sonora California as a response to all the firefighters who were dying in water rescues], SRT has now been taught to over 200,000 rescue personnel in some 2 dozen countries. ICS has become the benchmark by which all disasters are managed in the United States. &quot;ICS is based upon a flexible, scalable response organization providing a common framework within which people can work together effectively. These people may be drawn from multiple agencies that do not routinely work together, and ICS is designed to give standard response and operation procedures to reduce the problems and potential for miscommunication on such incidents.&quot; All rescue operations demand vigilance with regards to safety. ICS provides that a Safety Officer be present to monitor and address all safety issues. One of these issues pertains to the incident scene.
=== Zones of operation ===
The immediate area of operations at the incident is divided into three zones of operation: &quot;Cold&quot;, &quot;Warm&quot;, and &quot;Hot&quot;. Certain requirements regarding training and personal protective equipment (PPE) exist for personnel operating within these three zones. The Cold Zone is considered to be anything greater than from the water&#x27;s edge. Awareness Level personnel shall approach no closer than the Cold zone. The Warm Zone begins 15 feet from the water&#x27;s edge, and ends at the water&#x27;s edge. Personnel operating in the Warm Zone shall be trained to the Operations Level, and must wear a properly fitted and secured personal flotation device (PFD). The Hot Zone refers to any and all activities taking place in the water. These activities shall be performed by personnel trained to the Technician Level, provided they are wearing a properly fitted and secured personal flotation device.

=== Risk algorithm ===
In order to provide for the safety of both the rescuer and victim, a low to high risk algorithm has evolved for the implementation of various rescue methods in Swift Water Rescue. Under times of stress, the implementation of this algorithm helps to prevent a rescuer from endangering himself and the victim, thus providing a sound, step-by-step approach when effecting a rescue. As the algorithm progresses, the danger and threat to rescuer and victim increase. The algorithm is, &quot;Talk&quot;, &quot;Reach&quot;, &quot;Wade&quot;, &quot;Throw&quot;, &quot;Helo&quot;, &quot;Row&quot;, &quot;Go&quot;, and &quot;Tow&quot; (this has been changed due to the increased safety of helicopter operations and the increased deaths of rescuers in boats). While it is safest to talk a victim into performing a self-rescue, there exists a substantial increase in danger once a rescuer enters the water. &quot;Talk&quot; refers to the dialogue that takes place between the rescuer and victim, and includes the rescuer directing the victim in methods of self-rescue, such as swimming to shore. If unsuccessful, the rescuer will attempt to &quot;Reach&quot; with an object, such as a tree branch, paddle, or pole, to the victim, so that the victim can be pulled to safety.
=== Laminar flow ===
Since the laminar flow of a moving body of water carves the path of movement, it experiences friction caused by resistance along the shallows and outer or higher banks, and travels at a slower speed at the edges than the center. Therefore, a rescuer often has the opportunity to wade along the banks of a moving body of water to more easily &quot;talk&quot; to, or &quot;reach&quot; the victim. 80% of moving water rescues are effected using throw bags and other throw devices. A rescuer can &quot;throw&quot; a throw bag or other throw device from a boat, stable platform, or dry land, or may elect to wade into the shallows and then initiate a throw. &quot;Row&quot; includes, but is not limited to, all forms of boat-based operations. This includes a boat on a highline Tyrolean with a midpoint drop and two- and four-5point boat on tether systems.

=== Live bait rescue ===
In certain situations, such as an unconscious patient, one might &quot;go and tow&quot; the victim back to shore. Unlike other methods of rescue, the rescuer now enters the water in a swimming capacity. This method of rescue is also referred to as a &quot;live bait rescue&quot;, where the rescuer swims to the aid of the victim while tethered to a team member at an anchor point, very much like bait on a hook at the end of a fishing pole. For example, a parent with children trapped in a vehicle in flowing water that needs to extricate and control scared or injured children on to the roof of the vehicle (there is a greater than 50% chance of dying in a vehicle that is flooded). If that platform (car, rock, bridge, roof etc.) becomes unstable or begins to succumb to rising water, that rescuer may need to tow a victim to the shore, eddy or pre-planned egress point. Towing rescues are extremely difficult and require training with a practiced rescuer as a victim. Actual tows with scared, hypothermic, exhausted, injured or panicked victims are extremely difficult and dangerous for both parties and should be left to rescuers well versed in proper rescuer/victim communication, holds, and swimming techniques. When a victim is not accessible from any of the previous rescue methods, resources permitting, a helicopter rescue may be attempted. A helicopter, or &quot;helo&quot;, is a stable rescue platform from which a variety of rescue methods can be initiated. While the helicopter must be equipped for rescue work, the crew must be equipped, trained and well practiced in the art of swift water rescue

==Equipment==
==NFPA standards==

In the US and Canada, surface water and swift water rescue is covered under National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1006 Standard for Technical Rescuer Professional Qualifications, 2008 Edition. This standard contains two separate chapters that define the required knowledge, skills and abilities for surface water rescue (Chapter 11) and swift water rescue (Chapter 12). The use of the terms Awareness, Operational and Technician have been replaced by two levels of qualification: Level I and Level II.

According to page 12 of NFPA 1006:
* 3.3.215.1 Level I Technical Rescuer: This level applies to individuals who identify hazards, use equipment, and apply limited techniques specified in this standard to perform technical rescue operations.
* 3.3.215.2 Level II Technical Rescuer: This level applies to individuals who identify hazards, use equipment, and apply advanced techniques specified in this standard to perform technical rescue operations.

===Specialized ratings===
Additionally there are more specialised ratings such as:
* &quot;White water Rescue Technician for the River Professional&quot;: For swift water/white water professionals, for whom rescue scenarios may be encountered on a daily basis;
* &quot;Dive Rescue - NFPA 1006, Chapter 13&quot;: Provides Level I and Level II standards for technical rescuers working underwater;
* &quot;Ice Rescue - NFPA 1006, Chapter 14&quot;: Provides Level I and Level II standards for technical rescuers working water incidents also involving ice;
* &quot;Surf Rescue - NFPA 1006, Chapter 15&quot;: Provides Level I and Level II standards for technical rescuers working in tidal or ocean water&#x27;
* &quot;Motorized Boat Operations&quot;: Teaches specialized boat handling and operation for rescue personnel and includes flood hazards and swift water maneuvering.

<doc id="733312" wikidata="Q842266" url="?curid=733312" title="Huehuetenango Department">
<text>Huehuetenango is one of the 22 departments of Guatemala. It is located in the western highlands and shares the borders with the Mexican state of Chiapas in the north and west; with El Quiché in the east, and Totonicapán, Quetzaltenango and San Marcos in the south. The capital is the city of Huehuetenango.

Huehuetenango&#x27;s ethnic composition is one of the most diverse in Guatemala. While the Mam are predominant in the department, other Maya groups are the Q&#x27;anjob&#x27;al, Chuj, Jakaltek, Tektik, Awakatek, Chalchitek, Akatek and K&#x27;iche&#x27;. Each of these nine Maya ethnic groups speaks its own language.

==Name==
The department of Huehuetenango takes its name from the city of the same name which serves as the departmental capital. The name derives from the Nahuatl language of central Mexico, given by the indigenous allies of the Spanish conquistadors during the Spanish Conquest of Guatemala. It is usually said to mean &quot;place of the elders&quot;, but it may also mean a &quot;place of the &quot;ahuehuete&quot; trees&quot;.

==Geography==

Huehuetenango covers an area of in western Guatemala and is bordered on the north and west by Mexico. On the east side it is bordered by the department of El Quiché and on the south by the departments of Totonicapán, Quetzaltenango and San Marcos. The department encompasses almost the entire length of the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes mountain range, although there is a wide difference in altitude across the department, from heights of above mean sea level to as low as above sea level, encompassing an equally wide variation in local climate, ranging from mountain peaks where the temperature sometimes falls below freezing to tropical lowland rainforest.

The department possesses various rivers that flow into the Chixoy River, also known as the Río Negro, which flows into the system of rivers forming the drainage basin of the Usumacinta River, which empties into the Gulf of Mexico. The most important tributaries of the Chixoy in Huehuetenango are the Hondo and Xecunabaj rivers, which flow into the department from the neighbouring departments of El Quiché and Totonicapán.

The Cuilco River enters the department from neighbouring San Marcos and crosses into the Mexican state of Chiapas, where it joins with the Grijalva River, which empties into the Gulf of Mexico. Its most important tributaries in Huehuetenango are the Apal, Chomá and Coxtón rivers.

The Ixcán River has its source near Santa Cruz Barillas and flows northwards towards Mexico where it joins the Lacuntún River, a tributary of the Usumacinta.

The Nentón River is formed in the municipality of San Sebastián Coatán by the joining of the rivers Nupxuptenam and Jajaniguán. It flows westwards across the border into Mexico where it empties into the Presa de la Angostura reservoir.

The Selegua River has its source in the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes and flows northwards, crossing the border into Chiapas, where it joins the Cuilco River to form the Grijalva River, to flow onwards to the Gulf of Mexico. Its principal tributaries are the Pino, Sibilá, Ocubilá, Naranjo, Colorado, Torlón, Mapá and Chicol rivers.

The largest body of standing water in the department is Laguna Yolnabaj, in the extreme north, close to the border with Mexico. Smaller lakes include Laguna Maxbal, Laguna Yolhuitz, and Laguna Seca, all in the northeast of the department.

==Population==

In 2018 the department was recorded as having 1,170,669 inhabitants. Over 70% of the population are estimated to be living in poverty, with 22% living in extreme poverty and are unable to meet basic necessities. The majority of the population (variously estimated at 64–75%) belongs to indigenous Maya groups with the remainder being Spanish-speaking Ladinos. The Ladinos tend to be concentrated in towns and villages including Huehuetenango, Cuilco, Chiantla, Malacatancito, La Libertad, San Antonio Huista and La Democracia, which have a relatively low indigenous population. In the rest of the department, the Maya groups make up the majority of the population as much in the towns as the countryside. Huehuetenango has the greatest number of Mam Maya in Guatemala, although there are also Mam speakers in the departments of Quetzaltenango and San Marcos, and in the Mexican state of Chiapas.

In 2008, 58% of the population of the department was aged 19 years or younger.

==History==

===Early history===

The area had been occupied by the Maya civilization since at least the Mesoamerican Early Classic Period. At the time of the Spanish Conquest, the Maya city of Zaculeu was the initial focus of Spanish attention in the region that would later become the department of Huehuetenango. The city was defended by the Mam king Kayb&#x27;il B&#x27;alam; in 1525 it was attacked by Gonzalo de Alvarado y Chávez, cousin of Conquistador Pedro de Alvarado. After a siege lasting several months the Mam were reduced to starvation and Kayb&#x27;il B&#x27;alam finally surrendered the city to the Spanish.

Four years after the Spanish conquest of Huehuetenango, in 1529, San Mateo Ixtatán, Santa Eulalia and Jacaltenango were given in &quot;encomienda&quot; to the conquistador Gonzalo de Ovalle, a companion of Pedro de Alvarado. In 1684, a council led by Enrique Enriquez de Guzmán, then governor of Guatemala, decided upon the reduction of San Mateo Ixtatán and nearby Santa Eulalia, both within the colonial administrative district of the Corregimiento of Huehuetenango.

On 2 February 1838, Huehuetenango joined with Quetzaltenango, El Quiché, Retalhuleu, San Marcos and Totonicapán to form the short-lived Central American state of Los Altos. The state was crushed in 1840 by general Rafael Carrera Turcios, at that time between periods in office as Guatemalan president.

Huehuetenango includes pre-Columbian Maya archaeological sites at Zaculeu, Chalchitán, Mojá and San Mateo Ixtatán.

===Departmental history===
The department of Huehuetenango was created by the presidential decree of Vicente Cerna Sandoval on 8 May 1866, although various attempts had been made to declare the district a department from 1826 onwards in order to better administer it.

By 1883, Huehuetenango had 248 coffee plantations and produced 7334 quintals (Imperial hundredweight) of coffee.

In 1887, a rebellion in Huehuetenango was put down by president Manuel Lisandro Barillas, who then suspended the constitutional guarantees of the department and redrafted its constitution.

==Economy and agriculture==

During the 17th and 18th centuries, namely during the Spanish Colonial period, the main industries were mining and livestock production, which was run by Spaniards. In modern times agriculture is the most important industry, although mining continues on a small scale and handicraft production also contributes to the local economy. Maize is cultivated across the whole department, without being limited by local climatic differences. The primary highland crops are wheat, potatoes, barley, alfalfa and beans. On the warmer lower slopes the primary crops are coffee, sugarcane, tobacco, chili, yuca, achiote and a wide range of fruits.

Although historically cattle and horse farming were important, the size of production is much reduced in modern times, with the rearing of sheep, which is now more widespread. Mines in Huehuetenango produce silver, lead, zinc and copper. Gold was once mined in the department but it is no longer extracted. In 2000, the private mining company Minas de Guatemala S.A. was extracting antimony from underground mines near San Ildefonso Ixtahuacán.

Local handicraft production mainly consists of weaving traditional Maya textiles, mostly cotton but also wool, depending on the local climate.

In 2008 the most exported product was coffee.

== Municipalities ==
The department of Huehuetenango includes 31 municipalities:

==People of note==
Former president of Guatemala Efraín Ríos Montt was born in Huehuetenango city on 16 June 1926.

==Tourism==

The main tourist attractions in the department include the source of the San Juan River and the restored Maya ruins of Zaculeu. The town of Chiantla is a centre for religious tourism, with the Catholic Church being a pilgrimage destination due to its image of the Virgin of Candelaria, known locally as &quot;Nuestra Señora de Chiantla&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of Chiantla&quot;).

<text>Huehuetenango () is a city and municipality in the highlands of western Guatemala. It is also the capital of the department of Huehuetenango. The city is situated from Guatemala City, and is the last departmental capital on the Pan-American Highway before the Mexican border at La Mesilla. Its primary export is coffee.

==Overview==

Huehuetenango (originally called &quot;Xinabajul&quot; in the Mam language) was already a Maya settlement before the Spanish conquest of the fortified city of Zaculeu, which was the Pre-Columbian capital of the Mam kingdom situated just a few kilometers from Xinabahul. &#x27;Huehuetenango&#x27; means &quot;place of the ancients (or ancestors)&quot; in Nahuatl, which is the name Gonzalo de Alvarado adopted from his Nahua allies when Zaculeu and Xinabahul were conquered.

Many people of Mam descent still live in and around Huehuetenango, and the nearby ruins of Zaculeu have become a tourist attraction. The ruins are markedly distinct from other Maya archeological sites; the original unearthed stones, comprising only a small portion of the original structures, were coated with plaster during restoration works carried out in the 1940s. There is also a small museum at Zaculeu that includes statues and small artifacts found on the site.

Huehuetenango Airport is within the city and has a paved runway and a small terminal building. There are currently no scheduled airline flights.

==Climate==
The city has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwb&quot;), with warm summers and mild winters.

==Sports==
The city currently boasts one Guatemalan top level football side Xinabajul in the Liga Nacional de Fútbol de Guatemala.

==Notable people==
Former president Efraín Ríos Montt was born in Huehuetenango (in 1926). His younger brother, Mario Enrique Ríos Montt the emeritus auxiliary bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Guatemala in 1932.

<doc id="733314" wikidata="Q276544" url="?curid=733314" title="Igor Tudor">
<text>Igor Tudor (born 16 April 1978) is a Croatian professional football manager and former player who last managed Serie A club Lazio.

Capable of playing either as a defender or defensive midfielder, Tudor spent most of his playing career at Juventus, winning several trophies during that time. He was a part of the Croatia national team at UEFA Euro 2004, the 2006 and 1998 World Cup, but missed the 2002 World Cup due to injury. Tudor announced his retirement on 22 July 2008 at age 30, after problems with his right ankle reappeared. He spent his final season playing for his youth club, Hajduk Split.

As manager, Tudor took charge of Hajduk from 2013 to 2015, and spent eight months with PAOK in the 2015–16 season. In Turkey, he managed Karabükspor from 2016 to 2017, and Galatasaray in 2017. From April to June 2018, Tudor managed Serie A side Udinese and in that time, saved the club from relegation to Serie B. In March 2019, he came back to Udinese. After he returned to Hajduk in January 2020, Andrea Pirlo invited Tudor to join his coaching staff at Juventus in August 2020, which offer Tudor accepted. He became manager of Marseille in 2022 before leaving the club after one season in 2023. In March 2024, he returned to Serie A and was appointed as manager of Lazio.

==Club career==
===Early years===
Tudor started his professional career at Hajduk Split in 1995 scoring five goals in 58 matches, being considered a revelation for his technique and ball control above the average of a defender.

===Juventus===
After three personally successful seasons at Hajduk, he was noticed and acquired by Italian giants Juventus in 1998. During his time with Juventus, he won the Croatian Player of the Year award in 2002. During his eight-year spell with the club, Tudor was in excellent form, despite injuries, and formed impressive defensive partnerships with the likes of Paolo Montero, Mark Iuliano, Gianluca Pessotto, Lilian Thuram, Ciro Ferrara, Alessandro Birindelli, Nicola Legrottaglie, Gianluca Zambrotta, Jonathan Zebina, Giorgio Chiellini and Fabio Cannavaro.

During the 2000–01 season under Carlo Ancelotti, Tudor had a prolific year, scoring six goals. The following season, with the return of his former Juventus coach Marcello Lippi, he was occasionally deployed as a midfielder, scoring four crucial goals (one against Torino in the Turin derby, two goals in Juventus&#x27; comebacks against Chievo and Hellas Verona and one during the match against title contenders Internazionale) in Juventus&#x27;s successful Serie A title campaign. The following season, he also scored a notable goal against Deportivo de La Coruña in the last minute of a second round match of the 2002–03 Champions League, allowing the club to progress to the quarter finals of the competition, en route to the final, in which they were defeated by Italian rivals Milan on penalties.

During this period, Juventus had one of the strongest teams in the world, and Tudor contributed well, with over 150 total appearances for the club, scoring nearly 20 goals, as a centreback. After a major injury in 2004, however, Tudor was loaned out to Siena in January 2005 after seven seasons with Juve. Following the revocation of Juventus&#x27; 2004–05 and 2005–06 Serie A titles due to their involvement in the &quot;Calciopoli&quot; scandal, as well as the expiration of his loan contract with Siena, Tudor returned to Juventus, staying with the club despite their relegation to Serie B, but injuries kept him off the pitch for the whole season. His contract expired on 30 June 2007.

During his time at the club, Tudor won two Serie A titles, two Italian Supercups, a Serie B title and a UEFA Intertoto Cup, also reaching the final of the 2001–02 Coppa Italia and 2002–03 Champions League.

===Return to Hajduk===
Constantly struggling with injuries and mysterious bacterial infection of his ankle, Tudor was almost forced to end his career in 2007, but in June 2007 he decided to join his former club Hajduk Split after not renewing his contract with Juventus. After a highly cautious rehabilitation process his comeback was in the match against Zadar on 20 October 2007. This was his first official match in over 16 months. However, he was unable to reach his previous form and his ankle injury problems continued. On 22 July 2008, at the age of 30, he announced his early retirement due to his recurring ankle injury problems.

==International career==
Tudor played for the Croatia national team between 1997 and 2006. He also won several international caps for the Croatian under-17, under-19 and under-21 national teams between 1993 and 2000.

Tudor made his debut in Croatia&#x27;s final match of the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifying, a 1–1 draw at Ukraine on 15 November 1997, coming on as a substitute for Aljoša Asanović in the 89th minute. He was subsequently part of the Croatian squad that finished third at the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. At the tournament, he made three appearances as a substitute in the closing stages of Croatia&#x27;s games against Japan, Romania and the Netherlands.

After the 1998 World Cup, he made four appearances in the Croatian national team&#x27;s unsuccessful qualifying campaign for UEFA Euro 2000, being in the starting line-up on all four occasions. He also appeared in six matches during Croatia&#x27;s qualifying campaign for the 2002 World Cup, but missed the final tournament in South Korea and Japan due to an injury.

He returned to the national team during the qualifying stages for Euro 2004, appearing in seven qualifying matches. At the finals in Portugal, he appeared in two of Croatia&#x27;s three group matches. In his first appearance at the tournament, a 2–2 draw against France, he scored an own goal to put the French side 1–0 up midway through the first half. His second appearance at the tournament came in Croatia&#x27;s final group match against England, where he scored Croatia&#x27;s second goal to keep their hopes alive after they found themselves 3–1 down in the second half. Frank Lampard, however, soon netted England&#x27;s fourth goal and Croatia were knocked out of the tournament in the group stage.

Tudor was also included in Croatia&#x27;s 23-man squad for the 2006 World Cup finals in Germany, having appeared in eight qualifying matches for the tournament, scoring two goals. He recorded his first goal of the qualifying when he scored Croatia&#x27;s final goal in their 3–0 win at home to Malta on 30 March 2005. His second goal of the competition came in Croatia&#x27;s 3–1 win at Bulgaria on 4 June 2005, when he put Croatia 2–0 up just over half an hour from time. At the 2006 World Cup finals, he started all of Croatia&#x27;s three group matches and played the full 90 minutes in two of them. Croatia, however, were eliminated from the tournament after a 2–2 draw against Australia in their final group match, with Tudor receiving his second yellow card of the tournament for complaining about the penalty kick from which Australia scored a 1–1 equaliser. He made no further appearances for the national team following the tournament.

He earned a total of 55 caps, scoring 3 goals.

==Style of play==
Tudor was considered one of Croatia&#x27;s best defenders in the period between the late 1990s and mid-2000s. Tudor was a large, hard-working, strong and imposing defender who excelled in the air, making him a dangerous goal threat during set pieces.

He was also a tight man-marker and a hard tackling defender, with great tactical intelligence. Although primarily a central defender, he was capable of playing anywhere along the back line and even as a defensive midfielder, which was made possible due to his tactical versatility, stamina, and his surprisingly capable technical skills, ball control and distribution for such a large and physical player.

Despite his talent, he was also prone to injuries, which is often thought to have affected his playing career.

==Managerial career==
===Hajduk Split===
Tudor was hired by Hajduk Split in August 2009 to be the assistant manager to Edoardo Reja who then took charge of the Croatian giant. Tudor dramatically increased his managerial knowledge during the seven months he spent watching and learning from Reja. In February 2010, Reja took charge of Lazio and because of that Tudor was fired from Hajduk; he did not join Reja in Italy.

In December 2012, Tudor was appointed by Hajduk&#x27;s sporting director Sergije Krešić as the new Hajduk U-17 manager. After taking charge of the U-17 squad, he went to spend some time at the Juventus Center in order to improve his managerial skills with Antonio Conte. During his time with the U-17 squad, he managed to teach them how to play modern style football using the 3–5–2 formation. They managed to qualify for the U-17 Croatian Cup 2013 final.

In April 2013, he was hired as the new Hajduk Split manager. He lost his first away match against RNK Split, but in the 2012–13 Croatian Cup final first leg he defeated Lokomotiva 2–1 on Poljud. He achieved his first league victory against Osijek on 17 May 2013. He won the 2012–13 Croatian Cup after a 5–4 aggregate win against Lokomotiva in the final.

On 4 February 2015, Tudor resigned from Hajduk Split after managing the club for more than year and nine months.

===PAOK===
On 18 June 2015, Tudor was hired as the new manager of PAOK, signing a three-year contract. He lost 2–1 to Lokomotiva in his debut with PAOK for the second qualifying round of UEFA Europa League. He was dismissed on 9 March 2016 because of &quot;unsuccessful results and disparaging comments about the quality of the team&quot;.

===Karabükspor===
On 18 June 2016, Tudor was hired as the new manager of Karabükspor, signing a one-year contract. After making fantastic results with Karabükspor, Tudor left the club in February 2017 to become the new manager of Galatasaray.

===Galatasaray===
On 15 February 2017, Tudor was hired as the new manager of Turkish side Galatasaray, signing a one-and-a-half-year contract with the club. On 18 December, he was sacked by the club.

===Udinese===
On 24 April 2018, Tudor became the new manager of Italian team Udinese. His first win with Udinese came on 13 May 2018, in a 1–0 win over Verona.

After saving Udinese from relegation to Serie B, on 7 June 2018, Tudor left the club after not making a new deal with the club&#x27;s management.

===Return to Udinese===
On 20 March 2019, he became for a second time, the manager of Italian team Udinese. His first win as Udinese&#x27;s manager came on 30 March 2019, a 2–0 home win against Genoa.

Following a string of poor results, on 1 November 2019, Tudor was relieved of his managerial duties.

===Return to Hajduk Split===
On 23 December 2019, Hajduk announced that Tudor has been selected as new manager. On 2 January 2020, he officially took his role.

On 2 February, Tudor led his first match with Hajduk after three and a half years, that The Whites won 3–0 against Varaždin.

=== Juventus ===
On 23 August 2020, Tudor resigned from Hajduk Split, accepting Andrea Pirlo&#x27;s offer to be his assistant at Serie A side Juventus.

He and Pirlo were sacked at the end of the season, following Inter Milan&#x27;s reclaiming of the Serie A title.

===Hellas Verona===
On 14 September 2021, Tudor was appointed at the helm of Serie A club Hellas Verona in place of Eusebio Di Francesco. Tudor immediately managed to turn the club&#x27;s fortunes, ending the season in ninth place and achieving impressive performances throughout the season. On 28 May 2022, Verona announced to have parted ways with Tudor by mutual consent.

===Marseille===
On 4 July 2022, Tudor was named as the next manager of Marseille in the French Ligue 1.

On 1 June 2023, Tudor announced that he was to part ways with the French club at the end of the season, stating in an official press release of his &quot;&#x27;tiredness&quot;&#x27; with the club. Upon his departure from the club, Tudor had secured a third place finish in Ligue 1, therefore guaranteeing Marseille a place in the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League qualification stage.

===Lazio===
On 18 March 2024, Tudor signed with Serie A side Lazio after Maurizio Sarri&#x27;s resignation. Later that year, on 5 June, he resigned from his position upon the conclusion of the 2023–24 season.

==Coaching style==
Known for his forward-looking philosophy, Tudor seeks to impose an aggressive style of play in his teams. Describing his preferred style of play whilst manager of Marseille, he said “I want courageous and intensive football, not only uniquely based on the defence. I want people who come to the stadium to be entertained and not disappointed.”

<doc id="733315" wikidata="Q938086" url="?curid=733315" title="Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)">
<text>Kevin Plunder, also known as Ka-Zar, is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in &quot;The X-Men&quot; #10 (March 1965). Kevin Plunder is the second character to use the codename Ka-Zar.

==Publication history==

The second Ka-Zar started as a character similar to the first Ka-Zar, but also reminiscent of both Tarzan and of writer-artist Joe Kubert&#x27;s 1950s caveman character, Tor. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in &quot;The X-Men&quot; #10 (March 1965), he lives in the dinosaur-populated Savage Land, which was hidden in Antarctica by extraterrestrials. The character was based on his pulp magazine namesake only to the extent that he used the same name and rough &quot;jungle lord&quot; concept, and Lee later admitted that he had never even read any of the original Ka-Zar stories.

Originally written as a primitive and belligerent savage who spoke in broken English, Ka-Zar later became more articulate and civilized, although he retained a certain degree of distrust toward civilization and was generally wary of outside visitors to the Savage Land. Kevin Plunder refers to himself as the &quot;Lord of the Savage Land&quot;, a phrase others have adopted, but this is not a formal title.

Ka-Zar&#x27;s first solo story was published in &quot;Marvel Super-Heroes&quot; #19 (1969), and the character had features in the black-and-white magazine &quot;Savage Tales&quot; and the color title &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot;. He has had five self-titled series, the first published in 1970–1971 (three issues, mostly reprints), the second, which continued the storyline from &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot;, in 1974-1977 (20 issues, subtitled &quot;Lord of the Hidden Jungle&quot;) written by Mike Friedrich, Gerry Conway, and Doug Moench, the third in 1981-1984, &quot;Ka-Zar the Savage&quot;, (34 issues) written by Bruce Jones and Mike Carlin, the fourth in 1997-1998 (20 issues) written by Mark Waid and drawn by Andy Kubert, and the fifth in 2011 (a five-issue miniseries) written by Paul Jenkins.

==Fictional character biography==
Ka-Zar is Kevin Reginald, Lord Plunder, born in Castle Plunder, Kentish Town, London, England. He is the eldest son of Lord Robert Plunder, the English nobleman who discovered the Savage Land. After his mother had died and his father was killed by the barbaric Man-Ape natives led by Maa-Gor in the Savage Land, Plunder was found and raised by the saber-toothed cat Zabu, who possesses near-human intelligence thanks to a mutation caused by radioactive mists. &quot;Ka-Zar&quot; means &quot;Son of the Tiger&quot; in the language of the Man-Apes. Ka-Zar and Zabu are constant partners. Ka-Zar became an expert hunter, trapper, and fisherman, living off the wild land. 

In the Savage Land, some territories are populated by several human or humanoid tribes, and while most of them are on friendly terms with Ka-Zar, some of them consider him an outlander and an enemy. He acts more like an unofficial general protector, preventing outside commercial exploitation, such as poaching and mining, as well as enforcing peace between tribes and serving as goodwill ambassador to friendly visitors.

The original X-Men discovered the Savage Land, and Ka-Zar encountered them, battling Maa-Gor for the first time. He then encountered Daredevil for the first time, and battled his brother Parnival, who had become the supervillain called the Plunderer. He first battled Magneto&#x27;s Savage Land Mutates alongside the X-Men. He then encountered the Hulk for the first time, and battled Umbu the Unliving. He was once &#x27;tricked&#x27; into confronting Spider-Man after J. Jonah Jameson convinced him that Spider-Man was a menace when the wall-crawler&#x27;s memory was erased and he was tricked into working with Doctor Octopus. Spider-Man&#x27;s memory was restored during the fight, with Ka-Zar subsequently apologizing for the mistake and proclaiming Spider-Man as the most valiant opponent he had ever fought. Ka-Zar then battled Kraven the Hunter for the first time. Shortly after this encounter, Ka-Zar encounters Zaladane and Garokk for the first time. After the Savage Land became known to outsiders after the visit by the X-Men, many people began traveling to the territory. Ka-Zar has also become romantically involved with female visitors, the first being S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Barbara Morse (who later became the Avenger named Mockingbird). He first battled A.I.M., and met the Man-Thing. He then met Spider-Man once again, and battled the extraterrestrial Gog. He next met the adventurer Shanna O&#x27;Hara. He battled Klaw and visited other dimensions. He and his allies faded mysteriously from that other dimension, then teamed with the X-Men to battle Zaladane and a reborn Garokk.

Ka-Zar, during a search for the lost Zabu, later discovered Pangaea, an ancient refuge created by the Atlanteans. Ka-Zar and Shanna began to gradually fall in love. He then battles Belasco for the first time. After a meeting with A.I.M. spies disguised as scientists, Ka-Zar is shot in the head, but survives. He is flown to New York City, but escapes the plane at Kennedy Airport. With no memory and no ability to speak, he wanders New York, saving lives and fighting crime. His memory returns and he encounters Kraven The Hunter again, who has been released from prison by an A.I.M. agent to capture him. Saved by Shanna and Spider-Man, he is brought to the hospital where A.I.M. fakes his death to use him in a scheme. Escaping with Spider-Man&#x27;s aid, he and Shanna return to the Savage Land. He later marries Shanna, who has taken the name Shanna the She-Devil. During the ceremony, a war (incited by the machinations of Belasco) breaks out in Pangea, which ends when Ka-Zar and Shanna are banished. His brother Parnival arrived in the Savage Land, searching for anti-metal Vibranium, and was apparently killed during his scheme (though much later turned up alive). During this scheme, a Nuwali transport device is uncovered, and Ka-Zar, Shanna, and Zabu are transported to the Nuwali planet. The Nuwali use human adrenalin to poison their rivals, and also reveal to Shanna that she is pregnant. Ka-Zar has teamed up with several of Marvel&#x27;s heroes. The X-Men are recurrent visitors to the Savage Land and Ka-Zar has been a frequent ally, helping the mutant team defeat both inside and outside menaces such as Sauron and Magneto. He has met Spider-Man on several occasions, one of which involved stopping Stegron from invading New York City with Savage Land dinosaurs. Ka-Zar has also assisted the Avengers in their attempt to repel the space conqueror Terminus, but while they rescued many natives, they were unable to prevent the destruction of the Savage Land. Ka-Zar was rescued by the Avengers, but left the Savage Land for the civilized world. Together, he and Shanna had a son named Matthew. The territory was later reconstructed by the High Evolutionary using Garokk, and Ka-Zar and Shanna returned with their newborn and resumed their previous roles. Ka-Zar and Shanna separated for a time, but got back together before long. Ka-Zar fought and defeated Thanos in one of his many attempts to end life, and later sought the help of investigator Jessica Jones for assistance locating Zabu.

Shanna and Ka-Zar find Skrulls mining the rare metal vibranium in the Savage Land. Soon afterward as part of the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, a Skrull ship crashes in the Savage Land releasing earlier versions of modern superheroes (who claim to be the originals replaced by Skrulls for some time), and who have escaped. Shanna and Ka-Zar soon learn, however, that these are simply more Skrulls in disguise. Spider-Man soon encounters Ka-Zar, Shanna, Zabu, and some of the natives accusing them of being Skrulls. Just then, the Captain America from the ship attacked thinking the same for Spider-Man. Ka-Zar, Shanna, and Zabu help Spider-Man fight the Captain America from the ship until he is hit by a dart that causes him to regress to a Skrull named Pitt&#x27;o Nili, who is killed by Shanna while still believing himself to be Captain America due to the extensive mind conditioning carried out on him. He then later goes with the rest of the Avengers to New York City to help them fight off the Skrull invasion while Shanna stays behind with Zabu to fight off anymore Skrulls left in the Savage Land. Ka-Zar later meets Reptil when he and Tigra have rescued Moon-Boy. After reuniting Moon-Boy with Devil Dinosaur, Ka-Zar tells Reptil that he will help him find his parents. Ka-Zar and Shanna later encounter the return of the Ethereals and end up fighting them when it comes to the Ethereals wanting the tribes of the Savage Land to be united with them. He later teams with Skaar to protect the Savage Land from outside forces.

Ka-Zar later appears as a member of the Agents of Wakanda.

During &quot;The War of the Realms&quot; storyline, Ka-Zar picks up Gorilla-Man from the Wundagore Zoo in Transia, who was discussing with Ursa Major about an undercover operation he is running for Black Panther, and takes him to Avengers Mountain. Ka-Zar and Gorilla Man are then seen inside Roxxon&#x27;s secret base in Antarctica, fighting the company&#x27;s Berserkers alongside Blade.

During the &quot;Empyre&quot; storyline, Ka-Zar is unable to reach Shanna the She-Devil. Black Panther instructs Brother Voodoo to take Ka-Zar, Zabu, Black Knight, and Scarlet Witch with him to investigate. They arrive to find a slain Tyrannosaurus as Scarlet Witch senses they are surrounded. The group is attacked by the Cotati and they fight them until the Cotati Ventri unleash Man-Thing who they have under their control. As Ventri states that the Savage Land and the world will be theirs, Ka-Zar is shocked to find that the Cotati have gained control of Shanna. Due to her connection with the Savage Land&#x27;s lifeforce which the Cotati took advantage of, Shanna tries to get Ka-Zar to join them as Matthew states to Black Knight that they have to do something. Doctor Voodoo used a trick to do a mental trick. Scarlet Witch does the same as she tries to free Shanna from the Cotati&#x27;s control. To assist her, Scarlet Witch brings Ka-Zar into Shanna&#x27;s mind where he learns that some creatures in the Savage Land are dying and trees are falling. As Matthew and Black Knight fight the Cotati, a Doctor Voodoo-controlled Man-Thing fights the Cotati&#x27;s control and defeats Ventri. When Ka-Zar frees Shanna from the Cotati&#x27;s control, he is stabbed in the back by a Cotati using Black Knight&#x27;s Ebony Blade. Now back to her senses, the She-Devil aids the Avengers against the invaders. Meanwhile, Scarlet Witch and Doctor Voodoo work to extract Ka-Zar&#x27;s soul from the Ebony Blade, to which Shanna then uses the same fluids of the Man-Thing which revived her to heal and resurrect Ka-Zar. It works as the Savage Lord helps turn the tide on the Cotati where dinosaurs show up to help.

Ka-Zar would have trouble adjusting to his newly expanded senses while life in the Savage Land would come under threat by a precursor to its creation known as Domovoy the Flesh Weaver. He would work through this odd connection with the world Kevin calls home now shared between him &amp; his wife in the time needed to save their son from the Polyscion&#x27;s plans of global terraforming.

In the meantime, between domestic concerns and globe trotting adventures, Ka-Zar would continue his work as an Agent of Wakanda. Working as a temporal explorer sent back to the distant past of the newly-formed Earth on an observation mission regarding its primordial defenders wellbeing on T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s behalf. After an encounter with the ancient ancestors of Earth&#x27;s Mightiest, during a battle with Kid Thanos of Titan, a rival time traveler, Ka-Zar&#x27;s attempted return to his own time is waylaid by the Iron Inquisitor on orders from Mephisto. Finding himself stranded in an alien timeline on a world soon to be consumed by its still living iteration of Galactus, Ka-Zar poises himself for the fight of his life. He soon becomes Galactus&#x27; new herald in exchange for maneuvering this new handler into getting back to his home reality to warn the Avengers of the threat posed to their universe. Now backed by the Power Cosmic, the Savage Herald seeks out viable and uninhabited planets for Galactus to feed upon whilst navigating time and space to make his way home.

Ka-Zar is brought to the God Quarry by Avenger Prime and has brought along the alternate Galactus. When Galactus asks his Herald on a planet to feed off of, Ka-Zar directs him to the remains of Doom the Living Planet.

==Powers and abilities==
Kevin Plunder is an athletic man with no superhuman powers. He utilizes a unique style of hand-to-hand combat shaped by years of surviving in the Savage Land. He has developed great skills in hunting, trapping, fishing, foraging, and general survival in the wild. He carries a Bowie knife, and occasionally uses a sling, bow and arrow, and other primitive weapons. He can also communicate with some animals. It was revealed in &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot; #11, scripted by Roy Thomas, that Ka-Zar&#x27;s and Zabu&#x27;s physical abilities had been enhanced by passing through some mysterious mist. The mists later endowed other characters (Maa-Gor and El Tigre) with superhuman abilities.

After being healed by the same waters used to resurrect Shanna the She-Devil, Ka-Zar is tied into the life force of the Savage Land. He now boasts an even greater extrasensory connection with the primeval realm he calls home, Ka-Zar&#x27;s senses having been expanded to the point he can literally share sensations with the Savage Land and its faunal denizens. He can even emit destructive energy pulses or mimic the strengths and abilities of the creature living within it.

When left stranded on a parallel world in the distant past, Ka-Zar would become a herald of that realities iteration of the World Eater, being imbued with the space titan&#x27;s Power Cosmic granted him all the myriad faculties that comes with such a position of power.

BASIC currently has projects related to the UK Trident nuclear weapons debate, non-proliferation in the Middle East, and reframing the nuclear weapons debate. BASIC is also linked with the UK all-party parliamentary group on Global Security and Non-Proliferation. BASIC published the final report of the Trident Commission in July 2014, an independent and cross-party commission, co-chaired by Lord Browne of Ladyton, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, and Sir Menzies Campbell, examining the complexity of issues and options facing the UK government in the decision on its nuclear deterrent and its non-proliferation policy. The report recommended the continuation of the British nuclear program, conditional upon a number of actions needed to mitigate the negative impacts. 

==Organization details==
BASIC has charitable status in the United Kingdom.

<text>Killraven (Jonathan Raven) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character has been depicted as a freedom fighter in several post-apocalyptic alternate futures. Created by co-plotters Roy Thomas and Neal Adams, scriptwriter Gerry Conway, and penciller Adams, the character first appeared in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; vol. 2, #18 (May 1973). The series featured the first dramatic interracial kiss in American color comic books.

==Publishing history==
Co-creator Neal Adams&#x27; early ideas for Killraven involved the character being the son of a Doc Savage archetype. This concept had been reworked by the first issue, a multiple-creator goulash in which the two originators and co-plotters turned the scripting over to another writer, and in which artist co-creator Adams penciled only the first 11 pages and Howard Chaykin the remaining nine. The second issue was fully written by the debut&#x27;s scripter, Gerry Conway, followed in the third by Marv Wolfman.

After this, the book became the province of writer Don McGregor for an acclaimed run from #21 (Nov. 1973) to the final issue, #39 (Nov. 1976). Pencillers were Herb Trimpe, Rich Buckler, Gene Colan, and, most prominently, P. Craig Russell from issue #27 on.

Two of its characters, Carmilla Frost and the African American M&#x27;Shulla Scott, shared color comic books&#x27; earliest known dramatic interracial kiss, in issue #31 (July 1975), page nine, final panel.

Aside from McGregor, with whom the character became associated, other writers include Bill Mantlo (a fill-in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; and a &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; with Killraven and a future-flung Spider-Man); Joe Linsner (a 2001 Marvel Knights one-shot, &quot;Killraven&quot;, set in 2020 New York City, at odds with the original series&#x27; locale by that fictional year); and Alan Davis (also artist), in a 2002 parallel universe miniseries, &quot;Killraven&quot; vol. 2. An Essential Marvel volume in 2005 reprinted all the character&#x27;s appearances except that Davis story.

McGregor and Russell, however, remain the series&#x27; signature creative team; more than two decades after the original series&#x27; end, comics historian Peter Sanderson wrote that:
Some planned elements of the &quot;Killraven&quot; saga were incorporated into the Eclipse Comics series &quot;Sabre&quot;, McGregor and Russell each said in 1983.

The character made latter-day appearances in &quot;Marvel Zombies 5&quot; #2 (April 2010) where the war against the Martians is concluded, and in &quot;The Avengers&quot; vol. 4, #4-6 (Aug.-Oct. 2010), the latter in the present day after time-traveling. Killraven appears in &quot;Claws II&quot; (Aug. 2011), in which the superheroes Wolverine and Black Cat meet him in the future fighting Martians.

In 2014, Killraven also makes a cameo appearance in &quot;All-New Invaders&quot; Issue # 12 in a modern retelling of the War of the Worlds.

===Unrealized projects===
In the late 1980s, Don McGregor wrote 50 to 60 pages and P. Craig Russell began illustrating a final story, &quot;Killraven: Final Battles, Final Lies, Final Truths&quot; (also referred to as &quot;Final Lies, Final Truths, Final Battles&quot;). The story never saw print, according to McGregor, because Marvel would not assure Russell the company would print the story in Marvel&#x27;s best format at the time. In this intended finale to McGregor&#x27;s story, &quot;Killraven would take that war back to the intruders&quot; on Mars itself.

In the mid-1990s, Grant Morrison and Mark Millar considered tying in Marvel&#x27;s 2099 imprint, making Ravage a descendant of Killraven: &quot;Our idea was that the Killraven stories had actually happened, but Earth somehow got itself back together. It&#x27;s now one hundred years later, and the Martians are attacking again, meaning that all the superheroes were going to have to deal with them&quot;. Galactus then arrives, and devours Mars along with the Martians.

In 2005, writer Jim Valentino said his aborted plans for the Marvel comic &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; involved Killraven, in his 50s, joining the team and forming an attraction to Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara). Valentino said he would have established Franklin Richards as Killraven&#x27;s father.

Writer Robert Kirkman and artist Rob Liefeld announced in August 2007 they were creating a five-issue alternate universe Killraven miniseries planned for release in 2008, but the project never went into production.

==Fictional character biography==
On the alternate-future Earth designated Earth-691 by Marvel Comics, the Martians from H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; return in 2001 for another attempt at conquering the planet (they were later retconned as extrasolar aliens using Mars as a staging area). After humanity&#x27;s enslavement, men not used as breeders or collaborators are trained and forced to battle gladiator-style for the Martians&#x27; amusement; women are used as breeders to supply infants, eaten by the Martians as a delicacy. Jonathan Raven, dubbed Killraven as his gladiatorial &quot;nom de guerre&quot;, escaped with the help of the gladiatorial &quot;keeper&quot;, but without his brother, Deathraven. Killraven joined the Freemen, a group of freedom fighters against Martian oppression.

From 2018 to 2020, Killraven and his companions travel across the eastern portion of North America, from New York City to Cape Canaveral while searching for Killraven&#x27;s lost brother. Pursued by the cyborg Skar, the Freemen encounter various victims of Martian transhuman experiments, as well as emotionally and psychologically scarred survivors.

Fugitives from the Martians, Killraven and his Freemen — his African American &quot;mud-brother&quot; M&#x27;Shulla Scott, the cynical and bitter Native American Hawk, and the slow-witted strongman Old Skull — meet and incorporate into their group the feisty scientist Carmilla Frost and Grok, her deformed, apelike clone. The Freemen ally with the human/plant hybrid Mint Julep, and battle Abraxas, Rattack and his rats, the High Overlord, and Skar. Killraven tames a mutated serpent-horse to use as his mount, and his Freemen battle Pstun-Rage in Battle Creek, Michigan. In this encounter, the antagonists&#x27; names are anagrams of the Battle Creek-based Kellogg Company&#x27;s breakfast cereals. The Freemen meet the flirty and sensual Volcana Ash, who helps them battle Atalon and the Death-Breeders. After learning that his brother Joshua (Deathraven) is still alive, Killraven fights Martian slaves alongside a time-traveling Spider-Man, The Freemen eventually reach the Everglades, where they encounter a military cadre of survivors and the butterfly-like Mourning Prey.

Still later, the Freemen encounter Killraven&#x27;s brother, Deathraven, and discover he has become a Martian collaborator.

In November 2020, the Martian occupation is over when Killraven unleashes a zombie plague on the Martians&#x27; food supply (humans and human infants).

==Powers and abilities==
As a youth, gladiator-in-training Jonathan Raven&#x27;s physical prowess was heightened thanks to injections of experimental chemicals by Keeper Whitman. He was later given mental powers through Whitman&#x27;s psycho-electric experiments, including the psionic ability to project his consciousness into and take over a Martian&#x27;s mind, and the psychic ability to resist mental assaults and to mask his presence from robot scanners.

Killraven is also a superb hand-to-hand combatant, and a highly skilled swordsman, wrestler, and martial artist. He is a master of most hand weaponry, especially shuriken. He is a master strategist in guerrilla warfare. Killraven possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of human history, art, and science predating the Martian invasion of A.D. 2001, implanted in his mind by Keeper Whitman.

As artist P. Craig Russell described, &quot;Killraven has a sort of extrasensory ability to counterbalance his gladiatorial skills. He is very much the barbarian type, yet at the same time he has this seed planted in his brain that is the history of the human race — a racial memory of everything that has been obliterated by the Martians. It&#x27;s almost a magical ability... It was what removed him from being just another sword-wielding gladiator type.&quot;

Killraven wears bulletproof fabrics and leather. He is armed with various weapons as needed, and usually carried a sword and shuriken. He sometimes rides a mutated serpent-horse, or appropriated Martian vehicles and aircraft.

==Other versions==

There have been counterparts of Killraven in several stories:

* The &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes 2005&quot; established that Killraven and the Guardiansshare the same timeline, set on the parallel universe Marvel Comics designates &quot;Earth-691&quot;.
* The 1998-1999 miniseries &quot;Avengers Forever&quot; depicts Killraven as a member of an alternate future Avengers (Earth-9930) led by the Black Panther.
* Alan Davis&#x27; 2002 miniseries &quot;Killraven&quot; rebooted the series in a story set set on the parallel universe Marvel Comics designates &quot;Earth-2120&quot;.
* Jon Raven is Will of the People in Earth-7305 a Captain Britain Corps member who featured in &quot;Excalibur&quot; #50.
*In an alternate future shown in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; #18 (2009), Killraven leads the Guardians against the Martians in the year 3009.
* In 1975, Marvel UK&#x27;s &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; weekly comic reprinted the original Killraven feature as &quot;Apeslayer&quot;, with artwork and lettering altered to suit. 

===Mainstream Marvel continuity===
In the mainstream Marvel Universe that the company dubs Earth-616, Jonathan Raven appears in the 2006-2007 miniseries &quot;Wisdom&quot;. He is the son of Wisdom&#x27;s MI-13 co-worker and lover, Maureen Raven, and the target of a trans-dimensional Martian Invasion because, as the Martian leader states, &quot;On all Earths! Always! Every one of him is dangerous! Ruling council plan to invade all other Earths. So I urged this first expedition now before he is grown&quot;. Wisdom is forced to kill Maureen in order to stop the Martian invasion, while Jonathan is taken to an MI-6 safehouse in Prague and trained by martial artist Shang-Chi.

==Parodies==
In &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; #2 (March 1976), the title character dreams of himself as &quot;Killmallard&quot;.

==In other media==
Hollywood trade stories in 2005 reported plans to adapt Killraven for a theatrical motion picture, with Marvel and Sony Pictures in negotiations with Robert Schenkkan to write a script. Those plans were abandoned and the rights of Killraven were reverted to Marvel.

<text>The Amarna letters (; sometimes referred to as the Amarna correspondence or Amarna tablets, and cited with the abbreviation EA, for &quot;El Amarna&quot;) are an archive, written on clay tablets, primarily consisting of diplomatic correspondence between the Egyptian administration and its representatives in Canaan and Amurru, or neighboring kingdom leaders, during the New Kingdom, spanning a period of no more than thirty years in the middle 14th century BC. The letters were found in Upper Egypt at el-Amarna, the modern name for the ancient Egyptian capital of &quot;Akhetaten&quot;, founded by pharaoh Akhenaten (c. 1351–1334 BC) during the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt.

The Amarna letters are unusual in Egyptological research, because they are written not in the language of ancient Egypt, but in cuneiform, the writing system of ancient Mesopotamia. Most are in a variety of Akkadian sometimes characterised as a mixed language, Canaanite-Akkadian; one especially long letter—abbreviated EA 24—was written in a late dialect of Hurrian, and is the longest contiguous text known to survive in that language.

The known tablets total 382 and fragments (350 are letters and the rest literary texts
and school texts), of which 358 have been published by the Norwegian Assyriologist Jørgen Alexander Knudtzon in his work, &quot;Die El-Amarna-Tafeln&quot;, which came out in two volumes (1907 and 1915) and remains the standard edition to this day. The texts of the remaining 24 complete or fragmentary tablets excavated since Knudtzon have also been made available. Only 26 of the known tablets and fragments were found in their archaeological context, Building Q42.21.

The Amarna letters are of great significance for biblical studies as well as Semitic linguistics because they shed light on the culture and language of the Canaanite peoples in this time period. Though most are written in Akkadian, the Akkadian of the letters is heavily colored by the mother tongue of their writers, who probably spoke an early form of Proto-Canaanite, the language(s) which would later evolve into the daughter languages of Hebrew and Phoenician. These &quot;Canaanisms&quot; provide valuable insights into the proto-stage of those languages several centuries prior to their first actual manifestation.

==The letters==
These letters, comprising cuneiform tablets written primarily in Akkadian – the regional language of diplomacy for this period – were first discovered around 1887 by local Egyptians who secretly dug most of them from the ruined city of Amarna, and sold them in the antiquities market. They had originally been stored in an ancient building that archaeologists have since called the Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh. Once the location where they were found was determined, the ruins were explored for more. The first archaeologist who successfully recovered more tablets was Flinders Petrie, who in 1891 and 1892 uncovered 21 fragments. Émile Chassinat, then director of the French Institute for Oriental Archaeology in Cairo, acquired two more tablets in 1903. Since Knudtzon&#x27;s edition, some 24 more tablets, or fragments, have been found, either in Egypt, or identified in the collections of various museums.

The initial group of letters recovered by local Egyptians have been scattered among museums in Germany, England, Egypt, France, Russia, and the United States. Either 202 or 203 tablets are at the Vorderasiatisches Museum in Berlin; 99 are at the British Museum in London; 49 or 50 are at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo; 7 at the Louvre in Paris; 3 at the Pushkin Museum in Moscow; and 1 in the collection of the Oriental Institute in Chicago. A few tablets are at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford and the Royal Museum of Art and History in Brussels.

The archive contains a wealth of information about cultures, kingdoms, events and individuals in a period from which few written sources survive. It includes correspondence from Akhenaten&#x27;s reign (Akhenaten who was also titled Amenhotep IV), as well as his predecessor Amenhotep III&#x27;s reign. The tablets consist of over 300 diplomatic letters; the remainder comprise miscellaneous literary and educational materials. These tablets shed much light on Egyptian relations with Babylonia, Assyria, Syria, Canaan, and Alashiya (Cyprus) as well as relations with the Mitanni, and the Hittites. The letters have been important in establishing both the history and the chronology of the period. Letters from the Babylonian king, Kadashman-Enlil I, anchor the timeframe of Akhenaten&#x27;s reign to the mid-14th century BC. They also contain the first mention of a Near Eastern group known as the &quot;Habiru&quot;, whose possible connection with the Hebrews—due to the similarity of the words and their geographic location—remains debated. Other rulers involved in the letters include Tushratta of Mitanni, Lib&#x27;ayu of Shechem, Abdi-Heba of Jerusalem, and the quarrelsome king, Rib-Hadda, of Byblos, who, in over 58 letters, continuously pleads for Egyptian military help. Specifically, the letters include requests for military help in the north against Hittite invaders, and in the south to fight against the Habiru.
===Letter found at Tell Beth-Shean===
During excavation in 1993 a small, damaged, clay cylinder (first thought to be a cylinder seal) was found. It was inscribed with &quot;Amarna Cuneiform&quot; and held a letter which appears to be part of the Amarna correspondence.
===Letter summary===

Amarna Letters are politically arranged in a rough counterclockwise fashion:
* 001–014 Babylonia
* 015–016 Assyria
* 017–030 Mitanni
* 031–032 Arzawa
* 033–040 Alashiya
* 041–044 Hatti
* 045–380+ Syria/Lebanon/Canaan

Amarna Letters from Syria/Lebanon/Canaan are distributed roughly:
* 045–067 Syria
* 068–227 Lebanon (where 68–140 are from Gubla aka Byblos)
* 227–380 Canaan (written mostly in the Canaano-Akkadian language).

=== Akhenaten and Tushratta ===

Early in his reign, Akhenaten, the pharaoh of Egypt, had conflicts with Tushratta, the king of Mitanni, who had courted favor with his father, Amenhotep III, against the Hittites. Tushratta complains in numerous letters that Akhenaten had sent him gold-plated statues rather than statues made of solid gold; the statues formed part of the bride-price that Tushratta received for letting his daughter Tadukhepa marry Amenhotep III and then later marry Akhenaten.

An Amarna letter preserves a complaint by Tushratta to Akhenaten about the situation:

I...asked your father Mimmureya [i.e., Amenhotep III] for statues of solid cast gold, ... and your father said, &#x27;Don&#x27;t talk of giving statues just of solid cast gold. I will give you ones made also of lapis lazuli. I will give you too, along with the statues, much additional gold and [other] goods beyond measure.&#x27; Every one of my messengers that were staying in Egypt saw the gold for the statues with their own eyes. ... But my brother [i.e., Akhenaten] has not sent the solid [gold] statues that your father was going to send. You have sent plated ones of wood. Nor have you sent me the goods that your father was going to send me, but you have reduced [them] greatly. Yet there is nothing I know of in which I have failed my brother. ... May my brother send me much gold. ... In my brother&#x27;s country gold is as plentiful as dust. May my brother cause me no distress. May he send me much gold in order that my brother [with the gold and m]any [good]s may honour me.
==Amarna letters list==
Note: Many assignments are tentative; spellings vary widely. This is just a guide.

===Chronology===
William L. Moran summarizes the state of the chronology of these tablets as follows:

From the internal evidence, the earliest possible date for this correspondence is the final decade of the reign of Amenhotep III, who ruled from 1388 to 1351 BC (or 1391 to 1353 BC), possibly as early as this king&#x27;s 30th regnal year; the latest date any of these letters were written is the desertion of the city of Amarna, commonly believed to have happened in the second year of the reign of Tutankhamun later in the same century in 1332 BC. Moran notes that some scholars believe one tablet, EA 16, may have been addressed to Tutankhamun&#x27;s successor Ay or Smenkhkare. However, this speculation appears improbable because the Amarna archives were closed by Year 2 of Tutankhamun, when this king transferred Egypt&#x27;s capital from Amarna to Thebes.

==Quotations and phrases==

A small number of the Amarna letters are in the class of poetry. An example is EA 153, entitled: &quot;Ships on hold&quot;, from Abimilku of Tyre. This is a short, 20-line letter. Lines 6–8 and 9-11 are parallel phrases, each ending with &quot;...before the troops of the king, my lord.&quot;-(&#x27;before&#x27;, then line 8, line 11). Both sentences are identical, and repetitive, with only the subject statement changing.

The entire corpus of Amarna letters has many standard phrases. It also has some phrases, and quotations used only once. Some are parables: (EA 252: &quot;...when an ant is pinched (struck), does it not fight back and bite the hand of the man that struck it?&quot;...)

===Bird in a Cage===
:&quot;A bird in a cage (Trap)&quot;—Rib-Hadda subcorpus of letters. (Rib-Hadda was trapped in Gubla-(Byblos), unable to move freely.)

===&quot;A brick may move..&quot;===
:&quot;A brick may move from under its partner, still I will not move from under the feet of the king, my lord.&quot;—Used in letters EA 266, 292, and 296. EA 292 by Adda-danu of Gazru.

===&quot;Hale like the Sun...&quot;===
:&quot;&quot;And know that the King-(pharaoh) is hale like the Sun in the Sky.&quot; For his troops and his chariots in multitude all goes very well...&quot;—See: Endaruta, for the &quot;Short Form&quot;; See: Milkilu, for a &quot;Long Form&quot;. Also found in EA 99: entitled: &quot;&quot;From the Pharaoh to a vassal&quot;.&quot; (with addressee damaged)

===&quot;I looked this way, and I looked...&quot;===
:&quot;I looked this way, and I looked that way, and there was no light. Then I looked towards the king, my lord, and there was light.&quot;—EA 266 by Tagi (Ginti mayor); EA 296 by Yahtiru.

===&quot;May the Lady of Gubla..&quot;===
:&quot;May the Lady of Gubla grant power to the king, my lord.&quot;—varieties of the phrase in the Rib-Hadda letters

===a pot held in pledge===
:&quot;a pot held in pledge&quot;—The Pot of a Debt. EA 292 by Adda-danu of Gazru.

===7 times and 7 times again===
:&quot;7 times and 7 times&quot;—Over and over again
:&quot;7 times plus 7&quot;—EA 189, See: &quot;Etakkama of Kadesh&quot;(title)-(Qidšu)

===I fall ... 7 times and 7...&quot;on the back and on the stomach&quot;===
:I fall, at the feet, ... 7 times and 7 times, &quot;on the back and on the stomach&quot;—EA 316, by Pu-Ba&#x27;lu, and used in numerous letters to pharaoh. See: Commissioner: Tahmašši.

===&quot;when an ant is struck..&quot;===
:&quot;...when an ant is pinched (struck), does it not fight back and bite the hand of the man that struck it?&quot;—A phrase used by Labayu defending his actions of overtaking cities, EA 252. Title: &quot;&quot;Sparing one&#x27;s enemies&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="733362" wikidata="Q844502" url="?curid=733362" title="Quetzaltenango Department">
<text>Quetzaltenango is a department in the western highlands of Guatemala. The capital is the city of Quetzaltenango, the second largest city in Guatemala. The department is divided up into 24 municipalities. The inhabitants include Spanish-speaking Ladinos and the Kʼicheʼ and Mam Maya groups, both with their own Maya language. The department consists of mountainous terrain, with its principal river being the Samalá River. the department is seismically active, suffering from both earthquakes and volcanic activity.

Prior to the Spanish conquest the territory included in the modern department formed a part of the Kʼicheʼ Kingdom of Qʼumarkaj. The kingdom was defeated by the Spanish under Pedro de Alvarado in a number of decisive battles fought near the city of Quetzaltenango, then known as Xelaju. In the 19th century the territory of the modern department was included in the short-lived Central American state of Los Altos. The department was created by decree in 1845, five years after the fledgling state was crushed by Rafael Carrera.

The department has wide variations in local climate, due largely to marked differences in altitude in different areas. The year is divided into wet and dry seasons, with the wet season lasting from July to September and the dry season running from December to February. The wide climatic variation in the department allows for the production of a variety of agricultural products, including temperate fruits, vegetables and cereals in the highlands, as well as coffee on the lower slopes.

Quetzaltenango department has produced a number of high-profile Guatemalans, including several presidents as well as a number of musicians.

==Name==
The department takes its name from the city of Quetzaltenango, which serves as the departmental capital. Although the original Kʼicheʼ inhabitants knew the city by the name &quot;Xelaju&quot;, the Nahuatl-speaking allies of the Spanish Conquistadors named it &quot;Quetzaltenango&quot; in their own language, meaning &quot;land of the quetzal birds&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===
The territory that came to be included within the modern department of Quetzaltenango was the scene of several decisive battles in February 1524 between Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado and the Kʼicheʼ Kingdom of Qʼumarkaj. Pedro de Alvarado had initially advanced with his army along the Pacific coast without opposition until they reached the Samalá River; this region formed a part of the Kʼicheʼ kingdom. Alvarado then turned to head upriver into the Sierra Madre mountains towards the Kʼicheʼ heartlands, crossing the pass into the fertile valley of Quetzaltenango. On 12 February 1524 Alvarado&#x27;s Mexican allies were ambushed in the pass and driven back by the Kʼicheʼ warriors but the Spanish cavalry charge that followed was a shock for the Kʼicheʼ who had never seen horses before. The cavalry scattered the Kʼicheʼ and the army crossed to the city of Xelaju, modern Quetzaltenango, to find it deserted by its inhabitants. Although the common view is that the Kʼicheʼ prince Tecun Uman died in the later battle near Olintepeque, the Spanish accounts are clear that at least one and possibly two of the lords of Qʼumarkaj died in the fierce battles upon the initial approach to Quetzaltenango. The death of Tecun Uman is said to have taken place in the battle of El Pinar, and local tradition has his death taking place upon the Llanos de Urbina (Plains of Urbina), upon the approach to Quetzaltenango near the modern village of Cantel. Pedro de Alvardo, in his 3rd letter to Hernán Cortés, describes the death of one of the four lords of Qʼumarkaj upon the approach to Quetzaltenango. The letter was dated 11 April 1524 and was written during his stay at Qʼumarkaj. Almost a week later, on 18 February 1524, a Kʼicheʼ army confronted the Spanish army in the Quetzaltenango valley where they were comprehensively defeated, with many Kʼicheʼ nobles among the dead. Such were the numbers of Kʼicheʼ dead that Olintepeque was given the new name &quot;Xequiquel&quot;, roughly meaning &quot;bathed in blood&quot;. This battle exhausted the Kʼicheʼ militarily and they asked for peace and offered tribute, inviting Pedro de Alvarado into their capital Qʼumarkaj.

On 2 February 1838, Quetzaltenango joined together with Huehuetenango, El Quiché, Retalhuleu, San Marcos, Sololá, Suchitepéquez and Totonicapán to form the short-lived Central American state of Los Altos, with the city of Quetzaltenango functioning as its capital. The state was crushed in 1840 by general Rafael Carrera Turcios, at that time between periods in office as Guatemalan president.

===Departmental history===

Quetzaltenango was declared a department by decree of the Asamblea Nacional Constituyente on 16 September 1845.

In 1902 Quetzaltenango suffered a number of serious earthquakes. An earthquake struck on 18 April 1902, with its epicentre within the Santa María volcano. This was followed by a major eruption of the volcano from 24 to 26 October of the same year. The volcano emitted a massive column of ash, provoking a fierce lightning storm. The explosions emitted by the volcano were audible up to away. The government of Manuel Estrada Cabrera initially denied that the eruption had taken place in Guatemala, instead claiming that it had occurred in neighbouring Mexico. Although the eruption caused great loss of life in western Guatemala, the Guatemalan government downplayed its severity.

The activity of the volcano continued until 1906, followed be a period of calm that lasted until 1922. A new series of eruptions took place from 1922 through to 1929, and formed a new side crater, the Santiaguito volcano. On the night of 11 November 1929, a lava flow descended from the volcano towards El Palmar, killing hundreds of people, setting fire to a number of mountainsides and burying coffee plantations under several metres of lava.

==Geography==

The department of Quetzaltenango is situated in the western highlands of Guatemala and covers an area of approximately , approximately 1.8% of the total area of the Republic of Guatemala. The department is bordered on the west by the department of San Marcos, by the departments of Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez to the south, by Huehuetenango Department to the north and by the departments of Totonicapán and Sololá to the east.

The department is mountainous in nature and includes a wide range of altitudes, from in Génova to in Sibilia. The average altitude is above mean sea level. The principal mountains include the volcanoes Cerro Quemado, Chicabal, Lacandon, Santa María, Santiaguito, Santo Tomás (also known as Picul) and Siete Orejas, as well as Zunil peak, often erroneously referred to as a volcano. Cerro Quemado produces a number of thermal springs, several of which have been converted into baths. The area covered by the department is seismically active, with earthquakes measuring from 4.5 to 5.2 on the Richter scale.

The broken terrain of the department includes a number of wide valleys, including those occupied by the city of Quetzaltenango and the towns of San Juan Ostuncalco and Concepción Chiquirichapa. The varied terrain of the department also includes plains, canyons and high cliffs.

The most important river in the department is the Samalá River, flowing through the municipalities of Cantel, El Palmar, San Carlos Sija, Quetzaltenango, San Juan Ostuncalco and Zunil. The river flows into Quetzaltenango department from the neighbouring department of Totonicapán and flows southwards into the department of Retalhuleu.

Other notable rivers in the department include the Tumalá River in the municipality of Cajolá, the El Naranjo River in the municipality of San Carlos Sija, and the Las Palomas and Xocal Rivers in the municipality of Concepción Chiquirichapa.

==Climate==
The average temperature in the department of Quetzaltenango varies between , however there is wide variation due to the great difference in altitude in various parts of the department. On the lower Pacific slopes the temperature can reach as high as , while temperatures as low as have been recorded at higher altitudes.

Average annual rainfall is in the municipality of Almolonga, and parts of the department at higher altitudes experience frost in the months from November through to March. The municipality of Cantel receives an average annual rainfall that varies between ; in Huitán it varies between .

The year is divided into wet and dry seasons, with most rain falling in July and September. The driest months of the year are December through to February. The department falls within two principal biomes, classified as subtropical moist forest and tropical and subtropical coniferous forest. The former is a lower altitude zone characterised by corozo palms and conacaste (&quot;Enterolobium cyclocarpum&quot;). The latter is higher altitude featuring pine, cypress and sycamore.

==Population==
The 2018 census recorded the department&#x27;s population at 799,101 inhabitants. The inhabitants are divided between three principal ethnicities; Ladino, Kʼicheʼ Maya and Mam Maya. Three languages are spoken in the department, broadly corresponding to the ethnic groups; Spanish, Kʼicheʼ and Mam. In 2004, 40.4% of the population was listed as non-indigenous (i.e. Ladino) and 59.6% as indigenous (mainly Kʼicheʼ and Mam). In 1999, average life expectancy was calculated as 63.7 years. In the same year, 63.7% of dwellings had electricity, 70.1% had drinking water and 92.5% had sanitation.

Each municipality is known for its different traditional indigenous dress, with the exceptions of Coatepeque, Colomba, Flores Costa Cuca and San Carlos Sija, where traditional clothing is not worn by the indigenous inhabitants. These &quot;trajes&quot; are manufactured by the local inhabitants themselves.

==Economy and agriculture==
The wide climatic variation within the department resulting from differences in altitude gives rise to a diverse range of agricultural products. These include apples, beetroot, cabbages, carrots, high quality coffee, common beans, maize, onions, peaches, plums, potatoes, radishes, turnips and wheat. Almolonga is the main producer of vegetables, both for the national market and for export, principally to Mexico and countries in Central America. Salcajá is known for its production of a fruit liquor called &quot;caldo de frutas&quot; (&quot;fruit wine&quot;). Other products of the department include woolen textiles, cotton, silk, ceramics, alcoholic beverages and flour.

Poorer high altitude areas of the department experience seasonal migration of workers to the Pacific lowlands in order to work on coffee, sugarcane and cotton plantations.

==Tourism==
Quetzaltenango city is the main tourist hub for the department and is a centre for cultural tourism. Most hotels are located in Quetzaltenango city and Coatepeque, with 495 registered hotels in 2006. Quetzaltenango city is also a centre for tourists studying Spanish as a second language, with 35 Spanish schools in 2006. Tourist attractions outside Quetzaltenango city include the thermal baths located around the Cerro Quemado volcano, including the thermal baths of Almolonga, Aguas Amargas (&quot;Bitter Waters&quot;) and Fuentes Georginas, which has become a tourist attraction of some importance.

==Archaeological sites==
In 2010, seasonal rains uncovered the small Kʼicheʼ archaeological site of Chojolom in the municipality of Cantel. It has been tentatively dated to the Postclassic Period (c. 950-1521 AD). Cerro Quiac is another small site on a hilltop in Cantel municipality, dated to the Early Postclassic period (c. 950-1200 AD).

==Political structure==

The departmental government is headed by the Governor of Quetzaltenango, who is appointed directly by the president of Guatemala. Aldo Herrera Scheel was appointed as departmental governor in 2024 by president Bernardo Arévalo.

== Municipalities ==
==Notable people==

Former presidents of Guatemala Manuel Estrada Cabrera and Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán were from the department of Quetzaltenango. Manuel Estrada was born in the city of Quetzaltenango on 21 November 1857, Jacobo Árbenz was born in the same city on 14 September 1913. Quetzaltenango Department also produced the musicians Jesús Castillo, writer of the &quot;Quiché Winak&quot; opera, and his brother Ricardo Castillo, as well as the classical musician Mariano Valverde. Another notable musician was Francisco &quot;Paco&quot; Pérez, who wrote the &quot;Luna de Xelajú&quot; waltz. Guatemalan historian Adrián Inés Chávez, who produced a Spanish translation of the Popul Vuh, was also from the department.

<doc id="733363" wikidata="Q105177710" url="?curid=733363" title="Bassie &amp; Adriaan">
<text>Bassie &amp; Adriaan was a television program series focusing on the adventures and lives of a circus duo consisting of clown Bassie and acrobat Adriaan, played by real-life circus duo Bas and Aad van Toor.

Written by Aad van Toor and originally produced by Joop van den Ende, the first series became a television hit in the Netherlands in the spring season of 1978. At its peak, the show attracted over three million viewers, which was noted to be &quot;a lot&quot; for a children&#x27;s program. The show ran for nine series, with the last original episode airing in 1996. Between 1980 and 1982, the Van Toor brothers ran their own independent circus, which was named Circus Bassie &amp; Adriaan, which later became a subsidiary of Circus Renz.

==Background==
Bas van Toor (born 1935) left school at an early age to pursue a number of odd-jobs. At 19 he joined the circus and spent a year on the road. After this, he decided to form an acrobat duo with his brother Aad (born 1942). In 1955, The Melton Brothers/The Crocksons were born. The seeds for Bassie &amp; Adriaan were sown in 1964 when the brothers did a clown act as part of Rudi Carrell&#x27;s travelling circus. The brothers wrote a clown act for Pipo de Clown, and incorporated themselves into it as well. In 1965, they embarked on what was planned to be a two-year stint abroad; they stayed abroad ten years instead. During this period they befriended Siegfried &amp; Roy, incorporated the wives into their act (The Four Crocksons) and staged children&#x27;s matinees in Dutch, German and English while residing in Spain for nightclub-shows. It was so successful that the brothers were invited to make their own series under the scrutiny of Joop van den Ende.

==History==
===1978–1982: First series and Circus Bassie en Adriaan===

In January 1978, TROS released the first series of Bassie &amp; Adriaan, titled &quot;De avonturen van Bassie en Adriaan&quot; (&quot;The adventures of Bassie and Adriaan&quot;). With its crossover potential, the series became the most watched children&#x27;s series of the first half of 1978. As a result, the show was soon renewed for a second season, which received just as high viewing figures. Within the space of two years, three series were shot and released.

In 1980, Joop van den Ende founded a circus around the duo and toured with it throughout the country. The circus proved popular in its first year and sold out nearly every single show.

===1982–1987: Closure of the circus, split from Joop van den Ende, split from and return to TROS===
After the release of &quot;De huilende professor&quot; in 1982, TROS saw the appreciation ratings for the series go down and proposed the Van Toor brothers to put the series on halt for a year to give the older series more time to be rebroadcast. Bas van Toor claimed that TROS did not want the brothers anymore, while the head of entertainment of the broadcaster stated that the brothers were allowed to go to other broadcasters if they pleased.

Meanwhile, the brothers Van Toor also ended their long-term collaboration with producer Joop van den Ende after he left in his position of director at Circus Bassie &amp; Adriaan, which left the brothers taking over the daily management of the business. The brothers were soon overworked and let the circus collapse in favour of their own well-being. On top of that, the costs had outweighed the earnings.

They then started their collaboration with Belgian broadcaster BRT, for which they produced several mini-series. BRT was also interested in commissioning a long series with proper episodes. In 1985, TROS commissioned a new series by the duo, which made their return to the TROS official.

===1987–1996: Later series===
In 1987, the first of their self-produced series, which consists of five seasons, was released: &quot;Het geheim van de schatkaart&quot; (The secret of the treasure map). It quickly became the most appreciated television program of the Netherlands with an average of 7.7 out of 10. Its premiere on 9 January 1987 received a 7.6 and amassed to an audience share of 11%, outscoring other popular television programmes for adults. As a result of the success, the brothers received a contract to produce two more seasons. 
All of the self produced seasons feature the Baron as the primary antagonist. In the first three seasons, his accomplices are Vlugge Japie (quick Japie) and B2. In the first episode of season 4, the three crooks are released from prison. B2 apparently did not hear that they&#x27;re free and is still in his cell (which the Baron decides is fine). Vlugge Japie, sick of the Baron&#x27;s obsession with Bassie and Adriaan, decides to abandon him. The Baron searches for a new hiding place, he decided to steal a yacht. In this yacht he makes a phone call, this is a key moment, since it is the first time the Baron reveals his (last) name, up until now, he only was known as De Baron. 
The Baron hires two new criminals, the explosives expert Handige Harry (Handy Harry) and a spy only known by the code name B100. These two are his sidekicks for the final two seasons.

===1997–2003: Farewell tour and Aad van Toor&#x27;s illness===

In October 2002 Bassie &amp; Adriaan announced their farewell tour. The final show, planned for January 4, 2004, was to include a guest appearance by the three crooks, however the tour prematurely ended on July 31, 2003, as Aad van Toor was diagnosed with cancer. At the end of the last show, when his relatives brought him flowers, he burst into tears. &quot;You want more?&quot; he asked as usual. &quot;Well so do I, but unfortunately I&#x27;m sick. I have to go to hospital&quot;.

===2003–present: Film appearance and revived success===
In 2003, the Dutch branch of Nickelodeon bought the rights to show several seasons of Bassie &amp; Adriaan series on their channel. These reruns proved a success as it quickly became the channels most watched programme at the time, collecting almost half a million viewers per episode. Aad van Toor hosted a special 24-hour marathon of episodes for the channel on New Year&#x27;s Day 2004.

In September 2014, the show&#x27;s theme song &quot;Hallo Vriendjes&quot; became a viral internet sensation when Dutch teens and students challenged their international friends to sing along to the lyrics.

In 2015, the Van Toor brothers played Bassie and Adriaan in the picture &quot;Keet&amp;Koen en de speurtocht naar Bassie &amp; Adriaan&quot;.

In 2019, their production company started uploading their episodes on YouTube, after they had registered a channel in 2012. This proved popular, as their old episodes got over 90 million views all together. It led Veronica&#x27;s &quot;Superguide&quot; joke that &quot;you do not have to young and handsome to become a YouTube success&quot;. The brothers stated that they initially had wanted to sell their series to Netflix, but that Netflix had rejected them because of the series&#x27; poor picture quality.

The Van Toor brothers were in a long-term legal battle with actor Paul van Gorcum, who played the Baron in several series. Together with three other actors, they sued the Van Toor brothers over their own right on royalty payments for the series produced with Joop van den Ende. In 2020, the Rotterdam district court ruled that Van Toor brothers had to pay damages of €15,000 in total to four actors including Van Gorcum. This sum was significantly less than the claimed €193,000. The district court ruled that the actors had been underpaid but that the claimed sum was disproportional to the screentime that the actors had had in series.

<doc id="733365" wikidata="Q2911602" url="?curid=733365" title="Fallacy of exclusive premises">
<text>The fallacy of exclusive premises is a syllogistic fallacy committed in a categorical syllogism that is invalid because both of its premises are negative.

Example of an [[Syllogism#Types|EOO-4 type]] invalid syllogism

:E Proposition: No cats are dogs.
:O Proposition: Some dogs are not pets.
:O Proposition: Therefore, some pets are not cats.

Explanation of Example 1:
:This may seem like a logical conclusion, as it appears to be logically derived that if Some dogs are not pets, then surely some are pets, otherwise, the premise would have stated &quot;No Dogs are pets&quot;, and if some pets are dogs, then not all pets can be cats, thus, some pets are not cats. But if this assumption is applied to the final statement then we have drawn the conclusion: some pets are cats. But this is not supported by either premise. Cats not being dogs, and the state of dogs as either pets or not, has nothing to do with whether cats are pets. Two negative premises cannot give a logical foundation for a conclusion, as they will invariably be independent statements that cannot be directly related, thus the name &#x27;Exclusive Premises&#x27;. It is made more clear when the subjects in the argument are more clearly unrelated such as the following:

Additional Example of an EOO-4 invalid syllogism

:E Proposition: No planets are dogs.
:O Proposition: Some dogs are not pets.
:O Proposition: Therefore, some pets are not planets.

Explanation of Example 2:
:In this example we can more clearly see that the physical difference between a dog and a planet is not causally linked to the domestication of dogs. The two premises are exclusive and the subsequent conclusion is nonsense, as the transpose would imply that some pets are planets.

Conclusion:
:The verisimilitude of the final statement is not relevant in this fallacy. The conclusions in both examples are uncontroversial; however, both are argued on fallacious logic and would not hold up as valid arguments.

<text>Alfred Clair Haynes (August 31, 1931 – August 25, 2019) was an American airline pilot who flew for United Airlines for 35 years. In 1989 he came to international attention as the captain of United Airlines Flight 232, which crashed in Sioux City, Iowa, after suffering a total loss of controls. Having recovered and returned to service as a pilot, Haynes retired from United Airlines in 1991, and subsequently became a public speaker for aviation safety.

==Early life==
Al Haynes was born on August 31, 1931, at the family home in Paris, Texas. He was the third child to Herbert Clair Haynes (1896–1972) and Fannie Temperance Baker (1896–1991). His father worked as a district manager of a telephone company and his mother was a homemaker. By 1940, the family relocated to Dallas, Texas, where Haynes attended Woodrow Wilson High School. Haynes graduated from Texas A&amp;M College (now Texas A&amp;M University) prior to joining the United States Marine Corps. He became a first lieutenant and was an instructor pilot. He served until 1956 and then joined United Airlines, which was his employer for the next 35 years. He retired in 1991.

==Career==

===Military career===

Haynes lost his draft deferment while taking a semester off from Texas A&amp;M, while the United States was engaged in the Korean War, and decided to join the U.S. Marine Corps. He spent four years in the Marine Corps, serving as a pilot.

===United Airlines flying career===

In 1956, Haynes joined United Airlines after his wartime service. For most of his career with United Airlines he served as a flight engineer or co-pilot, refusing offers of promotion, because they would have required relocating from Seattle. However, in 1985, he did accept a promotion to captain, because he would be approaching retirement soon, and his retirement pay would be based upon his pay during his last five years.

On July 19, 1989, Haynes was the Captain of United Airlines Flight 232, piloting a DC-10, a large trijet airliner, carrying 296 passengers and crew. The airplane had left Denver for Chicago, with a final destination of Philadelphia, but experienced a catastrophic engine failure in its rear engine (#2), which triggered a loss of hydraulic fluid. Without hydraulic fluid Haynes and his flight crew could not move the airplane&#x27;s flaps and rudder or almost any other control surfaces.

Without flight controls the airplane began a right descending turn, a tendency that persisted for the rest of the flight. Haynes reduced the thrust on the left engine (#1), allowing differential thrust from the right engine (#3) to level the aircraft. An off-duty pilot, Dennis Edward Fitch, joined Haynes and his co-pilot, William Roy Records, and flight engineer Dudley Joseph Dvorak, on the flight deck.

The airplane was diverted to Sioux City for an emergency landing. With very limited ability to control the airplane, Haynes had difficulty aligning with a runway, reducing speed and landing nose-up. Consequently, the airplane approached the runway at almost twice the desired landing speed, resulting in a very hard landing, with catastrophic damage to the airframe. The airplane then broke into pieces as it slid off the runway, with the remaining fuel bursting into flames. As can be heard in the cockpit flight recording, it was the intervention of Fitch that ultimately got the airplane to the airport.

One hundred-eighty-four people survived the crash-landing while 32 died of smoke inhalation and 80 died of traumatic injuries. Haynes and his colleagues were trapped in the cockpit. Thirty-five minutes after the crash-landing, rescuers identified the cockpit and rescued the flight crew. Most had minor injuries, apart from Denny Fitch, who almost died, having suffered multiple fractures and other organ injuries.

Haynes believed five factors contributed to the degree of success in Sioux City; luck, communications, preparation, execution, and cooperation.

Haynes resumed flight duty after his recovery.

===Career after United Airlines===

According to NPR, &quot;Haynes is widely seen as a hero among aviation experts, akin to Chesley &quot;Sully&quot; Sullenberger and his &#x27;miracle on the Hudson.&#x27;&quot;

He was also a volunteer umpire for Little League Baseball for more than 33 years and a stadium announcer for high school football for more than 25 years. He was an umpire in the 1978 Little League World Series.

He was referred to as a hero, but refused to say he was one. He gave all the credit to the flight attendants, who he believed did not receive enough credit for the work they did.

==Awards==
* Smithsonian Wall of Honor
* Dr. Earl Weiner Award

==Death==
Haynes died on August 25, 2019, in a Seattle hospital after a brief illness, six days before his 88th birthday. 
United Airlines issued a statement thanking him for &quot;his exceptional efforts aboard Flight UA232&quot;.

<doc id="733368" wikidata="Q2196544" url="?curid=733368" title="Lockheed (character)">
<text>Lockheed is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character appears most commonly in association with the X-Men. He is an alien dragon and the longtime companion of Kitty Pryde, a member of the X-Men and Excalibur.

Lockheed makes sporadic minor appearances in X-Men related animated television series and made his live-action debut in the 2020 film &quot;The New Mutants&quot;.

==Publication history==

Lockheed was created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Paul Smith and first appeared in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #166 (February 1983).

==Fictional character biography==
In &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; # 153, &quot;Kitty&#x27;s Fairy Tale&quot;, Kitty Pryde, the teenage member of the X-Men, tells a bedtime story to young Illyana Rasputin, who was living with the X-Men at the time. The story recasts the X-Men, including the recently deceased Jean Grey, in the roles of fairy tale characters. One such character was a black dragon named &quot;Lockheed&quot;, who was based on the X-Men&#x27;s modified Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird jet aircraft.

Not long afterward, the X-Men are captured by the alien race, the Brood, and taken to a Brood-colonized planet. Here, Kitty meets a purple dragon who resembles the creature from her fairy tale, which she also names &quot;Lockheed&quot;. Lockheed is actually a member of an advanced dragon-like alien race whose society is similar to insect hives. Lockheed had been celebrated by his people as a brave fighter and hero against the Brood, but had demonstrated individual attitudes and wishes which were realized only when he encountered the X-Men.

Lockheed saves Kitty from the Brood, and then secretly departs along with her. She, as well as Professor X and her teammates, are unaware of his presence in the X-Mansion until he again saves Kitty&#x27;s life from a nest of alien Sidrian hunter hatchlings. The X-Men accept his presence, and Lockheed has since become Kitty&#x27;s longtime companion.

To a lesser degree, Lockheed also bonds with Illyana Rasputin, who, after being abducted into the dimension of Limbo (also known as Otherplace) by the sorcerer Belasco, had aged into a teenager, manifested her own mutant powers, and been installed as Kitty&#x27;s roommate. Lockheed occasionally accompanies Illyana after she joins the X-Men&#x27;s &quot;junior team&quot;, the New Mutants, including an adventure where the two encounter Brood-controlled clones of the X-Men.

===Secret Wars===
During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; the X-Men, including Lockheed, are transported to an alien planet nicknamed &quot;Battleworld&quot;. There Lockheed meets a green, female alien dragon, supposedly created by the Beyonder&#x27;s lingering power. This second dragon accompanied Lockheed and his allies to Earth, but she grew to gigantic size upon arrival and rampaged across Tokyo. She seemingly vanished from existence when Lockheed rejected her, though she eventually resurfaced. In the companion series &quot;Spider-Man and the Secret Wars&quot;, it is shown that Lockheed spent some time patrolling Denver, Colorado, which had been taken to Battleworld as well, protecting its citizens from alien attack.

===Excalibur===
In addition to serving with the X-Men alongside Kitty, he joins her when she co-founds the British superhero team Excalibur. There he would form a friendship with Widget.

Lockheed participates in the so-called Cross-Time Caper, which involves him and his teammates leaping through dimensions on a train. The train itself is from an alternate universe, and it is discovered that its power source is an alternate version of Lockheed himself. The two Lockheeds become good friends, although the other Lockheed desires to stay on the train. Lockheed travels with the team (and their ally, Alistaire Stuart) on several adventures throughout multiple realities. The team also encounters a humanoid version of Lockheed. He and a female Nightcrawler analogue together adopt the identity of Captain Britain, protecting the citizens of a magic-heavy planet. Near the end of the Caper, Lockheed and the team believe Kitty to be lost in the dimensions; in reality she had been transported home far earlier than the rest of the group. The intervention of Saturnyne allows the team to return home.

Eventually, Lockheed&#x27;s decision to leave with Kitty and the X-Men comes back to haunt him. By leaving so unexpectedly, he had abandoned his fiancée, whom he had been due to wed the following day. While healing from injuries gained from fighting Doctor Doom, his astral form is apprehended by the Flock and made to stand trial for treason. After managing to explain his motives and saving his fellows from a piloting accident, he is officially exiled from his race, but on amicable terms.

Lockheed&#x27;s affections for Kitty earn him the ire of interdimensional entities called Bamfs, characters from the fairy tale Kitty once told Illyana. Like Lockheed, these were real as well. These small versions of Nightcrawler also love Kitty, in their own way. At one point, jealous of Lockheed&#x27;s relationship with Kitty, they invade the tunnels under Muir Island and hold him prisoner for some time. Lockheed&#x27;s penchant for hiding after Kitty moves did not help his situation, as Kitty simply thought he was again being difficult.

Lockheed develops a severe distaste for the secret agent Pete Wisdom, Kitty&#x27;s love interest. Lockheed demonstrates that he has the ability to speak, but only talks to Wisdom, telling him that he &quot;hates him&quot;. Wisdom tells Kitty about this, but she believes he is only joking, and he suffers the frequent theft of his clothing and cigarettes. Even so, Lockheed does save Wisdom&#x27;s life at one point, although he tells the Londoner &quot;I &quot;still&quot; &#x27;ate yoo&quot;. It appears that one reason Lockheed dislikes Wisdom so much is that he much prefers Kitty&#x27;s previous boyfriend, Colossus. This is demonstrated at the wedding of Captain Britain and Meggan, when Lockheed attempts to help them reconnect by snatching the bride&#x27;s garter and dropping it into Piotr&#x27;s hands just after Kitty had won Meggan&#x27;s bouquet.

Later, after Kitty left Excalibur and the X-Men entirely, it is believed that Lockheed had died. In reality, Lockheed had been found, wounded and confused, by a pair of girls who practiced witchcraft. He bonds with them until he discovers that the girls use their abilities to terrorize the local populace. The duo were soon humiliated in battle by their rival, another young girl with powers. This new friend heals Lockheed and directs him back to Kitty.

===Back on the X-Men===
Kitty eventually rejoins the X-Men and Lockheed happily follows. When the X-Men battle the alien Ord, Lockheed saves the day with his fire breath.

Lockheed becomes part of a training exercise for the younger students at Xavier&#x27;s institute. He was the &quot;flag&quot; in a game of Capture the Flag, hiding in the middle of the hedge maze. This created problems because many of the students found it hard to actually believe in a living, miniature dragon; the mutant Wither ended up endangering Lockheed with his organic-destruction powers.

Lockheed attempts to help the X-Men stop the Hulk in &quot;World War Hulk&quot;, but was defeated with the rest of the team.

===Agent of S.W.O.R.D.===
It is revealed that Lockheed is a mole within the Institute for S.W.O.R.D. Abigail Brand, S.W.O.R.D.&#x27;s Director later told Kitty to stop coddling the dragon like a &quot;starlet&#x27;s chihuahua&quot;, that he was an informant in exchange for S.W.O.R.D.&#x27;s help with pressing issues on his homeworld, and that he could speak more languages than the X-Men&#x27;s resident genius, the Beast. The shocked team looked on as Lockheed flew away from Kitty. The X-Men then join forces with S.W.O.R.D. in an attempt to end the confrontation with the alien race of Breakworld, who are attempting to destroy Earth with a giant missile. Kitty is assigned with the team appointed to stop the missile, while Lockheed is forced to remain behind. The two share a final lingering look before Kitty leaves. It is revealed that the missile is actually a giant bullet, and Kitty becomes trapped in it phasing it through the Earth. While grieving over Kitty, Lockheed drinks heavily to help with the pain. Eventually Abigail Brand reveals that Kitty is still alive within the bullet but they can&#x27;t get her out yet. Lockheed then approaches a villain named Unit for help, but after learning that he would have to free Unit from prison changes his mind and leaves.

Kitty and Lockheed reunite in &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; (vol. 3) #38. He has since joined her at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. A brochure included at the end of &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot; #1 states that he teaches a class entitled &quot;Knowing Your Alien Races, And How To Kill Them&quot;.

===&quot;Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers&quot;===
In the mini-series &quot;Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers&quot;, Lockheed teams up with Lockjaw (the teleporting bulldog from the Inhumans), Redwing, Zabu, Niels the Cat/Hairball (who gained the same powers as Speedball during the same incident), a frog Thor, and Ms. Lion (May Parker&#x27;s pet dog from &quot;Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends&quot;) on a quest for the Infinity Gems. He expresses great grief over the loss of Kitty, and his estrangement from his homeworld. In another instance, he expresses feelings of guilt over acting as a mole for S.W.O.R.D, stating that he had already &quot;betrayed too many friends and allies in the past&quot;. Lockheed is given the Time Gem during this adventure.

=== X-Men Gold ===
Lockheed attends Kitty&#x27;s wedding rehearsal dinner, bringing along his dragon family.

==Powers and abilities==
Lockheed looks like a small European dragon about the size of a cat. He has purple skin, sharp claws and teeth, two small, curved horns protruding from the back of his head, and wings that enable him to fly. He can breathe extremely intense fire and is a surprisingly formidable combatant for his size, having once destroyed a nest of Sidri hatchlings and at another time bested a fully armored medieval knight-in-training. The Brood that he confronted upon his first appearance were terrified and immediately fled upon seeing him. His brain is immune to telepathic probing by telepaths such as Professor X. He is empathic, able to understand human speech, and although he rarely does so is able to speak English as well.

==Reception==
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Lockheed 68th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.
* In 2021, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Lockheed 3rd in their &quot;10 Smartest Marvel Sidekicks&quot; list.
* In 2022, &quot;Newsarama&quot; ranked Lockheed 9th in their &quot;Best superhero sidekicks of all time&quot; list.

==Character evolution==
Lockheed&#x27;s appearance and character, as depicted by the various artists who illustrated him and writer Chris Claremont, evolved from the time of his first appearance to his later appearances in &quot;Excalibur&quot;. When he first appeared as drawn by Paul Smith, he was largely quadrupedal, with monochromatic red eyes, a triangular head, and dog-like intelligence. By the time of his appearances in Excalibur as drawn by Alan Davis, he possesses a more anthropomorphic design with an oblong head, black eyes, and a longer jaw

Lockheed is capable of speech, but initially did not display the ability to do so. Additionally, only Kitty Pryde and some others can understand him.

<text>Keel is the fourth album by the American rock band Keel, released in June 1987. This was the last album to feature guitarists Marc Ferrari and Bryan Jay, as they left the band a year later (although Jay can be heard on the live portion of the band&#x27;s next release, &quot;Larger Than Live&quot;.) They eventually re-joined Keel in 1998 to release &quot;Keel VI: Back in Action&quot; and again in 2009 for the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

This was the band&#x27;s first album since their 1984 debut &quot;Lay Down the Law&quot; to be produced by someone other than Gene Simmons. &quot;Calm Before the Storm&quot; was co-written by Jimmy Bain of Dio and Rainbow fame.

<doc id="733397" wikidata="Q696722" url="?curid=733397" title="Saab 91 Safir">
<text>The Saab 91 Safir (Swedish for sapphire) is a three (91A, B, B-2) or four (91C, D) seater, single engine trainer aircraft. The Safir was built by Saab AB in Linköping, Sweden (203 aircraft) and by &quot;De Schelde&quot; in Dordrecht, Netherlands (120 aircraft).

==Design and development==
Development of the Safir began in 1944 as part of a plan to compensate for reductions in orders for military aircraft, in anticipation of the end of the Second World War. Three major civil programmes were planned, the Type 90 Scandia airliner, the Type 91 Safir light aircraft and the Saab 92 motor car. The Safir was designed by Anders J. Andersson, who had previously worked for Bücker, where he had designed the all-wood Bücker Bü 181 &quot;Bestmann&quot;. The Safir thus shared many conceptual design features with the Bestmann. It was primarily of metal construction, although it did have fabric-covered control surfaces. Development was slowed by the need to concentrate on more urgent military work, and by industrial action among suppliers. The Safir&#x27;s first flight took place on 20 November 1945.

While the prototype was first powered by a four cylinder de Havilland Gipsy Major IC piston engine, the Saab 91A initial production model used a Gipsy Major 10. The Gipsy-engine Safir was considered underpowered by military customers, and as a result, the Gipsy was replaced by a six-cylinder Lycoming O-435A rated at , with the re-engined type becoming the Saab 91B, flying on 18 January 1949. The Saab 91C, first flying in September 1953, retained the O-435 engine, but has a revised four-seat cabin. The 91D replaced the O-435 with a lighter four-cylinder Lycoming O-360-A1A engine rated at .

As well as its primary role as a trainer/touring aircraft, the Safir was used as an aerodynamic testbed. The first prototype was used as a platform for low speed testing of the swept wing for Saab 29 jet fighter, and was later further modified to test the wing for the Saab 32 Lansen fighter. In addition, one ex-Swedish aircraft was sold to Japan, going through a variety of modifications to test high-lift devices for the Shin Meiwa PS-1 flying boat.

==Operational history==

Production of the Saab 91A began in 1946, but sales were slow owing to the large numbers of cheap ex-military trainers for sale after the end of the Second World War. Major users of the 91A were the Swedish and Ethiopian Air Forces. In 1951, Sweden ordered 74 91B trainers to replace its remaining Bestmanns, but Saab was busy building J29 Tunnan fighters, so production of the Saab 91B was moved to the Dutch company De Schelde at their Dordrecht factory. De Schelde continued building the Safir until 1955, completing a total of 120 Saab 91B and 91Cs.

Saab restarted production of the Safir at its Linköping factory in 1954, building 25 Saab 91B-2s for Norway, 30 Saab 91Cs, all for military customers, and 99 Saab 91Ds. Production continued until 1966, when the last Safir, a Saab 91C for Ethiopia, was completed. Total production was 323 aircraft including the prototype.
The Safir was used by the Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Austrian, Tunisian, and Ethiopian air forces as a trainer aircraft, and a single aircraft was used by the Japan Defense Agency as an STOL test platform. The type remained in Norwegian and Finnish service until the late 1980s, and in Austria until 1992. While it was replaced as a trainer by the Scottish Aviation Bulldog in Sweden in 1971, it remained in use as a liaison aircraft, still being in service in 1994.

Major civilian users were Air France, Lufthansa and the Dutch &quot;Rijksluchtvaartschool&quot; (RLS) on the Groningen Airport Eelde, near Groningen.

During development of the Saab 29, the initial Saab 91 prototype was modified with a scaled-down version of the Saab 29&#x27;s swept wings; this aircraft was designated Saab 201 Experimental Aircraft. This same airframe was later fitted with wings designed for the Saab 32 Lansen; this was designated Saab 202.

A single Saab 91 Safir was modified as the Saab X1G for research in Japan.

<doc id="733410" wikidata="Q2663986" url="?curid=733410" title="Aurora (comics)">
<text>Aurora () (Jeanne-Marie Beaubier) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, the character first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #120 (April 1979). Aurora is a member of the Canadian superhero team, Alpha Flight.

Aurora is the twin sister of Northstar and the former lover of Sasquatch and Wild Child. The character struggled with a dissociative identity disorder for years leading to two distinctive personalities: the quiet, religious Jeanne-Marie and the outgoing, heroic, uninhibited Aurora. Aurora and Northstar worked together for years as part of Alpha Flight, including dealing with Beaubier&#x27;s struggles with her personality disorders. She was briefly a member of the X-Men and also participated in the Weapon X program in an attempt to gain control of her splintered personalities.

During the &quot;Chaos War&quot; storyline, Aurora, alongside Northstar, Sasquatch, and Snowbird are reunited with a resurrected Guardian, Vindicator, Shaman, and Marrina, reforming Alpha Flight.

==Publication history==
Aurora first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #120 (April 1979) as a member of Alpha Flight, and was created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne.

==Fictional character biography==
Jeanne-Marie Beaubier was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. She and her twin brother Jean-Paul were separated in infancy after their parents died. Jean-Paul was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Louis Martin, who were cousins of his mother. The Martins could not afford to adopt Jeanne-Marie as well and arranged for Jeanne-Marie to be raised at Madame DuPont&#x27;s School for Girls in Laval, Quebec, a reactionary religious school. Soon afterward, the Martins moved to Northern Quebec. The Martins were killed in an accident several years later and Jean-Paul was placed in a foster home, unaware that he had a sister.

Extremely nervous and introverted, Jeanne-Marie Beaubier was miserable at Madame DuPont&#x27;s School. At the age of thirteen, she attempted suicide by throwing herself from the roof of one of the school&#x27;s buildings. Instead of falling to her death, Beaubier discovered that she could fly at great speed. Unaware that she was a mutant, the deeply religious Beaubier believed that her flight was the result of a divine miracle. The next morning, she explained to the school&#x27;s headmistress what she believed had happened. Believing the young girl to be guilty of blasphemy, the headmistress had Beaubier severely disciplined. This incident (and possibly other abuse) triggered a dissociative identity disorder in Jeanne-Marie; a second personality, extroverted and far more uninhibited, emerged. Under the influence of this second personality, Beaubier secretly left the school that same night. Returning three days later, she had no memory of where she had been or what she had done and she was again physically punished. The resulting trauma was so great that Beaubier repressed her second personality.

===Alpha Flight===
Five years later, Beaubier&#x27;s application to become a teacher of history and geography at the school was accepted. By this time, Beaubier had adjusted to life at the school and her everyday personality was that of a prim, proper, repressed woman. The same night that her application was accepted, her second personality re-emerged and she left to enjoy herself in Montreal. Confronted by muggers, she knocked one unconscious by moving at superhuman speed (this was the first time that she had used her superhuman powers in five years). The second mugger was halted by Wolverine, who had witnessed the attempted assault. Recognizing that Beaubier had superhuman powers, Wolverine invited her to go to Ottawa to meet James MacDonald Hudson, who was organizing a team of superhumanly powerful agents for the Canadian government&#x27;s Department H. Hudson accepted her as a recruit and reunited her with her brother. After a period of training, both Beaubier siblings joined the team that Hudson created, Alpha Flight, under the code names Aurora and Northstar.

On Alpha Flight&#x27;s first mission, Aurora aided in combating the X-Men to capture Wolverine. With Northstar, she battled Deadly Ernest. She later recounted how she developed her superhuman powers and developed her Aurora personality, and how Wolverine recruited her into Alpha Flight, as well as how she met Northstar. Aurora later had a falling out with her brother, and upon her wish to separate herself from her brother, her powers were altered by Walter Langowski. Aurora was captured by Gilded Lily, but was rescued by Sasquatch, who began to suspect that she was manifesting a third personality. With Northstar, she battled Pink Pearl.

She was later temporarily cured of her multiple personalities. Alongside the X-Men and Alpha Flight, she battled Loki. She was again attacked by Gilded Lily. Aurora was captured by Box, who had gone insane, but was later rescued by Alpha Flight. Loki deceived Aurora into believing that her mother had been an Asgardian Light Elf. The team brought her and Northstar to the place where they once encountered a magical Firefountain; they wanted to heal her mind and Northstar&#x27;s body. During a battle with dark elves, she cured her brother by giving him all of her light. She was carried off by the elves, but Loki (in an attempt to curry favor with Those Who Sit Above In Shadow) transported her to a convent for safety, who took her in.

Talisman later came to Jeanne-Marie at the convent and transported her to Asgard along with Persuasion, Goblyn and Laura Dean to help rescue Northstar in Alfheim. He had gone to Asgard to explore their half-elf heritage, only to discover that Loki lied about it. Northstar had been trapped on Asgard for months. In battle, Northstar shared the light with Aurora and restored her powers. After their battle with the sorcerer LLan, she rejoined Alpha Flight. Aurora soon discovered that she could now generate a light that bestowed inner peace in others. With Alpha Flight and the Fantastic Four, she fought against Headlok. Headlok mentally manipulated her, causing her to revert to her original split personality, and she then killed Headlok. She soon thereafter had a rematch with Pink Pearl. Eventually, the original incarnation of Alpha Flight disbanded.

===Resurfacing and rehabilitation===
In the events leading up her reappearance in &quot;Weapon X&quot; vol. 2, Aurora&#x27;s mental health continues to deteriorate and she is later turned into a mind controlled agent of Weapon X. She also engages in an abusive relationship with the Weapon X director, Malcolm Colcord, who frequently beat her. Aurora manages to retaliate against her mind-control by creating a third personality that was unaffected by her situation. She attacks Colcord and manages to escape. In her next appearance, Aurora&#x27;s mental state becomes unstable to the point that all her personalities agree that suicide is the best solution. She is stopped by the arrival of Northstar, who is under the control of the Children of the Vault, a mysterious group of newly emerged superhumans who seek to destroy mutants, viewing them to be their competition for dominance of the planet. One of the Children, Serafina, places the twins under their control, largely repairing Aurora&#x27;s fragile psyche, boosting the twins&#x27; powers and altering them so that they can generate not only light when in contact with each other, but heat as well.

The twins are sent on a mission to attack the X-Men and retrieve Sabretooth for the Children of the Vault. The twins are able to defeat several of the X-Men and New X-Men until Mystique is able to exploit Aurora&#x27;s shattered psyche by taking on her image. Iceman manages to incapacitate Aurora while Cable subdues Northstar.

The X-Men take Northstar and Aurora to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier in an attempt to fix the mental damage inflicted on the twins. Using their virtual reality equipment the X-Men allowed the twins to relive their lives at an accelerated pace. The process was interrupted near the end of the session by Exodus, creating a telepathic connection between the twins. Using each other&#x27;s emotional support, they manage to face their inner personal turmoils and regain control of their minds. Aurora and Northstar also gain a higher level of control over their powers, which they use to save Rogue from the Acolyte known as Frenzy.

They later reappear in the mini-crossover series &quot;Secret Invasion: X-Men&quot;, joining the X-Men when the Skrull invasion reaches San Francisco.

Aurora next appears in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, having formed a snowsporting company with Northstar, Team Northstar Extreme Snowsports. Aurora appears to be living a relatively normal life since regaining control of her mind, working as the joint CEO of the company. She is contacted by Wolverine when he wishes to extend an invitation to Northstar to join X-Men on Utopia.

During one of Aurora&#x27;s therapy sessions to deal with her disorder, she is given a device to wear on her head for tests, when in actuality, her therapist was bribed by Norman Osborn to use it on her so he could speak with her more dark and violent personality about joining his Dark X-Men. Jeanne-Marie, though, does not care to take orders from anyone, least of all someone who is just as broken as herself, and goes to leave, before he turns the device on her again, saying he does not take no for an answer. However, Aurora brings up another personality to combat the guards, and brings up more for each time the device is used on her, before she is able to turn it on Osborn himself and walk away.

During the &quot;Chaos War&quot; storyline, Aurora alongside Northstar, Sasquatch, and Snowbird are reunited with a resurrected Guardian, Vindicator, Shaman, and Marrina Smallwood.

As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; event, Aurora appears as a member of the Alpha Flight space program.

===Dawn of X===
As part of Dawn of X, Aurora was one of the many mutants that joined the mutant nation of Krakoa. Aurora and her brother Northstar were later sent on a flyover scouting mission to investigate a strange island that mysteriously appeared off the southern coast of Krakoa. In their report they mentioned the island being full of giant hostile beasts.

Some time later, Northstar strangely felt his connection to his sister evaporate. He immediately heads to the hatchery to try and get Aurora resurrected but unfortunately he needs proof of death to start the reincarnation process. Northstar then seeks to find out where his sister could have gone. He enters the Green Lagoon Tiki Bar to see what the bartender may know but ultimately runs into Polaris. Polaris suggests they form an investigative team to head to Vancouver where she was last seen. They recruit the repowered Prodigy, Prestige, Eye-Boy and Daken. Using Aurora&#x27;s social media, they are able to discover she had been into a motel where she seemed to had a rendezvous with a man. She then got into a car and drove off a side of the road. Using Eye-boy&#x27;s powers, they are able to find the car and the body. They then present the case to the Quiet Council. It seems that the man who Aurora was meeting set up a trap for her that caused her car to be thrown off the side of the bridge. After figuring out the cause of death, the Five decide to bring this group together under Northstar to form X-Factor.

==Powers and abilities==

Aurora has the powers of flight and superhuman speed and reflexes (theoretically able to approach light-speed. This has never been attempted since if any being or amount of matter were to approach the speed of light in our solar system, it would wreak devastating havoc on the gravitational forces holding our system together). The greater her increase in speed, the more durable her body becomes, but this ability has not been measured.

She also has super-human levels of endurance and stamina that allows her to maintain her super-speed. In an early issue of &quot;Alpha Flight&quot;, Northstar reveals to readers that Aurora has greater endurance and can fly longer, while he can fly faster in the same period of time. Her strength and reaction time are above-average for a woman of her age and exercise level, yet Aurora usually does not rely on her physical strength while battling opponents, instead using super-speed tricks, like flying someone at great speed until they pass out from lack of oxygen or pummeling them with hundreds of punches a second until they succumb. Aurora also uses her super speed to perform stunts such as creating a cyclone by running in circles, running up walls and across water. She has been shown to breathe while traveling at subsonic speeds.

Originally, while in physical contact with her brother, usually while holding hands, the pair could emit bursts of brilliant white light with an average flash equal in intensity of one million candela. It was generally used to blind their opponents, with the drawback that they could not control its intensity. Experiments performed on Aurora by Walter Langowski enabled her to generate light independently from Northstar, rendering the side effect that physical contact between the two would temporarily neutralize their powers. Her speed was also greatly reduced to only fly at the speed of sound. With her recent resurrection in a new body, these modifications are gone, enabling the siblings to generate light together and restoring Aurora&#x27;s previous levels of speed.

Aurora is moderately skilled in hand-to-hand combat using a style utilizing her superhuman speed, and received coaching from Puck and Wolverine.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked Aurora 2nd in their &quot;10 Fastest X-Men In Marvel Comics&quot; list, and 8th in their &quot;12 Fastest Superheroes Of All Time&quot; list. Rohan Pendurkar of &quot;Sportskeeda&quot; ranked Aurora 3rd in their &quot;5 fastest characters in comic history&quot; list. &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Aurora 9th in their &quot;Marvel: The 20 Fastest Speedsters&quot; list, 9th in their &quot;10 Most Powerful Members of Canada’s Avengers&quot; list, and 19th in their &quot;25 Fastest Characters In The Marvel Universe&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; reality, Northstar and Aurora were part of Mister Sinister&#x27;s Elite Mutant Force (E.M.F.) and, as such, were assigned to patrolling the breeding pens. The siblings fully embraced their beliefs of mutant superiority and seemed to take great pleasure in punishing those prisoners who acted up or tried to escape. When the E.M.F.&#x27;s leader, Cyclops, switched sides, secretly helping some inmates to escape, he was caught in the act by the speeding twins. However, both of them were defeated by Cyclops and the prisoner he was helping to escape, which happened to be Polaris. When the series was revisited for the 10 year anniversary, it was revealed that following the fall of Apocalypse&#x27;s regime, the Beaubiers became fugitives until they were killed by Weapon X and Kirika.

===Age of X===
In the &quot;Age of X&quot; reality, the deceased Aurora is the motivation of her brother&#x27;s attempts to kill Kitty Pryde.

===Earth X===
In Earth X, Aurora is still a member of Alpha Flight and killed alongside her team by the Tong of Creel.

===House of M===
In the &quot;House of M&quot; reality, a woman similar to Aurora is seen with Northstar who is an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D, responsible for training a squad of young mutants and superhumans in the agency&#x27;s junior training squad program. However, she is only seen briefly.

===Marvel Zombies===
In the &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; comics set in the universe of Earth-2149, the zombified Alpha Flight attack the X-Men and are eventually killed by Magneto. Aurora is seen in a panel of &quot;Marvel Zombies Dead Days&quot; attacking the X-Man Storm alongside her brother Northstar. The two are killed by Magneto only moments later.

===Ultimate Marvel===
An Ultimate Marvel version of Aurora makes her debut in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #94 as part of Alpha Flight. Like her mainstream counterpart, she is the sister of Northstar. The two seem to share a distant relationship, because Aurora still works for Department H, somewhere that Jean-Paul ran from claiming they were crazy. She is the one who physically takes her brother captive. Her power seemed to be speed based, but, according to her and due to being enhanced by the Mutant Growth Hormone known as Banshee, she is faster than light; something which she proved by being able to remove Colossus&#x27; grip on their jet without him being aware of it. Later, when the X-Men attack their base to rescue Northstar, she is quickly taken down by Dazzler, who has also enhanced her abilities with Banshee.

===Weapon X: Days of Future Now===
In the &quot;Weapon X: Days of Future Now&quot; storyline, Aurora is one of the mutants that Wolverine recruits in order to resurrect the X-Men after all except himself and Angel were killed by Weapon X under Malcolm Colcord. She joins Wolverine&#x27;s new, more violent X-Men along with Juggernaut, Deadpool, Mystique, Sunfire, Archangel, and Agent Zero.

She is killed along with Mystique, Sunfire, and Deadpool, when it is revealed that Agent Zero has been made into a sleeper agent for Weapon X through the use of Mesmero&#x27;s mutant hypnotic abilities. He ambushes his teammates in their base, killing or severely wounding them with gunfire and his concussive energy blasts. Eventually, he takes his own life when he manages to break free of Weapon X&#x27;s control, moments before killing Wolverine.

===What If?===
In a &quot;What If&quot; story that asks &quot;What If Cyclops and Jean Gray Had Married Sooner&quot;, Professor X recruited Aurora as part of a new team of X-Men when his originals all left his teaching years earlier than expected. She, Northstar, Catseye, Colossus and Storm trained briefly before they and the professor were all killed fighting Krakoa the living island. The Avengers stopped Krakoa, and when they blew it apart, they discovered the X-Men&#x27;s bodies.

===X-Men: The End===
In the &quot;X-Men: The End&quot; universe, Aurora&#x27;s image appears as a spirit to her brother.

<doc id="733416" wikidata="Q883907" url="?curid=733416" title="San Marcos Department">
<text>San Marcos is a department in southwestern Guatemala, on the Pacific Ocean and along the western Guatemala-Mexico border.

The department&#x27;s capital is the city of San Marcos.

==History==

===Colonial period===
The Spanish conquest of Guatemalan Highlands occurred in the 1520s, followed by the establishment of the Province of Tecusitlán and Lacandón within the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Candacuchex, a settlement of the Mayan Mam people, became the site of the city of San Marcos, established in 1533.

In 1546, once the Guatemalan archdiocese was established, bishop Francisco Marroquín split the ecclesiastical duties in the region among the Order of Preachers, Franciscans and Mercedarians, being the latter appointed to take care of &quot;El Barrio&quot; (in present-day San Marcos and Huehuetenango Departments), which was then a part of the Province of Quetzaltenango]. In 1609 the Captaincy General of Guatemala was established.

In 1690, the Tejutla &quot;curato&quot; had a large area and included the modern municipalities of Comitancillo, Ixchiguán, Concepción Tutuapa, Sipacapa, Sibinal, Tajumulco, Tacaná and part of what is now San Miguel Ixtahuacán. According to the historical writings from &quot;Recordación Florida&quot; of Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán, Tejutla belonged to Quetzaltenango Department and it was a &quot;prosperous land with rich weathers and comfortable forest with enough water&quot;.

Tejutla was an important commercial and religious center; in August 1767, Joseph Domingo Hidalgo described Santiago Tejutla as &quot;El Curato&quot; -i.e., the focal center of commerce of all the towns that were around it− in the &quot;Gaceta de Guatemala&quot;, the official newspaper of the times. Then, in the last quarter of the 18th century, bishop Dr. Pedro Cortés y Larraz, who arrived from Cuilco in 1770 as part of the inspection he was doing of the Guatemalan dioceses, called Tejutla &quot;Santiago en la Cima del Monte&quot; (English: Santiago at the top of the hill&quot; and reported that there were &quot;sixty four families who lived very well&quot; in the area.

In 1754 the Mercedarians gave away their convent to the secular clergy per the Borbonic reforms that were instituted by the King of Spain, and Tejutla became a secular &quot;curato&quot;.

===Independence===
The Act of Independence of Central America was issued in 1821. The Provincial Council of the Province of Guatemala within the Captaincy General of Guatemala proclaimed the independence of Central America from the Spanish Empire. After being annexed by the First Mexican Empire in 1821, the Federal Republic of Central America was founded in 1823, which included the present day San Marcos region of Guatemala.

The department was created by a governmental decree on 8 May 1866, together with Huehuetenango, Izabal and Petén departments. In 1902 the eruption of the Santa María volcano in the neighbouring department of Quetzaltenango was responsible for the destruction of the twin towns of San Marcos and San Pedro Sacatepéquez. The towns were rebuilt and in 1935 were joined to form the new municipality of San Marcos La Unión. This new municipality did not last long and the unified municipalities were again split in 1945 with San Marcos remaining the departmental capital.

===21st century===
Towards the end of the 20th century, San Marcos became a hot spot for drug trafficking in Central America, and one of the top lords was Juan Chamalé Ortiz, who was heavily involved in cocaine trafficking, and was accused by US authorities of helping to move over 40 tons of cocaine through Central America en route to the United States. Ortiz worked with local fishermen to smuggle cocaine in small fishing boats and may have also commissioned semi-submersibles to transport the drug. Ortiz also controlled a major opium poppy producing area, the San Marcos Department, where he was a popular local figure. He owned at least ten estates in his area of operations, including a large farm in Malacatán and provided numerous jobs, in addition to cultivating local support by throwing parties and sponsoring beauty contests.

San Marcos is one of the most important regions in Guatemala given its proximity to the highlands, Mexico, and to the Pacific Ocean coast, where most of the drugs coming from South America land. Ortiz exerted influence over local politicians and police in the region, and relied on a powerful local support network to conduct his business. He is thought to have worked out a deal that made him the Sinaloa Cartel&#x27;s top transporter, helping the Mexican group move drugs that arrived via Pacific routes. Ortiz Chamalé was captured in 2011 in Quetzaltenango and extradited to the United States in 2014 where he was sentenced to 262 months in jail; when Ortiz was arrested in 2011, locals protested to demand his release.

==Geography==

San Marcos is bordered on the northeast by the department of Huehuetenango, on the east by the department of Quetzaltenango, to the south by the department of Retalhuleu and by the Pacific Ocean, and on the west by the Mexican state of Chiapas.

The department has a total territory of .

The northern portion of the department is mountainous, being crossed by the Sierra Madre de Chiapas mountain range. The two highest volcanoes in Central America being located within its borders, Tajumulco ( high) and Tacaná ( high). The Tajumulco volcano is the highest peak in Central America. Other notable peaks include San Antonio Ichiguán at above mean sea level. The southern portion of the department drops away towards the Pacific coast.

The Tacaná volcano, which occupies the border with Mexico and has slopes in both countries, has been historically active, with activity recorded in 1855, 1878, from 1900 through to 1903, from 1949 to 1950 and from 1986 to 1987.

Principal rivers in the department include the Suchiate River, which marks the border between San Marcos and Chiapas, Mexico, and flows into the Pacific Ocean. The Cabuz River has its source on the slopes of the Tajumulco volcano. Other rivers include the El Pajapa, El Rodeo, Ixlamá, Ixtal, Meléndrez, Nahuatán, Tilapa, and Ocosito Rivers.

The climate varies widely within the department, due to the dramatic differences in altitude, with the north possessing a cold Guatemalan Highlands climate and the south having a temperate or hot climate, depending on the specific altitude.

<text>San Marcos is a city and municipality in Guatemala. It is the capital of the department of San Marcos. The municipality has a population of 47,063 (2018 census).

==History==

=== 1897 Quetzaltenango Revolt ===

In September 1897, after the failure of both the interoceanic railroad and the Central American Expo and the deep economic crisis that Guatemala was facing after the plummeting international prices of both coffee and silver, the people of Quetzaltenango raised in arms against the decision of president José María Reina Barrios to extend his presidential term until 1902. A group of rebels, among them a former Secretary of Reina Barrios&#x27;s cabinet -Próspero Morales-, began to combat on 7 September 1897 attacking San Marcos; after several battles and some gains in Ocos, Coatepeque and Colomba the rebels were definitely defeated on 4 October 1897. As a result, on 23 October 1897, San Pedro Sacatepéquez became the capital of San Marcos Department.

=== 20th century ===

In 1903 the eruption of the Santa María volcano in the neighboring department of Quetzaltenango was responsible for the destruction of the twin towns of San Marcos and San Pedro Sacatepéquez. The towns were rebuilt and on 16 December 1935, during the presidency of general Jorge Ubico, it was annexed to San Pedro Sacatepéquez forming the municipality of La Unión San Marcos. However, this system did not work and La Unión San Marcos was broken apart on 20 July 1945, but San Pedro Sacatepéquez lost the capital of San Marcos Department to the municipality of San Marcos.

===21st century===
Towards the end of the 20th century San Marcos became a hot spot for drug trafficking in Central America, and one of the top lords was Juan Chamalé Ortiz, who was heavily involved in cocaine trafficking, and was accused by US authorities of helping to move over 40 tons of cocaine through Central America en route to the United States. Ortiz worked with local fishermen to smuggle cocaine in small fishing boats and may have also commissioned semi-submersibles to transport the drug. Ortiz also controlled a major opium poppy producing area, the San Marcos Department, where he was a popular local figure. He owned at least ten estates in his area of operations, centered in San Marcos city, and provided numerous jobs, in addition to cultivating local support by throwing parties and sponsoring beauty contests.

San Marcos is one of the most important regions in Guatemala given its proximity to the highlands, Mexico and to the Pacific Ocean coast, where most of the drugs coming from South America land. Ortiz exerted influence over local politicians and police in the region, and relied on a powerful local support network to conduct his business. He is thought to have worked out a deal that made him the Sinaloa Cartel&#x27;s top transporter, helping the Mexican group move drugs that arrived via Pacific routes. Ortiz Chamalé was captured in 2011 in Quetzaltenango and extradited to the United States in 2014 where he was sentenced to 262 months in jail; when Ortiz was arrested in 2011, locals protested to demand his release.

==Sports==
The city is home of the football club Deportivo Marquense who play in Guatemala&#x27;s Premier League in the Estadio Marquesa de la Ensenada.

<doc id="733439" wikidata="Q2237108" url="?curid=733439" title="Margarine Unie">
<text>Naamloze Vennootschap Margarine Unie (English: Margarine Union Limited) was a Dutch company formed in 1927 in Oss by the merger of four margarine companies, Antoon Jurgens United, Van den Bergh&#x27;s, Centra, and Schicht&#x27;s. Margarine Unie was the dominant producer of margarine in the UK.

== History ==
The company origins were in Antoon Jurgens United, a company which was founded in 1867 by Antoon Jurgens. The company introduced its manufactured margarine after acquiring the patents and rights to Hippolyte Mège-Mouriès&#x27; invention in 1871. In 1908, production at Antoon Jurgens United was 50,000 tons.

In 1908, Antoon Jurgens United formed a profit-sharing arrangement with Van den Bergh&#x27;s which had been formed by Samuel van den Bergh and which, like Antoon Jurgens United, was based in the town of Oss, Netherlands.

Schicht&#x27;s was founded by Georg Schicht whose son Johann Schicht was a German Bohemian entrepreneur and owner of a large soap-making plant.

Naamloze Vennootschap Margarine Unie (English: Margarine Union Limited) was formed in 1927 in Rotterdam by the merger of four margarine companies, Antoon Jurgens United, Van den Bergh&#x27;s, Centra, and Schicht&#x27;s. The merged entity acquired the interests of Van den Bergh&#x27;s in England (Margarine Union Limited) and those of Van den Bergh&#x27;s and Antoon Jurgens United in the Netherlands (N.V. Margarine Unie). The companies were set up in an agreement under which the shareholders benefited as if they had shares in a single company.

Margarine Unie operated until 1930 when it merged with the British company Lever Brothers, to form the multinational Unilever.

In 2017, Unilever spun its margarine business off into Upfield (Upfield Europe BV), effectively returning the business to its old base in Rotterdam.

<text>The Aztecs is the sixth serial in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast on BBC1 in four weekly parts from 23 May to 13 June 1964. It was written by John Lucarotti and directed by John Crockett. In the serial, the First Doctor (William Hartnell), his granddaughter Susan (Carole Ann Ford), and teachers Ian Chesterton (William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) arrive in Mexico during the Aztec empire. Barbara becomes mistaken for the goddess Yetaxa, and accepts the identity in hope of persuading the Aztecs to give up human sacrifice, despite the Doctor&#x27;s warnings about changing history.

Lucarotti became fascinated by the Aztec civilisation while living in Mexico, largely due to the Aztec tradition of human sacrifice. He wrote the episodes while his other serial, &quot;Marco Polo&quot;, was in production. Designer Barry Newbery based his set designs on books and documentaries about the Aztecs, though faced difficulty due to the limited information on the civilisation available. Costume designer Daphne Dare used artistic licence with the serial&#x27;s costumes, due to the limited clothing worn by the Aztecs. The serial premiered with 7.9 million viewers, maintaining audience figures throughout the four weeks. Response for the serial was positive, and it has since been described as one of the show&#x27;s greatest stories. It later received several print adaptations and home media releases.

== Plot ==
The TARDIS crew arrive in Mexico in the 15th century. With the TARDIS trapped in a tomb, Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) is mistaken for a female reincarnation of the ancient high priest Yetaxa, and assumes her guise and identity. From her new position of power, Barbara sees her chance to bring an end to human sacrifice. She sees the good side of Aztec culture manifested in Autloc (Keith Pyott), the High Priest of Knowledge, and the gruesome side embodied in the High Priest of Sacrifice, Tlotoxl (John Ringham). As a history teacher, she sees how advanced their culture really is and believes that if sacrifice were abolished, they would be spared destruction at the hands of the Spanish. The urgent warnings of the First Doctor (William Hartnell) that Barbara cannot change history fall on deaf ears, much to his fury.

The bloodthirsty Tlotoxl begins to suspect Barbara is not Yetaxa returned, especially because she is trying to ban human sacrifice. He sets a series of elaborate traps for her and her companions. For example, Ian Chesterton (William Russell) has been compelled into the military and fights the strongest warrior, Ixta (Ian Cullen), to prove his ability to command the Aztec forces. Thus Ixta develops a grudge against Ian and is used by Tlotoxl to try to prove that Barbara is not Yetaxa. The Doctor unwittingly tells Ixta how to defeat Ian in combat using a drugging agent, and this battle nearly ends in the Doctor witnessing his friend&#x27;s death. When this fails to be conclusive, Tlotoxl convinces the subordinate priest Tonila (Walter Randall) to make a poison for Barbara; the death of Barbara following consumption of the poison would prove she is not immortal and therefore not a god. However, Ian silently warns her from his hiding place, and Barbara refuses to drink the poison. She tells Tlotoxl that she is not Yetaxa but warns him not to tell the people.

Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and the Doctor have meanwhile both become involved in marriage-making scenarios: Susan has transgressed Aztec law by refusing to marry the Perfect Victim (André Boulay), who has been scheduled for sacrifice by Tlotoxl on the day of the next eclipse; while the Doctor, who knows little of Aztec customs, has become accidentally engaged to an Aztec woman named Cameca (Margot Van der Burgh) after they shared a cup of cocoa. Cameca helps the Doctor and Ian find a way to re-enter the tomb by a secret entrance. Ian braves a treacherous tunnel in which he is almost drowned to re-enter the tomb by a secret door and soon tells his friends that they can flee. Despite her efforts, Barbara realises that she cannot change an entire culture, although she does succeed in changing the views of Autloc. Autloc helps Barbara reunite with her friends before exiling himself to the desert to meditate on what remains of his faith. In a pitched battle to gain access to the tomb door, Ian kills Ixta in a fight to the death to protect the TARDIS crew. The Doctor and his companions leave knowing that despite their intervention, history will take its pre-destined course. As they depart, Tlotoxl is very much in control and sacrifices the Perfect Victim to end the naturally-occurring eclipse. The Doctor comforts Barbara by telling her she did help Autloc find a better belief system.

== Production ==
=== Conception and writing ===
Writer John Lucarotti was commissioned to write &quot;The Aztecs&quot; by script editor David Whitaker on 25 February 1964, while another of his stories—the show&#x27;s fourth serial, &quot;Marco Polo&quot;—was in production. Having lived in Mexico, Lucarotti was fascinated by the Aztec civilisation. He described them as &quot;a highly civilised and cultured race&quot;, and was particularly fascinated by their obsession with human sacrifice. Lucarotti wrote the scripts aboard his boat in Majorca, delivering the completed scripts on 18 March 1964. John Crockett was assigned to direct the serial due to his knowledge of history, having previously worked on the fourth episode of &quot;Marco Polo&quot;. Designer Barry Newbery found the serial difficult for research, due to the limited information on the Aztecs at the time. Researching using books provided by the BBC, he designed the tomb door based on the &quot;comic book&quot; style of Aztec design. He had also watched a documentary about Aztec archaeology on ITV, and was concerned that a larger studio would be required for production. Costume designer Daphne Dare used artistic license with her costumes in the serial, since male Aztecs usually only wore brief loincloths and cloaks, while women were often topless.

=== Casting and characters ===
Keith Pyott was chosen for the role of Autloc, the High Priest of the Aztecs, while Ian Cullen and Margot Van der Burgh played Ixta and Cameca, respectively. Cullen recalled that William Hartnell &quot;wasn&#x27;t the friendliest person, but he was trying to remember all those lines&quot;. John Ringham, an old colleague of Crockett, was chosen to play Tlotoxl; for the character, Crockett told Ringham to &quot;make all the children in the country hate you&quot;. Crockett&#x27;s secretary June McMullen suggested Walter Randall for the role of Tonila, having met him at a party. Producer Verity Lambert required Randall to shave his face for the role. Martial arts expert David Anderson, who had previously appeared in &quot;Marco Polo&quot;, was cast as the Captain of the Guard. Anderson also arranged the fight between Ian and Ixta for the second episode, and acted as William Russell&#x27;s stunt double in the final episode. Lucarotti used Aztec-sounding names for the characters; for example, the character Ixta was derived from the Aztec city Ixtapalapa.

=== Filming ===
Carole Ann Ford took a two-week holiday during filming; she appeared in pre-filmed inserts for the second and third episodes. These were filmed on 13 April 1964, during production of the previous serial. Silent model and background shots were filmed at Ealing Studios on 14 April. Rehearsals for the first episode ran from 27 to 30 April, and recording took place on 1 May in Lime Grove Studio D. The second and third episodes were recorded on 8 and 15 May, respectively, at the BBC Television Centre. Upon discovering that some of the scenery had been broken up since the recording of the first episode, Crockett quickly rearranged parts from other sets, as well as some plants, to build the set. The final episode was filmed on 22 May in Lime Grove Studio D.

== Reception ==
=== Broadcast and ratings ===
The first episode was broadcast on BBC1 on 23 May 1964, and was watched by 7.4 million viewers, maintaining audience figures from the final two episodes of &quot;The Keys of Marinus&quot;. The second and fourth episodes maintained these figures, while the third episode saw a rise to 7.9 million viewers; the third episode became the first episode of the show to place in the top 20 of the BBC&#x27;s audience measurement charts. The serial&#x27;s Appreciation Index dropped slightly across the four episodes: the first two episodes received 62, while the third and fourth received 57 and 58, respectively.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;The Aztecs&quot; received positive reviews. After the broadcast of the first episode, &quot;Television Today&quot;″s Bill Edmunds praised the villainous nature of the characters Tlotoxl and Ixta, but felt that Barbara should have &quot;a chance to look beautiful instead of worried&quot;. Edmunds also praised Newbery&#x27;s design work, noting distinct accuracy in the sets. Following the second episode, Bob Leeson of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; felt that the serial had &quot;charm&quot;, applauding the &quot;painstaking attempts for historical accuracy&quot; and noting a &quot;much tighter plot&quot; than previous serials. The third episode was the subject of a BBC Audience Research Report in July 1964, in which a panel of 225 viewers deemed a &quot;falling-off of interest&quot; in the show; many viewers preferred the show&#x27;s &quot;earlier space-time encounters&quot;.

Retrospective reviews of the serial were also positive. In 1986, Tim Munro of &quot;Star Begotten&quot; considered the serial &quot;one of the shining jewels of the Hartnell era&quot; and of the entire classic series to date, praising Lucarotti&#x27;s writing and characters, especially of the Doctor, considering the story one of his best. In &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping described the serial as a &quot;lyrical piece of BBC costume drama and a gem to cherish&quot;. In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker felt that, while it lacks the epic nature of &quot;Marco Polo&quot;, &quot;The Aztecs&quot; is a &quot;fascinating and compelling depiction of the Aztec civilisation&quot;, praising Lucarotti&#x27;s characterisation. In &quot;A Critical History of Doctor Who&quot; (1999), John Kenneth Muir called &quot;The Aztecs&quot; &quot;perhaps the best-written of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; first-year serials&quot;, and Lucarotti&#x27;s script as &quot;among the best written and best executed stories&quot; of the classic series; he praised the characterisation, tension, and philosophical nature of the script, as well as the central role of Barbara and the performances of Hill, Russell, and Ringham.

In 2008, &quot;Radio Times&quot; reviewer Mark Braxton called &quot;The Aztecs&quot; one of the best &quot;Doctor Who&quot; adventures, highlighting Barbara&#x27;s dilemma about changing history, the art direction, and the &quot;sense of impending tragedy&quot;; he noted minor issues, such as the backdrops and unconvincing fight scenes. In 2011, Christopher Bahn of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; described &quot;The Aztecs&quot; as &quot;a classical tragedy infused with just enough hope toward the end to keep it from being unbearably bleak&quot; and discussed the inability of changing history and the Doctor&#x27;s only romantic entanglement in the classic series, which he called &quot;sweet and funny&quot;. In 2013, Ian Berriman of &quot;SFX&quot; described the serial as &quot;Jacqueline Hill&#x27;s finest hour&quot;, but felt that &quot;the show is stolen by John Ringham as Tlotoxl&quot;. Though mostly positive, Berriman felt that some of the education content was forced and &quot;it&#x27;s a shame that much of the dialogue is so fustily formal&quot;. Ian Jane of &quot;DVDTalk&quot; praised Hill&#x27;s portrayal of Barbara, though questioned the character&#x27;s motivations. &quot;Digital Spy&quot;″s Morgan Jeffrey named it the tenth best &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story, praising the script, performances and emotional impact of the serial. Jeffrey summarised the serial as &quot;quite simply 100 minutes of sensational drama – it&#x27;s William Hartnell&#x27;s finest hour on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and one of the show&#x27;s very best offerings&quot;.

<text>Chichicastenango, also known as Santo Tomás Chichicastenango, is a town, with a population of 71,394 (2018 census), and the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name in the El Quiché department of Guatemala. It is located in a mountainous region about northwest of Guatemala City, at an altitude of 1,965 m (6,447 ft). The Spanish conquistadors gave the town its name from the Nahuatl name used by their allied soldiers from Tlaxcala: Tzitzicaztenanco, or &quot;City of Nettles&quot;. Its original name was &quot;Chaviar&quot;.

Chichicastenango is a K&#x27;iche&#x27; Maya cultural centre. According to the 2012 census, 98.5% of the municipality&#x27;s population is indigenous Mayan K&#x27;iche. Of the population, 21% speak only K&#x27;iche, 71% speak both K&#x27;iche and Spanish, and the remaining 8% speak only Spanish.

==Market==

Chichicastenango hosts market days on Thursdays and Sundays where vendors sell handicrafts, food, flowers, pottery, wooden boxes, condiments, medicinal plants, candles, pom and copal (traditional incense), cal (lime stones for preparing tortillas), grindstones, pigs and chickens, machetes, and other tools.

Among the items sold are textiles, particularly women&#x27;s blouses. Masks used by dancers in traditional dances, such as the Dance of the Conquest, are also manufactured in Chichicastenango.

===Church of Santo Tomás===

Next to the market is the 400-year-old church of Santo Tomás. It is built atop a Pre-Columbian temple platform, and the steps originally leading to a temple of the pre-Hispanic Maya civilization remain venerated. K&#x27;iche&#x27; Maya priests still use the church for their rituals, burning incense and candles. In special cases, they burn a chicken for the gods. Each of the 20 stairs that lead up to the church stands for one month of the Maya calendar year. Another key element of Chichicastenango is the Cofradia of Pascual Abaj, which is an ancient carved stone venerated nearby and the Maya priests perform several rituals there. Writing on the stone records the doings of a king named Tohil (Fate).

The Chichicastenango Regional Museum lies in its grounds.

==In music==
At least three songs have been written about the town.
* “Chichicastenango” Xavier Cugat 1937
* &quot;In Chi-Chi Castenango&quot; Edmundo Ros &quot;Mambo Jambo: Original Recordings 1941-1950&quot;
* &quot;In the Land of The Maya&quot; Lennie Gallant &quot;In the Land of The Maya&quot;

In addition, the character Rosie from Bye Bye Birdie sings sarcastically of being the toast of Chichicastenango.

==Geography==
Chichicastenango is composed of the municipal seat and 81 rural communities. Nearby village communities include Paquixic (1.0 nm), Chucam (1.0 nm), Chujupen (1.4 nm), Camanibal (2.2 nm), Chontala (2.2 nm) and Chucojom (1.0 nm).

==In films==
===The New Adventures of Tarzan (1935) ===

In 1935, the film &quot;The New Adventures of Tarzan&quot;, was filmed on location in Guatemala, taking advantage of the help from the United Fruit Company and president Jorge Ubico. Chichicastenango was among the locations used during filming.
===Sacred City of the Mayans (1936)===

This 8-minute color travelogue devoted to Chichicastenango is one of James A. Fitzpatrick&#x27;s TravelTalks. It is occasionally shown on Turner Classic Movies as a filler between feature films.

<text>This is a list of notable lakes and reservoirs located in the U.S. state of Arizona. Many of the lakes listed here contain game fish and are managed by the Arizona Game and Fish Department. Some may dry out or freeze out fish, and require seasonal restocking. Most lakes will not allow large motorboats.

Due to Arizona&#x27;s dry climate, many listed here are intermittent lakes and do not contain water throughout the entire year. Swimming, fishing, and/or boating are permitted in some of these lakes, but not all.

<doc id="733448" wikidata="Q5136632" url="?curid=733448" title="Clunk Click Every Trip">
<text>&quot;Clunk Click Every Trip&quot; is the slogan of a series of British public information films. They commenced in the summer of 1970, presented by Shaw Taylor, then from January 1971 to 1975 were presented by Jimmy Savile.

The BBC adapted Savile&#x27;s slogan for the title of his Saturday night variety show beginning in 1973. The slogan was introduced during the previous campaign, fronted by Taylor and featuring the slogan &quot;Your seatbelt is their security&quot;. It was the onomatopoeia used by Taylor to describe the act of closing the door and fastening a seatbelt which proved the most memorable aspect of the campaign, so it was upgraded to act as the slogan when the films moved into colour.

The advertisements highlighted the dangers of traffic collisions and reminded drivers that the first thing they should do after closing the door (&quot;Clunk&quot;) is fasten their seatbelt (&quot;Click&quot;). These advertisements, which included graphic sequences of drivers being thrown through the windscreen and, in one Savile-hosted public service announcement, an image of a disfigured woman who survived such an accident helped lay the groundwork for compulsory seatbelt use in the front seat of a vehicle, which came into force on 31 January 1983 in the UK, although car manufacturers had been legally obliged to fit front seatbelts since 1965.
