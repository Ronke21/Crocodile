<text>The Guarded Command Language (GCL) is a programming language defined by Edsger Dijkstra for predicate transformer semantics in EWD472. It combines programming concepts in a compact way. It makes it easier to develop a program and its proof hand-in-hand, with the proof ideas leading the way; moreover, parts of a program can actually be &quot;calculated&quot;.

An important property of GCL is nondeterminism. For example, in the if-statement, several alternatives may be true, and the choice is made at runtime, when the if-statement is executed. This frees the programmer from having to make unnecessary choices and is an aid in the formal development of programs.

GCL includes the multiple assignment statement. For example, execution of the statement is done by first evaluating the righthand side values and then storing them in the lefthand variables. Thus, this statement swaps the values of and .

The following books discuss the development of programs using GCL:
*
*


==Guarded command==
A guarded command consists of a boolean condition or guard, and a statement &quot;guarded&quot; by it. The statement is only executed if the guard is true, so when reasoning about the statement, the condition can be assumed true. This makes it easier to prove the program meets a specification.

===Syntax===
A guarded command is a statement of the form G → S, where
* G is a proposition, called the guard
* S is a statement

===Semantics===
* If G evaluates to true, S is eligible to be executed. In most GCL constructs, multiple guarded commands may have guards that are true, and exactly one of them is chosen &quot;arbitrarily&quot; to be executed.
* If G is false, S will not be executed.

==skip and abort==
skip and abort are important statements in the guarded command language. abort is the undefined instruction: do anything. It does not even need to terminate. It is used to describe the program when formulating a proof, in which case the proof usually fails. skip is the empty instruction: do nothing. It is often used when the syntax requires a statement but the state should not change.

===Syntax===
 skip

 abort

===Semantics===
* skip: do nothing
* abort: do anything

==Assignment==
Assigns values to variables.

===Syntax===
 v := E
or
 v, v, ..., v := E, E, ..., E

where
* v are program variables
* E are expressions of the same data type as their corresponding variables

==Catenation==
Statements are separated by one semicolon (;)

==Selection: if==

The selection (often called the &quot;conditional statement&quot; or &quot;if statement&quot;) is a list of guarded commands, of which one is chosen to execute. If more than one guard is true, one statement whose guard is true is arbitrarily chosen to be executed. If no guard is true, the result is undefined, that is, equivalent to abort. Because at least one of the guards must be true, the empty statement skip is often needed. The statement if fi has no guarded commands, so there is never a true guard. Hence, if fi is equivalent to abort.

===Syntax===
 if G0 → S0
 □ G1 → S1
 □ Gn → Sn
 fi

===Semantics===
Upon execution of a selection, the guards are evaluated. If none of the guards is &quot;true&quot;, then the selection aborts, otherwise one of the clauses with a &quot;true&quot; guard is chosen arbitrarily and its statement is executed.

===Implementation===
GCL does not specify an implementation. Since guards cannot have side effects and the choice of clause is arbitrary, an implementation may evaluate the guards in any sequence and choose the first &quot;true&quot; clause, for example.

===Examples===
====Simple====
In pseudocode:
 if a &lt; b then set c to True
 else set c to False

In guarded command language:
 if a &lt; b → c := true
 □ a ≥ b → c := false
 fi

====Use of skip====
In pseudocode:
 if error is True then set x to 0

In guarded command language:
 if error → x := 0
 □ error → skip
 fi

If the second guard is omitted and error is False, the result is abort.

====More guards true====
 if a ≥ b → max := a
 □ b ≥ a → max := b
 fi

If a = b, either a or b is chosen as the new value for the maximum, with equal results. However, the implementation may find that one is easier or faster than the other. Since there is no difference to the programmer, any implementation will do.

==Repetition: &quot;do&quot;==
Execution of this repetition, or loop, is shown below.

===Syntax===
 do G0 → S0
 □ G1 → S1
 □ Gn → Sn
 od

===Semantics===
Execution of the repetition consists of executing 0 or more &quot;iterations&quot;, where an iteration consists of arbitrarily choosing a guarded command whose guard is true and executing the command . Thus, if all guards are initially false, the repetition terminates immediately, without executing an iteration. Execution of the repetition do od, which has no guarded commands, executes 0 iterations, so do od is equivalent to skip.

=== Examples ===
====Original Euclidean algorithm====
 a, b := A, B;
 do a &lt; b → b := b - a
 □ b &lt; a → a := a - b
 od

This repetition ends when a = b, in which case a and b hold the greatest common divisor of A and B.

Dijkstra sees in this algorithm a way of synchronizing two infinite cycles codice_1 and codice_2 in such a way that codice_3 and codice_4 remains true.

====Extended Euclidean algorithm====
 a, b, x, y, u, v := A, B, 1, 0, 0, 1;
 do b ≠ 0 →
 q, r := a div b, a mod b;
 a, b, x, y, u, v := b, r, u, v, x - q*u, y - q*v
 od

This repetition ends when b = 0, in which case the variables hold the solution to Bézout&#x27;s identity: xA + yB = gcd(A,B) .

====Non-deterministic sort====
 do a&gt;b → a, b := b, a
 □ b&gt;c → b, c := c, b
 □ c&gt;d → c, d := d, c
 od

The program keeps on permuting elements while one of them is greater than its successor. This non-deterministic bubble sort is not more efficient than its deterministic version, but easier to prove: it will not stop while the elements are not sorted and that each step it sorts at least 2 elements.

====Arg max====
 x, y = 1, 1;
 do x≠n →
 if f(x) ≤ f(y) → x := x+1
 □ f(x) ≥ f(y) → y := x; x := x+1
 fi
 od

This algorithm finds the value 1 ≤ &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot; for which a given integer function &quot;f&quot; is maximal. Not only the computation but also the final state is not necessarily uniquely determined.

== Applications ==
=== Programs correct by construction ===

Generalizing the observational congruence of Guarded Commands into a lattice has led to Refinement Calculus. This has been mechanized in Formal Methods like B-Method that allow one to formally derive programs from their specifications.

=== Asynchronous circuits ===

Guarded commands are suitable for quasi-delay-insensitive circuit design because the repetition
allows arbitrary relative delays for the selection of different commands. In this application,
a logic gate driving a node &quot;y&quot; in the circuit consists of two guarded commands, as follows:

 PullDownGuard → y := 0
 PullUpGuard → y := 1

&quot;PullDownGuard&quot; and &quot;PullUpGuard&quot; here are functions of the logic gate&#x27;s inputs,
which describe when the gate pulls the output down or up, respectively. Unlike classical
circuit evaluation models, the repetition for a set of guarded commands (corresponding to an asynchronous circuit) can accurately describe all possible dynamic behaviors of that circuit.
Depending on the model one is willing to live with for the electrical circuit elements,
additional restrictions on the guarded commands may be necessary for a guarded-command description
to be entirely satisfactory. Common restrictions include stability, non-interference, and absence
of self-invalidating commands.

=== Model checking ===
Guarded commands are used within the Promela programming language, which is used by the SPIN model checker. SPIN verifies correct operation of concurrent software applications.

=== Other ===
The Perl module Commands::Guarded implements a deterministic, rectifying variant on Dijkstra&#x27;s guarded commands.

<text>|}




















The Sprint Cup is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to thoroughbreds aged three years or older. It is run at Haydock Park over a distance of 6 furlongs (1,207 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in early September.

==History==
The event was established in 1966, and it was originally open to horses aged two or older. It was devised by Robert Sangster, the heir to the Vernons Pools business, who later became a leading racehorse owner/breeder. During the early part of its history the race was sponsored by Vernons and held in early November. It was initially contested on a course with a sharp left-hand bend.

The Vernons Sprint Cup was switched to September in 1979. It was transferred to Haydock&#x27;s newly installed 6-furlong straight track in 1986. It was promoted to Group 1 status in 1988, the final year of Vernons&#x27; sponsorship. For a period the race was closed to two-year-olds, but it reopened in 1989. Juveniles were excluded again from 1994.

The Sprint Cup is currently sponsored by Betfair.

<doc id="727617" wikidata="Q705823" url="?curid=727617" title="Paavo Yrjölä">
<text>Paavo Ilmari Yrjölä (18 June 1902 in Hämeenkyrö – 11 February 1980 in Vilppula), also known as the &quot;Bear of Hämeenkyrö&quot; (&quot;Hämeenkyrön karhu&quot;), was a Finnish track and field athlete who won the gold medal in the decathlon at the 1928 Summer Olympics. He also competed in shot put and high jump at the same Games, and in decathlon in 1924 and 1932, but less successfully.

In the 1928 Olympics, he had to rerun the 100 m hurdles as the fourth hurdle was placed incorrectly in the first run.
Finland took the top two spots in the decathlon that year with Yrjölä taking the gold (with a world record) and Akilles Järvinen the silver.

In his years of competing, Yrjölä set three officially ratified world records: 7820 points in 1926 (6460 according to the current scoring tables and with standard manual timing corrections of 0.24 seconds for 100 metres and 110 metre hurdles, 0.14 seconds for 400 metres and nothing for 1500 metres), 7995 points in 1927 (6586) and 8053 in the 1928 Summer Olympics (6587). Yrjölä was the first decathlete to score higher than Jim Thorpe at the 1912 Summer Olympics. Thorpe&#x27;s performance wasn&#x27;t officially recognized as a record due to his semi-professional status. Yrjölä set one more record in 1930 of 8117 points (6700), but this wasn&#x27;t officially ratified.

Athletics was a family affair as his brother, Iivari Yrjölä, competed in the decathlon at the 1924 Olympics, and his son, Matti Yrjölä, was a successful shotputter.

== Major achievements ==
* Ninth in the decathlon at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris (5,547 points)
* A gold medal in the decathlon at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam (6,587 points)
* Sixth in the decathlon at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles (6,385 points)
* Ninth in the shot put at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam
* Finnish Champion in 1925, 1926 and 1927

<text>The Fillies&#x27; Mile is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to two-year-old fillies. It is run on the Rowley Mile at Newmarket over a distance of 1 mile (1,609 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in October.

==History==
The event was established in 1973, and it was originally held at Ascot. It was initially sponsored by the Green Shield catalogue shops and titled the Green Shield Stakes. The shops were rebranded as Argos in the mid 1970s, and for a period the race was called the Argos Star Fillies&#x27; Mile. It was given Group 3 status in 1975.

The sponsorship was taken over by Hoover in 1978, and the event became known as the Hoover Fillies&#x27; Mile. It was promoted to Group 2 level in 1986, and its association with Hoover continued until 1989.

The race was upgraded to Group 1 in 1990, and backed by Brent Walker until 1991. A long-term deal with Meon Valley Stud began in 1998. It was temporarily switched to Newmarket in 2005, when Ascot was closed for redevelopment.

The Fillies&#x27; Mile was added to the Breeders&#x27; Cup Challenge series in 2008. The winners from 2008 to 2012 earned an automatic invitation to compete in the Breeders&#x27; Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf.

The event was transferred to Newmarket in 2011, and from this point it was sponsored by Shadwell. It was formerly held on the second day of the three-day Cambridgeshire Meeting, the day before the Cambridgeshire Handicap but was moved to Future Champions Day from 2014, switching places in the calendar with the Rockfel Stakes. In 2015 the race moved again, to a slightly earlier date in October, and is now run on the Friday of the Future Champions Festival.

<text>Samuel Youngs (December 4, 1760 – September 12, 1839) was an American school teacher. He was a friend of Washington Irving and elements of his life may be included in the character Ichabod Crane in Irving&#x27;s story &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;, along with the character inspiration from Kinderhook Schoolteacher, Jesse Merwin.

He served as a lieutenant in the American Revolutionary War, and was honored, along with other residents of Tarrytown who fought in that war, with a monument erected in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. He was a Federalist member of the New York State Assembly in 1796–97, 1809 and 1810; and Surrogate of Westchester County. He was buried in the yard of the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow in Sleepy Hollow, New York. In 1851 Youngs&#x27; remains were removed to the Dale Cemetery in Ossining, New York, becoming the first interment at that cemetery.

The Queen Elizabeth II Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run at Ascot over a distance of 1 mile (1,609 metres), and it is scheduled to take place as part of British Champions Day each year in October.

==History==
The event was established in 1955, and it was originally held in September. It was created when a race called the Knights&#x27; Royal Stakes was renamed in honour of Queen Elizabeth II. The first three winners were all trained in France.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the &quot;QEII&quot; was initially given Group 2 status. It was promoted to Group 1 level in 1987.

The race was added to the Breeders&#x27; Cup Challenge series in 2008. From this point the winner earned an automatic invitation to compete in the Breeders&#x27; Cup Mile. It was removed from the series in 2012.

The Queen Elizabeth II Stakes was switched to October in 2011. It became part of a new fixture called British Champions Day, and its prize fund was increased fourfold to £1,000,000. It now serves as the mile-category final of the British Champions Series.

<text>Pinus cembra, also known as Swiss pine, Swiss stone pine, Arolla pine, Austrian stone pine, or just stone pine, is a species of pine tree in the subgenus &quot;Strobus&quot;.

== Description ==
The Swiss pine is a member of the white pine group, &quot;Pinus&quot; subgenus &quot;Strobus&quot;, and like all members of that group, the leaves (&#x27;needles&#x27;) are in fascicles (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. The mature size is typically between and in height, and the trunk diameter can be up to . However, it grows very slowly and it may take 30 years for the tree to reach . The cones, which contain the seeds (or nuts), of the Swiss pine are to long. Cones take 2 years (24 months) to mature. The to long seeds have only a vestigial wing and are dispersed by spotted nutcrackers. The species is long-lasting and can reach an age between 500 and 1000 years.

In its natural environment, this tree usually reaches reproductive maturity at the age of 50 years (even 80 years, if the conditions are more extreme). 

The very similar Siberian pine (&quot;Pinus sibirica&quot;) is treated as a variety or subspecies of Swiss pine by some botanists. The Siberian pine differs in having slightly larger cones, being more massive (taller, wider trunk), having a faster growth rate and needles with three resin canals instead of two as in the Swiss pine.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Swiss pine grows in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains of central Europe, in Poland (Tatra Mountains), Switzerland, France, Italy, Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Slovakia (Tatra Mountains), Ukraine and Romania. It typically grows at to altitude. It often reaches the alpine tree line in this area.
== Ecology ==
Swiss pine associates with numerous species of mycorrhizal fungi from a young age, usually from the genus &quot;Suillus&quot;. This symbiosis improves the tree&#x27;s growth and survival rate.

==Uses==
Swiss pine is a popular ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, giving steady though not fast growth on a wide range of sites where the climate is cold. It is very tolerant of severe winter cold, hardy down to at least , and also of wind exposure. The seeds are also harvested and sold as pine nuts. When cultivated, it will likely start producing cones after the age of 12 years, much faster than in the wild. This depends on the climate, soil type, mycorrhizal fungi etc. To make the tree bear cones faster, the tree can be inoculated with ectomycorrhizal fungi, such as &quot;Suillus luteus, Suillus americanus, Suillus placidus&quot; etc. These are the most effective. 

Pine cones cut into slices are used to flavor schnapps, which is then sold as &quot;Zirbenschnaps&quot; or &quot;Zirbeler&quot; schnapps.

The wood is the most used for carvings in Val Gardena since the 17th century.
The cone of the Swiss pine was the field sign of the Roman legion stationed in Rhaetia in 15 BC, and hence it is used as the heraldic charge (known as &quot;Zirbelnuss&quot; in German) in the coat of arms of the city of Augsburg, the site of the Roman fort Augusta Vindelicorum.

It is also a species that is often used in bonsai.

&quot;Pinus cembra&quot; can be found in the uppermost forest belt where it helps to minimize the risk of avalanches and soil erosion. Due to this ability, the tree is valued as a stabilizing factor for afforestation projects at high elevations.

Like other European and Asian white pines, Swiss pine is very resistant to white pine blister rust (&quot;Cronartium ribicola&quot;). This fungal disease was accidentally introduced from Europe into North America, where it has caused severe mortality in the American native white pines in many areas, notably, Western white pine and the closely related whitebark pine. Swiss pine is of great value for research into hybridization to develop rust resistance in these species.

<doc id="727632" wikidata="Q5185940" url="?curid=727632" title="Crisis (British comics)">
<text>Crisis (also known as 2000 AD Presents: Crisis) was a British comic anthology published by Fleetway Publications from 17 September 1988 to October 1991, initially fortnightly and later monthly. Designed to appeal to older readers than other Fleetway titles in order to take advantage of a boom in interest in &#x27;adult&#x27; comics, &quot;Crisis&quot; featured overtly political and complex stories; one issue was even produced in conjunction with Amnesty International. 

Despite being branded under the umbrella of the successful &quot;2000 AD&quot;, the comic was not a sales success and – despite periodic attempts at revamps – was cancelled after 63 issues. However, it did feature early work by a number of notable British comics creators, including Garth Ennis, John McCrea, Mark Millar, Grant Morrison and John Smith.

==Creation==
===Background===
The breakout success of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons&#x27; &quot;Watchmen&quot; and Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; had greatly boosted the view that comic books (or as mainstream press outlets often called them, &#x27;graphic novels&#x27;) were a credible form of entertainment on both sides of the Atlantic. Coverage in national newspapers and influential magazines such as &quot;The Face&quot; and &quot;Time Out&quot; - together with the high profile of many of the creators involved in what was referred to in the comics industry as the &#x27;British Invasion&#x27; - seemed to point to a potential audience of older British comic readers that were not being catered for by &quot;2000 AD&quot;, despite the title&#x27;s growing maturity. While comics aimed at older readers existed in Britain they were either underground small-press titles like the Hunt Emerson-edited &quot;Street Comix&quot; or humour titles like the famous &quot;Viz&quot;; attempts like Dez Skinn&#x27;s &quot;Warrior&quot; had received critical acclaim from comics readers but failed to break through to wider success. However, Igor Goldkind had produced British trade paperback editions of &quot;Watchmen&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; for Titan Comics that replicated the commercial success and critical attention the titles had received in America.

The success also added to the growing discourse on creator ownership in comics. IPC Magazines, owners of &quot;2000 AD&quot; and one of the most dominant comics publishers in the UK, operated a model whereby creators signed away their rights under a work for hire agreement. The company had long justified this stance by paying generous page rates in return to contributors signing away all ownership to their work - which allowed the company&#x27;s material to be reprinted or syndicated overseas without royalty payments, while popular characters such as Judge Dredd were entirely owned by the publisher. Until 1977 - when Kevin O&#x27;Neill was able to get credits into &quot;2000 AD&quot; - IPC didn&#x27;t even attribute the work of its creators. The growth of the comics industry fandom with specialised publications like &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; threw a greater spotlight on the poor treatment of the likes of Jerry Siegel, Joe Shuster, Jack Kirby and Steve Englehart, leading to a rise in &#x27;independent&#x27; comic companies such as Pacific and Eclipse, who allowed authors and artists to retain rights to their creations - as well as Marvel Comics establishing their Epic Comics imprint.

Meanwhile, &quot;2000 AD&quot; editor Steve MacManus quit the title, citing burnout after an initial temporary stint replacing Kelvin Gosnell in 1979 had turned into a decade-long residency. MacManus had been instrumental in ensuring &quot;2000 AD&quot; repeatedly bucked sales trends and weathered the downturn in British comic sales of the 1980s which had claimed many of IPC&#x27;s titles, and was persuaded to stay on by editorial director John Sanders in order to hand &quot;2000 AD&quot; to new editor Richard Burton. With that done, MacManus was then to take a lengthy working holiday to America in March 1987, to see how IPC could launch a title to take advantage of the public interest in adult-orientated comics.

===Development===
MacManus proposed a new 32-page full colour fortnightly; each issue would contain two 14-page chapters of ongoing stories, with a flip cover to allow both to be displayed equally. An additional &quot;From the makers of &quot;2000 AD&quot;&quot; graphic was to be placed in the masthead. Each month&#x27;s output would then be licensed to an American publisher, combined into a 28-page American-format comic and exported. While the cover price of 65p was twice that of &quot;2000 AD&quot;, it would match that comic&#x27;s monthly costs and was also the same as that of imported American titles, which were gaining greater traction in the UK through outlets like Forbidden Planet and other comic shops.

Before MacManus left for America in 1987, there were rumours that the IPC Youth Group was up for sale as the parent company looked to divest itself of comics, and that the controversial tycoon Robert Maxwell was weighing a bid. When he returned, MacManus found this had gone ahead; the IPC Youth Group had been renamed Fleetway Publications and was now part of Maxwell Communication Corporation. Initially little seemed to have changed, and MacManus continued work on the planned new title. Sanders had suggested a superhero angle to the stories to allow better marketability in the potentially lucrative American market, and the success of Grant Morrison and Steve Yeowell&#x27;s &quot;2000 AD&quot; strip &quot;Zenith&quot; showed MacManus that the genre could be handled in an adult-orientated way by British creators. He began brainstorming an idea where in a future America (incorporating Britain as the 51st state for &quot;local colour&quot;) had a government-sanctioned superhuman in each state. Wanting to promote upcoming talent he commissioned John Smith, who at 20 already had experience on DC Thomson&#x27;s science fiction title &quot;Starblazer&quot; and &quot;2000 AD&quot; (including &quot;Tyranny Rex&quot;) to write what would become &quot;New Statesmen&quot;. Stalwart IPC writer Alan Grant would later claim MacManus boasted he planned to break the &quot;stranglehold&quot; Grant and writing partner John Wagner had on British comics.

For the second story, MacManus reached out to the experienced Pat Mills, who was among those leading demands for better treatment of British comics creators. He had been working for IPC for most of the 1970s, first of all on girls&#x27; comics before devising weeklies &quot;Battle Picture Weekly&quot;, &quot;Action&quot; and &quot;2000 AD&quot; for the company, for which he received little recompense beyond the initial payments. Mills became particularly disillusioned following the treatment of his acclaimed &quot;Battle&quot; story &quot;Charley&#x27;s War&quot;; the writer requested a research budget for the strip&#x27;s planned second arc, which would move the story to World War II. This was refused, and Mills quit the strip in protest; IPC simply assigned staff writer Scott Goodall to continue the story, and the work-for-hire contract gave Mills no capacity to object.

To help work on the title (to be named &quot;50/50&quot; to reflect the split content), MacManus recruited Goldkind from Titan. The latter acted as a sounding board for the proposed Mills strips, and their discussions on global corporations and brands led to Mills conceiving &quot;Third World War&quot;. Goldkind also suggested graphic artist Rian Hughes, who mixed agency work with small-press comics, to design the &quot;2000 AD Presents 50/50: Third World War&quot; half of the flip comic; Steven Cook - who had a strong record, having produced successful redesigns for &quot;Starburst&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; and most recently &quot;2000 AD&quot; - for the &quot;2000 AD Presents 50/50: New Statesman&quot; half. However, management felt the title was not &quot;sales friendly&quot; and furthermore were concerned that the split format would cause concern for newsagents, which still made up the primary market for British comics. &quot;50/50&quot; was retitled &quot;Crisis&quot; at Goldkind&#x27;s suggestion (MacManus would later recall management weren&#x27;t enthusiastic about the new title either), and Hughes was retasked to create the overall look of the exterior as well as the interior for &quot;Third World War&quot;, while Cook would style the interior for &quot;New Statesmen&quot;. Hughes used experience from working in the music industry to ensure the various promotional materials and the comic itself were kept under the same &quot;stylistic umbrella&quot;.

MacManus&#x27; research in America also saw him get hold of copies of contracts offered by DC Comics and Epic, and melded ideas from both with guidelines from the Society of British Authors to come up with creator contracts for the title. These retained Fleetway&#x27;s copyright on the material and a flat rate, but added an 8% royalty for sales beyond the title&#x27;s break-even point, for collected edition reprints and - crucially - 35% of net profits for overseas syndication, as well as provisions for further payments in the event of merchandising or adaptations for other media. While MacManus would later acknowledge the amounts involved were not &quot;earth-shattering&quot;, it was a major step forward for the company. The same terms were also offered to the artists, and as a result &quot;Crisis&quot; was able to land renowned artists for both strips. The experienced Carlos Ezquerra, who had worked for IPC for a decade (most notably on &quot;Strontium Dog&quot;) signed on for &quot;Third World War&quot; and Jim Baikie (another veteran, who had received a major boost in acclaim following his work on &quot;2000 AD&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Skizz&quot; with Alan Moore) would draw &quot;New Statesmen&quot;. MacManus recalled that the pair were the first choices of both writers; however, Mills has stated he wanted Ian Gibson first, but the artist objected to some of Eve&#x27;s actions and turned the strip down.

==Publication history==

===Launch===
British comics generally drummed up publicity for a new title by including a free gift with early issues and prominent retailer displays in return for early issues being supplied on a sale or return basis until the title found its average circulation. Feeling it would go against the grain of the title&#x27;s intended older audience, MacManus eschewed the free gift while Goldkind worked on a publicity campaign, including a launch at a bar in North London; Mills later felt this flew in the face of the comic&#x27;s contents. The event was a success however, as the publication of the first issue (dated 17 September 1988) gained coverage in &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;, &quot;The Scotsman&quot; and &quot;Timeout&quot;, though the reviews themselves were mixed. Much of the coverage labelled &quot;Crisis&quot; as a political comic, something MacManus felt was only partly true but was happy to take in the name of publicity. The creators were sent on a cross-country signing tour, culminating in a prominent appearance at the 1988 United Kingdom Comic Art Convention. 

At the same time &quot;Crisis&quot; was launching, &quot;2000 AD&quot; alumni Brett Ewins and Steve Dillon were priming the similarly-themed &quot;Deadline&quot;, published by Deadline Publications Ltd and underwritten by Tom Astor. MacManus recalled there was some sentiment that the larger Fleetway were trying to steamroller a potential rival with corporate muscle, something he denies being a conscious choice. The press campaign saw the first issue of &quot;Crisis&quot; sell an impressive 80,000 copies. However, despite the expensive launch and attempt at better production values (including all-colour artwork) the comic was still printed on newsprint stock like the company&#x27;s weeklies, something both Mills and Hughes would later criticise. MacManus recalled the early response as polarised - &quot;those that liked it loved it, and those that didn&#x27;t ridiculed it.&quot;

Sales for the second issue fell to 50,000 - while a drop after the first issue was industry standard, this was more severe than expected. At the same time Maxwell&#x27;s underlings drastically cut back on the numbers of staff and general costs at Fleetway, with most of the staff moved to work-from-home freelancers to reduce costs. MacManus was retained as a permanent employee, with the full-time staff relocated from King&#x27;s Reach Tower to offices in Camden. By this point &quot;Crisis&quot;&#x27; sales had evened out at 30,000 per issue, and MacManus found himself having to defend what management felt was an underperformance.

===Relaunch===

After research revealed most newsagents were displaying &quot;Crisis&quot; with children&#x27;s titles, MacManus was able to negotiate a £20,000 budget for a relaunch of the title with &quot;Crisis&quot; #13. He would later recall he convinced management of &quot;Crisis&quot;&#x27; topical nature by pointing to the Enya&#x27;s UK number 1 single &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot;, with the choral refrain of &quot;Save the whale&quot;. It was only later he discovered the lyric was &quot;Sail away&quot;, but his mistake wasn&#x27;t picked up on. The relaunch would include information about placing it with the likes of &quot;Viz&quot; in newsagent trade publications, copies being inserted in the &quot;NME&quot;. MacManus also decided to expand the contents to three stories, with the first &#x27;book&#x27; of &quot;New Statesmen&quot; ended and the strip rested. MacManus and Goldkind went through submissions from readers and quickly hit on one submitted by Belfast-based writer Garth Ennis, set around the Troubles in Northern Ireland and titled &quot;Troubled Souls&quot;. It was felt that running two long, complex serials concurrently had been intimidating to casual readers. After being contacted, Ennis not only produced a full script for the opening episode within two days but also suggested his friend John McCrea as artist; a deal was rapidly struck. The other new selected was &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; by Myra Hancock and David Hine, about a contemporary Camden shoplifter turned carpenter. 

The change in format was also influenced by the lack of the hoped-for American distributor interest. Marvel and DC had both passed, and instead the reprints would be handled by Dez Skinn via the new Fleetway Quality imprint. &quot;New Statesmen&quot; and &quot;Third World War&quot; were planned as mini-series alongside titles based on &quot;2000 AD&quot; material, with the enterprise being given a promotional budget of $40,000. The low production values of many reprints was criticised in some quarters. 

More behind-the-scenes disruption came when Sanders, tiring of Maxwell&#x27;s unpredictability, left Fleetway.MacManus was given the new title of group editor of the &quot;2000 AD&quot; Group - consisting of &quot;Crisis&quot;, &quot;2000 AD&quot; and the latter&#x27;s ancillary titles such as reprint title &quot;The Best of 2000 A.D. Monthly&quot;, specials and annuals. The &quot;Crisis&quot; relaunch stabilised sales, and MacManus continued to incorporate new talent to the comic - Sean Phillips and Duncan Fegredo contributed to &quot;Third World War&quot;, while the former also contributed an epilogue to &quot;New Statesmen&quot;. However, Ezquerra had left the comic, and no permanent replacement was found to draw &quot;Third World War&quot;, which went through many hands as a result.
From &quot;Crisis&quot; #21 the comic introduced a one-off slot that would see contributions from numerous up-and-coming creators including Mark Millar, Si Spencer, Glenn Fabry, Peter Hogan, Phil Winslade and Peter Doherty. However, the influx of so many inexperienced creators would cause some scheduling problems.

===Controversies===

MacManus commissioned &quot;Skin&quot; by Peter Milligan, who had spent most of the eighties maintaining an unlikely balance between experimental creator-owned work such as anthology &quot;Strange Days&quot; with IPC freelance scripts for stories like &quot;Action Force&quot; and &quot;M.A.S.K.&quot;. Illustrated by Brendan McCarthy, &quot;Skin&quot; was an uncompromising look at the life of a young skinhead with a birth defect, and was set to begin in &quot;Crisis&quot; #28. Hugely enthusiastic about the story, MacManus described it as being &quot;at the cutting edge of British comics&quot; in the pages of British comics magazine &quot;Speakeasy&quot;. However, Fleetway&#x27;s printers rebelled at running the story, and the company&#x27;s legal advisors suggested it could be considered obscene under UK law. Sanders&#x27; replacement as managing director, John Davidge, felt the story was &quot;lacking in taste&quot; and ordered it to be replaced. MacManus found the decision absurd, given that Maxwell&#x27;s publishing empire included pornographic magazines. The story would instead be published in 1992 as a graphic novel by American publisher Tundra. Ennis would later feel the &quot;Skin&quot; controversy led to an &quot;atmosphere of nervous caution&quot; at &quot;Crisis&quot;.

Instead &quot;Crisis&quot; #28 - which also saw a price increase to 75p - introduced Philip Bond&#x27;s &quot;Angels Among Us&quot; in place of &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;. It also saw a prelude to the planned second book of &quot;New Statesmen&quot;, after which no more was heard about the story. The following issue saw the start of Ennis&#x27; second submission, &quot;True Faith&quot;, an acerbic assault on organised religion; he was paired with artist Warren Pleece, whose work the self-published (along with brother Gary) &quot;Velocity&quot; had caught MacManus&#x27; eye. Issue 28 also included a one-off strip by Phillip Swarbrick, an exiled South African writer who had written for &quot;New Statesman&quot;, who related his experiences after being recruited to South Africa&#x27;s police service.

In his new role as Group Editor, MacManus also explored the idea of producing monthly ongoing supplementary titles to &quot;2000 AD&quot; and &quot;Crisis&quot;, in the form of &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot;, and got the green light after Fleetway struck gold with a licensed &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; comic. Several stories from &quot;Crisis&quot; were compiled for the British book market, overseen by Mark Cox, with design work from Hughes and Cook. However, while the serialisation of &quot;True Faith&quot; had passed largely without comment, the collected edition drew mainstream condemnation and was withdrawn after two months on sale, reportedly on the orders of Maxwell himself. &quot;The Economist&quot; ran an article on the controversy on 19 January 1991, speculating that &quot;no one would think twice about it&quot; if the story was a novel, and felt that the furore was largely caused by the ongoing belief in the press that the comic medium was still exclusively aimed at children.

===Amnesty International and Hitler===

&quot;Crisis&quot; #39 (dated 3 March 1990) was produced in conjunction with charity Amnesty International, based on stories from case histories the pressure group had encountered. The idea was pitched to MacManus by Sarah Sellwood of &#x27;public art service&#x27; Art and Society. Mills was hugely enthusiastic about the idea, which tied into his hopes for the format of &quot;Crisis&quot;. The issue was the first to be distributed directly to the American market, rather than only as an import. Mills and Goldnick hosted a panel at the Institute for Contemporary Art were both were tactfully non-committal about whether the choleric Maxwell - whose close links to the likes of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu were coming under increasing scrutiny - was aware of the issue&#x27;s contents. Later mills would recall however that Maxwell rebuffed complaints from the Jewish Board of Deputies about one story&#x27;s depiction of the actions of Israeli authorities, despite himself being of Jewish extraction. Copies of the issue scheduled for export to Apartheid South Africa were also opposed by solicitors representing condemned prisoners in Upington, who feared it would have negative consequences for their fate until they read an advance copy. The issue also saw a price increase to £1, forced by falling sales - which also saw the abandonment of plans to produce issues in conjunction with the Ark Trust and Campaign Against Arms Trade as &quot;Crisis&quot; tried to find a profitable format. The comic&#x27;s circulation had fallen to 20,000 by this stage

The following issue saw Mills pick Alan Mitchell as a co-writer on &quot;Third World War&quot;, wanting his perspective as a black man to ensure the story rang true, while Ennis began sequel &quot;For a Few Troubles More&quot;, which the author intended to be much more light-hearted; as such it was based on the supporting characters Dougie and Ivor from &quot;Troubled Souls&quot;. Some years later Ennis would revisit the pair again for &quot;Dicks&quot;. &quot;Crisis&quot; #46 saw another controversial strip, &quot;The New Adventures of Hitler&quot;. The story, created by the &quot;Zenith&quot; team of Morrison and Yeowell, had been created for Scottish magazine &quot;Cut&quot; and was based on the claims of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s sister-in-law Bridget Dowling that the future Nazi leader had lived in Liverpool for a period. Morrison used this as a device to satirise Thatcherism but some &quot;Cut&quot; staff objected to the use of Nazi imagery for shock value, and the dispute was leaked to the tabloid press, who reacted in their usual sensationalist fashion. The &quot;Cut&quot; serialisation was ended after three four-page episodes had been published, with the short-lived magazine folding. In a statement inadvertently given to &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper, Morrison used &quot;Crisis&quot; as a negative comparison his aim for the strip; nevertheless shortly afterwards they and Yeowell accepted an offer for the strip to be printed in the Fleetway title. Serialised in &quot;Crisis&quot; #46-49, &quot;The New Adventures of Hitler&quot; ran in the comic without incident.

===Merger with &quot;Revolver&quot;===

Despite the press attention, sales of &quot;Crisis&quot; failed to pick up, and from #50 the title switched to monthly publication. The market for adult comics – which included &quot;Crisis&quot;, &quot;Revolver&quot;, &quot;Deadline&quot;, Marvel UK&#x27;s &quot;Strip&quot; and &quot;Meltdown&quot;, and John Brown Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Blast!&quot; – was contracting rapidly, with the titles fighting among themselves over a dwindling readership. Over the course of the first two monthly issues, MacManus handed the editorship of &quot;Crisis&quot; over to Michael Bennent, who commissioned new stories &quot;Straitgate&quot; (by John Smith and Sean Phillips, #50 to #53), &quot;Insiders&quot; (by Millar and Paul Grist, #54 to #59) and &quot;Bible John - A Forensic Meditation&quot; (by Morrison and Daniel Vallely, #56 to #61), while &quot;Third World War&quot; ended in #53. &quot;Revolver&quot; meanwhile lasted just seven issues before being incorporated into &quot;Crisis&quot; from #56; the merge brought the conclusion of Morrison and Hughes&#x27; revisionist &quot;Dare&quot; and Paul Neary/Steve Parkhouse story &quot;Happenstance and Kismet&quot; but few extra readers. To boost profitability, &quot;Crisis&quot; began printing European stories in a bid to cut costs, including Federico Fellini/Milo Manara collaboration &quot;Trip to Tulum&quot;.

===Cancellation===

Sales continued to drop and the reprints were unpopular with the remaining readers. &quot;Crisis&quot;&#x27; decline took place among increasing press scrutiny into Maxwell&#x27;s business practices, particularly over his links to Mossad, misappropriation of company pension funds, and defaults on loan payments. As costs were cut across the company, &quot;Crisis&quot; was cancelled after #63 (cover-dated October 1991); a month later Maxwell died after falling off of his luxury yacht off the Canary Islands. His business empire collapsed rapidly afterwards, due to the calling in of massive loans and misuse of company pension fund assets, with Fleetway being sold to Danish publishers Egmont. 

Rebellion Developments purchased &quot;2000 AD&quot; and &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot; from Egmont in 2001, and the other Fleetway Publications they still owned in 2016, including the publisher-owned portions of the rights to &quot;Crisis&quot;. They have since issued collected editions of &quot;Third World War&quot; on their Treasury of British Comics imprint, with the first book in January 2020 and the second in January 2021. Promoting the former, Rebellion editor Oliver Pickles felt the story&#x27;s themes were as relevant as they had been on publication. He also suggested he would like to issue a collected version of &quot;New Statesmen&quot;, but the large quantities of the older edition available on the secondary market meant a new version wasn&#x27;t in the company&#x27;s immediate plans.

==Reception==

TV Cream&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Guide To 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s Pop Culture&quot; felt &quot;Crisis&quot; suffered from convoluted storylines and an &quot;overly serious demeanour&quot;, relating that &quot;right from the off it was clear the hip audience it was reaching out for didn&#x27;t like the comic&#x27;s preachy tone&quot;. In a 2011 piece for &quot;Comics Bulletin&quot;, Regie Rigby echoed many of the same concerns, feeling &quot;Crisis&quot; would &quot;denounce you as a &#x27;counter revolutionary running dog lackey of the evil global capitalist military industrial complex&#x27; if you didn&#x27;t instantly agree to join it on the barricades.&quot;

==Legacy==

Pat Mills has frequently been scathing about &quot;Crisis&quot; and many of those involved in the title in subsequent interviews. He would later blame its failure on a lack of sincerity behind some of the writing, feeling it was diluted by &quot;fashionable bandwagoning&quot;, the introduction of European reprints and what he perceived to be a change &quot;into some sub-version of &quot;Deadline&quot;&quot;. He also felt the comic lacked a unifying theme beyond &quot;let&#x27;s be trendy&quot; and took aim at MacManus by stating &quot;There&#x27;re only a few people who can actually create successful comics. The editor of &quot;Crisis&quot; was not amongst them.&quot; In 2021 he described &quot;Crisis&quot; as &quot;putting style above substance, cool above inner beliefs. Maybe that works for some American comic readers, but I think Brits are rather more demanding. We need truth.&quot;

Together with Wagner, Grant, Kevin O&#x27;Neill and Mike McMahon, Mills devised the similarly-themed &quot;Toxic!&quot; in 1991, largely designed in response to the likes of &quot;Crisis&quot; with an emphasis on bad taste. Ironically its life was much the same as that of &quot;Crisis&quot;, with a promising start derailed by an inconsistent line-up, inexperienced creators, the impact of declining sales on providing consistent quality and behind-the-scenes infighting.

<text>The Cheveley Park Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to two-year-old fillies. It is run on the Rowley Mile at Newmarket over a distance of 6 furlongs (1,207 metres) and is scheduled to take place each year in late September.

==History==
The event is named after Cheveley Park, an estate purchased by Harry McCalmont in 1892. It was established in 1899, and Lutetia won the inaugural running.

The race is currently held on the final day of Newmarket&#x27;s three-day Cambridgeshire Meeting, the same day as the Cambridgeshire Handicap.

The leading horses from the Cheveley Park Stakes often go on to compete in the following season&#x27;s 1,000 Guineas. The first to win both was Pretty Polly (1903–04), and the most recent was Special Duty (2009–10).

<doc id="727638" wikidata="Q237586" url="?curid=727638" title="Michelle Smith">
<text>Michelle Smith de Bruin (born 16 December 1969) is an Irish lawyer and retired Olympic swimmer. She won three gold medals at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, for the 400 m individual medley, 400 m freestyle and 200 m individual medley, and also won the bronze medal for the 200 m butterfly event.

Smith&#x27;s rise to dominance in the 1995 European Championships, followed by her wins in Atlanta, all at a relatively advanced age for swimmers, were marked by allegations of doping that were never proven. Smith was later banned for four years by FINA, the international swimming federation, for manipulation of an anti-doping sample by deliberate contamination with alcohol, a decision upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport when Smith appealed. Already superannuated in swimming terms, Smith never returned to competitive swimming and later worked as a barrister, practising under her married name of Michelle Smith de Bruin.

Despite the ban for manipulating samples, none of Smith&#x27;s swimming achievements were shown to have been as a result of using performance enhancers and, therefore, not annulled, so she remains Ireland&#x27;s most successful Olympian.

==Swimming career==

Michelle Smith&#x27;s father taught his daughters how to swim, and Smith was first spotted by a lifeguard in Tallaght swimming pool at age nine. He suggested that Smith&#x27;s father enroll his daughter in a swimming club. Smith joined Terenure Swimming Club and trained under the tutelage of Larry Williamson. Smith won the Dublin and All-Ireland Community Games at aged 9. She won ten gold medals at a novice competition. She enrolled in the King&#x27;s Hospital Swimming Club in 1980. At aged 14, Smith won ten medals at the Irish National Swimming Championships. At 14, she became National Junior and Senior Champion and dominated Irish women&#x27;s swimming until her retirement in 1998. She later swam collegiately at the University of Houston.

Smith first appeared on the world scene as an 18-year-old at the Seoul Olympics and narrowly missed the B-final in the 200 m backstroke (top 16). Smith&#x27;s second major championship was at the 1991 World Championships in Perth, Australia, where she finished 13th in the 400 m individual medley. She competed at the 1991 European Championships and qualified for the 1992 Olympic Games. She competed in the 200 m medley and backstroke and 400 m medley in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, despite suffering an injury in the months leading up to the Games. She finished fifth in the 200 m butterfly at the 1994 World Championships. In that same year, she suffered from glandular fever, which affected her training prior to the World Championships.

In 1995, Smith set Irish records in 50 m, 100 m, 400 m and 800 m freestyle, 100 m backstroke, 100 m and 200 m butterfly, and 200 m and 400 m medley events. She was ranked number 1 in 200 m butterfly, sixth in 100 m butterfly and seventh in 200 m medley; she made sporting history by becoming the first Irishwoman to win a European title in 200 m butterfly and the individual 400 m medley in the same year.

===1996 Olympics===
Smith won three gold medals and a bronze medal in Atlanta. There was controversy at the Games due to Smith qualifying for the 400m freestyle event at the expense of the then-world record holder Janet Evans, who had finished ninth in the preliminary swims with only the top eight advancing. Smith did not submit her qualifying time for the 400m freestyle event before the 5 July deadline but did so two days later with the Irish Olympic officials insisting they had been given permission to submit the qualifying time after the deadline. Smith applied for the event after she had arrived in Atlanta. After Smith qualified at the expense of Evans, the US Swimming Federation, supported by the German and Netherlands swimming teams, challenged a decision to allow Smith to compete but were unsuccessful. At a later conference, Evans highlighted that accusations of Smith doping had been heard by her poolside. Smith later received an apology from Evans.

==Sample tampering ban==
In April 1998, an exclusive by Craig Lord in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper broke the news that Smith faced an anti-doping challenge. Two years after the 1996 Summer Olympics, FINA banned Smith for four years for tampering with her urine sample using alcohol. She appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Her case was heard by a panel of three sport lawyers, including Michael Beloff QC. Unusually for a CAS hearing, Smith&#x27;s case was heard in public at her own lawyer&#x27;s request. FINA submitted evidence from Jordi Segura, head of the IOC-accredited laboratory in Barcelona, that Smith took androstenedione, a metabolic precursor of testosterone, in the previous 10-to-12 hours before being tested. Smith denied this and androstenedione was not a banned substance. The International Olympic Committee banned androstenedione and placed it under the category of androgenic-anabolic steroids in 1997. The CAS upheld the ban.

She was 28 at the time and the ban effectively ended her competitive swimming career. Smith was not stripped of her Olympic medals as she had never tested positive for any banned substances.

Her coach and husband, Erik De Bruin, previously served a four-year ban for using illegal drugs during his career as a discus thrower. Smith has always denied using illegal performance-enhancing drugs.

==Legal career==
During Smith&#x27;s experience at CAS, she developed an interest in the law. After announcing her retirement from swimming in 1999, she returned to university, graduating from University College Dublin with a degree in law. In July 2005 she was conferred with the degree of barrister-at-law of King&#x27;s Inns, Dublin. While a student at the King&#x27;s Inns she won the internal Brian Walsh Moot Court competition. Her book, &quot;Transnational Litigation: Jurisdiction and Procedure&quot; was published in 2008 by Thomson Round Hall.

Smith is a specialist in private international law, the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments, EU law, and the law applicable to disputes following Brexit.

==Other activities==
In 2007, Smith appeared on &quot;Celebrities Go Wild&quot;, an RTÉ reality television show in which eight celebrities had to fend for themselves in the wilds of rural Connemara.

In 1996, she released her autobiography, &quot;Gold&quot;, co-written with Cathal Dervan.

==Personal life==
In 1993 Smith began training with Dutch discus thrower Erik de Bruin, whom she had met in Barcelona. They married in 1996. Smith lives in Kells, County Kilkenny with de Bruin and their two children.

==Legacy==
While Smith technically remains Ireland&#x27;s most successful Olympian, male or female and also still technically holds Irish records for the 200m and 400m freestyle, 200m butterfly, 400m individual medley (long course) and the 400m individual medley (short course) the legitimacy of her achievements is strongly debated in Irish sporting circles.

<text>The Middle Park Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to two-year-old colts. It is run on the Rowley Mile at Newmarket over a distance of 6 furlongs (1,207 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September.

==History==
The event was founded by William Blenkiron, and it is named after his stud at Eltham. It was established in 1866, and was initially titled the Middle Park Plate. It was originally open to horses of either gender.

The race was formerly staged during Newmarket&#x27;s Cambridgeshire Meeting in late September or early October. It was restricted to colts in 1987. It became part of a new fixture called Future Champions Day in 2011.

From 2015, the Middle Park Stakes was moved from Future Champions Day and brought forward two weeks, returning to the Cambridgeshire meeting, to avoid a clash with the similar Dewhurst Stakes.

The Middle Park Stakes was added to the Breeders&#x27; Cup Challenge series in 2012. The winner earned an automatic invitation to compete in the Breeders&#x27; Cup Juvenile Sprint. The Middle Park Stakes was dropped from the Challenge series when the Juvenile Sprint Stakes was discontinued after the 2012 running.

The leading horses from the Middle Park Stakes sometimes go on to compete in the following season&#x27;s 2000 Guineas. The first to win both was Prince Charlie (1871–72), and the most recent was Rodrigo de Triano (1991–92).

<doc id="727643" wikidata="Q1012470" url="?curid=727643" title="Fermoy">
<text>Fermoy () is a town on the River Blackwater in east County Cork, Ireland. As of the 2022 census, the town and environs had a population of approximately 6,700 people. It is located in the historical barony of Condons and Clangibbon, and is in the Dáil constituency of Cork East.

The town&#x27;s name is of Irish origin and refers to a Cistercian abbey founded in the 13th century. This abbey is believed to have been founded by Domnall Mór Ua Briain, King of Thomond.

==History==
===Ancient===
The ringfort at Carntierna on top of Corrin hill, 2.4 km (1.5 mi) south of Fermoy, was an important Iron Age site.

===Medieval times===
A Cistercian abbey was founded in Fermoy in the 13th century. At the dissolution of the monasteries during the Tudor period, the abbey and its lands passed through the following dynasties: Sir Richard Grenville, Robert Boyle and William Forward. However, the site could hardly have been regarded as a town and, by the late 18th century, was little more than a few cabins and an inn.

===18th and 19th centuries===

In 1791, the lands around Fermoy were bought by a Scotsman, John Anderson. He was an entrepreneur who developed the roads and started the mail coach system in Ireland. He designed the town and the streets remain much the same as they were originally built. In 1984, some of his descendants, living in Australia, named a winery, Fermoy Estate, after the town he established. A plaque and bust in his honour were unveiled at the entrance to the town park in 2001.

====Garrison town====
Fermoy was the site of Fermoy Barracks, a large British Army barracks, when Ireland was under British rule. In 1797, when the army was looking to establish a new and permanent base, Anderson gave them the land as an inducement to locate in Fermoy. Anderson and the town received economic benefit from the arrangement. In 1806 the first permanent barracks, the East Barracks, were built. They were located on 16 acres of land, and provided accommodation for 112 officers and 1478 men of infantry, and 24 officers, 120 men, and 112 horses of cavalry. A general 130-bed military hospital was also built. In 1809, the West Barracks was built. This also had a 42-bed hospital. When both barracks were complete, there was accommodation for 14 field officers, 169 officers, 2,816 men, and 152 horses. By the 1830s, this was the largest military establishment on the island of Ireland. The town of Fermoy expanded around these facilities and retained its British military facilities until 1922, when the Irish Free State was first established.

===20th century===

During the Irish War of Independence the Irish Republican Army (led by the commandant of the Cork Number Two Brigade Liam Lynch) launched an attack using motor vehicles against a group of off-duty King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry (KSLI) soldiers on 7 September 1919 as they were attending a Wesleyan Church parade in Fermoy. The IRA killed one soldier (a private named Jones), wounded four and disarmed the rest of their weapons. After jurors from Fermoy serving on Jones&#x27; coroner inquest refused to return a verdict describing his death as a murder, 200 soldiers from the KSLI launched an unofficial reprisal against businesses owned by the jury, looting several drapery and shoe stores.

During the Irish Civil War anti treaty forces were compelled to evacuate Fermoy and burned the barracks and other buildings before retreating into surrounding hills (10 August 1922).

==Demographics==
As of the 2022 census, Fermoy had a population of 6,720. Of these, 66% were white Irish, 1% white Irish travellers, 20% other white ethnicities, 2% were black, 2% Asian, 2% other ethnicities and 7% did not state their ethnicity. In terms of religion the area was 71% Catholic, 9% other stated religions, 13% had no religion, and 7% did not state a religion.

==Geography==
Fermoy is situated on the river Blackwater and has steep hills corresponding to the river valley. The downtown area of Fermoy is located in a flood plain and has flooded relatively often in the late 20th and early 21st century. The most expensive flood prevention works ever carried out in Cork were completed in Fermoy in 2015.

The civil parish of Fermoy incorporates the Fermoy Urban electoral division (ED), much of the Fermoy Rural ED, and includes twelve sub-townlands.

==Economy==
Industries in and around the town include chemical production (by Micro Bio), ice-cream manufacturing (by Silver Pail), and power product manufacturing (by Anderson Power). The town&#x27;s industries also include electronics manufacturing and assembly by Sanmina-SCI Corporation, formerly Space Craft Incorporated.
Moorepark Research Institute, near Fermoy, is one of the Irish state&#x27;s agricultural and food research institutes.

==Education==
Local secondary schools include St. Colman&#x27;s College, Loreto Convent and Coláiste an Chraoibhín. Primary schools include Gaelscoil de hÍde, Presentation Primary School, Bishop Murphy Memorial School, St. Josephs National School, Adair National School and Grange National School.

==Tourism==

The Blackwater river is one of the town&#x27;s major attractions and is popular for its salmon and coarse fishing. There is also a river-side walk amenity at Barnane.

Two annual regattas are usually in early May and early September and hosted by Fermoy Rowing Club. Fermoy Rowing Club celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2009, and Fermoy Regatta celebrated its 70th anniversary in the same year.

Fermoy hosted a poetry festival for the first time in 2012.

==Transport==

For many years the main N8 Cork–Dublin road ran through Fermoy, and the town square was a bottleneck on the route. However, the M8 motorway bypass, which included a new bridge over the Blackwater to the east of the town was opened in late 2006. The former N8 through the town is now a regional road, the R639, and Fermoy&#x27;s traffic problems have been eased.

The town used to be connected to the Irish railway system, on a line from Mallow to Waterford, with a junction to nearby Mitchelstown through Ballindangan (see Irish railway history). Fermoy railway station opened on 17 May 1860, and finally closed on 27 March 1967.

The nearest airport is Cork Airport, approximately to the south.

A number of bus services serve the area, including the Bus Éireann Cork-Dublin and Cork-Clonmel routes, which stop at Fermoy.

==Religion==
The Christian Brothers, the Presentation and Loreto Sisters and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses maintain a presence in the town. There is also a Church of Ireland (Anglican) church, Christ Church, and a Presbyterian church.

In the 1980s, a coming-of-age film called &#x27;Clash of the Ash&#x27; was shot in Fermoy.

==Twin towns==
As of 2020, Fermoy is twinned with Ploemeur, in the Brittany region of France. The two towns have had connections since 1982.

From 2006 until 2020, Fermoy was twinned with Nowa Dęba in Poland. When, in early 2020, it was brought to the attention of Fermoy&#x27;s town council that Nowa Dęba had adopted resolutions against &quot;LGBT ideology&quot; and &quot;propaganda&quot;, the council said that they would end the agreement if Nowa Dęba did not reverse its decision to declare itself an &quot;LGBT-free zone&quot;. This did not happen, and Fermoy&#x27;s town council terminated the twinning agreement in October 2020. In January 2021, Nowa Dęba&#x27;s council voted to revoke the controversial declaration; a decision welcomed by the LGBT community and activists.

==Sport==
Fermoy GAA, the local Gaelic Athletic Association club, won the Cork Premier Intermediate Football Championship in 2018. The club&#x27;s grounds, at &quot;Páirc Mhic Gearailt&quot;, have hosted league and championship games.

<doc id="727645" wikidata="Q1518990" url="?curid=727645" title="La Spezia–Rimini Line">
<text>In the linguistics of the Romance languages, the La Spezia–Rimini Line, also known as the Massa–Senigallia Line, is a line that demarcates a number of important isoglosses that distinguish Romance languages south and east of the line from Romance languages north and west of it. The line divides northern and central Italy, running approximately between the cities of La Spezia and Rimini (or, according to some linguists, between Massa and Senigallia, which lie about 40 kilometres further to the south). Romance languages south and east of it include Italian and the Eastern Romance languages (Romanian, Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, Istro-Romanian), whereas Catalan, French, Occitan, Portuguese, Romansh, Spanish, and the Gallo‒Italic languages are representatives of the Western group. In this classification, the Sardinian language is not part of either Western or Eastern Romance.

It has been suggested that the origin of these developments is to be found during the last decades of the Western Roman Empire and the Ostrogothic Kingdom (–535 AD). During this period, the area of Italy north of the line was dominated by an increasingly Germanic Roman army of (northern) Italy, followed by the Ostrogoths; the Roman Senate and Papacy became the dominant social elements south of the line. As for the provinces outside Italy, the social influences in Gaul and Iberia were broadly similar to those in northern Italy, whereas the Balkans were dominated by the Byzantine Empire at this time (and later, by Slavic peoples). In either case, it coincides approximately with the northern range of the Apennine Mountains, which could have helped the development of these linguistic differences.

Generally speaking, the Western Romance languages have common innovations that the eastern Romance languages tend to lack. The three isoglosses considered traditionally are:
* the formation of the plural form of nounsbased on the Latin accusative case in Western Romance and on the nominative case in Eastern Romance;
* the voicing(in Western Romance) or not (in Eastern Romance) of some Latin voiceless consonants;
* the pronunciation of Latin &quot;c&quot; before front vowels as (in Western Romance) or (in Eastern Romance).

To these should be added a fourth criterion, generally more decisive than the phenomenon of voicing:
* preservation (in Eastern Romance) or simplification (in Western Romance) of Latin geminate consonants.

== Plural of nouns ==

North and west of the line (excluding all Northern Italian varieties) the plural of nouns was adapted from the Latin accusative case, and is marked with regardless of grammatical gender or declension. South and east of the line, the plurals of nouns are marked by changing the final vowel, either because these were taken from the Latin nominative case, or because the original changed into a vocalic sound (see the Romance plurals origin debate). Compare the plurals of cognate nouns in Aromanian, Romanian, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, French, Sardinian and Latin:

== Result of &quot;ci&quot;/&quot;ce&quot; palatalization ==
The pronunciation of Latin &quot;ci&quot;/&quot;ce&quot;, as in and , has a divide between different affricates that roughly follows the line: Italian and Romanian use palatal (as in English church), while most Western Romance languages use non-palatal (later or ). The exceptions are some Gallo-Italic languages immediately north of the line, as well as Mozarabic and (partially) Norman.

== Voicing and degemination of consonants ==
Another isogloss boundary that coincides with La Spezia–Rimini Line deals with the restructured voicing of voiceless consonants, mainly Latin sounds , and , which occur between vowels. Thus, Latin (&#x27;chain&#x27;) becomes &quot;catena&quot; in Italian, but &quot;cadeia&quot; in Portuguese, &quot;cadena&quot; in Catalan and Spanish, &quot;cadéna&quot;/&quot;cadèina&quot; in Emilian, &quot;caéna/cadéna&quot; in Venetian and &quot;chaîne&quot; in French (with loss of intervocalic ). Voicing, or further weakening, even to loss of these consonants is characteristic of the western branch of Romance; their retention is characteristic of eastern Romance.

However, the differentiation is not totally systematic, and there are exceptions to the isogloss: Gascon dialects in south-west France and Aragonese in northern Aragon, Spain (geographically Western Romance) also retain the original Latin voiceless stop between vowels. The presence in Tuscany and elsewhere below the line of a small percentage but large number of voiced forms both in general vocabulary and in traditional toponyms also challenges its absolute integrity. 

The criterion of preservation vs. simplification of Latin geminate consonants is more definite. The simplification illustrated by Spanish &quot;boca&quot; &#x27;mouth&#x27; vs. Tuscan &quot;bocca&quot; , both continuations of Latin , typifies all of Western Romance and is systematic for all geminates except (pronounced differently if single/double even in French), in some locales (e.g. Spanish &quot;carro&quot; and &quot;caro&quot; are still distinct), and to some degree for earlier and which, while not preserved as geminates, did not generally merge with the singletons (e.g. &gt; but &gt; in Spanish, &gt; &#x27;year&#x27;). Nevertheless, the La Spezia–Rimini line is real in this respect for most of the consonant inventory, although simplification of geminates to the east in Romania spoils the neat east-west division. 

Indeed, the significance of the La Spezia–Rimini Line is often challenged by specialists of both Romance dialectology and Italian dialectology. One reason is that while it demarcates preservation (and expansion) of phonemic geminate consonants (Central and Southern Italy) from their simplification (in Northern Italy, Gaul, and Iberia), the areas affected do not correspond consistently with those defined by voicing criterion. Romanian, which on the basis of lack of voicing, &quot;i&quot;-plurals and palatalisation to is classified with Central and Southern Italian, has experienced simplification of geminates, a defining characteristic of Western Romance, after the rhotacism of intervocalic .

<text>|}























The Champion Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to thoroughbreds aged three years or older. It is run at Ascot over a distance of 1 mile 1 furlong and 212 yards (2,004 metres), and it is scheduled to take place as part of British Champions Day each year in October.

==History==
The event was established in 1877, and it was originally held at Newmarket. The inaugural running was won by Springfield. By the end of the century it had been won by five Classic winners.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the Champion Stakes was classed at the highest level, Group 1.

The race was included in the Breeders&#x27; Cup Challenge series in 2009 and 2010. The winner earned an automatic invitation to compete in the Breeders&#x27; Cup Turf.

The Champion Stakes was transferred to Ascot in 2011. It became part of a newly created fixture called British Champions Day. It now serves as the middle-distance final of the British Champions Series.

With an increased prize fund of £1,300,000, the Champion Stakes was Britain&#x27;s richest horse race in 2011. The status was reclaimed by The Derby in 2012.

<doc id="727659" wikidata="Q605258" url="?curid=727659" title="Gerber format">
<text>The Gerber format is an open, ASCII, vector format for printed circuit board (PCB) designs. It is the &quot;de facto&quot; standard used by PCB industry software to describe the printed circuit board images: copper layers, solder mask, legend, drill data, etc.
The standard file extension is codice_1 or codice_2 though other extensions like codice_3, codice_4 or codice_5 are also used. It is documented by The Gerber Layer Format Specification and some related (but less universally supported) extensions such as XNC drill files and GerberJob to convey information about the entire PCB, as opposed to single layers.

Gerber is used in PCB fabrication data. PCBs are designed on a specialized electronic design automation (EDA) or a computer-aided design (CAD) system. The CAD systems output PCB fabrication data to allow fabrication of the board. This data typically contains a Gerber file for each image layer (copper layers, solder mask, legend or silk...). Gerber is also the standard image input format for all bare board fabrication equipment needing image data, such as photoplotters, legend printers, direct imagers or automated optical inspection (AOI) machines and for viewing reference images in different departments. For assembly the fabrication data contains the solder paste layers and the central locations of components to create the stencil and place and bond the components.

There are two major generations of Gerber format:
* Extended Gerber, or RS-274X. This is the current Gerber format. In 2014, the graphics format was extended with the option to add meta-information to the graphics objects. Files with attributes are called X2 files; those without attributes are X1 files.
* Standard Gerber, or RS-274-D. This obsolete format was revoked.

The official website contains the specification, test files, notes and the Reference Gerber Viewer to support users and especially developers of Gerber software.

==PCB fabrication data==

PCBs are designed on a specialized electronic design automation (EDA) or a computer-aided design (CAD) system. The CAD systems then outputs PCB fabrication data to allow fabrication of the board. Fabrication data contains a Gerber file for each image layer and drill span (copper layers, solder mask, legend or silk...) (For historic reasons drill data is also transferred in NC formats although Gerber files are often of better quality.) Typically, all these files are &quot;zipped&quot; into a single archive that is sent to the PCB bare board fabrication shop. The fabricator loads them into a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) system to prepare data for each step of the PCB production process.

The .FileFunction attribute is the standardized method to link each layer in the PCB with its corresponding Gerber file in the fabrication data. 

If attributes are not supported, then only informal methods are available. A simple informal method is to express the file function clearly in the file name. Sometimes the file extension is abused to indicate the file function - e.g. .BOT for the bottom layer rather than the standard extension .GBR. In industry this is considered poor practice and engineers should use the appropriate X2 attribute instead.

PCB Fabrication Data must comply with a number of rules: all layers must be aligned, a profile layer must be included, etc.

The CAD netlist can be embedded in the Gerber files. However, for historic reasons, netlists often are described in a separate file in IPC-D-356A, an electrical test format.

The material stack up, components and finishes are typically provided in informal text files or drawings. In 2018 Ucamco has published a specification for an extension of the Gerber format to cover this fabrication documentation.

==Extended Gerber==
RS-274X, extended Gerber or X-Gerber, was originally released in September 1998.

It is a human readable ASCII format. It consists of a stream of commands generating an ordered stream of graphics objects. The graphics objects can be positive or negative. Superimposed in the correct order they create the final image.

A Gerber file contains the complete description of a PCB layer image without requiring any external files. It has all the imaging operators needed for a PCB image. Any aperture shape can be defined. Planes and pads can be specified without the need to paint or vector-fill as in Standard Gerber. (However some implementations still use painting, problematic for the users of those files.)

Released in February 2014, Gerber X2 adds additional metadata to the image. Attributes allow adding metadata to a Gerber file. Attributes are akin to labels providing information associated with image files, or features within them. Examples of metadata conveyed by attributes are:
* The function of the file. Is the file the top solder mask, or the bottom copper layer, etc.?
* The part represented by the file. Does it represent a single PCB, an array, a coupon?
* The function of a pad. Is the flash an SMD pad, or a via pad, or a fiducial, etc.
For more information about attributes see X2 FAQ or intro video in the external links.

In 2020, Gerber X3 was introduced.

Fabrication documentation such as finish, overall thickness and materials is specified in a separate Gerber Job File.

An example of a Gerber file:

The format specification is published at the official website.

==Standard Gerber (revoked)==
Standard Gerber was revoked in 2014. It was already obsolete after the introduction of the much more capable Extended Gerber in 1998.

Standard Gerber was a numerical control (NC) format designed by Gerber Systems Corp to drive their vector photo plotters for the PCB industry in the 1960s and 1970s. It was a subset of the Electronic Industries Association RS-274-D specification, a format to drive mechanical NC machines in a wide range of industries. It was widely used to drive vector plotters. Standard Gerber was a simple ASCII format consisting of commands and XY coordinates. An example:

A Standard Gerber is an NC standard but not an image description standard: essential image information such the coordinate unit and the &quot;apertures&quot; definitions are not standardized. (Apertures are the basic shapes, similar to fonts in a PDF file.) They are described in a free-format sidecar text file intended for human reading, called an &quot;aperture file&quot; or a &quot;wheel file&quot;. There are no standards for wheel files. The sender and receiver have to agree on their meaning case-by-case.

Standard Gerber supports only the simple imaging operators that a vector plotter is capable of - drawing tracks and flashing apertures. This is insufficient for efficient PCB fabrication data. Copper pours must be created by &quot;painting&quot; (aka &quot;stroking&quot; or &quot;vector-filling&quot;) them with a vast number of tracks. All but the simplest pads are also painted because of the cost creating a corresponding physical aperture. Painting creates the intended image but results in very large files that take long time to process and need error-prone manual work in CAM.

Standard Gerber was intended for a manual workflow using an NC machine called a vector photoplotter: the plotter operator loads the paper tape with the Standard Gerber file on the plotter, manually sets the coordinate unit on the machine console and mounts the aperture wheel described in the accompanying wheel file. (An aperture wheel is a rotating disk on which physical apertures are mounted, and by rotating the wheel the photoplotter selects the aperture to use.) Standard Gerber is not suitable for automated data transfer between PCB designers and manufacturers.

==History==
The Gerber file format is named after Joseph Gerber, an entrepreneur and inventor who pioneered vector photoplotters.

In 1980 Gerber Systems Corp. published the first edition of the &quot;Gerber Format: a subset of EIA RS-274-D; plot data format reference book&quot;, a subset of EIA RS-274-D it used to drive their line of vector photoplotters. This format became known as Standard Gerber and was adopted by several other photoplotter vendors. Standard Gerber became the de facto standard image format for PCB fabrication.

In 1991 with the availability of the more capable raster photoplotters, the Gerber format was extended with polygon areas and &quot;mass parameters&quot;. These allow the user to dynamically define apertures of different shapes and sizes, as well as defining polygon area fills without the need for &quot;painting&quot;. It became a superset of RS-274-D standard Gerber. The impetus to develop mass parameters was provided by AT&amp;T. This created a family of input formats, each one dedicated to a specific Gerber plotter model. 
In April 1998 Gerber Systems Corp. was taken over by Barco ETS, Barco&#x27;s PCB division, which is now called Ucamco. In September 1998 Ucamco published the &quot;RS-274X Format User&#x27;s Guide&quot;, a specification which unified the family of formats to a single image format, revoking a large number of model-specific constructs. The format became known as Extended Gerber or GerberX. Extended Gerber quickly superseded Standard Gerber as the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for PCB image data. This became the de facto image standard for the PCB industry. It is sometimes called &quot;the backbone of the electronics industry&quot;.

In the course of 2012 the format was comprehensively reviewed in &quot;the great reform&quot;. A representative library of 10,000 files from all over the world was investigated to establish current practice. Constructs that were rarely or never used were deprecated. Constructs with unclear interpretations were clarified. The specification document was re-organized and its quality improved. This resulted in revision I1 to I4 of the specification, published from December 2012 on. The result was a simple, but powerful format, focused on the current needs of the PCB industry. This version of the Gerber format was developed by Karel Tavernier and Rik Breemeersch from Ucamco.

In June 2013 Ucamco published a proposal to add three new commands to the Gerber format which allow inclusion of image attributes conveying metadata attached to the image and its components. It invited feedback from the Gerber users before committing these ideas to a firm specification. This process resulted in revision J1 in February 2014, updated with further revisions until revision 2015.07. Including metadata adds intelligence to the format. It converts a mere image description format to a full-fledged PCB data transfer format. This is called &quot;the second extension&quot; and results what is known as &quot;Gerber X2&quot;, Gerber X1 being the pure image format. Gerber X2 is fully backward compatible with X1, as the attributes do not affect the image. Gerber X2 was developed by Karel Tavernier, Ludek Brukner and Thomas Weyn.

In September 2014 Ucamco revoked Standard Gerber.

In August 2015 Ucamco published a draft specification adding nested step and repeat and block apertures to make panel descriptions more efficient, calling for comments from the user community. The final specification was published in November 2016 after substantial input. This revision was developed by Karel Tavernier and Rik Breemeersch. Shortly afterwards the Cuprum Gerber viewer developed the first implementation.

In July 2016 Ucamco published a draft specification to include netlist information in Gerber, calling for input from the user community. After a number of revisions of the draft triggered by input from users, the draft was finalized on 2 October 2016.

In March 2017 Ucamco published a draft specification to include fabrication documentation in Gerber calling for input from the user community. There was a lively discussion, the draft went through seven public revisions before being finalized early April 2018.

In June 2017 a free online &quot;Reference Gerber Viewer&quot; was made available by Ucamco as a complement to the specification. It is updated with new functionality from time to time.

In October 2019 Ucamco published a draft specification to include component information in Gerber data, calling for comments from the user community. The proposal re-uses existing syntax and hence is backward compatible. Although it does not introduce new syntax it extends Gerber into a new domain, and the name Gerber X3 is suggested. The draft specification was developed by Karel Tavernier.

== Other PCB formats ==
Over the years there have been several attempts to replace Gerber by formats containing more information than just the layer image, e.g. netlist or component information. None of these attempts have been widely accepted within the electronics manufacturing industry, probably because the formats are complex. Gerber remains the most widely used data transfer format.

* IPC-D-350 C &quot;Printed Board Description in Digital Format&quot;, 1989. This specification was standardized as IEC 61182–1 in 1992 and withdrawn in 2001. Rarely used.
* DXF Sometimes used. These are typically constructed as drawings, PCB objects (tracks and pads) are lost, which makes them very difficult to use in CAM.
* PDF Sometimes used. 
* DPF Format, now at v7, a CAM format from Ucamco. Sometimes used.
* The &quot;Electronic Design Interchange Format&quot;, EDIF. Rarely used.
* ODB++, a CAM format from Mentor Graphics. Sometimes used, the prevalent non-Gerber format.
* GenCAM: IPC-2511A &quot;Generic Requirements for Implementation of Product Manufacturing Description Data and Transfer Methodology&quot;, 2000. Rarely used.
* GenCAM: IPC-2511B &quot;Generic Requirements for Implementation of Product Manufacturing Description Data and Transfer XML Schema Methodology&quot;, 2002. Rarely used.
* Offspring: IPC-2581 &quot;Generic Requirements for Printed Board Assembly Products Manufacturing Description Data and Transfer Methodology&quot;, 2004. Rarely used, but receiving more attention recently.
* STEP AP210: ISO 10303-210, &quot;Electronic assembly interconnect and packaging design&quot;, first edition 2001, second edition 2008 (to be published)

The Futurity Trophy is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to two-year-old thoroughbred colts and fillies. It is run at Doncaster over a distance of 1 mile (1,609 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late October.

==History==
The event was established in 1961 and was originally called the Timeform Gold Cup. It was founded by Phil Bull, the creator of Timeform, and was backed by this organisation until 1964.

The &quot;Observer&quot; started to support the event in 1965. The present grading system was introduced in 1971 and the Observer Gold Cup was classed at Group-1 level.

The bookmaker William Hill took over the sponsorship in 1976, and from this point the event was known as the Futurity Stakes. From 1989 to 2017 the race was sponsored by the Racing Post and run as the Racing Post Trophy. William Hill reestablished their race partnership in 2024 with the official title now the William Hill Futurity Trophy Stakes.

Up to 2000 the race was run on the round mile from 2001 it was run on the Straight Mile

The Futurity Trophy is now the last Group 1 event of the British flat racing season. The 2019 race was run on Newcastle&#x27;s Tapeta track, after the Doncaster meeting was abandoned because of waterlogging, thereby becoming the first British Group 1 race to be run on an artificial surface.

Six winners have subsequently achieved victory in the following year&#x27;s Derby: Reference Point (1986); High Chaparral (2001); Motivator (2004); Authorized (2006);
Camelot (2011); Auguste Rodin (2022).

<text>The Toy Manchester Terrier is a breed of dog, categorized as a terrier. The breed was bred down in size in North America from the Manchester Terrier, and is placed in the Toy Group by the American Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel Club (the Manchester Terrier is placed in the Terrier Group). Neither the Fédération Cynologique Internationale nor The Kennel Club recognize a Toy variety of the Manchester Terrier.

== History ==

The Manchester Terrier, from which the Toy Manchester Terrier was bred, was developed in the 19th century from crosses between an old Black and Tan Terrier with the Whippet, along with other breeds, primarily for rat-catching. In England, another breed was also developed in the 19th century in Manchester, the English Toy Terrier, as a separate breed from the Manchester Terrier. The English Toy Terrier was a popular pet in Victorian England, and bred to be very small, some weighing as little as 1 kg (2.2 lbs.)

The Toy Manchester Terrier breed was developed by breeding down the Manchester Terrier in size. In the United States in the 1920s the breed was called the Toy Black and Tan Terrier. The name was changed to the Toy Manchester Terrier and the American Toy Manchester Terrier Club was formed in the 1930s. The American Toy Manchester Terrier was recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1938, but by the 1950s the breed had declined and the breed club ceased to exist. Due to declining numbers of the breed, the Toy Manchester Terrier breed was re-defined as a size division of the Manchester Terrier in 1958 by the American Kennel Club, and the club name (including the two breeds as varieties) was changed to the American Manchester Terrier Club in 1958.

In England, the very similar English Toy Terrier (Black &amp; Tan) has also declined, to the point where it is listed by the Kennel Club as being in danger of extinction. In order to rescue the breed, the Kennel Club has opened the stud book to allow certain selected examples of the North American Toy Manchester Terrier to be registered and bred as an English Toy Terrier (Black &amp; Tan). However, the two breeds are not considered to be identical, and the standards for the two breeds show different requirements.

== Appearance ==
The Toy Manchester Terrier in North America is a small, long-legged dog with a short coat marked with tan, a long tail and ears which stand upright. In color and general conformation the Toy Manchester Terrier follows the standard for the Manchester Terrier. However, the Toy Manchester Terrier cannot exceed 12 pounds (5.4 kg) in weight; and, unlike the larger Manchester Terrier, for the Toy Manchester Terrier, cropped ears are a disqualification. Ears should be wide at the base and pointed at the tip. Flaring &quot;bell&quot; ears are a serious fault, meaning that it is undesirable to breed a dog with such ears; it does not mean that the dog has any disadvantages as a companion.

=== Black and Tan ===
Black and Tan is a dog coat colour that derives from one of the alleles known to exist at the genes mapped in dogs, and can be recognised with genetic testing (agouti gene, at at).

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

== Similar breeds ==
The English Toy Terrier (Black and Tan) is considered to be the same breed as the Toy Manchester Terrier. In contrast with the Toy Manchester Terrier though, the desirable size for the English Toy Terrier (Black and Tan) is slightly smaller, and wider ears are also preferred.

While the visual similarities of the Miniature Pinscher, another toy dog that somewhat resembles the Toy Manchester Terrier, remain a matter of controversy, genetic research (published in 2017) has shown that the two breeds have shared, unique ancestry. The ancestors of the Toy Manchester and Miniature Pinscher may have become geographically separated many centuries ago and retained similarities simply through breeding selection for the same traits; nevertheless, the 2017 also showed that the two breeds remain more closely related to each other than to other breeds. 

The Russian Toy is another similar dog, developed in Russia from early imports of the English Toy Terrier. They may be of various colours, not just Black and Tan, indicating a possible background in other breeds as well.

<doc id="727695" wikidata="Q7820503" url="?curid=727695" title="Tomás Pérez">
<text>Tomás Orlando Pérez Garcia (born December 29, 1973) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball infielder and current batting practice pitcher for the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball (MLB). Pérez was a utility infielder who throws right-handed and switch hits. As of 2019, he is an infield instructor for the Atlanta Braves.

Before landing in Philadelphia in 2000, Pérez had played for the Toronto Blue Jays from 1995 to 1998, where he was selected under the provisions of the Rule 5 draft. He has also played for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and the Houston Astros at the MLB level. Pérez is considered to be versatile because of his ability to play all four infield positions.

==Professional career==
Pérez had his best year in 2003. Shifted between third base, second base, first base, shortstop, right field, and also as an emergency pitcher, Pérez was an asset off the bench. Known for throwing shaving cream pies, Pérez was a popular player with both fans and teammates alike in his six years in Philadelphia.

Despite being signed through 2006, Pérez was released by the Phillies on April 2, 2006; he signed a contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on April 6. On Mother&#x27;s Day, May 14, 2006, Perez was one of more than 50 hitters who brandished a pink bat to benefit the Breast Cancer Foundation. In 2006, he became the fourth player in Tampa Bay history to have four extra-base hits in a game, a feat that wasn&#x27;t again matched by a Rays player until Sam Fuld did in April 2011.

On May 30, 2007, he was traded from the Los Angeles Dodgers to the Chicago White Sox for Dwayne Pollok. Through 2008, Pérez was a .240 hitter with 24 home runs and 180 RBI in 789 games. On November 22, 2007, Perez signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Houston Astros. He was added to the 25-man roster by the end of spring training. He played 8 games in the majors for Houston and became a free agent at the end of the season.

He signed with the Colorado Rockies in March 2009 but was released by the organization a month later.

On February 9, 2011 Italian baseball team Bbc Grosseto signed Tomàs Pérez to one-year contract, but he was waived on March 6 due to an elbow injury.

Perez was named as the infield coach for the A advanced Florida Fire Frogs in the Atlanta Braves organization for the 2018 season.

<text>Samuel Baldwin Marks Young (January 9, 1840 – September 1, 1924) was a United States Army general. He also served as the first president of Army War College between 1902 and 1903. He then served from 1903 until 1904 as the first Chief of Staff of the United States Army.

==Biography==
Young was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to John Young Jr. and Hannah Scott Young. He was educated at Jefferson College (now Washington &amp; Jefferson College) and married Margaret McFadden in 1861.

On the outbreak of the Civil War, he joined the 12th Pennsylvania Infantry in April 1861 as a private. After the expiration of his term he was commissioned captain, 4th Pennsylvania Cavalry in September. He served with distinction in the Army of the Potomac throughout the war, receiving promotion to major in September 1862, to lieutenant colonel in October 1864 and to colonel in December 1864. Young was wounded four times in 1864 and 1865. He served in brigade command in the cavalry corps during the last days of the Appomattox Campaign. He was mustered out of the volunteers on July 1, 1865.

After the war, Young joined the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States—a military society for officers who had served the Union in the Civil War. He was also a member of the Society of the Army of the Potomac.

After the Civil War he rejoined the Regular Army as a first lieutenant in May 1866, and was promoted to captain of the 8th Cavalry in July 1866. On December 11, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Young for appointment to the brevet rank of brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from April 9, 1865, in recognition for his services in the Siege of Petersburg and the Appomattox Campaign. The U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on February 6, 1867.

Young served with distinction throughout the Indian Wars and was regularly promoted (to major in 1883 and to lieutenant colonel in 1892), rising to the rank of colonel of the 3rd Cavalry in 1897.

On the commencement of hostilities with Spain, he was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers in May 1898. In Cuba during the war, he commanded one of two cavalry brigades that were part of the Cavalry Division under Major General Joseph Wheeler. Young&#x27;s brigade included Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Rough Riders, the 1st US Volunteer Cavalry Regiment. In July 1898, after the American victory of the Battle of San Juan Hill, Young assumed command of the Wheeler&#x27;s Cavalry Division and was made major general of volunteers while he commanded that same division in Cuba after the Santiago Campaign of the Spanish–American War. That same year, Young became a Veteran Companion of the Missouri Commandery of the Military Order of Foreign Wars. Young was also a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.
During the Philippine–American War, he returned to the rank of brigadier general of volunteers and commanded brigades in the Northern Luzon District, of which he was made military governor.

From February 1901 to March 1902, he commanded the military district of California from the Presidio of San Francisco. Under the new General Staff System, he was appointed as the first chief of staff of the General Staff in August 1903, a position he held until retirement in January 1904.

From 1909 to 1910, he was president of the board of inquiry that investigated the alleged riot of black soldiers of the 25th U.S. Infantry at Brownsville, Texas, August 13, 1906, and affirmed the subsequent dishonorable discharge of 159 men by order of President Theodore Roosevelt.

As Acting Superintendent of Yellowstone National Park at Fort Yellowstone in 1897 (after a stint in the same role at Yosemite in 1896) Colonel Young introduced fish conservation measures. In 1907 after his retirement, he was appointed full Superintendent by the Secretary of the Interior. He served as full Superintendent for two years. He died at his house in Helena, Montana, and was honored with a state funeral in Washington, D.C., and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Family==
Samuel and Margaret Young were the parents of seven children, six daughters and a son: Edith (1865–1940); Burton (called Hannah) (1866–1944); Lillian (1868–1956); Marjorie (1872–1956); Eliza (1880–1883); Ranald Mackenzie (1880–1882); and Elizabeth (1883–1966).

In 1886, his daughter Burton (Hannah) married George Windle Read, who attained the rank of major general and was a division and corps commander of the American Expeditionary Force during World War I. Their children included Burton Young Read (1889–1981), a career soldier who served from the early 1900s through World War II before retiring as a colonel, and George Windle Read Jr., a career soldier who served in both world wars and attained the rank of lieutenant general as commander of the US Army Armor Center and the Second United States Army.

In 1886, his daughter Edith became the wife of army officer John Thornton Knight. Their son, John Thornton Knight, Jr. (1894–1989), was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism in action while serving in France during World War I.

In 1901, his daughter Marjorie married army surgeon John Heysham Gibbon, the nephew of Civil War and Indian War commander John Gibbon. John H. and Marjorie Gibbon were the parents of John Heysham Gibbon.

In 1903, Young&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth became the wife of Army officer John Robert Rigby Hannay.

In 1913, his daughter Lillian, who had become active in the Christian Science church, married Eugene R. Cox (1856–1921), a Chicago attorney and businessman who later relocated to New York and also played a prominent role in the operations of the Christian Science church.

<text>Roy Archibald Young (May 17, 1882 – December 31, 1960) was an American banker who served as the 4th chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1927 to 1930. During his tenure as chairman, the Wall Street crash of 1929 occurred, which signaled the beginning of the Great Depression. Before and after his term at the Federal Reserve Board, Young also served as the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis from 1919 to 1927 and Federal Reserve Bank of Boston from 1930 to 1942.

==Early life==
Roy A. Young was born on May 17, 1882, to James Wilson Young a miller and millwright from Ontario, Canada and Julia Healy an Irish immigrant in Marquette, Michigan. Young was a messenger for a bank at the age of eight. He then worked as assistant cashier and joined the Citizens National Bank as vice president in 1913.

== Career ==
From 1919 to 1927 he was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis before becoming chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. From 1930 to 1942 he served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. After his resignation, he changed to become chairman of the Merchants National Bank and later chairman of American Woolen Company.

During his term in office as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board there was confrontation between the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under George L. Harrison of how to curb speculation that led &quot;inter alia&quot; to the stock market boom of the late 1920s. The Board was in favor of putting &quot;direct pressure&quot; on the lending member banks while the Federal Reserve Bank of New York wanted to raise the discount rate.

The Board under Young disapproved this step, however Young himself was not fully convinced that the policy of using pressure would work and refused to sign the &quot;1929 Annual Report&quot; of the Board because it contained parts favorable to this policy.

== Death ==
He died on December 31, 1960, in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.

&quot;Pinus sibirica&quot; is a member of the white pine group, &quot;Pinus&quot; subgenus &quot;Strobus&quot;, and like all members of that group, the leaves (&#x27;needles&#x27;) are in fascicles (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. They are 5–10 cm long. Siberian pine cones are 5–9 cm long. The 9–12 mm long seeds have only a vestigial wing and are dispersed by spotted nutcrackers.

Siberian pine is treated as a variety or subspecies of the very similar Swiss pine (&quot;Pinus cembra&quot;) by some botanists. It differs in having slightly larger cones, and needles with three resin canals instead of two in Swiss pine.

Like other European and Asian white pines, Siberian pine is very resistant to white pine blister rust (&quot;Cronartium ribicola&quot;). This fungal disease was accidentally introduced from Europe into North America, where it has caused severe mortality in the American native white pines in many areas, notably the closely related whitebark pine. Siberian pine is of great value for research into hybridisation and genetic modification to develop rust resistance in these species.
==Distribution==
In the north of its range, it grows at low altitudes, typically 100–200 m, whereas further south, it is a mountain tree, growing at 1,000-2,400 m altitude. It often reaches the alpine tree line in this area. The mature size is up to 30–40 m height, and 1.5 m trunk diameter. Its maximum lifetime is 800–850 years.
==Cultivation==

Siberian pine, &quot;Pinus sibirica&quot;, is a popular ornamental tree in parks and large gardens where the climate is cold, such as central Canada, giving steady though not fast growth on a wide range of sites. It is very tolerant of severe winter cold, hardy down to at least –60 °C, and also of wind exposure.

The seeds are also harvested and sold as pine nuts, which in Russia are marketed as &quot;Cedar nuts&quot; ().

== &quot;Siberian cedar&quot; ==
The Russian name Сибирский кедр (tr. Sibirsky kedr) is usually translated in English as &quot;Siberian cedar.&quot; References to &quot;cedar&quot; or &quot;dwarf cedar&quot; in texts translated from Russian usually refer to this tree or related pines, not to true cedars.

== Chemistry ==
Pinostilbene is a stilbenoid found, along with resveratrol, in the bark of &quot;P. sibirica&quot;.

<text>Shantiniketan (IPA: ) is a neighbourhood of Bolpur town in the Bolpur subdivision of Birbhum district in West Bengal, India, approximately 152 km north of Kolkata. It was established by Maharshi Devendranath Tagore, and later expanded by his son, Rabindranath Tagore whose vision became what is now a university town with the creation of Visva-Bharati. It is also the birthplace of Amartya Sen, an Economist, Philosopher, &amp; Nobel Laureate

It was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List by the World Heritage Committee in 2023.

==History==
In 1863, Debendranath Tagore took on permanent lease of land, with two (Alstonia scholaris) trees, at an annual payment of Rs. 5, from Bhuban Mohan Sinha, the talukdar 
in Raipur, Birbhum. He built a guest house there and named it &quot;Shantiniketan&quot; (the abode of peace). Gradually, the whole area came to be known as Shantiniketan.

Binoy Ghosh says that Bolpur was a small place in the middle of the 19th century. It grew as Shantiniketan grew. A certain portion of Bolpur was a part of the &quot;zamindari&quot; of the Sinha family of Raipur. Bhuban Mohan Sinha had developed a small village in the Bolpur area and named it Bhubandanga. It was just opposite Shantiniketan of those days. Bhubandanga was the den of a gang of notorious dacoits, who had no compunction in killing people. It led to a situation of conflict and confrontation, but the leader of the gang, ultimately, surrendered to Debendranath, and they started helping him in developing the area. There was a tree under which Debendranath used to meditate. Inspired by The Crystal Palace built originally in Hyde Park, London, to house the Great Exhibition of 1851 and later relocated, Debendranath constructed a 60-foot × 30-foot hall for Brahmo prayers. The roof was tiled and the floor had white marble, but the rest of the structure was made of glass. From its earliest days, it was a great attraction for people from all around.

Rabindranath Tagore first visited Shantiniketan on 27 January 1878 when he was 17 years old. In 1888, Debendranath dedicated the entire property for the establishment of a Brahmavidyalaya through a trust deed. In 1901, Rabindranath started a Brahmacharyaashrama and it came to be known as Patha Bhavana from 1925. In 1913, Rabindranath Tagore won the Nobel Prize in Literature. It was a new feather in the cap of the Tagore family which was the leading family contributing to the enrichment of life and society in Bengal in many fields of activity over a long period of time. The environment at Jorasanko Thakur Bari, one of the bases of the Tagore family in Kolkata, was filled with literature, music, painting, and theatre. Founded in 1921 by Rabindranath Tagore, Visva Bharati was declared to be a central university and an institute of national importance, in 1951.

==Topography==
===Location===
Shantiniketan is situated at . at an average elevation of 56 metres (187 feet).

The area is flanked on two sides by the rivers, the Ajay and the Kopai. Santiniketan earlier had an extensive forest cover, but substantial soil erosion gave certain areas a barren look, the resulting phenomenon is locally known as &quot;khoai&quot;. However, as a result of the consistent efforts by botanists, plants and trees from all over India flourish in parts of the town. Although the overall environment of the surrounding areas have changed with time, the core area of Santiniketan has retained its closeness with nature.

In the 2011 census, Santiniketan is not identified as a separate place. In the map of Bolpur-Sriniketan CD block on page 718 of District Census Handbook Birbhum (Part A), the area occupied by Santiniketan is shown as a part of Bolpur municipal area and Sriniketan is shown as a part of Surul, a census town.

===Notable places===
As per the &quot;Human Development Report&quot; for Birbhum in 2009, Santiniketan attracted 1.2 million tourists annually.

Rabindra Bhavana, founded in 1942, just after the death of the poet, is the focal point of Visva Bharati. It has a museum, archives, library and other units. It houses a major part of Rabindranath&#x27;s manuscripts, correspondence, paintings and sketches, 40,000 volumes of books and 12,000 volumes of bound journals, photographs and numerous items associated with the poet&#x27;s life. It is generally one of the first points of interest for anybody visiting Santiniketan. It was established by the poet&#x27;s son, Rathindranath Tagore, as a memorial museum and research centre for Tagore studies.

The Uttarayana Complex, which lies in the northern portion of the town and is located next to Rabindra Bhavana, features a collection of five houses built by Rabindranath – &quot;Udayan&quot;, &quot;Shyamali&quot;, &quot;Konark&quot;, &quot;Udichi&quot; and &quot;Punascha&quot;. The gardens in the Uttarayan complex were planned and laid out by Rathindranath. &quot;Shyamali&quot; and &quot;Konark&quot; are mud houses. &quot;Shyamali&quot; was an experiment. The visual perspective was based on the Borobudur style. The entire outside wall was decorated with beautiful relief work by Kala Bhavana students under the guidance of Nandalal Bose. The Santals on either side of the main door and on the eastern corner were by Ramkinkar Baij. Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi stayed in the house as guests. &quot;Udayan&quot; is the most imposing house in the Uttarayan complex. It is meant for important guests visiting Santiniketan. Each suite in &quot;Udayan&quot; is on a different level which gives this house its individuality. In 2013, Visva Bharati opened a museum &quot;Guha Ghar&quot;, in the Uttarayan complex, in memory of Rathindranath Tagore.
The Ashram Complex is the oldest area of Santiniketan, where Debendranath built the &quot;Santiniketan Griha&quot; and the beautiful stained glass prayer hall, in the second half of the 19th century. Patha Bhavana came up after Rabindranath started residing in Santiniketan. It has beautiful frescoes by Nandalal Bose. &quot;Natun Bari&quot; was built in 1902 for residential purposes. &quot;Kalo Bari&quot; is a unique structure of mud and coal tar and profusely decorated. There are numerous other houses: &quot;Dehali&quot;, &quot;Santoshalaya&quot;, &quot;Singha Sadan&quot;, &quot;Dwijaviram&quot;, &quot;Dinantika&quot;, &quot;Taladwaj&quot;, &quot;Chaitya&quot;, &quot;Ghantatala&quot;, &quot;Panthasala&quot;, &quot;Ratan Kuthi&quot;, &quot;Malancha&quot; and others – each with an interesting story that makes it historically relevant.

Visva Bharati was established as a centre for culture with the objective of exploring the arts, language, humanities, music etc. Specialised institutes came up in different fields: Cheena Bhavana, Hindi Bhavana, Kala Bhavana, Sangit Bhavana, Bhasa Bhavana, Nippon Bhavana, Bangladesh Bhavana and others. Many of these institutes with myriad structures have been decorated by illustrious artists.

&quot;The landscape of Shantiniketan is dotted with sculptures by Ramkinkar Baij (1906–1980), larger-than-life figures of Santals who were in reality part of the landscape. A Santal family, complete with dog, a group of workers running along at the call of the mill, their clothes flying in the air, a thresher, all situated along the main road. When Ramkinkar created Sujata, an elongated figure of one of the disciples of Buddha, he placed it just a little distance from the seated Buddha. Nandalal planted Eucalyptus saplings in the area, knowing that one day these tall trees would be a perfect setting to Ramkinkar&#x27;s Sujata. It was Nandalal Bose, who created an environment where art would be a part of life and the children of Santiniketan have grown absorbing these beautiful monuments as they have the oxygen in the air.&quot;

==The Tagore family at Shantiniketan==
Shantiniketan was founded and developed by members of the Tagore family. It was founded by Debendranath Tagore. Rabindranath Tagore wrote many of his literary classics at Santiniketan. His son, Rathindranath Tagore was one of the first five students at the &quot;Brahmacharya asrama&quot; at Santiniketan. After the death of his father in 1941, Rathindranath took over the burden of all responsibilities at Santiniketan. When Visva Bharati was made a central university in 1951, Rathindranath was appointed its first vice-chancellor.

Pratima Devi, Rathindranath&#x27;s wife, had active links with Visva Bharati from a very young age. She lived in Santinketan till her death in 1969.

Mira Devi, Rabindranath&#x27;s youngest daughter, after her failed marriage, lived in &quot;Malancha&quot; built for her in the Ashrama complex in 1926. She died at Santiniketan in 1969. Krishna Kripalani, husband of Nandita (Buri), daughter of Mira Devi, taught at Santiniketan for nearly 15 years, beginning 1933. Krishna Kripalani&#x27;s biography of Tagore was amongst the best ever written.

Dwijendranath Tagore, Rabindranath&#x27;s eldest brother, spent the last twenty years of his life at Santiniketan. He lived in &quot;Dwaijaviram&quot; in the Ashrama complex.

Dinendranath Tagore, Dwijendranath&#x27;s grandson, was principal of Sangit Bhavana in its earliest years. &quot;Dinantika&quot;, built in 1939, housed the &quot;Cha chakra&quot;, where staff members of Visva Bharati met over a cup of tea for meetings and relaxation.

Indira Devi Chaudhurani, daughter of Satyendranath Tagore, started living in Santiniketan in 1941 and took charge of Sangit Bhavana. She was acting vice-chancellor for a short period.

Supriyo Tagore, great-grandson of Satyendranath, was a student of Patha Bhavana and Visva Bharati University before going abroad to complete his education. He retired as the longest serving principal of Patha Bhavana. He now runs Sisu Tirtha, an institution for orphans mainly from the economically disadvantaged tribals, near Santiniketan. His son, Sudripta, with wide-ranging experience in the field of education, is also engaged in setting up a school, at Ruppur near Santiniketan, embodying the ideas of Rabindranath.

In Birbhum district, the fairs (&quot;mela&quot; in Bengali) are spread right across the district and are thought of as an extension of the concept of markets, a place of not only trade and business but also a meeting place of people and an arena for cultural exchange. The largest and most notable fair is the &quot;Poush Mela&quot; held at Santiniketan for three days from 7 Poush. Devendranath Tagore with twenty followers accepted the Brahmo creed from Ram Chandra Vidyabagish on 21 December 1843 (7 Poush 1250 according to the Bengali calendar). This was the basis of &quot;Poush Utsav&quot; (the Festival of Poush) at Santiniketan.

<doc id="727729" wikidata="Q1899909" url="?curid=727729" title="Mark Aitchison Young">
<text>Sir Mark Aitchison Young (; 30 June 1886 – 12 May 1974) was a British colonial administrator, who is best remembered for his service as the Governor of Hong Kong at the time of the Japanese invasion of the territory in 1941.

Born in British India, the son and grandson of senior members of the Indian Civil Service, Young followed in the steps of his two elder brothers and became a colonial administrator, serving in Ceylon, Sierra Leone, Palestine, before becoming Governor of Barbados and of Tanganyika. Young assumed the governorship of Hong Kong in 1941, three months before the outbreak of the Pacific War. During the Battle of Hong Kong, Young refused to capitulate on numerous occasions, before surrendering on Christmas Day, 1941 in order to avoid further bloodshed. Young then became a Japanese prisoner-of-war until 1945.

After a period of recovery, Young returned to Hong Kong in 1946 as its governor, Young introduced limited democratic reforms in Hong Kong, which were undone by his successor, Sir Alexander Grantham. Retiring to England, Young died in Winchester in 1974.

==Early life and education==
Young was the third son of colonial administrator Sir William Mackworth Young, sometime Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, and his second wife, Frances Mary, daughter of Sir Robert Eyles Egerton, also Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab. Sir Robert Egerton was nephew of Sir John Grey Egerton, 8th Baronet and the Reverend Sir Philip Grey Egerton, 9th Baronet.

Young was educated at Eton College and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he took first-class honours in Classics.

== Colonial career ==
He entered the Eastern Cadet Service and went to Ceylon in 1909. He served in the British Army with the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own) during World War I from 1915.

Young served as principal assistant colonial secretary of Ceylon (from 1923 to 1925 under Sir Cecil Clementi and Murchison Fletcher from 1925 to 1928), then as colonial secretary of Sierra Leone from 1928 to 1930. From 1930 to 1933, he served as chief secretary to the Government of the British Mandate of Palestine.

From 5 August 1933 to March 1938, he served as governor and commander-in-chief of Barbados. From November 1937 to February 1938, he served in the Government of Trinidad and Tobago.

From 1938 to 1941, Young served as Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Tanganyika. With the war in Europe looming, Young restored confidence within the colony, which was apprehensive that it would be returned to Germany as part of peace negotiations. He also took the step of appointing Indian representatives to the territory&#x27;s institutions. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Young swiftly disarmed and interned the colony&#x27;s large German population.

==Hong Kong governor, prisoner of war==
On 10 September 1941 Young was appointed Governor of Hong Kong. Japanese forces already occupied the Chinese mainland adjoining Hong Kong as part of their ongoing war with China, and early in Young&#x27;s term Hong Kong came under the threat of Japanese invasion.

At 08:00, 8 December 1941, several hours after Pearl Harbor was attacked, Hong Kong came under fire by Imperial Japanese Forces. The battle lasted for 17 days, and ended when Young surrendered the colony to the Japanese General Takashi Sakai on 25 December, known as the &#x27;Black Christmas&#x27; by Hong Kong people, who were then subject to Japanese rule for the next 3 years and 8 months. Young rebuffed several attempts by General Maltby and others in the military to ask for terms and discuss surrender as early as the 18th. This was in part based on clear instruction by Churchill directly to Young, advising him that &quot;Every Part of (Hong Kong) Island must be fought over and the enemy resisted with the utmost stubbornness. Every day that you are able to maintain your resistance you help the Allied cause all over the world.&quot;

Young was a prisoner of war in Japanese hands from December 1941 to August 1945. He was initially held in the Peninsula Hotel and subsequently incarcerated in a prisoner of war camp in Stanley, on the southern shores of Hong Kong Island. Shortly thereafter, he was later transferred, with other high-ranking Allied captives, including General Maltby, to a series of POW camps in Shanghai, Taiwan, and Japan, then to a camp near the Chinese-Mongolian border, and finally to a location near Mukden (modern Shenyang) Manchuria, until his liberation at war&#x27;s end. Despite being the colony&#x27;s highest-ranking official, Young was mistreated by his captors. Japan was defeated and surrendered in September 1945 and the British regained control of the colony.

==Post-Japanese occupation governorship==
Young resumed his duties as Governor of Hong Kong on 1 May 1946, after having spent some time recuperating in England. After returning, he proposed political reforms that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to directly choose a 30-member representative Legislative Council. He envisaged that the new Council would handle everyday affairs and that its decisions would be immune to the Governor&#x27;s veto. Young, echoing the plan of Sir Geoffry Northcote, called for the promotion of local Chinese civil servants to the senior posts. These initiatives were eventually abandoned under the term of Governor Sir Alexander Grantham, an ardent conservative. Young retired from the governorship in 1947.

==Personal life==
Young and his wife, Josephine Mary, had four children, including Sir Brian Young.

Young, Sir William Robinson and Christopher Patten are the only governors not to have been honoured in Hong Kong after completing their post. This is probably because most of Young&#x27;s time in Hong Kong was spent as prisoner of war, with only a brief period from 1946 to 1947 as governor.

His brothers Gerard Mackworth Young (also director of the British School at Athens) and Sir Hubert Winthrop Young, KCMG, were also colonial administrators.

<text>The City of Hamilton, in Pembroke Parish, is the territorial capital of the British Overseas Territory of Bermuda. It is the territory&#x27;s financial centre and a port and tourist destination. Its population of 854 (2016) is one of the smallest of any capital city.

==History==
The history of Hamilton as a British city began in 1790 when the government of Bermuda set aside for its future seat, officially incorporated in 1793 by an Act of Parliament, and named for Governor Henry Hamilton. The colony&#x27;s capital relocated to Hamilton from St George&#x27;s in 1815. The city has been at the political and military heart of Bermuda ever since. Government buildings include the parliament building, the Government House to the north, the former Admiralty House of the Royal Navy to the west (both in Pembroke), and the British Army garrison headquarters at Prospect Camp to its east. The Town of Hamilton became a city in 1897, ahead of the consecration in 1911 of the Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity (Church of England), which was under construction at the time. A Catholic cathedral, St. Theresa&#x27;s, was later constructed.

In 1940, the Royal Navy commissioned a former US Navy destroyer as HMS &quot;Hamilton&quot;. The 2 November 1940, issue of &quot;The Royal Gazette&quot;, a newspaper published in the City of Hamilton, reported this in an article titled &quot;&quot;NEW&quot; DESTROYER HAS NAME OF HAMILTON: Mayor Here Receives Letter From Her Commander&quot;, and began:

The article went on to mention that the Mayor was to open a fund to supply the crew of the ship with newspapers and included the text of Shadwell&#x27;s letter.

In February 17th, 1975, Queen Elizabeth II made an visit on city hall along with Prince Philip, in the course of world tour on the construction of the structure.

Today, the city overlooking Hamilton Harbour is primarily a business district, with few structures other than office buildings and shops. The City of Hamilton has long maintained a building height and view limit, which states that no buildings may obscure the cathedral. In the 21st century, buildings have been planned and some are under construction that are as high as ten storeys in the area. Bermuda&#x27;s local newspaper, &quot;The Royal Gazette,&quot; reports, &quot;If you don&#x27;t recognise the city, from 15 years ago, we don&#x27;t blame you as it has changed so much&quot;.

==Geography==
Hamilton is located on the north side of Hamilton Harbour, and is Bermuda&#x27;s main port. Although there is a parish of the same name, the city of Hamilton is in the parish of Pembroke. The city is named after Sir Henry Hamilton, governor of the territory from 1786 to 1793. Hamilton Parish antedates the city.

The administrative capital of Bermuda, Hamilton, has a limited permanent population around 854 (2016); however in 2010, 13,340 (40% of Bermuda&#x27;s working population) worked here on a daily basis. The only incorporated city in Bermuda, Hamilton is smaller than the historic town of St. George&#x27;s. A more representative measure of Bermuda&#x27;s local residential populations tends to be by parish.

==Economy==
As the offshore domicile of many foreign companies, Bermuda has a highly developed international business economy; it is an exporter of financial services, primarily insurance, reinsurance, investment funds, and special-purpose vehicles. Finance and international business constitute the largest sector of Bermuda&#x27;s economy, and virtually all of this business takes place within the borders of Hamilton.

Numerous leading international insurance companies are based in Hamilton, as it is a global reinsurance centre. Around 400 internationally owned and operated businesses are physically based in Bermuda, and many are represented by the Association of Bermuda International Companies. In total, over 1,500 exempted or international companies are registered with the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda.

The city is the registered headquarters of the spirits manufacturer Bacardi, outsourcing company Genpact, and reinsurance company Tokio Millennium Re Ltd. Hamilton is known as the headquarters of international shipping companies, such as Frontline Ltd.
Its low corporate tax rate makes it attractive to US companies.

In addition, the corporate headquarters of the Bermuda grocery store chain The MarketPlace is located within the chain&#x27;s Hamilton MarketPlace location, the largest grocery store in Bermuda.

== Cost of living ==
According to Numbeo, Hamilton, Bermuda holds the record for the highest cost of living index in the world with the cost of living rate in Hamilton being at 138.01 as of 2023.
==Coat of arms and flag==
The coat of arms of the city of Hamilton incorporate a shield featuring a golden sailing ship, representing the &quot;Resolution&quot;, surrounded by three cinquefoils, two above the ship and one below, also in gold, all on a plain blue background. This shield is supported by a mermaid and heraldic sea horse (i.e., demi-horse, demi-fish), and is placed on a mount in front of which is a scroll containing the motto &quot;Sparsa Collegit&quot;. The shield is topped by a crest featuring a closed helm topped with a torque above which an heraldic seahorse is emerging from the sea holding a flower. The city&#x27;s full motto is &quot;Hamilton sparsa collegit&quot;, (&quot;Hamilton has assembled the scattered&quot;).

The city&#x27;s flag is a banner of arms, featuring the same details as on the shield of the city&#x27;s coat of arms, but with the flowers in white rather than gold.

==Parks==
The city of Hamilton has many parks for its size. One of the best known parks in the city is Victoria Park. This park occupies a whole block and was named after Queen Victoria. Other parks in the city are Par La Ville Park, Barr&#x27;s Park, Albuoy&#x27;s Point Park, and the hidden Cedar Park.


==Climate==
Although located some distance north of the geographic tropics, Hamilton has a warm trade-wind tropical rainforest climate (&quot;Af&quot;) bordering on humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;). It is warm enough for coconut palms and other tropical palms to grow, although they may not fruit properly due to the lack of heat or sunshine during the winter months because of latitude. Hamilton has uncharacteristically warm temperatures for its latitude 32nd parallel north because of the moderating influence of the North Atlantic and nearby Gulf Stream. Hamilton features warm and humid summers and semi-warm &quot;winters&quot;. As temperatures are moderated by the Atlantic Ocean, it rarely gets very hot or cold in the city. Precipitation is plentiful throughout the year and Hamilton does not have a dry season month, a month where on average less than of precipitation falls. Summer precipitation is usually from showers, thunderstorms, and tropical disturbances or even tropical cyclones. Meanwhile, winter precipitation is typically derived from westerly moving extra-tropical cyclones and their associated fronts. Erratic, extended dry spells occasionally develop because of variations in the semi-permanent sub-tropical ridge locally known as the Bermuda-Azores High.

==Education==

* Dellwood Middle School (public middle school)

== Sports ==
Hamilton has a host of beaches, which provide many opportunities for water sports, including surfing, wind surfing, water skiing, jet skiing, sailing and diving.

The highlight of the sports calendar is the Bermuda Gold Cup (or Argo Group Gold Cup as it is known), a sailing event which is a key stage of the World Match Racing Tour, one of only three sailing championships to be sanctioned by the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) with &#x27;Special Event&#x27; status. The Argo Cup brings the world&#x27;s best match-racing sailors (including world champions and Olympic sailors) to Bermuda for five days of one-on-one &#x27;match racing&#x27;. Points accrued during the event contribute to the World Match Racing Tour and ultimately a chance to race in the final event, the Monsoon Cup in Malaysia. The winner of that is crowned ISAF World Match Racing Champion. Unlike many water-based sports, which occur too far out to view from shore, &#x27;match racing&#x27; is a great spectator sport. The race takes place only 15m from the shore, and spectators can see the heart of the action.

The history of the modern Bermuda Gold Cup event dates back to the very beginning of the match racing style of sailing. The first &#x27;match race&#x27; in a one-design racing yacht, i.e. technically identical boats, was the King Edward VII Gold Cup in Bermuda (now known as the Argo Gold Cup) that was first sailed in 1937. The Argo Gold Cup is still a key event in the World Match Racing Tour calendar.

The King Edward VII Cup itself was originally given at the Tri-Centenary Regatta at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1907, by King Edward VII in commemoration of the 300th Anniversary of the first permanent settlement in America. C. Sherman Hoyt won that regatta, and was the first sailor to accept the historic trophy.

Hoyt held the Gold Cup for three decades before donating it to the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club and proposing an annual one-on-one match-race series in 6-Meter yachts. In his letter he expressed the propriety of &quot;my returning a British Royal trophy to the custody of your club, with its long record of clean sportsmanship and keenly contested races between your Bermuda yachts and ours of Long Island Sound, and elsewhere...&quot; The first winner of the Cup in its new format was Briggs Cunningham in 1937. He was also the first skipper to win the America&#x27;s Cup in a 12-Meter racing yacht.

<text>The All Nations Party was a minor political party in British Columbia, Canada. Its primary base of support was the First Nations aboriginal peoples of Canada.

In the 2001 provincial election, the All Nations Party nominated six First Nations candidates for office. The party received 3,380 votes, 3.94% of the total votes in the ridings in which the candidates ran. The party&#x27;s greatest electoral success came in North Coast riding, where 40% of the population is aboriginal. In this region, the All Nations Party received 4.84% of the vote, the second-largest share of votes cast. In Yale-Lillooet, party leader Don Moses won 1,126 votes for 6.87% of the total, placing fourth out of six candidates in the riding.

In 2004, the All Nations Party became involved in efforts to create a new centrist coalition. On January 16, 2005, the party was absorbed into the Democratic Reform British Columbia party.

<text>John Russell Young (November 20, 1840 – January 17, 1899) was an American journalist, author, diplomat, and the seventh Librarian of the United States Congress from 1897 to 1899. He was invited by Ulysses S. Grant to accompany him on a world tour for purposes of recording the two-year journey, which he published in a two-volume work.

==Biography==
Young was born in County Tyrone, Ireland, but as a young child his family emigrated to Philadelphia. He entered the newspaper business full time as a proofreader at age 15. As a reporter for the &quot;Philadelphia Press&quot;, he distinguished himself with his coverage of the First Battle of Bull Run. By 1862 he was managing editor of the &quot;Press&quot; and another newspaper. Young was also the youngest founding member of the Union League of Philadelphia.
In 1865, he moved to New York, where he became a close friend of Henry George and helped to distribute &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;. He began writing for Horace Greeley&#x27;s &quot;New York Tribune&quot; and became managing editor of that paper. He also began working for the government, undertaking missions to Europe for the US Department of State and the US Department of the Treasury. In 1872, he joined the &quot;New York Herald&quot; and reported for them from Europe.

Young was invited to accompany President Ulysses S. Grant on Grant&#x27;s famous 1877-1879 world tour, chronicled in Young&#x27;s book &quot;Around the World with General Grant&quot;. Young impressed Grant, especially in China where Young struck up a friendship with Li Hongzhang. Grant persuaded President Chester A. Arthur to appoint Young minister to China in 1882. In this position he distinguished himself by mediating and settling disputes between the US and China and France and China. Unlike many other diplomats, he opposed the policy of removing Korea from Chinese suzerainty. 

In 1885, Young resumed working for the &quot;Herald&quot; in Europe. In 1890, he returned to Philadelphia. In 1892, Young became a director of the Union League of Philadelphia. He was elected president of the League in 1893 and 1894. Young organized a thirtieth-year reunion in April 1893 of senior officers from both sides of the Battle of Gettysburg. Among those who participated were Confederate generals E. P. Alexander and James Longstreet, Union generals D. McMurtrie Gregg and Daniel Sickles and Pennsylvania governor Robert E. Pattison.

In 1897, President William McKinley appointed him Librarian of Congress, the first librarian confirmed by Congress. During his tenure, the library began moving from its original home in the US Capitol Building to its own structure, an accomplishment largely the responsibility of his predecessor, Ainsworth Rand Spofford. Spofford served as Chief Assistant Librarian under Young. Young held the post of librarian until his death.

Young was not content with just being an administrator who allowed Spofford to concentrate on the library relocation effort. He introduced a popular reading area for blind library patrons. Young also sought to increase the library&#x27;s international holdings through his diplomatic connections. After consulting with Secretary of State William R. Day, he sent a letter to U.S. embassies and consulates around the world in February 1898 requesting documents and manuscripts.

He died in Washington, D.C. on January 17, 1899, and is interred at Mount Moriah Cemetery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==Family==
Young was the son of George Young and his wife Elizabeth &quot;Eliza&quot; (Rankin) Young. His family was not Irish Catholic, but rather Scottish Presbyterian. They emigrated from Ireland to the United States with young John in 1841 and settled in Downingtown, Pennsylvania, where his sister Mary Anne was born in 1843. The following year, they moved to Philadelphia where his brother, future Congressman James Rankin Young, was born a few years later. Another sister, Elizabeth, was born in 1850.

Young began his education in Philadelphia, attending the Harrison Grammar School. After his mother Eliza died in 1851, he was sent to live with his father&#x27;s older brother James R. Young who had emigrated from Ireland to New Orleans in 1837. There Young attended the high school until he returned to Philadelphia at the age of fifteen. When not in class, he found his first employment as a part-time printer&#x27;s boy at the Creole newspaper.

On October 18, 1864, Young married Rose Fitzpatrick in Washington, D.C. They had three children, all of whom died in childhood. Frequently ill, his wife died in New York City on January 4, 1881. On April 25, 1882, Young remarried with Julia Coleman, a niece of former Connecticut governor Marshall Jewell, in Hartford, Connecticut. She accompanied him to China, but left in April 1883 to await the birth of their first child in Paris. Their son, Russell Jewell Young, was born on August 1, 1883, but then his wife died in October. The infant was sent to Hartford to be cared for by her family until after Young returned home from China. Russell Young later attended Yale College and became a journalist like his father, working for the &quot;Hartford Daily Courant&quot;. He died on October 29, 1916 at the age of thirty-three.

On November 18, 1890, Young married Mrs. May (Dow) Davids, a widow with children from her first marriage, at the Astor House in New York City. Their son, born on December 14, 1891, was Brig. Gen. Gordon Russell Young, a 1913 United States Military Academy graduate who was Engineer Commissioner of the District of Columbia from 1945 to 1951 and a recipient of the Distinguished Service Medal and the Legion of Merit. After her husband&#x27;s death in 1899, May Young served as editor in the publication of his memoirs &quot;Men and Memories: Personal Reminiscences&quot; in 1901. She died on July 6, 1924.

May Young had two sons and five older stepchildren from her first marriage to George W. Davids, whose father was Thaddeus Davids. John Russell Young adopted the two younger boys, who lived with them in Philadelphia and then Washington. Howard Gilman Young joined Teddy Roosevelt&#x27;s Rough Riders in May 1898, serving as a private in Company I. After the Spanish–American War, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the regular army, serving with the 6th Infantry in the Philippines. Berkeley Reynolds Young worked at the Library of Congress and pursued a law degree at George Washington University. A few years after their stepfather&#x27;s death, both young men had their surname legally changed back to Davids. After serving as an officer in the Coast Artillery Corps during World War I, Berkeley Davids returned to his law career while his older brother Howard Davids remained in the army until September 1934, retiring as a colonel.

On October 18, 1865, Young&#x27;s sister Mary Anne married John Blakely, a fellow Philadelphia journalist. They had five sons and a daughter. Three of their sons, George Blakely, John Russell Young Blakely, and Charles School Blakely, became flag officers in the U.S. military. Young himself was negatively affected by the death of his sister in February 1898.

<text>Franz Vranitzky (; born 4 October 1937) is an Austrian politician. A member of the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ), he was Chancellor of Austria from 1986 to 1997.

==Early life and career==
As the son of a foundryman, Vranitzky was born into humble circumstances in Vienna&#x27;s 17th district. He attended the Realgymnasium Geblergasse and studied economics, graduating in 1960. He financed his studies teaching Latin and English and as a construction worker.

As a young man, Vranitzky played basketball and was a member of Austria&#x27;s national team, which in 1960 unsuccessfully tried to qualify for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.

In 1962, Vranitzky joined the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ).

In 1962, Vranitzky married Christine Christen, with whom he fathered two children.

Vranitzky began his career in 1961 at Siemens-Schuckert, but within the year switched to Austria’s central bank Oesterreichische Nationalbank. In 1969, he received a doctorate in International business studies. The following year, Hannes Androsch, finance minister under Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, appointed him economic and financial advisor. Vranitzky served as deputy director of the Creditanstalt-Bankverein (1976–1981), briefly as its director general and as director general of the Länderbank (1981–1984).

In 1984, Vranitzky joined the SPÖ-Freedom Party (FPÖ) government coalition under Chancellor Fred Sinowatz as finance minister. He was criticized for receiving multiple compensations from his various functions in government-run businesses.

==Chancellor of Austria==
In the presidential elections of 1986, Chancellor Sinowatz vociferously opposed Kurt Waldheim, the candidate of the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP) opposition. The former UN Secretary General&#x27;s campaign for office caused international controversy due to allegations about his role as a German army officer in World War II. When Waldheim was elected on 8 June, Sinowatz resigned from the government, proposing Vranitzky as his successor.

Vranitzky entered his new office on 16 June 1986. At first he continued the government coalition with the Freedom Party. On 13 September 1986, however, radical FPÖ politician Jörg Haider was elected chairman of his party, ousting the moderate vice chancellor Norbert Steger. Vranitzky ended cooperation with his coalition partner and had parliament dissolved.

In the subsequent elections on 23 November 1986, the SPÖ remained the strongest party. In January 1987, Vranitzky formed a government, based on a &quot;grand coalition&quot; with the second-largest party, the Christian democrat ÖVP, with Alois Mock serving as vice-chancellor and foreign minister. In 1988, Vranitzky also succeeded Fred Sinowatz as chairman of his party.

Until 1992, Austria&#x27;s foreign policy had to deal with the repercussions of the Waldheim controversy, as the Austrian president was shunned in some diplomatic circles. The United States regarded Waldheim as a persona non grata, thereby barring him from entering the country in 1987, while Israel had recalled its ambassador after Waldheim&#x27;s election. Vranitzky managed to normalise Austria&#x27;s relations with both countries and frequently stepped in to perform diplomatic duties commonly assigned to the president.

On 8 July 1991, in a speech in parliament, Vranitzky acknowledged a share in the responsibility for the pain brought, not by Austria as a state, but by citizens of this country, upon other people and peoples&quot;, thereby departing from the hitherto official portrayal of Austria as &quot;Hitler&#x27;s first victim.&quot;

After the end of the Cold War, Vranitzky focused on furthering relations with the nations of Eastern Europe and membership in the European Union, of which Vranitzky and his foreign minister, Alois Mock, were strong advocates. After a referendum on 12 June 1994 resulted in 66% in favour of EU membership, Austria joined the European Union in January 1995. Austria&#x27;s military neutrality, which had been espoused during the Cold War, was reaffirmed in the process.

In party politics, Vranitzky kept his distance from Jörg Haider&#x27;s Freedom Party – a stance the latter decried as a &quot;policy of exclusion.&quot; In the election of 1990, Vranitzky&#x27;s coalition government was confirmed when the Social Democrat vote remained stable while the ÖVP lost 17 seats, mainly to the FPÖ. The 1994 election saw heavy losses by both coalition parties, which nonetheless remained the two largest parties, while FPÖ and others made further gains. Vranitzky renewed the coalition with the ÖVP, which after May 1995 was led by foreign minister Wolfgang Schüssel. Later in the year, the grand coalition broke apart over budget policy, leading to the elections of December 1995, which however only saw slight changes in favor of SPÖ and ÖVP. Vranitzky and Schüssel resumed their coalition in March 1996.

In January 1997, Vranitzky resigned as chancellor and as party chairman. He was succeeded in both positions by his minister of finance, Viktor Klima.

==Later activities==
After leaving office, Vranitzky served as Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe representative for Albania from March to October 1997, before returning into the banking sector, as political consultant to the WestLB bank. In December, he was elected to the board of governors of automotive supplier Magna. He later occupied the same position for the tourism company TUI and Magic Life hotels.

In June 2005, he donated one of his kidneys to his wife Christine, who suffered from chronic kidney failure.

He actively supported his party&#x27;s frontrunner Alfred Gusenbauer in the 2006 elections. During the campaign it was revealed, that in 1999, Vranitzky had received a million Austrian schillings as a consultant to the BAWAG bank, which was then under public scrutiny. It was alleged that the payment was made without any service in return and that it constituted an &quot;indirect party funding&quot;. Vranitzky denounced the allegations.

Vranitzky chairs the quarterly &quot;Vranitzky colloquia&quot;, organised by the study group WiWiPol, which discusses economic topics and their impact on Austria and Europe. He is a former member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.

<text>Frank Edward Young (September 1, 1931 – November 24, 2019) was an American physician who served as Commissioner of Food and Drugs from 1984 to 1989 and later as a deputy assistant secretary in the United States Department of Health and Human Services. In 2013 he joined Braeburn Pharmaceuticals as executive vice president, clinical and regulatory affairs. In 2018, he became the executive vice president of clinical and regulatory affairs at TissueTech Inc.

==Education==
Young received an M.D. degree (cum laude) from the State University of New York Upstate Medical Center in Syracuse in 1956 and a Ph.D. in microbiology from Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1962.

==Medical career==
Young completed his residency in pathology at the University Hospitals, Western Reserve University. He went on to become chairman of the Department of Microbiology and professor of microbiology, pathology and radiation biology and biophysics at the University of Rochester. Before his appointment as Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, he was dean of the School of Medicine and Dentistry and vice president for health affairs at the University of Rochester.

==Tenure as FDA Commissioner==
Young was sworn in as Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration by Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler on August 2, 1984. During his tenure, Young presided over several major agency events, including the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (1984), passage of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (1987), approval of the first drug to combat AIDS, zidovudine (AZT) (1987), development of the treatment use of Investigational New Drugs (IND) for the desperately ill, such as people with AIDS, cancer and heart disease (1988); managing the generic drug crisis (1989), during which three officials of the Food and Drug Administration pleaded guilty to receiving bribes, and two manufacturers of generic drugs admitted to providing false data, and the 1989 Chilean grape scare, where Chilean grapes were temporarily banned by the FDA because of a threat and the discovery of two cyanide-tainted grapes.

==After the FDA==
Young left the FDA in 1989 to become Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health, Science, and Environment under Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Wade Sullivan. Subsequently, Young served as director of both the Office of Emergency Preparedness and the National Disaster Medical System during the Clinton Administration, from 1993 until his retirement from federal service in 1996. 

In 2013, Young joined Braeburn Pharmaceuticals as executive vice president, clinical and regulatory affairs to contribute to the development of the new drug application (NDA) to FDA for evaluation of Braeburn’s Probuphine (buprenorphine) implant, which was approved on May 26, 2016. Probuphine is the first buprenorphine implant for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence.

Young has advised numerous pharmaceutical companies on regulatory issues and clinical development. He served as interim vice president for clinical and regulatory affairs of Bioventus Global and became an adjunct partner and partner at Essex Woodlands in 2002. He also co-founded the Cosmos Alliance and served as its chairman and chief executive officer.

He served as the executive vice president of clinical and regulatory affairs at TissueTech Inc, where he was tasked to lead the company in its transition from a HCT/P regulated company into a biologics company through the pursuit of multiple NDAs for ultimate BLA approval.

==Awards and achievements==
Young contributed to more than 200 scientific publications in the fields of biotechnology and pathology and developed some of the earliest cloning enzymes, vectors, and vehicles. He is a member of the National Academy of Medicine.

At the Department of Health and Human Services, Young received a Secretary’s Special Citation and the Inspector General’s Award for Outstanding Integrity. He also received the Surgeon General’s Exemplary Service Medal from the United States Public Health Service and the 2006 Distinguished Alumnus Award from SUNY Upstate Medical University. 

In 2015, Young was awarded the 2015 Distinguished Scientist Award by the American College of Toxicology for his outstanding contributions to toxicology and the improvement of public health.

==Personal life==
Young was the son of Frank E. and Erma F. Young. He served in the United States Navy in the Ready Reserve from 1956-1964 and retired in 1996 from the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service as a rear admiral after 12 years of Service. He was married to the former Leanne Hutchinson from 1956 until her death in 2008. They had five children. Young also served as a pastor in the Evangelical Presbyterian Church for approximately six years before retiring as pastor emeritus.

He died of lymphoma on November 24, 2019, in Wilmington, North Carolina at age 88.

<doc id="727767" wikidata="Q3617629" url="?curid=727767" title="Ann Eliza Young">
<text>Ann Eliza Young (September 13, 1844 – December 7, 1917) also known as Ann Eliza Webb Dee Young Denning was one of Brigham Young&#x27;s fifty-six wives and later a critic of polygamy. Her autobiography, &quot;Wife No. 19,&quot; was a recollection of her experiences in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). She grew up in a polygamous household that moved to Utah during the Mormon migration. Ann Eliza was married and divorced three times: first to James Dee, then Young, and finally Moses Denning. Her divorce from Young reached a national audience when Ann Eliza sued with allegations of neglect, cruel treatment, and desertion. She was born a member of the LDS Church but was excommunicated shortly after her public divorce from Young.

== Early life and first marriage ==
Ann Eliza Webb was born in Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1844, to Chauncey Griswold Webb and his wife, Eliza Jane Churchill. Chauncey G. Webb was a 32-year-old carriage-maker, and Eliza Jane a 29-year-old schoolteacher at the time of Ann Eliza&#x27;s birth. Ann Eliza was the youngest of five children, four of which survived to adulthood. Her three older brothers were Chauncey Gilbert, Edward Milo, and Lorenzo Dow. Ann Eliza was about a year old when her father took a second wife, Elizabeth Taft, in accordance with the contemporary polygamous practices of the LDS Church. In 1846, the Webb family moved to the Salt Lake Valley with the Mormon pioneers. As a teenager in Utah, Webb and other Latter-day Saint youth participated in local theatricals and dancing.

=== First marriage and divorce ===

Ann Eliza married James Dee monogamously on April 10, 1863, in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. They had two sons together, Edward Wesley and Leonard &quot;Louis&quot; Lorenzo, but the couple later divorced. According to her biographer, Irving Wallace, &quot;for the rest of her days Ann Eliza would always refer to James Dee as the man who &#x27;blighted&#x27; her life.&quot;

== Polygamous marriage to Brigham Young ==

On the advice of her family, Ann Eliza married Brigham Young, the second president of the LDS Church, when he was 67 years old and she was a 24-year-old divorcee. They were married on April 7, 1869. The ceremony was presided over by LDS Church leader Heber C. Kimball. At her request, Ann Eliza was set up in a separate home in Salt Lake City, on the condition that she visit the Lion House on occasion.

Although Ann Eliza later called herself Young&#x27;s &quot;wife number 19&quot;,&quot;&quot; others have referred to her as his &quot;27th wife&quot;. One researcher concluded that she was actually the 52nd woman to marry Young. The discrepancies may be due, in part, to difficulties in defining what constitutes a &quot;wife&quot; in early Mormon polygamous practices. A book published in the 1890s and endorsed by church leaders entitled &quot;Pictures and Biographies of Brigham Young and His Wives&quot; provides brief descriptions of 26 wives, including Ann Eliza.

=== Divorce from Young ===
In 1873, Brigham Young allowed Latter-day Saints to take on boarders who were not members of the faith. Methodist Reverend C. C. Stratton and his wife boarded with Ann Eliza. It is possible that the couple&#x27;s efforts may have aided in Ann Eliza&#x27;s decision to leave Young and the LDS Church. On Ann Eliza&#x27;s legal counsel was Judge Hagan who also believed that Stratton was primarily to blame for Ann Eliza&#x27;s separation from Young. In a statement, Stratton denied having any influence on Ann Eliza&#x27;s decision, claiming instead that he had encouraged her to stay in her situation with Young. He indicated, however, that Ann Eliza was &quot;a person of womanly instincts&quot; whose &quot;present position [was] exceedingly distasteful to her&quot;. Reverend Stratton was invited to be listed as Ann Eliza&#x27;s &quot;next friend&quot; in the divorce case. Judge Hagan believed that Stratton&#x27;s background as a Methodist minister would validate the indictments against Young and the LDS Church. Stratton refused, however, due to other high-profile legal circumstances, which had forced him to leave his previous ministry in Portland, Oregon. He did not want the additional publicity of Ann Eliza&#x27;s court case.

Ann Eliza filed for divorce from Young in January 1873, an act that attracted much attention. Her bill for divorce alleged neglect, cruel treatment, and desertion, and claimed that her husband had property worth $8 million and an income exceeding $40,000 a month. Young countered that he owned less than $600,000 in property and that his income was less than $6,000 per month.

=== Excommunication ===
Ann Eliza was excommunicated from the LDS Church on October 10, 1874. The divorce was granted in January 1875, and Young was ordered to pay a $500 per month allowance as well as $3,000 in court fees. When Young initially refused, he was found in contempt of court and sentenced to a day in jail with an additional $25 fine. The alimony award was later set aside on the grounds that the marriage was polygamous and therefore legally invalid. The polygamous nature of the marriage also exposed them to potential indictments for unlawful cohabitation.

After her excommunication, Ann Eliza converted to the Methodist Episcopal faith.

== Advocacy ==
Ann Eliza subsequently traveled the United States and spoke out against polygamy, Mormonism, and Brigham Young. She testified before the U.S. Congress on April 14, 1874. A couple months later, the Poland Act was signed into law, which reorganized the judicial system of the Utah Territory and facilitated the federal prosecution of LDS Church polygamists. In a biographical entry on Brigham Young in &quot;American National Biography&quot;, Leonard Arrington stated that Ann Eliza&#x27;s lectures against Young were &quot;influential in the federal antipolygamy legislation of 1882 and 1887&quot;.

=== &quot;Wife No. 19&quot; ===
In 1876, Ann Eliza published an autobiography titled &quot;Wife No. 19&quot;. In it, she wrote that she had &quot;a desire to impress upon the world what Mormonism really is; to show the pitiable condition of its women, held in a system of bondage that is more cruel than African slavery ever was, since it claims to hold body and soul alike&quot;. Her account of the &quot;horrors of polygamy and masonry&quot; is in the public domain. The autobiography was the basis for Irving Wallace&#x27;s 1961 biography &quot;The Twenty-Seventh Wife&quot; and for David Ebershoff&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;The 19th Wife&quot;.

== Third marriage ==
After her divorce from Brigham Young in 1875, Ann Eliza married 53-year-old Moses R. Denning of Manistee, Michigan, a non-Mormon and wealthy logger known to have only one arm. Two years prior to her marriage to Denning, who was married with children at the time, Ann Eliza stayed at his home. Ann Eliza scaled back her crusade against Mormonism and polygamy and stopped delivering lectures the week she married Denning.

=== Divorce from Denning ===
A 1907 article on the 30th anniversary of Brigham Young&#x27;s death updated the public on his then-surviving widows and stated that Ann Eliza was divorced for the third time and living in Lansing, Michigan. The 1900 U.S. census had reported her living in Breckenridge, Summit County, Colorado. Ann Eliza eventually returned to Utah to claim a $2,000 legacy from her first husband, James Dee.

== Later years ==
In 1908, she published a revised version of &quot;Wife No. 19&quot; entitled &quot;Life in Mormon Bondage,&quot; a revision that excluded any mention of her first marriage to Dee or her third marriage to Denning. By 1910, she had moved to Sparks, Nevada. She eventually became estranged from her family, including her children. One of her grandsons told Wallace that neither of her sons maintained contact with her after they reached early adulthood. In 1930, her older grandson told Wallace, &quot;I hope to hell I never see her again.&quot; She died at her home in Sparks of pneumonia, related to old age, and was buried on December 9, 1917, in Mountain View Cemetery, Reno, Nevada.

<text>23 Thalia () is a large main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by J. R. Hind on 15 December 1852, at the private observatory of W. Bishop, located in Hyde Park, London, England. Bishop named it after Thalia, the Muse of comedy and pastoral poetry in Greek mythology.

It is categorized as an S-type asteroid consisting of mainly of iron- and magnesium-silicates. This the second most common type of asteroid in the main belt. Based on analysis of the light curve, the object has a sidereal rotation period of . An ellipsoidal model of the light curve gives an a/b ratio of .

With a semimajor axis of 2.628, the asteroid is orbiting between the 3:1 and 5:2 Kirkwood gaps in the main belt. Its orbital eccentricity is larger than the median value of 0.07 for the main belt, and the inclination is larger than the median of below 4°. But most of the main-belt asteroids have an eccentricity of no more than 0.4 and an inclination of up to 30°, so the orbit of 23 Thalia is not unusual for a main-belt asteroid.

Thalia has been studied by radar.

<text>The Chagossians (also Îlois or Chagos Islanders) are an Afro-Asian ethnic group originating from freed African slaves as well as people of Asian (Indian and Malay) descent brought to the Chagos Islands, specifically Diego Garcia, Peros Banhos, and the Salomon island chain, in the late 18th century. Under international law, they are the indigenous people of the Chagos archipelago. Most Chagossians now live in Mauritius, Seychelles, and the United Kingdom after being forcibly removed by the British government in the late 1960s and early 1970s so that Diego Garcia, the island where most Chagossians lived, could serve as the location for a United States military base. Today, no Chagossians are allowed to live on the island of Diego Garcia or anywhere in the Chagos archipelago, despite many of the islands they used to inhabit being over away from Diego Garcia.

The Chagossians are a mix of African, Indian and Malay descent. The French brought some to the Chagos Islands as slaves from Mauritius in 1786. Others arrived as fishermen, farmers, and coconut plantation workers during the 19th century.

The Chagossians speak Chagossian Creole, a French-based creole language whose vocabulary also incorporates words originating in various African and Asian languages and is part of the Bourbonnais Creole family. Chagossian Creole is still spoken by some of their descendants in Mauritius and the Seychelles. Chagossian people living in the UK speak English. Some settled in the town of Crawley in West Sussex, and the Chagossian community there numbered approximately 3,000 in 2016, which increased to 3,500 in 2024. Manchester also has a Chagossian community, which has included artist Audrey Albert.

In 2016, the British government rejected the right of the Chagossians to return to the islands after a 45-year legal dispute. In 2019, the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion stating that the United Kingdom did not have sovereignty over the Chagos Islands and that the administration of the archipelago should be handed over &quot;as rapidly as possible&quot; to Mauritius. Since this, the United Nations General Assembly and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea have reached similar decisions.

In October 2024, the UK agreed to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and stated that Mauritius &quot;will now be free to implement a programme of resettlement on the islands of the Chagos Archipelago, other than Diego Garcia&quot;. The UK will also set up a trust fund for the scattered Chagossian diaspora, now numbering 10,000. In 2021, Mauritius amended its Criminal Code to outlaw &quot;Misrepresenting the sovereignty of Mauritius over any part of its territory&quot;, with the penalty of a fine or jail term up to 10 years. As the act is extraterritorial, it restricts the abilities of Chagossians both in Mauritius and around the world to voice their opinions on the status of the Chagos islands, including on the 2024 agreement.

== History ==

=== Early history and ethnogenesis ===
In 1793, when the first successful colony was founded on Diego Garcia, coconut plantations were established on many of the atolls and isolated islands of the archipelago. Initially the workers were enslaved Africans, but after 1840 they were freemen, many of whom were descended from those earlier enslaved. They formed an inter-island culture called &quot;Ilois&quot; (a French Creole word meaning Islanders).

=== Expulsion and dispossession ===

In 1965, as part of a deal to grant Mauritian independence, the UK separated the Chagos Archipelago, at the time a part of its Mauritius territory, from the colony and reorganized it as the British Indian Ocean Territory. The UK also falsely labelled the Chagossians, whose ancestral links to the territory go back to the late 18th century, as “transient workers” to avoid breaching International Law. The territory&#x27;s new constitution was set out in a statutory instrument imposed unilaterally with no referendum or consultation with the Chagossians and it envisaged no democratic institutions. On 16 April 1971, the United Kingdom issued a policy called BIOT Immigration Ordinance #1 which made it a criminal offence for those without military clearance to be on the islands without a permit.

Between 1967 and 1973, the Chagossians, then numbering over 1,000 people, were expelled by the British government, first to the island of Peros Banhos, away from their homeland, and then, in 1973, to Mauritius. A number of Chagossians who were evicted reported that they were threatened with being shot or bombed if they did not leave the island. One old man reported to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; journalist David Ottaway that an American official told him, &quot;If you don&#x27;t leave you won&#x27;t be fed any longer.&quot; BIOT commissioner Bruce Greatbatch later ordered all dogs on the island to be killed. Meanwhile, food stores on the island were allowed to deplete in order to pressure the remaining inhabitants to leave. The Chagossians owned no real property on the islands and lived in housing provided for farm workers by the absentee landowners of the plantations. The forced expulsion of the Chagossians after the acquisition of the plantations from their absentee landlords by the British Government was for the purpose of establishing a United States air and naval base on Diego Garcia, with a population of between 3,000 and 5,000 U.S. soldiers and support staff, as well as a few troops from the United Kingdom. Their exile is referred to as the &quot;dérasiné&quot; in the Chagossian language.

In early April 2006, in an excursion organised and financed by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, a group of around a hundred Chagossians were permitted to visit the British Indian Ocean Territory for the first time in over thirty years.

===Court battles===
In April 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected a lawsuit by Louis Olivier Bancoult and other Chagossians, finding that their claims were a non-justiciable political question, i.e. a question that U.S. courts cannot handle because it is properly the business of the Congress to address it legislatively.

On 11 May 2006, the Chagossians won their case in the High Court of Justice in England, which found that they were entitled to return to the Chagos Archipelago. It remained to be seen how this judgment might be implemented in practice. However, in June 2006 the British government filed an appeal in the Court of Appeal against the High Court&#x27;s decision. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office put forward an argument based on the treatment of the Japanese Canadians following the attacks on Pearl Harbor.

After the Court of Appeal had upheld the decision of the High Court, the British government appealed successfully to the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords. On 22 October 2008, the Law Lords reached a &quot;decision&quot; on the appeal made by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, David Miliband. They found in favour of the Government in a 3–2 verdict, ending the legal process in the UK and dashing the islanders&#x27; hopes of return. The judges who voted to allow the government&#x27;s appeal were Lord Hoffmann, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, and Lord Carswell; those dissenting were Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Mance.

In 2016, the British government denied the right of the Chagossians to return to the islands after a 45-year legal dispute.

In 2019, the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion stating that the United Kingdom did not have sovereignty over the Chagos Islands and that the administration of the archipelago should be handed over &quot;as rapidly as possible&quot; to Mauritius. The United Nations General Assembly then voted to give Britain a six-month deadline to begin the process of handing-over the islands.

=== Marine nature reserve and government communications leak ===

In April 2010, the British Government—specifically, the British diplomat Colin Roberts, acting on the instructions of David Miliband—established a marine nature reserve around the Chagos Islands known as the Chagos Marine Protected Area. The designation proved controversial as the decision was announced during a period when the UK Parliament was in recess.

On 1 December 2010, a leaked US Embassy London diplomatic cable dating back to 2009 exposed British and US calculations in creating the marine nature reserve. The cable relays exchanges between US Political Counselor Richard Mills and British Director of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Colin Roberts, in which Roberts &quot;asserted that establishing a marine park would, in effect, to resettlement claims of the archipelago&#x27;s former residents&quot;. Richard Mills concludes:

However, the cable also mentions that &quot;there are proposals (for a marine park) that could provide the Chagossians warden jobs&quot;. As of 2018, no such jobs exist. The cable (reference ID &quot;09LONDON1156&quot;) was classified as confidential and &quot;no foreigners&quot;, and leaked as part of the Cablegate cache.

Armed with the WikiLeaks revelations, the Chagossians launched an appeal, seeking a judgement that the reserve was unlawfully aimed at preventing them from returning home. Although United States Army soldier Chelsea Manning had been arrested nearly three years previously for the leaks, the UK government felt unable to confirm to the court that the leaked documents were genuine. It was made clear to the court that the government&#x27;s inability to confirm was for two reasons: firstly, to protect itself from the charge that it created the reserve to prevent the islanders from ever returning home and, secondly, out of a purported fear that the US government might get angry if the cables were acknowledged as genuine. Despite the contents of his cable being known—&quot;a marine park would, in effect, put paid to resettlement claims of the archipelago&#x27;s former residents&quot;—Roberts denied, when questioned in court, that there was an &quot;ulterior motive&quot; behind the reserve&#x27;s establishment. Lord Justice Richards and Mr. Justice Mitting then refused to accept the documents as evidence, declaring that to do so would breach diplomatic privilege. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described their decision as having &quot;far-reaching consequences&quot; and &quot;a severe setback for the use of material obtained from leaks or whistleblowers&quot;. In June 2013, the pair of judges turned down the appeal brought by the Chagossians, ruling that the reserve was compatible with EU law.

==== Pollution ====
It emerged in 2014 that—for three decades, in violation of environmental rules—the American navy had dumped hundreds of tonnes of sewage and waste water into a protected lagoon on Diego Garcia. In response to the revelations, the chair of the Chagos Refugees Group UK Branch, Sabrina Jean, noted:

=== Discourse about the Chagossians ===
The WikiLeaks cables revealed diplomatic cables between the US and UK about the Chagossians. A cable written by D.A. Greenhill on 24 August 1966 to a US State Department official refers to the Chagossians as &quot;some few Tarzans or Man Fridays&quot;.

Similar language appears in a 2009 US State Department cable (09LONDON1156), which offered a description of the UK government&#x27;s views about the effect of the Marine Protection Act:
=== 2012 petition ===
On 5 March 2012, a petition was launched on We the People section of the whitehouse.gov website in order to ask the White House in the United States to consider the Chagos case.

The petition read as follows:

On 4 April 2012, the sufficient number of 25,000 signatures was met to require a response from the Office of the President under its policy. An undated response was posted on the White House petition web site by the United States Department of State, in the name of Michael Posner (Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor), Philip H. Gordon (Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs) and Andrew J. Shapiro (Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs). The response read as follows:

== Indigenous status ==
The legal definition of the term &quot;indigenous&quot; varies widely by legal system, with classification as an indigenous being based on a variety of factors. The Chagossians are officially recognized as an Indigenous people by many entities including but not limited to the United Nations, Cultural Survival, Human Rights Watch, and Minority Rights Group International. In a memo to the American government, Paul Gore-Booth promised the American government that there would be no indigenous people in the islands except for seagulls – not that the islands had no indigenous people. In a 1970 memo, UK Foreign Office lawyer Anthony Aust emphasised the government&#x27;s intention to &quot;maintain the fiction that the inhabitants of Chagos are not a permanent or semi-permanent population&quot; and dedicated an entire paragraph to outlining plans for &quot;maintaining the fiction&quot;. In 1968 Foreign Secretary Michael Stewart wrote in a secret document that &quot;by any stretch of the English language, there was an indigenous population and the Foreign Office knew it.&quot; They are designated as a national minority by the government of Mauritius.

<text>The Escalante River is a tributary of the Colorado River. It is formed by the confluence of Upper Valley and Birch Creeks near the town of Escalante in south-central Utah, and from there flows southeast for approximately before joining Lake Powell. Its watershed includes the high forested slopes of the Aquarius Plateau, the east slope of the Kaiparowits Plateau, and the high desert north of Lake Powell. It was the last river of its size to be discovered in the 48 contiguous U.S. states.
The average discharge is approximately 146 cfs (4.1 m³/s).

The river was first mapped and named by Almon Thompson, a member of the 1872 Colorado River expedition led by John Wesley Powell. It was named after Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, a Franciscan missionary and the first known European explorer of the region. In 1776, Escalante and his Spanish superior Francisco Atanasio Domínguez left from Santa Fe, New Mexico in an attempt to reach Monterey, California. During this journey, usually referred to as the &quot;Domínguez–Escalante expedition&quot;, Escalante and his companions passed by the Grand Canyon and were the first white men to enter Utah.

Much of the Escalante River&#x27;s course is through sinuous sandstone gorges. The river and the rugged canyons which drain into it form a key section of Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument. This spectacular region is a popular destination for hiking and backpacking.

For most of the year, the Escalante River is a small stream, easily stepped across or waded. During spring runoff and the summer monsoon, however, the river can become a raging, muddy torrent ten to one hundred times bigger. In some years, the river can be run using kayaks or canoes (rafts are too large), but this requires both good timings — water which is too high or too low can make travel impossible, stranding boaters — and the willingness to portage boats several hundred vertical feet at the end of the trip.

<doc id="727775" wikidata="Q5065358" url="?curid=727775" title="Cervical spine disorder">
<text>Cervical spine disorders are illnesses that affect the cervical spine, which is made up of the upper first seven vertebrae, encasing and shielding the spinal cord. This fragment of the spine starts from the region above the shoulder blades and ends by supporting and connecting the skull.

The cervical spine contains many different anatomic compositions, including muscles, bones, ligaments, and joints. All of these structures have nerve endings that can detect painful problems when they occur. Such nerves supply muscular control and sensations to the skull and arms while correspondingly providing our bodies with flexibility and motion. However, if the cervical spine is injured it can cause many minor or traumatic problems, and although these injuries vary specifically they are more commonly known as &quot;cervical spine disorders&quot; as a whole.

==Symptoms==

It is through upper frontal chest discomfort (also known as cervical angina) and scapular pains which signs of cervical spine disorders are shown. In 1937 a man named Oille was the first to state that these chest pains originated from the cervical nerve root. This new outlook helped shed light on exactly what signs indicated the beginning of these ailments for those with cervical spine disorders. It is now recognized that these patients feel pain, numbness, discomfort, and weakness along with neurological symptoms.

*Numbness Numbness occurs when one develops a &quot;pinched&quot; nerve not allowing for the flow of electrical charges, which may result in the death of the nerve fiber.
*Weakness An individual becomes weak due to the compression of nerves encompassing cervical spine disorders, thus resulting in the inability to move or use arms. Those with such symptoms should seek medical treatment as soon as possible.

===Complications===

If not treated right away, there are many consequences and pains various cervical spine disorders can cause.

*Neck pains Pains in the neck area tend to be tenacious and persistent and most muscles in the cervical spinal region tighten causing for discomfort.
*Headaches Headaches are further triggered through the stiffness of neck muscles, which pull at their attachment to the skull. These headaches are recurrent in nature and start from the base of the skull and emanate upwards; they can be painful or mild.
*Arm pains Muscular spasms within the arm are further common symptoms in which such spasms are seen right above the collarbones and pressure is placed on the Brachial plexus causing arms to feel heavy and ache.
*Difficulty walking Hardships arise with cervical spinal injuries when issues with walking, balancing, and posture are affected all due to the spinal cord being compressed resulting in Myelopathy.
*Those with extremely severe outcomes may result in:Impairment

==Cause==

There are several conditions and syndromes that can affect the cervical spine and they all vary due to the difference in place and type of injury.

*Rheumatoid arthritis Those affected with rheumatoid arthritis in their cervical spine are known to have neurological deficits. It results in occipital pain and myelopathy.
*Occipito-cervical junction This disorder may result from rheumatoid arthritis, causing the hypermobility of the connection between the neck and head, resulting in paralysis or pain.
*Cerebrovascular disease Cerebrovascular disease is a type of cervical spine disorder that can cause tetraplegia.
*Subaxial cervical spine
*Atlanto-axial joint

===Age factors===

*The elderly Because of such symptoms, people often mistake cervical spine disorder indicators for coronary artery disease, and although individuals of any age can develop spine threatening injuries, the people that are affected by it the most are the elderly. This is because as one ages spinal discs that absorb any type of shock wear out increasing elders&#x27; chances of developing degenerative alterations in their cervical spine.
*The young Patients younger than eight years old with cervical spinal cord casualties have an increased chance of dying while those older than eight years have similar effects as adults. They are usually immobilized from the shoulder up until consciousness is regained and symptoms are gone.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis process might include a physician who tests that the movement, strength, and sensation of the arms and legs are normal. The spine is examined for its range of motion and any pain that may arise from movement. Blood work might be utilized in addition to radiographic imaging in order to identify spinal cord diseases. Basic imaging techniques, which includes x-ray imaging, can reveal degenerative changes of the spine, while more advanced imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can allow visualization of more detailed anatomical structures, including that of the associated nerves and muscles. The most detailed and specific testing is electrodiagnostic, which helps to uncover whether the appropriate electrical signals are being sent to each muscle from the correlate nerves. This aids in localizing a problem&#x27;s source. There are risks to be considered with any diagnostic testing. For example, in the case of CT imaging, there is obvious benefit over x-ray in that a more thorough picture of the anatomy is exposed, but there is a trade-off in that CT has around a 10-fold increased radiation exposure; alternatively, while MRI provides highly detailed imaging of the anatomy with the benefit of no radiation exposure to the patient, the high cost of this test must be taken into account.

==Treatments==

If one&#x27;s symptoms are mild, treatments like Massage, Exercise, and Stress management will suffice in reducing pain and pressure, but those with more severe symptoms are told to undergo unique therapies based on their exact situation. These patients most likely will have their postures and spine alignment fixed, and/or treatments like electrical stimulation may be used to help in reducing pain and aid in flexibility. Medicine, epidural injections and surgeries are also implemented to treat such a disorder.

<doc id="727782" wikidata="Q260036" url="?curid=727782" title="Avco World Trophy">
<text>The Avco World Trophy, also known as the Avco Cup, is the playoff championship trophy of the defunct World Hockey Association, which operated from 1972 until 1979. The trophy&#x27;s naming rights were sold to the former Avco Corporation (a name originally derived from &quot;Aviation Company&quot;), a defense contractor who bought the rights to advertise their consumer finance division. The trophy was mocked by some for its corporate sponsorship and never developed anything approaching the significance and sentiment of the Stanley Cup, its National Hockey League rival. Still, the cup&#x27;s design was often seen as creative in that it involved a freely-floating etched crystal globe embedded in the &quot;stem&quot; of the cup. The cup was designed by Frank Bonnerkopf of Boise, Idaho.

The trophy was donated to the new league in 1972 along with approximately $500,000 by the Avco Financial Services Corporation, and became the first major sports league championship trophy to bear the name of a private corporation. Three Avco trophies exist; besides the one that is on display at the Hockey Hall of Fame, the others are in Winnipeg at the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum, and in the Nova Scotia Sports Hall of Fame in Halifax. The trophy was retired after the WHA ceased operations in 1979. Led by Bobby Hull, the Winnipeg Jets claimed the trophy on three occasions, including the final league championship against Wayne Gretzky and the Edmonton Oilers. Gordie Howe and the Houston Aeros vied for the trophy three times, winning twice.

The Avco Trophy in fact may have been most famous, or perhaps infamous, in its absence. When the New England Whalers won the league&#x27;s inaugural championship in 1973 the trophy had not yet been completed, and the Whalers were forced to skate their divisional championship trophy around the ice surface.

<doc id="727783" wikidata="Q535150" url="?curid=727783" title="Universal Wrestling Federation (Japan)">
<text>The original Japanese-based Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF) was a Japanese professional wrestling promotion from 1984 to 1986, formed by wrestlers who had left New Japan Pro-Wrestling. It was a pioneer in shoot-style wrestling, which emphasized legitimate techniques and realism. It was revived as the Newborn UWF in 1988. Newborn UWF lasted until 1990. It was revived again in 1991 as Union of Wrestling Forces International (UWF International or UWFi), which in turn lasted until 1996.

Although short-lived, the UWF spawned a number of successor &quot;shoot-wrestling&quot; promotions collectively nicknamed the &quot;U-Kei&quot;, and also served as a predecessor for Japanese mixed martial arts, with many of its alumni founding proto-MMA organizations such as Shooto, Pancrase and RINGS, eventually leading to the creation of Pride FC.

==Original UWF==
The original roster included Rusher Kimura, Akira Maeda, Ryuma Go, Mach Hayato, and Gran Hamada. Soon, however, they were joined by Yoshiaki Fujiwara, Nobuhiko Takada, Satoru Sayama (the original Tiger Mask) and Kazuo Yamazaki, and this changed the orientation of the UWF&#x27;s wrestling from the traditional style to a more martial arts oriented style. Maeda, Fujiwara, Takada, Sayama and Yamazaki had been martial artists before joining New Japan Pro-Wrestling, and they began incorporating amateur wrestling and other legitimate martial arts techniques, including catch wrestling and judo submission holds, and kickboxing, which created a new form of wrestling called shoot-style. Kimura, Go, and Hamada, unable to cope with the new style, decided to leave and join All Japan Pro Wrestling instead.

In early 1984, UWF President Hisashi Shinma brokered a deal with the World Wrestling Federation which resulted in a UWF/WWF working relationship. Through this working relationship, one of UWF&#x27;s top stars Akira Maeda toured the United States with the WWF and even won the promotion&#x27;s International Heavyweight Championship. The relationship ended on July 23, 1984 after President Shinma jumped from UWF to All Japan Pro Wrestling.

In 1984 another former New Japan wrestler, Osamu Kido, who had trained under Karl Gotch, joined the UWF. But just as the promotion fledged, its top star Sayama started becoming alienated from the rest of the promotion. While the reforms introduced by Sayama were successful in draws, most wrestlers believed he was cramming too much creative power and booking UWF only for himself. This came to a head in September 1985, when Sayama and Maeda. allegedly stopped pulling their punches and kicks, in a match that fans in Japan refer to as &quot;going cement&quot;. A second, brutal match of this kind took place in September of that year, when Maeda and Sayama again began to lay in their strikes. The match ended when Maeda did not pull a kick and instead kicked Sayama hard in the groin, causing a disqualification.

As a result, Maeda was suspended and later fired by the UWF. Sayama, embittered with wrestling after this match, left the UWF and was not heard from again in the wrestling world for 11 years. The promotion dissolved and much of the roster returned to New Japan.

==Newborn UWF==
Most of the original UWF roster left New Japan yet again in 1988 to reform the UWF as the Newborn UWF. After Akira Maeda was suspended without pay for intentionally shooting on Riki Choshu and eventually dismissed from New Japan for refusing to go on an overseas excursion to Mexico, Takada, Yamazaki, Yoji Anjo, and rookie Tatsuo Nakano agreed to leave the promotion in February 1988. Newborn UWF actually started in March, with a superb card that set the standard for shoot-style wrestling to follow. Because clean finishes (as in, submissions or knockouts in the middle of the ring) were used, so the fans could see clear-cut winners and losers, it was more accepted as &quot;real fighting&quot; than New Japan or All Japan, which at the time were still using the American-originated standard of countouts and disqualifications.

Shortly after the death of Japanese Emperor Hirohito in early 1989, Maeda held a meeting with New Japan promoter Antonio Inoki, in which they agreed that Fujiwara, who had remained in New Japan but now wanted out, would be allowed to rejoin UWF and bring two of his disciples, Masakatsu Funaki and Minoru Suzuki, with him. That year also saw the debut of Kiyoshi Tamura, who is still recognized as one of the eminent shoot-style pro-wrestlers in Japan.

1990 saw many ups and downs in the short story of Newborn UWF. Future stars Masahito Kakihara and Yusuke Fuke debuted, and a new rulebook was devised in which the first person to score 5 knockdowns (in which the opponent could not get back up at once, similar to boxing knockout attempts) would win, giving the 5-knockdown situation the same weight as a submission. Shinji Jin, a non-wrestler who had taken over for Maeda as promotion president the previous year, wanted to co-promote with other federations and styles, particularly SWS and Hamada&#x27;s Universal Lucha Libre, but Maeda, resenting other forms of professional wrestling from his New Japan days, decided to put the idea off. This, and the general Japanese economic downturn of the era, prompted Newborn UWF to close its doors with a farewell card on December 1, 1990, in Matsumoto, Nagano.

The UWF wrestlers thus went their separate ways. Most of the roster (Takada, Yamazaki, Anjo, Nakano, Tamura, Kakihara, and Shigeo Miyato) founded UWF International, while Fujiwara, Funaki, Suzuki and Fuke founded Fujiwara Gumi, which made Jin&#x27;s co-promoting idea into reality. As for Maeda, he, some rookies from the former UWF dojo, and foreign fighters Chris Dolman and Dick Vrij founded Fighting Network RINGS, which would dedicate itself to pure shoot-style wrestling, and later to legitimate mixed martial arts, without actually billing itself as wrestling.

== Legacy ==
The UWF was a pioneer. Although its roots were Antonio Inoki&#x27;s wrestling style (in fact, Maeda, Sayama and Takada credit Inoki as their inspiration to become wrestlers), UWF made wrestling realistic and forced other promotions to follow. In fact, All Japan starting in 1989 abandoned countout and disqualification finishes, which enabled its Triple Crown championship to arise.

The UWF&#x27;s wrestling style has made inroads in its root promotion, New Japan, where natives Yuji Nagata, Koji Kanemoto, and Katsuyori Shibata use UWF-style kicks despite having never competed in a shoot-style promotion as their peers Minoru Tanaka, Masayuki Naruse, and Masahito Kakihara (who all joined New Japan in the early 2000s) have. Other natives who turned to martial arts fighting such as Tadao Yasuda, Kazuyuki Fujita and Kendo Ka Shin also have UWF inspiration. Above all, however, UWF made it possible for mixed-martial arts circuits to exist and be viable.

In Japan, a professional wrestling and/or mixed martial arts organizations that derived from the idea of UWF are collectively referred to &quot;UWF-kei&quot;, or &quot;U-kei&quot; for short.

<doc id="727785" wikidata="Q559442" url="?curid=727785" title="Fulbert Youlou">
<text>Fulbert Youlou (19 July 1917 – 6 May 1972) was a Congolese nationalist leader and former Catholic priest who became the first President of the Republic of the Congo upon its independence in 1960.

In August 1960, Youlou led his country into independence. In December 1960, he organised an intercontinental conference in Brazzaville, wherein he praised the advantages of economic liberalism and condemned communism. Youlou disappointed many when he imposed a single-party system and imprisoned union leaders in August 1963; this led to the revolution of the &quot;Trois Glorieuses&quot; (English: &quot;Three Glorious Days&quot;). Charles de Gaulle despised Youlou and France refused to assist him. Youlou resigned thereeafter in the face of overwhelming opposition to his governance.

== Youth and ordination ==
Youlou, whose last name means &quot;Grape&quot; in Lari, was born in Madibou in Pool. His birth date has been indicated as 29 June, 17 June or 19 July 1917. A younger child in a family of three boys, he was a Lari of the Kongo. At nine years old, he was baptised and received the Christian name Fulbert. In 1929 he entered the Petit Séminaire of Brazzaville. A bright student, he was sent to Akono in Cameroon to complete his secondary studies. After this, he entered the Grand Séminaire of Yaoundé where he did very well in philosophy. Here he met Barthélemy Boganda, the future nationalist leader of Oubangui-Chari and the first prime minister of the Central African Republic autonomous territory, but also Andre-Marie Mbida, Cameroon&#x27;s first head of state.

Returning to the country, he taught at the Seminary in Mbamou before travelling to Libreville to complete his theological studies. He completed his final cycle of studies in Brazzaville. Fulbert Youlou was ordained as a priest on 9 June 1946 or in 1949. He was assigned to the parish of Saint-François de Brazzaville where he directed several youth organisations, sporting activities, and Catholic groups. He also covered the general hospital and the prison.

== Political rise ==

=== A political priest ===
Fulbert Youlou was very interested in politics. Encouraged by his protector, Father Charles Lecomte, he offered his candidature for the African college in the territorial elections of 1947 in the district of Pool. But although Father Lecomte was elected without difficulty to the European college, Youlou suffered a bitter defeat. He realised that if he were elected, he would no longer appear so clearly supported by the administration or the missions. Although a man of the white church, thereafter he gave himself over to the African resistance.

This attitude did not please his superiors, and moreover in October 1953 a complaint was made to the diocese against the young Abbé, caught in the act of adultery. As a disciplinary measure, he was reassigned on 20 November 1954 to a mission in the forest at Mindouli where he was employed as the headmaster of a Catholic school.

During his time at Saint-François, Youlou made an impression as a Lari orator. Many Lari were followers of Matswanism, a messianic movement challenging colonialism which was founded by a Téké [André Matswa or Mutswé], who died in prison in 1942. The young Abbé managed to position himself as an interlocutor for the Matswa, taking control of Amicale, the Lari self-help organization Matswa had founded, allowing him to exercise influence on his disciples. In addition, his focus on the association enabled him to attach himself to the Lari youth. Finally, his punishment by the church confirmed him in his role as their leader because it made him appear the victim of the European-dominated Congoloese church.

=== Between politician and mystic ===
In October 1955, thanks to this revolutionary image, a Kongo council (not limited to Lari people) chose Youlou as their representative for the upcoming legislative elections. When his candidature was announced, his bishop Mgr. Bernard attempted to dissuade him. He was banned from wearing the cassock and from celebrating the Mass. The Kongos supplied a monthly pension for him and even a car with a driver to meet his needs.

Initially, Youlou&#x27;s supporters considered him the reincarnation of &quot;Jesus-Matswa,&quot; an idea encouraged by the fact that he was a priest. He himself became a living symbol of colonial resistance. A story attached him to the Loufoulakari falls, where the great Kongo Boueta Mbongo was decapitated and thrown into the water by the colonisers. He took to bathing there in his cassock, praying and calling upon the powerful ancestors. Allegedly his clothes remained dry even when he was immersed.

This mysticism was carried over into the electoral campaign. Acts of violence became the method of political action for the Bacongo militants which he oversaw. Thus on 12 December 1955, tracts by his supporters called for the Matswanists who had not joined Abbé to be &quot;whipped&quot;. One of them, Victor Tamba-Tamba, saw his house burnt down and his entire family killed on 28 December. The agitation reached fever pitch on 10 October 1956, the day of the election: when the polls of Bacongo were opened, Lari youth took it upon themselves to kill voters whom they suspected of not voting for Youlou. The authorities had to send out security forces to protect the polling stations. Calm did not long return to Brazzaville. In the following two days, a number of houses were destroyed, four thousand people were killed and several thousands were wounded. Youlou and one of his opponents, Jacques Opangault, called for calm by radio.

A week later, the results were announced. The incumbent, Jean-Félix Tchicaya was re-elected as deputy for Central Congo with 45,976 votes (29.7% of voters), against 43,193 for Jacques Opangault and 41,084 for Youlou. A collection was taken so that he could travel to Paris to attempt to buy weapons and start a war in the country against the newly elected Tchicaya. This voyage allowed him to make some new contacts.

== Rise to power ==

=== Road to the vice-presidency ===

On 17 May 1956, Youlou founded the Union démocratique de défense des intérêts africains (UDDIA), as a competitor to the Congolese Progressive Party (Parti progressiste congolais, PPC) of Tchicaya and of the section of the SFIO transformed in January 1957 into the African Socialist Movement (Mouvement socialiste africain, MSA) directed by Opangault. The symbol of the new party was the crocodile, a ferocious and powerful animal linked to sorcery and crime. An anti-communist party of Liberal Christian persuasion, it contained 46 politicians, 11 of which came from the PPC and 5 from the SFIO. His political base, hitherto limited to the three regions of Pool, Niari and Bouenza, expanded to include Kouliou, with the assistance of the PPC secretary general, Stéphane Tchitchéllé. The party&#x27;s women&#x27;s wing, &quot;Femmes-Caïmans&quot;, was among the most active political organizations in Brazzaville during 1957-1960, managing to recruit illiterate women.

In November 1956, Youlou filed papers declaring his candidacy for the election of the mayor of Brazzaville. However, these papers were in fact supposed to be filed in Pointe-Noire. French colonial officials, aware of Barthélemy Boganda&#x27;s similar dramatic rise to power in Ubangi-Shari, did not want to take the risk of letting Youlou&#x27;s request lapse, which could have caused unrest amongst the public, so they informed him of his error. They believed that they could utilize Youlou&#x27;s influence among the Lari people to their benefit. The municipal elections took place on 18 November 1956 for a single combined European and African council and the UDDIA experienced clear success, taking Brazzaville, Pointe-Noire and Dolisie. Youlou defeated Jacques Opangault who contested the results, and was elected mayor of Brazzaville, the first black elected mayor in French Equatorial Africa, with 23 seats compared to SFIO&#x27;s 11 and PPC&#x27;s 3.

Support for Tchicaya&#x27;s PPC collapsed almost entirely, leaving Opangault and Youlou as the main political contenders in the 31 March 1957 Moyen-Congo Territorial Assembly elections, held to elect a local government, in accordance with the Loi Cadre Defferre which had entered into force in 1956. Despite their earlier successes, the UDDIA&#x27;s Vice-President Simon Kikounga N&#x27;Got quit the movement and founded his own party, the Groupement pour le progrès économique et social du Moyen-Congo (GPES) Simon Kikounga N&#x27;Got took the electorate of Niari with him and won over the PPC-MSA coalition. Thus, on 31 March 1957, the UDDIA came second with 25 seats, while the coalition led by Opangault won 42 seats. Following negotiations, a coalition government was eventually formed by the MSA and UDDIA, with five ministerial portfolios assigned to each party. Opangault received the vice-presidency – French colonial governors remained as presidents until 14 July 1958 when these positions were taken by the elected African vice-presidents. Abbé took the ministry of agriculture, intending to take advantage of the numerous tours of the country which the position would require.

=== Manoeuvres and political tensions ===

During the territorial elections of March 1957, the leading colonists in the country united in the Union du Moyen-Congo (UMC) had effectively supported Youlou. In September 1957 they helped him to poach a representative of Niari, Georges Yambot, from the ranks of the GPES. The UDDIA thus achieved a majority in the Assembly, with 23 seats, which drove Opangault to the point of starting to kill all Lari he could catch in Poto-Poto. Youlou was appointed to the Vice-Presidency. The MSA expressed its outrage and threatened a general war in the country if he didn&#x27;t get the dismissal of Yambot. The crisis reached its height when Yambot was abducted on 24 November 1957 in order to force him to resign from his seat in the Assembly. The Governor, Jean Soupault, managed to broach a compromise: Opangault was restored to the Vice-Presidency and the UDDIA retained its new majority in the Assembly.

In January 1958, relations between the two parties worsened again after Youlou decided to organise UDDIA investigatory trips to the GPES fief of Dolisie. Clashes took place there between the socialists and Youlou&#x27;s supporters, leading to at least two thousands deaths and several injuries. Paris, tired of all these clashes, ordered the two Congolese leaders to control their followers.

In May 1958 Youlou further reinforced his position. On the 5th, the UDDIA&#x27;s European deputy Christian Jayle was elected to the Presidency of the territorial Assembly. In addition, after the departure of Jean-Félix Tchicaya from the Rassemblement Démocratique Africain (the pan-African party of Félix Houphouët-Boigny) the UDDIA replaced the PPC as its affiliate in the Congo. Youlou&#x27;s party thus gained the support of Paris and the goodwill of local authorities.

=== Constitutional coup d&#x27;etat ===

Despite a degree of antipathy towards de Gaulle, Youlou supported the &quot;Yes&quot; vote in the referendum on the French Community on 28 September 1958, along with Tchicaya. This position received 93% of the vote, thereby reinforcing Congo&#x27;s autonomy.

On 28 November 1958, the Territorial Assembly met in session to grant institutions to the country. The UDDIA and MSA were unable to agree on the shape the constitution should take. The atmosphere was very tense; socialist sympathisers gathered around the government building. The deputies exchanged insults as they arrived. Finally the socialist deputies stormed out of the Assembly in protest, leaving the UDDIA with a majority. Unconcerned, Youlou proclaimed the Republic on his own, passed constitutional laws, and converted the Territorial Assembly into a legislature. By a unanimous vote of the 23 deputies present, Youlou was appointed head of the provisional government. Since Opangault kept calling for war, the political climate in Pointe-Noire became hostile and so Youlou transferred the capital to Brazzaville.

The opposition, headed by Opangault, denounced this action as a constitutional coup d&#x27;État and promised to transform Brazzaville into a war zone. The next day, the MSA deputies met alone in the Assembly in Pointe-Noire to declare the actions of Youlou&#x27;s supporters illegal. This act led to riots: houses were burnt, thousands of people were killed and many more wounded. The French army was forced to intervene.

=== Establishing personal power ===

==== Elimination of parliamentary opposition ====
On 8 December 1958, Youlou became prime minister. His government sought to make itself representative of Congolese society: it included at least one deputy from each region, representatives of traditional elites and two spokesmen for youth and unions. Two European deputies from the MSA, Albert Fourvelle and André Kerherve, also received positions. The government&#x27;s majority thereby increased from 23 to 25 seats.

Opangault, whose party had only 20 seats, sought to redress the situation in the legislative elections scheduled for March 1959 by the agreement made with Youlou on 26 August 1958. Now that he was prime minister, Youlou refused to hold them. On 16 February 1959, the MSA deputies once again threatened to create chaos in Brazzaville and called for the dissolution of the assembly. When this was again denied, MSA-PPC supporters in Poto-Poto (the quarter of Brazzaville controlled by the Mbochi, who supported Opangault) attacked and started killing those they considered to be supporters of the UDDIA. These clashes rapidly consumed the whole of Brazzaville and transformed into a bloody battle between rival bands of Mbochi and Lari, which went beyond the simple rivalry between the MSA and the UDDIA. The riots officially resulted in a thousand deaths and many more injuries and destroyed homes. Only with the intervention of the French Army on 20 February did the riots come to an end. This fighting marked the beginning of a fierce hostility between the Mbochi and Lari.

Youlou took advantage of these events by arresting Opangault, accusing him of inciting the violence. He was released five months later without ever facing trial, but promising revenge. In the meantime, Youlou ensconced himself in power. On 20 February 1959 he ordered the adoption of a constitution which gave expanded powers to the prime minister, including the power to dissolve the Assembly. In April 1959, the MSA suffered two further defections to the UDDIA, leading Opangault to threaten to kill all Lari he could catch on his way. On 30 April, Youlou finally dissolved parliament, after he had carefully redrawn the electoral districts. On 14 June 1959, the UDDIA won 51 seats in the Assembly, with 58% of the vote. The MSA received only 10 seats.

After these legislative elections, the Assembly became National. It confirmed Youlou in the role of prime minister and then, on 21 November, elected him president of the Republic of Congo. Triumphant over his rivals in parliament, he curbed the inveterate Matswanists who still refused to consider him the reincarnation of Matswa. From June to July 1959, they were hunted down, arrested, and brutally subjugated – one source speaks of 9,000 deaths.

==== Repression, seduction and submission ====

On 16 February 1960, in order to satisfy Congolese public opinion, the President of the Republic decided to sack the European members of the government. These were the minister of finance, Joseph Vidal; the minister of economic affairs, Henri Bru; and the Secretary of State for Information, Christian Jayle. On the other hand, Youlou retained Alfred Delarue, his chief of service for &quot;Documentation&quot;. Delarue, a former official in the Prefecture of Police of Paris and a Vichy collaborator, had organised, to Abbé&#x27;s advantage, the elimination of the Congolese far-left, which had regrouped as the Confédération générale africaine des travailleurs (CGTA) and the Union de la jeunesse congolaise (UJC). On 9 May 1960, on account of a fake &quot;Communist plot&quot;, Youlou had the leaders of the CGTA and the UJC, Julien Boukambou and Aimé Matsika, arrested – along with his long-time opponent Simon Kikounga N&#x27;Got. The next day, the Assembly passed a number of laws restricting fundamental rights. Henceforth, any organised opposition to the government was illegal, as were publications encouraging such opposition. Furthermore, these laws entitled Youlou to imprison, kill or exile any individual considered dangerous to the stability of the regime.

Despite Youlou&#x27;s use of coercive measures against his adversaries, he was equally keen to bring them over to his side. On 17 June 1959, after his legislative victory, contested by Opangault, he called for national unity:
: &quot;Les élections du 14 juin n&#x27;ont pas été la victoire d&#x27;un parti ou d&#x27;un programme dans le sens qu&#x27;on lui donne en Europe; elles marquent le début d&#x27;une unité nationale, qui ne pourra que se renforcer.&quot; 
: The elections of 14 June were not the victory of one party or policy in the way they are in Europe; they mark the beginning of national unity, which can only grow stronger.
On 3 July, Youlou formed his second government, incorporating opposition politicians. On 15 August 1960, Jacques Opangault was made a minister of state and vice-president of the council, highly symbolic positions. Finally, in January 1961, Simon Kikounga N&#x27;Got received the portfolio of Economic Affairs.
On 15 August 1960, the Republic of Congo became independent. A cult of personality progressively developed around the president, including notably the printing of stamps with his image on them. In the months following independence, a motion of no confidence in his government was proposed in the Assembly. Offended, Youlou came up naked and pulled an AK-47 from his cassock in the middle of the Assembly and forced the impertinent deputies to retract the motion. The affair was not repeated and on 2 March 1961, a new constitution was adopted; it created a strengthened presidential regime and established the independence of the executive and legislative branches: the Assembly could no longer depose the government and the President of the Republic could not dissolve the Assembly.

On 20 March 1961, Youlou was the UDDIA and MSA candidate in the presidential elections. He was re-elected without opposition, with 100% of the votes. This victory marked for him the successful construction of national unity. Henceforth he could devote himself entirely to economic development and social progress.

=== Youlou&#x27;s economic policy ===

Congo was one of the most economically profitable French colonies; between 1946 and 1959 a number of infrastructure projects were completed and some light industry established. Thus, at independence, Youlou inherited a relatively healthy economy with 37.4% of GDP produced by the primary sector, 20.9% by industry and 41.7% in the tertiary sector. Furthermore, in 1958 the Congo was home to 30,000 civil servants of varying qualification and more than 80,000 students. This educational policy was strongly encouraged by Youlou who assigned 40% of the 1960 budget to education.

==== Support for economic liberalism ====
The Congolese leader was a fierce supporter of economic liberalism. After he took power, he adopted a moderate policy, striving to attract investment in his country, as shown in a comment made on 8 December 1958:
: &quot;Nous sommes prêts à formuler toutes garanties pour que s&#x27;investissent sans crainte, et dans la plus grande confiance, les capitaux publics et privés sans lesquels il n&#x27;est pas possible de concevoir la mise en place de grandes sources d&#x27;énergie et des usines de transformations&quot;.
: We are willing to make every guarantee to ensure the investment, without fear and in the greatest confidence, of the public and private capital without which the establishment of great power sources and factories of transformation is impossible.
Between 1960 and 1963, the Congo registered 38 billion CFA francs gross of investment in its territory, for a GDP estimated at 30 billion CFA francs in 1961. Mineral resources alone attracted 21 billion CFA francs, with manganese exploited by the Compagnie minière de l&#x27;Ogooué (COMILOG) and potassium by the Compagnie des potasses du Congo (CPC). Of the remaining 17 billion CFA francs, 3 billion (18%) were invested in the primary sector, 2.7 billion (15%) in industry, 6.3 billion (37%) in the tertiary sector, and 5 billion (30%) in non-economic programmes like education, health, urbanisation and housing. Despite Youlou&#x27;s liberal policies, only 5.5 billion (32%) of this 17 billion came from private capital; international aid (notably from France) supplied 7 billion (41%) and the Congolese government 4.5 billion (27%).

In terms of the balance of trade, the situation seemed to improve during Youlou&#x27;s presidency. Thus in 1960, the commercial deficit was 5.7 billion CFA francs and in 1963 it was down to 4.1 billion. Each year Congolese exports (excluding diamonds) increased, from 6.1 billion in 1960 to 7.9 billion in 1963. Around half of this sum came from timber. The products of light industry, such as sugar, made up more than a quarter of exports. Furthermore, the commercial deficit was greatly reduced by transit tax. Congo in fact derived significant revenue from its railroad and port infrastructure, which allowed it to serve neighbouring countries. In 1963 this transit brought Congo 2.3 billion CFA francs in revenue.

==== Corruption and major projects ====
Youlou&#x27;s administration was not very concerned about its budget deficit. Between 1960 and 1963, the deficit rose to 2.4 billion CFA francs. France graciously financed 1.2 billion. The rest was covered by advances from the French treasury. To recover the financial situation, fiscal pressure rose from 17% of GDP in 1960 to 26% in 1963 while austerity measures were introduced in the administration: heads of civil service offices lost their official vehicles, travel expenses were no longer reimbursed, and advances were blocked. The President of the Republic, the ministers and the deputies were exempt from these measures.

To make the government more representative of Congolese society, many ministerial appointments were made on the basis of regional origin rather than competence, creating problems for the country&#x27;s development. Furthermore, members of government were responsible for several financial scandals – Youlou most of all. The Congolese head of state had an acute sense of staging; conscious that his religious appearance lent him political power, he continued to wear his religious garb and to employ the nickname &quot;Abbé&quot; (Abbot) as well as &quot;Kiyunga&quot; (the Lari word for &quot;cassock&quot;). It is reported that his wardrobe, which contained a full collection of cassocks in white, black, and red, was supplied by the famous fashion designer Christian Dior. It is also reported that for an official visit to France, Youlou had 59 billion CFA francs assigned for his personal expenses. The national economy suffered as a result of this mismanagement of public funds. And economic growth was too modest to absorb high levels of unemployment exacerbated by rapid urbanisation.

However, Congo possessed remarkable assets for its development. In addition to its mineral wealth and its timber, the country had notable hydro-electric possibilities at Sounda, near Pointe-Noire, on the Kouilou-Niari River. The construction of a dam on this site would enable the production of 8 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year and the development of heavy electro-metallurgic and chemical industry, offering significant employment. Enthusiastic about this project, Youlou nevertheless faced two major problems: the incredible cost, estimated at 100 billion CFA francs and the Congo&#x27;s insufficient supply of bauxite, a key material for the project. The Congolese leader attempted to remedy these issues through an active foreign policy.

=== A &quot;moderate&quot; foreign policy ===
By an anti-communist and pro-western policy, termed &quot;moderate&quot;, Youlou attempted to attract foreign investment in his country. From independence, he affirmed his desire to pursue a policy of co-operation with France and the other Francophone countries of Africa. From 15 to 19 December 1960, he held an intercontinental conference in the Congolese capital, which assembled the &quot;moderate&quot; Francophone heads of state. At the end of this conference, the &quot;groupe de Brazzaville&quot; was created, an anti-communist block which was the ancestor of the African and Malagasy Union (OCAM).

Among the guests of this conference were the President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Joseph Kasa-Vubu, and the Katanga leader Moïse Tshombe. Abbé undoubtedly brought them together in order to isolate the Congolese nationalist Patrice Lumumba, accused of communist sympathies. Although he invited both, Youlou showed more support for the very controversial Tshombe than for Kasa-Vubu. 
In exchange for economic assistance with the planned Sounda dam, Youlou provided Tshombe with logistical support necessary for the separatist regime. However, his counterpart in Léopoldville was a Kongo like him; they appeared at the time to cherish the hope of reuniting a massive Bakongo state. Abbé took other controversial positions; although Angola was subject to violent colonial repression, he was the only leader to call for dialogue with the Portuguese dictator Salazar.

Despite his visceral anti-communism, the President of the Republic sought to establish relations with the &quot;revolutionary&quot; Ahmed Sékou Touré of Guinea. He sought, in fact, Guinea&#x27;s bauxite mines – essential for the Kouilou dam project. Thus, in 1962 he travelled to Guinea. On 5 and 6 June 1963, it was the turn of Sékou Touré to visit Congo, where he was acclaimed by militant unions and youth. On the occasion of his trip, the Guinean leader made encouraging economic promises:
: La Guinée est riche en minerais et elle est disposée, je le dis, à mettre à disposition du Congo toutes les quantités de bauxite ou de fer nécessaires à la réalisation du Kouilou et plus tard à la rentabilité de l&#x27;usine qui sera construite.
: &quot;Guinea is rich in minerals and is disposed, I say, to put whatever amounts of bauxite and iron necessary for the completion of Kouilou and for the profitability of subsequent factories, at Congo&#x27;s disposal.&quot;

=== Revolution of the &#x27;Trois Glorieuses&#x27; ===
Even before independence, Congo-Brazzaville was effectively dominated by a single dominant party. In August 1962, Fulbert Youlou announced his intention to institutionalise this one-party state « &quot;afin de sceller la réconciliation et l&#x27;unité nationale réalisées&quot; » (in order to seal the reconciliation and national unity). He did not experience any opposition; on the contrary, the decision appeared to be enthusiastically received by the MSA leader Jacques Opangault. In pursuit of this goal, a round table was organised for 3 August 1963, gathering the leaders of the three parties (UDDIA, MSA and PPC), the relevant unions, representatives in the National Assembly and leaders of the Congolese army. Although not opposed to a one-party state in principle, the unions refused to accept the system proposed by the head of state, on the grounds that they appeared to serve only Youlou&#x27;s interests.
In order to demonstrate their disapproval, the Congolese trade unions decided to organise an « &quot;arrêt de protestation&quot; » (protest strike) on 13 August at the Labour exchange in Brazzaville. The day before this protest, in the night, Youlou had the principal union leaders arrested. When this news was announced, the simple protest transformed into a true anti-governmental action. The protestors planned to raid the prison in order to free the union leaders, leading to clashes with security forces. Hundreds of unionists were killed. When they finally succeeded, the arrested leaders could not by found. The anti-governmental protest turned into a riot; the country was paralysed. The French army co-operated with the Congolese forces in order to re-establish order. That evening, Abbé instituted a curfew, declared a state of emergency and called for calm on the radio.

The next day, around noon, the President of the Republic declared on the radio:
: &quot;En raison de la gravité de la situation, je prends en mon nom personnel les pouvoirs civils et militaires. Un comité restreint, placé sous l&#x27;autorité du chef de l&#x27;État, aura pour tâche le rétablissement de l&#x27;ordre, la reprise du travail et la mise en place des réformes qui s&#x27;imposent&quot;.
: On account of the gravity of the situation, I take, in my name, civil and military authority. A select committee under the authority of the Head of State will be charged with restoring order, returning people to work and instituting the necessary reforms.

In the evening, the government was dissolved. However, the ministers Jacques Opangault, Stéphane Tchitchéllé and Dominique Nzalakanda were retained in their roles. On the announcement that the very unpopular Nzalakanda had been retained, the militant supporters of Youlou decided to join the protestors. On the morning of 15 August, the mob marched on the Presidential Palace to demand Youlou&#x27;s resignation. Some bore placards saying « &quot;À bas la dictature de Youlou&quot; » (For the fall of Youlou&#x27;s dictatorship) or « &quot;Nous voulons la liberté&quot; » (We want freedom). The unionists managed to secure the sympathy of two captains of the Congolese army. One of them, Captain Félix Mouzabakani, was Youlou&#x27;s nephew. Youlou called de Gaulle and requested French assistance, asking that French troops near Brazzaville free the Presidential Palace, in vain. Accepting the situation, Youlou announced his resignation as President of the Republic, Mayor of Brazzaville and Member of the National Assembly.

The new regime dubbed the protests of 13, 14 and 15 August 1963 &quot;revolutionary&quot; and named them the « &quot;Trois glorieuses&quot; » (Three Glorious Days).

== Forced retirement ==

=== Detention and exile ===
The evening of his resignation, the former President of the Republic was imprisoned at the Fulbert Youlou military camp. A few weeks later he was transferred with his family to the Djoué army camp. He appeared to be treated well. Realising that Youlou&#x27;s days were numbered, his successor as head of state, Alphonse Massamba-Débat, helped him to flee to Léopoldville on 25 March 1965. The Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Moïse Tshombe, immediately granted him political asylum.

On 8 June 1965 a trial of Youlou by popular tribunal began in Congo-Brazzaville. He was accused of genocide, misappropriation of public funds, and of using a Heron war-plane which had been received from the French government for personal purposes. Furthermore, he was held responsible for the death of the three unionists during the assault on the prison on 13 August 1963. He was also charged with having supported the Katangan secession orchestrated by Moise Tshombe. The court condemned him to death in his absence and ordered the nationalisation of all his property, notably a farm at Madibou and two luxury hotels in Brazzaville. Youlo defended himself against these accusations by the publication of a book, &quot;J&#x27;accuse la Chine&quot; (I accuse China), really an anti-communist pamphlet, in 1966.

In November 1965, Youlou expressed a desire for the French government to allow him to settle in Nice to receive medical care. But the former Congolese leader was not in favour in Paris. Yvonne de Gaulle, a fervent Catholic, did not like the eccentric priest, who had continued to wear the cassock although defrocked and who openly publicized his polygamy (he had no less than four official wives). Against the advice of General de Gaulle, Youlou disembarked at Bourget with his wives and children. Despite the advice of his councillor for African Affairs Jacques Foccart, de Gaulle seriously considered returning him to Léopoldville. Finally, Youlou was sent to Spain, where Franco&#x27;s regime treated him well. The French government put 500,000 francs at his disposal for him to maintain himself.

=== Aborted coup d&#x27;etat and anathema ===
After Youlou stepped down, Congo-Brazzaville failed to enjoy political stability. After protests by pro-Youlists in February 1964, supporters of the former regime attempted a coup on 14 July 1966 and again in January 1967 leading to the deaths of several thousand people. Eventually, the Marxist captain Marien Ngouabi succeeded Alphonse Massamba-Débat. Shortly after taking the presidency, he denounced the Youlist plots which were orchestrated by captain Félix Mouzabakani (Youlou&#x27;s nephew) and Bernard Kolelas in February and November 1969. On 22 March 1970, a Youlist coup d&#x27;État was attempted by lieutenant Pierre Kinganga, but it too failed.

The socialist and revolutionary regime which succeeded Youlou held him responsible for all the country&#x27;s problems. His name was struck from public discourse. It was in this atmosphere that Youlou died of hepatitis in Madrid on 5 May 1972. Representatives of the Lari people called for the return of his body so that it could receive the necessary funerary rites. President Ngouabi allowed this, in order to avoid the development of a Matswanist messianic movement around his image. On 16 December 1972, after his remains had lain in state for three days in the Brazzaville Cathedral, they were interred in his home village of Madibou, without any official ceremony. His memory was rehabilitated at the National Conference of 1991 which restored multi-party democracy in the Republic of Congo.

<doc id="727791" wikidata="Q459155" url="?curid=727791" title="Edward Youde">
<text>Sir Edward Youde (; Cantonese: &quot;Yau Tak&quot;; 19 June 1924 – 5 December 1986) was a British administrator, diplomat, and Sinologist. He served as Governor of Hong Kong from 20 May 1982 until his death on 5 December 1986.

==Early years==
Youde was born in Penarth, South Wales, in the United Kingdom and from 1942 attended the University of London&#x27;s School of Oriental and African Studies. He also served in the Royal Naval Reserve.

==Career==
In 1947, Youde joined the Foreign Office, where he would serve the rest of his life, and was swiftly posted to the British embassy in Nanking, then the capital of the Republic of China. In 1949, amidst the Chinese Civil War, HMS &quot;Amethyst&quot; came under attack by People&#x27;s Liberation Army forces while sailing on the Yangtze River. The frigate was heavily damaged by artillery fire and became stranded in the Yangtze River. Using his skills in Mandarin, Youde negotiated with the PLA commander to ask for the release of the &quot;Amethyst&quot;. His negotiations came to naught, but bought enough time for the &quot;Amethyst&quot; to plan a successful escape to Hong Kong under the cover of darkness. Youde was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his actions.

In 1950, following the Communists&#x27; victory in the civil war, Britain recognised the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and the British embassy moved to Beijing. Youde went on to serve a total of four tours of Foreign Office duty in China, the last as ambassador, from 1974 to 1978. He also served in Washington (1956 to 1959) and as a member of the British mission to the United Nations (1965 to 1969).

Youde was knighted in 1977.

==Hong Kong governorship==
When Youde took office as Governor in 1982, he sought to expand Hong Kong&#x27;s further education system which he considered to be lacking. At that time, there were only two accredited universities in Hong Kong - the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Statistics also suggested that only 2% of secondary school graduates attended university locally. In view of this, Youde created the City Polytechnic of Hong Kong (now City University of Hong Kong) and the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts. The idea of setting up a secondary school to develop students&#x27; potential in sport and the visual arts together with a normal academic syllabus was first mooted by Youde. Based upon this idea, the Jockey Club Ti-I College was founded in 1989.

Youde delivered his first policy address to the Hong Kong Legislative Council in October 1982, in which he stated that he wanted to &quot;create an environment that encourages citizens to develop their energy and enterprising spirit; only under special circumstances, such as disruption of normal operations and workers not being treated fairly , or Hong Kong&#x27;s reputation is damaged, the government will intervene in the industrial, commercial and financial sectors.&quot; Although Hong Kong&#x27;s economy was in recession, he personally led trade missions to the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States and China to promote Hong Kong&#x27;s trade. He also promulgated many laws to control and supervise the banking, insurance, securities, finance and trade industries.

Youde is especially remembered for his tenure as the Hong Kong Governor and his role in negotiating the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which was signed in Beijing in 1984. This, among other things, made it clear the British would leave Hong Kong in 1997 after 156 years of colonial rule. To this end, Youde embarked on further political reforms to support the development of representative democracy in Hong Kong and issued a green paper on Hong Kong democracy in 1984. The reform stated 24 seats in the Legislative Council will be elected by the electoral college and functional constituencies, with 12 seats each elected by voting. On September 26, 1985, Hong Kong held its first indirect election for the Legislative Council, officially starting Hong Kong&#x27;s representative government system. However, many Hong Kong citizens were worried about the future of Hong Kong. The British-owned Jardine Matheson announced that it would move its head office from Hong Kong to Bermuda . This was regarded by all sectors of society as Britain&#x27;s intention to withdraw its capital, and as a result, they became even more worried about the future of Hong Kong. Youde also had to deal with a substantial emigration wave after it became apparent Hong Kong citizens would not be offered British citizenship during the handover, so many many Hong Kongers made private arrangements with emigration to Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom being popular destinations with outflows between 1988 and 1994 averaged about 55,000 per year, although some Hong Kong people returned after in the early years after 1997. 

Youde was Hong Kong&#x27;s only Welsh Governor was widely liked for his kindly demeanour and greatly admired for his formidable erudition. In an editorial following his death, the Chinese-language &quot;Ming Pao&quot; newspaper compared him to Zhuge Liang, a chancellor of the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period, who had &#x27;pledged to work diligently on state affairs until death.&#x27; Youde was known for his love of Chinese literature and Chinese language. He once claimed he read several Chinese newspapers every day when he had breakfast.

==Death and state funeral==
During a visit to Beijing, Youde suffered a fatal heart attack in the British Embassy in the early hours of 5 December 1986, while asleep. He was the only Governor of Hong Kong to die in office.

At his funeral – Hong Kong&#x27;s first state funeral with full military honours – the streets were lined with people. The casket, draped in the Governor&#x27;s Standard, was carried by ten guardsmen, and a 17-gun salute was fired from the shore station of . Youde was cremated, and his ashes interred at Canterbury Cathedral in England, and a memorial plaque was installed in the nave.

==Remembrance and legacy==
A fund, the Sir Edward Youde Memorial Fund, was created from public contributions upon the recommendation of the Legislative Council. The fund is now administered by the HKSAR Government and offers a number of scholarships and sponsorship schemes aimed at encouraging and promoting the education of and research by Hong Kong people. To be eligible for the Sir Edward Youde Memorial Fund, candidates must be proficient in English and Chinese and also have a good mastery of the language in which their studies will be undertaken.

The Edward Youde Aviary in Hong Kong Park was named after him in 1992, in recognition of his birdwatching interest. The Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital in Hong Kong was named after his wife.

A plaque to his memory was commissioned by the Hong Kong Civil Service and placed on the wall of St John&#x27;s Cathedral, in the Central District of Hong Kong. As mentioned above, another was placed at Canterbury Cathedral.

==Personal and family==
Youde married Pamela Fitt and the couple had two daughters, Jennifer and Deborah.

<doc id="727795" wikidata="Q4838505" url="?curid=727795" title="Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game">
<text>The Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game (&quot;B5 CCG&quot;) is an out-of-print collectible card game set in the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; universe. It was published from 1997 to 2000. The game is ideally set for 4-5 players but can be played with a minimum of two players up to as many as 20 if using multiple Non-Aligned Factions and Home Factions. This CCG is distinct from most others of the genre for being specifically designed to be played by more than two players. The gameplay tends to have strong political elements encouraging significant player interaction aka &quot;table talk&quot; which is appropriate for a game based on a series which featured such a strong element of political intrigue. During its six-year existence under the Precedence Entertainment banner it released two core sets, five expansions sets and one revision set. There were two World Championships during that time. The game still continues to have a cult following as further expansions were made available online.

==History==
Initially planning for a November release, the game was launched on December 11, 1997 in North America with the release of &quot;Premiere&quot;. Precedence then began hiring more staff to promote the B5 CCG as quickly and completely as possible. A large part of their success came with their promoting of the game. Not only would they give free starter decks at major conventions but they offered solid prize support for local tournaments that were organised through their Ranger program. Precedence was also the first company to begin a successful promo chase card program, where various promo cards were made available through different means of acquiring them, some more difficult than others. This, as opposed to other companies who offered relatively common cards as promos, gave Precedence an edge in marketing not seen before. They followed up their debut with the Shadows expansion and within the same year released the Deluxe edition, a reprint of the Premier Edition (minus the starter decks) and the Great War expansion. By the beginning of 1999, they found themselves near the top of the CCG market at that time.

&quot;1998 was a year of triple digit growth for Precedence, much of it spurred on by the broad based international success of our Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game,&quot; reports Precedence Entertainment CEO Paul W. Brown III

&quot;&quot;For some months now, Babylon 5 has been one of the best selling and most played hobby card games in every country where the game is sold; particularly in North America, the UK and as far abroad as Australia. The enthusiasm and support of the fans has been overwhelming&quot;,&quot; stated Brown. &quot;We&#x27;re most proud of the game&#x27;s reputation for being true to the show. When your die- hard players even include people who have written for the actual series, like Babylon 5&#x27;s original executive story editor Larry Ditillio, you know you&#x27;re doing something right.&quot;

In 1999, Precedence and Warner Brothers came to an agreement to renew the licensing to continue use of the Babylon 5 franchise until June 2001.

After their breakout year they released Psi Corps, an expansion dedicated to the world of telepaths. To promote this release, Precedence ran a contest where booster pack purchasers could collect 5 randomly inserted psi corps identicards (chase cards) to redeem them for a chance to have dinner with Walter Koenig, the actor who portrayed Alfred Bester on the show. This was followed by Severed Dreams the same year and in 2000, Wheel of Fire and Crusade.

In June 2001 Warner Brothers chose not to renew Precedence&#x27;s license which brought publication/distribution of the game to an abrupt halt. This caused the cancellation of the Collector&#x27;s set which was already at the printers, and the well into development Anla&#x27;shok expansion. The company closed its doors in 2002 although this was not as a direct result of the ending of the Babylon 5 licensing agreement with WB.

==Sets==
The Babylon 5 CCG was released as a base set (Premiere Edition) in December 1997. It consisted of 445 cards sold in 60-card starter decks and 8-card booster packs. Each starter deck was keyed to one of the four races in the game, and consisted of 50 commons fixed to a particular race, and 10 random uncommon and rare cards. Ultra-rare chase cards, some signed by actress Mira Furlan (who had the role of Delenn in the television show), were randomly inserted in some booster packs. In January 1998, two introductory box sets were released, each with a simplified rulebook, a booster pack, and two fixed 50-card starter decks. These covered the Earth-Minbari and Centauri-Narn Wars depicted in the show.

It was followed by seven expansion sets:
* The Shadows (1998)
* Deluxe (basically a reprint of Premier including the &quot;fixed&quot; cards from the starter decks but no starter decks themselves) (1998)
* Great War (December 1998)
* Psi Corps (1999)
* Severed Dreams (1999)
* Wheel of Fire (2000)
* Crusade (2000)

The Collectors Set was at the printers at the time that the games production was stopped.

&quot;The Shadows&quot;, released in June 1998, was the first expansion set and had 203 cards (100 rare, 53 uncommon, 50 common) sold in 12-card booster packs that each contained two rare cards. It was known as &quot;Shadow War&quot; during its early development. It covered the television show&#x27;s second and third seasons, and 2,500 booster packs included a Morden card signed by Ed Wasser, the actor who played the role. Because of collation errors in the original set, Precedence Entertainment enacted a new policy that individuals whose booster packs had problems could send in the UPC code and receive six rare cards in exchange, and individuals who bought five booster boxes but failed to complete a set would receive a copy of each missing card.

The &quot;Great War&quot; expansion set was based on the Shadow War events in the third season of the television show. It introduced the Shadow and Vorlon fleets, and the Non-Aligned Worlds faction. Precedence Entertainment was negotiating with Claudia Christian and Peter Jurasik, who respectively portrayed the roles of Commander Susan Ivanova and Londo Mollari, to sign a number of their character&#x27;s cards for inclusion as chase cards in booster packs. The 350-card set was released in November 1998 and was based on the television show&#x27;s third season and early episodes of the fourth season. It enabled games to have more than four players.

The expansion set &quot;Psi Corps&quot; was planned for March 1999, and the release would include signed cards of the character Alfred Bester by its actor Walter Koenig. It introduced the Psi Corps factions based on the Psi Corps agency of humans with telepathic or para-psychological abilities from the television show.

The planned expansion set &quot;Crusade&quot; would be based on the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; spin-off television series &quot;Crusade&quot; and introduced the Drakh faction for a planned release in July 1999. The set &quot;The Third Age&quot; was planned for release in 2000 and based on the fifth season of the television show. By July 1999 it had been renamed &quot;Severed Dreams&quot; and its focus shifted to the end of the fourth season of the television show.

A number of fan sets have been created and there is an active Facebook group led by Bruce Mason, one of the senior Rangers, that is re-imagining the game under the name the B5 Virtual Card Game (B5VCG)

==Zeta Squadron==
Zeta Squadron was the official member club of B5 CCG players registered with Precedence publishing. They received newsletters which informed them of upcoming events and expansions. They also received promo cards such as the Na&#x27;Toth (variant).

An equivalent newsletter &quot;Black Omega&quot; was published in the United Kingdom supporting the European player base.

==Tournament formats==
There are several variant tournament formats that can be used when playing the B5 CCG. Below is a listed of most commonly used formats.

The Rangers were tournament organizers from around the world who conducted sanctioned tournaments, game demonstrations and arranged playtesting on behalf of Precedence.

===World Championships===
During the course of the B5 CCG lifespan, Precedence Entertainment held two World Championships. Each featured a large proportion of players from around the world and fierce competition:

====First World Championship====

The first B5 CCG World Championship was held at Vorcon 1 in Pomona, California, October 16–18, 1998. Held at the Sheraton Fairplex Hotel &amp; Conference Center, the eventual winner was Canadian champion, Serge Lavergne of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. He had used a Narn / Vorlon military hybrid speed deck with the “Order Above All” winning agenda.

Opposition came from Australians Steve Green and Les Allen, Marcel Kopper of Germany, UK Champion Mike Pemberthy, Pan-European Champion Hayden Gittings, as well as Americans John 
Paiva, Pete Simpson, Kyle Bennick, Mike Jasperson, Anthony Oshmago, David Sisson, Paul Beaman, Kyle Sykora and John and Johnna Golden.

====Second World Championship====

The second B5 CCG World Championship was in Aachen, Germany, October 8–10, 1999. The champion there was Martin Franz who used a Human deck with the agenda “A Rising Power”. The Final table comprised Marco Schütz (Narn), Michael Brand (Minbari), Peter Ender (Centauri) and Paul Sheward (Non-Aligned).

The second World Championship again featured national qualifiers, but there was also a pre-qualifying tournament run the day before. This allowed a number of locally based players to qualify for the World Championship itself and led to the makeup of the &quot;top table&quot; i.e. 4 out of the 5 players were &quot;local&quot; Germans. It was commented upon that this turned the World Final into a team event with the German players ensuring that one of them won the tournament.

==Gameplay==
Each player represents one of the races holding a seat in the Babylon 5 Council of Races, for which there is a related starter deck. They begin the game with a hand of four cards they choose, one of which must be the ambassador for their chosen race. The other cards are chosen from aftermath, agenda, character, conflict, enhancement, event, fleet, group, and location cards from their deck. Turn order is determined by the influence of each player, from least to greatest.

A player will use &quot;influence&quot;, which represents factional strength, in order to play cards, acquire favors, and increase their &quot;power&quot;. During the game, various factors are tracked on an included sheet, including influence, tension, and unrest.

Characters have a supporting role when they enter play, but may become part of the ambassador&#x27;s inner circle as the game progresses with the use of influence. Characters can be neutralized (their cards are turned face down) when they sustain damage; those with a supporting role are subsequently discarded, whereas those in the inner circle may be healed.

==Signed/Embossed Cards==
Precedence randomly included cards autographed by actors from the show in booster packs in every set/expansion that was produced. With the exception of the Premier edition, these cards were also embossed with Precedence&#x27;s logo to confirm authenticity.

In most cases these boosters were also &quot;God packs&quot; i.e. where every card in the booster was of rare rarity replacing the normal distribution of common and uncommon cards.

==Promo cards==
Precedence also produced promotional cards for each of the sets/expansions. The cards were distributed as tournament prizes, box toppers, with hobby magazines such as Scrye and also by mail-in offers.

==Online play==
Programs such as LackeyCCG and Vassal allow players to meet and play online.

==Reception==
In a review published in the May 1998 issue of &quot;The Duelist&quot;, Cory Herndon stated that Precedence Entertainment had &quot;done the popular sci-fi series justice&quot; because &quot;the card game is just as complicated and involved as the show&#x27;s five-year story arc&quot; with a &quot;great creative framework in which to play&quot;. He also stated that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t lend itself well to a two-player game&quot;. In a subsequent review in the October 1998 issue, he stated that the game had &quot;well-thought-out mechanics&quot; and &quot;sharp game play&quot;.

<text>James Luther Dickinson (November 15, 1941 – August 15, 2009) was an American record producer, pianist, and singer who fronted, among others, the band Mud Boy and the Neutrons, based in Memphis, Tennessee.

== Biography ==
Dickinson was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, and raised in Chicago and Memphis. He initially attended Baylor University as a drama major before graduating from Memphis State University, where he became acquainted with the pioneering music journalist Stanley Booth. After receiving his degree, he played on recording sessions for Bill Justis and recorded at Chips Moman&#x27;s American Studios. Dickinson recorded what has been described as the last great single released by Sun Records—&quot;Cadillac Man&quot; backed with &quot;My Babe&quot;, by The Jesters (1966)—playing piano and singing lead on both sides, although he was not a member of the group.

==Early career==
By 1966, Dickinson began working as a record producer for the famous Ardent Studios, in Memphis, Tennessee, which was founded by John Fry in 1959. The young and eager Dickinson produced and oversaw a series of blistering sessions involving bands like the Bitter Ind (The 31st of February), and the Wallabies. Members of the Wallabies—Alex Major (electric bass, rhythm guitar, harmonica, lead singer and songwriter), Bobby Maxwell (lead guitar, harmony, lead singer on some songs), Alan Palmore (rhythm guitar, harmony, lead singer on some songs and songwriter), and Glen Wilson (drums)—recorded Major&#x27;s song &quot;Up and Down Children&quot;, a marriage of garage rock and a twisted Merseybeat sound. In 2008 the first series of songs were released by Big Beat Records on a compilation album entitled &quot;Thank You Friends: The Ardent Records Story&quot; and in 2012 on the compilation album &quot;The Psychedelic Sound of Memphis&quot;.

==Career==
In the late 1960s, Dickinson joined with fellow Memphis musicians Charlie Freeman (guitar), Michael Utley (keyboards), Tommy McClure (bass) and Sammy Creason (drums); this group became known as the Dixie Flyers and backed a variety of performers, including Bettye LaVette, Hank Ballard, James Carr, Albert Collins and The Tempters.

In 1970, the group began to back Atlantic Records&#x27; venerable stable of soul acts at the behest of the producer Jerry Wexler (who was introduced to the group by Booth) following the acrimonious dissolution of his relationship with the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. Based at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, they recorded Aretha Franklin&#x27;s 1970 hit &quot;Spirit in the Dark&quot;; over the next year, the Flyers also contributed to recordings by Carmen McRae, Delaney &amp; Bonnie, Jerry Jeff Walker, Dee Dee Warwick, Ronnie Hawkins, Sam &amp; Dave, Dion, Brook Benton, Lulu, Sam the Sham, and Esther Phillips. Unable to acclimate to life in Miami and the variegated production styles of Wexler, Tom Dowd, and Arif Mardin, Dickinson heeded the advice of Duane Allman and left the group to pursue a solo career in 1971. The remaining Flyers backed Kris Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge for several years before ultimately disbanding in the mid-1970s.

Dickinson&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Dixie Fried&quot;, was released by Atlantic in 1972. In addition to the Carl Perkins-penned title song, it featured songs by Bob Dylan and Furry Lewis.

In the 1970s, he became known as a producer, recording Big Star&#x27;s &quot;Third&quot; in 1974, and serving as co-producer with Alex Chilton of Chilton&#x27;s 1979 album, &quot;Like Flies on Sherbert&quot;. He produced recordings for performers as diverse as Willy DeVille, Green on Red, Mojo Nixon, The Replacements, Tav Falco&#x27;s Panther Burns, Toots and the Maytals, and Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins. He appeared in &quot;Beale Street Saturday Night&quot;, a 1977 aural documentary of Memphis&#x27;s Beale Street, which featured performances by Sid Selvidge, Furry Lewis and Dickinson&#x27;s band, Mud Boy and the Neutrons.

Dickinson contributed production and instrumentation to various recordings released on the underground Memphis Tennessee record label Barbarian Records.

As a session musician, he played tack piano with the Rolling Stones for their recording of &quot;Wild Horses&quot; at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in December 1969; contributed to the Flamin&#x27; Groovies&#x27; album &quot;Teenage Head&quot; in 1971; worked with Ry Cooder on nearly a dozen records beginning in 1972; recorded a one-off single (&quot;Red Headed Woman&quot;) with the Cramps in 1984. Dickinson played electric piano and pump organ on Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;. Also in 1997, Dickinson produced &quot;Ya Gotta Let Me Do My Thing&quot; by the Australian band Kim Salmon &amp; the Surrealists. In 1998, he produced Mudhoney&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow Hit Today&quot;.

In May 1999, Dickinson participated in a one-time collaboration with Jules Shear, Harvey Brooks, Paul Q. Kolderie, Chuck Prophet, Sean Slade, and Winston Watson to record the album &quot;Raisins in the Sun&quot;, released by Rounder Records in 2001.

His sons, Luther and Cody, who played on his 2002 solo album &quot;Free Beer Tomorrow&quot; and the 2006 album &quot;Jungle Jim and the Voodoo Tiger&quot;, have achieved success on their own as the North Mississippi Allstars.

Dickinson also made a recording with Pete (Sonic Boom) Kember of Spacemen 3. &quot;Indian Giver&quot; was released in 2008 by Birdman Records under the name of Spectrum Meets Captain Memphis, with Captain Memphis, obviously, referring to Dickinson.

In 2003, Dickinson briefly appeared in &quot;The Road to Memphis&quot;, part of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s television production &quot;The Blues&quot;.

&quot;Free Beer Tomorrow&quot; (2002) was an album of covers. It included “The Ballad of Billy and Oscar,” by renegade art critic Dave Hickey, and “Hungry Town,” written by Green on Red alumnus / former Dickinson protégé Chuck Prophet, along with Prophet’s main songwriting partner, klipschutz (pen name of Kurt Lipschutz). Prophet and klipschutz were amused but not disappointed that Dickinson changed some of the lyrics, according to an interview with Prophet. In the same interview, Prophet mentioned that his writing partner was credited on the disc as “klipshitz,” probably due to Dickinson’s poor handwriting.

In 2007 Dickinson played with the Memphis-based rock band Snake Eyes. The band, formed by the Memphis musician Greg Roberson (previously the drummer for Reigning Sound), also included Jeremy Scott (also from Reigning Sound), Adam Woodard, and John Paul Keith. The group disbanded in October 2008. Dickinson and Roberson went on to form another Memphis group, Ten High &amp; the Trashed Romeos, with Jake and Toby Vest (of the Memphis band the Bulletproof Vests) and Adam Hill. The band recorded two albums, the first consisting of original compositions by Dickinson and the band, and the second consisting of cover versions of songs originally recorded by Memphis garage rock bands in the 1960s.

==Death==

Dickinson died August 15, 2009, at Methodist Extended Care Hospital in Memphis, following triple-bypass heart surgery.

<doc id="727800" wikidata="Q5447174" url="?curid=727800" title="Fielding H. Yost">
<text>Fielding Harris Yost (; April 30, 1871 – August 20, 1946) was an American college football player, coach and athletics administrator. He served as the head football coach at: Ohio Wesleyan University, the University of Nebraska, the University of Kansas, Stanford University, San Jose State University, and the University of Michigan, compiling a coaching career record of 198–35–12. During his 25 seasons as the head football coach at Ann Arbor, Yost&#x27;s Michigan Wolverines won six national championships, captured ten Big Ten Conference titles, and amassed a record of 165–29–10.

From 1901 to 1905, his &quot;Point-a-Minute&quot; squads had a record of 55–1–1, outscoring their opponents by a margin of 2,821–42. The 1901 team beat Stanford, 49–0, in the 1902 Rose Bowl, the first college football bowl game. Under Yost, Michigan won four straight national championships from 1901 to 1904 and two more in 1918 and 1923.

In 1921, Yost became Michigan&#x27;s athletic director and served in that capacity until 1940. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1951. Yost was also a successful business person, lawyer, and author; but he is best known as a leading figure in pioneering the development of college football into a national phenomenon.

==Early life==
Yost was born in Fairview, West Virginia, in April 1871. Yost&#x27;s family had settled in West Virginia, in 1825. He was the oldest of four children of Parmenus (sometimes Permenus) Wesley Yost (1845–1920) and Elzena Jane (Ammons) Yost (1852–1943), both natives of West Virginia. His father was a farmer and a Confederate veteran. His family had been in Fairview since 1825 when his second great grandfather, David Yost, settled there and took up a grant of over 2,000 acres.

Yost was educated in the local schools and became a deputy marshal in Fairview as a teenager. At seventeen, he earned a public-school teaching certificate.

==College==
Yost began his college education at Fairmont Normal School in Fairmont, West Virginia. He then taught school at Patterson Creek, West Virginia, during the 1889–90 school year.

He next enrolled at the Ohio Normal School (now known as Ohio Northern University). Yost played for the Ohio Normal baseball team. After three years at Ohio Normal, he returned to West Virginia to work in the oil fields.

In 1895, Yost enrolled at West Virginia University where he studied law, earning an LL.B. He also played football for the West Virginia University football team. A 6-foot, 200 pounder, Yost was a standout at tackle at West Virginia into the 1896 season.

===&quot;If you can&#x27;t beat &#x27;em, join &#x27;em.&quot;===

In October 1896, after his team lost three home games to Lafayette, played on three different fields over the course of three days, Yost became a remarkable personification of &quot;If you can&#x27;t beat &#x27;em, join &#x27;em.&quot; He transferred in mid-season to join Coach Parke H. Davis&#x27;s national championship team at Lafayette. Just a week after playing &quot;against&quot; Davis in West Virginia, Yost was playing &quot;for&quot; Davis in Lafayette&#x27;s historic 6–4 win over the Penn Quakers.

The fortuitous timing of his appearance on the Lafayette roster did not go unnoticed by Penn officials. They called it &quot;the Yost affair.&quot; The Philadelphia &quot;Ledger&quot; quoted Yost as saying that he came to Lafayette only to play football. The fact that he appeared in a Lafayette uniform only once, in the Penn game, and that he returned to West Virginia within two weeks of the contest did not help appearances. He assured all concerned that he would return to Lafayette for at least three years of study.

==Coaching career==

===Ohio Wesleyan===
Yost began his coaching career at age 26 as head coach of the 1897 Ohio Wesleyan football team. Yost&#x27;s team compiled a 7–1–1 record, shut out six of its nine opponents (including a 6–0 victory over Ohio State and a scoreless tie with Michigan), and outscored all opponents by a total of 144 to 32. Yost played at left tackle against Michigan, leading to a protest that Ohio Wesleyan had assured Michigan that Yost, a paid coach and non-student, would not play and had engaged in trickery by introducing another individual as Yost. One week later, Michigan announced that it would no longer schedule games against Ohio Wesleyan.

===Nebraska===
In 1898, Yost was hired to coach the Nebraska football team with compensation of $1,000 for 10 weeks of service. The 1898 Nebraska team compiled an 8–3 record, including victories over Iowa State (23–10), Missouri (47–6), Kansas (18–6), and Colorado (23–10), and losses to Drake (6–5) and Iowa (6–5).

===Kansas===
In June 1899, the University of Kansas Athletic Association offered Yost $350, and an additional $150 conditionally, to coach the school&#x27;s football team. After spending the summer in Colorado, Yost arrived in Lawrence, Kansas, on September 4, 1899. During the 1899 season, the Kansas football team &quot;lived separate from the rest of the students and ate specially selected and prepared food . . . with Coach Yost as their only mentor&quot;. The team compiled an undefeated 10–0 record, outscoring opponents 280–37. The season included victories over the Haskell Indians (12–0 and 18–0), Nebraska (36–20), and Missouri (34–6). During the 1899–1900 academic year, Kansas had Yost as its football coach and James Naismith as its basketball coach. Naismith also served as an assistant football coach during the 1899 season.

===Stanford===
In May 1900, Yost was hired as the football coach at Stanford University, and, after traveling home to West Virginia, he arrived in Palo Alto, California, on August 21, 1900. Yost led the 1900 Stanford team to a 7–2–1, outscoring opponents 154–20.

===Michigan===
After first applying at Illinois, Yost was hired in 1901 by Charles A. Baird as the head football coach for the Michigan Wolverines football team.

Yost coached at Michigan from 1901 through 1923, and again in 1925 and 1926. He was highly successful at Michigan, winning 165 games, losing only 29, and tying 10 for a winning percentage of .833. Under Yost, Michigan won four straight national championships from 1901 to 1904 and two more in 1918 and 1923.

====Point-a-minute====

Yost&#x27;s first Michigan team in 1901 outscored its opposition by a margin of 550–0 en route to a perfect season and victory in the inaugural Rose Bowl on January 1, 1902, over Stanford, the team Yost had coached the year before. From 1901 to 1904, Michigan did not lose a game, and was tied only once in a legendary game with the Minnesota Golden Gophers that led to the establishment of the Little Brown Jug trophy. Yost&#x27;s teams used the short punt formation. He also developed a play called &quot;Old 83&quot; resembling an option.

Before Michigan finally lost a game to Amos Alonzo Stagg&#x27;s Chicago Maroons squad at the end of the 1905 season, they had gone 56 straight games without a defeat, the second longest such streak in college football history. During their first five seasons under Yost, Michigan outscored its opponents 2,821–42, earning the Michigan team the nickname &quot;Point-a-Minute.&quot; The team featured running back Willie Heston, who Yost called the greatest player he ever saw.

In 1904, Germany Schulz stood up from the center position and created the position of linebacker. Yost was horrified at first, but came to see the wisdom in Schulz&#x27;s innovation.

====Independent====
In 1908, Michigan lost to Penn 29–0, the worst defeat suffered by a Michigan team during the Yost era. Yost said of Schulz&#x27;s performance: &quot;He gave the greatest one-man exhibition of courage I ever saw on a football field.&quot;

In 1909, Michigan suffered its first loss to Notre Dame. In 1910, Michigan was led by All-Americans Albert Benbrook and Stanfield Wells and played its only undefeated season of the independent years, compiling a 3–0–3 record.

In 1916, John Maulbetsch led Michigan to one of its finest records. The Wolverines won seven straight games.

====Return to Western Conference====

Led by fullback Frank Steketee, the 1918 team went undefeated in the war-shortened season. The 1922 and 1923 teams went undefeated, led by punter Harry Kipke. The only blemish was a tie with Yost protege and brother-in-law Dan McGugin&#x27;s Vanderbilt.

At the end of the season, Yost called the 1925 Michigan team &quot;the greatest football team I ever coached&quot; and &quot;the greatest football team I ever saw in action&quot;. The team featured quarterback Benny Friedman and left end Bennie Oosterbaan, sometimes referred to as &quot;The Benny-to-Bennie Show&quot;.

In tribute to the school where Yost began his coaching career, he arranged for Michigan to play its first game at Ferry Field (September 30, 1905) and its first game at Michigan Stadium (October 1, 1927) against Ohio Wesleyan.

==Athletic director==
After retiring from coaching, Yost remained at Michigan as the school&#x27;s athletic director, a position he held until 1940, then held the title of athletic director emeritus. Under his leadership, Michigan Stadium, Yost Fieldhouse (now Yost Ice Arena), and the university&#x27;s golf course were constructed.

==Later years and death==
Yost was in poor health for several years before his death and was hospitalized at the Battle Creek Sanitarium in May 1946. He reportedly suffered from a stroke, but was released after two weeks and returned to his home in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In August 1946, Yost died of a gall bladder attack at his home. He was survived by his wife, whom he had married in 1906, a son, Fielding H. Yost, Jr., two brothers, Ellis and Nicholas, and a sister, Mrs. Charles Barry. Yost was buried at Ann Arbor&#x27;s Forest Hill Cemetery near the University of Michigan campus.

==Personal==
A native of West Virginia, Yost&#x27;s unusual pronunciation of the school&#x27;s name, &quot;MEE-she-gan,&quot; copied by long-time Michigan football broadcaster Bob Ufer, is affectionately carried on by many Michigan football fans and often referenced by ESPN sportscaster Chris Fowler.

A devout Christian, he was among the first coaches to allow Jewish players on his teams, including Joe Magidsohn and Benny Friedman. However, Murray Sperber&#x27;s book &quot;Shake Down the Thunder&quot; places principal responsibility for the Big Ten blackballing and boycotting of Notre Dame on Yost. It also claims this was motivated by anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant prejudice common in the early 20th century, though John Kyrk&#x27;s book &quot;Natural Enemies&quot; points out that there was a bitter feud between Yost and Knute Rockne, head coach of the Notre Dame football team.

==Legacy==
Yost had a profound impact on the Michigan athletics department. &quot;No other man has ever given as much heart, soul, brains, and tongue to the game he loved—football&quot; said Grantland Rice. A longtime football coach and athletic director, his career was marked with achievement. Yost was among the inaugural class of inductees to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951.

Tommy Hughitt was heavily inspired by Yost&#x27;s system and used it to great success, later adapting it to the professional game with the Youngstown Patricians and Buffalo All-Americans.

===Innovation===

Yost invented the position of linebacker with center Germany Schulz; co-created the first ever bowl game, the 1902 Rose Bowl, with then legendary UM athletic director Charles Baird; invented the fieldhouse concept that bears his name; and supervised the building of the first on-campus building dedicated to intramural sports.

====Hurry up====
Yost was also known for a series of admonitions to his players beginning with the words, &quot;Hurry up,&quot; for example, &quot;Hurry up and be the first man down the field on a punt or kick-off.&quot; This inclination earned him the nickname, &quot;Hurry up&quot; Yost. He was also an innovator of the hurry up offense.

====Professional coach====
Yost initiated the concept of coaching as an actual profession near the turn of the century when he was paid as much as a UM professor. The professionalization of coaches that started with Yost and later, Walter Camp at Yale University, symbolized how serious college football was becoming, and Yost symbolized this more so than any of his peers. It was he who first articulated the now accepted premise about student-athletes in the sport that: &quot;Football builds character.&quot;

===Coaching tree===
No fewer than 77 men who either played for Yost, or coached under him as an assistant, went on to become head coaches in college football; two, Benny Friedman and Tommy Hughitt, helmed teams in the National Football League (NFL). In addition Dan A. Killian, who was the head coach for the LSU Tigers (1904–1906), reportedly played quarterback on the Michigan football team under Yost, but if he did, he apparently did not qualify for a letter and is not listed below.

<text>An engram is a unit of cognitive information imprinted in a physical substance, theorized to be the means by which memories are stored as biophysical or biochemical changes in the brain or other biological tissue, in response to external stimuli.

Demonstrating the existence of, and the exact mechanism and location of, neurologically defined engrams has been a focus of persistent research for many decades.

== History ==
The term &quot;engram&quot; was coined by memory researcher Richard Semon in reference to the physical substrate of memory in the organism. Semon warned, however: &quot;In animals, during the evolutionary process, one organic system—the nervous system—has become specialised for the reception and transmission of stimuli. No monopoly of this function by the nervous system, however, can be deduced from this specialisation, not even in its highest state of evolution, as in Man.&quot; One of the first ventures on identifying the location of a memory in the brain was undertaken by Karl S. Lashley who removed portions of the brain in rodents. In Lashley&#x27;s experiments, rats were trained to run through a maze and then tissue was removed from their cerebral cortex. Increasing the amount of tissue removed increased the degradation of memory, but more remarkably, &quot;where&quot; the tissue was removed from made no difference. His search thus proved unsuccessful, and his conclusion – that memory is diffusely distributed in the brain – became widely influential. However, today we appreciate that memory is not completely but only &quot;largely&quot; distributed in the brain; this, together with its dynamic nature, makes engrams challenging to identify, or prove that they exist, using traditional scientific methods.

Later, David A. McCormick and Richard F. Thompson sought the engram in the cerebellum, rather than the cerebral cortex. They used classical conditioning of the eyelid response in rabbits in search of the engram. They puffed air upon the cornea of the eye and paired it with a tone. After a number of experiences associating it with a tone, the rabbits became conditioned to blink when they heard the tone even without a puff. One region that David A. McCormick studied was the lateral interpositus nucleus (LIP). He found that recordings of neurons in this nucleus revealed activity that mirrored the learning, stimulation of the nucleus elicited the learned response, and lesion of this brain region abolished the response. Other members of the Thompson group found that when the interpositus nucleus was deactivated chemically, the conditioned response disappeared; when re-activated, they responded again, demonstrating that the LIP is a key element of the engram for this response. This approach, targeting the cerebellum, though successful, examines only basic, automatic responses, which virtually all animals possess. However, engrams of specific types of memory are found in the subsystems mediating that learning process and as such solely engrams of simple conditioning are associated with the LIP but not, for instance, engrams of semantic memory .

==Overview==
Neuroscience acknowledges the existence of many types of memory and their physical location within the brain is likely to be dependent on the respective system mediating the encoding of this memory. Such brain parts as the cerebellum, striatum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala are thought to play an important role in memory. For example, the hippocampus is believed to be involved in spatial and declarative memory, as well as consolidating short-term into long-term memory.

Studies have shown that declarative memories move between the limbic system, deep within the brain, and the outer, cortical regions. These are distinct from the mechanisms of the more primitive cerebellum, which dominates in the blinking response and receives the input of auditory information directly. It does not need to &quot;reach out&quot; to other brain structures for assistance in forming some memories of simple association.

An MIT study found that behavior based on high-level cognition, such as the expression of a specific memory, can be generated in a mammal by highly specific physical activation of a specific small subpopulation of brain cells. By reactivating these cells by physical means in mice, such as shining light on neurons affected by optogenetics, a long-term fear-related memory appears to be recalled.

Another study used optogenetics and chemogenetics to control neuronal activity in animals encoding and recalling the memory of a spatial context to investigate how the brain determines the lifetime of memories. The results found by the researchers have defined a role for specific hippocampal inhibitory cells (somatostatin expressing cells) in restricting the number of neurons involved in the storage of spatial information and limiting the duration of the associated memory.

In 2016, an MIT study found that memory loss in early stages of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease could be reversed by strengthening specific memory engram cell connections in the brains of Alzheimer mouse models.

<doc id="727810" wikidata="Q4611891" url="?curid=727810" title="Association football positions">
<text>In the sport of association football, each of the 11 players on a team is assigned to a particular position on the field of play. A team is made up of one goalkeeper and ten outfield players who fill various defensive, midfield, and attacking positions depending on the formation deployed. These positions describe both the player&#x27;s main role and their area of operation on the pitch.

In the early development of the game, formations were much more offensively aggressive, with the 1–2–7 being prominent in the late 1800s. In the latter part of the 19th century, the 2–3–5 formation became widely used and the position names became more refined to reflect this. In defence, there were full-backs, known as the left-back and right-back; in midfield, left-half, centre-half and right-half; and for the forward line there were outside-left (or left wing), inside-left, centre-forward, inside-right and outside-right (or right wing). As the game has evolved, tactics and team formations have changed and so many of the names of the positions have changed to reflect their duties in the modern game (though some old familiar ones remain). The term &quot;half-back&quot; fell out of use by the early 1970s and &quot;midfield&quot; was used in naming the positions that play around the middle third as in centre midfield and wide midfield.

The fluid nature of the modern game means that positions in football are not as rigidly defined as in sports such as rugby or American football. Even so, most players will play in a limited range of positions throughout their career, as each position requires a particular set of skills and physical attributes. Footballers who are able to play comfortably in a number of positions are referred to as &quot;utility players&quot;.

However, in Total Football tactics, the players are only loosely defined into a position. This tactic required players who were extremely versatile, such as Johan Cruyff, who could play every position on the pitch apart from goalkeeper.
==Goalkeeper==

Goalkeeper is the most defensive position in football. The goalkeeper&#x27;s main job is to stop the other team from scoring by catching, palming or punching the ball from shots, headers and crosses. Unlike their teammates, goalkeepers typically remain in and around their own penalty area for most of the game. As a result, goalkeepers have a better view of the pitch and often give advice to their defence when the other team is on the attack or during set pieces. Goalkeepers are the only players on the pitch who are allowed to handle the ball, but this is restricted to their own penalty area. Positioning is another important job and is one of the hardest to master as keeper.

Goalkeepers must also wear a different coloured kit from the outfielders and officials. Common colours include yellow, green, grey, black and shades of blue. Since the 1970s, goalkeepers have also typically worn specialised gloves. They provide better grip on the ball and protect their hands from hard shots and headers, as well making it easier to punch or push the ball away. Caps were common between the 1910s and 1960s, as well as woolly jumpers, but these are not worn in any professional or semi-professional context today.

Unlike other positions, the goalkeeper is the only required role in a football match. If a goalkeeper gets sent off or injured, a substitute goalkeeper must take their place in goal. If that is not possible, an outfielder must do so and wear the goalkeeper&#x27;s shirt. This happened in the 2023 NWSL Championship final, when goalkeeper Mandy Haught was sent off with a red card, and her team already reached the limit of substitutions, causing midfielder Nealy Martin to take her place as goalkeeper.

===Sweeper-keeper===
With the advent of the offside rule, the role of a sweeping defender has largely become obsolete. However, in the last decades it has become popular for goalkeepers to take on that role instead. A sweeping goalkeeper is good at reading the game, and prevents scoring opportunities by coming off their line to challenge and/or distract opposing forwards who have beaten the offside trap. Manuel Neuer has often been described as a sweeper-keeper.

==Defender==
Defenders play behind the midfielders and their primary responsibility is to provide support to the team and to prevent the opposition from scoring a goal. They usually remain in the half of the field that contains the goal they are defending. Taller defenders will move forward to the opposing team&#x27;s penalty box when their team takes corner kicks or free kicks, where scoring with one&#x27;s head is a possibility.

===Centre-back===
The principal role of the centre-back, (or central defender) (historically called a centre-half) is to block the opponent&#x27;s players from scoring, and safely clearing the ball from the defensive half&#x27;s penalty area. As their name suggests, they play in a central position. Most teams employ two centre-backs, stationed in front of the goalkeeper. There are two main defensive strategies used by centre-backs: the zonal defence, where each centre-back covers a specific area of the pitch, and man-to-man marking, where each centre-back has the job of covering a particular opposition player.

Centre-backs are often tall, strong and have good jumping, heading and tackling ability. Successful centre-backs also need to be able to concentrate, read the game well, and be brave and decisive in making last-ditch tackles on attacking players who might otherwise be through on goal. Sometimes, particularly in lower leagues, centre-backs concentrate less on ball control and passing, preferring simply to clear the ball in a &quot;safety-first&quot; fashion. However, there is a long tradition of centre-backs having more than just rudimentary footballing skill, enabling a more possession-oriented playing style.

Centre-backs will usually go forward for set piece corners and free-kicks, where their height and jumping ability give them an aerial goal threat, while defensive duties are covered by the full-backs. Once the set piece is complete, they will retreat to their own half.

The position is sometimes referred to as &quot;centre-half&quot;. This originates in the late part of the 19th century, when most teams employed the 2–3–5 formation, the row of three players were called &quot;half-backs&quot;. As formations evolved, the central player in this trio (the centre-half), moved into a more defensive position on the field, taking the name of the position with them.

===Sweeper===
The sweeper (or &quot;libero&quot; ()) is a more versatile type of centre-back that, as the name suggests, &quot;sweeps up&quot; the ball if the opponent manages to breach the defensive line. Their position is rather more fluid than other defenders who mark their designated opponents. The sweeper&#x27;s ability to read the game is even more vital than for a centre-back. The catenaccio system of play, used in Italian football in the 1960s, notably employed a defensive libero. With the advent of the modern offside rule came the need to hold more of a defensive line to catch opposing players offside. Use of a sweeper role became less popular as the last man can play an attacking opponent onside, which could in the case of the sweeper be behind the main defence. Nowadays, the position is commonly taught in American and Italian youth football, with most teams elsewhere never playing the position. 

Former German captain Franz Beckenbauer is commonly seen as the inventor of the libero and the best player in the role. However, players such as Velibor Vasović and Armando Picchi were prominent sweepers prior to Beckenbauer. Some of the greatest sweepers were Gaetano Scirea, Bobby Moore, Franco Baresi, Daniel Passarella and Lothar Matthäus.

===Full-back===
The left-back and the right-back (generally referred to as the full-backs) are the defenders stationed at either side of the centre-backs to provide protection from attacking wide players. They often have to defend against the opponent&#x27;s wingers, who will try to take the ball past them down the flanks in order to cross or pass into the penalty area to their attackers. Full-backs traditionally do not go up to support the attack but may move up as far as the halfway line depending on the defensive line being held. In the modern game, there has been the tendency to prefer the use of the attacking full-back (wing-back) role though they are more often than not still referred to as right- or left-backs.

Originally, a full-back was the last line of defence, but as the game developed in the early 20th century, the centre-half role was dropped backwards and came to be known as &#x27;centre-back&#x27;, and the full-backs were then pushed out wider to create the right-back and left-back positions.

===Wing-back===
The wing-backs (or attacking full-backs) are defenders with a more advanced emphasis on attack. The name is a portmanteau of &quot;winger&quot; and &quot;full-back&quot;, indicating greater emphasis on their responsibilities in attack. They are usually employed as part of a 3–5–2 formation, and can therefore be considered part of the midfield when a team is attacking. They may also be used in a 5–3–2 formation and therefore have a more defensive role. The term &quot;wing-back&quot; itself is gradually falling out of use as there is less of a distinction with the full-back roles in the modern game, especially when used in a 4–3–3 or 4–2–3–1 formation.

The wing-back role is one of the most physically demanding positions in modern football. Wing-backs are often more adventurous than traditional full-backs and are expected to provide width, especially in teams without wingers. A wing-back needs to be of exceptional stamina, be able to provide crosses upfield and then defend effectively against an opponent&#x27;s attack down the flanks. A defensive midfielder is usually fielded to cover the advances of an opponent&#x27;s wing-back.

==Midfielder==
Midfielders (originally called half-backs) are players whose position of play is midway between the attacking forwards and the defenders. Their main duties are to maintain possession of the ball, receiving the ball from defenders and feeding it to the strikers, as well as dispossessing opposing players. Most managers field at least one central midfielder with a marked task of breaking up opposition&#x27;s attacks while the rest are more adept to creating goals or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence. Midfielders can be expected to cover many areas of a pitch, as at times they can be called back into defence or required to attack with the strikers. They are more often the players that initiate attacking play for a team.

===Central midfielder===
The central midfielder provides a link between defence and attack, fulfilling a number of duties and operating primarily in the middle third of the pitch. They will support their team&#x27;s attacking play and endeavour to win the ball back on defense. A central midfielder is often an important initiator of attacks and can be sometimes described as a &quot;playmaker.&quot; They will also offer an additional line of defence when the team is under sustained attack and when defending set pieces. Central midfielders are always busy in a game and are therefore sometimes described as the engine room of the team.

Their central position enables them to have an all-round view of the match. Since most of the action takes place in and around their area of the pitch, midfielders often exert the greatest degree of control over how a match is played. It is often said that a match is won or lost in midfield, meaning that whichever team dominates the middle area of the pitch is able to dictate the game. A central midfielder is expected to have good vision, be adept at long and short passing and have great stamina because of the ground they cover in a game. They also need to be good at tackling to win the ball back.

Over time two additional central midfield roles have developed from the standard role, though their duties have a degree of overlap. These are the attacking midfield and defensive midfield roles and are explained in the sections below. Depending on the team&#x27;s tactics a combination of all three roles may be deployed in midfield. Sometimes a central midfielder will be used in a wide midfield role to provide width or as cover.

===Defensive midfielder===

A defensive midfielder (holding midfielder or midfield anchor) is a central midfielder who is stationed in front of the defenders to provide more defensive protection, thus &quot;holding back&quot; when the rest of the midfield supports the attack. The defensive midfielder screens the defence by harrying and tackling the opposition teams&#x27; attackers and defenders. They also help tactically, for instance, by directing opposing attacking players out to the wing where they have more limited influence, and by covering the positions of full-backs, other midfielders and even the centre-backs if they charge up to support the attack.

Although the duties of defensive midfielders are primarily defensive, some midfielders are deployed as deep-lying playmakers, due to their ability to dictate tempo from a deep position with their passing. Sometimes a defensive midfielder will be paired with a central midfielder who will act as the deep-lying playmaker. Whenever the central midfielder ventures forward the defensive midfielder will hold back.

Defensive midfielders require good positional sense, work rate, tackling ability, and anticipation (of player and ball movement) to excel. They also need to possess good passing skills and close control to hold the ball in midfield under sustained pressure. Most importantly, defensive midfielders require great stamina as they are the outfield players who cover the greatest distance during a professional match. In top football clubs, a midfielder may cover up to 12 kilometres for a full 90-minute game. Deep-lying playmakers typically require a good first touch under opposition pressure and the ability to play long crossfield passes to attacking players further upfield.

===Attacking midfielder===

An attacking midfielder is a midfield player who is positioned in an advanced midfield position, usually between central midfield and the team&#x27;s forwards, and who has a primarily offensive role.

According to positioning along the field, attacking midfield may be divided into &quot;left, right&quot; and &quot;central attacking midfield&quot; roles. A central attacking midfielder may be referred to as a &quot;playmaker&quot;, or &quot;number ten&quot; (due to the association of the number 10 shirt with this position).

These players typically serve as the offensive pivot of the team, and are sometimes said to be &quot;playing in the hole&quot;, although this term can also be used to describe the positioning of a deep-lying forward. Their main role is to create goal-scoring opportunities using superior vision, control, and technical skill. The attacking midfielder is an important position that requires the player to possess superior technical abilities in terms of passing and, perhaps more importantly, the ability to read the opposing defence in order to deliver defence-splitting passes to the strikers; in addition to their technical and creative ability, they are also usually quick, agile, and mobile players, which aids them in beating opponents during dribbling runs.

Some attacking midfielders are called &quot;trequartistas&quot; or &quot;fantasisti&quot; (, i.e. a playmaker between the forwards and the midfield), known for their deft touch, vision, ability to shoot from range, and passing prowess. However, not all attacking midfielders are trequartistas – some attacking midfielders are very vertical and are essentially auxiliary attackers, i.e. secondary striker. In Brazil, the offensive playmaker is known as the &quot;meia atacante&quot;, whereas in Argentina, it is known as the &quot;enganche&quot;.

===Wide midfielder===

A wide midfielder (left midfield and right midfield, or generally side midfielder) (historically called left-half and right-half, or wing-half) is a midfielder who is stationed to the left or right of central midfield. Though they are often referred to as wingers, not all players in these positions are stereotypical speedy, touchline hugging players. With the advent of the modern game the traditional outside forwards known as &quot;wingers&quot; were pushed back to wide midfield, though still commonly referred to as wingers. As the game has developed further, some tactical formations (for example, 4–3–3) have used central midfielders deployed in a wider position to provide width, more defensive protection along the flanks and to help compress play in the opponent&#x27;s half. They will still support attacking play and sometimes be expected to act as a semi-winger.

==Forward==
Forwards (or strikers) are players who are positioned nearest to the opposing team&#x27;s goal. The primary responsibility of forwards is to score goals and to create scoring chances for other players. Forwards may also contribute defensively by harrying opposition defenders and goalkeepers whilst not in possession. The most common modern formations include between one and three forwards; for example, a lone striker in a 4–2–3–1, paired strikers in a 4–4–2 or a striker and two wingers in a 4–3–3.

Coaches will often field one striker who plays on the shoulder of the last opposing defender and another attacking forward who plays somewhat deeper and assists in creating goals as well as scoring. The former is sometimes a large striker, typically known as a &quot;target man&quot;, who is used either to distract opposing defenders to help teammates score, or to score themselves; the latter is usually of quicker pace, and is required to have some abilities like finding holes in the opposing defence and, sometimes, dribbling. In other cases, strikers will operate on the wings of the field and work their way goalwards. Yet another variation is the replacement of the target man with a striker who can thread through-balls.

Players who specialise in playing as a target are usually of above-average height with good heading ability and an accurate shot. They tend to be the &quot;outlet&quot; player for both midfielders and defenders, able to &quot;hold the ball up&quot; (retain possession of the ball in an advanced position while teammates run forward to join the attack). They tend to score goals from crosses, often with the head, and can use their body strength to shield the ball while turning to score.

Other forwards may rely on their pace to run onto long balls passed over or through the opposition defence, rather than collecting the ball with their back to goal like a target man. Some forwards can play both of these roles equally well.

===Second striker===
The second striker has a long history in the game, but the terminology to describe them has varied over the years. Originally such players were termed inside forwards. More recently, the preferred terms have been second striker, support striker, deep-lying forward, shadow striker, or withdrawn striker, and are often referred to as playing &quot;in the hole&quot; (i.e. the space between the midfield and the defence of the opposing team). Second strikers tend not to be as tall or as physically imposing as a centre forward. They are required to be more &quot;nippy&quot;, quick, mobile, and skillful, helping to create goals and scoring opportunities for centre forwards, utilising spaces created in the opposition&#x27;s defence to provide passes to the strikers, picking up loose balls around the area, or attempting to dribble with the ball and score themselves.

The position was initially developed by the famous Hungary national team of the late 1940s and mid-1950s led by Ferenc Puskás. Later, it was popularised in Italian football as the &quot;trequartista&quot; (&quot;three-quarters&quot;) or &quot;fantasista&quot;, the advanced playmaker who plays neither in midfield nor as a forward, but effectively pulls the strings for their team&#x27;s attack, and serves as an assist provider. Many players in this position can play in a free role, as an attacking midfielder or sometimes on the wing. The position has also been known as the number 10 role, as many players who played in this position wore the number 10 jersey.

Whatever the terminology, the position itself is a loosely defined one, a player who lies somewhere between the out-and-out striker and the midfield, who can perform this role effectively due to their vision, technical skills, creativity, and passing ability. Such a player is either a skillful, attack-minded midfielder or a creative striker who can both score and create opportunities for centre forwards, although a second striker will often not be involved in build-up plays as much as an attacking midfielder. As the supporting forward role was popularised in Italy due to free-role attacking midfielders adapting to a more advanced position in the tactically rigorous 4–4–2 formations of the 1990s, their defensive contribution is also usually higher than that of a pure number ten playmaker. In Italy, this role is also known as a &quot;rifinitore&quot; or &quot;seconda punta&quot;, whereas in Brazil, it is known as a &quot;ponte de lança&quot;.

===Centre forward===
A centre forward has the key task of scoring goals and for this reason acts as the focal point of the majority of attacking play by a team. As such, how well a striker is performing tends to be measured purely on goals scored despite the fact that they may be contributing in other ways to a team&#x27;s success. A traditional centre forward was required to be tall in height and strong physically in order to be able to win the ball in the area from crosses and attempt to score with either their feet or head, or to knock the ball down for a teammate to score. Whilst these assets are still an advantage, in the modern game speed and movement are also required as there is more interplay when attacking. In a 4–4–2 or 4–4–1–1 formation the centre forward is often paired with a second striker who may play around them or in a slightly withdrawn role respectively, though it is not unknown to play two recognised centre forwards.

Sometimes a team may opt on a more defensive formation such as 4–5–1 in which the centre forward is required to play a &quot;lone role&quot; up front. In these cases a team may look for opportunities to counter-attack on the break and the centre forward may find themselves attacking the goal on their own with just a defender to beat or alternatively they may hold the ball up in the opponent&#x27;s half to allow other players to join in the attack. Modern footballing tactics have made more use of 4–3–3 and 4–2–3–1 formations. Here the centre forward may be involved more with the attacking build up play, supported by wingers (who often come infield) and attacking midfielders. The play uses more shorter, quick passes with movement off the ball, looking to create an opening on goal.

===Winger===

A winger (left winger and right winger) (historically called outside-left and outside-right, or outside forward) is an attacking player who is stationed in a wide position near the touchlines. They can be classified as forwards, considering their origin as the old outside forward who played out on the &quot;wing&quot; (i.e. side of the pitch). They continue to be termed as such in many parts of the world, especially in Latin and Dutch footballing cultures. However, in the English-speaking world, they are usually counted as part of the midfield having been pushed back there with the advent of the 4–4–2 formation which gradually rose to prominence in the 1960s, given the role&#x27;s additional defensive duties. A winger&#x27;s main attribute is usually speed which is used to attack and dribble past opponent&#x27;s full-backs in order to get behind the defence and to then deliver crosses and passes into the centre for their attackers. Occasionally left and right footed wingers may swap sides of the field as a tactical move to enable the winger to cut inside against the opposing full-back&#x27;s weaker foot, looking for a shooting opportunity or just as a means of opening up the defence. Clubs such as Barcelona and Real Madrid often choose to play their wingers on the &#x27;wrong&#x27; flank for this reason.

Although wingers are a familiar part of football, the use of wingers is by no means universal, and many successful teams have operated without wingers. At the 1966 World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey led a team without natural wingers to the title; this was unusual enough at the time for the team to be nicknamed &quot;The Wingless Wonders&quot;. A more recent example is that of Italian club Milan, who have typically played in a narrow midfield diamond formation or in a &quot;Christmas tree&quot; formation (4–3–2–1), relying on attacking full-backs to provide the necessary width down the wings.

<doc id="727811" wikidata="Q6470127" url="?curid=727811" title="Snark (graph theory)">
<text>In the mathematical field of graph theory, a snark is an undirected graph with exactly three edges per vertex whose edges cannot be colored with only three colors. In order to avoid trivial cases, snarks are often restricted to have additional requirements on their connectivity and on the length of their cycles. Infinitely many snarks exist.

One of the equivalent forms of the four color theorem is that every snark is a non-planar graph. Research on snarks originated in Peter G. Tait&#x27;s work on the four color theorem in 1880, but their name is much newer, given to them by Martin Gardner in 1976. Beyond coloring, snarks also have connections to other hard problems in graph theory: writing in the &quot;Electronic Journal of Combinatorics&quot;, Miroslav Chladný and Martin Škoviera state that

As well as the problems they mention, W. T. Tutte&#x27;s &quot;snark conjecture&quot; concerns the existence of Petersen graphs as graph minors of snarks; its proof has been long announced but remains unpublished, and would settle a special case of the existence of nowhere zero 4-flows.

==History and examples==
Snarks were so named by the American mathematician Martin Gardner in 1976, after the mysterious and elusive object of the poem &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; by Lewis Carroll. However, the study of this class of graphs is significantly older than their name. Peter G. Tait initiated the study of snarks in 1880, when he proved that the four color theorem is equivalent to the statement that no snark is planar. The first graph known to be a snark was the Petersen graph; it was proved to be a snark by Julius Petersen in 1898, although it had already been studied for a different purpose by Alfred Kempe in 1886.

The next four known snarks were
*the Blanuša snarks (two with 18 vertices), discovered by Danilo Blanuša in 1946,
*the Descartes snark (210 vertices), discovered by Bill Tutte in 1948, and
*the Szekeres snark (50 vertices), discovered by George Szekeres in 1973.
In 1975, Rufus Isaacs generalized Blanuša&#x27;s method to construct two infinite families of snarks: the flower snarks and the Blanuša–Descartes–Szekeres snarks, a family that includes the two Blanuša snarks, the Descartes snark and the Szekeres snark. Isaacs also discovered a 30-vertex snark that does not belong to the Blanuša–Descartes–Szekeres family and that is not a flower snark: the double-star snark. Another infinite family, the Loupekine snarks, was published by Isaacs in 1976, credited to F. Loupekine. It includes two 22-vertex snarks derived from the Petersen graph.
The 50-vertex Watkins snark was discovered in 1989.

Another notable cubic non-three-edge-colorable graph is Tietze&#x27;s graph, with 12 vertices; as Heinrich Franz Friedrich Tietze discovered in 1910, it forms the boundary of a subdivision of the Möbius strip requiring six colors. However, because it contains a triangle, it is not generally considered a snark. Under strict definitions of snarks, the smallest snarks are the Petersen graph and Blanuša snarks, followed by six different 20-vertex snarks.

A list of all of the snarks up to 36 vertices (according to a strict definition), and up to 34 vertices (under a weaker definition), was generated by Gunnar Brinkmann, Jan Goedgebeur, Jonas Hägglund and Klas Markström in 2012. The number of snarks for a given even number of vertices grows at least exponentially in the number of vertices. (Because they have odd-degree vertices, all snarks must have an even number of vertices by the handshaking lemma.) OEIS sequence contains the number of non-trivial snarks of formula_1 vertices for small values of formula_2.

==Definition==
The precise definition of snarks varies among authors, but generally refers to cubic graphs (having exactly three edges at each vertex) whose edges cannot be colored with only three colors. By Vizing&#x27;s theorem, the number of colors needed for the edges of a cubic graph is either three (&quot;class one&quot; graphs) or four (&quot;class two&quot; graphs), so snarks are cubic graphs of class two. However, in order to avoid cases where a snark is of class two for trivial reasons, or is constructed in a trivial way from smaller graphs, additional restrictions on connectivity and cycle lengths are often imposed. In particular:
*If a cubic graph has a bridge, an edge whose removal would disconnect it, then it cannot be of class one. By the handshaking lemma, the subgraphs on either side of the bridge have an odd number of vertices each. Whichever of three colors is chosen for the bridge, their odd number of vertices prevents these subgraphs from being covered by cycles that alternate between the other two colors, as would be necessary in a 3-edge-coloring. For this reason, snarks are generally required to be bridgeless.
*A loop (an edge connecting a vertex to itself) cannot be colored without causing the same color to appear twice at that vertex, a violation of the usual requirements for graph edge coloring. Additionally, a cycle consisting of two vertices connected by two edges can always be replaced by a single edge connecting their two other neighbors, simplifying the graph without changing its three-edge-colorability. For these reasons, snarks are generally restricted to simple graphs, graphs without loops or multiple adjacencies.
*If a graph contains a triangle, then it can again be simplified without changing its three-edge-colorability, by contracting the three vertices of the triangle into a single vertex. Therefore, many definitions of snarks forbid triangles. However, although this requirement was also stated in Gardner&#x27;s work giving the name &quot;snark&quot; to these graphs, Gardner lists Tietze&#x27;s graph, which contains a triangle, as being a snark.
*If a graph contains a four-vertex cycle, it can be simplified in two different ways by removing two opposite edges of the cycle and replacing the resulting paths of degree-two vertices by single edges. It has a three-edge-coloring if and only if at least one of these simplifications does. Therefore, Isaacs requires a &quot;nontrivial&quot; cubic class-two graph to avoid four-vertex cycles, and other authors have followed suit in forbidding these cycles. The requirement that a snark avoid cycles of length four or less can be summarized by stating that the girth of these graphs, the length of their shortest cycles, is at least five.
*More strongly, the definition used by requires snarks to be cyclically 4-edge-connected. That means there can be no subset of three or fewer edges, the removal of which would disconnect the graph into two subgraphs each of which has at least one cycle. Brinkmann et al. define a snark to be a cubic and cyclically 4-edge-connected graph of girth five or more and class two; they define a &quot;weak snark&quot; to allow girth four.
Although these definitions only consider constraints on the girth up to five, snarks with arbitrarily large girth exist.

==Properties==
Work by Peter G. Tait established that the four-color theorem is true if and only if every snark is non-planar. This theorem states that every planar graph has a graph coloring of its the vertices with four colors, but Tait showed how to convert 4-vertex-colorings of maximal planar graphs into 3-edge-colorings of their dual graphs, which are cubic and planar, and vice versa. A planar snark would therefore necessarily be dual to a counterexample to the four-color theorem. Thus, the subsequent proof of the four-color theorem also demonstrates that all snarks are non-planar.

All snarks are non-Hamiltonian: when a cubic graph has a Hamiltonian cycle, it is always possible to 3-color its edges, by using two colors in alternation for the cycle, and the third color for the remaining edges. However, many known snarks are close to being Hamiltonian, in the sense that they are hypohamiltonian graphs: the removal of any single vertex leaves a Hamiltonian subgraph. A hypohamiltonian snark must be &quot;bicritical&quot;: the removal of any two vertices leaves a three-edge-colorable subgraph. The &quot;oddness&quot; of a cubic graph is defined as the minimum number of odd cycles, in any system of cycles that covers each vertex once (a 2-factor). For the same reason that they have no Hamiltonian cycles, snarks have positive oddness: a completely even 2-factor would lead to a 3-edge-coloring, and vice versa. It is possible to construct infinite families of snarks whose oddness grows linearly with their numbers of vertices.

The cycle double cover conjecture posits that in every bridgeless graph one can find a collection of cycles covering each edge twice, or equivalently that the graph can be embedded onto a surface in such a way that all faces of the embedding are simple cycles. When a cubic graph has a 3-edge-coloring, it has a cycle double cover consisting of the cycles formed by each pair of colors. Therefore, among cubic graphs, the snarks are the only possible counterexamples. More generally, snarks form the difficult case for this conjecture: if it is true for snarks, it is true for all graphs. In this connection, Branko Grünbaum conjectured that no snark could be embedded onto a surface in such a way that all faces are simple cycles and such that every two faces either are disjoint or share only a single edge; if any snark had such an embedding, its faces would form a cycle double cover. However, a counterexample to Grünbaum&#x27;s conjecture was found by Martin Kochol.

Determining whether a given cyclically 5-connected cubic graph is 3-edge-colorable is NP-complete. Therefore, determining whether a graph is a snark is co-NP-complete.

==Snark conjecture==
W. T. Tutte conjectured that every snark has the Petersen graph as a minor. That is, he conjectured that the smallest snark, the Petersen graph, may be formed from any other snark by contracting some edges and deleting others. Equivalently (because the Petersen graph has maximum degree three) every snark has a subgraph that can be formed from the Petersen graph by subdividing some of its edges. This conjecture is a strengthened form of the four color theorem, because any graph containing the Petersen graph as a minor must be nonplanar. In 1999, Neil Robertson, Daniel P. Sanders, Paul Seymour, and Robin Thomas announced a proof of this conjecture. Steps towards this result have been published in 2016 and 2019, but the complete proof remains unpublished. See the Hadwiger conjecture for other problems and results relating graph coloring to graph minors.

Tutte also conjectured a generalization to arbitrary graphs: every bridgeless graph with no Petersen minor has a nowhere zero 4-flow. That is, the edges of the graph may be assigned a direction, and a number from the set {1, 2, 3}, such that the sum of the incoming numbers minus the sum of the outgoing numbers at each vertex is divisible by four. As Tutte showed, for cubic graphs such an assignment exists if and only if the edges can be colored by three colors, so the conjecture would follow from the snark conjecture in this case. However, proving the snark conjecture would not settle the question of the existence of 4-flows for non-cubic graphs.

<text>In cryptography and number theory, TWIRL (The [[Weizmann Institute]] Relation Locator) is a hypothetical hardware device designed to speed up the sieving step of the general number field sieve integer factorization algorithm. During the sieving step, the algorithm searches for numbers with a certain mathematical relationship. In distributed factoring projects, this is the step that is parallelized to a large number of processors.

TWIRL is still a hypothetical device — no implementation has been publicly reported. However, its designers, Adi Shamir and Eran Tromer, estimate that if TWIRL were built, it would be able to factor 1024-bit numbers in one year at the cost of &quot;a few dozen million US dollars&quot;. TWIRL could therefore have enormous repercussions in cryptography and computer security — many high-security systems still use 1024-bit RSA keys, which TWIRL would be able to break in a reasonable amount of time and for reasonable costs.

The security of some important cryptographic algorithms, notably RSA and the Blum Blum Shub pseudorandom number generator, rests in the difficulty of factorizing large integers. If factorizing large integers becomes easier, users of these algorithms will have to resort to using larger keys (computationally more expensive) or to using different algorithms, whose security rests on some other computationally hard problem (like the discrete logarithm problem).

<text>Kiki Gyan (7 June 1957 – 6 June 2004), also known as Kiki Djan, was a Ghanaian musician. He was the keyboardist of the band Osibisa which was popular in the 1970s. He also recorded and produced a series of disco records. He was a prodigy who could play the keyboard exceptionally well.

==Early life==
Born into a middle-class family in Takoradi, Ghana, Gyan started playing the piano when he was five years old and went professional at the age of 12. He dropped out of secondary school at 14 and after a tour of London with a local Ghanaian band called Pagadija; he joined the UK-based Afro-rock group Osibisa after his talent was recognized by the brother of the band&#x27;s founder. He was only 15 years old when he started playing with Osibisa in 1972, replacing the keyboardist who had just left, and he travelled internationally with the band during the 1970s, playing to large audiences around the world.

== Height of his career ==
By the age of 18, Gyan had made more than a million dollars, &quot;had hung out with Elton John and Mick Jagger, played for Britain&#x27;s Queen and cruised on champagne-drenched luxury ocean-liners to island-hop in the Caribbean&quot;. In 1977, he met Marvin Gaye, Peter Tosh, Stevie Wonder, and Third World during the FESTAC event in Nigeria. He left Osibisa to go solo in 1979 and recorded the single &quot;24 Hours in a Disco&quot;, which hit the charts in the United States and the UK.

He was briefly married to Fela Kuti&#x27;s first daughter, before divorcing to marry a Ghanaian woman. He has a daughter named Vanessa Gyan who now lives in Ghana with her son, Aaron.

== Later life and death ==
Gyan became addicted to hard drugs for some 21 years, to the detriment of his career. Kiki Gyan died alone and impoverished in a church bathroom in Ghana, the cause of death being AIDS and drug-related complications.

<text>Charles Woodruff Yost (November 6, 1907 – May 21, 1981) was a career U.S. Ambassador who was assigned as his country&#x27;s representative to the United Nations from 1969 to 1971.

==Early life and education==
Yost was born in Watertown, New York. He attended the Hotchkiss School, where he was a member of the class of 1924 that included Roswell Gilpatric, Paul Nitze and Chapman Rose, before graduating from Princeton University in 1928. He did postgraduate studies at the École des Hautes Études International (École pratique des hautes études) in Paris. Over the next year he traveled to Geneva, Berlin, the Soviet Union (with author Croswell Bowen), Poland, Rumania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Spain, and Vienna.

==Career==
Yost joined the U.S. Foreign Service in 1930 on the advice of former Secretary of State Robert Lansing, and served in Alexandria, Egypt as a consular officer, followed by an assignment in Poland. In 1933, he left the Foreign Service to pursue a career as a freelance foreign correspondent in Europe and a writer in New York City.

After his marriage to Irena Rawicz-Oldakowska, he returned to the U.S. State Department in 1935, becoming assistant chief of the Division of Arms and Munitions Control in 1936. In 1941, he represented the State Department on the Policy Committee of the Board of Economic Warfare. Yost was appointed assistant chief of special research in 1942, and was made assistant chief of the Division of Foreign Activity Correlation in 1943. In February of the next year he became executive secretary of the Department of State Policy Committee. He attended the Dumbarton Oaks Conference from August to October 1944, when he worked on Chapters VI and VII of the United Nations Charter. He then served at the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco in April 1945 as aide to Secretary of State Edward Stettinius. In July of that year he was secretary-general of the Potsdam Conference.

In 1945, Yost was reinstated in the Foreign Service, and later that year he served as political adviser to U.S. Lieutenant General Raymond Albert Wheeler on the staff of Lord Louis Mountbatten in Kandy, Ceylon. He then became chargé d&#x27;affaires in Thailand during the short reign of Ananda Mahidol. Throughout the late 1940s and the 1950s, his assignments took him to Czechoslovakia, Austria (twice), and Greece. In 1954, he was named minister to Laos, and he became the first United States ambassador there a year later. In 1957, he was minister counselor in Paris. At the end of the same year he was named ambassador to Syria. Shortly after his appointment, Syria and Egypt formed the United Arab Republic, and the U.S. was asked to close its embassy in Syria. Yost was then sent as ambassador to Morocco in 1958.

In 1961, he began his first assignment at the United Nations as the deputy to Ambassador Adlai Stevenson. After Stevenson&#x27;s death in 1965, Yost stayed on as deputy to Ambassador Arthur Goldberg. In 1964, Yost was promoted to the rank of Career Ambassador, the highest professional Foreign Service level, in recognition of especially distinguished service over a sustained period.

In 1966 he resigned from the Foreign Service to begin his career as a writer, at the Council on Foreign Relations, and as a teacher, at Columbia University.

In 1969, President Richard Nixon called Yost out of retirement to become the permanent United States representative to the United Nations. He resigned in 1971 and returned to writing, at the Brookings Institution, and teaching at Georgetown University&#x27;s School of Foreign Service.

Yost set forth his views in a syndicated newspaper column, for &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, and in four books — &quot;The Age of Triumph and Frustration: Modern Dialogues,&quot; &quot;The Insecurity of Nations,&quot; &quot;The Conduct and Misconduct of Foreign Relations,&quot; and &quot;History and Memory&quot;.

In 1974, Yost was awarded the Foreign Service Cup by his fellow Foreign Service officers.

In 1979, Yost was co-chairman of Americans for SALT II, a group that lobbied the Senate for passage of the second Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty. He was a trustee of the American University in Cairo, Egypt, and director of the Aspen Institute for cultural exchanges with Iran. He took part in the unofficial Dartmouth Conferences of United States and Soviet scholars. In 1973, he was named head of the National Committee on United States-China Relations; he visited the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1973 and 1977.

<text>25 Phocaea () is a stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 75 kilometers in diameter. It is the parent body of the Phocaea family. Discovered by Jean Chacornac in 1853, it was named after the ancient Greek city of Phocaea.

== Discovery and naming ==

&quot;Phocaea&quot; was discovered on 6 April 1853, by French astronomer Jean Chacornac at Marseille Observatory in southern France. It was his first asteroid discovery out of a total of six. The asteroid was named after the ancient Ionian Greek city of Phocaea, modern-day Foça in Turkey, where the founders of Marseille came from. The naming was proposed by French astronomer Benjamin Valz.

== Classification and orbit ==

&quot;Phocaea&quot; is the parent body and namesake of the Phocaea family (), a large asteroid family of stony asteroids in the inner main belt.

It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8–3.0 AU once every 3 years and 9 months (1,358 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.25 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins at Vienna Observatory in March 1860, almost 7 years after its official discovery observation at Marseille.

== Physical characteristics ==

&quot;Phocaea&quot; is a stony S-type asteroid in both the Tholen and SMASS classification, and has also been characterized as such by others.

Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico during 2010 gave a lightcurve with a period of 9.9341 ± 0.0002 hours. The brightness near the deepest minimum of the light curve showed changes with phase angle, which is the result of shadows extending across surface irregularities. Several other lightcurves have also been obtained.

&quot;Phocaea&quot; has also been studied by radar.

According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, &quot;Phocaea&quot; measures between 61.05 and 83.21 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.189 and 0.350.

The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.2310 and a diameter of 75.13 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 7.83.

The asteroid has a mass of (5.99 ± 0.60) × 1017 kilograms and a mean density of grams per cubic centimeters, which lies approximately in between the density of limestone and concrete/gravel.

<text>, &quot;prov. designation&quot;: , is a minor planet and the first Neptune trojan discovered, by American astronomer Marc Buie of the Deep Ecliptic Survey at Cerro Tololo Observatory in Chile on 21 August 2001. It orbits ahead of Neptune at its Lagrangian point and measures approximately in diameter.

Other Neptune trojans have been discovered since. A study by American astronomers Scott Sheppard and Chad Trujillo from the Carnegie Institution suggests that Neptune could possibly have twenty times more trojans than Jupiter.

== Orbit ==

 orbits the Sun with a semi-major axis of 30.115 AU at a distance of 29.3–31.0 AU once every 165 years and 3 months (60,363 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.03 and an inclination of 1° with respect to the ecliptic.

=== Dynamical stability ===

Early studies of the dynamical stability of , which used a small number of test particles spread over the uncertainties of just a few orbital parameters that were derived from a limited observation arc, suggested that is on a remarkably stable orbit, because most test particles remained on trojan orbits for 5 Gyr. Thereafter, the stability of Neptune trojans was simply assumed.

A more recent study, which used a very large number of test particles spread over the 3σ uncertainties in all six orbital parameters derived from a longer observational arc, has indicated that is far less dynamically stable than previously thought. The test particles were lost exponentially with a half life of 553 Myr. Further observations can determine whether &#x27;s orbit is actually within the dynamically stable or within the unstable part.

The stability is strongly dependent on semi-major axis, with a≥30.30 AU being far less stable, but only very weakly dependent on the other orbital parameters. This is because those with larger semi-major axes have larger libration amplitudes, with amplitudes ~70° and above being destabilized by secondary resonances between the trojan motion and the dynamics of at least Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Secular resonances were found not to contribute to the dynamical stability of .

== Numbering and naming ==

This minor planet was numbered and its discoverer determined by the Minor Planet Center on 28 March 2022 (). If named, it will follow the naming scheme already established with 385571 Otrera, which is to name these objects after figures related to the Amazons, an all-female warrior tribe that fought in the Trojan War on the side of the Trojans against the Greek.

== Physical characteristics ==

The discoverers estimate that the body has a mean diameter of 132 kilometers with a low albedo of 0.058 at an absolute magnitude of 8.12. It has a visual magnitude of 22.5.

<text>Harry James Potter is the titular character of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series of novels by J. K. Rowling. The plot of the seven-book series chronicles seven years in the life of the orphan Harry, who, on his eleventh birthday, learns he is a wizard. He attends Hogwarts, a school of magic, where he receives guidance from the headmaster Albus Dumbledore and becomes friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry learns that during his infancy, the Dark wizard Lord Voldemort murdered his parents but was unable to kill him as well. The plot of the series revolves around Harry&#x27;s struggle to adapt to the wizarding world and defeat Voldemort.

Harry is regarded as a fictional icon and has been described by many critics, readers, and audiences as one of the greatest literary and film characters of all time. He is portrayed by Daniel Radcliffe in all eight &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films. Harry also appears in the play &quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot;, which has been produced on stage since 2016.

==Concept and creation==
According to Rowling, the idea for Harry Potter and the novel series came to her while she was waiting for a train in 1990. She first conceived of Harry as a &quot;scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy&quot; who is unaware that he is a wizard. While developing ideas for the first book, she decided to make Harry an orphan who attends a boarding school called Hogwarts. She explained in a 1999 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;Harry had to be an orphan—so that he&#x27;s a free agent, with no fear of letting down his parents, disappointing them ... Then there&#x27;s the security. Having a child of my own reinforces my belief that children above all want security, and that&#x27;s what Hogwarts offers Harry.&quot;

The death of Rowling&#x27;s mother in December 1990 inspired her to write Harry as a boy longing for his dead parents. She explained that his anguish became &quot;much deeper&quot; and &quot;much more real&quot; than in earlier drafts because she related to it herself. In a 2000 interview, Rowling said that the character Wart in T. H. White&#x27;s novel &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; is Harry&#x27;s &quot;spiritual ancestor&quot;. Although Rowling gave Harry her own birth date of 31 July, she maintained that he is not directly based on any real-life person. She explained that he came &quot;out of a part of me&quot;.

Rowling has claimed that Harry is a suitable real-life role model for children. She said, &quot;The advantage of a fictional hero or heroine is that you can know them better than you can know a living hero, many of whom you would never meet ... if people like Harry and identify with him, I am pleased, because I think he is very likeable.&quot;

==Appearances==

=== Novels ===

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; ====
Harry is first introduced in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (1997) as an orphan living with his abusive aunt and uncle, Vernon and Petunia Dursley, and their bullying son, Dudley. On his eleventh birthday, Harry discovers he is a wizard when Rubeus Hagrid brings him an acceptance letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that his parents, James and Lily Potter, were murdered by a powerful Dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, who also tried to kill Harry. However, Voldemort&#x27;s killing curse bounced back and apparently destroyed him, leaving Harry with a lightning-bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. Due to his miraculous survival, Harry became famous among wizards.

Hagrid takes Harry to Diagon Alley to shop for school supplies. Harry buys a wand, and the proprietor tells him that his wand and Voldemort&#x27;s wand contain feathers from the same phoenix. At the end of the summer, Harry boards the Hogwarts Express, where he befriends Ron Weasley and meets Hermione Granger. When he arrives at Hogwarts, he is assigned to Gryffindor House by the Sorting Hat. During the school year, he receives guidance from the Transfiguration professor Minerva McGonagall and the headmaster Albus Dumbledore. He develops animosity towards a fellow first-year named Draco Malfoy, and becomes increasingly wary of the Potions professor, Severus Snape. Harry and Ron become friends with Hermione after they save her from a troll, and Harry becomes the youngest Seeker on the Gryffindor Quidditch team in a century. 

During Christmas holidays, Harry receives an anonymous gift – his father&#x27;s invisibility cloak. Aided by the cloak, he is able to explore the school freely. He, Ron and Hermione decide to enter a trapdoor they discovered one night, which is guarded by an enormous three-headed dog. They believe a valuable magical object, the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone, lies beyond the door. After they navigate a series of obstacles, Harry faces Professor Quirrell, whose body has been possessed by Voldemort. When Harry obtains the Stone, Quirrell tries to kill him. However, Quirrell&#x27;s flesh burns upon contact with Harry&#x27;s skin, and Harry passes out.

Harry awakens in the Hogwarts infirmary, where Dumbledore explains that Harry was protected by his mother&#x27;s love, which also killed Quirrell. Voldemort survived, and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone was destroyed. During the school&#x27;s end-of-year feast, Gryffindor is awarded the House Cup thanks to the many points Harry and his friends obtained from their adventure.

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; ====
In &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (1998), Muggle-born students are being Petrified in the Hogwarts castle. Some students suspect that Harry is behind the attacks, which alienates him from his peers. Harry learns that he shares Voldemort&#x27;s ability to communicate with snakes, and he begins to question whether he is worthy of Gryffindor House. After Ron&#x27;s sister Ginny disappears, Harry enters the Chamber of Secrets to rescue her. He battles Tom Riddle, a version of Voldemort that lives in a diary which had possessed Ginny. In addition to Riddle, Harry encounters the basilisk which has been attacking students. To defeat it, Harry summons the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat. After Harry triumphs over the basilisk and saves Ginny, Dumbledore reassures him that he is worthy of Gryffindor.

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; ====
Near the beginning of &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (1999)&quot;,&quot; Harry becomes angry after his Aunt Marge disparages his parents. He accidentally inflates her with magic, then runs away from home. As he re-enters the wizarding community, he learns about Sirius Black, a notorious killer who escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban. On the train to Hogwarts, Harry is assaulted by Dementors, which cause him to relive his worst memories. During a Care of Magical Creatures lesson with Hagrid, Draco is injured after provoking a hippogriff named Buckbeak. As a result, the Ministry of Magic sentences Buckbeak to death. After Harry has more encounters with Dementors, he asks the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Remus Lupin, to help him ward them off. Lupin teaches Harry the Patronus charm, which Harry struggles to master. 

While in the village of Hogsmeade, Harry learns that his parents were betrayed by Sirius, their friend and Harry&#x27;s godfather, and that Sirius also killed Peter Pettigrew. After Ron is taken to the Shrieking Shack by a wild dog, Harry and Hermione give chase and realize the dog is Sirius in Animagus form. Lupin arrives, and he and Sirius explain that Sirius did not kill Pettigrew. They also reveal that Ron&#x27;s pet rat, Scabbers, is Pettigrew. Lupin then transforms into a werewolf and injures Sirius, and Pettigrew escapes amid the chaos. A swarm of Dementors appear, but they are driven off by a Patronus cast by a mysterious figure.

Awakening in the school infirmary, Harry and Hermione learn that Sirius is being held captive in Hogwarts and is awaiting the Dementor&#x27;s Kiss. At Dumbledore&#x27;s advice, they use a Time-Turner to travel back in time to the moment before Buckbeak&#x27;s execution. After they save the hippogriff, Harry notices the past versions of himself, Hermione, and Sirius being attacked by Dementors. He conjures a strong Patronus to fight them off, then realizes that he was the mysterious figure who appeared earlier. Harry and Hermione free Sirius, who flies away on Buckbeak, still a wanted fugitive. Harry and Hermione then return to their original timeline.

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; ====
In &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; (2000), Harry is mysteriously chosen by the Goblet of Fire to compete in the dangerous Triwizard Tournament, even though another Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory, has already been selected. During the Tournament&#x27;s final challenge, Harry and Cedric are transported to a graveyard, where Cedric is killed by Peter Pettigrew. Voldemort, aided by Pettigrew, uses Harry&#x27;s blood to resurrect his body. Harry then duels Voldemort, and their wands connect. Spirit echoes of Voldemort&#x27;s victims, including Harry&#x27;s parents, emerge from his wand. The spirits protect Harry as he escapes to Hogwarts with Cedric&#x27;s body.

Rowling said it was necessary to depict violence and death in this novel because it allows Harry&#x27;s bravery and compassion to show. She said that Harry&#x27;s effort to prevent Cedric&#x27;s body from falling into Voldemort&#x27;s hands was based on the scene in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; where Achilles retrieves the corpse of his friend Patroclus from his enemy Hector. She asserted that &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; marks a turning point in Harry&#x27;s life. She said Harry has been &quot;very protected until now&quot; but in this novel he is no longer protected.

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; ====
In &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; (2003), the Ministry of Magic wages a smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore, disputing their claims that Voldemort has returned. The Ministry appoints Dolores Umbridge as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Because the Ministry suspects that Dumbledore is building a student army, Umbridge refuses to teach students practical defensive magic. Harry, Hermione and Ron subsequently form a secret group called Dumbledore&#x27;s Army to teach students defensive spells. The group is disbanded, however, when one student informs Umbridge about it. To shield his students from punishment, Dumbledore falsely claims that Dumbledore&#x27;s Army was his idea. As a result, he is ousted from his position as headmaster and replaced with Umbridge.

During this time, Harry&#x27;s increasingly angry and erratic behaviour nearly estranges him from Ron and Hermione. He suffers another emotional blow when his godfather Sirius is killed by the Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange during a battle at the Department of Mysteries. Also present is Voldemort, who tries to possess Harry so Dumbledore will kill him. This ruse fails, and Harry and Dumbledore thwart Voldemort&#x27;s plan to steal an important prophecy. Later, Dumbledore explains to Harry that Voldemort chose Harry as his equal, and that either he or Voldemort must eventually kill the other. A subplot of the novel involves Harry&#x27;s romance with Cho Chang, which quickly unravels.

Rowling said she put Harry through extreme emotional stress in &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; to show his emotional vulnerability and humanity, which contrast with Voldemort&#x27;s inhumanity. 

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; ====
In &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; (2005), Dumbledore brings Harry along as he attempts to persuade Horace Slughorn to rejoin the Hogwarts faculty as the Potions professor. Harry excels in Slughorn&#x27;s class after he begins using an old textbook that once belonged to someone known as &quot;The Half-Blood Prince&quot;. Outside of class, Dumbledore uses the Pensieve to teach Harry about Voldemort&#x27;s life and his rise to power. Harry and Dumbledore learn that Voldemort created six Horcruxes to gain immortality, and that they must be destroyed before Voldemort can be killed. Harry repeatedly warns Dumbledore that Draco Malfoy is an agent of Voldemort, but Dumbledore refuses to take action against Draco. He tells Harry that he already knows more about what is happening than Harry does. During the course of the novel, Harry becomes romantically involved with Ginny.

Near the end of the book, Dumbledore and Harry enter a cave in search of a Horcrux. Dumbledore drinks a potion inside the Horcrux&#x27;s container and begins to scream in agony. When Harry attempts to retrieve some lake water for Dumbledore to drink, he is attacked by Inferi. They try to drown Harry, but Dumbledore rescues him. Dumbledore and Harry then return to the Hogwarts Astronomy Tower with the Horcrux. Dumbledore asks Harry not to interfere in the events that are about to take place, and puts him in a body-binding curse. Immobilized, Harry is unable to intervene as Snape arrives and kills Dumbledore. Later, Harry ends his relationship with Ginny to protect her from Voldemort.

Rowling said that Harry&#x27;s tumultuous puberty in the novel is based on her own difficult teenage years and those of her sister. She said that after &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; Harry becomes &quot;battle-hardened&quot; and is ready to fight and take revenge against Voldemort and Snape.

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; ====
Harry, Ron, and Hermione leave Hogwarts in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; (2007) to search for and demolish Voldemort&#x27;s four remaining Horcruxes. They must be destroyed with basilisk venom, the Sword of Gryffindor, or some other powerful means. Ron, Hermione, Vincent Crabbe and Neville Longbottom each destroy one of these Horcruxes. After a battle at Hogwarts, Harry goes into the Forbidden Forest to meet Voldemort, who uses the Elder Wand to cast the Killing Curse on Harry. The curse stuns Harry into a deathlike state, and he finds himself in an ethereal realm with Dumbledore. The deceased headmaster tells Harry that he is a Horcrux that Voldemort unknowingly created. There was a part of Voldemort&#x27;s soul inside Harry, but it was destroyed by the curse Voldemort cast moments ago. Harry subsequently returns to the living world and duels with Voldemort. The Dark Lord uses the Killing Curse again, but it rebounds and kills him. Harry, not Voldemort, was the true master of the Elder Wand, and the wand did not wish to harm its master. Harry decides to leave the Elder Wand in Dumbledore&#x27;s tomb and the Resurrection Stone hidden in the forest, but he keeps the Invisibility Cloak.

In the epilogue, set nineteen years after Voldemort&#x27;s death, Harry and Ginny are a married couple and have three children: James Sirius Potter, Albus Severus Potter and Lily Luna Potter. Albus is departing for his first year at Hogwarts, and is worried that he will be sorted into Slytherin. Harry explains to him that not all Slytherins are bad.

===&quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot;===

&quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot; is a play written by Jack Thorne from a story by Thorne, J. K. Rowling and John Tiffany. It takes place nineteen years after the events of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;. In the play, Harry is Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement at the Ministry of Magic. The story focuses on Harry&#x27;s son, Albus Severus Potter.

===Film adaptations===
Harry is portrayed by Daniel Radcliffe in all eight &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film adaptations. Radcliffe was asked to audition for the role in 2000 by David Heyman, who was producing the first film in the series. Radcliffe met Heyman while attending a London play called &quot;Stones in His Pockets&quot;.

In a 2007 interview with MTV, Radcliffe described the development of his character during the course of the series: &quot;That&#x27;s what the films are about for me: a loss of innocence, going from being a young kid in awe of the world around him, to someone who is more battle-hardened by the end of it.&quot; Radcliffe said that after the death of Cedric Diggory in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, Harry experiences survivor&#x27;s guilt and feels immense loneliness. Because of this, Radcliffe talked to a bereavement counsellor to help him prepare for the role. Radcliffe stated that the most repeated question he has been asked is how &quot;Harry Potter&quot; has influenced his own life, to which he regularly answers it has been &quot;fine&quot;, and that he did not feel pigeonholed by the role, but rather sees it as a huge privilege to portray Harry.

In 2011, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked Radcliffe&#x27;s Harry Potter as the 36th greatest film character of all time. The magazine published another character ranking in 2018, this time placing Harry at 67th.

==Characterisation==
===Outward appearance===
In the novels, Harry is described as having his father&#x27;s perpetually untidy black hair, his mother&#x27;s bright green eyes, and a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. He is short and skinny for his age, with a thin face and &quot;knobbly&quot; knees, and he wears Windsor glasses. When asked about the meaning behind Harry&#x27;s scar, Rowling said she wanted him to be &quot;physically marked by what he has been through&quot;. She said the scar is &quot;an outward expression of what he has been through inside&quot;. Rowling also said that Harry&#x27;s glasses are the clue to his vulnerability. Harry eventually grows taller, and by the final book is almost the height of his father, and is described as tall by other characters. 

===Personality===
According to Rowling, Harry is strongly guided by his own conscience, and has a keen feeling of what is right and wrong. Having &quot;very limited access to truly caring adults&quot;, Rowling said, Harry &quot;is forced, for such a young person, to make his own choices&quot;. He &quot;does make mistakes&quot;, she conceded, but in the end, he does what his conscience tells him to do. According to Rowling, one of Harry&#x27;s pivotal scenes came in the fourth book when he protects his dead schoolmate Cedric Diggory&#x27;s body from Voldemort, because it shows he is brave and selfless.

Rowling has stated that Harry&#x27;s character flaws include anger and impulsiveness; however, Harry is also innately honourable. &quot;He&#x27;s not a cruel boy. He&#x27;s competitive, and he&#x27;s a fighter. He doesn&#x27;t just lie down and take abuse. But he does have native integrity, which makes him a hero to me. He&#x27;s a normal boy but with those qualities most of us really admire.&quot; For the most part, Harry shows humility and modesty, often downplaying his achievements; though he uses a litany of his adventures as examples of his maturity early in the fifth book. However, these very same accomplishments are later employed to explain why he should lead Dumbledore&#x27;s Army, at which point he asserts them as having just been luck, and denies that they make him worthy of authority. After the seventh book, Rowling commented that Harry has the ultimate character strength, which not even Voldemort possesses: the acceptance of the inevitability of death.

===Magical abilities and skills===
Throughout the series, Harry is described as a gifted wizard. He has a particular talent for flying, which manifests itself in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; the first time he tries it, and gets him a place on a Quidditch team one year before the normal minimum joining age. He captains it in his sixth year. In his fourth year, Harry is able to confront a dragon on his broomstick.

Harry is also gifted in Defence Against the Dark Arts, in which he becomes proficient due to his repeated encounters with Voldemort and various monsters. In his third year, Harry becomes able to cast the very advanced Patronus Charm, and by his fifth year he has become so talented at the subject that he is able to teach his fellow students in Dumbledore&#x27;s Army, some even older than him how to defend themselves against Dark Magic. At the end of that year, he achieves an &#x27;Outstanding&#x27; Defence Against the Dark Arts O.W.L., something that not even Hermione achieved.

Harry also has the unusual ability to speak and understand &quot;Parseltongue&quot;, a language associated with Dark Magic. This, it transpires, is because he harbours a piece of Voldemort&#x27;s soul. He loses this ability after the part of Voldemort&#x27;s soul inside him is destroyed at the end of &quot;The Deathly Hallows&quot;. However, in the events of &quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot;, it was revealed that he had not lost the ability to recognise or speak the language when he encountered Delphini, Voldemort&#x27;s daughter, who was trying to use his son and Draco Malfoy&#x27;s son Scorpius to fulfill a prophecy that could guarantee the return of Voldemort by changing time.

===Possessions===
Harry&#x27;s parents left him a large pile of gold in the wizarding bank, Gringotts. After Sirius&#x27; death later in the series, all of his remaining possessions are also passed along to Harry, including Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, and Sirius&#x27;s vast amount of gold were transferred into Harry&#x27;s account at Gringotts.

Among the school items Harry purchases in Diagon Alley after discovering his gold inheritance is his first wand, an 11-inch-long holly and phoenix feather model that he learns is the twin of Voldemort&#x27;s wand, as the feathers that both wands contain as their cores both comes from Fawkes, the phoenix that Dumbledore keeps as a pet in his office until his death in &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;. Harry&#x27;s wand is broken in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;. For a time, he borrows Hermione&#x27;s wand, and later steals Draco&#x27;s. With his defeat of Voldemort at the end of the series, he comes into the possession of the Elder Wand, but uses it only to repair his holly wand, before returning it to Dumbledore&#x27;s tomb, from which Voldemort had stolen it. In the film version of &quot;Deathly Hallows Part 2&quot;, Harry destroys the Elder Wand.

Harry also inherits indirectly two of his father&#x27;s prized possessions. One is the Marauder&#x27;s Map, given to him by interim owners Fred and George Weasley, which endows Harry with comprehensive knowledge of Hogwarts&#x27; facilities, grounds, and occupants. The other is his father&#x27;s invisibility cloak, given to him by Dumbledore, which eventually proves Harry&#x27;s descent from the Peverell family. Harry uses these tools both to aid in excursions at school and to protect those he cares about; the Invisibility Cloak, in particular, can hide two full-grown people. If three fully-grown people hide under the cloak their feet will be visible.

Throughout the majority of the books, Harry also has a pet owl named Hedwig, used to deliver and receive messages and packages. Hedwig is killed in the seventh book, about which Rowling says: &quot;The loss of Hedwig represented a loss of innocence and security. She has been almost like a cuddly toy to Harry at times. I know that death upset a lot of people!&quot; As a Quidditch player, Harry has owned two high-quality brooms. The first, a Nimbus Two Thousand, was procured for him by Professor Minerva McGonagall when Harry was added to Gryffindor&#x27;s Quidditch team despite being a first-year student. This broom was destroyed by the Whomping Willow during a match in Harry&#x27;s third year. It was replaced by a Firebolt, an even faster broom, purchased for Harry by Sirius; however, as Sirius was believed to be trying to murder Harry at the time, the broom was subjected to stringent security inspections before Harry was allowed to ride it. Harry used it throughout his Hogwarts career until it, along with Hedwig, was lost during the July escape from Privet Drive in the final book.

Harry also owns a mokeskin pouch, or small &#x27;bag&#x27; that is used for storing items, which no one but the owner can get out. Harry uses the pouch throughout the course of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; to keep several objects such as the Marauder&#x27;s Map, a shard of the magical mirror given to him by his god-father Sirius, the fake Horcrux locket that had belonged to Sirius&#x27;s brother R.A.B. (Regulus Arcturus Black), the Snitch bequeathed to him by Dumbledore, containing the Resurrection Stone that had previously been set into Voldemort&#x27;s grandfather Marvolo Gaunt&#x27;s signet ring, which Harry discovers is actually the second Hallow, a letter from his mother to Sirius with part of a photo (of him and his father, James), and eventually, his own broken wand (which Harry later repairs with the Elder Wand).

===Family===
In the novels and films, Harry is the only child of James and Lily Potter, orphaned as an infant. Rowling made him an orphan because she felt an orphan would be interesting to write about. However, after her mother&#x27;s death, Rowling wrote Harry as a child longing to see his dead parents again, incorporating her own anguish into him. Harry is categorised as a &quot;half-blood&quot; wizard in the series, because although both his parents were magical, Lily was &quot;Muggle-born&quot;, and James was a pure-blood.

Harry&#x27;s aunt and uncle kept the truth about his parents&#x27; deaths from Harry, telling him that they had died in a car crash. James Potter is a descendant of Ignotus Peverell, the third of the three original owners of the Deathly Hallows, and thus so is Harry, a realisation he makes during the course of the final book. The lineage continues at the end of the saga through his three children with Ginny: James Sirius Potter, Albus Severus Potter and Lily Luna Potter.

==Reception==
In 2002, &quot;Book&quot; magazine ranked Harry Potter No. 85 among the &quot;100 Best Fictional Characters since 1900&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Harry Potter number two on its 2010 &quot;100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years&quot; list, saying &quot;Long after we&#x27;ve turned the last page and watched the last end credit, Harry still feels like someone we know. And that&#x27;s the most magical thing about him.&quot; UGO Networks listed Harry as one of their best heroes of all time, who said that &quot;Harry is a hero to the often oppressed and downtrodden young fan boys and girls out there, who finally have an icon that is respected and revered by those who might otherwise look down on robe-wearing and wand waving as dork fodder&quot;. Harry Potter was also ranked number thirty-six on &quot;Empire&quot; 2008 list of &quot;100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time&quot;. IGN said that Harry Potter was their favourite &quot;Harry Potter&quot; character, calling him a &quot;sympathetic figure&quot; and saying in response to his fights against Voldemort that &quot;everybody loves an underdog story of good vs. evil&quot;.

On the other hand, he has received criticism. In 2010, he was voted the 35th &quot;Worst Briton&quot; in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;100 Worst Britons We Love to Hate&quot; programme. In &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, Ed Power called Harry an &quot;anointed cherub&quot; who is &quot;told he is special from the very outset&quot; before he has any &quot;winning attributes&quot;. Power said Harry is &quot;celebrated as an overachiever before he&#x27;s achieved anything&quot;. Lannah Marshall called Harry &quot;a bland character&quot;. She further described him as &quot;an audience surrogate, or what I call a &#x27;puppet protagonist&#x27;. A puppet protagonist is a main character with dull, limited personality, enabling the audience to step inside the role and use their imagination to fill in the rest.

Despite blowback from some Christian fundamentalists critical of Rowling&#x27;s usage of witchcraft and magic in the series, other Christian critics, including Rev. John Killinger, have argued that Potter is a Christ figure in the series. Killinger opined in 2002 that &quot;J.K. Rowling has written &quot;the&quot; Christ story of the 21st century, and it&#x27;s wonderful that she has attained such a magnificent following worldwide.&quot; He noted several allusions to Jesus in Potter&#x27;s character arcs in &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; and &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;. Rowling herself later admitted that the Gospel story inspired that of Harry Potter, especially with his ultimate sacrifice in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; and apparent death before returning to defeat Voldemort once and for all.

==In popular culture==
Wizard rock bands like Harry and the Potters dress up like Harry Potter, sporting painted forehead scars, black wigs, and round bottle top glasses. Wizard rock is a musical movement dating from 2002 that consists of at least 200 bands made up of young musicians, playing songs about &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. The movement started in Massachusetts with the band Harry and the Potters, who cosplay as Harry during live performances.

===Parodies===
In April 2009, a group of University of Michigan students eventually known as StarKid Productions performed &quot;Harry Potter: The Musical&quot;, a two-act musical parody that featured major elements from all seven books and an original score. They posted the entire musical on their YouTube channel but removed it in late June, to edit some more mature elements from the videos. The musical, re-titled &quot;A Very Potter Musical&quot;, was reposted on 5 July 2009, starring Darren Criss as Harry Potter. A sequel was premiered at the 2010 HPEF Harry Potter Conference Infinitus, and released on YouTube on 22 July at 8 pm EST. The sequel was called &quot;A Very Potter Sequel&quot; and featured the Death Eaters using the Time-Turner to go back in time to Harry&#x27;s first year in Hogwarts. Harry Potter is spoofed in the &quot;Barry Trotter&quot; series by American writer Michael Gerber, where a &quot;Barry Trotter&quot; appears as the eponymous antihero. On his homepage, Gerber describes Trotter as an unpleasant character who &quot;drinks too much, eats like a pig, sleeps until noon, and owes everybody money&quot;. The author stated &quot;[s]ince I really liked Rowling&#x27;s books ... I felt obligated to try to write a spoof worthy of the originals&quot;.

<text>26 Proserpina is a main-belt asteroid discovered by German astronomer R. Luther on May 5, 1853. It is named after the Roman goddess Proserpina, the daughter of Ceres and the Queen of the Underworld. Another main-belt asteroid, 399 Persephone, discovered in 1895, is named after her Greek counterpart. Its historical symbol was a star inside a pomegranate; it is in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1CECD 𜻍 ().

This object is orbiting the Sun with a period of 4.33 years. It has a cross-section size of around 90 km and a stony (S-type) composition. Photometric observations of this asteroid have produced discrepant estimates of the rotation period. A period of 12.13 hours was reported in 1979, followed by 10.6 hours in 1981 and 6.67 hours in 2001. Observations made in 2007 at the Oakley Observatory in Terre Haute, Indiana produced a light curve with a period of 13.06 ± 0.03 hours and a brightness variation of 0.21 ± 0.01 in magnitude. This was refined by a 2008 study, giving a period of 13.110 ± 0.001 hours.

His breakthrough role was that of aspiring Navy pilot Sid Worley in &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; (1982), for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award.

He played opposite child-star Drew Barrymore in the 1984 thriller &quot;Firestarter&quot; and Brooke Shields in 1992&#x27;s &quot;Running Wild&quot;. He is also well known for his role as Jack Parkman in Major League II starring Charlie Sheen and Tom Berenger.

Keith played Elvis Presley in the 1988 film &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;. He directed &quot;The Curse&quot; and &quot;The Further Adventures of Tennessee Buck&quot; (in which he also starred). He appeared in &quot;Ernest Goes to School&quot; as Squint Westwood (a spoof of Clint Eastwood) and in &quot;The Indian in the Cupboard&quot; as the cowboy &quot;Boo-Hoo&quot; Boone. He played the leading role of Nate Springfield in the 2003 film &quot;Hangman&#x27;s Curse&quot;.

Keith was a National Advisory Board member and spokesperson for PROTECT: The National Association to Protect Children. Keith was present during the sentencing phase for John Couey, who was convicted of kidnapping, raping, and murdering Jessica Lunsford. Keith said that he was planning on going to Washington, D.C., with Mark Lunsford after the sentencing, to lobby Congress for more support of sex offender laws. Keith gave an interview with Tampa Bay ABC affiliate WFTS-TV, and was quoted as saying:One of the great things I said about Mark (Lunsford) is he wants justice and he wants closure in this; he wants justice for his daughter. But what he really wants is to protect children and if we can get child molesters in jail, that&#x27;s the way you protect children!

<text>27 Euterpe is a stony asteroid and parent body of the Euterpe family, located in the inner asteroid belt, approximately 100 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by English astronomer John Russell Hind at George Bishop&#x27;s Observatory in London on 8 November 1853. The asteroid was named after Euterpe, the Muse of music in Greek mythology.

&quot;Euterpe&quot; is one of the brightest asteroids in the night sky. It had an apparent magnitude of 8.5 during a perihelic opposition on 25 December 2015 when the asteroid was about 1 AU from Earth. At the end of November 2022 it passed about 1.5 degrees from Uranus while in the constellation of Aries. Based on the S-type spectra the composition appears stony. It has a cross-section size of around 100–120 km. 27 Euterpe is orbiting the Sun with a period of 3.59 years and is spinning on its axis once every 10.4 hours.

It is the parent body of the Euterpe family (), a stony inner-belt asteroid family of nearly 400 known members. &quot;Euterpe&quot; has been studied by radar.

<text>The Iceland Defense Force (; IDF) was a military sub-unified command of the United States Department of Defense. It existed from 1951 to 2006. It came into existence when the United States agreed to provide for the defense of Iceland, which has only limited defense forces.

The IDF was composed of United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, and United States Air Force personnel as well as local Icelandic civilians. In the 1950s, there were United States Army field forces stationed in Iceland, and the first commander of the IDF was a U.S. Army brigadier general. By the 1980s the IDF only included a few U.S. Army and, in addition, some United States Coast Guard personnel.

== Organization ==
The IDF was formally headquartered at Naval Air Station Keflavik, though its base was actually at Miðnesheiði near Keflavík. 

The initial personnel of the Iceland Defence Force &quot;..arrived on 7 May 1951, commanded by an Army brigadier general responsible to the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic, for NATO operations and to the Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic, for tactical operations and control.&quot; Brig. Gen. Edward J. McGaw was the first commander.

In 1955, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Barrier Force, Atlantic had been established in Argentia, Newfoundland, to fly early-warning missions using the WV-2 (EC-121 Warning Star) radar aircraft over the North Atlantic. These aircraft made frequent deployments to Keflavik. On July 1, 1961, Commander Barrier Force, Atlantic moved from Argentia to Keflavik. The duties of Commander, Iceland Defense Force were assumed by the rear admiral commanding Barrier Force Atlantic. By the 1980s, Commander, Iceland Defense Force was a U.S. Navy Rear Admiral with three other titles and roles: Commander, Iceland Sector ASW Group (CTG-84.1), Commander, Fleet Air Keflavik, and NATO Island Commander Iceland. Commander Fleet Air Keflavik (COMFAIRKEF) was the senior Navy command in Iceland, responsible for the operational readiness of Navy units assigned. The commander of Fleet Air Keflavik was the operational commander in charge of all Navy and anti-submarine warfare operations. Administratively, he reported to Commander, Naval Air Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet, located in Norfolk, Virginia.

The IDF remained a subordinate of United States Atlantic Command (LANTCOM) after 1951 for a long period. In 1999, LANTCOM was renamed and reorganized as United States Joint Forces Command. The IDF remained under U.S. Joint Forces Command from 1999 to 2002. From October 2002 until its disbandment, it was under the control of the United States European Command.

From 1951 to 1959, a secret ban was imposed by the Icelandic government on the stationing of black US troops in Iceland. This ban was disclosed in late 1959. The Icelandic government relented somewhat from this policy in 1961, when it declared that it &quot;will not oppose the inclusion of three or four colored soldiers in the Defense Force, but hopes that they will be carefully selected&quot;. The number of black troops increased gradually throughout the 1960s, and all restrictions were most likely unofficially withdrawn in the 1970s or 1980s.

There were more than 25 different commands of various sizes attached to the Iceland Defense Force. Although staffing varied over the years, it was approximately 1350 U.S. military personnel (not including Reservists), 100 Department of Defense civilians, and 650 Icelanders, both civilians and firemen given military training manning the local Naval Firefighting team, as well as military members from Norway, Denmark, Canada, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom worked on NAS Keflavik. A contingent of the United States Marine Corps was responsible for ground defense.

The U.S. Air Force component of the force was the 85th Group. The air forces stationed in Iceland included a rotational P-3 Orion patrol squadron deployed forward from the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Patrol Wings Atlantic, and the F-15s of the 85th Group. Commander Dennis Corrigan, Fleet Air Keflavik&#x27;s operations officer, commented to &quot;Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly&quot; in 1996 that &quot;Keflavik is the only place where a US Navy flag officer has both P-3s and USAF F-15s working for him. ... We have developed a joint tactical doctrine: F-15s providing air superiority to allow the P-3 to do its job, whether its mining, anti-submarine warfare or something else.&quot; With the reduction in Patrol Wings Atlantic to ultimately seven squadrons by 1994, commitments at NAS Roosevelt Roads and Sigonella were reallocated, with Patrol Wings, Pacific taking up the Caribbean tasking to allow a full complement of P-3s in Sicily.

In the event of a major ground threat, the Army component, U.S. Army Iceland (ARICE), would have mobilized and become responsible for the ground defense of Iceland. ARICE consisted almost entirely of reserve components (from 1963 until 1994, the main formation was the Army Reserve&#x27;s 187th Infantry Brigade) in the United States, and limited numbers of personnel participated in on-site training maneuvers. Logistical support was to be provided by the 167th Support Group (Corps), another Army Reserve unit. Neither the 187th Infantry Brigade nor the 167th Support Group were ever deployed to Iceland.

From 1970 to 2006, the Iceland Defense Force provided between 2% and 5% of Iceland&#x27;s GDP.

== Exercises ==

Operation Nordic Shield II was held in the summer of 1992. As they did five years before, units of the 94th Army Reserve Command; principally the 187th Infantry Brigade (Separate), the 167th Support Group (Corps) and their subordinate battalions and companies; deployed to Canadian Forces Base Gagetown in southern New Brunswick, to simulate the defense of Iceland against Warsaw Pact forces, the CAPSTONE mission of both the 187th and 167th. Part of the 1992 exercise included lanes training as part of the United States Army Forces Command&#x27;s &quot;Bold Shift&quot; initiative to reinforce unit war-fighting task proficiency.

Operation Northern Viking is a series of defense of Iceland exercises, held biennially for several years. In 2006 the frequency was increased.

== Termination ==

On 15 March 2006, the U.S. Ambassador to Iceland Carol van Voorst announced the decision of the United States to withdraw the Iceland Defense Force before the end of September 2006. On September 30, the American military withdrew its final four Air Force fighter jets and a rescue helicopter squadron from Keflavík. Although NAS Keflavík has closed and the American military has left Iceland, the United States is still responsible for defending its ally and the facilities at Keflavík will still be available, in the event that a &quot;surged expeditionary presence&quot; is deemed necessary.

The Icelandic defence contractor Kögun (now part of Advania) has been contracted to operate and service U.S. Navy communications equipment and facilities left behind.

It was reported in February 2016 that the US Navy would return to Iceland to track Russian submarines.

<doc id="727862" wikidata="Q1890473" url="?curid=727862" title="Osibisa">
<text>Osibisa is a British-Ghanaian-Caribbean Afro rock band founded in London in the late 1960s by four expatriate West African and three London based Caribbean musicians. 

Osibisa was the most successful and longest lived of the African-heritage bands in London, alongside such contemporaries as Assagai, Chris McGregor&#x27;s Brotherhood of Breath, Demon Fuzz, Black Velvet, and Noir, and was largely responsible for the establishment of world music and Afro rock as a marketable genre.

The original band that featured on the first three studio albums was universally known as the &quot;Beautiful Seven&quot;, also a song on their album &quot;Woyaya&quot;.

==History==
In Ghana in the 1950s, Teddy Osei (saxophone), Solomon (Sol) Amarfio (drums), Mamon Shareef, and Farhan Freere (flute) played in a highlife band called The Star Gazers. They left to form the Comets, with Osei&#x27;s brother Mac Tontoh on trumpet, and scored a hit in West Africa with their 1958 song &quot;(I Feel) Pata Pata&quot;. In 1962, Osei moved to London to study music on a scholarship from the Ghanaian government. In 1964 he formed Cat&#x27;s Paw, an early &quot;world music&quot; band that combined highlife, rock, and soul. In 1969, Osei persuaded Amarfio and Tontoh to join him in London, and Osibisa was born. The name Osibisa was described in lyrics, album notes and interviews as meaning &quot;criss-cross rhythms that explode with happiness&quot; but it actually comes from &quot;osibisaba&quot; the Fante word for highlife.

Joining the three Ghanaians in the first incarnation were Antiguan Wendell (Dell) Richardson (lead guitar and lead vocalist), Nigerian Lasisi Amao (percussionist and tenor saxophone), Grenadian Roger Bedeau, also known as Spartacus R (bass), and Trinidadian Robert Bailey (keyboards). Nigerians Fred Coker and Mike Odumosu (bass guitar) were later replacements.

The band spent much of the 1970s touring the world, playing to large audiences in Japan, Australasia, India, and Africa. During this time Paul Golly (guitar) and Ghanaians Daku Adams &quot;Potato&quot; and Kiki Gyan were also members of the band. In January 1976, their single, &quot;Sunshine Day&quot;, reached number 17 on the UK Singles Chart. Their next single release, &quot;Dance the Body Music&quot;, peaked at number 31 in the same listing. In 1980, Osibisa performed at a special Zimbabwean independence celebration, and in 1983 were filmed onstage at the Marquee Club in London but by this time were a distant version of the original band.

Osibisa had an important series of gigs in India in 1981, culminating in the release of the &quot;Unleashed – Live in India&quot; album. The band engaged in a return to India, performing at the November Fest 2010 on 28 November 2010, at the Corporation Kalaiarangam in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu.

Changes in the music industry meant declining sales for the band, and a series of label changes resulted. Some of the band returned to Ghana to set up a recording studio and theatre complex to help younger highlife musicians. 

In the 1990s, their music was anthologised in many CD collections, with some of them allegedly unauthorised and paying no royalties to the band. However, this has been disputed by Osei, who, along with Amarfio and Tontoh, ran the band from the 1980s onwards.

In the early 1990s, Osei regrouped the band, and many of their past recordings released legally on CD. This included a remaster series with bonus material and hitherto unreleased material and live concerts on the Red Steel / Flying Elephant label collaboration. 

Osei regrouped a version of the band in 1994 after commencing work with two UK labels: Castle Communications (who had the licensing rights to the Buddah catalogue and some of the Bronze Records catalogue) and Red Steel Music, who specialised in remastering and reissuing albums on CD. With a new producer and label behind him, Osei progressed to record new material, culminating in the 1995 release of &quot;Monsore&quot;, the band&#x27;s first album of new material since the late 1980s &quot;Movements&quot; album. 

The revitalised band with Osei at the helm commenced touring and recording, until Osei&#x27;s stroke some fifteen years later. Osei cut back his touring schedule due to the effects of his illness but still continued to record until 2018. 

Various new recording and release projects were carried out from the mid-1990s onwards with remastered, remixed and re-recorded projects seeing the light of day. This included previously unreleased material from the &quot;African Flight&quot; period, the incomplete follow-up which had a working title of &quot;African Dawn&quot;, live projects including &quot;Live at Cropredy&quot; (the bands first live album in fifteen years) followed by the semi acoustic live offering recorded at London&#x27;s famous Jazz Cafe, &quot;Aka Ka Kra&quot;. 

Work commenced on more studio material that remains unissued to this day. A new studio album, &quot;Osee Yee&quot;, was released in 2009. 

After the removal of personnel by Osei in 2014/15, a new recording project with Osei at the helm commenced in late 2015, shortly after the successful placement of material that was chosen for Richard Linklater&#x27;s film &quot;Boyhood&quot;. However, apart from one track included on the band&#x27;s 2020 &quot;Sunshine Day: The Boyhood Sessions&quot; album, the recordings featuring Osei remain unreleased. Recent announcements from the Osei’s management and the band indicate these tracks will make an appearance in 2025 along with an album of previously unreleased material from earlier years that Osei had started work on in 2016. 

Ace Ghanaian hip-hop music producer Hammer of The Last Two stated that his debut production, Obrafour&#x27;s &quot;Pae Mu Ka&quot; album, which is the highest selling hiplife album to date, was inspired by Osibisa&#x27;s song &quot;Welcome Home.&quot; He also had the chance to work with Kiki Gyan a few days before his death. 

On 13 December 2022, drummer and founding member Sol Amarfio died at the age of 84.

In June 2023, long-time Osibisa bass player, sometimes keyboard player and producer Victor Mensah died at the age of 66, after a protracted illness.

Founding member Teddy Osei, singer, saxophonist and drummer, died on January 14, 2025, in London. He was 88.

==Artistry==
===Music===
Osibisa has been credited with introducing African music to European and North American audiences with their fusion of African and Western music styles. The band&#x27;s style encompasses elements of rock, progressive rock, acid rock, Latin, jazz, afro-funk, jazz fusion, soul, highlife, reggae, calypso and pop. This style has been classified as afro rock, progressive rock, Afro-pop, and highlife. &quot;Mystic Energy&quot; saw the band shifting away from their trademark sound, in favor of R&amp;B, dance-pop and disco.

===Album covers===
Their first two albums featured artwork by the progressive rock artist Roger Dean (before he became widely known for his artwork), depicting the flying elephants which became the symbol for the band. The third album, &quot;Heads&quot;, features a cover by Mati Klarwein, known for his covers of Santana’s &quot;Abraxas&quot; and Miles Davis&#x27; &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;. &quot;Osibirock&quot;, the band&#x27;s sixth studio release featured &quot;Negro Attacked by a Jaguar&quot; (1910) by Henri Rousseau. Playing on the original flying elephants theme, the &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot; set features elephants with tank turrets for heads, an early Roger Dean idea reborn for the project. In 2009, their &quot;Osee Yee&quot; album featured the flying elephants once more, this time painted by Freyja Dean (Dean&#x27;s daughter). Roger Dean&#x27;s logo for the band continues to be used on many of the releases comprising classic material. Artwork for many of the reissues and 1990s material onwards was put together by Frank McPartland, Andrew Buckle and the Grammy Award winning designer Rachel Gutek and her Guppy Art company.

<text>RMI, or Rocky Mountain Institute, is a global, independent, non-partisan non-profit organization founded in the United States by Amory Lovins dedicated to research, publication, consulting, and lecturing in the field of sustainability, with a focus on profitable innovations for energy and resource efficiency. The Rocky Mountain Institute was established in 1982 and has grown into a broad-based institution with over 600 staff and an annual budget of $120+ million. RMI&#x27;s work is independent and non-adversarial, with an emphasis on market-based solutions. 

The institute, which includes the Carbon War Room (which merged with RMI in December 2014), operates many global programs.

RMI is headquartered in Basalt, Colorado, and also maintains offices in Boulder, Colorado; New York City; Washington, D.C.; Oakland, California; and Beijing, China.

==History==
By 1978, experimental physicist Amory Lovins had published many books, consulted widely, and was active in energy affairs in some fifteen countries as a synthesist and lobbyist. Lovins is the leading proponent of the soft energy path.

Later in 1979, Lovins married L. Hunter Sheldon, a lawyer, forester, and social scientist. Hunter received her undergraduate degree in sociology and political studies from Pitzer College, and her J.D. from Loyola Marymount&#x27;s School of Law. In 1982, Amory and Hunter founded Rocky Mountain Institute, based in Colorado. Together with a group of colleagues, the Lovinses fostered efficient resource use and policy development that they believed would promote global security. RMI ultimately grew into an organization with a staff of around fifty. By the mid-1980s, the Lovinses were featured on major network TV programs, such as &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

The Lovins described the &quot;hard energy path&quot; as involving inefficient liquid-fuel automotive transport, as well as giant centralized electricity-generating facilities, often burning fossil fuels such as coal or petroleum, or harnessing a fission reaction, greatly complicated by electricity wastage and loss. The &quot;soft energy path&quot; which they wholly preferred involves efficient use of energy, diversity of energy production methods (and matched in scale and quality to end uses), and special reliance on &quot;soft technologies&quot; (alternative technology) such as solar, wind, biofuels, and geothermal. According to the institute, large-scale electricity production facilities had an important place, but it was a place that they were already filling in the middle 1970s; in general, more would not be needed. In a 1989 speech, Amory Lovins introduced the related concept of Negawatt power, in which creating a market for trading increased efficiency could supply additional electrical energy to consumers without increasing generation capacity—such as building more power plants.

In recent years, RMI has convened a team of designers and engineers to develop a super-efficient prototype automobile, which they have dubbed the Hypercar.

In December 2014, RMI merged with Carbon War Room, an organization with similar goals but a different approach. In June 2017, RMI merged with WattTime, an organization providing real-time power plant data to consumer devices for automatic dispatchable power consumption. RMI, in 2021, launched Canary Media, a nonprofit newsroom covering the clean energy transition.

In 2021, the Rocky Mountain Institute rebranded itself as RMI. 

== Programs ==
RMI operates programs in many countries:

* Carbon-Free Electricity
* Carbon-Free Buildings
* Carbon-Free Mobility
* Climate-Aligned Industries
* Breakthrough Technologies
* Climate Intelligence
* Urban Transformation
* Strategic Analysis &amp; Engagement
* Global South
* China Program
* India Program
* US Program.

== Electric vehicles ==
In January 2008, led by John E. Waters, Bright Automotive launched from RMI with the goal of building on the work of a consortium of organizations, including Alcoa, Google.org, Johnson Controls and the Turner Foundation.

Bright Automotive sought with its Bright IDEA project to develop a brand new, plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV) fleet vehicle. It launched Bright eSolutions to consult on engineering, design, powertrain, battery technology and plug-in hybrid conversion technology services. Bright Automotive secured a conversion contract with the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) to convert military non-combat vehicles into a parallel PHEV for evaluation, including V2G testing. The venture failed.

Advanced Energy, in partnership with RMI, announced a Request for Information (RFI) for Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) specific to charging stations for plug-in electric vehicles (EV).

==Books==

Books published by RMI include:

*&quot;Winning the Oil Endgame: Innovation for Profit, Jobs and Security&quot; (2005) (Available Online in PDF)
*&quot;Small is Profitable: The Hidden Economic Benefits of Making Electrical Resources the Right Size&quot; (2003) 
*&quot;Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution&quot; (2000) 
*&quot;Reinventing Fire: Bold Business Solutions for the New Energy Era&quot; (2011) .

== Recognition ==
Co-founder Amory Lovins received many awards.

<text>Jacques Joachim Yhombi-Opango (12 January 1939 – 30 March 2020) was a Congolese politician. He was an army officer who became Congo-Brazzaville&#x27;s first general and served as Head of State of the People&#x27;s Republic of the Congo from 1977 to 1979. He was the President of the Rally for Democracy and Development (RDD), a political party, and served as Prime Minister from 1993 to 1996. He was in exile from 1997 to 2007.

==Early life==
Yhombi-Opango was born on 12 January 1939 in Fort Rousset (now Owando) in Cuvette Region, in the north of the Congo. He married Marie-Noëlle Ngollo, with whom he had several children.

== Career ==
Under President Marien Ngouabi, Yhombi-Opango was Army Chief of Staff (with the rank of major); he was suspended from that position on 30 July 1970, but subsequently restored to it. He was a member of the ruling Congolese Labour Party (PCT) and was associated with the party&#x27;s right-wing. Leftist elements in the PCT claimed in a broadcast on Voice of the Revolution radio on 22 February 1972 that Yhombi-Opango was trying to take power in a rightist coup and that he had ordered the arrest of members of the PCT Political Bureau. This claim was part of an unsuccessful leftist coup attempt led by Lieutenant Ange Diawara. Yhombi-Opango became a member of the Central Committee of the PCT in 1972. He was then promoted to the rank of Colonel and became a member of the PCT&#x27;s Political Bureau in January 1973. He served as Secretary-General of the Council of State until being moved to the post of Council of State delegate in charge of Defence on 9 November 1974.

=== President ===
Following the assassination of Ngouabi in March 1977, Yhombi-Opango became Head of State. He served in office for nearly two years until being forced to resign in February 1979. Accused of attempting to form a &quot;rightist faction&quot; in the PCT, he was subsequently held in detention for several years by his successor, President Denis Sassou Nguesso. In addition to being placed under house arrest, he was expelled from the PCT and his property was confiscated in 1979; furthermore, he was demoted from the rank of general to that of private, according to an announcement on 20 October 1979. Sassou Nguesso announced Yhombi-Opango&#x27;s release when the former was sworn in for a second term as president on 10 November 1984, citing &quot;the interest of national unity and peace&quot;.

In July 1987, 20 officers were arrested for allegedly plotting a coup, and a commission investigating the plot implicated Yhombi-Opango, along with Captain Pierre Anga. In September 1987, Yhombi-Opango was arrested in connection with this plot. Sassou Nguesso announced his release, along with all other political prisoners, on 14 August 1990, in a move marking the 30th anniversary of Congolese independence. At the February–June 1991 National Conference, some delegates accused Yhombi-Opango and Sassou Nguesso of complicity in Ngouabi&#x27;s assassination.

=== Prime minister ===
Afterwards, Yhombi-Opango was the candidate of his party, the Rally for Democracy and Development (RDD), in the August 1992 presidential election, taking sixth place with 3.49% of the vote. In his native Cuvette Region, he placed second, with 27% of the vote, behind Sassou Nguesso. He allied with President Pascal Lissouba and Lissouba&#x27;s party, the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy (UPADS), in the first round of the 1993 parliamentary election, held in May, and after the election Lissouba appointed him as Prime Minister on 23 June 1993. The opposition contested the results, however, and a severe political dispute erupted, with the opposition setting up a rival government. Yhombi-Opango resigned on 13 January 1995 so that Lissouba would be free to consult other parties in the formation of a new government; he was promptly reappointed as Prime Minister, with a new government—including four members of the opposition Union for Democratic Renewal (URD)—being named on 23 January.

Some members of UPADS who were from Lissouba&#x27;s own Téke ethnic group called for Yhombi-Opango&#x27;s resignation in 1996 because they wanted the Prime Minister to be a Téke as well. As a result, Yhombi-Opango resigned on 23 August 1996; Lissouba appointed Charles David Ganao to replace him on 27 August.

Sassou-Nguesso&#x27;s visit to Owando, Yhombi-Opango&#x27;s political stronghold, in May 1997 led to an outbreak of violence between his supporters and those of Yhombi-Opango. Following this incident, a civil war began in June, leading to Lissouba&#x27;s ouster in October 1997; Yhombi-Opango supported Lissouba during the war, serving as leader of the Presidential Majority, and after Sassou-Nguesso&#x27;s victory he fled into exile in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and France.

=== Exile ===
In December 2001, Yhombi-Opango joined two other exiled politicians, Lissouba and Bernard Kolélas, in rejecting the electoral process begun under Sassou-Nguesso, saying that it was not transparent. Along with Lissouba and Kolélas, he called for a passive boycott of the January 2002 constitutional referendum.

Yhombi-Opango was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; to 20 years of hard labor for embezzlement in late December 2001. Also convicted in this trial were Lissouba (who received a 30-year sentence) and three other former members of the government (former prime minister Claude Antoine Dacosta, former Minister of Finance Nguila Mougounga Nkombo, and former Minister of Oil Benoit Koukebene). The charge of embezzlement was based on an accusation that Lissouba, Yhombi-Opango, and the others made a corrupt deal with Occidental Petroleum to sell oil to the company for 150 million US dollars in 1993; the sum was said to amount to less than a fourth of the oil&#x27;s actual value. The money from this deal was allegedly never placed in the Treasury; instead, part of the money was said to have been placed in a private bank account in Belgium, while the remainder was said to have been used for electoral campaigning. Claudine Munari, who had been Director of the Cabinet, said in defense of the accused that there was no alternative to the deal and that the money was actually used to pay wage arrears and organize the 1993 parliamentary election. The accused were also charged with misappropriating public funds, but this charge did not result in a conviction.

A dispute in the RDD leadership emerged in 2005. Yhombi-Opango, still in exile, asked the party leadership in Congo-Brazzaville to approach the governing PCT, but Saturnin Okabé, who led the party in Yhombi-Opango&#x27;s absence, refused to do so. Yhombi-Opango reacted angrily to this refusal.

=== Return ===
An amnesty for Yhombi-Opango was approved by the Congolese Council of Ministers on 18 May 2007. He returned to Congo-Brazzaville on 10 August 2007, and a thousand of his supporters were present to welcome him. At a meeting of the RDD Steering Committee on 8 September 2007, Yhombi-Opango reassumed the leadership of the party from interim president Saturnin Okabé and Secretary-General Martial Mathieu Kani. On this occasion, Yhombi-Opango announced his intention to reorganize the party and improve its position on the national political scene.

Yhombi-Opango and his wife divided their time between Congo and France from 2007 until his death in 2020.
== Personal life ==
Yhombi-Opango spent over a year in France for medical reasons before returning to Brazzaville on 1 June 2013.

Joachim Yhombi-Opango died on 30 March 2020, at the American Hospital of Paris in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, from COVID-19 at the age of 81. His son, Jean-Jacques Yhombi Opango, first confirmed his death during a phone call with &quot;Agence France-Presse&quot;. &quot;Télé Congo&quot;, the country&#x27;s national television station, re-confirmed the information during its evening news show.

He was buried in Owando, Congo, on 31 October 2020.

<text>The Paria River is a tributary of the Colorado River, approximately long, in southern Utah and northern Arizona in the United States. It drains a rugged and arid region northwest of the Colorado, flowing through roadless slot canyons along part of its course.

== Geography ==

It is formed in southern Utah, in southwestern Garfield County from several creeks that descend from the edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau, meeting just north of Tropic. It flows SSE across Kane County and Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument. Along the Arizona state line, it descends through the Vermilion Cliffs in the Paria Canyon and onto the Paria Plateau. It joins the Colorado from the northwest approximately 5 mi (8 km) southwest of Page, Arizona and the Glen Canyon Dam. The lower 20 mi (32 km) of the river are within the Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness, which is administered by the Bureau of Land Management; a permit is required for any overnight visit. The Paria is essentially a large creek and is not navigable.

A 2004 study estimated that the Tropic Ditch, a historic artificial irrigation canal that diverts water from the East Fork Sevier River, loses 1060 acre-feet per year to seepage, and half of that seepage (530 acre-feet per year) ends up in the Paria River, bringing with it 1829 tons of salt per year. To help restore the salinity of the Paria and Colorado Rivers to more natural levels, the Tropic and East Fork Irrigation Company have proposed replacing the last 5.5 miles of the ditch with a pipeline. The cost may be supplemented by a grant from the Bureau of Reclamation&#x27;s Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Program.

== Attractions ==

The Paria is one of the most popular destinations for canyoneering in the region. Buckskin Gulch, a side canyon along the river in the narrows section, is considered to be one of the longest and deepest slot canyons in the United States. The Paria is also home to several important historical, geological, and biological resources. Lee&#x27;s Ferry and the adjoining settlement are located within the canyon upstream of the confluence with the Colorado River, with several other abandoned settlements further north. The Paria and several nearby rivers and canyons also are the site of several well-preserved specimens of Native American petroglyphs, prehistoric drawings, and symbols carved into stone. The Paria boasts a vibrant desert riparian habitat that is home to several sensitive and endangered species and is also the location of Wrather Arch, the longest natural arch outside of Utah (although this claim may be superseded by Aloba Arch).

About a mile south of the river and the ghost town of Paria is the Paria Movie Set which was the site for several western movies. The old film set in the canyon was a popular attraction but was damaged in a flash flood in 1998. The buildings were dismantled and rebuilt in a nearby location by volunteers. In 2006 these new buildings were destroyed in a suspicious fire.

<text>The Dardaim or Dor Daim (), are adherents of the Dor Deah movement in Orthodox Judaism. (; Hebrew: &quot;generation of knowledge&quot;, an allusion to the Israelites who witnessed the Exodus.) That movement took its name in 1912 in Yemen under Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ, and had its own network of synagogues and schools, although, in actuality, the movement existed long before that name had been coined for it. According to ethnographer and historian, Shelomo Dov Goitein, author and historiographer, Hayyim Habshush had been a member of this movement before it had been given the name &quot;Dor Deah&quot;, writing, “...He (i.e. Hayyim Habshush) and his friends, partly under European influence, but driven mainly by developments among the Yemenite Jews themselves, formed a group who ardently opposed all those forces of mysticism, superstition and fatalism which were then so prevalent in the country and strove for exact knowledge and independent thought, and the application of both to life.” It was only some years later, when Rabbi Yihya Qafih became the headmaster of the new Jewish school in Sana&#x27;a built by the Ottoman Turks and where he wanted to introduce a new curriculum in the school whereby boys would also learn arithmetic and the rudiments of the Arabic and Turkish languages that Rabbi Yihya Yitzhak Halevi gave to Rabbi Qafih&#x27;s movement the name &quot;Daradʻah&quot;, a word which is an Arabic broken plural made-up of the Hebrew words &quot;Dör Deʻoh&quot;, and which means &quot;Generation of Knowledge.&quot;

Its objects were:
#to combat the influence of the Zohar and subsequent developments in modern Kabbalah, which were then pervasive in Yemenite Jewish life, and which the Dor Daim believed to be irrational and idolatrous;
# to restore what they believed to be a rational approach to Judaism rooted in authentic sources, including the Talmud, Saadia Gaon and especially Maimonides;
#to safeguard the older (&quot;Baladi&quot;) tradition of Yemenite Jewish observance, which they believed to be based on this approach.

Today there is no official Dor Dai movement, but the term is used for individuals and synagogues within the Yemenite community (mostly in Israel) who share the original movement&#x27;s perspectives. There are also some groups, both within and outside the Yemenite community, holding a somewhat similar stance, who describe themselves as &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot; (disciples of Maimonides) rather than &quot;Dor Daim&quot;.

==History==

===Background: &quot;Baladi&quot; and &quot;Shami&quot; rituals===

Since the early Middle Ages the Yemenite Jewish community followed the teachings of Maimonides on almost all legal issues, and their prayer book was substantially identical to the text set out in his &quot;Sefer Ahavah&quot;. This is attested by the writings of several well known Rabbis such as Nahmanides, Obadiah of Bertinoro and the Maharitz. The Yemenite tradition is therefore separate from both the Sephardi and the Ashkenazi streams in Judaism.

In the 16th and 17th centuries the teachings of the Kabbalah, especially in the form advocated by Isaac Luria and his school, became increasingly popular in Yemen as in other countries. This did not always mean a change in the liturgy; Luria himself held that it was essential to keep to the form of prayers inherited from one&#x27;s ancestors, so that one&#x27;s prayers reached the gate in Heaven appropriate to one&#x27;s tribe. However, many individuals and communities around the world (principally Mizrahi Jews but also Ḥasidim) discarded their ancestral rites in favor of the modified Sephardic rite used by Luria and his immediate circle, on the reasoning that this form of prayer reached a &quot;thirteenth gate&quot; for those who did not know their tribe.

This division would be reflected among the Yemenite Jews. The Shami sub-group adopted a Sephardic-influenced rite, in no small part due to its essentially being forced upon them. Others retained the Yemenite ancestral liturgy, whether or not they accepted the Zoharic/Lurianic Kabbalah theologically. In the 18th century, to ensure the continued use of the Yemenite&#x27;s original text, Rabbi Yiḥyah Salaḥ (known as the Maharitz) promoted compromise and introduced a new edition of the Yemenite Jewish prayer book which he created. It substantially followed the traditional Yemenite (Maimonidean) ritual, but made some concessions to the Kabbalists, for example by incorporating the hymn Lechah Dodi. This new standard became known as &quot;Baladi&quot; (meaning &quot;of the country&quot;, i.e. Yemen), in contrast to the adopted Lurianic-Sephardic ritual which was known as &quot;Shami&quot; (literally &quot;northern&quot;, meaning Palestinian or Damascene). The distinction also affected questions of Jewish law, the Baladi community continued to follow Maimonides almost exclusively while the Shami community also accepted the Shulchan Aruch.

In the 18th century, Yemen produced an influential Kabbalist in Shalom Sharabi, who headed the Beit El Synagogue in Jerusalem, the elite seclusion centre for developing and praying in the Lurianic system. Over time more and more Kabbalistic practices became popular among the Yemenite Jews to the point that the &quot;Baladi&quot; community became localized as a significant population only around the area of Yemen&#x27;s capital city, Sana&#x27;a. Today, as the majority of Yemenite Jewry are outside of Yemen and in closer contact with Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews, it could be perceived that the proportion with which the Dor Daim perspective is spreading (though in a different form than the original) is not much different from the rate at which Yemenite Jews as a whole are giving up their unique traditions and assimilating into mainstream Judaism.

===Formation of movement===

&quot;Dor Daim&quot; emerged as a recognizable force in the later part of the 19th century. The Dor Daim movement was formed by individuals who were displeased by the influence of Kabbalah which had been introduced to Yemen in the 17th century. They believed that the core beliefs of Judaism were rapidly diminishing in favor of the mysticism of the Kabbalah. Displeased by the direction that education and the social development of Yemen was taking, they opened their own educational system in Yemen (see Dor Daim and Iqshim). They were also unhappy with the influence that Kabbalists (mystics) were having on various customs and rituals (e.g. the text of the prayer book), in addition to a strong superstitious influence which they saw as contrary to Maimonides. For example, Rabbi Yosef Qafeh relates one of many Yemenite customs for &quot;חינוך הבית&quot; whereby they would bake plain bread without salt and prepare &quot;the table of appeasement.&quot; Inviting more than 10 children aged seven or eight who waited outside, they set the table, scattering thin-ash upon it; crumbled the plain bread into bits, placing them upon the table holding the ashes; and exited the kitchen stating, to the demons (Hebrew: שדים), &quot;this is your portion.&quot; Shortly thereafter they would abruptly open its doors, whereupon the children burst in, grabbing the saltless pieces and eating them. Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafeh sharply opposed these &quot;minhagim&quot;, being of the opinion that, in addition to the stupidity of the matter, they are Biblically forbidden because of &quot;darchei haEmori&quot;.

The Dor Daim considered the Kabbalists to be irrational in attitude and felt that they were thereby contributing to a decline in the social and economic status of the Yemenite Jews. The above-mentioned issues led Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ to spearhead the Dor Daim movement. Among its goals was the revival and protection of what it saw as the original form of Judaism as codified by the Sanhedrin during the 1st through 3rd centuries.

The movement was not well received by some scholars in Yemen and Israel. Especially controversial were the views of the Dor Daim on the most popularized book of Kabbalah known as the Zohar. These views are put forth in a book called &quot;Milhamoth HaShem&quot; (Wars of the Lord). A group of Jerusalem rabbis published an attack on Rabbi Qafiḥ under the title of &quot;Emunat Hashem&quot; (Faith of the Lord), taking measures to ostracize members of the movement; notwithstanding, not even the Yemenite rabbis who opposed the dardaim heeded this ostracism. Instead, they intermarried, sat together in &quot;batei midrash&quot;, and continued to sit with Rabbi Yiḥyeh Qafeh in &quot;beth din&quot;.

From this time Yemenite Jews may be classified as Shami, mainstream Baladi and Dor Dai or &quot;Rambamist&quot;. A term frequently used by Dor Daim for Yemenites who accept the Zohar is &quot;Iqq&#x27;shim&quot; (Hebrew: עקשים), i.e., &quot;obscurantists&quot;.

An important later Yemenite authority was Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ&#x27;s grandson, Rabbi Yosef Qafiḥ, who edited many important works by Maimonides and Saadia Gaon (see his published works) as well as issuing two new editions of the Baladi prayer book. Unlike his grandfather he avoided expressing any opinion on the Zohar, beyond saying that it was preferable to draw one&#x27;s spiritual sustenance from the works of Maimonides. There is therefore some doubt about whether Rabbi Qafiḥ junior should be regarded as a Dor Dai or as a mainstream Baladi. His intention was probably to reconcile the two groups, in the same way as the Maharitz tried to reconcile traditionalists and Kabbalists.

===Dor Daim today===
There is no official Dor Dai organization; thus they are hard to identify. Many individuals are reluctant to identify themselves by that name for fear of persecution. Some of the original Dor Dai synagogues in Israel survive, but have moved nearer to the mainstream Baladi tradition in the same way as Rabbi Yosef Qafiḥ. Similarly, there is no universally recognized leader for the movement. The successor of Rabbi Yosef Qafiḥ as leader of the Yemenite community as a whole is generally considered to be Rabbi Ratzon Arusi of Qiryat Ono.

Today&#x27;s adherents have great respect for the Yemenite tradition in general, but they are not exclusively Yemenite in origin and may describe themselves as &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot; (disciples of Maimonides) rather than as &quot;Dor Daim.&quot; In 2005, there was a widely publicized gathering of hilltop settlers of Yemenite descent describing themselves as &quot;Dor Daim&quot;, but it is unclear how far these represent the historic Dor Dai movement.

==Beliefs==

===Theology===
Dor Daim place particular importance on the Jewish doctrine of the absolute unity of God, which they believe has been compromised by the popular forms of Kabbalah prevalent today. In support of this, they appeal to the philosophical writings of various Geonim and Rishonim such as Saadia Gaon, Rabbenu Bahya ibn Paquda, Rabbi Yehuda Halevi and Maimonides. The following points concerning the Almighty&#x27;s Unity are in particular emphasized both by Dor Daim and &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot;:

Note: None of these is controversial, as mainstream Judaism has substantially the same beliefs.

* He is Incomparable to any created thing
* He is neither male nor female, but due to the limitations of human speech we must use certain terms allegorically and metaphorically to some extent in order to convey the fact that He &quot;does&quot; exist
* His existence is qualitatively different from all other existences, and all other existences depend upon Him and are sustained by Him, while He remains infinitely and unfathomably distinct and independent from all creation
* He is &quot;one&quot; unity unlike any unity in creation; His Oneness is not a unity which can be divided or which is composed of parts, both of which could only be the case with a unity that is subject to time/space; Nor is His Oneness a one in the sense of a species or type.
* No quality of creation applies to Him: not space, not time, not change, no concept of a body, form, or image, no concept of filling a body, form, or any location, nor any other factor of creation - for He is Perfect and Sufficient in Himself and has no need for any of these. He is not a force or a power which possess or fills something else, nor is there any aspect of multiplicity in Him - as would be the case were the world literally to be within Him. Any Biblical or Talmudic phrases which seem to imply that any quality of creation applies to Him must be understood as having some meaning other than its literal meaning, for He transcends all aspects of creation. None of them are applicable to Him.
* The Splendor of the Reality of His Being is so great that no mind can grasp even the smallest part of it, for He has no parts, as it says, &quot;..and to His Greatness there is no investigating.&quot; (Psalms 145:3) Therefore, one must always be aware that the sublime Truth of His Being transcends anything we can ever express, but that all references to Him are either by speaking of what He is not or by way of literary tools such as metaphor.

===Attitude to Kabbalah===

In the book &quot;Milhamoth HaShem&quot;, one finds that possibly the most fundamental issue the Dor Daim had (and have) with the popularly accepted understanding of Kabbalah concerns the absolute transcendent Singularity/Oneness of the Creator and the laws against &quot;avodah zarah&quot; (forbidden forms of devotion/idolatry). The Dor Daim believe that the popular forms of Kabbalah prevalent today are contrary to the absolute and incomparable Unity of the Creator and violate various laws against idolatry and polytheism, in particular the prohibition against &quot;Ribbuy Reshuyoth&quot; (worshipping or conceiving of a multiplicity of reigns) referred to by Maimonides in his Mishneh Torah. 

The issue is not the existence of Kabbalah as such. The &quot;word&quot; &quot;Kabbalah&quot; is used in older Jewish sources and by Maimonides to simply mean &quot;tradition&quot; and need not refer to mysticism of any kind. Furthermore, Dor Daim accept that in Talmudic times there was a secret mystical tradition in Judaism, known as &quot;Maaseh Bereshith&quot; (the work of creation) and &quot;Maaseh Merkavah&quot; (the work of the chariot); Maimonides interprets these as respectively referring to something similar to Aristotelian physics and metaphysics as interpreted in the light of Torah. They simply reject the notion that this tradition is represented by the ideas popularly referred to as Kabbalah in our days. 

Neither Dor Daim nor &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot; are against mysticism per se. Rabbi Yosef Qafiḥ, for example, published the ancient mystical text &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; together with his translation of Saadia Gaon&#x27;s commentary. Likewise, Bahya ibn Paquda and Abraham son of Maimonides (sometimes described as &quot;Jewish Sufis&quot;) are especially respected among Dor Daim and &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot;. 

In particular a Dor Dai is not bound to reject the theory of the ten Sefirot, as set out in the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;. In the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;, unlike in later Kabbalah, there is no question of the Sefirot being Divine entities or even attributes: they are simply the numerals, considered as the dimensional parameters used in the creation of the world. 

What they view as the problem comes in with the Sefer ha-Bahir and the Zohar, where the Sefirot have become hypostatized as Divine attributes or emanations, and it seems that religious devotions can never be addressed directly to the &quot;En Sof&quot; (the Absolute) but only through one or other of the Sefirot; and in modern &quot;Edot ha-Mizrach&quot; prayer books each occurrence of the Divine Name is vocalized differently in a kind of code to show which Sefirah one should have in mind. This problem is compounded in the teachings of Isaac Luria as found in the writings of Ḥayim Vital, where it is held that as a result of some catastrophe in Heaven, the Sefirot vessels have fractured and their channels re-formed into a variously stated number of inter-relating personalised aspects within God&#x27;s Manifestation known as Partzufim (from Greek πρόσωπα, faces), teaching that the purpose of each religious observance is to assist their unification. This is felt as being uncomfortably close to polytheism. 

The original Dor Daim, such as Yiḥyah Qafiḥ, condemned the Zohar as an outright forgery and as filled with idolatry. Some of today&#x27;s Dor Daim take a somewhat more moderate stance, allowing that the Zohar may contain elements of authentic Midrash together with a great deal of later interpolation, while considering the Zohar in its present form to be an unsafe guide, both to theology and to practice. Other segments of Orthodox Judaism which share this perspective of the Dor Daim, while not necessarily rejecting the Zohar itself, include most &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot; (disciples of Maimonides), as well as portions of the Modern Orthodox community and others. Those among these groups who do not reject the Zohar assert that the Kabbalah as popularly taught today represents a distortion of the Zohar&#x27;s intended teachings. However, the specific issues identified by the Dor Daim remain in all current and older editions of the Zohar.

===Heresy===
A figure spoken of frequently in the esoteric works on Kabbalah, particularly in the Zohar, is what has come to be known as the &quot;lesser countenance&quot; (Aramaic: זעיר אנפין), which term and its usage is believed to have been of Gnostic origin, although in later years was seen by the kabbalists as one of the angels in heaven associated with the emotive faculties of the soul and with the concept of &quot;finite power.&quot; Certain kabbalists allege that our prayers and our worship go unto the &quot;lesser countenance&quot;, and that the world was created by him. To Rabbi Yehiya al-Qafih, such statements amounted to heresy, since there was none other but God who created the universe and unto whom, alone, we are to pray.

In a letter addressed to Rabbi Avraham Isaac Kook, the chief Rabbi of Mandate Palestine, Rabbi Yihya Qafih argues effectually that such beliefs stand in contradiction to the Law bequeathed to us by Moses. He levels harsh criticism against the Zohar for its endorsement of heretical teachings, such as that of the &quot;lesser countenance&quot; (Aramaic: זעיר אנפין), as well as against the new kabbalists who claim that &quot;lesser countenance&quot; is our God and we are his people, such as described by &quot;Sefer HaBrit&quot; (Article 20, item # 15) and by &quot;Yosher Levav&quot; (page 4), and who allege wrongly that it was he who brought us out of the land of Egypt, and that his wife (who is &quot;Malkhut&quot;) was she who smote the Egyptians in Egypt and at the sea, while it was he who revealed himself unto Israel at Mount Sinai and gave to us his Divine Law All these things, Rabbi Qafih alleged, should be expunged from our religion, since the import of the Torah is clear that only God, and God alone, had done all these things for Israel. 

===Reincarnation and Invocation of Saints===

Another matter of dispute between Dor Daim and the Kabbalists concerns the Dor Daim&#x27;s rejection of reincarnation. They support their rejection with writings of Saadia Gaon (892-942) who dismissed reincarnation as an unauthentic Jewish belief. This perspective is shared not only by non-Dor Dai disciples of Rambam (Maimonides) but also by many in mainstream Orthodox Judaism. 

Dor Daim also disapprove of requesting from any unseen force other than the Almighty. They are against soliciting angels or Jewish leaders who have died. They disapprove of such practices regardless of one&#x27;s location, and even if the individual desires that the angel or saint intercede with God. Dor Daim, indeed all &quot;Meqoriim&quot;, consider such practices absolutely antithetical to the most essential principles of what they believe to be historical Judaism: to serve the One Incomparable Creator without joining partners or mediators together with Him in our prayers and worship. This is based on their understanding of the books mentioned above, and specifically on the laws concerning mediator (&quot;sarsur&quot;) or an advocate (&quot;melitz&quot;) mentioned in the Mishneh Torah and the fifth of the Thirteen Principles of Faith. Prayer, in Judaism, is a form of worship: as the ancient sages of Israel are well known to have stated, &quot;What is the service of the heart? This is prayer.&quot;

In addition to the issue of invoking forces other than the Almighty, Dor Daim and &quot;Meqoriim&quot; in general disapprove of the common practice of visiting the graves, shrines, or monuments of saints, even if an individual does not request from a force other than the Almighty. Basing themselves on Talmudic sources codified in the Mishneh Torah, they believe this to be a prohibition instituted by the Sages of the Great Court established under Moses - the Sanhedrin. They generally consider this prohibition to have been instituted as a means to distance the people of Israel from the possibility of transgressing what &quot;Meqoriim&quot; consider to be the Biblical-prohibitions of establishing a &quot;monument&quot; (prohibited even without any connection to idolatry) and from invoking any force other than the Almighty. This, they point out, is the very same reason Jewish tradition explains why Moses&#x27; burial place was left unknown according to the Biblical record.

===Jewish law===

Dor Daim disapprove of what they believe to be an abandonment of a number of Talmudic practices on the part of a large portion of the Jewish world in favor of newer customs and innovations, some of which, in their opinion, are even contrary to Talmudic law. In particular this disapproval is aimed at customs derived from the Kabbalah, but it is not confined to them. In their view, and still more in the view of the &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot;, there is simply no constitutional authority in Jewish law to institute new rules or practices, whether in the direction of leniency or of severity, since the demise of the Sanhedrin in 425 CE, or at the latest the closure of the Talmud, and the role of later rabbis is confined to teaching and codification of the law as it stood at that date. They do not claim that this position is ideal, and would gladly see a revived Sanhedrin sort out the problems in Jewish law, provided that it was itself established in strict conformity to law.

In their view, the Mishneh Torah of Maimonides is the most accurate and therefore most authoritative statement of Talmudic law, and is in itself a sufficient reference without resort to any other source. Maimonides writes that if the Mishneh Torah was intended to be explained by the Talmud he wouldn&#x27;t have written the Mishneh Torah. Furthermore, the current text of the Talmud is fairly corrupt with numerous textual variants; from this, coupled with Maimonides&#x27; indications that he had far more accurate and complete Talmudic texts available to him, they conclude that the Mishneh Torah provides the best access to what the Talmud must originally have intended.

Unlike many of the later &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot;, the original Dor Daim were not committed to the view that all local custom, whether Sephardi or Ashkenazi or from any other source, is totally illegitimate to the extent that it differs from normative Jewish law (as best stated, in their view, by Maimonides), so they preserved certain non-Maimonidean Yemenite peculiarities in minor matters. However they did believe, in reliance on old authorities such as Joseph Caro and David ibn abi Zimra, that the views of Maimonides ought to be authoritative not only in Yemen but also in Eretz Yisrael, Egypt and the Near East generally.

There is a link between the Dor Daim&#x27;s stance on Jewish law and on the other issues, as one argument for accepting the Mishneh Torah as the best restatement of Jewish law is that most of the later codifiers, including Joseph Caro, were believers in Kabbalah and should therefore not be accepted as authorities. As against this, many (e.g. Yeshayahu Leibowitz) argue that Caro and the others were operating within the rigorous rules of halachic reasoning and that their conclusions were in no way affected or invalidated by their personal theological views (just as, from the opposite perspective, Maimonides&#x27; status as a halachic authority is not affected by his acceptance of Greek philosophy). The Dor Daim reply to this is that Caro specifically allows the Zohar as a (limited and subordinate) source of rulings in Jewish law, so that his code includes practices found in Kabbalistic texts without basis in Talmudic texts. 

==Practices==

Those aspects of Jewish/Talmudic law which Dor Daim may emphasize, be particularly passionate about, and/or consider to have been cast aside by large portions of the Jewish world include: 

* laws on &#x27;avodah zarah&#x27; (forbidden forms of worship/idolatry) which they hold prohibits any use of intermediaries or mediators between oneself and the One Creator, prohibits praying or making requests to unseen forces such as past Rabbis or Sefirot, or supplicating to any unseen being other than the One Absolute Being - Y/H/W/H, and not doing any specific acts of religious devotion to any thing other than He;
* laws of legislation relating to the function and necessity of the Great Court (the Sanhedrin)
* laws concerning the settlement of the Land of Israel by the People of Israel as elaborated upon in Hilkhoth Melakhim u&#x27;Milhamotheham in the Mishneh Torah;
* certain laws concerning kashruth, such as Halita - immersing meat into boiling water before cooking;
* preservation of proper and exact pronunciation of all the Hebrew letters and Hebrew grammar (although there are minute differences even amongst the Dor Daim);
* emphasizing memorization of the Ḥumash (the Torah/Law of Moses); for example, each of the seven individuals called up to read from a Sefer Torah (Torah scroll) reads out loud the particular section of that week&#x27;s parasha (section) upon which he said a blessing, as opposed to other customs in which there is a single, set reader. (This custom arose from there existing some people who did not know the cantillations by heart, and would be embarrassed to read in public);
* that unmarried females should also wear a head-covering, and not only married women.
* that one should strive to wear a Tallit Gadol and or Tefillin as much as permitted by Talmudic law whenever possible. In various areas of Israel, including Jerusalem, one may see individuals wearing the Tallit Gadol during &#x27;Erev Shabbat&#x27; (Friday night) hanging over or wrapped over their shoulders in a manner distinct from the majority custom, when almost no other Jews would be wearing a Tallit Gadol. Even children under 13 can be seen wearing a Tallit Gadol among them.

Dor Daim usually use Yosef Qafiḥ&#x27;s edition of the Baladi prayer book. This is on the lines of the prayer book of the Maharitz, and therefore contains some Kabbalistic insertions, enabling the book to be used by mainstream Baladi Jews. However, these insertions are clearly marked by footnotes as being later additions. Dor Daim can therefore use this prayer book and simply omit these additions.

==Similarities and differences with other groups==

===Mainstream Baladi Jews===

As previously explained, the Baladi/Shami distinction does not always coincide with the Dor Daim/Iqshim distinction. That is, while a Dor Dai is necessarily a Baladi, and a Shami is necessarily an Iqshi (Kabbalist), most Baladim occupy an intermediate point on the spectrum and may or may not accord some validity to Kabbalah. 

The distinguishing mark of a Baladi individual or community is the use of the traditional liturgy, regardless of the underlying theological or intellectual orientation. Some Baladim may sympathize to a greater or lesser extent with the Dor Dai distrust of Zoharic and Lurianic Kabbalah. Others may accept the Lurianic version of Kabbalah but retain the ancestral liturgy on the ground that, even according to Luria, this is the Kabbalistically correct thing to do. Others again may have no particular views one way or the other. However, Baladim of all shades uniformly accept the Mishneh Torah rather than the Shulchan Aruch as their authority on Jewish law. 

Outwardly the practices of Baladi Jews and Dor Daim are almost identical, apart from some Kabbalistic insertions to be found in the Baladi prayer book. However most Baladim, while holding that the Mishneh Torah is the best interpretation of Jewish law, are content to preserve it as the particular custom of their group and do not seek to delegitimize the customs of other Jewish communities. (How far the Dor Daim seek to do this is a matter of debate.)

Several of the above-listed distinctions between Dor Daim and the majority of world Jewry are shared by all traditional Baladi Yemenite Jews, and not just by Dor Daim. On matters of law and practice as opposed to theology, the only difference between Dor Daim and the rest of Baladi Yemenite Jews appears to be the level of zeal in preserving the above listed practices, although exceptions do exist.

===&quot;Talmide ha-Rambam&quot;===

Today&#x27;s &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot; differ from the original Dor Daim in two ways.

*&quot;Talmide ha-Rambam&quot; do not necessarily reject the Zohar. However, their interpretation may differ more or less drastically from the Lurianic school or the currents of thought popularly referred to as &quot;Kabbalah&quot; today. 
*&quot;Talmide ha-Rambam&quot; tend to hold that the Mishneh Torah is the best restatement of Talmudic law, and that every custom that diverges from it is logically inferior if not actually illegitimate. On points not explicitly covered by Maimonides, such as the exact mode of prostration during prayers, there is considerable competition to unearth the most authentic mode from among the various Yemenite practices found in recorded history. Dor Daim, by contrast, do retain some current Yemenite practices, even when (according to the &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot;) these diverge from the views of Maimonides (see under Jewish law above). For example, they do not follow Maimonides&#x27; recommendation to eliminate all prayers prior to the Kaddish and Shema in order to avoid &#x27;unnecessarily burdening the congregation&#x27;.

In short, &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot; are less extreme than Dor Daim about the Zohar and more extreme about &quot;Maimonides-only&quot; jurisprudence. Nevertheless, the similarities between the two groups, as expressed in the list of beliefs and practices above, overwhelmingly outnumber the differences.

Many members of the small and slowly growing Dor Dai community claim a fear of persecution and therefore maintain an almost secret existence. It is very likely that the entire movement of Dor Daim, together with some of their well-known leaders, has helped, and continues to help, fuel the rapidly growing community of &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot;. It is undeniable that, while there are sometimes differences between Dor Daim and &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot; as a whole—over certain details of practical Jewish law and the issue of the Zohar—the two communities continue to have strong links. 

As stated, &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot; differ from Dor Daim in that they are not confined to the Yemenite community and need not be committed to specifically Yemenite customs. Nonetheless, Yemenite scholarship and practice are still a major resource for them. Two good examples of this are seen in the works of Rabbi Yosef Qafiḥ and of Mechon-Mamre.org. 
*Rabbi Yosef Qafiḥ has made various contributions to Dor Daim, &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot; and the Jewish world as a whole. Examples of his contributions include his encyclopedic commentary to the entire Mishneh Torah set to the renowned Yemenite text of the Mishneh Torah, his translation of all of Maimonides&#x27; Commentary on the Mishnah from Arabic into modern Hebrew, as well as translations of the Guide for the Perplexed, Duties of the Heart, Sefer Kuzari, and a number of other works.
*Mechon-Mamre.org has produced software for learning the Ḥumash, Tanakh, Mishnah, the Talmudic texts, as well as the Mishneh Torah according to Rabbi Qafiḥ and its own accurate and scholarly text, intended to be beneficial to all. The Mechon-mamre.org website&#x27;s &quot;About&quot; section states that most participants in the work of Mechon-Mamre are Baladi Yemenite Jews, although some of the more impacting individuals of Mechon-Mamre.org are not Yemenite or Dor Daim at all, but merely promote observance of Talmudic law as codified in the Mishneh Torah.

Dor Daim and &quot;Rambamists&quot; are most easily recognized by the manner in which their Tzitzit are tied (according to the Rambam, despite slight variations in understanding). Temani/Rambam Tzitzit can be distinguished from those of the many &#x27;knitted kippa&#x27; youths who have adopted the same style, but have added Tekhelet. Rambamists and Baladim are also noticeable by the fact that they wear their Tallit in a different manner from non-Yemenite Jews, and even wear it on Friday nights/Erev Shabbath, which is almost unheard of in non-Yemenite synagogues (apart from a handful of Hasidim in Jerusalem, referred to as &quot;Yerushalmis&quot;, who wear it very discreetly so as to not look arrogant).

===Gaonists===

Dor Daim as well as non-Yemenite or non-Dor Dai students of the Rambam all find a certain level of commonality with individuals who sometimes call themselves &quot;Gaonists&quot;. &quot;Gaonists&quot; aim at applying Jewish law in everyday life according to the writings of the Geonim as a whole without singling out any one particular Gaon or codification of Jewish law over another. The commonality between all of these groups is sourced in their shared pursuit of living according to the original understanding of Talmudic law as much as possible with as little influence from the effects of almost 2,000 years of exile as possible. These groups together are sometimes referred to as &quot;Meqoriim&quot; (originalists/followers of the originals).

===Mitnaggedim and followers of the Vilna Gaon===

The dispute between Dor Daim and &quot;Aqashim&quot; has some similarities to that between Mitnaggedim and Hasidim, with the Vilna Gaon and his heirs standing for Talmudic intellectualism and a Halachic worldview like Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ. However, mainstream Litvish Jews venerate the Zohar and Luria, and like the Hasidim their elite write Kabbalistic commentaries. Joseph Dan writes that there is no truth to the popular notion that the Mitnaggedim were more rationalist than the Hasidim; Lurianic notions dominate in the theologies of both camps. Their dispute can be seen as a battle within two conceptions of Lurianic kabbalah; the Mitnaggedim being faithful to received Kabbalah, while the Hasidim introduced new conceptions into theirs, particularly new conceptions of mystical leadership. On the whole, Mitnagdic-Litvish Judaism accepted Kabbalah, but had a distinctive &quot;intellectualist&quot; understanding of it.

Different interpretations of Luria arose among his followers regarding whether tzimtzum (withdrawal of Divinity from Creation) should be taken literally or metaphorically. Hasidism read it metaphorically and immanently, leading to Panentheism. Mitnaggedism read it transcendentally in relation to Man, leading to Theism, though allowing validity to Panentheism solely from the Divine perspective. Shneur Zalman of Liadi accused the Vilna Gaon of taking tzimtzum literally and not following Luria fully, though Mitnaggedic Kabbalists rejected this. It seems that the Vilna Gaon, who wrote extensive Kabbalistic works, followed the Lurianic system, but diverged from Luria when he felt the Zohar lent itself to another approach. The issue is the subject of forewords to the main texts of Lithuanian Kabbalah: the introduction, by Rabbi Ḥayyim of Volozhin, to the Vilna Gaon&#x27;s commentary to the &quot;Sifra di-Tsniuta&quot; and Rabbi Yitzchak Eizik Chaver&#x27;s &quot;Pitchei Shearim&quot;.

Paradoxically, the Chabad philosophical school of Hasidic thought created by Shneur Zalman of Liadi, an offshoot movement of its own from Hasidic emotionalist faith, routinely embraced perspectives from Maimonidean and other medieval Jewish philosophy within its textual system. To an extent Shneur Zalman personally modelled himself after Maimonides, and his Tanya after the Guide of the Perplexed. The 7th Lubavitcher Rebbe likewise extolled Maimonides as a history shaping leader, and created a daily study program in Mishneh Torah. Chabad leaders read the human wisdom of Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Guide&quot; and the Divine wisdom of Lurianic Kabbalah as partial theological aspects of their inclusive essence mystical study of Divinity. In contrast the Vilna Gaon, a Kabbalist of a traditionalist type, had no use for philosophy, declaring he only learned 3 things from it. Haskalah attempts to claim him as one of their own were entirely misplaced. Although proficient in, and recommending the necessity for mathematics and sciences to understand the Talmud, and highly astute in lower textual critical emendation of Judaic texts, while revering Maimonides for his holiness and legal greatness, the Gaon berated Rambam for being &quot;misled by the accursed philosophy&quot; in rejecting demons, incantations and amulets. Both Hasidic and Mitnagdic Kabbalists entirely rejected the physical literalist interpretations of Kabbalah by Sabbatean movements as idolatrous. The Baal Shem Tov himself declared that esoteric study of Kabbalah symbolism outside his Hasidic inner soul holiness experiential psychologisation of it, by those not purified, was forbidden and lead to the Sabbatean false physical anthropomorphism of it by their impure desires, the cardinal conceptual sin in Kabbalistic understanding. He said this at a time and in the same vicinity where Frankism had taken Kabbalah into antinomian and nihilist desecration of Torah.

In his &quot;Nefesh HaHayyim&quot;, Chaim of Volozhin, founder of the Litvish Yeshiva movement and main theorist of Mitnaggedism, responds to the theology of Schneur Zalman&#x27;s &quot;Tanya&quot; based on different interpretation of the same Kabbalistic sources. Their difference revolves around alternate identifications between Divine Immanence/Transcendence and Divine Monism/Pluralism. For Hayyim Volozhin and Mitnaggedic-Litvish Judaism: Man relates to transcendent Theism intellectually through Talmud and Halacha, rather than to immanent Panentheism through Hasidic devekut. Kabbalah is reserved for the elite, rather than popularised in Hasidism. Elite Mitnaggedic prayer uses Kabbalistic worldview to relate to the ultimate non-existence of Creation from the Divine perspective. For the mainstream, spirituality is through Talmudic study and Halachic worldview for its own sake.

Regarding Jewish Law, those of the Vilna Gaon&#x27;s successors who were associated with the Volozhin yeshiva, such as the Brisker group and in particular Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik, had a very high regard for the Mishneh Torah and held it as the best tool for the theoretical understanding of the Talmud and of Jewish law generally. When however it came to practical legal rulings, an activity of which they steered clear when possible, they adhered to the normative Ashkenazi version of Halakha, as set out in the Shulchan Aruch and the glosses of Moses Isserles.

There are various groups in Israel today which claim to follow the Vilna Gaon. These may be found in places as diverse as the Neturei Karta and the fringes of Religious Zionism, the latter group being represented by the Aderet Eliyahu yeshiva. Their intellectualist orientation has some similarities to that of the Dor Daim, though also venerating Kabbalah.

Some thinkers of a Modern Orthodox &quot;mitnagged&quot; cast of thought, however, such as Yeshayahu Leibowitz, reject Zoharic Kabbalah and praise the work of Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ.

===Spanish and Portuguese Jews===

Dor Daim and other Yemenite &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot; like to compare themselves to the Spanish and Portuguese Jews, and think of them as &quot;the other Rambam Jews&quot;. This is largely because of their shared scepticism about the Zohar. The resemblance has however been exaggerated.

Spanish and Portuguese Jews preserve an early form of the Sephardic liturgy from before the expulsion from Spain, which reflected some, but only very limited, influence from the Kabbalah and the Zohar. In the 16th and early 17th centuries they adopted a certain number of Lurianic observances in a piecemeal fashion, for example the Tu Bishvat seder. After the Sabbatai Zevi debacle these observances were largely dropped, because it was felt that Lurianic Kabbalah had contributed to the disaster. The arguments against the authenticity of the Zohar advanced by Jacob Emden and Leone di Modena were also influential. At the present day the general Spanish and Portuguese attitude to the Kabbalah is one of indifference rather than hostility. As Spanish and Portuguese communities act as hosts for Sephardi Jews of many other backgrounds, there would be no bar on individuals regarding Kabbalah more positively. In particular, the Lurianic Kabbalah had a following in the Jewish community of Livorno, which falls within the Spanish and Portuguese group but was the main point of contact between it and the Levantine Sephardim. The Spanish and Portuguese group&#x27;s closest resemblance would therefore be not to Dor Daim but to mainstream Baladi Yemenites.

Spanish and Portuguese Jews admire Maimonides and identify with the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain. However, they cannot be classified as &quot;Rambamists&quot; in the sense required, as their religious law is based squarely on the &quot;Bet Yosef&quot; of Joseph Caro, subject to certain liturgical customs peculiar to themselves. It could even be argued that they follow Caro more closely than any other group, as many other Sephardim, especially the eastern communities influenced by the Ben Ish Chai, regard Isaac Luria as having equal or even greater authority than Caro. 

The above describes the attitude of traditional communities such as London and Amsterdam. In some newer communities, in particular among the followers of José Faur and Yaakov Oliveira, a more purist and principled attitude has evolved, which does place considerable emphasis on the Mishneh Torah; however they also utilize the Shulchan Aruch in their lectures in order to help promote the study of practical Jewish law amongst the greater Jewish community. 

==Criticisms==

1. There are those who would claim that Dor Daim and even all students of the Rambam are heretics by reason of their non-acceptance of Zohar and Lurianic Kabbalah. This claim depends on the assumption that the Lurianic Kabbalah is a dogma of Judaism binding upon all Jews. Not only the Dor Daim and &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot;, but many other Orthodox groups, such as the followers of the Vilna Gaon along with many of the non-Hasidic Orthodox, would disagree with this assumption, regardless of whether or not they personally accept the Lurianic Kabbalah. Such a view, according to Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, does not make the Dor Daim heretics. Moreover, Rabbis Eliyahu Dessler and Gedaliah Nadel maintained that it is acceptable to believe that the Zohar was not written by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and that it had a late authorship. Already over 200 years ago the Noda Bihudah, in his sefer &quot;Derushei HaTzlach&quot;, argued that the Zohar is to be considered unreliable as it came into our hands many hundreds of years after Rashbi&#x27;s death and in the absence of an unbroken &quot;mesorah&quot;, among other reasons.

The Dor Dai response is that whether a person or school is heretical is a question of law, to be decided according to authoritative works of halakha: one is not a heretic simply for disagreeing with a widely held aggadic interpretation, unless the &quot;halakha&quot; specifically says so. The Mishneh Torah is comprehensive in scope and is, at the very least, &quot;one&quot; of the authoritative sources of &quot;halakha&quot;, so to follow it must be an acceptable way of doing Judaism. Accordingly, since the Dor Daim assert nothing that is not found within the four corners of the Mishneh Torah, and the Mishneh Torah cannot be interpreted as actually requiring belief in anything approaching Zoharic or Lurianic Kabbalah, they cannot be heretics - unless the Mishneh Torah itself is heretical, which is not held by any mainstream Jewish group.

2. Others believe that the main problem is not that Dor Daim do not follow Kabbalah for themselves, but that they delegitimize those who do follow it. Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ, for instance, held that one must not use parchments written by, or eat meat slaughtered by, believers in Kabbalah because these are dedicated to &quot;Zeir Anpin&quot; (one of the &quot;partzufim&quot; of the 10 sephirot), a concept apparently distinct from the Unfathomable Almighty Creator.

Few Dor Daim take such an extreme view today, as most consider that the above reasoning makes Jewish law too uncertain in practice. Those who do take such a view would argue that it is not at all uncommon in Judaism for one group to treat as invalid the ritual acts or objects of another for technical or doctrinal reasons. That does not amount to an attempt to exclude the other group from Judaism.

3. A third criticism is that Dor Daim take works of Kabbalah too literally: it is intended to be myth and metaphor, and to subject it to rigorous analysis as the Dor Daim do is like trying to construe a work of poetry as if it were a statute. Works of Kabbalah themselves contain warnings that the teachings should not be exposed to common view or read too realistically, and that to do so is indeed to incur the danger of falling into heresy or idolatry.

The Dor Dai response to this is that, however this may be in theory, these warnings have not been observed. Kabbalah, in its most literal and &quot;realistic&quot; sense, has in fact been extensively popularised, with the result that many otherwise pious Jewish groups are now permeated with superstition, so that the whole enterprise is now more trouble than it is worth. Further, the claim that these works, on their true interpretation, are harmless metaphorical imagery fully compatible with monotheism is disingenuous: the origins of most Kabbalistic concepts in pagan systems such as Neoplatonism and Gnosticism are too glaringly obvious to be ignored. (Dor Daim do not claim that Kabbalists are in fact polytheists: only that they are inconsistent.)

4. A fourth criticism is that it is a stultification of Jewish law to regard any authority, even one as eminent as Maimonides, as final. The essence of Oral Law is that it is case law rather than code law, and needs to be interpreted in each generation: otherwise the Mishneh Torah could simply have been handed down as part of the written Torah. For this reason, it is a principle of Jewish law that &quot;Jephthah in his generation is as Samuel in his generation&quot;: one is bound by the current authorities, rather than by previous authorities however objectively superior.

The Dor Dai response to this is that the acceptance of Maimonides in the Yemenite community has always been regarded as a legitimate version of Jewish law, and that they are no more stultified by the authority of Maimonides than other Jewish communities are by the authority of the Shulchan Aruch. From the practical point of view Jewish law as codified by Maimonides is as compatible with modern conditions as any later code: if anything more so, as later Jewish law has become enmeshed in many unnecessary intellectual tangles. If there are practical problems caused by this &quot;static&quot; view of Jewish law, that is part of the price of exile: the question is not whether a given reform would be desirable, but whether there is constitutional authority to make it, and in their view there is not.

5. A final criticism is that the Dor Dai version of Judaism is disquietingly reminiscent of militant Islamic trends such as Salafism. Both started out as modernising movements designed to remove some of the cobwebs and allow the religion to compete in the modern world, and both have ended up as fundamentalist groups lending themselves to alliances with political extremism. Both disapprove of mysticism (Kabbalah or Sufism) and praying at tombs; both tend to dismiss more moderate coreligionists as unbelievers (see Takfir); both cut out centuries of sophisticated legal scholarship in favour of an every-man-for-himself &quot;back to the sources&quot; approach.

The Dor Daim answer to this is:
#Political militancy is no more characteristic of Dor Daim than of many Kabbalistically-inspired branches of Religious Zionism (e.g. the followers of Zvi Yehuda Kook). In fact the conditions for political or military action, as laid down in the Mishneh Torah, are extremely strict and limited.
#Neither Dor Daim nor &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot; are against mysticism per se: see Attitude to Kabbalah above. The attitude to Kabbalah is based on much more specific factors: if there is an analogue to their opposition among other religions, it is essentially an opposition to the espousal of concepts such as incarnation, pantheism, and panentheism - apart from the opposition to idolatry in general, as understood in the context of the Mishneh Torah.
#The antagonism shared by Dor Daim and &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot; against praying at tombs etc. is distinct from the Salafi view in a number of ways. First, in contrast to the Salafi view, the Dor Dai / &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot; view is that this prohibition is Rabbinic, meaning that it is not a direct command from the Almighty, but rather it is a &quot;fence&quot; to distance a Jew from the possibility of transgressing a more severe prohibition. They do not consider praying at or visiting a tomb to be idolatry, nor do they believe that this is prohibited to all people (i.e. non-Israelites), whereas the Salafi view is that this is forbidden to everyone as a very severe prohibition in itself.
#It is wrong to accuse Dor Daim and &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot; of being extremists, or of dismissing more moderate coreligionists as unbelievers: see reply to 2 above. On the contrary, they often find more in common theologically with sectors of Modern Orthodoxy than they do with much of the Ḥasidic or Ḥaredi communities.
#The method of learning and religious observance aimed at by them is firmly rooted in Jewish rabbinic authority (see Jewish law above), and is about as far from an &quot;every-man-for-himself&quot; approach as it is possible to get. How far a similar accusation may be true of Salafism (which is itself an umbrella description for a great many trends) is an independent question, on which Dor Daim are not required to express a view.
#Salafis typically reject Islamic philosophy of the kind propounded by Avicenna and Averroes. Dor Daim, by contrast, find strong inspiration in the closely related Jewish philosophies of Bahya ibn Pakuda and Maimonides.
#Many Dor Daim and &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot; desire that the Jewish people as a nation will return to upholding the Almighty&#x27;s Torah with the establishment of a central religious authority - a Great Court (Sanhedrin) reestablished according to Jewish law as only fully codified in the Mishneh Torah. That is one form of the Messianic aspiration implicit in any form of Orthodox Judaism. It cannot be compared to the desire of some Islamists to reestablish a Khilafah by violent means if necessary.

<text>Clayton Keith Yeutter, ONZM (; December 10, 1930 – March 4, 2017) was an American politician who served as United States secretary of agriculture under President George H. W. Bush from 1989 to 1991 before serving as counselor to the president in 1992. He served as United States trade representative from 1985 to 1989 and as chairman for the Republican National Committee from 1991 until 1992. Yeutter was employed as a senior advisor at the international law firm Hogan Lovells in Washington, D.C. He additionally founded the Clayton Yeutter Institute of International Trade and Finance at his alma mater, the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. The university subsequently published his biography, &quot;Rhymes with Fighter&quot;.

Yeutter was born in Eustis, Nebraska. Yeutter was a graduate of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln from which he received a multiple degrees in agricultural economics. Yeutter later served as assistant secretary of agriculture for marketing and consumer services from 1973 to 1974, assistant secretary of agriculture for international affairs and commodity programs from 1974 to 1975, and deputy special representative for trade negotiations from 1975 to 1977.

==Early life and education==
Yeutter was born in Eustis, Nebraska, on December 10, 1930, during the Nebraska Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. Despite a successful career in government and politics, Yeutter expressed a continued desire to remain close to his upbringing. As Deputy Trade Representative Yeutter stated, &quot;I once wanted to stay in Nebraska and be a successful farmer. There are days when I get a yearning to return.&quot;

Yeutter graduated from Eustis High School in 1948. He then attended the University of Nebraska–Lincoln and was a member of FarmHouse Fraternity. In 1952 Yeutter graduated with a B.S. &quot;With High Distinction&quot;, the highest scholastic honor given by the University of Nebraska. He also ranked first in the College of Agriculture graduating class and was named the &quot;Outstanding Animal Husbandry Graduate&quot; in the United States.

Upon graduation from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, which coincided with the Korean War, Yeutter enlisted as a Basic Airman in the United States Air Force. While enlisted he earned credits under the G.I. Bill to attend graduate school. From the completion of his enlistment in 1957 until 1975 Yeutter worked as the operator of a 2,500-acre farming enterprise in central Nebraska. He also continued to serve in the active reserve until 1977.

During an overlapping six-year period beginning in January 1960, Yeutter worked as a faculty member within the Department of Agricultural Economics at his alma mater, the University of Nebraska. While working within the Department of Agricultural Economics Yeutter completed extensive graduate work. He completed one semester of graduate studies in agricultural economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1960. After entering the College of Law at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Yeutter served as an editor of the &quot;Nebraska Law Review&quot;. In 1963 Yeutter graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; with a J.D. and ranked first in his graduating class. While Yeutter continued to work as a faculty member he also completed a Ph.D. in agricultural economics by 1966. While completing his J.D. and Ph.D., Yeutter taught agricultural economics and agricultural law part-time. After completing his J.D. Yeutter taught full-time from 1965 to 1966.

==Professional career==
Yeutter began his professional political career as the chief of staff to the governor of Nebraska in January 1967. During the following two years he managed coordination between the governor&#x27;s office and the Department of Agriculture and the numerous state educational institutions. Additionally, he was responsible for lobbying Governor Norbert Tiemann&#x27;s legislative program through the Nebraska legislature. In September 1968 Yeutter left public service to become the Director of the University of Nebraska Mission in Colombia. At the time it was the largest agricultural technical assistance program in the world. The mission involved six Midwestern land-grant universities funded by U.S. AID, the Kellogg Foundation and the Ford Foundation. The participating universities provided agricultural assistance to the National University of Colombia and the Colombian Agricultural Institute, which approximated the United States Department of Agriculture.

After returning from Colombia, Yeutter served as Administrator of Consumer and Marketing Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture from October 1970 until December 1971. In January 1972 Yeutter was assigned to two positions in the reelection campaign of President Richard Nixon. He served as the nationwide director of agriculture and as one of ten regional directors. Following Nixon&#x27;s reelection, Yeutter was appointed to Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Marketing and Consumer Services within the U.S. Department of Agriculture in January 1973. In March 1974 Yeutter was appointed Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for International Affairs and Commodity Programs. As Assistant Secretary, Yeutter was in charge of negotiating an end to a trade war between the United States and the European Economic Community over cheese subsidizes.

In June 1975 Yeutter shifted from the Department of Agriculture to the Executive Office of the President, in which he served as Deputy Special Trade Representative. In this position, Yeutter worked as an ambassador in trade negotiations with foreign countries. In February 1977, shortly after Gerald Ford vacated the presidency, Yeutter exited public service.

In April 1977 Yeutter became a senior partner at the law firm Nelson, Harding, Yeutter &amp; Leonard, which was primarily located in Lincoln, Nebraska. He continued to work at the firm until June 1978.

Yeutter served as president and CEO of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world&#x27;s second-largest futures exchange at the time, from July 1978 until June 1985. During that period, the trade volume of agricultural, currency, and interest rate futures more than tripled. While serving as president, Yeutter negotiated the use of the Tokyo Stock Exchange index for futures and options trading. He also encouraged European investors to invest in currency futures and options at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. More than 400 visits to the exchange by members of Congress during Yeutter&#x27;s tenure provided him with political experience that which would become especially valuable when he worked directly with Congress between 1985 and 1993.

===United States Trade Representative===
After working for eight years in the private sector, Yeutter returned to public office in July 1985. After Reagan&#x27;s nomination, Yeutter was confirmed by the Senate as U.S. Trade Representative on June 28, 1985. He succeeded William E. Brock, who was named Secretary of Labor. While holding the position Yeutter helped pass the 1988 Trade Bill through Congress, completed the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement, managed the initial negotiations regarding the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and used American trade laws to open foreign markets to American goods.

Yeutter was perceived to be an outsider because of his inexperience interacting with Congress to develop legislation and because he was only mildly acquainted with the President. These characteristics contrasted with his 11 predecessors, who possessed greater political credentials and a closer relationship to the President. In fact, Yeutter argued that his independence from Reagan reflected his success in the position.

Along with the Commerce Secretary, Malcolm Baldrige, and Treasury Secretary, James Baker, Yeutter was accredited with the formulation of a comprehensive US trade policy after his first 4 months in office. At this point in time the Reagan administration was faced with mounting pressure from the Congress for protectionist policy that would tackle the mounting international trade deficit. Additionally, Yeutter faced tense trade negotiations with Japan. In June 1985 Yeutter initiated an investigation based on Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act against Japan for unfair barriers to sale of American electronic products. In October Yeutter took similar action against South Korea based on a complaint filed by the MPAA. The unfair trade practices outlined in the complaint were exacerbated by at $4 billion trade deficit with South Korea during the previous year.

On February 3, 1987, while discussing the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement at a Brookings Institution seminar, Yeutter was quoted as saying the agreement would risk the loss of Canadian culture. The statement reflected the Canadian public concern that the free trade agreement would lead to unprecedented American economic and cultural dominance. Although the comment was not notable in the United States, it produced considerable controversy in Canada. In response to the comment Prime Minister Brian Mulroney stated in the Canadian Parliament that &quot;his remarks showed a stunning ignorance of Canada&quot;.

===Secretary of Agriculture===

Yeutter served as Secretary of Agriculture under George H. W. Bush from February 1989 until February 1991. His nomination was approved by the Senate on February 9, 1989. Yeutter was slightly reluctant to take this new position after enduring the fast pace of United States trade policy, but his fondness for agricultural issues overcame that sentiment.

When he took office Yeutter&#x27;s primary concern was the quinquennial farm bill. The previous bill was passed in 1985 and had focused on providing financial support to American farmers. During the early 1980s, a high rate of bankruptcy among farmers prompted the federal government to provide unprecedented subsidies through the Food Security Act of 1985. The development of what was to become the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 was largely influenced by Uruguay Round negotiations, which Yeutter led as USTR. 
Additionally, the 1990 farm bill removed United States farm subsidies created in the 1985 bill.

===Republican National Committee Chairman===
In January 1991 Yeutter took the place of Lee Atwater as Chairman of the Republican National Committee. Yeutter was elected after George H. W. Bush&#x27;s first choice for chairman, William Bennett, revoked his initial acceptance of the position due to a potential conflict of interest. The protracted and turbulent process of finding a successor to Atwater was used by Democrats to characterize the Republican party as a fractured organization. Yeutter&#x27;s &quot;substantive&quot; leadership style and belief that &quot;good guys finished first, not last,&quot; created doubt among some members of the Republican party who preferred Atwater&#x27;s more hard-edge political style.

Atwater&#x27;s illness prevented the Committee from functioning normally. Before Yeutter was selected, fundraising had dropped off substantially and about 25% of staff had been laid off. Once he was elected, Yeutter focused on stabilizing the level of fundraising and winning the nationwide redistricting battles during 1991.

===Counselor to the President===
On January 31, 1992, President George H. W. Bush named Yeutter as counselor to the president for domestic policy. Yeutter was replaced by Richard Bond as Chairman of the Republican National Committee. The cabinet-level position was left vacant since Edwin Meese III held the post under Ronald Reagan. Unlike Meese&#x27;s post, Yeutter had additional control over the Bush administration&#x27;s economic and domestic councils, which formed the cabinet&#x27;s policy-making apparatus. The additional control was initially opposed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who led the economic policy council.

==Later life==
From February 1993, Yeutter split his time working as a senior advisor at Hogan Lovells (formerly Hogan &amp; Hartson L.L.P.) in Washington D.C. and holding numerous corporate directorships. In March 1997 Yeutter registered to lobby on the farm bill for the American Farmland Trust.

===Corporate directorships===

Yeutter&#x27;s first major corporate directorship was with ConAgra Foods while serving as the President and CEO of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. He resigned from the position in 1985 when he became U.S. Trade Representative. While serving as Chairman of the Republican National Committee Yeutter joined the boards of Caterpillar Inc. and Texas Instruments. He resigned from both positions in 1992 when he became Counselor to the President. Yeutter was reinstated to the boards of ConAgra Foods, Caterpillar Inc. and Texas Instruments in 1993 and served on all three until he hit the maximum age limit for board members.

After leaving public service in 1993 Yeutter served as the director of Danielson Holding Corporation and America First. Additionally, he served as Chairman of the Board of Oppenheimer Funds, Inc. and CropSolutions, Inc. He previously served on the board of directors of Coventa Holding Corp., Chicago Climate Exchange, FMC Corporation, B.A.T. Industries and later American Commercial Lines Inc., Covanta Holding Corporation, and Weyerhaeuser. Yeutter currently serves on the board of directors of Neogen Corporation and Burlington Capital Group. Yeutter is also an owner of the Keating Network LLC, a company designed to help small and medium-sized businesses.

==Family and personal life==
After graduating from the University of Nebraska, in 1952, Yeutter married his first wife, Jeanne Vierk, with whom he had four children, Brad Yeutter, Gregg Yeutter, Kim (Yeutter) Bottimore, and Van Yeutter. Vierk served as the informal Chairman of the Cabinet Wives Group during the President George H. W. Bush administration.

Two years after Jeanne&#x27;s death, Yeutter married Cristena Bach. Bach had served in several politically appointed positions during the Reagan and Bush administration, including a stint on the White House staff under President Reagan. They adopted three daughters: Victoria Yeutter, Elena Yeutter, and Olivia Yeutter.

Yeutter&#x27;s grandson, Andrew Bottimore, worked on the U.S. Trade Representative team covering private sector engagement regarding the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Yeutter died on March 4, 2017, at his home in Potomac, Maryland, from colon cancer. He was 86.

==Honors and awards==
Yeutter received honorary doctorate degrees from Clemson University, DePaul University, Georgetown University, Nebraska Wesleyan University, Santa Clara University, University of Arizona, University of Maryland Eastern Shore and the University of Nebraska.

Yeutter was made an Honorary Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2012 New Year Honours, for services to New Zealand–United States relations.

Yeutter received a statue at the University of Nebraska – Lincoln in September 2014 for his accomplishment of being Secretary of Agriculture after graduating from the school. It is found in the Jeanne Yeutter Garden (named after his first wife) on the East campus.

Yeutter was named an Honorary Member of the American Society of Agronomy (ASA) in 1990. He also was the E.T. &amp; Vam York ASA Distinguished Keynote lecturer, who in his remarks at the 2002 ASA Annual Meeting stressed links between agricultural science, the world economy, and the global food supply.

<text>28 Bellona is a large main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by German astronomer R. Luther on March 1, 1854, and named after Bellōna, the Roman goddess of war; the name was chosen to mark the beginning of the Crimean War. Its historical symbol was Bellona&#x27;s whip and spear; it is in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1CECE 𜻎 ().

Bellona is a stony (S-type) asteroid with a cross-section size of around 100–120 km. 28 Bellona is orbiting the Sun with a period of 4.63 years.

Bellona has been studied by radar. Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado Springs, Colorado in 2007 gave a light curve with a period of 15.707 ± 0.002 hours and a brightness variation of 0.27 ± 0.03 in magnitude. This report is in close agreement with a period estimate of 15.695 hours reported in 1983, and rejects a longer period of 16.523 hours reported in 1979.

<doc id="727899" wikidata="Q108343" url="?curid=727899" title="29 Amphitrite">
<text>29 Amphitrite is one of the largest S-type asteroids, approximately in diameter, and probably fifth largest after Eunomia, Juno, Iris and Herculina.

== Discovery ==
Amphitrite was discovered by Albert Marth on 1 March 1854, at the private South Villa Observatory, in Regent&#x27;s Park, London. It was Marth&#x27;s only asteroid discovery. Its name was chosen by George Bishop, the owner of the observatory, who named it after Amphitrite, a sea goddess in Greek mythology. Its historical symbol was a shell and star; it is in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1CECF 𜻏 ().

== Characteristics ==
Amphitrite&#x27;s orbit is less eccentric and inclined than those of its larger cousins; indeed, it is the most circular of any asteroid discovered up to that point. As a consequence, it never becomes as bright as Iris or Hebe, especially as it is much further from the Sun than those asteroids. It can reach magnitudes of around +8.6 at a favorable opposition, but usually is around the binocular limit of +9.5.

In 2007, James Baer and Steven R. Chesley estimated Amphitrite to have a mass of 1.9 kg. A 2008 estimate by Baer suggests it has a mass of 1.18 kg.

A satellite of the asteroid is suspected to exist, based on lightcurve data collected by Edward F. Tedesco. In 1988 a search for satellites or dust orbiting this asteroid was performed using the UH88 telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories, but neither were found.

== Proposed exploration ==
In 1984, while determining the &quot;Galileo&quot; mission&#x27;s prelaunch trajectory to Jupiter, JPL engineers found out that if the spacecraft launched on May 1986, it could perform a flyby of 29 Amphitrite at a distance of on December 6, 1986. However, with the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster delaying the launch to October 1989, the flyby was ultimately cancelled.

<doc id="727904" wikidata="Q123920" url="?curid=727904" title="Alexandre Yersin">
<text>Alexandre Émile Jean Yersin (22 September 1863 – 1 March 1943) was a Swiss-French physician and bacteriologist. He is remembered as the co-discoverer (1894) of the bacillus responsible for the bubonic plague or pest, which was later named in his honour: &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;. Another bacteriologist, the Japanese physician Kitasato Shibasaburō, is often credited with independently identifying the bacterium a few days earlier. Yersin also demonstrated for the first time that the same bacillus was present in the rodent as well as in the human disease, thus underlining the possible means of transmission.

== Early life and education ==

Yersin was born in 1863 in Aubonne, in the canton of Vaud, Switzerland, as the posthumous son of Jean-Alexandre-Marc Yersin from his wife Fanny-Isaline-Emilie Moschell. From 1883 to 1884 he studied medicine at Lausanne, followed by Marburg, and Paris (1884–1886).

==Career==
In 1886, Yersin entered Louis Pasteur&#x27;s research laboratory at the École Normale Supérieure, by invitation of Emile Roux, and participated in the development of the anti-rabies serum. In 1888 he received his doctorate with a dissertation titled &quot;Étude sur le Développement du Tubercule Expérimental&quot; [Study on the Development of Experimental Tubercule] and spent two months with Robert Koch in Germany.

He joined the recently created Pasteur Institute in 1889 as Roux&#x27;s collaborator and discovered with him the diphtheric toxin, produced by the &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot; bacillus.

In order to practice medicine in France, Yersin applied for and obtained French nationality in 1888. Soon afterwards (1890), he left for French Indochina (current Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia) in Southeast Asia as a physician for the &quot;Messageries Maritimes&quot; company, on the Saigon-Manila line and then on the Saigon-Haiphong line. He participated in one of the Auguste Pavie missions. In 1894 Yersin was sent by request of the French government and the Pasteur Institute to Hong Kong, to investigate the plague happening there.

There, in a small hut since he was denied access to British hospitals at his arrival, he made his greatest discovery: that of the pathogen which causes the disease. Dr Kitasato Shibasaburō, also in Hong Kong, had identified a bacterium several days earlier. There is controversy whether this was the same pneumococci or a mix of the two. Because Kitasato&#x27;s initial reports were vague and somewhat contradictory, some give Yersin sole credit for the discovery. However, a 1976 thorough analysis of the morphology of the organism discovered by Kitasato determined that &quot;we are confident that Kitasato had examined the plague bacillus in Hong Kong in late June and early July 1894&quot;, only days after Yersin announced his own discovery on 20 June, and that Kitasato &quot;should not be denied this credit&quot;. The plague bacillus develops better at lower temperatures, so Yersin&#x27;s less well-equipped lab turned out to be an advantage in the race with Kitasato, who used an incubator. Therefore, although at first named “Kitasato-Yersin bacillus” by the scientific community, the microbe will later assume only the latter&#x27;s name because of the one identified by Kitasato, a type of streptococcus, cannot be found in the lymphatic glands. Yersin was also able to demonstrate for the first time that the same bacillus was present in the rodent as well as in the human disease, thus underlining the possible means of transmission. This important discovery was communicated to the French Academy of Sciences in the same year, by his colleague Emile Duclaux, in a classic paper titled &quot;La peste bubonique à Hong-Kong&quot;.

From 1895 to 1897, Yersin further pursued his studies on the bubonic plague. In 1895 he returned to the Institute Pasteur in Paris and with Émile Roux, Albert Calmette and Amédée Borrel, prepared the first anti-plague serum. In the same year, he returned to Indochina, where he installed a small laboratory at Nha Trang to manufacture the serum (in 1905 this laboratory became a branch of the Pasteur Institute). Yersin tried the serum received from Paris in Canton and Amoy, in 1896, and in Bombay, India, in 1897, with disappointing results. Having decided to stay in his country of adoption, he participated actively in the creation of the Medical School of Hanoi in 1902, and was its first director, until 1904.

Yersin tried his hand at agriculture and was a pioneer in the cultivation of rubber trees (&quot;Hevea brasiliensis&quot;) imported from Brazil into Indochina. For this purpose, he obtained in 1897 a concession from the government to establish an agricultural station at Suoi Dau. He opened a new station at Hon Ba in 1915, where he tried to acclimatize the quinine tree (&quot;Cinchona ledgeriana&quot;), which was imported from the Andes in South America by the Spaniards, and which produced the first known effective remedy for preventing and treating malaria, a disease which prevails in Southeast Asia to this day.

Alexandre Yersin is well remembered in Vietnam, where he was affectionately called Ông Năm (Mr Nam/Fifth) by the people.

On 8 January 1902, Yersin was accredited to be the first Headmaster of Hanoi Medical University by the Governor-General of French Indochina, future president of France Paul Doumer.

In 1934 he was nominated honorary director of Pasteur Institute and a member of its Board of Administration.

==Death and legacy in Vietnam==
He died at his home in Nha Trang, in 1943.

Following the country&#x27;s independence, streets named in his honor kept their designation and his tomb in Suoi Dau was graced by a pagoda where rites are performed in his worship. Yersin Market in Ho Chi Minh City was named after him. His house in Nha Trang is now the Yersin Museum, and the epitaph on his tombstone describes him as a &quot;Benefactor and humanist, venerated by the Vietnamese people&quot;.

In Hanoi, the Lycée français Alexandre Yersin, a French international school was named after him.

A private university founded in 2004 in Da Lat was named &quot;Yersin University&quot; in his honour [Trường Đại Học Yersin Đà Lạt].

== Miscellaneous ==

Dr Yersin was credited with founding the site for the new town of Da Lat in 1893. Because of the high altitude and European-like climate, Da Lat became an R&amp;R spot for French officers. There was a high school named after him which was built in the 1920s, the Lycée Yersin, aka Grand Lycée (grade 6 to 12), the Petit Lycée (elementary to grade 5), and a university named after him which was built in the 2000s.

While in Hong Kong, Yersin was helped in his research by an Italian priest of the PIME order named Bernardo Vigano. He provided cadavers and assisted with his quest to find a remedy for the plague.

<text>30 Urania is a large main-belt asteroid that was discovered by English astronomer John Russell Hind on July 22, 1854. It was his last asteroid discovery. This object is named after Urania, the Greek Muse of astronomy. Initial orbital elements for 30 Urania were published by Wilhelm Günther, an assistant at Breslau Observatory. It is orbiting the Sun with a period of and is spinning on its axis once every 13.7 hours.

Based upon its spectrum, this is classified as a stony S-type asteroid. During 2000, speckle interferometry measurements from the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in the Canary Islands were used to measure the apparent size and shape of 30 Urania. This gave cross-sectional dimensions equivalent to an ellipse with a length of 111 km and a width of 89 km, for a ratio of 0.80.

The astrological symbol for Urania is , compass calipers.

<doc id="727909" wikidata="Q259109" url="?curid=727909" title="Café au lait">
<text>Café au lait (; ; French for &quot;coffee with milk&quot;) is coffee with hot milk added. It differs from white coffee, which is coffee with cold milk or other whiteners added.

In France it is typically served as a breakfast drink, often as a large portion in a handleless bowl. 

==Variations==
===Europe===
At home, &quot;café au lait&quot; can be prepared from dark coffee and &quot;heated&quot; milk; in cafés, it has been prepared on espresso machines from espresso and &quot;steamed&quot; milk ever since these machines became available in the 1940s—thus it merely refers to a &quot;coffee and milk&quot; mixture, depending on the location, not to a specific drink.

&quot;Café au lait&quot; and &quot;caffè latte&quot; are used as contrasting terms, to indicate whether the beverage is served in the &quot;French&quot; or the &quot;Italian&quot; way, the former being in a white porcelain cup or bowl, the latter in a kitchen glass and always made from an espresso machine, whereas &quot;café au lait&quot; might be espresso- or dark coffee-based.

===United States===

In many American coffeehouses, a &quot;café au lait&quot; is a drink of strong drip brewed or French pressed coffee, to which steamed milk is added; this contrasts with a &quot;caffè latte&quot;, which uses espresso as a base. American &quot;café au lait&quot; is generally served in a cup, as with brewed coffee, being served in a bowl only at shops which wish to emphasize French tradition.

At Starbucks, Cafe Au Lait is known as &quot;Caffe Misto&quot; which is served with 1:1 ratio of French Press brewed Coffee and frothed milk. 

&quot;Café au lait&quot; is a popular drink in New Orleans, available at coffee shops like Café du Monde and Morning Call Coffee Stand, where it is made with milk and coffee mixed with chicory. Unlike the European café style, a New Orleans-style &quot;café au lait&quot; is made with scalded milk (milk warmed over heat to just below boiling), rather than with steamed milk. The use of roasted chicory root as an in coffee became common in Louisiana during the American Civil War, when Union naval blockades cut off the Port of New Orleans, forcing citizens to stretch out the coffee supply. In New Orleans, café au lait is traditionally drunk while eating beignets dusted with powdered sugar, which offsets the bitterness of the chicory. The taste for coffee and chicory was developed by the French during their civil war. Coffee was scarce during those times, and they found that chicory added body and flavor to the brew. The Acadians from Maritime Canada brought this taste and many other French customs (heritage) to Louisiana.
