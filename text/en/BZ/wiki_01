<text>Diltiazem, sold under the brand name Cardizem among others, is a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker medication used to treat high blood pressure, angina, and certain heart arrhythmias. It may also be used in hyperthyroidism if beta blockers cannot be used. It is taken by mouth or given by injection into a vein. When given by injection, effects typically begin within a few minutes and last a few hours.
Common side effects include swelling, dizziness, headaches, and low blood pressure. Other severe side effects include an overly slow heart beat, heart failure, liver problems, and allergic reactions. Use is not recommended during pregnancy. It is unclear if use when breastfeeding is safe.
Diltiazem works by relaxing the smooth muscle in the walls of arteries, resulting in them opening and allowing blood to flow more easily. Additionally, it acts on the heart to prolong the period until it can beat again. It does this by blocking the entry of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. It is a class IV antiarrhythmic.
Diltiazem was approved for medical use in the United States in 1982. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 100th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6million prescriptions. An extended release formulation is also available.

==Medical uses==
Diltiazem is indicated for:
* Stable angina (exercise-induced) – diltiazem increases coronary blood flow and decreases myocardial oxygen consumption, secondary to decreased peripheral resistance, heart rate, and contractility.
* Variant angina – it is effective owing to its direct effects on coronary dilation.
* Unstable angina (preinfarction, crescendo) – diltiazem may be particularly effective if the underlying mechanism is vasospasm.
* Myocardial bridge

For supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT), diltiazem appears to be as effective as verapamil in treating re-entrant supraventricular tachycardia.

Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter is another indication. The initial bolus should be 0.25 mg/kg, intravenous (IV).

Because of its vasodilatory effects, diltiazem is useful for treating hypertension. Calcium channel blockers are well tolerated, and especially effective in treating low-renin hypertension.

It is also used as topical application for anal fissures because it promotes healing due to its vasodilatory property.

==Contraindications and precautions==
* In congestive heart failure, patients with reduced ventricular function may not be able to counteract the negative inotropic and chronotropic effects of diltiazem, the result being an even higher compromise of function.
* With SA node or AV conduction disturbances, the use of diltiazem should be avoided in patients with SA or AV nodal abnormalities, because of its negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects.
* Low blood pressure patients, with systolic blood pressures below 90 mm Hg, should not be treated with diltiazem.
* Diltiazem may paradoxically increase ventricular rate in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome because of accessory conduction pathways.

Diltiazem is relatively contraindicated in the presence of sick sinus syndrome, atrioventricular node conduction disturbances, bradycardia, impaired left ventricle function, peripheral artery occlusive disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

==Side effects==
A reflex sympathetic response, caused by the peripheral dilation of vessels and the resulting drop in blood pressure, works to counteract the negative inotropic, chronotropic and dromotropic effects of diltiazem. Undesirable effects include hypotension, bradycardia, dizziness, flushing, fatigue, headaches and edema. Rare side effects are congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and hepatotoxicity.
==Drug interactions==
Because of its inhibition of hepatic cytochromes CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, there are a number of drug interactions. Some of the more important interactions are listed below.

===Beta-blockers===
Intravenous diltiazem should be used with caution with beta-blockers because, while the combination is most potent at reducing heart rate, there are rare instances of dysrhythmia and AV node block.

===Quinidine===
Quinidine should not be used concurrently with calcium channel blockers because of reduced clearance of both drugs and potential pharmacodynamic effects at the SA and AV nodes.

===Fentanyl===
Concurrent use of fentanyl with diltiazem, or any other CYP3A4 inhibitors, as these medications decrease the breakdown of fentanyl and thus increase its effects.

==Mechanism of action==

Diltiazem, also known as (2S,3S)-3-acetoxy-5-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-2,3-dihydro-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,5-benzothiazepin-4(5H)-one hydrochlorid has a vasodilating activity attributed to the (2S,3S)-isomer.
Diltiazem is a potent vasodilator, increasing blood flow and variably decreasing the heart rate via strong depression of A-V node conduction. It binds to the alpha-1 subunit of L-type calcium channels in a fashion somewhat similar to verapamil, another nondihydropyridine (non-DHP) calcium channel blocker. Chemically, it is based upon a 1,4-thiazepine ring, making it a benzothiazepine-type calcium channel blocker.

It is a potent and mild vasodilator of coronary and peripheral vessels, respectively, which reduces peripheral resistance and afterload, though not as potent as the dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel blockers. This results in minimal reflexive sympathetic changes.

Diltiazem has negative inotropic, chronotropic, and dromotropic effects. This means diltiazem causes a decrease in heart muscle contractility – how strong the beat is, lowering of heart rate – due to slowing of the sinoatrial node, and a slowing of conduction through the atrioventricular node – increasing the time needed for each beat. Each of these effects results in reduced oxygen consumption by the heart, reducing angina, typically unstable angina, symptoms. These effects also reduce blood pressure by causing less blood to be pumped out.

==Research==
Diltiazem is prescribed off-label by doctors in the US for prophylaxis of cluster headaches. Some research on diltiazem and other calcium channel antagonists in the treatment and prophylaxis of migraine is ongoing.

Recent research has shown diltiazem may reduce cocaine cravings in drug-addicted rats. This is believed to be due to the effects of calcium blockers on dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling in the brain. Diltiazem also enhances the analgesic effect of morphine in animal tests, without increasing respiratory depression, and reduces the development of tolerance.

Diltiazem is also being used in the treatment of anal fissures. It can be taken orally or applied topically with increased effectiveness. When applied topically, it is made into a cream form using either petrolatum or Phlojel. Phlojel absorbs the diltiazem into the problem area better than the petrolatum base. It has good short-term success rates.

<doc id="724729" wikidata="Q3178582" url="?curid=724729" title="The Redemption of Althalus">
<text>The Redemption of Althalus is a stand-alone fantasy novel by David and Leigh Eddings. Its main character is Althalus, a professional thief enlisted by the Goddess Dweia to save the world from the desolations of her evil brother Daeva and his henchman Ghend.

==Plot summary==

===Life as thief===
The story revolves around Althalus, a professional thief with a gift for storytelling and a reputation for uncanny luck. After numerous disasters (Althalus believes that luck has left him for good), the thief decides to return to the savage lands of the north, where he grew up, and decides to rob a fort. After arriving there, and amusing everyone with his stories, Althalus breaks into the storeroom during the night only to find out that all the talk about gold in the fort were lies, and that there are only bags of worthless copper coins and a handful of brass coins. Furious, Althalus steals all the brass coins and leaves – only to become chased by every man in the fort, its owner taking advantage of the situation to claim the theft of a non-existent fortune. He escapes to Hule, where he finds refuge in a camp. A man named Ghend arrives there a short time later and presents Althalus with a proposition.

===The House at the End of the World===
Ghend hires Althalus to travel to the &quot;House at the End of the World&quot; to steal a book. Although he suspects something is amiss, Althalus accepts the job and heads there. After several days of travel he finds the house and manages to stumble upon the book, only to realize that the House is occupied by a talking cat who has trapped him. After several days of being trapped he finally decides to listen to the cat and thus finds out several astonishing things. The book is called the &quot;Book of Deiwos&quot;, Deiwos being the God who created the world, and the cat (named Emerald or Emmy by Althalus) teaches him to read it. After two and a half thousand years, Emerald reveals to Althalus that the book can be used to accomplish feats of magic .

===Rescuing the world===
Emerald tells Althalus that he has actually been in the house for many, many years. The intervening two millennia have seen many changes in the world, including the initial stages of an ice age triggered by the evil God Daeva. She also tells Althalus that Ghend is Daeva&#x27;s agent, and is working to establish Daeva as the ruler of the world. The cat and Althalus set out to gather a party of people who are destined to save the world from Daeva&#x27;s dominion. They try to find the knife which will guide them to each person. Having arrived at the knife&#x27;s depository, they are told that the knife has been taken by Eliar, a member of the army. With this new information they travel to Osthos, where Eliar seems to have become a slave. Deciding that they will have to buy off all the slaves, the two travel to Emerald&#x27;s private gold mine and collect twenty blocks of gold, which Althalus converts into coins. With their purses full, they return and meet Andine, the queen (or &quot;Arya&quot;) of Osthos, in her palace, posing as slavers. However, Andine won&#x27;t sell Eliar to them. Emerald worms her way into Andine&#x27;s affection in an attempt to persuade her to give up Eliar. Finally, the queen agrees to sell the other slaves along with Eliar. With the deal struck, Althalus leads his troupe out, but overhears Eliar planning on attacking him with the other soldier slaves. To break the soldier&#x27;s loyalty, he randomly picks a soldier and sends him several thousand feet into the air before bringing him back down and releasing the slaves, except Eliar, whom he keeps chained up. In the morning, Eliar decides that he will follow Althalus.

===Recruiting the party===
After buying some horses they head to Awes, where Emerald tells Eliar that he must show the writing on the knife to every priest in Awes and ask if they can read it. While doing this they discover an agent of Daeva, who screams in anguish after seeing the knife. Eliar quickly slays him and they hide the body under a pile of rocks. A young priest finds them, but it turns out that the priest is none other than the fourth member of their party, Bheid. With their new member ready, Emerald &quot;reads&quot; the knife, which leads them back to Osthos, where their fifth member is destined to be none other that the queen of Osthos: Andine.

Returning to Osthos, they camp out behind the walls of the city for the night. Formulating a plan, Althalus and Emerald sneak into Andine&#x27;s palace unnoticed. In her chambers, Emerald captures Andine in a spell, causing her to be little more than a puppet. Leading their newest member out of the city, they rejoin their group and decide to hastily leave before morning comes and Andine is discovered missing. Andine wants no part in this and focuses on killing Eliar, but the enchantment on the knife forces her to listen to Althalus, and so, with their newest member in tow, the party travels to Hule, to find their sixth member.

While traveling towards Hule, Bheid tries to quell Andine&#x27;s hatred towards Eliar – with limited success, but it appears to be taking effect when Andine refrains from making any scathing remarks towards Eliar. During the night, Althalus and Eliar hear someone sneaking towards their camp and capture the boy named Gher, who, it turns out, is their sixth member. Emerald finally sorts out the problems with Andine by using Gher as a voice, Andine (having a change of heart) helps clean up the beaten up Gher and they head to Kweron to find their final member; a &quot;witch&quot;.

In Kweron, Althalus and Emerald hatch up a scheme that involves Bheid; Bheid will pretend that he has come to collect the &quot;witch&quot; for interrogation, as well as predicting avalanches and lightning strikes (which Althalus will provide). Bheid is, at first, reluctant to lie that blatantly about something, but in the end, he agrees. After a conversation with the priests of the village, he finds out that the &quot;witch&quot; is about to be burned alive. Through the respect he has gathered by his &quot;forecasts&quot;, he can convince the priests to give the enigmatic Leitha into his care. Before leaving, Leitha reveals that she can &quot;hear&quot; the thoughts of other people.

===The final battle===
The group decides to travel back to the House at the end of the world. Dweia reveals the origins of why they must do what they do: 
:Deiwos, the Sky God – and Dweia&#x27;s brother – created the world, and filled the planet with living things, whom Dweia cares for. However, Daeva&#x27;s only role is to destroy parts of the universe, but only those which Deiwos and Dweia allow him to. Daeva tries to change this, and has Ghend find each member of his &quot;chosen ones&quot; to prepare to take over the world, and to do this he needs Deiwos&#x27;s book, to copy it and make a book of his own for this purpose.

After learning this, Althalus introduces Emerald, who in reality was Dweia all along, to the &quot;family&quot; and quickly explains the situation to them as well as telling them about Eliar&#x27;s ability to use the doors of the House to travel through Spacetime.

After getting acquainted with living in the house, they use the doors to return to Arum where they try to win Albron&#x27;s (the knife keeper&#x27;s) clan as allies, and show him the House as an act of trust. They know that they will need an army to combat Gelta&#x27;s archaic forces from the past. Calling a clan meeting they hire all the Arum clans and prepare themselves to fight against Gelta&#x27;s army. Thanks to the more modern warfare of their time, Gelta&#x27;s forces are easily crushed and, although Eliar is injured, with the help of Althalus&#x27;s powers, the remaining part of the enemy forces is defeated.

Ultimately, Ghend and Althalus face off in the House at the end of the world, ending with the destruction of the Book of Daeva, the defeat of Daeva, and the saving of the universe.</text><links>

<doc id="724730" wikidata="Q407988" url="?curid=724730" title="Clonazepam">
<text>Clonazepam, sold under the brand name Klonopin among others, is a benzodiazepine medication used to prevent and treat anxiety disorders, seizures, bipolar mania, agitation associated with psychosis, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and akathisia. It is a long-acting tranquilizer of the benzodiazepine class. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It is typically taken orally (swallowed by mouth) but is also used intravenously. Effects begin within one hour and last between eight and twelve hours in adults.
Common side effects may include sleepiness, weakness, poor coordination, difficulty concentrating, and agitation. Clonazepam may also decrease memory formation. Long-term use may result in tolerance, dependence, and life-threatening withdrawal symptoms if stopped abruptly. Dependence occurs in one-third of people who take benzodiazepines for longer than four weeks. The risk of suicide increases, particularly in people who are already depressed. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the fetus. Clonazepam binds to GABAA receptors, thus increasing the effect of the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
Clonazepam was patented in 1960 and went on sale in 1975 in the United States from Roche. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 57th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 11million prescriptions. In many areas of the world, it is commonly used as a recreational drug.

==Medical uses==
Clonazepam is prescribed for short-term management of epilepsy, anxiety, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.

===Seizures===
Clonazepam, like other benzodiazepines, while being a first-line treatment for acute seizures, is not suitable for the long-term treatment of seizures due to the development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects.

Clonazepam has been found effective in treating epilepsy in children, and the inhibition of seizure activity seemed to be achieved at low plasma levels of clonazepam. As a result, clonazepam is sometimes used for certain rare childhood epilepsies, but it is ineffective in the control of infantile spasms. Clonazepam is mainly prescribed for the acute management of epilepsy. Clonazepam is effective in the acute control of non-convulsive status epilepticus; the benefits, though, tended to be transient in many people, and the addition of phenytoin for lasting control was required in these patients.

It is also approved for the treatment of typical and atypical absences (seizures) and infantile myoclonic and akinetic seizures. A subgroup of people with treatment-resistant epilepsy may benefit from long-term use of clonazepam; the benzodiazepine clorazepate may be an alternative due to its slow onset of tolerance.

===Anxiety disorders===
* Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.
* Clonazepam has also been found effective in treating other anxiety disorders, such as social phobia, but this is an off-label use.

The effectiveness of clonazepam in the short-term treatment of panic disorder has been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials. Some long-term trials have suggested a benefit of clonazepam for up to three years without the development of tolerance. Clonazepam is also effective in the management of acute mania.

===Muscle disorders===
Restless legs syndrome can be treated using clonazepam as a third-line treatment option, as the use of clonazepam is still investigational. Bruxism also responds to clonazepam in the short term. REM sleep behavior disorder responds well to low doses of clonazepam. It is also used for:
* The treatment of acute and chronic akathisia induced by neuroleptics, also called antipsychotics
* Spasticity related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)

===Other===
* Benzodiazepines, such as clonazepam, are sometimes used for the treatment of mania or acute psychosis-induced aggression. In this context, benzodiazepines are given either alone or in combination with other first-line drugs such as lithium, haloperidol, or risperidone. The effectiveness of taking benzodiazepines along with antipsychotic medication is unknown, and more research is needed to determine if benzodiazepines are more effective than antipsychotics when urgent sedation is required.
* Hyperekplexia
* Many forms of parasomnia and other sleep disorders are treated with clonazepam.
* It is not effective for preventing migraines.

== Contraindications ==
* Coma
* Current alcohol use disorder
* Current substance use disorder
* Respiratory depression

==Adverse effects==
In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class.

===Common===
* Sedation
* Euphoria
* Motor impairment

===Less common===
* Confusion
* Irritability and aggression
* Psychomotor agitation
* Lack of motivation
* Increased libido
* Loss of libido
* Impaired motor function
** Impaired coordination
** Impaired balance
** Dizziness
* Cognitive impairments
** Hallucinations.
** Short-term memory loss
** Anterograde amnesia (common with higher doses)
* Some users report hangover-like symptoms of drowsiness, headaches, sluggishness, and irritability upon waking up if the medication was taken before sleep. This is likely the result of the medication&#x27;s long half-life, which continues to affect the user after waking up. While benzodiazepines induce sleep, they tend to reduce the quality of sleep by suppressing or disrupting REM sleep. After regular use, rebound insomnia may occur when discontinuing clonazepam.
* Benzodiazepines may cause or worsen depression.

===Occasional===
* Dysphoria
* Induction of seizures or increased frequency of seizures
* Personality changes
* Behavioural disturbances
* Ataxia

===Rare===
* Suicide through disinhibition
* Psychosis
* Incontinence
* Paradoxical behavioural disinhibition (most frequently in children, the elderly, and in persons with developmental disabilities)
** Rage
** Excitement
** Impulsivity

The long-term effects of clonazepam can include depression, disinhibition, and sexual dysfunction.

===Drowsiness===
Clonazepam, like other benzodiazepines, may impair a person&#x27;s ability to drive or operate machinery. The central nervous system depressing effects of the drug can be intensified by alcohol consumption, so alcohol should be avoided while taking this medication. Benzodiazepines have been shown to cause dependence. Patients dependent on clonazepam should be slowly titrated off under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional to reduce the intensity of withdrawal or rebound symptoms.

===Withdrawal-related===
* Anxiety
* Irritability
* Insomnia
* Tremors
* Headaches
* Stomach pain
* Hallucinations
* Suicidal thoughts or urges
* Depression
* Fatigue
* Dizziness
* Sweating
* Confusion
* Potential to exacerbate existing panic disorder upon discontinuation
* Seizures similar to delirium tremens (with long-term use of excessive doses)

Benzodiazepines such as clonazepam can be very effective in controlling status epilepticus, but, when used for longer periods of time, some potentially serious side-effects may develop, such as interference with cognitive functions and behavior. Many individuals treated on a long-term basis develop a dependence. Physiological dependence was demonstrated by flumazenil-precipitated withdrawal. Use of alcohol or other CNS depressants while taking clonazepam greatly intensifies the effects, including side effects, of the drug.

A recurrence of symptoms of the underlying disease should be separated from withdrawal symptoms.

===Tolerance and withdrawal===

Like all benzodiazepines, clonazepam is a GABA-positive allosteric modulator. One-third of individuals treated with benzodiazepines for longer than four weeks develop a dependence on the drug and experience a withdrawal syndrome upon dose reduction. High dosage and long-term use increase the risk and severity of dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal seizures and psychosis can occur in severe cases of withdrawal, and anxiety and insomnia can occur in less severe cases of withdrawal. A gradual reduction in dosage reduces the severity of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Due to the risks of tolerance and withdrawal seizures, clonazepam is generally not recommended for the long-term management of epilepsies. Increasing the dose can overcome the effects of tolerance, but tolerance to the higher dose may occur and adverse effects may intensify. The mechanism of tolerance includes receptor desensitization, down regulation, receptor decoupling, and alterations in subunit composition and in gene transcription coding.

Tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of clonazepam occurs in both animals and humans. In humans, tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of clonazepam occurs frequently. Chronic use of benzodiazepines can lead to the development of tolerance with a decrease of benzodiazepine binding sites. The degree of tolerance is more pronounced with clonazepam than with chlordiazepoxide. In general, short-term therapy is more effective than long-term therapy with clonazepam for the treatment of epilepsy. Many studies have found that tolerance develops to the anticonvulsant properties of clonazepam with chronic use, which limits its long-term effectiveness as an anticonvulsant.

Abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal from clonazepam may result in the development of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, causing psychosis characterised by dysphoric manifestations, irritability, aggressiveness, anxiety, and hallucinations. Sudden withdrawal may also induce the potentially life-threatening condition, status epilepticus. Anti-epileptic drugs, benzodiazepines such as clonazepam in particular, should be reduced in dose slowly and gradually when discontinuing the drug to mitigate withdrawal effects. Carbamazepine has been tested in the treatment of clonazepam withdrawal but was found to be ineffective in preventing clonazepam withdrawal-induced status epilepticus from occurring.

===Overdose===

Excess doses may result in:
* Difficulty staying awake
* Mental confusion
* Impaired motor functions
** Impaired reflexes
** Impaired coordination
** Impaired balance
** Dizziness
* Respiratory depression
* Low blood pressure
* Coma

Coma can be cyclic, with the individual alternating from a comatose state to a hyper-alert state of consciousness, which occurred in a four-year-old boy who overdosed on clonazepam. The combination of clonazepam and certain barbiturates (for example, amobarbital), at prescribed doses has resulted in a synergistic potentiation of the effects of each drug, leading to serious respiratory depression.

Overdose symptoms may include extreme drowsiness, confusion, muscle weakness, and fainting.

===Detection in biological fluids===
Clonazepam and 7-aminoclonazepam may be quantified in plasma, serum, or whole blood in order to monitor compliance in those receiving the drug therapeutically. Results from such tests can be used to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage. Both the parent drug and 7-aminoclonazepam are unstable in biofluids, and therefore specimens should be preserved with sodium fluoride, stored at the lowest possible temperature and analyzed quickly to minimize losses.

===Special precautions===
The elderly metabolize benzodiazepines more slowly than younger people and are also more sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines, even at similar blood plasma levels. Doses for the elderly are recommended to be about half of that given to younger adults and are to be administered for no longer than two weeks. Long-acting benzodiazepines such as clonazepam are not generally recommended for the elderly due to the risk of drug accumulation.

The elderly are especially susceptible to increased risk of harm from motor impairments and drug accumulation side effects. Benzodiazepines also require special precaution if used by individuals that may be pregnant, alcohol- or drug-dependent, or may have comorbid psychiatric disorders. Clonazepam is generally not recommended for use in elderly people for insomnia due to its high potency relative to other benzodiazepines.

Clonazepam is not recommended for use in those under 18. Use in very young children may be especially hazardous. Of anticonvulsant drugs, behavioural disturbances occur most frequently with clonazepam and phenobarbital.

Doses higher than 0.5–1 mg per day are associated with significant sedation.

Clonazepam may aggravate hepatic porphyria.

Clonazepam is not recommended for patients with chronic schizophrenia. A 1982 double-blinded, placebo-controlled study found clonazepam increases violent behavior in individuals with chronic schizophrenia.

Clonazepam has similar effectiveness to other benzodiazepines at often a lower dose.

== Interactions ==

Clonazepam decreases the levels of carbamazepine, and, likewise, clonazepam&#x27;s level is reduced by carbamazepine. Azole antifungals, such as ketoconazole, may inhibit the metabolism of clonazepam. Clonazepam may affect levels of phenytoin (diphenylhydantoin). In turn, Phenytoin may lower clonazepam plasma levels by increasing the speed of clonazepam clearance by approximately 50% and decreasing its half-life by 31%.
Clonazepam increases the levels of primidone and phenobarbital.

Combined use of clonazepam with certain antidepressants, anticonvulsants (such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine), sedative antihistamines, opiates, and antipsychotics, nonbenzodiazepines (such as zolpidem), and alcohol may result in enhanced sedative effects.

==Pregnancy==

There is some medical evidence of various malformations (for example, cardiac or facial deformations when used in early pregnancy); however, the data is not conclusive. The data are also inconclusive on whether benzodiazepines such as clonazepam cause developmental deficits or decreases in IQ in the developing fetus when taken by the mother during pregnancy. Clonazepam, when used late in pregnancy, may result in the development of a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the neonate. Withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines in the neonate may include hypotonia, apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress.

The safety profile of clonazepam during pregnancy is less clear than that of other benzodiazepines, and if benzodiazepines are indicated during pregnancy, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam may be a safer choice. The use of clonazepam during pregnancy should only occur if the clinical benefits are believed to outweigh the clinical risks to the fetus. Caution is also required if clonazepam is used during breastfeeding. Possible adverse effects of use of benzodiazepines such as clonazepam during pregnancy include: miscarriage, malformation, intrauterine growth retardation, functional deficits, carcinogenesis, and mutagenesis. Neonatal withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines include hypertonia, hyperreflexia, restlessness, irritability, abnormal sleep patterns, inconsolable crying, tremors, or jerking of the extremities, bradycardia, cyanosis, suckling difficulties, apnea, risk of aspiration of feeds, diarrhea and vomiting, and growth retardation. This syndrome can develop between three days to three weeks after birth and can have a duration of up to several months. The pathway by which clonazepam is metabolized is usually impaired in newborns. If clonazepam is used during pregnancy or breastfeeding, it is recommended that serum levels of clonazepam are monitored and that signs of central nervous system depression and apnea are also checked for. In many cases, non-pharmacological treatments, such as relaxation therapy, psychotherapy, and avoidance of caffeine, can be an effective and safer alternative to the use of benzodiazepines for anxiety in pregnant women.

==Pharmacology==

=== Mechanism of action ===
Clonazepam enhances the activity of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the central nervous system to give its anticonvulsant, skeletal muscle relaxant, and anxiolytic effects. It acts by binding to the benzodiazepine site of the GABA receptors, which enhances the electric effect of GABA binding on neurons, resulting in an increased influx of chloride ions into the neurons. This further results in an inhibition of synaptic transmission across the central nervous system.

Benzodiazepines do not have any effect on the levels of GABA in the brain. Clonazepam has no effect on GABA levels and has no effect on gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase. Clonazepam does, however, affect glutamate decarboxylase activity. It differs from other anticonvulsant drugs it was compared to in a study.

Clonazepam&#x27;s primary mechanism of action is the modulation of GABA function in the brain, by the benzodiazepine receptor, located on GABAA receptors, which, in turn, leads to enhanced GABAergic inhibition of neuronal firing. Benzodiazepines do not replace GABA, but instead enhance the effect of GABA at the GABAA receptor by increasing the opening frequency of chloride ion channels, which leads to an increase in GABA&#x27;s inhibitory effects and resultant central nervous system depression. In addition, clonazepam decreases the utilization of 5-HT (serotonin) by neurons and has been shown to bind tightly to central-type benzodiazepine receptors. Because clonazepam is effective in low milligram doses (0.5 mg clonazepam = 10 mg diazepam), it is said to be among the class of &quot;highly potent&quot; benzodiazepines. The anticonvulsant properties of benzodiazepines are due to the enhancement of synaptic GABA responses, and the inhibition of sustained, high-frequency repetitive firing.

Benzodiazepines, including clonazepam, bind to mouse glial cell membranes with high affinity. Clonazepam decreases release of acetylcholine in the feline brain and decreases prolactin release in rats. Benzodiazepines inhibit cold-induced thyroid-stimulating hormone (also known as TSH or thyrotropin) release. Benzodiazepines act via micromolar benzodiazepine binding sites as Ca2+ channel blockers and significantly inhibit depolarization-sensitive calcium uptake in experimentation on rat brain cell components. This has been conjectured as a mechanism for high-dose effects on seizures in the study.

Clonazepam is a 2&#x27;-chlorinated derivative of nitrazepam, which increases its potency due to electron-attracting effect of the halogen in the ortho-position.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Clonazepam is lipid-soluble, rapidly crosses the blood–brain barrier, and penetrates the placenta. It is extensively metabolised into pharmacologically inactive metabolites, with only 2% of the unchanged drug excreted in the urine. Clonazepam is metabolized extensively via nitroreduction by cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP3A4. Erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, cimetidine, and grapefruit juice are inhibitors of CYP3A4 and can affect the metabolism of benzodiazepines. It has an elimination half-life of 19–60 hours. Peak blood concentrations of 6.5–13.5 ng/mL were usually reached within 1–2 hours following a single 2 mg oral dose of micronized clonazepam in healthy adults. In some individuals, however, peak blood concentrations were reached at 4–8 hours.

Clonazepam passes rapidly into the central nervous system, with levels in the brain corresponding with levels of unbound clonazepam in the blood serum. Clonazepam plasma levels are very unreliable amongst patients. Plasma levels of clonazepam can vary as much as tenfold between different patients.

Clonazepam has plasma protein binding of 85%. Clonazepam passes through the blood–brain barrier easily, with blood and brain levels corresponding equally with each other. The metabolites of clonazepam include 7-aminoclonazepam, 7-acetaminoclonazepam and 3-hydroxy clonazepam. These metabolites are excreted by the kidney.

It is effective for 6–8 hours in children, and 8–12 hours in adults.

==Society and culture==

===Recreational use===

A 2006 US government study of hospital emergency department (ED) visits found that sedative-hypnotics were the most frequently implicated pharmaceutical drug in visits, with benzodiazepines accounting for the majority of these. Clonazepam was the second most frequently implicated benzodiazepine in ED visits. Alcohol alone was responsible for over twice as many ED visits as clonazepam in the same study. The study examined the number of times the non-medical use of certain drugs was implicated in an ED visit. The criteria for non-medical use in this study were purposefully broad, and include, for example, drug abuse, accidental or intentional overdose, or adverse reactions resulting from legitimate use of the medication.

===Formulations===
Clonazepam was approved in the United States as a generic drug in 1997 and is now manufactured and marketed by several companies.

Clonazepam is available as tablets and orally disintegrating tablets (wafers) an oral solution (drops), and as a solution for injection or intravenous infusion.

===Crime===
In some countries, clonazepam is used by criminals to subdue their victims.

<text>Chettinad (also known as Chettinadu) is a name that collectively refers to a locality that comprises 56 villages in the Sivaganga district and 20 villages in Pudukottai district, which was historically ruled by the Ramnad kingdom of Pandya Nadu. It has a small portion extending into the Pudukottai District in Tamil Nadu; Karaikudi is the major town of this area and is considered the urban centre for the Chettinadu villages.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;chettinad(u)&quot; comes from 2 Tamil words &quot;Chettiar&quot; and &quot;Nadu&quot;. &quot;Chettiar&quot; refers to a specific community of people and &quot;Nadu&quot; means land. Collectively called as &quot;land of the Chettiars&quot;.

==Demography==
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, many residents of Chettinad were trading in South and Southeast Asia, particularly Burma, Ceylon, Vietnam and Malaysia. By 2010, only 74 villages remained of the original 96, organised in clusters spread over a territory of in the Districts of Sivagangai and Pudukottai in the State of Tamil Nadu. It finds itself in the UNESCO nomination for palatial house sites of historic and cultural value. It is located on the national highway NH536 between Trichy and Karaikudi which is approximately 10kms away from this place.

==Community==
Chettinad is the home of the Nattukottai Chettiars (Nagarathar), a prosperous banking and business community and for high hierarchy, non-Brahmin Vallambar feudal community with an aristocrat title Nattar - Ambalam. It is also known for its local cuisine, architecture, and religious temples.

===Chettinad cuisine===
The word &quot;Chettiar&quot; refers to the social caste of mercantile bankers. The &quot;Chettiars&quot; are known to be traders in salt and spices and this is reflected in the Chettinad cuisine. Meals also consist of cooked lentils, Brinjal curry, drumstick sambar, ghee for flavouring rice, and sweet meals like &quot;payasam&quot; and &quot;paal paniyaram&quot;. Some well-known local dishes are Chicken Chettinad (spicy chicken curry), Vegetable Chettinad (a vegetable curry) and dishes featuring seafood.

===Architecture===

The Chettinad region is well known for its 19th-century mansions, whose wide courtyards and spacious rooms are embellished with marble and teak. Construction materials, decorative items, and furnishings were mostly imported from East Asian countries and Europe. The marble was brought from Italy, chandeliers and teak from Burma, crockery from Indonesia, crystals from Europe and wall-to-wall mirrors from Belgium.

Many of these mansions were built using a type of limestone known as &quot;karai.&quot; According to locals the mansion walls were polished with a paste made out of egg whites and palm sugar to give them a smooth texture and for their cooling qualities.

===Temples===
Originally built by early Tamil dynasties like the Cholas, the temples of Chettinad stand testimony to the spiritual beliefs of local people. Temples are built according to Vaastu Shastras and Agamas as the Chettinad wealthy sponsored the buildings and the &quot;shilpis&quot; after the royal families declined. On a side note, traditional houses were also built according to ancient text in an architectural style called Vaastu Shastras.

Each temple has its own tank called &quot;oorani&quot; where water lilies are grown and used for holy rituals. Even today, much of Chettinad&#x27;s daily activities are centered around the festivities of the temple. Among the many famous temples are: Vairavan Kovil, Iraniyur, Karpaga Vinayakar, Kundrakudi Murugan, Kottaiyur Sivan, and Kandanur Sivan temples, with each having its own unique deity.

Vinayagar Chathurthi is celebrated every year, on the day when the two stars Shasti and Sadhayam mingle together. This day typically falls as the 22nd day after Periya Karthigai. Pillaiyar Nonmbu, its name, is usually in the month of December. On this day, they sing songs of the deity Lord Vinayagar and then take a sweet called &quot;Ellai&quot;.

==Local crafts==

===Sari===
The cotton sari, also known as &quot;kandaangi&quot;, is unique in its dramatic patterns and colours. Its vibrance and weight are its distinguishing factors. Records and old photographs show the use of sari by previous generations, before the advent of blouses and underskirts, and thus worn rather differently from the typical contemporary sari. At present, it is available in Kundi.

===Aathangudi tiles===
Athangudi tiles, named after the place of the manufacture in Chettinad, come in a myriad of colours and patterns, and are made by a unique process using local soil and glass plates. These tiles are a testament to the rich cultural heritage of the Chettiar community, who effectively adapted many influences to their own brand of local craftsmanship. The designs and colours used in Athangudi tiles are still those of a bygone era. However, of late, new designs and patterns are being incorporated.

The Athangudi tiles are hand-made. However, with a short shelf life and relatively slow manufacturing process, these tiles are not much in demand. The situation has led to the decline in the market.

==Industry==

Chettinad&#x27;s principal town, Karaikudi is also the location of a branch of the Central Electro Chemical Research Institute (CECRI), one of the forty national laboratories under the aegis of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in New Delhi. The CSIR lab specialises in electro-chemical research and has been operational for more than fifty years. The campus is on over 300 scenic acres (120 ha), filled with traditional and ornamental vegetation. CECRI conducts four-year Engineering and Technology courses in chemical and electro-chemical engineering and technology affiliated with the Anna University in Chennai.

==Travel==
The nearest airports are Madurai International Airport and Tiruchirappalli International Airport while the largest towns in the area are Karaikudi and Devakottai.

Chettinad has its own railway station, but expresses don&#x27;t stop here. The only halting train is the thrice daily MEMU train running from Tiruchirapalli to Virudhunagar connecting Pudukottai, Karaikudi, Devakottai, Sivaganga, Manamadurai and Aruppukottai with Chettinad station. All the trains running in the Chennai-Tiruchirapalli-Manamadurai Section stop at Karaikudi. Karaikudi Junction railway station is the nearest major station.There are also frequent town buses connecting Chettinad to Karaikudi, Ponnamaravathy, Devakottai Pudukkottai and Aranthangi.

== Agriculture college ==
The Tamil Nadu Agriculture University established a Dryland Agriculture Research Station (DARS) in Chettinad which was later upgraded to Agriculture College and Research Institute. It has a total of 450 acres (182 ha) of Farmland adopted for Research and Education. It houses a Centre of Excellence in Dryland Farming (CEDF) and a Food Processing Research and Training Centre (FPRTC). The college currently offers an Undergraduate Course of Bachelor of science Honours in Agriculture.

<doc id="724734" wikidata="Q558526" url="?curid=724734" title="Cniva">
<text>Cniva ( mid-3rd century AD) was a Gothic king who invaded the Roman Empire. He successfully captured the city of Philippopolis (Plovdiv in Bulgaria) in 250 and killed Emperor Decius and his son Herennius Etruscus at the Battle of Abritus as he was attempting to leave the Empire in 251. This was the first time a Roman Emperor had been killed in combat against foreigners. He was allowed by the new Emperor Trebonianus Gallus to leave with his spoils and was paid tribute to stay out of the empire.

==Invasion of Moesia==
Cniva began the invasion of the Roman Empire when he crossed the Danube. He sent detachments throughout the Roman province of Moesia with forces of Goths, and Sarmatians. His considerable forces demanded the attention of the emperor Decius. 

The first column of Cniva&#x27;s army, a detachment of about 20,000 or so likely led by the chieftains Argaith and Gunteric, besieged Marcianopolis, without success it seems. Then they probably headed south to besiege Philippopolis (now Plovdiv in Bulgaria). Cniva&#x27;s main column under the King himself crossed the Danube at Oescus then headed eastwards to Novae, where he was repelled by the provincial governor (and future emperor) Trebonianus Gallus. Then the invaders headed south to plunder Nicopolis ad Istrum where Decius defeated them but not decisively. After these initial setbacks, the Goths moved southwards through the Haemus mountain and Decius pursued them (likely through the Shipka Pass) to save Philippopolis. This time Decius&#x27; army was taken by surprise while resting at Beroe/Augusta Traiana. The Romans were heavily defeated in the ensuing battle. Decius was forced to withdraw his army to the north at Oescus, leaving Cniva ample time to ravage Moesia and finally capture Philippopolis in the summer of 251, in part with the help of its commander, a certain Titus Julius Priscus who had proclaimed himself Emperor. It seems that Priscus, after receiving the news of the defeat at Beroe, thought that the Goths would spare him and the city. He was wrong and was probably killed when the city fell. Then the invaders began returning to their homeland, laden with booty and captives, among them many of senatorial rank.

The sack of Philippopolis invigorated Decius, who intercepted several parties of Germans, and repaired and strengthened his fortifications along the Danube, intending to oppose Cniva’s forces.

==Battle of Abritus==

Probably in July or August of 251, the Roman army engaged the &quot;Scythians&quot; under Cniva near Abritus. The strengths of the belligerent forces are unknown, but we know that Cniva divided his forces into three units, with one of these parts concealed behind a swamp. It seems that Cniva was a skilled tactician and that he was very familiar with the surrounding terrain. Jordanes and Aurelius Victor claim that Herennius Etruscus was killed by an arrow during a skirmish before the outset of the battle and that his father addressed his soldiers as if the loss of his son did not matter. He allegedly said, &quot;Let no one mourn. The death of one soldier is not a great loss to the Republic&quot;. However, other sources state that Herennius died with his father.

==Terms of peace==
After the battle, the new emperor, Trebonianus Gallus, let Cniva leave with his spoils, and aided the Goths&#x27; departure. He even promised to pay a tribute to Cniva in order to keep him from invading the empire again.

==Death==
In 271, the Emperor Aurelian conclusively defeated the Goths and killed their king Cannabaudes in battle. Based on the similarity of the names, that king might coincide with Cniva.

<doc id="724752" wikidata="Q1586734" url="?curid=724752" title="Disdyakis dodecahedron">
<text>In geometry, a disdyakis dodecahedron, (also hexoctahedron, hexakis octahedron, octakis cube, octakis hexahedron, kisrhombic dodecahedron) or d48, is a Catalan solid with 48 faces and the dual to the Archimedean truncated cuboctahedron. As such it is face-transitive but with irregular face polygons. It resembles an augmented rhombic dodecahedron. Replacing each face of the rhombic dodecahedron with a flat pyramid creates a polyhedron that looks almost like the disdyakis dodecahedron, and is topologically equivalent to it.

More formally, the disdyakis dodecahedron is the Kleetope of the rhombic dodecahedron, and the barycentric subdivision of the cube or of the regular octahedron. The net of the rhombic dodecahedral pyramid also shares the same topology.

==Symmetry==
It has Oh octahedral symmetry. Its collective edges represent the reflection planes of the symmetry. It can also be seen in the corner and mid-edge triangulation of the regular cube and octahedron, and rhombic dodecahedron.

The edges of a spherical disdyakis dodecahedron belong to 9 great circles. Three of them form a spherical octahedron (gray in the images below). The remaining six form three square hosohedra (red, green and blue in the images below). They all correspond to mirror planes - the former in dihedral [2,2], and the latter in tetrahedral [3,3] symmetry.

==Cartesian coordinates== 
Let formula_1.&lt;br&gt; 
Then the Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a disdyakis dodecahedron centered at the origin are:

   permutations of (±a, 0, 0)   &lt;br&gt;
   permutations of (±b, ±b, 0)   &lt;br&gt;
   (±c, ±c, ±c)   

==Dimensions==
If its smallest edges have length &quot;a&quot;, its surface area and volume are
:formula_2

The faces are scalene triangles. Their angles are formula_3, formula_4 and formula_5.

== Orthogonal projections ==
The truncated cuboctahedron and its dual, the &quot;disdyakis dodecahedron&quot; can be drawn in a number of symmetric orthogonal projective orientations. Between a polyhedron and its dual, vertices and faces are swapped in positions, and edges are perpendicular.
== Related polyhedra and tilings ==
The disdyakis dodecahedron is one of a family of duals to the uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.

It is a polyhedra in a sequence defined by the face configuration V4.6.2&quot;n&quot;. This group is special for having all even number of edges per vertex and form bisecting planes through the polyhedra and infinite lines in the plane, and continuing into the hyperbolic plane for any &quot;n&quot; ≥ 7.

With an even number of faces at every vertex, these polyhedra and tilings can be shown by alternating two colors so all adjacent faces have different colors.

Each face on these domains also corresponds to the fundamental domain of a symmetry group with order 2,3,&quot;n&quot; mirrors at each triangle face vertex.

<text>In geometry, a deltoidal hexecontahedron (also sometimes called a &quot;trapezoidal hexecontahedron&quot;, a &quot;strombic hexecontahedron&quot;, or a &quot;tetragonal hexacontahedron&quot;) is a Catalan solid which is the dual polyhedron of the rhombicosidodecahedron, an Archimedean solid. It is one of six Catalan solids to not have a Hamiltonian path among its vertices.

It is topologically identical to the nonconvex rhombic hexecontahedron.

==Lengths and angles==
The 60 faces are deltoids or kites. The short and long edges of each kite are in the ratio 1: ≈ 1:1.539344663...

The angle between two short edges in a single face is arccos()≈118.2686774705°. The opposite angle, between long edges, is arccos()≈67.783011547435° . The other two angles of each face, between a short and a long edge each, are both equal to arccos()≈86.97415549104°.

The dihedral angle between any pair of adjacent faces is arccos()≈154.12136312578°.

== Topology==
Topologically, the deltoidal hexecontahedron is identical to the nonconvex rhombic hexecontahedron. The deltoidal hexecontahedron can be derived from a dodecahedron (or icosahedron) by pushing the face centers, edge centers and vertices out to different radii from the body center. The radii are chosen so that the resulting shape has planar kite faces each such that vertices go to degree-3 corners, faces to degree-five corners, and edge centers to degree-four points.

==Cartesian coordinates==
The 62 vertices of the deltoidal hexecontahedron fall in three sets centered on the origin:

* Twelve vertices are of the form of a unit circumradius regular icosahedron.
* Twenty vertices are of the form of a formula_1 scaled regular dodecahedron.
* Thirty vertices are of the form of a formula_2 scaled Icosidodecahedron.

These hulls are visualized in the figure below:

==Orthogonal projections==
The deltoidal hexecontahedron has 3 symmetry positions located on the 3 types of vertices:
== Variations==

The deltoidal hexecontahedron can be constructed from either the regular icosahedron or regular dodecahedron by adding vertices mid-edge, and mid-face, and creating new edges from each edge center to the face centers. Conway polyhedron notation would give these as oI, and oD, ortho-icosahedron, and ortho-dodecahedron. These geometric variations exist as a continuum along one degree of freedom.

== Related polyhedra and tilings ==

When projected onto a sphere (see right), it can be seen that the edges make up the edges of an icosahedron and dodecahedron arranged in their dual positions.

This tiling is topologically related as a part of sequence of deltoidal polyhedra with face figure (V3.4.&quot;n&quot;.4), and continues as tilings of the hyperbolic plane. These face-transitive figures have (*&quot;n&quot;32) reflectional symmetry.

<text>Mandalay Bay is a 43-story luxury resort and casino at the south end of the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. It is owned by Vici Properties and operated by MGM Resorts International. It was developed by Circus Circus Enterprises and completed at a cost of $950 million. It opened on March 2, 1999, on the former site of the Hacienda hotel-casino. MGM acquired Mandalay Bay in 2005, and the Blackstone Group became a co-owner in 2020. Vici acquired MGM&#x27;s ownership stake in 2022.

Mandalay Bay has a tropical South Seas theme and covers . It includes a casino and 3,209 rooms. The 43-story tower includes a Four Seasons hotel, which has rooms on floors 35 through 39. It is managed separately from the Mandalay Bay hotel. In 1999, the Four Seasons became the first Las Vegas hotel to win the AAA Five Diamond Award.

Several additions opened in 2003, including the Mandalay Bay Convention Center, and a second hotel tower, THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. It has 1,117 rooms, and was renamed W Las Vegas in 2024. A shopping mall, Mandalay Place, was also added in 2003. Other features include a House of Blues club, the Shark Reef aquatic attraction, and an events center known as Michelob Ultra Arena. The resort also has an 1,800-seat theater, which has hosted several Broadway shows, including &quot;Chicago&quot; (1999–2000), &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; (2003–2009), and &quot;The Lion King&quot; (2009–2011). Since 2013, the theater has hosted &quot;Michael Jackson: One&quot;.

In 2017, gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire from the hotel&#x27;s 32nd floor, killing 60 people in attendance at an outdoor music festival nearby. It is the deadliest shooting by a lone gunman in U.S. history.

==History==

Mandalay Bay was built on the former site of the Hacienda hotel and casino at the southern end of the Las Vegas Strip. In 1995, Circus Circus Enterprises purchased the Hacienda for $80 million and an adjacent site, directly south, for $73 million. That June, plans were announced for a new resort project, tentatively known as Millennium, to replace the Hacienda.

The Hacienda closed on December 1, 1996, and was demolished on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Details about its replacement were unveiled on the same day; the tropical-themed resort, now known under the working title &quot;Project Paradise&quot;, had an estimated budget of $800 million to $1 billion, with completion expected by the end of 1998. The target clientele would be higher-end compared to Circus&#x27; prior resorts, competing against The Mirage and new properties such as the Venetian and Paris resorts. It was planned as part of a larger project known as the Masterplan Mile, a complex which would include two other new resorts by Circus, although these never materialized. 

Construction on Project Paradise began in 1997. Problems arose during construction in mid-1998, because of excessive and uneven settling of the soil beneath the resort; the core of the building sank by , while one of the wings had settled by only . Rumors about the severity of the issues depressed Circus Circus&#x27;s stock price. The problem was solved by installing 536 micropiles (200-foot-long metal pipes filled with grout, each capped with a hydraulic jack) below the building, at an estimated cost of $8 million to $10 million. The damage from the settling was limited to minor cracks in the resort&#x27;s valet parking facility.

In February 1998, the project was officially named Mandalay Bay, after the city of Mandalay in Myanmar. The name was also chosen to evoke the exotic tropical romanticism of the poem &quot;Mandalay&quot; by Rudyard Kipling. More than a dozen names had been considered for the resort. Mandalay Bay cost $950 million to build, making it the most expensive project to date for Circus Circus. The company expected to spend more than $10 million on a print and television advertising campaign in the months leading up to the resort&#x27;s opening.

Mandalay Bay opened at 10:00 p.m. on March 2, 1999, following a private opening for VIPs earlier in the day that included numerous celebrities. Grand opening festivities included the Blues Brothers (Dan Aykroyd, James Belushi, and John Goodman) leading a procession of 200 motorcycles to Mandalay Bay&#x27;s front doors. Later, they performed at the resort&#x27;s House of Blues club, as did Bob Dylan. Mandalay Bay employed 5,000 people, with 30 percent coming from other Circus Circus properties. The company changed its name to Mandalay Resort Group later in 1999, reflecting its flagship property.

In 2002, Mandalay Bay sought approval from the U.S. and Chinese governments to import two panda bears for exhibit at the resort. The property would build a glass-domed structure for the animals, next to the resort&#x27;s Shark Reef aquatic attraction and away from the casino floor. The panda exhibit would generate up to $50 million a year, which would be given to the Chinese government to further conservation efforts for the species. Critics viewed the proposed exhibit as an exploitative way to attract casino patrons. Ultimately, the resort did not gain approval to import the animals.

In 2003, the resort added a convention center and a second hotel tower. Two years later, the resort was bought by MGM Mirage as part of its acquisition of Mandalay Resort Group. In 2006, Mandalay Bay was investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice over complaints that the resort failed to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The property eventually spent $20 million to correct the entry doors of 3,000 hotel rooms, as they were deemed too narrow. The resort&#x27;s first major renovation began in late 2012, and continued into the next year, improving various areas of the property.

Stunt performer Andy Lewis achieved a new slacklining record at Mandalay Bay in 2013, walking 360 feet across a loose rope situated 480 feet above the property.

In January 2020, Mandalay Bay was named the pre- and post-game venue for the Las Vegas Raiders, a football team which plays at the Allegiant Stadium directly west of the resort. That month, MGM Resorts also announced that it would sell Mandalay Bay to a joint venture consisting of MGM Growth Properties and The Blackstone Group. MGM would own 50.1 percent of the joint venture, and Blackstone would own the remainder. Mandalay Bay would be leased to MGM Resorts, which would continue to operate the resort. The deal was finalized in February 2020. Vici Properties bought MGM Growth in April 2022, and then bought out Blackstone&#x27;s stake in Mandalay Bay in January 2023.

=== 2017 mass shooting ===

On October 1, 2017, gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire from his room on the hotel&#x27;s 32nd floor. He targeted concertgoers attending a music festival, located diagonally across from the resort. He killed 60 people and wounded approximately 867 others, before killing himself as authorities approached his room. The incident is the deadliest mass shooting by a lone gunman in U.S. history.

Mandalay Bay remained open following the shooting. Hospitality experts believed the massacre would have only a minimal impact on the resort&#x27;s revenue. Several hundred workers, out of 7,400, were laid off as a result of decreased visitation due to the shooting. MGM had also paused its marketing of the resort after the incident, which contributed to profit losses. Finances gradually improved, with a near-full recovery in 2019.

Resort security was increased as a result of the shooting, while MGM announced that it had no plans to rent Paddock&#x27;s suite out to future guests. Floors 31 through 34 were renumbered as 56 through 59. Numerous lawsuits were filed against MGM by the shooting survivors, alleging inadequate preventative measures at Mandalay Bay. The company and plaintiffs eventually settled for $800 million.

==Features==

The Mandalay Bay complex occupies 120 acres. The resort includes a casino. It initially opened with of gaming space, featuring 122 table games and 2,400 slot machines. As of 2006, the casino had one of the largest sports books in Las Vegas, with a wall of 31 television screens. The casino floor was renovated in 2013, with new carpeting and chairs added. The sports book was updated in 2018.

Mandalay Bay has a tropical South Seas theme. Water features, including numerous fountains, are present throughout the resort. The hotel lobby features a two-story aquarium containing 12,600 gallons of water. The resort also has an aquatic attraction known as Shark Reef, which includes a aquarium. The $40 million facility opened on June 20, 2000, and contains the largest aquarium on the Strip, featuring mostly sharks.

The 12,000-seat Mandalay Bay Events Center opened on April 10, 1999, and was renamed the Michelob Ultra Arena in 2021. It has hosted numerous entertainers as well as sports games.

Construction on another facility, the Mandalay Bay Convention Center, began in 2001. Work was temporarily stopped due to the economic impact of the September 11 attacks. It eventually opened in January 2003, and is among the largest convention centers in the U.S. Convention business makes up a significant portion of the resort&#x27;s revenue.

When it opened, the resort included the Treasures of Mandalay Bay Museum, which had a rare currencies exhibit worth more than $40 million. Exhibit items included two $100,000 bills, among only a handful known to still exist.

The Luxor and Excalibur resorts, also built by Mandalay Resort Group, are located north of Mandalay Bay. The term &quot;Mandalay Mile&quot; was created by company president Glenn Schaeffer in reference to the three resorts, which are connected via the Mandalay Bay Tram.

===Hotels===

In addition to Mandalay Bay&#x27;s primary hotel, the property also includes two others: W Las Vegas (formerly THEhotel and later, Delano) and a Four Seasons hotel. Four Seasons shares a tower with Mandalay Bay, and W is operated in a second tower.

Mandalay Bay has 3,209 rooms, excluding the other on-site hotels. The Mandalay Bay tower is built out in a Y-shaped layout. Rows of gold neon tubing run up the tower&#x27;s sides, in between mirrored, gold-colored windows. Although the tower is 43 stories, the top four floors are numbered 60 through 63. Four Seasons occupies the 35th through 39th floors. The 40th through 42nd floors contain suites which are managed by Mandalay Bay. A club known as the Foundation Room operates on the top floor.

W Las Vegas originally opened in December 2003, as THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. It was renamed Delano in 2014, and became part of the W Hotels brand in 2024. Like the Mandalay Bay tower, W is also 43 stories. It has 1,117 rooms, all of them suites. It is marketed as a separate hotel.

The Mandalay Bay hotel rooms were upgraded in 2006, after MGM acquired the resort. A $100 million renovation of the rooms took place from 2015 to 2016, and further room renovations took place in 2023, ahead of the property&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

====Four Seasons====
In June 1996, Circus Circus Enterprises announced its partnership with Four Seasons Hotels, which would manage a hotel connected to Mandalay Bay. The Four Seasons hotel opened along with the resort on March 2, 1999. It marks the first Las Vegas location for Four Seasons Hotels, a luxury hotel company which, for years, had wanted to open a property in the area. The Four Seasons was built to compete with a growing number of upscale Strip resorts such as Bellagio.

The Four Seasons includes 424 rooms, and has various amenities – including restaurants, lounges, a spa, and a health club – which are located in a two-story facility on the south side of the Mandalay Bay property. Most of the amenities at the Four Seasons are inaccessible to guests of Mandalay Bay. The hotel excludes gaming, although Mandalay Bay&#x27;s casino and other amenities are open to guests of the Four Seasons.

The Four Seasons has been favorably received by guests. Since 1999, it has been a repeat winner of the AAA Five Diamond Award. It was the first hotel in the Las Vegas Valley to win the award, and in 2000, it became the first in the area to add a permanent kosher kitchen. The hotel received a $30 million renovation in 2012, and was renovated again in 2023.

===Restaurants and clubs===

Mandalay Bay originally had 15 restaurants, 11 of which were leased out. Most of the restaurants opened with the resort, while three others debuted later in 1999.

Among the restaurants was Aureole by chef Charlie Palmer, named after another restaurant of his in Manhattan. The Las Vegas Aureole was designed by Adam Tihany and included a four-story wine tower made of glass and steel. It could hold 10,000 wine bottles, which were retrieved by harnessed workers, referred to as wine angels. The tower is surrounded by stairs descending into the restaurant. Aureole closed in April 2023, making way for Retro, a new restaurant by sibling chefs Bryan and Michael Voltaggio. Retro features a 1980s and 1990s theme, and Aureole&#x27;s wine tower was retained, serving as an exhibit space for various pop culture items.

Mandalay Bay also included Trattoria del Lupo, the first Italian restaurant by chef Wolfgang Puck. Other celebrity chefs include Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger, who opened Border Grill. A Russian-themed restaurant, Red Square, featured a 16-foot headless statue of Vladimir Lenin at its entrance. It also included a walk-in vodka freezer with a bar top made of ice.
The resort also featured several Asian restaurants, including The Noodle Shop, and Shanghai Lily. The latter was designed by Tony Chi, and eventually closed in 2011. The entrance to another restaurant, China Grill, featured a moat and working drawbridge, which could be lifted to provide privacy for reserved parties. The adjacent China Grill Cafe and Zen Sum served dim sum on a conveyor belt counter, while robot carts with camera sensors brought food to diners elsewhere in the restaurant.

By 2001, a new fine dining restaurant had opened as &quot;3950&quot;, named after the resort&#x27;s address. It served steaks and seafood, and included a lounge area with live cam footage of the Shark Reef. The restaurant was designed and managed by Mandalay Bay, unlike most of the others at the resort.

Chef Hubert Keller opened Fleur de Lys, a French restaurant, in 2004. It operated for six years, before being remodeled and renamed as simply Fleur. In 2011, the restaurant began offering a $5,000 burger, which included a bottle of Petrus wine. Chef Fleur eventually departed Mandalay Bay in 2021, and the resort took over ownership and operations of his restaurant.

As of 2006, Mandalay Bay had 23 restaurants. That year, chef Michael Mina opened his first steakhouse there, StripSteak. It also serves seafood, and includes a 70-seat bar and lounge area, serving more than 600 types of wine and more than 100 Scotch malts. Numerous restaurants were added in 2013, as part of ongoing renovations. Two decades after Mandalay Bay&#x27;s opening, four of its original restaurants remained in operation, including Aureole, Lupo, and Border Grill. Red Square closed later that year, and was eventually replaced by the S Bar.

A restaurant revamp began in 2023, and included the closure of Fleur. Mina replaced it with a second restaurant in 2024; known as Orla, it serves Mediterranean cuisine. Puck closed Lupo and opened a new Italian restaurant in its place known as Caramá, which also debuted in 2024.

====Rumjungle====

Rumjungle, a restaurant and dance club, opened with the resort. The three-story Rumjungle included the world&#x27;s largest rum bar and offered more than 100 varieties of rum. Guests would enter through an opening in a wall of flames. Rumjungle, which leased its space from the resort, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2010, to prevent its eviction. It alleged that Mandalay Bay broke its contract agreement, which stated that Rumjungle would be the sole nightclub at the resort; in 2008, Mandalay Bay opened a lounge venue known as &quot;eyecandy&quot;, and Rumjungle stated that its profits suffered since then. The resort countered that Rumjungle&#x27;s financial problems were due to the latter&#x27;s outdated facilities and the Great Recession. Mandalay Bay eventually prevailed in litigation and evicted Rumjungle in August 2010. A new nightclub, Light, opened in its in place in 2013, in partnership with The Light Group and Cirque du Soleil. It closed in 2022.

Swingers, a three-level golf and entertainment complex, opened in the former club space in 2024. The attraction includes four nine-hole golf courses, as well as bars, dining, and carnival games.

====House of Blues====

Mandalay Bay opened with a House of Blues music venue and restaurant, marking the chain&#x27;s seventh location. The two-story House of Blues includes capacity for 1,800 people during concerts. It also has a retail store. The Las Vegas House of Blues would compete against the Hard Rock Hotel, which was known for hosting rock performances at its Joint venue. House of Blues had wanted to open a Las Vegas location for years, and partnered with Mandalay Bay after discussions with the Las Vegas Hilton failed to produce an agreement. The venue has hosted numerous entertainers, including Carlos Santana, who began a residency in 2012. He has performed there for more than a decade, and extended his residency to May 2026. Two live albums were also recorded there: &quot;House of Yes: Live from House of Blues&quot; by Yes (2000), and &quot;Live in Las Vegas&quot; by Macy Gray (2005).

House of Blues also operates the Foundation Room, an upscale private bar and dining club on the hotel&#x27;s top floor. It targets wealthy individuals, such as casino VIPs, corporate executives, and celebrities. Club membership is acquired through annual dues. In 2014, MGM agreed to pay a $500,000 fine after undercover police officers, during a sting operation, were provided with drugs and prostitutes at the Foundation Room by its employees. In 2020, the club removed a statue depicting Mahavira of the Jainism religion. Religious leaders had objected to the statue, calling its presence in a casino club inappropriate and disrespectful.

===Mandalay Place===
Mandalay Bay includes a mall known as The Shoppes at Mandalay Place. The resort initially had 13 retail shops upon opening, with a full shopping mall planned for property between Mandalay Bay and the Luxor. Circus Circus Enterprises partnered with Westcor to develop the mall, and Nordstrom was announced as an anchor tenant in May 1999, with the mall&#x27;s opening scheduled for 2001. However, the project was set back after Westcor dropped out later in 1999, unable to secure a second anchor tenant. Construction stopped in 2000, after Nordstrom also backed out. In May 2002, Mandalay Resort Group announced that it would resume construction, with the mall scaled back from to .
Mandalay Place eventually opened in October 2003. It included 41 retailers, located along a 310-foot skybridge connecting Mandalay Bay to the Luxor. It opened with several retailers not found elsewhere in Las Vegas, in an effort to attract locals as well as tourists. Tenants have also comprised several restaurants, including two by chef Rick Moonen.

Among the mall&#x27;s notable retailers was the Reading Room, a bookstore popular for its author signings. The store was devised by Schaeffer, although the concept of a bookstore on the Strip was met with some skepticism. Schaeffer said, &quot;What could be a more obvious place for a bookstore than a destination that has nearly 40 million visitors a year?&quot; It was the only bookstore on the Strip until its closing in 2009.

Ivan Kane&#x27;s Forty Deuce, a speakeasy with burlesque 1940s-style dancers, operated at Mandalay Place from 2004 to 2009. 1923 Bourbon &amp; Burlesque opened in its place in 2014, serving as a cigar lounge with a Prohibition era theme. Its primary attraction consisted of performances by Holly Madison and a burlesque troupe. Because of a dispute with her business partners, Madison departed 1923 Bourbon &amp; Burlesque later in 2014, and it was renamed 1923 Prohibition Bar.

===Pool area===

The resort includes an 11-acre pool area known as Mandalay Bay Beach, which features 2,700 tons of sand imported from California. One of the pools includes a wave machine producing six-foot waves. It was designed to host championship surfing. The pool area also features a lazy river, and includes a stage for summer concerts, a stable since the resort&#x27;s opening. This popularized the concept of poolside concerts at Las Vegas resorts.

A topless sunbathing area known as Moorea Beach Club opened in 2003. It is named after Mo&#x27;orea, an island near Tahiti. The resort&#x27;s pool area became popular among local families following the closure of the Wet &#x27;n Wild water park in 2004. In 2013, The Light Group took over a area of the pool space and converted it into a dayclub and nightclub, known as Daylight Beach Club and Eclipse respectively.

==Shows==
The resort includes the 1,800-seat Michael Jackson: One Theatre, originally known as the Mandalay Bay Theatre. Among Las Vegas tourists, entertainment offerings became increasingly popular during the 1990s, in addition to gambling. Circus Circus Enterprises believed that Las Vegas had evolved enough to support a full-time Broadway show. A production of the classic Broadway musical &quot;Chicago&quot; debuted at Mandalay Bay&#x27;s 1999 grand opening and ran for one year. &quot;Storm&quot;, an original production show featuring Latin music, weather effects, and aerialists, ran from April 2001 to July 2002.
Both &quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;Storm&quot; failed to achieve wide success. Schaeffer acknowledged that the resort needed &quot;a more forceful and exciting show&quot;, prompting the addition of the Broadway musical &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; in February 2003. It had a successful run which ended in January 2009, after approximately 2,300 performances. It was replaced by another Broadway show, Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Lion King&quot;, which ran from May 2009 to December 2011.

During that time, resort executives realized that the property needed an A-list show, as many guests would travel elsewhere to see live entertainment. In response, Mandalay Bay partnered with Cirque du Soleil to create &quot;Michael Jackson: One&quot;, which eventually opened in May 2013. It is a music production show featuring numerous songs by late singer Michael Jackson.

==In popular culture==
Mandalay Bay made its film debut in the 1999 film &quot;Play It to the Bone&quot;, which shot in several areas of the resort. The first season of &quot;Las Vegas&quot; (2003) was also filmed partially at Mandalay Bay, which stood in as the fictional Montecito resort. Filming included the casino, lobby, and wave pool. A 2014 episode of &quot;Modern Family&quot;, titled &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, was also filmed at Mandalay Bay.

<text>Luxor Las Vegas is a casino hotel on the southern end of the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. The resort is owned by Vici Properties and operated by MGM Resorts International. The Luxor features an ancient Egyptian theme, and includes a casino and 4,407 hotel rooms. The resort&#x27;s pyramid is 30 stories and contains the world&#x27;s largest atrium by volume, measuring . The tip of the pyramid features a light beam, which shines into the night sky and is the most powerful man-made light in the world.

The Luxor was developed by Circus Circus Enterprises at a cost of $375 million. Construction began on April 21, 1992, and the resort opened on October 15, 1993, with 2,526 rooms. A renovation and expansion project, costing $300 million, took place from 1996 to 1997. The project included the addition of two 22-story hotel towers, as well as Nevada&#x27;s first 3D IMAX theater. The Egyptian theme was scaled back as well, including the removal of an indoor Nile River ride.

MGM acquired the Luxor in 2005. The company launched a $300 million renovation two years later, further scaling back on the Egyptian theme while adding new restaurants and clubs. An esports arena was added in 2018, the first to open on the Strip. The Luxor has hosted various entertainers, including comedian Carrot Top, the Blue Man Group, and magician Criss Angel.

==History==
===Construction and opening===

The resort was announced by Circus Circus Enterprises on November 14, 1991. Known temporarily as &quot;Project X&quot;, the pyramid-shaped resort would be built on the Las Vegas Strip. Groundbreaking took place on April 21, 1992, with the project by then known as &quot;Luxor&quot;, after the Egyptian city of the same name.

Veldon Simpson was the architect, while Yates-Silverman, Inc served as interior designer. President and owner Charles L. Silverman traveled to Egypt three times to study the country&#x27;s atmosphere. Of all the casino resorts that his firm had designed, Silverman called the Luxor &quot;the most interesting and difficult&quot;. Before the ancient Egyptian theme was chosen, Yates-Silverman had suggested developing the land with a moat and a real riverboat casino to traverse it. Egyptologists were hired to create and oversee the Luxor&#x27;s theme, which was prevalent throughout the resort. The interior included replicas of various Egyptian artifacts, made of fiberglass and plaster.

Perini Building Company served as general contractor. The project employed more than 150 contractors and 3,500 construction workers, several of whom died while building the resort. Waltek, a Cincinnati-based company, provided the metal-and-glass exterior for the pyramid. Standing 30 stories high, it was one of the largest metal-and-glass projects ever. The pyramid was topped off on July 9, 1993.

The Luxor cost $375 million to build. The resort was financed using internal cash flow from other Circus Circus properties and did not include any outside financial investors. Circus Circus chairman William Bennett said the most challenging aspect of construction was dealing with Clark County officials, who he felt were overly critical of the resort due to its pyramid shape. He claimed county regulations, including improved fire precautions, added unnecessary costs to construction.

The Luxor hosted a pre-opening event for hundreds of invited guests on the night of October 14, 1993. It opened to the public the following day at 4 a.m., welcoming thousands of people. It would compete against two other upcoming resorts, MGM Grand and Treasure Island. All three resorts had a family-oriented focus. The Luxor employed 4,500 workers.

Tupac Shakur, who was fatally shot in Las Vegas in 1996, had been staying at the Luxor during his visit to the city, although his injuries sustained from the drive by shooting occurred four miles from the resort.

===Renovations and ownership changes===

Within a few years of the Luxor&#x27;s opening, resort executives concluded that it needed to be improved and enlarged. A $300 million renovation and expansion was launched in January 1996, and was mostly finished a year later. The changes included two additional hotel towers. The casino interior, which was redesigned, had initially included sections dedicated to space travel and the skyline of New York City, both of which were removed. The Egyptian theme was also scaled back. The changes improved revenue, and the Luxor was a consistently profitable resort as of 2003. It was reported four years later that more people visited the resort than the actual city of Luxor.

Circus Circus Enterprises was renamed Mandalay Resort Group in 1999, and was acquired by MGM Mirage (later MGM Resorts International) in 2005. Two years after the acquisition, MGM announced plans for a $300 million renovation of the Luxor that would remove much of the Egyptian theme. Luxor president and chief operating officer Felix Rappaport said, &quot;We&#x27;re not a British museum with ancient artifacts, we&#x27;re a casino-resort. This was a brilliantly conceived building from the outside. The pyramid always created a sense of wow and wonder, but the inside never delivered on that promise.&quot; He further said: &quot;We are trying to be approachable. We want to be a cooler and hipper middle-market property. We want to be less themed but still a middle-market property.&quot; Despite the interior changes, the exterior Egypt theme remained in place. The resort added more adult-oriented and modern lounges, restaurants and clubs.

The hotel rooms were renovated in 2021. Vici Properties purchased MGM Growth Properties a year later, thereby acquiring numerous Strip properties, including the Luxor. MGM continues to operate the resort.

===2007 bombing===
On May 7, 2007, a homemade pipe bomb exploded in a vehicle in the Luxor parking garage, killing one man in his 20s. The victim, an employee at Nathan&#x27;s Famous hot dog restaurant in the Luxor food court, was the intended target. The resort was not evacuated, operations continued uninterrupted, and the parking structure as well as the casino were undamaged.

Two men were found guilty of the bombing, with the motive being the victim&#x27;s relationship with an ex-girlfriend of one of the perpetrators. In 2010, each was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

==Property overview==

The Luxor is at the southern end of the Strip, and is located between two other resorts developed by Circus Circus Enterprises: Excalibur to the north (opened in 1990) and Mandalay Bay to the south (opened in 1999). The Mandalay Bay Tram travels between the three properties.

The Luxor&#x27;s pyramid is 30 stories, standing . Its exterior sides are sometimes used for advertising. The pyramid includes the largest atrium in the world by volume, measuring . The resort&#x27;s exterior features a recreation of the Great Sphinx of Giza, located in front of the pyramid and facing the Strip. The recreation is 106 feet high, 80 feet wide, and 262 feet long (). Within the body of the sphinx is the resort&#x27;s porte-cochère. An obelisk stands in front of the sphinx.

The hotel includes 4,407 rooms. It originally opened with 2,526 rooms, all of them located in the pyramid. The rooms line the pyramid&#x27;s interior walls, and walkways outside the rooms overlook the atrium. The interior of the pyramid uses inclined elevators, traveling at a 39-degree angle, to bring guests to their rooms. The structure features eight elevators, with two at each corner of the pyramid. The two additional hotel towers added in 1996 are located just north of the pyramid. The ziggurat-shaped towers, designed by Klai Juba Architects, are 22 stories and added nearly 2,000 additional rooms. The exterior of the hotel structures, including the pyramid, is made up of black glass panels.

The Luxor includes a casino. Upon opening, it featured 2,500 slot machines, many of them Egyptian-themed. The casino also included 82 table games, a poker room, and race and sports books. A high-end gaming pit was added in the 1996–97 renovation. Giza Galleria, a small retail mall with 18 tenants, was also opened. In addition, the Mandalay Place mall is located on a skybridge that connects Mandalay Bay with the Luxor.



===Luxor Sky Beam===

The tip of the pyramid is three stories, and features a beam of light known as the Luxor Sky Beam. It is the most powerful man-made light in the world, using curved mirrors to collect the light from 39 xenon lamps and focus them into one intense, narrow beam. G-Force International Entertainment Corporation was hired to design, build and install the lighting system. Each lamp is 7,000 watts and cost approximately $1,200 as of 2001; at full power, the system costs $51 an hour to operate, with $20 of that going toward electricity.

The beam was activated on the night of October 14, 1993, and has operated reliably since then. On a clear night, it is visible up to away by aircraft at cruising altitude, such as over Los Angeles. Moths are also attracted to the light, which in turn attracts bats and owls.

The lamp room, located about below the top of the building, can reach temperatures of while the lights are operating. Because of the heat, the room is serviced by a staff of two workers during the day. Temperatures of have been recorded above the pyramid tip. The beam originally measured 42.3 billion candela, and shone high. Since 2008, only half the lamps have been lit as a cost- and energy-saving measure. The resort later surveyed tourists about the possibility of turning off the beam completely, an idea that was largely rejected.

===Other lighting===
Aside from the sky beam, the pyramid would blend in with the darkness of nightfall, as it initially lacked any other exterior lighting. In 1997, Bee Construction fitted the four outer edges of the pyramid with computer-guided strobe lighting. Four years had been spent researching and developing the $1 million project, and another two months were spent installing it. The project was accompanied by an outdoor sound system, allowing for synchronized light-and-sound shows.

The Luxor sued Bee in 2003, alleging that the lighting system contained design and construction flaws which resulted in frequent power shutdowns. The suit further alleged that Bee had failed to honor contracts to repair or replace the system components. New LED lighting was added along the pyramid&#x27;s exterior edges in 2019. The lights are programmable and feature a variety of colors.

==Attractions==

Upon its opening, the Luxor included the Karnak Lake, located in between the sphinx and obelisk. More than 100 computer-controlled fountains would spray water up from the lake by day, and as part of a free nightly show in which lasers shot out from the eyes of the sphinx. The lasers would project Egyptian imagery onto a high water screen formed by the fountains. The show was meant, but ultimately failed, to rival a popular Strip attraction, the volcano at the Mirage resort. At the end of 1995, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered a shutdown of all laser light shows within of McCarran International Airport, putting an end to the Karnak Lake attraction.

At its opening, the resort also featured the indoor Nile River Tour, a paid 15-minute ride that brought guests to different parts of the pyramid and passed by pieces of ancient artwork on a river that encircled the casino. The river was long, and was removed after three years.

Secrets of the Luxor Pyramid, created by visual effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull, also debuted with the resort. It consisted of three 15-minute attractions, including &quot;In Search of the Obelisk&quot;, &quot;Luxor Live&quot;, and &quot;Theater of Time&quot;. Each show took place in its own theater, with the final one projected on a seven-story screen. In 1996, the seven-story screen was repurposed as an IMAX theater showcasing various 3D films, the first Nevada venue to do so. Meanwhile, &quot;In Search of the Obelisk&quot; was successful enough to receive nationwide distribution at other IMAX theaters.

A indoor playground called Play, for children and adults, opened in 2024. It serves as immersive entertainment, providing various activities such as games and a bounce house. It has since pivoted to only for people 21+

===Museum and exhibits===

King Tut&#x27;s Tomb and Museum opened at the Luxor in December 1993. It consisted of four rooms dedicated to Egyptian history, featuring replicas of various ancient items; these were created for the museum by artists near Cairo, and Egyptologist Zahi Hawass gave his approval of the items before they were put on display. The museum&#x27;s centerpiece was a replica of King Tutankhamen&#x27;s tomb, as found in the Valley of the Kings. The replica cost approximately $360,000.

The museum closed in June 2008, part of the Luxor&#x27;s efforts to scale back on its Egyptian theming. The replica artifacts were donated to the Las Vegas Natural History Museum, where they are displayed in its &quot;Treasures of Egypt&quot; exhibit, opened in January 2010.

The King Tut museum was replaced by Titanic: The Artifact Exhibition, featuring various items from the &quot;Titanic&quot;, including The Big Piece. It opened later in 2008, along with ; both had previously been on display at the nearby Tropicana resort. Moving them to the Luxor required the removal of the IMAX theater and a game arcade.

An sports memorabilia exhibit, known as &quot;Score!&quot;, opened in 2012. Another exhibit, Discovering King Tut&#x27;s Tomb, opened in 2022, marking the 100th anniversary of the tomb&#x27;s discovery.

===Restaurants and clubs===
The Luxor opened with seven restaurants, and a food court was added in 1997. The following year, &quot;Gourmet&quot; named the Luxor among the top 50 resorts in the U.S., primarily because of its restaurants. Notable eateries around that time included the Luxor Steakhouse, and a French gourmet restaurant known as Isis.
Company American Bistro opened in 2007, with Nick Lachey, Paris Hilton and Wilmer Valderrama as investors. Isis was also replaced that year by CatHouse, a nightclub and restaurant with Kerry Simon as chef. It was modeled after a 1940s bordello. The restaurant portion closed in 2010, followed by the nightclub two years later. Other notable restaurants have included Tender, specializing in steaks and seafood.

Ra, a bar and nightclub, opened in December 1997. It was named after the Egyptian god of the sun, Ra. It was subsequently turned into the LAX nightclub, which opened in 2007 with a party hosted by Britney Spears. The two-level venue measured . LAX was popular among celebrities, and included Christina Aguilera and DJ AM as investors. The club proved to be successful, outlasting its original Los Angeles counterpart, before closing in 2017.

===Video gaming===

Upon its opening, the Luxor included the VirtuaLand video game arcade, created by Sega. The arcade later became known as Games of the Gods, before being removed in 2008.

The Luxor announced in 2017 that it would close LAX and convert it into an esports facility. Known as Esports Arena and part of an eponymous chain, it opened in March 2018, becoming the first esports venue on the Strip and only the second one in the Las Vegas Valley. The facility was added in an effort to attract the Millennial demographic. It was renamed HyperX Arena at the end of 2018, through a partnership with HyperX. The multi-level venue measures and includes a two-story video wall. As of 2023, the HyperX Arena had hosted 700 events and more than 500,000 people since its opening.

==Live entertainment==
The Luxor initially included the 900-seat Pharoah&#x27;s Dinner Theater. It hosted &quot;The Winds of the Gods&quot;, a show centered on a plot to overtake the Egyptian throne. It included chariot races, belly dancers, and a trained elephant. The theater later hosted an ice production known as &quot;Le Ice Show&quot;. The venue closed in December 1995, making way for convention space.

A 1,200-seat venue was subsequently added. Known as the Luxor Theater, it has since been expanded to 1,500 seats. A production show, titled &quot;Imagine, A Theatrical Odyssey&quot;, opened in the venue in 1997. The show closed at the end of 1999, with the Blue Man Group taking over the theater. They performed at the Luxor until 2005. After a decade of playing at other Strip resorts, the Blue Man Group returned to the Luxor in 2015, displacing the dance group Jabbawockeez.
The Broadway musical &quot;Hairspray&quot; opened in February 2006, replacing the Blue Man Group. Like most Broadway-to-Vegas shows, &quot;Hairspray&quot; was shortened from its original version for a new runtime of 90 minutes. The show experienced poor ticket sales and closed four months later.

Magician Criss Angel partnered with Cirque du Soleil to open a show at the Luxor, titled &quot;Believe&quot;. It debuted in 2008, and was the first Cirque show to feature an individual star. The show initially received criticism, prompting Cirque to give Angel more creative control and fine-tune it. &quot;Believe&quot; ran until 2016, when Angel and Cirque debuted a new show at the Luxor known as &quot;Mindfreak Live!&quot;, based on his television series &quot;Criss Angel Mindfreak&quot; (2005–2010). Angel ended his run at the Luxor in 2018, after 10 years of performances there.
In October 2019, Cirque debuted a new show known as &quot;R.U.N&quot;, described as bringing an action movie to life for its audience. The show took over and renovated the theater previously used by Angel. In a departure from previous Cirque shows, &quot;R.U.N&quot; lacked any acrobatic acts and featured rock and roll music, as well as stunts such as motorcycle jumps and pyrotechnics. The show was written by Robert Rodriguez, with music composed by Tyler Bates. &quot;R.U.N&quot; received mixed reviews and poor ticket sales, and it lacked the time and funds needed to make improvements, closing after four months.

In 2021, the Luxor debuted a variety show featuring acts from the television program &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. Originally titled &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent Las Vegas Live&quot;, the show was a collaboration between MGM, Syco Entertainment, and Fremantle. In 2023, the show was retitled &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent Presents Superstars Live&quot;, and it surpassed 500 performances.

Aside from its main theater, the Luxor also includes the 350-seat Atrium Showroom. &quot;Midnight Fantasy&quot;, a topless show, debuted there in 1999. It was created and is produced by Anita Mann, and the title has since been shortened to &quot;Fantasy&quot;. Comedian Carrot Top has shared the Atrium Showroom with &quot;Fantasy&quot; since 2005, when he signed on for what was originally a three-year residency. He is contracted to continue performing at the resort until 2030.

==In popular culture==
The Luxor is often viewed as a prime example of 1990s Postmodern architecture, and its sphinx appeared on the cover of architecture scholar James Steele&#x27;s book &quot;Architecture Today&quot;. The resort has appeared in numerous films, including &quot;Showgirls&quot; (1995), &quot;Synthetic Pleasures&quot; (1996), and &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; (1996). In &quot;Up in the Air&quot; (2009), main character Ryan Bingham is asked to take a picture in front of the Luxor. A futuristic, abandoned version of the pyramid is seen in &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; (2017), along with other famous landmarks in a post-apocalyptic Las Vegas.

Will Smith filmed the music video for &quot;Gettin&#x27; Jiggy wit It&quot; (1998) in the hotel&#x27;s lobby and in front of its sphinx. The resort was also featured in the television shows &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, &quot;Criss Angel Mindfreak&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. A replica of the Luxor, named &quot;The Camel&#x27;s Toe&quot;, appeared in the Las Venturas area of the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; (2004). The video game &quot;Call of Duty: Ghosts&quot; (2013) also features a mission set in Las Vegas, which includes an Egyptian-themed casino inspired by the Luxor.An Egyptian-themed nightclub appears in the Phantom Liberty (2023) expansion pack for the video game Cyberpunk 2077 (2020) that is inspired by the Luxor.

<doc id="724764" wikidata="Q721999" url="?curid=724764" title="Raymond Benson">
<text>Raymond Benson (born 1955) is an American writer known for his James Bond novels published between 1997 and 2003.

==Early life and education==
Benson was born in Midland, Texas and graduated from Permian High School in Odessa in 1973. In primary school Benson took an interest in the piano which would later in his life develop into an interest in composing music, mostly for theatrical productions. Benson also took part in drama at school and became the vice president of his high school&#x27;s drama department, an interest that he would later pursue by directing stage productions in New York City after attending and receiving a degree in Drama Production—Directing from the University of Texas at Austin.

==James Bond works==
In 1984, Benson wrote &quot;The James Bond Bedside Companion&quot;, a book dedicated to Ian Fleming, the official novels, and the films. The book was updated in 1988 and has since been re-released digitally without further updating. It was nominated for an Edgar Award by Mystery Writers of America in the Best Biographical/Critical Work category.

In 1985, he worked as a designer and writer on the computer game &quot;James Bond 007: A View to a Kill&quot;. He followed this in 1986 with work on a computer game version of &quot;Goldfinger&quot; and co-authoring the &quot;You Only Live Twice II&quot; module of the popular role-playing game &quot;James Bond 007&quot;.

In 1996, John Gardner resigned from writing Bond books. Glidrose Publications promptly chose Benson to replace him. As a James Bond novelist, Raymond Benson was initially controversial for being American, and for ignoring much of the continuity established by Gardner. The author did much to placate these concerns, however, and promptly embarked on regular tours to promote his novels in the UK, as well as occasional trips to mainland Europe. Several signing sessions were held at the offices of his UK publisher Hodder &amp; Stoughton, and at London booksellers Murder One and James Bond specialists Adrian Harrington Ltd. In total, Benson wrote six James Bond novels, three novelizations, and three short stories. He was the first Bond author since Ian Fleming to write short stories (published in &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazines and collected in anthologies published in 2008 and 2010).

Glidrose changed its name to Ian Fleming Publications commencing with Benson&#x27;s novel, &quot;High Time to Kill&quot;. Benson resigned from writing Bond books in 2003.

#&quot;Zero Minus Ten&quot; (1997)
#&quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; (novelization, 1997)
#&quot;The Facts of Death&quot; (1998)
#&quot;Midsummer Night&#x27;s Doom&quot; (short story, 1999)
#&quot;Live at Five&quot; (short story, 1999)
#&quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; (novelization, 1999)

#&quot;DoubleShot&quot; (2000)
#&quot;Never Dream of Dying&quot; (2001)
#&quot;The Man with the Red Tattoo&quot; (2002)
#&quot;Die Another Day&quot; (novelization, 2002)

Benson&#x27;s novel &quot;The Man with the Red Tattoo&quot; inspired the government of Japan&#x27;s Kagawa Prefecture in 2005 to erect a museum (the &quot;007 Man with the Red Tattoo Museum&quot;, dedicated to the book) and honor Benson with the title of Goodwill Ambassador.

In 2008 &quot;High Time to Kill&quot;, &quot;Doubleshot&quot;, &quot;Never Dream of Dying&quot; and an extended version of his 1997 short story &quot;Blast from the Past&quot; (a sequel to Fleming&#x27;s novel, &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;) were grouped and released as an omnibus called &quot;The Union Trilogy: Three 007 Novels&quot;. A second anthology entitled &quot;Choice of Weapons&quot; was published in 2010 and contained &quot;Zero Minus Ten&quot;, &quot;The Facts of Death&quot;, &quot;The Man with the Red Tattoo&quot;, and the short stories &quot;Midsummer Night&#x27;s Doom&quot; and &quot;Live at Five&quot;.

In April 2014, Benson and former Bond author Jeffery Deaver collaborated—the first such collaboration between former Bond continuation authors—as co-editors of &quot;Ice Cold--Tales of Intrigue from the Cold War&quot;, an anthology sponsored by Mystery Writers of America containing short stories about the Cold War.

On August 12, 2023, Ian Fleming Publications announced that Benson&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Zero Minus Ten&quot;, would be reprinted in the U.K. along with other continuation authors&#x27; works. Subsequently, on January 29, 2024, Ian Fleming Publications announced the publication of an e-book omnibus, &quot;James Bond: The Raymond Benson Years&quot;, containing his six original 007 novels.

==Other works==
Since authoring Bond novels, Benson has had a number of books published, including original suspense novels &quot;Face Blind&quot; (2003), &quot;Evil Hours&quot; (2004), the Shamus Award-nominated &quot;Dark Side of the Morgue&quot; (2009), &quot;The Secrets on Chicory Lane&quot; (2017), and &quot;The Mad, Mad Murders of Marigold Way&quot; (2022), as well as the non-fiction work &quot;The Pocket Essential Guide to Jethro Tull&quot; (Jethro Tull biography) (2002).

Benson was awarded the IPPY Gold (1st Place, tied) Medal in the Mystery Category from the Independent Publisher Book Awards for &quot;The Mad, Mad Murders of Marigold Way.&quot;

In 2004, Benson began writing the first of two books based on the acclaimed video game series, &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;, although both are credited to the pseudonym, David Michaels. Further titles in the &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; series have also been credited to David Michaels, but were not authored by Benson. The first book, &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell&quot; was published in 2004 followed by &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Operation Barracuda&quot; in 2005.

In 2008, Benson wrote &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Death&quot; about a private investigator who looks into the death of a rock star. The book spawned a second novel in 2009 called &quot;Dark Side of the Morgue&quot;, which was nominated for a Shamus Award for Best Paperback Original PI Novel by the Private Eye Writers of America. The two novels plus a short story, &quot;On the Threshold of a Death&quot;, were collected in 2011 as an e-book anthology, &quot;The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Detective&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;.

Benson also wrote the novelization of the video game &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; in 2008 and followed it in 2009 with a novelization of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;. His entry in the Gabriel Hunt pulp adventure series, &quot;Hunt Through Napoleon&#x27;s Web&quot;, appeared as an e-book in 2010 and was published in print in 2011.

Further video game novelizations continued in 2011, when Benson co-authored &quot;Homefront--the Voice of Freedom&quot; with John Milius, as a prequel to the THQ videogame &quot;Homefront&quot;. 2012 saw the announcement that Benson would also write &quot;&quot;, a prequel to the Square Enix videogame .

Benson&#x27;s first novel in a series of &quot;women&#x27;s action/adventure thrillers,&quot; &quot;The Black Stiletto&quot;, was published in September 2011. In anticipation of the book&#x27;s publication, Benson released a free downloadable e-book short story, &quot;The Black Stiletto&#x27;s Autograph&quot;. The second book in the series, &quot;The Black Stiletto: Black &amp; White&quot;, was published on May 30, 2012. &quot;The Black Stiletto: Stars &amp; Stripes&quot;, was published in 2013, and &quot;The Black Stiletto: Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; was published in early 2014. The fifth and final book of the saga, &quot;The Black Stiletto: Endings &amp; Beginnings&quot;, was published in November 2014.

On October 14, 2015, it was announced that Mila Kunis will be executive producing a television series based on &quot;The Black Stiletto&quot; book series for ABC Studios.

<text>RealMedia Variable Bitrate (RMVB) is a variable bitrate extension of the RealMedia multimedia digital container format developed by RealNetworks.
As opposed to the more common RealMedia container, which holds streaming media encoded at a constant bitrate (CBR), RMVB is typically used for multimedia content stored locally. Files using this format have the file extension &quot;.rmvb&quot;.

==Details==
RealMedia uses compression similar to MPEG-4 Part 10 encoders such as x264.

RMVB files are popular for distributing Asian content, especially Chinese television episodes and movies. For this reason, they have become noticeably present (though not entirely popular, partly due to their incompatibility with other media players) on file sharing platforms such as BitTorrent, eDonkey and Gnutella. 

On the Windows platform, the proprietary RealPlayer SP (RealPlayer 10 and later) and the open-sourced Media Player Classic support RMVB, using an appropriate DirectShow filter or Real Alternative. On Linux and other Unix-like platforms, MPlayer, xine, and Totem are able to play RMVB files using the open-source, reverse-engineered RMVB implementation in FFmpeg. The format is also supported for playback by the cross-platform VLC media player.

The file header for the format consists of the four bytes &quot;.RMF&quot; (hex 2E 52 4D 46), the same as the standard RealMedia format.

<doc id="724774" wikidata="Q1322927" url="?curid=724774" title="Pump It Up (video game series)">
<text>Pump It Up () is a music video game series developed and published by Andamiro, a South Korean arcade game producer.

The game is similar to &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;, except that it has five arrow panels as opposed to four, and is typically or mostly played on a dance pad with five arrow panels: the bottom-left, top-left, a center, top-right, and a bottom-right. Additional gameplay modes may utilize two five-panel pads side by side. These panels are pressed using the player&#x27;s feet, in response to arrows that appear on the screen in front of the player. The arrows are synchronized to the general rhythm or beat of a chosen song, and success is dependent on the player&#x27;s ability to time and position their steps accordingly.

The original version of the game was originally released in South Korea on 20 September 1999. The series has also expanded internationally to other markets, primarily in North America, South America, and Europe. It had slightly expanded into parts of Oceania as well.

&quot;Pump It Up 2024 Phoenix&quot; is the latest version of the series, having been announced on May 16, 2024. The update was available free of charge for &quot;Pump It Up 2023 Phoenix&quot; machines starting on May 27, 2024. &quot;Pump It Up 2024 Phoenix&quot; uses dark and light blue as its predominant colours.

Historically, &quot;Pump It Up&quot; has tried to cater to freestyle players in addition to &quot;technical&quot; players by including freestyle-friendly charts, and as a result, the game has a culture in the freestyle and breakdancing disciplines. However, in recent versions the game has shifted to focus more heavily on &quot;technical&quot; players, expanding the vast array of high-difficulty songs, step charts, and title-based achievements.

== History ==
=== 1999: &quot;The First Dance Floor&quot; and sequel ===
The first game was known simply as &quot;Pump It Up&quot; (&quot;PIU&quot;), and it was released to South Korean arcades in September 1999. It includes 15 songs, and it is retroactively known as &quot;Pump 1st&quot; in subsequent &quot;PIU&quot; releases. A sequel, &quot;Pump It Up: The 2nd Dance Floor&quot;, was released on 27 December 1999. It adds 23 new songs while removing &quot;Hatred&quot; by Novasonic from the first game. A home version known as &quot;Pump It Up The Fusion: The 1st N&#x27; 2nd Dance Floor&quot; was released at the end of 1999 for Microsoft Windows computers.

=== 2000s: International expansion, &quot;NX&quot; and &quot;Pro&quot; ===

Konami filed a lawsuit in Seoul, South Korea against Andamiro in 2000, claiming that &quot;Pump it Up&quot; infringed upon their design right for &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;. The court found in Konami&#x27;s favor, but Andamiro appealed. At the same time, Andamiro sued Konami in the state of California, claiming that DDR violated their patent for &quot;Pump it Up&quot;. Both suits were ultimately settled out of court, and the details were never publicly released.

&quot;Pump It Up The O.B.G: The 3rd Dance Floor&quot; was released on 7 May 2000 in South Korea. The name &quot;O.B.G&quot; is an acronym for Oldies But Goodies. A home version for Windows computers was also released later in 2000, while an expansion to &quot;O.B.G&quot; known as &quot;The Season Evolution Dance Floor&quot; was released in September 2000. Aside from one exception, future releases did not follow this numbering pattern, beginning with &quot;Pump It Up: The Collection&quot; on 14 November 2000, followed by an expansion titled &quot;The Perfect Collection&quot; in December 2000, and &quot;Pump It Up Extra&quot; in January 2001.

&quot;Pump It Up The Premiere: The International Dance Floor&quot; was released to arcades in June 2001. As its name suggests, it is the first title to be released outside of South Korea. That same year, &quot;Pump It Up: The Evolutionary Dance Floor&quot; was released for Windows computers in North America. The sequel, &quot;Pump It Up The PREX: The International Dance Floor&quot;, was released to arcades in November 2001. The name &quot;PREX&quot; is a combination of &quot;Premiere&quot; and &quot;Extra&quot; from previous games. Afterwards, &quot;The International Dance Floor&quot; became a series spanning 10 main releases, plus the first &quot;PREX&quot;.

&quot;Pump It Up NX&quot; introduced a new cabinet featuring a widescreen LCD monitor. The game continued to run at 480p, and upgrade kits for older machines remained available.

&quot;Pump It Up Pro&quot; is a spin-off of the &quot;Pump It Up&quot; series exclusive to the northernmost countries in North America, that being the United States and Canada.

=== 2010s: &quot;Fiesta&quot;, &quot;Infinity&quot;, &quot;Prime&quot; and &quot;XX&quot; ===
In 2010, two spin-offs of &quot;Pump It Up&quot; were released: &quot;Pump It Up Pro 2&quot; for experienced &quot;PIU&quot; players, and &quot;Pump It Up Jump!&quot; for children.

&quot;Pump It Up 2010 Fiesta&quot; was released to arcades worldwide on 6 March 2010. It was followed by two sequels: &quot;2011 Fiesta EX&quot; in 2011, and &quot;2013 Fiesta 2&quot; in late 2012 or early 2013.

&quot;Pump It Up Infinity&quot; was the final &quot;Pump It Up&quot; spin-off. It was released in January 2013 in the United States and Canada.

&quot;Pump It Up 2015 Prime&quot; was released in December 2014 in arcades. It is the first game in the series to run in 720p high definition on supported cabinets, although older cabinets ran the game at 480p standard resolution instead. A sequel, &quot;Pump It Up 2017 Prime 2&quot;, was released in November 2016, while a 2018 update features future improvements. &quot;Prime 2&quot; and the 2018 update are the final versions to support standard definition SD, SX, DX and GX cabinets.

&quot;Pump It Up XX 20th Anniversary Edition&quot; was released on 7 January 2019, to celebrate 20 years of the &quot;Pump It Up&quot; series. This version runs exclusively on cabinets with 720p high definition support. It was the longest running &quot;Pump It Up&quot; game of the decade at that time. Two months later, the servers of &quot;Prime 2&quot; were shut down on 28 March 2019.

=== 2020s–present: &quot;Phoenix&quot; ===
&quot;Pump It Up 2023 Phoenix&quot; was announced on May 10, 2023. This instalment is themed after the phoenix from ancient mythology, and the game&#x27;s interface uses orange as its predominant colour, with yellow used as a secondary colour. The game was released to South Korean arcades on July 17, 2023, and internationally in August 2023. &quot;Phoenix&quot; has received minor updates since its launch, with the latest consisting of version 1.08. Online support for &quot;Pump It Up XX&quot; was discontinued on December 11, 2023.

&quot;Pump It Up 2024 Phoenix&quot; was announced on May 16, 2024. This update will be available free of charge for &quot;2023 Phoenix&quot; machines on May 27, 2024. This update&#x27;s interface uses dark and light blue as its predominant colours.

== Development ==

&quot;Pump It Up Zero&quot; was released in the arcade in January 2006 before releasing on the PSP in October of the following year. &quot;Zero&quot; contained a brand new interface, now featuring previews of background videos and the ability for two players to play on separate difficulties. &quot;Zero&quot; also contained the Easy Station, a mode containing a modified interface and a selection of easy songs. The Mission Station contained sets of songs played with specific conditions that must be met when they are played – such as getting a specific amount of a judgment for instance.

&quot;Zero&quot; also introduced the &quot;Another&quot; step chart difficulty. Another Step songs are not entirely new songs. Rather, they are songs with steps which differ from their original counterparts drastically with some being very experimental in nature. Another Step songs are not given a specific category and are listed with the regular charts for each song. Generally the difficulty of Another charts range from easy to extremely hard, with some songs being impossible to complete without a second player. This has remained a standard feature in later games.

&quot;Pump It Up New Xenesis&quot;, or &quot;NX&quot;, was released in December 2006 with new tracks and a mode with nonstop remixes. The channel arrangement on &quot;NX&quot; was altered, now featuring a default channel containing all 29 new Arcade Station songs. NX is World Tour was a new series of missions for Mission mode named after capital cities of various nations throughout the world as well as after the developers of &quot;NX&quot; at Nexcade. It consists of a group of 64 missions of three songs each, all with unique step charts containing various challenges such as passing a song, or completing a song with specific conditions or goals to accomplish.

The Remix Station from Zero had been changed to the &quot;Special Zone&quot;: an area containing nonstop remixes, long versions of songs, and Another mode songs. All of &quot;Pump it Up Zero&quot;″s Another songs have also been moved to the Special Zone. Most of the unlocks, however, depend on playing through World Tour mode. In addition, a new cabinet style has been added to the lineup featuring a futuristic design and a 42&#x27; plasma display. Yahpp, who split from the BanYa team, became the project lead leading to a style similar to the early games.

Unlike in earlier games, the difficulty level of a song in &quot;NX&quot; is not visually represented by a number. Levels 1 through 14 are shown or visualized as star icons, each level corresponding to a half icon, while levels 15 to 22 are shown or visualized as skull icons, with each level corresponding to a whole icon. &quot;Pump It Up NX2&quot; displays both the stars/skulls and a digital level indicator. The Extra and the Prex series of games also use this graphical style. A &quot;????????&quot; rating is given to songs that are &quot;beyond the charts&quot;, gimmick charts that are meant to be impossible for one player, or charts that are meant for two players at the same time. The rating with 8 question marks (&quot;????????&quot;) was kept for extreme songs in later games outside of this series.

&quot;NX2&quot; released in December 2007, added support for Andamiro&#x27;s proprietary USB flash drives, which save player progress and worldwide ranking. A new metagame life system was introduced that allows players to play four songs instead of three if they have life left at the end of three songs. Getting an A ranking or higher allows the player to maintain their life points, however, anything lower than an A will cost the player life points. If a player does especially poorly their set will be reduced to only two songs.

The &quot;Pump It Up 2010 Fiesta&quot;: &quot;10th Anniversary Version&quot; added two new mission modes (Quest and Skill Up) and removed difficulty levels in favor of chart options, as well as a new &quot;Basic Mode&quot; for new players. The inclusion of &quot;Fiesta EX&quot; (2011) and the two sequels, &quot;Fiesta 2&quot; (2012~2013) and &quot;PRIME&quot; (2014~2015) feature a wide selection of music with Prime introducing the global Rank Mode. The next game in the series, &quot;PRIME 2&quot; (2016~2017~2018), introduced a new speed system named Auto Velocity, which is calculated by dividing the players Auto Velocity with the BPM of the selected song. In &quot;XX&quot; (2019~2020~2021~2022), A number of new features have appeared, such as Online Matching, a new title feature, step rewards and more. It is also the first game to only support HD, therefore, only supporting MK9 and MK10 systems. Currently, the newest game &quot;Phoenix&quot; (2023~2024) has a new scoring system, now having a maximum score of 1 million points, along with a plate system that depends on the accuracy rather than the combo. It also introduces Premium Mode which requires 2 credits for one player (51 misses break off system, exclusive songs, 6 hearts, and exclusive commands such as Pass M or Pass G) and Normal Mode which requires only one credit (Forced break on at the second stage and over, only 3 stages), moreover, Phoenix is the first game to not support USB as a viable way to load profiles and update the game, and Premium Mode is only available through the &quot;AM.PASS&quot; service, which requires the machine to be online, thus making Premium Mode as an online-exclusive game mode.

===The Pro/Infinity series===
&quot;Pump It Up Pro&quot; was released by Fun in Motion and Andamiro in 2007. The product is a spin-off of &quot;Pump It Up&quot;, and was developed separately from the main series with the intent of getting players who normally play 4-panel dance games to try 5-panel dancing. The game utilizes a heavily modified build of StepMania 4 for its engine and was purchasable as a cabinet or as an upgrade for existing &quot;Pump It Up&quot; machines running MK6 or MK7 hardware.

Kyle Ward is the project lead and is responsible for many of the songs and step charts in this series. Many elements of the game are inherited from &quot;In the Groove&quot;, a four-panel dance game which Kyle Ward was previously involved with, such as the ability to save stats and song edits on a USB flash drive. Andamiro built cabinets for and distributed &quot;In the Groove 2&quot;.

The Pro series is also unique among &quot;Pump it Up&quot; games due to its trademark style. These are the first games led by a non-Korean project head. The good will fostered by Kyle Ward working with Andamiro to create cabinets for &quot;In the Groove 2&quot; led to him being given a position within the company as a project creator, lead, and creative consultant.

The default mode is Easy mode, which offers a simplified user interface where a minimal number of options are selectable and the most difficult songs have been removed. The Revision 5 patch added Half Double mode as a difficulty which uses the 6 panels on the inside of the pad layout excluding the outer corners from play. &quot;Pump It Up Pro&quot; does not contain a separate mode for remixes and long versions, the long songs and remixes present on &quot;Pro&quot; are present in regular play, and require two rounds to play. In place of a Remix mode is Progressive, a mode containing courses consisting of four songs each. A sequel was released in 2010.

&quot;Pump It Up Infinity&quot; (2013) was intended as a reboot of the original &quot;Pro&quot; idea and introduces a &quot;Basic Mode&quot; to encourage new players. Infinity features songs from all &quot;Pump It Up&quot; versions, including the spin-off series &quot;Pump It Up Pro&quot; and &quot;Pump It Up Pro 2&quot;.

== Music ==

The songs used in &quot;Pump It Up&quot; are mostly South Korean-based. &quot;Premiere 3&quot; and &quot;Exceed&quot; were the only versions to put a greater emphasis on international pop music due to its branching into other markets such as North and Latin America. After &quot;Exceed&quot;, the focus shifted back to K-pop as the players worldwide generally favored the game&#x27;s original Korean music. Much of the music on &quot;Pump&quot; is contributed by an in-house (and mostly anonymous) collective known as BanYa. Two of the main members, Yahpp and Msgoon, recently became independent artists (and as of NX and Fiesta respectively, all of their songs are now branded using their aliases). Aside from the K-pop licenses, most in-house songs on &quot;Pump it Up&quot; are of South Korean influence. The diversity in genres is very great despite this, covering everything from general pop to heavy metal to hip hop as well as an assortment of uncommon genres such as jazz, folk, and ska. Some of BanYa&#x27;s songs include covers of classical pieces such as Canon in D (in which it become notorious), mostly performed in a symphonic rock style and has a tempo of 160 beats per minute.

In comparison to Konami&#x27;s Bemani line-up and other arcade rhythm games, there has been a negligible emphasis on electronic music in &quot;Pump&quot;, but the first instances of electronic music on &quot;Pump&quot; were on &quot;NX2&quot;, as five crossovers from the American-made spinoff appeared, which in contrast, has a greater emphasis on electronic music.

<doc id="724786" wikidata="Q1193612" url="?curid=724786" title="Nata de coco">
<text>Nata de coco, also marketed as coconut gel, is a chewy, translucent, jelly-like food produced by the fermentation of coconut water, which gels through the production of microbial cellulose by &quot;Komagataeibacter xylinus&quot;. 

Originating in Ramon, Isabela, &quot;nata de coco&quot; was invented in 1949 by Teódula Kalaw África as an alternative to the traditional Filipino &quot;nata de piña&quot; made from pineapples. It is most commonly sweetened as a candy or dessert, and can accompany a variety of foods, including pickles, drinks, ice cream, puddings, and fruit cocktails.

==Etymology==

 means &quot;cream of coconut&quot; in Spanish.

==History==
&quot;Nata de coco&quot; was invented in 1949 by Teódula Kalaw África, a Filipino chemist working for the National Coconut Corporation (now the Philippine Coconut Authority). It was originally conceived as an alternative to &quot;nata de piña&quot;, another gel-like Filipino dessert produced since the 18th century. This was because though the demand was high, &quot;nata de piña&quot; was seasonal, as it relied on pineapple harvests from the declining piña fibre industry.

Commercial production of &quot;nata de coco&quot; began in 1954, when the agency, renamed the Philippine Coconut Administration, opened a branch in Alaminos, Laguna and introduced the technology to local farmers. &quot;Nata de coco&quot; production was later optimized in the mid-1970s through the efforts of a team of microbiologists led by Priscilla C. Sánchez. In the 20th century, the demand for coconuts increased. Products from coconuts became a major export product of the Philippines, including &quot;nata de coco&quot;.

==Nutrition==
&quot;Nata de coco&quot; is mainly made from coconut water and so has a modest nutritional profile. One cup of it (118 grams) contains 109 calories, 1 gram of protein, and 7 grams of carbohydrates. It is often characterized as healthy since it contains dietary fiber to aid digestion while carrying fewer calories compared to other desserts, gram for gram.

==Production==
Commercially made &quot;nata de coco&quot; is made by small farms in the Philippines, especially in Laguna and Quezon, as well as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia, especially in Yogyakarta. It is commonly sold in jars.

The coconut water dessert is primarily produced through the following steps:
#Extraction of the coconut water,
#Fermentation of the coconut water with bacterial cultures,
#Separation and cutting of the produced surface layer of &quot;nata de coco&quot;,
#Cleaning and washing off the acetic acid,
#Cutting and packaging

==Dessert==
&quot;Nata de coco&quot; can be consumed on its own, but it can be used as an ingredient as well for fruit salads, &quot;halo-halo&quot;, coconut cakes, ice creams, soft drinks, bubble tea, and yogurts.

<text>Peter Louis Vincent de Freitas (2 August 1961 – 14 June 1989) was an English musician and producer. He was the drummer in Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, and performed on their first five albums.

== Career ==
De Freitas joined the Bunnymen in 1979, replacing a drum machine. Bunnymen&#x27;s singer Ian McCulloch said they told him &quot;to get stuck into the toms. Budgie, of the musical group Siouxsie and the Banshees, was the only other drummer doing that stuff at the time and Pete loved his drumming&quot;.

He funded, produced, and played drums under the name Louis Vincent on the first single of the Wild Swans, &quot;The Revolutionary Spirit&quot;, in 1982, for the Zoo Records label.

In 1985, de Freitas temporarily left the band. He spent several months drinking in New Orleans, while attempting to form a new group, the Sex Gods. By 1987, he returned to the Bunnymen to record their fifth album, though only as a part-time member. He was married in the same year and his daughter Lucie Marie was born in 1988.

== Death ==
De Freitas died in a motorcycle accident in 1989 at the age of 27, on his way to Liverpool from London. He was riding a 900cc Ducati motorcycle on the A51 road in Longdon Green, Staffordshire when he collided with a motor vehicle at approximately 16:00. His ashes are buried at Whitehill Burial Ground in Goring-on-Thames.

== Personal life ==
De Freitas was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, and educated by the Benedictines at Downside School in Somerset, south-west England. His father, Denis, was a copyright lawyer. His sisters Rose and Rachel were founding members of the band The Heart Throbs. His brother Frank is the bass player of the Woodentops.

<doc id="724792" wikidata="Q198019" url="?curid=724792" title="Los Angeles Union Station">
<text>Los Angeles Union Station is the main train station in Los Angeles, California, and the largest passenger rail terminal in the Western United States. It opened in May 1939 as the Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal, replacing La Grande Station, Central Station, and Salt Lake Station.

Approved in a controversial ballot measure in 1926 and built in the 1930s, it served to consolidate rail services from the Santa Fe, Southern Pacific, and Union Pacific railroads into one terminal station. Conceived on a grand scale, Union Station became known as the &quot;Last of the Great Railway Stations&quot; built in the United States. The structure combines Art Deco, Mission Revival, and Streamline Moderne style. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Today, the station is a major transportation hub for Southern California, serving almost 110,000 passengers a day. It is by far the busiest train station in the Western United States; it is Amtrak&#x27;s fifth-busiest station, and is the thirteenth-busiest train station in North America.

Four of Amtrak&#x27;s long-distance trains originate and terminate here: the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; to Seattle, the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; and &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; to Chicago, and the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; to New Orleans. The state-supported Amtrak &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot; regional trains run frequently to San Diego and also to Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo. The station is the hub of the Metrolink commuter rail system and is a major transfer point for several Metro Rail light rail and rapid transit lines. The Patsaouras Transit Plaza, on the east side of the station, serves dozens of bus lines operated by Metro and several other municipal carriers.

== History ==

The city council of Los Angeles had desired since the 1910s to construct a union station to replace the existing three terminal stations in Los Angeles: the Santa Fe&#x27;s La Grande Station, the Southern Pacific&#x27;s Central Station, and the Union Pacific&#x27;s Salt Lake Station. As the proposed station would be built and owned by the city and open to all prospective railroads, it threatened to break these three railroads&#x27; control over rail traffic into and out of the city. Their opposition led to a series of legal cases that were still not resolved by 1925, when the railroads offered a compromise solution. The Union Pacific&#x27;s Salt Lake Station had burned down in 1924, forcing it to rent space in the Southern Pacific&#x27;s Central Station. The railroads proposed to make this arrangement permanent, reducing the number of terminals to two, while also constructing a large network of elevated tracks at their own expense, to be used by them and the Pacific Electric. Not only would the new electrified tracks link the two terminals, but they would eliminate street running on some of the busiest streets in Los Angeles.

The railroads&#x27; proposal immediately generated public controversy for and against the proposal, and in February 1926 the council agreed to place a non-binding question on the ballot asking voters whether they were in favor of the city council&#x27;s union station proposal or the railroads&#x27; elevated railway plan. Proposition 8 asked &quot;Shall a Union Railway Passenger Terminal for all steam railroads be established in the City of Los Angeles?&quot;, while Proposition 9 asked whether the proposed station should be built in Los Angeles Plaza. The issue became extremely heated, with both sides fiercely arguing their point. Elevated railway proponents, such as the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; and the Greater Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, pointed to the safety benefits of the elimination of grade crossings and the benefits to businesses of reduced traffic congestion, as well as claiming that the proposed union station site would cause heavy road congestion. Union station proponents, such as the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and many homeowner associations, claimed that elevated railways harmed property values, made streets dangerously dark, produced unacceptable levels of noise, and were less safe than other forms of railroad. As the Los Angeles Plaza was near Los Angeles&#x27; original Chinatown, the debate took on racial connotations as well, with the &quot;Examiner&quot; claiming that being near Chinatown would mean that visitors to the city would receive a bad first impression, and the &quot;Times&quot; countering by arguing that the construction of the station would allow for urban renewal that would &quot;spell the passing of Chinatown&quot;.

When the two propositions were finally put to a vote, both passed; Proposition 8 by a 61.3 to 38.7 percent margin, and Proposition 9 by a much smaller 51.1 to 48.9 percent margin. However, largely due to the efforts of preservationist Christine Sterling and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; publisher Harry Chandler, Union Station would not replace the Plaza, but be built across the street in Chinatown, which was demolished for the project. During the construction process of Union Station, archaeological remains from the Tongva village of Yaanga were uncovered. Researcher Joan Brown summarized this in 1992:Previous archaeological studies conducted at and near Union Station indicate that buried intact prehistoric and historic deposits exist in-situ beneath and in the vicinity of Union Station. The extent of the archaeological deposits is unknown at this time. Union Station was constructed on three to twenty feet of fill dirt placed over the original Los Angeles Chinatown. Chinatown, in turn, had been built over the remains of an Indian village, tentatively identified as the village of Yangna.The glamorous new $11 million station (in 1939 dollars) took over from La Grande Station which had suffered major damage in the 1933 Long Beach earthquake and Central Station, which had itself replaced the Arcade Depot in 1914.

Passenger service was provided by the Santa Fe, Southern Pacific, and Union Pacific, as well as local lines of the Pacific Electric Railway and Los Angeles Railway (LARy). The famed &quot;Super Chief&quot; luxury train carried Hollywood stars and others to Chicago and thence the East Coast. Union Station saw heavy use during World War II, but later saw declining patronage due to the growing popularity of air travel and automobiles.

In 1948, the Santa Fe&#x27;s &quot;Super Chief&quot; lost its brakes coming into the station, smashed through a steel bumper and concrete wall, and stopped with one third of the front of the locomotive dangling over Aliso St. No one was killed or injured, but the engineer lost his job.

The station was designated as a Los Angeles Historic–Cultural Monument No. 101 on August 2, 1972, and placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

The first commuter rail service to Union Station was the short-lived CalTrain that began operating on October 18, 1982, between Los Angeles and Oxnard. The service faced economic and political problems from the start and was suspended in March 1983. The next attempt at commuter rail came in 1990 with the launch of the Amtrak-operated &quot;Orange County Commuter&quot;. The once-daily round-trip served stations between Los Angeles and San Juan Capistrano.

In December 1989, the Santa Fe Pacific Realty Co purchased Southern Pacific&#x27;s shareholding in the station, followed in January 1990 by Union Pacific&#x27;s 22% and Santa Fe&#x27;s 34%.

Metrolink commuter rail service began on October 26, 1992, with Union Station as the terminus for the San Bernardino Line, the Santa Clarita Line (later renamed the Antelope Valley Line) and the Ventura County Line. In January 1993, Metro&#x27;s Red Line subway began service to the station, followed by Metrolink&#x27;s Riverside Line in June. The &quot;Orange County Commuter&quot; train was discontinued on March 28, 1994, and replaced by Metrolink&#x27;s Orange County Line. In May 2002, Metrolink added additional service to stations in Orange and Riverside counties with the opening of the 91 Line (now the 91/Perris Valley Line.)

Light rail service arrived at Union Station on July 26, 2003, when Metro&#x27;s Gold Line began operating to Pasadena from tracks 1 and 2. The line was expanded south over US 101 in November 2009 with the opening of the Gold Line Eastside Extension.

In February 2011, the board of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) approved the purchase of Union Station from Prologis and Catellus Development (a descendant of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads) for $75 million. The deal was closed on April 14, 2011. Since taking over ownership of the station, Metro has focused on increasing services for passengers at the station. One of the most noticeable changes is the addition of several retail and dining businesses to the concourse.

Amtrak opened a Metropolitan Lounge at Union Station on September 23, 2013. The lounge is open to Amtrak passengers traveling in sleeping car accommodations as well as some Amtrak Guest Rewards members (Select Plus and Select Executive levels only). The lounge features a staffed ticket counter, complimentary refreshments, complimentary Wi-Fi, and a conference room. Passengers using the Metropolitan Lounge receive priority boarding.

Metro plans to install Bluetooth beacons in Union Station to enable sending text messages to travelers&#x27; smartphones.

On March 15, 2021, it was announced that the station would serve as a joint venue of the 93rd Academy Awards along with the Dolby Theatre due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema. The ceremony was criticized for limiting access to the station and its COVID-19 testing site due to security measures mandated by the Academy.

On October 19, 2022, Greyhound moved its primary Los Angeles station to the Patsaouras Transit Plaza at Union Station.

== Architecture ==


Union Station was partially designed by John and Donald Parkinson, the father-and-son architectural firm who had also designed Los Angeles City Hall and other landmark Los Angeles buildings. They were assisted by a group of supporting architects, including Jan van der Linden. The structure combines Art Deco, Mission Revival, and Streamline Moderne style, with architectural details such as eight-pointed stars, and even elements of Dutch Colonial Revival architecture (at the suggestion of the Dutch-born Jan von der Linden).

Enclosed garden patios are on either side of the waiting room, and passengers exiting the trains were originally directed through the southern garden. The lower parts of the interior walls are covered in travertine marble; the upper parts have an early form of acoustical tile. The floor in the large rooms is terra cotta with a central strip of inlaid marble (including travertine, somewhat unusual in floors since it is soft). The ceiling in the grand waiting room has the appearance of wood, but is actually made of steel.

The original ticket lobby has high ceilings and a counter. It is closed to the public, but occasionally rented out for film shoots or special events. Public art has been added to the station including an aquarium with a wall featuring etchings of Tongva and Latino settlers such as Pío Pico.

Inside the grand waiting room is the Traxx restaurant and bar, which is Art Deco-themed, reflecting the history and architectural grandeur of its home. The restaurant opened in the late 1990s, and became a &quot;top draw&quot; at Union Station, according to the Los Angeles Times. Traxx closed between May and September 2019 as ownership of the restaurant changed.

Attached to the main building to the south is the station restaurant designed by the famed Southwestern architect Mary Colter. It was the last of the &quot;Harvey House&quot; restaurants to be constructed as a part of a passenger terminal. The vast rectangular dining room has a rounded central counter, streamlined booths and inlaid cement tile floor in the pattern of a Navajo blanket.

Colter also designed a sleek, Streamline Moderne cocktail lounge. The restaurant closed in 1967 and for decades remained largely empty, used only for the occasional film shoot or special event. In October 2018, following a four-year renovation process, the dining room re-opened as the &quot;Imperial Western Beer Co.,&quot; a restaurant and bar with its own attached brewery, and the cocktail lounge re-opened as &quot;The Streamliner,&quot; a smaller craft cocktail bar.

Even with its grand scale, Union Station is still considered small in comparison to other union stations.

== Public art ==
Although Union Station contains no distinct sculptures or artworks from its early years, Metro rail development in the 1990s funded the installation of a variety of notable public art murals and sculptural installations for the station&#x27;s new subterranean lobbies, portals and subway platforms. The following Union Station public artworks include murals, granite seating sculptures, electronic wall-mounted art, glass mosaics, and a river-themed sculptural installation incorporating found objects from the subway excavation and an aquarium of native sea life.

== Location ==


Union Station is located in the northeastern corner of Downtown Los Angeles, on the property bounded by Alameda Street, Cesar Chavez Avenue, Vignes Street, and the Hollywood Freeway. It is across Alameda Street from L.A.&#x27;s historic Olvera Street and El Pueblo de Los Angeles State Historic Park. The historic Terminal Annex building is on the opposite side of the Chavez Avenue underpass. Chinatown and Civic Center are a short distance away.

The Patsaouras Transit Plaza on the east side of Union Station hosts several connecting bus lines, including Metro Local, Metro Rapid and Metro Express lines, as well as downtown DASH shuttles, many municipal bus lines, FlyAway express bus service to Los Angeles International Airport, Greyhound buses, and University of Southern California campus shuttles. The Transit Plaza is named after Nick Patsaouras, former RTD board member and advocate for public transportation.

The Gateway Transit Center includes the station itself and the Patsaouras Transit Plaza, both of which were designed by Ehrenkrantz &amp; Eckstut, along with the western terminus of the El Monte Busway, as well as Metro&#x27;s headquarters building.

, Amtrak and Metrolink share 12 of Union Station&#x27;s 14 outdoor tracks, with 94 trains departing on most weekdays (95 on Wednesday, 96 on Friday).

== Future expansion ==

===Link Union Station===
With the number of trains using Union Station expanding, the stub-end layout of trackage is limiting the station&#x27;s capacity. Trains can only enter or exit from the north side of the station. The configuration forces trains without cab-cars to slowly reverse in or out of the station and trains heading to or from the south to make a near-180 degree turn. Compounding the problem, is that while the station has 14 boarding tracks, multiple trains must squeeze onto just 5 tracks.

Originally, there were more tracks at &quot;the throat&quot;, but Metrolink had some removed to allow for faster speeds along the curves in and out of the station to improve efficiency as they enter or exit the station. This choke-point can delay arriving trains as they are forced to wait outside of the station to allow a departing train to exit the station. Departures are usually given priority, to free up platforms and to keep them from experiencing delays along their route.

Therefore, Metro has proposed the Link Union Station (Link US, formerly named Southern California Regional Interconnector) Project, which would extend tracks 3–10 as run-through tracks, which will exit Union Station and cross over the El Monte Busway and US Route 101/Santa Ana Fwy on a long, elevated &quot;S-curve&quot; that will tie into the existing tracks along the Los Angeles River. The plan also includes tracks along the river that would create a &quot;loop&quot; around the station allowing all trains (including those to/from the north or west) to use the run-though tracks.

Metro authorized preliminary engineering for the project in July 2012. A Request For Proposals (RFP) for Link Union Station was being prepared as of June 2013. The $31-million contract for the engineering work on the project was approved on April 24, 2014. The project&#x27;s estimated value is $350 million.

During construction, several tracks may be taken out of service due to their extension. To make up for the temporary loss of those platforms, track 13 was revitalized for use and tracks 14 &amp; 15 were re-constructed. The project was completed on October 17, 2012. Once the Link US project is finished, the run-through tracks and tracks 13–14 will be in regular use (track 15 will be used for storage), resulting in a 40% increase in track capacity.

On July 27, 2019, the Metro board officially approved and certified the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) for the Link US Union Station run-through tracks project. The FIER has an expanded central concourse hallway to replace the new elevated concourse proposed in the Draft EIR, and also eliminated the loop tracks. These modifications reduced project costs while prioritizing rider convenience while transferring between trains. A funding plan for the project was approved on April 21, 2020, with the project&#x27;s Phase A completion targeted for 2028.

In 2021, this project began construction, causing partial closure of platforms at this station. , Metro estimates that the first phase of the project will open in 2028.

====Former Run-Through Tracks Project====

California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and the Federal Railroad Administration previously drafted a plan to create run-through tracks at Union Station, but the project involved just four tracks and lacked the station &quot;loop&quot; limiting usage of the tracks just to trains heading to or from the south.

The final environmental impact report for the &quot;Los Angeles Union Station Run-Through Tracks Project&quot; was published by the FRA in November 2005.

=== California High-Speed Rail ===

Union Station is planned to be a major hub for the future California High-Speed Rail System. Upon completion, it is projected that passengers will be able to get from Union Station to the Salesforce Transit Center in the city of San Francisco in 2 hours and 40 minutes.

As a part of its Master Plan, Metro studied how to best integrate tracks and platforms for high-speed trains arrival into Union Station. Options included an aerial structure above the existing platforms, an underground structure under Alameda Street, an underground structure under Vignes Street and an aerial structure east of Vignes. All plans include a new concourse for high-speed rail passengers and three platforms with six tracks.

Since that time, the Link US project has resulted in changes to how High-Speed Rail (HSR) will be brought into Union Station. That project&#x27;s Final Environmental Report (FEIR) released in June 2019 indicates that HSR will approach the station from the north, on tracks 3 thru 6, use rebuilt station platforms 2 and 3, then exit to the south onto a new viaduct over the El Monte Busway and Santa Ana Freeway, which curves east (over a rebuilt and relocated Commercial Street) to return to the existing rail corridor along the west bank of the Los Angeles River. Thus, only four tracks and two platforms at Union Station will be used for HSR, with the remaining six tracks being converted to thru status and using the new viaduct to be shared by Metrolink and Amtrak lines. Tracks 13 thru 15 will remain stubs, ending at the south side of the station.

Construction on the run-thru track is expected to start between 2023-2025 with a planned completion between 2028-2033.

===Southeast Gateway Line===

Metro selected Union Station as the eventual northern terminus of the planned Southeast Gateway Line in 2022. The new light rail line will serve new platforms either at the Forecourt or behind the Metropolitan Water District Building and may open as early as 2043.

===Dodger Stadium gondola===

The Los Angeles Aerial Rapid Transit Project is a proposed aerial gondola connecting the station to Dodger Stadium.

===Brightline West===

The proposed Brightline West high speed line is scheduled to begin construction between Las Vegas and Rancho Cucamonga in late 2023 and is expected to be operational in mid-late 2027. It is planned to connect to Los Angeles Union Station via existing Metrolink services, though Metrolink schedules will line up with Brightline schedules to allow for transfers.

===Dreamstar Lines===

Dreamstar Lines intends to launch an overnight passenger train service from Union Station to San Francisco 4th and King Street station in 2025. 

== In popular culture ==
The facility served as a backdrop for the 1950 film &quot;Union Station&quot;, which starred William Holden and Nancy Olson. It has since been used in numerous films as a filming location, typically as a stand in for other fictional locations, including:

* &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (as a police station)
* &quot;Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid&quot;
* &quot;Drag Me to Hell&quot;
* &quot;Gable and Lombard&quot;
* &quot;Bugsy&quot;
* &quot;Nick of Time&quot;
* &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;
* &quot;Chandler&quot;
* &quot;In the Mood&quot;
* &quot;Private Eye&quot; (1987 TV movie starring Josh Brolin)

* &quot;The Italian Job&quot;
* &quot;Cry Danger&quot;
* &quot;Union Station&quot;
* &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (as Gotham City kangaroo court)
Union Station has been featured in numerous television shows, such as &quot;Adam-12&quot;, &quot;24&quot;, &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;, and &quot;Euphoria&quot;.

It has also been featured in video games; Union Station, as it was in the late 1940s, appears in &quot;L.A. Noire&quot;, while a smaller fictionalized version of the station appears in &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; as Unity Station.

Union Station was featured in &quot;Visiting... with Huell Howser&quot; Episode 222.

The music videos of Backstreet Boys&#x27; &quot;Chances&quot;, Fiona Apple&#x27;s &quot;Paper Bag,&quot; &quot;Drops of Jupiter&quot; by American band Train, directed by Nigel Dick; and &quot;Last Train Home&quot; by John Mayer, directed by Cameron Duddy; were filmed in Union Station. A significant portion of the music video for &quot;Vermilion&quot; by the band Slipknot was filmed within Union Station.

<text>San Miguel () is a primarily middle-class residential area of the City of Manila and is one of the city&#x27;s sixteen traditional districts.

== Background ==
Much of San Miguel is located on a riverine island, separated by the mainland by the Estero de (Stream of) San Miguel, and by the Pasig River. In order to reach the district, one has to cross any of the following bridges traversing Estero de San Miguel, from west to east: Carlos Palanca Bridge, P. Casal Bridge, Nepomunceno Bridge, Arlegui Bridge, San Rafael Bridge, Chino Roces Bridge (carrying Mendiola Street), Concepcion Aguila Bridge and J.P. Laurel Bridge. P. Casal Bridge&#x27;s logical extension is the Ayala Bridge, that connects it to the southern bank of the Pasig.

On the district&#x27;s eastern parts is another riverine island, bounded by the Estero de San Miguel and Estero de Sampaloc. A small part is on the mainland, at the far eastern corner.

San Miguel also includes the Isla de Convalecencia, the largest island in the Pasig River, which is home to the Hospício de San José, Manila&#x27;s oldest Catholic welfare institution.

Malacañang Palace, the seat of the Government of the Philippines and official residence of the President of the Philippines, is located in the neighborhood, and outside the Palace gates is Mendiola Street, a popular site for protests against the government.

The San Miguel district is also home to some colleges and universities that form part of Manila&#x27;s &quot;University Belt&quot; which encompasses San Miguel, and the districts of Quiapo and Sampaloc. Educational institutions that are located in the district include Far Eastern University, San Beda University, Centro Escolar University, College of the Holy Spirit, Saint Jude Catholic School, La Consolacion College Manila and Victorino Mapa High School.

San Miguel Brewery, where the popular San Miguel Beer was originally produced beginning in the Spanish colonial era, was located and, hence, named after San Miguel district. The brewery&#x27;s buildings were demolished after the property was transferred to the Philippine government, and it today forms part of the Palace complex.

== Barangays ==

San Miguel is divided into 12 barangays, grouped in three zones of the City of Manila. Barangays 637 to 640 are part of Zone 65, while Barangays 641 to 644 are part of Zone 66 and Barangays 645 to 648 are part of Zone 67.

==Attractions==

===Casa Roces===
Casa Roces is a 1930s ancestral house of the Roces family which was renovated and turned into a full-service restaurant, café and an art gallery. Casa Roces is located in the district of San Miguel, Manila right across Malacañan Palace, the official residence of the President of the Republic of the Philippines. 

Casa Roces was designed in the Pre-war modernist style with Art Deco articulation using a variety of construction materials which includes reinforced concrete, wood and masonry. On the ground floor, the distinguishing feature is the use of &quot;Machuca&quot; tile flooring which is typical with Commonwealth era house. The original layout of the rooms were changed to accommodate its new use as a restaurant and an art gallery.

<doc id="724804" wikidata="Q914681" url="?curid=724804" title="Prime (symbol)">
<text>The prime symbol , double prime symbol , triple prime symbol , and quadruple prime symbol are used to designate units and for other purposes in mathematics, science, linguistics and music.

Although the characters differ little in appearance from those of the apostrophe and single and double quotation marks, the uses of the prime symbol are quite different. While an apostrophe is now often used in place of the prime, and a double quote in place of the double prime (due to the lack of prime symbols on everyday writing keyboards), such substitutions are not considered appropriate in formal materials or in typesetting.

==Designation of units==
The prime symbol is commonly used to represent feet (ft), and the double prime is used to represent inches (in). The triple prime , as used in watchmaking, represents a ( of a &quot;French&quot; inch, or &quot;pouce&quot;, about ).

Primes are also used for angles. The prime symbol is used for arcminutes ( of a degree), and the double prime for arcseconds ( of an arcminute). As an angular measurement, means 3 degrees, 5 arcminutes and 30 arcseconds. In historical astronomical works, the triple prime was used to denote &quot;thirds&quot; ( of an arcsecond) and a quadruple prime &quot;fourths&quot; ( of a third of arc), but modern usage has replaced this with decimal fractions of an arcsecond.

Primes are sometimes used to indicate minutes, and double primes to indicate seconds of time, as in the John Cage composition &quot;433&quot; (spoken as &quot;four thirty-three&quot;), a composition that lasts exactly 4 minutes 33 seconds. This notation only applies to duration, and is seldom used for durations longer than 60 minutes.

==Use in mathematics, statistics, and science==
In mathematics, the prime is generally used to generate more variable names for similar things without resorting to subscripts, with generally meaning something related to (or derived from) . For example, if a point is represented by the Cartesian coordinates , then that point rotated, translated or reflected might be represented as .

Usually, the meaning of is defined when it is first used, but sometimes, its meaning is assumed to be understood:
* A derivative or differentiated function: in Lagrange&#x27;s notation, and are the first and second derivatives of with respect to . Likewise for and . Similarly, if , then and are the first and second derivatives of with respect to . Other notation for derivatives also exists (see Notation for differentiation).
* Set complement: is the complement of the set (other notation also exists).
* The negation of an event in probability theory: (other notation also exists).
* The result of a transformation: 
* The transpose of a matrix (other notation also exists)
*The dual of a vector space
The prime is said to &quot;decorate&quot; the letter to which it applies. The same convention is adopted in functional programming, particularly in Haskell.

In geometry, geography and astronomy, prime and double prime are used as abbreviations for minute and second of arc (and thus latitude, longitude, elevation and right ascension).

In physics, the prime is used to denote variables after an event. For example, would indicate the velocity of object A after an event. It is also commonly used in relativity: the event at in frame , has coordinates in frame .

In chemistry, it is used to distinguish between different functional groups connected to an atom in a molecule, such as and , representing different alkyl groups in an organic compound. The carbonyl carbon in proteins is denoted as , which distinguishes it from the other backbone carbon, the alpha carbon, which is denoted as . In physical chemistry, it is used to distinguish between the lower state and the upper state of a quantum number during a transition. For example, denotes the upper state of the quantum number while denotes the lower state of the quantum number .

In molecular biology, the prime is used to denote the positions of carbon on a ring of deoxyribose or ribose. The prime distinguishes places on these two chemicals, rather than places on other parts of DNA or RNA, like phosphate groups or nucleic acids. Thus, when indicating the direction of movement of an enzyme along a string of DNA, biologists will say that it moves from the end to the end, because these carbons are on the ends of the DNA molecule. The chemistry of this reaction demands that the be extended by DNA synthesis. Prime can also be used to indicate which position a molecule has attached to, such as 

==Use in linguistics==
The prime can be used in the transliteration of some languages, such as Slavic languages, to denote palatalization. Prime and double prime are used to transliterate Cyrillic yeri (the soft sign, ь) and yer (the hard sign, ъ). However, in ISO 9, the corresponding modifier letters are used instead.

Originally, X-bar theory used a bar over syntactic units to indicate bar-levels in syntactic structure, generally rendered as an overbar. While easy to write, the bar notation proved difficult to typeset, leading to the adoption of the prime symbol to indicate a bar. (Despite the lack of bar, the unit would still be read as &quot;X bar&quot;, as opposed to &quot;X prime&quot;.) With contemporary development of typesetting software such as LaTeX, typesetting bars is considerably simpler; nevertheless, both prime and bar markups are accepted usages.

Some X-bar notations use a double prime (standing in for a double-bar) to indicate a phrasal level, indicated in most notations by &quot;XP&quot;.

==Use in music==
The prime symbol is used in combination with lower case letters in the Helmholtz pitch notation system to distinguish notes in different octaves from middle C upwards. Thus represents the below middle C, represents middle C, represents the in the octave above middle C, and the in the octave two octaves above middle C. A combination of upper case letters and sub-prime symbols is used to represent notes in lower octaves. Thus represents the below the bass stave, while represents the in the octave below that.

In some musical scores, the double prime is used to indicate a length of time in seconds. It is used over a fermata denoting a long note or rest.

== Computer encodings ==
Unicode and HTML representations of the prime and related symbols are as follows.

* (lower case p)
* (upper case P)
* 
* 
* 

The &quot;modifier letter prime&quot; and &quot;modifier letter double prime&quot; characters are intended for linguistic purposes, such as the indication of stress or the transliteration of certain Cyrillic characters.

In a context when the character set used does not include the prime or double prime character (e.g., in an online discussion context where only ASCII or ISO 8859-1 [ISO Latin 1] is expected), they are often respectively approximated by ASCII apostrophe (U+0027) or quotation mark (U+0022).

LaTeX provides an oversized prime symbol, (formula_1), which, when used in super- or sub-scripts, renders appropriately; e.g., codice_1 appears as formula_2. An apostrophe, , is a shortcut for a superscript prime; e.g., appears as formula_3.

<text>Ashleigh Dennistoun Banfield (born December 29, 1967) is a Canadian-American journalist and host of &quot;Banfield&quot; on the NewsNation network. She is a former host of &quot;Legal View with Ashleigh Banfield&quot; and &quot;Early Start&quot; on CNN.

== Education ==

Banfield was educated at Balmoral Hall School, a private university preparatory school in Winnipeg, Manitoba, which she left in 1985 (also attended by her mother, Suzie [Holland] Lount, in the 1950s). She went on to obtain a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and French from Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario, in 1988 and continued her studies in French at the University of British Columbia, in Vancouver, British Columbia, graduating in 1992.

== Career ==

=== Canada ===

Banfield began her career in 1988 at CJBN-TV in Kenora, Ontario, and at CKY-TV in Winnipeg later that year. From 1989 to 1992, she anchored the weekend news for CFRN-TV in Edmonton. She worked at CICT-TV in Calgary, as a producer from 1992 to 1993 and as evening news anchor and business correspondent from 1993 to 1995. Banfield won two Iris Awards in 1994 in the categories of Best News Documentary and Best of Festival.

Banfield was a freelance associate producer for ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News Tonight&quot; during her tenure at CICT-TV. She covered the 1991 Bush/Gorbachev Summit in Russia and the April 1993 Clinton/Yeltsin Summit in Vancouver.

=== United States ===

In the mid-90s, she began working for KDFW, first hosting News 4 Texas Daybreak and later co-hosting News 4 Texas at 5:00 and News 4 Texas at 9:00 with Steve Eager.

In early 2000, Banfield was hired by national cable network MSNBC after having won an Emmy for her reporting at Dallas broadcast station KDFW-TV. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, she &quot;fit nicely with MSNBC&#x27;s positioning as the news network of choice for younger viewers&quot;. She also hosted &quot;MSNBC Investigates&quot;, worked at NBC News, and became a host of &quot;HomePage&quot; along with Gina Gaston and Mika Brzezinski.

On September 11, 2001, Banfield was reporting from the streets of Manhattan amid a cloud of debris from the collapsing World Trade Center. She was reporting a few blocks north of the site when 7 World Trade Center collapsed behind her. After the initial reporting of the attack had ended, Banfield received a promotion, as MSNBC sent her around the world as the producer of a new program, &quot;A Region in Conflict&quot;. Banfield lost two friends in the World Trade Center attacks and sought help for post-traumatic stress disorder.

During the conflict in Afghanistan, Banfield interviewed Taliban prisoners, and visited a hospital in Kabul. Later entries covered her travels from Jalalabad to Kabul, as well as other experiences in Afghanistan. In Pakistan, she interviewed Father Gregory Rice, a Roman Catholic priest in Pakistan, and an Iraqi woman aiding refugees. After &quot;A Region in Conflict&quot;, she received the 10 pm timeslot with the show &quot;Ashleigh Banfield on Location&quot;.

In April 2003, in a Landon Lecture Series speech at Kansas State University, Banfield raised concerns regarding media coverage of the conflict in Iraq. She spoke against &quot;cable news operators who wrap themselves in the American flag and go after a certain target demographic&quot; and specifically named Fox News Channel as an example. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that her speech angered MSNBC-controlling NBC management, who rebuked her and lowered her profile. &quot;They just fell in love with a new toy and they played with it and played with it and played with it until the paint came off&quot;, said an NBC News correspondent of the network&#x27;s relationship with Banfield.

Banfield joined CourtTV (renamed TruTV) in 2005. She was the co-host of the trial coverage show &quot;Banfield &amp; Ford: Courtside&quot; weekdays from 1 to 3PM ET with Jack Ford. On June 1, 2009, Banfield took over as host of the truTV series &quot;Open Court&quot; weekdays from 9 to 11 a.m. ET, formerly hosted by Lisa Bloom. Her last major assignment with the network was reporting on the Casey Anthony trial.

Banfield joined CNN in January 2012 as co-anchor with Zoraida Sambolin, of the network&#x27;s morning show, &quot;Early Start&quot;. On August 13, 2012, Banfield moved to the 11 a.m. edition of &quot;CNN Newsroom&quot; in New York each weekday, replacing Kyra Phillips as anchor. On August 6, 2013, it was announced that CNN would rebrand its 11 a.m. hour of &quot;CNN Newsroom.&quot; The show, called &quot;Legal View with Ashleigh Banfield&quot;, aired at 12 noon Eastern. In 2014, Banfield was featured in a small role portraying herself in the Netflix series House of Cards, where she interviewed Claire Underwood. In October, Banfield joined CNN sister station HLN as host on the legal issues interview program &quot;Primetime Justice with Ashleigh Banfield,&quot; which aired at 8 p.m. Monday to Thursday. As of December 2017, the show has been re-branded as &quot;Crime &amp; Justice with Ashleigh Banfield&quot;.

On October 16, 2018, it was announced by HLN that Banfield was to be laid off, along with Michaela Pereira and Carol Costello, as part of the network&#x27;s decision to scale back their live news programming. Final broadcasts of the shows hosted by all three presenters were aired on Friday, October 26, 2018. She then was the inaugural host of the A&amp;E show &quot;Live Rescue.&quot; After the first season, Matt Iseman took over as host.

She resumed hosting programs on CourtTV, including the true crime documentary series &quot;Judgment with Ashleigh Banfield&quot; in 2020. The program recaps past high-profile trials and provides updates on the individuals involved. She also appeared as a special contributor on their evening courtroom highlight show.

In January 2021, Banfield was announced as the host to replace the third hour of &quot;NewsNation Prime&quot; on NewsNation, with the self-titled show &quot;Banfield&quot;.&quot;

== Personal life ==

Banfield was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the daughter of Suzanne Elizabeth (Holland) and John Alexander Banfield. She was known for her &quot;trademark rectangular eyeglasses, the object of countless remarks, pro and con, after her arrival on the national media scene.&quot; In 2016, she had refractive lens exchange surgery which corrected her far-sightedness. Banfield is a cousin of television writer and director Michelle MacLaren.

In 2004, Banfield married real estate financier Howard Gould, who founded the carbon credit trading company Equator Environmental, and is a great-grandson of railroad developer Jay Gould. The wedding took place aboard a wooden yacht at the Royal Lake of the Woods Yacht Club in Canada.

Banfield became a naturalized U.S. citizen on October 24, 2008.

On December 29, 2017, Banfield&#x27;s 50th birthday, she married sales executive Chris Haynor, her partner of three years, at the Hermitage Club ski lodge in Wilmington, Vermont.

<text>Deepdale is a football stadium in the Deepdale area of Preston, England, the home of Preston North End. Deepdale is widely recognised as being the oldest continuously used football stadium in the world, though this is contested.

== History ==
The land on which the stadium stands was originally Deepdale Farm. It was leased on 21 January 1875 by the town&#x27;s North End sports club and originally used for cricket and rugby. It hosted its first association football match on 5 October 1878. On 21 June 1890, Preston North End Baseball Club played the first professional baseball game at Deepdale, with Derby Baseball Club winning 9–6.

===Old Deepdale===
As football grew in popularity, it became necessary to have raised areas, so the idea of football terracing was formed. In the 1890s Preston built the West Paddock, which ran along the touch line and a tent was erected to house the changing rooms. By the turn of the century, crowds were regularly over 10,000 and in 1921 they had to expand again. The Spion Kop was built and the West Paddock was extended to meet the Kop end. The pitch was removed to allow the building of the Town End, which was completed in 1928 but was destroyed by fire only five years later and had to be rebuilt. The Pavilion Stand, a relatively small stand of two tiers holding the changing rooms and offices, was built and opened in 1934. The record league attendance for Preston North End at Deepdale is 42,684 v Arsenal in the First Division, 23 April 1938. The women&#x27;s team Dick, Kerr&#x27;s Ladies also used to play at Deepdale, regularly attracting crowds of tens of thousands.

====1913 terrorist incident====

An attempt was made to destroy the ground in 1913. As part of the suffragette bombing and arson campaign, suffragettes carried out a series of bombings and arson attacks nationwide to publicise their campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage. In April 1913, suffragettes attempted to burn down Ewood Park&#x27;s grandstand but were foiled. In the same year, suffragettes succeeded in burning down Arsenal&#x27;s then South London stadium, and also attempted to burn down Blackburn Rovers&#x27; ground. More traditionally male sports were targeted in order to protest against male dominance.

===Plastic pitch===
In 1986, Preston North End decided to lay an all-weather pitch to try to generate some extra income for the club by renting the pitch to local teams to play on, to reduce the number of postponed matches as well as enabling the use of the Deepdale pitch as a training ground. It was one of four football stadiums in the English league to feature a plastic pitch, but this proved to be unpopular with the fans and was finally ripped up in 1994, by which time it was the last remaining plastic pitch in the English league.

===Renovation===

The original plans for the re-developed stadium were inspired by the Luigi Ferraris Stadium in Genoa, Italy. The regeneration of Deepdale began in 1995 when the old West Stand was demolished to make way for the new £4.4m Sir Tom Finney Stand which includes press areas and restaurants. The next stand to be developed was the Bill Shankly (1913–1981) Kop in 1998, followed by the Alan Kelly (1936–2009) Town End in 2001, which replaced the popular Town End terrace. In 2008, a 25-metre screen was also erected on the roof of the Bill Shankly Kop.

The old &#x27;Pavilion&#x27; stand, was replaced by the &#x27;Invincibles Pavilion&#x27; for the 2008–09 season, named after the Preston North End team of the 1888–89 season who were the first League champions, the first team to complete the League and FA Cup Double, and the only English team to complete a season unbeaten in both League and Cup. The Invincibles Pavilion includes a row of executive boxes and a restaurant which overlooks the pitch as well as the Stadium Control Room, PA Box and Big Screen Control Room and an NHS walk-in centre has also been built into the stand.

Deepdale is now an all-seater stadium with a total capacity of 23,404, as follows:

* Sir Tom Finney Stand: 7,893
* Bill Shankly Kop: 5,933
* Alan Kelly Town End: 5,859
* Invincibles Pavilion: 3,719

==Sir Tom Finney statue==
Outside the Sir Tom Finney Stand, is a statue of the famous player himself, sculpted by Preston-born sculptor Peter Hodgkinson.
The statue, commissioned for Finney&#x27;s 80th birthday and unveiled in July 2004, was inspired by a photo taken at the Chelsea versus PNE game played at Stamford Bridge, in 1956.

==International use==
Deepdale was used during the 2005 UEFA Women&#x27;s Championship for three group games and a semi-final, for an England Under-21s game against Iceland in March 2011, and two England Under-19s Elite Qualifying Round matches against Slovenia and Switzerland in the 2011–12 season.

== National Football Museum ==
Between 2001 and 2010 the National Football Museum was located in the Bill Shankly Kop stand at Deepdale. The project, started in 1995, was part funded by a National Lottery Heritage grant. Including items such as the match ball from the 1966 World Cup Final and a cap from the world&#x27;s first ever football international, the museum attracted around 100,000 visitors a year. A proposal to move to Wembley Stadium in 2008 was resisted, but the removal of external funding lead to the museum&#x27;s relocation to Urbis in Manchester in 2010.

<text>DeskJet is a brand name for inkjet printers manufactured by Hewlett-Packard. These printers range from small domestic to large industrial models, although the largest models in the range have generally been dubbed DesignJet. The Macintosh-compatible equivalent was branded as the Deskwriter and competed with Apple&#x27;s StyleWriter, and the all-in-one equivalent is called OfficeJet.

== History ==
HP began making inkjet printers with the HP ThinkJet (an abbreviation of &quot;Thermal Ink Jet&quot;) in 1984. It represented the commercial birth of inkjet printing technology. The resolution was about 192 × 96 dpi, printing 150 characters per second (cps).The printer&#x27;s key benefit was its quiet operation. The HP Integral PC incorporated an ThinkJet. The ThinkJet was the smallest printer produced by HP until 1992 and the first HP printer to carry the &quot;Jet&quot; name, adopted by other printers such as QuietJet, DeskJet, LaserJet or OfficeJet. There were five models of the ThinkJet:

In 1986, the ThinkJet was followed by the QuietJet (HP 2227A), which were little faster than the ThinkJet and offered slightly better print quality and by the wide-carriage version QuietJet Plus (HP 2228A).

In 1988, HP introduced the first DeskJet. It included a built-in cut sheet feeder, 2 pages per minute (ppm), and 300 dpi. This was followed by the DeskJet Plus in 1989. It offered a landscape printing ability. The DeskJet 500 was introduced in 1990, offering a faster printing speed of 3 ppm. Meanwhile, HP introduced the DeskWriter for the Macintosh in 1989, based on the DeskJet 500.

By 1987, the world&#x27;s first full-color inkjet printer, the PaintJet, was introduced. It was so successful that HP introduced a version of the DeskJet capable of color printing, the DeskJet 500C, in October 1991, which is also HP&#x27;s first 300 dpi color printer, offering 4 minutes per page in color, using a swappable either black or CMY print head ink cartridge. It was replaced by the DeskJet 550C in October 1992, HP&#x27;s first dual-cartridge color DeskJet, offering a real black instead of mixed black ink in color prints, using both the 500C&#x27;s cartridges at once. The DeskJet 560C followed in March 1994, which introduced HP ColorSmart to intelligently analyze documents for the best color output.

Meanwhile, HP introduced the DeskJet Portable (3 ppm) in 1992. It was designed to be easily portable. It was targeted at mobile professionals. It was replaced by the HP DeskJet 310 (4 ppm B&amp;W, 4 minutes per page color) in 1993, the HP DeskJet 320 in 1994, the HP DeskJet 340 (2 minutes per page color) in 1995, and the HP DeskJet 350 and 350CBi (5 ppm B&amp;W, 2 ppm color) in 2000.

HP continued to make black-and-white-only inkjet printers with the HP DeskJet 510 (1992) and 520 (1994). The HP DeskJet 520 introduced resolution enhancement technology, or REt, to HP inkjet printers. It was also HP&#x27;s last black-and-white-only inkjet printer. The HP DeskJet 500, 510, 520, 500C, 550C, and 560C were all replaced by the HP DeskJet 540 (3 ppm B&amp;W, 1.5 minutes per page color). A one-pen inkjet printer, color was optional. Also it introduced a different industrial design.

HP&#x27;s high-end printer line started with the HP DeskJet 1200C, introduced in 1993, offering 6 ppm B&amp;W, and 1 ppm color. This was replaced by the HP DeskJet 1600C (1995), offering 9 ppm B&amp;W, and 4 ppm color, which offered a successor, the HP DeskJet 1600CN (1996), the 1600C with built-in networking.

In May 1995, HP unveiled the HP DeskJet and Deskwriter 660C which contained both black and tricolor inket cartridges that provided 600 by 600 dpi B&amp;W at 4 ppm and 600 by 300 dpi color printing, up to 1.5 ppm. The HP DeskJet 850C and 855C were released in September of that year and featured HP&#x27;s Color Resolution Enhancement technology (C-Ret) capable of the same resolutions of the 660C but with print speeds of 6 ppm B&amp;W and up to 2 ppm color. 

HP replaced the PaintJet XL300 and the DeskJet 1600C/1600CN with the HP DeskJet 1000C/1100C/1120C in 1998, HP&#x27;s first A3 inkjet printers under the DeskJet brand. These printers were replaced by the HP DeskJet 1220C in 2000, offering 12 ppm in B&amp;W, and 10 ppm in color.

HP-branded &quot;Vivera&quot; ink was introduced with the HP DeskJet 6540 starting in 2004, which also offered improved printing speeds of up to 30 ppm in B&amp;W, and 20 ppm in color.

All-in-one inkjet printers from HP under the DeskJet brand have also been produced, starting with the HP DeskJet F380 printer/scanner/copier, introduced in 2006, using HP Vivera ink, which offered print speeds of up to 20 ppm in black-and-white, and 14 ppm in color.

HP continues to sell various printers under the DeskJet moniker. The current line of HP DeskJets include the HP DeskJet 1000/2000/3000/4000. HP DeskJet 1000s usually are print only, whereas the DeskJet 2000/3000/4000 typically offers scanners built in. The 4000 series typically have both ADF (Automatic Document Feeder) scanning and flatbed scanning. Also in HP&#x27;s offerings of family/home office printers include the ENVY, OfficeJet(Pro), Smart Tank and some LaserJets.

 HP sells new ink cartridges for the original ThinkJet 2225 series. Production is likely to continue indefinitely, as they are also compatible with newer industrial printers.

<text>The National Football Museum is England&#x27;s national museum of football. It is based in the Urbis building in Manchester city centre, and preserves, conserves and displays important collections of football memorabilia.

The museum was originally based in Deepdale, Preston, Lancashire, but moved to Manchester in 2012.

==History==
=== Origins ===

The idea for what became the National Football Museum goes back to 1994 when Baxi Partnership, a local company, acquired Preston North End Football Club (PNE) and began the redevelopment of Deepdale Stadium. A chance conversation between Bryan Gray, Chairman of PNE, and the Football League, led to a meeting with Harry Langton, the man who over thirty years put together what is now called the FIFA Museum Collection. FIFA recognised the importance of the collection and acquired it from Harry Langton with a view to finding a permanent home. FIFA saw the proposed museum at Preston as an ideal permanent location for the FIFA Museum Collection.

Bryan Gray formed a small team of people to work on the project including Keith Cooper of FIFA, David Fleming, Director of Tyne and Wear Museums, Brian Booth, formerly Vice Chancellor of the University of Central Lancashire, and Chris Newbery, director of the Royal Marines Museum in Portsmouth. The Football Association was represented by David Davies. The National Football Museum was incorporated as a private limited company in June 1995 and became a registered charity in November 1995.

===Preston===
After much hard work, an application to the Heritage Lottery Fund was successful and a grant of £7.5m was awarded in November 1997. The Museum would be located in the Bill Shankly Kop of Deepdale. The total project cost was estimated at £12m. A ground-breaking ceremony took place on 26 September 1998 by Sepp Blatter of FIFA with the Rt Hon Chris Smith MP, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, in attendance. The foundation stone was laid by Bryan Gray and Ben Casey (who had persuaded Baxi to buy PNE) in April 2000. Finally the National Football Museum was officially opened on 21 June 2001 by the Duke of Kent. Bryan Gray, the founding chairman of trustees, stood down in September 2001 to be succeeded by Brian Booth.

Rob Pratten was the first employee of the Football Museum: he joined the team in May 1995 and for some time was the only employee. Kevin Moore was appointed Director in August 1997 and was later joined by Mark Bushell, Hugh Hornby and Lindsey Jones. The museum&#x27;s first site was outside Deepdale, Preston, Lancashire. Deepdale was particularly significant as it is the oldest continuously used professional football ground in the world.

In 2003 the museum and the University of Central Lancashire established the International Football Institute to conduct research into historical, social and cultural aspects of football.

On a visit in 2004, Sepp Blatter, President of FIFA, commented &quot;&quot;The National Football Museum merits my admiration as a footballer and as the President of FIFA — it is a superb realisation, a real jewel!&quot;. Sir Bobby Charlton commented that he &quot;“can’t think of a better museum anywhere in the world.”&quot; and Sir Alex Ferguson &quot;Each time I visit the Museum I am so impressed by the great job it does in bringing the rich history of football to life&quot;&quot;. The museum received the award of Large Visitor Attraction of the Year, at the 2005 Lancashire and Blackpool Tourism Awards

In December 2008, chairman of the Football League, Brian Mawhinney caused controversy when he suggested that the Museum should be moved from Preston to Wembley Stadium in order to attract more visitors.
Founder Kevin Moore, stated that it had been an aim to have an exhibition at Wembley, but stated that the trustee&#x27;s policy was to have its headquarters in Preston.

===Manchester===
Despite critical acclaim and attracting 100,000 visitors per year, funding was repeatedly an issue. In 2007, it had an income of £791,256 against out-goings of £1,231,195. The trustees were concerned about the museum&#x27;s long-term future. In 2009, they approached Manchester City Council about moving the museum. The city council offered a funding package worth £2m per year for the museum to move to Manchester. Despite an improved offer of £400,000 per year from Preston and Lancashire councils, the trustees voted to move the museum to the Urbis exhibition centre in Manchester.

It was intended that subject to satisfactory funding, the Preston site would remain open as a secondary centre. However, the museum failed to agree a funding package with Lancashire County Council and the Preston site closed to the public at the end of April 2010. In 2023, the Preston site opened as a fan zone called &#x27;The Gentry Bar.

Urbis closed in February 2010 in preparation for an intended opening of the new National Football Museum in summer 2011.

The museum reopened in Manchester on 6 July 2012. The new museum aimed to attract 350,000 visitors per year. It was reported in August 2012 that the new National Football Museum attracted over 100,000 visitors in the first six weeks of opening. By the end of April 2013, the museum reached its 350,000 target, and was attracting 500,000 visitors by 2017. From January 2019, the museum adopted a charging model, while remaining free to city of Manchester residents.

Parry appeared on Gilmour&#x27;s live dates in 2001 and 2002, one performance of which was released as &quot;David Gilmour in Concert&quot;. He also played on the 2006 &quot;On An Island&quot; tour in Europe, the United States and Canada, performing saxophone on &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;, &quot;Wearing the Inside Out&quot;, and &quot;Then I Close My Eyes&quot;. Shows from the Royal Albert Hall in London, and from the Shipyard in Gdańsk, Poland were released as the DVDs &quot;Remember That Night&quot; and &quot;Live in Gdańsk&quot;, respectively.

<text>Jokers Wild were a British rock band formed in Cambridge, England, in 1964. The group were active until 1967, and are best known for launching the career of guitarist David Gilmour, who went on to join Pink Floyd. 

==Career==
Jokers Wild formed in late 1963 in Cambridge, and first performed in February 1964. The original musicians were Dave Altham (piano, saxophone and vocals), a student at Trinity College, Tony Sainty (bass guitar and vocals), previously with The Redcaps and before that a St John&#x27;s College choirboy, Johnny Gordon (rhythm guitar and vocals) and Clive Welham (drums and vocals), both from the Ramblers, and David Gilmour (lead guitar and vocals), previously with the Newcomers. Two part-timers joined them for some gigs: Jeff Whittaker (congas and vocals) was a regular at Les Jeux Interdits (below), and Marilyn Minns (vocals) sang Françoise Hardy and Marianne Faithfull songs at parties.

Jokers Wild was conceived as an all-singing band, a move towards the Beatles/Hollies type of group and away from the instrumental plus singer line-up then common. ‘We were brave enough to do harmony singing that other groups wouldn’t attempt, including Beach Boys and Four Seasons numbers’, said Tony Sainty.

The band played at youth clubs, village halls, private parties and major venues in Cambridge (a 1964 business card designed by Johnny Gordon describes the band as &quot;A versatile beat group for dances, parties, socials, etc.&quot;), including the Dorothy, the Guildhall and the Victoria, where they had a regular residence at , a club popular with foreign language students. Occasionally, larger gigs were played, including Peterhouse May Ball, and at Westminster Art College in London, where a coach-load of fans from Cambridge watched the band supporting The Animals.

In October 1965 they played at Rose and Libby January&#x27;s 21st birthday party, playing with singer/songwriter Paul Simon (then touring the UK), who joined them to sing &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;, and Pink Floyd, the band with whom Gilmour was later to find fame. Another guest was Libby&#x27;s partner Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis, who later designed Pink Floyd&#x27;s album covers. One of them, Ummagumma, featured the Januarys&#x27; kitchen and garden in a sequence of ‘pictures in a picture’.

Soon after, on 2 November 1965, they travelled to London&#x27;s famous ‘Tin Pan Alley’ where at Regent Sound Studio in Denmark Street they recorded five tracks for fans.

At the end of 1965 Sainty left and was replaced by Peter Gilmour, David&#x27;s brother, on bass and vocals. At the same time the band&#x27;s musical direction was changing towards more Soul, R &amp; B and Tamla Motown numbers as they got work at US Air Force bases.

Thinking of going fully professional, the band contacted several promoters early in 1966 including Brian Somerville (the Beatles’ publicity manager) and Lionel Bart. Jonathan King, Altham&#x27;s fellow student at Trinity College was also approached and in April 1966 he produced the band&#x27;s next single, Sam and Dave’s “You Don’t Know Like I Know” and Otis Redding’s “That&#x27;s How Strong My Love Is”. It was due to be released by Decca Records, but this didn&#x27;t go ahead when Sam and Dave&#x27;s original was released.

Clive Welham, who was having difficulty drumming because of a wrist injury, left in April 1966 and was replaced on drums by Willie Wilson (who had previously played in the HiFi&#x27;s and the Newcomers).

In the summer of 1966 Jokers Wild got a residency at the , Marbella, Spain. Peter Gilmour left to go to university, and Johnny Gordon decided to complete his art degree at Cambridge School of Art. Peter Gilmour was replaced on bass by Rick Wills, previously with the Soul Committee.

So the line-up that went to Spain was Altham, Gilmour, Wilson and Wills. They returned to Cambridge briefly in the autumn of 1966. Altham left, and they travelled to France as a trio, first to play for a couple of months in St Etienne, and then in early 1967 to Paris. Now called The Flowers, they played in France, travelling as far as St Tropez. The band finally returned to the UK around June 1967 when David Gilmour fell ill, and broke up later that year.

David Gilmour joined Pink Floyd early in 1968, after working as a deliveryman for Quorum, a fashion house. Willie Wilson went on to play in a number of successful bands including Cochise and Quiver. Rick Wills also played in successful bands including Frampton&#x27;s Camel, Cochise (with Willie), Foreigner and Bad Company. Johnny Gordon and Peter Gilmour made careers respectively as graphic artist (and later magician) and accountant. Wills and Wilson supported David Gilmour on his 1978 solo debut album. Clive Welham worked at the Cambridge University Press until his retirement and maintained an involvement in the Cambridgeshire music scene as lead singer in various bands including Solitaire and Executive Suite.

Wilson later played drums and bass on Syd Barrett&#x27;s solo albums, &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; and &quot;Barrett&quot;, the later sessions of which were produced by Gilmour. He also was a surrogate drummer on the live shows for &quot;The Wall&quot; and the live album &quot;Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980–81&quot;, which came out in 2000. Between 1973 and 1978 he was a member of Quiver.

==Recordings==
Jokers Wild did two recording sessions, both at Regent Sound studio in Denmark Street, London.

The first, on 2 November 1965, was a self-funded and self-produced session, and resulted in a privately pressed, single-sided studio album (carrying catalogue number RSLP 007) and single (RSR 0031). 50 copies of each were made and distributed to fans. A tape recording of the LP is held by the British Library&#x27;s British Library Sound Archive.

The album&#x27;s five tracks (showing previous artists) featuring David Gilmour and Dave Altham on vocals, were:

# &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; (Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers; Beach Boys)
# &quot;Walk Like a Man&quot; (Four Seasons)
# &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me What I Say&quot; (Manfred Mann)
# &quot;Big Girls Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; (Four Seasons)
# &quot;Beautiful Delilah&quot; (Chuck Berry; the Kinks)

The single had &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me What I Say&quot;, backed by &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;.

The second session, in April 1966, was produced by Jonathan King, and funded by Decca Records. It featured David Gilmour singing Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Like I Know&quot;, backed by Otis Redding&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s How Strong My Love Is&quot;. This was to be released in the UK but when Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s original was released it was decided not to release the Jokers Wild version.

<text>Mespilus germanica, known as the medlar or common medlar, is a large shrub or small tree in the rose family Rosaceae. When the genus &quot;Mespilus&quot; is included in the genus &quot;Crataegus&quot;, the correct name for this species is Crataegus germanica (L.) Kuntze. 

The fruit of this tree, also called medlar, has been cultivated since Roman times. It is usually available in winter and eaten when bletted. It may be consumed raw and in a range of cooked dishes.

==Description==
Under ideal circumstances, the deciduous plant grows up to tall. Generally, it is shorter and more shrub-like than tree-like. With a lifespan of 30–60 years, the tree is rather short-lived. Its bark is grayish brown with deep vertical cracks forming rectangular plates that tend to lift off.

The wild form of &quot;M. germanica&quot; is mostly a thorny, more shrub-like than tree-like plant, which is between high. In the cultivated forms, the thorns are usually reduced or even completely absent. In general, the medlar is a small, deciduous tree with an overhanging, almost round crown. The trunk is irregularly shaped. The tree has a height between , but can become significantly larger in culture. The diameter at breast height is usually between , but in exceptional cases it can be up to . The roots are heavily branched and far-ranging, with a somewhat fibrous root system.

The wood has a fine texture, but is very hard. It has a white, slightly pink-tinted sapwood. The core is brownish. The annual rings are clearly visible.

The winter buds are pointed, ovoid and up to long. The leaves are dark green and elliptic, long and wide. The leaves are densely hairy (pubescent) below, and turn red in autumn before falling.

Medlar flowers are in diameter, have a short stalk and are terminal and single on short side shoots. They have five elongated, narrow sepals and five free, white or pale pink petals. Compared to other fruit trees in the European latitudes, the medlar flowers very late (May or June). The flowers are hermaphrodite and pollinated by bees. Normally, self-pollination occurs in this plant. The flower then develops flattened, reddish-brown, hairy fruits with juicy flesh. The reddish-brown fruit is a pome, diameter, with wide-spreading persistent sepals around a central pit, giving a &#x27;hollow&#x27; appearance to the fruit. In cultivated forms the diameter is even between .

Sexual reproduction is the norm in wild forms of the medlar. The resulting seeds have a germination capacity lasting from 18 to 20 months. The seeds are distributed by various animals such as birds, squirrels and deer. Some varieties are sterile and can therefore only be propagated vegetatively.

The number of chromosomes is given as 2n = 32 or 2n = 34.

== Taxonomy ==
Until recently, &quot;M. germanica&quot; was the only known species of medlar. However, in 1990, a new species was discovered in North America, now named &quot;M. canescens&quot;. The loquat, &quot;Eriobotrya japonica&quot;, is more distantly related to the medlar than genera such as &quot;Crataegus&quot;, &quot;Amelanchier&quot;, &quot;Peraphyllum&quot;, and &quot;Malacomeles&quot;, but was once thought to be closely related, and is still sometimes called the &#x27;Chinese medlar&#x27; or &#x27;Japanese medlar&#x27;.

=== Systematics ===
Within the species &quot;M. germanica&quot; 23 taxa are distinguished, also compromising wild or semi-wild forms, ornamental and of different origin. Among them there are the following varieties:
* &quot;Mespilus germanica&quot; var. &quot;gigantea&quot; Kirchn. with very large fruits
* &quot;Mespilus germanica&quot; var. &quot;abortiva&quot; Kirchn. with fruits without seeds
* &quot;Mespilus germanica&quot; var. &quot;argenteo-variegata&quot; with white variegated leaves as ornamental plant
* &quot;Mespilus germanica&quot; var. &quot;aureo-variegata&quot; with yellow variegated leaves as ornamental plant

Cultivars of &quot;M. germanica&quot; that are grown for their fruit include &#x27;Hollandia&#x27;, &#x27;Nottingham&#x27;, and &#x27;Russian&#x27;, the large-fruited variety &#x27;Dutch&#x27; (also known as &#x27;Giant&#x27; or &#x27;Monstrous&#x27;), &#x27;Breda giant&#x27;, &#x27;Large Russian&#x27;, &#x27;Royal&#x27; with very high yield, &#x27;Early medlar&#x27; with early ripening and high quality fruits, &#x27;Seedless&#x27; with seedless fruits of low quality.

The cultivar &#x27;Nottingham&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

For a time it was assumed that it was a species with narrow genetic resources and therefore subject to high risks of genetic erosion, whereby the limited evolution of &quot;M. germanica&quot; diversity was ascribed to the lack of economic interest for this fruit species in the last centuries. However, current findings show that natural populations of medlar are diverse with a high genetic potential, which could be used to improve production by using specific genotypes.

=== Etymology ===
The Latin name means &#x27;German&#x27;, although the species is indigenous to other areas.

== Distribution and habitat ==
From an extensive study of literature and plant specimens, concluded that the true homeland of &quot;M. germanica&quot; is only in the southeastern part of the Balkan peninsula, in Asia Minor (Armenian highlands), on the Caucasus, Crimea, northern Iran, and possibly also in Turkmenia. It is also found in southeastern Europe, especially the Black Sea coasts of Bulgaria and Turkey.

The species requires temperate and sub-mediterranean climate conditions with warm summers and mild winters. Air temperatures of are mentioned as favourable for growth, cold of as low as is tolerated and late frosts hardly cause any damage. The wild form was observed in dry areas with annual precipitation of and at altitudes from . The species grows in a wide range of soil types and prefers fresh, well-drained loamy soils with a pH that is between 6 and 8. It is found across southern Europe where it is generally rare. It is reported to be naturalized in some woods in southeast England, but is found in few gardens.

== Ecology ==

=== Plant disease ===
&quot;M. germanica&quot; is only rarely attacked by diseases or harmed by insects.

In plantations, the larvae of the leaf-mining butterfly species &quot;Lithocolletis blancardella&quot; can cause damage. Furthermore, especially in years with high precipitation, the fungus &quot;Monilinia fructigena&quot; can be a problem. It causes brown blemishes on the fruit and continues to spread until the fruit becomes entirely rotten.

&quot;M. germanica&quot; can also be infected by &quot;Podosphaera clandestina&quot;, the pathogen of powdery mildew, which can lead to the wilting of leaves and buds as well as by &quot;Entomosporium mespili&quot; that causes leaf spots.

The medlar is, like other species of the rosacea family which are used for propagation, susceptible to &quot;Erwinia amylovora&quot;, the parasitic causative agent of fire blight.

== Cultivation ==
The species may have been cultivated for as long as 3,000 years. The ancient Greek geographer Strabo refers to a () in &quot;Geographica&quot;, Book 16, Chapter 4. The medlar was introduced to Greece around 700 BC and to Rome about 200 BC. It was an important fruit plant during Roman and medieval times. By the 17th and 18th centuries, however, it had been superseded by other fruits, and is little cultivated today.

&quot;M. germanica&quot; pomes are one of the few fruits that become edible in winter, making it an important tree for gardeners who wish to have fruit available all year round.

Cultivated forms are propagated by inoculation and by grafting on various substrates such as &quot;Crataegus&quot; (hawthorn) species, mountain ash, pear or quince to improve the performance in different soils. Cultivars reach full fruit set 6 to 7 years after grafting and they keep it for 20 to 25 years. The fruit production varies between per tree and year, depending on the variety and age.

Grafting on medlar seedlings is not recommended because of the slow growth of the grafts. Irrigation and fertilization can stimulate growth in plantations. If the fruit-bearing shoots are cut back after the harvest, the formation of new fertile short shoots is encouraged.

== Uses ==
 The fruits are hard and acidic even when ripe, but become edible after being softened, &quot;bletted&quot;, by frost, or naturally in storage if given sufficient time by reducing tannin content and fruit acids, increasing sugar content, and changes in the content of minerals.

Once softening begins, the skin rapidly takes on a wrinkled texture and turns dark brown, and the inside reduces to the consistency and flavour reminiscent of apple sauce. This process can confuse those new to medlars, as its softened fruit looks as if it has spoiled.

In Gilan, northern Iran, the leaves, bark, fruits and wood of the medlar tree are traditionally used in herbal medicine.

=== Product use ===
Once bletted, the fruit can be eaten raw, sometimes with sugar and cream—it has been described as being an &quot;acquired taste&quot;—or used to make medlar jelly. It is used in &quot;medlar cheese&quot;, which is similar to lemon curd, made with the fruit pulp, eggs, and butter.

Unripe fruits have a relatively high tannin content of about 2.6% and are therefore used for tanning. The tannin causes flocculation of proteins, enabling its use to reduce the turbidity of wine. In Saarland, Germany, a schnapps is made from the fruit of the medlar, which is refined with hawthorn. &quot;Medlar tea&quot; usually is not made from &quot;M. germanica&quot;, but from wolfberry, or goji, which is sometimes inaccurately translated as &quot;red medlar.&quot;

&quot;Mespilus germanica&quot; kernel oil was used for the first time to produce biodiesel, whereby linoleic acid and oleic acid with about 40% are main constituents of the extracted oil. The physical properties of the produced biodiesel allows an alternative for diesel fuels without any modification to the conventional engines. Leaves of medlar fruit were used to produce activated carbon to remove heavy metals like Ni2+ from aqueous solutions.

Silver nanoparticles could be synthesized from &quot;M. germanica&quot; extract and show antibacterial, antibiofilm activities against multidrug resistance of &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; clinical strains.

=== Nutrients and phytochemicals ===
In general, the medlar fruits were found to be rich in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and iron.

&quot;M. germanica&quot; contains various phytochemicals varying between genotypes, fruit ripeness, harvest time and storage conditions. The fruits are particularly rich in monoterpenes and organic acids. Amino acids, sugars, and organic acids affect flavor.

Due to their diuretic and astringent effects, the fruits have been used in traditional medicine.

In 1984 and 1985, the following values were given for homogenized fruit:
Fructose content increases steadily during fruit development, whereas sucrose content increases for 4 months and decreases afterwards. Tannin content and fruit acid content, especially ascorbid acid, decreases during fruit development. In ripe fruit, glutamate and aspartate were the major amino compounds, but also total amino acid composition changed during fruit development.

==In culture==

===Chaucer===
A fruit which is rotten before it is ripe, the medlar is used figuratively in literature as a symbol of prostitution or premature destitution. For example, in the Prologue to &quot;The Reeve&#x27;s Tale&quot;, Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s character laments his old age, comparing himself to the medlar, which he names using the Middle English term for the fruit, &quot;open-arse&quot;:
===Shakespeare===
In William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;, Apemantus forces an apple upon Timon: &quot;The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the extremity of both ends. When thou wast in thy gilt and perfume, they mock&#x27;d thee for too much curiosity; in thy rags thou know&#x27;st none, but art despised for the contrary. There&#x27;s a medlar for thee; eat it&quot;, perhaps including a pun on &quot;meddler&quot;, one who meddles in affairs, as well as on rottenness. (IV.iii.300–305).

In &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, Lucio excuses his denial of past fornication because &quot;they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.&quot; (IV.iii.171).

In &quot;As You Like It&quot;, Rosalind makes a complicated pun involving grafting her interlocutor with the trees around her which bear love letters and with a medlar: &quot;I&#x27;ll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it with a medlar. Then it will be the earliest fruit i&#x27; th&#x27; country; for you&#x27;ll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that&#x27;s the right virtue of the medlar.&quot; (III.ii.116–119).

The most famous reference to medlars, often bowdlerized until modern editions accepted it, appears in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, when Mercutio laughs at Romeo&#x27;s unrequited love for his mistress Rosaline (II, 1, 34–38):

In the 16th and 17th centuries, medlars were bawdily called &quot;open-arses&quot; because of the shape of the fruits, inspiring boisterous or humorously indecent puns in many Elizabethan and Jacobean plays. The name survived in common use well into the 20th century. In the southwest of England it historically had a number of vulgar nicknames, such as open-arse and monkey&#x27;s bottom, due to the appearance of its large calyx (sepals).

===Other 16th- and 17th-century authors===
In Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; Don Quixote the eponymous hero and Sancho Panza &quot;stretch themselves out in the middle of a field and stuff themselves with acorns or medlars.&quot;

In François Rabelais&#x27; Gargantua and Pantagruel, medlars play a role in the origin of giants, including the eponymous characters. After Cain killed Abel, the blood of the just saturated the Earth, causing enormous medlars to grow. Humans who ate these medlars grew to great proportions. Those whose bodies grew longer became giants, and were the ancestors of Gargantua and Pantagruel.

Thomas Dekker also draws a comparison in his play &quot;The Honest Whore&quot;: &quot;I scarce know her, for the beauty of her cheek hath, like the moon, suffered strange eclipses since I beheld it: women are like medlars, no sooner ripe but rotten.&quot;

Another reference can be found in Thomas Middleton&#x27;s &quot;A Trick to Catch the Old One&quot; in the character of Widow Medler, impersonated by a courtesan, hence the following pun: &quot;Who? Widow Medler? She lies open to much rumour.&quot;

In the Memoirs of Glückel of Hameln, Glückel recalls having had a craving for medlars when she was pregnant with her son Joseph, but ignoring the desire. When the baby was born, he was sickly and too weak to be breastfed. Remembering a superstition about the dangers of pregnant women not fulfilling their cravings, Glückel asked for someone to fetch her some medlars for the baby. As soon as the fruit touched the baby&#x27;s lips, he ate all the pulp given to him, and was then able to be breastfed.

===Modern literature===
In modern literature, some writers have mentioned this fruit.

Saki uses medlars in his short stories, which often play on the decay of Edwardian society. In &quot;The Peace of Mowsle Barton&quot;, the outwardly quiet farmstead features a medlar tree and corrosive hatred. In &quot;The Boar Pig&quot;, the titular animal, Tarquin Superbus, is the point of contact between society ladies cheating to get into &quot;the&quot; garden party of the season and a not entirely honest young schoolgirl who lures him away by strategically throwing well-bletted medlars: &quot;Come, Tarquin, dear old boy; you know you can&#x27;t resist medlars when they&#x27;re rotten and squashy.&quot;

Italian novelist Giovanni Verga&#x27;s naturalist narrative &quot;I Malavoglia&quot; is titled &quot;The House by the Medlar Tree&quot; in the English translation.

H. C. Bailey&#x27;s detective Reggie Fortune is very fond of medlars.

Philip Pullman describes Sir Charles Latrom&#x27;s perfume as &quot;rotted like a medlar&quot; in his book &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot;.

<text>The South Luzon Expressway (SLEX), signed as E2 of the Philippine expressway network and R-3 of the Metro Manila arterial road network, is a controlled-access highway that connects Metro Manila to the provinces in the Calabarzon, Mimaropa and Bicol Region on the island of Luzon in the Philippines. The expressway has a length of , traveling from its northern terminus at the Magallanes Interchange in Makati to its southern terminus at Santo Tomas, Batangas, connecting it to the Southern Tagalog Arterial Road (STAR Tollway). A portion of the expressway from the Magallanes Interchange to the Calamba Exit is part of Asian Highway 26 of the Asian highway network. It will be the longest expressway in the Philippines starting with the completion of Toll Road 4 surpassing the Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX) as well as providing a gateway to Visayas upon the completion of Toll Road 5.

The expressway also serves as a major utility corridor, carrying various high voltage overhead power lines and an oil pipeline. Notable power lines using the expressway&#x27;s right of way for most or part of their route are the Sucat–Paco–Araneta–Balintawak transmission line, and the Biñan–Calamba and Calamba–Bay lines. The Magallanes–Alabang section of the expressway was also used to carry the Batangas–Pandacan oil pipeline.

The expressway was built in 1969 to develop areas adjacent to Metro Manila, particularly the south. The original route spanning from Magallanes, Makati, to Alabang, Muntinlupa, was extended to Laguna in 1978. In 1995, the Magallanes–Alabang section became part of the Skyway System&#x27;s at-grade section. Rehabilitation efforts on the expressway followed, lasting from 2006 to 2009. Operations were transferred from Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC) to the South Luzon Tollways Corporation (SLTC) and Manila Toll Expressway Systems (MATES) on May 2, 2010. Additionally, it is connected to the Southern Tagalog Arterial Road in Batangas, through the Toll Road 3 project (Calamba–Santo Tomas) that was constructed from 2007 to 2010, inaugurated on June 15, 2010, and opened to the traffic six months after its inauguration on December 15, 2010.

==Route description==


The South Luzon Expressway cuts southwards from Metro Manila up to the provinces in Calabarzon. The expressway consists of two sections: the Skyway At-Grade segment, which runs underneath the Skyway from Magallanes Interchange in Makati to Alabang Exit in Muntinlupa, and the South Luzon Tollway (SLT) segment, also called the Alabang–Calamba–Santo Tomas Expressway (ACTEX), from Alabang to Santo Tomas, Batangas. Skyway At-Grade operations are held jointly by the Skyway Operations and Maintenance Corporation (SOMCO) and SMC Skyway Corporation (formerly Citra Metro Manila Tollways Corporation), while the South Luzon Tollway segment of SLEX is held by SMC SLEX, Inc. (formerly South Luzon Tollway Corporation), a concessionaire operated by Manila Toll Expressway Systems, Inc. (MATES) and a joint venture of the Philippine National Construction Corporation and the San Miguel Corporation-backed PT Citra Marga Nusaphala Persada Tbk group of Indonesia. SLT/ACTEX is further divided into three phases:
* SLEX Toll Road 1 (TR1): Alabang Viaduct in Muntinlupa
* SLEX Toll Road 2 (TR2): Filinvest Exit to Calamba Exit
* SLEX Toll Road 3 (TR3): Calamba Exit to Santo Tomas Exit
The South Luzon Expressway starts as the physical extension of Osmeña Highway past the Magallanes Interchange, where it also meets Circumferential Road 4, particularly EDSA. The expressway runs through , spanning the cities of Makati, Pasay, Taguig, Parañaque, and Muntinlupa in Metro Manila and the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, and Batangas. From its northern terminus at Magallanes Interchange, the expressway follows a straight path southeast in parallel to the PNR South Main Line until the Bicutan Exit, where it slightly bends to the south towards the Alabang Exit. Two service roads run on either side of the expressway from Sales Interchange to Alabang Exit, namely: West Service Road and East Service Road. Bicycle lanes are also present on the outermost lane of the toll-free northern section of the expressway, between the Magallanes and Sales Interchanges.

At the Alabang Exit, SLEX ascends to the Alabang Viaduct, a , eight-lane viaduct over the Manila South Road through Alabang, Muntinlupa. After its descent at Filinvest Exit, SLEX mostly parallels the Manila South Road in Muntinlupa and northwestern Laguna, passing through the Susana Heights Exit connecting it to the Muntinlupa–Cavite Expressway. It continues as a straight roadway lined with billboards and passing through residential and industrial areas. Past the San Pedro Exit, the expressway then curves and ascends past the Petron and Caltex service areas. Past Santa Rosa Exit, SLEX narrows with guard rails as the median divider. At the Calamba Exit, the Pan-Philippine Highway concurrency ends as it leaves the expressway towards the west as Maharlika Highway. Past such exit, the expressway further narrows without exits and with bridges built with wide shoulders to accommodate future widening. It follows a curved route paralleling the Pan-Philippine Highway (Maharlika Highway) from Calamba to Santo Tomas, Batangas. It then meets its future interchange with SLEX Toll Road 4 (TR4), which will extend it up to Lucena and eventually to Matnog, Sorsogon, via SLEX Toll Road 5 (TR5). It then curves as it enters Santo Tomas before it ends at kilometer 57.5, continuing towards Batangas City as the STAR Tollway.

== History ==
=== Planning and construction ===

The South Luzon Expressway was originally built during the 1960s as the Manila South Diversion Road, South Superhighway, or Manila South Expressway as newer roads used to travel from and to Manila. Located then in the province of Rizal, the original stretch of the expressway, spanning approximately from EDSA (Highway 54) in Magallanes, Makati to Alabang Exit in Muntinlupa, was constructed beginning in 1967 and was completed on December 16, 1969. It is the second roadway project completed by the Philippine National Construction Corporation, after North Luzon Expressway.

Later, the expressway was extended by another from Alabang up to Calamba, Laguna through the Manila South Expressway Extension project. It included the Alabang Viaduct in Alabang. The extension was completed and inaugurated by President Ferdinand Marcos on May 4, 1978, which was opened to public use a few weeks later.

In 1982, South Superhighway from Magallanes to Calamba was renamed to &quot;Dr. Jose P. Rizal Highway&quot;, after the Philippine national hero Dr. José Rizal, who hailed from Laguna. This renaming was brought about by Batas Pambansa Blg. 264. In 1989, it was renamed to &quot;President Sergio Osmeña Sr. Highway&quot;, after the Commonwealth President Sergio Osmeña, by virtue of Republic Act No. 6760. The act was amended through Republic Act No. 7625 in 1992 to rename its portion in Laguna from kilometer 28.387 in San Pedro southwards to &quot;Dr. Jose P. Rizal Highway&quot;.

In 1995, the rehabilitation of the portion of SLEX from Magallanes to Alabang began as part of South Metro Manila Skyway Project Stage 1 that also includes the construction of the elevated Skyway above it up to Bicutan area. Thus, the Alabang Exit, which was also the expressway&#x27;s former southern terminus, was designated as the concession boundary as PNCC decided to split SLEX into two concessions – the section from Magallanes to Alabang is made part of the Skyway System as the Skyway At-Grade, while the remaining section from Alabang southwards retains the South Luzon Expressway concession branding.

=== Expansion and rehabilitation ===

In 1996, PNCC entered into a joint venture with Hong Kong-based Hopewell Holdings to modernize and extend the expressway. The JV agreement also proposes the extension of the expressway by about from Calamba to Pagbilao, Quezon. However, Hopewell Crown Infrastructure Inc. (HCII) would later back out of the undertaking in 2003, thus Hopewell&#x27;s deal with PNCC was also terminated in 2005.

On February 1, 2006, a new agreement was signed between Malaysia-based MTD Berhad and PNCC to rehabilitate, extend, and operate the expressway. Rehabilitation work started in May of that year, with heavy traffic brought by construction work. Prior to its rehabilitation, the South Luzon Expressway section from Alabang to Calamba was mostly an expressway with a grass median and two lanes per direction. The widening of the Alabang Viaduct from three to four lanes per direction, a phase known as the SLEX Toll Road 1, was completed on November 11, 2008. During the construction of Skyway Stage 2 from 2009 to 2011, there were traffic disruptions on the Bicutan–Alabang section. The use of the &quot;sosrobahu&quot; method to build and position the bridge piers helped mitigate these disruptions. Rehabilitation work on SLEX Toll Road 2 was finished in June 2009, resulting in the expansion of the Alabang–Santa Rosa section to eight lanes (four lanes per direction), similar to an American Interstate Highway, and the Santa Rosa–Calamba section to six lanes (three lanes per direction).

One year and six months after the Alabang Viaduct was rehabilitated and widened and eleven months after the completion of rehabilitation and modernization of the expressway&#x27;s Alabang–Calamba section, the operation and maintenance of the expressway was transferred from the government-owned Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC) to South Luzon Tollways Corporation (SLTC) and Manila Toll Expressway Systems (MATES) on May 2, 2010.
The expressway became connected with STAR Tollway when construction works of Toll Road 3 project reached Santo Tomas Exit in 2009, making the exit the southern terminus of the expressway since then. The new Calamba Toll Plaza A and B and Ayala Greenfield Estate toll plazas were also commissioned in the same year. Toll Road 3, also known as the SLEX-STAR Tollway link, was then inaugurated on June 15, 2010, by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and opened to the public six months later on December 15, 2010, during the administration of her successor Benigno Aquino III, with the name Alabang–Calamba–Santo Tomas Expressway (ACTEX).

MTD relinquished its stake in operating and maintaining SLEX to San Miguel Corporation (SMC) in January 2012. To decongest traffic, the SLEX Elevated Extension, originally known as Skyway Extension project, was constructed along the shoulder of the expressway in Muntinlupa from 2019 to 2021 and has connected the expressway&#x27;s segment south of the Alabang Viaduct to Skyway Stage 2.

In December 2022, the implementation of the Seamless Southern Tollways project began on SLEX to simplify the toll collection process to a single payment upon exit. Additional toll plazas were built at interchanges from Canlubang to Santo Tomas, while the Calamba and Ayala Greenfield Estates toll plazas were converted into pass-through lanes and eventually demolished in 2024. In 2023, an expansion project began to widen the expressway&#x27;s segment south of the SLEX Elevated Extension ramps to six (2x6) lanes per direction, necessitating the felling of 8,766 trees along the route. The project also involves the expansion of 20 bridges along SLEX and the demolition of the Calamba and Ayala Greenfield Estates toll plazas, with completion targeted for December 2024. It is expected to be complete by June 2025. In addition, the Ayala Greenfield Interchange in Calamba broke ground on October 14, 2024, and construction is expected to begin in December 2024.

==Future==
===Toll Road 4===

The South Luzon Expressway Toll Road 4, also referred to as Toll Road 4 (TR4), is a extension of South Luzon Expressway from Calamba (near its boundary with Santo Tomas, Batangas) to Lucena. Construction is divided into five segments, with one additional extension to Mayao in Lucena on the revised project outline. The extension project is implemented by the Toll Regulatory Board and will be operated by the SMC SLEX, Inc. (formerly South Luzon Tollway Corporation). The extension would decongest the existing national road between Santo Tomas and Lucena, and provide a modern alternate route for travellers from Quezon to the Bicol Region. Right-of-way acquisition is ongoing as of 2019, and the groundbreaking ceremony was held on March 26, 2019, alongside the beginning of construction. Right of way has been secured for the initial three segments from Calamba to Tiaong, with ongoing efforts to acquire land for the remaining stretch up to Lucena. The expressway&#x27;s starting point has been relocated near the Ayala Greenfield Golf Course after several alignment adjustments prompted by right-of-way challenges. This section is designed initially with two lanes per direction, with potential for future expansion to 3–4 lanes.

The expressway is expected to partially open in 2026 or 2027.

===Toll Road 5===
The South Luzon Expressway Toll Road 5, also referred to as Toll Road 5 (TR5), will be the extension of South Luzon Expressway from Mayao, Lucena to the vicinity of Port of Matnog in Matnog, Sorsogon. The total length of the extension would be approximately . It will be four-lane divided toll road with 28 interchanges and eight segments. It aims to decongest Andaya Highway and Pan-Philippine Highway, cut travel time from Manila to Naga by two to three hours, and to Matnog by six hours. When completed, it will become the longest expressway in the Philippines.

On June 29, 2020, the Toll Regulatory Board issued a resolution to declare this project a Toll Road upon the request of, and based on the proposal submitted by the joint venture (JV) of the Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC) and San Miguel Holdings Corporation (SMHC). On August 25, 2020, San Miguel Corporation thru South Luzon Toll Road 5 Expressway Inc. announced they will invest this project alongside the Pasig River Expressway with a cost of in order to boost the economy in Luzon. The original plan for the expressway&#x27;s extension was the Quezon-Bicol Expressway (QBEX or QUBEX), which was supposed to be an extension of the SLEX from Pagbilao to San Fernando, Camarines Sur. The 2017 proposal would have been a public-private partnership (PPP), with a total length of , and the 2019 proposal, which would have been , was supposed to be funded through the General Appropriations Act (GAA). However, the proposal was removed from the priority projects list in 2022.

On June 3, 2022, the Department of Transportation and San Miguel Corporation signed a Supplemental Toll Operations Agreement (STOA) for SLEX Toll Road 5, which was approved by President Rodrigo Duterte 24 days later.

===Other future plans===
Other planned expansion projects in the SMC–PNCC joint venture pipeline with connections to either SLEX and the Skyway system include:
==Toll==

Previously employing closed and barrier toll systems, the South Luzon Expressway fully employs a closed road system, wherein the toll fee is charged based on vehicle class and the distance travelled from the entry to exit point. The expressway&#x27;s toll system is integrated with the South Metro Manila Skyway Project and Muntinlupa–Cavite Expressway (MCX).

Toll collection is done upon exit at either SLEX, STAR Tollway, or MCX, or at Skyway Main toll plaza in Muntinlupa, as part of San Miguel Corporation&#x27;s Seamless Southern Tollways program. Access between the exits on the Canlubang–Calamba segment and on the northernmost segment between Magallanes and Sales interchanges remain toll-free.

The expressway fully implements an electronic toll collection (ETC) system, the Autosweep RFID, using RFID technology, and the system formerly used &quot;E-Pass&quot;, which uses transponder technology. The ETC system is shared by the Skyway, STAR Tollway, NAIAX, MCX and TPLEX. Cash payments are still accepted although ETC is currently being maximized.

The toll rates by vehicle class are as follows:

==Services==
===Service areas===
The South Luzon Expressway currently has nine service areas, with four on the northbound and five on the southbound. All existing service areas occupy large land areas and have restaurants and retail space. The service areas also provide ETC reloading for Autosweep RFID users.

=== Lay-bys ===
The South Luzon Expressway also has lay-bys, or emergency parking areas where motorists can stop for safety checks on their vehicles and other emergencies.

<doc id="724871" wikidata="Q459133" url="?curid=724871" title="Sukhoi Su-37">
<text>The Sukhoi Su-37 (-37; NATO reporting name: Flanker-F; popularly nicknamed &quot;Terminator&quot;) was a single-seat twin-engine aircraft designed by the Sukhoi Design Bureau which served as a technology demonstrator. It met the need to enhance pilot control of the Su-27M (later renamed Su-35), a further development of the Su-27. The sole example built was originally the eleventh Su-27M (T10M-11) built by the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association before having thrust-vectoring nozzles installed. It also had updated flight- and weapons-control systems. The aircraft made its maiden flight in April 1996. Throughout the flight-test program, the Su-37 demonstrated its supermaneuverability at air shows, performing manoeuvres such as a 360-degree somersault. The aircraft crashed in December 2002 due to structural failure. The Su-37 did not enter production, despite a report in 1998 which claimed that Sukhoi had built a second Su-37 using the twelfth Su-27M airframe, T10M-11 remained the sole prototype. Sukhoi had instead applied the aircraft&#x27;s systems to the design bureau&#x27;s other fighter designs.

== Design and development ==
The Sukhoi Design Bureau started research on thrust vectoring in 1983, when the Soviet government tasked the bureau with the separate development of the Su-27M. At the insistence of General Director Mikhail Simonov, who had been the chief designer of the Su-27, Sukhoi and the Siberian Aeronautical Research Institute studied vectoring nozzles. This was in contrast to the focus on two-dimensional nozzles prevailing in the West. Lyulka (later Lyulka-Saturn) also began studies of thrust-vectoring engines in 1985. By the late 1980s, Sukhoi were evaluating their research using its flying test beds.
During test flights of the Su-27Ms, which began in 1988, engineers discovered that pilots failed to maintain active control of the aircraft at high angles of attack due to the ineffectiveness of flight control surfaces at low speeds. Engineers therefore installed thrust-vectoring engines to the eleventh Su-27 (factory code T10M-11), which had been built by the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association in the country&#x27;s Far East and was being used as a radar test bed. Following the airframe&#x27;s completion in early 1995, the aircraft was delivered to the design bureau&#x27;s experimental plant near Moscow, where engineers started installing the nozzles on the aircraft. Although Sukhoi had intended the Lyulka-Saturn AL-37FU to power the aircraft, the engine had not yet been flight-cleared. The aircraft was temporarily fitted with the less-powerful AL-31FP engine, essentially an AL-31F engine that had the AL-100 vectoring nozzles of the AL-37FU. The aircraft was rolled out in May. Two months later, the temporary engines were replaced with AL-37FUs; its nozzles could only deflect 15 degrees up or down in the pitch axis, together or differentially.

Apart from the addition of thrust-vectoring nozzles, the Su-37 did not outwardly differ much from the canard-equipped Su-27M. Instead, engineers had focused on the aircraft&#x27;s avionics. Unlike previous Su-27Ms, the Su-37 had a digital (as opposed to analogue) fly-by-wire flight control system, which was directly linked to the thrust-vectoring control system. Together with the aircraft&#x27;s overall high thrust-to-weight ratio and the engine&#x27;s full authority digital engine control feature, the integrated propulsion and flight control systems added maneuverability at high angles of attack and low speeds. The aircraft&#x27;s weapons-control system had also been improved, as it included an N011M Bars (literally &quot;Panther&quot;) pulse-Doppler phased-array radar that provided the aircraft with simultaneous air-to-air and air-to-ground capability. The radar was capable of tracking twenty aerial targets and directing missiles toward eight of them simultaneously; in comparison, the Su-27M&#x27;s baseline N011 could only track fifteen aerial targets and engage six of them simultaneously. The aircraft retained from the Su-27M the N012 self-defence radar located in the rearward-projecting tail boom.

Considerable improvement had also been made to the cockpit layout. In addition to the head-up display, the Su-37 had four Sextant Avionique multi-function colour liquid crystal displays arranged in a &quot;T&quot; configuration; they had better backlight protection than the Su-27M&#x27;s monochrome cathode-ray tube displays. The displays presented to the pilot information about navigation, systems status, and weapons selection. The pilot sat on an ejection seat that was reclined to 30 degrees to improve g-force tolerance. 

Painted in a disruptive sand and brown scheme, the aircraft was given the code &quot;711 Blue&quot;, later changed to &quot;711 White&quot;. Following ground checks at the Gromov Flight Research Institute, the aircraft made its maiden flight on 2 April 1996 from Zhukovsky Airfield outside Moscow, piloted by Yevgeni Frolov. The nozzles were fixed during the first five flights. Due to the lack of funding from the Russian Air Force, Sukhoi was compelled to finance the project with its own funds; according to Simonov, the company channelled revenue from the exports of the Su-27s to China and Vietnam towards the project. The aircraft was publicly unveiled at Zhukovsky later in the year, and was redesignated Su-37.

== Operational history ==
During the subsequent flight-test programme, the Su-37&#x27;s supermaneuverability as a result of thrust-vectoring controls became apparent. According to Simonov, such a feature would allow pilots to develop new combat manoeuvres and tactics, greatly enhancing its effectiveness in dogfights. Among the new manoeuvres was the Super Cobra, which was a variation of the Pugachev&#x27;s Cobra and was demonstrated during the aircraft&#x27;s international debut at the Farnborough Airshow in September 1996. Piloted by Frolov, the aircraft pitched up 180 degrees and maintained the tail-first position momentarily, which would theoretically allow the aircraft to fire a missile at a combat opponent. The Super Cobra evolved into the &quot;kulbit&quot; (somersault), in which the Su-37 performed a 360-degree loop with an extremely tight turning radius the length of the aircraft. According to test pilot Anatoly Kvochur, thrust vectoring would have given the aircraft a considerable advantage in close-in dogfights. Nonetheless, critics have questioned the practical benefits of such manoeuvres; although they would allow an early missile lock-on, it would come at the expense of a rapid loss of kinetic energy, which would leave the aircraft vulnerable when pilots missed their first shot.

The aircraft was demonstrated at the Paris Air Show in 1997. Although it was only able to perform on the last day of the show, the organisers recognised the Su-37 as the standout performer at the event. The aircraft thereafter participated in the MAKS air show in Moscow, the International Defence Exhibition in Dubai, and the FIDAE air show in Santiago, Chile, as authorities sought to export the aircraft. With the expiration of the engines&#x27; service lives, the aircraft had the AL-37FUs replaced with standard production AL-31F engines which lacked movable nozzles. The loss of thrust vectoring was partially mitigated by an update to the fly-by-wire flight control system. The aircraft&#x27;s foreign avionics were also replaced with indigenous designs. It resumed test flights in October 2000.

The flight-test programme ended on 19 December 2002 when the aircraft&#x27;s port tailplane broke off during a high-g manoeuvre, leading to it crashing at Shatura, near Moscow. The structural failure was caused by repeated exceeding of the aircraft&#x27;s design load during six years of testing. The pilot Yuri Vashuk ejected safely. Despite the entry of the Su-37 into Brazilian and South Korean fighter tenders, the aircraft failed to gain any foreign customers. India in the mid-1990s funded the development of what would result in the Su-30MKI, which is a two-seat fighter design that incorporated the canards, N011M radar and thrust-vectoring technology that were present and evaluated on the Su-37. In addition, through tests of the Su-27M and the Su-37, engineers had determined that thrust vectoring could compensate for the loss of manoeuvrability brought about by the removal of canards, the design of which imposed a weight penalty on the airframe. The modernized Su-35, without canards, made its first flight in February 2008.

<doc id="724889" wikidata="Q4893633" url="?curid=724889" title="Willowbrook State School">
<text>Willowbrook State School was a state-supported institution for children with intellectual disabilities in the Willowbrook neighborhood of Staten Island in New York City, which operated from 1947 until 1987.

The school was designed for 4,000, but by 1965 it had a population of 6,000. At the time, it was the biggest state-run institution for people with mental disabilities in the United States. Conditions and questionable medical practices and experiments prompted US Senator Robert F. Kennedy to call it a &quot;snake pit&quot;. The institution gained national infamy in 1972, when Geraldo Rivera did an exposé on the conditions there. Public outcry led to its closure in 1987, and to federal civil rights legislation protecting people with disabilities. A February 2020 &quot;New York Times&quot; investigation found that the alumni of Willowbrook continue to be abused in smaller group homes.

A portion of the grounds and some of the buildings were incorporated into the campus of the College of Staten Island, which moved to Willowbrook in the early 1990s. Records and documentation relating to the experiences of the school residents and staff, and the activities of parents and caregivers who brought about the closure of the school are held by the College of Staten Island Library Archives.

==Construction and early conversion==
In 1938, plans were drawn up to build a facility for children who had an intellectual disability on in the Willowbrook section of Staten Island. Construction was completed in 1942, but instead of opening for its original purpose, it was converted into a United States Army hospital, and named Halloran General Hospital, after the late Colonel Paul Stacey Halloran. After World War II, proposals were introduced to turn the site over to the Veterans Administration, but in October 1947, the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene opened its facility there as originally planned, and the institution was named Willowbrook State School.

==Hepatitis studies==
Throughout the first decade of its operation, outbreaks of hepatitis, primarily hepatitis A, were common at the school. This led to controversial medical studies being carried out there by medical researchers Saul Krugman of New York University and Robert W. McCollum of Yale University. Between 1956 and 1971, Krugman and McCollum monitored subjects to gauge the effects of gamma globulin in combating it. One result of the research was a better understanding of the differences between serum hepatitis, which is spread by blood transfusions, and infectious hepatitis, which is spread directly from person to person and is the more common form. A public outcry forced the research project and medical studies to be discontinued.

Paul A. Offit described Krugman&#x27;s studies as follows:

In an effort to control outbreaks of hepatitis, the medical staff at Willowbrook consulted Saul Krugman... Krugman found that hepatitis developed in 90 percent of children admitted to Willowbrook soon after their arrival. Although it was known that hepatitis was caused by a virus, it wasn&#x27;t known how hepatitis virus spread, whether it could be prevented, or how many types of viruses caused the disease. Krugman used the children of Willowbrook to answer those questions. One of his studies involved feeding live hepatitis virus from others stool samples to sixty healthy children. Krugman watched as their skin and eyes turned yellow and their livers got bigger. He watched them vomit and refuse to eat. All the children fed hepatitis virus became ill, some severely. Krugman reasoned that it was justifiable to inoculate retarded children at Willowbrook with hepatitis virus because most of them would get hepatitis anyway. But by purposefully giving the children hepatitis, Krugman increased that chance to 100 percent.

According to vaccinologist Maurice Hilleman, &quot;They [the Willowbrook studies] were the most unethical medical experiments ever performed on children in the United States.&quot; Historian David Rothman notes that, &quot;The research was even included in Henry Beecher&#x27;s 1966 &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; listing of &#x27;ethically dubious&#x27; experiments.&quot; Bioethicist Art Caplan has stated that, &quot;The Willowbrook studies were a turning point in how we thought about medical experiments on retarded children... Children inoculated with hepatitis virus had no chance to benefit from the procedure—only the chance to be harmed.&quot;

==Scandals and abuses==
By 1965, Willowbrook housed over 6,000 intellectually disabled people despite having a maximum capacity of 4,000. US Senator Robert F. Kennedy toured the institution in 1965 and proclaimed that individuals in the overcrowded facility were &quot;living in filth and dirt, their clothing in rags, in rooms less comfortable and cheerful than the cages in which we put animals in a zoo&quot; and offered a series of recommendations for improving conditions. Although the hepatitis study had been discontinued, the residential school&#x27;s reputation was that of a warehouse for New York City&#x27;s mentally disabled people, many of whom were presumably abandoned there by their families, foster care agencies, or other systems designed to care for them. Donna J. Stone, an advocate for mentally disabled children and victims of child abuse, gained access to the school by posing as a recent social work graduate. She then shared her observations with members of the press.

A series of articles in local newspapers, including the &quot;Staten Island Advance&quot; and the &quot;Staten Island Register&quot;, described the crowded, filthy living conditions at Willowbrook, and the negligent treatment of some of its residents. Jane Kurtin was the first reporter to write a story about Willowbrook State School after she visited Willowbrook in order to cover a demonstration that social workers and parents of the residents had organized. Kurtin wanted to get inside the buildings, and social workers Elizabeth Lee and Ira Fisher brought her inside. Shortly thereafter, in early 1972, Geraldo Rivera, then an investigative reporter for WABC-TV in New York, conducted a series of investigations at Willowbrook uncovering a host of deplorable conditions, including overcrowding, inadequate sanitary facilities, and physical and sexual abuse of residents by members of the school&#x27;s staff. Rivera then visited several facilities in California. While the conditions in the California facilities were found to have been significantly improved, the conditions at Willowbrook remained neglectful. The exposé, entitled &quot;Willowbrook: The Last Great Disgrace&quot;, garnered national attention and won a Peabody Award for Rivera. Rivera later appeared on the nationally televised &quot;Dick Cavett Show&quot; with film of patients at the school. As a result of the overcrowding and inhumane conditions, a class-action lawsuit was filed against the State of New York by the parents of 5,000 residents of Willowbrook in federal court on March 17, 1972. This was known as &quot;New York ARC v. Rockefeller&quot;. Elizabeth Lee&#x27;s employment was terminated in 1972 as a result of her activism with the parents.

In 1975, a consent judgment was signed, and it committed New York state to improve community placement for the, now designated, &quot;Willowbrook Class&quot;. The publicity generated by the case was a major contributing factor to the passage of a federal law — the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act of 1980.

According to a February 2020 &quot;New York Times&quot; investigation &quot;[t]hat vow has been broken: Many of the institution&#x27;s 2,300 alumni who are alive today still suffer from mistreatment.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; reported that in 2019 there have been &quot;97 reported allegations of physical abuse by group home workers against Willowbrook alumni...&quot; also &quot;34 allegations of psychological abuse and hundreds more of neglect and other mistreatment, like improper use of restraints or seclusion, medication errors and theft.&quot; Investigations were conducted by the New York State Office for People With Developmental Disabilities but were unable to prove abuse claiming that &quot;Strong union protections allowed them to block their dismissals in arbitration.&quot; Bronx County District Attorney Darcel Clark investigated one facility that houses Willowbrook alumni but found insufficient evidence for abuse, witnesses not willing to come forward, and victims not able to speak for themselves. &quot;It’s not whether or not it happened,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#x27;s what could we prove.&quot;

==Closure==
In 1975, a Willowbrook Consent Decree was signed that committed New York state to improve community placement for the now designated &quot;Willowbrook Class&quot;.

In 1983, the state of New York announced plans to close Willowbrook, which had been renamed the Staten Island Developmental Center in 1974. By the end of March 1986, the number of residents housed there had dwindled to 250, and the last children left the grounds on September 17, 1987. After the developmental center closed, the site became the focus of intense local debate about what should be done with the property. In 1989, a portion of the land was acquired by the city of New York, with the intent of using it to establish a new campus for the College of Staten Island, and the new campus opened at Willowbrook in 1993. This campus is the largest maintained by the City University of New York. Within the year, one of CSI&#x27;s two other existing campuses, located in the Sunnyside neighborhood, was closed, renovated, and reopened in 1995 as the home of the new K-12 Michael J. Petrides School. The rest of Willowbrook&#x27;s original property is still under the administration of the Office for People with Developmental Disabilities (OPWDD) —an agency of New York State— and houses the New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities, and the Staten Island Developmental Disabilities Service Office.

On February 25, 1987, the Federal Court approved the Willowbrook &quot;1987 Stipulation&quot;, which set forth guidelines that required OMRDD (Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities; renamed the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities, in July 2010) community placement for the &quot;Willowbrook Class&quot;. The Willowbrook School was closed that year. All but about 150 of the former Willowbrook residents were moved to group homes by 1992. Significant members of the &quot;Willowbrook Class&quot; were not as intellectually limited as the term &quot;developmental delay&quot; would indicate. Some had cerebral palsy, a developmental disability that can be accompanied by varying degrees of intellectual impairment, and some members of this class were cognitively quite intact, yet unable to communicate verbally due to their physical condition. These ex-residents of Willowbrook, many now in their 50s and 60s, live in a variety of community residences and attend day programs throughout New York State, under the care of organizations such as United Cerebral Palsy or the Jewish Guild for the Blind.

In the 1991 book &quot;The Soul of a Cop&quot;, retired NYPD detective Paul Ragonese describes responding to &quot;building two&quot; of the abandoned Willowbrook campus as a member of the NYPD Bomb Squad. Ragonese describes an abandoned building full of hazardous chemicals, including explosive picric acid crystals, along with rooms full of jars containing specimens of human organs. Ragonese goes on to write that the incident was largely covered up by local officials.

==Former students==
In 1997, Danny Aiello hosted, and Geraldo Rivera served as commentator for, a 57-minute documentary titled &quot;Unforgotten: 25 Years After Willowbrook&quot;, which revisits Staten Island&#x27;s Willowbrook State School, &quot;remembering the over 5,000 children who were living in the facility at the time and focusing on three former residents, to see how the effects of the institution have been felt by families and friends of patients as well.&quot; Writes &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer, Stephen Holden:

As graphically as it recounts the horrors of the past, &quot;Unforgotten&quot; is less concerned with raking the coals of an old scandal than with showing how the treatment of the mentally disabled has since improved. The film ... focuses on the lives of two who were once incarcerated at Willowbrook but subsequently flourished in group homes situated in close proximity to their families. / A third longtime resident of Willowbrook, Bernard Carabello, is also interviewed. Mr. Carabello, who suffers from cerebral palsy, spent 18 years at Willowbrook after being misdiagnosed as mentally retarded at the age of 3. / In looking at the lives of Patty Ann Meskell and Luis Rivera (who died shortly after the film was completed), both of whom spent many years at Willowbrook, the movie stresses their essential humanity. Each is shown interacting with loving family members who are still deeply stung by memories of visits to Willowbrook more than 25 years ago. / The film, narrated by Danny Aiello, isn&#x27;t so much an investigative documentary as a blunt plea for the humane treatment of the mentally disabled. It also warns that despite changes in social attitudes (the Special Olympics are cited as a shining example of progress), Willowbrook could happen again. Remembrance is a vital key to the prevention of future abuse.

In March 2009, a fire in a residence in Wells, New York, killed four members of the &quot;Willowbrook Class&quot;.

Willowbrook State Hospital is mentioned in the 2009 documentary movie &quot;Cropsey&quot; as having reportedly housed convicted child kidnapper Andre Rand, who had previously worked there as an orderly. One of Rand&#x27;s supposed victims, Jennifer Schweiger, was found buried in a shallow grave behind the grounds of the abandoned Willowbrook State School, which was built under the same design as Pilgrim State Hospital.

In 2011, a former resident of Willowbrook State School, a savant named Anthony Torrone, wrote a Christian prayer book titled &quot;Anthony&#x27;s Prayers&quot; that was inspired by his time and the abuse he experienced at the school.

<doc id="724897" wikidata="Q1725" url="?curid=724897" title="Lipa, Batangas">
<text>Lipa (), officially the City of Lipa (), is a component city in the province of Batangas, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 372,931 people.

It is the first city charter in the province and one of five cities in Batangas alongside Batangas City, Calaca, Santo Tomas, and Tanauan. It is located south of Manila and is the most populous city of Batangas.

The Southern Tagalog Arterial Road (STAR) and South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) provide access to Batangas City and Metro Manila.

==Etymology==
Batangueños from the early years had their settlement in Bombon Lake and began dispersing to other places when the volcano erupted. While a group of people was moving to another settlement area, the image of St. Sebastian was stolen from them and later on was found on a tree called &quot;lipa.&quot; People believed that the patron saint wished to name that place &quot;Lipa&quot;.

==History==

The primal composition in the southeastern region of Bombon Lake were elements of the dispersed colonial families founded by two datus, namely, Dumangsil and Balkasusa in Taal, Batangas, between the 10th and 13th century. These pioneer settlers under the leadership of the fleeing Datu Puti, formerly purchased the lowlands from King Marikudo of Panay.

It is however subject to conjecture whether the pre-historic Negritos 12,000 to 15,000 years age or the much later waves of Austronesian seafarers from 5,000 to 300 B.C. were able to settle along the coasts of Batangas into the inner lake region of Taal which was accessible to navigation through the Pansipit River, thus, the possibility of miscegenetic marriages and cross culture among the aboriginal inhabitants, the old settlers and the later Dumangsil and Balkasusa clans, or whether violent wars have been waged between the old inhabitants and new colonizers is uncertain as well.

Out of this Bornean tribe of the Dumangsil and Balkasusa clans came the ancestry of Lipa and as later on, their descendants who spread out towards Laguna de Bay and Bicol Peninsula. The remains excavated from their ancient settlements in Butong, Taal, Calatagan and Balayan attest to the fact of their presence in the said site at least in the latter part of the 13th century down to the coming of Goiti and Legaspi in Batangas in 1570. The flourishing trade relations between these early Batangueños with a number of Chinese merchants prior to the Spanish conquest explained the presence of hundreds of Chinese wares from potteries to stonewares and vases of Song dynasty period to the latter part of the 16th century, in the burial grounds at Calatagan sites of Pulung Bakaw, Kay Tomas, Pinagpatayan I and II at Butong, all in Taal, Batangas.

By origin the early Lipeños were Buddhist in religion and Indian in civilization. With its not infrequent contact with the Chinese traders, the Batangueños have absorbed and been influenced too by China. With the Spanish colonization of the Philippines and the Salcedo conquest of Batangas in 1572, the Lipeños were forced to embrace Western civilization.

===Spanish rule===
At the coming of the Spaniards to Batangas in 1570, the Malay settlements along the southern shores of Taal Lake at Tagbakin was inhabited by the warlike descendants of the two datus called the Tagalogs. In 1605, after Marshall Gabriel de Rivera received the encomienda of Bombon, the Augustinian Fathers made Tagbakin the first settlement of the Lipeños and a mission center with the name of San Sebastian, perhaps after the installed Patron Saint, which continued to the present. The settlement was made a regular municipality in 1702 and a regular parish in 1716 with Fray Diego de Alday as the first curate.

With the eruption of Taal Volcano in 1724, the people moved to what is now &quot;Lumang Lipa&quot; (part of present-day Mataasnakahoy) and, again, in 1754, they moved to Balete where they settled for two years until 1756 when they moved inland to the present site obviously for more security from volcanic eruptions. When Don Galo de los Reyes was the governadorcillo of Lipa, he introduced the cultivation of coffee. The seeds of the Arabica species were said to be of two chupas brought in from Mexico by an Augustinian missionary. The coffee industry so flourished and made Lipa the richest municipality in the country with an annual income of that on October 21, 1887, the Queen regent Maria Christina, acting for the young King Alfonso XIII, signed a decree elevating Lipa to a city known as &quot;Villa de Lipa&quot;, and later authorized to use a coat of arms by the Royal Overseas Minister Don Víctor Balaguer.

At the celebration of the elevation of Lipa to a city in January 1888, José Rizal was invited by Dr. Jose Lozada, Catalino Dimayuga and the brothers Celestino and Simeon Luz but Rizal responded only with his Hymno Al Trabajo which he dedicated to the zeal and industry of the Lipeños.

The raising of cacao was introduced in Lipa by an Augustinian priest, Father Ignacio de Mercado, and that was the beginning of its cultivation throughout the Philippines.

The Lipeños also engaged themselves in livestock raising and varied home crafts for men, and small industries, like weaving, embroidery and sewing for women. After World War II, citrus production prevailed until 1970 and, after its decline, about 1965, poultry and swine raising began to take roots and to thrive in no small degree until the present.

The first newspaper in Batangas, published in Spanish, was the &quot;Lumubog-Lumutang&quot;, printed in Lipa in 1889, and established by the well-known writers Cipriano Kalaw, Gregorio Katigbak, Benito Reyes, Hugo Latorre and Pedro Laygo. Other pioneer Spanish writers were Bernardo Solis, Catalino Dimayuga and Manuel Luz.

During the revolution, Gregorio Aguilera Solis edited a newspaper &quot;Columnas Voluntas de la Federacion Malaya&quot;. This paper became the media for notable poems and literary works of Albino Dimayuga, Baldomero Roxas, Luis Lina Kison, Bernardo Solis, Benedicto Solis, Emiliano Manguiat and Petronio Katigbak.

Roman Dimayuga wrote plays, while Pedro Laygo published articles on domestic and international politics and Tomas Umali on military affairs. Hispanistas during the American regime included national figures like Teodoro Kalaw, Fidel Reyes, Arsenio Luz, Max B. Solis, Enrique Laygo and Claro M. Recto. Lipeños also served in the Revolutionary Republic. These were Gregorio Aguilera who was delegate to the Malolos Congress; Ceferino Pantoja, also a member of that congress; Jose Lozada, as envoy to Washington, D.C., and Paris, and Cipriano Kalaw, the first vice-president and Treasurer of the Central Committee of Hong Kong.

In the field of education, Father Valerio Malabanan was foremost among Lipeños who established schools. Others were Sebastian Virrey, Jacinto Silva, Candido Lantin and Gregorio Katigbak. In 1894, Brigido Morada established his own school at his house in Mataas na Lupa. Under Father Valerio Malabanan were such well-known figures as Apolinario Mabini, General Miguel Malvar and Sotero Laurel.

Sebastian Virrey countered with such former students as the brothers Alfonso and Claro M. Recto; Fidel and Carmelo Reyes; Teodoro and Maximo Kalaw; Pacifico, Jose and Enrique Laygo; and Manuel Luz Roxas, Jose D. Dimayuga, Bernabe Africa, Pablo Borbon, Potenciano Malvar, Leoncio Aranda and Bishop Alfredo Obviar.

The later school, perhaps marked for permanence by the enthusiastic patronage of its high standard maintained through the years since its founding in 1922 until the present, is the Mabini Academy established by Dr. Jose Ma. Katigbak, Randall A. Rowley, Tarcila Malabanan-Katigbak and Emilia Malabanan. The fact that Lipeños, even up to the present, are very religious, may be attributed to the fact that Fr. Benito Baras, who was Parish Priest of Lipa for almost three decades (1865–1894), has considered Villa de Lipa as his very own and had shown great paternal love for the Lipeños that he constructed the Parish Church (now Cathedral of the Archdiocese of Lipa) and a new and bigger cemetery with a chapel.

A plaque of dedication to the opening and blessing of the new Campo Santo De Lipa (Cemetery of Lipa) can still be seen at the archway of the entrance, an attestment of Fr. Benito Baras&#x27; dedication to the people of Villa de Lipa. Moreover, without aid from the State, he constructed the bridge at Sabang and the road that served as a national highway to Manila and Laguna.

===American occupation===
The Parish of Lipa, established in 1716, became a diocesan center in 1910, included the provinces of Batangas, Laguna, Tayabas (Quezon), Marinduque and Mindoro, with Msgr. Jose Petrelli as the first bishop.

Barrios Luta, Bilukaw, Kalikangan (Caligañgan), Payapa, and San Gallo (San Galo) were excised from Lipa to form the new independent municipality of Malvar by virtue of an Executive Order issued by acting Governor-General Charles Yeater on December 16, 1918, with the municipality&#x27;s inauguration taking effect on January 10, 1919. Mataasnakahoy, which includes Lumang Lipa, likewise became a separate municipality through Executive Order No. 308 signed by acting Governor-General of the Philippines George C. Butte on March 27, 1931, taking effect on January 1, 1932.

===Cityhood===

On August 31, 1947, Lipa was inaugurated as a chartered City created under Republic Act No. 162 approved on June 20, 1947.

On June 21, 1969, barrios Alangilan, Balete, Calawit, Looc, Magapi, Makina, Malabanan, Palsara, Sampalukan, and Solis, along with sitios Paligawan, Sala, and Wani-Wani, were excised from Lipa to form part of the new independent municipality of Balete, by virtue of Republic Act No. 5659.

==Geography==

Lipa covers an area of at an elevation of above sea level. Lipa&#x27;s fishing area is located at barangay Halang, in the west of the city; it is actually a portion of Taal Lake, which is connected to other municipalities (Cuenca, Mataasnakahoy and Balete).

Lipa is bounded by the city of Santo Tomas in the northeast, the city of San Pablo of Laguna, and the municipalities of Tiaong and San Antonio, Quezon in the east, the municipalities of Padre Garcia and Rosario in the southeast, the municipalities of Ibaan and San Jose in the southwest, the municipalities of Cuenca and Mataasnakahoy and Taal Lake in the west and the municipalities of Balete and Malvar in the northwest.

The city&#x27;s location, in a valley between the Malepunyo Mountain Range and Mount Macolod, makes it a low-risk area for natural disasters. These two mountains serve as a windbreak during typhoons. Mount Macolod, in the west, also served as shield during eruptions of the Taal Volcano.

===Barangays===
Lipa is politically subdivided into 72 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.


























San Jose was formerly known as Patay. In 1955, the sitios of Duhatan, Tagbakin, Initan, Malabong and Halang (then part of the Pinagtungolan barrio) became an independent barrio.
In 1957, the sitios of Waniwani, Sayatin and Look were moved from the Balete barrio to the barrio of Look.

=== Religion ===

====Catholicism====

Majority of the city&#x27;s population are Roman Catholics, and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lipa today comprises the civil province of Batangas. Formed as the Diocese of Lipa on April 10, 1910, the archdiocese once covered other provinces such as Batangas, Laguna, Quezon, Marinduque and Mindoro, with Most Reverend Joseph Petrelli, D.D. as the first bishop. Currently, the archdiocese is divided into 6 vicariates, each headed by a vicar forane. There are 49 parishes in all, served by 143 priests (122 of which are diocesan), 13 religious brothers, and 197 religious sisters. There are also 23 existing Catholic schools, two high school seminaries, three college seminaries, and two pastoral centers.

The Church and Monastery of Lipa is the location of a 1940s apparition of the Virgin Mary which was seen by sister Teresing Castillo and numerous accounts of rose petal showers from the 1940s to the 1960s. Some of the rose petals, which had the silhouette of the Virgin Mary when flashed with light, have been preserved by the Diocese of Lipa and various townfolks who have witnessed the petal showers. An investigation conducted by researchers of the University of the Philippines proved that the figures on the petals were natural and not stamped by man-made means. A few years after the apparition of the Virgin Mary, the Vatican released a document stating that the apparition in Lipa was false. Despite this, the rose petal showers continued until the last apparition of Mary appeared, saying three things, of which the most important was to &#x27;pray for China&#x27;, which at the time was among the poorest regions in the world. Due to the decline of the Vatican regarding the apparition, the Diocese of Lipa ordered the destruction of Mary&#x27;s statue in the church which depicted the apparition. However, the founding nuns of the church hid it instead. Decades afterwards in the 21st century, before the death of a founding nun, she wished for the statue of the apparition to be viewed by the public once more. Thousands of devotees went back to the church and since then, the statue has been in public view. During a certain event, the priest ordered a mass outside the church to bless the municipality of Lipa, where the apparition statue was brought outside as well. During that time, sun beatings from heaven, which was viewed by thousands of people during a mass outside the church, occurred. Devotees flocked Lipa afterwards, where cures for blindness and terminal sickness were cured through the usage of prayers with the preserved petals from the petal showers of the 1940s to the 1960s. In 2014, it was later found out that most of the bishops who signed in favor of declaring the apparitions of the 1940s as a lie were forced to sign such documents. This sparked the current Lipa Church to gather as much evidence to back the existence and miracles of the apparitions.

====Protestants and other groups====
There are other Christian groups such as various Protestant denominations including Evangelicals, Born Again, Iglesia ni Cristo, Members Church of God International (MCGI), Kingdom of Jesus Christ, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Seventh-Day Adventist, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Other religions include Islam and Buddhism.

== Economy ==

Lipa&#x27;s proximity to the country&#x27;s capital, Manila, having an approximate distance of or approximately an hour-and-half drive via the South Luzon Expressway enhances its strategic access to development trends. It is fast emerging as a key city in the province, becoming a major institutional/administrative center, medical center, commercial center, financial center, agro-industrial center and residential center.

It is identified as an ideal hub and center of the Calabarzon Agro-Industrial Region in the Regional Physical Framework Plan of Region IV-A. In the recent past, Lipa is being transformed from an agrarian to an urbanized area. A significant portion of the agricultural land area of the city has been converted to residential subdivisions, industrial area with the establishment of Lima Technology Center utilizing lands in the city and Malvar Municipality. Recently, the influx of business process outsourcing (BPO) firms such as call centers have contributed much to the growth of the local economy. BPO sites are scattered throughout the city. It ranked 6th out of 10 in the Top 10 next wave cities of 2010 by the Commission of Information and Communication Technology (ICCT). Teletech Inc. pioneered the BPO company in Lipa City in 2006. Alorica followed after few years. The most recent BPO company is The Results.

Likewise, due to a very strategic location, the Lipa City Market is comparatively busy than other neighboring towns. Thus, it boasts a large quantity of market business. As a result, it attracts more customers from neighboring towns like Padre Garcia, Rosario, Ibaan, San Juan, Malvar, Mataas na Kahoy, Balete, Cuenca, and Lemery and from the cities of Batangas, Santo Tomas and Tanauan. An S&amp;R Membership Shopping outlet is located beside it.

It is also noticeable that Lipa City is being home to new settlers from different regions. Muslims from Mindanao for example have settled in Lipa City, primarily due to growing economy. There are also settlers from Mindoro, Bicol, Quezon and other places. Likewise, there are many Koreans who established their business in Lipa. Furthermore, it is evident that Indian Nationals are also an everyday sight.

==Culture==

===Food===

Lipa is the home of &quot;lomi&quot;. According to history, this is primarily due to the influence of early Chinese settlers.
Lomi is cooked using raw noodles, cassava mixed with water, beaten egg, salt and pepper, meat, liver and other ingredients that make it tasty. Eventually, there are countless of variations of Lomi these days. The lomi house is a very common place found in every barangay. However, there are a few recognized by the Lipenos, like Renfel, Kids Lomihouse, LBN, Beegees, Liam&#x27;s to mention a few.

&quot;Goto&quot; is also a popular recipe. It is usually composed of internal organs of cows. This is a bowl of hot soup with beef, tripe, entrails, and blood, added with fish sauce and &quot;calamansi&quot; juice with chili.

However, due to influx of culture from nearby provinces, Lipeños also enjoy new recipes like &quot;sisig&quot; of Pampanga, and &quot;Bicol Express&quot; of Bicol.
Due to Lipa&#x27;s craze for food, several food courts have been established.

===Technology===
Lipa has few technologically advanced infrastructure. PKI is one of the advanced factories that pioneered the productions in Lipa City. Since it was established in Barangay Inosluban, Lipa City was known to be an employment-friendly zone. This was followed by the establishment of LIMA Industrial Park, which houses multiple production lines. It houses various companies that employ hundreds of production workers. Not only from the city proper, it hires employees from its nearby cities like Tanauan, Rosario, Batangas, San Jose, Malvar etc. 
The San Benito Private Estate project is a 25-hectare integrated active wellness township in joint venture with The Farm at San Benito group in Barangay Tipacan, Lipa.

===Museums===
Museo de Lipa, inaugurated in November 2007, is a project of the Lipa City Tourism Council envisioned by its Past President, Lucila R. Resurreccion. On display are antique mementos such as: the Coffee Corner – an exhibit of the different tools used in coffee production; Las trajes de mestizas and ternos – gowns worn by women during the pre-war days and during festive occasions; the Satsuma Vase – a gift given by the Luna brothers to the unparalleled hospitality shown by the aristocratic couple Doña Germana Solis and Dr. Jose Lozada; and the office tables of Don Claro Mayo Recto and Mayor Carlos Solis, the 24-hour Mayor.

Other artifacts exhibited are certain collections of furniture and objects of art loaned and donated by different antique collectors and by some of the landed gentry of Lipa: antique cabinets, tables, mirrors, antique silverware chinaware, tea sets, religious images and articles, jars, and brass artifacts.

The ground floor serves as a function area and features works of several contemporary Lipeño visual artists.

===Religious monuments===
In 1605, Don Diego de Salcedo discovered a community of farmers living in fairly good economic conditions at Lake Bombon, now Tagbakin, Lipa City. The Augustinians among them started a religious mission called “Convent of San Sebastian in Comintang”.

However, the residents noticed that the land area- residential and agricultural-was getting smaller due to the rising waters of Taal Lake, they transferred to Balete. But the site was submerged by the lake in 1754 after the eruption of Taal Volcano. To avoid a similar occurrence, the townsfolk decided to transfer the town to a place far from the lake and the volcano. Legend has it that they agreed to pray the rosary while walking and whenever they may be at the end of the 24th mystery, there the town would be relocated. And they walked upland, away from the lake and the volcano, and at the end of the 24th mystery, they reached what is now called Mataas na Lupa. The temporary poblacion and the church were thus resettled there.

The location benefited everybody since it was along the main road that led to the coastal towns, the ground was high enough and the east winds were hedged in by high mountains. But after some time, the settlers had to seek another location due to the problem of water supply. The “better site” is the present site of the cathedral. The Augustinians administered the parish until the end of the 19th century.

The first church building was made of light materials. The building of “serious architecture, proven solidity and great proportions” was begun in 1779 and finally completed in 1865, on the first year of Fr. Benito Varas who administered the town until 1894.

The church was made of hewn stone and tiled roof, in accordance with the usual pattern of churches. It was a rectangular structure with artistically painted wooden panelings in lieu of an arch to which were attached support and strong beams which crisscrossed the walls to protect the building from earthquakes, attractive and had plain and simple altar ornaments without the extravagant carvings that were characteristic of the past century.

During the 19th century, keen competition among Tanauan, Lipa, Batangas, Bauan and Taal for the choice of the seat of new diocese in the Southern Tagalog Region, with Batangas Province at the center, motivated the people to build extraordinary, big churches. On April 10, 1910, the historic creation of the new diocese took place and the first bishop, Joseph Petrelli, selected Lipa as the see because of its cool climate. In later years, there were moves to transfer the see to San Pablo City but Bishop Alfredo Verzosa turned it down due to poor religious environment of San Pablo during that time.

The church suffered heavily in 1944. Alejandro Olalia repaired the façade, the dome, the transept, the roof, the main altar, and the belfry. The interior painting was retouched. Two side aisles were added. The church was awarded the title Cathedral of the archdiocese incorporating Batangas Province during the administration of Cardinal Rufino Santos.

Pedro G. Galende wrote that &quot;the emphasis (of the edifice) is placed on the mass, which appeals much more to the senses due to its harmonic organization. The three buildings – church, convent and bell tower are so closely associated with each other that they well exemplify the typical mission complex.&quot;

At present, the 220-year old cathedral and convent is undergoing restoration and repairs. Through the efforts of the parish priest, Alfredo A. Madlangbayan, and the San Sebastian Millenium Restoration Committee, the church façade and the belfry have been repainted, the pews are newly varnished, the ceiling and the roof of the dome have been repaired, the old and leaking roof of the church and convent are replaced with long span GI sheets, and there is a new altar at the vigil room. On account of the multitude of faithful gathering at the church during liturgical activities, especially for archdiocesan affairs, the sound system was also upgraded.

===Festivals===
In the previous years, Lipa City had the Coffee Festival as its official city festival being coffee granary of the Philippines. The Coffee Festival was then celebrated from December 11 to 16.

Then Lipa also had the Walistik Festival celebrated on the second week of January where walis (broom) was used in costumes and props. Walis symbolizes unity and this was what the Lipeños had in mind every time they celebrate Walistik Festival.

Now, Lipa City is celebrating Lomi Festival. Lomi, being one of the most popular dishes in this side of the province, Lipa City has quite a number of lomi houses which never cease to entice people.

Traditionally, however, Lipa City is celebrating Lipa City Town Fiesta annually every January 20. This is a date to celebrate the feast of their patron saint, Saint Sebastian. During the celebration, the main road of CM Recto is flocked with market-stalls selling affordable items. Also peoples visit the Lipa City Cathedral to attend mass. Houses prepare and serve food to visitors.

<doc id="724910" wikidata="Q338201" url="?curid=724910" title="Hippolytus of Athens">
<text>In Greek mythology, Hippolytus (; ) is the son of Theseus and an Amazon, either Hippolyta or Antiope. His downfall at the hands of Aphrodite is recounted by the playwright Euripides. Other versions of the story have also survived.

== Etymology ==
The meaning of Hippolytus&#x27; name is ironically ambiguous. Ἱππό translates to &#x27;horse&#x27;, and the element -λυτος (from λύω &#x27;loosen, destroy&#x27;) suggests the adjective λυτός, -ή, -όν &#x27;which may be undone, destroyed&#x27;. His name thereby takes on the prophetic meaning &#x27;destroyed by horses&#x27;.

== Premise of the myth ==
Hippolytus is a hunter and sportsman who is disgusted by sex and marriage. In consequence, he scrupulously worships Artemis, the virgin huntress, and refuses to honor Aphrodite. Offended by this neglect, Aphrodite causes Phaedra, Hippolytus’ stepmother, to fall in love with him; Hippolytus rejects Phaedra&#x27;s advances, setting events in motion that lead to his death in a fall from his chariot.

== Hippolytus in Euripides ==
Euripides&#x27; tragedy &quot;Hippolytus&quot; describes the death of the hero after a confrontation with his stepmother Phaedra, the second wife of Theseus. Cursed by Aphrodite, Phaedra falls so ardently in love with Hippolytus that she becomes physically ill and decides to end her suffering through suicide. Her nurse tries to save her by revealing the secret to Hippolytus and encouraging him to reciprocate. Hippolytus responds only with horror and disgust, humiliating Phaedra. In despair, and not wanting to admit the true reason for ending her life, she hangs herself and leaves a note for Theseus accusing his son, Hippolytus, of raping her. Theseus, furious, uses one of the three wishes given to him by Poseidon, his father: Theseus calls on Poseidon to kill Hippolytus, who has fled the palace to go hunting. Poseidon sends a sea-monster to terrorize Hippolytus&#x27; chariot horses, which become uncontrollable and hurl their master out of the vehicle. Entangled in the reins, Hippolytus is dragged to death. Artemis reconciles father and son by telling Theseus that Phaedra&#x27;s accusation against Hippolytus was not true. Artemis comforts the dying Hippolytus with a promise to make him the subject of religious practice so that his memory will live forever. She assigns a band of Trozenian maidens the task of preserving the story of Phaedra and Hippolytus in a ritual song.

Versions of this story also appear in Seneca the Younger&#x27;s play &quot;Phaedra&quot;, Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; and &quot;Heroides&quot;, and Jean Racine&#x27;s &quot;Phèdre&quot;.

===Hippolytus as Virbius and his afterlife ===

Virbius was one of two figures associated with the ancient cult of Diana Nemorensis, the other being Egeria. The nature of his function there remains enigmatic. During a later phase of Hellenization, Virbius was assimilated to the Greek Hippolytus, as a metamorphosis. 

The version presented by Ovid in &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, and by Pausanias, relates a story about Hippolytus that differs from the version presented by Euripides.

Hippolytus was resuscitated by Asclepius; once revived he refused to forgive Theseus, went to Italy, became the king of the Aricians, and named a city after Artemis. He ruled as &quot;Virbius&quot; from inside the shrine of Diana. (The sanctuary forbade horses from entering, which is why it is believed he lived there.) This story of Hippolytus differs from Euripides&#x27; version, in that it brings Hippolytus back from the dead to live his life in Italy, while Euripides permanently connects him to his tomb. Virbius was also identified with the sun god Sol/Helios (Phaedra&#x27;s grandfather).

As a result, a cult grew up around Hippolytus, associated with the cult of Diana. His cult believed that Artemis asked Asclepius to resurrect the young man since he had vowed chastity to her. Followers of Hippolytus&#x27; cult cut off a piece of their hair to dedicate their chastity to him before marriage.

<doc id="724914" wikidata="Q241097" url="?curid=724914" title="Corrie ten Boom">
<text>Cornelia Arnolda Johanna &quot;Corrie&quot; ten Boom (15 April 1892 – 15 April 1983) was a Dutch watchmaker and later a Christian writer and public speaker, who worked with her father, Casper ten Boom, her sister Betsie ten Boom and other family members to help many Jewish people escape from the Nazis during the Holocaust in World War II by hiding them in her home. They were caught, and she was arrested and sent to the Ravensbrück concentration camp. Her most famous book, &quot;The Hiding Place&quot;, is a biography that recounts the story of her family&#x27;s efforts and how she found and shared hope in God while she was imprisoned at the concentration camp.

== Early life ==

Corrie ten Boom was born on 15 April 1892 in Haarlem, Netherlands, the youngest child of Casper ten Boom, a jeweller and watchmaker, and Cornelia (commonly known as &quot;Cor&quot;) Johanna Arnolda, née Luitingh, whom he married in 1884. She was named after her mother but known as Corrie all her life. Corrie had three older siblings: Betsie, Willem, and Nollie. Her three maternal aunts, Tante Bepa, Tante Jans, and Tante Anna, lived with the family. Her father was fascinated by the craft of watchmaking and often became so engrossed in his work that he forgot to charge customers for his services.

The Ten Boom family lived above Casper&#x27;s watch shop in what Corrie called &quot;the Beje&quot; (pronounced bay-yay), a house named for the Barteljorisstraat where they lived. Corrie spent the first part of her life in charge of the housekeeping. However, when a cold sent Betsie, Corrie&#x27;s sister, to bed for an extended period, Corrie took Betsie&#x27;s place and began to work in the family watch shop. She quickly discovered that she loved the &quot;business side&quot; of the watch shop, and she organized the financial proceedings by developing a system of billings and ledgers. Even when Betsie recovered, Corrie kept her place in the shop and Betsie managed the housework, to the delight of them both.

She trained to be a watchmaker herself, and in 1922, she became the first woman to be licensed as a watchmaker in the Netherlands. Over the next decade, in addition to working in her father&#x27;s shop, she established a youth club for teenage girls, which provided religious instruction and classes in the performing arts, sewing, and handicrafts. She and her family were Calvinist Christians in the Dutch Reformed Church, and their faith inspired them to serve their society, which they did by offering shelter, food and money to those who were in need. Some important tenets of their faith included the fact that the Jews were precious to God and that all people are created equal – powerful motivation for the selfless rescue work she would later become involved in.

==World War II==

In May 1940, the Germans invaded the Netherlands. One of their restrictions was the banning of the youth club. In May 1942, a well-dressed woman came to the Ten Booms&#x27; with a suitcase in hand and told them that she was a Jew, her husband had been arrested several months earlier, her son had gone into hiding and Occupation authorities had recently visited her so she was afraid to go back. She heard that the Ten Booms had previously helped their Jewish neighbors, the Weils, and asked if they could help her too. Casper readily agreed that she could stay with them although the police headquarters was only half a block away. A devoted reader of the Old Testament, he believed that the Jews were the &quot;chosen people&quot; and told the woman, &quot;In this household, God&#x27;s people are always welcome.&quot;

Corrie and her sister Betsie opened their home to Jewish refugees and members of the resistance movement, and as a result, they were sought after by the Gestapo and its Dutch counterpart. The refugee work which Ten Boom and her sister did at the Beje became known by the Dutch Resistance, which sent an architect to the Ten Boom home to build a secret hiding place and an alert buzzer that could be used to warn the refugees to get into it as quickly as possible. Thus the Ten Booms created &quot;The Hiding Place&quot; (Dutch: &quot;De Schuilplaats&quot;). The secret room was in Corrie&#x27;s bedroom behind a false wall and would hold 6 people. A ventilation system was installed for the occupants. A buzzer could be heard in the house to warn the refugees to get into the room as quickly as possible during security sweeps through the neighborhood. They had plenty of room, but wartime shortages meant that food was scarce. Every non-Jewish Dutch person had received a ration card, the requirement for obtaining weekly food coupons. Through her charitable work, Ten Boom knew many people in Haarlem and remembered a family with a disabled daughter, whose father was a civil servant who was now in charge of the local ration-card office. She went to his house one evening, and when he asked how many ration cards she needed, &quot;I opened my mouth to say, &#x27;Five,&#x27;&quot; Ten Boom wrote in &quot;The Hiding Place&quot;. &quot;But the number that unexpectedly and astonishingly came out instead was: &#x27;One hundred.&#x27;&quot; He gave them to her and she provided cards to every Jew she met.

Ten Boom&#x27;s involvement in the Dutch resistance grew beyond gathering stolen ration cards and harboring Jews in her home. She soon became part of the Dutch underground resistance network and oversaw a network of smuggling Jews to safe places. All in all, it is estimated that around 800 Jews were saved by Ten Boom&#x27;s efforts.

===Arrest, detention and release===
On 28 February 1944, a Dutch informant, Jan Vogel, told the Nazis about the Ten Booms&#x27; work; at around 12:30 p.m. of that day, the Nazis arrested the entire Ten Boom family. They were sent to Scheveningen Prison when Resistance materials and extra ration cards were found at the home. The group of six people hidden by the Ten Booms, made up of both Jews and resistance workers, remained undiscovered. Though the house was under constant surveillance after Ten Boom&#x27;s arrest, police officers who were also members of the resistance group coordinated the refugees&#x27; escape. Ten Boom received a letter one day in prison, &quot;All the watches in your cabinet are safe,&quot; meaning that the refugees had managed to escape and were safe. On the third day after the raid, resistance workers transferred them to other locations. Altogether, the Gestapo arrested over 30 people who were in the family home that day.

Though the Gestapo soon released most of the 30 people they had captured that day, Corrie, Betsie, and their father Casper were held in prison. Casper died ten days later. Corrie was initially held in solitary confinement. After three months, she was taken to her first hearing. At her trial, Ten Boom spoke about her work with people with mental disabilities; the Nazi lieutenant scoffed because the Nazis had been killing individuals with mental disabilities for years by their eugenics policies. Ten Boom defended her work by saying that in the eyes of God, a mentally disabled person might be more valuable &quot;than a watchmaker. Or a lieutenant.&quot;

Corrie and Betsie were sent from Scheveningen to Herzogenbusch, a political concentration camp (also known as Kamp Vught), and finally to the Ravensbrück concentration camp, a women&#x27;s labor camp in Germany. There, they held worship services after the hard days at work by using a Bible that they had managed to smuggle in. Through the two sisters’ teachings and examples of unfailing charity, many of the prisoners there converted to Christianity. While they were imprisoned at Ravensbruck, Betsie and her sister began to discuss plans for founding a place of healing after the war. Betsie&#x27;s health continued to deteriorate, and she died on 16 December 1944 at the age of 59. Before she died, she told Corrie, &quot;There is no pit so deep that He [God] is not deeper still.&quot; Twelve days later, Corrie was released. Afterward, she was told that her release was because of a clerical error and that a week later, all the women in her age group were sent to the gas chambers.

Ten Boom returned home amid the &quot;hunger winter&quot;. She still opened her doors to people with disabilities who were in hiding for fear of execution.

==Life after the war==
After the war, Ten Boom returned to the Netherlands to set up a rehabilitation center in Bloemendaal. The refuge housed concentration-camp survivors and until 1950 exclusively sheltered jobless Dutch who had collaborated with the Germans during the Occupation, after which it accepted anyone in need of care. She returned to Germany in 1946 and met with and forgave two Germans who had been employed at Ravensbrück, one of whom had been particularly cruel to Betsie. Ten Boom went on to travel the world as a public speaker, appearing in more than 60 countries. She wrote many books during this period.

One of these books is titled &quot;Tramp for the Lord&quot; and was written in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Each chapter tells a short, different story about her world travels and sharing the gospel message in Africa, Europe, the Americas, Asia, and even in difficult-to-reach and dangerous countries such as Russia (then-USSR), Cuba, and China. It features photographs of Ten Boom and her important messages of forgiveness, hope, love, and salvation through the saving grace of Jesus Christ.

Ten Boom told the story of her family members and their World War II work in her bestselling book, &quot;The Hiding Place&quot; (1971), which was made into a 1975 World Wide Pictures film, &quot;The Hiding Place&quot;, starring Jeannette Clift as Corrie and Julie Harris as Betsie. In 1977, the 85-year-old Corrie migrated to Placentia, California. In 1978, she suffered two strokes, the first rendered her unable to speak, and the second resulted in paralysis. She died on her 91st birthday, 15 April 1983, after suffering a third stroke. Ten Boom is buried in Fairhaven Memorial Park in Santa Ana, California.

A sequel film, &quot;Return to the Hiding Place (War of Resistance)&quot;, was released in 2011 in the United Kingdom and in 2013 it was released in the United States. The film was based on Hans Poley&#x27;s book, which painted a broader picture of the circle of which she was a part.

<doc id="724919" wikidata="Q928005" url="?curid=724919" title="Kakutsa Cholokashvili">
<text>Kaikhosro &quot;Kakutsa&quot; Cholokashvili (; ; , &quot;Kaikhosro Chelokayev&quot;; born 14 July 1888 – 27 June 1930) was a Georgian military officer and a commander of an anti-Soviet guerrilla movement in Georgia. He is regarded as a national hero in Georgia.

Born of a noble family, Cholokashvili was a decorated officer of the Imperial Russian Army during World War I. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, he served in the ranks of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. Following the republic&#x27;s overthrow in a Soviet invasion in 1921, Cholokashvili, with a band of followers, took to the mountains and fought a guerrilla campaign against the Soviet government in the province of Kakheti. After a failed August 1924 anti-Soviet rebellion, during which Cholokashvili commanded the largest single rebel contingent, he fled to France, where he died of tuberculosis in 1930. His remains were reburied, in a state funeral, from the Leuville Cemetery near Paris to the Mtatsminda Pantheon in Tbilisi, Georgia, in 2005. In 2013, he was posthumously awarded the title and Order of National Hero of Georgia.

== Early life and career ==
Kakutsa Cholokashvili was born into an aristocratic family of Prince Ioseb Cholokashvili at the family estate at Matani in the eastern Georgian province of Kakheti (then part of the Tiflis Governorate, Russian Empire). The contemporary Russian administrative documents spelled his surname &quot;Челокаев&quot; (Chelokayev). Cholokashvili attended the Gymnasium for Nobility in Tiflis (Tbilisi), which was then directed by the historian Ekvtime Takaishvili. In 1909 he was drafted into the Russian military. He served in the 16th Tver Dragoon Regiment and returned to Georgia with the rank of podporuchik in 1912.

With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Cholokashvili was recalled to active duty and assigned to lead a cavalry squadron on the Austro-Hungarian front. Wounded later that year, he was transferred to the Caucasus Front. During the Battle of Sarikamish in December 1914, he commanded a cavalry squadron under General Vasily Gabashvili and distinguished himself by capturing and defending a strategic fortification known as &quot;the Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot; against the overwhelming Ottoman troops. He was severely wounded and awarded the Gold Sword for Bravery in 1916. After treatment at the St. Nino Hospital in Tiflis, he was enlisted in the nascent Georgian Cavalry Legion which marched into Persia as part of General Baratov&#x27;s 1915–1917 expedition. Shortly thereafter, he was promoted to the rank of podpolkovnik (lieutenant-colonel).

== Independent Georgia ==
After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Cholokashvili returned to Georgia and became involved in Georgia&#x27;s independence movement. He joined the National Democratic Party of Georgia and helped organize national cavalry units early in 1918. After Georgia declared its independence as a Democratic Republic in May 1918, Cholokashvili was put in charge of a squadron in the Cavalry Division of the People&#x27;s Guard of Georgia commanded by Colonel Giorgi Khimshiashvili. In this capacity, Cholokashvili served in the campaigns against Armenia (December 1918 – January 1919), White Russian forces (February–October 1919), pro-Bolshevik rebels in Gori (November–December 1919), and in a raid in the Batumi Oblast (February–March 1920). In April 1920, Cholokashvili and several of his fellow officers were dismissed from service after they protested against what they saw an unjustified dismissal and arrest of their colleague on criminal charges.

When the Soviet Russian Red Army invaded Georgia in February 1921, Cholokashvili was still negotiating his return to the army. He accompanied General David Chavchavadze to western Georgia to recruit volunteers for the Georgian cavalry. By the time they formed two cavalry squadrons and took to the field, Tiflis had fallen and a Soviet republic had been proclaimed in Georgia. In March 1921, the Georgian government and military leadership sailed in European exile; Cholokashvili remained in Georgia.

== Partisan leader ==

As the Soviets pushed for the efforts to consolidate their power in Georgia, an underground opposition movement emerged. In February 1922, Cholokashvili was arrested by the Soviet security agents on charges of &quot;counter-revolutionary activities&quot; in Sighnaghi in his native Kakheti, but he escaped and took to the mountainous Pankisi Valley, where he formed a group of followers known as the Band of Sworn Men (შეფიცულთა რაზმი) and joined the rebellious Khevsur mountaineers. The Bolsheviks used air force and artillery to squash the uprising. With Chechnya as his refuge, Cholokashvili and his guerrillas held out for two years. Revenge killings of the Soviet secret police executioners made him a folk hero.

Foreign diplomats reported that &quot;the affair of Chelokaev&quot; was a source of much trouble for the Bolshevik military leaders. The Soviet officialdom and historians referred to the movement as &quot;political banditry&quot;. In his 1976 study of the Georgian revolt, the Soviet Russian historian Trifonov wrote that &quot;the most numerous and dangerous band was that of Chelokaev. In the fall of 1922 it consisted of about 500 persons.&quot;

In August 1924, Cholokashvili left his mountainous refuge once again to join a larger anti-Soviet uprising in Georgia. He took command of the single largest rebel unit operating in eastern Georgia. Cholokashvili raided the town of Manglisi on 29 August, but, unable to get closer to Tiflis, he withdrew and attacked the Bolsheviks at Dusheti. Hunted down by the Soviet forces, Cholokashvili escaped on several occasions before conceding defeat. In September 1924, he fled across the porous border with Turkey. The Cholokashvili family—his wife and two little daughters—were rounded up and put in jail; his father-in-law was executed. Kakutsa&#x27;s younger brother, Simon, had been killed earlier, during the revolt in Kakheti.

== Emigration ==

After leaving Georgia, Cholokashvili moved from Turkey to France, where many Georgian political émigrés had found refuge. He and his followers settled down at Viroflay, but received a cool welcome from the Leuville-sur-Orge-based Georgian government-in-exile, dominated by the Social-Democrats (Mensheviks). The Mensheviks treated Cholokashvili, a former nobleman, with suspicion, but were eager to exploit his standing among the Georgian nationalists for their political ends. On the other hand, Kakutsa (and many of his fellow military officers such as General Giorgi Kvinitadze) contemned the Mensheviks for their alleged disregard of national interests and indifference to the army. Later in the 1920s, Cholokashvili was close to the right-wing nationalistic organization Tetri Giorgi.

Making use of and contributing to further division among the Georgian émigrés, the Soviet intelligence leadership, especially, Lavrenty Beria, a Georgian, was able to infiltrate the expatriate Georgian community. Beria now targeted Cholokashvili, whose wife and children he held hostage. He even tried to bribe him into making a pro-Soviet recantation, but Cholokashvili demurred. Beria then foisted forged gold coins on Kakutsa and denounced him to the French police in 1927. Cholokashvili was arrested, but acquitted of charges. Cholokashvili was then framed for stealing French War Ministry funds. The Soviet agents also spread rumors that Kakutsa planned to assassinate the exiled Menshevik leaders, Noe Zhordania and Noe Ramishvili. Beria&#x27;s designs were foiled as Kakutsa&#x27;s health rapidly declined; he died of tuberculosis, in 1930, at the Plaz-Coutant sanatorium near Passy, Haute-Savoie.

Cholokashvili was first buried at the Cimetière de Saint-Ouen. He was later reburied to the Leuville Cemetery of Georgian émigrés and, finally, to the Mtatsminda Pantheon in Tbilisi, Georgia&#x27;s capital, in 2005.

== Legacy ==

Under the Soviet rule, Cholokashvili&#x27;s name was expurgated from the Georgian history for several decades. With the rise of nationalist and pro-independence movements in the 1980s, Kakutsa re-emerged as a major symbol of Georgian patriotism and resistance to the Soviet regime. In October 1990, his closest companion and comrade-in-arms, the 94-year-old émigré Aleksandre Sulkhanishvili, returned from his 66-year-long exile to a hero&#x27;s welcome in Tbilisi, bringing Kakutsa&#x27;s banner to Georgia. Sulkhanishvili died less than a month after his return and was buried in his native village.

On 20–21 November 2005, Cholokashvili&#x27;s remains were brought to Georgia and afforded a state funeral, in the presence of high-ranking government and church officials and thousands of Georgians, at the Mtatsminda Pantheon. In 2007, Cholokashvili&#x27;s portrait was depicted on Georgia&#x27;s new 200-lari banknote. The same year, Tbilisi&#x27;s Marjanishvili Theatre staged Levan Tsuladze&#x27;s successful production of &quot;Kakutsa Cholokashvili&quot;, an epic patriotic play by Guram Qartvelishvili.

<text>Daf Yomi (, &quot;Daf Yomi&quot;, &quot;page of the day&quot; or &quot;daily &quot;) is a daily regimen of learning the Oral Torah and its commentaries (also known as the Gemara), in which each of the 2,711 pages of the Babylonian Talmud is covered in sequence. A &quot;daf&quot;, or &quot;blatt&quot; in Yiddish, consists of both sides of the page. Under this regimen, the entire Talmud is completed, one day at a time, in a cycle of approximately seven and a half years. As of today, , the study is of Tractate .

Tens of thousands of Jews worldwide study in the Daf Yomi program, and over 300,000 participate in the Siyum HaShas, an event celebrating the culmination of the cycle of learning. The Daf Yomi program has been credited with making Talmud study accessible to Jews who are not Torah scholars, contributing to Jewish continuity after the Holocaust, and having a unifying factor among Jews. Each day of the daily calendar, including Tisha B&#x27;Av, is included, and online audio versions of lectures are available.

== Origin ==
The novel idea of Jews in all parts of the world studying the same &quot;daf&quot; each day, with the goal of completing the entire Talmud, was first proposed in a World Agudath Israel publication in December 1920 (Kislev 5681) &quot;Digleinu&quot;, the voice of Zeirei Agudath Israel, by Rabbi Moshe Menachem Mendel Spivak, and was put forth at the First World Congress of Agudath Israel which took place in Vienna starting from Elul 3, 5683 / August 15, 1923 and which lasted for ten days. The proposal for the study of Daf Hayomi was made on Elul 7 or 9, 5683 (August 19 or 21, 1923) by Meir Shapiro, then rabbi of Sanok, Poland, and future rosh yeshiva of Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin and the resolution was adopted on Elul 10, 5683. In those years, only some of the 63 tractates of the Talmud were being studied regularly, such as &quot;Berachot&quot;, &quot;Shabbat&quot;, and &quot;Eruvin&quot;, which deal with practical laws, while others, such as &quot;Zevachim&quot; and &quot;Temurah&quot;, were hardly studied. Shapiro also viewed the program as a way to unify the Jewish people. As he explained to the Congress delegates:

What a great thing! A Jew travels by boat and takes gemara &quot;Berachot&quot; under his arm. He travels for 15 days from Eretz Yisrael to America, and each day he learns the &quot;daf&quot;. When he arrives in America, he enters a &quot;beis medrash&quot; in New York and finds Jews learning the very same &quot;daf&quot; that he studied on that day, and he gladly joins them. Another Jew leaves the States and travels to Brazil or Japan, and he first goes to the &quot;beis medrash&quot;, where he finds everyone learning the same &quot;daf&quot; that he himself learned that day. Could there be greater unity of hearts than this?

Originally, Shapiro saw Daf Yomi as an obligation only for the religious youth of Poland. However, the idea was greeted enthusiastically by the nearly 600 delegates at the Congress, including many Torah leaders from Europe and America, who accepted it as a universal obligation for all Jews.

The first cycle of Daf Yomi commenced on the first day of Rosh Hashanah 5684 (11 September 1923), with tens of thousands of Jews in Europe, America and Israel learning the first &quot;daf&quot; of the first tractate of the Talmud, &quot;Berachot&quot;. To show support for the idea, the Gerrer rebbe, Avraham Mordechai Alter, learned the first &quot;daf&quot; of &quot;Berachot&quot; in public on that day. On 12 November 1923 Tractate &quot;Berachot&quot; was completed, with small &quot;siyums&quot; (celebrations marking the completion of study of a Talmudic tractate) in local communities. At that time, Shapiro published a calendar for the entire cycle of Daf Yomi study. (For the first seven cycles, there were only 2,702 pages of Talmud on the schedule; later the Daf Yomi Commission of Agudath Israel increased it to 2,711, changing the edition used for Tractate Shekalim, taken from the Jerusalem Talmud, to one with more pages.) The siyum for the completion of Tractate &quot;Pesachim&quot; took place after the laying of the cornerstone for Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin. At that time, Shapiro conceived the idea of contributing daily &quot;groschen&quot; to help raise money for the building. Each day, each person who studied Daf Yomi was asked to set aside a &quot;grosh&quot; (a Polish penny), and at the end of the tractate, to donate the sum to the yeshiva.

The Second World Congress of the World Agudath Israel, held in 1929, coincided with the completion of Tractate &quot;Zevachim&quot;.

The 1st Siyum HaShas took place on 2 February 1931 (15 Shevat 5691) in several cities in Europe and in Jerusalem, with the main venue being the newly opened Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin in Lublin, Poland. Tens of thousands of Jews attended these events. Shapiro presided over the Siyum in his yeshiva in the presence of many leaders of Polish Jewry. In the United States, Siyums were held in Baltimore and Philadelphia.

==Siyum HaShas==

The completion of the Daf Yomi cycle is celebrated in an event known as the Siyum HaShas (&quot;completion of the &quot;Shas&quot;&quot;). In America, the main Siyum HaShas is organized by the Agudath Israel of America. Attendance at each successive recent Siyum HaShas has grown. In 1997 the 10th Siyum HaShas was celebrated by some 70,000 participants in the U.S.; at the 11th Siyum HaShas in 2005, participation had grown to 120,000 in the U.S. and 300,000 around the world.

The 12th Siyum HaShas in America was held on August 1, 2012, at the MetLife Stadium at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey, which has capacity for over 90,000 attendees. All seats were sold out. Satellite broadcasts were piped to many other locations, including Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin in Poland. Tens of thousands attended celebrations in Israel.

The 13th Siyum HaShas on January 1, 2020, returned to MetLife Stadium, to a capacity crowd.

==Process==

===Process===
With 2,711 pages in the Talmud, one Daf Yomi cycle takes about 7 years, 5 months. The completion of each tractate is typically celebrated with a small siyum, and the completion of the entire cycle is celebrated at an event known as the Siyum HaShas.

Daf Yomi can be studied alone, with a &quot;chavruta&quot; (study partner), in a daily &quot;shiur&quot; (class) led by a rabbi or teacher, via a telephone &quot;shiur&quot;, CD-ROM, or audio and online resources. Typically, Daf Yomi &quot;shiurim&quot; are held in synagogues, yeshivas, and offices. They also take place in the United States Senate, Wall Street board rooms, and on the Long Island Rail Road, in the last car of two commuter trains departing Far Rockaway at 7:51 am and 8:15 am, respectively, for Manhattan. Daf Yomi &quot;shiurim&quot; are piped into the in-flight sound system of all El Al flights. A typical Daf Yomi &quot;shiur&quot; lasts one hour. Participants typically study the text with only the most basic commentary, that of Rashi, but some &quot;shiurim&quot; are more elaborate.

===Learning resources===
The Schottenstein Edition of the Babylonian Talmud, an English-language translation and interpretation published in 73 volumes between 1990 and 2004 by ArtScroll, has been credited with significantly increasing the number of English speakers participating in the Daf Yomi program. ArtScroll planned the publication of each tractate to coincide with its study in the Daf Yomi cycle, releasing the final volume to coincide with the 11th Siyum HaShas in 2005. The Schottenstein Talmud was also translated into Hebrew. ArtScroll released in 2012 a mobile app that contained the entire Babylonian Talmud.

The Koren Talmud Bavli by Koren Publishers offers the Vilna Daf along with a bilingual section (English-Aramaic) with color maps, images, and extensive historical, scientific, biographical, and linguistic notes by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz. To facilitate comprehension and reading fluency, the Aramaic text and Rashi commentary feature punctuation and vowels, and the text is fully annotated. The Koren Talmud Bavli with Rabbi Steinsaltz&#x27;s commentary has been credited with opening access to Talmud study for Jews of all backgrounds.

The Dafyomi Advancement Forum, founded by Kollel Iyun Hadaf in 1996, is a free resource center offering English-language translations, outlines, charts, analyses and lectures on every &quot;daf&quot;, as well as answers to any question by email.

Meoros HaDaf HaYomi, founded in 1999, disseminates a weekly Daf Yomi study sheet in both Hebrew and English via email and regular mail. This organization also trains Daf Yomi teachers in its battei medrash (study halls) in Bnei Brak and Jerusalem. It has recorded &quot;shiurim&quot; on the &quot;daf&quot; on CD-ROM in English, Hebrew, Yiddish, and French.

Real Clear Daf is a popular online resource founded in 2012 that offers free daily audio lectures on the entire Talmud according to the Daf Yomi cycle. Led by Talmudic scholar and teacher Shmuel Wise, Real Clear Daf places a special emphasis on word economy, using just the right amount of words for a crystal clear understanding of each page of the Talmud. The lectures are known for their engaging and accessible style, making them a valuable resource for both beginner and advanced students of the Talmud. The mobile app offers a dynamic highlighter that highlights the words of the Daf as they are explained.

Additional resources to assist those endeavoring to complete the cycle for the first time are a range of audiotapes, online websites, and iPods preloaded with lectures covering every page of the Talmud.

Since spring 2019, Dr. Henry Abramson of Touro College has been posting brief videos describing the historical context of each daf as part of the Orthodox Union Daf Yomi Initiative.

Talmudic study by women has never been forbidden, but was discouraged. Modern technology has led to increased accessibility for women. For example, Michelle Cohen, an Orthodox scholar, teaches Daf Yomi to women in her home and through a podcast in English and Hebrew.

==Influence==
Soon after its introduction, Daf Yomi inspired the founding of other &quot;Yomi&quot; (Daily) study programs for key texts of Judaism. These include &quot;Mishnah Yomis&quot; (the daily study of Mishnah), &quot;Nach Yomi&quot; (the daily study of Nevi&#x27;im and Ketuvim), and &quot;Mussar Yomi&quot; (the daily study of Mussar literature). In 1980 Simcha Bunim Alter introduced &quot;Yerushalmi Yomi&quot;, a daily schedule for completing the entire Jerusalem Talmud. Dirshu introduced &quot;Mishnah Berurah Yomi&quot;, a daily learning plan which completes the entire work by Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan in seven years. 
In 2018, Eli Stefansky founded the Mercaz Daf Yomi (MDY) in Ramat Beit Shemesh, from which he broadcasts daily lectures of the &quot;daf yomi&quot;. As of 2023, the daily lectures received between 16,000 and 18,000 viewers, making its the most popular &quot;shiur&quot; in the world. He spends an estimated 14 hours per day to prepare for his lectures.

<text>Basava (1131–1196), also called &#x27; and &#x27;, was an Indian philosopher, poet, Lingayat social reformer in the Shiva-focused bhakti movement, and a Hindu Shaivite social reformer during the reign of the Kalyani Chalukya/Kalachuri dynasty. Basava was active during the rule of both dynasties but reached the peak of his influence during the rule of King Bijjala II in Karnataka, India.

Basava spread social awareness through his poetry, popularly known as &quot;Vachanaas&quot;. He rejected gender or social discrimination, superstitions and rituals but introduced &quot;Ishtalinga&quot; necklace, with an image of the lingam, to every person regardless of their birth, to be a constant reminder of one&#x27;s bhakti (devotion) to Shiva. A strong promoter of ahimsa, he also condemned human and animal sacrifices. As the chief minister of his kingdom, he introduced new public institutions such as the &quot;Anubhava Mantapa&quot; (or, the &quot;hall of spiritual experience&quot;), which welcomed men and women from all socio-economic backgrounds to discuss spiritual and mundane questions of life, in open.

The traditional legends and hagiographic texts state Basava to be the founder of the Lingayats. However, modern scholarship relying on historical evidence such as the Kalachuri inscriptions state that Basava was the poet philosopher who revived, refined and energized an already existing tradition. The &quot;Basavarajadevara Ragale&quot; (13 out of 25 sections are available) by the Kannada poet Harihara () is the earliest available account on the life of the social reformer and is considered important because the author was a near contemporary of his protagonist. A full account of Basava&#x27;s life and ideas are narrated in a 13th-century sacred Telugu text, the &quot;Basava Purana&quot; by Palkuriki Somanatha.

Basava literary works include the Vachana Sahitya in Kannada Language. He is also known as Bhaktibhandari () and Basavanna.

==Early life==
Basava was born in 1131 CE in the town of Basavana Bagewadi in the northern part of Karnataka, to Maadhavarasa and Madalambike, a Kannada Orthodox Brahmin family devoted to the Hindu deity Shiva. He was named Basava, a Kannada form of the Sanskrit &quot;Vrishabha&quot; in honor of Nandi bull (carrier of Shiva) and the local Shaivism tradition.

Basava grew up in Kudalasangama (northwest Karnataka), near the banks of rivers Krishna and its tributary Malaprabha. Basava spent twelve years studying in the Hindu temple in the town of Kudalasangama, at Sangameshwara then a Shaivite school of learning, probably of the &quot;Lakulisha-Pashupata&quot; tradition.

Basava married Gangambike, a cousin from his mother&#x27;s side. Her father was the provincial prime minister of Bijjala, the Kalachuri king. He began working as an accountant to the court of the king. When his maternal uncle died, the king invited him to be the chief minister. The king also married Basava&#x27;s sister named Nagamma.

As chief minister of the kingdom, Basava used the state treasury to initiate social reforms and religious movement focussed on reviving Shaivism, recognizing and empowering ascetics who were called Jangamas. One of the innovative institutions he launched in the 12th century was the &quot;Anubhava Mantapa&quot;, a public assembly and gathering that attracted men and women across various walks of life from distant lands to openly discuss spiritual, economic and social issues of life. He composed poetry in local language, and spread his message to the masses. His teachings and verses such as &quot;Káyakavé Kailása&quot; (Work is the path to &quot;Kailasa&quot; [bliss, heaven], or work is worship) became popular.

==Literary works==

Several works are attributed to Basava, which are revered in the Veerashaiva Lingayat community. These include various &quot;Vachana&quot; such as the &quot;Shat-sthala-vachana&quot; (discourses of the six stages of salvation), &quot;Kala-jnana-vachana&quot; (forecasts of the future), &quot;Mantra-gopya&quot;, &quot;Ghatachakra-vachana&quot; and &quot;Raja-yoga-vachana&quot;.

===Hagiography===
The &quot;Basava Purana&quot;, a Telugu biographical epic poem, first written by Palkuriki Somanatha in 13th-century, and an updated 14th century Kannada version, written by Bhima Kavi in 1369, are sacred texts in Veerashaiva Lingayat.

Other hagiographic works include the 15th-century &quot;Mala Basava-raja-charitre&quot; and the 17th-century &quot;Vrishabhendra Vijaya&quot;, both in Kannada.

===Authenticity===
Scholars state that the poems and legends about Basava were written down long after his death. This has raised questions about the accuracy and creative interpolation by authors who were not direct witness but derived their work relying on memory, legends, and hearsay of others. Michael states, &quot;All &#x27;Vachana&#x27;collections as they exist at present are probably much later than the 15th-century [300 years post-Basava]. Much critical labor needs to be spent in determining the authenticity of portions of these collections&quot;.

==Philosophy==
Basava grew up in a Shaivite family. As a leader, he developed and inspired a new devotional movement named &quot;Virashaivas&quot;, or &quot;ardent, heroic worshippers of Shiva&quot;. This movement shared its roots in the ongoing Tamil Bhakti movement, particularly the Shaiva Nayanars traditions, over the 7th- to 11th-century. However, Basava championed devotional worship that rejected temple worship and rituals led by Brahmins and replaced it with personalized direct worship of Shiva through practices such as individually worn icons and symbols like a small linga. This approach brought Shiva&#x27;s presence to everyone and at all times, without gender, class or caste discrimination. Basava&#x27;s poem, such as Basavanna 703, speak of strong sense of gender equality and community bond, willing to wage war for the right cause, yet being a fellow &quot;devotees&#x27; bride&quot; at the time of their need.

A recurring contrast in his poems and ideas is of &quot;Sthavara&quot; and &quot;Jangama&quot;, that is, of &quot;what is static, standing&quot; and &quot;what is moving, seeking&quot; respectively. Temples, ancient books represented the former, while work and discussion represented the latter.

Basava emphasized constant personal spiritual development as the path to profound enlightenment. He championed the use of vernacular language, Kannada, in all spiritual discussions so that translation and interpretation by the elite is unnecessary, and everyone can understand the spiritual ideas. His approach is akin to the protestant movement, states Ramanuja. His philosophy revolves around treating one&#x27;s own body and soul as a temple; instead of making a temple, he suggests being the temple. His trinity consisted of &quot;guru&quot; (teacher), &quot;linga&quot; (personal symbol of Shiva) and &quot;jangama&quot; (constantly moving and learning).

Basava established, in 12th-century, &quot;Anubhava Mantapa&quot;, a hall for gathering and discussion of spiritual ideas by any member of the society from both genders, where ardent devotees of Shiva shared their achievements and spiritual poems in the local language. He questioned rituals, dualism, and externalization of god, and stated that the true God is &quot;one with himself, self-born&quot;.

While Basava rejected rituals, he encouraged icons and symbols such as the wearing of &quot;Istalinga&quot; (necklace with personal linga, symbol of Shiva), of Rudraksha seeds or beads on parts of one body, and apply &quot;Vibhuti&quot; (sacred ash on forehead) as a constant reminder of one&#x27;s devotion and principles of faith. Another aid to faith, he encouraged was the six-syllable mantra, &quot;Shivaya Namah&quot;, or the &quot;shadhakshara mantra&quot; which is &quot;Om Namah Shivaya&quot;.

===Bhakti marga as the path to liberation===
The Basava Purana, in Chapter 1, presents a series of impassioned debates between Basava and his father. Both declare Hindu Sruti and Smriti to be sources of valid knowledge, but they disagree on the &quot;marga&quot; (path) to liberated, righteous life. Basava&#x27;s father favors the tradition of rituals, while Basava favors the path of direct, personal devotion (bhakti).

According to Velcheru Rao and Gene Roghair, Basava calls the path of devotion as &quot;beyond six systems of philosophy. Sruti has commended it as the all-seeing. the beginning of the beginning. The form of that divine linga is the true God. The &quot;guru&quot; [teacher] of the creed is an embodiment of kindness and compassion. He places God in your soul, and he also places God in your hand. The six-syllabled mantra, the supreme mantra, is its mantra. The dress – locks of hair, ashes and rudrashaka beads – place a man beyond the cycle of birth and death. It follows the path of liberation. (...) This path offers nothing less than liberation in this lifetime.&quot;

===Roots in the Vedanta philosophy===
Sripati, a Virasaiva scholar, explained Basava&#x27;s philosophy in &quot;Srikara Bhasya&quot;, using the Vedanta Sutra, suggesting Basava&#x27;s Lingayat theology to be a form of qualified nondualism, wherein the individual Atma (soul) is the body of God, and that there is no difference between Shiva and Atma(self, soul), Shiva is one&#x27;s Atma, one&#x27;s Atma is Shiva. Sripati&#x27;s analysis places Basava&#x27;s views in Vedanta school, in a form closer to the 11th century Vishishtadvaita philosopher Ramanuja, than to Advaita philosopher Adi Shankara. However, Sripati&#x27;s analysis has been contested in the Virasaiva community.

==Legacy and influence==

Modern scholarship relying on historical evidence such as the Kalachuri inscriptions state that Basava was the 12th-century poet-philosopher who revived and energized an already existing tradition. The community he helped form is also known as the &quot;Sharanas&quot;. The community is largely concentrated in Karnataka, but has migrated into other states of India as well as overseas. Towards the end of the 20th century, Michael estimates, one-sixth of the population of the state of Karnataka, or about 10 million people, were Veerashaiva Lingayat or of the tradition championed by Basava. Veerashaiva Lingayat constitutes around 17% of Karnataka&#x27;s population and has dominance over 100 out of 223 constituencies. Among the total of 23 chief ministers that Karnataka had since 1952, 10 were from Lingayat community.

===Social reform===

Basava taught that every human being was equal, irrespective of caste, and that all forms of manual labor was equally important. Michael states that it wasn&#x27;t birth but behavior that determined a true saint and Shaiva bhakta in the view of Basava and the &quot;Sharanas&quot; community. This, writes Michael, was also the position of south Indian man, that it was &quot;behavior, not birth&quot; that determines the true man. One difference between the two was that Sharanas welcomed anyone, whatever occupation he or she might have been born in, to convert and be reborn into the larger family of Shiva devotees and then adopt any occupation he or she wanted. Basava insisted on ahimsa or non-violence and vehemently condemned all forms of sacrifices, human or animal.

===Synthesis of diverse Hindu traditions===
Basava is credited with uniting diverse spiritual trends during his era. Jan Peter Schouten states that &quot;Virashaivism&quot;, the movement championed by Basava, tends towards monotheism with Shiva as the godhead, but with a strong awareness of the unity of the Ultimate Reality. Schouten calls this as a synthesis of Ramanuja&#x27;s Vishishtadvaita and Shankara&#x27;s Advaita traditions, naming it &quot;Shakti-Vishishtadvaita&quot;, that is monism fused with Shakti beliefs. An individual&#x27;s spiritual progress is viewed by Basava&#x27;s tradition as a six-stage &quot;Satsthalasiddhanta&quot;, which progressively evolves the individual through phase of the devotee, to phase of the master, then phase of the receiver of grace, thereafter Linga in life-breath (god dwells in their soul), the phase of surrender (awareness of no distinction in god and soul, self), to the last stage of complete union of soul and god (liberation, mukti). Basava&#x27;s approach is different from Adi Shankara, states Schouten, in that Basava emphasizes the path of devotion, compared to Shankara&#x27;s emphasis on the path of knowledge – a system of monistic Advaita philosophy widely discussed in Karnataka in the time of Basava.

Jessica Frazier et al. state that Basava laid the foundations of a movement that united &quot;Vedic with Tantric practice, and Advaitic monism with effusive Bhakti devotionalism.&quot;

===Icons and symbols===
Basava advocated the wearing of &quot;Ishtalinga&quot;, a necklace with pendant that contains a small Shiva linga. He was driven by his realization; in one of his Vachanas he says &quot;Arive Guru&quot;, which means one&#x27;s own awareness is his/her teacher. Many contemporary Vachanakaras (people who have scripted Vachanas) have described him as &quot;Swayankrita Sahaja&quot;, which means &quot;self-made&quot;.

==Monuments and recognition==

<text>The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) is an international agricultural research and training organization with its headquarters in Los Baños, Laguna, in the Philippines, and offices in seventeen countries. IRRI is known for its work in developing rice varieties that contributed to the Green Revolution in the 1960s which preempted the famine in Asia.

The institute, established in 1960 aims to reduce poverty and hunger, improve the health of rice farmers and consumers, and ensure environmental sustainability of rice farming. It advances its mission through collaborative research, partnerships, and the strengthening of the national agricultural research and extension systems of the countries IRRI works in.

IRRI is one of 15 agricultural research centers in the world that form the CGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers, a global partnership of organizations engaged in research on food security. It is also the largest non-profit agricultural research center in Asia.

==Origins==
IRRI was established in 1960 with the support of the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Government of the Philippines.

An International treaty titled: &quot;Agreement Recognising the International Legal Personality of the International Rice Research Institute&quot; was tabled in Manila on .

==Impact==
IRRI is well known for its contribution to the &quot;Green Revolution&quot; movement in Asia during the late 1960s and 1970s, which involved the breeding of &quot;semi-dwarf&quot; varieties of rice that were less likely to lodge (fall over). IRRI&#x27;s semi-dwarf varieties, including the famous IR8, saved India from famine in the 1960s. The varieties developed at IRRI, known as IR varieties, are well accepted in many Asian countries. In 2005, it was estimated that 60% of the world&#x27;s rice area was planted to IRRI-bred rice varieties or their progenies.

A report published by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research in 2011 assessed the impact of IRRI&#x27;s breeding work in three countries in South East Asia between 1985 and 2009. It found IRRI&#x27;s breeding work delivered an annual benefit of US$1.46 billion and boosted rice yields up to 13%.

IRRI, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and BGI (formerly known as the Beijing Genomics Institute) have &quot;identified the exact genetic makeup of more than 3,000 different families of rice for the first time in what is being heralded as a major advancement in rice science.&quot;

For five decades, IRRI has provided a place for scientists and future leaders in rice research to learn. Since 1964, over 15,000 scientists have undergone training at IRRI to conduct rice research.

==Golden rice==
IRRI is pursuing the development of &quot;golden rice&quot;. Geneticists inserted two genes into the rice plant that allows it to produce beta carotene, which makes its grains yellow. Because the human body converts beta carotene to vitamin A, golden rice has the potential to dramatically improve the lives of millions of people around the world, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia, where vitamin A deficiency is an especially common malady that can cause blindness and increases the risk of death from disease. Children are particularly vulnerable; according to the World Health Organization, &quot;An estimated 250,000 to 500,000 vitamin A-deficient children become blind every year, half of them dying within 12 months of losing their sight&quot;. In August 2013, anti-genetically modified organism protestors broke into IRRI&#x27;s research facilities and destroyed field trials of golden rice.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports IRRI in its development of golden rice.

==Research==

IRRI&#x27;s website states that their research themes consist of:

Additionally, the organisation describes their expertise as including:

conserving, understanding, sharing, and using rice genetic diversity; breeding and delivering new varieties; developing and sharing improved crop and environmental management practices; adding to the economic and nutritional value of rice; broadening our impact by supporting strategic policy and market development; and facilitating large-scale adoption of technologies.

In 2010, the Global Rice Science Partnership (GRiSP) was launched, which IRRI leads in Asia, the Africa Rice Center (AfricaRice) leads in Africa, and International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) leads in Latin America. It aims to &quot;dramatically improve the ability of rice farmers to feed growing populations in some of the world&#x27;s poorest nations&quot;.
==Awards==
In 1969, IRRI was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding. The Ramon Magsaysay Award is an annual award was established in 1957 by the trustees of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund based in New York City, with the concurrence of the Philippine government, to &quot;perpetuate former Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay&#x27;s example of integrity in governance, courageous service to the people, and pragmatic idealism within a democratic society&quot;. This award is Asia&#x27;s highest honor and widely regarded as the Asian equivalent to the Nobel Prize. The Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation posited that IRRI represented &quot;the first coordinated international attempt in the tropics to solve a major problem of world agriculture&quot;, while also stating:

Distilling more than three millennia of accumulated insight in cultivating man&#x27;s leading cereal crop, the International Rice Research Institute, with its creation of &quot;miracle rice&quot;, inaugurated a &quot;green revolution&quot;, promising nearly one-half of humanity the prospect of suffficiency in its staple food.

Additionally, IRRI received the 2010 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the category of Development Cooperation. This was awarded for the organization&#x27;s contribution to &quot;reducing poverty and hunger in the world by means of rice research and farmer training&quot;, and &quot;for the quality of its research work, which has led to the development of new rice varieties adapted to different cropping areas in Asia and providing improved yield and sustainability across multiple climate regimes&quot;. IRRI was nominated for the award by Japan&#x27;s National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies. The award jury also pointed to:

IRRI&#x27;s success in transferring the results of its research, by working with local teams and organizations in Asian and sub-Saharan countries and making its varieties freely available to farmers. By this means, the IRRI has secured the effective dissemination of its innovations with the resultant increase in production of this basic crop.
==Transportation==
There are scheduled shuttle buses (mainly for employees and quantity depend on the timing, usually only one) that move back and forth from the UPLB campus to the IRRI lobby and three other buildings for free.

==Facilities==
IRRI&#x27;s headquarters in the Philippines is located on a experimental farm with modern laboratories and glasshouses, and a training center. The land is owned by the University of the Philippines Los Baños and is leased to the institute. It also houses the International Rice Genebank and Riceworld Museum. The holds more than 127,000 accessions of rice and wild relatives and is the biggest collection of rice genetic diversity in the world. The (INGER) was created by IRRI in 1975 as the International Rice Testing Program IRTP. INGER accepts accessions and then holds, multiplies, and distributes them to researchers without restriction, including restriction on commercial use.

<text>A tiller or till is a lever used to steer a vehicle. The mechanism is primarily used in watercraft, where it is attached to an outboard motor, rudder post or stock to provide leverage in the form of torque for the helmsman to turn the rudder. A tiller may also be used in vehicles outside of water, and was seen in early automobiles.

On vessels, a tiller can be used by the helmsman directly pulling or pushing it, but it may also be moved remotely using tiller lines or a ship&#x27;s wheel. Rapid or excessive movement of the tiller results in an increase in drag and will result in braking or slowing the boat.

== Description ==
A tiller is a lever used to steer a vehicle. It provides leverage in the form of torque to turn the device that changes the direction of the vehicle, such as a rudder on a watercraft or the surface wheels on a wheeled vehicle. A tiller can be used by directly pulling or pushing it, but it may also be moved remotely using a whipstaff, tiller lines, or a ship&#x27;s wheel, among other variations. (For example, some kayaks have foot pedals that turn a tiller.) Tillers on outboard motors often employ an additional control mechanism where twisting of the shaft is used to vary speed.

== Watercraft ==

=== Rudder control ===
In watercraft, the tiller may be attached to a rudder post (American terminology) or rudder stock (English terminology) that provides leverage in the form of torque to turn the rudder. In steering a boat, the tiller is always moved in the direction opposite of which the bow of the boat is to move. If the tiller is moved to port side (left), the bow will turn to starboard (right). If the tiller is moved to starboard (right), the bow will turn port (left). Sailing students often learn the alliterative phrase &quot;Tiller Towards Trouble&quot; to remind them of how to steer. Rapid or excessive movement of the tiller results in an increase in drag and will result in braking or slowing the boat. In the early 1500s the tiller was also referred to as the steering stick.

=== Engine control ===
Some outboard motors may instead have the tiller directly attached and offer controls for engine throttle and prop rotation for forward and reverse.

===Tiller orders===

Until the current international standards for giving steering orders were defined by the SOLAS Convention of 1929, it was common for steering orders on ships to be given as &quot;Tiller Orders&quot;, which dictated to which side of the vessel the tiller was to be moved. Since the tiller is forward of the rudder&#x27;s pivot point, and the rudder aft of it, the tiller&#x27;s movement is reversed at the rudder, giving the impression that orders were given &quot;the wrong way round&quot;. For example, to turn a ship to port (its left side), the helmsman would be given the order &quot;starboard helm&quot; or &quot;&quot;x&quot; degrees starboard&quot;. The ship&#x27;s tiller was then moved to starboard, turning the rudder to the vessel&#x27;s port side, producing a turn to port. The opposite convention applied in France (where &quot;tribord&quot;—starboard—meant turn to starboard), but Austria and Italy kept to the English system. There was no standardisation in vessels from Scandinavian countries, where the practice varied from ship to ship. Most French vessels with steering wheels had their steering chains reversed and when under the command of a British pilot this could result in confusion.

When large steamships appeared in the late 19th century with telemotors hydraulically connecting the wheel on the bridge to the steering gear at the stern, the practice continued. However, the helmsman was now no longer directly controlling the tiller, and the ship&#x27;s wheel was simply turned in the desired direction (turn the wheel to port and the ship will go to port). Tiller Orders remained however; although many maritime nations had abandoned the convention by the end of the 19th century, Britain retained it until 1933 and the U.S. merchant marine until 1935. One of the reasons for this system continuing, apart from it being a long-established maritime tradition, was that it provided consistency—regardless of whether a vessel was steered directly by the tiller or remotely by a wheel, every vessel had a tiller of some sort and so a tiller order remained true for any vessel. During the transition period the wording of the order was changed, to specify &quot;Wheel to starboard&quot; or &quot;Wheel to port&quot;.

A well-known and often-depicted example occurred on the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912 just before she collided with an iceberg. When the iceberg appeared directly in front of the ship, her officer-of-the-watch, First Officer William Murdoch, decided to attempt to clear the iceberg by swinging the ship to its port side. He ordered &quot;Hard-a-Starboard&quot;, which was a Tiller Order directing the helmsman to turn the wheel to port (anti-clockwise) as far as it would go. The &quot;Titanic&quot;&#x27;s steering gear then pushed the tiller toward the starboard side of the ship, swinging the rudder over to port and causing the vessel to turn to port. These actions are faithfully portrayed in the 1997 film of the disaster. Although frequently described as an error, the order was given and executed correctly—the vessel struck the iceberg anyway. However, according to the granddaughter of the highest-ranking officer to survive the sinking, Second Officer Charles Lightoller, the order was not correctly executed. Quartermaster Hitchins, who had been trained under Rudder Orders, mistakenly turned the wheel to starboard. It took two minutes to recognise and correct the error, by which time it was too late to avoid collision with the iceberg. Louise Patten makes the statement in an endnote to her fictional story, &quot;Good as Gold&quot;.

Although this system seems confusing and contradictory today, to generations of sailors trained on sailing vessels with tiller steering it seemed perfectly logical and was understood by all seafarers. Only when new generations of sailors trained on ships with wheel-and-tiller steering came into the industry was the system replaced.

==Other vehicles==

=== Landcraft ===
The first automobiles were steered with a tiller, which angled the wheels to steer the vehicle. A steering wheel was first used in Europe in 1894 and became standard on French Panhard cars in 1898. Arthur Constantin Krebs replaced the tiller with an inclined steering wheel for the Panhard &amp; Levassor car he designed for the Paris-Amsterdam race which ran from 7–13 July 1898. In the US, Packard introduced a steering wheel on the second car they built, in 1899. By early in the next century, the steering wheel had nearly replaced the tiller in automobiles. However, some automobiles still used tillers into the teens, such as Rauch &amp; Lang Carriage Co., a manufacturer of electric automobiles in Cleveland, Ohio. Lanchester in England also offered tiller steering later than many car manufacturers.

Today, tractor-drawn semi-trailers for ladder trucks are called tiller truck and use a &quot;tiller&quot; (rear steering axle) driver to control the trailer where the aerial ladder is located. Some recumbent bicycles employ tiller steering. The tiller of the electric threewheeler TWIKE – called &quot;Joystick&quot; – includes buttons for acceleration and electric braking. Mobility scooters are usually fitted with a tiller.

=== Aircraft ===
Most large, transport category airplanes use a device known as a tiller to steer the airplane while taxiing. This usually takes the form of a small steering wheel or lever in the cockpit, often one for the pilot and one for the co-pilot. However, they differ from the tiller on a ship. Rather than move the rudder, the tiller on an airplane steers by turning the nose wheel, and the tiller is moved in the direction of the turn, rather than opposite the turn as on a ship.

<doc id="724931" wikidata="Q4047860" url="?curid=724931" title="RISC iX">
<text>RISC iX is a discontinued Unix operating system designed to run on a series of workstations based on the Acorn Archimedes microcomputer. Heavily based on 4.3BSD, it was initially completed in 1988, a year after Arthur but before RISC OS. It was introduced in the ARM2-based R140 workstation in 1989, followed up by the ARM3-based R200-series workstations in 1990.

== Features ==

Acorn chose BSD 4.3 as the basis for RISC iX due to its academic origins, these being considered as making the software more appropriate for Acorn&#x27;s principal target market of tertiary education. SunOS and NeXTSTEP systems were given as examples of other &quot;modern high-performance workstations that use BSD&quot;. Other reasons for choosing BSD included better integration of networking and connectivity tools in comparison to System V.

* X11 (initially Release 2) with Ardent Window Manager, Tab Window Manager and Ultrix Window Manager available by default, plus X.desktop from IXI Limited
* System V virtual memory extensions, compatible with the &quot;System V Interface Definition&quot;
* C Compiler with ANSI C and Portable C Compiler (pcc) (Berkeley) compatibility
* Sun Microsystems Network File System version 3.2
* ARM assembly language

Although Acorn had licensed Sun Microsystems&#x27; NeWS in 1987, broad industry adoption of the X Window System, including Sun&#x27;s belated endorsement, resulted in X11 technologies featuring in RISC iX. RISC iX 1.2 upgraded the X11 server to release 4, and was certified to conform to the X/Open Portability Guide 3 Base profile.

Peculiarly, the system console featured a two-cursor text copying mechanism inspired by Acorn&#x27;s own earlier 8-bit range including the BBC Micro. One reason given for the inclusion of this feature was to be able to provide command line editing facilities for shells that did not offer it and to compensate for the exclusion of shells that did.

The system implemented transparent demand paging of compressed executable programs, allowing the constituent pages of these compressed executables to be loaded into memory by the existing demand paging mechanism and then expanded in place for execution, taking advantage of the availability of sparse files (files with zero-padded regions) to reduce the disk space occupied by these pages. Shared library support, enabling processes to share library code, was also introduced to work around other &quot;unpleasant&quot; consequences of the hardware&#x27;s 32 KB page size, one of these being the excess space occupied by processes residing in main memory, especially in situations where separate pages need to be allocated.

Despite these remedies, the workstations offering RISC iX were regarded as being hampered by the memory management unit (MMU) using 32 KB pages. The MEMC, providing the MMU capabilities in the system architecture, was designed to be simpler to implement than contemporary MMUs, providing a 128-entry lookup table that effectively partitioned physical RAM into 128 equally sized pages, with a 4 MB address space divided into 128 pages resulting in the 32 KB page size employed in these systems. A &quot;logical&quot; or virtual page could only be usefully mapped to a single physical page through this mapping. This approach coincidentally recreated that employed by the University of Manchester Atlas virtual memory architecture.

The hardware supporting RISC iX also did not have direct memory access capabilities for disk operations, meaning that the CPU would spend time servicing interrupts related to disk transfers resulting in &quot;a definite reduction in, but not a complete loss of, available CPU power during disk transfers&quot;. However, by reducing the amount of data being fetched, the executable decompression technique did reduce CPU involvement in performing disk transfers, albeit at the expense of incurring CPU usage in the decompression of retrieved pages. Positive outcomes of the decompression scheme also included reduced loading on storage devices, of importance for networked storage, and generally improved disk transfer performance.

== Distribution ==
RISC iX was either supplied preinstalled on new computer hardware or was installed onsite from a portable tape drive by Granada Microcare, who would take the installation tape away with them. Upgrades to RISC iX 1.2 from earlier versions started at £349 for R140 machines, and new installations for A400-series machines started at £999. Installations required 100 MB of space on suitable hard drive or network storage, with hard drive and SCSI card bundles being offered from £1699 for R140 machines and from £2326 for A400-series machines.

Once installed a backup of the core operating system to three floppy disks was possible, allowing future reinstallation through the use of remote filesystems or backup media to transfer files to a machine.

== Hardware ==
According to documentation concerning RISC iX 1.2 availability, the operating system could be used on the R140, R225 and R260, being pre-installed on the R260, accessible via a fileserver (such as an R260) on the R225, and as an upgrade from RISC iX 1.15 or earlier on the R140. The A540, being practically identical to the R260, could support RISC iX as delivered, whereas A400-series machines required an Acorn SCSI card, with older A400-series machines also needing a memory controller upgrade and &quot;all the appropriate field change orders&quot; to have been performed. A300-series machines and the A3000 were not supported, largely due to potential compatibility issues with upgrades needed to bring these machines up to the required specification, in addition to operating temperature considerations with the A3000. Subsequent Archimedes machines, such as the A5000 and A30x0 models, were introduced without any prominent indication of RISC iX compatibility, although the A5000 expansion hardware was designed to support the same form of expansion card interrupt management as the A540, R-series and A400/1-series, specifically to be able to support .

Several machines were designed specifically to run RISC iX.

=== M4 ===

An unreleased machine, built internally by Acorn for the development of RISC iX. Reputedly only two or three were built and one of them has subsequently been destroyed. All known examples are owned by The National Museum of Computing.

=== A680 Technical Publishing System ===

Prototyped for an Olivetti product but unreleased, the A680 contained an ARM2 processor, 8 MB RAM, a 70 MB hard drive running from an onboard SCSI controller, and either a 40 MB cartridge tape drive or a single 2 MB floppy drive. Up to four &quot;podule&quot; expansion cards could be fitted, although one slot was occupied by the laser beam printer (LBP) expansion card supporting a directly driven low-cost laser printer as an alternative to a PostScript printer connected via the serial port. The system was meant to run Frame Technology&#x27;s FrameMaker under the &quot;Acorn UNIX&quot; operating system and NeWS graphical environment. To support 8 MB of RAM, dual memory controller (MEMC) units were employed.

The A680 was reportedly the first target for RISC iX and differed in certain ways from the Archimedes and R-series models. For instance, no other machine from Acorn Computers featured integrated SCSI. However, it is rumoured that overheating from the SCSI controller was one reason for the machine to never be released.

=== R140 ===

Based on the A440/1, the R140 uses the same 8 MHz ARM2 processor and 4 MB RAM, also providing a 60 MB ST506 hard drive, with the option of adding a second hard drive using the same internal controller. A SCSI adaptor was available (priced at £299 plus VAT) for other storage peripherals. Since the hardware is based on the Archimedes series, Acorn&#x27;s podule expansions could be added, although appropriate drivers would have needed to be written.

At the time of initial release in 1989, the cost of the R140 was £3,500 for a standalone workstation without Ethernet connectivity. For the additional cost of the Ethernet expansion (£449 plus VAT), a network-capable workstation could be configured. A floating point expansion card based on the WE32206 could also be added (priced at £599 plus VAT). A discount introduced at the start of 1990 offered the R140 bundled with Ethernet expansion and either a 14-inch colour monitor with PC emulation software or a 19-inch monochrome monitor for £2999 plus VAT.

Supplied with RISC OS 2 in ROM, the machine would boot that OS then could either automatically boot RISC iX totally removing RISC OS from memory or continue running RISC OSoptionally being rebooted into RISC iX at any time.

An ordinary A440/1 with at least 4 MB RAM and a suitable hard drive could also run RISC iX.

=== R260 ===

Based on the A540, the R260 originally contained a 30 MHz ARM3 processor, 8 MB RAM (upgradable to 16 MB) SCSI adapter and a 100 MB or 120 MB SCSI hard drive (typically a Conner CP30100). It booted in the same style as the earlier R140, but was normally configured for customers to boot straight into RISC iX. The machine was supplied with an Ethernet adapter.

The system was released in 1990 priced at £3995 plus VAT, having been announced with a price of £5000 plus VAT. A floating point accelerator or &quot;arithmetic co-processor&quot;, the FPA10, was made available in 1993 for the R260, as well as for the A540 and A5000 machines, priced at £99 plus VAT. These machines were designed to support the FPA device via a dedicated socket on the processor card (or, in the case of the A5000, on the motherboard), and offered a peak throughput of 5 MFLOPS at 26 MHz.

A similarly configured A540 could run RISC iX. Production of the A540 and R260 was discontinued in mid-1993.

=== R225 ===

The R225 was a diskless version of the R260. It required a network file server or an R260 to boot. The system was released alongside the R260 priced at £1995 plus VAT, having been announced with a price of £3000 plus VAT.

== Peripherals ==

As well as industry-standard Ethernet, Acorn&#x27;s own Econet was supported, facilitating connectivity between Econet and IP-based Ethernet networks. Moreover, the Econet interface on a RISC iX workstation could be treated as a &quot;Unix networking&quot; interface, permitting TCP/IP requests to be sent over Econet to hosts capable of handling them. In 1991, with Ethernet becoming more widespread on campus networks, Acorn offered a Network Gateway Starter Pack featuring the R140 equipped with Econet and Ethernet adapters at a price of £2499, with a licence for the TCP/IP Protocol Suite included to allow Archimedes computers to be able to communicate with such Ethernet-based networks via the gateway.

Similar Econet gateway capabilities were eventually extended to computers running RISC OS with Acorn&#x27;s TCP/IP Protocol Suite product and with the broader Acorn Universal Networking (AUN) suite of technologies, and a device driver update eventually provided a similar means of routing TCP/IP communications over Econet networks for RISC OS machines.

==Application software==
In 1989, Acorn announced support for the R140 from a number of application software vendors, including Informix, along with applications such as Uniplex, Q-Office (from Quadratron), Tetraplan, Sculptor (from MPD), Sea Change (from Thomson), Recital (&quot;a dBase compatible relational database&quot;) and Q-Calc (&quot;a Lotus, key-compatible spreadsheet&quot;). Applications for school administration and financial management - SIMS and SCRIPT (a COBOL-based school administration system) - were also offered in a bundle with the R140 workstation. The database application development tool DataFlex was announced for the R140 in mid-1990.

==Legacy==
Despite Acorn stating an intention to offer a Unix system from as early as 1982, with the National Semiconductor 32016 platform being the proposed vehicle for such a product, technical difficulties with the 32016&#x27;s chipset led to the Acorn Cambridge Workstation - the surviving product from the Acorn Business Computer range - shipping with a proprietary Acorn operating system instead of the planned Xenix-based Unix offering.

With the development of the ARM chipset, however, Acorn was finally in a position to deliver its own system capable of running Unix, announcing work as early as the autumn of 1987 on an &quot;upmarket ARM-based workstation to run the Unix operating system&quot; for release in mid-1988 to compete with Sun and Apollo models in the higher education market, featuring a built-in WE32206 &quot;arithmetic co-processor&quot;. The company eventually brought the R140 to market in early 1989 alongside the second iteration of ARM2-based Archimedes 400-series models, following up in 1990 with the R225 and R260 alongside the high-end, ARM3-based Archimedes 540, thereby delivering on their earlier ambitions within the space of a couple of years. The introduction of the R225 and R260 renewed the enthusiasm of some commentators who conceded that the earlier ARM2-based R140, alongside competition based on the 80386, 68020 and 68030 processors, were underpowered to run &quot;wedding-cake configurations&quot; of the X Window System, Motif, X.desktop and other software, but considered Acorn&#x27;s ARM3 products, alongside competition based on the 80486, SPARC and 88000 processors, to be more capable of such tasks.

Nevertheless, Acorn discontinued R260 production in 1993, shortly after announcing the floating point accelerator unit, which had been promised for 1991 and repeatedly delayed, and subsequently offered no new RISC iX system products. Although there were expectations that Acorn&#x27;s corporate parent, Olivetti, might have provided opportunities for ARM-based Unix workstation products, leveraging its relationship with AT&amp;T as the proprietor of Unix, it became apparent that AT&amp;T&#x27;s own interests lay with products based on the SPARC architecture, with AT&amp;T also having an ownership stake in Sun. Olivetti&#x27;s own workstation strategy was incoherent at the turn of the 1990s, with the company announcing products based on MIPS and Alpha architectures before settling on Intel&#x27;s architecture once again.

Olivetti itself had previously made a workstation, the CP486, based on the Intel 80486 running SCO Unix or Xenix and offering support for the Weitek 4167 floating point unit and Intel i860 &quot;application accelerator&quot;. This machine was available in 1989 and described as the basis of a &quot;high-cost authoring workstation&quot; in a European initiative, but was rather more expensive than Acorn&#x27;s RISC iX workstations, costing $16,250 for a configuration with 4 MB of RAM and 150 MB hard disk. Crude hardware performance comparisons based on Dhrystone benchmarking under like-for-like environments - taking results from CP486 benchmarks run under DOS and from Archimedes benchmarks run under RISC OS - indicate that the CP486 was around four times faster than the R140 and was still faster than the R260. Floating-point arithmetic performance of the CP486 was approximately double that of the R260 with FPA fitted. Of more relevance to RISC iX itself, in the context of the workstations developed for European initiatives, the Chorus system was to be used as the basis of the Unix operating system provided, both on the 486-based authoring workstation and the ARM3-based &quot;low cost delivery workstation&quot;, with Chorus having been ported to the ARM3 processor.

In computational performance terms, Acorn&#x27;s R140 compared unfavourably with other 1989 models such as the Sun SPARCstation 1 and Digital DECstation 3100, particularly with regard to floating-point performance, although such disadvantages could perhaps have been somewhat overlooked in an entry-level workstation costing around or approximately $, compared to for the DECstation 3100, or for the entry-level DECstation 2100. The R260 compared more favourably in terms of integer performance with its contemporaries employing processors such as the Intel 486 and Motorola 68030, but comparing less favourably with 68040-based models and newer models from traditional RISC workstation vendors. In terms of pricing, although the R260 maintained a similar price point to the R140, increasing pricing competition between Digital and Sun brought models like the DECstation 2100 down to even before the R260&#x27;s introduction at an already reduced price of , equivalent to $. At the point of the introduction of floating-point hardware for the R260 in 1993, the performance of the R260 was decidedly uncompetitive with the final MIPS-based DECstation models and contemporary SPARCstation models.

In 1994, the Risc PC launched with an improved chipset that was amenable to running Unix, and amidst a certain level of interest in the &quot;large potential&quot; of Unix running on the new machine, the independent RiscBSD initiative was announced in August 1994 to bring &quot;a base of BSD4.4 - probably the NetBSD flavour&quot; to this hardware platform. A &quot;very, very alpha kernel&quot; was demonstrated after six weeks of initial effort by the RiscBSD developers at the Acorn World show in late 1994. Meanwhile, another initiative, ArcBSD, sought to port FreeBSD to &quot;all 32-bit Acorn machines with sufficient RAM and hard disk space&quot;.

Although not developed with any significant Acorn involvement, RiscBSD eventually became NetBSD/arm32 (being imported in NetBSD 1.2) and was used in a Risc PC-based product sold by Acorn&#x27;s education joint venture, Xemplar, called NCServer. Support for this product continued after the Apple takeover of Xemplar in 1999 through a company, Precedence Technologies, founded to continue development having acquired the remaining network computer inventory. The product evolved to employ server hardware based on the Simtec CATS board, providing access to files and applications stored on the server via an HTML-based interface, with RISC OS-based network computers being able to run the NCWorks suite of applications customised from various familiar RISC OS applications such as Draw, Paint, EasiWriter, DataPower and Schema. NetBSD support for Acorn machines was eventually provided by the acorn32 port for Risc PC and A7000 family models, along with the acorn26 port for Archimedes, A-series and R-series models, thus bringing a more modern Unix variant to Acorn&#x27;s original Unix workstations.

<text>Juana Azurduy de Padilla International Airport is an airport located in Sucre, Bolivia, the nation&#x27;s constitutional capital city. It is currently a base of the Bolivian Air Force and was formerly Sucre&#x27;s main commercial airport until it was replaced by the Alcantarí Airport.

The only runway at Juana Azurduy de Padilla is in length, and at an altitude of . Because of this high altitude, many people who arrived at Sucre via rapid air travel get altitude sickness. The altitude also caused the airport to be excessively cloudy at times, making approach difficult.

As with many in Latin America, Juana Azurduy de Padilla International Airport was not open 24 hours a day. It was only open from sunrise to sunset.

Though Sucre is Bolivia&#x27;s constitutional (de jure) capital city, Juana Azurduy de Padilla International Airport was not the largest airport in the country. The largest airport is Viru Viru in Santa Cruz de la Sierra.

The airport was named after Juana Azurduy de Padilla, who fought for the independence against Spain.

On May 15, 2016, after 41 years of service, the Juana Azurduy de Padilla International Airport ended its commercial flight service, and all its operations moved to Alcantarí Airport. On 2017, the administration of the airport passed from AASANA to the military, turning the airport into an air force base.

<doc id="724946" wikidata="Q1321132" url="?curid=724946" title="Freddy García">
<text>Freddy Antonio García (born October 6, 1976) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball pitcher. He is best known for his many seasons with seven Major League Baseball (MLB) franchises, including the Seattle Mariners, Chicago White Sox, and New York Yankees. Garcia has also pitched in the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL), Mexican League, and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League.

García&#x27;s best year was in 2001 in which he led the American League in innings pitched and ERA. He made the All-Star team in 2001 and 2002. In 2005, he was a member of the World Series winning Chicago White Sox and started the series-winning Game 4.

==Professional career==

===Seattle Mariners===
Originally signed by the Houston Astros as a non-draft amateur free agent in 1993, García was acquired by Seattle in 1998, along with Carlos Guillén and John Halama in the trade that sent Randy Johnson to the Astros.

During García&#x27;s rookie season, he pitched 201 innings, compiling a 17–8 record with 170 strikeouts and a 4.07 ERA in 33 starts. After going 9–5 in his second season, he went on to compile a 45–42 win–loss record over the course of the next three and a half seasons with Seattle. His strongest season was in 2001, when he earned 18 of the Mariners&#x27; American League record-setting 116 wins and led the AL with innings pitched and a 3.05 earned run average. He finished third in AL Cy Young Award voting that year.

On June 27, 2004, García and Ben Davis were traded to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for Michael Morse, Miguel Olivo, and Jeremy Reed. As a Mariner, García posted a 76–50 record with a 3.89 ERA and 819 strikeouts.

===Chicago White Sox===
García was the starting pitcher in Game 4 of the 2005 World Series for the Chicago White Sox, pitching seven scoreless innings against the Houston Astros. The White Sox won the game and the World Series, completing a four-game sweep.

García experienced a bit of controversy at the beginning of the 2006 season when he tested positive for marijuana during the World Baseball Classic.

In 2006, he surpassed 1,000 strikeouts for his career. In eight post-season games, he was 5–2 with a 3.56 ERA in 48 innings. Also during 2006, on April 29, García recorded his 103rd career win in a game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, surpassing former White Sox left-hander Wilson Álvarez as the Venezuelan native with the most career wins in Major League history. He finished the season 17–9 with a 4.53 ERA. He was given the nickname &quot;Big Game&quot; while a member of the White Sox.

===Philadelphia Phillies===

In December 2006, García was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for prospects Gavin Floyd and Gio González.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP/ESPN&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

García experienced a shoulder injury that limited his performance for the first several months of the season. He was placed on the disabled list (DL) in June, and had shoulder surgery in August. García made 11 starts before being placed on the DL and earned one win.

===Detroit Tigers===
In August 2008, García signed a minor league contract with the Detroit Tigers. In his first 2 minor league starts with the Tigers he pitched 5 innings, gave up no runs, and struck out 5. In his Tigers debut in late September, García, with a limited pitch count, threw 5 scoreless innings to get the win.

===New York Mets===
In January 2009, García agreed to a minor league deal with the New York Mets. He was released on April 28, 2009, after two bad starts for the Buffalo Bisons.

===Second stint with the Chicago White Sox===
On June 8, 2009, the Chicago White Sox signed García to a minor league contract. García started on August 18 against the Kansas City Royals for the first time with the White Sox since 2006.

In his first game back with the White Sox, García went 4.1 IP allowing 5 ER in a losing effort. García finished the 2009 season with a 3–4 record and a 4.34 ERA.

On October 5, 2009, the Chicago White Sox exercised their 2010 option on García, adding that the 34-year-old made a $1 million base salary, plus a possible $2 million in incentives. He became a free agent following the 2010 season.

===New York Yankees===
On January 31, 2011, García agreed to a minor league contract with the New York Yankees worth $1.5 million. On March 25, 2011, the Yankees announced that García would be added to the major league starting rotation. He finished the 2011 season with a solid 12–8 record and a 3.62 ERA, however, he was consistently hammered by teams with .500 or better records, most notably the Boston Red Sox. García was on the mound in relief as the Sox won their second game of the season on April 10, as well as 2 other losses on May 15 and June 7. However, García did manage to defeat the Red Sox on September 24.

García also lost his only playoff start in Game 2 as the Yankees were defeated by the Detroit Tigers in the American League Division Series in five games. Despite this, the Yankees offered him a one-year deal worth $4 million with incentives for the 2012 season. The deal became official on December 9.

In 2012, García was expected to challenge for a starting spot with Phil Hughes, A. J. Burnett, Andy Pettitte and Michael Pineda. However, Burnett was traded in the offseason, and Pineda was diagnosed with a shoulder injury, thereby allowing García into the rotation.

García began the 2012 season with bad footing as he threw 5 wild pitches in his first start against the Baltimore Orioles. He was demoted to the bullpen after going 0–2 in April with a 12.51 ERA, averaging only 3.1 innings per start. David Phelps was moved into the starting rotation.

García immediately improved once in the bullpen. In his two-month relief stint, he posted a 1.56 ERA in 17.1 innings. His sinker&#x27;s speed also improved, from an average of 87.1 mph in April to 88.6 in May/June.

A fibula injury to Andy Pettitte in late June brought García back into the rotation. Overall, Garcia finished the 2012 season with a 7–6 record and a 5.20 ERA in 30 games appeared (17 started). He became a free agent following the season.

===Baltimore Orioles===
On January 28, 2013, García signed a minor league deal with the San Diego Padres. He was released by the Padres on March 24. He was promptly signed to a minor league contract by the Baltimore Orioles, and assigned to the Triple-A Norfolk Tides. He was called up on May 4 to make his Orioles debut on the road at Anaheim. He was designated for assignment on June 24, 2013. Three days later, García signed another minor league contract and returned to Norfolk.

===Atlanta Braves===
On August 23, 2013, Garcia was acquired by the Atlanta Braves for cash considerations. He had his contract selected to the major league roster on September 1. Garcia pitched effectively for the Braves, going 1–2 with a 1.65 ERA in September (1–1, 1.83 ERA in 3 starts). He earned a start in game four of the NLDS. Although the Braves lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers, Garcia pitched well, giving up 2 runs over 6 innings and was in line for the win when he left the game.

He returned to the Braves on a minor league contract signed January 24, 2014. He was released on March 24.

===EDA Rhinos===
On April 18, 2014, García signed with the EDA Rhinos of the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL). The seven-month deal included incentives that increased its worth up to $392,000, and was the most lucrative in CPBL history until Lin Chih-sheng signed a 3-year deal for $1.36 million in January 2016. In his first game for the Rhinos on May 10, 2014, García pitched six innings of shutout ball on four hits in a no-decision before being pulled after 77 pitches. The Rhinos won the game 5–0 against the Chinatrust Brother Elephants in front of a sellout crowd of more than 12,000.

===Olmecas de Tabasco/Los Angeles Dodgers===
On February 25, 2015, Garcia signed with the Olmecas de Tabasco of the Mexican League. He made 6 starts throwing 33.1 innings going 1-2 with a 5.67 ERA and 21 strikeouts. 

On April 9, 2015, Garcia signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was assigned to the AAA Oklahoma City Dodgers. He appeared in four games and made one start for Oklahoma City, allowing seven runs in 7.1 innings and was released on April 21. 

===Sultanes de Monterrey===
He rejoined the Olmecas de Tabasco in June, then was traded to the Sultanes de Monterrey. In September Garcia was assigned to the Tigres de Aragua. He spent the rest of 2015 with Aragua, where he won a league championship, and started the first and final games of the 2016 Caribbean Series. He retired after the series concluded. In 5 starts 35.1 innings he went 3-1 with a 2.55 ERA and 23 strikeouts.

On April 8, 2016, Garcia came out of retirement and signed with the Sultanes de Monterrey of the Mexican Baseball League. He was released on May 3, 2016. In 5 starts 23.1 innings he went 2-0 with a 5.01 ERA and 14 strikeouts.

===Leones de Yucatán===
On March 5, 2018, García signed with the Leones de Yucatán of the Mexican Baseball League. He was released on April 23, 2018. He made 5 starts throwing 23.2 innings going 2-2 with a 5.32 ERA and 22 strikeouts.

Garcia was eligible to be elected in the Hall of Fame in 2019, but received less than 5% of the vote, and became ineligible for the 2020 ballot.

==Pitching style==
García threw a fastball that topped out in the 90s in his prime and a hard slider. He also threw a two-seam fastball, a curveball, a split-finger fastball and occasionally used a changeup.

García was once a power pitcher, but as he got older, García lost velocity on his pitches and compensated by developing a broad repertoire of up to six or seven pitches. In the 2013 season, García threw the following pitches, in order of their use:
* Four-seam fastball — 86–90 mph
* Slider — 78–82 mph
* Curveball — 72–76 mph
* Splitter — 78–82 mph
* Changeup — 80–84 mph
* Sinker — 86–90 mph

García has also adjusted his approach to the strike zone, being especially careful not to leave pitches in the middle of the plate: &quot;He doesn&#x27;t really have the electric stuff, so he&#x27;s going to stay on the corners and stay out of the zone.&quot;

<text>IgA nephropathy (IgAN), also known as Berger&#x27;s disease () (and variations), or synpharyngitic glomerulonephritis, is a disease of the kidney (or nephropathy) and the immune system; specifically it is a form of glomerulonephritis or an inflammation of the glomeruli of the kidney. Aggressive Berger&#x27;s disease (a rarer form of the disease) can attack other major organs, such as the liver, skin and heart.

IgA nephropathy is the most common glomerulonephritis worldwide; the global incidence is 2.5/100,000 per year amongst adults. Aggressive Berger&#x27;s disease is on the NORD list of rare diseases. Primary IgA nephropathy is characterized by deposition of the IgA antibody in the glomerulus. There are other diseases associated with glomerular IgA deposits, the most common being IgA vasculitis (formerly known as Henoch–Schönlein purpura [HSP]), which is considered by many to be a systemic form of IgA nephropathy. IgA vasculitis presents with a characteristic purpuric skin rash, arthritis, and abdominal pain, and occurs more commonly in children. HSP is associated with a more benign prognosis than IgA nephropathy. In non-aggressive IgA nephropathy there is traditionally a slow progression to chronic kidney failure in 25–30% of cases during a period of 20 years.

==Signs and symptoms==
The classic presentation for the non-aggressive form (in 40–50% of the cases) is episodic hematuria, which usually starts within a day or two of a non-specific upper respiratory tract infection (hence &quot;synpharyngitic&quot;), as opposed to post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which occurs some time (weeks) after initial infection. With both aggressive and non-aggressive Berger&#x27;s disease loin pain can also occur. The gross hematuria may resolve after a few days, though microscopic hematuria will persist, it is however more common with aggressive Berger&#x27;s disease for gross hematuria to persist rather than microscopic hematuria. Renal function usually remains normal with non-aggressive Berger&#x27;s disease, though rarely acute kidney failure may occur (see below). This presentation is more common in younger adults.

A smaller proportion (20–30%), usually the older population, have microscopic hematuria and proteinuria (less than 2 gram/day). These patients may be asymptomatic and only picked up due to urinalysis. Hence, the disease is more commonly diagnosed in situations where screening of urine is compulsory (e.g., schoolchildren in Japan).

Very rarely (5% each), the presenting history is:
* Nephritic syndrome
* Acute kidney failure (either as a complication of the frank hematuria, when it usually recovers or due to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis which often leads to chronic kidney failure)
* Chronic kidney failure (no previous symptoms, presents with anemia, hypertension and other symptoms of kidney failure, in people who probably had longstanding undetected microscopic hematuria and/or proteinuria)

A variety of systemic diseases are associated with aggressive IgA nephropathy (Berger&#x27;s disease) such as liver failure, cancer, celiac disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, heart failure, reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and HIV. Diagnosis of Berger&#x27;s disease and a search for any associated disease occasionally reveals such an underlying serious systemic disease. Occasionally, there are simultaneous symptoms of Henoch–Schönlein purpura; see below for more details on the association. Some HLA alleles have been suspected along with complement phenotypes as being genetic factors. Non-aggressive Berger&#x27;s disease may also be associated with any of the above systemic diseases, however, this is rare.

==Morphology==
Histologically, IgA nephropathy may show mesangial widening and focal and segmental inflammation. Diffuse mesangial proliferation or crescentic glomerulonephritis may also be present. Immunofluorescence shows mesangial deposition of IgA often with C3 and properdin and smaller amounts of other immunoglobulins (IgG or IgM). Early components of the classical complement pathway (C1q or C4) are usually not seen. Electron microscopy confirms electron-dense deposits in the mesangium that may extend to the subendothelial area of adjacent capillary walls in a small subset of cases, usually those with focal proliferation.

==Pathophysiology==
The disease derives its name from deposits of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in a granular pattern in the mesangium (by immunofluorescence), a region of the renal glomerulus. The mesangium by light microscopy may be hypercellular and show increased deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. In terms of the renal manifestation of Henoch–Schönlein purpura, it has been found that although it shares the same histological spectrum as IgA nephropathy, a greater frequency of severe lesions such as glomerular necrosis and crescents were observed. Correspondingly, HSP nephritis has a higher frequency of glomerular staining for fibrin compared with IgAN, but with an otherwise similar immunofluorescence profile.

There is no clear known explanation for the accumulation of the IgA. Exogenous antigens for IgA have not been identified in the kidney, but it is possible that this antigen has been cleared before the disease manifests itself. It has also been proposed that IgA itself may be the antigen.

A recently advanced theory focuses on abnormalities of the IgA1 molecule. IgA1 is one of the two immunoglobulin subclasses (the other is IgD) that is O-glycosylated on a number of serine and threonine residues in a special proline-rich hinge region. Aberrant glycosylation of IgA appears to lead to polymerisation of the IgA molecules in tissues, especially the glomerular mesangium. A similar mechanism has been claimed to underlie Henoch–Schönlein purpura, a vasculitis that mainly affects children and can feature renal involvement that is almost indistinguishable from IgA nephritis. However, human studies have found that degalactosylation of IgA1 occurs in patients with IgA nephropathy in response only to gut antigen exposures (not systemic), and occurs in healthy people to a lesser extent. This strongly suggests degalactosylation of IgA1 is a result of an underlying phenomenon (abnormal mucosal antigen handling) and not the ultimate cause of IgA nephropathy. Prevailing evidence suggests that both galactose-deficient o-glycans in the hinge region of IgA1 and synthesis and binding of antibodies against IgA1 are required for immunoglobulin complexes to form and accumulate in glomeruli.

From the fact that IgAN can recur after renal transplant, it can be postulated that the disease is caused by a problem in the immune system rather than the kidney itself. Remarkably, the IgA1 that accumulates in the kidney does not appear to originate from the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), which is the site of most upper respiratory tract infections, but from the bone marrow. This, too, suggests an immune pathology rather than direct interference by outside agents.

=== Natural history ===
Since IgA nephropathy commonly presents without symptoms through abnormal findings on urinalysis, there is considerable possibility for variation in any population studied depending upon the screening policy. Similarly, the local policy for performing kidney biopsy assumes a critical role; if it is a policy to simply observe patients with isolated bloody urine, a group with a generally favourable prognosis will be excluded. If, in contrast, all such patients are biopsied, then the group with isolated microscopic hematuria and isolated mesangial IgA will be included and improve the prognosis of that particular series.

Nevertheless, IgA nephropathy, which was initially thought to be a benign disease, has been shown to not be a benign disease, particularly if the patient presents with an aggressive form. Though most reports describe Berger&#x27;s disease as having an indolent evolution towards either healing or renal damage, a more aggressive course is occasionally seen associated with extensive crescents, and presenting as acute kidney failure. In general, the entry into chronic kidney failure is slow as compared to most other glomerulonephritides – occurring over a time scale of 30 years or more (in contrast to the 5 to 15 years in other glomerulonephritides), however, in aggressive Berger&#x27;s disease the time scale is within 5–10 years and often sooner. This may reflect the earlier diagnosis made due to frank hematuria.

Complete remission of aggressive Berger&#x27;s disease rarely occurs in adults. In about 5% of cases, however, there is a higher chance of remission with non-aggressive Berger&#x27;s disease (this is estimated to be around 7.4% of cases). There is a high chance of relapse, particularly with aggressive Berger&#x27;s disease. However, given the evolution of this disease, the longer term (10–20 years) outcome of such patients is not yet established.

Overall, the current 10-year survival rate for aggressive Berger&#x27;s disease is 25% and 73% for non-aggressive Berger&#x27;s disease.

Genetic and Environmental Influences on IgA Nephropathy

IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is primarily a sporadic disease, with over 90% of cases classified as such. However, recent findings have uncovered a significant genetic component that influences both the regulation of serum IgA levels and susceptibility to the disease. Research has demonstrated positive associations between genetic regulation of IgA and conditions such as IgAN and type 2 diabetes, whereas negative associations have been observed with celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Notably, a study conducted by Liu (2022) highlighted ancestral differences, revealing that individuals of African descent consistently have higher serum IgA levels. These findings suggest a complex interplay of genetic factors in regulating IgA levels and contributing to the susceptibility of various immune, kidney, and metabolic disorders.

Another study utilized a two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) approach to explore causal relationships between IgAN and several factors, including neuropsychiatric disorders and dietary intake (Lin, 2025). The study found a positive causal link between IgAN and depressive disorders, as well as a potential link with anorexia nervosa. However, no causal relationships were identified with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. This indicates that IgAN may share genetic or biological pathways specifically with certain neuropsychiatric conditions, potentially influencing their development (Li, 2024).

The role of dietary habits in the development of IgAN was also explored using genetic data (Hernán, 2029). The study found that frequent alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk of developing IgAN, whereas the consumption of cheese, cereal, and sushi appeared to reduce the risk. These findings suggest that diet is a modifiable factor that could potentially influence IgAN development.

Overall, these studies highlight the intricate relationship between genetics, diet, and IgAN, with potential implications for both mental health and dietary practices. Further research is needed to confirm these associations and understand the underlying mechanisms, which could inform prevention strategies for individuals at risk of IgAN. Early prevention efforts should target both genetic and lifestyle factors. Screening individuals with a family history of IgAN or related autoimmune disorders could help identify those at greater risk. Moreover, adopting a healthy diet that limits alcohol and includes protective foods such as cheese, cereal, and sushi may reduce the likelihood of developing IgAN. Early intervention through lifestyle modifications, regular monitoring of kidney function, and stress management may also help reduce the onset of neuropsychiatric conditions linked to IgAN, such as depression.

==Diagnosis==
For an adult patient with isolated hematuria, tests such as ultrasound of the kidney and cystoscopy are usually done first to pinpoint the source of the bleeding. These tests would rule out kidney stones and bladder cancer, two other common urological causes of hematuria. In children and younger adults, the history and association with respiratory infection can raise the suspicion of IgA nephropathy. A kidney biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy specimen shows proliferation of the mesangium, with IgA deposits on immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. However, patients with isolated microscopic hematuria (i.e. without associated proteinuria and with normal kidney function) are not usually biopsied since this is associated with an excellent prognosis. A urinalysis will show red blood cells, usually as red cell urinary casts. Proteinuria, usually less than 2 grams per day, also may be present. Other renal causes of isolated hematuria include thin basement membrane disease and Alport syndrome, the latter being a hereditary disease associated with hearing impairment and eye problems.

Other blood tests done to aid in the diagnosis include CRP or ESR, complement levels, ANA, and LDH. Protein electrophoresis and immunoglobulin levels can show increased IgA in 50% of all patients.

==Treatment==
The ideal treatment for IgAN would remove IgA from the glomerulus and prevent further IgA deposition. This goal still remains a remote prospect. There are a few additional caveats that have to be considered while treating IgA nephropathy. IgA nephropathy has a very variable course, ranging from a benign recurrent hematuria up to a rapid progression to chronic kidney failure and failure of other major organs. Hence the decision on which patients to treat should be based on the prognostic factors and the risk of progression. Also, IgA nephropathy recurs in transplants despite the use of ciclosporin, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, Isotretinoin and steroids in these patients. There are persisting uncertainties, due to the limited number of patients included in the few controlled, randomized, studies performed to date. These studies hardly produce statistically-significant evidence regarding the heterogeneity of IgA nephropathy patients, the diversity of study treatment protocols, and the length of follow-up.

In cases where tonsillitis is the precipitating factor for episodic hematuria, a tonsillectomy has been claimed to reduce the frequency of those episodes. However, it does not reduce the incidence of progressive kidney failure. Dietary gluten restriction, used to reduce mucosal antigen challenge, also has not been shown to preserve kidney function. Phenytoin has also been tried without any benefit.

A subset of IgA nephropathy patients, who have minimal change disease on light microscopy and clinically have nephrotic syndrome, show an exquisite response to steroids, behaving more or less like minimal change disease. In other patients, the evidence for steroids is not compelling. Short courses of high dose steroids have been proven to lack benefit. However, in patients with aggressive Berger&#x27;s disease 6 months regimen of steroids in addition to other medications may lessen proteinuria and preserve renal function. The study had 10 years of patient follow-up data, and did show a benefit for steroid therapy; there was a lower chance of reaching end-stage renal disease (renal function so poor that dialysis was required) in the steroid group. Importantly, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were used in both groups equally.

Cyclophosphamide (traded as endoxan and cytoxan) and Isotretinoin have commonly been used, often with anti-platelet/anticoagulants in patients with Aggressive Berger&#x27;s disease, however, the side effect profile of these drugs, including long term risk of malignancy and sterility, made them an unfavorable choice for use in young adults. However, one recent study, in a carefully selected high risk population of patients with declining GFR, showed that a combination of steroids and cyclophosphamide for the initial 3 months followed by azathioprine for a minimum of 2 years resulted in a significant preservation of renal function. Other agents such as mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin and mizoribine have also been tried with varying results.

A 1994 study by Mayo Clinic found that long-term treatment with omega−3 fatty acid-rich fish oil, which does not have the drawbacks of immunosuppressive therapy, was associated with slight reduction of progression to kidney failure, without, however, reducing proteinuria in a subset of patients with high risk of worsening kidney function. However, these results were not reproduced by other study groups and in two subsequent meta-analyses.

The events that tend to lead to progressive kidney failure are not unique to IgA nephropathy, and non-specific measures to reduce the same would be equally useful. These include a low-protein diet and optimal control of blood pressure. The choice of antihypertensive agent is open as long as the blood pressure is controlled to desired level. However, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists are favoured due to their anti-proteinuric effect.

In December 2021, budesonide (Tarpeyo) was approved for medical use in the US to reduce proteinuria in adults with primary IgA nephropathy at risk of rapid disease progression.

Sparsentan is a therapy recently approved in the USA for treating primary IgA nephropathy. It is a dual endothelin angiotensin receptor antagonist that uniquely combines angiotensin and endothelin inhibition without immunosuppression. In clinical trials, sparsentan demonstrated significant reductions in proteinuria and better preservation of kidney function than irbesartan, a standard treatment. These results were evident in the 36-week interim analysis of the phase 3 PROTECT trial, and sustained through 110 weeks in the final analysis. This approval marks a significant milestone in managing IgA nephropathy, offering new option for affected patients.

==Prognosis==
Male sex, proteinuria (especially &gt; 2 g/day), hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia, older age, familial disease and elevated creatinine concentrations are markers of a poor outcome. Frank hematuria has shown discordant results with most studies showing a better prognosis, perhaps related to the early diagnosis, except for one group which reported a poorer prognosis. Proteinuria and hypertension are the most powerful prognostic factors in this group.

Certain other features found by kidney biopsy, such as interstitial scarring, are associated with a poor prognosis. ACE gene polymorphism has recently been shown to have an impact with the DD genotype associated more commonly with progression to kidney failure.

Disease progression in IgAN can be predicted at the time of kidney biopsy by a risk-prediction tool. 

==Epidemiology==
Men are affected three times as often as women. There is also marked geographic variation in the prevalence of IgA nephropathy throughout the world. It is the most common glomerular disease in the Far East and Southeast Asia, accounting for almost half of all patients with glomerular disease; however, it accounts for only about 25% of the proportion in Europeans and about 10% among North Americans, with African–Americans having a very low prevalence of about 2%. A confounding factor in this analysis is the existing policy of screening and use of kidney biopsy as an investigative tool. School children in Japan and army recruits in Singapore undergo routine urinalysis, and any suspicious abnormality is pursued with a kidney biopsy, which might partly explain the high observed incidence of IgA nephropathy in those countries.
===Genetics===
Though various associations have been described, no consistent pattern pointing to a single susceptible gene has been identified to date. Associations described include those with C4 null allele, factor B Bf alleles, MHC antigens and IgA isotypes. ACE gene polymorphism (D allele) is associated with progression of kidney failure, similar to its association with other causes of chronic kidney failure. However, more than 90% of cases of IgA nephropathy are sporadic, with a few large pedigrees described from Kentucky and Italy ().

==History==

William Heberden the elder first described the disease in 1801 in a 5-year-old child with abdominal pain, hematuria, hematochezia, and purpura of the legs. In 1837, Johann Lukas Schönlein described a syndrome of purpura associated with joint pain and urinary precipitates in children. Eduard Heinrich Henoch, a student of Schönlein&#x27;s, further associated abdominal pain and renal involvement with the syndrome.

In 1968, Jean Berger (1930–2011), a pioneering French nephrologist, with co-author electron microscopist Nicole Hinglais, was the first to describe IgA deposition in this form of glomerulonephritis and it is consequently sometimes called Berger&#x27;s disease.

<text>Nova Kakhovka (, ; ) is a city in Kakhovka Raion, Kherson Oblast, southern Ukraine. Nova Kakhovka has been under Russian occupation since February 2022. Its estimated population in 2022 was 

Nova Kakhovka is an important port city on the east bank of the Dnieper River, where it meets the downstream end of the Kakhovka Reservoir. It forms one abutment of the Kakhovskyi Bridge over the hydroelectric Kakhovka Dam; the other is located in Beryslav. The city lies immediately downstream of the source of the North Crimean Canal that irrigates the Crimean Peninsula and can be said to control the seat of the channel.

On 6 June 2023, the dam was deliberately destroyed, causing catastrophic drainage of the reservoir. At the time, the dam was under the control of the Russian military, which had seized it in the early days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==History==
A village named Klisheve was founded at the site of modern Nova Kakhovka in 1891. Nova Kakhovka proper was founded in 1951 in connection with the building of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant (KHPP), on the site of the former Klisheve.

The KHPP dam was one of the Soviet Union&#x27;s &quot;Great Construction Projects of Communism&quot;. The new city was built to house the plant&#x27;s construction workers. It was given the name Nova Kakhovka, or New Kakhovka, by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet to distinguish it from the city Kakhovka located away.

Schools 1 and 2 opened in the fall of 1950, and on 10 October, the Dniprobud administration created a housing department tasked with building a new town of hydroelectric engineers. By 20 April 1951, the foundation of the first residential building, at Karl Marx, 31, had been laid, followed by the building&#x27;s opening on 30 May.

In nine months, 154 km of railways were built, and on 10 February 1952, a train from Fedorivka arrived in Nova Kakhovka. At noon, a freight train originating in Chelyabinsk, Moscow, Bryansk approached the triumphal arch, where it was met by thousands of construction workers before delivering its load directly to a construction site. The railway became an important transportation artery, accelerating the construction of the hydroelectric plant, city, suburban farms, and the entire middle portion of the Kherson region. After the completion of the power plant, most of the workers stayed in Nova Kakhovka.

Originally destined to remain a small 20,000-person city of hydroelectric engineers, Nova Kakhovka possessed broad development prospects beyond a highly skilled and experienced population due to its central location in Kherson region and access to cheap electricity, railways, highways and waterways, which opened the way to large-tonnage ships from the mouth of the Dnieper to the Pripyat.

Until 18 July 2020, Nova Kakhovka was incorporated as a city of oblast significance and the center of Nova Kakhovka Municipality. The municipality as an administrative unit was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Kherson Oblast to five, and it was merged into Kakhovka Raion.

=== Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
The Russian occupation of Nova Kakhovka in Ukraine began on 24 February 2022, with explosions and shelling from the direction of occupied Crimea. Russian troops quickly took control of the city and its key infrastructure, including the hydroelectric power plant and canal. A family attempting to flee the city was shot by Russian troops on the dam of the power plant.

Over the next few months, the city was occupied by Russian forces, and the population was subjected to pro-Russian rallies and the reopening of a Lenin monument. Ukrainian troops responded with acts of resistance, destroying Russian military units and ammunition warehouses, though they were unable to put an end to the Russian presence in Nova Kakhovka.

On 9 January 2023, Russian occupation forces ordered the closing of several area hospitals, and on 20 January, the city hospital was shelled. This was followed by more mortar attacks, leading to a partial loss of electricity and damage to residential buildings.

On 6 June, the Kakhovka Dam was breached, causing extensive flooding and prompting mass evacuations.

==Geography==

The city is sometimes referred to as an oasis because it was built on an area where sand was plentiful. During the city&#x27;s construction, sod was brought in to build its parks directly on the sandy ground. Architectural plans were developed to build streets and squares in harmony with the reservoir shoreline.

===Economy and transport===
The main economic activities in Nova Kakhovka are engineering (electrotechnology) and power production. Near the city, the large North Crimean Canal begins, supplying southwest Kherson Oblast and the entire northern part of the Crimea with water from the Dnieper River.

The city is located between Kherson in the west and Melitopol to the east, near European route E58, which runs from Odesa to Rostov-on-Don. The city has a non-electrified, one-track railway, an airport, a water route to the Black Sea, and a port located on the southwest part of the Khakovka Reservoir.

===City attractions===
Stepan Faldzinsky Park, a designated protected natural area, is named after the native Polish agrarian from Podolie who created the green oasis at the Oleshky Sands. The city is also known for its &quot;stone emroidery&quot; - exterior moulding with traditional Ukrainian patterns done in 1953-1955 by a group of Boychukist artists.

==Culture==
 
The main cultural center of Nova Kakhovka is the Palace of Culture, which hosts regular performances of creative groups and folk ensembles, both local and from neighboring areas.

Nova Kakhovka has a museum of local history with a permanent exhibition on the history of the city, a wine museum, the house-museum of Anatoly Bakhuta, an art gallery named after Albin Gavdzinsky, libraries, a summer theater, and the &quot;Youth&quot; cinema, part of the Cinema Palace.

The city has three parks, squares, beaches, promenade, numerous cafés, nightclubs, a zoo and amusement park.

==Sports==
Nova Kakhovka has three sports schools for children and youth, 21 gyms, 110 sports grounds, a water sports base, and 13 tennis courts.

The Novokakhovska Tennis School is one of the best in Ukraine and well-known graduates include not only male (Andriy Shashkov, Maksym Dubov, Serhiy Yaroshenko, Serhiy Vergun, Oleksandr Maksymov and Dmytro Biletsky) and female players (Motobol Natalia Biletska, Yuliana Fedak and Halyna Furgailo) but also coaches (Serhiy Zhytsky, an Honored Coach of Ukraine, Serhiy Korovaiko, Andriy Dubov, Tetyana Furgailo, Olga Kushnirenko and Anatoliy Biletsky).

The Energia City Stadium hosts popular sports such as motoball and soccer. Motorcyclists won silver medals in the 2001 Ukrainian championship, and the FC Enerhiya Nova Kakhovka football team has won the regional cup 21 times and the regional championship 25 times.

Nova Kakhovka&#x27;s Dynamo archery complex can simultaneously hold 70 archers on the shooting range, and the city has won the archery championships of Ukraine and the Cup of Ukraine. The city&#x27;s archery team took eighth place at the 2002 championship of Ukraine. Among the city&#x27;s more famous archers are Tamara Literova, Vadim Reznikov, Lyudmila Arzhannikova and Anastasia Pavlova.

Nova Kakhovka has also developed children&#x27;s and youth basketball programs with the assistance of coaches like Dzyubenko N. Z., whose students have represented the city at regional competitions. The city&#x27;s basketball players are part of professional teams in Kyiv, Dnipro, Cherkasy, Odesa, and Poltava.

==Media==
Five weekly newspapers are published in Nova Kakhovka: the &quot;Nova Kakhovka&quot; (founded by the city council) and the private &quot;Novyny Dilovi&quot;, &quot;Klyuchi&quot;, &quot;Dniprovsikyi Prospect&quot; and &quot;Tavriiski chas&quot; publications.

<text>Donald Clayton Spencer (April 25, 1912 – December 23, 2001) was an American mathematician, known for work on deformation theory of structures arising in differential geometry, and on several complex variables from the point of view of partial differential equations. He was born in Boulder, Colorado, and educated at the University of Colorado and MIT.

==Career==
He wrote a Ph.D. in diophantine approximation under J. E. Littlewood and G.H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, completed in 1939. He had positions at MIT and Stanford before his appointment in 1950 at Princeton University. There he was involved in a series of collaborative works with Kunihiko Kodaira on the deformation of complex structures, which had some influence on the theory of complex manifolds and algebraic geometry, and the conception of moduli spaces.

He also was led to formulate the &quot;d-bar Neumann problem&quot;, for the operator formula_1 (see complex differential form) in PDE theory, to extend Hodge theory and the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Cauchy–Riemann equations to the non-compact case. This is used to show existence theorems for holomorphic functions.

He later worked on pseudogroups and their deformation theory, based on a fresh approach to overdetermined systems of PDEs (bypassing the Cartan–Kähler ideas based on differential forms by making an intensive use of jets). Formulated at the level of various chain complexes, this gives rise to what is now called Spencer cohomology, a subtle and difficult theory both of formal and of analytical structure. This is a kind of Koszul complex theory, taken up by numerous mathematicians during the 1960s. In particular a theory for Lie equations formulated by Malgrange emerged, giving a very broad formulation of the notion of &quot;integrability&quot;.

==Legacy==
After his death, a mountain peak outside Silverton, Colorado was named in his honor.

<doc id="724958" wikidata="Q420634" url="?curid=724958" title="Thorium dioxide">
<text>Thorium dioxide (ThO2), also called thorium(IV) oxide, is a crystalline solid, often white or yellow in colour. Also known as thoria, it is mainly a by-product of lanthanide and uranium production. Thorianite is the name of the mineralogical form of thorium dioxide. It is moderately rare and crystallizes in an isometric system. The melting point of thorium oxide is 3300 °C – the highest of all known oxides. Only a few elements (including tungsten and carbon) and a few compounds (including tantalum carbide) have higher melting points. All thorium compounds, including the dioxide, are radioactive because there are no stable isotopes of thorium.

==Structure and reactions==
Thoria exists as two polymorphs. One has a fluorite crystal structure. This is uncommon among binary dioxides. (Other binary oxides with fluorite structure include cerium dioxide, uranium dioxide and plutonium dioxide.) The band gap of thoria is about 6 eV. A tetragonal form of thoria is also known.

Thorium dioxide is more stable than thorium monoxide (ThO). Only with careful control of reaction conditions can oxidation of thorium metal give the monoxide rather than the dioxide. At extremely high temperatures, the dioxide can convert to the monoxide either by a disproportionation reaction (equilibrium with liquid thorium metal) above or by simple dissociation (evolution of oxygen) above .

==Applications==
===Nuclear fuels===
Thorium dioxide (thoria) can be used in nuclear reactors as ceramic fuel pellets, typically contained in nuclear fuel rods clad with zirconium alloys. Thorium is not fissile (but is &quot;fertile&quot;, breeding fissile uranium-233 under neutron bombardment); hence, it must be used as a nuclear reactor fuel in conjunction with fissile isotopes of either uranium or plutonium. This can be achieved by blending thorium with uranium or plutonium, or using it in its pure form in conjunction with separate fuel rods containing uranium or plutonium. Thorium dioxide offers advantages over conventional uranium dioxide fuel pellets, because of its higher thermal conductivity (lower operating temperature), considerably higher melting point, and chemical stability (does not oxidize in the presence of water/oxygen, unlike uranium dioxide).

Thorium dioxide can be turned into a nuclear fuel by breeding it into uranium-233 (see below and refer to the article on thorium for more information on this). The high thermal stability of thorium dioxide allows applications in flame spraying and high-temperature ceramics.

===Alloys===
Thorium dioxide is used as a stabilizer in tungsten electrodes in TIG welding, electron tubes, and aircraft gas turbine engines. As an alloy, thoriated tungsten metal is not easily deformed because the high-fusion material thoria augments the high-temperature mechanical properties, and thorium helps stimulate the emission of electrons (thermions). It is the most popular oxide additive because of its low cost, but is being phased out in favor of non-radioactive elements such as cerium, lanthanum and zirconium.

Thoria-dispersed nickel finds its applications in various high-temperature operations like combustion engines because it is a good creep-resistant material. It can also be used for hydrogen trapping.

===Catalysis===
Thorium dioxide has almost no value as a commercial catalyst, but such applications have been well investigated. It is a catalyst in the Ruzicka large ring synthesis. Other applications that have been explored include petroleum cracking, conversion of ammonia to nitric acid and preparation of sulfuric acid.

===Radiocontrast agents===
Thorium dioxide was the primary ingredient in Thorotrast, a once-common radiocontrast agent used for cerebral angiography, however, it causes a rare form of cancer (hepatic angiosarcoma) many years after administration. This use was replaced with injectable iodine or ingestable barium sulfate suspension as standard X-ray contrast agents.

===Lamp mantles===

Another major use in the past was in gas mantle of lanterns developed by Carl Auer von Welsbach in 1890, which are composed of 99% ThO2 and 1% cerium(IV) oxide. Even as late as the 1980s it was estimated that about half of all ThO2 produced (several hundred tonnes per year) was used for this purpose. Some mantles still use thorium, but yttrium oxide (or sometimes zirconium oxide) is used increasingly as a replacement.

===Glass manufacture===

When added to glass, thorium dioxide helps increase its refractive index and decrease dispersion. Such glass finds application in high-quality lenses for cameras and scientific instruments. The radiation from these lenses can darken them and turn them yellow over a period of years and degrade film, but the health risks are minimal. Yellowed lenses may be restored to their original colourless state by lengthy exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation. Thorium dioxide has since been replaced by rare-earth oxides such as lanthanum oxide in almost all modern high-index glasses, as they provide similar effects and are not radioactive.

<text>Richard Hills (born 22 January 1963) is a retired flat racing jockey, who won six British Classic Races in a 33 year career.

==Career==
Richard James Hills was born in Newmarket, Suffolk on 22 January 1963, along with twin brother Michael who also became a jockey. Their father is former racehorse trainer Barry Hills. The twins&#x27; older brother John Hills was also a trainer. They also have two younger brothers, Charlie Hills (who has succeeded their father Barry as a racehorse trainer) and George Hills who works in the breeding and insurance side of the industry in Kentucky, United States. 

Hills rode his first winner, Border Dawn, at Doncaster on 26 October 1979, a couple of months after Michael has his first. Initially apprenticed to his father, he transferred to Tom Jones, for whom he had won the Yorkshire Cup on Ilium and finished fourth in the Derby on At Talaq.

His first Group 1 winner was Ashal in the Ascot Gold Cup in 1990. He became the second jockey of Hamdan Al Maktoum in 1995, and was promoted to first jockey in 1997 following the retirement of Willie Carson. He used to fill in on spare rides for Godolphin Racing. He retired at the Dubai World Cup on 31 March 2012. On Sky Sports TV coverage, he joked that he retired twice in one day, as the inaugural Dubai Gold Cup in which he was racing had to be re-run, due to a fall by a Godolphin horse, Fox Hunt.

==Personal life==
Richard enjoys breeding ducks, Persian cats and plane spotting.

<text>The Guttenburg was a German brig of 170 tons that was wrecked on the Goodwin Sands on 1 January 1860, resulting in the death of 26 of the 31 people aboard.

==&quot;Canton&quot; survivors==
The &quot;Guttenburg&quot; picked up 14 survivors from the &quot;Canton&quot;, which she had found dis-masted and waterlogged off the coast of Newfoundland. The survivors were later delivered safely into the hands of the Walmer lugger &quot;Cosmopolite&quot; in a chance meeting off the coast of Dover.

==Wreck==
On 1 January 1860, the &quot;Guttenburg&quot; met with hurricane-force winds in thick fog and snow off the Goodwin Sands, which drove the brig onto the South Sand Head where it capsized during the storm. Distress signals were fired but were not seen by the harbor authorities because of the weather.

The Deal boatman Stephen Pritchard sent a telegram to Ramsgate harbor, asking for the lifeboat there to be launched. The lifeboat &quot;Northumberland&quot;, pulled by the Ramsgate steam tugboat &quot;Aid&quot; began to make a rescue attempt, but the boatmen and harbor tug men were prevented from leaving the harbor by the harbormaster, because he had not received the distress call by the proper means, and regulations had not been observed.

This delay resulted in the deaths of 26 passengers and crew (including the Deal pilot, Henry Pearson). The harbormaster was later charged with neglect, but retained his post.

<doc id="724986" wikidata="Q44655" url="?curid=724986" title="Paolo Di Canio">
<text>Paolo Di Canio (born 9 July 1968) is an Italian former professional footballer and manager. During his playing career he made over 500 league appearances and scored over one hundred goals as a forward. He primarily played as a deep-lying forward, but he could also play as an attacking midfielder, or as a winger. Di Canio was regarded as a technically skilled but temperamental player.

Di Canio began his career in the Italian Serie A, playing for Lazio, Juventus, Napoli and Milan, before a brief spell with the Scottish club Celtic. He subsequently spent seven years in the English Premier League with Sheffield Wednesday, West Ham United and Charlton Athletic. He returned to Italy in 2004, playing for Lazio and Cisco Roma before retiring in 2008. He played for the Italian under-21s, making nine appearances and scoring twice, and was a member of the squad that finished in third place at the 1990 UEFA European Under-21 Championship under manager Cesare Maldini, but was never capped for the senior team.

Among the individual awards he received as a player, Di Canio was named SPFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year in 1997 and West Ham&#x27;s player of the season in 2000. However, his career was at times characterised by controversy: he received an eleven-match ban in 1998 for pushing a referee and attracted negative publicity over his allegiance to fascism.

In 2011, Di Canio entered football management in England with Swindon Town, guiding them in his first full season as manager to promotion to League One. He was appointed as the Sunderland manager at the end of March 2013 but was sacked on 22 September after Sunderland had won only three of thirteen games under his managership.

==Early life==
Di Canio was born in Rome, in the district of Quarticciolo, a working-class area populated mainly by Roma fans. However, Di Canio was drawn to their local rivals Lazio. As a young boy, he was addicted to cola and similar drinks and called &quot;Pallocca&quot;, a slang term meaning &quot;lard-ball&quot;. He was fat and knock-kneed, and needed to wear orthopedic shoes – &quot;But I never hid. My response was to exercise; to try to become the kind of person I am.&quot;

==Playing career==
===Italy===
He signed for Lazio in 1985 and remained there until 1990. Lazio won promotion to Serie A in 1988, having narrowly escaped relegation to Serie C1 the year before. He finally made his first-team debut in October 1988 and went on to play 30 games during the 1988–89 season. Di Canio scored the winner in the first Rome derby of the season, a goal which contributed to Lazio&#x27;s survival in Serie A that season and earning him hero status. In 1990, he was sold to another of Italy&#x27;s biggest clubs, Juventus; although he won the UEFA Cup with the Turin side in 1993, he struggled to gain playing time during his tenure with the club, because of the presence of other forwards and creative midfielders in the team, such as Roberto Baggio, Salvatore Schillaci, Pierluigi Casiraghi, Fabrizio Ravanelli, Gianluca Vialli and Andreas Möller. He left Juventus after an &quot;animated exchange&quot; with then manager Giovanni Trapattoni and spent the 1993–94 season with Napoli. Two seasons followed at AC Milan, where, despite winning the Serie A title in 1996, he once again struggled to gain playing time because of heavy competition from his teammates, culminating in another row, this time with Fabio Capello.

===Celtic===
In July 1996 he joined Celtic in Scotland. In his first season at the club, he scored 15 goals in 37 appearances and won the SPFA Player of the Year award. However, his time in Glasgow was dogged by controversy; he was sent off during a 2–2 draw against Hearts in November 1996 and was heavily involved in an acrimonious league match against Rangers in March 1997 where he behaved aggressively towards Ian Ferguson and gestured in the direction of Rangers&#x27; bench as he was led from the field by teammates. He was called to the referee&#x27;s room after the teams had returned to the dressing room and was shown another yellow card in addition to the one he had received earlier in the game. He demanded a large wage rise at the end of the season, but this was rejected by Celtic. He then refused to join the squad in the Netherlands for their pre-season training during July 1997.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
On 6 August 1997, Di Canio moved to the English Premiership as he joined Sheffield Wednesday in a transfer deal valued at around £4.2 million. Whilst in Sheffield, Di Canio was the club&#x27;s leading goal scorer for the 1997–98 season with 14 goals and he became a favourite of the fans.

In September 1998, Di Canio pushed referee Paul Alcock to the ground after being sent off while playing for Sheffield Wednesday against Arsenal at Hillsborough, which resulted in an extended ban of eleven matches. and him being fined £10,000.

===West Ham United===
In January 1999, Di Canio signed for West Ham United for £1.5 million. He had not played football since his ban following his push on Paul Alcock. West Ham manager Harry Redknapp, on signing Di Canio, admitted he was taking a chance but said of the player &quot;He can do things with the ball that people can only dream of&quot;. Di Canio said of his ban, &quot;I made a mistake and I&#x27;m sorry. West Ham have given me a big chance and I&#x27;m very happy.&quot; He scored his first goal for West Ham on 27 February 1999 in his fourth game. Playing against Blackburn Rovers, Di Canio made the first goal in a 2–0 win, for Ian Pearce in the 27th minute and scored the second in the 31st minute. He helped them to achieve a high league position (5th) and qualify for the UEFA Cup through the Intertoto Cup. He was also the OPTA player of the season 1998–99. He scored the BBC Goal of the Season in March 2000 with a flying volley against Wimbledon, which is still considered among the best goals in Premiership history and was named as the Premiership&#x27;s goal of the decade in a December 2009 Sky Sports News viewers&#x27; poll, scoring 30% of votes. In this season he was also voted Hammer of the Year by the club&#x27;s fans.

In December 2000, late in a game against Everton and with both sides vying for the winning goal, Di Canio shunned a goal-scoring opportunity and stopped play, grabbing the ball from a cross inside the box, as the Everton goalkeeper Paul Gerrard was lying injured on the ground after he twisted his knee attempting a clearance on the edge of the box. The Goodison Park crowd reacted with a standing ovation. FIFA officially lauded Di Canio&#x27;s gesture, describing it as &quot;a special act of good sportsmanship,&quot; and awarded him next year the FIFA Fair Play Award.

Sir Alex Ferguson tried to sign him for Manchester United halfway through the 2001–02 season, but his attempts were unsuccessful and Di Canio remained in East London for another season and a half. Di Canio insisted that he would not have been able to leave West Ham, who had handed him a &quot;lifeline&quot; in the &quot;worst moment&quot; in his life.

In 2003, with the Hammers struggling at the bottom of the league, Di Canio had a very public row with manager Glenn Roeder and was dropped from the first team. However, he returned at the end of the season (after Roeder, stricken by a brain tumour, was replaced by Trevor Brooking) and scored a winner against Chelsea in the penultimate game of the season, a game that boosted West Ham&#x27;s chances of staying in the Premiership. However, they were relegated on the final day of the season after a 2–2 draw away to Birmingham City, where Di Canio scored an 89th-minute equaliser. He was released on a free transfer and signed with Charlton Athletic for the start of the 2003–04 season.

===Charlton Athletic===
In his one season at The Valley, Di Canio helped Charlton finish the season in 7th place, the club&#x27;s highest league finish since 1953. However, he only scored four league goals for the Addicks, all of which came from the penalty spot (one from a rebound). One of the penalty kicks was an audacious &quot;Panenka&quot;-style penalty kick against Arsenal. Di Canio also continued to be a provider of goals, however, notably in October 2003 when he came on as a second-half substitute with Charlton trailing 1–0 away at Portsmouth. He provided most of the spark for Charlton&#x27;s much-improved second-half display, and after Jonathan Fortune had equalised for Charlton, it was from Di Canio&#x27;s corner kick in the last minute that Shaun Bartlett headed home the winning goal.

===Return to Italy===
Even though he had already signed an extension to his Charlton contract, in August 2004 he returned to his home team of Lazio, taking a massive pay cut in order to return to the financially stretched Roman team. Lazio fans were happy to have a Rome-bred Lazio supporter in the team again, something missing since the departure of Alessandro Nesta in 2002. He scored in the Rome derby, just as he had in 1989, leading the team to a 3–1 victory over Roma on 6 January 2005. However, the negative publicity that Di Canio generated for Lazio, including his intimate relationship with club&#x27;s ultras and their increased influence due to his presence in the team, coupled with problems with some teammates and coaches, exasperated club president and majority shareholder, Claudio Lotito, with whom he already had a difficult relationship. As a result, Di Canio&#x27;s contract was not renewed in the summer of 2006. During several of his games for Lazio – including during goal celebrations – Di Canio made a fascist salute to their right-wing fans. He subsequently signed with Cisco Roma of Serie C2 on a free transfer. In his first season with Cisco Roma, the team finished second in the league but lost in the play-offs. He subsequently agreed to stay with Cisco for another season, in a second attempt to win promotion to Serie C1 with the Roman side.

On 10 March 2008, Di Canio announced his retirement from football, ending his 23-year playing career before the end of the season because of physical issues. It was his intention to begin coaching lessons at Coverciano to gain a coaching position. In an interview he revealed that his dream would be to manage former club West Ham, and applied for the position after the resignation of Alan Curbishley in September 2008. Di Canio played in Tony Carr&#x27;s testimonial game at Upton Park on 5 May 2010, which featured a West Ham team against West Ham Academy old boys. He played for both sides during the match. The West Ham team won 5–1. In July 2010, in honour of Di Canio, West Ham announced the opening of the Paolo Di Canio Lounge, within the West Stand, at their Upton Park ground, which was formally launched by the unveiling of a plaque by Di Canio himself, on 11 September 2010.

===International===
Di Canio was never capped for Italy at senior level, although at U21 level he earned eleven call-ups and nine caps between 1988 and 1990, scoring twice.

==Style of play==
A versatile attacker, Di Canio primarily played as a deep-lying forward, but he could also play as an attacking midfielder, or as a winger. A talented yet controversial player, Di Canio was predominantly known for his creativity, eye for goal, technical ability, and dribbling skills, as well as his quick feet and intelligent play on the pitch, and was described as having &quot;an eye for the spectacular&quot; by &quot;The Irish Times&quot; in 2001, and as a &quot;mercurial&quot; player by Chris Howie of beIN Sports in 2020; however, he was equally known for being inconsistent and for his temperamental character, as well as his tenacity and aggression on the pitch.

==Managerial career==
===Swindon Town===
On 20 May 2011, Di Canio was appointed manager of Swindon Town on a two-year contract, following the club&#x27;s relegation to League Two. Di Canio began his career as a manager with a 3–0 win over Crewe Alexandra on 6 August 2011. On 30 August 2011, Di Canio was involved in a pitch-side altercation with Swindon striker Leon Clarke after their defeat in the League Cup to Southampton. In January 2012, Swindon caused a FA Cup shock by defeating Premier League club Wigan Athletic 2–1. Di Canio stated that he believed his players deserved to have their names put on the stadium and dedicated the victory to his father, who died late in 2011. He was sent to the stands later in the month in a league game against Macclesfield Town for vociferously venting his frustration at his side not being awarded a free-kick. Swindon won the match 1–0 and with over half the season gone, his team were fighting for promotion to League One.

Under Di Canio, Swindon reached the 2012 Football League Trophy Final, where they were defeated 2–0 by Chesterfield.

On 21 April 2012, Swindon were promoted to the League One after Crawley Town&#x27;s 1–1 draw with Dagenham &amp; Redbridge and Torquay United&#x27;s 2–0 loss to AFC Wimbledon, despite Di Canio&#x27;s side having lost 3–1 to Gillingham on the same day. He dedicated the promotion to his parents, his mother having died shortly after his father in April of that year. One week later, Swindon won the League Two title thanks to an emphatic 5–0 victory over Port Vale. Swindon finished the season on 93 points.

Although in the 2012–13 season, Swindon were knocked out of the FA Cup and the Football League Trophy in their first games against lower-league opposition, they did have a solid run in the League Cup in which they won against three teams from higher leagues. They beat Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 3–0, won against Stoke City 4–3 after extra time, and beat Burnley 3–1 before narrowly missing out against Aston Villa 3–2 at home.

On 18 January 2013, ahead of Swindon&#x27;s Saturday clash with Shrewsbury Town, Di Canio worked into the night alongside approximately 200 volunteers to clear a snow-covered pitch at the County Ground, thus allowing the game to go ahead. He showed his appreciation by ordering the volunteers pizza. Swindon won the match 2–0, which Di Canio publicly deemed a present to the volunteers.

In January 2013, the Swindon Town chairman announced that because of financial difficulties, no money would be made available for future signings. Di Canio offered to pay £30,000 of his own money to keep loan players John Bostock, Chris Martin and Danny Hollands at the club. With the possibility of the club entering administration, a new buyer was found, subject to Football League approval, and without the knowledge of Di Canio, player Matt Ritchie was sold to AFC Bournemouth. Further attempts to sign players by Di Canio were rejected by the Football League because of the club&#x27;s financial situation, with Di Canio &quot;considering his future&quot; at Swindon because of off-field financial problems. In February, Di Canio offered his resignation but said he would withdraw this if approval for the new owners, by the Football League, was received by 18 February. This did not happen, and he resigned as manager of Swindon Town.

===Sunderland===
On 31 March 2013, Sunderland appointed Di Canio as manager on a two-and-a-half-year contract, following the dismissal of Martin O&#x27;Neill the previous day. The appointment prompted the immediate resignation of club vice-chairman David Miliband over Di Canio&#x27;s &quot;past political statements&quot;. The appointment of Di Canio also sparked opposition from the Durham Miners&#x27; Association, which decided to remove one of its mining banners from Sunderland&#x27;s Stadium of Light, which is built on the former site of the Monkwearmouth Colliery, as a symbol of its anger over the appointment. The background to the opposition was past statements made by Di Canio supporting fascism.

Di Canio was tasked with keeping Sunderland in the Premier League, following a run of only three points from a possible 24. His first game as manager of Sunderland resulted in a 2–1 away defeat to Chelsea. Di Canio&#x27;s second game in charge was the Tyne–Wear derby against Newcastle United at St James&#x27; Park on 14 April. Sunderland defeated their fierce rivals 3–0, their first away victory in the fixture in over a decade. Each goal sparked wild celebrations from Di Canio and the Sunderland bench. Di Canio then got his first win at the Stadium of Light against Everton.

Although the team did not win the next three matches, including drawing the final two home games and a heavy 6–1 defeat to Aston Villa, Sunderland secured their Premier League survival when Wigan Athletic were defeated at Arsenal and relegated, trailing then-17th placed Sunderland by four points with only one game to play.

For the 2013–14 season, Di Canio was asked to integrate thirteen players signed by Roberto De Fanti and cope with the loss of experienced players such as Simon Mignolet, James McClean and Stéphane Sessègnon. After five league games, Sunderland had gained only a single point, from an away draw with Southampton. Di Canio was dismissed on 22 September 2013, the day after the fifth match of the season, a 3–0 defeat to West Bromwich Albion, and only his 13th match in charge. Sunderland chief executive officer Margaret Byrne stated that Di Canio had been sacked after senior players had approached her and that his situation became untenable because of his &quot;brutal and vitriolic&quot; criticism of the squad. Di Canio denies this.

===Subsequent managerial links===
Di Canio was linked with the Celtic job in May 2014, and applied for vacant managerial positions at Bolton Wanderers in October 2014, and Rotherham United in September 2015 and again in February 2016.

==Political views==
In 2005, he characterised his political views by declaring that he was &quot;a fascist, not a racist&quot;.

His use of the Roman salute toward Lazio supporters, a gesture adopted by Italian fascists in the 20th century, has created controversy. Documented uses of the salute include in matches against arch-rivals Roma and Livorno, a club inclined to left-wing politics. Di Canio received a one-match ban after the second event and was fined €7,000. He was later quoted as saying, &quot;I will always salute as I did because it gives me a sense of belonging to my people ... I saluted my people with what for me is a sign of belonging to a group that holds true values, values of civility against the standardisation that this society imposes upon us.&quot; His salute has been featured on unofficial merchandise sold outside Stadio Olimpico after the ban.

He has also expressed admiration for the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. In his 2001 autobiography &quot;Paolo Di Canio: l&#x27;Autobiografia&quot; (Paolo Di Canio: The Autobiography), published by &quot;Libreria dello Sport&quot;, he praised Mussolini as &quot;basically a very principled, ethical individual&quot; who was &quot;deeply misunderstood&quot;.

In 2010, Di Canio attended the funeral of senior fascist Paolo Signorelli, where mourners were photographed making mass fascist salutes towards Signorelli&#x27;s coffin. Signorelli had been convicted of involvement in the 1980 Bologna massacre, a neo-fascist terrorist attack which killed 85 people and wounded more than 200.

Di Canio&#x27;s political ideology has been a source of controversy in the course of his managerial career. When Di Canio was appointed as the manager of Swindon Town in 2011, the trade union GMB terminated its sponsorship agreement with the club, worth around £4,000 per season, because of Di Canio&#x27;s fascist views.

He was appointed as manager of Sunderland on 31 March 2013. The club&#x27;s vice-chairman David Miliband, a Labour politician and former foreign secretary, subsequently stepped down. Miliband stated that he had taken the decision to resign &quot;in the light of the new manager&#x27;s past political statements&quot;. It also met opposition from the Durham Miners&#x27; Association, which threatened to remove one of its mining banners from Sunderland&#x27;s Stadium of Light, which is built on the former site of the Wearmouth Colliery, as a symbol of its anger over the appointment.

In a profile piece in 2011, an unnamed source asserted that Di Canio was not &quot;an ideological fascist&quot;, attributing his behaviour to &quot;his psychological history, particularly his former compulsive tendencies and pronounced mood swings&quot;. In the same article, Di Canio said that he was not politically active: &quot;I don&#x27;t vote, I haven&#x27;t voted for 14 years. Italian politicians — all of them — think only about themselves, and making money.&quot;

==Personal life==
Di Canio has several tattoos, including on his right biceps the Latin word &quot;&quot;DUX&quot;, meaning &quot;leader&quot;&quot; or, in Italian, Il Duce—a nickname for Benito Mussolini. Sky Sports Italia was forced to apologise after Di Canio appeared as a pundit in September 2016 in a short-sleeved shirt, thus revealing the tattoo to television viewers; he was later suspended by the station. His back is covered with a tattoo of fascist imagery, including an eagle, fasces, and a portrait of Mussolini. He also has a West Ham United tattoo on his left upper arm and a tattoo of his father on his chest.

Di Canio has spoken also of the growing influence in his life of Samurai culture, and of the Japanese spiritual mentality from reading Mishima, and the teachings in the traditions of Hagakure and Bushido.

<doc id="725017" wikidata="Q3116915" url="?curid=725017" title="Sankardev">
<text>Srimanta Sankardev (, ; 1449–1568) was a 15th–16th century Assamese polymath; a saint-scholar, poet, playwright, dancer, actor, musician, artist social-religious reformer and a figure of importance in the cultural and religious history of the Bhakti movement in Assam. He is credited with building on past cultural relics and devising new forms of music (Borgeet), theatrical performance (Ankia Naat, Bhaona), dance (Sattriya), literary language (Brajavali). Besides, he has left a literary oeuvre of trans-created scriptures (Bhagavat of Sankardev), poetry and theological works written in Sanskrit, Assamese and Brajavali. The Bhagavatic religious movement he started, Ekasarana Dharma and also called Neo-Vaishnavite movement, influenced two medieval kingdoms – Koch and the Ahom kingdom – and the assembly of devotees he initiated evolved over time into monastic centers called Sattras, which continue to be important socio-religious institutions in Assam and to a lesser extent in North Bengal.

His literary and artistic contributions are living traditions in Assam today. The religion he preached is practised by a large population, and Sattras (monasteries) that he and his followers established continue to flourish and sustain his legacy.

==Biography==

After the death of Sankardev, Madhavdev incorporated narrations of his life in prayer services, a practice that was followed by his apostles, and in due course of time a large body of biographical literature arose. These are generally classed in two groups: early (those by Daityari Thakur, Bhusan Dwija, Ramananda Dwija and Vaikuntha Dwija) and late (&quot;Guruvarnana&quot; by Aniruddha Das, the more than one anonymous &quot;Katha-guru-carits&quot;, &quot;Bardowa-carit&quot;, &quot;Sankardev caritra&quot; from Barpeta, the &quot;Saru-svarga-khanda&quot; and &quot;Bar-svarga-khanda&quot; by Sarvabhauma). The authorship of the biography credited to Ramcaran Thakur, Daityari Thakur&#x27;s father, is doubted and it is generally dated to the 17th-century and classed with the late biographies.

In general, all biographies consider Sankardev as an incarnation of Vishnu, including that by Daityari Thakur, the earliest. The late biographies differ from the early group on the count that they ascribe supernatural feats to Sankardev, and describe miraculous events; and there is a tendency to read some events of the Bhagavata into his life.
The biographies are full of contradictions; even though the earlier ones are considered more accurate, not all they claim are true—Daityari Thakur&#x27;s biography, the earliest one, claims Sankardev met with Chaitanya, which is now not accepted to be true.

===Early life: Bordowa===
Sankardev, then named Sankaravara, was born into the Shiromani (chief) &quot;Baro-Bhuyans&quot; family at Bordowa (Alipukhuri, Tembuani) in present-day Nagaon district in c1449. Though some authors have expressed doubt that Sankardev could have lived that long, considering that he was of good health 1449 is generally accepted. The Baro-Bhuyans were independent landlords in Assam, and Sankardev belonged to the Kayastha (Kalita) Hindu caste. His family-members, including parents Kusumvar Bhuyan and Satyasandhya Devi, were Saktas. Sankardev lost his father to smallpox when he was about 7 years old, and his mother died either soon after his birth, or soon after his father&#x27;s death; and he was raised by his grandmother Khersuti.

He began attending Mahendra Kandali&#x27;s &quot;tol&quot; or &quot;chatrasaal&quot; (school) at the age of 12 and soon wrote his first verses &quot;karatala-kamala&quot;. 
The complete poem was written before he was taught the vowels except, of course, the first one, and is often cited as an example of the early flowering of his poetic genius. He stayed at the &quot;tol&quot; during his teens, and studied grammar and Indian scriptures. He practised &quot;yoga&quot; (which he gave up later) and was physically very able, and according to legend, he could swim across the Brahmaputra while it was in spate. It is generally believed that he wrote his first work, &quot;Harishchandra upakhyan&quot;, while at the &quot;tol&quot;. Mahendra Kandali changed his name to &#x27;Sankardev&#x27; while he was at school.

====Bhuyan &quot;shiromaniship&quot;====
Sankardev soon mastered the major scriptures and thereafter left the &quot;tol&quot; in his late teens (c1465) to attend to his responsibilities as the Shiromani Bhuyan. He came to be known as the &quot;Dekagiri&quot; among his subjects and admirers. As Alipukhuri had become crowded, he moved his household from Alipukhuri to Bordowa. He married his first wife Suryavati when he was in his early 20s and a daughter, Manu, was born in about three years, but his wife died about nine months later.

====First pilgrimage====
It is possible that the death of his wife increased his already existing spiritual inclination and he left for a twelve-year-long pilgrimage, sometime after his daughter was married to Hari, a Bhuyan scion. He handed over the maintenance of his household to his son-in-law Hari; the Bhuyan Shiromaniship to his grand uncles Jayanta and Madhav; and began his journey in 1481. He was accompanied by seventeen others including his friend and associate Ramaram and his teacher Mahendra Kandali. At this point of time, he was 32. The pilgrimage took him to Puri, Mathura, Dwaraka, Vrindavan, Gaya, Rameswaram, Ayodhya, Sitakunda and almost all the other major seats of the Vaishnavite religion in India. He seem to have spent many years at Jagannath-kshetra at Puri, where he read and explained the Brahma Purana to the priests and lay people. At Badrikashram in 1488, he composed his first &quot;borgeet&quot;—&quot;mana meri ram charanahi lagu&quot;—in Brajavali. According to Katha Gurucharit, the first Borgeet was &quot;Rama meri hridaya pankaje baise&quot; and he composed it in 1481 at the very outset of the pilgrimage at a place called Rowmari. He returned home to Alipukhuri after 12 years (his family had moved back from Bordowa in his absence). During his pilgrimage, he became the part of a pan-Indian Bhakti movement and helped it blossom.

====&quot;Shiromaniship&quot; refusal====
On his return from his pilgrimage (c1493), Sankardev refused to take back the Shiromaniship, though on the insistence of his elders, he took responsibility of a hundred families (&quot;gomastha&quot;) but he soon handed over the responsibility to his son-in-law Hari. On his grandmother&#x27;s insistence, he married Kalindi at the age of 54. Finally, he moved back to Bordowa and constructed a temple (&quot;devagriha&quot;) in c1498, possibly a thatched house, built on the original site of his father&#x27;s house where he could meet with people, discuss religious matters and hold prayers, and preach. He wrote &quot;Bhakti pradipa&quot; and &quot;Rukmini harana&quot;. Soon after, he received a copy of the Bhagavata Purana from Jagadisa Mishra of Mithila, with Sridhara Swami&#x27;s monistic commentary &quot;Bhavartha-dipika&quot;. Mishra recited and explained the entire Bhagavata in the presence of Sankardev and this event is considered critical in the development of Ekasarana. Datyari, an early biographer of Sankardev writes: Sankardev listened with rapt attention to the exposition by Jagadish Mishra and realised that the &quot;Bhagavata&quot; was a scripture without parallel, a scripture that determined Krishna as the only God, &quot;naam&quot; as the real dharma, and &quot;aikantika-sarana&quot; and &quot;sat-sanga&quot; as the indispensable elements of the faith.&quot; He also began composing the &quot;Kirtana ghosha&quot;.

====&quot;Cihna-yatra&quot;====

After his exposure to the detailed Bhagavata Purana and Sridhara Swami&#x27;s commentary &quot;Bhavartha-dipika&quot;, Sankardev produced a dance-drama called &quot;Cihna yatra&quot;, for which he painted the &quot;Sapta vaikuntha&quot; (seven heavens), guided the making of musical instruments and played the instruments himself. According to other biographers, Sankardev produced &quot;Maha-nata&quot; in the presence of Jagdish Mishra in the temple he had constructed at Alipukhuri.

According to Neog, this was the point when Sankardev decided to preach a new religion. Some of the first to be initiated into this religion was the wife of Jayanta-dalai, a leper named Hariram (later Tulasiram), Ramaram his associate and Mahendra Kandali, his &quot;tol&quot; teacher. The 13 years at Alipukhuri was the period during which he reflected on Vaishnavism and on the form that would suit the spiritual and ethical needs of the people. Ananta Kandali, a profound scholar of Sanskrit, became his disciple during this time; he translated the later part of Canto X of the Bhagavata Purana after consulting Sankardev.

From Alipukhuri Sankardev moved back to Bordowa in 1509 and built a &quot;thaan&quot;. Some authors claim that this &quot;than&quot; had all the major features of a sattra (central &quot;kirtanghar&quot;, &quot;cari-hati&quot; etc.), whereas many others assert that these features did not exist during Sankardev&#x27;s time. This &quot;than&quot; was abandoned and more than a hundred years later in the middle of the 17th-century, Sankardev&#x27;s granddaughter-in-law, Kanaklata, established it again.

===Ahom kingdom===

====Gangmau====
Biswa Singha, began his activities to remove the Bhuyans from power in the western part of the Brahmaputra valley in 1509. Furthermore, the Bhuyans in the Bordowa area picked up a quarrel with their Kachari neighbours, and when attacked Sankardev advised the Bhuyans to move, which brought to an end the independence of this group of Bhuyans. Sankardev and his associates first crossed the Brahmaputra river in 1516–17 and settled first at Singari and finally at Routa; and when Viswa Singha advanced towards Routa, Sankardev moved to Gangmau in the Ahom kingdom in 1527. At Gangmau they stayed for five years where Sankardev&#x27;s eldest son Ramananda was born. At Gangmau, he wrote the drama &quot;Patniprasad&quot;. In fact he lived alone at a place named Gajalasuti out of dissatisfaction with some relative. He penned the play there.

====Dhuwahat====
While at Gangmau, the Koch king Biswa Singha attacked the Ahoms. The Bhuyans fought for the Ahoms and the Koch king was defeated. Due to the unsettled situation at Gangmau Sankardev next moved to Dhuwahat, near Ahatguri in present-day Majuli, washed away by the Brahmaputra in 1913. The Bhuyans were settled here by the Ahoms with land and estate, Hari, Sankardev&#x27;s son-in-law became a Saikia, and his cousin Jagatananda, grandson of Jayanta received a title &#x27;Ramarai&#x27;. At Dhuwahat, he met his spiritual successor Madhavdev. Madhavdev, a sakta, got into a religious altercation with his brother-in-law Ramadas who had recently converted to Vaishnavism. Ramadas took him to Sankardev, who, after a long debate, convinced him of the power and the efficacy of &quot;Ekasarana&quot;. The acquisition of Madhavdev, with his talent in poetry, singing and dedication to his new-found religion and guru, was a significant event in the &quot;Ekasarana&quot; history. At Dhuwahat he managed to attract a wider attention and popularity and he initiated many others into his religion.

The popularity of Ekasarana and the conversion of people alarmed the priestly Brahmins, who reacted with anger and hostility. Sankardev tried to diffuse their hostility—by meeting with them at the house of his relative Budha-Khan and asking his Brahmin antagonists to install a wooden idol of Jagannath, called Madan-Mohan, at his religious seat. (Sankardev left this idol hanging on a tree when he took flight from Dhuwahat, and it was rescued years later by Vamshigopaldev and installed at Deberapar-sattra). The Brahmins finally complained to the Ahom king, Suhungmung (1497–1539), who summoned Sankardev to his court for a debate with them. Sankardev was able to convince the king that he was not a religious rebel and a threat to the social order, and the charges against him were dropped. The hostility, nevertheless, continued.

=====&quot;Flight from Dhuwahat&quot;=====
Though the positions of the Bhuyans in the Ahom kingdom began comfortably—with Sankardev&#x27;s son-in-law, Hari, becoming a Paik officer and Ramrai, his cousin, becoming a royal official—the relationship gradually deteriorated. After the death of Viswasingha, who was inimical to the Bhuyans, and the rise of Naranarayan (1540), the Koch-Bhuyan relationship improved somewhat. Sometime in the 1540s during the reign of Suklenmung (1539–1552) a royal officer visited the region for an elephant capturing expedition. Hari did not make himself available and furthermore, an elephant escaped through a barrier managed by the Bhuyans. The officer took grave offence in this dereliction of duty and arrested Hari as well as Madhavdev. At Garhgaon, Hari was executed and Madhavdev interned for about a year. According to Daityari, taking advantage of the Koch advance against the Ahoms (1546–1547), Sankardev and his followers escaped from the Ahom kingdom as they fell behind the vanguard of the Koch army setting up their garrison in Narayanpur further to the east.

===Koch kingdom===

====Sunpora====
Sankardev and his followers reached Kapalabari in Koch kingdom in later part of 1540 and put up there. But the water was very alkaline there. Several members including Madhavdev&#x27;s mother Manorama died there. So after staying for some time at Kapalabari, Sankardev and his group moved to Sunpora in 1541. At Sunpora Sankardev initiated Bhavananda, a rich trader who had extensive business interest in the Garo Hills and Bhutan Hills besides Kamarupa. The trader, Narayana Das, settled at Janiya near Barpeta and took to agriculture. A man of the world otherwise, he soon flourished and became a provider to Sankardev and his devotees. He came to be known popularly as Thakur Ata.

====Patbausi====
After moving around, Sankardev settled at Patbausi near Barpeta in the Koch Kingdom and constructed a &quot;Kirtanghar&quot; (house of prayer). Some of the people he initiated here are Chakrapani Dwija and Sarvabhaum Bhattacharya, Brahmins; Govinda, a Garo; Jayaram, a Bhutia; Madhai, a Jaintia; Jatiram, an ascetic; and Murari, a Koch. Damodardev, a Brahmin, was initiated by Sankardev. Damodardev was entrusted by Sankardev to initiate Brahmin disciples. A Sattra was also constructed for him at Patbausi itself. Later Damodardev became the founder of the Brahma Sanghati sect of Sankardev&#x27;s religion.

Among Sankardev&#x27;s literary works, he completed his rendering of the Bhagavata Purana and wrote other independent works. He continued composing the Kirtan Ghosha, further translated the first canto of the Ramayana (&quot;Adi Kanda&quot;) and instructed Madhavdev to translate the last canto (&quot;Uttara Kanda&quot;), portions that were left undone by the 14th century poet Madhav Kandali. He wrote four plays: &quot;Rukmini harana&quot;, &quot;Parijata harana&quot;, &quot;Keligopala&quot; and &quot;Kalidamana&quot;. Another play written at Patbausi, &quot;Kansa Vadha&quot;, is lost. At Patbausi, he had lent his Bargeets numbering around 240 to Kamala Gayan. But unfortunately, Gayan&#x27;s house was gutted and most of the &quot;borgeets&quot; were lost. Since that incident Sankardev stopped composing &quot;Bargeets&quot;. Of the 240, 34 remain today.

====Second Pilgrimage====
Sankardev once again left for a pilgrimage in 1550 with a large party of 117 disciples that included Madhavdev, Ramrai, Ramaram, Thakur Ata and others. Thakur Ata had to return after just one day&#x27;s journey. Madhavdev had to take entire responsibility of logistics. He on the request of Sankardev&#x27;s wife Kalindi urged him to return from Puri and not proceed to Vrindavana. Sankardev and the group returned to Patbausi within six months in 1551.

====Koch capital and Bheladanga====
On receiving repeated complaints that Sankardev was corrupting the minds of the people by spreading a new religion Nara Narayan, the Koch king, ordered Sankardev&#x27;s arrest, and Sankardev went into hiding. Chilarai—the general of the Koch army, half-brother of the king and married to Kamalapriya the daughter of Sankardev&#x27;s cousin Ramarai—then convinced the king to give Sankardev a hearing instead.

For the audience with Nara Narayan, as he moved up the steps to the court, Sankardev sang his Sanskrit &quot;totaka&quot; hymn, composed extempore, to Lord Krishna &quot;madhu daanava daarana deva varam&quot;

and as he sat down, he sang a &quot;borgeet&quot;, &quot;narayana kahe bhakati karu tera&quot;, playing on the name of the king. At the debate with the court pundits that followed, Sankardev was able to refute all allegations against him. The king declared him free and furthermore honored him with a seat close to the throne. Sankardev began to attend Naranarayana&#x27;s court regularly, and received the freedom to propagate his teachings.

Chilarai was instrumental in keeping Sankardev safe and supporting his work. Many of Sankardev&#x27;s literary and dramatic works were completed in his domain with his patronage and protection. Sankardev acknowledged his appreciation in his play &#x27;Ram Vijaya&#x27;.

Sankardev shuttled between Koch Behar the capital and Patbausi his seat. He was often hosted by Chilarai, and on his request agreed to have the images of the childhood days of krishna at Vrindavan woven on cloth. He engaged the weavers of Tantikuchi, near Barpeta, to weave a forty-yard long tapestry panel. Sankaradeva provided the designs to be woven, chose the various colours of thread to be used, and supervised the weaving. It took about a year to complete and, deriving its name from its theme, came to be known as the Vrindavani vastra. It was presented to Chilarai and Naranarayan. A section of this cloth is preserved now in the Victoria and Albert museum in London.

Chandsai, a Muslim tailor serving the Koch king became a disciple of Sankardev at Kochbehar. When Sankardev returned to Patbausi some time later, Chandsai too came with the saint. Sankardev frequented the capital for more than 20 years and enjoyed unstinted royal patronage for the first time.

====End====
He made arrangements with Madhavdev and Thakur Ata and gave them various instructions at Patbausi and left the place for the last time. He set up his home at Bheladonga in Kochbehar. During his stay at Kochbehar, Maharaja Naranarayana expressed his wish to be initiated. Sankardev was reluctant to convert a king and declined to do so. (According to one of the biographers Ramcharan Thakur) A painful boil; a &quot;visha phohara&quot; – had appeared in some part of his body and this led to the passing away of the Saint. Thus, in 1568, after leading a most eventful life dedicated to enlightening humanity; the &quot;Mahapurusha&quot; breathed his last – after four months of his last stay at Bheladonga– aged 120.

==&quot;Ekasarana&quot;==
Sankardev preached devotion (&quot;bhakti&quot;) to Krishna consisting primarily in the singing (&quot;kirtan&quot;) and listening to (&quot;sravan&quot;) of his deeds and activities. &quot;Ekasarana&quot; follows the &quot;dasya&quot; attitude (&quot;bhava&quot;) of worship in which the devotee considers himself to be a servant of God. In contrast to other Vaishnava schools, Radha is not worshiped along with Krishna.

The people who practice his religion are referred to variously as &quot;Mahapurushia&quot;, &quot;Sarania&quot; and &quot;Sankari&quot;.

Srimanta Sankardev started a system of initiation (&quot;Sarana&quot;) into his religion. He caused a social revolution by fighting against the caste discrimination prevailing at that time. He initiated people of all castes and religions, including Muslims. After initiation, the devotee is expected to adhere to the religious tenets of &quot;Ekasarana&quot; consisting in worship to one God, Krishna, and offering devotion to him, forsaking all forms of Vedic rites.

Though he himself married twice, had children and led the life of a householder, his disciple Madhavdev did not. Some of his followers today follow celibate life (&quot;kevaliya bhakat&quot;) in the Vaishnavite monasteries – the &quot;sattras&quot;.

Sankardev&#x27;s famous debate with Madhavdev, who was a staunch sakta (devotee of Shakti) earlier, and Madhavdev&#x27;s subsequent induction into Ekasarana, is often cited as the single most epoch-making event in the history of the neo-Vaishnavite movement in Assam. Madhavdev, an equally multi-talented person, became his celebrated disciple.

==Literary works==
Sankardev produced a large body of work. Though there were others before him who wrote in the language of the common man – Madhav Kandali who translated the Ramayana into Assamese in the 14th century – This was the first ramayana to be written in a modern Indian language – Harihara Vipra and Hema Saraswati, it was Sankardev who opened the floodgates and inspired others like Madhavdev to carry on where he left off.

His language is lucid, his verses lilting, and he infused &quot;bhakti&quot; into everything he wrote. His magnum opus is his &quot;Kirtana-ghosha&quot;, a work so popular that even today it is found in many household in Assam. It contains narrative verses glorifying Krishna meant for community singing. It is a &quot;bhakti kayva&quot; par excellence, written in a lively and simple language, it has &quot;stories and songs for amusement [for children], it delights the young with true poetic beauty and elderly people find here religious instruction and wisdom&quot;.

For most of his works, he used the Assamese language of the period so the lay person could read and understand them. But for dramatic effect in his songs and dramas he used Brajavali.

Other literary works include the rendering of eight books of the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; including the &quot;Adi Dasama&quot; (Book X), &quot;Harishchandra-upakhyana&quot; (his first work), &quot;Bhakti-pradip&quot;, the &quot;Nimi-navasiddha-samvada&quot; (conversation between King Nimi and the nine Siddhas), &quot;Bhakti-ratnakara&quot; (Sanskrit verses, mostly from the Bhagavata, compiled into a book), &quot;Anadi-patana&quot; (having as its theme the creation of the universe and allied cosmological matters), Gunamala and many plays like &quot;Rukmini haran&quot;, &quot;Patni prasad&quot;, &quot;Keli gopal&quot;, &quot;Kurukshetra yatra&quot; and &quot;Srirama vijaya&quot;. There was thus a flowering of Bhakti literature during his long life of 120 years.

* &quot;Ramayana&quot; (&quot;Uttarakanda&quot;, supplemental to Madhav Kandali&#x27;s Saptakanda Ramayana)
His translation of the &quot;Bhagavata&quot; is a transcreation, because he translates not just the words but the idiom and the physiognomy too. He has adapted the original text to the local land and people and importantly for the purpose of bhakti. Portions of the original were left out or elaborated where appropriate. For example, he suppressed the portions that revile the lowers caste of &quot;sudra&quot; and &quot;kaivartas&quot;, and extols them elsewhere.

Sankardev was the fountainhead of the &quot;Ankiya naat&quot;, a form of one-act play. His &quot;Cihna Yatra&quot; is regarded as one of the first open-air theatrical performances in the world. &quot;Cihna yatra&quot; was probably a dance drama and no text of that show is available today. Innovations like the presence of a &quot;Sutradhara&quot; (narrator) on the stage, use of masks etc., were used later in the plays of Bertolt Brecht and other eminent playwrights.

These cultural traditions still form an integral part of the heritage of the Assamese people.

===Songs===
* &quot;Borgeet&quot; (composed 240, but only 34 exist now)
* &quot;Bhatima&quot;
** &quot;Deva bhatima&quot; – panegyrics to God
** &quot;Naat bhatima&quot; – for use in dramas
** &quot;Raja bhatima&quot; – panegyrics to king Nara Narayan

He is a musician; All his creations were orienting to the Vishanav religion and one set of them is called &#x27;Holy Songs&#x27;, which are known as &#x27;Borgeet(Bargit or Bargeet)&#x27; till today in Assam.

The &quot;Borgeets&quot; (literally: great songs) are devotional songs, set to music and sung in various &quot;raga&quot; styles. These styles are slightly different from either the Hindustani or the Carnatic styles. The songs themselves are written in the &#x27;Brajavali&#x27; language.

===Dance===
Sattriya dance, that Sankardev first conceived and developed and which was later preserved for centuries by the &quot;sattras&quot;, is now among the classical dance forms of India. Although certain devout Sankarite calls this form as Sankari dance

===Visual Art===
* &quot;Sapta vaikuntha&quot; – part of the &quot;Cihna yatra&quot; production, does not exist today.
* &quot;Vrindavani vastra&quot; – parts of this work are preserved in London.
The famous &quot;Vrindavani Vastra&quot;—the cloth of Vrindavan—a 120 x 60 cubits tapestry depicted the &quot;lilas&quot; of Lord Krishna at Vrindavan through richly woven and embroidered designs on silk. A specimen, believed to be a part of this work, is at the Association pour l&#x27;Etude et la Documentation des Textiles d&#x27;Asie collection at Paris (inv. no. 3222).
The &quot;vastra&quot;, commissioned by Koch king Naranarayana, was woven by 12 master weavers in Barpeta under the supervision of Sankardev over a period of six-month and completed towards the end of 1554. This textile art depicted the life and deeds of lord Krishna, who is worshipped in Eka Sarana Nama Dharma. The cloth was housed in the royal court of Kochbehar after the saint presented it to the king; but it disappeared at some point. It is believed that parts of this cloth made its way to Tibet and from there to its present place.

<text>Robert Newton Peck (February 17, 1928June 23, 2020) was an American author who specialized in children&#x27;s and young adult literature. His works include &quot;A Day No Pigs Would Die&quot;, &quot;Millie&#x27;s Boy&quot;, and the &quot;Soup&quot; series.

== Early life ==

Robert Newton Peck was reticent to discuss his early life, perhaps because the reality was in a number of respects different from statements he made and from the picture portrayed in his novels. Peck gave his birth date as February 17, 1928, but typically refused to specify where he was born. His place of birth was Ticonderoga, New York, as is recorded in state archives and published in the local newspaper. Peck&#x27;s parents, Frank Haven Peck, a widower, and Lucile Dornburgh, both of Ticonderoga, were married in 1923 in Glens Falls, New York. At his birth, Peck was named for his two deceased grandfathers, Robert Dornburgh, a prominent attorney, and Newton Peck, who was trained as a medical doctor but later became a clothing merchant. At the time of Peck&#x27;s birth, the family consisted of Peck, his parents, and two half sisters, Marian and Molly, who were several years older than Robert. (Two older half sisters had married before Robert was born.) By the fall of 1930, however, his mother had filed for a separation, though both parents continued to live in Ticonderoga; a divorce was granted in early 1933. From about the age of two, Peck and his mother lived in the home of her deceased parents, along with her sister, Caroline (&quot;Carrie&quot;) Dornburgh. Lucile was the homemaker, and Carrie worked as a business secretary and stenographer. During the early years of the Great Depression, Lucile and Caroline attempted to sell the family home, not a &quot;farm&quot; but a town lot with two adjoining half lots (about a third of an acre). They were apparently unsuccessful, for the property was foreclosed upon by the Ticonderoga National Bank six years later, when Robert was nine, though the family continued on in the home as renters for about four more years. When Peck was about thirteen, he and his mother moved to Glens Falls, New York, for a couple years before returning to Ticonderoga.

Peck indicated that he was born and grew up in Vermont, as in his semi-autobiographical novels. Though Peck and his mother briefly lived in Bennington, Vermont, before he entered the military, the only verified family connection to Vermont comes through his paternal grandparents, who died before Peck was born. The grandfather, Newton Peck, was originally from Cornwall, Vermont, and had moved to Ticonderoga and married there shortly before the 1875 birth of Peck&#x27;s father. Newton Peck&#x27;s wife, Mary Haven, had family connections to Shoreham, Vermont, adjacent to Cornwall and directly across Lake Champlain from Ticonderoga. It was not only his grandparents that Peck did not know; he claimed later in life that he had never known his father, who died when Robert was twelve. In contrast to the narrative in the semi-autobiographical &quot;A Day No Pigs Would Die&quot;, Peck&#x27;s father was not a pig farmer but had been proprietor of his father&#x27;s clothing business and during Robert&#x27;s childhood he was an insurance and real estate agent. Robert&#x27;s father&#x27;s home at that time had belonged to Newton Peck, the doctor and merchant, and had previously been the property of Newton Peck&#x27;s father-in-law, who had been a cooper. As with Peck&#x27;s mother&#x27;s family home, his father&#x27;s was also lost to a bank foreclosure during the Great Depression. Whether there was involvement in Shakerism in Peck&#x27;s family, as indicated in &quot;A Day No Pigs Would Die&quot;, is unlikely. There were no Shaker communities in Vermont, nor in Ticonderoga, and Peck has been criticized for his inaccurate depiction of Shaker belief and practice (for example, in reality Shakers were unmarried, held their property communally, and did not keep pets). The obituaries of his parents and grandparents instead indicate family ties to Congregationalism and Methodism.

== Education, military service, and early career ==

Peck attended Weedville School (grades 1–4), and Central School (grades 5–7), both in Ticonderoga. He attended high school at Ticonderoga High School, also in Glens Falls, New York, and in Bennington, Vermont, where he graduated in June 1945. From Bennington, he was accepted for military induction at age 17 following his high school graduation. World War II was then still in progress, but the surrenders of Germany and Japan had both occurred by the time Peck was out of training. Fighting was still taking place, nevertheless, and he served as a private from 1945 to 1947 in the U.S. Army, including time in the 88th Infantry Division and as a machine-gunner in Italy defending the Morgan Line. After his term of duty was completed and he had returned home, Peck took on a variety of jobs. He worked in a saw mill, did farm work, worked in a lumber camp, in a paper pulp mill, and found jobs playing piano. Peck entered Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont, in the fall of 1948. He spent a year there, including a period of work-study in Albany, New York. The following year, he transferred to Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, after a football scout, apparently interested in Peck due to his size (6&#x27; 4&quot;), urged him to apply for educational funding through the G.I. Bill. At Rollins, in addition to his academics, Peck kept busy with sports, drama, playing piano, and writing. He was known in school for his sense of humor in class and his love of horses. He graduated with a B.A. in English in 1953, and the next fall he entered Cornell Law School. He did not complete his studies, however, due to the lack of financial resources. Following his time at Cornell, Peck tried his hand at several creative endeavors (writing songs and jingles, comedy) until settling into the field of advertising in New York City in 1954. He worked in advertising with &quot;Parents Magazine&quot; in New York, with Curtis Publishing Company in Cleveland, Ohio, and with American Home Products in New York City, commuting from Darien, Connecticut. He had a record album of satirical music released in 1957, &quot;Moth in a Gray Flannel Suit.&quot; He left advertising in 1974, following the success of his first novels, and in 1977 Peck and his family moved to Florida where he devoted more time to writing.

== Writing ==

Peck was steered toward writing by one of his mentors at Rollins College, Edwin Granberry, after Granberry read some of Peck&#x27;s written work. He published his first novel, &quot;A Day No Pigs Would Die&quot;, in 1972 at the age of 44. The book, which became a best seller, was written while Peck commuted on the train between his home in Connecticut and his job in New York City. He had published a much less well-known book, &quot;The Happy Sadist&quot;, ten years earlier, a satirical work which he called &quot;a sort of unprofound autobiography&quot;. His body of work comprises nearly sixty children&#x27;s and young adult titles, six nonfiction works, thirty-five songs, three television specials, and over one hundred poems. His &quot;Soup&quot; series, another semi-autobiographical work, was immensely popular and ran to nearly twenty separate titles and was adapted for television in 1978. In 2005 he published an atypical autobiography, &quot;Weeds in Bloom: Autobiography of an Ordinary Man&quot;, composed of a series of vignettes of various times, places, and people in his life. Peck also authored three books on the craft of writing as well as giving workshops and occasionally teaching writing both at Rollins and at Manhattanville College. He served as Director of Rollins College Writers Conference, 1977–1982. Peck&#x27;s novels won numerous awards throughout his career, including the Mark Twain Readers Award in 1981 for &quot;Soup for President&quot;, and inclusion in the American Library Association&#x27;s Best Books for Young Adults for &quot;A Day No Pigs Would Die&quot; in 1973. While &quot;A Day No Pigs Would Die&quot; is certainly Peck&#x27;s most famous work, and has been published in over 40 countries, it has also been the target of censorship due to some of its graphic descriptions. Rights to the book, as well as his novel &quot;Millie&#x27;s Boy&quot;, were purchased by Twentieth Century Fox for film adaptations, but were never produced.

== Personal life ==

In 1958 Peck married Dorothy Anne Houston, a Columbia University graduate and librarian, and they were the parents of two children: Christopher who was born in 1968, and Anne born in 1971. Christopher died July 31, 2011, at the age of 43. 
 Fred Rogers, a classmate at Rollins College, was an usher at the Peck&#x27;s wedding and, according to Peck, the godfather to his children. Robert and Dorothy divorced in 1994. His second marriage was to Sharon &quot;Sam&quot; Michael in 1995.
In 1984, Peck was sued by Mary Jo Wardlaw, an Erskine College student, for outrageous conduct causing severe emotional distress and slander, for comments he made during a convocation speech at the college. The day before the speech, Wardlaw had failed to pick up Peck from the airport. Upset at having been made to wait, Peck pointed to Wardlaw during his speech and referred to her as &quot;Mary Jo Warthog&quot; or &quot;Warthog.&quot; As the court noted,

:He likened her to a fictitious character in his books called &quot;Janice,&quot; who he said was the &quot;bully of his childhood.&quot; He described &quot;Janice&quot; as &quot;built like a garbage truck&quot; with &quot;fists like cannonballs&quot; and said she walked hunched over with her fists dangling before her so her left arm swung over her left leg and her right arm swung over her right leg. He said Mary Jo Wardlaw was late to the airport because she walked like &quot;Janice.&quot; He then mimicked Wardlaw&#x27;s supposed walk by walking across the stage in front of the convocation audience in an ape-like position.

A South Carolina appeals court upheld a $24,000 jury verdict against Peck on the theory that when Peck cast aspersions upon Wardlaw&#x27;s chastity, his public remarks were slanderous per se.

In 1993, Peck was diagnosed with cancer of the larynx, but overcame the disease. Peck lived with his wife in Longwood, Florida, and died there in 2020.

<text>Soup is a 1974 children&#x27;s novel by American author Robert Newton Peck. It is the first book in the series.

Its main characters are two boys, Robert (the narrator) and his close friend Luther, better known as &quot;Soup&quot;. It takes place during the 1930s in a small town in Vermont, and deals with the daily lives of the main characters. Soup is a well-meaning, but mischievous schemer, constantly coming up with elaborate plans that invariably land him and Robert in trouble. Robert is more sensible but less wily, and frequently finds himself conned into doing Soup&#x27;s dirty work. However, they are best friends and watch out for one another. Their frequent villains are school bully Janice Riker and Eddy Tacker. Robert is also shown to have a crush on classmate Norma Jean Bissel. 

Typical moments include the boys losing their clothes and stealing more from a rummage sale that only has clothing for women, or Soup painting his name on a barn without permission and running the &quot;p&quot; over onto the corner, causing the farmer to yell &quot;&#x27;Souf&#x27;! I&#x27;ll get you &#x27;Souf&#x27;!&quot;

There are several sequels to this book, including &quot;Soup and Me&quot;, &quot;Soup for President&quot;, &quot;Soup on Fire&quot;, &quot;Soup&#x27;s Hoop&quot;, and &quot;Soup 1776&quot;. &quot;Soup and Me&quot; and &quot;Soup For President&quot; were adapted into half-hour television episodes starring Christian Berrigan and Shane Sinutko for the series &quot;The ABC Weekend Special&quot;. The author, Robert Newton Peck, also wrote the popular book &quot;A Day No Pigs Would Die&quot;.

<text>The Toy Fox Terrier is a small terrier breed of dog, directly descended from the larger Smooth Fox Terrier but since 1936, it has been registered in the United States with the UKC as a separate breed.

== Description ==

===Appearance===

Toy Fox Terriers are small dogs with a muscular and athletic appearance. Notable characteristic traits include a short glossy and predominantly white coat, coupled with a predominantly solid head, and a short, high-set tail. The breed has been deemed elegant and graceful with V-shaped ears and large eyes. The tail can be short and straight or long and shiny, and breeders often shorten the tail a few days after birth by clipping it about three-fifths of the way from the tip (at the third or fourth joint). The coat is short, fine, and glossy in black with tan, with areas of tan on the face; there are two other variants, one with &#x27;chocolate&#x27; replacing the black in areas (the UKC does not allow this variant to be shown), another which is all white with tan and no black at all, and one which is white with black markings and no tan accents. These variants are often known as &#x27;Tri-Color&#x27;, &#x27;Chocolate&#x27;, and &#x27;White and Tan&#x27;, and &#x27;White and Black&quot; respectively. The height ranges from 8.5–11.5 inches at the shoulder (21.5–29.2 cm) and weight from 3.5–9 kg.

===Temperament===
Toy Fox Terriers were used commonly in circus shows by clowns, and they are said to make great companions for owners with a good sense of humor. As a terrier breed, they are often active, though perhaps not as active as the Jack Russell Terrier, and are said to be well suited for older owners. They are quite trainable and often cited as making wonderful companions for people with disabilities. They are also very lovable and loyal to their owners. In addition, dogs of this breed tend not to bark very much if they are trained well.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 12.9 years from a sample of 52 deaths for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.
Toy Fox Terriers, like other toy breeds are prone to patellar luxation (slipped stifle), Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome and von Willebrand disease.

==History==
Some Toy Fox Terrier breeders can trace their dogs&#x27; lineage back to a Smooth Fox Terrier called &quot;Foiler&quot;, the first fox terrier registered by the Kennel Club in Britain, circa 1875–76. It is believed that careful breeding from smaller Smooth Fox Terriers without crosses to other toy breeds such as Manchester Terrier and Chihuahua resulted in the Toy Fox Terrier of today.

Toy Fox Terriers were recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in 1936 and placed in the Terrier Group, and by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 2003 (Toy Group).

<doc id="725041" wikidata="Q1066061" url="?curid=725041" title="Diverticulitis">
<text>Diverticulitis, also called colonic diverticulitis, is a gastrointestinal disease characterized by inflammation of abnormal pouches—diverticula—that can develop in the wall of the large intestine. Symptoms typically include lower abdominal pain of sudden onset, but the onset may also occur over a few days. There may also be nausea, diarrhea or constipation. Fever or blood in the stool suggests a complication. People may experience a single attack, repeated attacks, or ongoing &quot;smoldering&quot; diverticulitis.
The causes of diverticulitis are unclear. Risk factors may include obesity, lack of exercise, smoking, a family history of the disease, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The role of a low fiber diet as a risk factor is unclear. Having pouches in the large intestine that are not inflamed is known as diverticulosis. Inflammation occurs between 10% and 25% at some point in time and is due to a bacterial infection. Diagnosis is typically by CT scan, though blood tests, colonoscopy, or a lower gastrointestinal series may also be supportive. The differential diagnoses include irritable bowel syndrome.
Preventive measures include altering risk factors such as obesity, inactivity, and smoking. Mesalazine and rifaximin appear useful for preventing attacks in those with diverticulosis. Avoiding nuts and seeds as a preventive measure is no longer recommended since there is no evidence these play a role in initiating inflammation in the diverticula. For mild diverticulitis, antibiotics by mouth and a liquid diet are recommended. For severe cases, intravenous antibiotics, hospital admission, and complete bowel rest may be recommended. Probiotics are of unclear value. Complications such as abscess formation, fistula formation, and perforation of the colon may require surgery.
The disease is common in the Western world and uncommon in Africa and Asia. In the Western world about 35% of people have diverticulosis while it affects less than 1% of those in rural Africa, and 4–15% of those may go on to develop diverticulitis. In North America and Europe the abdominal pain is usually on the left lower side (sigmoid colon), while in Asia it is usually on the right (ascending colon). The disease becomes more frequent with age, ranging from 5% for those under 40 years of age to 50% over the age of 60. It has also become more common in all parts of the world. In 2003 in Europe, it resulted in approximately 13,000 deaths. It is the most frequent anatomic disease of the colon. Costs associated with diverticular disease were around US$2.4 billion a year in the United States in 2013.
==Signs and symptoms==
Diverticulitis typically presents with lower quadrant abdominal pain of a sudden onset. Patients commonly have elevated C-reactive protein and a high white blood cell count. In Asia it is usually on the right (ascending colon), while in North America and Europe, the abdominal pain is usually on the left lower side (sigmoid colon). There may also be fever, nausea, diarrhea or constipation, and blood in the stool. Diverticulosis is associated with more frequent bowel movements, contrary to the widespread belief that patients with diverticulosis are constipated.

===Complications===
In complicated diverticulitis, an inflamed diverticulum can rupture, allowing bacteria to subsequently infect externally from the colon. If the infection spreads to the lining of the abdominal cavity (the peritoneum), peritonitis results. Sometimes, inflamed diverticula can cause narrowing of the bowel, leading to an obstruction. In some cases, the affected part of the colon adheres to the bladder or other organs in the pelvic cavity, causing a fistula, or creating an abnormal connection between an organ and adjacent structure or another organ (in the case of diverticulitis, the colon, and an adjacent organ).

Related pathologies may include:
* Bowel obstruction
* Peritonitis
* Abscess
* Fistula
* Bleeding
* Strictures

==Causes and prevention==
The causes of diverticulitis are poorly understood. Formation of diverticula is regarded as likely due to interactions of age, diet, colonic microbiota, genetic factors, colonic motility, and changes in colonic structure.

===Factors associated with increased diverticulitis risk===

====Genetics====
A 2021 review estimated that 50% of the risk of diverticulitis was attributable to genetic factors. A 2012 study estimated that heritability made up 40% of cause and non-shared environmental effects 60%.

====Presence of other ill-health====
Conditions that increase the risk of developing diverticulitis include arterial hypertension and immunosuppression. Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis.

====Frequency of bowel movement====
A 2022 study found that more frequent bowel movements appeared to be a risk factor for subsequent diverticulitis both in men and women.

====Weight====
Obesity has been regarded as a risk factor for diverticulitis. Some studies have found a correlation of higher prevalence of diverticulitis with overweight and obese bodyweight. There is some debate if this is causal.

====Diet====
It is unclear what role dietary fiber plays in diverticulitis. It is often stated that a diet low in fiber is a risk factor; however, the evidence to support this is unclear. A 2012 study found that a high-fiber diet and increased frequency of bowel movements are associated with greater, rather than lower, prevalence of diverticulosis.

There is no evidence to suggest that the avoidance of nuts and seeds prevents the progression of diverticulosis to an acute case of diverticulitis. In fact, it appears that a higher intake of nuts and corn could help to avoid diverticulitis in adult males.

Red meat consumption, particularly unprocessed red meat, has been associated with higher diverticulitis risk.

A 2017 analysis found a dietary pattern high in red meat, refined grains, and high-fat dairy was associated with an increased risk of incident diverticulitis whereas a dietary pattern high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains was associated with decreased risk. Men in the highest quintile of Western dietary pattern score had a multivariate hazard ratio (HR) of 1.55 (95% CI, 1.20–1.99) for diverticulitis compared to men in the lowest quintile. Recent dietary intake may be more strongly associated with diverticulitis than long-term intake. The associations between dietary patterns and diverticulitis were largely due to red meat and fiber intake. A systematic review published in 2012 found no high-quality studies, but found that some studies and guidelines favour a high-fiber diet for the treatment of symptomatic disease. A 2011 review found that a high-fiber diet may prevent diverticular disease, and found no evidence for the superiority of low-fiber diets in treating diverticular disease. A 2011 long-term study found that a vegetarian diet and high fiber intake were both associated with lower risks of hospital admission or death from diverticulitis.

While it has been suggested that probiotics may be useful for treatment, the evidence currently neither supports nor refutes this claim.

===Factors associated with reduced diverticulitis risk===

====Healthy lifestyle====
A prospective cohort study found that a healthy lifestyle (defined as &lt;51 g daily red meat, &gt;23 g daily dietary fiber, 
2 hours’ exercise weekly, normal BMI, and never a smoker) was associated with a substantially reduced risk of diverticulitis (relative risk 0.27, 0.15 to 0.48).

====Exercise====
A 2009 study found that men who engaged in vigorous physical activity (approximately 3 hours of running a week) had a 34% reduction in the risk of diverticulitis, and a 39% reduction in the risk of diverticular bleeding when compared to men who did not exercise vigorously. Running was the only specific activity to show a statistically significant benefit. The up and down motions of running may impart distinct benefits to the colon. Moderate exercise may accelerate the speed at which food travels through the gut.

==Pathology==
Right-sided diverticula are micro-hernias of the colonic mucosa and submucosa through the colonic muscular layer where blood vessels penetrate it. Left-sided diverticula are pseudodiverticula, since the herniation is not through all the layers of the colon. Diverticulitis is postulated to develop because of changes inside the colon, including high pressures because of abnormally vigorous contractions.

==Diagnosis==

People with the above symptoms are commonly studied with computed tomography, or a CT scan. Ultrasound can provide preliminary investigation for diverticulitis. Amongst the findings that can be seen on ultrasound is a non-compressing outpouching of bowel wall, hypoechoic and thickened wall, or there is obstructive fecalith at the bowel wall. Besides, bowel wall oedema with adjacent hyperechoic mesentery can also be seen on ultrasound. However, CT scan is the mainstay of diagnosing diverticulitis and its complications. The diagnosis of acute diverticulitis is made confidently when the involved segment contains diverticula. CT images reveal localized colon wall thickening, with inflammation extending into the fat surrounding the colon. Amongst the complications that can be seen on CT scan are: abscesses, perforation, pylephlebitis, intestinal obstruction, bleeding, and fistula.

Barium enema and colonoscopy are contraindicated in the acute phase of diverticulitis because of the risk of perforation.

===Classification by severity===

====Uncomplicated vs complicated====
Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is defined as localized diverticular inflammation without any abscess or perforation. Complicated diverticulitis additionally includes the presence of abscess, peritonitis, obstruction, stricture and/or fistula. 12% of patients with diverticulitis present with complicated disease.

====Classification systems====
At least four classifications by severity have been published in the literature. As of 2015 the &#x27;German Classification&#x27; was widely accepted and is as follows:
* Stage 0 – asymptomatic diverticulosis
* Stage 1a – uncomplicated diverticulitis
* Stage 1b – diverticulitis with phlegmonous peridiverticulitis
* Stage 2a – diverticulitis with concealed perforation, and abscess with a diameter of one centimeter or less
* Stage 2b – diverticulitis with abscess greater than one centimeter
* Stage 3a – diverticulitis with symptoms but without complications
* Stage 3b – relapsing diverticulitis without complications
* Stage 3c – relapsing diverticulitis with complications

As of 2022 other classification systems are also used.

The severity of diverticulitis can be radiographically graded by the Hinchey Classification.

====Smoldering diverticulitis====
In &quot;smoldering diverticulitis&quot; (SmD) there are frequent relapsing symptoms but no progression to diverticular complications. Approximately 5% of diverticulitis people experience smoldering diverticulitis. Smoldering diverticulitis cases make up 4–10% of diverticulitis surgeries.

===Differential diagnoses===
The differential diagnoses include colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic colitis, and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as a number of urological and gynecological processes. In those with uncomplicated diverticulitis, cancer is present in less than 1% of people.

==Prognosis==
* Estimates for the % of people with diverticulosis who will develop diverticulitis range from 5% to 10% to 25%. 
* Most people with uncomplicated diverticulitis recover following medical treatment. The median time to recovery is 14 days. Approximately 5% of people experience smoldering diverticulitis.
* Diverticulitis recurs in around one-third of people – about 50% of recurrences occur within one year, and 90% within 5 years. Recurrence is more common in younger people, in those with an abscess at diagnosis, and after an episode of complicated diverticulitis.
* About 5% of people with diverticular disease have complications when followed up for 10–30 years. The risk of complications, such as peritonitis or perforation, is greater during the first episode of diverticulitis, and the risk reduces with each recurrence. People who are immunocompromised have a 5-fold increased risk of recurrence with complications, such as bowel perforation, compared to immunocompetent people.
* The decision criteria for having surgical treatment has been subject to debate and development.
* Following surgical treatment, approximately 25% of people remain symptomatic.

==Treatment==
In uncomplicated diverticulitis, administration of fluids may be sufficient treatment if no other risk factors are present.

===Diet===
Diverticulitis patients may be placed on a low-fiber diet, or a liquid diet, although evidence for improved outcomes through diet has not been found.

===Medication===

====Antibiotics====
Mild uncomplicated diverticulitis without systemic inflammation should &quot;not&quot; be treated with antibiotics. For mild, uncomplicated, and non-purulent cases of acute diverticulitis, symptomatic treatment, IV fluids, and bowel rest have no worse outcome than surgical intervention in the short and medium term, and appear to have the same outcomes at 24 months. With abscess confirmed by CT scan, some evidence and clinical guidelines tentatively support the use of oral or IV antibiotics for smaller abscesses (&lt;5 cm) without systemic inflammation, but percutaneous or laparoscopic drainage may be necessary for larger abscesses (&gt;5 cm).

Rifaximin was found in a meta-analysis to give symptom relief and reduce complications but the scientific quality of the underlying studies has been questioned.

====Mesalamine====
Mesalamine is an anti-inflammatory medication used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. In limited studies, patients with diverticulitis and symptomatic diverticular disease treated with mesalamine have shown improvement in both conditions. Mesalazine may reduce recurrences in symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease. In 2022 Germany introduced guidance to use mesalamine to treat acute uncomplicated diverticulitis.

===Surgery===
Indications for surgery are abscess or fistula formation; and intestinal rupture with peritonitis. These, however, rarely occur.

Emergency surgery is required for peritonitis with perforated diverticulitis or intestinal rupture.

Surgery for abscess or fistula is indicated either urgently or electively. The timing of the elective surgery is determined by evaluating factors such as the stage of the disease, the age of the person, their general medical condition, the severity and frequency of the attacks, and whether symptoms persist after the first acute episode. In most cases, elective surgery is deemed to be indicated when the risks of the surgery are less than the risks of the complications of diverticulitis. Elective surgery is not indicated until at least six weeks after recovery from the acute event.

====Technique====
The first surgical approach consists of resection and primary anastomosis. This first stage of surgery is performed on people if they have a well-vascularized, nonedematous, and tension-free bowel. The proximal margin should be an area of the pliable colon without hypertrophy or inflammation. The distal margin should extend to the upper third of the rectum where the taenia coalesces. Not all of the diverticula-bearing colon must be removed, since diverticula proximal to the descending or sigmoid colon are unlikely to result in further symptoms.

====Approach====
Diverticulitis surgery consists of a bowel resection with or without colostomy. Either may be done by the traditional laparotomy or by laparoscopic surgery. The traditional bowel resection is made using an open surgical approach, called colectomy. During a colectomy, the person is placed under general anesthesia. A surgeon performing a colectomy will make a lower midline incision in the abdomen or a lateral lower transverse incision. The diseased section of the large intestine is removed, and then the two healthy ends are sewn or stapled back together. A colostomy may be performed when the bowel has to be relieved of its normal digestive work as it heals. A colostomy implies creating a temporary opening of the colon on the skin surface, and the end of the colon is passed through the abdominal wall with a removable bag attached to it. The waste is collected in the bag.

However, most surgeons prefer performing the bowel resection laparoscopically, mainly because postoperative pain is reduced with faster recovery. Laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive procedure in which three to four smaller incisions are made in the abdomen or navel. After incisions into the abdomen are done, placement of trocars occurs which allows a camera and other equipment entry into the peritoneal cavity. The greater omentum is reflected and the affected section of the bowel is mobilized. Alternately, laparoscopic sigmoid resection (LSR) compared to open sigmoid resection (OSR) showed that LSR is not superior to OSR for acute symptomatic diverticulitis. Furthermore, laparoscopic lavage was as safe as resection for perforated diverticulitis with peritonitis.

====Maneuvers====
All colon surgery involves only three maneuvers that may vary in complexity depending on the region of the bowel and the nature of the disease. The maneuvers are the retraction of the colon, the division of the attachments to the colon, and the dissection of the mesentery. After the resection of the colon, the surgeon normally divides the attachments to the liver and the small intestine. After the mesenteric vessels are dissected, the colon is divided with special surgical staplers that close off the bowel while cutting between the staple lines. After resection of the affected bowel segment, an anvil and spike are used to anastomose the remaining segments of the bowel. Anastomosis is confirmed by filling the cavity with normal saline and checking for any air bubbles.

====Bowel resection with colostomy====
When excessive inflammation of the colon renders primary bowel resection too risky, bowel resection with colostomy remains an option. Also known as the Hartmann&#x27;s operation, this is a more complicated surgery typically reserved for life-threatening cases. The bowel resection with colostomy implies a temporary colostomy which is followed by a second operation to reverse the colostomy. The surgeon makes an opening in the abdominal wall (a colostomy) which helps clear the infection and inflammation. The colon is brought through the opening and all waste is collected in an external bag.

The colostomy is usually temporary, but it may be permanent, depending on the severity of the case. In most cases several months later, after the inflammation has healed, the person undergoes another major surgery, during which the surgeon rejoins the colon and rectum and reverses the colostomy.

===Prophylactic endoscopic clipping===
Prophylactic endoscopic clipping is being researched for diverticulitis.

==Epidemiology==
Diverticulitis most often affects the elderly. In Western countries, diverticular disease most commonly involves the sigmoid colon (95 percent of people with diverticulitis). Diverticulosis affects 5–45% of individuals with the prevalence of diverticulosis increasing with age from under 20% of individuals affected at age 40 up to 60% of individuals affected by age 60.

Left-sided diverticular disease (involving the sigmoid colon) is most common in the West, while right-sided diverticular disease (involving the ascending colon) is more common in Asia and Africa. Among people with diverticulosis, 4–15% may go on to develop diverticulitis.

<text>A China watcher, or, less frequently, Pekingologist, is a person who researches and/or reports on the politics of the People&#x27;s Republic of China for western consumption, especially in a Cold War context. &quot;China watching&quot; was coined by analogy to birdwatching, which takes place from a distance. It represents a semantic break from the earlier term China Hands, which referred to knowledgeable businesspeople who made political commentary from inside mainland China: after the Chinese Communist Revolution, China watchers more frequently had backgrounds in academia, rather than business, and operated out of consulates in Hong Kong.

&quot;China watcher&quot; should not be confused for Sinologist, which can loosely refer to anyone who studies China, but, especially in the United States, more frequently refers to those who study classical language, literature, or civilization. In other languages, where the term &quot;Pekingologist&quot; does not exist, the usage of these terms are less rigidly delineated. In French for instance, the term &quot;sinologue&quot; would refer to both a researcher in Sinology and a reporter of Pekingology.

==History and nature of China watching==

=== Cold War era ===

During the Cold War, China watchers centered in Hong Kong and many of them simultaneously worked for Western intelligence agencies, universities, and news organizations. Much of their reporting would be previewed by the British colonial government&#x27;s secretariat, to prepare for diplomatic consequences. Of the various nationalities of China watcher, the Americans were the most prolific, due to the activity of the Consulate General of the United States, Hong Kong and Macau. Mutual distrust between the United States and China and the prohibition of travel between the countries meant that American China watchers did not have access to press briefings or interviews. Therefore, China watchers adopted techniques from Kremlinology, such as the close parsing of official announcements for hidden meanings, movements of officials reported in newspapers, and analysis of photographs of public appearances. China watchers would also interview refugees from mainland China, or reprint analysis from Taiwan or the Soviet Union.

Prominent China watchers in Hong Kong in the first decades after the Chinese Communist Revolution included László Ladány and Pierre Ryckmans. Publications by the Consulate-General, which were frequently cited by China-watchers (some of whom did not speak Chinese) included &quot;Survey of the China Mainland Press&quot;, &quot;Current Background&quot;, and &quot;Selections from Mainland China Magazines&quot;. These publications emphasized problems and contradictions in national policy, violence, and atrocity, ignoring topics like education or culture unless there was an associated controversy. In the years since the reform and opening up, China watchers can live in China and take advantage of normal sources of information. Others remained in Hong Kong, however. The Hong Kong journalist Willy Wo-Lap Lam has been called the &quot;quintessential China watcher, practiced in the art of Pekingology,&quot; whose &quot;scope is wide, but the focus of his analysis is the Zhongnanhai and factional manoeuvring among the political elite.&quot;

=== Post-Cold War era ===
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, China became seen as a major United States antagonist, which has caused more interest in China from strategists, including China watchers, rather than just sinologists. Sinologists have since lost ground in shaping the US policy on China, and have claimed that strategists &quot;don&#x27;t understand China&quot;. According to Washington officials, there is &quot;a desire for a new cold war&quot;, and &quot;The Economist&quot; wrote &quot;expertise about China is not necessary&quot; for China watchers, while doveish China experts lost their advisory role to the White House.

== Criticism ==
The credibility of China watchers has been subject to criticism, as many China watchers predicted extreme and conflicting scenarios, either a collapse of the PRC&#x27;s economy, political system or nation, or PRC domination. In particular, China watchers have claimed that the CPC is struggling to hold on to power, however the party proved to be adaptable. During the COVID-19 pandemic, China watchers were prominently featured in media reports claiming lockdowns as authoritarian measures, with support for this policy by the scientific community receiving considerably less attention.

<doc id="725050" wikidata="Q713258" url="?curid=725050" title="Brother Yun">
<text>Liu Zhenying (; born 1 January 1958), known as Brother Yun (, literally &quot;Brother Cloud&quot;), is an exiled Chinese Christian house church leader, evangelist, and proponent of the Back To Jerusalem movement. Brother Yun was involved in the Christian house church networks in China during the 1980s and 90s. Accounts about his life and ministry are to be found in his autobiography, &quot;The Heavenly Man&quot;. 

==Life in China==
Brother Yun&#x27;s book tells both of great persecution, and a surprising series of miracles of deliverance very similar (though often even more &#x27;extreme&#x27;) to those found in the Bible. Despite a life of poverty in China, he since has spoken to thousands internationally with the Gospel message. Seen as a rebel among some Chinese for not joining the government-controlled Christian organization, he was imprisoned and tortured by the government authorities. His book reports that he became a highly wanted man across several provinces. He was finally arrested and sentenced to many years in prison. However, Brother Yun continued his ministry while in prison, with more claims of miraculous results. As a result, many prisoners and even prison officials are reported to have become born-again Christians. While he gained increasing favor from some officials, he also became a target of increased persecution by others. He was repeatedly beaten and became severely malnourished. While in prison, Brother Yun writes about undertaking a total fast without food or water for 74 days.

After many years in prison, he escaped from Hangzhou from which it is reported that nobody had previously escaped. He described how he heard the voice of the Holy Spirit, telling him to simply walk out the heavily guarded prison gate. Despite the risk of being shot, he wrote later that he obeyed the voice, and walked straight through several closed prison doors in front of many prison guards, across the prison yard and finally out of the main gate. Brother Yun stated that it was as if he had become invisible to the guards who stared straight through him. Although human invisibility is a pseudoscience, some prison guards have lost their jobs for this &#x27;embarrassing mishap.&#x27; It is claimed that the official investigation by the Chinese Government concluded that Brother Yun received no human help in his escape and therefore should remain free. He claims to be the only person to have escaped from this notorious maximum security prison.

==Life in exile==
His ministry struggled briefly when Chinese Christians became increasingly fearful of housing him because of the potential repercussions from government authorities. After escaping from China, Brother Yun took asylum in Germany. In 2001 he was imprisoned in Myanmar for seven months. As a leader of the &quot;Back to Jerusalem Movement&quot;, Brother Yun seeks to evangelise the countries between China and Israel, which are among the least-Christianised of the world.

He is married to Deling, with whom he has two children.

==&quot;The Heavenly Man&quot;==
&quot;The Heavenly Man&quot; is an autobiography of Brother Yun detailing his life from the age of sixteen, through his three accounts of incarceration, and ending in his exile to Germany.

It was awarded the &quot;Christian Book of the Year&quot; by the UK Christian Booksellers Convention in 2003. The title comes from the name by which Brother Yun was known amongst the house church networks. He gained that name from one night of interrogation when he would only answer &quot;I am a Heavenly Man!&quot;, instead of revealing his true name, in order to protect other Christians from the police.

Released in early 2002, the book is co-written and translated by Paul Hattaway and published by Monarch Publications.

==&quot;Living Water&quot;==
The book &quot;Living Water&quot; was released in 2008 and, as with his previous book, &quot;The Heavenly Man&quot;, it is also co-written and translated by Paul Hattaway. It is published by Zondervan Publications.

It consists of his teachings while in North America and Europe.

==Controversy==
Samuel Lamb (Lin Xiangao) has stated that Brother Yun falsely claimed to have fasted without food and water for nearly twice as long as Jesus, and falsely claiming to represent 58 million house-church Christians, and raising large sums of money in many countries. He also insists that Brother Yun in no way represents the house-churches in China, although Lamb admits he has never met Brother Yun or read his autobiography.

This controversy has not been without defense. Paul Hattaway, the co-author of the book has published an open response that claims the attacks on the credibility of Brother Yun are rumours originating with Titus Pan in Hamburg. Various Chinese House Church leaders have again expressed their love and respect for Brother Yun. Among them is Peter Xu, founder of the Back to Jerusalem Gospel Mission, who was a fellow prison inmate of Brother Yun. Included in &quot;The Heavenly Man&quot; (p. 299) is a letter from the elders of the Sinim Fellowship of house church leaders in China, commending Brother Yun as &quot;blameless before God&quot; and his testimony as &quot;genuine.&quot;

<doc id="725051" wikidata="Q1078392" url="?curid=725051" title="Indapamide">
<text>Indapamide is a thiazide-like diuretic drug used in the treatment of hypertension, as well as decompensated heart failure. Combination preparations with perindopril (an ACE inhibitor antihypertensive) are available. The thiazide-like diuretics (indapamide and chlorthalidone) reduce risk of major cardiovascular events and heart failure in hypertensive patients compared with hydrochlorothiazide with a comparable incidence of adverse events. Both thiazide diuretics and thiazide-like diuretics are effective in reducing risk of stroke. Both drug classes appear to have comparable rates of adverse effects as other antihypertensives such as angiotensin II receptor blockers and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and lesser prevalence of side-effects when compared to ACE-inhibitors and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.
It was patented in 1968 and approved for medical use in 1977. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

== Medical uses ==
Its indications include hypertension and edema due to congestive heart failure. Indapamide has been shown to reduce stroke rates in people with high blood pressure. Studies have shown that the blood pressure lowering effects of indapamide in combination with perindopril reduce the rate of stroke in high risk patients (those with a history of high blood pressure, stroke or type two diabetes). HYVET study showed that indapamide (sustained release), with or without perindopril as antihypertensive treatment in persons 80 years of age or older with sustained systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg or higher, demonstrated significant reduction in all-cause mortality when treated to a target of 150/80 mmHg, but there was found to be no significant reduction in risk of death from cardiac causes. Two systematic reviews identified that indapamide with or without perindopril significantly reduced all cause mortality in young-elderly patients with a history of stroke, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, when greater reductions in mean office blood pressure are achieved, significant cardiovascular benefit was only observed when trials including the &gt;75 years old cohort was included.

== Contraindications ==
Indapamide is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to sulfonamides, severe kidney failure, hepatic encephalopathy or severe liver failure, and a low blood potassium level.

There is insufficient safety data to recommend indapamide use in pregnancy or breastfeeding.

== Adverse effects ==

Commonly reported adverse events are low potassium levels, fatigue, orthostatic hypotension (an exaggerated decrease in blood pressure upon standing, often associated with syncope), and allergic manifestations.

Monitoring the serum levels of potassium and uric acid is recommended, especially in subjects with a predisposition to low levels of potassium in the blood and gout.

== Interactions ==

Caution is advised in the combination of indapamide with lithium and drugs causing prolonged QT interval (on EKG) or wave-burst arrhythmia (i.e.: astemizole, bepridil, IV erythromycin, halofantrine, pentamidine, sultopride, terfenadine, and vincamine).

== Overdose ==
Symptoms of over dosage would be those associated with a diuretic effect (i.e. electrolyte disturbances), low blood pressure, and muscular weakness. Treatment should be symptomatic, directed at correcting electrolyte abnormalities.

<doc id="725061" wikidata="Q39185" url="?curid=725061" title="Tenterfield Terrier">
<text>The Tenterfield Terrier is a dog breed developed in Australia. They are a strong, active, hardy and agile dog, their smooth short coat making them &#x27;easy care&#x27; family companions.

== Appearance ==
Tenterfield Terriers come in a variety of colours, but their coat colors are mostly white with black, olive or even tan markings in its tones. They are small dogs, on average growing to heights of between 25 and 30 centimeters tall. 

== History ==
The origin of the Tenterfield Terrier is not known. It is said that the Tenterfield Terrier breed originated from dogs that accompanied Australia&#x27;s first European settlers who sailed from Portsmouth in the south of England. These dogs were pest and vermin killers, with the smallest of them selected to play that role on the European ships, thus leading to their arrival in Australia. It is also said that the smallest puppies from the litters of Fox Terriers were sometimes domestically selected such as for manouvreability in a hunting role, and even at times crossed with other small breeds to achieve a smaller size.

By the late 19th century a dog type known as the Miniature Fox Terrier (known colloquially as &quot;Mini Foxies&quot;) was well established in rural Australia as a vermin killer and family companion. By the 1920s the dog had become a fixture in urban households.

The name &quot;Tenterfield&quot; is sometimes incorrectly stated to denote the breed&#x27;s place of origin. Rather, it may have derived from a well known breeder. The dog was bred extensively in and around northern New South Wales. Tenterfield is one of many localities in Australia in which small terriers of this type were kept. The town of Tenterfield is significant in Australian history for the Tenterfield Oration on independence from Britain. Additionally, the owner of the town&#x27;s saddlery a man named George Woolnough, was immortalized by his grandson entertainer Peter Allen as the &quot;Tenterfield Saddler&quot;. Tenterfield residents attest that Mr. Woolnough owned and loved a number of these terriers, however, photographs of these dogs have not yet been discovered. 

The name Tenterfield Terrier was suggested in the 1990s by television gardening personality Don Burke, and was adopted during the renaming of one of the then-Miniature Fox Terrier clubs.

== Health ==
A study looking at congenital hypothyroidism in the Tenterfield Terrier found a mutation in the R593W gene to be responsible, this mutation was identified in all affected dogs and 31% of clinically healthy Tenterfield Terriers. A test for the mutation in the R593W gene has been developed and released.

<text>Fujinon is a brand of optical lenses made by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd, now known as Fujifilm. Fujifilm&#x27;s Fujinon lenses have been used by professional photographers and broadcast stations as well as cinematography. Fujifilm started manufacture of optical glass in its Odawara Factory in Japan in 1940, which was the start of the Fujinon brand. They were proud of their use of expensive Platinum crucibles to get the purest glass achievable at the time. Fujifilm also pioneered Electron Beam Coating (EBC) which according to Fujifilm, represented a new high in lens precision and performance. The EBC process was significantly different from other coating processes by the number of coating, the thinness of the coating, and the materials used for coating. Fujifilm claimed they were able to have as many as 14 layers of coating and used materials such as zirconium oxide, and cerium fluoride, which could not be used for coating in the conventional coating process. The first lens to offer the Electron Beam Coating was the EBC Fujinon 55mm F3.5 Macro in 1972. Light transmission for the coating was said to be 99.8%. EBC later evolved into Super-EBC and HT-EBC (High Transmittance-Electron Beam Coating).
