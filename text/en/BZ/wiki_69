==Etymology==
In earlier times, Palakkad was also known as &quot;Palakkattussery&quot;. Many concluded that Palakkad is derived from &#x27;Pala&#x27;, an indigenous tree which once densely occupied the land; and hence Palakkad or &quot;the forest of Pala trees&quot;.Some believe, connecting the ancient Jain Temple in the town, that the sacred language Pali gave the name. In 1757, to check the invasion of the Zamorin of Calicut, the Palakkad Raja sought the help of Hyder Ali of Mysore. Later his son Tipu sultan became the ruler.

Before the Indian Independence, present-day Kerala state was scattered in South Canara, Malabar District of British India, and two princely states namely Cochin and Travancore. The first All-Kerala conference of Indian National Congress was held in 1921 at Ottapalam on the banks of the river Bharathappuzha, which also later demanded a separate state for the Malayalam-speaking regions in future Independent India. Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee was formed in that conference. Before that, Malabar District, Cochin, and Travancore had separate Congress committees. Ottapalam is located right in the middle of Kerala state.

==History==
The region around Coimbatore was ruled by the Cheras during Sangam period between c. first and the fourth centuries CE and it served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between the Malabar Coast and Tamil Nadu. Palakkad city, which lies on the northern bank of the River Bharathappuzha, was ruled by the Palakkad Rajas (&quot;Tarur Swaroopam&quot;). &quot;Palakkad Raja&quot; had the right over the Taluks of Palakkad, Alathur, and Chittur. The original headquarters of &quot;Palakkad Raja&quot;s were at Athavanad, Tirur Taluk, in present-day Malappuram district. It is said that their lands at Athavanad area were given to the &quot;Azhvanchery Thamprakkal&quot; and the Palakkad-Chittur areas were bought from them instead.

Pattambi-Ottapalam Taluk were ruled by the Zamorin of Calicut, and Mannarkkad Taluk was a part of the Kingdom of Valluvanad, which was also later annexed by the Zamorin. Pattambi – Ottapalam areas were originally a part of &quot;Nedunganad&quot; (ruled by Nedungadis, which was later annexed by the Kingdom of Valluvanad, which was again followed by the conquest of the Zamorin of Calicut around 15th century C. E. Nedunganad was ruled by a Samanthan Nair clan known as Nedungadis, similar to the Eradis of Eranad and Vellodis of Valluvanad. Other kingdoms in Palakkad district during medieval period included Kollengode and Kavalappara. Both of them became a part of the kingdom of Zamorin of Calicut around 15th century CE. Parts of Palakkad had also become under the Zamorin for sometime.

In 1757, to resist the invasion of the Zamorin of Kozhikode, the Palakkad Raja sought the help of the Hyder Ali of Mysore. In 1766, Hyder Ali defeated the Zamorin of Kozhikode – an East India Company ally at the time – and absorbed Kozhikode into his state. The Hyder Ali rebuilt Palakkad Fort in 1766. The smaller princely states in northern and north-central parts of Kerala (comprising Malabar District) including Kolathunadu, Kottayam, Kadathanadu, Kozhikode, Tanur, Valluvanad, and Palakkad were unified under the rulers of Mysore and were made a part of the larger Kingdom of Mysore. His son and successor, Tipu Sultan, launched campaigns against the expanding British East India Company, resulting in two of the four Anglo-Mysore Wars. 

Tipu ultimately ceded the Malabar District and South Kanara to the company in the 1790s as a result of the Third Anglo-Mysore War and the subsequent Treaty of Seringapatam; both were annexed to the Bombay Presidency (which had also included other regions in the western coast of India) of British India in the years 1792 and 1799 respectively. Later in 1800, both of the Malabar District and South Canara were separated from Bombay presidency to merge them with the neighbouring Madras Presidency. Palakkad was under British Raj until 1947.

The municipality of Palakkad was formed on 1 November 1866 according to the Madras Act 10 of 1865 (Amendment of the Improvements in Towns act 1850) of the British Indian Empire, along with the municipalities of Kozhikode, Kannur, Thalassery, and Fort Kochi, making them the first modern municipalities in the modern state of Kerala.

Present-day Palakkad district was a part of Malabar District before the formation of Palakkad district. Thrithala Revenue block of present-day Pattambi Taluk was a part of the Ponnani taluk. Rest of Pattambi Taluk, Ottapalam, and Mannarkkad Taluks were included in the Valluvanad Taluk of Malappuram Revenue Division in Malabar District. The remaining three Taluks of current Palakkad district (Palakkad, Alathur, and Chittur) together formed the Palghat Taluk of Malabar District during British Raj.

At the time of 1951 Census of India, Palakkad was the second-largest city in the erstwhile Malabar District after Kozhikode. At that time only two towns in Malabar was treated as cities: Kozhikode and Palakkad. Following the formation of the state of Kerala in 1956, the erstwhile Taluk of Palakkad in Malabar District was divided into three: Palakkad, Alathur. Palakkad district was formed by taking parts of the erstwhile Malabar District. On 16 June 1969, Perinthalmanna taluk and Ponnani taluk were separated to form Malappuram district. On same day, Parudur village of Tirur Taluk was transferred to Palakkad district. Later some years, the Silent Valley National Park of Karuvarakundu village in Eranad Taluk (now Karuvarakundu is a part of Nilambur Taluk) of Malappuram district was transferred Mannarkkad Taluk in Palakkad district.

<doc id="746131" wikidata="Q4832556" url="?curid=746131" title="Structural Classification of Proteins database">
<text>The Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database is a largely manual classification of protein structural domains based on similarities of their structures and amino acid sequences. A motivation for this classification is to determine the evolutionary relationship between proteins. Proteins with the same shapes but having little sequence or functional similarity are placed in different superfamilies, and are assumed to have only a very distant common ancestor. Proteins having the same shape and some similarity of sequence and/or function are placed in &quot;families&quot;, and are assumed to have a closer common ancestor.

Similar to CATH and Pfam databases, SCOP provides a classification of individual structural domains of proteins, rather than a classification of the entire proteins which may include a significant number of different domains.

The SCOP database is freely accessible on the internet. SCOP was created in 1994 in the Centre for Protein Engineering and the Laboratory of Molecular Biology. It was maintained by Alexey G. Murzin and his colleagues in the Centre for Protein Engineering until its closure in 2010 and subsequently at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England.

The work on SCOP 1.75 has been discontinued in 2014. Since then SCOPe team from UC Berkeley has been responsible for updating the database in a compatible manner, with a combination of automated and manual methods. , the latest release is SCOPe 2.07 (March 2018).

The new Structural Classification of Proteins version 2 (SCOP2) database was released at the beginning of 2020. The new update featured an improved database schema, a new API and modernised web interface. This was the most significant update by the Cambridge group since SCOP 1.75 and builds on the advances in schema from the SCOP 2 prototype.

== Hierarchical organisation ==
The source of protein structures is the Protein Data Bank. The unit of classification of structure in SCOP is the protein domain. What the SCOP authors mean by &quot;domain&quot; is suggested by their statement that small proteins and most medium-sized ones have just one domain, and by the observation that human hemoglobin, which has an α2β2 structure, is assigned two SCOP domains, one for the α and one for the β subunit.

The shapes of domains are called &quot;folds&quot; in SCOP. Domains belonging to the same fold have the same major secondary structures in the same arrangement with the same topological connections. 1195 folds are given in SCOP version 1.75. Short descriptions of each fold are given. For example, the &quot;globin-like&quot; fold is described as &quot;core: 6 helices; folded leaf, partly opened&quot;. The fold to which a domain belongs is determined by inspection, rather than by software.

The levels of SCOP version 1.75 are as follows.
# Class: Types of folds, e.g., beta sheets.
# Fold: The different shapes of domains within a class.
# Superfamily: The domains in a fold are grouped into superfamilies, which have at least a distant common ancestor.
# Family: The domains in a superfamily are grouped into families, which have a more recent common ancestor.
# Protein domain: The domains in families are grouped into protein domains, which are essentially the same protein.
# Species: The domains in &quot;protein domains&quot; are grouped according to species.
# Domain: part of a protein. For simple proteins, it can be the entire protein.

=== Classes ===
The broadest groups on SCOP version 1.75 are the protein fold classes. These classes group structures with similar secondary structure composition, but different overall tertiary structures and evolutionarily origins. This is the top level &quot;root&quot; of the SCOP hierarchical classification.

# All alpha proteins [46456] (284): &quot;Domains consisting of α-helices&quot;
# All beta proteins [48724] (174): &quot;Domains consisting of β-sheets&quot;
# Alpha and beta proteins (a/b) [51349] (147): &quot;Mainly parallel beta sheets (beta-alpha-beta units)&quot;
# Alpha and beta proteins (a+b) [53931] (376): &quot;Mainly antiparallel beta sheets (segregated alpha and beta regions)&quot;
# Multi-domain proteins (alpha and beta) [56572] (66): &quot;Folds consisting of two or more domains belonging to different classes&quot;
# membrane and cell surface proteins and peptides [56835] (58): &quot;Does not include proteins in the immune system&quot;
# Small proteins [56992] (90): &quot;Usually dominated by metal ligand, cofactor, and/or disulfide bridges&quot;
# coiled-coil proteins [57942] (7): &quot;Not a true class&quot;
# Low resolution protein structures [58117] (26): &quot;Peptides and fragments. Not a true class&quot;
# Peptides [58231] (121): &quot;peptides and fragments. Not a true class.&quot;
# Designed proteins [58788] (44): &quot;Experimental structures of proteins with essentially non-natural sequences. Not a true class&quot;

The number in brackets, called a &quot;sunid&quot;, is a SCOP unique integer identifier for each node in the SCOP hierarchy. The number in parentheses indicates how many elements are in each category. For example, there are 284 folds in the &quot;All alpha proteins&quot; class. Each member of the hierarchy is a link to the next level of the hierarchy.

=== Folds ===
Each class contains a number of distinct folds. This classification level indicates similar tertiary structure, but not necessarily evolutionary relatedness. For example, the &quot;All-α proteins&quot; class contains &gt;280 distinct folds, including: Globin-like (core: 6 helices; folded leaf, partly opened), long alpha-hairpin (2 helices; antiparallel hairpin, left-handed twist) and Type I dockerin domains (tandem repeat of two calcium-binding loop-helix motifs, distinct from the EF-hand).

=== Superfamilies ===
Domains within a fold are further classified into superfamilies. This is a largest grouping of proteins for which structural similarity is sufficient to indicate evolutionary relatedness and therefore share a common ancestor. However, this ancestor is presumed to be distant, because the different members of a superfamily have low sequence identities. For example, the two superfamilies of the &quot;Globin-like&quot; fold are: the Globin superfamily and alpha-helical ferredoxin superfamily (contains two Fe4-S4 clusters).

=== Families ===
Protein families are more closely related than superfamilies. Domains are placed in the same family if that have either:
#&gt;30% sequence identity
#some sequence identity (e.g., 15%) &quot;and&quot; perform the same function

The similarity in sequence and structure is evidence that these proteins have a closer evolutionary relationship than do proteins in the same superfamily. Sequence tools, such as BLAST, are used to assist in placing domains into superfamilies and families. For example, the four families in the &quot;globin-like&quot; superfamily of the &quot;globin-like&quot; fold are truncated hemoglobin (lack the first helix), nerve tissue mini-hemoglobin (lack the first helix but otherwise is more similar to conventional globins than the truncated ones), globins (Heme-binding protein), and phycocyanin-like phycobilisome proteins (oligomers of two different types of globin-like subunits containing two extra helices at the N-terminus binds a bilin chromophore). Families in SCOP are each assigned a concise classification string, &quot;sccs&quot;, where the letter identifies the class to which the domain belongs; the following integers identify the fold, superfamily, and family, respectively (e.g., a.1.1.2 for the &quot;Globin&quot; family).

=== PDB entry domains ===
A &quot;TaxId&quot; is the taxonomy ID number and links to the NCBI taxonomy browser, which provides more information about the species to which the protein belongs. Clicking on a species or isoform brings up a list of domains. For example, the &quot;Hemoglobin, alpha-chain from Human (Homo sapiens)&quot; protein has &gt;190 solved protein structures, such as 2dn3 (complexed with cmo), and 2dn1 (complexed with hem, mbn, oxy). Clicking on the PDB numbers is supposed to display the structure of the molecule, but the links are currently broken (links work in pre-SCOP).

==Example==
Most pages in SCOP contain a search box. Entering &quot;trypsin +human&quot; retrieves several proteins, including the protein trypsinogen from humans. Selecting that entry displays a page that includes the &quot;lineage&quot;, which is at the top of most SCOP pages.

;Human trypsonogen lineage
# Root: scop
# Class: All beta proteins [48724]
# Fold: Trypsin-like serine proteases [50493]
#:&quot;barrel, closed; n=6, S=8; greek-key&quot;
#:&quot;duplication: consists of two domains of the same fold&quot;
# Superfamily: Trypsin-like serine proteases [50494]
# Family: Eukaryotic proteases [50514]
# Protein: Trypsin(ogen) [50515]
# Species: Human (Homo sapiens) [TaxId: 9606] [50519]

Searching for &quot;Subtilisin&quot; returns the protein, &quot;Subtilisin from Bacillus subtilis, carlsberg&quot;, with the following lineage.

;Subtilisin from Bacillus subtilis, carlsberg lineage
# Root: scop
# Class: Alpha and beta proteins (a/b) [51349]
#:&quot;Mainly parallel beta sheets (beta-alpha-beta units)&quot;
# Fold: Subtilisin-like [52742]
#:&quot;3 layers: a/b/a, parallel beta-sheet of 7 strands, order 2314567; left-handed crossover connection between strands 2 &amp; 3&quot;
# Superfamily: Subtilisin-like [52743]
# Family: Subtilases [52744]
# Protein: Subtilisin [52745]
# Species: Bacillus subtilis, carlsberg [TaxId: 1423] [52746]

Although both of these proteins are proteases, they do not even belong to the same fold, which is consistent with them being an example of convergent evolution.

==Comparison to other classification systems==
SCOP classification is more dependent on manual decisions than the semi-automatic classification by CATH, its chief rival. Human expertise is used to decide whether certain proteins are evolutionary related and therefore should be assigned to the same superfamily, or their similarity is a result of structural constraints and therefore they belong to the same fold. Another database, FSSP, is purely automatically generated (including regular automatic updates) but offers no classification, allowing the user to draw their own conclusion as to the significance of structural relationships based on the pairwise comparisons of individual protein structures.

=== SCOP successors ===
By 2009, the original SCOP database manually classified 38,000 PDB entries into a strictly hierarchical structure. With the accelerating pace of protein structure publications, the limited automation of classification could not keep up, leading to a non-comprehensive dataset. The Structural Classification of Proteins extended (SCOPe) database was released in 2012 with far greater automation of the same hierarchical system and is full backwards compatible with SCOP version 1.75. In 2014, manual curation was reintroduced into SCOPe to maintain accurate structure assignment. As of February 2015, SCOPe 2.05 classified 71,000 of the 110,000 total PDB entries.

SCOP2 prototype was a beta version of Structural classification of proteins and classification system that aimed to more the evolutionary complexity inherent in protein structure evolution.
It is therefore not a simple hierarchy, but a directed acyclic graph network connecting protein superfamilies representing structural and evolutionary relationships such as circular permutations, domain fusion and domain decay. Consequently, domains are not separated by strict fixed boundaries, but rather are defined by their relationships to the most similar other structures. The prototype was used for the development of the SCOP version 2 database. The SCOP version 2, release January 2020, contains 5134 families and 2485 superfamilies compared to 3902 families and 1962 superfamilies in SCOP 1.75. The classification levels organise more than 41 000 non-redundant domains that represent more than 504 000 protein structures.

The Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains (ECOD) database released in 2014 is a similar to SCOPe expansion of SCOP version 1.75. Unlike the compatible SCOPe, it renames the class-fold-superfamily-family hierarchy into an architecture-X-homology-topology-family (A-XHTF) grouping, with the last level mostly defined by Pfam and supplemented by HHsearch clustering for uncategorized sequences. ECOD has the best PDB coverage of all three successors: it covers &quot;every&quot; PDB structure, and is updated biweekly. The direct mapping to Pfam has proven useful to Pfam curators who use the homology-level category to supplement their &quot;clan&quot; grouping.

<text>Tengri (; Old Uyghur: ; Middle Turkic: ; ; ; ; ; ; ; Proto-Turkic: / ; Mongolian script: , ; , ; , ) is the all-encompassing God of Heaven in the traditional Turkic, Yeniseian, Mongolic, and various other nomadic religious beliefs. Tengri is not considered a deity in the usual sense, but a personification of the universe. However, some qualities associated with Tengri as the judge and source of life, and being eternal and supreme, led European and Muslim writers to identify Tengri as a deity of Turkic and Mongolic peoples. According to Mongolian belief, Tengri&#x27;s will (&quot;jayayan&quot;) may break its own usual laws and intervene by sending a chosen person to earth.

It is also one of the terms used for the primary chief deity of the early Turkic and Mongolic peoples.

Worship surrounding Tengri is called &quot;Tengrism&quot;. The core beings in Tengrism are the Sky Father (Tenger Etseg) and the Earth Mother (Umay Ana). It involves ancestor worship, as Tengri was thought to have been the ancestral progenitor of mankind in Turkic regions and Mongolia, shamanism, animism, and totemism.

==Name==

The oldest form of the name is recorded in Chinese annals from the 4th century BC, describing the beliefs of the Xiongnu. It takes the form 撑犁/&quot;Cheng-li&quot;, which is hypothesized to be a Chinese transcription of &quot;Tängri&quot;. (The Proto-Turkic form of the word has been reconstructed as &quot;*Teŋri&quot; or, the back-ablauted variant &quot;*Taŋrï&quot;.) Alternatively, a reconstructed Altaic etymology from &quot;*T`aŋgiri&quot; (&quot;oath&quot; or &quot;god&quot;) would emphasize the god&#x27;s divinity rather than his domain over the sky. It is generally assumed the term &quot;tengri&quot; originally meant &quot;sky&quot;. Andrey Kononov suggested that the term is formed by the words &quot;tän&quot; (morning) and &quot;injir&quot; (evening) into &quot;tänri&quot;, referring to the sky as whole.

The Turkic form, &quot;Tengri&quot;, is attested in the 8th century Orkhon inscriptions as the Old Turkic form &quot;Teŋri&quot;. In modern Turkish, the derived word &quot;Tanrı&quot; is used as the generic word for &quot;god&quot;, or for the Abrahamic God, and is used today by Turkish people to refer to any god. The supreme deity of the traditional religion of the Chuvash is &quot;Tură&quot;.

Other reflexes of the name in modern languages include (&quot;sky&quot;), , .

Earlier, the Chinese word for &quot;sky&quot; 天 (Mandarin: &quot;tiān&quot; &lt; Old Chinese *&quot;thīn&quot; or *&quot;thîn&quot;) had been suggested to be related to &quot;Tengri&quot;, possibly a loan into Chinese from a prehistoric Central Asian language. However, this proposal is unlikely in light of recent reconstructions of the Old Chinese pronunciation of the character &quot;天&quot;, such as (Zhengzhang) or (Baxter-Sagart), which propose for 天 a voiceless lateral onset, either a cluster or single consonant, respectively. Baxter &amp; Sagart (2014:113-114) pointed to attested dialectal differences in Eastern Han Chinese, the use of 天 as a phonetic component in phono-semantic compound Chinese characters, and the choice of 天 to transcribe foreign syllables, all of which prompted them to conclude that, around 200 CE, 天&#x27;s onset had two pronunciations: coronal and dorsal , both of which likely originated from an earlier voiceless lateral .

Linguist Stefan Georg has proposed that the Turkic word ultimately originates as a loanword from Proto-Yeniseian &quot;*tɨŋgVr-&quot; &quot;high&quot;.

Amy Chua renders the name as &quot;[T]he Eternal Blue Sky&quot;, likely because of the connotations of the name&#x27;s usage.

==History==

Tengri was the national god of the Göktürks, described as the &quot;god of the Turks&quot; (&quot;Türük Tängrisi&quot;). The Göktürk khans based their power on a mandate from Tengri. These rulers were generally accepted as the sons of Tengri who represented him on Earth. They wore titles such as &quot;tengrikut&quot;, &quot;kutluġ&quot; or &quot;kutalmysh&quot;, based on the belief that they attained &quot;kut&quot;, some sort of heavenly and spiritual force granted to these rulers by Tengri.

Prior to foreign influences, the Turkic conception of tengri was regarded as the heaven or the will controlling heaven, probably some sort of force. Out of this, the concept of a personal being developed. First, when Turkic people took over other religions, the term &quot;tengri&quot; became the name of a (personal) god or &quot;higher being&quot;.

Tengri was the chief deity worshipped by the ruling class of the Central Asian steppe peoples in 6th to 9th centuries (Turkic peoples, Mongols and Hungarians). It lost its importance when the Uighuric kagans proclaimed Manichaeism the state religion in the 8th century.
The worship of Tengri was brought into Eastern Europe by the Huns and early Bulgars.

Tengri is considered to be the chief god who created all things. In addition to this celestial god, they also had minor divinities (&quot;Alps&quot;) that served the purposes of Tengri. 
As Gök Tanrı, he was the father of the sun (Koyash) and moon (Ay Tanrı) and also Umay, Erlik, and sometimes Ülgen.

==Mythology==
Tengri was the main god of the Turkic pantheon, controlling the celestial sphere. Tengri is considered to be similar to the Indo-European sky god, *Dyeus, and the structure of the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion is closer to that of the early Turks than to the religion of any people of Near Eastern or Mediterranean antiquity. In Christian Turkish usage &quot;Tengri&quot; is used for the father of Jesus, who is referred to as &quot;Tengri Oghli&quot; (Son of God) and &quot;Mshikha Tengri&quot; (Messiah God). Tengri is also compared to Allah and Khuda. Apart from foreign religious influences, as far as known today, the original Turkish concept of Tengri was that of &quot;heaven&quot; or a spirit ruling in heaven. This spirit was probably imagined as some sort of force, corresponding to &quot;mana&quot; in modern ethnology.

The most important contemporary testimony of Tengri worship is found in the Old Turkic Orkhon inscriptions, dated to the early 8th century.
Written in the so-called Orkhon script, these inscriptions record an account of the mythological origins of the Turks.
The inscription dedicated to Kul Tigin includes the passages (in the translation provided by the Language Committee of Ministry of Culture and Information of the Republic of Kazakhstan): &quot;When the blue sky [Tengri] above and the brown earth below were created, between them a human being was created. Over the human beings, my ancestors Bumin Kagan and Istemi Kagan ruled. They ruled people by Turkish laws, they led them and succeeded&quot; (face 1, line 1); &quot;Tengri creates death. Human beings have all been created in order to die&quot; (), (face 2, line 9); &quot;You passed away (lit.: &#x27;went flying&#x27;) until Tengri gives you life again&quot; (face 2, line 14). Khagans ruled by the will of Tengri thought the ancient Turkic people and preserved these thoughts in the texts of the
Orkhon inscriptions in the following way: &quot;I, Tengri-like and Tengri-born Turk Bilge Kaghan, succeeded to the throne at this time&quot; ().

In one Turkic myth, Tengri is a pure, white goose that flies constantly over an endless expanse of water, which represents time. Beneath this water, Ak Ana (&quot;White Mother&quot;) calls out to him saying &quot;Create&quot;. To overcome his loneliness, Tengri creates &quot;Er Kishi&quot;, who is not as pure or as white as Tengri and together they set up the world. &quot;Er Kishi&quot; becomes a demonic character and strives to mislead people and draw them into its darkness. Tengri assumes the name &quot;Tengri Ülgen&quot; and withdraws into Heaven from which he tries to provide people with guidance through sacred animals that he sends among them. The &quot;Ak Tengris&quot; occupy the fifth level of Heaven. Shaman priests who want to reach &quot;Tengri Ülgen&quot; never get further than this level, where they convey their wishes to the divine guides. Returns to earth or to the human level take place in a goose-shaped vessel.

<doc id="746149" wikidata="Q557330" url="?curid=746149" title="Inferno (Doctor Who)">
<text>Inferno is the fourth and final serial of the seventh season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in seven weekly parts on BBC1 from 9 May to 20 June 1970. The serial remains the last time a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story was transmitted in seven episodes. This serial was also the last regular appearance of Caroline John in the role of Liz Shaw.

In the serial, the alien time traveller the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) transports himself &quot;sideways in time&quot; to a parallel world, where a British drilling project causes catastrophic amounts of heat and force to be unleashed when it penetrates the Earth&#x27;s crust.

==Plot==
The Third Doctor and UNIT are called in to investigate a murder at Project Inferno, an effort to drill through the Earth&#x27;s crust to harness great energies within the planet&#x27;s core. It transpires that the drilling is producing a green ooze that transforms all who touch it into savage humanoid creatures called Primords, who can only be killed via extreme cold. Unbeknownst to anyone, the project leader, Professor Stahlman has been infected and is in the early stages of the change. After quarrelling with Stahlman, the Doctor attempts an experiment on the detached TARDIS console, but a freak accident transports him into a parallel space-time continuum.

In this new universe, where Great Britain is a fascist republic, the Doctor is captured and interrogated by Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart&#x27;s counterpart, a sadistic, eyepatch-wearing military commandant known as the Brigade Leader, along with the counterpart of the Doctor&#x27;s companion Liz, who in this universe became a military officer instead of a scientist. When the drill penetrates the Earth&#x27;s crust it unleashes immense amounts of seismic forces, heat, and poisonous gases, along with more of the ooze, which Stahlman&#x27;s counterpart, now mutated, uses to transform most of the remaining project staff into more Primords. The Doctor determines that the unleashed energies of the core will eventually disintegrate the planet and is able to persuade the surviving staff members to help him return to his own universe and prevent a similar catastrophe. They eventually succeed in restoring power to the TARDIS console despite repeated Primord attacks, but Liz&#x27;s counterpart is forced to kill the Brigade Leader when he turns on the Doctor, who narrowly escapes as the Project Inferno facility, and Britain itself, is destroyed by a massive volcanic eruption.

Back in his own reality, the Doctor urgently tries to have the drilling stopped, but like in the other reality his warnings are ignored. This time, however, the slower pace of the drilling means that Stahlman fully transforms into a Primord before the crust is penetrated instead of afterwards, and after the Doctor kills him with a fire extinguisher, the drilling is stopped in time to prevent disaster, saving the human race as a result. Satisfied that the TARDIS console is now working again, the Doctor attempts to depart, only to end up landing in a local rubbish dump.

==Production==

Scriptwriter Don Houghton was a personal friend of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; script editor, Terrance Dicks: they had worked together for Lew Grade at ATV in the 1960s, on the TV soap opera &quot;Crossroads&quot;. During a train journey, Houghton discussed with Dicks his idea for a serial based on the real life drilling project known as Project Mohole. Budgetary limitations eventually led to the concept of the parallel world, so that the same actors and sets could be used for seven episodes, rather than the four episodes in Houghton&#x27;s original story breakdown, in order to cut costs.

Despite Douglas Camfield receiving sole credit as director, the studio scenes for episodes 3 to 7 were directed by producer Barry Letts after Camfield had a minor heart attack on April 27, 1970. Letts later stated that Camfield&#x27;s preparations were so meticulous, he merely followed Camfield&#x27;s plans for Episodes 3 and 4, but the latter three episodes were largely his own work. Camfield remained credited as director, as BBC regulations at the time forbade Letts from being credited for more than one production role (i.e. as both producer and as director), but, more importantly, Letts did not want Camfield&#x27;s illness to become widely known lest it harm his career.

Stuntman Derek Ware did not actually perform the stunt in which his character, the mutated RSF Trooper Wyatt, having been shot, falls to his death from the top of one of the chemical tanks, in case he was injured (since he was also needed for the subsequent studio recording). His place was taken by Roy Scammell, who (ironically) also played the soldier who fired the fatal shot. Ware stated in an interview that Scammell had already signed the contract to do the fall before Ware had been cast as Wyatt. At the time it was filmed, it was the highest fall ever performed by a British stuntman.

John Levene&#x27;s portrayal of Benton as a Primord was inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard III&quot; (because of the Primord creature&#x27;s hump).

Caroline John said she enjoyed her role as Section Leader Elizabeth Shaw, as it was fun playing Liz as a &quot;baddie&quot;. She also said she hated doing the scenes in which she was playing her usual role, because it was boring compared to playing the parallel character. She was upset, though, about the scene in which Section-Leader Shaw shot Brigade Leader Lethbridge-Stewart, as she was pregnant at the time. As a result, the scene was recorded with the weapon fired from out-of-shot, after which Shaw was shown returning the gun to her holster. Her pregnancy made it impossible for her to continue in the show, and this became her final serial.

During the scenes set on the parallel Earth, images of the British Republic&#x27;s leader are seen on posters. The image used is that of BBC visual effects designer Jack Kine, in homage to the 1954 BBC adaptation of Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; in which the face of Big Brother was actually that of the BBC&#x27;s head of television design Roy Oxley (Kine had worked on the visual effects for that production).

Episode 6 has a small damaged section on the American NTSC videotape which was used as the source of the colour signal for the restoration, which the Doctor Who Restoration Team replaced by recolouring the appropriate section of the b/w film recording.

===Locations===
The exterior shots used in this production were filmed at Kingsnorth Industrial Estate on the Hoo peninsula, Kent which featured as the setting for the Inferno project.

===Music===
Director Douglas Camfield chose not to commission any new incidental music for the serial, but instead made use of existing library recordings by members of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. These included: &quot;Blue Veils &amp; Golden Sands&quot; and &quot;The Delian Mode&quot; (both by Delia Derbyshire); &quot;Battle Theme&quot;, &quot;Homeric Theme&quot;, &quot;Attack of the Alien Minds&quot; and &quot;Souls in Space&quot; (all by Brian Hodgson); and &quot;Build Up To&quot; (by David Vorhaus). In addition, as was usual, Brian Hodgson supplied new sound effects for the serial, including &quot;Tardis Control On &amp; Warp Transfer&quot;.

According to the DVD release notes from the ITV serial &quot;Timeslip&quot;, this music subsequently featured in the second episode of that show&#x27;s serial &quot;The Time Of The Ice Box&quot;.

===Cast notes===
Christopher Benjamin, who plays Sir Keith Gold, subsequently appeared as Henry Gordon Jago in &quot;The Talons of Weng-Chiang&quot; (1977), and as Colonel Hugh Curbishley in &quot;The Unicorn and the Wasp&quot; (2008). He also played Tardelli in the audio play &quot;Grand Theft Cosmos&quot;. Most recently, he has returned to play the character of Henry Gordon Jago in a long-running series of audio dramas titled &quot;Jago &amp; Litefoot&quot; based upon the situation established in &quot;The Talons of Weng-Chiang&quot;.

The role of Petra Williams was given to Sheila Dunn when Kate O&#x27;Mara was unavailable to play the part. O&#x27;Mara would, years later, be cast as the Rani, a renegade Time Lord. Dunn was the wife of this story&#x27;s co-director, Douglas Camfield, and had appeared twice before in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, in &quot;The Invasion&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot; (1965–66).

Ian Fairbairn (Bromley) had previously appeared as Questa in &quot;The Macra Terror&quot; (1967) and as Gregory in &quot;The Invasion&quot;, and would subsequently feature as Doctor Chester in &quot;The Seeds of Doom&quot; (1976).

Derek Newark (Greg Sutton) had previously played Za in the first ever &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial, &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;, in 1963.

Stuntman Alan Chuntz received a bad leg injury in episode 3 when he was hit by the car Jon Pertwee was driving. Pertwee felt so bad about it that he became ill himself, which threatened to disrupt filming.

==Broadcast and reception==
In 2009, Mark Braxton of &quot;Radio Times&quot; awarded the serial five stars out of five and praised the intense atmosphere, with a &quot;good, scary, cautionary&quot; plot. However, he noted that the Primords were not the best physical design and their relationship to the events was not cleared up. Reviewing the special edition DVD release, Dave Golder of &quot;SFX&quot; gave the serial four out of five stars. He wrote that the alternate universe plot that was (mistakenly cited as being) added to stretch out the story was &quot;the best thing about it&quot; and the actual plot felt &quot;a little B-movie in comparison, but ... remains a stylish and action-packed slice of Pertwee &quot;Who&quot;&quot;. DVD Talk&#x27;s Ian Jane rated &quot;Inferno&quot; three and a half out of five stars, praising the cast and &quot;decent&quot; production values. Jane noted that the story had a slow beginning, but once the pace picked up it became &quot;choice entertainment&quot;. In 2008, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named &quot;Inferno&quot; as one of the ten best &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes ever. It did so again in 2023. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed the cliffhanger of the sixth episode as one of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; greatest cliffhangers in a 2010 article. Den of Geek listed the serial as an example of good sound design and music score.

This serial was judged by a 2009 &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; fan poll to be the finest story of the Third Doctor&#x27;s era and 31st in the series overall (out of 200 stories total). A similar poll taken in 2014 ranked &quot;Inferno&quot; as the 18th-greatest story of all time.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in June 1984.

===Home media===
The original 625-line PAL videotapes were wiped for reuse in the mid 1970s. BBC Enterprises retained the black-and-white film recordings made for overseas sales. In 1985, a set of broadcast quality 525-line NTSC videotapes were returned from Canada. Due to the complexities of conversion, the original re-conversions back to 625-line PAL left the picture looking a little blurred and faded when the story was released on VHS in the UK in May 1994. Prior to this, episode 7 of the story had been included on the 1992 VHS release, &quot;The Pertwee Years&quot; (along with the final episodes of both &quot;The Dæmons&quot; and &quot;Frontier in Space&quot;). When &quot;Inferno&quot; was released on Region 2 DVD on 19 June 2006, however, the picture quality had been markedly enhanced through the use of the &quot;Reverse Standards Conversion&quot; procedure. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 44 on 8 September 2010.

A special-edition re-release of the story was released on 27 May 2013. This uses the same technique employed on the special-edition DVD of &quot;The Claws of Axos&quot;: the colour information from the Reverse Standards Conversion video was combined with luminance information from a geometrically-corrected remaster of the b/w 16mm-film recording, with VidFIRE applied to the studio interior scenes to recreate the 50-field interlaced look. The resulting picture is sharper than the RSC version.

The Canadian videotapes include an additional scene in Episode 5 that was not originally transmitted in the UK, but was retained for overseas screening (and has also appeared on both the UK Gold transmissions and BBC Video&#x27;s VHS release). Set in the Brigade Leader&#x27;s office with the Doctor, the Brigade Leader and Section Leader Shaw listening to a BBC radio news report voiced by Jon Pertwee, who imitates the style of William Joyce, the scene was cut before transmission because Pertwee&#x27;s voice was too identifiable. The radio announcer names the area where the Inferno project is taking place as Eastchester; the name is not mentioned anywhere else in the story, but is subsequently mentioned in spin-off media. The scene was included as an extra on the DVD releases, with the episode itself presented exactly as originally transmitted (using the b/w film recording for reference when editing).

<text>Amravati (/əmᵊɾɑʋᵊt̪iː/) is a city in Maharashtra located in the Vidarbha region. It is the ninth largest city in Maharashtra, India &amp; second largest city in the Vidarbha region in terms of population. It is the administrative headquarter of Amravati district as well as Amravati Division which includes Amravati District, Akola District, Buldhana District, Washim District &amp; Yavatmal District. It is one of Maharashtra&#x27;s nominated cities under Smart Cities Mission.

== Etymology ==
The ancient name of Amravati is &quot;&quot;Udumbravati&quot;, &quot;prākrut&quot; form of this is &quot;Umbravati&quot; and &quot;Amravati&quot;&quot; is known for many centuries with this name. &quot;Amravati&quot; is the incorrect pronunciation of this, and as a result, it now goes by that name. &quot;Amravati&quot; is claimed to have gotten its name from the city&#x27;s historic &quot;Ambadevi&quot; temple.

== History ==
Evidence of human settlement in &quot;Amravati&quot; in the 11th century comes from the marble statue of the Jain tirthankara Rishabhanatha. According to an inscription on its base, this statue was installed in 1097. When Govind Maha Prabhu visited Amravati in the 13th century, the region surrounding Amaravati was ruled by the Hindu King of Devagiree (Yadav).
Famine (drought) struck Amravati in the fourteenth century, and residents fled to Gujarat and Malwa. After several years, the locals were brought back to Amravati, where the population was sparse. Mager Aurangpura, now known as &quot;Sabanpura&quot;, was given to Jamia Masjid by Aurangzeb in the sixteenth century. This demonstrates that Muslims and Hindus coexist in this area. When Amravati became Bhosle ki Amravati in 1722, Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj gave Amrāvati and Badnera to Shri Ranoji Bhosle. The city was reconstructed and prospered by Ranoji Bhosle after the treaty of Devgaon and Anjangaon Surji and victory over Gavilgad (Fort of Chikhaldara).

The Amravati residents still refer to the location where the British general Colonel Wellesley camped as a camp. After the 18th century, the city of Amravati was founded. Amravati was governed by the Nizam and Bosale Union states. Although the revenue officer was appointed, the defense system suffered. British forces took control of Gavilgad Fort on 15 December 1803. According to the Deogaon pact, Nizam received the Warhād as a sign of friendship. Pindāri invaded Amravati city around 1805.

In 1983, Amravati became Vidarbha&#x27;s second Municipal corporation. Located about 663 (412  mi) kilometers east of the state capital Mumbai and 152 (94  mi) kilometers west of Nagpur, Amravati is the second largest city of the Vidarbha region after Nagpur.

== Geography ==
Amravati is located at . It has an average elevation of 343 meters (1125 feet). It lies west of Nagpur and serves as the administrative centre of Amravati District and of Amravati Division. The city is located near the passes through the hills that separate the cotton-growing regions of the Purna basin to the West and the Wardha basin to the East. Chikhaldara is about 80 km from Amravati city which is the only hill station in the Vidarbha region. The land area of the city is around .

===Climate ===
Amravati has a tropical wet and dry climate with hot, dry summers and mild to cool winters. Summer lasts from March to June, the monsoon season from July to October, and winter from November to March.

The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded were 49.1 °C on 25 May 2013 and 5.0 °C on 9 February 1887 respectively.

 Amravati has been ranked 2nd best “National Clean Air City” under (Category 2 3-10L Population cities) in India according to &#x27;Swachh Vayu Survekshan 2024 Results&#x27;

<doc id="746156" wikidata="Q206532" url="?curid=746156" title="Aloysia citrodora">
<text>Aloysia citrodora, lemon verbena, is a species of flowering plant in the verbena family Verbenaceae, native to South America. Other common names include lemon beebrush. It was brought to Europe by the Spanish and the Portuguese in the 17th century and cultivated for its oil.

==Description==
Lemon verbena is a perennial shrub or subshrub growing to high. The , glossy, pointed leaves are slightly rough to the touch and emit a strong lemon scent when bruised (hence the Latin specific epithet &quot;citrodora&quot;—lemon-scented).

Sprays of tiny purple or white flowers appear in late spring or early summer, although potted lemon verbenas may not flower. It is evergreen in tropical locations, but is sensitive to cold, losing leaves at temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F), although the wood is hardy to −10 °C (14 °F). Pruning is recommended in spring to encourage a bushy form. Due to its many culinary uses, it is widely listed and marketed as a plant for the herb garden. Researchers have identified anxiolytic effects in rat models.
==Uses==
Lemon verbena leaves are used to add a lemon flavor to fish and poultry dishes, vegetable marinades, salad dressings, jams, puddings, Greek yogurt, and beverages. The leaves are also used in potpourri. Lemon verbena is used to make herbal teas and as a liqueur flavoring. It is used in traditional medicine in Latin American countries. The oil was historically steam-distilled from the leaves for use in the perfume industry, but it has skin-sensitising and phototoxic properties. In the European Union, verbena essential oils (&quot;Lippia citriodora&quot; Kunth.) and derivatives other than absolute are prohibited when used as a fragrance ingredient (Regulation No. 1223/2009, Annex II).

==Chemistry==
The major isolates in lemon verbena oil are citral (30–35%), nerol, and geraniol. Extracts of lemon verbena also contain verbascoside. As the plant has several phytochemicals which may act as substrates for drug-metabolizing enzymes, lemon verbena may cause herb-drug interactions. However, lemon verbena oil is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the US Food and Drug Administration when used as a flavoring.

==Synonyms==
Synonyms for lemon verbena are &quot;Verbena triphylla&quot; L&#x27;Hér., &quot;Verbena citriodora&quot; Cav., &quot;Lippia triphylla&quot;, and &quot;Lippia citriodora&quot;.

==Garden history==
The first European botanist who publicly noticed this plant was the French Philibert Commerson, who collected it in Buenos Aires on his botanical circumnavigation with Bougainville, about 1767. The plant had already been imported directly into the Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid, where in 1797 professors Casimiro Gómez Ortega and named it, though they did not yet effectively publish it, &quot;Aloysia citriodora&quot; in Latin and &quot;Hierba de la Princesa&quot; in Spanish, to compliment Maria Louisa of Parma, Princess of Asturias the wife of the Garden&#x27;s patron Infante Carlos de Borbon, Prince of Asturias and son of king Carlos III. The name was later effectively published in the first volume of Palau&#x27;s &quot;Parte Práctica de Botánica&quot; in 1784.

Unofficial importations from Spanish America seldom fared well: when another French botanist Joseph Dombey landed his collections at Cadiz in 1785, the plants were impounded and left to rot in warehouses, while Dombey was refused permission even to have seeds planted. Among the bare handful of plants Dombey had assembled during eight years at Lima, lemon verbena survived. Gómez Ortega sent seeds and specimens of the plant to Charles Louis L&#x27;Héritier de Brutelle in Paris; L&#x27;Héritier published it as &quot;Verbena triphylla&quot; in his &quot;Stirpes Novae&quot;, published in December 1785 or January 1786. From Paris John Sibthorp, professor of botany at Oxford, obtained the specimen that he introduced to British horticulture: by 1797 lemon verbena was common in greenhouses around London, and its popularity as essential in a fragrant bouquet increased through the following century.

This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<doc id="746189" wikidata="Q696050" url="?curid=746189" title="Warlock (band)">
<text>Warlock was a German heavy metal band founded in 1982 in Düsseldorf by members of the underground bands Snakebite and Beast. The band gained popularity and some commercial success in Europe in the mid-1980s, due to the personality and stage presence of lead vocalist Doro Pesch. Warlock supported successful heavy metal bands on tour, such as W.A.S.P., Judas Priest, Dio and Megadeth.

By the end of the decade, Doro Pesch was the sole original member who remained in the band and she was forced to change the name to Doro for legal reasons. Doro, the band, continues to play several songs taken from the Warlock repertoire in their live shows.

The band has reunited for festival appearances and special occasions since 2003, under the name Warlock 1986.

==History==
===Formation and first contract===
The first nucleus of the band was formed under the name Snakebite in Düsseldorf, West Germany in 1980, and was composed of Doro Pesch on vocals, Michael Bastian on guitar, Frank Rittel on bass and Thomas Franke on drums, the latter coming from the band Stallion. Franke was soon replaced by Michael Eurich and, just before disbanding, Snakebite acquired the left-handed Peter Szigeti as second guitarist from Beast. Snakebite and Beast were two of the many bands playing in the local clubs and bars and recording cheap demos to promote their music. Pesch, Szigeti and Eurich did try-outs with other groups, but in October 1982 went on to form a new band with Thomas Studier on bass and guitarist Rudy Graf, who came up with the name Warlock and a bucket full of songs. The new band found a manager in Peter Zimmermann, who arranged gigs in support of German hard rockers Trance, contributing to build a solid reputation for Warlock in the local underground metal scene.

After recording a four-track demo and sending it to several record labels and music magazines, the band obtained a contract with the Belgian independent label Mausoleum Records. Frank Rittel joined Warlock on bass before they started recording their debut album &quot;Burning the Witches&quot; in 1984, with producer Axel Thubeauville, a talent scout of German heavy metal groups. &quot;Burning the Witches&quot; was recorded in only six days and remixed by Rainer Assmann and Henry Staroste before publication.

The album was well received by critics and fans and Warlock toured for the first time outside of Germany to launch their first release, often alongside their label mates Steeler. Unfortunately, bad distribution and poor financing for the tour from the record label crippled the commercial potential of the album, leaving the band profoundly dissatisfied with Mausoleum.

===&quot;Hellbound&quot; and &quot;True as Steel&quot;===
In early 1985, the band signed a contract with the major label Phonogram and recorded their second album &quot;Hellbound&quot;, produced by Henry Staroste and released in May 1985 on Vertigo Records in Europe. The band started to receive attention from the media and appeared in TV shows in the UK and Germany. Their first full European tour brought them to Camden Palace Theater in London, where the concert was filmed for Warlock&#x27;s first video release &quot;Metal Racer&quot;. Warlock&#x27;s live performance was welcomed with a rave review by the British magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and the group was elected &#x27;Best New Band&#x27; of 1985 in the Readers&#x27; Poll of that magazine. Doro Pesch was also elected Best Female Singer by the readers of the music magazine &quot;Metal Forces&quot; at the end of 1984. The band played at the Metal Hammer Festival at Loreley, Germany in September, alongside Metallica, Venom, Running Wild, Pretty Maids, Nazareth and Wishbone Ash.

Later that year, after the tour for &quot;Hellbound&quot;, guitarist Rudy Graf left the band and was replaced by Niko Arvanitis, a former bandmate of Rittel in Stormwind.

This updated line-up recorded the album &quot;True as Steel&quot; in May–June 1986, produced again by Henry Staroste and mixed in the US by Michael Wagener. The album received mixed reviews, but was Warlock&#x27;s highest-charting in Germany, climbing up to No. 18, and got a fair amount of radio airplay in the US, due to the single &quot;Fight for Rock&quot;. The band&#x27;s first music video was made for that song and appeared on MTV.

On 16 August 1986, Doro Pesch was the first woman to front a band at the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington, England, where Warlock played on the same stage of Motörhead, Def Leppard, Ozzy Osbourne and Scorpions. Warlock also opened the Monsters of Rock festival at the Maimarktgelände Eisstadion in Mannheim, West Germany, with a line-up similar to the British show and the addition of McAuley Schenker Group and Bon Jovi. 1986 and 1987 were spent on a tour which included UK dates supporting W.A.S.P., and European dates supporting metal superstars Judas Priest, during their &#x27;Fuel for Life&#x27; tour.

===International breakthrough and change of name===
After the tour for &quot;True as Steel&quot;, Pesch spent time in the US with new manager Alex Grob to promote the band and arrange tours and recordings in America. At the same time, Szigeti and Rittel decided to leave the band, apparently unwilling to face the commitment that a transfer to the United States would involve. They were promptly replaced by the American musicians Tommy Bolan (formerly of Armed Forces), and Tommy Henriksen. With the new line-up, Warlock recorded in the US their fourth and last studio album, &quot;Triumph and Agony&quot;, produced by Joey Balin in 1987. &quot;Triumph and Agony&quot; was Warlock&#x27;s best-selling album, going Gold in Germany and reaching number 80 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 US album chart. The videos for the singles &quot;All We Are&quot; and &quot;Für Immer&quot;, shot respectively in the Los Angeles river basin and in the swamps of Baton Rouge, were on rotation on MTV&#x27;s heavy metal program &quot;Headbangers&#x27; Ball&quot;.
Warlock toured Europe as support band for Dio and, after that, proceeded to make their first and sole extensive US tour, opening for Megadeth alongside Sanctuary. They played also several shows on their own with different opening acts, such as Fates Warning, Sword and Lillian Axe. Eurich and Arvanitis quit after the tour and were replaced by Bobby Rondinelli (formerly of Rainbow) and guitarist Jon Levin (sometimes mislabeled as Jon Devin).

At the end of 1988, Doro Pesch remained the only original member and the only German still in the band. At this time, Peter Zimmermann, the band&#x27;s ex-manager, sued for rights to the band name and merchandise, and won. Pesch continued to fight for the name, but conceded with record label requests to rename the band DORO in order to continue her career; the first edition of the LP &quot;Force Majeure&quot;, recorded with the final formation of Warlock, was the last one to expose a sticker with the name of the band next to DORO, with the exception of the compilation &quot;Rare Diamonds&quot; of 1991. Pesch eventually regained the rights to the name Warlock in 2011, after years of legal battles. DORO is an active band and still performs Warlock songs in their live shows.

===Other activities===
After his departure from Warlock, Rudy Graf joined the German speed metal band Rage in 1986 and recorded with them the album &quot;Execution Guaranteed&quot;. Today he&#x27;s working as a studio musician and songwriter.

Frank Rittel, Peter Szigeti and former Snakebite drummer Thomas Franke played in 1987 on &quot;Animal House&quot;, the first solo album by the former Accept singer Udo Dirkschneider. Rittel and Szigeti formed in the 1990s the melodic metal bands Energy and Coracko, without much success.

Michael Eurich formed the band Casanova with singer Michael Voss, which was active at end of the 80s.

Doro Pesch reunited with Szigeti, Arvanitis, Rittel and Eurich to perform as Warlock at her 20th Anniversary celebration concert in Düsseldorf on 13 December 2003 and later at Wacken Open Air festival 2004. More legal troubles over using the name Warlock ensued with former member Rudy Graf and appearances of the reunited band at festivals and special concerts were billed as &quot;Warlock 1986&quot;. Frank Rittel quit playing bass and retired from the music business in 2004.

Arvanitis and Szigeti played together in late April 2005 at the &#x27;Rock Classic Allstars&#x27; show in Bochum, Germany, with Martin Kesici, Axel Rudi Pell, Kai Hoffmann, Jeff Brown (ex-Sweet) and German soccer star Holger Aden.

In December 2008, Pure Steel Records released the first official tribute album to Warlock, titled &quot;Tribute to Steel&quot;, with the special appearance of the band members.

Since 2011, Tommy Henriksen has been a member of Alice Cooper&#x27;s solo band, and since 2012 he has also been a member of Hollywood Vampires, a supergroup that also includes Cooper, Joe Perry, and Johnny Depp.

==Music and style==
Warlock were one of the few successful female-fronted heavy metal bands in the circuit during the 80s, when the scene was dominated by male singers. Doro Pesch&#x27;s voice and stage presence immediately caught the attention of fans and press, and she became the principal means of promotion for the band, as well as the main spokesperson for Warlock.

Warlock&#x27;s music is always primarily described as heavy metal, and the band cite as main influences 1970s metal acts such as Judas Priest, Scorpions, Accept, and groups from the new wave of British heavy metal movement.

Warlock&#x27;s sound and songwriting evolved from the traditional heavy metal of their debut album &quot;Burning the Witches&quot; to the faster and darker &quot;Hellbound&quot;, which incorporates elements of power metal, such as fast tempos, powerful choruses and fantasy-inspired lyrics. &quot;True as Steel&quot; is a more commercial album, where any reference to fantasy and the occult in the lyrics was abandoned. &quot;Triumph and Agony&quot; recovers elements of the first albums, but veers also towards a melodic and FM radio-friendly sound, influenced by the US production.

Power ballads were also characteristic of Warlock and are present in the track listings of every album.

<doc id="746193" wikidata="Q3066254" url="?curid=746193" title="Family Tree (Björk album)">
<text>Family Tree is a box set of musical material by Icelandic singer Björk. The set consists of a book of lyrics entitled &quot;Words&quot;, five 3-inch compact discs of rare and previously unreleased material, and a regular-sized compact disc of greatest hits selected by Björk herself. &quot;Family Tree&quot; was released in November 2002, concurrent with the release of Björk&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, in which the tracks were selected by her fans.

==Information==
The five 3-inch compact discs include: &quot;Roots&quot; CD 1, which features songs recorded before Björk&#x27;s &quot;second solo debut&quot; (i.e. previous to her 1993 album &quot;Debut&quot;). This compact disc features songs by her previous bands: Kukl, the Elgar Sisters, and the Sugarcubes. &quot;Roots&quot; CD 2 features B-sides and alternate versions of album tracks; &quot;Beats&quot;, which focuses on both new and old songs with a heavier electronica influence; and finally &quot;Strings&quot; CDs 1 and 2, which feature live and studio recordings of Björk with the Brodsky Quartet through 1999 and 2000.

The artwork on the CD was designed by M/M Paris in collaboration with Icelandic contemporary artist Gabríela Friðriksdóttir. The cover consists of a tree with letter on the upper part.

A music video for the song &quot;Nature is Ancient&quot;, directed by Lynn Fox, was released in November 2002 to promote the compilation, even though the song was originally released in 1997. Originally, it was a B-side to the &quot;Bachelorette&quot; single, but it was later included on &quot;Family Tree&quot;. The video was also released on the compilation &quot;Greatest Hits - Volumen 1993–2003&quot;.

Björk&#x27;s notes for the project, as featured on the individual CD artworks, reveal that &quot;Immature&quot; and &quot;My Spine&quot; were initially considered to feature on the compilation, as well as track(s) recorded with British composer John Tavener.

<doc id="746196" wikidata="Q895177" url="?curid=746196" title="Bouquet garni">
<text>The bouquet garni (French for &quot;garnished bouquet&quot;; ) is a bundle of herbs usually tied with string and mainly used to prepare soup, stock, casseroles and various stews. The bouquet is cooked with the other ingredients and removed prior to consumption. Liquid remaining in the bouquet garni can be wrung out into the dish.

There is no standard recipe for &quot;bouquet garni&quot;, but most French recipes include thyme, bay leaf and parsley. It may also include basil, burnet, chervil, rosemary, peppercorns, savory and tarragon. Vegetables such as carrot, celery (leaves or leaf stalks), celeriac, leek, onion and parsley root are sometimes included in the &quot;bouquet&quot;.

Sometimes, the &quot;bouquet&quot; is not bound with string, and its ingredients are filled into a small sachet, a piece of celery stalk, a net, or a tea strainer instead. Traditionally, the aromatics are bound within leek leaves, though a cheesecloth, muslin or coffee filter tied with butcher twine can be used.

==Use in dishes==

Dishes made with a &quot;bouquet garni&quot; include:
* &quot;Boeuf bourguignon&quot;
* &quot;Blanquette de veau&quot;
* &quot;Bouillabaisse&quot;
* Brown Windsor soup
* &quot;Carbonnade flamande&quot;
* &quot;Cassoulet&quot;
* &quot;Coq au vin&quot;
* &quot;Court-bouillon&quot;
* French onion soup
* &quot;Lapin chasseur&quot; (huntsman&#x27;s rabbit)
* &quot;Ossobuco&quot;
* &quot;Pot-au-feu&quot;
* &quot;Poule au pot&quot;
* &quot;Tripes à la mode de Caen

<text>The AAU James E. Sullivan Award, presented by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), is awarded annually to &quot;the most outstanding athlete at the collegiate or Olympic level in the United States&quot;.

The award was established in 1930 in honor of the organization&#x27;s founder and past president, James Edward Sullivan. Based on the qualities of leadership, character, and sportsmanship, the AAU Sullivan Award &quot;goes far beyond athletic accomplishments and honors those who have shown strong moral character&quot;. Finalists are selected from public nominations following a review by the AAU Sullivan Award Executive Committee. Approximately 10 semi-finalists are chosen, and the eventual winner is determined by votes from various members of the nationwide news media, former winners and AAU personnel. More recently, a portion of the winner&#x27;s vote has been determined by the general public. Recipients are eligible for subsequent awards, and in 2023, Caitlin Clark became the first repeat winner. In 1999, 2015, 2019, and 2020, the award was shared between two co-recipients.

The inaugural winner of the award was golfer Bobby Jones, winner of 13 majors between 1923 and 1930. The first female recipient, in 1944, was swimmer Ann Curtis, who won more national AAU championships than any other woman. 34 track and field athletes have won the AAU Sullivan Award—the most by any sport.

<text>Detective Superintendent Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; Dalziel and Detective Sergeant, later Detective Inspector, Peter Pascoe are two fictional Yorkshire detectives featuring in a series of novels by Reginald Hill.

==Characterisation and style==
Dalziel is depicted as being rude, insensitive and blunt, whereas Pascoe is calm, polite and well mannered.

Hill&#x27;s mysteries often break with storytelling tradition. The novels employ various structural tricks, such as presenting parts of the story in non-chronological order, or alternating with sections from a novel supposedly written by Peter&#x27;s wife, Ellie Pascoe (née Soper). The novella &quot;One Small Step&quot; is even set in the future, and deals with the detectives investigating a murder on the moon. In another departure from the norm, the duo do not always &quot;get their man&quot;, with at least one novel ending with the villain getting away and another strongly implying that what Dalziel and Pascoe dismiss as a series of unrelated accidents actually included at least one undetected instance of murder.

==Adaptations==
===Television===

* ITV adapted the novel &quot;A Pinch of Snuff&quot; in 1993 for a three-part serial. The serial starred comedy duo Gareth Hale as Dalziel and Norman Pace as Pascoe. Christopher Fairbank was cast as DS Edgar Wield. Reginald Hill was not happy with the adaptation, and it remained a one-off, much to ITV&#x27;s disappointment.
* The BBC created a more successful series of adaptations, beginning in March 1996, with an adaptation of the first novel, &quot;A Clubbable Woman&quot;. Produced by BBC Birmingham, the series starred Warren Clarke as Dalziel, Colin Buchanan as Pascoe, David Royle as DS Edgar &quot;Wieldy&quot; Wield and Susannah Corbett as Ellie Pascoe. Later series introduced Jo-Anne Stockham as DC Shirley &quot;Ivor&quot; Novello, Keeley Forsyth as DC Carrie &quot;Tweedie&quot; Harris, Katy Cavanagh as DS Dawn &quot;Spike&quot; Milligan and Jennifer James as DC Kim &quot;Posh&quot; Spicer. Twelve series were produced in total, concluding in June 2007. The BBC series won much critical acclaim from newspapers such as &quot;The Daily Express&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. The television and novel continuities are separate, with both Ellie and Wield having appeared in the most recent books, despite having been written out of the TV series.

===Radio===
In 1990, &quot;Exit Lines&quot; was adapted as a five part serial for BBC Radio 4. Dalziel and Pascoe were voiced by Philip Jackson and Donald Gee, respectively.

<doc id="746221" wikidata="Q1327963" url="?curid=746221" title="Xevious">
<text>is a vertically scrolling shooter arcade video game developed and published by Namco in 1982. It was released in Japan by Namco and in North America by Atari, Inc. Controlling the Solvalou starship, the player attacks Xevious forces before they destroy all of mankind. The Solvalou has two weapons at its disposal: a &quot;zapper&quot; to destroy flying craft, and a &quot;blaster&quot; to bomb ground installations and enemies. It runs on the Namco Galaga arcade system.

The game was designed by Masanobu Endō and a small team. Created to rival the success of &quot;Scramble&quot;, it was originally themed around the Vietnam War and titled &quot;Cheyenne&quot;. Endō wanted the game to have a detailed, integral storyline and a comprehensive world, and to be welcoming for newer players. Several enemies and characters were made to pay homage to other popular science fiction works, including &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;UFO&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot;, and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;.

&quot;Xevious&quot; was praised for its detailed graphics, challenge, and originality. It became an unprecedented success for Namco in Japan, with record-breaking sales figures making it the biggest game since &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. The North American release paled in comparison, despite still selling 5,295 arcade units by the end of 1983. It has been listed among the greatest video games of all time and one of the most influential games in the shoot &#x27;em up genre, establishing the template for vertically scrolling shooters and inspiring games such as &quot;TwinBee&quot; and &quot;RayForce&quot;. It was ported to home systems, followed by several sequels and spin-offs, and is included in many Namco compilations.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Xevious&quot; is a vertically scrolling shooter. The player controls a flying attack craft, the Solvalou, to destroy the Xevious forces plotting to take over Earth. The Solvalou has two weapons: a &quot;zapper&quot; that fires projectiles at flying enemies and a &quot;blaster&quot; for bombing ground installations and vehicles. A reticle in front of the ship shows where bombs will land.

The game has a total of 16 connected areas, which loop back to the first after completing them all. Dying about 70% through starts the player at the beginning of the next. Areas are geographically distinct, with features such as forests, roads, rivers, and mechanical structures. Certain areas have Nazca lines placed on the ground, some in the &quot;condor&quot; design.

The game becomes progressively more difficult as the player becomes more skilled. Once the player does well at destroying a certain enemy type, a more advanced enemy type replaces it. Destroying flashing-red &quot;Zolback&quot; radars found on the ground will cause the game to switch back to easier enemies.

Certain points in the game have a fight against the Andor Genesis mothership, which launch an endless stream of projectiles and explosive black spheres known as &quot;Zakatos&quot;. The player can either destroy all four blaster receptacles or the core in the center to defeat it. Some parts of the game have hidden towers (&quot;Sol Citadels&quot;), which can be found by bombing specific parts of an area. The Solvalou&#x27;s bomb reticle flashes red when over one. Yellow &quot;Special Flags&quot; from Namco&#x27;s own &quot;Rally-X&quot; are found in a semi-random section of the area. Collecting one gives an extra life.

==Development==
&quot;Xevious&quot; was designed by Masanobu Endō, who joined Namco in April 1981 as a planner. He and a small team were assigned by Namco&#x27;s marketing department to create a two-button scrolling shooter that could rival the success of Konami&#x27;s arcade game &quot;Scramble&quot; (1981). Early versions of the game were named &quot;Cheyenne&quot; and took place during the Vietnam War, with the player controlling a helicopter to shoot down enemies. (The original name may refer to the Vietnam-era Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne advanced attack helicopter project.) After the development team was reshuffled and the project planner quit altogether, Endō became the head designer for the game. He learned programming on the job during production.

Endō wanted the game to have a consistent, detailed world with a story that didn&#x27;t feel like a &quot;tacked-on extra&quot;, instead being an integral part of the game. The goal of the project was for the game to be inviting for newer players, and to become gradually more difficult as they became better at the game. Influenced by ray-tracing, Endō wanted the game&#x27;s sprites to be high-quality and detailed, while also making sure they fit the limitations of the arcade board it ran on. The team used a method that involved giving each sprite different shades of gray, allowing sprites to display additional colors. Many of the sprites were designed by Endō himself, although some were done by Hiroshi &quot;Mr. Dotman&quot; Ono, including the player and the background designs.

Many of the game&#x27;s characters and structures were designed and refined by Shigeki Toyama, who previously worked on many of Namco&#x27;s robotics for their amusement centers in the early 1980s. The player&#x27;s ship, the Solvalou, is based on the &quot;Nostromo&quot; space tug from &quot;Alien&quot;, while several of the enemies are homages to starships from popular science fiction works, including &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;UFO&quot; and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;.

Concept art for the Andor Genesis mothership depicted it with a more circular design, nicknamed &quot;Gofuru&quot; due to it bearing resemblance to gofuru cookies. The design was changed to instead be the shape of an octagon as the hardware had difficulty displaying round objects, while still keeping much of its key features such as the central core and blaster receptacles. Endō created a fictional language during development called &quot;Xevian&quot; that he used to name each of the enemies.

The blaster target for the Solvalou, which flashes red when over an enemy to signal the player to fire a bomb at it, was added to make it easier to destroy ground targets. While programming it, Endō thought it would be interesting to have the blaster target flash over a blank space where an enemy wasn&#x27;t present, leading to the addition of the Sol citadels. Namco executives expressed displeasure towards the idea, with Endō instead claiming they were simply a bug in the program and leaving them in the code.

The Special Flag icons from &quot;Rally-X&quot; were added due to Endō being a fan of the game. The game was originally named &quot;Zevious&quot;, the &quot;X&quot; being added to make it sound more exotic and mysterious, with the metallic logo paying homage to the pinball table &quot;Xenon&quot;. Location testing for &quot;Xevious&quot; was conducted in December 1982, and the game was released in Japan in January 1983. In the months following, Atari, Inc. acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute it in North America, advertising it as &quot;the Atari game you can&#x27;t play at home&quot;.

==Ports==
The first home conversion of &quot;Xevious&quot; was for the Family Computer in 1984, being one of the system&#x27;s first third-party titles. Copies of the game sold out within three days, with Namco&#x27;s telephone lines being flooded with calls from players in need of gameplay tips. The Famicom version was released internationally for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Bandai, in North America and PAL regions. A version for the Apple II was released the same year. A Commodore 64 version was published by U.S. Gold and released in 1987. Atari, Inc. published an Atari 7800 version as one of the system&#x27;s 13 launch titles in 1984. The Famicom version was re-released as a budget title for the Famicom Disk System in 1990. Versions for the Atari 2600 and Atari 5200 were completed but never released. The Atari 2600 port was programmed by Tod Frye.

Three mobile phone versions were released; the first for J-Sky in 2002, renamed &quot;Xevious Mini&quot;, the second for i-Mode the same year, and the third for EZweb in 2003. The NES version was re-released for the Game Boy Advance in 2004 as part of the &quot;Classic NES Series&quot; line. The arcade version was released for the Xbox 360 in 2007, featuring support for achievements and online leaderboards. The Wii Virtual Console received the NES version in 2006 and the arcade version in 2009.

A remake for the Nintendo 3DS was released in 2011 as part of the 3D Classics series, named &quot;3D Classics: Xevious&quot;, which took advantage of the handheld&#x27;s 3D screen technology. The NES version was released for the Wii U Virtual Console in 2013, and was also added to the Nintendo Switch Online service in March 2023. The arcade version, along with &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, was released for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 as part of Hamster&#x27;s &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; line in 2021.

&quot;Xevious&quot; is included in Namco compilations including &quot;Namco Museum Vol. 1&quot; (1995), &quot;Namco Museum Battle Collection&quot; (2005), &quot;Namco Museum 50th Anniversary&quot; (2005), &quot;Namco Museum Remix&quot; (2006), &quot;Namco Museum DS&quot; (2007), &quot;Namco Museum Virtual Arcade&quot; (2008), and &quot;Namco Museum Essentials&quot; (2009). The PlayStation home port of &quot;Xevious 3D/G&quot; includes the original &quot;Xevious&quot; as an extra, alongside its sequels &quot;Super Xevious&quot; and &quot;Xevious Arrangement&quot;. It is included as one of the five titles in &quot;Microsoft Revenge of Arcade&quot;, released for Windows in 1998. The 2005 GameCube game &quot;Star Fox: Assault&quot; includes the NES version as an unlockable extra, awarded by collecting all silver medals in the game. For the game&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 2012, it was released for iOS devices as part of the &quot;Namco Arcade&quot; compilation.

==Reception==
The arcade game received positive reviews upon release. &quot;Computer &amp; Video Games&quot; magazine praised the game&#x27;s thrilling action and impressive graphics, recommending it to players fond of titles such as &quot;Zaxxon&quot; and &quot;Scramble&quot;, while &quot;Electronic Games&quot; found that the realistic graphics and intense action made &quot;Xevious&quot; an easy recommendation to fans of the genre. &quot;Joystik&quot; stated that the game was superior to titles &quot;Zaxxon&quot; and &quot;Tron&quot;, specifically in its graphics and gameplay.

&quot;Amusement Life&quot; praised its detailed backgrounds, fast-paced gameplay and sense of mystery, labeling it a masterpiece and one of the best games of 1983. In 1998, &quot;Allgame&quot; called it one of the more &quot;polite&quot; shoot&#x27;em ups for its detailed visuals, challenge and unique enemy designs, finding it to have a &quot;charm&quot; unmatched by other games of the genre.

Home versions of &quot;Xevious&quot; received praise for their faithfulness to the original. &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; commended the ZX Spectrum version&#x27;s accurate conversion of the arcade original, while also praising its fast-paced gameplay and &quot;enthralling&quot; experience. &quot;Nintendojo&quot; greatly praised the &quot;Classic NES Series&quot; version for its gameplay and multiplayer mode, favorably comparing it to games such as &quot;Gradius&quot;. They felt that its responsive controls and &quot;chaotic&quot; difficulty made it one of the best titles released under the label.

Some home releases were met with a more mixed reception for their overall quality and lack of bonus features. Reviewing the Nintendo Entertainment System release, German publication &quot;Power Play&quot; found the game to be &quot;too old&quot;, suggesting that readers instead try out titles such as &quot;Gradius&quot;. They also disliked the game&#x27;s lack of power-ups and for areas being too long. &quot;GameSpot&quot; applauded the Xbox 360 digital version&#x27;s emulation quality and usage of online leaderboards, but &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot; both disliked the lack of improvements made over previous home releases and bonus content.

Retrospectively, &quot;Xevious&quot; has been seen as the &quot;father&quot; of vertical-scrolling shooters and one of the most influential and important games of the genre. In 1995, Flux magazine rated the game 88th on their Top 100 Video Games writing: &quot;Xevious ushered in a new age of scrolling overhead shooters in 1984 with its detailed graphics, multi-level targets and catchy theme music.&quot; In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it at #90 in their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, praising its art direction, intense gameplay and layer of strategy.
&quot;Gamest&quot; magazine ranked it the second greatest arcade game of all time in 1997 based on reader vote, applauding its pre-rendered visuals, addictive nature and historical significance.

Japanese publication &quot;Yuge&quot; found the Famicom home port to be one of the system&#x27;s best and most memorable titles for its faithful portrayal of the original. &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; applauded the game for setting up the template for future games of the genre, namely &quot;TwinBee&quot;, &quot;RayForce&quot; and &quot;Raiden DX&quot;. They also praised the game&#x27;s detailed graphics, difficulty and impressive enemy intelligence for the time. &quot;IGN&quot; labeled it the 9th greatest Atari 7800 game of all time for its gameplay and overall quality.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Xevious&quot; was an unprecedented success for Namco in Japan. In its first few weeks on the market, it recorded record-breaking sales figures that hadn&#x27;t been seen since &quot;Space Invaders&quot; in 1978. It was the top-grossing table arcade cabinet on Japan&#x27;s &quot;Game Machine&quot; arcade charts in November 1983. In North American arcades, it was a more moderate success, reaching number-four on the &quot;Play Meter&quot; arcade charts in July 1983. Atari sold 5,295 arcade cabinets in the US by the end of 1983, earning about $11.1 million (equivalent to $ in ) in US cabinet sales revenue.

The Famicom version became the console&#x27;s first killer app with over 1.26 million copies sold in Japan, jumping system sales by nearly 2 million units. The game&#x27;s immense popularity led to high score tournaments being set up across the country, alongside the creation of strategy guidebooks that documented much of its secrets and hidden items. The NES version went on to sell game cartridges worldwide.

==Legacy==
&quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; creator Fukio Mitsuji and &quot;Rez&quot; producer Tetsuya Mizuguchi cite &quot;Xevious&quot; as having a profound influence on their careers.

&quot;Xevious&quot; is credited as one of the first video games to have a boss fight, pre-rendered graphics and a storyline. In 1985, Roger C. Sharpe of &quot;Play Meter&quot; magazine stated that the &quot;dimensionalized, overhead perspective of modern, detailed graphics was launched with &quot;Xevious&quot;.&quot;

===Sequels and spin-offs===
&quot;Super Xevious&quot; was released in 1984. The difficulty was increased to appeal to more advanced players, alongside new enemy types and characters that reset the player&#x27;s score when shot. A similarly titled game was released in 1986 for the Family Computer, &quot;Super Xevious: GAMP no Nazo&quot;, which intermixed puzzle elements with the standard &quot;Xevious&quot; gameplay. An arcade version of this game was also released, known as &quot;Vs. Super Xevious&quot;, running on the Nintendo Vs. arcade system. An arcade spin-off title starring one of the enemies from &quot;Xevious&quot;, &quot;Grobda&quot;, was released in 1984.

Two games for the MSX2 and PC-Engine were released in 1988 and 1990 respectively - &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, both of which include a remade port of the original alongside a brand-new story mode with new enemies, boss fights and power-up items. A 3D rail-shooter spin-off, &quot;Solvalou&quot;, was published in 1991. In 1995, two arcade sequels were released - &quot;Xevious Arrangement&quot;, a remake of the original with two-player co-op, and &quot;Xevious 3D/G&quot;, a 3D game with 2D gameplay - both of these titles were soon released in 1997 for the PlayStation, compiled into &quot;Xevious 3D/G+&quot;, alongside the original &quot;Xevious&quot; and &quot;Super Xevious&quot;. A final follow-up was released in 2009, &quot;Xevious Resurrection&quot;, exclusively as part of the compilation title &quot;Namco Museum Essentials&quot;, which includes two-player simultaneous co-op alongside a number of other features.

===Music and books===
In 1991, a three-part &quot;Xevious&quot; novel was published, titled &quot;Fardraut&quot; - the books documented the lore of the &quot;Xevious&quot; video game series, including its characters, backstory and events. The books would be republished fifteen years later in 2005. A 2002 CGI film adaptation was released in Japan, produced during a collaboration between Namco and Japanese company Groove Corporation.

A &quot;Xevious&quot;-themed soundtrack album was produced by Haruomi Hosono of Yellow Magic Orchestra in 1984, titled &quot;Video Game Music&quot;. Compiled with music from other Namco video games, such as &quot;Mappy&quot; and &quot;Pole Position&quot;, it is credited as the first video game soundtrack album. &quot;Xevious&quot; would also spawn the first gameplay recording for a video game and the first television commercial for an arcade game. Music from the game was used during the video game-themed television series &quot;Starcade&quot;.

<doc id="746225" wikidata="Q1065033" url="?curid=746225" title="Prosciutto">
<text>Prosciutto crudo, in English often shortened to prosciutto ( , ), is uncooked, unsmoked, and dry-cured ham. &quot;Prosciutto crudo&quot; is usually served thinly sliced.

Several regions in Italy have their own variations of &quot;prosciutto crudo&quot;, each with degrees of protected status, but the most prized are &quot;Prosciutto di Parma&quot; DOP, from Emilia-Romagna, and &quot;Prosciutto di San Daniele&quot; DOP, from Friuli-Venezia Giulia. Unlike speck (Speck Alto Adige) from the South Tyrol region, prosciutto is not smoked. There is also a tradition of making prosciutto in southern Switzerland.

In Italian, &quot;prosciutto&quot; means any type of ham, either dry-cured (&quot;prosciutto crudo&quot; or simply &quot;crudo&quot;) or cooked (&quot;prosciutto cotto&quot;), but in English-speaking countries, it usually means either Italian &quot;prosciutto crudo&quot; or similar hams made elsewhere. However, the word &quot;prosciutto&quot; itself is not protected; cooked ham may legally be, and in practice is, sold as &quot;prosciutto&quot; (usually as &quot;prosciutto cotto&quot;, and from Italy or made in the Italian style) in English-speaking regions.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;prosciutto&quot; derives in turn from Italian &quot;asciutto&quot; (), with prefix substitution, or from Vulgar Latin &quot;pro&quot; (before) + &quot;exsuctus&quot; (past participle of &quot;exsugere&quot;, &#x27;to suck out [the moisture]&#x27;); the Portuguese &quot;presunto&quot; has the same etymology. It is similar to the modern Italian verb &quot;prosciugare&quot; (&#x27;to dry thoroughly&#x27;; from Latin &quot;pro&quot; + &quot;exsucare&quot; (&#x27;to extract the juices from&#x27;)).

==Manufacture==

Prosciutto is made from either a pig&#x27;s or a wild boar&#x27;s hind leg or thigh, and the base term prosciutto specifically refers to this product. Prosciutto may also be made using the hind leg of other animals, in which case the name of the animal is included in the name of the product, for example &quot;prosciutto di agnello&quot; (). The process of making prosciutto can take from nine months to two years, depending on the size of the ham.

A writer on Italian food, Bill Buford, describes talking to an old Italian butcher who says:
Today, the ham is first cleaned, salted, and left for about two months. During this time, the ham is pressed gradually and carefully to drain all blood left in the meat without breaking the bone. Next, it is washed several times to remove the salt and is hung in a dark, well-ventilated environment. The surrounding air is important to the final quality of the ham; the best results are obtained in a cold climate. The ham is then left until dry. The time this takes varies, depending on the local climate and size of the ham. When the ham is completely dry, it is hung to air, either at room temperature or in a controlled environment, for up to 18 months.

Prosciutto is sometimes cured with nitrites (either sodium or potassium), which are generally used in other hams to produce the desired rosy colour and unique flavour, but only sea salt is used in protected designation of origin (PDO) hams. Such rosy pigmentation is produced by a direct chemical reaction of nitric oxide with myoglobin to form nitrosomyoglobin, followed by concentration of the pigments due to drying. Bacteria convert the added nitrite or nitrate to nitric oxide.

==European Union–protected designations of origin==

===&quot;Prosciutto crudo&quot;===

Under the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union (EU), certain well-established meat products, including some local prosciutto, are covered by a protected designation of origin (PDO) and other, less stringent designations of geographical origin for traditional specialties. Various regions have their own PDO, whose specifications do not generally require ham from free range pigs. The simple Italian description &quot;prosciutto&quot;, used alone or with &quot;crudo&quot; or &quot;cotto&quot;, is not in itself a protected term.

The two famous types of Italian &quot;prosciutto crudo&quot; are: &quot;prosciutto crudo di Parma&quot;, from Parma, and &quot;prosciutto crudo di San Daniele&quot;, from the San Daniele del Friuli area, in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region. &quot;Prosciutto di Parma&quot; has a slightly nutty flavour from the Parmesan whey that is sometimes added to the pigs&#x27; diet. &quot;Prosciutto di San Daniele&quot; is darker, and sweeter in flavour. For both of them, the product regulations allow salt as the only additive to the meat, prohibiting additives such as nitrite and nitrate that are often used in unprotected products.

European protected designation of origin (PDO) and protected geographical indication (PGI) apply for several prosciutto varieties in Italy, each slightly different in colour, flavour, and texture:
* &quot;, Parma, PDO 
* &quot;, San Daniele del Friuli, PDO 
* &quot;, Modena, PDO
* &quot;, Tuscany, PDO
* &quot;&quot; (or &quot;Prosciutto Veneto&quot;), Veneto, PDO
* &quot;, near Carpegna, Montefeltro, PDO
* &quot;, near Amatrice, Lazio, PGI
* &quot;, Norcia, PGI
* &quot;, Sauris, PGI
* &quot;Prosciutto crudo di Cuneo&quot;, Cuneo, PDO
* &quot;Valle d&#x27;Aosta Jambon de Bosses&quot;, Aosta Valley, PDO
* &quot;Prosciutto di suino nero dei Nebrodi&quot;, Sicily, PDO
* &quot;Cinta Senese&quot;, Tuscany, PDO
* &quot;Prosciutto di Bassiano&quot;, Lazio
* &quot;Prosciutto di Venticano&quot;, Campania
* &quot;Prosciutto di Faeto&quot;, Apulia
* &quot;Prosciutto della Majella&quot;, Abruzzo
* &quot;Prosciutto di suino nero Casertano&quot;, Campania
* &quot;Prosciutto crudo dell&#x27;Irpinia&quot;, Campania

===&quot;Culatello&quot;===

&quot;&quot; is similar to prosciutto, but is made from the filet or loin of the hind leg. It is aged in a cow or pig&#x27;s bladder as a casing to prevent spoilage and contamination. &quot;Culatello di Zibello&quot; possesses PDO status. It is commonly served as an appetizer (antipasto).

&quot;Strolghino&quot; is a salami prepared from leftover cuts of &quot;culatello&quot;.

===&quot;Pršut&quot;===
Prosciutto, locally called &quot;pršut&quot;, is produced in Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia (especially the Karst Plateau and the Vipava Valley), and Croatia (Dalmatia, the island of Krk, and Istria). &quot;Pršut&quot; from Dalmatia and Herzegovina are smoked, unlike the Italian product, while that from Slovenia, Istria, and Krk is not smoked. The mountain village of Njeguši, in Montenegro, produces the smoked &quot;njeguški pršut&quot;.

The following types of &quot;pršut&quot; have a protected status in the European Union and the UK:

<text>As a federal agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) receives its funding from the annual federal budget passed by the United States Congress. The following charts detail the amount of federal funding allotted to NASA each year over its history to pursue programs in aeronautics research, robotic spaceflight, technology development, and human space exploration programs.

== Annual budget ==
NASA&#x27;s budget for financial year (FY) 2020 is $22.6 billion. It represents 0.48% of the $4.7 trillion the United States plans to spend in the fiscal year.

Since its inception the United States has spent nearly US$650 billion (in nominal dollars) on NASA.

* U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) (needs proper citation-link, numbers here differ from NASA Pocket Statistics)
* Air Force Association&#x27;s Air Force Magazine 2007 Space Almanac
* 
==Cost of Apollo program==


NASA&#x27;s budget peaked in 1964–66 when it consumed roughly 4% of all federal spending. The agency was building up to the first Moon landing and the Apollo program was a top national priority, consuming more than half of NASA&#x27;s budget and driving NASA&#x27;s workforce to more than 34,000 employees and 375,000 contractors from industry and academia.

In 1973, NASA submitted congressional testimony reporting the total cost of Project Apollo as $25.4 billion (about $ in dollars).

==Economic impact of NASA funding==
A November 1971 study of NASA released by MRIGlobal (formerly Midwest Research Institute) of Kansas City, Missouri concluded that &quot;the $25 billion in 1958 dollars spent on civilian space R &amp; D during the 1958–1969 period has returned $52 billion through 1971 – and will continue to produce payoffs through 1987, at which time the total pay-off will have been $181 billion. The discounted rate of return for this investment will have been 33 percent.&quot;

Other statistics on NASA&#x27;s economic impact may be found in the 1976 Chase Econometrics Associates, Inc. reports and backed by the 1989 Chapman Research report, which examined 259 non-space applications of NASA technology during an eight-year period (1976–1984) and found more than:
* $21.6 billion in sales and benefits
* 352,000 (mostly skilled) jobs created or saved
* $355 million in federal corporate income taxes

According to a 1992 &quot;Nature&quot; commentary, these 259 applications represent &quot;. . .only 1% of an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 Space program spin-offs.&quot;&quot;

A 2013 report prepared by the Tauri Group for NASA showed that NASA invested nearly $5 billion in U.S. manufacturing in FY 2012, with nearly $2 billion of that going to the technology sector. NASA also develops and commercializes technology, some of which can generate over $1 billion in revenue per year over multiple years

In 2014, the American Helicopter Society criticized NASA and the government for reducing the annual rotorcraft budget from $50 million in 2000 to $23 million in 2013, impacting commercial opportunities.

The 2017 Economic Impact Report prepared by NASA for their Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) awards found that for FY 2016, these programs created 2,412 jobs, $474 million in economic output, and $57.3 million in fiscal impact with an initial investment of $172.9 million.

==Public perception==
The perceived national security threat posed by early Soviet leads in spaceflight drove NASA&#x27;s budget to its peak, both in real inflation-adjusted dollars and in a percentage of the total federal budget (4.41% in 1966). But the apparent U.S. victory in the Space Race — landing men on the Moon — erased the perceived threat, and NASA was unable to sustain political support for its vision of an even more ambitious Space Transportation System entailing reusable Earth-to-orbit shuttles, a permanent space station, lunar bases, and a human mission to Mars. Only a scaled-back space shuttle was approved, and NASA&#x27;s funding leveled off at just under 1% in 1976, then declined to 0.75% in 1986. After a brief increase to 1.01% in 1992, it declined to about 0.5% in 2013.

To help with public perception and to raise awareness regarding the widespread benefits of NASA-funded programs and technologies, NASA instituted the Spinoffs publication. This was a direct offshoot of the Technology Utilization Program Report, a &quot;publication dedicated to informing the scientific community about available NASA technologies, and ongoing requests received for supporting information.&quot; according to the NASA Spinoff about page the technologies in these reports created interest in the technology transfer concept, its successes, and its use as a public awareness tool. The reports generated such keen interest by the public that NASA decided to make them into an attractive publication. Thus, the first four-color edition of Spinoff was published in 1976.

The American public, on average, believes NASA&#x27;s budget has a much larger share of the federal budget than it actually does. A 1997 poll reported that Americans had an average estimate of 20% for NASA&#x27;s share of the federal budget, far higher than the actual 0.5% to under 1% that has been maintained throughout the late &#x27;90s and first decade of the 2000s. It is estimated that most Americans spent less than $9 on NASA through personal income tax in 2009.

However, there has been a recent movement to communicate discrepancy between perception and reality of NASA&#x27;s budget as well as lobbying to return the funding back to the 1970–1990 level. The United States Senate Science Committee met in March 2012 where astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson testified that &quot;Right now, NASA&#x27;s annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that—a penny on a dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th-century birthright to dream of tomorrow.&quot; Inspired by Tyson&#x27;s advocacy and remarks, the Penny4NASA campaign was initiated in 2012 by John Zeller and advocates the doubling of NASA&#x27;s budget to one percent of the Federal Budget, or one &quot;penny on the dollar.&quot;

In 2018, Business Insider surveyed approximately 1,000 US residents to determine what they believed was the annual NASA budget. The average respondent estimated that NASA&#x27;s budget was 6.4% of annual federal spending, when it was actually 0.5%. In a follow-up question, 85% of respondents stated that NASA funding should be increased, despite the majority of responses overestimating NASA&#x27;s actual budget.

NASA&#x27;s cost overruns and time delays have been blamed by some on NASA&#x27;s usage of cost-plus contracts and avoidance of fixed-price contracts.

===Political opposition to NASA funding===
Public opposition to NASA and its budget dates back to the Apollo era. Critics have cited more immediate concerns, like social welfare programs, as reasons to cut funding to the agency. Furthermore, they have questioned the return on investment (ROI) feasibility of NASA&#x27;s research and development. In 1968, physicist Ralph Lapp argued that if NASA really did have a positive ROI, it should be able to sustain itself as a private company, and not require federal funding. More recently, critics have faulted NASA for sinking money into the Space Shuttle program, reducing funding available for its long-term missions to Mars and deep space. Human missions to Mars have also been denounced for their inefficiency and large cost compared to uncrewed missions. In the 2010s, Republicans in Congress increasingly opposed the Earth science aspects of NASA spending, arguing that spending on Earth science programs such as climate research was in pursuit of political agendas.

<doc id="746240" wikidata="Q3593223" url="?curid=746240" title="Sauvie Island">
<text>Sauvie Island is in the U.S. state of Oregon, originally named as Wapato Island or Wappatoo Island. It is the largest island along the Columbia River, at , and one of the largest river islands in the United States. It lies approximately northwest of downtown Portland, between the Columbia River to the east, the Multnomah Channel to the west, and the Willamette River to the south. A large portion of the island is designated as the Sauvie Island Wildlife Area. Sturgeon Lake, in the north central part of the island, is the most prominent water feature. The land area is , or . Most of the island is in Multnomah County, but the northern third is in Columbia County. The Wapato Bridge provides access across the Multnomah Channel from U.S. Route 30 and was completed in June 2008, replacing the first bridge to connect the island to the mainland which was opened on December 30, 1950.

The island received the name &quot;Sauvés Island&quot; after Laurent Sauvé dit Laplante, a French-Canadian who managed a dairy for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in the 1830s and 1840s. It is predominantly farmland and wildlife refuge and is a popular place for picking pumpkins, hunting geese and kayaking. There were 1,078 year-round residents at the 2000 census. There is an industrial zone and small grocery store in the southeast corner, near the bridge. Bicyclists flock to the island because its flat topography and lengthy low-volume roads make it ideal for cycling. Its nearest incorporated neighbors are the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area to its south and southeast; St. Helens across the Multnomah Channel from the extreme northern tip of the island; and Scappoose, across the Multnomah Channel to the west.

==History==

Prior to European arrival in the 19th century, Sauvie Island was the ancestral home to the Multnomah band of the Chinook Tribe. There were approximately 15 villages on the island, hosting a total of 2,000 people who built and resided in cedar plank-houses long by wide.

*1792 – British Lieutenant William Broughton in George Vancouver&#x27;s expedition explores the island and names the northern tip &quot;Warrior Point&quot; after being greeted offshore by 23 canoes of armed Multnomah.
*October 29 – Mount Hood was named on October 29, 1792, as Lt. Broughton observed its peak from Belle Vue Point at the southern tip of Sauvie Island during his travels up the Columbia River, writing: &quot;A very high, snowy mountain now appeared rising beautifully conspicuous in the midst of an extensive tract of low or moderately elevated land (location of today&#x27;s Vancouver, Washington) lying S 67 E., and seemed to announce a termination to the river.&quot; Lt. Broughton named the mountain after British admiral Samuel Hood.
*November 4, 1805 – The Lewis and Clark expedition lands, names it &quot;Wapato Island&quot; after the abundance of Broadleaf arrowhead plants, which are also known as &quot;Indian potato&quot; and were a major foodstuff for indigenous peoples in the Pacific Northwest.
*During the next decades the natives weather outbreaks of smallpox, syphilis, measles and tuberculosis.
*1829 - A horrifying epidemic of a fever known as the ague (malaria) sweeps across the land.
*1832 - So much of the native population has died in the epidemic, they are nearly extinct; Dr. McLoughlin of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company removes survivors and burns settlements.
*1834 – American Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth builds and occupies Fort William, a small trading post, to compete with the British; abandoned 1836.
* – Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company establishes dairies on the island, managed by French-Canadian employee Laurent Sauvé (after whom the island is now named).
*1843 – The opening of the Oregon Trail makes it possible for American settlers to come to the island from the Midwest.
*1851 – Mouth of Willamette post office is established; renamed &quot;Souvies Island&quot; the following year.
*1858 – James Francis Bybee builds Bybee–Howell House. The structure was added to the NRHP in 1974, and is part of Howell Territorial Park.

*1889 – Warrior Rock Lighthouse established at Warrior Point.
*1920s – during prohibition, cargo ships from Canada would offload liquor to motorboats in international waters off the Columbia River. The motorboats ran back up the river to Sauvie Island, meeting bootleggers there.
*1930s – The Army Corps of Engineers builds flood-control dikes.
*1940s – Sauvie Island Wildlife Area acquired by the state of Oregon.
*November 29, 1943 – Sauvie Island Conservation District is formed by unanimous vote.
*December 30, 1950 – Sauvie Island Bridge opens; Sauvie Island Ferry, the last ferry in the Portland metropolitan area, closes.
*2006 – Multnomah County begins construction of new Sauvie Island Bridge.
*2008 – New Sauvie Island Bridge opens with a parade and a performance by the Oregon Crusaders Drum and Bugle Corps.
*2022 – Multnomah County Board of Commissioners rename Sauvie Island Bridge to Wapato Bridge.

==Recreational beaches==
Not all of the island&#x27;s beaches have public beach access. The public beaches on Sauvie Island are Walton Beach, North Unit Beach, and the clothing-optional Collins Beach on the island&#x27;s east coast along NW Reeder Road&#x27;s last few miles past the end of the pavement. The beaches are open from dawn to 10:00 p.m., and are closed to overnight use and camping. Open fires are not allowed. Dogs are allowed if they are leashed. This section of the beach is often a party-like environment on warm and sunny days, leading to an alcohol ban in effect from May 1 to September 30 that began in 2018. Beach parking requires a Sauvie Island Wildlife Area parking permit available at stores on the island. Vehicles without a permit are subject to a ticket costing around $75.

== Farms ==
Sauvie Island is home to dozens of private farms, from nurseries and gardens, to about a dozen fruit and vegetable farms open for public U-picking. Crops include strawberries, raspberries, marionberries, blackberries, blueberries, peaches, pears, sweet corn, cherries, broccoli, lettuce, cauliflower, zucchini, tomatoes, green beans, cucumbers, pumpkins, herbs, and others. Along with crops these farms also include activities such as hay rides, cow trains, pumpkin patches and mazes.

<doc id="746248" wikidata="Q7644162" url="?curid=746248" title="Supersonic Low Altitude Missile">
<text>The Supersonic Low Altitude Missile or SLAM was a U.S. Air Force nuclear weapons project conceived around 1955, and cancelled in 1964. SLAMs were conceived of as unmanned nuclear-powered ramjets capable of delivering thermonuclear warheads deep into enemy territory. The development of ICBMs in the 1950s rendered the concept of SLAMs obsolete. Advances in defensive ground radar also made the stratagem of low-altitude evasion ineffective. Although it never proceeded beyond the initial design and testing phase before being declared obsolete, the design contained several radical innovations as a nuclear delivery system.

==Conceived role==

The SLAM was designed to complement the doctrine of mutually assured destruction and as a possible replacement for, or augment to, the Strategic Air Command system. In the event of nuclear war it was intended to fly below the cover of enemy radar at supersonic speeds and deliver thermonuclear warheads to roughly 16 targets.

===Innovations===
The use of a nuclear engine in the airframe promised to give the missile staggering and unprecedented low-altitude range, estimated to be roughly (over 4.5 times the equatorial circumference of the Earth). Despite misinformed public opinion, the idea that the engine could act as a secondary weapon for the missile is not practical. According to Dr. Theodore C. Merkle, the head of Project Pluto, in both his testimony to Congress and in a publication regarding the nuclear ramjet propulsion system, he reassures both Congress and the public of this fact. Specifically, he states &quot;The reactor radiations, while intense, do not lead to problems with personnel who happen to be under such a power plant passing overhead at flight speed even for very low altitudes.&quot; In both documents, he describes calculations that prove the safety of the reactor and its negligible release of fission products compared to the background. Along the same vein of these calculations, the missile would be moving too quickly to expose any living things to prolonged radiation needed to induce radiation sickness. This is due to the relatively low population of neutrons that would make it to the ground per kilometer, for a vehicle traveling at several hundred meters per second. Any radioactive fuel elements within the reactor itself would be contained and not stripped by the air to reach the ground.

Another revolutionary aspect of the SLAM was its reliance on automation. It would have the mission of a long-range bomber, but would be completely unmanned: accepting radioed commands up to its failsafe point, whereafter it would rely on a terrain contour matching (TERCOM) radar system to navigate to preprogrammed targets.

==Development==
The primary innovation was the engine of the aircraft, which was developed under the aegis of a separate project code-named Project Pluto, after the Greek god of the underworld. It was a ramjet that used nuclear fission to superheat incoming air instead of chemical fuel. Project Pluto produced two working prototypes of this engine, the Tory-IIA and the Tory-IIC, which were successfully tested in the Nevada desert. Special ceramics had to be developed to meet the stringent weight and tremendous heat tolerances demanded of the SLAM&#x27;s reactor. These were developed by the Coors Porcelain Company. The reactor itself was designed at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory.

Although a prototype of the airframe was never constructed, the SLAM was to be a wingless, fin-guided aircraft; its appearance giving it the nickname &quot;Flying Crowbar&quot;. Apart from the ventral ram-air intake it was very much in keeping with traditional missile design. Its estimated airspeed at was Mach 4.2.

The SLAM program was scrapped on July 1, 1964. By this time serious questions about its viability had been raised, such as how to test a device that would emit copious amounts of radioactive exhaust from its unshielded reactor core in flight, as well as its efficacy and cost. ICBMs promised swifter delivery to targets, and because of their speed (the Thor could reach its target in 18 minutes, whereas the SLAM would take much longer) and trajectory, were considered virtually unstoppable. The SLAM was also being outpaced by advances in defensive ground radar, which threatened to render its stratagem of low-altitude evasion ineffective.

===Reactor design===
The reactor had an outer diameter of and length ; the dimensions of the reactor core were diameter and length. The critical mass of uranium was 59.90 kg, and the reactor&#x27;s power density averaged at 10 megawatts per cubic foot (350 MW/m3), with total power of 600 megawatts.

The nuclear fuel elements were made of refractory ceramic based on beryllium oxide, with enriched uranium dioxide as fuel and small amount of zirconium dioxide for structural stability. The fuel elements were hollow hexagonal tubes about long with distance between the outer parallel planes, with inside diameter of . They were manufactured by high-pressure extruding of the green compact, then sintering almost to its theoretical density. The core consisted of 465,000 individual elements stacked to form 27,000 airflow channels; the design with small unattached elements reduced problems related with thermal stresses. The elements were designed for average operation temperature of ; the autoignition temperature of the reactor base plates was only 150 °C higher. The neutron flux was calculated to be 9×1017 neutrons/(cm2·s) in the aft and 7×1014 neutrons/(cm2·s) in the nose. The gamma radiation level was fairly high due to the lack of shielding; radiation hardening for the guidance electronics had to be designed.

The reactors were successfully tested at Jackass Flats in the Nevada Test Site. The Tory II-A reactor, the scaled-down variant, was tested in mid-1961 and successfully ran for several seconds on May 14, 1961. A full-scale variant, the Tory II-C, was run for almost 5 minutes at full power. The latter test, limited by the air storage facility capacity, ran for 292 seconds. The air fed to the reactor was preheated to and compressed to , to simulate ramjet flight conditions.

<doc id="746252" wikidata="Q17053888" url="?curid=746252" title="Johanan (name)">
<text>Yohanan (&#x27;), sometimes transcribed asJohanan, is a [[Hebrew]] male [[given name]] that can also appear in the longer form of (&#x27;), meaning &quot;YHWH is gracious&quot;.

The name is ancient, recorded as the name of Johanan, high priest of the Second Temple around 400 BCE.

== Adaptations ==

The Hebrew name was adopted as (&quot;Iōánnēs&quot;) in Biblical Greek as the name of both John the Baptist and John the Apostle.

In the Latin Vulgate this was originally adopted as &quot;Iohannes&quot; (or &quot;Johannes&quot; – in Latin, &quot;J&quot; is the same letter as &quot;I&quot;).
The presence of an &quot;h&quot;, not found in the Greek adaptation, shows awareness of the Hebrew origin. Later editions of the Vulgate, such as the Clementine Vulgate, have &quot;Ioannes&quot;, however.

The anglicized form &quot;John&quot; makes its appearance in Middle English, from the mid-12th century, as a direct adaptation from Medieval Latin &quot;Johannes&quot;,
the Old French being &quot;Jean&quot;.
The feminine form &quot;Joanna&quot; is also biblical, recorded in the form as the name of
Joanna, wife of Chuza.

The form &quot;Johanan&quot;, even closer to the Hebrew original than Latin &quot;Johannes&quot;, is customarily used in English-language translations of the Hebrew Bible (as opposed to &quot;John&quot; being used in English translations of the New Testament), in a tradition going back to Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible, which uses &quot;John&quot; when translating from the Greek (e.g. of John the Baptist in Mark 1:4), but &quot;Johannan&quot; when translating from the Hebrew (as in Jeremiah 40:8).

<text>Alfred Ely Beach (September 1, 1826 – January 1, 1896) was an American inventor, entrepreneur, publisher, and patent lawyer, born in Springfield, Massachusetts. He is known for his design of the earliest predecessor to the New York City Subway, the Beach Pneumatic Transit, which became the first subway in America. He was an early owner and cofounder of &quot;Scientific American&quot; and Munn &amp; Co., the country&#x27;s leading patent agency, and helped secure patents for Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and other innovators. A member of the Union League of New York, he also invented a typewriter for the blind and a system for heating water with solar power.

==Early years==
Beach was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, and was the son of a prominent publisher, Moses Yale Beach, owner of the New York &quot;Sun&quot; and member of the Yale family. His brother William Yale Beach was a banker while his other brother, Moses S. Beach, took over the family newspaper and supported the policies of Abraham Lincoln during his ownership. Alfred&#x27;s brother was also later a trustee and shareholder in his Broadway Underground Railway Company, along with his son Frederick C. Beach, and his nephew Charles Yale Beach.

Charles Yale&#x27;s brothers-in-law were Commodore Holland Newton Stevenson, and John McAllister Stevenson, a Yale graduate and board director of the Pittsfield Electric Street Railway Company in 1892, which operated electric trolley cars, replacing horsecars. His three nephews and his great-grandnephew, Rev. Brewster Yale Beach, all attended Yale University.

Alfred worked for his father at the &quot;Sun&quot; until he and a friend, Orson Desaix Munn, decided to buy &quot;Scientific American&quot;, a relatively new publication, becoming the early founders of that company. He also brought in the venture Salem Howe Wales, President of the New York City Department of Docks and co-founder of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Beach was the editor and publisher of &quot;Scientific American&quot; for fifty years, and they ran the magazine until their deaths decades later, and it was carried on by their sons and grandsons for decades more.

&quot;Scientific American&quot; is now the oldest continuously published magazine in the United States, and has featured prominent scientists over time such as Albert Einstein, Nikola Tesla, Marie Curie, and Thomas Edison. They reported the invention and patent of Abraham Lincoln relating to his device that intended to help boats navigate shallows.

==Munn &amp; Co.==

In 1846, Munn and Beach established a prominent patent agency within &quot;Scientific American&quot; named Munn &amp; Co., in synergy with the scientists featured in the magazine who wanted to patent their inventions. They provided the service for the patent applications and tracked the progress once it reached the U.S. Patent Office, having their headquarters next door in Washington.

As a boy, Thomas Edison used to walk a few miles every week to get his copy of the magazine, and later on in his career, he walked in Beach&#x27;s office one day and showed him a device he called the phonograph, being the first to see his invention. Beach tested the device with Edison, liked it, and helped him file the patent. Edison would become a frequent visitor of Beach.

He also helped Alexander Graham Bell, Samuel F. B. Morse, Elias Howe, R. J. Gatling, Capt. John Ericsson, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Col. John Jacob Astor IV, and thousands of other inventors. The magazine&#x27;s patent department eventually filed about three thousand patents a year, forcing Beach to split his time between New York and Washington, defending the patents of the inventors in court.

Beach patented some of his own inventions, notably an early typewriter designed for use by the blind, an engineering first for the Americas. He received the gold medal by the American Institute at the New York Crystal Palace for the Great Exhibition of 1853, and his invention served as the prototype for typewriters over the next century. He invented a cable traction railway system, and designed and built one of the world&#x27;s first tunnelling shields in the same year as famed engineer James Henry Greathead.

His patent agency eventually brought him fame and fortune, and his magazine helped stimulate 19th-century technological innovations and became one of the most prestigious scientific magazines of its time. During its peak years, Munn &amp; Co., as the patent agency of &quot;Scientific American&quot;, prosecuted about one third of all the patents issued by the US Patent Office. By 1924, they had filled more than 200,000 patents, representing about 15% of all the patents filled in the United States, and was partly responsible for the rapid growth of the US patent system. After opening an office in Washington, they opened new offices across the globe and became recognized as the most successful patent law firm in the world.

==Invention of a subway==

Beach&#x27;s most famous invention was New York City&#x27;s first subway, the Beach Pneumatic Transit. He received his first charter by the legislature in 1868, four years before Commodore Vanderbilt&#x27;s attempt to build a subway in New York. Beach created his own enterprise using pneumatic tube technology, naming it the Beach Pneumatic Transit Company, and made himself its President. This idea came about during the late 1860s, when traffic in New York was very difficult, especially along its central artery of Broadway, crowded with pedestrians and horse carriages. Beach was one of a few visionaries who proposed building an underground railway under Broadway to help relieve the traffic congestion. The inspiration was the underground Metropolitan Railway in London, but in contrast to that and others&#x27; proposals for New York, Beach proposed the use of trains propelled by pneumatics instead of conventional steam engines, and construction using a tunnelling shield of his invention to minimize disturbing the street.

Beach used a circular design based upon Marc Isambard Brunel&#x27;s rectangular shield, which may represent the shift in design from rectangular to cylindrical. It was unclear when or who transitioned tunneling shield design from rectangular to circular until &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote an article describing the original Beach tunneling shield in 1870.


Beach was also interested in pneumatic tubes for the transport of letters and packages, another idea recently put into use in London by the London Pneumatic Despatch Company. He refused to bribe corrupt politician &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed to have his proposal approved. Instead, he built the tunnel in secret during the night, carting away the dirt under the cover of darkness, with the city officials at City Hall just across the street. He put up $350,000 of his own money to bankroll the project, allowing him to bypass the corruption and extortion schemes of Tammany Hall, which included the Governor, the Mayor, the City comptroller, and countless of other corrupted officials. His thinking was that once the public saw the completed subway, the politicians would not dare to stop him. With a franchise from the state, he began construction of a tunnel for small pneumatic tubes in 1869, but diverted it into a demonstration of a passenger railway that opened on February 26, 1870. It is most interesting to note that Beach&#x27;s tunnel design was likely the first cylindrical tunnel design ever used in the Americas and built using a design inspired by James Henry Greathead&#x27;s successful shield patents in London for construction of the Tower Subway project. Greathead invented and built his own design of a shield as the contractor for that project, under Peter W. Barlow who was the engineer. Since Beach was a patents lawyer, it is likely he discovered the 1869 Greathead patent and the patent application by Barlow from 1864, using an imitated Barlow&#x27;s patent design for engineering the PTS tunnel design.

To build a passenger railway he needed a different franchise, something he lobbied for over four legislative sessions, 1870 to 1873. Construction of the tunnel was obvious from materials being delivered to Warren Street near Broadway, and was documented in newspaper reports, but Beach kept all details secret until the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; published a possibly planted article a few weeks before opening. The Mayor of New York, Abraham Oakey Hall, grew suspicious and sent an aide over to the construction site with a written order to inspect Beach&#x27;s work, but his workers blocked the inspectors.

When it was finished, after 58 successive nights, it became New York City&#x27;s first underground subway. Beach hosted a gala on February 26, 1870, to which he invited city and state officials, enraging &quot;Boss Tweed&quot; for not having profited from the venture, and for challenging his monopoly on streetcars. In less than a year, Beach&#x27;s underground system was used by 400,000 people, and he requested his line to extend to Central Park, with an injection of 5 million dollars in capital, hoping to get financiers such as John Jacob Astor III in the venture.

===Downfall===

In 1870 New York state Senator William M. Tweed introduced a bill to fund the full construction of Beach&#x27;s subway but the bill did not pass. By the end of 1871 Tweed&#x27;s Tammany Hall political machine was in disgrace and from then on Beach, in an effort to gain support from reformers, claimed that Tweed had opposed his subway. The real opposition to the subway was from politically connected property owners along Broadway, led by Alexander Turney Stewart and John Jacob Astor III, who feared that tunnelling would damage buildings and interfere with surface traffic. Bills for Beach&#x27;s subway passed the legislature in 1871 and 1872 but were vetoed by Governor John T. Hoffman because he said that they gave away too much authority without compensation to the city or state. In 1873 Governor John Adams Dix signed a similar bill into law, but Beach was not able to raise funds to build over the next six months, and then the Panic of 1873 dried up the financial markets.

During this same time, other investors had built an elevated railway at Greenwich Street and Ninth Avenue, which operated successfully with a small steam engine starting in 1870. This elevated railway gave an idea to James Henry Greathead for the Docker&#x27;s Umbrella in Liverpool, which was a similar idea for an overhead railway for the purpose of easing congestion on the ground in England. The wealthy property owners did not object to the New York City railway well away from Broadway, and by the mid-1870s it appeared that elevated railways were practical and underground railways were not, setting the pattern for rapid transit development in New York City for the remainder of the 19th century.

Beach operated his demonstration railway from February 1870 to April 1873. It had one station in the basement of Devlin&#x27;s clothing store, a building at the southwest corner of Broadway and Warren Street. The Woolworth Building would be built next door, with an underground entrance connecting to the subway station, but it was later closed down because of fear of criminal activities.

It ran for a total of about 300 feet, first around a curve to the center of Broadway and then straight under the center of Broadway to the south side of Murray Street. Beach spent $70,000 of his own savings to make the station luxurious and comfortable, with chandeliers, mirrors, a towering grandfather clock, a fountain with fish, paintings and a piano. The former Devlin&#x27;s building was destroyed by fire in 1898. When the subway tunnel closed down, Beach rented out the space as a wine cellar, and later as a shooting range and a storage vault.

The profits made by Beach from the subway were given to charities, promising to donate all the money raised to the United Home for the Orphans of Soldiers and Sailors. He later also developed a pneumatic tube systems for New York&#x27;s mail, building the first mail tube in the country.

In 1912 workers for Degnon Contracting excavated the tunnel proper during the construction of a subway line running under Broadway, discovering the old tunnel and the old station that was buried underground. They also discovered Beach&#x27;s old tunnelling shield and remains of Gotham&#x27;s original subway car. The new tunnel was completely within the limits of the present day City Hall station under Broadway, near the old City Hall station. The British pneumatic tube also failed to attract much attention and eventually fell into disrepair and disrepute in spite of the fact that Royal Mail had contracted to use the tunnels. Ultimately the English experiment failed due to technical issues as well as lack of funds.

==Death and legacy==

Much of the Beach subway story was recalled as precedent by Lawrence Edwards in his lead article of the August 1965 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot;, which described his invention of Gravity-Vacuum Transit. Beach&#x27;s story is also featured in &quot;&quot;.

The Beach Tunnelling shield, similar to the 1864 English patent idea of Barlow&#x27;s, was used in the construction of the Grand Trunk Railway, headquartered in Montreal, Canada&#x27;s first St. Clair Tunnel between Port Huron, Michigan and Sarnia, Ontario. This tunnel opened in 1890. His hydraulic shield system was also used in the excavating of the underground railway tunnels in London and Glasgow, the North River Tunnels and other construction works.

Beach&#x27;s pneumatic system was the first air-powered train in America, a concept that would be proposed once again about 150 years later by billionaire Elon Musk, rebranded as the Hyperloop. The team Hyperloop II of the Hyperloop pod competition sponsored by SpaceX also used Beach&#x27;s pneumatic concept and made the pneumatic vehicle more efficient.

In January 1887, Beach allowed his son and six other men to start a yacht club on his property in Stratford, Connecticut. The Housatonic boat club is the oldest operating yacht club in Connecticut, and the land purchased for the club came from his estate in 1954.

After the Civil War, Beach founded a school for freed slaves in Savannah, Georgia, the Beach Institute, which is now the home of the King-Tisdell Cottage Foundation. It was the first school in Savannah erected specifically for the education of African Americans, and was built by Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, at the initiation of President Lincoln, and was managed by the American Missionary Association. Alumni include Mayor Otis Johnson and Senator Regina Thomas.

Beach was also a member of the Union League Club of New York, an abolitionist society that supported the policies of Abraham Lincoln. Pneumatic tubes are still used today by banks and the CIA for their headquarters, and less than a decade after Beach&#x27;s death, New York City built its first subway system in 1904, and have him featured in the history of the New York City Subway.

Beach later was the subject of the 1976 Klaatu single &quot;Sub-Rosa Subway.&quot;

He died of pneumonia on January 1, 1896, in New York City at the age of 69.

He had a son named Frederick Converse Beach, who invented a photolithographic process and ran &quot;Scientific American&quot;, and a grandson named Stanley Yale Beach, who worked for the magazine as well but also became an aviation pioneer, and an early financier of Gustave Whitehead, the contested first maker of a powered controlled flight before the Wright brothers.

Both were Yale graduates, having graduated from Yale&#x27;s Sheffield Scientific School.

<doc id="746260" wikidata="Q1188338" url="?curid=746260" title="Mappy">
<text>is an arcade game by Namco, originally released in 1983 and distributed in the United States by Bally Midway. Running on the Namco&#x27;s &quot;Super Pac-Man&quot; hardware modified to support horizontal scrolling, the game features a mouse protagonist and cat antagonists, similar to Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoon series. The name &quot;Mappy&quot; is likely derived from , a slightly pejorative Japanese slang term for policeman. The game has been re-released in several Namco arcade compilations. It spawned a handful of sequels and a 2013 animated web series developed by cartoonists Scott Kurtz and Kris Straub.

==Gameplay==

The player guides Mappy the police mouse through the mansion of the cats called Meowkies (Mewkies in Japan) to retrieve stolen goods, such as the Mona Lisa or a TV. The player uses a left-right joystick to move Mappy and a single button to operate doors. The mansion has six floors of hallways (four or five in some other versions) in which the stolen items are stashed. Mappy and the cats move between floors by bouncing on trampolines at various places in the house. Both Mappy and the cats can land on a floor on the way up, but not on the way down. When Mappy passes cats in the air, he is unharmed, but if he touches a cat elsewhere, he will lose a life. The trampolines break when Mappy bounces on them four times in a row, with the trampolines changing color depending on how many times Mappy has used them without a rest. If a trampoline breaks, Mappy will lose a life unless there is another trampoline below the broken one. In addition to the Meowkies, the boss cat Goro (Nyamco in Japanese) also roams around. He is faster but less aggressive than the Meowkies. Throughout the levels, Goro hides behind the different recoverable items. If Mappy recovers an item which Goro is hiding behind, the player receives 1000 points in addition to the score for the item. Items come in pairs; retrieving the second item in a pair immediately after the first multiplies the point value of the second item (x2, up to x6).

Doors only open towards their doorknobs. Hitting a cat with a door scores 50 points and stuns the cat. Meowkies and Goro can open doors but will get stunned unless the door opens away from them (doorknobs away), and they can walk through opened doors. They cannot open blue doors. Blue doors, when opened, blast a slow moving microwave in the direction of the doorknob that will trap any cats it touches and remove them from the board when the wave reaches the edge of the screen. The more cats caught, the more points gained. If Goro is trapped by a wave, the score is doubled. Cats removed in this way return shortly from above.

A round is completed when all the loot is retrieved. If the player takes longer than usual to clear a round, a &quot;Hurry&quot; message appears after which the music speeds up and the cats move quickly and aggressively, and more Meowkies are added (two will appear ready to drop as the Meowkies normally do immediately following the &quot;Hurry&quot; message, and more Meowkies can arrive later on). If the player takes much longer after this, a green disc with Goro&#x27;s face on it named the &quot;Gosenzo Coin&quot; will drop onto the top-middle platform and chase Mappy more effectively than the Meowkies as it can kill him while jumping. The Gosenzo can open doors and cannot be stopped by microwave doors or any objects.

The third round and every fourth round after is a bonus round. Mappy, unbothered by the cats, must bounce across a series of trampolines, popping fifteen different suspended red balloons (200 pts), with a &quot;Goro&quot; (2000 points) along the way. A bonus (5000 pts) is awarded if all the balloons are popped before the music ends. After every bonus round, a new feature is added to the gameplay, such as bells that freeze cats. The &quot;Hurry&quot; message will also appear sooner.

==Reception==

In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Mappy&quot; in its June 1, 1983 issue as the third most-successful table arcade unit of the month. It also topped the &quot;Game Machine&quot; chart for new table arcade cabinets in June 1983. In 2015, &quot;Hardcore Gamer&quot; included &quot;Mappy&quot; on its 200 Best Video Games of All Time.

==Legacy==
As part of Bandai Namco&#x27;s ShiftyLook initiative, an animated &quot;Mappy&quot; web series, titled &quot;Mappy: The Beat&quot; was made. The series was written and directed by Scott Kurtz and Kris Straub, who also performed all of the character voices, and was designed with limited animation in the style of Kurtz and Straub&#x27;s &quot;Blamimations&quot; series. The story follows Mappy, now working a thankless job as a security guard for his former foe Goro&#x27;s company Nyamco. He is accompanied by his friends and fellow Nyamco employees, the laid-back digging-obsessed &quot;Dig Dug&quot; and the dim but good-natured &quot;Sky Kid&quot;, along with other Bandai Namco characters working at the office. &quot;Mappy: The Beat&quot; premiered on ShiftyLook&#x27;s YouTube channel on July 22, 2013, and ran for 13 episodes, each roughly eight minutes in length, with the final episode released on January 20, 2014. Kurtz also made a guest appearance as Mappy on the concurrent &quot;Bravoman&quot; animated series, with Bravoman in turn appearing in the final story arc of &quot;Mappy&quot;, portrayed by guest voice Dax Gordine. Following the closure of ShiftyLook, their channel was removed from YouTube, making the episodes no longer officially available.

A costume based on &quot;Mappy&quot; is in &quot;LittleBigPlanet 3&quot; in the Namco Classics DLC. 

A medley of tracks from &quot;Mappy&quot; is in the Pac-Land stage in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; and in one of Pac-Man&#x27;s taunts.

A theme based on &quot;Mappy&quot;, featuring the game&#x27;s characters, were available as downloadable content in &quot;Pac-Man 99&quot; during the game&#x27;s lifetime.

==Production==

==Reception==

=== Box office ===
According to MGM records, the film made a profit of $89,000.

=== Critical ===
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;Devotees of Terry-Thomas or Eric Sykes may find something to go for in this slapstick farce, and the physiotherapy equipment and the Pekinese also have their moments. Otherwise, however, there is little to distinguish its undemanding humour from that of a multitude of other minor British comedies.&quot;

British film critic Leslie Halliwell said: &quot;Flatfooted and unprofessional murder farce whose only pace is slow.&quot;

&quot;The Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; gave the film 1/5 stars, writing: &quot;This is the kind of comedy that could have killed off the British film industry, despite its domestic star-power and the usually reliable writing team of David Pursall and Jack Seddon. When bumbling private detective Terry-Thomas tries to investigate a murder at a posh spa, the only interest is in seeing him lock comedy horns with Eric Sykes and Lionel Jeffries. Unfortunately, it is to little effect.&quot;

<doc id="746312" wikidata="Q3837709" url="?curid=746312" title="Love. It comes in all colors">
<text>Love. It comes in all colors was an American television and print public service ad filmed in the space of one hour on Sunday afternoon, December 7, 1969, and broadcast on American TV stations during 1970. Sponsored by the National Urban Coalition, it was part of an advertising campaign to promote racial harmony and featured political activists as well as celebrities from sports, show business, government and business.

==Background==
Produced by the advertising agency Ketchum, MacLeod &amp; Grove and filmed at Manhattan&#x27;s MPO Studios, the one-minute commercial showed an assembled group singing several repetitions for chorus to &quot;Let The Sun Shine In&quot; from &quot;Hair&quot;. The refrain speeds up as does the editing, trying to give everyone equal time and ends with applause by everyone. The words &quot;Love. It comes in all colors.&quot; are then superimposed upon the screen. It was broadcast as a public service advertisement during shows such as the March 8, 1970 episode of &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; (Ed Sullivan having been one of the participants).

The performance was staged by film director Joshua Logan and musical director Mitch Miller.

Amiri Baraka, one of the 117 invitees who came for the filming, was present in the studio during the production, but refused to appear on-camera. Among the numerous notables who were sent an invitation to the filming, 28 made known their willingness to participate, but did not arrive. These included Muhammad Ali, Julian Bond, Dick Gregory, John Lindsay and Sidney Poitier.

The youngest participant was 21-year-old Miss America 1970 Pamela Anne Eldred (although some members of the cast of the musical &quot;Hair&quot;, whose birth years remain unlisted, may have been younger) and the oldest were 75-year old trade unionist Jacob Potofsky and 74-year-old boxing champion Jack Dempsey, the only participants born in the 19th century. Five of the participants died within a five-year period following the filming: Whitney Young (March 1971), Ralph Bunche (December 1971), Dan Blocker (May 1972), Roberto Clemente (December 1972) and Chet Huntley (March 1974).

<doc id="746332" wikidata="Q3303369" url="?curid=746332" title="Lion House (Salt Lake City)">
<text>The Lion House is a large residence built in 1856 by Brigham Young, second president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Used for a variety of purposes following the death of Young, the building was closed in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and has remained closed for renovation and restoration, with an expected reopening in 2025. It is expected that its former restaurant, &quot;The Lion House Pantry&quot;, will be replaced by museum space as part of the restoration project.

==History==
Truman Osborn Angell, Young&#x27;s brother-in-law, by his first wife Mary Ann Angell, and designer of the Salt Lake Temple, was also involved in the design of this home. The house got its name from the statue of a lion, sculpted by the craftsman William Ward III, above the front entrance. &quot;Lion of the Lord&quot; was a nickname of Young. The design is a Gothic Revival mansion with 20 gables for 20 small bedrooms.
The house is situated at 63 East South Temple, near the corner of South Temple and State Street, just one block east of Temple Square. It is adjacent to Young&#x27;s other official residence, the Beehive House, to which it is connected by a series of rooms used as offices.

A polygamist, Young ultimately fathered 57 children by more than two dozen wives, and also had many adopted, foster, and stepchildren. He owned residences throughout Salt Lake City and Utah Territory, but many of his wives and children were housed in the Lion House. The house contains large public rooms on the ground floor with bedrooms on the upper floors and was home to as many as 12 of Young&#x27;s wives, including Eliza R. Snow.

In 1870, the Young Ladies’ Department of the Ladies’ Cooperative Retrenchment Association was founded in the Lion House—now called Young Women. In the 1920s, the Lion House housed the domestic science department of LDS University. In the 1930s, it was operated by the Young Women Mutual Improvement Association of the LDS Church as a social center for study and also for renting of rooms for social events. In 2020, the Lion House and other historic sites on Temple Square were closed to the public due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Current use==
The bottom floor of the Lion House is a functional, cafeteria-style restaurant called &quot;The Lion House Pantry,&quot; which is currently closed for renovation. It is located adjacent to the LDS Church&#x27;s main headquarters and heavily visited Temple Square. The Lion House is also known for the &quot;Original Lion House Rolls&quot; and signature recipe created by Head Baker Bill Ellis in 1977. The Lion House retail &#x27;brand&#x27; includes rolls, brownie and raspberry muffin baking mixes sold nationally through commercial partner Lehi Roller Mills. The building&#x27;s restaurant is expected to be replaced by museum space during the 2020s restoration.

<doc id="746333" wikidata="Q2642049" url="?curid=746333" title="Yona">
<text>The word Yona in Pali and the Prakrits, and the analogue Yavana in Sanskrit, were used in Ancient India to designate Greek speakers. &quot;Yona&quot; and &quot;Yavana&quot; are transliterations of the Greek word for &quot;Ionians&quot; (), who were probably the first Greeks to be known in India.

Both terms appear in ancient Sanskrit literature. &quot;Yavana&quot; appears, for instance, in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, while &quot;Yona&quot; appears in texts such as the Sri Lankan chronicle &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;.

The Yona are mentioned in the Ashoka inscriptions, along with the Kambojas, as two societies where there are only nobles and slaves.

Examples of direct association of these terms with the Greeks include:
* The mention of the &quot;Yauna&quot; in the Persepolis Administrative Archives (550–333 BC).
* The mention of the &quot;Yona king Aṃtiyoka&quot; in the Edicts of Ashoka (280 BCE)
* The mention of the &quot;Yona king Aṃtalikitasa&quot; in the Heliodorus pillar in Vidisha (110 BCE)
* King Milinda and his bodyguard of &quot;500 Yonas&quot; in the Milinda Panha.
* The description of Greek astrology and Greek terminology in the &quot;Yavanajātaka&quot; &quot;Nativity of the Yavanas&quot; (150 CE).
* The mention of Alexandria on the Caucasus, &quot;the city of the Yonas&quot; in the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, Chapter 29 (4th century CE).

In general, the words &quot;Yoṇa&quot; or &quot;Yoṇaka&quot; were the current Greek Hellenistic forms, while the term &quot;Yavana&quot; was the Indian word to designate the Greeks or the Indo-Greeks.

== Comparable terms in the ancient world ==
This usage was shared by many of the countries east of Greece, from the Mediterranean to Sindh:
* Egyptians used the word &quot;ywnj-ꜥꜣ&quot;.
* In Arabic it is &quot;Yūnān&quot;.
* Assyrians used the word &quot;Iawanu&quot;.
* Babylonians used the word &quot;Yaman&quot; and &quot;Yamanaya&quot;.
* In Biblical Hebrew, the word was יוון &quot;Yāwān&quot; (Modern Hebrew &quot;Yavan&quot;)
* Persians used the word &quot;Yauna&quot; from the Old Persian word for designating the Greeks, namely &quot;Yauna&quot; (literally &#x27;Ionians&#x27;, as they were the first Greeks with whom the Persians had extensive contact).
* The ancient Chinese exonym for modern-day Ferghana is &quot;Dayuan&quot;, which may come from the term Yona.

==History==
The usage of &quot;Yona&quot; and &quot;Yavana, or variants such as &quot;Yauna&quot; and &quot;Javana&quot;, appears repeatedly, and particularly in relation to the Greek kingdoms which neighboured or sometimes occupied the Punjab over a period of several centuries from the 4th century BCE to the first century CE, such as the Seleucid Empire, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom and the Indo-Greek kingdom. The Yavanar are mentioned in detail in Sangam literature epics such as &quot;Paṭṭiṉappālai&quot;, describing their brisk trade with the Early Cholas in the Sangam period.

After Alexander the Great&#x27;s invasion, the Greek settlements had existed in eastern parts of Achaemenid Empire, northwest of India, as neighbours to the Kambojas. The references to the Yonas in the early Buddhist texts may be related to the same.

The Yavanas are mentioned by the grammarian Pāṇini, probably in reference to their writing.

===Role in Buddhism===

====Edicts of Ashoka (250 BC)====
Some of the better-known examples are those of the Edicts of Ashoka (c. 250 BCE), in which the Emperor Ashoka refers to the Greek populations under his rule. Rock Edicts V and XIII mention the Yonas (or the Greeks) along with the Kambojas and Gandharas as a subject people forming a frontier region of his empire and attest that he sent envoys to the Greek rulers in the West as far as the Mediterranean, faultlessly naming them one by one.

In the Gandhari original of Rock XIII, the Greek kings to the West are associated unambiguously with the term &quot;Yona&quot;: Antiochus is referred as &quot;Amtiyoko nama Yonaraja&quot; (lit. &quot;The Greek king by the name of Antiochus&quot;), beyond whom live the four other kings: &quot;param ca tena Atiyokena cature 4 rajani Turamaye nama Amtikini nama Maka nama Alikasudaro nama&quot; (lit. &quot;And beyond Antiochus, four kings by the name of Ptolemy, the name of Antigonos, the name of Magas, the name Alexander&quot;).

====In Buddhist Texts====

Other Buddhist texts such as the &quot;Dipavamsa&quot; and the 1861 &quot;Sasana Vamsa&quot; reveal that after the Third Buddhist council, the elder monk (&quot;thero&quot;) Maharakkhita was sent to the &quot;Yona country&quot; and he preached Buddhism among the Yonas and the Kambojas, and that at the same time the Yona elder monk (&quot;thero&quot;) Dharmaraksita was sent to the country of Aparantaka in Western India also. Ashoka&#x27;s Rock Edict XIII also pairs the Yonas with the Kambojas (&quot;Yonakambojesu&quot;) and conveys that brahmans and śramaṇas are found everywhere in his empire except in the lands of the Yonas and the Kambojas.

====Mahavamsa====
The &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; or &quot;Great Chronicle&quot; of Sri Lanka refers to the thera Mahārakkhita being sent to preach to the Yona country, and also to the Yona thera Dhammarakkhita, who was sent to Aparanta (&quot;the Western Ends&quot;).
It also mentions that Pandukabhaya of Anuradhapura set aside a part of his capital city of Anuradhapura for the Yonas.

Another Yona thera, Mahādhammarakkhita, is mentioned as having come from Alexandria on the Caucasus in the country of the Yonas, to be present at the building of the Ruwanwelisaya.

====Milindapanha====
Another example is that of the Milinda Panha (Chapter I), where &quot;Yonaka&quot; is used to refer to the great Indo-Greek king Menander (160–135 BC), and to the guard of &quot;five hundred Greeks&quot; that constantly accompanies him.

===Invasion of India===
The &quot;Vanaparava&quot; of Mahabharata contains prophecies that &quot;Mleccha kings of the Shakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Bahlikas etc. shall rule the earth un-righteously in Kaliyuga ...&quot;. This reference apparently alludes to chaotic political scenario following the collapse of the Maurya and Shunga Empires in northern India and its subsequent occupation by foreign hordes such as of the Yonas, Kambojas, Sakas and Pahlavas.
There are important references to the warring Mleccha hordes of the Shakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, the Pahlavas and others in the &quot;Bala Kanda&quot; of Valmiki&#x27;s &quot;Ramayana&quot;.

Indologists like Dr H. C. Raychadhury, Dr B. C. Law, Dr Satya Shrava and others see in these verses the clear glimpses of the struggles of the Hindus with the mixed invading hordes of the barbaric Sakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Pahlavas etc. from north-west. The time frame for these struggles is 2nd century BCE downwards.

The other Indian records prophecies the 180 BCE Yona attacks on Saket, Panchala, Mathura and Pataliputra, probably against the Shunga Empire, and possibly in defence of Buddhism: &quot;After having conquered Saketa, the country of the Panchala and the Mathuras, the Yavanas, wicked and valiant, will reach Kusumadhvaja (&quot;The town of the flower-standard&quot;, Pataliputra). The thick mud-fortifications at Pataliputra being reached, all the provinces will be in disorder, without doubt. Ultimately, a great battle will follow, with tree-like engines (siege engines).&quot; &quot;The Yavanas will command, the Kings will disappear. (But ultimately) the Yavanas, intoxicated with fighting, will not stay in Madhadesa (the Middle Country); there will be undoubtedly a civil war among them, arising in their own country, there will be a terrible and ferocious war.&quot; The &quot;Anushasanaparava&quot; of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; affirms that the country of Majjhimadesa was invaded the Yavanas and the Kambojas who were later utterly defeated. The Yona invasion of Majjhimadesa (&quot;middle country, midlands&quot;) was jointly carried out by the Yonas and the Kambojas. Majjhimadesa here means the middle of Greater India which then included Afghanistan, Pakistan and large parts of Central Asia.

===Other references===
On the 110 BCE Heliodorus pillar in Vidisha in Central India, the Indo-Greek king Antialcidas, who had sent an ambassador to the court of the Shunga emperor Bhagabhadra, was also qualified as &quot;Yona&quot;.

The Mahavamsa also attests Yona settlement in Anuradhapura in ancient Sri Lanka, probably contributing to trade between East and West.

Buddhist texts like Sumangala Vilasini class the language of the Yavanas with the Milakkhabhasa i.e. &quot;impure language&quot;.

Roman traders in Tamilakkam were also considered Yavanas.

====Sanchi====

Some of the friezes of Sanchi also show devotees in Greek attire. The men are depicted with short curly hair, often held together with a headband of the type commonly seen on ancient Greek coinage. The clothing too is Greek, complete with tunics, capes and sandals. The musical instruments are also quite characteristic, such as the double flute called aulos. Also visible are carnyx-like horns. They are all celebrating at the entrance of the stupa. These men would be foreigners from north-west India visiting the stupa, possibly Mallas, Indo-Scythians or Indo-Greeks.

Three inscriptions are known from Yavana donors at Sanchi, the clearest of which reads &quot;Setapathiyasa Yonasa danam&quot; (&quot;Gift of the Yona of Setapatha&quot;), Setapatha being an uncertain city.

===Buddhist caves of Western India===

In the Great Chaitya of the Karla Caves built and dedicated by Western Satraps Nahapana in 120 CE, there are six inscriptions made by self-described Yavana donors, who donated six of the pillars, although their names are Buddhist names. They account for nearly half of the known dedicatory inscriptions on the pillars of the Chaitya.

* 3rd pillar of the left row:
:&quot;(This) pillar (is) the gift of the Yavana Sihadhaya from Dhenukataka&quot;
* 4th pillar of the left row:
:&quot;Of Dhamma, a Yavana from Dhenukakata&quot;
* 9th pillar of the left row:
:&quot;(This) pillar (is) the gift of the Yavana Yasavadhana from Denukakata&quot;
* 5th pillar of the right row:
:&quot;This pillar is the gift of the Yavana Vitasamghata from Umehanakata&quot;
* 13th pillar of the right row:
:&quot;(This) pillar (is) the gift of the Yavana Dhamadhaya from Denukakata&quot;
* 15th pillar of the right row:
:&quot;(This) pillar (is) the gift of the Yavana Chulayakha from Dhenukakata&quot;

The city of Dhenukakata is thought to be Danahu near the city of Karli. It is described by other donors in other inscriptions as a &quot;vaniya-gama&quot; (A community of merchants).

The Yavanas are also known for their donation of a complete cave at the Nasik Caves (cave No.17), and for their donations with inscriptions at the Junnar caves.

== The Yonas and other northwestern invaders in Indian literature ==
The Yavanas or Yonas are frequently found listed with the Kambojas, Sakas, Pahlavas and other northwestern tribes in numerous ancient Indian texts.

The Mahabharata groups the Yavanas with the Kambojas and the Chinas and calls them &quot;Mlechchas&quot; (Barbarians). In the Shanti Parva section, the Yavanas are grouped with the Kambojas, Kiratas, Sakas, and the Pahlavas etc. and are spoken of as living the life of Dasyus (dacoits). In another chapter of the same Parva, the Yaunas, Kambojas, Gandharas etc. are spoken of as equal to the &quot;Svapakas&quot; and the &quot;Grddhras&quot;.

Udyogaparva of Mahabharata says that the composite army of the Kambojas, Yavanas and Sakas had participated in the Mahabharata war under the supreme command of Kamboja king Sudakshina. The epic numerously applauds this composite army as being very fierce and wrathful.

Balakanda of Ramayana also groups the Yavanas with the Kambojas, Sakas, Pahlavas etc. and refers to them as the military allies of sage Vishistha against Vedic king Vishwamitra The Kishkindha Kanda of Ramayana locates the Sakas, Kambojas, Yavanas and Paradas in the extreme north-west beyond the Himavat (i.e. Hindukush).

The Buddhist drama Mudrarakshasa by Visakhadutta as well as the Jaina works Parishishtaparvan refer to Chandragupta&#x27;s alliance with Himalayan king Parvataka. This Himalayan alliance gave Chandragupta a powerful composite army made up of the frontier martial tribes of the Shakas, Kambojas, Yavanas, Parasikas, Bahlikas etc. which he may have utilised to aid defeat the Greek successors of Alexander the Great and the Nanda rulers of Magadha, and thus establishing his Mauryan Empire in northern India.

Manusmriti lists the Yavanas with the Kambojas, Sakas, Pahlavas, Paradas etc. and regards them as degraded Kshatriyas (Hindu caste). Anushasanaparva of Mahabharata also views the Yavanas, Kambojas, Shakas etc. in the same light. Patanjali&#x27;s Mahabhashya regards the Yavanas and Sakas as Anirvasita (pure) Shudras. Gautama-Dharmasutra regards the Yavanas or Greeks as having sprung from Shudra females and Kshatriya males.

The Assalayana Sutta of Majjhima Nikaya attests that in Yona and Kamboja nations, there were only two classes of people...Aryas and Dasas...the masters and slaves, and that the Arya could become Dasa and vice versa. The Vishnu Purana also indicates that the &quot;Chaturvarna&quot; or four class social system was absent in the lands of Kiratas in the East, and the Yavanas and Kambojas etc. in the West.

Numerous Puranic literature groups the Yavanas with the Sakas, Kambojas, Pahlavas and Paradas and refers to the peculiar hair styles of these people which were different from those of the Hindus. Ganapatha on Pāṇini attests that it was a practice among the Yavanas and the Kambojas to wear short-cropped hair (&quot;Kamboja-mundah Yavana-mundah&quot;).

Vartika of Katayayana informs us that the kings of the Shakas and the Yavanas, like those of the Kambojas, may also be addressed by their respective tribal names.

Brihatkathamanjari of Kshmendra informs us that king Vikramaditya had unburdened the sacred earth of the Barbarians like the Shakas, Kambojas, Yavanas, Tusharas, Parasikas, Hunas etc. by annihilating these sinners completely.

The Brahmanda Purana refers to the horses born in Yavana country.

The Mahaniddesa speaks of Yona and Parama Yona, probably referring to Arachosia as the Yona and Bactria as the Parama Yona.

==Later meanings==

The terms &quot;Yona&quot;, &quot;Yonaka&quot; or &quot;Yavana&quot; literally referred to the Greeks, however &quot;mlechas&quot; was also used probably due to their barbaric behaviour as invaders. Indian languages did not base a distinction on religion early on but after the arrival of Islam to the subcontinent, the term Yavana was used along with Turuka, Turuska, Tajik, and Arab more than Mussalaman or Muslim for invaders professing Islam as their religion.

The Chams of Champa are thought referring Đại Việt as &quot;Yavana&quot;. However this statement is largely vague. Cham sources refer Dai Viet as &quot;nagara Yuen&quot; (Cham: nagara yvan, lit. &quot;Viet state&quot;), and the Viets as &quot;Yuen&quot; (yvan). Both terminologies in Cham materials were written in Cham script and Old Cam, the first dated 1142 during the reign of Harivarman I, showing little linguistic evidence to prove that Cham &quot;Yuen&quot; and Indian &quot;Yavana&quot; are connected. Similarly for Kiernan&#x27;s argument to Khmer &quot;Yuon&quot;, the Cham reference for the Viet should have been derived from &quot;Yue&quot; or &quot;Viet&quot;.

The Khmer word &quot;Yuon&quot; (yuôn) យួន /yuən/ was thought to be an ethnic slur for Vietnamese, derived from the Indian word for Greek, &quot;Yavana&quot;, however, it is actually the transcription of the word &quot;Viet&quot; or &quot;Yueh&quot; rather than &quot;Yavana&quot;, because the Khmer word &quot;Yuon&quot; spelled with the diphthong uo, not v in &quot;Yavana&quot;. According to Kiernan, &quot;the Pol Pot regime, following French orientalists, mythologized its conflict with Hanoi as part of a millennial ethnic epic&quot;; therefore they altered the meaning of &quot;yuon&quot; that being misleading implied as &quot;savages, foreigners&quot;.

The Sinhalese term Yonaka referring to the Sri Lankan Moors, is thought to have been derived from the term Yona.

==Contemporary usage==
The word Yona, or one of its derivatives, is still used by some languages to designate contemporary Greece, such as in Arabic (), in Hebrew (), in Turkish (&quot;Yunanistan&quot;), in Armenian ( &quot;Hounistan&quot;), modern Aramaic ( &quot;Yawnoye&quot;), or the Pashto, Hindi, Urdu, Malay and Indonesian languages (&quot;Yunani&quot;).

<text>Matthew Joseph Thaddeus Stepanek (July 17, 1990 – June 22, 2004), known as Mattie J.T. Stepanek, was an American poet (or, as he wanted to be remembered, &quot;a poet, a peacemaker, and a philosopher who played&quot;) who published seven best-selling books of poetry and peace essays. Before his death at the age of 13, he had become known as a peace advocate and motivational speaker.

==Life and career==
Matthew Stepanek was born on July 17, 1990. Stepanek&#x27;s parents divorced when he was a child. He was raised in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, and later lived in Rockville, Maryland. His hero was former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who described Stepanek as &quot;the most extraordinary person whom I have ever known&quot;.

Stepanek had the rare disorder dysautonomic mitochondrial myopathy. His three older siblings died from the same illness. The condition was unknown until his mother was diagnosed with mitochondrial disease in 1992, after all four of the children had been born.

Stepanek was a poet and speaker. He wrote six volumes of bestselling &quot;Heartsongs&quot; poetry books, and a collection of peace essays that also became a bestseller.

He was the lyricist for &quot;Music Through Heartsongs&quot; performed by Billy Gilman. The album was released by Epic Records in April 2003. It debuted at number 109 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and at number 15 on the Hot Country Songs chart.

===Death===
Stepanek died at age 13 at Children&#x27;s National Medical Center in Washington, D.C., on June 22, 2004. He was interred at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Silver Spring, Maryland.

==Legacy==
Shortly after Stepanek&#x27;s death in 2004, the non-profit Mattie Stepanek Peace Foundation was established by a group of citizens in Rockville, Maryland, where Stepanek had lived.

In 2008, the We Are Family Foundation hosted the first annual international Three Dot Dash Just Peace Summit based on the message Stepanek offered in his book &quot;Just Peace&quot;.

On October 21, 2008, the Mattie J.T. Stepanek Park was dedicated in Rockville, Maryland, at an event attended by Oprah Winfrey, Nile Rodgers, Billy Gilman and others. Pepper Choplin set words from Stepanek&#x27;s final peace speech to music, and a 100-voice choir performed the debut of the song &quot;Look Up Way Down&quot;. Central to the park is its Peace Garden, which has a design based on the peace imagery Stepanek used in his book of essays &quot;Just Peace: A Message of Hope&quot;. In the Peace Garden there is a life-size bronze statue of Stepanek and his service dog, Micah, surrounded by chess tables. Throughout the park are presentations of quotes from Stepanek.

On June 6, 2010, a performance of &quot;Heartsongs&quot; took place at Carnegie Hall. It featured Stepanek&#x27;s poetry, set to music by composer Joseph Martin. The music was performed by 200 members of Distinguished Concerts Singers International—including its Children&#x27;s Choir—under the direction of conductor Stephen Roddy.

In 2011, Oprah Winfrey named Stepanek as one of her all-time most memorable guests in the 25-year history of her show. Mattie convinced Oprah not to retire from her show on its 20th anniversary, saying by email that the show was &quot;good for the world and good for [Oprah]&quot;. During the final studio audience taping, Stepanek&#x27;s mother and Oprah shared memories of Stepanek; they discussed his life story as told in the book &quot;Messenger&quot; book; and Oprah called him &quot;a messenger for our times&quot;.

In 2013, the National Catholic Partnership on Disability posthumously honored Stepanek with its Youth//Young Adult Leadership Award.

At the behest of the Mattie Stepanek Peace Foundation, in 2013, Barbara Mikulski, a United States senator from Maryland, sent a letter to US President Barack Obama, wanting to declare July 17 (Stepanek&#x27;s birthday) a national peace day in Stepanek&#x27;s honor. In July 2014, Ben Cardin, a junior United States senator from Maryland, joined Mikulski in introducing Senate Resolution 509, which was approved by the Senate and which honors Stepanek&#x27;s life and peace legacy. In 2017, the city of Rockville, Maryland, voted to declare Mattie&#x27;s July 17 birthday as &quot;Peace Day&quot; at a local level in perpetua, as a statement of support for the National Peace Day Campaign.

== Cause for canonization ==
On September 21, 2012, the feast day of Matthew the Apostle, the Mattie J.T. Stepanek Guild was officially initiated. The purpose of the guild is to gather information and investigate Stepanek&#x27;s life for the possible cause of canonization in the Catholic Church.

On June 22, 2014, a Memorial Mass at the Franciscan Monastery in Washington, D.C., commemorated the tenth anniversary of Stepanek&#x27;s death. It was con-celebrated by several priests from the Archdiocese of Washington.

<doc id="746381" wikidata="Q2141538" url="?curid=746381" title="Television Infrared Observation Satellite">
<text>Television InfraRed Observation Satellite (TIROS) is a series of early weather satellites launched by the United States, beginning with TIROS-1 in 1960. TIROS was the first satellite that was capable of remote sensing of the Earth, enabling scientists to view the Earth from a new perspective: space. The program, promoted by Harry Wexler, proved the usefulness of satellite weather observation, at a time when military reconnaissance satellites were secretly in development or use. TIROS demonstrated at that time that &quot;the key to genius is often simplicity&quot;. TIROS is an acronym of &quot;Television InfraRed Observation Satellite&quot; and is also the plural of &quot;tiro&quot; which means &quot;a young soldier, a beginner&quot;.

The Advanced Research Projects Agency (now DARPA) initiated the TIROS program in 1958 and transferred the program to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1959. Participants in the TIROS program also included, United States Army Signal Research and Development Laboratory, Radio Corporation of America (RCA), the United States Weather Bureau Service, the United States Naval Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC), the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

== History ==

The TIROS project emerged from early efforts examining the feasibility of surveillance from space for meteorology and intelligence gathering which began in the U.S. as early as the late 1940s. The Radio Corporation of America conducted a study for the RAND Corporation in 1951, concluding that a spaceborne television camera could provide worthwhile information for general reconnaissance. In 1956, the RCA received funding from the U.S. Army to develop a reconnaissance satellite program, initially called Janus, under the administration of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA). The project remained under the administration of ABMA but was transferred to the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, now DARPA) in 1958. The contract called for the development of a spacecraft to be launched using the Jupiter-C launch vehicle, which was eventually revised to the Juno II launch vehicle. Janus and Janus II, prototype satellites without directional stability and a single onboard camera, were built as part of the project. In May 1958, a committee chaired by William Welch Kellogg of the RAND Corporation with representatives from the U.S. Armed Forces, the U.S. Weather Bureau, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, and the RCA was convened to discuss a satellite meteorological program and design objectives. The committee recommended that such a program should provide observations of cloud cover with television cameras at coarser and finer resolutions, accompanied by infrared measurements of Earth&#x27;s radiation; the goal of the first meteorological satellites would be to trial experimental television techniques, validate sun- and horizon-based sensors for spacecraft orientation, and collect meteorological data.

While Janus was in development, Herbert York, the Director of Defense Research and Engineering, moved Department of Defense reconnaissance satellites out of the purview of the U.S. Army. With meteorological satellites flagged as a high-priority requirement by the U.S. government, the RCA shifted the goals of the Janus project towards meteorological applications, whose relaxed resolution requirements for cameras enabled smaller and lighter satellite systems. Accordingly, the resolution of the television cameras planned for Janus was lowered, relying on off-the-shelf refractive optics rather than the more sophisticated systems originally planned. The U.S. Army also granted an ARPA request to develop a larger launch vehicle for larger satellites, allowing the RCA to change the Janus design to a larger spin-stabilized spacecraft. The Janus project was renamed to Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) following the changes and the project was declassified.

Development of the TIROS satellite payload was contracted to the Army Signal Corps Laboratories and $3.6 million was allocated to Air Force Systems Command for use of the Thor launch vehicle. Before signing the National Aeronautics and Space Act that created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), President Dwight D. Eisenhower determined that NASA should handle meteorological satellite development. Edgar Cortright, the ARPA committee overseeing the TIROS project, arranged the transfer of TIROS to NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center on April 13, 1959. The acquisition of the TIROS project from ARPA by NASA was seen as a means to provide good publicity and validate the existence of the nascent civilian agency. The agency treated the project as an experimental testbed rather than as an operational aid or as a platform for taking scientific observations. The United States Weather Bureau and Department of Defense Weather Services favored operational use of early TIROS data. This tension led to the formation of the Panel on Operational Meteorological Satellites, an interagency group, in October 1960 to ascertain the objectives of an operational meteorological satellite program.

The initial TIROS mission design called for three satellites. Each satellite was to carry a two-lens optical television system built by the RCA, an improved infrared scanning system drawn from the Vanguard 2 spacecraft, and a radiometer developed by Verner E. Suomi to measure Earth&#x27;s energy budget. However, only the optical system was included in the first TIROS payload, TIROS-1, launched on April 1, 1960, as the first U.S. satellite to carry a television camera. The originally planned instruments were included in the subsequent launches of TIROS-2, TIROS-3, and TIROS-4 over the following two years.

Despite the early success of TIROS, early difficulties with handling TIROS data and political pressure to develop an operational weather satellite system based around a second spacecraft in development, Nimbus. However, delays and the high cost of the Nimbus program ultimately led to TIROS-based spacecraft serving as the United States&#x27; fleet of operational weather satellites. The second generation of TIROS satellites, designated as ESSA, fulfilled this role as the TIROS Operational System (TOS) beginning in 1966. Nine ESSA satellites were launched during 1966–1969. The odd-numbered ESSA satellites provided meteorological data to national meteorological services while television images from the even-numbered ESSA satellites could be received from simple stations globally through an Automated Picture Transmission (APT) system. A third generation of TIROS satellites, named the Improved TIROS Operational System (ITOS), was developed and launched in the 1970s, combining the capabilities of the two types of ESSA satellites and serving in an operational capacity. Unlike the preceding TIROS generations, the ITOS spacecraft featured three-axis stabilization. Later ITOS satellites included additional instruments and improved versions of the preceding instruments, including the Very High Resolution Radiometer.

In 1978, RCA completed the first spacecraft in the TIROS-N series, the fourth generation of TIROS satellites. These offered a new suite of instruments including the Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). Later TIROS-N satellites, beginning with NOAA-E in 1983, had higher data-handling capacity and carried new instruments on a slightly larger spacecraft bus; these satellites were collectively known as Advanced TIROS-N (ATN). NOAA-N Prime (later designated NOAA-19) was the last spacecraft in the TIROS series, launching in February 2009.

== Series ==
TIROS continued as the more advanced TIROS Operational System (TOS), and eventually was succeeded by the Improved TIROS Operational System (ITOS) or TIROS-M, and then by the TIROS-N and Advanced TIROS-N series of satellites. NOAA-N Prime (NOAA-19) is the last in the TIROS series of NOAA satellites that observe Earth&#x27;s weather and the environment.

The naming of the satellites can become confusing because some of them use the same name as the over-seeing organization, such as &quot;ESSA&quot; for TOS satellites overseen by the Environmental Science Services Administration (for example, ESSA-1) and &quot;NOAA&quot; (for example, NOAA-M) for later TIROS-series satellites overseen by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

=== First generation (1960–1965) ===

The first ten TIROS satellites, beginning with the launch of TIROS-1 in 1960 and ending with the launch of TIROS-10 in 1965, were polar orbiting spacecraft developed and operated under the aegis of NASA. Each spacecraft had design lifetimes of six months, with a new spacecraft launch every six months. The primary goal of the first TIROS satellites was to trial the use of spaceborne television camera systems for imaging cloud cover. During the first generation, the scope of the TIROS project evolved from an initially experimental to a semi-operational stature. Following TIROS-1, the engineering and mission design of successive TIROS spacecraft were intended to resolve shortcomings observed in earlier iterations. 

The spacecraft bus for the first generation of TIROS spacecraft were drum-shaped 18-sided right prisms spanning about in diameter and in height. Made of aluminum alloy and stainless steel, each spacecraft weighed around . The satellites were powered by nickel–cadmium batteries, which in turn were charged by 9,200 solar cells mounted throughout the sides of the spacecraft. The TIROS spacecraft were designed to spin at 8–12 rpm to maintain spin stabilization. Pairs of solid-propellant rockets mounted on the base plate of the instrument housing could be fired one pair at a time to increased the rotation rate by 3 rpm to counteract degradation in the spin rate. The cameras on the first eight TIROS satellites were also located on the base plate and aligned parallel to the spacecraft&#x27;s axis of rotation. The lack of attitude control on the first generation of TIROS meant that Earth was only in the field of view of the cameras for a portion of the satellite orbit, with the satellite holding a fixed orientation relative to space for its entire service lifetime by design. Interaction with Earth&#x27;s magnetic field caused the axis of rotation of TIROS-1 to oscillate. A magnetorquer was introduced on TIROS-2 and maintained through TIROS-8 to allow 1.5° changes in the spacecraft attitude per orbit by gradually varying the spacecraft&#x27;s own magnetic field. A more robust magnetic system, named the Quarter Orbit Magnetic Attitude Control System, was introduced on TIROS-9, allowing for quicker and finer attitude control and enabling changes in the spacecraft spin axis by up to 10°. The cameras on TIROS-9 were affixed radially on the sides of the spacecraft rather than the base plate. This &quot;wheel&quot; configuration, in contrast to the &quot;axial&quot; configuration of the preceding TIROS spacecraft, allowed more frequent imagery of the Earth.
The first generation of TIROS satellites carried two diameter Vidicon line-scan cameras, typically with different fields of view supporting different angular resolution. The magnetic tape recorder on early iterations of TIROS could store a total of 64 pictures taken at fixed 30-second intervals, equivalent to at most two orbits of data. Imaging capacity was increased to 96 pictures beginning with TIROS-9, and implementation of a clock system enabled for variable intervals between images. TIROS-8 served as a test run of the new APT system, allowing images to be readily broadcast and received without dependence on onboard storage. Subsequent TIROS spacecraft maintained the APT system accompanied by improvements to both the onboard system and expansion of the ground station network. Some of the early TIROS spacecraft also included a five-channel medium resolution infrared scanning radiometer and a low resolution radiometer. The five-channel radiometer allowed for observations of both daytime and nighttime cloud cover. Data were transmitted via four antennas protruding from the spacecraft base plate, with a single receiving antenna mounted at the center of the top plate.

Each of the first ten TIROS missions were planned to take circular Sun-synchronous orbits with an altitude of about ; over-performance of the second stage of TIROS-9&#x27;s launching system resulted in the errant placement of that spacecraft in an elliptical orbit. The first four TIROS satellites were launched into circular orbits with an inclination of 48° with respect to the equator, providing coverage of the Earth between 55°N and 55°S. Concurrent improvements in the Thor-Delta launch vehicle selected for the TIROS program permitted increases in the orbital inclination of later payloads. The following four satellites from TIROS-5 through TIROS-8 had a higher inclination of 58°, expanding satellite coverage to 65°N–65°S. TIROS-9 and TIROS-10 achieved full coverage of the Earth&#x27;s daylight side with near-polar orbital inclinations of 98° with respect to the equator. The orientations of the first eight TIROS satellites and their orbits constrained the observable portion of Earth&#x27;s sunlit side, relying on orbital precession over the course of several months to cover areas in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres.

* TIROS-10 (OT-1): launched on 2 July 1965, deactivated on 1 July 1967.

As of June 2009, all TIROS satellites launched between 1960 and 1965 (with the exception of TIROS-7) were still in orbit.

=== TIROS Operational System ===
* ESSA-1 (OT-3)
* ESSA-2 (OT-2)
* ESSA-3 (TOS-A)
* ESSA-4 (TOS-B)
* ESSA-5 (TOS-C)
* ESSA-6 (TOS-D)
* ESSA-7 (TOS-E)
* ESSA-8 (TOS-F)
* ESSA-9 (TOS-G)

=== ITOS/TIROS-M ===
* TIROS-M (ITOS-1): launched on 23 January 1970
* NOAA-1 (ITOS-A): launched on 11 December 1970
* ITOS-B launched on 21 October 1971, unusable orbit
* ITOS-C
* NOAA-2 (ITOS-D): launched on 15 October 1972
* ITOS-E launched on 16 July 1973, failed to orbit
* NOAA-3 (ITOS-F): launched on 6 November 1973
* NOAA-4 (ITOS-G): launched on 15 November 1974
* NOAA-5 (ITOS-H): launched 29 July 1976

=== TIROS-N ===
* TIROS-N (Proto-flight): Launched 13 October 1978 into a 470-nmi orbit; deactivated on 27 February 1981.
* NOAA-6 (NOAA-A prior to launch): Launched 27 June 1979 into a 450-nmi orbit. The HIRS, a primary mission sensor, failed 19 September 1983. The satellite exceeded its two-year designed lifetime by almost six years when deactivated on 31 March 1987.
* NOAA-B: Launched 29 May 1980. It failed to achieve a usable orbit because of a booster engine anomaly.
* NOAA-7 (C): Launched 23 June 1981 into a 470-nmi orbit; deactivated June 1986.
* NOAA-12 (D): Launched 14 May 1991 into a 450-nmi AM orbit, out of sequence (see below). Placed in standby mode on 14 December 1998, when NOAA-15 became operational and deactivated on 10 August 2007, setting an extended lifetime record of over sixteen years.

=== Advanced TIROS-N ===
The Advanced TIROS-N (ATN) spacecraft were similar to the NOAA-A through -D satellites, apart from an enlarged Equipment Support Module to allow integration of additional payloads. A change from the TIROS-N through NOAA-D spacecraft was that spare word locations in the low bit rate data system TIROS Information Processor (TIP) was used for special instruments such as the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBE) and SBUV/2. The search and rescue (SAR) system became independent, utilizing a special frequency for transmission of data to the ground.

* NOAA-8 (E): Launched 28 March 1983 into a orbit, out of sequence (before NOAA-D) to get the first SAR system on a US satellite operational. Deactivated 29 December 1985, following a thermal runaway which destroyed a battery. 
* NOAA-9 (F): Launched 12 December 1984 into 470 nmi &quot;afternoon&quot; orbit and was the first satellite to carry an SBUV/2 instrument. It was deactivated on 1 August 1993 but was reactivated three weeks later, after the failure of NOAA-13. The SARR transmitter failed on 18 December 1997 and the satellite was permanently deactivated on 13 February 1998.
* NOAA-10 (G): Launched 17 September 1986 into a 450 nmi &quot;morning&quot; orbit. Placed in standby mode on 17 September 1991 (when NOAA-12 became operational) and deactivated on 30 August 2001.
* NOAA-11 (H): Launched 24 September 1988 into a 470 nmi PM orbit. Placed in standby mode in March 1995 and was reactivated in May 1997 to provide soundings after an HIRS anomaly on NOAA-12. Decommissioned 16 June 2004.
* NOAA-13 (I): Launched 9 August 1993 into a 470 nmi PM orbit; two weeks after launch the spacecraft suffered a catastrophic power system anomaly. Attempts to contact or command the spacecraft were unsuccessful.
* NOAA-14 (J): Launched 30 December 1994 into a 470 nmi PM orbit and decommissioned 23 May 2007 after more than twelve years of operation.
* NOAA-15 (K): Launched 13 May 1998 into a 450 nmi morning orbit and replaced NOAA-12 on 14 December 1998, as the primary AM spacecraft. Now secondary, with MetOp-B as the AM primary.
* NOAA-16 (L): Launched 21 September 2000 into a 470-nmi afternoon orbit; replaced NOAA-14 on 19 March 2001, as the primary AM spacecraft. Decommissioned on 9 June 2014 due to major spacecraft anomaly.
* NOAA-17 (M): Launched 24 June 2002 into a 450 nmi AM orbit and decommissioned 10 April 2013.
* NOAA-18 (N): Launched 20 May 2005 into a 470 nmi afternoon orbit and replaced NOAA-16 as the PM primary spacecraft on 30 August 2005.
* NOAA-19 (N Prime): Launched 6 February 2009 into a 470 nmi afternoon orbit and replaced NOAA-18 as the PM primary spacecraft on 2 June 2009.

<text>Saint Yared (Ge&#x27;ez: ቅዱስ ያሬድ; 25 April 505 – 20 May 571) was an Aksumite composer in the 6th century. Often credited with being the forerunner of traditional music of Ethiopia, he developed the music of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and Eritrean Orthodox Church. In a broader context, he helped establish liturgical music in the Coptic Orthodox Church and Syriac Orthodox Church, as well as create the Ethiopian musical notation system. Additionally, he composed &quot;Zema,&quot; or the chant tradition of Ethiopia, particularly the chants of the Ethiopian-Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churches, which are still performed today.

St. Yared was from Axum; according to traditional legend, his earlier education dwindled after his father&#x27;s death, and his mother subsequently sent him to parish priest Abba Gedeon. Upon embarking on exile to his uncle&#x27;s birthplace in Murade Qal, St. Yared remorsed from his failure in education after he saw the exemplification of a caterpillar&#x27;s effort to climb up a tree to its peak. Stimulated by the caterpillar&#x27;s success, St. Yared gained confidence in his worth and subsequently achieved success in later life. He became a priest of the Holy Ark of Sion. During the reign of Emperor Gebre Meskel (son of Emperor Kaleb), St. Yared significantly gained prominence for his musical style, and the emperor loved him.

During the Nine Saints expedition from the Byzantine Empire, St. Yared cooperated with them to build several churches in Tigray.

He is regarded as a saint of the Ethiopian-Eritrean Orthodox Church, with his feast day celebrated on 19 May. His name is from the Biblical person known in English as &quot;Jared&quot; (Book of Genesis 5:15).

==Traditional account==
It was widely accepted that St. Yared was born on 25 April 505 in the city of Axum, Axumite Kingdom from his mother Tauklia and his father Adam. When he reached six, his parent gave him tutelage of Yishaq, who was a teacher of Axum. Under his instruction, St. Yared completed the alphabet and Psalms. Yishaq brought St. Yared back to his parent and his father died. Unable to raise him, his mother Tauklia left him to his uncle Abba Gedeon, who was a parish priest. Gedeon was a teacher of Old and New Testament in Saint Mary of Sion and he began translating Holy Scriptures into Ge&#x27;ez from Hebrew and Greek. At that time St. Yared was in poor education and unable to acquire knowledge, which led him severe punishments and mockery at school. Aware of his failure, St. Yared decided to go on to his uncle&#x27;s birthplace Medebai Welel. Due to heavy rain, St. Yared sheltered under a nearby tree in place of Murade Qal.

Pondering his life, St. Yared rested and noticed a caterpillar climbing the tree to eat leaves. The caterpillar continued to fall down, but eventually, it succeeded in reaching its destination. St. Yared wept and returned to Gedeon and pledged him not to offend. Gedeon began teaching Psalms. St. Yared subsequently moved to Saint Mary of Sion for prayer. When St. Yared was fourteen, Gedeon died; St. Yared took his mastering position.

He then returned to Axum at the age of nineteen, becoming the chief priest in the Holy Ark of Sion. Soon after, St. Yared composed &quot;Ariam&quot;.

While at Axum, St. Yared created musical notations and alphabets, as well as &quot;mequamia&quot;.

During the 14-year rule of King Gebre Meskel (the son of King Kaleb) from 525 to 539, St. Yared became a dominant musical figure in Axum. He proclaimed as the greatest poet and the King favored him. Soon after St. Yared composed &quot;Zema&quot;, resulting in his succession in church service. During this, St. Yared decided to live with ascetics and requested to the Emperor:

Promise to grant me...allow me to retire from my work in the court and to live among the people so that I may devote the rest of my life teaching, to meditation and to prayer.

Though Gebre Meskel resented his retirement, he kept his promise and granted him to leave his service. St. Yared travelled to Semien Mountains.

St. Yared became a pioneer in observing Hossana, also called Palm Sunday in Axum. He divided hymns into four parts: winter, summer, autumn and spring. He completed the Book of Deggua, (De&#x27;guaa) in Geʽez, which means &quot;lamentations&quot;. Deggua divides into three chanting modes: Geʽez, Ezel, Araray. Geʽez relies a plain chant for ordinary days, Ezel is increased measured beat for funerals and Araray is a free mode, light beats for festivals. The highest part of Deggua is Mahlet St. Yared (hymn of St. Yared). Those three chants represent the Trinity.

St. Yared also composed ten tones with notations, unlike the European modes consisting of six notes. St. Yared then developed their arrangements called &quot;Seraye&quot;, which signifies hymnary guidelines. The glyphs of notations consist of dashes, dots and curves. Tsome Deggua is written for Lent, Me&#x27;eraf is sung for Sabbath vigils, Zimare is for Holy Communion, Mewasit is for funerals, requiems and Eastern Eve and Quidase is for Communion. These books take nine years to complete.

The Nine Saints, who were expelled by religious persecution from Byzantine Empire and who reached Ethiopia in the 5th century, met with St. Yared, with whom he visited individual churches and aided them in building with the assistance of Axumite Emperors. St. Yared also consecrated Debre Damo churches founded by Abuna Aregawi. One place where St. Yared successfully gave mastery is St. Qirkos in Lake Tana.

St. Yared communication with one of the saints named Abba Pantelewon was expedient. Pantelewon said that St. Yared knew Western tradition and he went to Constantinople once. He recalled that &quot;I went to Rome [Second Rome Constantinople] where I saw a Church, I knew her and loved her like my own sister, a few years later, I visited her again during the time she was bathing in the river Tigre.&quot;

Through the assistance of Pantelewon, Aragawi and Abba Yesehaq, St. Yared acknowledged the Western culture. According to &quot;Tarika Nagast&quot; and &quot;Gadla Aragawi&quot;, King Gebre Meskel, Aragawi and St. Yared maintained a stable friendship for establishing churches in Gojjam, Begemder (today: Gondar), and Tigray. After two years, they went to Gayint and built a church called Saint Mariam at Zur Amba. The foundation is said to be as a result of &quot;God&#x27;s guide&quot; and this location was named &quot;Zur Amba&quot; after &quot;appearance of God to Aragawi&quot;. The account wrote about God&#x27;s appearance and guidance to Aragawi in Geʽez: &quot;Zur Abba Mengale Misraq...&quot; which means &quot;...Abba, turn to the east; you will find the way to the hill.&quot;

== Later life and death ==
On the coronation of Gebre Meskel, Yared placed a wreath of flowers to crown on him. The event is found in Deggua.

St. Yared died at the age of 66 on 20 May 571 in a cave of Semien Mountains. He had been travelling to teach.

19 May is conceived as his feast day and the Orthodox Tewahedo Church venerate in commemoration of his death.

==In popular culture==
Little known of the life of St. Yared outside the traditional account. St. Yared thought to gather his pupils to teach his musical system after asceticism in monastic life. He has been said to bequeath musical heir where the practice also revolutionised &quot;a genealogy of masters from St. Yared in the 6th-century to Aleqa Mersha in the 20th-century&quot;. St. Yared&#x27;s chant and voice are revered as powerful; his performance on liturgical music outstrips into secular domain, where &quot;the remark [is] often made of a good singer; his voice makes one cry.&quot; His work has been contested to controversy by religious and secular discourse. Secular teaching argued that St. Yared is the base and father of secular music. The outlook of &quot;secular music&quot; is strongly objected to by the Orthodox Church. Other challenges are spiritual songs in audio and audiovisual form are possible without an original hymn. Without proper knowledge, some musicians prepare religious music and some singers take to secular form. The most contentious is the use of church treasures such as drum, sistrum, clothes and sticks currently used by Protestant followers. Some of St. Yared&#x27;s songs like &quot;Yekome Were&quot;, &quot;Yetegulet Digua&quot;, &quot;Yeankober Wereb&quot;, Yewashera Qine&quot;, Yeachabr Wereb&quot;, &quot;Yeselelkula Kidase&quot;, &quot;Ye Aba Giorgis&quot; and &quot;Ze Gasicha Seatat&quot; are becoming obsolete or few scholars have no students.

===Reception===
St. Yared is regarded by Ethiopian Studies scholars as the founder of &quot;qene&quot;. His musical work swayed Yohannes of Gebla in Wollo and Tewanei of Deg Istifa in Gojjam, who improvised into complex forms. The work also contributed to service from time of day to day of the year, depending on valuable occasional feasts and religious seasons. Deggua&#x27;s summary opening by:

Oh! Music!...

Ah! Music that I heard the angels&#x27; sing in Heaven

Uttering Holy! Holy! Lord!

The Heavens and the Earth are filled with

Your holy praise

Tradition holds that St. Yared ascended to Heaven supported by angels Seraph and Cherub, singing &quot;Holy! Holy! Holy!&quot;, a paraphrase of Ancient of Days in Book of Daniel. In addition, it augmented supernatural entities bolstered him: three white angels, and three white birds singing with animals and beasts. His compositions also reflect agriculture and seasons. For example, for the rainy season (mid-June to mid-September) and for the harvest season (mid-September to mid-December):
;Rainy season

Listen to the sound of the footsteps of the rain!

When the rains pour down, the poor rejoice.

Listen to the sound of the footsteps of the rain!

When the rains pour down, the hungry are satiated...

The clouds hear and obey His word;

And the streams brim with water.

And the furrows quench their thirst...

;Harvest season

In its own time, the rainy season has passed.

Now is established the season of plenty.

Behold! The plants have blossomed and brought forth fruit...

<text>Vanguard 2 (or Vanguard 2E before launch) is an Earth-orbiting satellite launched 17 February 1959 at 15:55:02 GMT, aboard a Vanguard SLV-4 rocket as part of the United States Navy&#x27;s Project Vanguard. The satellite was designed to measure cloud cover distribution over the daylight portion of its orbit, for a period of 19 days, and to provide information on the density of the atmosphere for the lifetime of its orbit (about 300 years). As the first weather satellite and one of the first orbital space missions, the launch of Vanguard 2 was an important milestone in the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union. Vanguard 2 remains in orbit.


== Previous satellites ==
Before the successful 1959 launch of the satellite that became known as Vanguard 2, multiple attempted launches of satellites named &quot;Vanguard 2&quot; were made in 1958. All of these launches failed to reach orbit. The satellites that failed to reach orbit were:

* Vanguard 2A: launched 29 April 1958, by the Vanguard TV-5 rocket
* Vanguard 2B: launched 28 May 1958, by the Vanguard SLV-1 rocket
* Vanguard 2C: launched 26 June 1958, by the Vanguard SLV-2 rocket
* Vanguard 2D: launched 26 September 1958, by the Vanguard SLV-3 rocket

The satellite whose launch was successful and that became known as the Vanguard 2 was the Vanguard 2E.

== Spacecraft ==
The spacecraft is a magnesium sphere in diameter. It contains two optical telescopes with two photocells. The sphere was internally gold-plated, and externally covered with an aluminum deposit coated with silicon oxide of sufficient thickness to provide thermal control for the instrumentation.

Radio communication was provided by a 1 watt, 108.03 MHz telemetry transmitter and a 10 mW, 108 MHz beacon transmitter that sent a continuous signal for tracking purposes. A command receiver was used to activate a tape recorder that relayed telescope experiment data to the telemetry transmitter.

The power supply for the instrumentation was provided by mercury batteries.

== Instruments ==
=== Optical scanner ===
The optical scanner experiment was designed to obtain cloud cover data between the equator and 35° to 45° N latitude. As the satellite circled Earth, two photocells, located at the focus of two optical telescopes aimed in diametrically opposite directions, measured the intensity of sunlight reflected from clouds (about 80%), from land masses (15 to 20%), and from sea areas (5%). The satellite motion and rotation caused the photocells to scan the Earth in successive &quot;lines&quot; (akin to a whisk broom scanner). Separate solar batteries turned on a recorder only when the Earth beneath the satellite was in sunlight and about 50 minutes of data per orbit were obtained. The measured reflection intensities were stored on tape. Ground stations interrogated the satellite by signaling its command receiver, which caused the entire tape to be played back in 60 seconds. The tape was then erased and rewound. For the planned 19 days of the weather experiment, the equipment functioned normally. The satellite was spin-stabilized at 50 rpm, but the optical instrument&#x27;s data was poor because of an unsatisfactory orientation of the spin axis.

=== Satellite drag atmospheric density ===
Because of its symmetrical shape, Vanguard 2 was selected by the experimenters for use in determining upper atmospheric densities as a function of altitude, latitude, season, and solar activity. As the spacecraft continuously orbited, it would lead its predicted positions slightly, accumulating greater and greater advance as it spiraled lower and faster due to the drag of the residual atmosphere. By measuring the rate and timing of orbital shifts, the relevant atmosphere&#x27;s parameters could be back-calculated knowing the body&#x27;s drag properties. It was determined that atmospheric pressures, and thus drag and orbital decay, were higher than anticipated, as Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere gradually tapered into space.

This experiment was planned in great detail prior to launch. Initial Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) proposals for Project Vanguard included conical satellite bodies; this eliminated the need for a separate fairing and ejection mechanisms, and their associated weight and failure modes. Radio tracking would gather data and establish a position. Early in the program, optical tracking (with a Baker-Nunn camera network and human spotters) was added. A panel of scientists proposed changing the design to spheres, at least in diameter and hopefully . A sphere would have a constant optical reflection, and constant coefficient of drag, based on size alone, while a cone would vary with orientation. James Van Allen proposed a cylinder, which eventually flew. The Naval Research Lab finally accepted spheres as a &quot;test vehicle&quot;, with for follow-on satellites. The payload weight savings, from reduced size as well as decreased instrumentation in the early satellites, was considered acceptable for the initial launches. Afterwards, the later Vanguard rockets had some test instrumentation removed, lightening them enough for the 50.8 cm bodies.

== Post mission ==
After the scientific mission ended, both Vanguard 2 and the upper stage of the rocket used to launch the satellite became derelict objects that would continue to orbit Earth for many years. Both objects remain in orbit.
As Vanguard 1, Vanguard 2, and Vanguard 3 are still orbiting with their drag properties essentially unchanged, they form a baseline data set on the atmosphere of Earth that is over 60 years old and continuing. Vanguard 2 has an expected orbital lifetime of 300 years.

<text>Vanguard 3 (Harvard designation: 1959 Eta 1) is a scientific satellite that was launched into Earth orbit by the Vanguard SLV-7 on 18 September 1959, the third successful Vanguard launch out of eleven attempts. Vanguard rocket: Vanguard Satellite Launch Vehicle-7 (SLV-7) was an unused Vanguard TV-4BU (TV-4BU=Test Vehicle-Four BackUp) rocket, updated to the final production Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV).

Project Vanguard was a program managed by the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), and designed and built by the Glenn L. Martin Company (now Lockheed Martin), which intended to launch the first artificial satellite into Earth orbit using a Vanguard rocket. as the launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Vanguard 3 was an important part of the Space Race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

== Previous satellites ==
Before the 18 September 1959 successful launch of the satellite that became known as Vanguard 3, two other satellites that bore the name &quot;Vanguard 3&quot; were launched, but both launches ended in failures and the satellites did not reach orbit. The failed satellites were:

*Vanguard 3A, launched 13 April 1959 on a Vanguard SLV-5 rocket,
*Vanguard 3B, launched 22 June 1959 on a Vanguard SLV-6 rocket.

The successful satellite that became known as the Vanguard 3 was known as Vanguard 3C before launch.

== Spacecraft ==
The Vanguard 3 satellite was a diameter sphere with a conical boom on top. The lower three-fourths of the sphere was silicon monoxide-coated magnesium and the upper fourth and the conical extension were made of fiberglass (glass fiber phenolic resin). Mass of the satellite was approximately , the total mass of the orbiting spacecraft with the third stage casing attached was .

Power was provided by specially built Yardley Silvercels (AgZn chemical batteries) with non-magnetic lugs, designed to last approximately 3 months. The batteries were held in a pressurized can mounted in the lower two-thirds of the sphere. In its top center, the can also contained a smaller cylinder, which held the electronics for the X-ray, peak memory, temperature measurements, micrometeorite detector, and data encoder, above which was the 30 mW, 108.00 MHz Minitrack beacon transmitter. Another cylinder, mounted on top of the pressurized compartment, held the magnetometer instrumentation package, associated electronics, the command receiver and 80 mW, 108.03 MHz transmitter plus electronics providing burst telemetry for the magnetometer. A tape recorder was used to store data for playback during ground station passes. Four spring loaded aerials extended from the equator of the sphere at 90° intervals. A small solar cell and cadmium sulfide cell were also mounted on the sphere wall near the equator. The magnetometer sensor head was mounted at the end of the conical boom. The sphere was spin-stabilized and had passive thermal control. It had no engines for thrust or attitude control.

== Launch ==

Vanguard 3 was launched at 05:20:07 GMT (12:20:07 a.m. EST) on 18 September 1959 from the Eastern Test Range of the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral into a geocentric orbit. The satellite was then injected at 05:29:49 GMT into a 33.35° inclination Earth orbit with a perigee altitude of , apogee of , and an orbital period of 130.0 minutes. The third stage was purposely left attached to the satellite, in order to produce a long tumble period, to avoid corrections to the magnetometer that would be necessary with a rapidly rotating satellite. Perigee remained on the night side of Earth throughout the mission. All experiments functioned normally and the batteries lasted for 84 days, until 11 December 1959, at which time all communication with the spacecraft ceased. It was still tracked optically with telescopes for the atmospheric drag experiment.

== Mission objectives ==
The objectives of the flight were to measure the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, the solar X-ray radiation and its effects on the atmosphere of Earth, and the near-Earth micrometeoroid environment. Instrumentation included a proton magnetometer, X-ray ionization chambers, and various micrometeoroid detectors. The spacecraft was a of diameter magnesium sphere. The magnetometer was housed in a fiberglass/phenolic resin conical tube attached to the sphere. The data obtained provided a comprehensive survey of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field over the area covered, defined the lower edge of the Van Allen radiation belt, and provided a count of micrometeoroid impacts.

== Mission results ==
=== Proton Precessional Magnetometer ===
This experiment had a proton precessional magnetometer to measure the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field at altitudes ranging from to and at latitudes between ± 33.4°. The measurements were made on command as the spacecraft passed seven Minitrack stations in North and South America and one each in Australia and South Africa. When switched on by command, the polarization coil around the proton sample (normal hexane) was turned on for 2 seconds followed by a 2 seconds readout of the precession signal. Several readings were taken during each pass over a station. The experiment worked well during its 84 days active life, and approximately 4300 readings were recorded. The experiment is described in J. C. Cain et al., &quot;Measurements of the geomagnetic field by the Vanguard 3 satellite&quot;, NASA TN D-1418, Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, 1962, The overall accuracy of the field measurements was approximately 10 nT (gammas).

=== X-Ray Experiment ===
The objective of this experiment was to measure the X-ray emission from the Sun and its effects on the Atmosphere of Earth. The detectors were two identical ionization chambers sensitive to X-ray wavelengths produced in solar flares (2 to 8 Å, or 200 to 800 pm). The ionization chambers were located 120° apart in the equatorial plane of the satellite and received a maximum signal when an ion chamber tube &quot;looked&quot; toward the Sun. The instrumentation were designed to measure the 2 to 8 Å (200 to 800 pm) X-ray flux and record the peak solar flare intensity by means of a peak-reading memory device, during the daylight portion of each orbit. However, due to the overwhelming background radiation of the Van Allen Belts, its sensors were saturated, and no useful information on solar X-rays was gathered.

=== Micrometeorite Detector ===
This experiment contained two sealed pressure zones, extending along the interior walls of the satellite, which were designed to record the impact of micrometeorites large enough to pierce the satellite shell. These pressure zones were partial vacuums, each at a different pressure, and were protected by 0.66 mm magnesium walls that presented an exposed surface area of 0.162 m2, which was 20% of the area of the shell. A puncture in the walls of either zone was detected by a differential pressure gauge mounted between them, and telemetered as a change in the length of one of the telemetry channels. Erosion of the satellite shell through bombardment by space dust, micrometeorites, and other particles was recorded by three chromium-strip erosion gauges mounted on the satellite surface, and by a photosensitive detector. Electrical resistances of the gauges changed as their surfaces were changed by erosion. The photosensitive detector, a cadmium sulfide cell protected by an opaque covering of aluminized PET film, also showed a resistance change as the covering was eroded or penetrated. Erosion measurements also were telemetered as channel lengths, which permitted estimates of the erosion rates. Four barium titanate-type microphones recorded micrometeorite impacts on the satellite&#x27;s surface. The microphone output was amplified, shaped, and fed into a magnetic counter unit, which provided continuously, in three-decimal digits, the cumulative count of impacts. The unit counted up to 1000 and then reset to zero. The satellite recorded 6600 micrometeorite impacts during 66 days of operation, of which 2800 occurred during a 70 hours interval from 16 to 18 November 1959, almost certainly due to the Earth&#x27;s annual passage through debris from comet Tempel-Tuttle, which results in the Leonids meteor shower which peaks on the 17 November 1959. No penetrations or fractures were recorded in the sensors of the surface penetration experiment. Because the erosion sensors were not disrupted, no definite results could be drawn from that experiment.

=== Satellite Drag Atmospheric Density ===
Because of its symmetrical shape, Vanguard 3 was selected by the experimenters for use in determining upper atmospheric densities as a function of altitude, latitude, season, and solar activity. As the spacecraft continuously orbited, it would lag its predicted positions slightly, accumulating greater and greater delay due to drag of the residual atmosphere. By measuring the rate and timing of orbital shifts, the relevant atmosphere&#x27;s parameters could be back-calculated knowing the body&#x27;s drag properties. It was determined that atmospheric pressures, and thus drag and orbital decay, were higher than anticipated, as Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere tapered into space gradually.

This experiment was very much planned prior to launch. Initial Naval Research Laboratory proposals for Project Vanguard included conical satellite bodies; this eliminated the need for a separate fairing and ejection mechanisms, and their associated weight and failure modes. Radio tracking would gather data and establish a position. Early in the program, optical tracking (with a Baker-Nunn camera network and human spotters) was added. A panel of scientists proposed changing the design to spheres, at least in diameter and hopefully . A sphere would have a constant optical reflection, and constant coefficient of drag, based on size alone, while a cone would vary with orientation. James Van Allen proposed a cylinder, which eventually flew (Explorer 1). The Project Vanguard finally accepted and 50.8 cm satellites.

== Post mission ==
After the scientific mission ended with data transmission ceasing on 11 December 1959, after 84 days of operation, Vanguard 3 and two pieces of the upper stage of the rocket used to launch the satellite became derelict objects. Vanguard 3 remains in orbit. The pieces of the upper stage re-entered the atmosphere on 3 April 2014 and 4 February 2015. As Vanguard 1, Vanguard 2, and Vanguard 3 are still orbiting with their drag properties essentially unchanged, they form a baseline data set on the atmosphere of Earth that is over 60 years old and continuing. Vanguard 3 has an expected lifetime of 300 years.

<text>Isang Yun, or Yun I-sang (; 17 September 1917 – 3 November 1995), was a Korean-born composer who made his later career in West Germany.

== Early life and education ==
Yun was born in Sancheong (Sansei), Korea in 1917, the son of poet Yun Ki-hyon. His family moved to Tongyeong (Tōei) when he was three years old. He began to study violin at the age of 13 whereupon he composed his first melody. Despite his father&#x27;s opposition to pursuing a career in music, Yun began formal music training two years later with a violinist in a military band in Keijō (present day Seoul). Eventually his father relented once Yun agreed to enroll in a business school while continuing his musical studies. In 1935 Yun moved to Osaka where he studied cello, music theory, and composition briefly at the Osaka College of Music. He soon returned to Tongyeong where he composed a &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Song&quot; for voice and piano. In 1939 Yun traveled again to Japan, this time to Tokyo in order to study under Tomojiro Ikenouchi. When the Pacific War began in December 1941, he moved back to Korea where he participated in the Korean independence movement. He was arrested for these activities in 1943 and was imprisoned for two months. Yun was interned at Keijō Imperial University Hospital for complications resulting from tuberculosis when Korea was liberated from Japanese rule in August 1945.

After the war he did welfare work, establishing an orphanage for war orphans, and teaching music in Tongyeong and Busan. After the armistice ceasing hostilities in the Korean War in 1953, he began teaching at the Seoul National University. He received the Seoul City Culture Award in 1955, and traveled to Europe the following year to finish his musical studies.

At the Paris Conservatory (1956–57) he studied composition under Tony Aubin and Pierre Revel, and West Berlin (1957–59), and at the Musikhochschule Berlin (today the Berlin University of the Arts) under Boris Blacher, Josef Rufer, and Reinhard Schwarz-Schilling. In 1958 he attended the International Summer Courses of Contemporary Music in Darmstadt and began his career in Europe with premieres of his &quot;Music for Seven Instruments&quot; in Darmstadt and &quot;Five Pieces for Piano&quot; in Bilthoven. The premiere of his oratorio &quot;Om mani padme hum&quot; in Hanover 1965 and &quot;Réak&quot; in Donaueschingen (1966) gave him international renown. With &quot;Réak&quot; he introduced the sound idea of Korean ceremonial music () as well as imitations of the East Asian mouth organ saenghwang (Korean), sheng (Chinese) or shō (Japanese) into Western avant-garde music.

==Kidnapping==
From October 1959, Yun had been living in Krefeld, Freiburg im Breisgau and Cologne. With a grant from the Ford Foundation, he and his family settled in West Berlin in 1964. However, due to alleged acts of espionage, he was kidnapped by the South Korean secret service from West Berlin on 17 June 1967. Via Bonn he was taken to Seoul. In prison he was tortured, attempted suicide, forced to confess to espionage, threatened with the death sentence – and in the first instance sentenced to life imprisonment. A worldwide petition led by Guenter Freudenberg and Francis Travis was presented to the South Korean government, signed by approximately 200 artists, including Luigi Dallapiccola, Hans Werner Henze, Heinz Holliger, Mauricio Kagel, Herbert von Karajan, Joseph Keilberth, Otto Klemperer, György Ligeti, Arne Mellnäs, Per Nørgård, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Igor Stravinsky, and Bernd Alois Zimmermann. Yun was released on 23 February 1969, returning to West Berlin at the end of March. In 1971, he obtained German citizenship. He never returned to South Korea. From 1973 he began participating in the call for the democratization of South Korea and the reunification of the divided country.

==Teaching==
Yun taught composition at the Hochschule für Musik, Theater und Medien Hannover (1969–71) and at the Hochschule der Künste in West Berlin (1977–85).

Among his students are Kazuhisa Akita, Jolyon Brettingham Smith, In-Chan Choe, Conrado del Rosario, Raymond Deane, Francisco F. Feliciano, Masanori Fujita, Keith Gifford, Holger Groschopp, Toshio Hosokawa, Sukhi Kang, Chung-Gil Kim, Wolfgang Klingt, Erwin Koch-Raphael, Isao Matsushita, Masahiro Miwa, Hwang-Long Pan, Martin Christoph Redel, Byong-Dong Paik, Bernfried Pröve, Takehito Shimazu, Minako Tanahashi, Masaru Tanaka, Michail Travlos, Jürgen Voigt, and Michael Whticker.

After 1979 Yun returned several times to North Korea to introduce new Western composition techniques as well as his own music. In 1982, the first Isang Yun Festival took place in Pyongyang. In 1984, the Isang Yun Music Institute opened in Pyongyang, North Korea. An ensemble had been founded there under his name. Yun promoted the idea of a joint concert featuring musicians from both Koreas in Panmunjom, which failed in 1988, but South Korean artists could be invited to Pyongyang in 1990.

==Later life and death==
Two concerts with works of Isang Yun had been performed in Seoul (1982) by Heinz Holliger, Ursula Holliger, and Francis Travis, later by Roswitha Staege and Hans Zender. Yun was invited to attend a festival of his music in South Korea in 1994, but the trip was broken off after internal and external conflicts. 
Yun was told by South Korean officials that to return, he would have to submit a written confession of “repentance,” which he refused. On 3 November 1995, Yun died of pneumonia in Berlin. The International Isang Yun Society was founded in Berlin in February 1996.

Yun has often been criticized for his &quot;pro-North Korean activities&quot;, i.e. musical activities in North Korea, and his close ties with the Kim Il Sung regime. Oh Kil-nam has said that Yun persuaded him to relocate to North Korea with his family. When Oh&#x27;s wife Shin Suk-ja and her little daughters were imprisoned in Yodok camp, Yun helped them and took photos and a tape from North Korea to Berlin.

==Music==
Yun&#x27;s primary musical concern was the fusion of traditional Korean music through Western avant garde musical techniques. After experimenting with 12-tone techniques Yun developed his own musical personality beginning in his post-serialistic &quot;sound compositions&quot; of the early 1960s. Yun&#x27;s music employed techniques associated with traditional Korean music, such as glissandi, pizzicati, portamenti, vibrati, and above all a very rich vocabulary of ornaments. Essential is the presence of multiple-melodic lines, which Yun called &quot;Haupttöne&quot; (&quot;central&quot; or &quot;main tones&quot;).

Yun&#x27;s composition for symphonic forces started with &quot;sound compositions&quot;, i.e. of works in which homogeneous sound planes are articulated and elaborated: &quot;Bara&quot; (1960) until &quot;Overture&quot; (1973; rev. 1974). A period of discursively structured instrumental concertos followed, beginning with the Concerto for Violoncello and Orchestra (1975–76) and climaxing with the Violin Concerto No. 1 (1981). From 1982 until 1987 he wrote a cycle of five symphonies, which are interrelated, yet varied structurally. Striving for freedom and peace is above all Symphony V for high baritone and large orchestra (1987) with texts by Nelly Sachs. In 1984, he developed also a new, intimate &quot;tone&quot; in his chamber music.

At that time peace and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula was his political goal. His lifelong concern with his native country and culture was expressed in several of his compositions, including the orchestral piece &quot;Exemplum in Memoriam Kwangju&quot; (1981) which he composed in memory of the Gwangju massacre, &quot;Naui Dang, Naui Minjokiyo!&quot; (My Land, My People) for soli, chorus and orchestra (South Korean poets, 1987), and &quot;Angel in Flames&quot; (Engel in Flammen) for orchestra, with &quot;Epilogue&quot; for soprano, women&#x27;s choir and five instruments (1994). Otherwise Yun himself stated often that he was not a political composer but only following the voice of his conscience.

In both Europe and the United States, Yun developed a strong reputation as a composer of avant-garde music, assigned those signature elements of traditional Korean musical technique. The technical as well a stylistic difficulties of performing his very elaborate and ornamental music are considered formidable.

<text>Achille Valenciennes (9 August 1794 – 13 April 1865) was a French zoologist.

Valenciennes was born in Paris, and studied under Georges Cuvier. His study of parasitic worms in humans made an important contribution to the study of parasitology. He also carried out diverse systematic classifications, linking fossil and current species.

He worked with Cuvier on the 22-volume &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Poissons&quot; (Natural History of Fish) (1828–1848), carrying on alone after Cuvier died in 1832. In 1832, he succeeded Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville (1777–1850) as chair of &quot;Histoire naturelle des mollusques, des vers et des zoophytes&quot; at the Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle.

Early in his career, he was given the task of classifying animals described by Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859) during his travels in the American tropics (1799 to 1803), and a lasting friendship was established between the two men. He is the binomial authority for many species of fish, such as the bartail jawfish.

Working in the scientific field of herpetology, Valenciennes described two new species of reptiles.

The organ of Valenciennes, a part of the anatomy of a female of the genus &quot;Nautilus&quot;, the purpose of which remains unknown, is named after him.

A species of lizard, &quot;Anolis valencienni&quot;, is named after him.

<doc id="746403" wikidata="Q7318856" url="?curid=746403" title="Revolutionary Socialist Party (UK)">
<text>The Revolutionary Socialist Party, initially known as the International Socialist Labour Party, was a political party in Britain. Its origins were in the British Section of the International Socialist Labour Party, a De Leonist group, formed in 1912 following disputes within the Socialist Labour Party of Great Britain (SLP). It met under the name British Section of the International Socialist Labour Party between 1912 and 1937, standing municipal election candidates between 1919 and 1934 and general election candidates in 1918 and 1929, and Revolutionary Socialist Party between 1936 and 1941.

The party was mainly based in Edinburgh, where it had its office and most of the party members lived. Members were also present in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Yorkshire. The party published &quot;The Proletariat&quot; and later &quot;The British Revolutionary Socialist&quot;. Principal members included William Campbell Tait (the National Organiser from 1927) and Frank Maitland.

RSP took part in conferences of the London Bureau as an observer. The party approached the Independent Labour Party about a merger in 1937, but the ILP rejected it on the grounds that the RSP was under trotskyist influence. The RSP then began orienting itself towards the Fourth International and met with James P. Cannon of the Movement for the Fourth International.

The RSP was invited to and took part in the &#x27;National Conference of Bolshevik-Leninists&#x27;, held on 30 July – 31 July 1938. Through this conference, the RSP merged into the Revolutionary Socialist League. In September 1938 Tait travelled to Paris to participate in the founding conference of the Fourth International. Before long, however, the group parted with the International. In March 1939 it began to publish a paper called the &quot;Workers Weekly&quot;. Most of its members joined the Independent Labour Party during World War II.

<text>John Inigo Richards (1731– 18 December 1810) was a British landscapist who became one of the founding members of the Royal Academy in 1768, and was secretary to the Academy from 1788 until his death.

==Life==
He studied art at the St Martin&#x27;s Lane Academy in London, where he was a pupil of George Lambert (1700–1765), sometimes regarded as the &quot;Father of English Landscape Oil Painting&quot;.

Like his contemporary Francis Hayman, Richards worked as a scene painter in London&#x27;s theatres (1777–1803). He retained a lifelong interest in theatre design. He is credited with the design of the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. (America&#x27;s first purpose-built professional theatre, opening in 1793), built for his brother-in-law Thomas Wignell.

When Richards died in 1810 he acknowledged that Mary Ann Ritchards who had been born to the actress Ann Pitt in 1759 was his daughter. He left her a snuff box which was decorated with a picture of her mother and his former lover.

<text>Lindsay Corine Taylor (born May 20, 1981) is an American former professional basketball player. She played in the WNBA, KBSL, LFB, WKBL, Polish Women&#x27;s League, WCBA, and Angola Women&#x27;s Basketball League. A very experienced player, she also played professionally overseas in 13 basketball seasons. Standing tall she usually played the center position (normally the tallest player on the team).

Taylor attended Chandler High School and was a Chandler HS state champion in 1999. She attended University of California, Santa Barbara in 1999 and was the 2001 Big West Freshman and Player of the Year. Taylor is Santa Barbara&#x27;s all-time leading point scorer, blocker and most accurate shooter.
Taylor was awarded the Silver Medal as a member of the United States 2003 Pan American Games basketball team and was considered the best player in the team. She was instrumental in securing the Gauchos four straight Big West Conference women&#x27;s Championships victories from 2001–2004, and almost single-handedly took the team to the 2004 Sweet Sixteen – the furthest the team had ever advanced in the NCAA tournament. In April 2014, she was elected to UC Santa Barbara Hall of Fame.

Graduating from Santa Barbara in 2004, she was one of the highly regarded rookies for the 2004 WNBA draft and was chosen by the Houston Comets and later traded to the Phoenix Mercury. She was the second-round (26th pick overall) in the 2004 WNBA Draft. In total Taylor signed with four WNBA teams: the Houston Comets, Phoenix Mercury, Seattle Storm (twice) and the Washington Mystics.

In addition to her WNBA career, Taylor enjoyed great success playing overseas in Europe and Asia, especially in the Women&#x27;s Chinese Basketball Association (WCBA). and the Polish Women&#x27;s League. Taylor finished her first season in the Polish Women&#x27;s League with the highest number of points scored, and her overall evaluation was the highest in the league. She was also awarded Center of the Year and earned a place on the 1st Team, All-Imports Team and the All-Defensive Team. She also received the All-Chinese WCBA 1st Team award in 2011.

After retiring from professional basketball in 2015 Taylor serves as an assistant basketball coach at Hamilton High School. She is currently in her sixth season with Hamilton.

==Early life==
Lindsay Corine Taylor was born on May 20, 1981, in Poway, California, the daughter of Catherine and Bill Taylor. Her family later moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Taylor came from a family of above-average height and claims she inherited her great height from her father who is . Her uncle, Ron (died November 2019), stood and was nicknamed &quot;Tiny&quot;. She has an older sister, Roz, and a younger brother who unlike Lindsay, are just a little above average height. Her grandmother, Helen Taylor (died September 2006), regularly wrote articles on the internet about Lindsay during her time playing for the UCSB Gauchos.

Taylor was not involved in sports until she was fifteen. She had originally planned on playing in her school&#x27;s marching band, but her closest friends, who played basketball, convinced her to start playing the game. She said she &quot;picked it up naturally&quot;. She said that if it were not for basketball, her desires might have led her to a different career.

==High school career==
Taylor attended Chandler High School in Chandler, Arizona. In her first high school basketball game, she accidentally scored for the opposite team.

She helped lead her team to two regional championships, and as a senior, she helped lead them to the Arizona State Championship. She averaged 19.2 points, 11.0 rebounds and 3.1 blocks in her final year as a prepster. During a game in her junior year, she scored a career-best 31 points and grabbed 21 rebounds. She played for the AAU Arizona Elite, where she guided the team to the 17-Gold National Championship in 1998 at the age of 17. She became a Chandler HS state champion in 1999.

==College career==
Taylor later became famous during her NCAA career at UC Santa Barbara, playing center for the women&#x27;s basketball team. She was (and still is) the tallest women&#x27;s basketball player in the school&#x27;s history, and she attended the same classes as fellow WNBA players Kayte Christensen and Kristen Mann.
After initially redshirting her first year (1999–2000) Taylor played center for the women&#x27;s basketball team UC Santa Barbara Gaucho. In 2000–01, Taylor capped an impressive rookie season by earning the 2001 Big West Freshman of the Year award, second team all-conference and All-Big West tournament honors. She was twice named Big West&#x27;s Player of the Week: January 15 and January 29. Taylor scored 20 or more points three times, with her career high of 24 coming against Boise State on January 21, 2001. Her field goal percentage in Big West Play of 65.0% was the highest percentage in the conference, and she later had 17 double-digit performances, including nine of her last 11 games and 13 of her final 16. It was during her second season at Santa Barbara that Taylor grew her final inch, something she was unaware of until she was measured later on, reaching her full and trademark height of 6 ft 8 inches. She was also selected as Big West Freshman of the Year.

In 2001–02, she earned her second Big West All Conference Honors. She missed two games – vs. Northridge (Jan. 6, 2002) and Fullerton (Feb. 6, 2002) because of soreness in her lower back. Her third season (2002–03) was capped by an honorable mention Associated Press All-American recognition, Big West Player of the Year honors and her second consecutive conference tournament MVP award. She also delivered 28 consecutive free-throws during her 2002–03 campaign.

During Taylor&#x27;s senior year (2003–04), her UCSB Gaucho squad received their 8th consecutive Big West Conference Title with a 27–7 record and won the Big West tournament, in which Taylor won her third consecutive MVP award. The Gauchos upset Colorado and Houston to get to the NCAA Sweet 16 until losing to defending champion Connecticut, which had fellow WNBA teammate Diana Taurasi. She notched her 1,000th point as a Gaucho at Illinois on February 13, 2003, and moved her score into 13th place on UCSB&#x27;s career scoring list. She only needed 500 points to break the school&#x27;s highest-ever career scoring record, held by Kristi Rohr.

On November 20, 2003, Taylor scored a team-high of 12 points. She was the only Gaucho player to be in double-figures and the only visiting player to make half her field goal tries, sinking four out of eight.

On November 25, 2003, she scored a game-high of 23 points and became UCSB&#x27;s record holder in career blocked shots and the school&#x27;s all-time leader in career blocked shots with 181 points. On November 28, she scored a game-high 20 points as the Gauchos won. Taylor scored seven of her 20 points during the 19–4 second half run and extended the then nation&#x27;s second longest home winning streak to 27 straight games. Later on December 16 she led all Gaucho players with a game high 23 points, grabbed a career-high 16 rebounds and also matching her personal best of six blocked shots. On December 28 Taylor finished with 14 points and 11 rebounds for her third consecutive double-double and 19th of her collegiate career.

Taylor said one of her biggest developments in college was to build her strength up. Despite pulling down 7.3 rebounds per game, she counted rebounding as a weakness of hers and would continue to work hard on it to improve.

Taylor graduated from Santa Barbara in 2004. Her collegiate career held many distinctions at the time, such as the all-time leader in points: 1,755, most blocked shots: 242, and field goal percentage: 55.8%, in UC Santa Barbara history. Taylor has been Santa Barbara&#x27;s all-time leading point scorer, blocker and most accurate shooter.

In April 2014, she was elected to UC Santa Barbara Hall of Fame.

==WNBA career==

===First season (2004–2005)===
Taylor was one of the highly regarded rookies for the 2004 WNBA draft. At age 22 she was chosen by the Houston Comets. She was subsequently traded to Phoenix Mercury alongside the higher-regarded Diana Taurasi. She was a second-round pick (26th overall) in the 2004 WNBA Draft.

Her first game was against the Seattle Storm, on May 8, 2004. Prior to the game, Taylor was told &quot;there was a chance&quot; she&#x27;d see some action. She got a rousing ovation when she came off the bench for a few minutes in the first half. Her family also attended the game, and were right there to watch her get her first taste of pro competition. She attempted one field goal, which she missed. On May 10, the Mercury played the Sacramento Monarchs. She attempted rebounds against Chantelle Anderson and Maren Walseth. Taylor was injured later on. Despite the injury she recovered enough to play against the Sacramento Monarchs on June 27 when she performed a career-high. Eighteen minutes into the game she grabbed two rebounds and scored three points on a 3-point basket late in the game and blocked four shots in 17 minutes. The game ended, 83–44, a Phoenix victory.

Taylor remained on the injured list for the rest of the season, but was expected to return later in her inaugural WNBA season. In total, she would appear in just five games and miss over twenty other matches during the 2004 season, seeing limited action in those games before being waived at the end of 2005 training camp.

===Second season (2006)===
On April 13, 2006, the Seattle Storm signed Taylor to a training camp contract. Upon joining her new team she immediately became the team&#x27;s tallest player, adding an extra three inches over then-tallest teammate Lauren Jackson. Taylor also holds the distinction of being the only player on the Storm team as tall as then-head coach Anne Donovan, who, also at 6 feet 8 inches, a fact acknowledged by Donovan when the two allegedly stood eye-to-eye and she remarked about Taylor, &quot;She is legit.&quot;

Donovan praised Taylor&#x27;s skills and favorably compared her to fellow WNBA player Kara Wolters, whom Donovan had personally tutored. Taylor spoke enthusiastically about joining her new team and what it could mean for her and improving her abilities. She expressed admiration for Lauren Jackson, said she could learn from her, and Taylor also looked forward to the training she could expect to receive from Donovan.

Despite Donovan&#x27;s praise, however, on May 17 Taylor was released by the Storm, just a little over a month after she signed. She was the team&#x27;s last cut before rosters were finalized. An Achilles tendinitis in her right ankle had prevented Taylor from taking full advantage of her invitation to training camp. In all, she only played in only two preseason games, one on May 7 and the other on the 12th, five days before her release, averaging 7.0 points and 3.5 rebounds on a 3-point basket late in the game. She missed an exhibition finale against the Minnesota Lynx and spent several other games on the injured list because of her tendinitis in her foot.

===Third season (2008)===

During her time in the Polish Women&#x27;s League, Taylor expressed her desire to return and compete in the WNBA, and on April 17, 2008, she signed a training camp contract with the Washington Mystics Taylor&#x27;s selection on the team was considered unusual for a team noted for its average-sized post players and fast-paced style of play and gave the Mystics a completely different look. She began attending training camp for the Washington Mystics soon afterwards on April 20 at Trinity University in Washington D.C.

During her training camp trials, Taylor competed in three pre-season games. The first game, played in Tampa, Florida, against the Sacramento Monarchs, ended in a victory for the Washington Mystics with a score of 90–82. The second game was another Washington victory played in New York against New York Liberty ending 58–52. She enjoyed further victory against the Houston Comets with a 72–66 victory.

The Mystics officially announced that Taylor had successfully secured a place on the Washington Mystics roster on May 14 and she would be spending the upcoming summer playing on the team. She did not compete in the Mystics&#x27; season opener against the Indiana Fever. Her absence was noted in the game as it was the only loss suffered by the Mystics. On May 21 Mystics&#x27; manager Linda Hargrove announced the team would waive Taylor in exchange for the higher-regarded Crystal Smith, despite Smith still recovering from a foot injury at the time. Her release coincided with her fellow UC Santa Barbara graduate and friend Kayte Christensen&#x27;s release from the Chicago Sky. On May 28, 2008, Taylor and her father Bill were special guests of the Mystics for the Washington vs Phoenix Mercury game in Phoenix, Arizona.

==International career==
Taylor played basketball in numerous countries. She enjoyed great success playing overseas in Europe and Asia, especially in the Women&#x27;s Chinese Basketball Association (WCBA). and the Polish Women&#x27;s League, where she was known by the sobriquet &quot;Lindska&quot; and achieved a level of recognition comparable to that of Lisa Leslie in the WNBA, Taylor won a silver medal as a member of the United States 2003 Pan American Games basketball team with fellow Guacho, Kristen Mann when they played off in the Dominican Republic against the home team. She was considered the best player in the game and her finest effort in the tournament was six-point, four-rebound performance in quarterfinal victory over their hosts the Dominicans.

=== Turkey (2005–2006) ===
Taylor spent the WNBA 2005–06 offseason in Turkey, where she averaged 16.5 points and 10.3 rebounds per game for her new team, the Botașspor Adana (or Botaș as it was known for short). On February 8, 2006, Taylor and her team beat the Burhaniye, at home. She did not score in the first half, but she later scored 15 points in the second half. She ended up with 16 rebounds altogether. On February 18 Taylor and her team lost to Ceyhan with the scores 90–70. However, later on March 12, Botaș beat their rivals, Mersin, 81–71, in their home town. Taylor had a solid double during the game with 22 points and 12 rebounds. On April 1, she had 20 points and 12 rebounds as Botaș won, 83–59, over their opponent, the Erdemir Spor.

==Legacy==
Taylor is in height, making her one of the tallest female athletes in the world. Taylor is the tallest player in the history of Chandler High School women&#x27;s basketball and UC Santa Barbara women&#x27;s basketball program, and she has been among the tallest ever to play in the WNBA. Only the late Margo Dydek, at , Han Xu at , Bernadett Határ, at , and both Brittney Griner and Liz Cambage at are taller. Taylor had quipped that because of her larger stature than other players she had what she described as &quot;a bird&#x27;s eye view of everything&quot; on the court. Literally she could see over other players.

Taylor received criticism and praise. She also received potential doubts raised over her ability to be an effective center; the &quot;Washington Post&quot; criticized her and commented that she &quot;cannot control her size&quot; and that she often ended up &quot;blocking her own players&quot; in practice. In its analysis of the prospected centers in the 2004 WNBA Draft, the Seattle Storm criticized Taylor: &quot;As long as Taylor could tie her shoes and walk without tripping on her own feet, she&#x27;d be a WNBA prospect.&quot; It also felt, she had not been an effective dominating force at UC Santa Barbara despite her great height and facing what it considered relatively weak Big West competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.wnba.com/storm/news&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Her former coach, Mark French, once said Taylor &quot;has unlimited potential on the court&quot; and called her &quot;one of the fastest learners&quot;. He went on to say that she made the game look easier than most girls her size.

==Personal life==

Taylor expressed interest in potentially teaching school after her basketball career was over and she has also expressed an interest in government and politics. She also majored in religious studies. Off the court, Taylor has been known for her unassuming ways and sense of humor.

Taylor claimed that there isn&#x27;t a lot of advantages to being so tall, &quot;only than you can use the top shelf in your cupboard without any problems.&quot; and she felt the biggest advantages are in sports where her prestigious height have afforded her advantages. She stated, &quot;I feel I have a presence on the court. I hope I intimidate other people.&quot; Another advantage Taylor possessed, as she expressed, is what she described as her &quot;bird&#x27;s eye view of everything&quot; on the court. Taylor&#x27;s height also made it difficult for other players to guard and block her and are generally unable to overpower her.

She has found shopping and the facilities of countries like Poland, such as toilets and baths, bothersome because they are not adequately suited for her height but did not experience the same problem in the US. She has objected to being labeled lanky, but preferred to being called &#x27;slender&#x27; instead.

<doc id="746421" wikidata="Q7791090" url="?curid=746421" title="Thomas J. Kelly (aerospace engineer)">
<text>Thomas Joseph Kelly (June 14, 1929March 23, 2002) was an American aerospace engineer. Kelly primarily worked on the Apollo Lunar Module, which earned him the name of &quot;Father of the Lunar Module&quot; from NASA.

Kelly graduated from Cornell University in 1951, where he was a member of the Quill and Dagger society. Afterwards, Kelly obtained his MS degree from Columbia University and Ph.D. from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn.

Kelly was the project engineer, engineering manager and deputy program manager for Grumman Aircraft&#x27;s Apollo Lunar Module (1962–1970). His 2001 book &quot;Moon Lander: How We Developed the Apollo Lunar Module&quot; documents the process of designing, building and flying the Lunar Module.
Kelly was portrayed by Matt Craven in the 1998 miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Kelly was born on June 14, 1929, in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Merrick, New York. He attended Wellington C. Mepham High School. While attending, Kelly was remembered by his genial nature, impish smile, playing the trumpet, and his ability to &quot;ace&quot; all his tests. In his local middle-class neighborhood parents would compare their children&#x27;s performance to how well Tom Kelly performed. &quot;Tom would never get a C, study harder.&quot; Even with all of his brilliance, he not once showed arrogance and was still a very likeable and popular child at what is now called Camp Avenue school in North Merrick. He eventually graduated Mepham with valedictorian.

In 1946, Kelly attended Cornell University under a Grumman scholarship. During this time he worked his summers at Grumman, eventually earning himself a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering and a Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps commission in 1951. Kelly later earned a master&#x27;s degree from Columbia University and a Ph.D. from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn.

==Career==

===Grumman===
Kelly started working at Grumman as a propulsion engineer working under the Rigel Missile Program from 1951 to 1953. After this project, he was moved to the F-11 Tiger program and later promoted to group leader.

===Air Force===
In 1956, Kelly was called into active duty and was stationed at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. During his duty, Kelly was a performance engineer on the B-58 Hustler, F-105 Thunderchief, and the AGM-28 Hound Dog. After two years of service, he was discharged in 1958.

===Lockheed===
For a short time, Kelly worked at Lockheed Corporation on their missile and space division. Kelly was the group leader of the rocket propulsion development engineering. He stayed here until 1959.

===Return to Grumman===
Kelly was drawn back to Grumman, in which he took up the position of assistant chief in propulsion from 1959 to 1960.

He was then moved to Grumman&#x27;s Apollo and Lunar Module proposals. During this time Kelly helped develop the lunar orbit rendezvous concept.

In late 1962, Grumman won the $2-billion government contract from NASA. Kelly was promoted to lead the design team for the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM). He was in charge of more than 7,000 employees in design and building the Lunar Module. Kelly&#x27;s group came up with the idea of a two-stage spacecraft (ascent &amp; descent stage), that would take two astronauts to the Moon&#x27;s surface while a third astronaut would stay in lunar orbit.

Kelly had just turned 40 when Neil Armstrong took his first historic step on the Moon July 20, 1969. During the landing, ice had formed in a fuel line, clogging it. If the heat from the engine defrosted the clog, the fuel could detonate. Luckily for Kelly and the Grumman crew, the problem corrected itself and the crew was able to relax and realize what they had accomplished. In an interview in 1998 Kelly stated, &quot;It was the greatest thing in my career. And, in hindsight, it was even more significant than we thought at the time.&quot; However, the experience was not without strain and stress, manifested in a nervous tic he developed during the project.

In all, Grumman built fifteen lunar modules, but only six of them had the opportunity to land on the Moon&#x27;s surface. Each one of these modules had significant upgrades compared to the last one. The Lunar Module is among the most significant accomplishments of Kelly&#x27;s career, as it is still the only spacecraft that humans have used to land on another celestial body.

==Retirement==
Kelly retired from Grumman in 1992 after spending 38 years with the company. Soon after his retirement, Grumman merged with Northrop to form Northrop Grumman Corporation and dispersed its operations from Long Island.

In the year 2000&#x27;s Long Island: Our Past poll, Kelly was selected as the fourth favorite person from Long Island&#x27;s history. He followed behind Robert Moses, Theodore Roosevelt and William Levitt.

<doc id="746422" wikidata="Q910958" url="?curid=746422" title="Mustard oil">
<text>Mustard oil can mean either the pressed oil used for cooking or a pungent essential oil also known as the volatile oil of mustard. The essential oil results from grinding mustard seed, mixing the grounds with water, and isolating the resulting volatile oil by distillation. It can also be produced by dry distillation of the seed. Pressed mustard oil is used as cooking oil in some cultures, but sale is restricted in some countries due to high levels of erucic acid. Varieties of mustard seeds low in erucic acid have been cultivated.

==History==
Mustard oil was likely produced in the ancient Jewish town of Huqoq, in modern-day Israel. This is suggested by distinctive agricultural features found there, such as semi-circular wine vats with steep slopes and lower troughs. Scholars believe these structures, dating to Roman or Byzantine times, were used to crush mustard pods to make oil. Mustard production in Huqoq is also documented in the Jerusalem Talmud.

==Pressed oil==

Oil makes up about 30% of mustard seeds. It can be produced from black mustard (&quot;Brassica nigra&quot;), brown mustard (&quot;B. juncea&quot;), and white mustard (&quot;B. alba&quot;).

===Culinary use===
Having a distinctive pungent taste, the use of the oil is a feature of predominantly Assamese, Bengali, Nepalese and North Indian cooking, as well as Bangladeshi cuisine. It is sometimes used as a substitute for ghee.

===Chemical composition===
Its pungent flavor is due to allyl isothiocyanate, a phytochemical of plants in the mustard family, Brassicaceae (for example, cabbage, horseradish or wasabi). 

Mustard oil has about 60% monounsaturated fatty acids (42% erucic acid and 12% oleic acid); it has about 21% polyunsaturated fats (6% the omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid and 15% the omega-6 linoleic acid), and it has about 12% saturated fats.

===Erucic acid in canola oil===

Mustard oil can have up to 44% erucic acid a component of canola oil, which is deemed as a safe food ingredient for human consumption when the erucic acid level does not exceed 2% of the total fatty acids and the canola oil is pure.

===Regulation===
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration prohibits the import or sale of expressed mustard oil in the U.S. for use in cooking due to its high erucic acid content. By contrast, the FDA classifies essential mustard oil, which has a much lower erucic acid content, as generally recognized as safe, and allows its use in food. Expressed mustard oil is permitted in the U.S. as a massage oil, with a required &quot;for external use only&quot; label.

==Nutrition==
Mustard oil (per 100 g) contains 884 calories of food energy and is 100% fat. The fat composition is 11% saturated fat, 59% monounsaturated fat, and 21% polyunsaturated fat.

==Essential oil==

The pungency of the condiment mustard results when ground mustard seeds are mixed with water, vinegar, or other liquid (or even when chewed). Under these conditions, a chemical reaction between the enzyme myrosinase and a glucosinolate known as sinigrin from the seeds of black mustard (&quot;Brassica nigra&quot;) or brown Indian mustard (&quot;Brassica juncea&quot;) produces allyl isothiocyanate. By distillation one can produce a very sharp-tasting essential oil, sometimes called &quot;volatile oil of mustard&quot;, containing more than 92% allyl isothiocyanate. The pungency of allyl isothiocyanate is due to the activation of the TRPA1 ion channel in sensory neurons. White mustard (&quot;Brassica hirta&quot;) does not yield &quot;allyl&quot; isothiocyanate, but the milder 4-Hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate degraded from sinalbin rather than sinigrin.

Allyl isothiocyanate serves the plant as a defense against herbivores. Since it is harmful to the plant, it is stored in the harmless form of a glucosinolate, separate from the enzyme myrosinase. Once the herbivore chews the plant, the noxious allyl isothiocyanate is produced. Allyl isothiocyanate is also responsible for the pungent taste of horseradish and wasabi. It can be produced synthetically, sometimes known as &quot;synthetic mustard oil&quot;.

<text>David Orlin Hestenes (born May 21, 1933) is a theoretical physicist and science educator. He is best known as chief architect of geometric algebra as a unified language for mathematics and physics, and as founder of Modelling Instruction, a research-based program to reform K–12 Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education.

For more than 30 years, he was employed in the Department of Physics and Astronomy of Arizona State University (ASU), where he retired with the rank of research professor and is now emeritus.

==Life and career==
===Education and doctorate degree===
David Orlin Hestenes (eldest son of mathematician Magnus Hestenes) was born 1933 in Chicago, Illinois. Beginning college as a pre-medical major at UCLA from 1950 to 1952, he graduated from Pacific Lutheran University in 1954 with degrees in philosophy and speech. After serving in the U.S. Army from 1954 to 1956, he entered UCLA as an unclassified graduate student, completed a physics M.A. in 1958 and won a University Fellowship. His mentor at UCLA was the physicist Robert Finkelstein, who was working on unified field theories at that time. A serendipitous encounter with lecture notes by mathematician Marcel Riesz inspired Hestenes to study a geometric interpretation of Dirac matrices. He obtained his Ph.D. from UCLA with a thesis entitled &quot;Geometric Calculus and Elementary Particles&quot;. Shortly thereafter he recognized that the Dirac algebras and Pauli matrices could be unified in matrix-free form by a device later called a spacetime split. Then he revised his thesis and published it in 1966 as a book, &quot;Space–Time Algebra&quot;, now referred to as spacetime algebra (STA). This was the first major step in developing a unified, coordinate-free geometric algebra and calculus for all of physics.

===Postdoctorate research and career===
From 1964 to 1966, Hestenes was an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton with John Archibald Wheeler. In 1966 he joined the physics department at Arizona State University, rising to full professor in 1976 and retiring in 2000 to &quot;Emeritus Professor of Physics&quot;.

In 1980 and 1981 as a &quot;NASA Faculty Fellow&quot; and in 1983 as a &quot;NASA Consultant&quot; he worked at Jet Propulsion Laboratory on orbital mechanics and attitude control, where he applied geometric algebra in development of new mathematical techniques published in a textbook/monograph &quot;New Foundations for Classical Mechanics&quot;.

In 1983 he joined with entrepreneur Robert Hecht-Nielsen and psychologist Peter Richard Killeen in conducting the first ever conference devoted exclusively to neural network modeling of the brain. In 1987, he became the first visiting scholar in the Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems (Boston University) and worked on neuroscience research for a period.

Hestenes has been a principal investigator for NSF grants seeking to teach physics through modeling and to measure student understanding of physics models at both the high school and university levels.

==Work==
Hestenes has worked in mathematical and theoretical physics, geometric algebra, neural networks, and cognitive research in science education. He is the prime mover behind the contemporary resurgence of interest in geometric algebras and in other offshoots of Clifford algebras as ways of formalizing theoretical physics.

===Geometric algebra and calculus===
Spacetime algebra provided the starting point for two main lines of research: on its implications for quantum mechanics specifically and for mathematical physics generally.

The first line began with the fact that reformulation of the Dirac equation in terms of spacetime algebra reveals hidden geometric structure. Among other things, it reveals that the complex factor formula_1 in the equation is a geometric quantity (a bivector) identified with electron spin, where formula_2 specifies the spin direction and formula_3 is the spin magnitude. The implications of this insight have been studied in a long series of papers with the most significant conclusion linking it to Schrödinger&#x27;s zitterbewegung and proposing a zitterbewegung interpretation of quantum mechanics. Research in this direction is still active.

The second line of research was dedicated to extending geometric algebra to a self-contained geometric calculus for use in theoretical physics. Its culmination is the book &quot;Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus&quot; which follows an approach to differential geometry that uses the shape tensor (second fundamental form). Innovations in the book include the concepts of vector manifold, differential outermorphism, vector derivative that enables coordinate-free calculus on manifolds, and an extension of the Cauchy integral theorem to higher dimensions.

Hestenes emphasizes the important role of the mathematician Hermann Grassmann for the development of geometric algebra, with William Kingdon Clifford building on Grassmann&#x27;s work. Hestenes is adamant about calling this mathematical approach “geometric algebra” and its extension “geometric calculus,” rather than referring to it as “Clifford algebra”. He emphasizes the universality of this approach, the foundations of which were laid by both Grassmann and Clifford. He points out that contributions were made by many individuals, and Clifford himself used the term “geometric algebra” which reflects the fact that this approach can be understood as a mathematical formulation of geometry, whereas, so Hestenes asserts, the term “Clifford algebra” is often regarded as simply “just one more algebra among many other algebras”, which withdraws attention from its role as a unified language for mathematics and physics.

Hestenes&#x27; work has been applied to Lagrangian field theory, formulation of a gauge theory of gravity alternative to general relativity by Lasenby, Doran and Gull, which they call gauge theory gravity (GTG), and it has been applied to spin representations of Lie groups. Most recently, it led Hestenes to formulate conformal geometric algebra, a new approach to computational geometry. This has found a rapidly increasing number of applications in engineering and computer science.

He has contributed to the main conferences in this field, the International Conference on Clifford Algebras (ICCA) and the Applications of Geometric Algebra in Computer Science and Engineering (AGACSE) series.

===Modeling theory and instruction===
Since 1980, Hestenes has been developing a &quot;Modeling Theory&quot; of science and cognition, especially to guide the design of science instruction. The theory distinguishes sharply between conceptual models that constitute the content core of science and the mental models that are essential to understand them. &quot;Modeling Instruction&quot; is designed to engage students in all aspects of modeling, broadly conceived as constructing, testing, analyzing and applying scientific models. To assess the effectiveness of &quot;Modeling Instruction&quot;, Hestenes and his students developed the &quot;Force Concept Inventory&quot;, a concept inventory tool for evaluating student understanding of introductory physics.

After a decade of education research to develop and validate the approach, Hestenes was awarded grants from the National Science Foundation for another decade to spread the &quot;Modeling Instruction Program&quot; nationwide. As of 2011, more than 4000 teachers had participated in summer workshops on modeling, including nearly 10% of the United States&#x27; high school physics teachers. It is estimated that &quot;Modeling&quot; teachers reach more than 100,000 students each year.

One outcome of the program is that the teachers created their own non-profit organization, the &quot;American Modeling Teachers Association&quot; (AMTA), to continue and expand the mission after government funding terminated. The AMTA has expanded to a nationwide community of teachers dedicated to addressing the nation&#x27;s Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education crisis. Another outcome of the Modeling Program was creation of a graduate program at Arizona State University for sustained professional development of STEM teachers. This provides a validated model for similar programs at universities across the country.

===Science Invents, LLC propulsion project controversy===

On August 30, 2023, Hestenes was named in a United States District Court case in Utah filed by several venture capitalists claiming he endorsed and participated in a Ponzi scheme related to a discredited anti-gravity propulsion technology that was being marketed by Science Invents, LLC in Salt Lake City, Utah, a company owned by Joe Firmage, the former founder of USWeb. He was alleged to have taken over $100,000 in kickbacks from Firmage and other principals involved in the scheme and for recruiting investors into this scheme. The suit alleges Firmage and others falsely claimed the propulsion technology had been endorsed by the Department of Defense and was funded by them, and also claimed Hestenes had endorsed the validity of the science underlying the technology, a claim which Hestenes has adamantly denied. In total, the Ponzi scheme allegedly defrauded investors of $25,000,000 over a 10 year period. A default judgment was entered by the court on December 26, 2023 against the defendants.

<doc id="746426" wikidata="Q14935638" url="?curid=746426" title="New Town, Tasmania">
<text>New Town is a suburb of the city of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, about north of the central business district of Hobart. It is generally considered Hobart&#x27;s oldest suburb, settled just a week after Sullivans Cove. It was historically the home of many of Hobart&#x27;s wealthiest citizens, and New Town features a large number of grand residences, churches, and public buildings. The large farms were broken up following the world wars and it is now an inner city residential suburb. Many of its streets are lined with Federation style cottages. It is surrounded by the suburbs of North Hobart, Mount Stuart, Lenah Valley and Moonah, with the Queen&#x27;s Domain just to the south-east. Most of the locality is within the Hobart local government area, with 2.5% within Glenorchy.

==History==
At the time of Hobart&#x27;s re-settlement on the western shore of the Derwent River in 1804, the first free settlers were landed at New Town Bay a day after the military and convict landing on Hunter Island on 20/21 February. Some early buildings remain including Pitt Farm which is the second oldest farmhouse in Australia.

St John&#x27;s Anglican Church in New Town has an unbroken record of use as a parish church, from the first service on 20 December 1835 up to the present. The building was designed by the Tasmanian government civil engineer and architect, John Lee Archer.

New Town Post Office opened on 1 January 1842.

Video City opened the largest video rental shop in Australia on New Town Road in 2002. The store remained a vibrant cultural institution long after the arrival of online streaming services in the 2010s. After selling its catalogue of over 30,000 video titles, the store ceased trading in 2019.

==Today==
New Town has the only two single-sex public schools in Tasmania - Ogilvie High School for girls, and New Town High School for boys. There is also a third main school in New Town, the Catholic Sacred Heart College, New Town Campus, with over 1000 students. New Town Primary School is over a hundred years old. The major shopping centre is Centro New Town Plaza, which houses a Kmart, a Coles Supermarket and several smaller specialty shops.

New Town is well known for its leafy streets flanked by Colonial, Georgian, Federation, Italianate and Art Deco residences, with many large homes and mansions scattered throughout the suburb. Architects who have worked on New Town homes include Thomas Reibey Atkinson, grandson of Mary Reibey, and Henry Hunter, one of Hobart&#x27;s most prominent early colonial architects.

The InterCity Cycleway passes directly through the suburb, on its course from Claremont to the city.

The main road in New Town is known as &quot;New Town Road&quot; and follows on from Elizabeth Street in Hobart. The road connects Hobart with the neighbouring city of Glenorchy. Other main roads in New Town are Augusta Road, which leads into Lenah Valley, and Giblin Street which becomes Forster Street and then becomes Risdon Road as it continues down towards the Brooker Highway.

<text>Paul Sandby (1731 – 7 November 1809) was an English map-maker turned landscape painter in watercolours, who, along with his older brother Thomas, became one of the founding members of the Royal Academy in 1768.

==Life and work==
Paul Sandby was born in Nottingham, and baptised there in 1731, although his date of birth has traditionally been given as 1725. In 1745 he moved to London where he followed his brother Thomas in obtaining an appointment in the military drawing department at the Tower of London.

While undertaking this commission, which included preparing designs for new bridges and fortifications, he began producing watercolour landscapes documenting the changes in Scotland since the rebellion, and making sketches of Scottish events such as the hanging in Edinburgh of soldier-turned-forger John Young in 1751. When in Edinburgh, he started sketching and drawing the landscapes of the city and was said to have to carried a copy of &quot;Theatrum Scotia&quot; in his pockets. One such sketching in the form of engraving, West View of the City of Edinburgh, is now displayed in the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art.

He left his post with the survey in 1751, and spent some time living with his brother, who had been appointed Deputy Ranger of Windsor Great Park. There he assisted his brother, and made a series of drawings of the castle, the town, and its neighborhood, which were purchased by Sir Joseph Banks. His skills were applauded by fellow artists such as Thomas Gainsborough: if one wanted &quot;real Views from Nature in this Country&quot;, declared Gainsborough in 1764, there was no better artist than Sandby, who frequently &quot;employed his pencil that way.&quot;

He also etched a large number of plates after his own drawings, a hundred of which (including views of Edinburgh) were published in a volume in 1765. In 1760 he issued twelve etchings of &quot;The Cries of London&quot;. He also made many plates after other artists, including his brother. In 1753–4 he published, anonymously, several single caricatures satirising William Hogarth. He returned to the attack in 1762, and produced other satirical work sporadically throughout his career.

It is not recorded how long Sandby lived with his brother at Windsor, but he is said to have spent part of each year in London, and much of his time was probably spent on sketching excursions. On 3 May 1757 he married Anne Stogden, and by 1760 he was settled in London.

In 1760 he contributed to the first exhibition of the Society of Artists. He exhibited regularly with the society until the foundation of the Royal Academy eight years later, and was one of its first directors when it was incorporated in 1765. In 1768, he was appointed chief drawing master to the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, a position he retained until 1799. On the formation of the Royal Academy in the same year he was one of the 28 founder-members nominated by George III. He often served on its council, and contributed to all but eight of the exhibitions held between 1769 and 1809.

Sandby made extensive journeys around Britain and Ireland, sketching scenery and ancient monuments. He made his first recorded visit to Wales in 1770, later (1773) touring south Wales with Sir Joseph Banks, resulting in the 1775 publication of &quot;XII Views in South Wales&quot; and a further 12 views the following year, part of a 48-plate series of aquatint engravings depicting Welsh scenery commissioned by Banks.
He died at his house in Paddington on 7 November 1809, and was buried in the burial ground of St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square. He was described in his obituaries as &quot;the father of modern landscape painting in watercolors&quot;.

<text>Sir Harold Percival &quot;Harry&quot; Himsworth, KCB, FRS (19 May 1905 – 1 November 1993) was a British scientist, best known for his medical research on diabetes mellitus.

==Early life==
He was born in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, the son of Joseph Arnold Himsworth and Amy Eliza Barraclough. He was educated at the local Spring Grove School and King James&#x27;s Grammar School, Almondbury. He married Charlotte Gray in 1932: they had two sons. His second son, Richard Lawrence Himsworth (1937–2020), was an endocrinologist and public health administrator.

==Medical career==
He studied medicine at the University of London and trained in University College Hospital (UCH). His early involvement in medical research (especially of diabetes and later of liver disease) would lead to an important 1936 paper in The Lancet, distinguishing the two main types of diabetes. He delivered the Goulstonian Lecture at the Royal College of Physicians in 1939 entitled &quot;Mechanism of diabetes mellitus&quot;

He was appointed Professor of Medicine at the University of London and the Secretary of the Medical Research Council (MRC) for the very long period of 1949-1968.

He was awarded a KCB in the New Year honours of 1952 and in 1953 was appointed Honorary Physician to the Queen. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in March, 1955, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957, and the American Philosophical Society in 1972.

The Prime Minister of the day saw Sir Harold Himsworth&#x27;s report about the &#x27;committee considering the effects of ... nuclear radiation&#x27; The Prime Minister&#x27;s comment was &quot;A pity, but we cannot help it&quot;. (dated 16 Nov 1955). From the office of AERE Directors Office.

His archives are being held by the Wellcome Library, London.

==Dieting==

Himsworth recommended a high-carbohydrate diet to treat diabetes. Professor Edwin Gale has noted:

<doc id="746432" wikidata="Q1294379" url="?curid=746432" title="Edwin Albert Link">
<text>Edwin Albert Link (July 26, 1904 – September 7, 1981) was an American inventor, entrepreneur and pioneer in aviation, underwater archaeology, and submersibles. He invented the flight simulator, which was called the &quot;Blue Box&quot; or &quot;Link Trainer&quot;. It was commercialized in 1929, starting a now multibillion-dollar industry. In total, he obtained more than 27 patents for aeronautics, navigation and oceanographic equipment.

==Early life==
Edwin Link was born in Huntington, Indiana, in 1904, the son of Edwin A. Link, Sr., and Katherine (Martin) Link. In 1910, he moved with his family to Binghamton, New York.

==Aviation==
===Aviator===
He took his first flying lesson in 1920. In 1927, he obtained the first Cessna airplane ever delivered and eked out a living by barnstorming, charter flying and giving lessons.

As a young man, Edwin Link used apparatus from his father&#x27;s automatic piano and organ factory (of the Link Piano and Organ Company) to produce an advertising airplane. A punched roll and pneumatic system from a player piano controlled sequential lights on the lower surfaces of the wings to spell out messages like &quot;ENDICOTT-JOHNSON SHOES&quot;. To attract more attention, he added a set of small but loud organ pipes, also controlled by the roll.

===Flight simulator===

In the 1920s, he developed the Link Trainer, &quot;a fuselage-like device with a cockpit and controls that produced the motions and sensations of flying.&quot;

Much of the pneumatic system was adapted directly from technology used in the organ factory; and, in the 1970s, Link used parts scavenged from an inoperative trainer to help rebuild a Link pipe organ.

===Link Aeronautical Corporation===
He formed the Link Aeronautical Corporation in 1929 to manufacture the trainers. His few early customers were amusement parks, not flight training schools; the early models served as amusement rides. Finally, in 1934, the United States Army Air Corps bought six. During World War II, more than half a million airmen were taught using the Link Trainer. In 2000 the Link Trainer was placed on the List of Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmarks.

===Link Aviation===
Together with his wife Marion Clayton Link, whom he had married in 1931, Edwin Link managed the very successful Link Aviation, Inc. He contributed a great deal to the Binghamton, New York area, where he set up a production facility that at one time employed thousands of workers. Although the company later passed through different ownership, its legacy can be traced to the current L3Harris division known as Link Training and Simulation, now headquartered in Arlington, Texas (though it still maintains some operations in Binghamton).

===The Link Foundation===
In 1953, Edwin and Marion Link established The Link Foundation. The foundation continues to provide grants and fellowships in aeronautics, simulation and training, ocean engineering, energy, and organizations of interest to the Links.

==Undersea interests==

===Man-in-Sea project===
After Link sold his company to General Precision in 1954, he turned his attention to underwater archaeology and research. Link worked at developing equipment for deeper, longer lasting and more secure diving. To this end he designed several submersible decompression chambers. On August 28, 1962, at Villefranche-sur-Mer on the Mediterranean Sea, Link inaugurated his &quot;Man in Sea&quot; project by spending eight hours at a depth of in his submersible decompression chamber (SDC), becoming the first diver to be completely saturated with a mixture of oxygen and helium (heliox) while breathing underwater. This dive served as a test run for a dive the following month by Robert Sténuit, who spent over 24 hours in the SDC at a depth of and thus became the world&#x27;s first aquanaut. In June–July 1964, Link conducted his second Man in Sea experiment in the Berry Islands (a chain in the Bahamas) with Sténuit and Jon Lindbergh, one of the sons of Charles Lindbergh. Sténuit and Lindbergh stayed in Link&#x27;s SPID habitat (Submersible, Portable, Inflatable Dwelling) for 49 hours underwater at a depth of , breathing a helium-oxygen mixture. Dr. Joseph B. MacInnis participated in this dive as a life support specialist.

===Submersibles===
In March 1967, Link launched &quot;Deep Diver&quot;, the first small submersible designed for lockout diving, allowing divers to leave and enter the craft while underwater. &quot;Deep Diver&quot; carried out many scientific missions in 1967 and 1968, including a lockout dive in 1967 (at the same location as the 1964 Sténuit-Lindbergh dive) and a lockout dive near Great Stirrup Cay in 1968. Dr. MacInnis participated in both of these dives as an observer in &quot;Deep Diver&quot;&#x27;s forward chamber.

Later in 1968, after &quot;Deep Diver&quot; had been requisitioned by the United States Navy to help search for the lost submarine USS &quot;Scorpion&quot;, the Bureau of Ships determined that &quot;Deep Diver&quot; was unsafe for use at great depths or in extremely cold temperatures because of the substitution of the wrong kind of steel, which became brittle in cold water, in some parts of the sub. Link proceeded to design a new lockout sub with a distinctive acrylic bubble as the forward pilot/observer compartment. In January 1971 the new sub was launched and commissioned to the Smithsonian Institution. It was named the &quot;Johnson Sea Link&quot; after its donors, Link and his friend John Seward Johnson I.

===Death of son===

In June 1973, Link&#x27;s 31-year-old son, Edwin Clayton Link, and another diver, 51-year-old Albert D. Stover, died during a scheduled dive off Key West. They suffered carbon dioxide poisoning when the &quot;Johnson Sea Link&quot; became trapped in debris around a Navy destroyer, the &quot;Fred T. Berry&quot;, which had been sunk to create an artificial reef. The submersible&#x27;s other two occupants survived. Over the next two years, Edwin Link designed an unmanned Cabled Observation and Rescue Device (CORD) that could free a trapped submersible.

==Death==
Edwin Link died in his sleep on September 7, 1981, in Binghamton, New York, where he had been undergoing treatment for cancer.

==Honors==
Link was awarded the Howard N. Potts Medal in 1945 for developing training devices for aviators, and the Royal Aeronautical Society Wakefield Gold Medal in 1947. He received an honorary degree from Syracuse University in 1966 and Binghamton University in 1981. In 1976, he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame.

In 1992, Link was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

Link donated $6 million dollars to build the engineering building on the campus of Syracuse University. The &quot;Edwin A. Link Hall of Engineering&quot; was dedicated in presence of Link and his family on October 16, 1970. It currently houses offices, classrooms and laboratories of the Syracuse University College of Engineering and Computer Science.

From the early 1980s to the 1990s, what is now Greater Binghamton Airport was named Edwin A. Link Field-Broome County Airport his honor. The field is still named after Link, and there is an original &quot;Blue Box&quot; on display in the terminal.

The Link Building at Florida Institute of Technology (Melbourne, FL) is named for Edwin A. Link inventor of the Link Trainer and co-founder of the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution. A display of an original Link Trainer can be seen in the College of Aeronautics’ Skurla Hall, a two-minute walk from the Link Building.

<text>Sardar Mohammad Hashim Khan (1884 – 26 October 1953) was a political figure in Afghanistan.

== Early life ==
Mohammad Hashim Khan was born in 1884 in Dehradun, British India. He was the younger brother of King Mohammad Nadir Shah and the elder brother of Sardar Shah Mahmud Khan and Sardar Shah Wali Khan. Hashim put into effect the policies already orchestrated by his brothers. Internal objectives of the new Afghan government focused on strengthening the army and shoring up the economy, including transport and communications. Both goals required foreign assistance. Preferring not to rely on the Soviet Union or Britain, Hashim turned to Nazi Germany. By 1935 German experts and businessmen had set up factories and hydroelectric projects at the invitation of the Afghan government. Smaller amounts of aid were also offered by Imperial Japan and Fascist Italy. He governed Afghanistan as Royal Prime Minister from 8 November 1933 until 9 May 1946.

During the war years he faced significant opposition as a result of his stance on the ongoing political question of whether to yield to the British or resist them. The decision to expel Axis colonies from Afghanistan was particularly unpopular and by October 1941 the Italian Minister in Kabul was reporting to the Foreign Affairs Office in Rome that Hashim would &#x27;have his work cut out to save not only appearances but his life itself&#x27;.

<doc id="746462" wikidata="Q423265" url="?curid=746462" title="Tungsten carbide">
<text>Tungsten carbide (chemical formula: WC) is a chemical compound (specifically, a carbide) containing equal parts of tungsten and carbon atoms. In its most basic form, tungsten carbide is a fine gray powder, but it can be pressed and formed into shapes through sintering for use in industrial machinery, engineering facilities, molding blocks, cutting tools, chisels, abrasives, armor-piercing bullets and jewelry.

Tungsten carbide is approximately three times as stiff as steel, with a Young&#x27;s modulus of approximately 530–700 GPa, and is twice as dense as steel. It is comparable with corundum (α-) in hardness, approaching that of a diamond, and can be polished and finished only with abrasives of superior hardness such as cubic boron nitride and diamond powder, wheels and compounds. Tungsten carbide tools can be operated at cutting speeds much higher than high-speed steel (a special steel blend for cutting tools).

Tungsten carbide powder was first synthesized by H. Moissan in 1893, and the industrial production of the cemented form started 20 to 25 years later (between 1913 and 1918).

==Naming==
Colloquially among workers in various industries (such as machining), tungsten carbide is often simply called &quot;carbide.&quot;

==Synthesis==

=== Powder ===
Tungsten carbide powder is prepared by reaction of tungsten metal (or powder) and carbon at 1,400–2,000 °C. Other methods include a lower temperature fluid bed process that reacts either tungsten metal (or powder) or blue with CO/ gas mixture and gas between 900 and 1,200 °C.

WC can also be produced by heating WO3 with graphite, either directly at 900 °C or in hydrogen at 670 °C, followed by carburization in argon at 1,000 °C. Chemical vapor deposition methods that have been investigated include:
*reacting tungsten hexachloride with hydrogen (as a reducing agent) and methane (as the source of carbon) at 
: + + → WC + 6HCl
*reacting tungsten hexafluoride with hydrogen (as reducing agent) and methanol (as source of carbon) at 
: + 2 + → WC + 6HF + 

=== Cemented form ===
Solid tungsten carbide is prepared using techniques from powder metallurgy developed in the 1920s. Powdered tungsten carbide is mixed with another powdered metal, usually cobalt (alternatives include nickel, iron and paraffin wax) which acts as a binder. The mixture is pressed, then sintered by heating it to temperatures of to ; the binder melts, wets, and partially dissolves the tungsten grains, binding them together. The cobalt-tungsten composites specifically are known by a number of trade names, including Widia and Carboloy.

==Chemical properties==
There are two well-characterized compounds of tungsten and carbon: tungsten carbide, , and tungsten semicarbide, . Both compounds may be present in coatings and the proportions can depend on the coating method.

Another meta-stable compound of tungsten and carbon can be created by heating the WC phase to high temperatures using plasma, then quenching in inert gas (plasma spheroidization). This process causes macrocrystalline WC particles to spheroidize and results in the non-stoichiometric high temperature phase existing in a meta-stable form at room temperature. The fine microstructure of this phase provides high hardness (28003500 HV) combined with good toughness when compared with other tungsten carbide compounds. The meta-stable nature of this compound results in reduced high temperature stability.

At high temperatures WC decomposes to tungsten and carbon and this can occur during high-temperature thermal spray, e.g., in high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) and high energy plasma (HEP) methods.

Oxidation of WC starts at . It is resistant to acids and is only attacked by hydrofluoric acid/nitric acid (HF/) mixtures above room temperature. It reacts with fluorine gas at room temperature and chlorine above and is unreactive to dry up to its melting point. Finely powdered WC oxidizes readily in hydrogen peroxide aqueous solutions. At high temperatures and pressures it reacts with aqueous sodium carbonate forming sodium tungstate, a procedure used for recovery of scrap cemented carbide due to its selectivity.

==Physical properties==
Tungsten carbide has a high melting point at , a boiling point of when under a pressure equivalent to , a thermal conductivity of 110 W/m·K, and a coefficient of thermal expansion of 5.5 μm/m·K.

Tungsten carbide is extremely hard, ranking about 9.0–9.5 on the Mohs scale, and with a Vickers number of around 2600. It has a Young&#x27;s modulus of approximately 530–700 GPa, a bulk modulus of 379–381 GPa, and a shear modulus of 274 GPa. It has an ultimate tensile strength of 344 MPa, an ultimate compression strength of about 2.7 GPa and a Poisson&#x27;s ratio of 0.31 .

The speed of a longitudinal pressure wave (the speed of sound) through a thin rod of tungsten carbide is 6220 m/s.

Tungsten carbide&#x27;s low electrical resistivity of about 0.2 μΩ·m is comparable with that of some metals (e.g. vanadium 0.2 μΩ·m).

WC is readily wetted by both molten nickel and cobalt. Investigation of the phase diagram of the W-C-Co system shows that WC and Co form a pseudo binary eutectic. The phase diagram also shows that there are so-called η-carbides with composition that can be formed and the brittleness of these phases makes control of the carbon content in WC-Co cemented carbides important. In the presence of a molten phase such as cobalt, abnormal grain growth is known to occur in the sintering of tungsten carbide, with this having significant effects on the performance of the product material.

==Structure==
There are two forms of WC, a hexagonal form, α-WC (hP2, space group Pm2, No. 187), and a cubic high-temperature form, β-WC, which has the rock salt structure. The hexagonal form can be visualized as made up of a simple hexagonal lattice of metal atoms of layers lying directly over one another (i.e. not close packed), with carbon atoms filling half the interstices giving both tungsten and carbon a regular trigonal prismatic, 6 coordination. From the unit cell dimensions the following bond lengths can be determined: The distance between the tungsten atoms in a hexagonally packed layer is 291 pm, the shortest distance between tungsten atoms in adjoining layers is 284 pm, and the tungsten carbon bond length is 220 pm. The tungsten-carbon bond length is therefore comparable to the single bond in (218 pm) in which there is strongly distorted trigonal prismatic coordination of tungsten.

Molecular WC has been investigated and this gas phase species has a bond length of 171 pm for .

==Applications==

===Cutting tools for machining===
Sintered tungsten carbide–cobalt cutting tools are very abrasion resistant and can also withstand higher temperatures than standard high-speed steel (HSS) tools. Carbide cutting surfaces are often used for machining tough materials such as carbon steel or stainless steel, and in applications where steel tools would wear quickly, such as high-quantity and high-precision production. Because carbide tools maintain a sharp cutting edge better than steel tools, they generally produce a better finish on parts, and their temperature resistance allows faster machining. The material is usually called cemented carbide, solid carbide, hardmetal or tungsten-carbide cobalt. It is a metal matrix composite, where tungsten carbide particles are the aggregate, and metallic cobalt serves as the matrix. It has been found wear and oxidation properties of cemented carbide can be improved by replacing cobalt with iron aluminide. Using iron also reduces cost, as cobalt is particularly expensive, but the mixing is best done with resonant acoustic mixing. Tungsten carbide cutting tools can be further enhanced with coatings such as titanium aluminium nitride or titanium chromium nitride to increase their thermal stability, and prolong tool life.

===Ammunition===
Tungsten carbide, in its monolithic sintered form, or much more often in cemented tungsten carbide cobalt composite (see above), is often used in armor-piercing ammunition, especially where depleted uranium is not available or is politically unacceptable. projectiles were first used by German Luftwaffe tank-hunter squadrons in World War II. However, owing to the limited German reserves of tungsten, material was reserved for making machine tools and small numbers of projectiles. It is an effective penetrator due to its combination of great hardness and very high density.

Tungsten carbide ammunition is now generally of the sabot type. SLAP, or saboted light armour penetrator, where a plastic sabot discards at the barrel muzzle, is one of the primary types of saboted small arms ammunition. Non-discarding jackets, regardless of the jacket material, are not perceived as sabots but as bullets. Both of the designs are, however, common in designated light armor-piercing small arms ammunition. Discarding sabots such as are used with M1A1 Abrams main gun are more commonplace in precision high-velocity gun ammunition.

===Mining and foundation drilling===

Tungsten carbide is used extensively in mining in top hammer rock drill bits, downhole hammers, roller-cutters, long wall plough chisels, long wall shearer picks, raiseboring reamers, and tunnel boring machines. In these applications it is also used for wear and corrosion resistant components in inlet control for well screens, sub-assemblies, seal rings and bushings common in oil and gas drilling. It is generally utilised as a button insert, mounted in a surrounding matrix of steel that forms the substance of the bit. As the tungsten carbide button is worn away the softer steel matrix containing it is also worn away, exposing yet more button insert.

===Nuclear===

Tungsten carbide is also an effective neutron reflector and as such was used during early investigations into nuclear chain reactions, particularly for weapons. A criticality accident occurred at Los Alamos National Laboratory on 21 August 1945 when Harry Daghlian accidentally dropped a tungsten carbide brick onto a plutonium sphere, known as the demon core, causing the subcritical mass to go supercritical with the reflected neutrons. He fell into a coma and died 25 days after the accident.

===Sports usage===

Trekking poles, used by many hikers for balance and to reduce pressure on leg joints, generally use carbide tips in order to gain traction when placed on hard surfaces (like rock); carbide tips last much longer than other types of tip.

While ski pole tips are generally not made of carbide, since they do not need to be especially hard even to break through layers of ice, rollerski tips usually are. Roller skiing emulates cross country skiing and is used by many skiers to train during warm weather months.

Sharpened carbide tipped spikes (known as studs) can be inserted into the drive tracks of snowmobiles. These studs enhance traction on icy surfaces. Longer v-shaped segments fit into grooved rods called wear rods under each snowmobile ski. The relatively sharp carbide edges enhance steering on harder icy surfaces. The carbide tips and segments reduce wear encountered when the snowmobile must cross roads and other abrasive surfaces.

Car, motorcycle and bicycle tires with tungsten carbide studs provide better traction on ice. They are generally preferred to steel studs because of their superior resistance to wear.

Tungsten carbide may be used in farriery, the shoeing of horses, to improve traction on slippery surfaces such as roads or ice. Carbide-tipped hoof nails may be used to attach the shoes; in the United States, borium – chips of tungsten carbide in a matrix of softer metal such as bronze or mild steel – may be welded to small areas of the underside of the shoe before fitting.

===Surgical instruments and medical===
Tungsten carbide is also used for making surgical instruments meant for open surgery (scissors, forceps, hemostats, blade-handles, etc.) and laparoscopic surgery (graspers, scissors/cutter, needle holder, cautery, etc.). They are much costlier than their stainless-steel counterparts and require delicate handling, but give better performance.

===Jewelry===

Tungsten carbide, typically in the form of a cemented carbide (carbide particles brazed together by metal), has become a popular material in the bridal jewelry industry due to its extreme hardness and high resistance to scratching. Even with high-impact resistance, this extreme hardness also means that it can occasionally be shattered. Some consider this useful, since an impact would shatter a tungsten ring, quickly removing it, where precious metals would bend flat and require cutting. Tungsten carbide is roughly 10 times harder than 18k gold. In addition to its design and high polish, part of its attraction to consumers is its technical nature. Special tools, such as locking pliers, may be required if such a ring must be removed quickly (e.g. due to medical emergency following a hand injury accompanied by swelling).

===Other===

Tungsten carbide is widely used to make the rotating ball in the tips of ballpoint pens that disperse ink during writing.

English guitarist Martin Simpson uses a custom-made tungsten carbide guitar slide, which gives it superior sustain and volume.

Tungsten carbide has been investigated for its potential use as a catalyst and it has been found to resemble platinum in its catalysis of the production of water from hydrogen and oxygen at room temperature, the reduction of tungsten trioxide by hydrogen in the presence of water, and the isomerisation of 2,2-dimethylpropane to 2-methylbutane. It has been proposed as a replacement for the iridium catalyst in hydrazine-powered satellite thrusters.

A tungsten carbide coating has been utilized on brake discs in high performance automotive applications to improve performance, increase service intervals and reduce brake dust.

==Toxicity==
The primary health risks associated with tungsten carbide relate to inhalation of dust, leading to silicosis-like pulmonary fibrosis. Cobalt-cemented tungsten carbide is also anticipated to be a human carcinogen by the American National Toxicology Program.

<doc id="746466" wikidata="Q2335880" url="?curid=746466" title="George Smiley">
<text>George Smiley OBE is a fictional character created by John le Carré. Smiley is a career intelligence officer with &quot;The Circus&quot;, the British overseas intelligence agency. He is a central character in the novels &quot;Call for the Dead&quot;, &quot;A Murder of Quality&quot;, &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;, &quot;The Honourable Schoolboy&quot;, &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot; and &quot;Karla&#x27;s Choice&quot;, and a supporting character in &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot;, &quot;The Looking Glass War&quot;, &quot;The Secret Pilgrim&quot; and &quot;A Legacy of Spies&quot;. The character has also appeared in a number of film, television, and radio adaptations of le Carré&#x27;s books.

Le Carré created Smiley as an intentional contrast to James Bond, a character who he believed depicted an inaccurate and damaging version of espionage. Short, overweight, balding, and bespectacled, Smiley is polite and and frequently allows others to mistreat him, including his serially unfaithful wife; these traits mask his inner cunning, excellent memory, mastery of tradecraft, and occasional ruthlessness. His genius, coupled with other characters&#x27; willingness to underestimate him, allows Smiley to achieve his goals and ultimately become one of the most powerful spies in Britain.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; has called him &quot;the sort of spy [Britain] believes it ought to have: a bit shabby, academic, basically loyal, and sceptical of the enthusiasms of his political masters.&quot;

==Description==

In contrast to other fictional spies of the era, Smiley is described as being short, overweight, balding, and middle aged, and he is frequently compared to either a toad or a mole. While cinematic adaptations tend to depict him in dark, three piece suits, the novels describe his clothing as being &quot;really bad&quot;, with other characters remarking that he &quot;dresses like a bookie&quot;; characters and narration clarify that this refers to his clothes being very loose and baggy, the result of his tailor taking advantage of Smiley&#x27;s ignorance of men&#x27;s fashion to charge him more money for the extra fabric. He wears thick, round glasses (Le Carré does not describe the style or nature of the spectacle frames) and tends to clean the lenses on the &#x27;fat&#x27; end of his tie while contemplating something of great significance; the gesture is ubiquitous enough that other characters consider it to be something of a trademark.

The American scholars Norman Polmar and Thomas Allen described Smiley as the fictional spy most likely to be successful as a real spy, citing le Carré&#x27;s description of him in &quot;A Murder of Quality&quot;:

Polmar and Allen wrote that Smiley&#x27;s banal qualities together with his intelligence and a talent for intrigue made him ideal as a spy even though he was very far from the popular stereotype of what a spy should be like. Smiley&#x27;s wife Ann calls him &quot;breathtakingly ordinary&quot;, which Polmar and Allen wrote was an advantage for a spy, the very nature of their profession which requires them to be as inconspicuous as possible. In 1980, le Carré defined Smiley&#x27;s politics: &quot;I think he stands where I stand; he feels that to pit yourself against any &#x27;ism&#x27; is to strike a posture which is itself ideological and therefore offensive in terms of practical decency. In practice almost any political ideology invites you to set aside your humanitarian instincts&quot;. The world of espionage presented by le Carré in his novels was a world where lies, betrayal, intrigue and paranoia were the norm for both sides, and much of the appeal of Smiley was that of a moral man trying his best to stay decent in a profoundly amoral world.

===Age===

Although Smiley ages through his appearances over a half-century, Le Carré has frequently retconned elements of his backstory so that he exists on something of a floating timeline. In his initial appearance in 1961&#x27;s &quot;Call for the Dead&quot;, Smiley is somewhere around 55 years of age; changes to his birth year in &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;, set between 1973 and 1974, make him about 58 during the events of that story. He ages into his sixties during the subsequent two novels, &quot;The Honourable Schoolboy&quot; and &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot;, the latter of which depicts him in declining physical health as he grows older and heavier. However, although no reference is made to his age in 2017&#x27;s &quot;A Legacy of Spies&quot;, set in 2017, he does not appear to be substantially older than he was in his last appearance, although he should be at minimum 102 years old during the events of the book (or 111 if the &quot;Call for the Dead&quot; chronology is in effect). This has led Dwight Garner of &quot;The New York Times&quot; to observe that Smiley is &quot;one of those ashen Englishmen, like the poet Philip Larkin, who seem to be permanently 60 years old.&quot;

==Early life==

Although Smiley has no concrete biography beyond that offered briefly at the beginning of &quot;Call for the Dead&quot;, le Carré does leave clues in his novels.

Smiley was born to middle-class parents in the South of England in the early part of the 20th century (his birth date is retconned from 1906 to 1915 in &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;), and spent at least part of his childhood in Germany near the Black Forest. He attended a minor public school and an antiquated Oxford college of no real distinction (in the 1982 BBC television adaptation of &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot;, he refers to himself as a fellow of Lincoln College, le Carré&#x27;s alma mater in real life), studying modern languages with a particular focus on Baroque German literature. One July, while considering post-graduate study in that field, he was recruited into the Circus by his tutor, Jebedee.

Smiley underwent training and probation in Central Europe and South America, and spent the period from 1935 until approximately 1938 in Germany recruiting networks under cover as a lecturer. In 1939, with the commencement of World War II, he saw active service not only in Germany, but also in Switzerland and Sweden. Smiley&#x27;s wartime superiors described him as having &quot;the cunning of Satan and the conscience of a virgin&quot;. During this time, he met and recruited Dieter Frey, who would go on to become an East German intelligence operative running the intelligence circle that was the main plot point of Le Carré&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Call for the Dead&quot;.

In 1943, he was recalled to England to work at Circus headquarters, and in 1945 successfully proposed marriage to Lady Ann Sercomb, a beautiful, aristocratic, and libidinous young lady working as a secretary there. Ann would soon prove herself chronically unfaithful, engaging in numerous affairs and occasionally leaving Smiley entirely, though she always returned to him after the initial excitement of the separation ended. In the same year, Smiley left the Service and returned to Oxford. However, in 1947, with the onset of the Cold War, Smiley was asked to return to the Service, and in early 1951 moved into counter-intelligence work, where he would remain for the next decade. It is reported with a reference to the real life Gouzenko affair that &quot;the revelations of a young cipher clerk in Ottawa had created a new demand for men of Smiley&#x27;s experience&quot;. In 1945, Igor Gouzenko, a Soviet cipher clerk at the Soviet embassy in Ottawa, defected and revealed a widespread Soviet spying network in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada that came as a considerable shock to the leaders of western nations. During that period, Smiley first met his Soviet , Karla, in a Delhi prison. Karla proved impossible to crack, though an increasingly desperate Smiley inadvertently revealed his own weakness – his affection for his wife, Ann – during the interrogation. After he offered Karla the use of his cigarette lighter – a gift from his wife – Karla stole it, keeping it as a symbol of his victory over Smiley. The incident would continue to haunt Smiley for the remainder of his career.

==In the novels==

===The early novels===
Smiley first appears in &quot;Call for the Dead&quot;, le Carré&#x27;s debut novel. After an introductory chapter documenting Smiley&#x27;s wartime bravery, the narrative moves to 1960, which finds the formerly heroic Smiley working a menial intelligence job, security-clearing civil servants. After a man he interviewed apparently commits suicide in despair over being a suspected communist, Smiley resigns from the Circus in disgust; the revelation that the man&#x27;s death may in fact have been a murder spurs Smiley to launch an independent investigation with the help of his protege, Peter Guillam, and police detective Oliver Mendel. Smiley&#x27;s investigation uncovers that the &quot;suicide&quot; was in fact a murder perpetrated by an East German spy ring operating in the UK and being operated by one of his own former agents, whom he accidentally kills in a physical altercation. Although the Circus offers him his job back as a reward, Smiley declines, instead leaving England for a tentative reunion with Ann, who had earlier left him for a racing car driver. Smiley spends much of the story bemoaning the loss of the talented agents who were his mentors prior to the war, and their replacement by such talentless bureaucrats as the current head of service, Maston, who is widely, if secretly, mocked.

It is while pursuing a sedate life of scholastic research in German literature at a university in the West Country (probably Exeter) that he is called upon to investigate a murder at a fictional public school in le Carré&#x27;s next novel, &quot;A Murder of Quality&quot;.

Smiley next reappears as a minor but pivotal character in &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot;, his third novel. Smiley is revealed to have come back into the service of the Circus as the top aide to Control, Maston&#x27;s mysterious successor as the Circus&#x27; chief. It&#x27;s revealed that, following the events of &quot;Call for the Dead,&quot; Smiley and Guillam succeeded in turning Mundt, the sole survivor of the spy ring, into a British double agent, and sent him back to East Germany. Fearing that Mundt&#x27;s cover is about to be blown, Smiley and Control manipulate agent Alec Leamas into posing as a defector and sending him to Germany under the assumption that he is going to orchestrate Mundt&#x27;s death. Along the way, Smiley learns that Leamas blew his own cover to his girlfriend, a nineteen-year-old communist sympathiser named Liz Gold, and arranges to incorporate her into the plot. Although Liz&#x27;s unwitting role ultimately ensures the mission&#x27;s success, it also results in her death, prompting a grief-stricken Leamas to give up and let himself be shot dead at the Berlin Wall as Smiley attempts to extricate him.

Smiley plays a small but pivotal role in &quot;The Looking Glass War&quot;, le Carré&#x27;s fourth novel, occupying the &quot;North European desk&quot; at the Circus. He appears sporadically throughout the book as a liaison to &quot;The Department,&quot; a military intelligence agency, which attempts to surreptitiously conduct a dangerous and unnecessary operation without the Circus&#x27; knowledge. Smiley&#x27;s appearance here is notable in that &quot;War&quot; is the only book of the series to depict his and Control&#x27;s personal relationship in great detail. The climax of the novel bears witness to Smiley&#x27;s ruthlessness, as he is dispatched by the Circus to end the Department&#x27;s operation and force the abandonment of a Department employee to ameliorate the damage they have caused.

Smiley does not appear in either of le Carré&#x27;s next two works, only one of which dealt with espionage.

===Prior to the Karla trilogy===

Several years pass between Smiley&#x27;s appearance in &quot;The Looking Glass War&quot;, set circa 1964, and &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;, which takes place in 1973. During this period, Smiley&#x27;s position in the Circus comes to be threatened by his contemporary Bill Haydon, proteges Toby Esterhase and Roy Bland, and ambitious newcomer Percy Alleline. Alleline develops a personal feud with Control due to the latter&#x27;s class and ethnic prejudice against Percy&#x27;s Scottish heritage, prompting factions to form within the Circus, with Control, Smiley, and Peter Guillam on one side and Alleline, Haydon, Esterhase, and Bland on the other. When Control is eased out of the Circus in late 1972 after the capture of agent Jim Prideaux in Czechoslovakia, Smiley too is forced out. The Circus is taken over by Alleline, with Haydon running &quot;London Station&quot;, a branch overseeing all of the service&#x27;s spy networks. Guillam remains in the Circus as Smiley&#x27;s sole resource/ally, albeit in a greatly diminished position.

===The Karla trilogy===
In September or October 1973, the events of &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; take place, with Smiley successfully managing to expose Haydon as the long-term Soviet agent, or &quot;mole&quot;, codenamed &quot;Gerald&quot; and reporting directly to Smiley&#x27;s nemesis, Karla, head of Moscow Centre. Following the revelation, Alleline is drummed out of the Circus for his failure to identify Haydon himself and for permitting such a breach of national security to occur on his watch. Smiley is installed by Whitehall as the new head of the Circus and tasked with both tying up loose ends left by Haydon&#x27;s treachery and launching a successful espionage mission to prove the organisation&#x27;s viability.

&quot;The Honourable Schoolboy&quot;, set in 1974, finds Smiley having assembled a new team, made up of former colleague Connie Sachs; Doc di Salis, a Jesuit priest who is an expert on communist China; Guillam; and a rehabilitated Esterhase. After learning that Karla has been making exorbitant payments to a heretofore unknown Chinese source, Smiley tasks agent Jerry Westerby with going to Hong Kong disguised as a reporter and identifying the spy. Westerby identifies the man as Nelson Ko, the brother of prominent Triad member Drake Ko. However, he also falls in love with Drake&#x27;s mistress Lizzie and attempts to betray the Circus as a result. Smiley&#x27;s bodyguard, Fawn, assassinates Westerby, and then disappears from the Circus, presumably fired by Smiley. Concurrently, the CIA takes Nelson into custody, cutting off Circus access to him. The incident prompts Smiley&#x27;s dismissal as Circus boss, with Guillam contemplating the possibility that Smiley permitted the CIA to succeed to get himself removed from the position.

&quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot;, set in late 1977, finds a retired Smiley launching an investigation into the death of an elderly Estonian general, nationalist activist, and former Circus agent. A convoluted trail leads Smiley to discover that Karla has an illegitimate daughter whose existence he has gone to great lengths to hide, and who Karla smuggled through France and into Switzerland to receive desperately needed treatment for a severe case of schizophrenia. Smiley uses his knowledge of Karla&#x27;s daughter to blackmail him into defecting, and in December 1977 Smiley greets Karla at the Berlin Wall as part of a contingent of Circus agents including Guillam and Esterhase. Karla is taken into British custody, with Esterhase congratulating Smiley on the accomplishment of a lifetime, though Smiley appears to reproach himself for the methods he used to achieve it.

In November of 2023, it was announced that Nick Harkaway would be writing a new George Smiley novel that takes place between the events of &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; and &quot;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&quot;. 

===Smiley in retirement===
Smiley was absent in the three le Carré novels of the 1980s. He re-surfaced for a penultimate time in 1990 when he appeared in &quot;The Secret Pilgrim&quot;, enjoying a happy retirement and in better spirits than his protege, the novel&#x27;s narrator Ned, has ever seen him. Ned reveals that, shortly before the events of the book, he temporarily returned to the Circus to chair the &quot;Fishing Rights Committee&quot;, a body set up to explore possible areas of co-operation between British and Russian intelligence services. The end of the book finds Smiley politely requesting that he never be brought out of retirement again, and departing for a vacation in Oceania.

Smiley appears in le Carré&#x27;s 2017 novel &quot;A Legacy of Spies&quot;, set after 2010. At the end of the novel, which explores fallout from the events depicted in &quot;The Spy Who Came In from the Cold&quot;, Smiley meets with the novel&#x27;s central character, Peter Guillam. The nonagenarian Smiley is now a resident of Freiburg, Germany, where he lives in a small apartment and conducts research at a library. The novel portrays him as still visited occasionally by his wife, Ann, and in touch with his old associate Jim Prideaux. Speaking with Guillam, he contends that his work had ultimately been for the benefit of Europe.

== Models ==
In 1995, le Carré said that the character of George Smiley was inspired by his one-time Lincoln College, Oxford tutor, the former Rev. Vivian Green—a renowned historian and author with an encyclopaedic knowledge. However, other than the thick glasses, loud clothes, and Green&#x27;s habit of disappearing into a crowd, there were too many dissimilarities between the loquacious Green and the reticent Smiley to make this a clear match, and so other sources for Smiley continued to be named. It has been suggested that le Carré subconsciously took the name of his hero from special forces and intelligence officer Colonel David de Crespigny Smiley. More commonly, it was rumoured that Smiley was modelled on Sir Maurice Oldfield, a former head of British Intelligence, who physically resembled him. Le Carré denied the rumours, citing the fact that Oldfield and he were not contemporaries, although he and Alec Guinness did lunch with Oldfield while Guinness was researching the role, and Guinness adopted several of Oldfield&#x27;s mannerisms of dress and behaviour for his performance. During the lunch, Oldfield denied to Guinness that he was the inspiration for Smiley, saying he was not like Smiley at all. In 1986, le Carré denied that Oldfield was the inspiration for Smiley, saying: &quot;I never heard of Sir Maurice either by name or in any other way until long after the name and character of George Smiley were in print&quot;.

Oldfield himself believed that, although Green probably inspired le Carré, the character of Smiley was primarily based on John Bingham, 7th Baron Clanmorris, who had been le Carré&#x27;s boss when he originally joined MI5 prior to his career in MI6. In 1999, le Carré confirmed that Bingham was also an inspiration for Smiley, and in 2000 went further, writing in an introduction to a reissue of one of Bingham&#x27;s novels that &quot;He had been one of two men who had gone into the making of George Smiley. Nobody who knew John and the work he was doing could have missed the description of Smiley in my first novel&quot;.

In an introductory essay dated March 1992, le Carré wrote:

And it is no surprise to me that, when I came to invent my leading character, George Smiley, I should give him something of Vivian Green&#x27;s unlikely wisdom, wrapped in academic learning, and something of Bingham&#x27;s devious resourcefulness and simple patriotism also. All fictional characters are amalgams; all spring from much deeper wells than their apparent counterparts in life. All in the end, like the poor suspects in my files, are refitted and remoulded in the writer&#x27;s imagination, until they are probably closer to his own nature than to anybody else&#x27;s. But now that Bingham is dead ... it seems only right that I should acknowledge my debt to him: not merely as a component of George Smiley, but as the man who first put the spark to my writing career.

==Parody==
In the popular TV comedy series &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;, Ronnie Barker played Smiley along the lines of Alec Guinness&#x27; portrayal in a sketch called &quot;Tinker Tailor Smiley Doyle&quot;. This was a joint send-up of &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; and &quot;The Professionals&quot; TV series, with Ronnie Corbett playing a bungling version of Martin Shaw&#x27;s Doyle. Barker&#x27;s Smiley provides the brains to the brawn of Corbett&#x27;s Doyle and actually comes out the better. He is shown as something of an obsessive tea drinker. The sketch guest-starred Frank Williams from &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;. The name of Smiley&#x27;s enemy Karla can be seen on a secretary&#x27;s computer screen. A series of sketches in &quot;The Fast Show&quot; star John Thomson as a Smiley-like interrogator who finds it incredibly easy to prompt the interrogatee to reveal his crimes, usually simply by introducing himself. Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse performed a sketch in 2012 about there being two George Smileys: a reference to the vastly different portrayals in the filmed versions of &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;.

<text>Phototypesetting is a method of setting type which uses photography to make columns of type on a scroll of photographic paper.
It has been made obsolete by the popularity of the personal computer and desktop publishing which gave rise to digital typesetting.

The first phototypesetters quickly project light through a film negative of an individual character in a font, then through a lens that magnifies or reduces the size of the character onto photographic paper or film, which is collected on a spool in a light-proof canister. The paper or film is then fed into a processor, a machine that pulls the paper or film strip through two or three baths of chemicals, from which it emerges ready for paste-up or film make-up. Later phototypesetting machines used other methods, such as displaying a digitised character on a CRT screen. The results of this process are then transferred onto printing plates which are used in offset printing.

Phototypesetting offered numerous advantages over the metal type used in letterpress printing, including the lack of need to keep heavy metal type and matrices in stock, the ability to use a much wider range of fonts and graphics and to print them at any desired size, and faster page layout setting.

== History ==
===Background===
Phototypesetting machines project characters onto film for offset printing. Prior to the advent of phototypesetting, mass-market typesetting typically employed hot metal typesetting – an improvement introduced in the late 19th century to the letterpress printing technique that offered greatly improved typesetting speed and efficiency compared to manual typesetting (where every sort had to be set by hand). The major advancement presented by phototypesetting over hot metal typesetting was the elimination of the metal type altogether which was not needed by the offset printing process. This cold-type technology could also be used in office environments where hot-metal machines (the Linotype, Intertype or Monotype) could not. The use of phototypesetting grew rapidly in the 1960s when software was developed to convert marked up copy, usually typed on paper tape, to the codes that controlled the phototypesetters.

=== 1950s and 60s ===

==== Initial phototypesetting machines ====

In 1949 the Photon Corporation in Cambridge, Massachusetts developed equipment based on the Lumitype of Rene Higonnet and Louis Moyroud. The Lumitype-Photon was first used to set a complete published book in 1953, and for newspaper work in 1954. Mergenthaler produced the Linofilm using a different design, and Monotype produced Monophoto. Other companies followed with products that included Alphatype and Varityper.

To provide much greater speeds, the Photon Corporation produced the ZIP 200 machine for the MEDLARS project of the National Library of Medicine and Mergenthaler produced the Linotron. The ZIP 200 could produce text at 600 characters per second using high-speed flashes behind plates with images of the characters to be printed. Each character had a separate xenon flash constantly ready to fire. A separate system of optics positioned the image on the page.
==== Use of CRT screens for phototypesetting ====

An enormous advance was made by the mid-1960s with the development of equipment that projects the characters from CRT screens. Early CRT phototypesetters, such as Linotype&#x27;s Linotron 1010 from 1966, used the same type of film negative for the font source as traditional optical phototypesetters did, but by instead scanning the font negative via a flying spot scanner array to a video signal, which was then displayed on the CRT to be exposed to the photographic paper or film. Later CRT phototypesetters used high-resolution digitized font data stored in a frame buffer which was used to render the font characters directly to the CRT.

Alphanumeric Corporation (later Autologic) produced the APS series. Rudolf Hell developed the Digiset machine in Germany. The RCA Graphic Systems Division manufactured this in the U.S. as the Videocomp, later marketed by Information International Inc. Software for operator-controlled hyphenation was a major component of digital typesetting. Early work on this topic produced paper tape to control hot-metal machines. C. J. Duncan, at the University of Durham in England, was a pioneer. The earliest applications of computer-controlled phototypesetting machines produced the output of the Russian translation programs of Gilbert King at the IBM Research Laboratories, and built-up mathematical formulas and other material in the Cooperative Computing Laboratory of Michael Barnett at MIT.

There are extensive accounts of the early applications, the equipment
and the PAGE I algorithmic typesetting language for the Videocomp, that introduced elaborate formatting

In Europe, the company of Berthold had no experience in developing hot-metal typesetting equipment, but being one of the largest German type foundries, they applied themselves to the transference. Berthold successfully developed its Diatype (1960), Diatronic (1967), and ADS (1977) machines, which led the European high-end typesetting market for decades.

=== 1970s ===

==== Expansion of technology to small users ====
Compugraphic produced phototypesetting machines in the 1970s that made it economically feasible for small publications to set their own type with professional quality. One model, the Compugraphic Compuwriter, uses a filmstrip wrapped around a drum that rotates at several hundred revolutions per minute. The filmstrip contains two fonts (a Roman and a bold or a Roman and an Italic) in one point size. To get different-sized fonts, the typesetter loads a different font strip or uses a 2x magnifying lens built into the machine, which doubles the size of font. The CompuWriter II automated the lens switch and let the operator use multiple settings. Other manufacturers of photo compositing machines include Alphatype, Varityper,
Mergenthaler, Autologic, Berthold, Dymo, Harris (formerly Linotype&#x27;s competitor &quot;Intertype&quot;), Monotype, Star/Photon, Graphic Systems Inc., Hell AG, MGD Graphic Systems, and American Type Founders.

Released in 1975, the Compuwriter IV holds two filmstrips, each holding four fonts (usually Roman, Italic, bold, and bold Italic). It also has a lens turret which has eight lenses giving different point sizes from the font, generally 8 or 12 sizes, depending on the model. Low-range models offer sizes from 6- to 36-point, while the high-range models go to 72-point. The Compugraphic EditWriter series took the Compuwriter IV configuration and added floppy disk storage on an 8-inch, 320 KB disk. This allows the typesetter to make changes and corrections without rekeying. A CRT screen lets the user view typesetting codes and text.

Because early generations of phototypesetters could not change text size and font easily, many composing rooms and print shops had special machines designed to set display type or headlines. One such model is the PhotoTypositor, manufactured by Visual Graphics Corporation, which lets the user position each letter visually and thus retain complete control over kerning. Compugraphic&#x27;s model 7200 uses the &quot;strobe-through-a-filmstrip-through-a-lens&quot; technology to expose letters and characters onto a 35mm strip of phototypesetting paper that is then developed by a photo processor. The 7200 is a headliner machine that read the character width from the filmstrip as the character is flashed onto the photographic paper so the unit knows how many motor pulses to move the paper. The most common unit was a low-range unit that went up to 72 points but there was also a high-range unit that went to 120 points.

Some later phototypesetters utilize a CRT to project the image of letters onto the photographic paper. This creates a sharper image, adds some flexibility in manipulating the type, and creates the ability to offer a continuous range of point sizes by eliminating film media and lenses. The Compugraphic MCS (Modular Composition System) with the 8400 typesetter is an example of a CRT phototypesetter. This machine loads digital fonts into memory from an 8-inch floppy disk. There was a dual floppy which could also be used with a 1 or 2 hard disk option. Additionally, the 8400 is able to set type-in point sizes between 5- and 120-point in 1/2-point increments. Type width could be adjusted independently of size. It had a movable CRT that covered a rectangle about 200 x 200 points and it would set all the characters in that rectangle before it moved the CRT or the paper. Common characters would still be in memory from the previous moves. It would set all the &quot;e&quot; and &quot;t&quot; then go to the next letter while it was decoding any characters it did not have in memory. If there was a size, width or font change the characters would have to be recalculated. It is extremely fast and was one of the first low-cost output systems. The 8400 used up to 12-inch photographic paper and could set camera-ready output. It was a cost reduced version of the 8600 which was faster. The 8600 came standard CRT width of 45 picas and wide width of 68 picas. The 8600 had much more computing power than the 8400 but did not have the memory to store a lot of characters so they were decoded on the fly. The unit would set the characters line at a time as long as they fit on the CRT. Small type may be set 6 to 8 lines before the photo paper was advanced. The paper advance was much faster than the 8400 CRT move or 8400 paper advance. All the fonts were stored on a hard disk. 8600 was a big step forward from the Video Setters which ended with the Video Setter V. Video setter was much like a closed circuit TV system that looked at a character on a glass grid, read its width and then scanned the character onto the photographic paper. The scan rate on the paper was fixed but the scan rate from the grid was changed to account for character size. If the vertical scan from the grid was slowed the character on the paper would be larger. Video Setters were almost all newspaper machines and limited to 45 picas wide with a maximum character size of 72 pints. It was a lot slower than the 8600.
For a fast typesetter at the time, the APS 5 from AutoLogic was hard to beat. It had a 64-speed paper advance and did not stop to set type. It figured what needed to be set in a band of data and matched the electronic advance to the mechanical advance. If there were parts of a character that were not included in the band of printing it would be printed in the next band or the band after that. The printing scan rate had to be held constant to prevent overexposing or underexposing the type. White space was not scanned but the beam would jump to the next black position. If it was working on a narrow column the paper speed was faster and if it was on a wide set of columns the paper speed was decreased With this technology characters larger than the CRT imaging area were printed. It would print about 4000 newspaper column lines per minute whether it was 1 column at 4000 lines or 4 columns at 1000 lines each.

As phototypesetting machines matured as a technology in the 1970s, more efficient methods were found for creating and subsequently editing text intended for the printed page. Previously, hot-metal typesetting equipment had incorporated a built-in keyboard, such that the machine operator would create both the original text and the medium (lead type slugs) that would create the printed page. Subsequent editing of this copy required that the entire process be repeated. The operator would re-keyboard some or all of the original text, incorporating the corrections and new material into the original draft.

CRT-based editing terminals, which can work compatibly with a variety of phototypesetting machines, were a major technical innovation in this regard. Keyboarding the original text on a CRT screen, with easy-to-use editing commands, is faster than keyboarding on a Linotype machine. Storing the text magnetically for easy retrieval and subsequent editing also saves time.

An early developer of CRT-based editing terminals for photocomposition machines was Omnitext of Ann Arbor, Michigan. These CRT phototypesetting terminals were sold under the Singer brand name during the 1970s.

==== Transition to computers ====

Early machines have no text storage capability; some machines only display 32 characters in uppercase on a small LED screen and spell-checking is not available.

Proofing typeset galleys is an important step after developing the photo paper. Corrections can be made by typesetting a word or line of type and by waxing the back of the galleys, and corrections can be cut out with a razor blade and pasted on top of any mistakes.

Since most early phototypesetting machines can only create one column of type at a time, long galleys of type were pasted onto layout boards in order to create a full page of text for magazines and newsletters. Paste-up artists played an important role in creating production art. Later phototypesetters have multiple column features that allow the typesetter to save paste-up time.

Early digital typesetting programs were designed to drive phototypesetters, most notably the Graphic Systems CAT phototypesetter that troff was designed to provide input for. Though such programs still exist, their output is no longer targeted at any specific form of hardware.
Some companies, such as TeleTypesetting Co. created software and hardware interfaces between personal computers like the Apple II and IBM PS/2 and phototypesetting machines which provided computers equipped with it the capability to connect to phototypesetting machines.
With the start of desktop publishing software, Trout Computing in California introduced VepSet, which allows Xerox Ventura Publisher to be used as a front end and wrote a Compugraphic MCS disk with typesetting codes to reproduce the page layout.

In retrospect, cold type paved the way for the vast range of modern digital fonts, with the lighter weight of equipment allowing far larger families than had been possible with metal type. However, modern designers have noted that compromises of cold type, such as altered designs, made the transition to digital when a better path might have been to return to the traditions of metal type. Adrian Frutiger, who in his early career redesigned many fonts for phototype, noted that &quot;the fonts [I redrew] don’t have any historical worth...to think of the sort of aberrations I had to produce in order to see a good result on Lumitype! V and W needed huge crotches in order to stay open. I nearly had to introduce serifs in order to prevent rounded-off corners – instead of a sans-serif the drafts were a bunch of misshapen sausages!&quot;

<doc id="746470" wikidata="Q2754778" url="?curid=746470" title="Thomas Sandby">
<text>Thomas Sandby (1721 – 25 June 1798) was an English draughtsman, watercolour artist, architect and teacher. In 1743 he was appointed private secretary to the Duke of Cumberland, who later appointed him Deputy Ranger of Windsor Great Park, where he was responsible for considerable landscaping work.

Along with his younger brother Paul, he was one of the founding members of the Royal Academy in 1768, and was its first professor of architecture. His most notable architectural work was the Freemason&#x27;s Hall in London (now demolished).

==Life and work==

===Early years===
Sandby was born in Nottingham, the son of Thomas Sandby, a textile worker, and was self-taught as a draughtsman and architect. Paul Sandby was his brother.
According to the autobiography of the architect James Gandon, Thomas and his brother Paul ran a drawing academy in Nottingham before they went to London in 1741, to take up employment in the military drawing department at the Tower of London (a post procured for them by John Plumptre, MP for Nottingham). Another source says that Thomas &quot;initially&quot; went to London for the purpose of having one of his pictures – a view of Nottingham – engraved.

===Employment by the Duke of Cumberland===
In 1743 Sandby was appointed private secretary and draughtsman to William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, and accompanied him in his campaigns in Flanders and Scotland (1743–1748). Sandby was at the Battle of Dettingen in 1743. Pasquin says that he was appointed draughtsman to the chief engineer of Scotland, in which capacity he was at Fort William in the highlands when Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender, landed and was the first person to convey intelligence of the event to the government in 1745.

Sandby accompanied Cumberland in his expeditions against the rebels, and made a sketch of the Battle of Culloden, together with three panoramic views of Fort Augustus and the surrounding scenery, showing the encampments, in 1746, and a drawing of the triumphal arch erected in St. James&#x27;s Park to commemorate the victories. In this year the Duke was appointed ranger of Windsor Great Park, and selected Sandby to be deputy ranger. Sandby again accompanied the duke to the Netherlands during the War of the Austrian Succession, and probably remained there till the conclusion of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in October 1748. He drew four views of the camps in the Low Countries, covering extensive tracts of country, and another inscribed &#x27;Abbaye près de Sarlouis&#x27;.

Sandby continued to draw a salary from the Board of Ordnance, and this, together with his appointment as deputy ranger of Windsor Great Park, which he held till his death, placed Sandby in a position of independence, and afforded scope for his talent both as an artist and as an architect. The Great Lodge (now known as Cumberland Lodge) was enlarged under his supervision as a residence for the Duke. The lower lodge was occupied by himself. His time was now principally spent in extensive alterations of the park, and in the formation of the Virginia Water Lake, in which he was assisted by his younger brother, Paul, who came to live with him. In 1754, Thomas made eight drawings of the lake which were engraved on copper by Paul Sandby and other engravers and dedicated to the Duke of Cumberland. They were republished by John Boydell in 1772. George III, who took great interest in the undertaking, honoured Sandby with his confidence and personal friendship, and on the death of Cumberland in 1765, the king&#x27;s brother, Henry Frederick (also Duke of Cumberland, and ranger of the park), retained Sandby as deputy.

===Artist and professor of architecture===

Although devoted to his work at Windsor and preferring a retired life, Sandby spent part of each year in London. He rented a house in Great Marlborough Street from 1760 to 1766. He was on the committee of the St. Martin&#x27;s Lane Academy, which issued a pamphlet in 1755 proposing the formation of an academy of art, and he exhibited drawings at the Society of Artists&#x27; exhibition in 1767, and afterwards for some years at the Royal Academy. Both he and his brother Paul were among the 28 original members of the Royal Academy who were nominated by George III in 1768. He was elected Academy&#x27;s first professor of architecture, delivering the first of a series of six lectures in that capacity on 8 October 1770. He continued these lectures with alterations and additions annually till his death. They were never published, but the manuscripts were held in the library of the Royal Institute of British Architects. The illustrations were sold with his other drawings after his death.

===Architect===

In February 1769 Sandby entered a competition to design the Royal Exchange at Dublin, winning third prize of £40. Perhaps his most notable architectural commission was the design of the (first) Freemason&#x27;s Hall at Great Queen Street in central London, linking two houses purchased by the United Grand Lodge of England The building was opened with great ceremony on 23 May 1776, when the title of &#x27;Grand Architect&#x27; was conferred on him by the Freemasons. The Hall was extended in the 1820s by Sir John Soane, but was demolished in 1930 after suffering irreparable structural damage in a fire in 1883.

Sandby designed a carved oak altar-screen for St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, and a stone bridge over the Thames at Staines, opened in 1796, but removed a few years afterwards on account of its insecurity. He built several houses in the neighbourhood of Windsor, including St Leonard&#x27;s Hill for the Duchess of Gloucester, and one for a Colonel Deacon, later known as &quot;Holly Grove&quot;. Designs exist for many others of his architectural works which cannot now be identified. In 1777 he was appointed, jointly with James Adam, architect of his majesty&#x27;s works, and in 1780 master-carpenter of his majesty&#x27;s works in England.

===Family===
Sandby was twice married. The name of his first wife is stated to have been Schultz. He married his second wife, Elizabeth Venables (1733–82), on 26 April 1753. She had a dowry of £2,000, and bore him ten children, six of whom (five daughters and one son) survived him. In his will, and in some simple verses addressed to his daughters after their mother&#x27;s death, he named only four daughters, Harriott, Charlotte, Maria, and Ann, omitting his eldest girl, Elizabeth, who was twice married, and is said to have died in about 1809. His daughter Harriott married (1786) Thomas Paul, the second son of his brother Paul, and kept house for her father after her mother&#x27;s death. Eight of her thirteen children were born at the deputy ranger&#x27;s lodge.

===Death===
Sandby died at the deputy ranger&#x27;s lodge in Windsor Park on Monday, 25 June 1798, and was buried in the churchyard of Old Windsor.

===Legacy===
Though he was self-educated as an architect, and left few buildings by which his capacity can be tested, the Freemasons&#x27; Hall showed no ordinary taste, while of his skill as an engineer and landscape-gardener Windsor Great Park and Virginia Water are a permanent record. He was an excellent and versatile draughtsman, and so skilful in the use of watercolour that his name deserves to be associated with that of his brother Paul in the history of that branch of art.

==Early life and education==
Geraldine Leigh Chaplin was born on July 31, 1944, in Santa Monica, California, the fourth child of actor and filmmaker Charlie Chaplin, and the first child of his fourth wife, Oona O&#x27;Neill, whom he married in 1943. Charlie Chaplin was 55 when Geraldine Chaplin was born and Oona was 19 years old. Geraldine was the first of their eight children. Her paternal grandparents were English Charles Chaplin Sr. and Hannah Chaplin (born Hannah Harriet Pedlingham Hill), and her maternal grandparents were Nobel and Pulitzer Prize-winning Irish-American playwright Eugene O&#x27;Neill and English-born writer Agnes Boulton.

When Geraldine was eight years old, her father took the family on vacation to Britain and Europe. Two days after the family set sail, the U.S. Attorney General James P. McGranery signed an order refusing Chaplin permission to re-enter the country. Chaplin&#x27;s father moved the family to Switzerland. She attended boarding school there, where she became fluent in French and Spanish. Also in this time period, Geraldine appeared in her father&#x27;s film &quot;Limelight&quot; (1952).

==Career==

===Dance and modeling===
At 17 years of age, Chaplin decided to forgo college to pursue dance instead, and studied ballet for two years in England, including a period in 1961 at the Royal Ballet School. She then danced professionally for a year in Paris. Although a good dancer, she felt she had not trained from an early enough age to excel at it and so gave up ballet.

Chaplin then found work as a fashion model in Paris. She was then discovered by David Lean.

===Early acting, 1965–1969===
When her dream of becoming a ballet dancer ended, Chaplin followed her father into what was to become a prolific acting career. She came to prominence in the role of Tonya in David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965). Lean chose her to play the main character&#x27;s wife, for which she received a Golden Globe Award nomination in the category, &quot;Most Promising Female Newcomer&quot;. In an interview to publicize the film, she explained, &quot;Because of my name, the right doors opened.&quot;
In 1967, she made her Broadway debut in Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;. Her performance was praised by Clive Barnes in a &quot;New York Times&quot; review, where he noted that Chaplin &quot;acts with spirit and force... with a magnificently raw-voiced sincerity&quot; giving a performance of &quot;surprising power&quot;.

She also started what would become a major collaboration that year, starring in Spanish film director Carlos Saura&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;Peppermint Frappé&quot; (1967).

===&quot;The Hawaiians&quot; through &quot;Cría Cuervos&quot;, 1970–1979===
Chaplin starred alongside Charlton Heston in the American historical film &quot;The Hawaiians&quot; (1970).
Chaplin then appeared in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1973), and &quot;Nefertiti y Aquenatos&quot; (1973) of Raúl Araiza in which she played the role of ancient Egyptian queen Nefertiti alongside Egyptian movie star Salah Zulfikar, as well as the sequel, &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot; (1974). Chaplin was cast as the obnoxious BBC reporter Opal in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Nashville&quot; (1975), for which she received her second Golden Globe nomination, for Best Supporting Actress. She went on to star in the Altman films &quot;Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull&#x27;s History Lesson&quot; (1976), and then &quot;A Wedding&quot; (1978), doing &quot;Roseland&quot; (1977) in between.Chaplin later occasionally co-wrote scripts for and starred in several later Saura films—for these, receiving her greatest critical success such as &quot;Ana and the Wolves&quot; (1973), &quot;Cría Cuervos&quot; (1976), &quot;Elisa, vida mía&quot; (1977), and &quot;Mamá cumple cien años&quot; (1979). &quot;Cría Cuervos&quot; won the Special Jury Prize Award at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival. Critic Vincent Canby praised Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;superb&quot; performance.

Chaplin starred in several films produced by Altman and directed by Alan Rudolph, with a BAFTA-nominated role in &quot;Welcome to L.A.&quot; (1976), in which she played a housewife addicted to cab rides. She received critical acclaim for her role in &quot;Remember My Name&quot; (1978), in which she played Anthony Perkins&#x27; murderous estranged wife.

In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1977, Chaplin cited that her career was going more successfully in Europe than in the United States. She complained that &quot;I only seem to work with Altman here ... I don&#x27;t have any offers in this country, none. Not even an interesting script to read. The only person who ever asks me is Altman—and James Ivory.&quot;

===French-language and other roles, 1980–1989===

In the 1980s, Chaplin starred in several French-language roles, including Claude Lelouch&#x27;s &quot;Les Uns et les Autres&quot; (1981), Alain Resnais&#x27; &quot;Life Is a Bed of Roses&quot; (1983), Jacques Rivette&#x27;s experimental &quot;Love on the Ground&quot; (1984), and then the American film, &quot;I Want to Go Home&quot; (1989).

Chaplin also starred in Rudolph&#x27;s 1920s-set film, &quot;The Moderns&quot; (1988).

===&quot;Chaplin&quot;, Scorsese, and Zeffirelli, 1990–1999===
In the biographical film about her father, &quot;Chaplin&quot; (1992), she played her grandmother Hannah Chaplin, for which she was nominated for her third Golden Globe Award. Soon after, she was directed by Martin Scorsese in &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (1993), and appeared in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s version of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1996).

Chaplin went on to appear in &quot;Mother Teresa: In the Name of God&#x27;s Poor&quot; (1997).

===The Spanish period, 2000–present===

Chaplin received a Goya Mejor Actriz de Reparto for her role in Spanish-Argentine thriller &quot;En la ciudad sin límites&quot; (&quot;In the City Without Limits&quot;, 2002). Other notable Spanish films she collaborated with and appeared in Pedro Almodóvar&#x27;s &quot;Talk to Her&quot; (2002), and Juan Antonio Bayona&#x27;s &quot;The Orphanage&quot; (2007), for which she received a second Goya Award nomination. She also starred in the Catalan drama, &quot;The Mosquito Net&quot; (2010), for which she was awarded the Crystal Globe.

In 2006 Chaplin was awarded the gold medal by the Academia de las Artes y las Ciencias Cinematográficas de España—the Spanish Academy of Cinematographic Arts and Sciences—for her contribution to Spanish cinema.

Chaplin appeared in &quot;The Wolfman&quot;, in 2010.

In &quot;Americano&quot;, she appeared with Salma Hayek, and featured with Jane Fonda in &quot;All Together&quot; (both 2011).

<doc id="746476" wikidata="Q598044" url="?curid=746476" title="Day of the Daleks">
<text>Day of the Daleks is the first serial of the ninth season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in four weekly parts from 1 to 22 January 1972. It was the first of four Third Doctor serials to feature the Daleks, which returned to the series for the first time since &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; (1967).

In the serial, the Doctor and UNIT investigate the attempted assassination of British diplomat Sir Reginald Styles, whose attacker apparently disappeared into thin air.

==Plot==
A British diplomat, Sir Reginald Styles, is organising a peace conference to avert World War III. 
In his study at Auderly House he is held at gunpoint by a soldier wielding a futuristic looking pistol, who then mysteriously vanishes. The shaken Styles believes that he has been visited by a ghost. The Third Doctor, Jo and the Brigadier go to Auderly House to investigate the mystery. The Doctor discovers a crude time machine and an ultrasonic disintegrator gun. He and Jo spend the night at Auderly House to monitor any activity.

The machine turns out to be from the 22nd Century. As the Doctor tries to reactivate the time machine, three rebel fighters – Anat, Boaz, and Shura – appear from the time vortex on a mission to assassinate Styles. It transpires that the rebels come from an alternate future in which a war-ravaged Earth has been enslaved by the Daleks. The outbreak of world war has been attributed to an explosion at the 20th-century peace conference, and the rebels believe that by assassinating Styles, they can alter future events and prevent the Dalek invasion from ever taking place. The Doctor surmises that the rebel attack itself will be the cause of the explosion, and that the rebels are caught up in a time paradox.

The time machine contains a homing device which alerts the Daleks to the Doctor&#x27;s location. They launch an attack, and the ensuing battle shifts back and forth between the 20th and 22nd Centuries. The Doctor and Jo discover a future world of an enslaved society, overseen by a military force of primitive humanoid Ogrons, supervised by a powerful Controller, all under the command of Daleks. After escaping capture, they return to the 20th century, where the Doctor orders UNIT troops to evacuate the peace conference and lure the Daleks into Auderly House. Shura detonates a dalekanium bomb, destroying the house and the invading Daleks, and correcting the course of the future.

The Doctor tells Styles that he must make the conference a success, because they know what will happen in the future if they fail.

==Production==
Working titles for this story included The Ghost Hunters and Years of Doom. As originally written, the serial revolved around the Ogrons instead of the Daleks. It was planned to bring the Daleks back at the end of the season, in a serial called The Daleks in London by Robert Sloman. This plan was dropped when the production staff realised that the show would not have a hook to entice viewers (after the Third Doctor&#x27;s introduction in Season 7 and that of the Master in Season 8), and Sloman&#x27;s serial was allegedly shaping up to be too similar to &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot;. Instead, writer Louis Marks was asked to alter his serial to include the Daleks. Osterley Park was originally proposed as the setting and location for &quot;Day of the Daleks&quot;. The name was changed to Auderly House in the finished programme and renamed Austerly House in the novelisation.

Jon Pertwee, who would later say, &quot;I have never liked the Daleks&quot;, felt that the monsters were very limited and could not understand their popularity. However, he would concede that the publicity which followed the announcement of their return to the series by Barry Letts &quot;was perhaps worth my biting my lip&quot;. On the other hand, he enjoyed working with the story&#x27;s guest cast. He also liked the Ogrons, as unlike the Daleks, their design allowed the actors&#x27; mouths and lips to be seen and thus he felt allowed the actors playing them to &quot;come to grips&quot; with their characters and &quot;with an entire range of expressions available&quot; make the viewers believe in their performance. Pertwee also recalled he persuaded Barry Letts to include the trikes seen in the story, reflecting his love of vehicles. However he considered the chase sequence involving them to be &quot;one of the more dangerous stunts that I had insisted on doing&quot; during his time on the series. 
Terry Nation, who penned the first story &quot;The Daleks&quot; in 1963, was given an on-screen credit at the end of all four episodes of this story as having originated them. The production team only had three Dalek props available for use during the production of this serial, so only three Daleks appear on screen at any one time. One of the Daleks is painted gold, so only two regular casings are seen in shot. Film editing is used to attempt the illusion of more than three Daleks. The final battle at Auderly House was disliked by viewers, as it was quite obvious that only three Daleks were attacking. On the 2011 DVD release, CGI and newly shot footage was used to revamp the scene, making it appear that more Daleks were attacking the house.

Early in the first episode, there is a scene where the Doctor and Jo are working on the TARDIS console in the Doctor&#x27;s lab. A mistake by the Doctor causes another Doctor and Jo to briefly appear at the entrance to the lab and then vanish. Originally the serial was to end with a scene where the Doctor and Jo went back to the lab, and saw their earlier selves working on the TARDIS console as before, after which &quot;they&quot; would vanish. However, director Paul Bernard refused to film it, saying &quot;Once it&#x27;s over, it&#x27;s over&quot;. Script editor Terrance Dicks would later restore the scene in his novelisation of the story. This story features the TARDIS console once more outside of the TARDIS itself, as in &quot;The Ambassadors of Death&quot; and &quot;Inferno&quot;.

This serial is unusual because episodes two and three begin with the cliffhanger music that ended the previous episode being played again.

===Filming locations===
Dropmore House was instead used as the location for the peace conference. Brentford Towers in Green Dragon Lane, Brentford was used to portray the Controller&#x27;s futuristic base.

===Cast notes===
Scott Fredericks later played Max Stael in &quot;Image of the Fendahl&quot; (1977).

Jimmy Winston had previously been the keyboard player in the rock band Small Faces.

==Broadcast and reception==
The story was edited and condensed into a single omnibus edition for broadcast on BBC1 at 7 pm on 3 September 1973, with viewing figures of 7.4 million.

Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), &quot;A clever (if unoriginal) idea which is spoiled by the pointless inclusion of the Daleks themselves. The series&#x27; first proper look at some of the complexities of time travel is handled well even if some of the international politics is moronic.&quot; In 2009, Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; awarded it four stars out of five. He noted that the Daleks were not at their best production-wise, but he praised the Ogrons, Pertwee, and the cliffhangers. While he acknowledged the production shortcomings of the final battle, he summed the story up as &quot;pacey, thought-provoking entertainment [that] has stood the test of time better than some of its contemporaries&quot;. In &quot;Doctor Who: The Complete Guide&quot;, Mark Campbell awarded it nine out of ten, describing it as an &quot;intelligently scripted &quot;Terminator&quot; prototype&quot; with a &quot;credible future world and an effective documentary-style approach to much of the present-day action.&quot; However, he believed that the downside was that &quot;the Daleks seem oddly static&quot;.

DVD Talk&#x27;s John Sinnott gave &quot;Day of the Daleks&quot; four out of five stars, writing that it &quot;has everything&quot; and that the time travel plot was refreshingly traditional science fiction. Ian Berriman of &quot;SFX&quot; also rated the serial four out of five stars, describing it as &quot;a fascinating concept, played out as rollicking action-adventure&quot;. He wrote that its weaknesses were &quot;mainly on a technical level&quot;, concerning the Daleks and the final battle. In 2018, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ranked &quot;Day of the Daleks&quot; at number 53 in &quot;the 56 greatest stories and episodes&quot;, arguing that &quot;the Daleks&#x27; apelike henchmen, the Ogrons, are well-designed and Jon Pertwee&#x27;s Doctor runs the full gamut from one-man wine and cheese society to man of action, to stern authority in his scenes in the 22nd century&quot;.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

The novelisation of this serial, by Dicks, was published by Target Books in April 1974. There have been Dutch, Turkish, Japanese, Polish and Portuguese language editions. A Brazilian edition, separate from the Portuguese version, was published with the title &quot;Doutor Who e a Mudança da História&quot; (&quot;Doctor Who and the Change in History&quot;).

===Home media===
This is the earliest story for which all the original PAL 2&quot; videotapes exist. The story was first released on VHS and Betamax in an omnibus format in 1986 (with the story mistitled as &quot; The Day of the Daleks&quot; on the VHS box art) and re-released in episodic format in 1994. The previous VHS omnibus edition remained as the release for the United States and Canada. This story was released on LaserDisc twice, first in an omnibus format in the United States in 1992, and later in episodic format in the UK in 1996. A DVD was released on 12 September 2011. The 2-disc DVD contains both the original broadcast version and, on the second disc, a special edition version with new CGI effects, newly shot footage and new Dalek voices performed by Nicholas Briggs, who has provided the Dalek voices for the series since the 2005 relaunch. The DVD features included an audio commentary, on-screen text notes, a documentary &quot;Blasting the Past&quot; in which the cast and crew, as well as fans of the series who are now writers, looked back over the making of the serial. In March 2023, the story was released again in an upgraded format for Blu-ray, being included with the four other stories from Season 9 in the &quot;Doctor Who - The Collection&quot; Box Set.

==Legacy==
John Byrne has stated that he unconsciously lifted the basic plot of &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; from &quot;Day of the Daleks&quot;.

<text>Bernhard Rudolf Abeken (1 December 1780 – 24 February 1866) was a German philologist and literature historian.

==Life==
Abeken was born in Osnabrück. His father was a Catholic merchant, who was much religious for his family. Thus, Bernhard Abeken, who was an avid reader since being five years old, started reading religious and historical literature.

After finishing college in 1799, Abeken went to the University of Jena to study theology, and also began with philosophy and general studies. While in Jena, he often visited the house of Johann Jakob Griesbach where he had the opportunity to meet with famous German poets. This led him soon to abandon his initial career aspiration and to engage in newer literature and general education. In 1802, he became teacher in the house of minister von der Recke, in Berlin. There, Abeken studied further science and arts. In 1808 he went to Weimar to educate Schiller&#x27;s children. In Jena, Berlin, Weimar, and Rudolstadt, these were Abeken&#x27;s most active years within intellectual circles.

In 1810 he became vice headmaster at the college of Rudolstadt. Five years later, he answered the call to the college of Osnabrück, also as its vice headmaster, there to start a series of reforms. In 1841 he became headmaster. Abeken retired in 1863, but nevertheless continued to teach about Sophocles and Cicero till his death in 1866.

Bernhard is the father of two famous sons, Hermann Abelen and Wilhelm Ludwig Abelen.

== Works ==
Bernhard Abeken studied the history of literature, specially when reviewing.

Abeken held lectures on Dante Alighieri, in Rudolstadt (1814–1815) and Berlin (1808). He disliked seeking allegories in the Divine Comedy, instead looking for more ethical and religious interpretations.

<doc id="746481" wikidata="Q637766" url="?curid=746481" title="Marie Jules César Savigny">
<text>Marie Jules César Lelorgne de Savigny (; 5 April 1777 – 5 October 1851) was a French zoologist and naturalist who served on Emperor Napoleon&#x27;s Egypt expedition in 1798. He published descriptions of numerous taxa and was among the first to propose that the mouth-parts of insects are derived from the jointed legs of segmented arthropods.

== Life and work ==
Savigny was born at Provins to Jean-Jacques Lelorgne de Savigny and Françoise Josèphe de Barbaud. He was educated at the Collège des Oratoriens in classical languages with a view to becoming a priest, but learned a bit of botany and the use of microscope. He then studied with a local apothecary when he passed an exam to study in Paris at the École de Santé (school of health) in 1793. He also attended lectures at the Muséum d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle where he was noticed by Lamarck. Georges Cuvier suggested that he join an expedition. In 1798 he travelled to Egypt under the sponsorship of Emperor Napoleon as part of the French scientific expedition to that country and returned in 1802. He then contributed to the publication of the findings of the expedition from 1809 (&quot;Description de l&#x27;Égypte&quot;; published more fully in 1822). He wrote about the fauna in the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea.

=== Education and travel to Egypt ===
At age 16, Savigny traveled from his home of Provins, in the department of Seine et Marne, to Paris to finish his studies. Being very interested in botany, he attended lectures at the &quot;Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle&quot; with Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Georges Cuvier. Cuvier suggested to Napoleon that the 21-year-old Savigny should follow him as zoologist to Egypt. Savigny became responsible for studying invertebrates, while Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire took care of the vertebrates. After returning to Paris, in 1802, Savigny started to work on the large collections from Egypt, producing a number of manuscripts and plates. In 1805 he published &quot;Histoire naturelle et mythologique de l&#x27;ibis&quot; (Natural and mythological history of the ibis).

As a botanist he described the genus &quot;Bruguiera&quot; () and numerous plants including algae.

=== Later years ===

By 1817, Savigny&#x27;s eyesight had deteriorated, and he suffered from a nervous affliction and had to stop working for a number of years. Between 1816 and 1820 he published the important &quot;Mémoires sur les animaux sans vertèbres&quot; (Memoires on the animals without vertebrae). He had examined flowers and their parts as a botanist and applied the same approach to the details of insects. He compared the mouthparts of lepidoptera, those of crustaceans, arthropods (like the horseshoe crab) and came up with the theory (&quot;Theorie de la bouche&quot;) that there were homologies among them. He suggested in 1816 that there was a common plan. This idea was influenced others including Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. After he returned to work in 1822, his eyesight continued to worsen, and by 1824 he became more-or-less blind, with terrible &quot;optical hallucinations&quot;. Victor Audouin offered to complete Savigny&#x27;s work but Savigny refused to part with the original artwork. Savigny was elected member of the Academy of Science on 30 July 1821. From 1824 to until his death he lived a reclusive life in Versailles.

<doc id="746483" wikidata="Q3365273" url="?curid=746483" title="Republican in name only">
<text>In US politics, &quot;Republican in name only&quot; is a pejorative used to describe politicians of the Republican Party deemed insufficiently loyal to the party, or misaligned with the party&#x27;s ideology. Similar terms have been used since the early 1900s. The acronym RINO became popular in the 1990s, and both the acronym and the full spelling have become commonly used by sitting President Donald Trump and his supporters to refer to his critics within the Republican Party.

==Origins==
The phrase &quot;Republican in name only&quot; emerged as a popular political pejorative in the 1920s, 1950s, and 1980s.

The earliest known print appearance of the acronym &quot;RINO&quot; was in 1992 in the Manchester, New Hampshire, newspaper then called &quot;The Union Leader&quot;. RINO is pronounced like the word &quot;rhino&quot;, and can be used to associate disloyal Republicans with the large, thick-skinned animal.

Buttons featuring a red slash through an image of a rhinoceros were spotted in the New Hampshire State House as early as 1992. In 1993, future California Republican Assembly President Celeste Greig distributed buttons featuring a red slash over the word &quot;RINO&quot; to express opposition to Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan. The term came into widespread usage during subsequent election cycles.

==Usage==
During Republican primary campaign season, some conservative organizations target Republicans who fail to adopt their stances by referring to them as RINOs. A &quot;RINO Hunters Club&quot; formed by the National Federation of Republican Assemblies has taken political action against those they considered RINOs. The fiscally conservative 501(c)4 organization Club for Growth started the &quot;RINO Watch&quot; list to monitor &quot;Republican office holders around the nation who have advanced egregious anti-growth, anti-freedom or anti-free market policies&quot;; other conservative groups published similar lists.

=== Donald Trump ===
Donald Trump and his closest supporters have frequently used the term to describe anyone within the Republican Party he deems to be disloyal. During the 2020 presidential election in the United States, Donald Trump used the term to refer to Georgia governor, Brian Kemp, and Georgia Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, due to their refusal to challenge the election results in Georgia during his attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. He also used the term to refer to Maryland governor Larry Hogan in a tweet, as well as House and Senate Republicans who either voted to impeach and convict him during his second impeachment following the January 6 United States Capitol attack or who voted for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill supported by President Joe Biden. Recently, the term has been used to describe Republican critics of former President Donald Trump, with Trump himself tweeting that Congressional Republicans who recognized Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 US Presidential election are RINOs. Some Republicans critical of Trump occasionally used the epithet to describe Trump himself, due to his history as a registered Democrat.

After former Secretary of State Colin Powell died in 2021, Trump described him as a &quot;classic RINO&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrison_10/18/2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After former Vice President Dick Cheney endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, Trump referred him as an &quot;irrelevant RINO&quot;.

After Tom Emmer failed to get the nomination to Speaker of the House, Trump blasted him as a RINO before the press and on Truth Social. Four hours after the failed vote, Emmer withdrew the nomination and lost.

==Similar terms==
The concept of being an inauthentic member of the Republican Party by not representing its more conservative faction is a recurring theme in party history.
===Me-too Republicans===

In the 1930s and 1940s, the term &quot;Me-too Republicans&quot; described those running on a platform of agreeing with the Democratic Party, proclaiming only minor or moderating philosophical differences. An example is two-time presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey, who ran against the popular Franklin D. Roosevelt and his successor Harry Truman. Dewey did not oppose Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal programs altogether, but merely campaigned on the promise that Republicans would run them more efficiently and less corruptly.

From 1936 to 1976, the more centrist members of the Republican Party frequently won the national nomination with candidates such as Alf Landon, Wendell Willkie, Thomas E. Dewey, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Gerald Ford. The mainstream of the Republican Party was generally supportive of the New Deal. In the 1950s, conservatives such as Robert A. Taft and Barry Goldwater, who rallied against &quot;me-too Republicans&quot;, were considered outside of the mainstream; serious consideration was given to leaving the then GOP and forming a new ultra-conservative party in coalition with the &quot;states&#x27; rights&quot; Democrats of the South.

===Nixonians and Rockefeller Republicans===
In the 1960s and 1970s, Republicans considered liberal on economic issues but hawkish on foreign policy and social issues were sometimes called &quot;Nixonian&quot;, or &quot;Rockefeller Republicans&quot;.

===Gypsy moth Republican===
In the 1980s, the term &quot;gypsy moth Republican&quot; described Republicans from the Northeast and Midwest who voted against the Ronald Reagan administration&#x27;s proposed cuts in aid to economically distressed people, contrasting with boll weevil Democrats, who voted for these cuts. The gypsy moth is an invasive species destructive to trees in the Northeastern United States.

===Cuckservative===
In 2015 the term &quot;cuckservative&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;cuckold&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot;, was popularized on the online forum 4chan, and embraced by both internet trolls and the nativist alt-right. The metaphorical &quot;&quot; is represented in a genre of interracial pornography as a masochistic white husband who allows his wife to have sex with a stronger black man, thereby participating in his own symbolic emasculation. In white supremacist vernacular, the term is an accusation of yielding to non-white interests on issues such as immigration or modern display of the Confederate flag; however, the term gained use (with some controversy) by more mainstream conservatives to denounce Republicans whose compromises included vote trading, rhetorical restraint in deference to donors, cooperation with Democrats on any particular initiative, or attempting to court voters by making appeals to supposedly liberal ideals.

<text>A bioreactor is any manufactured device or system that supports a biologically active environment. In one case, a bioreactor is a vessel in which a chemical process is carried out which involves organisms or biochemically active substances derived from such organisms. This process can either be aerobic or anaerobic. These bioreactors are commonly cylindrical, ranging in size from litres to cubic metres, and are often made of stainless steel.

It may also refer to a device or system designed to grow cells or tissues in the context of cell culture. These devices are being developed for use in tissue engineering or biochemical/bioprocess engineering.

On the basis of mode of operation, a bioreactor may be classified as batch, fed batch or continuous (e.g. a continuous stirred-tank reactor model). An example of a continuous bioreactor is the chemostat.

Organisms or biochemically active substances growing in bioreactors may be submerged in liquid medium or may be anchored to the surface of a solid medium. Submerged cultures may be suspended or immobilized. Suspension bioreactors may support a wider variety of organisms, since special attachment surfaces are not needed, and can operate at a much larger scale than immobilized cultures. However, in a continuously operated process the organisms will be removed from the reactor with the effluent. Immobilization is a general term describing a wide variety of methods for cell or particle attachment or entrapment. It can be applied to basically all types of
biocatalysis including enzymes, cellular organelles, animal and plant cells and organs. Immobilization is useful for continuously operated processes, since the organisms will not be removed with the reactor effluent, but is limited in scale because the microbes are only present on the surfaces of the vessel.

Large scale immobilized cell bioreactors are: 
*moving media, also known as moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR)
*packed bed
*fibrous bed
*membrane

==Design==

Bioreactor design is a relatively complex engineering task, which is studied in the discipline of biochemical/bioprocess engineering. Under optimum conditions, the microorganisms or cells are able to perform their desired function with limited production of impurities. The environmental conditions inside the bioreactor, such as temperature, nutrient concentrations, pH, and dissolved gases (especially oxygen for aerobic fermentations) affect the growth and productivity of the organisms. The temperature of the fermentation medium is maintained by a cooling jacket, coils, or both. Particularly exothermic fermentations may require the use of external heat exchangers. Nutrients may be continuously added to the fermenter, as in a fed-batch system, or may be charged into the reactor at the beginning of fermentation. The pH of the medium is measured and adjusted with small amounts of acid or base, depending upon the fermentation. For aerobic (and some anaerobic) fermentations, reactant gases (especially oxygen) must be added to the fermentation. Since oxygen is relatively insoluble in water (the basis of nearly all fermentation media), air (or purified oxygen) must be added continuously. The action of the rising bubbles helps mix the fermentation medium and also &quot;strips&quot; out waste gases, such as carbon dioxide. In practice, bioreactors are often pressurized; this increases the solubility of oxygen in water. In an aerobic process, optimal oxygen transfer is sometimes the rate limiting step. Oxygen is poorly soluble in water—even less in warm fermentation broths—and is relatively scarce in air (20.95%). Oxygen transfer is usually helped by agitation, which is also needed to mix nutrients and to keep the fermentation homogeneous. Gas dispersing agitators are used to break up air bubbles and circulate them throughout the vessel.

&quot;Fouling&quot; can harm the overall efficiency of the bioreactor, especially the heat exchangers. To avoid it, the bioreactor must be easily cleaned. Interior surfaces are typically made of stainless steel for easy cleaning and sanitation. Typically bioreactors are cleaned between batches, or are designed to reduce fouling as much as possible when operated continuously. Heat transfer is an important part of bioreactor design; small vessels can be cooled with a cooling jacket, but larger vessels may require coils or an external heat exchanger.

==Types==

===Photobioreactor===

A photobioreactor (PBR) is a bioreactor which incorporates some type of light source (that may be natural sunlight or artificial illumination). Virtually any translucent container could be called a PBR, however the term is more commonly used to define a closed system, as opposed to an open storage tank or pond.
Photobioreactors are used to grow small phototrophic organisms such as cyanobacteria, algae, or moss plants. These organisms use light through photosynthesis as their energy source and do not require sugars or lipids as energy
source. Consequently, risk of contamination with other organisms like bacteria or fungi is lower in photobioreactors when compared to bioreactors for heterotroph organisms.

===Sewage treatment===
Conventional sewage treatment utilises bioreactors to undertake the main purification processes. In some of these systems, a chemically inert medium with very high surface area is provided as a substrate for the growth of biological film. Separation of excess biological film takes place in settling tanks or cyclones. In other systems aerators supply oxygen to the sewage and biota to create activated sludge in which the biological component is freely mixed in the liquor in &quot;flocs&quot;. In these processes, the liquid&#x27;s biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is reduced sufficiently to render the contaminated water fit for reuse. The biosolids can be collected for further processing, or dried and used as fertilizer. An extremely simple version of a sewage bioreactor is a septic tank whereby the sewage is left in situ, with or without additional media to house bacteria. In this instance, the biosludge itself is the primary host for the bacteria.

===Bioreactors for specialized tissues===

Many cells and tissues, especially mammalian ones, must have a surface or other structural support in order to grow, and agitated environments are often destructive to these cell types and tissues. Higher organisms, being auxotrophic, also require highly specialized growth media. This poses a challenge when the goal is to culture larger quantities of cells for therapeutic production purposes, and a significantly different design is needed compared to industrial bioreactors used for growing protein expression systems such as yeast and bacteria.

Many research groups have developed novel bioreactors for growing specialized tissues and cells on a structural scaffold, in attempt to recreate organ-like tissue structures &quot;in-vitro&quot;. Among these include tissue bioreactors that can grow heart tissue, skeletal muscle tissue, ligaments, cancer tissue models, and others. Currently, scaling production of these specialized bioreactors for industrial use remains challenging and is an active area of research.

For more information on artificial tissue culture, see tissue engineering.

== Modelling ==
Mathematical models act as an important tool in various bio-reactor applications including wastewater treatment. These models are useful for planning efficient process control strategies and predicting the future plant performance. Moreover, these models are beneficial in education and research areas.

Bioreactors are generally used in those industries which are concerned with food, beverages and pharmaceuticals. The emergence of &quot;biochemical engineering&quot; is of recent origin. Processing of biological materials using biological agents such as cells, enzymes or antibodies are the major pillars of biochemical engineering. Applications of biochemical engineering cover major fields of civilization such as agriculture, food and healthcare, resource recovery and fine chemicals.

Until now, the industries associated with biotechnology have lagged behind other industries in implementing control over the process and optimization strategies. A main drawback in biotechnological process control is the problem of measuring key physical and biochemical parameters.

=== Operational stages in a bio-process ===
A bioprocess is composed mainly of three stages—upstream processing, bioreaction, and downstream processing—to convert raw material to finished product.

The raw material can be of biological or non-biological origin. It is first converted to a more suitable form for processing. This is done in an upstream processing step which involves chemical hydrolysis, preparation of liquid medium, separation of particulate, air purification and many other preparatory operations.

After the upstream processing step, the resulting feed is transferred to one or more bioreaction stages. The biochemical reactors or bioreactors form the base of the bioreaction step. This step mainly consists of three operations, namely, production of biomass, metabolite biosynthesis and biotransformation.

Finally, the material produced in the bioreactor must be further processed in the downstream section to convert it into a more useful form. The downstream process mainly consists of physical separation operations which include solid liquid separation, adsorption, liquid-liquid extraction, distillation, drying etc.

=== Specifications ===
A typical bioreactor consists of following parts:

Agitator – Used for the mixing of the contents of the reactor which keeps the cells in the perfect homogenous condition for better transport of nutrients and oxygen to the desired product(s).

Baffle – Used to break the vortex formation in the vessel, which is usually highly undesirable as it changes the center of gravity of the system and consumes additional power.

Sparger – In aerobic cultivation process, the purpose of the sparger is to supply adequate oxygen to the growing cells.

Jacket – The jacket provides the annular area for circulation of constant temperature of water which keeps the temperature of the bioreactor at a constant value.

<doc id="746496" wikidata="Q4242688" url="?curid=746496" title="Elmira Corning Regional Airport">
<text>Elmira Corning Regional Airport is in Chemung County, New York, northwest of Elmira and east of Corning. It is in the Big Flats census-designated place and in the town of Big Flats, while its mailing address gives the location as Horseheads, New York. The airport was formerly Elmira Regional Airport.

Situated just north of the Southern Tier Expressway (Interstate 86), the airport serves the Southern Tier of New York and Northern Tier of Pennsylvania with airline flights, general aviation, and glider activities. Other airports in the area include Greater Binghamton Airport and Ithaca Tompkins International Airport, with Greater Rochester International Airport and Syracuse Hancock International Airport lying farther afield.

==Facilities==
The airport covers at an elevation of 954 feet (291 m). It has three runways: 6/24 is 8,001 by 150 feet (2,439 x 46 m) asphalt; 10/28 is 5,404 by 150 feet (1,647 x 46 m) asphalt; 5/23 is 2,017 by 150 feet (615 x 46 m) turf.

The airport had three paved runways about 4000 feet long in a north–south, east–west and northeast–southwest orientation in the early years, but the northeast–southwest runway
was 4702 feet in length by 1960, was extended to 5604 feet by the 1960s with later extensions to 7000 feet and 7600 feet before its present length of 8001
feet. The east–west runway was extended to about 5200 feet by the early 1980s and the north–south runway was abandoned and the additional roughly 200 feet of the east–west runway was added by converting part of the overrun on the east end of the runway to usable pavement (for takeoff), but then the landing threshold was displaced about 400 feet.

In the year ending June 30, 2013 the airport had 22,164 aircraft operations, average 61 per day: 51% general aviation, 33% air taxi, 13% airline and 2% military. 33 aircraft were then based at the airport: 52% single-engine, 15% multi-engine, 30% jet, and 3% helicopter. Airport services include free wireless Internet, automatic teller machines (ATM), conference rooms, and a restaurant.

===Airlines===
There were 2 passenger and 3 cargo airlines as of late 2024. The passenger airlines are:
*Allegiant Air
*Delta Connection operated by SkyWest Airlines on behalf of Delta Air Lines

Low-cost carrier Allegiant Air has the only scheduled mainline flights, on Airbus A319s &amp; Airbus A320s. Delta Connection service is flown with Canadair CRJ-200s, CRJ-700s, and CRJ-900s.

Mohawk /Allegheny/USAir flew to Elmira until 2001 when its affiliate took over; Elmira&#x27;s first jets were Mohawk BAC-111s in 1965. The airport had flights on Capital Airlines, which merged with United in 1961; United left Elmira in 1966.

United Airlines regional flights to Chicago-O’hare started in 2014 and ended in 2016. In 2018 United served a new route to Newark. The route was eventually switched to Washington-Dulles; that ended January 6, 2020.

===Fixed-base operators===

There are two FBO&#x27;s (Fixed Base Operators) on the airport that are separate from the commercial airline terminal. These include Atlantic Aviation and Premier Aviation. Both provide with landing fees: Ramp Parking, Fueling, Deicing and Hangar space for general aviation aircraft. Premier Aviation also has specialized maintenance services available.

===Wings of Eagles===
An aviation museum, the &quot;Wings of Eagles Discovery Center&quot;, is near the airport. The museum has about 20 display aircraft or full-size replicas.

===Renovation===
In 2016 the airport received a $40 million grant from the state for a major redesign. The improvements aimed to increase airport passenger space, add two new jet bridges, 300 parking spaces, and a 3,000 square foot bar and restaurant. On November 2, 2018, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the renovations were complete.

<doc id="746497" wikidata="Q1928883" url="?curid=746497" title="Slip (aerodynamics)">
<text>A slip is an aerodynamic state where an aircraft is moving &quot;somewhat&quot; sideways as well as forward relative to the oncoming airflow or relative wind. In other words, for a conventional aircraft, the nose will be pointing in the opposite direction to the bank of the wing(s). The aircraft is not in coordinated flight and therefore is flying inefficiently.

==Background==
Flying in a slip is aerodynamically inefficient, since the lift-to-drag ratio is reduced. More drag is at play consuming energy but not producing lift. Inexperienced or inattentive pilots will often enter slips unintentionally during turns by failing to coordinate the aircraft with the rudder. Airplanes can readily enter into a slip climbing out from take-off on a windy day. If left unchecked, climb performance will suffer. This is especially dangerous if there are nearby obstructions under the climb path and the aircraft is underpowered or heavily loaded.

A slip can also be a &quot;piloting maneuver&quot; where the pilot deliberately enters one type of slip or another. Slips are particularly useful in performing a short field landing over an obstacle (such as trees, or power lines), or to avoid an obstacle (such as a single tree on the extended centerline of the runway), and may be practiced as part of emergency landing procedures. These methods are also commonly employed when flying into farmstead or rough country airstrips where the landing strip is short. Pilots need to touch down with ample runway remaining to slow down and stop.

There are common situations where a pilot may deliberately enter a slip by using opposite rudder and aileron inputs, most commonly in a landing approach at low power.

Without flaps or spoilers it is difficult to increase the steepness of the glide without adding significant speed. This excess speed can cause the aircraft to fly in ground effect for an extended period, perhaps running out of runway. In a forward slip much more drag is created, allowing the pilot to dissipate altitude without increasing airspeed, increasing the angle of descent (glide slope). Forward slips are especially useful when operating pre-1950s training aircraft, aerobatic aircraft such as the Pitts Special or any aircraft with inoperative flaps or spoilers.

Often, if an airplane in a slip is made to stall, it displays very little of the yawing tendency that causes a skidding stall to develop into a spin. A stalling airplane in a slip may do little more than tend to roll into a wings-level attitude. In fact, in some airplanes stall characteristics may even be improved.

==Forward-slip vs. sideslip==
Aerodynamically these are identical once established, but they are entered for different reasons and will create different ground tracks and headings relative to those prior to entry. Forward-slip is used to steepen an approach (reduce height) without gaining much airspeed, benefiting from the increased drag. The sideslip moves the aircraft sideways (often, only in relation to the wind) where executing a turn would be inadvisable, drag is considered a byproduct. Most pilots like to enter sideslip just before flaring or touching down during a crosswind landing.

=== Forward-slip ===
The forward slip changes the heading of the aircraft away from the down wing, while retaining the original &quot;track&quot; (flight path over the ground) of the aircraft.

To execute a forward slip, the pilot banks into the wind and applies opposing rudder (e.g., right aileron + left rudder) in order to keep moving towards the target. If you were the target you would see the plane&#x27;s nose off to one side, a wing off to the other side and tilted down toward you. The pilot must make sure that the plane&#x27;s nose is low enough to keep airspeed up. However, airframe speed limits such as VA and VFE must be observed.

A forward-slip is useful when a pilot has set up for a landing approach with excessive height or must descend steeply beyond a tree line to touchdown near the runway threshold. Assuming that the plane is properly lined up for the runway, the forward slip will allow the aircraft &quot;track&quot; to be maintained while steepening the descent without adding excessive airspeed. Since the heading is not aligned with the runway, forward-slip must be removed before touchdown to avoid excessive side loading on the landing gear, and if a cross wind is present an appropriate sideslip may be necessary at touchdown as described below.

===Sideslip===
The &quot;sideslip&quot; also uses aileron and opposite rudder. In this case it is entered by lowering a wing and applying exactly enough opposite rudder so the airplane does not turn (maintaining the same &quot;heading&quot;), while maintaining safe airspeed with pitch or power. Compared to Forward-slip, less rudder is used: just enough to stop the change in the heading.

In the sideslip condition, the airplane&#x27;s longitudinal axis remains parallel to the original flightpath, but the airplane no longer flies along that track. The horizontal component of lift is directed toward the low wing, drawing the airplane sideways. This is the still-air, headwind or tailwind scenario. In case of crosswind, the wing is lowered into the wind, so that the airplane flies the original track. This is the sideslip approach technique used by many pilots in crosswind conditions (sideslip without slipping). The other method of maintaining the desired track is the crab technique: the wings are kept level, but the nose is pointed (part way) into the crosswind, and resulting drift keeps the airplane on track.

A sideslip may be used exclusively to remain lined up with a runway centerline while on approach in a crosswind or be employed in the final moments of a crosswind landing. To commence sideslipping, the pilot rolls the airplane toward the wind to maintain runway centerline position while maintaining heading on the centerline with the rudder. Sideslip causes one main landing gear to touch down first, followed by the second main gear. This allows the wheels to be constantly aligned with the track, thus avoiding any side load at touchdown.

The sideslip method for crosswind landings is not suitable for long-winged and low-sitting aircraft such as gliders, where instead a crab angle (heading into the wind) is maintained until a moment before touchdown.

Aircraft manufacturer Airbus recommends sideslip approach only in low crosswind conditions.

====Sideslip angle====
The sideslip angle, also called angle of sideslip (AOS, AoS, formula_1, Greek letter beta), is a term used in fluid dynamics and aerodynamics and aviation. It relates to the rotation of the aircraft centerline from the relative wind. In flight dynamics it is given the shorthand notation formula_1 (beta) and is usually assigned to be &quot;positive&quot; when the relative wind is coming from the right of the nose of the airplane. The sideslip angle formula_1 is essentially the directional angle of attack of the airplane. It is the primary parameter in directional stability considerations.

In vehicle dynamics, side slip angle is defined as the angle made by the velocity vector to longitudinal axis of the vehicle at the center of gravity in an instantaneous frame. As the lateral acceleration increases during cornering, the side slip angle decreases. Thus at very high speed turns and small turning radius, there is a high lateral acceleration and formula_1 could be a negative value.

==Other uses of the slip==
There are other, specialized circumstances where slips can be useful in aviation. For example, during aerial photography, a slip can lower one side of the aircraft to allow ground photos to be taken through a side window. Pilots will also use a slip to land in icing conditions if the front windshield has been entirely iced over—by landing slightly sideways, the pilot is able to see the runway through the aircraft&#x27;s side window. Slips also play a role in aerobatics and aerial combat.

==How a slip affects flight==
When an aircraft is put into a forward slip with no other changes to the throttle or elevator, the pilot will notice an increased rate of descent (or reduced rate of &quot;ascent&quot;). This is usually mostly due to increased drag on the fuselage. The airflow over the fuselage is at a sideways angle, increasing the relative frontal area, which increases drag.

<text>Tacloban ( ; ), officially the City of Tacloban (; ), is a highly urbanized city on Leyte island in the Eastern Visayas region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, Tacloban has a population of 251,881, making it the most populous city in the Eastern Visayas. The city is located southeast of Manila.

Tacloban is the regional center of the Eastern Visayas region. It is also the largest city and capital of the province of Leyte, wherein it is geographically situated and grouped under the province by the Philippine Statistics Authority, but the city is governed and administered independently from it.

Tacloban City was briefly the capital of the Philippines under the Commonwealth Government, from October 20, 1944, to February 27, 1945. In an extensive survey conducted by the Asian Institute of Management Policy Center and released in July 2010, Tacloban City ranks as the fifth most competitive city in the Philippines, and second in the emerging cities category. On November 8, 2013, the city was largely destroyed by Typhoon Haiyan, having previously suffered similar destruction and loss of life in 1897 and 1912. On January 17, 2015, Pope Francis visited Tacloban during his Papal Visit to the Philippines and held a mass at Barangay San Jose, and later he led mass of 30,000 people in front of the airport.

==Etymology==
The area got its name from the word &quot;taklub&quot;, a bamboo tray used to catch crabs or shrimp.

==History==


Tacloban was first known as &quot;Kankabatok&quot;, an allusion to the first inhabitants – &quot;Kabatok&quot;. They established their dwellings in the vicinity of the present-day Santo Niño Church. Others who came later were &quot;Gumoda&quot;, &quot;Haraging,&quot; and &quot;Huraw&quot; who erected their settlements on nearby sites. &quot;Huraw&quot;&#x27;s domain is the hill where the city hall now sits. The combined settlements acquired the name &quot;Kankabatok&quot;, meaning &quot;property of &quot;Kabatok″s&quot;.&quot; 

The constant threat of pirates due to its lack of a natural barrier hindered the development and progress of the settlement. And so the place never figured out the early centuries of the Spanish colonization of Leyte. When the Jesuits (the first evangelizers of Leyte) left in 1768, the Augustinians took over, and in 1770 they established the barrio with a chapel (visita) of Tacloban under the jurisdiction of Palo.

The Augustinians who came from the Province of the Holy Name of Jesus based in Cebu were also responsible in introducing the devotion to the Santo Niño becoming therefore the heavenly patron of the settlement. With the Moro raids in check, the place became a hub for commercial activity and soon after the place was renamed Tacloban becoming an independent municipality and then capital of the province of Leyte. In 1843, the Augustinians ceded the administration of the parish to the Franciscans.

The change of the name came about in this manner: &quot;Kankabatok&quot; was a favorite haunt of fishermen. They would use a bamboo contraption called a &quot;taklub&quot; to catch crabs, shrimps or fish. When asked where they were going, the fishermen would answer, &quot;(to) tarakluban&quot;, which meant the place where they used the device to catch these marine resources. Eventually, the name &quot;Tarakluban&quot; or Tacloban took prominence.

It is not known when Tacloban became a municipality because records supporting this fact were destroyed during a typhoon. It is commonly believed that Tacloban was officially proclaimed a municipality in 1770s. In 1768, Leyte and Samar were separated into two provinces, each constituting a politico-military province. Due to its strategic location, Tacloban became a vital trading point between the two provinces.

The capital of Leyte was transferred from one town to another with Tacloban as the last on February 26, 1830. The decision to make Tacloban the capital was based on the following reasons: 1) ideal location of the port and 2) well-sheltered and adequate facilities. On June 20, 1952, Tacloban was proclaimed a chartered city by virtue of Republic Act No. 760.
The arrival of Colonel Arthur Murray in 1901 made him the first military governor of Leyte. His first official act was the opening of Tacloban port to world commerce. Before World War II, Tacloban was the commercial, education, social and cultural center of the Province of Leyte. Copra and abaca were exported in large quantities. The leading institutions were: Leyte Normal School, Leyte High School, Leyte Trade School, Holy Infant Academy and Tacloban Catholic Institute.

In November 1912, a typhoon swept through the central Philippines and &quot;practically destroyed&quot; Tacloban. In Tacloban and Capiz on the island of Panay, the death toll was 15,000, half the population of those cities at the time.

On May 25, 1942, Japanese forces landed in Tacloban, signalling the beginning of their two-year occupation of Leyte. They fortified the city and improved its airfield. Since San Pedro Bay was ideal for larger vessels, the Japanese Imperial Naval Forces made Tacloban a port of call and entry. This time was considered the darkest in the history of Tacloban and the country due to the incidence of torture among civilians, including the elderly. In response, guerrilla groups operated in Leyte – the most notable of which was the group of Nieves Fernandez. The Japanese established a &quot;comfort station&quot; in the city, where they kidnapped local girls, teenagers and young adults who they then forced into becoming sex slaves under the gruesome &quot;comfort women&quot; system.

Leyte was the first to be liberated by the combined Filipino and American troops. General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s assault troops landed in the Tacloban and Palo beaches (White Beach and Red Beach, respectively) and in the neighbouring town of Dulag (Blue Beach) on October 20, 1944. These landings signalled the eventual victory of the Filipino and American forces and the fulfillment of MacArthur&#x27;s famous promise: &quot;I Shall Return.&quot;

Three days later, on October 23, at a ceremony at the Capitol Building in Tacloban, MacArthur, accompanied by President Sergio Osmeña, made Tacloban the temporary seat of the Commonwealth Government and temporary capital of the Philippines until the complete liberation of the country. The provincial government of Leyte and the municipal government of Tacloban were re-established.

Paulo Jaro was the Liberation mayor of Tacloban. The first mayor of this capital upon inauguration of the Philippine Republic was Epifanio Aguirre.

On January 8, 1960, MacArthur made his &quot;sentimental&quot; journey to Leyte. He was greeted with cheers by locals when he visited Tacloban.

The city was proclaimed as a highly urbanized city by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on October 4, 2008 and ratified by the people on December 18, 2008. Tacloban was officially declared an HUC at 10:40PM of that day.

=== 2013 Typhoon Haiyan ===

On November 8, 2013 (PST), Tacloban was hit by the full force of Typhoon Haiyan, causing massive destruction across the city. Dead bodies were scattered on the streets, trees were uprooted, and a storm surge largely destroyed the airport, though it functioned soon after as a makeshift command and evacuation center. After taking a helicopter flight over the city, US Marine Brigadier General Paul Kennedy was quoted as saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe there is a single structure that is not destroyed or severely damaged in some way – every single building, every single house.&quot; Widespread looting and violence is reported to have taken place and local government virtually collapsed, as many city officials were victims. President Aquino declared a state of emergency in Tacloban. The official final death toll stood at 6,201.

=== 2015 Papal visit ===

On January 17, 2015, Pope Francis, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, arrived in Tacloban to celebrate Mass with the survivors of Haiyan &quot;(Yolanda)&quot;. The pope arrived at Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport on a flight operated by Philippine Airlines.

==Geography==
Tacloban is located on the northeastern tip of Leyte Island, with its easternmost part facing Cancabato Bay. The bay is at the east mouth of San Juanico Strait. The Tacloban territory follows the length of the strait, along with Babatngon municipality north of the city. The strait divides the islands of Leyte and Samar.
===Barangays===
Tacloban is politically subdivided into 138 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.


===Climate===
Tacloban has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen: Af) but due to the numerous cyclones present in the area, the climate is not equatorial. Tropical rainforest climates are tropical climates in which there is no dry season – all months have mean precipitation values of at least . Tropical rainforest climates have no pronounced summer or winter; it is typically wet throughout the year and rainfall is both heavy and frequent. One day in an equatorial climate can be very similar to the next, while the change in temperature between day and night may be larger than the average change in temperature between &quot;summer&quot; and &quot;winter&quot;.

The average high (daytime) temperature for the year in Tacloban is . The warmest month on average is May with an average daytime temperature of . The coolest month on average is January and February, with an average (nighttime) temperature of .

The highest recorded temperature was , recorded on April 6, 1924, and in August. The lowest recorded temperature in Tacloban is which was recorded in December.

The average rainfall for the year is , with the most rainfall on average in December with and the least on average in April with .

==Demographics==
According to the 2020 census, Tacloban has a population of 251,881 inhabitants.

Tacloban is predominantly a Waray-speaking city. The language is also officially called &quot;Lineyte-Samarnon&quot; (&quot;Leyte-Samarnon&quot;) and is spoken by more than 90% of the total city population. Waray-Waray, aside from being the native language of the city, is also the lingua franca used in the city among Filipinos of various ethnic groups.

Tacloban is culturally and linguistically diverse. A decade before the end of Spanish sovereignty, it was largely a typical colonial community: most of its residents were either pure Iberian families or the new generations of Spanish-Filipino blood. Today&#x27;s population consists of a mix of Spanish and Chinese mestizos, foreign expatriates and native Leyteños.

Other Filipino ethnic groups who migrated to the city are the Cebuano/Kana/Visayan speaking populace accounts for 6.08% of the total population, 0.80% are Tagalog, 0.10% are Ilocano, 0.07% are Kapampangan, and 2.95% come from other ethnic origins, including Hiligaynon, Maguindanaon, Maranao and Tausug.

88.52% of the residents of Tacloban City are Roman Catholic; 6.12% are Muslims (most are Maranao migrants from Mindanao); 0.83% are of the indigenous Christian denomination, Iglesia ni Cristo; 0.94% are Evangelicals (born-again Christians); Baptists 0.80%; 0.49% Seventh-Day Adventists. Others comprise 3.10%.

==Economy==

Tacloban is the economic center of the entire Eastern Visayas, with an economy largely focused on agriculture, commerce, and tourism. Proximal to the city proper is the 237-hectare Eastern Visayas Agri-Industrial Growth Center (EVRGC), which was approved and accredited by the Philippine Economic Zone Authority by virtue of Presidential Proclamation No. 1210 on April 23, 1998. EVRGC serves as an eco-industrial hub with the Tacloban city government as its developer and operator. Several regional broadcasters are also based in the city including ABS-CBN TV-2 Tacloban, GMA TV-10 Tacloban and PRTV-12 Tacloban. The Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport also makes the city a key regional transportation hub.

Tacloban is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Philippines, and has one of the lowest poverty incidence rates in the country (at roughly 9%, while the national poverty incidence stands at 30%). After its massive devastation on November 8, 2013, Tacloban was declared by its local government as a &quot;start-up city&quot;, which means everything had to start back from scratch. Currently the city is experiencing a rapid economic recovery.
==Government==
The executive power of the City Government is vested in the mayor. The &quot;Sangguniang Panlungsod&quot; or the city council has the legislative power to create city ordinances. It is a unicameral body composed of ten elected councillors and certain numbers of ex officio and sectoral representatives. It is presided by the vice mayor, the mayor and the elected city councillors who are elected-at-large every three years. The current city mayor is Alfred Romualdez.

The city government ceased to be under the supervision of the provincial government after it became a highly urbanized city in 2008. The city is now under the direct supervision of the national government.

Tacloban City is part of the 1st District of Leyte, alongside seven other municipalities: Alangalang, Babatngon, Palo, San Miguel, Santa Fe, Tanauan, and Tolosa. The district is currently represented by Congressman Martin Romualdez.
===Official seal===
The official Seal of Tacloban is the symbol of the city&#x27;s identity when it became a city under Republic Act No. 760 on June 20, 1952.

The city&#x27;s emblem stands for the following physical attributes and character:

*Left Portion - Symbolizes the province of Samar (Santa Rita), major supplier of agricultural and marine products to the city, stabilizing its volume of business and trade.
*Center - Stands for the beautiful and scenic San Juanico Strait
*The Galleon - Illustrates the ship of Ferdinand Magellan who landed in the island of Homonhon, Eastern Samar, the first Philippine island he sighted during the historic circumnavigation of the world
*Right Portion - Leyte side, where Tacloban City is located

==Culture==
The week-long celebrations peaks on June 30, the Grand fiesta of Tacloban celebrated with the traditional turn-over ceremonies of the &quot;Teniente&quot; made by the immediate past Hermano Mayor to the incoming Hermano Mayor. This is accompanied by the ritual of giving the medallion containing the names of all Hermanos Pasados and the Standartes. Fireworks and grand parades mark the occasion. Every house in the city prepares a feast and opens its doors to guests and well wishers.

;Subiran Regatta: Subiran Regatta is a race of one-man native sailboats with outriggers locally called &quot;subiran&quot; along scenic and historic Leyte Gulf. The race is done without using a paddle but only skills and techniques to manoeuvre the sail. The Subiran Regatta is now on its 32nd year and counting. This contest is done annually on that weeklong celebration of the Tacloban City Fiesta. The race aims to preserve the art of sailing with the wind alone, and to showcase the mastery of this art by local boatmen.
;Balyuan: Organized by the Department of Tourism and the city government, this activity which only started in 1975 is supposedly a re-enactment of a purported exchange of images between Barrio Buscada of Basey and Sitio Kankabatok, now Tacloban City. A local story which only saw print in the 20th century purports that in the old days, Sitio Kankabatok was a small barrio under the jurisdiction of Basey town in Samar. During the Feast of Santo Niño, the residents of Sitio Kankabatok would borrow the bigger image of the saint from the chapel of Barrio Buscada in Basey. Santo Niño is the revered patron saint of both Kankabatok and Barrio Buscada. The image is returned promptly after the festivities. When Kankabatok grew into a barrio of its own, the local Catholic authorities decided that the bigger Santo Niño image be retained in prospering village. However, because of its highly questionable anthropological and historical basis, the story can be best understood as simply etiological. It gives witness to the cultural, ethnographical and historical relationship between the people of south Samar and the eastern seaboard of Leyte. Likewise, stories of the image missing in Buscada and turning up in Kankabatok aided to this decision of honoring this relationship. The Basey Flotilla bearing the church and government leaders goes on a fluvial procession along San Pedro Bay. A budyong (shell) call announces the sight of the flotilla off Kankabatok Bay.

;Sangyaw Festival: Sangyaw is an archaic Waray word which means to herald the news. The Sangyaw Festival was created by Imelda Marcos in the 1980s. The festival was revived in 2008 by her nephew, current city mayor Alfred Romualdez. The Sangyaw Festival invites contingents of different performing groups of various festivals in the country to compete in this side of the region. Cash prizes and trophies are at stake as the Sangyaw Festival grooms itself to be a big festival to watch out in the succeeding years.

Hewitt was the son of a Coventry draper, William Hewitt (1683–1747), who was born in Rockcliffe, Cumberland, the son of James Hewitt and Mary Urwin. The judge&#x27;s mother was Hannah Lewis. In a class-conscious age, his background was something of a handicap, and his &quot;small-town&quot; manners were the subject of unkind comments throughout his life. Hewitt used his influence with the first Rockingham ministry to secure office for his brother, William Hewitt (1719–1781), as a commissioner for the sale of ceded lands in the British West Indies.

==Career==
Hewitt first worked as an attorney&#x27;s clerk. By 1742, he had become a barrister. Rising quickly through the legal profession, his career climaxed when he was made Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1767, a post he held until his death in 1789. He was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Lifford, of Lifford in the County of Donegal, in 1768, and was further honoured when he was made Viscount Lifford in 1781, also in the Irish peerage.

He was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Coventry for 1761 to 1766. He was not highly regarded as a Parliamentarian: his fellow MPs complained that his speeches were almost inaudible.

==Character and Reputation==
Lord Lifford made his reputation as Lord Chancellor of Ireland: until then he had the name of being a &quot;dull, heavy lawyer&quot;, an uninspiring though &quot;safe&quot; MP, and a man of mediocre intelligence, who was painfully conscious of his rather humble origins. Even the Government which chose him, while praising him as a good lawyer and an honest man, was rather doubtful that he had the necessary strength of character to be an effective Lord Chancellor, while the English Bench reacted to his appointment with general ridicule.

They were quickly proved wrong: within two years of his arrival in Ireland, Lord Lifford was earning the highest praises as a judge. As his colleague in the Irish Government John Hely-Hutchinson (not a man normally given to speaking well of others) wrote to a friend-

&quot;He does his business very ably and expeditiously and to the general satisfaction of suitors and practicers in this country, where he is much respected and a very popular character and is, in his public and private deportment, a most worthy, honest amiable man.&quot;

His efficiency in doing business was such that it was said that virtually all equity litigation in his time was diverted to Chancery (this may have been partly because the Court of Exchequer, which had a competing equity jurisdiction, was notoriously slow and inefficient; it had been described earlier in the century as being in a state of &quot;confusion and disorder beyond remedy&quot;).

Barristers who practised in his court, like John Philpot Curran, fondly recalled &quot;the great Lord Lifford&quot; after his death, and cited him as a model for other judges to follow.

==Family==
Lord Lifford married firstly Mary Rhys Williams, daughter of the Rev. Rhys (or Price) Williams of Stapleford Abbotts, Essex, Archdeacon of Carmarthen, in 1749, by whom he had four sons, including James, his heir, John, Dean of Cloyne, and Joseph Hewitt (1754–1794), justice of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench (Ireland). She died in 1765. His second wife was Ambrosia Bayley, daughter of the Rev. Charles Bayley of Navestock and Elizabeth Beck, whom he married in 1766: her youth and beauty aroused much admiration in Ireland. By Ambrosia, he had one further son and two daughters. He was succeeded by his eldest son, James Hewitt, 2nd Viscount Lifford (1750–1830). Ambrosia died in 1807.

He lived at Belvedere House, Drumcondra and later Stillorgan.

<text>Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) is a highly branched, herbaceous, thistle-like annual plant in the family Asteraceae. It is one of the world&#x27;s oldest crops, and today is commercially cultivated for vegetable oil extracted from the seeds. Plants are tall with globular flower heads having yellow, orange, or red flowers. Each branch will usually have from one to five flower heads containing 15 to 20 seeds per head. Safflower is native to arid environments having seasonal rain. It grows a deep taproot which enables it to thrive in such environments.

==Biology==
===Plant morphology===
Safflower is a fast growing, erect, winter/spring-growing annual herb, that resembles a thistle. Originating from a leaf rosette emerges a branched central stem (also referred to as terminal stem), when day length and temperature increase. The main shoot reaches heights of . The plant also develops a strong taproot, growing as deep as . First lateral branches develop, once the main stem is about high. These lateral branches can then branch again to produce secondary and tertiary branches. The chosen variety as well as growing conditions influence the extent of branching.

The elongated and serrated leaves reach lengths of and widths of and run down the stem. The upper leaves that form the bracts are usually short, stiff and ovate, terminating in a spine. Buds are borne on the ends of branches, and each composite flower head (capitulum) contains 20–180 individual florets. Depending on variety, crop management and growing conditions, each plant can develop 3–50 or more flower heads of diameter. Flowering commences with terminal flower heads (central stem), followed sequentially by primary, secondary and sometimes tertiary branch flower heads. Individual florets usually flower for 3–4 days. Commercial varieties are largely self-pollinated. Flowers are commonly yellow, orange and red, but white and cream coloured forms exist. The dicarpelled, epigynous ovary forms the ovule. The safflower plant then produces achenes. Each flower head commonly contains 15–50 seeds; however, the number can exceed 100. The shell content of the seeds varies between 30 and 60%, the oil content of the seeds varies between 20 and 40%.

===Plant development===

Safflower usually emerges 1–3 weeks after sowing and grows slower under low temperatures. Germination of safflower is epigeal. The first true leaves emerging form a rosette. This stage occurs in winter with short daylength and cold temperature, as the safflower can tolerate frosts up to during the rosette stage.

When temperature and daylength start to increase, the central stem begins to elongate and branch, growing more rapidly. Early sowing allows more time for developing a large rosette and more extensive branching, which results in a higher yield.

Flowering is mainly influenced by daylength. The period from the end of flowering to maturity is usually 4 weeks. The total period from sowing to harvest maturity varies with variety, location, sowing time and growing conditions; for June or July sowings, it may be about 26–31 weeks.

Both wild and cultivated forms have a diploid set of 2n = 24 chromosomes. Crossings with &quot;Carthamus palaestinus&quot;, &quot;Carthamus oxyacanthus&quot; and &quot;Carthamus persicus&quot; can produce fertile offspring.

==History==
Safflower is one of humanity&#x27;s oldest crops. It was first cultivated in Mesopotamia, with archaeological traces possibly dating as early as 2500 BC.

Chemical analysis of ancient Egyptian textiles dated to the Twelfth Dynasty (1991–1802 BC) identified dyes made from safflower, and garlands made from safflowers were found in the tomb of the pharaoh Tutankhamun. John Chadwick reports that the Greek name for safflower (, ) occurs many times in Linear B tablets, distinguished into two kinds: a white safflower (ka-na-ko re-u-ka, , ), which was measured, and red (ka-na-ko e-ru-ta-ra, , ) which was weighed. &quot;The explanation is that there are two parts of the plant which can be used; the pale seeds and the red florets.&quot;

The early Spanish colonies along the Rio Grande in New Mexico used safflower as a substitute for saffron in traditional recipes. An heirloom variety originating in Corrales, New Mexico, called &quot;Corrales Azafran&quot;, is still cultivated and used as a saffron substitute in New Mexican cuisine. Also in his 14th-century work &quot;Kaftor va-Ferach (Hebrew: כפתור ופרח)&quot;, Ishtori Haparchi noted that the inhabitants of the Land of Israel in his time used Safflower to dye their food as a substitute for &quot;Crocus sativus&quot;.

==Cultivation==

===Climate===
Safflower prefers high temperatures and grows best at . It tolerates , but there are also some varieties which grow under very low temperatures. Safflower is cultivated in different seasons: as a winter crop in south central India, as an early summer crop in California and as a mid-summer crop in the Northern Great Plains of the United States. Minimum length of the growing season is 120 and 200 days for summer and winter cultivars, respectively. Plant performance is highly dependent on the different planting dates in terms of temperature and day length. Winter hard varieties only form a rosette in late fall and elongates in spring. In early stages, safflower tolerates humidity but after bud stage the danger of a Botrytis blight infestation increases

Safflower is drought tolerant. The tap root makes moisture from deep soil layers available. Additionally, this tolerance can also be explained by the higher water use efficiency compared to other oil crops such as linseed and mustard. Shortly before and during maximum flowering water requirements are the highest. Beside drought tolerance, all parts of the plant are sensitive to moisture in terms of diseases. In the case of excessive water supply, it is susceptible to root rot. Therefore, many varieties are not suitable in irrigated agriculture especially on soils with danger of waterlogging.

Safflower tolerates wind and hail better than cereals. It stays erect and can retain the seeds in the head.

===Soil===
Safflower prefers well-drained, neutral, fertile and deep soils. It can adapt well to soil pH (pH 5–8) and tolerates salinity. Safflower can be well grown on different soil types, with water supply as its main driving factor for suitability, depending on climate and irrigation, and the resulting different water regimes of the different soil types. Therefore, cultivation on shallow soils and especially on soils with danger of waterlogging is not suitable. The deep rooting promotes water and air movement and improves the soil quality for subsequent crops in a rotation.

Nutrient requirements can be compared to wheat and barley, except nitrogen amendment should be increased by 20%. Therefore, soils with an adequate nitrogen supply are favorable.

===Agricultural practice===
====Crop rotation and sowing====
Safflower is frequently grown in crop rotation with small grains, fallow and annual legumes. Close rotation with crops susceptible to &quot;Sclerotinia sclerotiorum&quot; (e.g. sunflower, canola, mustard plant and pea) should be avoided. A four-year rotation is recommended to reduce disease pressure.

Seeds should be sown in spring as early as soil temperature is exceeded, to take advantage of the full growing season. If wireworms were a problem in the field in previous seasons, a respective seed treatment is recommended. A planting depth between is optimal. Shallow seeding promotes uniform emergence resulting in a better stand.

Seeding rate recommendations are around of live seed. Where lower seeding rates promote branching, a longer flowering period and later maturity and higher rates promote thicker stands with a higher disease incidence. Sufficient moisture is necessary for germination. Usually, row spacing between are chosen using similar drill settings as recommended for barley.

====Management====
The total N recommendation is . This should include credits based on previous crops and soil available N. For the latter, deeper positioned nutrients need to be taken into account as safflower will root deeper than small grains and therefore access nutrients unavailable to them. Safflower growing in soils low in phosphorus need to be fertilized. Up to of phosphate can be drill-applied safely.

A weed control program is essential when growing safflower as it is a poor competitor with weeds during the rosette stage. Cultivation on fields with heavy infestation of perennial weeds is not recommended.

====Harvest====
Safflower is mature when most leaves have turned brown approximately 30 days after flowering. Seeds should fall from the head when rubbed. Rain and high humidity after maturity may cause the seeds to sprout on the head.

Harvesting is usually done using a small-grain combine harvester. Moisture in seeds should not exceed 8% to allow for a safe, long-term storage. Drying can be done similar to sunflower. Temperatures must not exceed to prevent damage to the seed and ensure quality.

===Pests===
* Gram pod borer/capsule borer: &quot;Helicoverpa armigera&quot;
* Safflower caterpillar: &quot;Perigaea capensis&quot;
* Safflower aphid: &quot;Uroleucon carthami&quot;
* Capsule fly/safflower bud fly: &quot;Acanthiophilus helianthi&quot;

===Diseases===
&quot;Alternaria&quot; spp. present one of the most prevalent diseases causing losses as high as 50% in India. In a field trial in Switzerland, &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; was the most prevalent disease.
==Production==
In 2020, global production of safflower seeds was 653,030 tonnes, led by Kazakhstan with 35% of the world total (table). Other significant producers were Russia and Mexico, with 28% of world production combined.
==Uses==
Traditionally, the crop was grown for its seeds, and used for coloring and flavoring foods, in medicines, and making red (carthamin) and yellow dyes, especially before cheaper aniline dyes became available.

===Safflower oil===
For the last fifty years or so, the plant has been cultivated mainly for the vegetable oil extracted from its seeds. Safflower seed oil is flavorless and colorless. It is used mainly in cosmetics and as a cooking oil, in salad dressing, and for the production of margarine. INCI nomenclature is &quot;Carthamus tinctorius&quot;.

There are two types of safflower that produce different kinds of oil: one high in monounsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid) and the other high in polyunsaturated fatty acid (linoleic acid). Currently the predominant edible oil market is for the former, which is lower in saturated fats than olive oil. The latter is used in painting in the place of linseed oil, particularly with white paints, as it does not have the yellow tint which linseed oil possesses.

In one review of small clinical trials, safflower oil consumption reduced blood low-density lipoprotein levels – a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases – more than those seen from butter or lard consumption.


===Flowers for human consumption===

Safflower flowers are occasionally used in cooking as a cheaper substitute for saffron, sometimes referred to as &quot;bastard saffron&quot;.

The dried safflower petals are also used as a herbal tea variety.

===Dye from flowers===

Safflower petals contain one red and two yellow dyes. In coloring textiles, dried safflower flowers are used as a natural dye source for the orange-red pigment carthamin. Carthamin is also known, in the dye industry, as Carthamus Red or Natural Red 26. Yellow dye from safflower is known as Carthamus yellow or Natural Yellow 5. One of the yellow pigments is fugitive and will wash away in cold water. The dye is suitable for cotton, which takes up the red dye, and silk, which takes up the yellow and red color yielding orange. No mordant is required.

In Japan, dyers have long utilised a technique of producing a bright red to orange-red dye (known as &quot;carthamin&quot;) from the dried florets of safflower (&quot;Carthamus tinctorius&quot;). Darker shades are achieved by repeating the dyeing process several times, having the fabric dry, and redyed. Due to the expensive nature of the dye, safflower dye was sometimes diluted with other dyestuffs, such as turmeric and sappan.

===Biodegradable oil===
In Australia in 2005, CSIRO and Grains Research and Development Corporation launched the Crop Biofactories initiative to produce 93% oleic oil for use as a biodegradable oil for lubricants, hydraulic fluids, and transformer oils, and as a feedstock for biopolymers and surfactants.

<doc id="746518" wikidata="Q241133" url="?curid=746518" title="Borghese family">
<text>The House of Borghese is a family of Italian noble and papal background, originating as the Borghese or Borghesi in Siena, where they came to prominence in the 13th century and held offices under the &quot;commune&quot;. During the 16th century, the head of the family, Marcantonio, moved to Rome, where they rose in power and wealth following the election of his son Camillo as Pope Paul V in 1605. They were one of the leading families of the black nobility and maintain close ties to the Vatican.

==Borghese (Borghesi) of Siena==
The family originated with Tiezzo da Monticiano, a 13th-century wool merchant in Siena, whose nephew Borghese gave his name to the family. Among the important Sienese Borghese are:

* Agostino (1390–1462), noted soldier in the wars between Siena and Florence, named count palatine by Pope Pius II and count of the Holy Roman Empire by Sigismund
* Niccolò (1432–1500), man of letters, philosopher, and important political figure in the Sienese republic, belonging to the Monte dei Nove.
* Pietro (1469–1527), named a senator of Rome by Pope Leo X, killed in the Sack of Rome.
* Marcantonio (1504–1574), politician and lawyer in papal service.

==Borghese of Rome==
The head of the family, Marcantonio, Patrician of Siena, moved to Rome in 1541 and this Sienese family rapidly gained access to the upper echelons of Roman society, culminating in the election of Marcantonio&#x27;s son Camillo Borghese as Pope Paul V in 1605. Paul V was an unabashed nepotist, naming his brother Francesco (1556–1620) Duke of Rignano and general of the papal army, his other brother Giambattista (1554–1609) Governor of the Borgo and castellan of Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo, and his sister Ortensia&#x27;s son Scipione Caffarelli (1577–1633), becoming Scipione Borghese on his adoption) a Cardinal and his adoptive son. Paul also bestowed on his nephew Scipione the title Prince of Vivero on (November 17, 1609). As an extended family, the Borghese became some of the largest
landowners of the Roman Campagna, increasing their wealth by their strategic control of their properties and a concerted policy of assuming monopolies of milling grain and the rights to run inns.
Thus the Borghese family rose still further in power and wealth. Many of Paul V&#x27;s official inscriptions include after his name, to reinforce the family&#x27;s new Roman connection. Scipione was a major patron of the arts, and the family art collection burgeoned under his guardianship (formerly housed at the family seat in Rome, Palazzo Borghese, it has since 1903 been established as the Galleria Borghese, located in the family&#x27;s former property, Villa Borghese).

Marcantonio II (1598–1658), son of Giambattista, was named prince of Sulmona in 1610 (Grandee of Spain of 1st class), again through Paul V&#x27;s influence, in this case with Philip III of Spain. In 1619 Marcantonio II married Camilla Orsini, becoming heir to both the Borghese and Orsini families. His son Paolo (1624–1646) married Olimpia Aldobrandini, princess of Rossano, and by this marriage enabled the Borghese to lay claim to the Aldobrandini family legacy as well, though this right was only recognised in 1769 after protracted court battles. Along with Paolo&#x27;s titles, Olimpia passed the title of prince of Rossano to their grandson Marcantonio III (1660–1729), who also became viceroy of Naples.

His grandson Marcantonio IV (1730–1800), prince of Sulmona and of Rossano, was a senator of the Roman Republic. His son Camillo Filippo Ludovico (1775–1832) enlisted in the Napoleonic army and later became one of its generals. In 1803 he married Napoleon&#x27;s sister, Pauline Bonaparte, the promiscuous widow of General Leclerc. Camillo was named duke of Guastalla in 1806, and governor of Piedmont (1807–1814). Camillo&#x27;s sale of the Borghese collection of antiquities enriched the new Musée du Louvre. On Napoleon&#x27;s fall, he separated from Pauline and retired to private life in Florence, dying without issue.

Marcantonio IV&#x27;s second son, prince Francesco Borghese-Aldobrandini (1776–1839), was also a general in the Napoleonic army, and inherited all Camillo&#x27;s property. Francesco had married Adèle de La Rochefoucauld, daughter of Alexandre-Francois, and their son Marcantonio married Thérèse de La Rochefoucauld, daughter of Alexandre-Jules (brother of Adèle).

His great-grandson Prince Scipione Borghese (1871–1927) was an industrialist and sportsman, remembered for participating in the 1907 Peking to Paris Race with the journalist Luigi Barzini. 

His nephew Junio Valerio Borghese (1906–1974) was a Navy official under the Fascist regime and awardee of the Gold Medal of Military Valour for his commando actions during World War II. In post-war Italy he became a prominent far-right politician; he fled to Spain in 1970 after being accused of plotting a coup d&#x27;état.

There are 4 present branches of the Borghese family:
*Borghese, descended from Marcantonio V, princes of Sulmona, Rossano, son of Francesco
*Borghese-Aldobrandini, descended from Camillo, princes of Meldola, son of Francesco
*Borghese-Salviati, descended from Scipione, dukes of Giuliano, son of Francesco
*Borghese-Torlonia, Giulio (1847–1914), princes of Fucino, grandson of Francesco, married princess Anna Maria Torlonia

<text>William Robert Ogilvie-Grant (25 March 1863 – 26 July 1924) was a Scottish ornithologist.

==Early life and education==

Grant was born on 25 March 1863 as the second son of Capt. the Hon. George Henry Essex Ogilvy-Grant, of Easter Elchies, Craigellachie, Scotland, of the 42nd Highlanders, sixth son of Francis Ogilvy-Grant, 6th Earl of Seafield, and daughter of Sir William Gordon-Cumming, 2nd Baronet. Ogilvie-Grant was educated at Fettes College, Edinburgh, where he studied zoology and anatomy. He also studied at Cargilfield Preparatory School.

<text>Clarence George Carter (born January 14, 1936) is an American singer, songwriter, musician and record producer. His most successful songs include &quot;Slip Away&quot;, &quot;Back Door Santa&quot; (both released 1968), &quot;Patches&quot; (1970) and &quot;Strokin&#x27;&quot; (1986).

==Early life==
Born blind in Montgomery, Alabama, on January 14, 1936, Carter attended the Alabama School for the Blind in Talladega, Alabama, and Alabama State University in Montgomery, graduating in August 1960 with a Bachelor of Science degree in music.

== Career ==
His professional music career began with friend Calvin Scott, signing to the Fairlane label to release &quot;I Wanna Dance But I Don&#x27;t Know How&quot;, as Clarence &amp; Calvin, the following year. After the 1962 release of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know (School Girl),&quot; the pair joined Duke Records, renaming themselves the C &amp; C Boys and releasing four singles for the label, though none were commercially successful. In 1965, the duo recorded &quot;Step by Step&quot; at Rick Hall&#x27;s FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals; it was released on the Atlantic Records&#x27; subsidiary Atco label, but it also failed to chart.

The duo performed regularly in clubs in Birmingham, Alabama in 1966. After Scott was seriously injured in an auto accident, Carter continued as a solo singer, and recorded for the Fame label. In 1967 he recorded &quot;Tell Daddy&quot;, which reached number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart and inspired Etta James&#x27; answer record, &quot;Tell Mama&quot;, for which Carter was credited as writer. At the end of 1967, Carter joined Atlantic Records. He then began a string of hits on the R&amp;B and pop charts, starting with &quot;Slip Away&quot; (number 2 R&amp;B, number 6 pop), which has been described as &quot;a superior cheating ballad spotlighting his anguished, massive baritone alongside the remarkably sinuous backing of Fame&#x27;s exemplary backing band&quot;, and &quot;Too Weak to Fight&quot; (number 3 R&amp;B, number 13 pop). Both of the preceding Atlantic singles were certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. At the end of 1968, he had a seasonal pop hit with the raunchy and funky &quot;Back Door Santa&quot; (number 4 Christmas pop), and toured nationally. His backing singers included Candi Staton; they married in 1970 and produced a son, Clarence Carter Jr., before divorcing in 1973.

Carter continued to have hits in 1969 and 1970, with &quot;Snatching It Back&quot;, &quot;The Feeling Is Right&quot;, &quot;Doin&#x27; Our Thing&quot;, and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Leave Your Love Alone&quot; all reaching both the US pop and R&amp;B charts. The B-side of &quot;Snatching It Back&quot; was a remake of a remake of James Carr&#x27;s &quot;The Dark End of the Street&quot;, entitled &quot;Making Love (At the Dark End of the Street)&quot;. Carter&#x27;s biggest hit came in 1970 with his version of &quot;Patches&quot;, first recorded by Chairmen of the Board, which was a UK number 2 hit and a US number 4. The record sold over one million copies, and received a gold disc awarded by the R.I.A.A. in September 1970, just two months after its release, and won the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song in 1971. Following &quot;Slip Away&quot; and &quot;Too Weak to Fight&quot;, it was Carter&#x27;s third million-seller. However, Carter&#x27;s later record releases were less successful, and he left Atlantic at the end of 1971 to rejoin the Fame label. In 1975 he signed to ABC Records, releasing three albums including &quot;Loneliness and Temptation&quot;. According to writer Brian Ward, Carter &quot;virtually made a career from tales of unbridled love and illicit sex...&quot;

With the advent of disco in the mid-1970s, Carter&#x27;s career suffered. After the birth of another son, Herbert Deon Wilkerson in 1981, he signed for Ichiban Records in 1985 and found a new audience with songs such as &quot;Strokin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Dr. C.C.&quot; in the 1980s and 1990s. &quot;Strokin&#x27;&quot; was reputedly deemed too ribald for a public release or radio play, so the record company placed the records in jukeboxes, where bar patrons discovered the song. &quot;Strokin&#x27;&quot; was given further acclaim when it was used in the Eddie Murphy remake of &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;. It was most recently used in William Friedkin&#x27;s film &quot;Killer Joe&quot;. Carter&#x27;s soul sound also found an audience within the then-nascent hip-hop community. Most notably, the horn break from &quot;Back Door Santa&quot; is sampled in the Run-D.M.C. Christmas song &quot;Christmas in Hollis&quot;.

Carter&#x27;s later songs continue to appeal to a primarily African-American working-class audience that is also interested in contemporary blues artists such as Denise LaSalle, Bobby Rush, Marvin Sease and Sir Charles Jones. He has continued recording, releasing six albums for the Ichiban label and, since 1996, establishing his own Cee Gee Entertainment label. He has also continued to tour regularly in the Southern states and internationally.

<text>The Oldham Branch Railway was an early railway of the Manchester and Leeds Railway Company connecting Oldham to Manchester. 

The Manchester and Leeds Railway (M&amp;LR) opened its Middleton Junction and Oldham Branch on 31 March 1842 from its mainline, the Manchester to Littleborough railway line (which had opened on 4 July 1839), at (called at the time Oldham Junction) to . This was the first railway to reach Oldham, albeit up a severe incline to Werneth on the west side of the town.

The branch had two stations, the junction at and the terminus at .

Connecting the two stations the branch was long most of which was the Werneth Incline at long it was one of the steepest passenger worked railway line in Britain, with a gradient of 1:27 for about . 

The earliest trains to use this line required cable assistance to get to the top of the incline. The method of working was devised by Captain Laws, the company General Manager; it used a balancing load of mineral wagons and a brake van on a reserved track, with a cable passing round a large drum at the head of the incline. Traffic proceeding up the incline would be attached to the rope and drawn up under control by its own locomotive using the descending load to reduce the effort required. The next descending train would be used to draw the balancing load back up the incline. There were sufficient descending trains, both regular service trains and coal trains from Stockfield Colliery to ensure the service ran without much interruption. This arrangement continued until some time between 1851 and 1856, after which ordinary locomotive working was used.

The branch carried heavy traffic in its first few years, an average of 750,000 passengers per year, and plans were quickly made for the branch to be extended through the higher ground into Oldham town centre and beyond.

A extension was built by the construction of two tunnels with a cutting between them to the only intermediate station at located just beyond the second tunnel and then to . The line and stations opened on 1 November 1847.

On 12 August 1914 a goods and coal depot was opened at Chadderton. This was at the end of the long Chadderton Branch off the Middleton Junction and Oldham Branch approximately from Middleton Junction.

The line from Chadderton Junction to Oldham was closed to regular passengers in 1958 although some diverted services used it in 1960 and completely on 7 January 1963.

 closed to passengers on 3 January 1966.

The Chadderton goods and coal depot remained open and in use until 1988 (the track was eventually lifted in September 1991).

<doc id="746528" wikidata="Q670645" url="?curid=746528" title="Arizona State Route 66">
<text>State Route 66 (SR 66) is a surface road in the U.S. state of Arizona in Mohave and Coconino Counties. In 1914, the road was designated as part of the National Old Trails Highway but in 1926 was re-designated as U.S. Route 66 (US 66). In 1985, US 66 was dropped from the highway system. Parts of the highway were either absorbed into Interstate 40 (I-40), turned over to the state (SR 66), or turned over to Yavapai County.

==Route description==
SR 66 is a relic of the former US 66 and is the only part of old US 66 in Arizona to have state route markers. Its western terminus is near Kingman at exit 52 on I-40 and its eastern terminus was near Seligman at exit 123 on I-40. In 1990, the state turned over the easternmost of SR 66 (known as Crookton Road) to Yavapai County for maintenance.

SR 66 tends downward toward the west, with the vegetation becoming more desert-like toward Kingman. The terrain changes at a slower pace than the more direct I-40, making it a scenic alternative at the cost of some time. It still serves communities that the freeway avoids, including Valentine and Peach Springs; it enters the Hualapai Indian Reservation.

==History==

===U.S. Route 66===
Between the California state line and Kingman, the original alignment is now known as Oatman Road and passed through the old mining town of Oatman. A later alignment (via Yucca) is now Interstate 40. The older alignment passes through the Black Mountains complete with numerous hairpin turns. This area is desert.

From Kingman to Seligman, it took a path now followed by modern State Route 66.

East of Seligman and continuing beyond Flagstaff, the area is mountainous (not desert) and covered with pine forests. Continuing toward the New Mexico state line, much of US 66 has been replaced with I-40. Various stretches of the old highway exist as frontage roads and business loops of I-40.

===State Route 66===
In 1984, US 66 was officially removed from the state highway system of Arizona. Most of the old highway had been replaced by I-40, but the portion of the interstate between Kingman and Seligman was developed to follow a new alignment to the south. The remaining northern segment ultimately became SR 66. In 1990, the state turned over the easternmost of SR 66 (known as Crookton Road) to Yavapai County for maintenance.

<text>McClelland &amp; Stewart Limited is a Canadian publishing company. It is owned by Penguin Random House of Canada, a branch of Penguin Random House, the international book publishing division of German media giant Bertelsmann.

==History==
It was founded in 1906 as McClelland and Goodchild by John McClelland and Frederick Goodchild, both originally employed with the &quot;Methodist Book Room&quot; which was in 1919 to become the Ryerson Press. In December 1913 George Stewart, who had also worked at the Methodist Book Room, joined the company, and the name of the firm was changed to McClelland, Goodchild and Stewart Limited. When Goodchild left to form his own company in 1918, the company&#x27;s name was changed to McClelland and Stewart Limited, now sometimes shortened to M&amp;S.

The first known imprint of the press is John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s &quot;Random Reminiscences of Men and Events.&quot; In the earliest years, M&amp;S concentrated primarily on exclusive distribution and printing agreements with foreign-owned publishing houses. But the company did feature home-grown authors alongside their foreign offerings - the second catalogue issued by the company was titled &quot;Canadiana: A list of Books on Canada and Canadian Questions, Books by Canadian Writers.&quot;

==Publications and authors==
In 1910 &quot;Kilmeny of the Orchard&quot; by L. M. Montgomery was issued by the press, the first by a Canadian author. The company slowly expanded its list of Canadian authors to include writers such as Bliss Carman, Duncan Campbell Scott and Stephen Leacock. When McClelland&#x27;s son, Jack joined the company in 1946, the company started moving away from the distribution of books published outside the country. With the establishment of a Canadian subsidiary of Doubleday and Co., a firm which McClelland and Stewart had previously held Canadian distribution deals with, Jack started the move to a more Canadian-based catalogue: &quot;I decided that I didn&#x27;t want to be dependent on foreign agencies. I saw that a logical decision in London or New York could cut our volume in half. A Canadian nationalist was born overnight.&quot; By 1962, most of the company&#x27;s activities were associated with Canadian publishing. This included writers Margaret Atwood, Pierre Berton, Leonard Cohen, Peter Gzowski, Donald Jack, Margaret Laurence, Farley Mowat, Michael Ondaatje and Mordecai Richler.

Jack McClelland acted as the head of the company since the early 1950s, though he was officially in the position of general manager. John McClelland acted as chairman of the board of directors until his death in 1968.

==Imprints and others==
Quality paperbacks were produced in Canada with their New Canadian Library series, launched with four titles. They were aimed at a college or university market, for course texts. The term &quot;quality&quot; was intended to suggest a divide between the mass market paperback and this higher production valued, often scholastic, publication. These paperbacks were the same size as mass market paperbacks, but had more sober covers, sometimes better quality binding, and were produced in smaller print runs. This was at a time when Canadian literary identity was beginning to be valued on a large scale level in Canada (it was after the war, and influenced by that as well). The 1950s had seen rare inclusions of Canadian content in English literature classes, and in the 1960s and 1970s, Canadian literature was being included more frequently in Canadian education. The New Canadian Library was said to have been an important factor in the establishment of the Canadian Literary identity. Macmillan of Canada was a major competitor of the New Canadian Library.

In 1986, M&amp;S hired editor and publisher Douglas Gibson from Macmillan, giving him his own Douglas Gibson Books imprint. Many of the authors Gibson had worked with at Macmillan — including Alice Munro, Mavis Gallant, Robertson Davies, Jack Hodgins, Guy Vanderhaeghe, Hugh Maclennan and W. O. Mitchell — followed him to the new imprint. The first book published under the Douglas Gibson Books imprint was Munro&#x27;s &quot;The Progress of Love&quot;. Gibson became the publisher of McClelland and Stewart in 1988, and the company&#x27;s president in 2000.

At times, the company&#x27;s financial future has been uncertain. In 1971, the Ontario Development Corporation made a $961,645 loan to stave off imminent collapse due to an unsustainable burden of debt. In 1986, the company was purchased from McClelland by Avie Bennett. In 2000, Random House of Canada bought a 25% share in the company. The other 75% was donated to the University of Toronto. In 2011, Random House bought the remaining 75% of the company to become sole owner.

==Legacy==
Canada Post has issued a single commemorative stamp celebrating McClelland &amp; Stewart&#x27;s centennial. The stamp, designed by James Roberts of Overdrive (Design Limited), was issued nationwide on April 26, 2006, with the first day of issue ceremonies at the University of Toronto.

==Parent company==
===Penguin Random House===
In 2011, University of Toronto sold its shares of McClelland &amp; Stewart to Random House for $1. In 2013, Random House&#x27;s parent company, Bertelsmann, entered into a joint venture with Pearson PLC (the parent company of the Penguin Group) to form a new trade publishing company called Penguin Random House. As part of this venture Random House of Canada and Penguin Canada were amalgamated as Penguin Random House Canada.
