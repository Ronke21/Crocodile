<text>Francesco Maria Piave (18 May 18105 March 1876) was an Italian opera librettist who was born in Murano in the lagoon of Venice, during the brief Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy.

==Career==
Piave&#x27;s career spanned over twenty years working with many of the significant composers of his day, including Giovanni Pacini (four librettos), Saverio Mercadante (at least one), Federico Ricci, and even one for Michael Balfe. He is most known for his collaborations with Giuseppe Verdi, for whom he was to write 10 librettos, the best known being those for &quot;Rigoletto&quot; and &quot;La traviata&quot;.

But Piave was not only a librettist: he was a journalist and translator in addition to being the resident poet and stage manager at La Fenice in Venice where he first encountered Verdi. Later, Verdi was helpful in securing him the same position at La Scala in Milan. His expertise as a stage manager and his tact as a negotiator served Verdi very well, but the composer bullied him mercilessly for his pains over many years.

Like Verdi, Piave was an ardent Italian patriot, and in 1848, during Milan&#x27;s &quot;Cinque Giornate,&quot; when Radetzky&#x27;s Austrian troops retreated from the city, Verdi wrote to Piave in Venice addressing him as &quot;Citizen Piave.&quot;
Together, they worked on ten operas between 1844 and 1862, and Piave would have also prepared the libretto for &quot;Aida&quot; when Verdi accepted the commission for it in 1870, had he not suffered a stroke which left him paralyzed and unable to speak. Verdi helped to support his wife and daughter, proposing that &quot;an album of pieces by famous composers be compiled and sold for Piave&#x27;s benefit&quot;. The composer paid for his funeral when he died nine years later in Milan aged 65 and arranged for his burial at the Monumental Cemetery.

==Piave&#x27;s librettos for Verdi==
From the beginnings of their working relationship in 1844, scholars such as Gabriele Baldini see Verdi&#x27;s overall influence upon the structure of his work take a big leap forward when he notes: 
:Working with Piave was Verdi&#x27;s first opportunity to work with himself. [...] The composer completely dominates and enslaves the librettist, who becomes scarcely more than an instrument in his hands...[Piave&#x27;s] libretti are in fact those best suited to Verdi&#x27;s music [...] simply because, in detail as well as in general shape, Verdi himself composed them.

This statement suggests that, almost for the first time, the composer was going to be the one who determined &quot;that drama essentially consisted of the arrangement of pieces and the clarity of the musical forms..[so that]..he began to become aware of the structure and architecture of musical composition, something which was not even clearly hinted at during the period with Solera. The composer began to control the overall dramatic arc of the drama and no longer would he &quot;suffer under&quot; such librettists as Temistocle Solera, who wrote the libretti for five Verdi operas beginning with &quot;Oberto&quot; and up to &quot;Attila&quot; in 1846.
An example of the pressure which Verdi exerted on Piave was in the struggle to have the Venetian censors approve &quot;Rigoletto&quot;: &quot;Turn Venice upside down to make the censors permit this subject&quot; he demanded, following that up with the admonition not to allow the matter to drag on: &quot;If I were the poet I would be very, very concerned, all the more because you would be greatly responsible if by chance (may the Devil not make it happen) they should not allow this drama [to be staged]&quot;
Another Verdi scholar notes that &quot;Verdi always harried him unmercifully, often having his work revised by others [but] Piave rewarded him with doglike devotion, and the two remained on terms of sincere friendship.&quot; Piave became &quot;someone Verdi loved&quot;.

In following Salvadore Cammarano as Verdi&#x27;s main mid-career librettist, Piave firstly wrote &quot;Ernani&quot; in 1844, and then &quot;I due Foscari&quot; (1844), &quot;Attila&quot; (1846), &quot;Macbeth&quot; (the 1847 first version), &quot;Il Corsaro&quot; (1848), &quot;Stiffelio&quot; (1850), &quot;Rigoletto&quot; (1851), &quot;La traviata&quot; (1853), &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot; (the 1857 first version), &quot;Aroldo&quot; (1857), &quot;La forza del destino&quot; (the 1862 first version), and &quot;Macbeth&quot; (the 1865 second version).

<text>Poohsticks is a game first mentioned in &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot;, a Winnie-the-Pooh book by A. A. Milne. It is a simple game which may be played on any bridge over running water; each player drops a stick on the upstream side of a bridge and the one whose stick first appears on the downstream side is the winner. The annual World Poohsticks Championships have been held at Day&#x27;s Lock on the River Thames in the UK since 1984.

==History==

Poohsticks was invented by English author A.A. Milne for his son Christopher Robin Milne. The game first came to prominence upon Milne&#x27;s description in his 1928 book &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot;, as well as the 1983 Disney animated featurette &quot;Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore&quot;. As first depicted, protagonist Pooh accidentally drops a pine cone into a river from a bridge and, after observing how it appeared on the other side of the bridge, devises the rules for Poohsticks, later playing the game with the other characters, Christopher Robin, Tigger, and Eeyore.

Milne first played the game at a bridge located in Ashdown Forest, close to the village of Upper Hartfield, East Sussex, England. Built in 1907 and originally called Posingford Bridge, it is considered to be the bridge on which Milne and his son first played the game. However, it is uncertain whether the game was first played at the bridge and then written into the story, or vice versa. The bridge maintained the public&#x27;s interest and a campaign to rebuild it in the late seventies was considered important enough to feature on the BBC &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. The bridge was subsequently reopened by Christopher Robin Milne and officially renamed as &quot;Poohsticks Bridge&quot;.

The site was so popular that, in 1999, the East Sussex county council made an appeal to Disney as the old wooden bridge had been worn down by an overwhelming number of visitors. The company provided a substantial donation towards the estimated £30,000 needed to replace the bridge. Partly rebuilt in 1979, the donations from Disney, building firms, and members of the public funded its complete reconstruction. The newly-built and modernised bridge retained its precursor&#x27;s original style. A plaque was also placed to commemorate the occasion and thank those who financially contributed to the project. The game can still be played in Ashdown Forest to this day and the site regularly attracts tourists from as far afield as the United States and Japan. However, visitors are now advised to bring their own sticks, as previous visitors have caused damage to the trees in the vicinity.

The &#x27;original&#x27; Poohsticks Bridge, reconstructed from parts of the original supplemented by similarly aged timber, and located near Penshurst, Kent, was sold at auction for over in October 2021. The buyer, Lord De La Warr, intends to give it &quot;pride of place&quot; on his estate, Buckhurst Park, Sussex.

The traditional game has inspired filmmakers and screenwriters and has been portrayed in the 1998 film &quot;Into My Heart&quot; with Rob Morrow and Claire Forlani, BBC sitcom &quot;To the Manor Born&quot; and also in a Marks &amp; Spencer clothes advert where models, including Twiggy and Myleene Klass, played the game. The popularity of the game was underlined when it featured as a question on long-running British quiz series &quot;University Challenge&quot;. The &quot;Pooh-stick method&quot; of estimating the flow of a stream gets its name from the use of one or more floating objects (typically passing under a bridge of known width) to calculate the speed at which the water is flowing.

==Rules and strategy==
A game for two players or more, in the traditional version of poohsticks the participants must drop a stick simultaneously on the upstream side of a bridge and run to the other side. The winner is the player whose stick first appears on the other side of the bridge. Alternatively, players may decide upon a starting point on a river and a finish line farther downstream. The winner is the player whose stick first passes the finishing point.

It is generally agreed that the stick must be made of organic materials, preferably willow, and not of any artificial materials. All participants must drop their sticks at the same time, usually after a referee shouts &quot;drop&quot;, &quot;twitch&quot; or any other agreed keyword. Additionally, no advantage may be gained through either dismantling the bridge or the use of any self-propelling stick devices. The stick must be dropped, not thrown, into the water and any player who is deemed to have thrown their stick is disqualified.

Poohsticks is considered to be a game of chance yet some players, including the 2024 World Champion, claim skill is involved. Some strategies involve the way in which the stick is held before it is dropped and trying to find the fastest route in the river. Author Ben Schott outlined a throwing method as a winning strategy in his third book, &quot;Schott&#x27;s Sporting, Gaming and Idling Miscellany&quot;, but his method was dismissed as cheating by competition organisers. In any event, the turbulence around the bridge supports make the path of the stick very difficult to predict and may vary according to the season.

==World Poohsticks Championships==

Poohsticks was brought to a larger audience by the annual World Poohsticks Championships. Originally, these took place at Day&#x27;s Lock on the River Thames near Dorchester-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. but were later moved to Langel Common in Witney, also in Oxfordshire, and have attracted over 1,500 visitors, including many from overseas. The championships features an individual event and a four-person team event. Players come from a wide variety of countries including the United States, Japan, Kenya, Australia and England. Before its move to Witney, the event took place from Little Wittenham Bridge but now uses a bridge over the River Windrush near Cogges Manor Farm.

The sporting event was started at Little Wittenham Bridge in 1984 by the lockkeeper, Lynn David, as a fund-raising event for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI). He noticed that people occasionally snapped sticks from nearby hedges to play the game and he then came up with the idea of a competition to aid the charity. He put out a box of sticks and a collection box and it soon became an annual event. In this championship version of the game, a finish line is set up farther downstream and the winner is the first to pass this point. The competition originally took place every January, but it was moved to March due to icy weather in 1997.
The event proved popular with the local community and even attracted the attention of the foreign media. After Lynn David&#x27;s retirement, the running of the event was taken over by the former Rotary Club of Sinodun, based in nearby Wallingford. Additionally, the funds raised were divided between the RNLI and charitable projects supported by the Rotary Club. Twenty years after its first edition, the event had grown in popularity, attracting visitors from across the globe, and had been broadcast on television in countries including Russia, Japan and Czech Republic. Additionally, VisitBritain, the official British tourist board, named it as a highlight in its collection of &quot;Quirky British Events&quot;. Throughout its existence, it has raised around £30,000 for the RNLI.

The Championships were at risk of decline when, in 2008, Sinodun Rotary Club declared that its members were simply too old to stage an annual event of its size. The then Sinodun president, David Caswell, stated: &quot;The trouble is there is a lot of heavy work staging the event. Some of our members are over 70, and it was just getting too much&quot;. However, the Rotary Club of Oxford Spires declared that its members would continue hosting the event, thus preserving the competition for future generations. The President of Oxford Spires for 2008–2009, Liz Williamson, stressed that it should continue as the event was popular locally and demonstrated quirky English nature to a worldwide audience.

The organisers announced in January 2015 that they had decided that the Little Wittenham site was no longer suitable, citing increasing logistical difficulties as the event had become more popular and the use of the land had changed. In June, the World Championships were held at their new home, one of the cycle-track bridges over the River Windrush on Langel Common, near the Cogges Manor Farm Museum in Witney, Oxfordshire. For the first year at the new location, the organizers decided not to hold the 2015 team games, but team games were restored in 2016. The event continued to be held here until 2018; in 2019, the event was not held due to resourcing issues, and between 2020 and 2022 it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It restarted on 28th May 2023, commemorating the 40th anniversary, at Sandford-on-Thames.

The winners of both the individual and team events receive a trophy or medal, and the second and third-placed individuals and teams also receive a smaller trophy or certificate. Despite claims that the game involves skill more than luck, no team or individual has ever won the competition more than once. The individual competition usually involves winning three rounds of matches before receiving an entry to the final.

== Notable Poohsticks societies ==

Although not a Poohsticks Society as such, the Rotary Club of Abingdon is now responsible for the World Pooh Sticks Championships held annually since 1983, first at Days Lock on the River Thames, then in Witney 2015 to 2018. and the event held in 2023. The Championships were voted &#x27;Britain&#x27;s Favourite Quirky Event&#x27; by &quot;Countryfile&quot; magazine readers in 2012 and are carried out with the aim of raising money for a variety of charities.

Revival of the Oxford University Pooh Sticks Society has begun thanks to students in Magdalen College, Oxford, with the creation of the Magdalen College Pooh Sticks Society (MCPSS) founded in April 2013 which mixes classic Pooh Sticks games with commentary and rules in the style of radio programme &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;. Of late the club has become increasingly well known inside the university and is no longer restricted solely to members of Magdalen College.

Founded in 1993, members of the Pembroke College Winnie the Pooh Society of Pembroke College, Cambridge, pay homage to the works of A.A. Milne in a variety of ways, including playing games of Poohsticks alongside events such as visits to the &#x27;real-life&#x27; Hundred Acre Wood.

<doc id="750630" wikidata="Q1633087" url="?curid=750630" title="The House at Pooh Corner">
<text>The House at Pooh Corner is a 1928 children&#x27;s book by A. A. Milne and illustrated by E. H. Shepard. This book is the second novel, and final one by Milne, to feature Winnie-the-Pooh and his world. The book is also notable for introducing the character Tigger. The book&#x27;s exact date of publication is unknown beyond the year 1928, although several sources indicate the date of October 11.

== Background ==
In-between the release of the 1926 &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; and this novel, Milne and Shepard released &quot;Now We Are Six&quot;. The release comprised a collection of poems, including some that featured the Pooh characters. While writing this novel, Milne decided that he wanted to end the series as Christopher Robin was getting older. 

&quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot; entered the public domain in the United States in 2024. British copyright of the text expires on 1 January 2027 (70 calendar years after Milne&#x27;s death) while British copyright of the illustrations expires on 1 January 2047 (70 calendar years after Shepard&#x27;s death).

== Stories ==
Note: The first introduction of Tigger is in Chapter 2. 
#&quot;In Which a House is Built at Pooh Corner for Eeyore&quot;
#*During a snowy day, Pooh and Piglet attempt to construct a house for Eeyore. The two gather sticks from the other side of a fence to build Eeyore&#x27;s house. Unbeknownst to Pooh and Piglet, Eeyore had collected those sticks during the morning so that he could build a house. During this time, Eeyore visits Christopher Robin. Upon his return, Eeyore finds that the stick pile is missing. Ultimately, Eeyore believes that the wind blew the sticks there as a house, and Pooh and Piglet are happy and leave to have lunch with Christopher Robin.
#&quot;In Which Tigger Comes to the Forest and Has Breakfast&quot;
#*During one night, Pooh hears a mysterious sound outside his house. Upon investigation, Pooh discovers that a new animal has come to the forest, Tigger. Tigger stays the night upon Pooh&#x27;s invitation. In the morning, the two share breakfast but Tigger hates honey. They then go to Piglet&#x27;s, Eeyore&#x27;s, and Christopher Robin&#x27;s but they do not discover anything that Tigger likes. Finally they end up at Kanga and Roo&#x27;s where Tigger discovers that he likes malt. Kanga and Roo then invite Tigger to live with them.
#&quot;In Which a Search Is Organized, and Piglet Nearly Meets the Heffalump Again&quot;
#*Pooh is counting his honey jars when Rabbit stops by. Rabbit&#x27;s relation, Small, has disappeared, so Rabbit organizes a search party. As the search happens, Piglet feels frightened by potentially meeting a Heffalump. Pooh fell into a hole during the search, which Piglet later falls into. As Christopher Robin helps them to climb out, Piglet notices that Small was on Pooh&#x27;s back. The search ends, but Eeyore is not notified for two days.
#&quot;In Which It Is Shown That Tiggers Don&#x27;t Climb Trees&quot;
#*While visiting together, Pooh and Piglet decide to go and see Tigger and Roo. Upon arriving at Kanga&#x27;s, she explains that they are exploring the forest together. Pooh and Piglet decide to go and search for them. During this time, Roo asks what skills Tigger has, and Tigger replies that he can climb, jump, and swim. Upon reaching a tall tree, Tigger, with Roo on his back, climbs up it. However, once at the top, Tigger becomes scared and is unable to climb down. While searching, Pooh and Piglet hear sounds coming from high up, believing that it is &quot;jagulars&quot;. They discover that it is Tigger and Roo, and the two get Christopher Robin&#x27;s help. Tigger and Roo get down by jumping into Christopher Robin&#x27;s extended tunic that Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit, and Eeyore hold.
#&quot;In Which Rabbit Has a Busy Day, and We Learn What Christopher Robin Does in the Mornings&quot;
#*While trying to visit Christopher Robin, Rabbit discovers that he is gone. Rabbit takes the note that Christopher Robin left over to Owl&#x27;s where the two decipher that Christopher Robin is spending time with a &quot;Backson&quot;. Rabbit then visits Pooh who is writing poetry, and the two wonder what Christopher Robin does during the morning. Rabbit encounters Piglet who explains that he picked violets that morning, and then brought some to Eeyore. Eeyore made an &quot;A&quot; out of sticks, and said that Christopher Robin taught him that. This is how they learned that Christopher Robin does education during the mornings.
#&quot;In Which Pooh Invents a New Game and Eeyore Joins In&quot;
#*While sitting on a bridge, Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit, and Roo invent a new game called &quot;Poohsticks&quot;. The game involves dropping sticks on one side of the bridge and seeing which stick comes across first. While playing a round, Eeyore comes drifting out from under the bridge. The group helps get Eeyore out of the water, and he explains that Tigger bounced him in. Tigger denies this accusation, and states that coughed and did not bounce. Christopher Robin comes along during the argument and settles it before the group plays the game again. Tigger is very good at the game, and he teaches Eeyore his special technique. 
#&quot;In Which Tigger Is Unbounced&quot;
#*Annoyed by Tigger&#x27;s bouncing, Rabbit, along with Pooh and Piglet, concocts a scheme to get Tigger to stop. Rabbit plans to take Tigger deep into the forest and lose him, so that he will then be sad and quiet and stop bouncing. However, Tigger finds his way out while Rabbit, Pooh, and Piglet are lost instead. With Christopher Robin&#x27;s help, Tigger finds the trio, and Rabbit is the sad and quiet one.
#&quot;In Which Piglet Does a Very Grand Thing&quot;
#*On a very windy day, Piglet and Pooh visit Owl. While visiting him, his tree house gets blown over by the wind trapping the trio inside. In a moment of bravery, Piglet finds a way to escape through a tiny crevice. Piglet goes off to find Christopher Robin who will help get Pooh and Owl out. While Piglet is away, Owl begins telling Pooh a story about his uncle. Pooh dozes off during the story.
#&quot;In Which Eeyore Finds the Wolery, and Owl Moves into It&quot;
#*Due to his house falling over, Owl needs to find a new home and he solicits the help of the other animals in the forest. Eeyore had not been informed about Owl&#x27;s house falling, but he goes out to search for a new one. Pooh meets with Piglet and reinforces how brave Piglet was before they meet with everyone, minus Eeyore, at Owl&#x27;s house where furniture is being salvaged. Eeyore then comes along and explains that he has found Owl a new house. The house he found is actually Piglet&#x27;s, but Piglet willingly gives it up. After this, Pooh offers to have Piglet move in with him, which Piglet accepts.
#&quot;In Which Christopher Robin and Pooh Come to an Enchanted Place, and We Leave Them There&quot;
#*Christopher Robin has to leave the forest, so all of the animals sign a poem that Eeyore has written. Upon taking it to Christopher Robin he begins to read it, and as he does each animal leaves little by little until just Pooh remains. The two go off to the Enchanted Place in the forest where Christopher Robin &quot;knights&quot; Pooh as Sir Pooh de Bear. Christopher Robin then explains that he has to leave and he cannot do &quot;nothing&quot; anymore, but he hopes that Pooh will come and sit in the Enchanted Place even when he has gone. Pooh promises, and the two then go off together to do something.

== Reception ==
The &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; gave the book a positive review, noting its continued success at capturing the same energy as the first as well as its opportunity as a Christmas gift. The Rhode Island Evening Tribune stated that the stories were &quot;highly imaginative&quot; ones and they &quot;sincerely recommended&quot; the novel. The &quot;St. Joseph Gazette&quot; also gave a positive review, claiming that &quot;Mr. Milne and E. H. Shepard have done it again!&quot;. However, the publication did give a negative remark by stating that the book&#x27;s place as the final Pooh story was &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;. Others echoed this sentiment including &quot;The Sydney Mail&quot; who felt that Milne and Shepard should continue writing Pooh stories. 

== Adaptations ==

=== Musical recordings ===
In 1968 Jefferson Airplane referenced the book in their song &quot;The House at Pooneil Corners&quot;, a surrealistic depiction of global nuclear war co-written by Paul Kantner and Marty Balin, ending with the line &quot;Which is why a Pooh is poohing in the sun.&quot;

In 1970, singer-songwriter Kenny Loggins penned a song using the book&#x27;s name for the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band on their album &quot;Uncle Charlie &amp; His Dog Teddy&quot;. In 1971, Loggins would record the song with Jim Messina as part of Loggins and Messina for their 1971 album, &quot;Sittin&#x27; In&quot;. Loggins wrote the song when he was seventeen when reflecting upon his high school graduation. The song is told from the perspective of both Winnie-the-Pooh and Christopher Robin. The song uses verses and allusions to the book as allegorical musings on the loss of innocence and childhood and the nostalgia for simpler, happier times. The first verse, told from Pooh&#x27;s point of view, describes how he and Christopher&#x27;s days together &quot;disappeared all too soon&quot; and how he &quot;hates to find [his] way back to the Wood.&quot;

In 1994, Loggins re-released the song as &quot;Return to Pooh Corner&quot; on the album of the same name. This version featured a new verse reflecting upon Loggins&#x27; own experiences as a father. The added third verse is told from the perspective of an adult Christopher Robin who gives Winnie-the-Pooh to his own son and hears Pooh whisper to him, &quot;welcome home.&quot; The song features backing vocals from Amy Grant. Loggins would later invoke the book&#x27;s title again in 2000 with &quot;More Songs from Pooh Corner&quot;.

=== Audio recordings ===
In 1960, a recording was released by His Master&#x27;s Voice, a dramatised version with songs (music by Harold Fraser-Simson) of two chapters from the book (2 and 8), starring Ian Carmichael as Pooh, Denise Bryer as Christopher Robin, Hugh Lloyd as Tigger, Penny Morrell as Piglet, Terry Norris as Eeyore, Rosemary Adam as Kanga, Tom Chatto as Rabbit, and Rex Garner as Owl. This was released on a 45rpm EP.

In 1988, an audio version of the book, published by BBC Enterprises, was narrated by Alan Bennett.

In 1997 Hodder Children&#x27;s Audio released a dramatisation of the book with Stephen Fry as Pooh, Sandi Toksvig as Tigger, Jane Horrocks as Piglet, Geoffrey Palmer as Eeyore, Judi Dench as Kanga, Finty Williams as Roo, Robert Daws as Rabbit, Michael Williams as Owl, Steven Webb as Christopher Robin, and narrated by Judi Dench and Michael Williams. The music was composed and played by John Gould, and directed by David Benedictus.

=== Disney animation ===
In 1968, chapters 2, 8, and 9 were adapted for the Disney featurette &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot;. For 1974&#x27;s &quot;Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too!&quot;, chapters 4 and 7 were adapted. The book&#x27;s final chapter served as the basis for the epilogue to The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and later 1997&#x27;s direct-to-video movie &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin.&quot; &quot;Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore&quot; would later adapt chapter 6 from both this novel and the 1926 original. Segments of &quot;Piglet&#x27;s Big Movie&quot; would use chapters 1 and 3 as source material. Chapter 5 was adapted into the 2011 animated &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;. The 2018 live-action film &quot;Christopher Robin&quot; acts as an unofficial sequel to the book, with the film focusing on a grown-up Christopher Robin meeting Pooh for the first time since going to boarding school, while the film&#x27;s first scenes adapt the last chapter of the book. Producer Brigham Taylor was inspired by the book&#x27;s last chapter for the film&#x27;s story.

Chapter 8 was partially adapted into an episode of 1988&#x27;s &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; (entitled &quot;The Masked Offender&quot;) where Owl&#x27;s house falls down.

=== Other adaptations ===
On September 11, 2023, Jagged Edge Productions announced that Tigger will be in &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2&quot;. The movie was released in 2024, when Tigger is from now on in the public domain in the US.

<doc id="750632" wikidata="Q215227" url="?curid=750632" title="Peugeot 307">
<text>The Peugeot 307 is a small family car produced by the French automaker PSA Peugeot Citroën under their Peugeot marque, from 2001 to 2008 in Europe, and was the successor to the Peugeot 306, which was discontinued in 2002 after being in production for nine years. Using the PSA PF2 platform, it was awarded the European Car of the Year title for 2002, and continued to be offered in China and certain South American markets through 2014, despite the September 2007 French launch of the 308 (its intended successor), which is built on the same platform.

==History==
The 307 was announced as the 307 Prométhée prototype at the 2000 Mondial de l&#x27;Automobile. The production hatchback versions were introduced to the European markets on 26 April 2001, as a successor to the Peugeot 306. The 307 was also sold in Australia, New Zealand, Asia, and (in 1.6 and 2.0 petrol versions) Mexico.

In Brazil, the 307 was sold with 1.6 and 2.0 flex (gas/ethanol) engines.

==Design and engineering==
The 307 makes use of a reworked 306 platform, that can also be found on the Citroën Xsara as well as the 1991 Citroën ZX. However, the car is larger than the 306 in every direction. The 307 continued the company&#x27;s styling first seen on the Peugeot 206 and Peugeot 607.

With upswept front lights and a steeply rising bonnet leading to a highly sloped windscreen (and the upright rear doors first seen on the 206), the 307 departed from the Pininfarina designed themes employed on the previous two generations of Peugeots, as introduced with the Peugeot 205, and ending with the (evolutionary) Peugeot 406.

Its height is , which is in the middle of the spectrum between small family cars (between 1400 and 1450 mm) and compact MPVs (between 1600 and 1650 mm). Some consider the 307 as a low compact MPV rather than a tall small family car, because of its height and profile.

One advertisement for the 307, which was released upon its launch in 2001, featured the song, &quot;(Something Inside) So Strong&quot; by British singer-songwriter Labi Siffre.

== &quot;Top Gear&quot; ==
In a report from &quot;Top Gear Magazine&quot; in June 2001, the new Peugeot 307 1.6 16v TU5JP4 went head to head with its competitors, the Ford Focus 1.6L I4 Zetec SE and Honda Civic 1.6 VTEC. The Peugeot received high praise in all areas of the road test, beating both the Ford and Honda on price, space, handling, running costs and refinement.

The 307 won the road test, followed by the Focus and the Civic respectively.

==Facelift==
In June 2005, the 307 was revised to meet the competition of improved rivals which had been launched since the introduction of the 307 four years earlier. The front of the car was restyled featuring mildly revised lights, a new bonnet, updated instrument cluster, and the removal of the trademark Peugeot grille between the headlights. With the latter change, along with a new front bumper, the front of the car was now dominated by a larger air intake, as first established on the Peugeot 407, and which was now effectively the company&#x27;s new grille.

==Body styles==
The 307 was launched as a three- and five-door hatchback, though in February 2002, the range of the 307 was expanded with the introduction of two estates, the 307 Break and 307 SW. Externally the two estates are almost identical, however, the SW version has silver roof bars and a three/four length panoramic glass roof as standard equipment.

Internally though, the 307 Break is a conventional estate, while the SW features an optional third row of removable seats, so it is more flexible due to its MPV-like configuration. The SW exists, because Peugeot did not develop a compact MPV spinoff, as Citroën did with the Xsara Picasso, instead preferring to offer a more flexible version, but maintaining the style and road manners of an estate.

Unlike the previous model, there was no saloon version, but one was designed for emerging markets, such as China and the market in Latin America, as saloons were much preferred to hatchbacks. The 307 CC, a cabriolet with a retractable hardtop, was launched in August 2003, to compete against the new European coupé cabriolets.

A new, four door saloon version of the 307, was launched in China in June 2004. The 307 is produced for the market in China by the Dongfeng Peugeot-Citroën Automobile, a joint venture with the PSA Group. This model was also built in Argentina between May 2006 and November 2010. In 2006, the Argentinian version contained 60% local parts. Production ended in China in 2014.

===Hybrid HDi===
In January 2006, Peugeot announced a prototype diesel-electric hybrid engine for the 307 that could achieve , but was not intended for sale until at least 2010. By that time, the 307 had been replaced by the 308 and the hybrid remained stillborn. The Citroën C4 Hybride HDi was announced at the same time.

==Reliability==
According to some sources, the 307 suffers from below-average build quality and reliability, having featured at the bottom of the German Automobile Club breakdown statistics for 3- to 5-year-old small family cars in 2009. However, June 2005 saw a facelift within the model and reliability increased, making it a more popular model. 2006/2007 models were referenced as a lot more reliable and trustworthy.

==Motorsport==
The Peugeot 307 WRC, a World Rally Car based on the 307 CC, replaced the championship-winning 206 WRC in the World Rally Championship for the season of 2004.

The vehicle was plagued by transmission problems throughout its career, and the works team&#x27;s drivers&#x27; driving styles did not suit the car&#x27;s handling characteristics. In 2004, the car took seven podiums and a maiden win in Rally Finland, but it was not able to challenge for the championship as Marcus Grönholm finished fifth in the drivers&#x27; championship and Peugeot fourth in the manufacturers&#x27; championship.

The season of 2005 was more successful, and Peugeot was a serious challenger for the manufacturers&#x27; championship, leading the championship after round 10, but the challenge faded after Markko Märtin&#x27;s retirement from rallying. Peugeot ultimately finished second in the manufacturers&#x27; championship, while Grönholm finished third in the drivers&#x27; championship, tied on points with second-placed Petter Solberg. Grönholm took victories at Rally Finland and Rally Japan along with six other podium finishes, while Märtin took four further podiums.

The car saw its factory-supported competition life cut short at the end of 2005 by PSA&#x27;s decision to withdraw the factory teams of both Citroën and Peugeot from top-level rallying. A private undertaking by seasoned Peugeot preparatory firm Bozian Racing, dubbed &quot;OMV Peugeot Norway World Rally Team&quot;, largely assumed responsibility for the running of WRC specification 307s for the following season of 2006. Manfred Stohl and Henning Solberg were named as the driving personnel. Stohl impressively placed fourth in the overall drivers&#x27; standings, and the 307 WRC took seven podiums by privateer teams that season.

Overall, the car has three WRC victories and 26 podiums to its name, Marcus Grönholm having driven it to the top of the podium in the series at the Rally Finland in 2004 and 2005 as well as at the Rally Japan in 2005.

The 307 WRC will be remembered for the accident that befell WRC competitors Markko Märtin and Michael Park on September 18, 2005, which resulted in co-driver Park&#x27;s death. On stage 15 of Wales Rally GB, Märtin lost control of his 307 WRC and collided with a tree, killing Park instantly. This was the first fatality in a WRC event since Rodger Freeth in 1993.

The Peugeot 307 has also been raced in the World Touring Car Championship, the British Touring Car Championship, Stock Car Brasil, TC2000 and the Danish Touring Car Championship.

<text>Quixote is a software framework for developing web applications in Python. Quixote &quot;is based on a simple, flexible design, making it possible to write applications quickly and to benefit from the wide range of available third-party Python modules&quot;.

A Quixote application is typically a Python package, a collection of modules grouped into a single directory tree. Quixote then maps a URL to a function or method inside the Python package; the function is then called with the contents of the HTTP request, and the results are returned to the client.

<doc id="750634" wikidata="Q774137" url="?curid=750634" title="April Ashley">
<text>April Ashley (29 April 1935 – 27 December 2021), styled as The Honourable April Corbett from 1963 to 1980, was an English model, author, and LGBT rights activist. In the 1950s, upon being discharged from the Merchant Navy, she performed under the stage name Toni April at Le Carrousel de Paris in Paris. Ashley was outed as a transgender woman by &quot;The Sunday People&quot; newspaper in 1961 and was one of the earliest British people known to have had gender confirmation surgery. Her first marriage, to the future 3rd Baron Rowallan, was annulled in the High Court of Justice case of &quot;Corbett v Corbett&quot;. Ashley was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to transgender equality.

==Early life==
Born at 126 Smithdown Road (then Sefton General Hospital) in Liverpool, Ashley was one of six surviving children of a Roman Catholic father, Frederick Jamieson, and Protestant mother, Ada Brown, who had married two years before. During her childhood in Liverpool, Ashley suffered from both calcium deficiency, requiring weekly calcium injections at the Alder Hey Children&#x27;s Hospital, and bed-wetting, resulting in her being given her own box room, at the age of two, when the family moved house.

==1950s to 1970s==
Ashley joined the Merchant Navy in 1951 at the age of 16. Following a suicide attempt, she was given dishonourable discharge, and a second attempt resulted in her being sent to Ormskirk District General Hospital psychiatric unit at age 17.

In her book &quot;The First Lady&quot;, Ashley tells the story of the rape she endured before transitioning. A roommate raped her and she was severely injured.

===Gender transition===
After leaving the hospital, Ashley moved to London, at one point claiming to have shared a boarding house with then ship&#x27;s steward John Prescott, later deputy prime minister of the United Kingdom. Having started cross-dressing, she moved to Paris in the late 1950s, began using the name Toni April, and joined the entertainer Coccinelle in the cast of the drag cabaret at Le Carrousel de Paris.

At the age of 25, having saved £3,000, Ashley had a seven-hour-long sex reassignment surgery on 12 May 1960, performed in Casablanca, Morocco, by Georges Burou. All her hair fell out, and she endured significant pain, but the operation was successful.

===Modelling career and public outing===
After returning to Britain, she began using the name April Ashley and became a successful fashion model, appearing in &quot;British Vogue&quot;, for which she was photographed by David Bailey, and winning a small role in the 1962 film &quot;The Road to Hong Kong&quot;, which starred Bing Crosby and Bob Hope.

A friend sold her story to the media in 1961 and &quot;The Sunday People&quot; outed Ashley as a trans woman. She became a centre of attention and some scandal and her film credit was dropped.

In November 1960, Ashley met Hon. Arthur Corbett (later 3rd Baron Rowallan), the Eton-educated son and heir of Lord Rowallan. They married in 1963 but the marriage soon deteriorated, at which point Ashley claimed to have a romance with Íñigo de Arteaga y Martín, the heir to the Dukedom of the Infantado. Ashley&#x27;s lawyers wrote to Corbett in 1966 demanding maintenance payments and in 1967 Corbett responded by filing suit to have the marriage annulled. The annulment was granted in 1970 on the grounds that Ashley was male, but Corbett had known about her history when they married. This is the case known as &quot;Corbett v Corbett&quot;.

==Later life and death==

After a heart attack in London, Ashley retired for some years to the Welsh border town of Hay-on-Wye. In her book &quot;April Ashley&#x27;s Odyssey&quot; she stated that Amanda Lear was assigned male at birth and that they had worked together at Le Carousel where Lear had used the drag name Peki d&#x27;Oslo. Ashley had once been great friends with Lear but according to Ashley&#x27;s book &quot;The First Lady&quot; they had had a major falling out and had not spoken for years.

In the 1980s, Ashley married Jeffrey West on the cruise ship RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; in Long Beach, California, US. They subsequently divorced but maintained friendly relations. In the 1990s, Ashley was employed by the environmental lobby group, Greenpeace and later by an art gallery.

She talked about her life at St George&#x27;s Hall, Liverpool as part of the city&#x27;s Homotopia Festival on 15 November 2008, and on 18 February 2009 at the Southbank Centre.

Ashley latterly lived in Fulham, southwest London. She died at home on 27 December 2021, at the age of 86.

==Biographies==
&quot;April Ashley&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;, a biography by Duncan Fallowell, was published in 1982. In 2006, Ashley released her autobiography, &quot;The First Lady&quot;, and made TV appearances on Channel Five News, &quot;This Morning&quot; and BBC News. In one interview she said, &quot;This is the real story and contains a lot of things I just couldn&#x27;t say in 1982&quot;, including alleged affairs with Michael Hutchence, Peter O&#x27;Toole, Omar Sharif, Turner Prize sculptor Grayson Perry and others. The book was pulled from the market, however, after it was discovered that it heavily plagiarized the 1982 book written by Fallowell.

The 1983 biography of Peter O&#x27;Toole by Michael Freedland rejects the claim of an affair with Ashley. It states that he was acquainted with her in Spain while filming, but his then-wife Siân Phillips was with him at the time and knew the relationship to be platonic.

In 2012, Pacific Films and Limey Yank Productions announced a project to create a film about Ashley&#x27;s life.

<text>Mercury-Atlas 2 (MA-2) was an uncrewed test flight of the Mercury program using the Atlas rocket. It launched on February 21, 1961, at 14:10 UTC, from Launch Complex 14 at Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States.

Test objectives for this flight were concerned with the ability of the spacecraft to withstand reentry under the temperature-critical abort conditions and with the capability of the Atlas to meet the proper injection conditions. Convair had promised to deliver thicker-skinned Atlas vehicles for subsequent flights, however Missile 67D was the last of the thin-skinned model and so it had to be modified for the Mercury mission, incorporating a stainless steel reinforcing band installed around the vehicle between stations 502 and 510. A thin sheet of asbestos was installed between the reinforcing band and the tank skin. This modification was installed as a precaution against the type of failure which had occurred on the previous MA-1 flight. The booster&#x27;s flight path was also modified somewhat from Mercury-Atlas 1, being placed on a more shallow trajectory so as to reduce aerodynamic loads.

The Atlas lifted into a clear blue February sky quite different from the cloudy, foggy weather of the MA-1 flight. Everyone in the blockhouse waited nervously for the vehicle to pass through the critical max q zone. When it did so successfully, there was &quot;enormous jubilation&quot; from the launch team. MA-2 flew a successful suborbital mission that lasted 17 minutes 56 seconds. Altitude reached was , speed, . All test objectives were fully met, the only problems being a bit of propellant slosh. The capsule was recovered downrange. Peak acceleration was 15.9 &quot;g&quot; (156 m/s²). Mass 1,154 kg.

Mercury spacecraft #6 and Atlas #67-D were used in the Mercury-Atlas 2 mission. The Mercury capsule is currently displayed at the Houston Museum of Natural Science, Houston, TX.

<doc id="750662" wikidata="Q2329395" url="?curid=750662" title="Franklin (Peanuts)">
<text>Franklin is a fictional character in the comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot;, created by Charles M. Schulz. Introduced on July 31, 1968, Franklin was the first black character in the strip. He is the second person of color to appear in the strip, debuting a year after José Peterson, a polite, biracial athlete of Mexican and Swedish ancestry who was introduced in 1967. Franklin goes to school with Peppermint Patty and Marcie.

In his first appearance, he met Charlie Brown when they were both at the beach. Franklin&#x27;s father was a soldier fighting in Vietnam, to which Charlie Brown replied &quot;My dad&#x27;s a barber... he was in a war too, but I don&#x27;t know which one.&quot; Franklin later paid Charlie Brown a visit and found some of Charlie Brown&#x27;s other friends to be quite odd. His last appearance in the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip was on November 5, 1999, three months before Schulz&#x27;s death.

While his surname is never confirmed in the comic strip, some animated specials, beginning with &quot;You&#x27;re in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown&quot;, give his full name as Franklin Armstrong. Schulz chose the surname as a nod to African-American cartoonist Robb Armstrong, who would later contribute to &quot;Welcome Home, Franklin&quot;, a direct-to-Internet special based around the character.

==Publication==
A Los Angeles schoolteacher named Harriet Glickman wrote to Schulz on April 15, 1968 (11 days after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.), urging him to introduce a black character into &quot;Peanuts&quot;. On April 26, Schulz wrote back, saying that he had thought about this, but was afraid of &quot;patronizing our Negro friends.&quot; This began a correspondence between Schulz and Glickman that led to Schulz&#x27;s creation of Franklin. In an interview in 1997, Schulz discussed receiving a letter from a Southern editor &quot;who said something about, &#x27;I don&#x27;t mind you having a black character, but please don&#x27;t show them in school together.&#x27; Because I had shown Franklin sitting in front of Peppermint Patty... I didn&#x27;t even answer him.&quot;

In a 1988 interview, he recounted other negative reactions towards the integration of Franklin with the white characters. “I finally put Franklin in, and there was one strip where Charlie Brown and Franklin had been playing on the beach, and Franklin said, ‘Well, it’s been nice being with you, come on over to my house some time.’ Again, they didn’t like that.” Schulz argued with Larry Rutman, president of King Features Syndicate at the time (distributor of Peanuts comic strips to newspapers). Schulz said, “I remember telling Larry at the time about Franklin—he wanted me to change it, and we talked about it for a long while on the phone, and I finally sighed and said, “Well, Larry, let’s put it this way: Either you print it just the way I draw it or I quit. How’s that?” Franklin&#x27;s skin color was mentioned in &quot;The Charlie Brown Dictionary&quot;, a picture dictionary using the Peanuts characters; he was referred to in the definition of &quot;black&quot; in showing a picture of him talking on the telephone, where the color of the telephone is black. The description also says that &quot;black may also refer to Franklin&#x27;s skin tone, which is also known as a Negro person.&quot;

==Personality==
In his initial appearances, Franklin seemed confused by all the strange things in Charlie Brown&#x27;s neighborhood, especially Linus and his obsession with the Great Pumpkin. Schulz said of Franklin&#x27;s first appearance, July 31, 1968, when he met Charlie Brown at the beach, &quot;They&#x27;d never met before because they went to different schools,&quot; adding, &quot;but they had fun playing ball so Charlie Brown invited Franklin to visit him.&quot; Franklin quoted the Old Testament, and had no anxieties or obsessions. Franklin and Charlie Brown also enjoyed sharing stories about their grandfathers.

In the animated films and television specials, Franklin is shown to be a skilled dancer. He leads Marcie in a waltz in &quot;Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown&quot;, performs an elaborate break-dancing routine in &quot;It&#x27;s Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown&quot;, and performs another break-dancing number (while also rapping) in &quot;It&#x27;s Spring Training, Charlie Brown&quot;. Franklin also seems to possess some musical ability as he is shown playing instruments from time to time. In the holiday special &quot;Happy New Year, Charlie Brown!&quot;, he is shown playing the guitar at Peppermint Patty&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s party.

==In other media==
As a permanent character of the comic strip, Franklin is also a frequent character in the animated &quot;Peanuts&quot; television specials and movies. Unlike most characters, however, he did not appear in animation until the 1970s with his debut being a silent role in the 1972 movie &quot;Snoopy Come Home&quot; at Snoopy&#x27;s farewell party. His first speaking role is in the 1973 special &quot;There&#x27;s No Time for Love, Charlie Brown&quot;, in which he is voiced by Todd Barbee.

In a &quot;Weekend Update&quot; commentary on a 1992 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Chris Rock, who hyperbolically stated that Franklin had not said a single word for 25 years, related his own childhood experience as the only black student in his grade school class. In another &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cold opening in February 2000, the Saturday after Schulz&#x27;s death, Tim Meadows portrayed a grown-up Franklin (with facial appliances to make his head look as round as the comic strip), eulogizing Schulz on &quot;Nightline&quot;, saying, &quot;Charles Schulz understood regardless of race, we&#x27;re all the same; we have heads as large as our bodies, and our mouths disappear when we turn sideways.&quot;

In the 1994 animated television special &quot;You&#x27;re in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown&quot;, Franklin&#x27;s full name is given as Franklin Armstrong. According to Robb Armstrong, the African-American creator of the comic strip &quot;Jump Start&quot;, Schulz called him during the special&#x27;s production and asked if he could make &quot;Armstrong&quot; Franklin&#x27;s last name, and Robb Armstrong, considering it a &quot;tremendous honor&quot;, gave his permission. Since this surname is never mentioned in the comic strip (nor in any other special for three decades), it is generally considered to be outside of &quot;Peanuts&quot; canon.

Franklin reappeared as a supporting character in 2015&#x27;s &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot;.

In November 2020, BBC Radio 4 broadcast &quot;Franklin&quot;, a radio play based around Schulz&#x27;s creation of Franklin.

In February 2024, &quot;Snoopy Presents: Welcome Home, Franklin&quot;, a special revolving around Franklin&#x27;s introduction to Charlie Brown and his friends, was released. Robb Armstrong continued his contributions to Franklin&#x27;s legacy by co-writing the special, which again gives his surname as Armstrong.

<text>Jim Wych (born 11 January 1955 in Calgary) is a Canadian sports commentator and former professional snooker and pocket billiards player. He turned professional in 1979 and reached the quarter-final of the 1980 World Snooker Championship in his debut year, and reached the world championship quarter-final stage again in 1992. Wych also reached the quarter-finals of two other ranking tournaments, the 1986 British Open and the 1989 European Open. He reached the final of the men&#x27;s doubles at the 1991 World Masters, playing with Brady Gollan.

A two-time Canadian amateur champion, in 1979 and 1999, Wych retired from professional snooker in 1997 and now works mainly as a television pool and snooker commentator, including for Sky Sports, where he started working in the early 1990s.

Wych was ranked in the top 64 players each year for 15 consecutive seasons, from 1980/1981 to 1994/1995. His highest career ranking was 17, in the snooker world ranking lists for 1980/1981 and 1981/1982.

<doc id="750673" wikidata="Q2340368" url="?curid=750673" title="Santa Rosa Mountains (California)">
<text>The Santa Rosa Mountains are a short mountain range in the Peninsular Ranges system, located east of the Los Angeles Basin and northeast of the San Diego metropolitan area of Southern California, in the Southwestern United States.

==Geography==
The Santa Rosa Mountains extend for approximately along the western side of the Coachella Valley within Riverside, San Diego, and Imperial Counties in Southern California. The range connects to the San Jacinto Mountains on its northern end, where the Pines to Palms Highway—California State Route 74, crosses them.

The highest peak in the range is Toro Peak (elevation ), located approximately south of Palm Springs, just south of Route 74, and on the northeast side of Anza-Borrego&#x27;s Upper Coyote Canyon. The Santa Rosa Mountains are also a Great Basin Divide landform for the Salton Sink watershed on the east. Besides Toro Peak, other significant mountains in the range include Santa Rosa Mountain, Martinez Mountain in the north and Rabbit Peak in the south.

==History==
The oldest accounts of the southeastern reaches of the Santa Rosa Mountains survive from the 1774 Spanish expedition led by explorer Juan Bautista de Anza into colonial Las Californias through the Coachella Valley from the populated Viceroyalty of New Spain region (present day Mexico). 19th century maps of the region show the Santa Rosas as a southern extension of the higher northern San Jacinto Mountains. The name &quot;Santa Rosa Mountains&quot; first came into use by the USGS in 1901.

==Flora and fauna==
The Santa Rosa range lies within the Colorado Desert (lower elevations) and California montane chaparral and woodlands (higher elev.) ecoregions of flora and fauna. The California desert chaparral flora and fauna community is found here on the eastern rainshadow side. The mountain peaks contain plants such as the rock draba, Ziegler&#x27;s aster, shaggy-haired alumroot and Davidson&#x27;s stonecrop. Also in the eastern Santa Rosa Mountains, in canyons with natural oases, the native California fan palm (&quot;Washingtonia filifera&quot;) is found. They are also the home of a population of endangered peninsular bighorn sheep, endemic to the Peninsular Ranges and distinct from the desert bighorn sheep.

==Parks and conservation==
Most of the northern portion of the range, in Riverside County, is within the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument. It was created in 2000 and is administered jointly by the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service—San Bernardino National Forest (SBNF). The southern portion of the range, with Toro Peak, is west of the Salton Sea and within the northeastern Borrego Badlands area of the expansive Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. Both provide interpretive visitor centers, trailheads, and many trails for experiencing the Santa Rosa Mountains at all elevations. In 1990 the California Legislature created the Coachella Valley Mountains Conservancy to protect this and other mountain ranges surrounding the Coachella Valley.

<doc id="750683" wikidata="Q3511361" url="?curid=750683" title="William H. Gray III">
<text>William Herbert Gray III (August 20, 1941 – July 1, 2013) was an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who represented from 1979 to 1991. He also served as chairman of the House Committee on the Budget from 1985 to 1989 and House Majority Whip from 1989 to 1991. He resigned from Congress in September of that year to become president and chief executive officer of the United Negro College Fund, a position he held until 2004.

He was the fourth-highest-ranking member of the House at the time of his resignation and a minister in Philadelphia. He was co-founder of the government lobbying and advisory firm, Gray Loeffler LLC, headquartered in Washington, D.C.

==Early life==
Gray was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and spent his early years in Florida, where his father was president of Florida Normal and Industrial Institute in Miami Gardens, and then of Florida A &amp; M College in Tallahassee. In 1949, upon the death of his grandfather, Gray&#x27;s family moved to North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he graduated from Simon Gratz High School. He attended Franklin &amp; Marshall College, where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1963. He went on to obtain a master&#x27;s in divinity from Drew Theological Seminary in 1966 and a master&#x27;s in theology from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1970. Gray received a L.H.D. from Bates College in 1994.

==Career==
In 1972, Gray succeeded his father as the senior minister at Bright Hope Baptist Church in Philadelphia. He was elected as a Democrat to represent Philadelphia in the United States House of Representatives in 1978. He represented Pennsylvania&#x27;s 2nd congressional district in the House of Representatives from 1978 until his resignation on September 11, 1991. He was the first African-American to chair the House Budget Committee and also the first to serve as the Majority Whip (1989–1991). As chairman of the Committee on Budget, Gray introduced H.R. 1460, an anti-Apartheid bill that prohibited loans and new investment in South Africa and enforced sanctions on imports and exports with South Africa. This bill was an instrumental precursor to the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 (H.R. 4868).
Gray resigned unexpectedly from Congress in 1991 to serve as president of the United Negro College Fund from 1991 to 2004. The move was considered surprising and prompted speculation that it may have been connected with an investigation into alleged campaign finance violations by the Gray team. A Pennsylvania Senate seat had been left vacant when Senator John Heinz was killed in a plane crash. Major-party candidates were chosen by the party committees because it was too late for a primary. The speculation was that Attorney General Dick Thornburgh struck a deal with Gray, who not only had been the subject of an investigation into campaign finance irregularities but also a grand jury investigation into his church&#x27;s financial affairs. It was reported that Gray agreed not run in the special election and in return Thornburgh would drop the investigations. Thornburgh resigned as Attorney General and ran for the Senate seat himself, though he lost in an upset to Democrat Harris Wofford.

Gray served as a special adviser to the President and Secretary of State for Haitian affairs in 1994. He was named to the PoliticsPA list of &quot;Pennsylvania&#x27;s Top Political Activists.&quot;

Outside politics he was also a businessman who has been a director at Dell from 2000. Gray was a director of J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., Prudential Financial Inc., Rockwell International Corporation, Visteon Corporation and Pfizer. He retired from Bright Hope Baptist Church in 2007 and was succeeded by Kevin R. Johnson.

==Personal life==
Gray was married to the former Andrea Dash; they had three sons. Gray was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Gray died on July 1, 2013, in London, while attending the Wimbledon tennis tournament.

==Awards and honors==
In 1997 he received the Four Freedoms Award for the Freedom of Worship.

In 2014 President Barack Obama signed U.S. House resolution 4838 directing Amtrak to rename Philadelphia&#x27;s 30th Street Station to William H. Gray III 30th Street Station.

<doc id="750687" wikidata="Q4934911" url="?curid=750687" title="Bobby Curtola">
<text>Robert Allen Curtola, CM (April 17, 1943 – June 4, 2016) was a Canadian rock and roll singer and teen idol.

==History==
Curtola was born in Port Arthur, Ontario, Canada. He began performing at age 15 with a band called Bobby and the Bobcats, singing at high school assemblies. Over the subsequent years, the singer had many songs on the Canadian music charts beginning with &quot;Hand in Hand With You&quot; in 1960. He was backed by the Corvettes, a group who changed their name to The Martels (named after Curtola&#x27;s manager, Maria Martell).

Curtola went on to record hits such as &quot;Indian Giver&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot; and his biggest chart topper, &quot;Fortuneteller&quot; in 1962, which was also successful internationally, selling 2.5 million copies. On June 20, 1962, he performed on Dick Clark&#x27;s American Bandstand. Between 1960 and 1968 he had continual single and album releases on the Tartan label in Canada. The managers and main songwriters were brothers Dyer and Basil Hurdon. The Del-Fi label released some of those singles in the US. He wrote and performed the song &quot;Things go better with Coca-Cola&quot; in 1964 for advertising and was a pitchman for the company.

In 1966 he won a RPM Gold Leaf Award for becoming the first Canadian to have an album go gold. In the early 1970s, Curtola hosted a CTV musical series entitled, &quot;Shake, Rock and Roll&quot; and Curtola went on to a successful singing career at Las Vegas, Nevada casino venues. In the 1980s, in an attempt at updating his image, Curtola briefly adopted the billing Boby Curtola and released at least two singles under this name before reverting to his original spelling.

During his career, the singer achieved 25 Canadian gold singles and 12 Canadian gold albums. In 1998, in recognition of his long service to the Canadian music industry as well as his humanitarian work, particularly with children&#x27;s charities, he was made a member of the Order of Canada. His pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. Curtola also performed on some Princess Cruises ships in the 1990s but also more recently, in 2014, for example.

In addition to his musical work, Curtola was a business entrepreneur, marketing a brand of tomato clam Caesar cocktail called SeaCzar for three years. Curtola founded companies that acquired hotel and truck stops throughout Canada, and in 1991 bid for ownership of the Ottawa Rough Riders. He was chief executive officer of Home Farms Technologies, a Canadian-based company which was attempting to develop an environmentally friendly waste management system for hog waste. It was a development stage company and has been inactive since 2005 according to Government of Canada records.

In 2011, he received a star on the Italian Walk of Fame in Toronto.

Bobby married Ava, his road manager&#x27;s daughter in Edmonton in 1975. They had two boys Christopher in 1977 and Michael in 1979 .

Curtola&#x27;s partner, Karyn Rochford, died in a car accident in Nova Scotia on December 15, 2015.

Curtola had been living in Edmonton, Alberta, Las Vegas, Nevada, and finally Port Mouton, Nova Scotia, but moved back to Edmonton in early 2016 after Rochford&#x27;s death.

Curtola died at his home in Edmonton on June 4, 2016, at age 73. He was posthumously named into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 2019.

<doc id="750689" wikidata="Q4967416" url="?curid=750689" title="Bright Futures Scholarship Program">
<text>Bright Futures is a scholarship program in the state of Florida. It is funded by the Florida Lottery and was first started in 1997.

== History ==
The Bright Futures Scholarship Program was meant to emulate neighboring state Georgia&#x27;s HOPE Scholarship. Originally the Program disbursed just above 42,000 scholarships for about $70 million. At the program&#x27;s peak in 2008, it provided scholarships to 39% of Florida high school graduates, including 94 percent of incoming freshmen and 70 percent of all undergraduates at the University of Florida.

The program was solely based on academic merit and not on financial need, and had an &quot;A level&quot; and a &quot;B level&quot;, plus a vocational scholarship program that could be used at trade schools. The A level covered 100% of tuition and fees while the B level covered 75%. At its height in 2008, the program was criticized for subsidizing the education of students from wealthy families using lottery proceeds collected largely from lower-income individuals. UF Chief Financial Officer Matt Fajack criticized the program for keeping state university tuition artificially low, since any tuition raise would mean that the state would have to spend more money to cover scholarships under the program.

The Florida Legislature enacted cuts to Bright Futures funding in 2011 by increasing the minimum SAT score required to qualify for the program. The changes took full effect for the graduating class of 2014, increasing the minimum score for the &quot;A level&quot;, from 1280 to 1290, and increasing the minimum score for the &quot;B level&quot; from 980 to 1170; as well as decreasing the award amount for the &quot;A level&quot; to only cover 50% of tuition and fees and the &quot;B level&quot; to cover 33%, down from 100% and 75% respectively. The cuts disproportionately impacted black and Latino students as well as students from predominantly poor schools. By the 2015–16 school year, the program covered only 20% of Florida high school graduates and paid an average of $2,000 per year.

In 2014, the United States Department of Education launched an investigation of the Bright Futures program due to allegations of racial bias against black and Latino students, focusing particularly on its effects on students from Miami–Dade County and at Florida International University. The department ultimately found evidence of disparate impacts on minorities but no evidence of discriminatory intent.

2018 saw a massive overhaul of the scholarship, with the &quot;A level&quot; being renamed to &quot;Florida Academic Scholar&quot; (FAS), the &quot;B level&quot; renamed to &quot;Florida Medallion Scholar&quot; (FMS), the vocational program being renamed to &quot;Gold Seal Vocational&quot;, and a new fourth level (also intended for vocational schools) called &quot;Gold Seal CAPE&quot;. Another new award was also added called the Academic Top Scholar (ATS) award, which would be given to the student with the highest academic rank in each Florida county. The FAS and FMS levels returned to their previous values, with the FAS increasing to cover 100% of tuition and fees plus a new $300 per semester book stipend and the FMS increasing to cover 75% of tuition and fees.

In 2021, the book stipend was removed as part of the budgetary process. This change came among many controversies surrounding Florida Senate Bill 86, a piece of legislation that would have made massive structural changes to Bright Future&#x27;s implementation and administration. While SB 86 did not pass, other similar legislation raised the SAT score requirements from 1290 to 1330 for FAS and 1170 to 1210 for FMS, but the ACT score requirement remained the same for both levels. In 2022, the SAT requirement for the FAS level was raised to 1340 (taking effect for 2023–24 graduates), but the SAT requirement at the FMS level and the ACT requirement at both levels remained the same.

==== Renewal requirements ====
At each level, the scholarship is valid for one year and is renewable for up to five years or a specified number of semester hours depending on scholarship level (whichever comes sooner), but certain requirements must be met regarding GPA and courses completed, depending on the level.

* All levels:
**Be enrolled for at least six non-remedial semester credit hours (or equivalent) per term, unless the student needs fewer than six semester hours to complete their degree program;
**Complete a minimum 24 semester hours (or equivalent) per year.
* FAS and ATS: 
** 3.00 GPA, must earn credits in all classes taken, unless withdrawn from (i.e. the student must pass all courses taken, except for courses from which the student withdraws).
* FMS, GSV, and GSC:
** 2.75 GPA, must earn credits in all classes taken, unless withdrawn from.

If a FAS awardee drops below the 3.00 GPA requirement, they are allowed to renew at the FMS level (provided their GPA is still above 2.75). If the student dropped below the threshold during their first year of study they may also be reinstated at the FAS level if they bring their GPA back above 3.00; FMS awardees can also be reinstated if they drop below the 2.75 requirement and then bring their GPA back up during their first year of study, but they cannot earn FAS even if their GPA meets the FAS requirement of 3.00.

If a student withdraws from a course, they must repay Bright Futures for the cost of that course.

If a student is unable to meet annual renewal requirements due to a verifiable illness or other documented emergency (as reported by the post-secondary institution), an exception of one academic year to the renewal timeframe may be granted.

=== Award amounts ===

<doc id="750692" wikidata="Q3990968" url="?curid=750692" title="Thundra">
<text>Thundra is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She is often aligned with the Fantastic Four. She is a powerful, red haired, amazon-like warrior, or Femizon, from a matriarchal, technologically advanced future timeline where men have been subjugated by women.

==Publication history==

Thundra was created by Roy Thomas and John Buscema, and first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #129.

Roy Thomas recalled the character&#x27;s creation, &quot;A 7-foot Amazon type that I conceived as an homage of sorts to characters like Kirby&#x27;s Big Barda in his Fourth World by DC Comics. I asked John Buscema to give her a bandolier around her torso because a number of women&#x27;s-lib types were wearing them (sometimes with real bullets) in photos in newspapers and magazines.&quot;

==Fictional character biography==

Thundra is a warrior woman and time traveler from the 23rd century on Earth-715. In her timeline, Earth is now known as Femizonia and is ruled by Amazon-like overlords (Femizons) who have enslaved Earth&#x27;s men. The former United States is now the &#x27;United Sisterhood Republic&#x27;, and Thundra hails from the megalopolis of Greater Milago (a merged sprawl of Milwaukee and Chicago), located in the United Sisterhood&#x27;s Midwestern Republic. Thundra is renowned as the United Sisterhood&#x27;s most formidable warrior, having been physically enhanced by genetic engineering and trained in combat and tactics from a young age.

She is sent to the 20th century to challenge Fantastic Four member the Thing to a bout of one-on-one combat, believing him to be the strongest male of all time. By beating the Thing in combat, she feels she can prove once and for all that women were superior to the male gender, and finally end a stagnant war between Femizonia and the warlike, male dominated planet of Machus, where the female population had been subjugated by its ruler Mahkizmo.

Thundra is also recruited into the evil group of supervillains known as the Frightful Four by the Wizard, and they battled the Fantastic Four. She secretly has her own agenda and has no real interest in the group. She battled the Thing in personal combat, and then wound up ultimately switching sides and helping the Fantastic Four defeat the Frightful Four after she quits that group.

She later battled the Hulk, who was possessing the Thing&#x27;s body at the time. Thundra later assisted the Fantastic Four against the Frightful Four again, and then assisted the Fantastic Four against Namor the Sub-Mariner. Her time travel from 23rd century Femizonia, an alternate future Earth ruled by women, to prevent the formation of Machus, a planet in her alternate future dimension ruled by men, was finally revealed. Alongside the Fantastic Four, she battled Mahkizmo. She ultimately remained in the 20th century after a dimensional interface of Femizonia and Machus occurred. She later assisted the Fantastic Four and Tigra against the Frightful Four, and then assisted the Fantastic Four, Tigra, and the Impossible Man against the Brute, Mad Thinker, and Annihilus.

Thundra later met wrestling promoter Herkimer Oglethorpe, and on his advice she became a professional wrestler training with the Grapplers, a group of female wrestlers who possess cybernetic-endowed superpowers. In a fixed wrestling match with one Grappler member, Thundra (who has superior strength and fighting skills) is secretly drugged by her opponent, causing her to black out and lose the match.

When she awakens, it was revealed that the Grapplers were agents working for the Roxxon Oil Company, a multinational petroleum company which was covertly involved in developing advanced technology and weaponry for sinister motives. The Grapplers were assigned to trick Thundra into helping them sabotage Project Pegasus, a prison/research facility built for housing supervillains. They were employed to smuggle the Nth Projector out of Project Pegasus.

As a result of the deception by Roxxon and the Grapplers, Thundra came to blows (yet again) with the Thing (in whom she has expressed a romantic interest, on more than one occasion). Alongside the Thing, Quasar, Giant-Man, and the Aquarian, she fought the Nth Man. She encountered the duplicate Hyperion and the Avengers, and battled Ms. Marvel. She is briefly allied with the duplicate Hyperion while still in service to Roxxon, and with him stole the Nth Projector from the Nth Command, before she returned to an alternate Femizonia which did not interface with Machus.

Sometime later, Thundra was revealed as the Empress of Femizonia. She teamed with the Thing to battle Machan rebels. She later abducted the Avengers and Fantastic Four to the future to enlist their aid in defending Femizonia from the extra-dimensional warlord Arkon and his warriors from Polemachus. She fought Arkon in personal combat, and became romantically inclined toward him.

However, Thundra has a special place in her heart for Ben Grimm. In addition to her amorous advances, the two have been involved in numerous superheroic adventures; one significant pairing of the two involved enlisting Grimm to help liberate Femizonia from a powerful, six-armed android sent from Machus to conquer the Femizons. After defeating the android, Grimm informed Thundra that they could never be together, expressing his love for Alicia Masters. Thundra then allowed him to return to the 20th century.

===Secret Invasion: Inhumans===
Medusa and Crystal infiltrate Thundra&#x27;s present-day homeland to retrieve part of a device required to rescue Black Bolt from the Skrulls. As tensions between the two disguised women boil over, Thundra appears and compels them to undertake the ritual combat required of the society to resolve the disagreement. Thundra is convinced to hand over the Skrull intelligence agent after Crystal makes an impassioned speech.

===Lady Liberators===
Thundra, Sue Storm and Valkyrie team up with She-Hulk and her Skrull partner Jazinda (masquerading as a Shi&#x27;ar) to forcibly distribute stagnating aid in the corrupt country of Marinmer.

===Alliance with the Red Hulk===
The Red Hulk battles the Lady Liberators and tricks them into believing they caused him to pass out. Red Hulk then kidnaps Thundra, and offers her an alliance after deducing she was the only one of the group that was willing to kill him. After agreeing to the alliance, Thundra becomes a subordinate of the Intelligencia, a group of genius villains founded by Leader. After Red Hulk is betrayed by the Intelligencia in the &quot;Fall of the Hulks&quot; storyline, Thundra aids him in his escape and leaves the group. Since her departure from the group, her daughter Lyra has joined their ranks.

==Powers and abilities==
As a result of genetic engineering, Thundra has vast superhuman strength and resistance to physical injury sufficient to allow her to stand toe to toe with the likes of the Thing. Her speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes are heightened to the peak of natural human capability. She has undergone intensive pain-management training.

Trained as a warrior, with extensive training in the hand-to-hand and military combat techniques of the 23rd century, she is a seasoned combat veteran who possesses superior fighting skills and is considered to be the greatest warrior among her people. Thundra is also a skilled combatant with a sword or her three-foot linked chain, the latter of which is her weapon of choice, often attached to a bracelet on her left forearm.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Avengers Forever&quot;===
An alternate timeline variant of Thundra appears in &quot;Avengers Forever&quot; as a member of the Avengers.

===Hulk: Raging Thunder===
A possible future variant of Thundra appears in &quot;Hulk: Raging Thunder&quot; and &quot;Fall of the Hulks: Red Hulk&quot;. This version was captured by scientists, who impregnated her with cell scrapings from the Hulk. She would later give birth to a green-skinned daughter named Lyla, who would go on to become the new She-Hulk.

===&quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;===
Thundra appears in &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;.

===&quot;Marvel Zombies: Return&quot;===

<text>John William &quot;Jimmie&quot; Crutchfield (March 25, 1910 – April 1, 1993) was a professional baseball outfielder in Negro league baseball from 1930 to 1945.

==Career==
Crutchfield began his career with the Birmingham Black Barons in 1930 but the following year moved to the Indianapolis ABC&#x27;s. When the team ran into financial difficulties, he left to play with the Pittsburgh Crawfords, where he remained for the next five years. Teamed with Ted Page and Cool Papa Bell, they formed what is considered the best outfield in the Negro leagues. During this time, his performance earned him three appearances in the East-West All-Star game. In the 1935 game, Crutchfield made an astonishing catch when he chased down a long drive and leapt in the air, catching the ball in his bare hand. In 1941 he was named an All-Star again, this time as a member of the Chicago American Giants.

Crutchfield served in the military during World War II from 1943 to 1944. After his baseball career was over, he went to work for the United States Postal Service.
Crutchfield died in Chicago in 1993 and was interred in the nearby Burr Oak Cemetery, Alsip, Illinois, buried in an unmarked grave until 2004 when Peoria, Illinois anesthesiologist Jeremy Krock contacted members of the Society for American Baseball Research to try to get a proper headstone on the grave of Crutchfield, who originally comes from the same town as Krock. This launched the Negro Leagues Baseball Grave Marker Project of which Dr. Krock still works with today.

<text>Stuart Little 2 is a 2002 American live-action/animated comedy film directed by Rob Minkoff and starring Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie, and Jonathan Lipnicki, and the voices of Michael J. Fox as Stuart Little, Melanie Griffith as Margalo, Nathan Lane as Snowbell, and James Woods as Falcon. Although a sequel to the 1999 film &quot;Stuart Little&quot;, the plot bears more resemblance to the original book by E.B. White, in which Stuart and Snowbell meet a canary named Margalo.

&quot;Stuart Little 2&quot; premiered in Westwood on July 14, 2002, and was released in theaters for the rest of North America and the United Kingdom on July 19 by Columbia Pictures, and grossed $170 million against a $120 million budget, with it also receiving positive critical reviews. It was followed by a third film, a direct-to-video sequel titled &quot;Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild&quot; in 2005.

==Plot==
Three years after being adopted by the Littles and defeating Smokey, Stuart Little has settled into family life with his parents, older brother George, and baby sister Martha, who has yet to say her first words. Stuart is becoming tired of his adoptive mother Eleanor&#x27;s overprotectiveness due to his small size, and is finding himself lonely when George would rather play with his own friend, Will. When playing by himself, Stuart accidentally wrecks George&#x27;s toy plane, prompting George to furiously throw it into a trash can. Stuart&#x27;s adoptive father Frederick tells him there is a &#x27;silver lining&#x27; to every bad situation, and encourages him to find a new friend of his own.

When driving home from school in his roadster, Stuart meets Margalo, a canary who falls into his car. Margalo states she has injured her wing being chased by a predatory Falcon, and Stuart takes her home to recover. Unbeknownst to the Littles, Margalo is in fact physically healthy, and is working with Falcon to steal precious items from households. However, she soon bonds with the Littles, and feels immense guilt over what she is planning to do; Falcon warns her that if she does not complete their plan, he will kill Stuart. Margalo steals Eleanor&#x27;s ring, prompting Stuart to venture down the Littles&#x27; kitchen drain in an unfruitful attempt to find it again. He soon finds himself in trouble, but Margalo rescues him; realizing the danger she is putting him in, she leaves the next morning. Stuart becomes convinced Falcon has kidnapped her, and sets off to find her with the family cat Snowbell, convincing George to conduct a series of elaborate (and extremely unconvincing) lies to Eleanor in order to cover for him.

Stuart and Snowbell seek out Smokey&#x27;s right-hand street-cat Monty, who tells them that Falcon lives at the top of the Pishkin Building, and warns that he is an extremely dangerous foe. Stuart uses a balloon to fly to the summit of the Pishkin Building, but is taken aback when Margalo reveals her alliance with Falcon. Falcon traps Margalo in a paint can, and attempts to kill Stuart by dropping him from the sky; Stuart instead lands in a garbage truck and is taken to a garbage barge out at sea. Initially devastated at the series of events, Stuart soon remembers the time he saved Snowbell from Smokey and finds his silver lining by rediscovering and subsequently repairing George&#x27;s broken toy plane, which he uses to fly back to land. Meanwhile, George, after being reprimanded by his parents for his deception and interrogated on Stuart&#x27;s true whereabouts, confesses where Stuart is to them, prompting them to head out and look for him.

In the meantime, Snowbell has also ventured up the Pishkin Building, and frees Margalo from the paint can, only to become trapped in it himself. Margalo breaks free from Falcon&#x27;s control, and flies away with Eleanor&#x27;s ring, prompting Falcon to give chase. Stuart arrives in his toy plane, and a furious chase occurs through Manhattan, with the Littles following from behind. Stuart ultimately wins the battle by using the ring to blind Falcon&#x27;s vision, before jumping from the plane and allowing it to crash into Falcon as he falls into a trash can and is presumably eaten by Monty. The day saved, Frederick and Eleanor forgive Stuart for running away and George for lying to them, and tell them they are extremely proud of them for their bravery. Later, Margalo fulfills her dream of flying south for the winter, planning on returning to the Little household in the spring. Martha stuns everyone by using her first words to say goodbye to Margalo.

==Reception==

The film had an opening weekend gross of $15.1 million, ranking in second place narrowly behind &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;. The domestic total was $65 million and the worldwide total was $170 million against an estimated production budget of $120 million, less than its predecessor.

===Critical reception===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 81% based on 124 reviews, with an average score of 6.90/10.

Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Ann Hornaday wrote a positive review in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, noting how the film&#x27;s idealized setting makes it family-friendly. Hornaday praised the vocal performances of Fox, Griffith, and Woods in their roles as Stuart, Margalo, and Falcon, respectively, as well as the characters&#x27; computer animation: &quot;The animated characters engage in such natural movements and, more important, exude such subtle emotional expression that they mesh seamlessly with their live-action counterparts.&quot; Tom Shen of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, described the film as &quot;fairly formulaic&quot;, but praised its jokes as &quot;hilarious&quot;, especially those coming from the character of Snowbell, the Littles&#x27; cat.

<doc id="750695" wikidata="Q640793" url="?curid=750695" title="Sikelgaita">
<text>Sikelgaita (also &quot;Sichelgaita&quot;, &quot;Sigelgaita&quot;, or &quot;Gaita&quot;) (c. 1040 – 16 April 1090) was a Lombard princess, the daughter of Prince Guaimar IV of Salerno and second wife of Duke Robert Guiscard of Apulia. Her heritage made her a vital asset to Robert&#x27;s governance in Southern Italy, legitimizing his reign and that of his successors. Sikelgaita frequently accompanied Robert on campaigns and is noted for leading troops in battle. She continued to be a significant source of support for her primary heir, Roger Borsa, and remained actively involved in politics until her death.

==Background and early life==
Sikelgaita was born in 1040 to Prince Guaimar IV of Salerno and his wife Gemma. Little is known of her earlier life or upbringing but she grew up with many siblings. According to Balfour, there isn&#x27;t any reason to suspect that she received any military or other extraordinary education. Her father had a successful career expanding the borders of the principality of Salerno over large territories in Southern Italy, including many important cities, still to peak when she was born. This was brought to an abrupt end when he and his brother were murdered by Sikelgaita&#x27;s four maternal uncles when she was still young in 1052. Guaimar&#x27;s Norman allies avenged him at the behest of his surviving brother Guy, declaring Sikelgaita&#x27;s brother Gisulf II the new prince of Salerno. One of her sisters, Gaitelgrima, had earlier married Robert&#x27;s half-brother Drogo, and another Gaitelgrima later married Robert&#x27;s nephew Jordan I of Capua.
===Marriage to Robert===
The Normans had been present in Southern Italy since before Sikelgaita was born, one of them on the rise was Robert Guiscard who had inherited the county of Apulia and Calabria from Humphrey, his brother, in 1057. Robert&#x27;s conquest reached a point where he needed to consolidate his land through a marriage alliance. Because his son, Bohemond, was an infant and much too young to marry Sikelgaita he decided to marry her himself. Gisulf was reluctant of the marriage. Norwich ascertains that Gisulf had always hated the Normans and considered them barbarians but would accept on the condition that Robert pacified William, Robert&#x27;s younger brother, and Richard I of Capua both of which he considered a threat to his principality. According to Valerie Eads, Gisulf instead relented because of a late payment of tribute that Gisulf owed Robert and could compensate with his concent to the marriage. Regardless, Sikelgaita married Robert in December 1058, after Robert divorced his first wife Alberada, due to supposed consanguinity. The divorce from Alberada and the marriage to Sikelgaita were probably part of a strategy of alliance with the remaining Lombard princes, of whom Gisulf was the prince. One year later after their marriage, Richard was raised to the title of Duke by Pope Nicholas II at the Synod of Melfi at the end of August.

==Duchess of Apulia==
In the first few years of marriage, Sikelgaita appears inactive politically. Skinner explains that her primary objective in the first few years was to produce male heirs to secure Robert&#x27;s claim on the Lombard lands. She started to appear in charters next to Robert in 1065 and because Robert was frequently in conflict with his neighbours and his vassals she would remain close to him throughout their marriage. Sikelgaita showed her ambition to ensure her son inherited Robert&#x27;s lands early. When Robert once was close to death in 1073, she made their vassals swear allegiance to her eldest son Roger as heir over her older stepson Bohemond. Other than bearing children, Sikelgaita&#x27;s purpose to Robert was to strengthen his claim to his land and ensure that her ancestry gave peace to the vassals who would otherwise rebel because of his status as a foreigner as well as grant her prestigious ancestry to their children. 

===Conflict with Gisulf of Salerno===
Despite their alliance through Robert and Sikelgaita&#x27;s marriage, Robert and Sikelgaita&#x27;s brother Gisulf II of Salerno had a strenuous relationship. Robert continuously made encroaching acquisitions of land around his principality, most notably the city of Amalfi in 1073. Sikelgaita tried to mediate between her brother and husband, but Gisulf is said to have told her that he would make her a widow. Robert soon responded by laying siege to Salerno in the summer of 1076. Gisulf was unprepared to deal with a prolonged siege and the city surrendered in December 1076, while the last of Gisulf&#x27;s forces held out in the inner citadel until May 1077. Robert and Sikelgaita made Salerno their new capital after the conquest. Because Sikelgaita was so important to Robert&#x27;s legitimacy she was on occasion recognised as co-ruler in Salerno, and on two occasions she was titled duke and not duchess in charters in Salerno. Skinner argues that this is Robert acknowledging Sikelgaita&#x27;s right to the principality is stronger than his own.

===Military campaigns 1080–1085===

Sikelgaita frequently accompanied Robert on his campaigns but often as a prize or show of legitimacy for the Lombard following. Valerie Eads notes that after the siege of Salerno and years of childbearing ended, her military career took form in 1080.

Her first military objective was conducting the siege of Trani in 1080 while Robert moved against Taranto to defeat the rebels. The siege was successful and the rebel Peter II of Trani had to concede defeat. It is unknown to what extent she was in charge of the siege or why she was left there. Eads suggests that there were only so many he could trust who also had the loyalty of the Lombard troops. She argues that any kin with a claim to Robert&#x27;s lands could easily betray him and that he needed his wife to be the guarantor of loyalty.

Sikelgaita also participated in the invasion of Dyrrhachium in 1081 against the Byzantine Empire. At first, it is said that she tried to persuade Robert not to attack the Byzantine Empire because she argued Christians should not fight other Christians. Sikelgaita likely participated due to similar reasons as before, a lack of loyal generals and steadfast ambition to protect the interest of her son and heir. Another possibility could be that the men she was sent to command were soldiers from Salerno and could be considered Sikelgaita&#x27;s men due to her claim.

In 1083, Sikelgaita returned to Italy with Robert to defend Pope Gregory VII against the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV. By 1084 Robert and Sikelgaita once again turned their eyes towards the Byzantines in a second campaign during which Robert soon fell sick and died on Kefalonia 17 July 1085 with Sikelgaita at his side.

====Role in battle====
Whether or not Sikelgaita fought in battle is not known. The Byzantine historian Anna Comnena, the daughter of Emperor Alexios I with whom Robert and Sikelgaita battled in 1081 at Dyrrhachium, wrote in the &quot;Alexiad&quot; that Sikelgaita was on the field in full armour, rallying her and Robert&#x27;s troops with a spear when the Byzantine army initially repulsed them and was in danger of losing cohesion. According to Skinner, Anna Comnena&#x27;s description and tale of Sikelgaita is an attempt at discrediting and effeminating the Norman army by claiming they needed a Lombard woman to make them fight. Eads adds that Comnena&#x27;s account is fanciful since Sikelgaita would not have been heard in battle among the chaos and that the only way for her to communicate with her troops would have been by waving a spear-like banner behind her troops. Comnena also said that Sikelgaita was &quot;like another Pallas, if not a second Athena,&quot; in reference to her bravery. Eads notes that Comnena&#x27;s description of Sikelgaita echos that of Roman writing on Boudica and it is not the only reference to other older literature as she attributes to her a quote from the &quot;Iliad&quot;.

John Julius Norwich argued that &quot;in her we come face to face with the closest approximation in history to a Valkyrie. A woman of immense build and herculean physical strength, she hardly ever left her husband&#x27;s side—least of all in battle, one of her favourite occupations. [...] At such moments, charging magnificently into the fray, her long blond hair streaming out from beneath her helmet, deafening friend and foe alike with huge shouts of encouragement or imprecation, she must have looked — even if she did not altogether sound — worthy to take her place among the daughters of Wotan.&quot; Balfour argues against this notion and says: &quot;The image of Sichelgaita as a ‘Valkyrie’ or warrior princess is misleading, insofar as there is no evidence that she was ever an actual combatant.&quot;

William of Apulia, a contemporary poet employed by Roger Brosa, wrote a different account of Sikelgaita during the battle of Dyrrhachium in his poem &quot;The Deeds of Robert Guiscard&quot;. According to William, she is supposed to have fled with fear of her life during the battle trying to board an enemy ship after being wounded by a stray arrow but god saved her from ridicule. Historian Paul Brown points out that William&#x27;s patronage is only acknowledged in the end of the poem and that the patron might be disputable. Eads suggests that William&#x27;s account might have been a choice encouraged by Sikelgaita herself to not overshadow her son and that it is unlikely that he lied about a battle wound that could easily have been verified at court by the actors in his poem. She also adds that this account explains why she would wear armour because &quot;Combatant or not, she was in danger of death or capture like any of her troops.&quot;

==Widowhood==
After Robert&#x27;s death, Sikelgaita managed to name Roger Borsa as the heir to his titles although she remained an active actor. Skinner suggests that she was reluctant to give up power and step aside in favour of her son or step-son. Among several charters she signed with her son she put the Jews of Bari under that city&#x27;s archbishop.

In his &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica,&quot; Orderic Vitalis states that she had studied and learned about the use of poisons among the doctors of the Schola Medica Salernitana. With this knowledge, she tried to poison Robert&#x27;s son Bohemond but got caught and forced to give him a remedy. Norwich ascertains that there is no evidence to suggest that this happened and that it probably comes from a perspective that supports Bohemond as the heir to Robert&#x27;s titles. Sikelgaita had all right to be concerned by Bohemund even though the two eventually came to an agreement under which her son Roger Borsa was allowed to succeed Robert in the duchy. It did not stop Bohemund from seeing his legal right to his father&#x27;s inheritance as the senior child. Fortunately for Sikelgaita, Bohemund found little support among the Roger Borsa&#x27;s vassals.

Early in 1086, Sikelgaita was in Salerno donating the town of Cetraro in Robert&#x27;s honour to Monte Cassino, which the couple had endowed well throughout their married life. Sikelgaita donated a large amount of silver for her health while she was ill on another occasion. She later died on 16 April 1090 and was buried in Monte Cassino &quot;at her request&quot;.

==Issue==
William of Apulia wrote in his poem that Robert had through Sikelgaita &quot;three sons and five daughters&quot;:
*Maud, the eldest married Raymond Berengar II of Barcelona and then Aimeric I, Viscount of Narbonne.
*Roger Borsa
*Guy
*Robert Scalio
*Sybil, married Ebles II, Count of Roucy.
*Mabel, married William de Grandmesnil.
*Unnamed daughter, married Hugh V, Count of Maine.
*Olympias, betrothed to Konstantios Doukas, son of Michael VII Ducas and Maria Bagrationi, in 1074 and given the name Helena.

Historian Ferdinand Chalandon found two additional daughters to Robert and Sikelgaita:
*Cecilia, of whom nothing is known.
*Gaitelgrima, who married first a man called Drogo and then another called Humphrey.

==Sikelgaita in pop culture==
* Sikelgaita is featured as a non-playable character in &quot;Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition&quot; through the &quot;Lords of the West&quot; expansion. She appears in the &quot;Bohemond and the Emperor&quot; scenario as a villain, being Bohemond&#x27;s wicked stepmother who refuses to help him fight the Normans, with the closing cutscene showing Robert Guiscard&#x27;s death from illness, with speculation that she poisoned him.

<doc id="750700" wikidata="Q1365323" url="?curid=750700" title="Dance pad">
<text>A dance pad, also known as a dance mat or dance platform, is a flat electronic game controller used for input in dance games. Most dance pads are divided into a 3×3 matrix of square panels for the player to stand on, with some or all of the panels corresponding to directions or actions within the game. Some dance pads also have extra buttons outside the main stepping area, such as &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;Select&quot;. Pairs of dance pads often are joined, side by side, for certain gameplay modes.

Popular arcade games such as &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;, &quot;In the Groove&quot;, &quot;Pump It Up&quot;, and StepManiaX use large steel dance platforms connected to the arcade cabinet, whereas versions for home consoles usually use smaller (often flexible) plastic pads. These home pads are specifically made for systems such as the GameCube, Wii, Dreamcast (Japan only), PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, but can also be used in computer simulators such as &quot;StepMania&quot; through the use of special adapters.

==Types==

=== Soft===

&quot;Soft&quot; pads are thin and made of plastic. They generally cost $10–$20 USD. They are good for beginners to dance games or casual use, but they have a tendency to move around and wrinkle up during gameplay (unless &quot;modded&quot;, such as by gluing or taping them to the top of a piece of plywood or the bottom of a transparent office chair mat). They are not usually durable and may wear out easily, but for light use they are quite suitable. Manufacturers of soft pads include Konami, BNSUSA, RedOctane, Intec, Mad Catz (Beat Pad), MyMyBox, Naki International, and Nintendo (Action Pad). OEM manufacturers include Topway (manufacturer of RedOctane pads), Futime, and many others.

Some soft pads contain stiff foam inserts of the dense or hard varieties to provide more stability and durability. The inserts usually ship as three or six puzzle pieces (to allow for a smaller box) which fit together using a dovetail joint and slide into the dance pad, which then zips closed around the foam. Certain brands of foam pads put raised plastic sections under the directional buttons to allow them to be more easily felt by a player&#x27;s feet, so as to help keep them centered on the pad. These pads generally cost between $40 and $100.

It is also possible to modify a pad by attaching it to a hard surface and optionally covering it with clear material; this can increase pad life and keep it from slipping around.

=== Hard ===

&quot;Hard&quot; pads are usually constructed with metal (and sometimes wood) for durability, and usually come with a raised bar behind the player. Arcade machines use very durable metal pads that are designed for heavy use. Other hard pads can be purchased for home use with a video game system; the prices can be around US$100 to $350 ($200–$600 for double pads) - $700 to $1000+ online. Manufacturers of hard pads include DDRgame, Cobalt Flux, L-TEK, MyMyBox, Brown Box, RedOctane (ceased production as of February 2010 due to company termination) and Naki International.

Hard pads are used in all arcade versions of music games that employ dance pads, and often serve as the &quot;nec plus ultra&quot; for DIY Gamers that attempt to construct &quot;Homebrew pads.&quot; Many Homebrew kits are ultimately instruction guides for converting soft pads into hard pads, although Homebrew hard pads often feature additional functions such as additional inputs (see below).

=== Solid State ===

&quot;Solid State&quot; pads replace the usual mechanical switch and contact used in other hard pads. A proximity sensor is used to detect a player&#x27;s steps on the pad. The advantages of a solid state design is that they do not require pressure to activate, eliminating moving parts that might break down and keeping dirt from getting into the mechanism.

=== Caveats ===
Problems are often encountered when attempting to use a PlayStation pad with a computer simulator. Most PlayStation-PC adapters will not register Up and Down, or Left and Right, simultaneously initially, although they are common &quot;jumps&quot; in dance games. This is because normal PlayStation games do not require such input, and because D-pads are not usually designed to physically permit such input. &quot;StepMania&quot;&#x27;s website has a section concerning adapter compatibility. Although these devices may work on a PC, to date, the adapters will not work with consoles that have built in USB ports such as the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

Purchasers of home pads should be aware of the number and arrangement of active arrow panels that are required by the game(s) they want to play. Although most commercial pads have four arrow panels (DDR/In The Groove), some have five (Pump It Up), six (Dance Dance Revolution Solo 2000), eight (Dance:UK), (MC Groovz Dance Craze), or nine (Technomotion).

==Homebrew pads==
Not satisfied with the cost and/or reliability of factory assembled metal dance pads, many players construct their own dance pad. Using common materials (such as plywood, sheet metal, and acrylic glass or polycarbonate) found at local hardware stores, do-it-yourselfers are able to construct a pad that is often much more durable and more authentic-feeling than commercially built hard pads. Some homebrew pads have extra features such as additional arrows (for playing Pump It Up or DDR Solo), menu switches and pushbuttons, and bars. Furthermore, the homebrew pads are easier to repair because they use common parts, and are usually designed for easy disassembly.

While some homebrew pads use custom electronics built from scratch, most homebrew pads make use a circuit board from a standard controller to simplify the process of interfacing the pad with a gaming system. The controller used depends on the system that the pad is intended to be played with (GameCube, PlayStation, Xbox, or PC).

Homebrew pads use a variety of technologies for designing the arrows that the player is supposed to step on. The most common design uses metal contacts that sandwich together when the player steps on the pad or arcade button switches but some novel ideas have been proposed such as the use of optical, pressure, vibration, or proximity sensors.

Due to the amount of work needed to create a custom metal pad, some players instead opt to modify their existing soft pads. Most of the time, players will sometimes take plywood sheets, acrylic, or office chair floor protectors and staple it to their soft pads. This effectively cures wrinkling and makes the pad more durable to use while wearing shoes.

==Educational use==

A dance pad has been also used in experimental systems for navigating through virtual environments, such as those reproducing historical buildings.

==Other games==
Some games that can be played with dance pads do not involve pressing the arrow buttons on the pad to keep with the rhythm of a song:
* Many games developed for the NES Power Pad
* Breakthrough Gaming Presents: Axel
* The minigames of Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix (Gamecube)
*Active Life series for Wii (Active Life: Outdoor Challenge, Active Life: Explorer, Active Life: Extreme Challenge, Active Life: Magical Carnival)
* Kraft Rocking the Boat
* Kraft Soccer Striker
* Kraft Virtual Dojo
* Exult - using Dance Pad Walking controller mod
* DDR-A-Mole, a game similar to Whac-A-Mole
* Various mini-games in &quot;Dance Praise 2: The ReMix&quot; (DanceTris, a Tetris simulator, is included).
* The 2014 rogue-like rhythm game &quot;Crypt of the NecroDancer&quot; and some other games on Steam like &quot;The Metronomicon: Slay the Dance Floor&quot; (RPG elements in addition to dancing) and Vectronom
*Indie games with dance pad support on Itch.io

<doc id="750702" wikidata="Q4931058" url="?curid=750702" title="Bo Brady and Hope Williams">
<text>Beauregard &quot;Bo&quot; Brady and Hope Williams Brady are fictional characters and the signature supercouple on the American daytime drama &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. Bo is portrayed by Peter Reckell and Hope is portrayed by Kristian Alfonso. On internet message boards, the couple is often referred by the portmanteau &quot;Bope&quot; (for Bo and Hope). Along with &quot;General Hospital&#x27;s&quot; Luke and Laura Spencer, Bo and Hope are considered to be one of daytime television&#x27;s most iconic couples.

== Storyline ==

Bo Brady and Hope Williams changed the face of daytime when rebel Bo came riding into town on his motorcycle in 1983 and fell for the rich and feisty Hope Williams, whom he later nicknamed Fancy Face.

One of the most momentous occasions in the couple&#x27;s history involved the moment when Bo kidnapped Hope from her wedding to sly politician Larry Welch. Bo and Hope rode off together on Bo&#x27;s motorcycle, while Bo&#x27;s friend Howie stood in for the bride. Unfortunately, Larry&#x27;s goons kidnapped Hope and she was forced to marry him anyway after Larry threatened her family. Hope then spent most of the summer of 1984 trapped in a loveless marriage to Larry, but was successfully able to keep the marriage from being consummated by claiming that she was pregnant with Bo&#x27;s child (Hope was in fact still a virgin at this point as her and Bo&#x27;s previous attempts to make love had been interrupted). Hope met Bo in secret and reaffirmed that her love was for him. Eventually Bo and Hope made love in an old plantation in New Orleans and shortly thereafter Hope was able to escape from Larry&#x27;s clutches (though he would seek revenge in 2002).
Bo and Hope are also known for their adventures. From England to New York, they were no conventional couple. Bo and Hope&#x27;s royal wedding on location in England was one of the most spectacular weddings on daytime television. Hope&#x27;s dress cost around $35,000.

In their many years on the show, the couple has survived plenty of tragedy, including Hope&#x27;s identity crisis when she was temporarily brainwashed by Stefano DiMera to think she was a princess, and Bo&#x27;s struggle to find his daughter, Georgia. They are the parents of Shawn-Douglas Brady, Zack Brady and Ciara Brady. Bo Brady and Billie Reed&#x27;s daughter, Georgia, whom they believed to be stillborn, was found to be alive as Salem&#x27;s teenage bad girl Chelsea Brady.

The supercouple&#x27;s strength was tested with the loss of their middle child, Zack, who was taken off life support after a hit and run accident caused by Chelsea. Many fans were supportive of both the realistic storyline and Kristian Alfonso&#x27;s depiction of a mother losing a child.

As a result of the accident, Hope pushed Bo away, blaming him for Chelsea&#x27;s actions and getting her out of legal trouble. Once Hope learned that Bo had nothing to do with the evidence against Chelsea disappearing, the two seemed to be reconnecting. However, when new evidence was found exonerating Patrick, Hope couldn&#x27;t believe she allowed Bo to pit her against Patrick.

Hope found out she was pregnant, with what she thought was Patrick&#x27;s child; the baby was actually Bo&#x27;s and Patrick had the results changed. Even with this, Bo and Hope continued to grow closer and soon fell back in love over Christmas. Patrick realized this and soon kidnapped Hope and took her to an abandoned warehouse where he planned to take her out of town. Unfortunately for Patrick, Bo soon found them right as Hope&#x27;s water broke! Bo busted in and helped her deliver the new baby girl on December 29, 2006. Patrick then told Bo that he had bribed Hope&#x27;s doctor into changing the test results to show that he was the father when Bo really was! Patrick went to jail and Bo and Hope went to the hospital with their &quot;new miracle.&quot;

Bo and Hope currently live together with their new born daughter Ciara Brady, who got her name through a viewer vote. The lives of their other children, Shawn and Chelsea, had some rough patches, but is now looking up. Shawn was on the run with then ex-girlfriend Belle Black and their daughter Claire. Chelsea has gone through an ordeal after killing her half-brother Zack. She also has an up and down relationship with her boyfriend Nick Fallon.

After Bo faced a health crisis in March 2008, in which Chelsea saved his life by donating part of her pancreas, Bo started planning a surprise for Hope. On August 7, 2008, Bo and Hope renewed their vows in front of family and friends. Hope got a new wedding ring, since she threw the other one in the ocean in 2006 in a fit of anger, and Bo received Pop Shawn&#x27;s old wedding ring. They separated briefly in 2010 when Hope was arrested, and Bo got back together with Carly. However, Carly dumped him after they saved Hope, realizing that Bo never stopped loving his wife.
On October 30, 2012, Bo left town with his mother in order for her to undergo treatment for Alzheimers. Bo and Caroline returned to Salem a month later in November 2012; however, with portrayer Peter Reckell vacating the role earlier in the year, Bo has been reverted to an offscreen character, only being mentioned verbally by family and friends now.

Hope divorced Bo in September 2014, after not hearing from him for many months.

In November 2015, in celebration of Days&#x27; 50th Anniversary, Bo returned after being held captive. He broke free with friend Patch [Stephen Nichols], who searched to bring him back to Salem. On November 9, 2015, Bo returned home and saved Hope from being killed by her new husband, Aiden Jennings. Aiden was killed by Bo. Bo started not feeling well; he was getting headaches and blacking out. Bo was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor and didn&#x27;t have much time to live. On November 20, 2015, Bo &amp; Hope spent time in the park where they first met; Bo went pale and died in Hope&#x27;s arms. It started snowing, making the vision from Caroline to be true.

== Cultural impact ==

The romantic pairing of Bo Brady and Hope Williams was nominated for &quot;Most Irresistible Combination&quot; at the 32nd Daytime Emmy Awards.

The pairing won the &quot;America&#x27;s Favorite Supercouple&quot; award at the 2002 Emmy Awards.

In 2005, SOAPnet celebrated &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; 40th anniversary by airing a marathon of Bo and Hope episodes. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; calls them one of the greatest supercouples.

In May 2009 Kristian Alfonso and Peter Reckell were invited to be international guests at the Australian Logie awards

Kristian Alfonso and Peter Reckell were the faces of Avon&#x27;s Blue Rush perfume advertising campaign.

Alfonso and Reckell appeared in character on the NBC television series 30 Rock in the episode Dealbreakers Talk Show#0001. They appeared in a scene airing on Liz Lemon&#x27;s television and made comments about the titles from Liz&#x27;s failed talk show appearing on a hospital TV.

<text>Seth Carlo Chandler, Jr. (September 16, 1846 – December 31, 1913) was an American astronomer, geodesist, and actuary.

He was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Seth Carlo and Mary (née Cheever) Chandler. During his last year in high school he performed mathematical computations for Benjamin Peirce, of the Harvard College Observatory.

After graduating, he became the assistant of Benjamin A. Gould. Gould was director of the Longitude Department of the United States Coast Survey, a United States Government agency responsible for geodetic surveys. When Gould left to become director of the national observatory in Argentina, Chandler also left and became an actuary. However, he continued to work in astronomy as an amateur affiliated with Harvard College Observatory. 

Chandler married Caroline Margaret Herman on October 20th, 1870. They were married for 47 years before Seth Carlo Chandler&#x27;s death in 1913 and had several daughters together.
Chandler is best remembered for his research on what is today known as the Chandler wobble. His research on polar motion spanned nearly three decades.

Chandler also made contributions to other areas of astronomy, including variable stars. He independently co-discovered the nova T Coronae Borealis, improved the estimate of the constant of aberration, and computed the orbital parameters of asteroids and comets.

Chandler was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1896 and the James Craig Watson Medal in 1894.

The crater Chandler on the Moon is named after him.

<text>Karla Leanne Homolka (born May 4, 1970), also known as Karla Leanne Teale, Leanne Teale and Leanne Bordelais, is a Canadian serial killer who acted as an accomplice to her husband, Paul Bernardo, taking active part in the rapes and murders of at least three minors in Ontarioincluding her own sister, Tammy Homolkabetween 1990 and 1992.

Homolka attracted worldwide media attention when a controversial plea bargain with Ontario prosecutors meant she was only convicted of manslaughter, and served only twelve years for the torture, rapes and murders of the other victims, Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French. Homolka testified against Bernardo, who was convicted of the Mahaffy–French murders and received life imprisonment and a dangerous offender designation.

Homolka&#x27;s plea bargain came about after she told investigators that she had been Bernardo&#x27;s unwilling accomplice as a result of domestic violence. However, videotapes of the crimes surfaced after the plea bargain and before Bernardo&#x27;s trial which showed that Homolka had been a more active participant than she had originally claimed, including in the rape and death of her sister. As a result, the plea bargain that she had struck with prosecutors was dubbed in the Canadian press the &quot;Deal with the Devil&quot;. Public outrage about the deal continued until Homolka&#x27;s high-profile release from prison in 2005.

Following her release, Homolka settled in Quebec, where she married a brother of her lawyer. She briefly lived in the Antilles and Guadeloupe, but by 2014 had returned to Quebec.

==Victims==
===Tammy Homolka===

According to Homolka, her husband Paul Bernardo became attracted to her younger sister, Tammy Homolka, during the summer of 1990 (this attraction was confirmed by Bernardo, during an interview conducted in 2007 while in custody, to have begun in July 1990). Karla hatched a plan to help Bernardo drug Tammy, seeing an opportunity to &quot;minimise risks, take control, and keep it all in the family.&quot; In July, &quot;according to Bernardo&#x27;s testimony, he and Karla served Tammy a spaghetti dinner spiked with Valium stolen from Karla&#x27;s workplace. Bernardo raped Tammy for about a minute before she started to wake up.&quot;

Homolka later stole the anesthetic agent halothane from the St. Catharines veterinarian clinic where she worked. On December 23, 1990, after a Christmas party at the Homolka household, Bernardo and Homolka drugged Tammy with the animal tranquilizer. The couple subsequently raped Tammy while she was unconscious. Tammy later choked on her own vomit and died. Before calling 9-1-1, Bernardo and Homolka hid the evidence, did the laundry, redressed Tammy (who had a chemical burn on her face), and moved her into her basement bedroom. A few hours later, Tammy was pronounced dead at St. Catharines General Hospital without having regained consciousness. Bernardo told police he had unsuccessfully tried to revive her, and her death was ruled an accident.

===Jane Doe===
On June 7, 1991, Homolka invited a 15-year-old girl she had befriended at a pet shop two years earlier, known as &quot;Jane Doe&quot; in the trials, to their home. &quot;Doe&quot; was then drugged by Homolka. Both Homolka and Bernardo sexually assaulted her and videotaped their assault. In August, &quot;Jane Doe&quot; was invited back to the couple&#x27;s residence and was again drugged. Homolka dialed emergency services after the girl vomited and stopped breathing while being raped. The ambulance was recalled after Homolka and Bernardo resuscitated her.

===Leslie Mahaffy===

Early in the morning on June 15, 1991, Bernardo detoured through Burlington (halfway between Toronto and St. Catharines) to steal licence plates and found Leslie Mahaffy standing outside her home. The 14-year-old had missed her curfew after attending a friend&#x27;s wake and was locked out of her house. Bernardo left his car and approached Mahaffy, saying that he wanted to break into a neighbour&#x27;s house. Unfazed, she asked if he had any cigarettes. He claimed he had some in his vehicle. When Bernardo led her to his car he blindfolded her, forced her into the car, drove her to Port Dalhousie and informed Homolka that they had a victim.

Bernardo and Homolka videotaped themselves torturing and sexually abusing Mahaffy while they listened to Bob Marley and David Bowie. At one point Bernardo said, &quot;You&#x27;re doing a good job, Leslie, a damned good job&quot;, adding: &quot;The next two hours are going to determine what I do to you. Right now, you&#x27;re scoring perfect.&quot; On another segment of tape played at Bernardo&#x27;s trial, the assault escalated. Mahaffy cried out in pain, and begged Bernardo to stop. In the Crown description of the scene, he was sodomizing her while her hands were bound with twine.

Mahaffy later told Bernardo that her blindfold seemed to be slipping, which signaled the possibility that she could identify her attackers if she was set free or lived. The following day, Bernardo claimed, Homolka gave her a lethal dose of triazolam; Homolka claimed that Bernardo strangled her. They put Mahaffy&#x27;s body in their basement, and the day after the Homolka family had a Father&#x27;s Day dinner at Bernardo&#x27;s and Homolka&#x27;s house. After the Homolkas and their remaining daughter Lori left, Bernardo and Homolka decided that the best way to dispose of the evidence would be to dismember Mahaffy and encase each part of her remains in concrete. Bernardo bought a dozen bags of cement at a hardware store the following day; he kept the receipts, which were damaging at his trial. Bernardo used his grandfather&#x27;s circular saw to dismember Mahaffy. Bernardo and Homolka made a number of trips to dump the cement blocks in Lake Gibson, south of Port Dalhousie. At least one of the blocks weighed and was beyond their ability to sink. It lay near the shore, where it was found by Michael Doucette and his son Michael Jr while on a fishing expedition on June 29, 1991. Mahaffy&#x27;s orthodontic appliance was instrumental in identifying her.

Homolka was released from prison on July 4, 2005. Several days before, Bernardo was interviewed by police and his lawyer Tony Bryant. According to Bryant, Bernardo said that he had always intended to free the girls he and Homolka kidnapped. However, when Mahaffy&#x27;s blindfold fell off (allowing her to see Bernardo&#x27;s face), Homolka was concerned that Mahaffy would identify Bernardo and report them to the police. Bernardo claimed that Homolka planned to murder Mahaffy by injecting an air bubble into her bloodstream, triggering an air embolism.

===Kristen French===

During the after-school hours of April 16, 1992, Bernardo and Homolka drove through St. Catharines to look for potential victims. Although students were still going home, the streets were generally empty. As they passed Holy Cross Secondary School, a Catholic high school in the city&#x27;s north end, they spotted 15-year-old Kristen French walking briskly to her home nearby. They pulled into the parking lot of nearby Grace Lutheran Church and Homolka got out of the car, map in hand, pretending to need assistance. When French looked at the map, Bernardo attacked from behind and brandished a knife, forcing her into the front seat of their car. From the back seat, Homolka subdued French by pulling her hair.

French took the same route home every day, taking about 15 minutes to get home and care for her dog. Soon after she should have arrived, her parents became convinced that she had met with foul play and notified police. Within 24 hours the Niagara Regional Police Service (NRP) assembled a team, searched French&#x27;s route and found several witnesses who had seen the abduction from different locations (giving police some important details). French&#x27;s shoe, recovered from the parking lot from where she had been taken, underscored the seriousness of the abduction.

Over the Easter weekend Bernardo and Homolka videotaped themselves torturing, raping and sodomizing French, forcing her to drink large amounts of alcohol and submit to Bernardo. At his trial, Crown prosecutor Ray Houlahan said that Bernardo always intended to kill her because she was never blindfolded and could identify her captors. The following day, Bernardo and Homolka murdered French before going to the Homolkas&#x27; for Easter dinner. Homolka testified at her trial that Bernardo strangled French for seven minutes while she watched. Bernardo said that Homolka beat French with a rubber mallet because she tried to escape, and French was strangled with a noose around her neck which was secured to a hope chest; Homolka then went to casually fix her own hair.

French&#x27;s nude body was discovered on April 30, 1992, in a ditch in Burlington, about 45 minutes from St. Catharines and a short distance from the cemetery where Mahaffy is buried. She had been washed, and her hair was cut off. Although it was thought that French&#x27;s hair was removed as a trophy, Homolka testified that it was cut to impede identification.

==Aftermath==

===Publication ban===
Citing the need to protect Bernardo&#x27;s right to a fair trial, a publication ban was imposed on Homolka&#x27;s preliminary inquiry.

The Crown had applied for the ban imposed on July 5, 1993, by Francis Kovacs, a Justice of the Ontario Court (General Division). Homolka, through her lawyers, supported the ban, whereas Bernardo&#x27;s lawyers argued that he would be prejudiced by the ban since Homolka previously had been portrayed as his victim. Four media outlets and one author also opposed the application. Some lawyers argued that rumours could be doing more damage to the future trial process than the publication of the actual evidence.

Public access to the Internet effectively nullified the court&#x27;s order, however; as did proximity to the Canada–US border, since a publication ban by an Ontario Court cannot apply in New York, Michigan, or anywhere else outside of Ontario. American journalists cited the First Amendment in editorials and published details of Homolka&#x27;s testimony, which were widely distributed by many Internet sources, primarily on the alt.fan.karla-homolka Usenet newsgroup. Information and rumours spread across myriad electronic networks available to anyone in Canada with a computer and a modem. Moreover, many of the Internet rumours went beyond the known details of the case.

Newspapers in Buffalo, Detroit, Washington, New York City and even Britain, together with border radio and television stations, reported details gleaned from sources at Homolka&#x27;s trial. The syndicated series &quot;A Current Affair&quot; aired two programs on the crimes. Canadians bootlegged copies of &quot;The Buffalo Evening News&quot; across the border, prompting orders to the Niagara Regional Police Service to arrest all those with more than one copy at the border. Extra copies were confiscated. Copies of other newspapers, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, were either turned back at the border or were not accepted by distributors in Ontario. Gordon Domm, a retired police officer who defied the publication ban by distributing details from the foreign media, was charged and convicted of disobeying a lawful court order.

===Plea bargain controversy===
Jamie Cameron, professor of law at Osgoode Hall, noted that &quot;at the time of the Homolka trial, three features of the case worried and concerned the public. Little was known about the respective roles Homolka and Bernardo played in their actions and the killing of their victims. By spring, 1993, it was clear that the Crown&#x27;s case against Bernardo depended on Homolka&#x27;s evidence. In simple terms, to secure a conviction against him, her story had to be believed. Yet on no view of the facts then known could she be exculpated; by casting her as a victim of his predatory behaviour, her responsibility for the crimes that were committed could be diminished and her credibility as a witness preserved.&quot;

==Trial==

=== Plea bargain ===
After lengthy negotiations between prosecutors and Homolka&#x27;s lawyer, a plea bargain was struck on May 14, 1993, according to which Homolka would testify against Bernardo and would plead guilty to two counts of manslaughter, in exchange for a sentence of 12 years in prison.

===Arraignment===
On May 18, 1993, Homolka was arraigned on two counts of manslaughter. Bernardo was charged with two counts each of kidnapping, unlawful confinement, aggravated sexual assault and first-degree murder as well as one of dismemberment. Coincidentally, that day Bernardo&#x27;s original lawyer, Ken Murray, first watched the rape videotapes. Murray decided to hold onto the tapes and use them to impeach Homolka on the stand during Bernardo&#x27;s trial. Neither Murray nor Carolyn MacDonald, the other lawyer on the defence team, were deeply experienced in criminal law and it was only over time that their ethical dilemma showed itself also to be a potentially criminal matter, for they were withholding evidence. By October 1993, he and his law partners had studied over 4,000 documents from the Crown. Murray has said he was willing to hand over the tapes to the Crown if they had let him cross-examine Homolka in the anticipated preliminary hearing. The hearing was never held.

===Hearing and sentencing===
Homolka was tried on June 28, 1993, though the publication ban the court had imposed limited the details released to the public, who were barred from the proceedings. She was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment on July 6, 1993.

===Evidence===
Murray said the videotapes showed Homolka sexually assaulting four female victims, having sex with a female sex worker in Atlantic City, and at another point, drugging an unconscious victim. In February 1994, Homolka divorced Bernardo.

During the summer of 1994, Murray had become concerned about serious ethical problems that had arisen in connection with the tapes and his continued representation of Bernardo. He consulted his own lawyer, Austin Cooper, who asked the Law Society of Upper Canada&#x27;s professional-conduct committee for advice.

&quot;The law society directed Murray in writing to seal the tapes in a package and turn them over to the judge presiding at Bernardo&#x27;s trial. The law society further directed him to remove himself as Bernardo&#x27;s counsel and to tell Bernardo what he had been instructed to do&quot;, Murray said in a statement released through Cooper in September 1995.

On September 12, 1994, Cooper attended Bernardo&#x27;s trial and advised Justice Patrick LeSage of the Ontario Court&#x27;s General Division, lawyer John Rosen, who replaced Murray as Bernardo&#x27;s defence counsel, and the prosecutors about what the law society had directed Murray to do. Rosen argued that the tapes should have been turned over to the defence first. Murray handed the tapes, along with a detailed summary, to Rosen, who &quot;kept the tapes for about two weeks and then decided to turn them over to the prosecution.&quot;

The revelation that a key piece of evidence had been kept from police for so long created a furor, especially when the public realized that Homolka had been Bernardo&#x27;s willing accomplice. The tapes were not allowed to be shown to the spectators; only the audio portion was available to them. Moreover, Bernardo has always claimed that, while he raped and tortured Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French, Homolka actually killed them.

After the videotapes had been found, rumours spread that Homolka was an active participant of the crimes. The public grew incensed as the full extent of Homolka&#x27;s role in the case was finally exposed and the plea agreement now seemed unnecessary. However, as was provided in the plea bargain, Homolka had already disclosed sufficient information to the police and the Crown found no grounds to break the agreement and reopen the case.

==Appeal and inquest==
Homolka&#x27;s plea bargain had been offered before the contents of the videotapes were available for review. Anne McGillivray, associate professor of law at the University of Manitoba, explained the continuing public antagonism against Homolka: There was widespread belief that she had known where the videotapes were hidden, that she wilfully concealed the Jane Doe incidents and, most centrally, that her claims of being under Bernardo&#x27;s control – a central tenet of the plea bargain – were dubious. Speculation was fed by a publicity ban on the plea bargain which stood until Bernardo&#x27;s trial.

&quot;Print and website sources imagined demonic duos, vampirism, Barbie and Ken perfect-couple perfect murderers [sic], sexy &#x27;Killer Karla&#x27;, the comic &#x27;Karla&#x27;s Web&#x27; featuring Homolka&#x27;s psy confessions. &quot;The gaze centres, always, on Homolka&quot; (italics added)... That [Bernardo] would be incarcerated for his mortal lifespan seemed a foregone conclusion. Homolka, in the popular view, should have taken her seat beside him in the prisoner&#x27;s box and seat of ultimate evil... Homolka promised full disclosure and testimony against Bernardo in return for reduced charges... and a joint sentencing recommendation. In so doing, she escaped central blame for the deaths.&quot;

Although the contents of the videotapes would likely have led to a conviction of murder for Homolka, an inquiry into the conduct of the prosecutors who had made the plea bargain found their behaviour &quot;professional and responsible&quot; and the &quot;resolution agreement&quot; that they had established with Homolka &quot;unassailable&quot; under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. Judge Patrick T. Galligan, reporting to the Attorney General on the matter, indicated that in his opinion &quot;the Crown had no alternative but to ...[negotiate with the accomplice] in this case&quot; as &quot;the &#x27;lesser of two evils&#x27; to deal with an accomplice rather than to be left in a situation where a violent and dangerous offender cannot be prosecuted.&quot;

In December 2001, Canadian authorities determined that there was no possible future use of the videotapes. The six videotapes depicting the torture and rape of Bernardo&#x27;s and Homolka&#x27;s victims were destroyed. The disposition of the tapes of Homolka watching and commenting on the tapes remains sealed.

== Prison ==
After her 1995 testimony against Bernardo, when Homolka returned to Kingston&#x27;s Prison For Women, her mother, Dorothy Homolka, started to suffer annual breakdowns between Thanksgiving and Christmas. The collapses were severe enough that she was hospitalized, sometimes for months at a time. While at Kingston, Homolka began correspondence courses in sociology through nearby Queen&#x27;s University which initially caused a media storm. Homolka was required to pay all fees, as well as her personal needs, from her fortnightly income of about C$69, although, she told author Stephen Williams in a subsequent letter, &quot;I did get some financial assistance&quot;. Homolka later graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology from Queen&#x27;s.

Homolka was moved from Kingston in the summer of 1997 to Joliette Institution, a medium security prison in Joliette, Quebec, 80 km northeast of Montreal.

In 1999, &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reporter Michelle Shephard came into possession of copies of her application to transfer to the &quot;Maison Thérèse-Casgrain&quot;, run by the Elizabeth Fry Society, and published the story noting the halfway house&#x27;s proximity to local schools, hours before the Canadian courts issued a publication ban on the information. Homolka sued the government after her transfer to a Montreal halfway house was denied.

In 2001, Homolka was transferred to the Ste-Anne-des-Plaines Institution, a maximum security prison in Quebec.

In a 2008 letter of apology to her family, she continued to blame Bernardo for her misdeeds: &quot;He wanted me to get sleeping pills from work... threatened me and physically and emotionally abused me when I refused... I tried so hard to save her.&quot;

During Homolka&#x27;s release hearing (under section 810.2 of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;), Louis Morrisette, psychiatrist, said the then-35-year-old did not represent a threat to society. Various hearings over the years have left a mixture of opinions. If she posed any kind of danger, said Dr. Hubert Van Gijseghem, a forensic psychologist for Correctional Services Canada, it lay in the ominous but not unlikely possibility of her linking up with another sexual sadist like Bernardo. &quot;She is very attracted to this world of sexual psychopaths. It&#x27;s not for nothing that she did what she did with Bernardo,&quot; he told the &quot;National Post&quot; after reviewing her file. A scheduled newspaper interview with Homolka was quashed by her lawyer.

Where other inmates might apply for parole at the first opportunity, Homolka refrained from doing so. &quot;Because she was deemed a risk to reoffend, she was denied statutory release two-thirds of the way through her sentence,&quot; &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; reported in explaining what had exempted Homolka from the parole restrictions meant to ease an offender&#x27;s integration into mainstream society. In 2004, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation noted that &quot;The National Parole Board has ruled that Karla Homolka must stay in prison for her full sentence, warning that she remains a risk to commit another violent crime.&quot; While the NPB noted that she had made some progress toward rehabilitation, it expressed concern regarding her relationship with convicted murderer Jean-Paul Gerbet. The NPB reprimanded Homolka: &quot;you have secretly undertaken an emotional relationship with another inmate, and evidence gathered seems to indicate that this relationship rapidly became sexual,&quot; the panel stated. As a result, it decided to keep her in prison.

== Release ==
A rumour that Homolka intended to settle in Alberta caused an uproar in that province. &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; weighed in with a series of possible scenarios: &quot;The most educated speculation has Homolka staying in Quebec, where language and cultural differences supposedly muted the media coverage of her case, and where she&#x27;ll be less recognizable. Another rumour suggests she might flee overseas, restarting in a country where her case is unknown. Or sneak into the United States, using an illegal identity to cross the border and living out her life under a pseudonym.&quot;

Michael Bryant, Ontario&#x27;s Attorney General fought to get Homolka on the agenda at a meeting of Canada&#x27;s justice ministers. &quot;He wants the federal government to expand the category of dangerous offenders to catch those slipping between the cracks.&quot; &quot;Bilingual and armed with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology from Queen&#x27;s University, Homolka may choose to try to live a quiet life in Quebec, where her crimes are not as well known as they are in English-speaking Canada,&quot; reported CTV in May 2005.

On June 2, 2005, the network said, &quot;the Ontario Crown will ask a Quebec judge to impose conditions under Section 810 of Criminal Code on Homolka&#x27;s release.&quot; &quot;The French and Mahaffy families want even tighter restrictions on Homolka, including asking that she submit to electronic monitoring or yearly psychological and psychiatric assessment,&quot; CTV said. These conditions are not allowed under Section 810 because they cross the line between preventive justice versus punitive measures, but &quot;that&#x27;s why [Toronto lawyer Tim Danson, acting on their behalf] believes the families want the government to amend the Section.&quot;

A two-day hearing was held before Judge Jean R. Beaulieu in June 2005. He ruled that Homolka, upon her release on July 4, 2005, would still pose a risk to the public-at-large. As a result, using section 810.2 of the Criminal Code, certain restrictions were placed on Homolka as a condition of her release:
# She was to tell police her home address, work address and with whom she lives
# She was required to notify police as soon as any of the above changed
# She was likewise required to notify police of any change to her name
# If she planned to be away from her home for more than 48 hours, she had to give 72 hours&#x27; notice
# She could not contact Paul Bernardo, the families of Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French or that of the woman known as Jane Doe (see above), or any violent criminals.
# She was forbidden to be with people under the age of 16
# She was forbidden from consuming drugs other than prescription medicine
# She was required to continue therapy and counselling
# She was required to provide police with a DNA sample

There was a penalty of a maximum two-year prison term for violating such an order. While this reassured the public that Homolka would find it difficult to offend again, it was felt by the court that it might be detrimental to her as well, because public hostility and her high profile might endanger her upon release.

On June 10, 2005, Senator Michel Biron declared that the conditions placed on Homolka were &quot;totalitarian&quot;, according to an interview with CTV Newsnet. Two weeks later, Biron apologized.

On July 4, 2005, Homolka was released from Ste-Anne-des-Plaines prison. She granted her first interview to Radio-Canada television, speaking entirely in French. Homolka told interviewer Joyce Napier that she chose Radio Canada because she had found it to be less sensationalist than the English-language media. She said that she had likewise found Quebec to be more accepting of her than Ontario. She affirmed that she would be living within the province but refused to say where. She said she had paid her debt to society legally, but not emotionally or socially. She refused to speak about her alleged relationship with Jean-Paul Gerbet, a convicted murderer serving a life sentence at Ste-Anne-des-Plaines. During the interview, her solicitor, Sylvie Bordelais, sat beside Homolka; however, she did not speak. Homolka&#x27;s mother was also present but off-screen, and was acknowledged by Homolka.

==Psychiatric evaluation==
Before her imprisonment, Homolka had been evaluated by numerous psychiatrists, psychologists, and other mental health and court officials. Homolka, reported one, &quot;remains something of a diagnostic mystery. Despite her ability to present herself very well, there is a moral vacuity in her which is difficult, if not impossible, to explain.&quot;

Graham Glancy, a forensic psychiatrist hired by Bernardo&#x27;s chief defence lawyer, John Rosen, had offered an alternative theory to explain Homolka&#x27;s behaviour, noted Williams in &quot;Invisible Darkness&quot;, his first book on the case. &quot;She appears to be a classic example of hybristophilia, an individual who is sexually aroused by a partner&#x27;s violent sexual behaviour, Glancy suggested.&quot;

Williams later reversed his opinion about her and began corresponding with her. This formed the basis for his second book, &quot;Karla: A Pact with the Devil&quot;. In her letters Homolka also disparaged a number of the professionals who had examined her and said she did not care &quot;what conditions I would receive upon release. I would spend three hours a day standing on my head should that be required.&quot;

==Freedom and relocation to Guadeloupe; subsequent return to Canada==
The national media reported in July 2005 that Homolka had relocated to the Island of Montreal. On August 21, 2005, &quot;Le Courrier du Sud&quot; reported that she had been sighted in the South Shore community of Longueuil, across the St. Lawrence River from Montreal.

On November 30, 2005, Quebec Superior Court Judge James Brunton lifted all restrictions imposed on Homolka, saying there was not enough evidence to justify them. On December 6, 2005, the Quebec Court of Appeal upheld Brunton&#x27;s decision. The Quebec Justice Department decided not to take the case to the Supreme Court, despite Ontario&#x27;s urging.

TVA reported on June 8, 2006, that Homolka&#x27;s request to have her name changed was rejected. She had attempted to change her name legally to Emily Chiara Tremblay (Tremblay being one of the most common surnames in Quebec).

Sun Media reported in 2007 that Homolka had given birth to a baby boy. Quebec Children&#x27;s Aid said that despite Homolka&#x27;s past, the new mother would not automatically be scrutinized. Several nurses had refused to care for Homolka before she gave birth. On December 14, 2007, &quot;CityNews&quot; reported that Homolka had left Canada for the Antilles so that her then one-year-old could lead a &quot;more normal life.&quot;

On October 17, 2014, the jury in the first degree murder trial of Luka Magnotta heard that Homolka was living in Quebec; Magnotta had previously secretly disseminated false rumours of him dating Homolka which he would subsequently deny in interviews.

A poll of 9,521 voters concluded that 63.27% believed that the public had the right to know Homolka&#x27;s location, 18.57% of voters believed that she deserved anonymity, and 18.16% believed that Homolka should be permitted to receive anonymity in about 50 years.

News reports as of April 20, 2016, placed Homolka as living with her children in Châteauguay, Quebec. Homolka was reportedly angry with reporters&#x27; attempts to speak with her. Parents of children attending the same school as Homolka&#x27;s children expressed great concern, despite reassurances from the school and the school board. As of January 2020, she lives in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield without her husband or children.

==Possibility of pardon==
On April 19, 2010, &quot;The Vancouver Sun&quot; reported that Homolka would be eligible to seek pardon for her crimes in the summer of 2010. Offenders convicted of first- or second-degree murder or with indeterminate sentences cannot apply for a pardon due to the fact that their sentences are for life, but Homolka was convicted of manslaughter, and received less than the maximum life sentence, making her eligible. If she had been successful, her criminal record would not have been erased; however, it would have been covered up in background checks, except those required for working with children or other vulnerable people. Partially in response to Homolka&#x27;s case, a bill to limit access to pardons for serious crimes was fast-tracked through the House of Commons and Senate in June 2010, taking only 12 days from first reading in the House of Commons to Royal assent.

Magnotta claimed that unnamed parties were trying to implicate him as being in a relationship with Homolka. The documentary dubbed Homolka &quot;the most hated woman in Canada.&quot;

<text>In theoretical physics, geometrodynamics is an attempt to describe spacetime and associated phenomena completely in terms of geometry. Technically, its goal is to unify the fundamental forces and reformulate general relativity as a configuration space of three-metrics, modulo three-dimensional diffeomorphisms. The origin of this idea can be found in an English mathematician William Kingdon Clifford&#x27;s works. This theory was enthusiastically promoted by John Wheeler in the 1960s, and work on it continues in the 21st century.

==Einstein&#x27;s geometrodynamics==

The term geometrodynamics is as a synonym for general relativity. More properly, some authors use the phrase &quot;Einstein&#x27;s geometrodynamics&quot; to denote the initial value formulation of general relativity, introduced by Arnowitt, Deser, and Misner (ADM formalism) around 1960. In this reformulation, spacetimes are sliced up into &quot;spatial hyperslices&quot; in a rather arbitrary fashion, and the vacuum Einstein field equation is reformulated as an &quot;evolution equation&quot; describing how, given the geometry of an initial hyperslice (the &quot;initial value&quot;), the geometry evolves over &quot;time&quot;. This requires giving &quot;constraint equations&quot; which must be satisfied by the original hyperslice. It also involves some &quot;choice of gauge&quot;; specifically, choices about how the &quot;coordinate system&quot; used to describe the hyperslice geometry evolves.

==Wheeler&#x27;s geometrodynamics==

Wheeler wanted to reduce physics to geometry in an even more fundamental way than the ADM reformulation of general relativity with a dynamic geometry whose curvature changes with time. It attempts to realize three concepts:
*mass without mass
*charge without charge
*field without field

He wanted to lay the foundation for quantum gravity and unify gravitation with electromagnetism (the strong and weak interactions were not yet sufficiently well understood in 1960 to be included).

Wheeler introduced the notion of geons, gravitational wave packets confined to a compact region of spacetime and held together by the gravitational attraction of the (gravitational) field energy of the wave itself. Wheeler was intrigued by the possibility that geons could affect test particles much like a massive object, hence &quot;mass without mass&quot;.

Wheeler was also much intrigued by the fact that the (nonspinning) point-mass solution of general relativity, the Schwarzschild vacuum, has the nature of a wormhole. Similarly, in the case of a charged particle, the geometry of the Reissner–Nordström electrovacuum solution suggests that the symmetry between electric (which &quot;end&quot; in charges) and magnetic field lines (which never end) could be restored if the electric field lines do not actually end but only go through a wormhole to some distant location or even another branch of the universe. George Rainich had shown decades earlier that one can obtain the electromagnetic field tensor from the electromagnetic contribution to the stress–energy tensor, which in general relativity is directly coupled to spacetime curvature; Wheeler and Misner developed this into the so-called &quot;already-unified field theory&quot; which partially unifies gravitation and electromagnetism, yielding &quot;charge without charge&quot;.

In the ADM reformulation of general relativity, Wheeler argued that the full Einstein field equation can be recovered once the &quot;momentum constraint&quot; can be derived, and suggested that this might follow from geometrical considerations alone, making general relativity something like a logical necessity. Specifically, curvature (the gravitational field) might arise as a kind of &quot;averaging&quot; over very complicated topological phenomena at very small scales, the so-called spacetime foam. This would realize geometrical intuition suggested by quantum gravity, or &quot;field without field&quot;.

These ideas captured the imagination of many physicists, even though Wheeler himself quickly dashed some of the early hopes for his program. In particular, spin 1/2 fermions proved difficult to handle. For this, one has to go to the Einsteinian Unified Field Theory of the Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac system, or more generally, the Einstein–Yang–Mills-Dirac-Higgs System.

Geometrodynamics also attracted attention from philosophers intrigued by the possibility of realizing some of Descartes&#x27; and Spinoza&#x27;s ideas about the nature of space.

==Modern notions of geometrodynamics==

More recently, Christopher Isham, Jeremy Butterfield, and their students have continued to develop &quot;quantum geometrodynamics&quot; to take account of recent work toward a quantum theory of gravity and further developments in the very extensive mathematical theory of initial value formulations of general relativity. Some of Wheeler&#x27;s original goals remain important for this work, particularly the hope of laying a solid foundation for quantum gravity. The philosophical program also continues to motivate several prominent contributors.

Topological ideas in the realm of gravity date back to Riemann, Clifford, and Weyl and found a more concrete realization in the wormholes of Wheeler characterized by the Euler-Poincaré invariant. They result from attaching handles to black holes.

Observationally, Albert Einstein&#x27;s general relativity (GR) is rather well established for the solar system and double pulsars. However, in GR the metric plays a double role: Measuring distances in spacetime and serving as a gravitational potential for the Christoffel connection. This dichotomy seems to be one of the main obstacles for quantizing gravity. Arthur Stanley Eddington suggested already in 1924 in his book &quot;The Mathematical Theory of Relativity&quot; (2nd Edition) to regard the connection as the basic field and the metric merely as a derived concept.

Consequently, the primordial action in four dimensions should be constructed from a metric-free topological action such as the Pontryagin invariant of the corresponding gauge connection. Similarly as in the Yang–Mills theory, a quantization can be achieved by amending the definition of curvature and the Bianchi identities via topological ghosts. In such a graded Cartan formalism, the nilpotency of the ghost operators is on par with the Poincaré lemma for the exterior derivative. Using a BRST antifield formalism with a duality gauge fixing, a consistent quantization in spaces of double dual curvature is obtained. The constraint imposes instanton type solutions on the curvature-squared &#x27;Yang-Mielke theory&#x27; of gravity, proposed in its affine form already by Weyl 1919 and by Yang in 1974. However, these exact solutions exhibit a &#x27;vacuum degeneracy&#x27;. One needs to modify the double duality of the curvature via scale breaking terms, in order to retain Einstein&#x27;s equations with an induced cosmological constant of partially topological origin as the unique macroscopic &#x27;background&#x27;.

Such scale breaking terms arise more naturally in a constraint formalism, the so-called BF scheme, in which the gauge curvature is denoted by F. In the case of gravity, it departs from the special linear group SL(5, R) in four dimensions, thus generalizing (Anti-)de Sitter gauge theories of gravity. After applying spontaneous symmetry breaking to the corresponding topological BF theory, again Einstein spaces emerge with a tiny cosmological constant related to the scale of symmetry breaking. Here the &#x27;background&#x27; metric is induced via a Higgs-like mechanism. The finiteness of such a deformed topological scheme may convert into asymptotic safeness after quantization of the spontaneously broken model.

Richard J. Petti believes that cosmological models with torsion but no rotating particles based on Einstein–Cartan theory illustrate a situation of &quot;a (nonpropagating) field without a field&quot;.

<text>Zwentibold (&quot;Zventibold&quot;, &quot;Zwentibald&quot;, &quot;Swentiboldo&quot;, &quot;Sventibaldo&quot;, &quot;Sanderbald&quot;; – 13 August 900), a member of the Carolingian dynasty, was the illegitimate son of Emperor Arnulf. In 895, his father granted him the Kingdom of Lotharingia, which he ruled until his death.

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
Zwentibold was born during the long reign of his great-grandfather, King Louis the German in East Francia. He was the first-born, yet illegitimate, son of Arnulf of Carinthia and his concubine Vinburga. Zwentibold&#x27;s father was an illegitimate son of Carloman of Bavaria, the eldest son of Louis the German. Zwentibold was named after his godfather Svatopluk, ruler of Great Moravia (Zwentibold being a Frankish transcription of Svatopluk). After Louis&#x27; death in 876, Carloman ruled over the East Frankish territory of Bavaria and ceded the adjacent marches of Pannonia and Carinthia (former Carantania) to his son Arnulf. In 887 Arnulf succeeded the incapable King Charles the Fat as king of East Francia.

When Zwentibold came of age, he intervened in the scramble for the throne in West Francia between Count Odo of Paris and Charles the Simple, but they began to cooperate against Zwentibold, when it became apparent that he intended to become king of West Francia. The eldest son of Arnulf was at first marked out for his succession in East Francia. According to the 870 Treaty of Meerssen and the 880 Treaty of Ribemont, the Lotharingian kingdom of former Middle Francia had fallen to the East Frankish realm. When in 893 King Arnulf&#x27;s wife Ota gave birth to his legitimate son and successor Louis the Child, Zwentibold in compensation received the Lotharingian royal title, which last had been held by Lothair II.

=== King of Lotharingia ===

In the summer of 893 Arnulf received pleas of intervention against Wido of Spoleto from Pope Formosus and Berengar of Friuli, king of Italy. Arnulf sent Zwentibold down the Brenner Pass with an army who joined forces with Berengar in Verona. The two marched to Wido&#x27;s capital, Pavia, and besieged it unsuccessfully, finally abandoning the siege. According to Liutprand of Cremona, Zwentibold accepted money from Wido in order to leave, although it is not clear if it was in the form of a personal bribe or a tribute to his father. Zwentibold&#x27;s retreat was nonetheless seen as a failure, but after learning details of the campaign, Arnulf summoned a stronger army and personally led it to Italy and took Pavia a few months later.

As a part of the plans to integrate Lotharingia into the East Frankish realm, the rule of King Zwentibold was enforced by his father, supported by the archbishops Herman I of Cologne and Ratbod of Trier, against the resistance of the local nobility. As he helped the common population too much, he began to be hated in a few years. He was fighting unruly nobles when his father Arnulf died in 899 and the legitimate son Louis the Child became king of East Francia at the age of six.

=== Death and legacy ===
Zwentibold attempted to take advantage of the succession of his minor half-brother to establish complete independence for his Lotharingian kingdom. However, after he had lost his father&#x27;s backing, the entire nobility supported Louis and asked him to intervene. In 900, Count Reginar I of Hainault and Odoacer rose against Zwentibold and slew him in battle that year, on the river Meuse, near present-day Susteren. His remains are buried at Susteren Abbey.

After Zwentibold&#x27;s death, King Louis the Child ruled over Lotharingia. However, under his reign the East Frankish realm disintegrated and from 903 Zwentibold&#x27;s kingdom was administered by the Lahngau Count Gebhard, a scion of the Conradine dynasty, who received the title of Duke of Lorraine.

==Family==
In 897, he married Oda, a daughter of Duke Otto I of Saxony. He had three daughters, who are mentioned in the &quot;Gesta episcoporum Leodensium&quot;:
* Benedetta (born c. 898), abbey of Susteren
* Cecilia (born c. 899), abbey of Susteren
* Relenda (born c. 900)

They also had one son, named Otto de Lorraine. He died in 949.

<doc id="750724" wikidata="Q1067943" url="?curid=750724" title="Royal Institute of British Architects">
<text>The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) is a professional body for architects primarily in the United Kingdom, but also internationally, founded for the advancement of architecture under its royal charter granted in 1837, three supplemental charters and a new charter granted in 1971.

Founded as the Institute of British Architects in London in 1834, the RIBA retains a central London headquarters at 66 Portland Place as well as a network of regional offices. Its members played a leading part in promotion of architectural education in the United Kingdom; the RIBA Library, also established in 1834, is one of the three largest architectural libraries in the world and the largest in Europe. The RIBA also played a prominent role in the development of UK architects&#x27; registration bodies.

The institute administers some of the oldest architectural awards in the world, including RIBA President&#x27;s Medals Students Award, the Royal Gold Medal, and the Stirling Prize. It also manages RIBA Competitions, organising architectural and other design-related competitions.

The RIBA was historically a male-dominated body, first admitting women members in 1898, and appointing its first female president in 2009. Sometimes perceived as a London-centric organisation, it has also been accused of lacking transparency.

==History ==
Originally named the Institute of British Architects in London, it was formed in 1834 by several prominent architects, including Decimus Burton, Philip Hardwick, Thomas Allom, William Donthorne, Thomas Leverton Donaldson, William Adams Nicholson, John Buonarotti Papworth, and Thomas de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey. The latter served as the institute&#x27;s first president for 25 years until his death in 1859.

After the grant of the royal charter it had become known as the Royal Institute of British Architects in London, eventually dropping the reference to London in 1892. In 1934, it moved to its current headquarters on Portland Place, with the building being opened by King George V and Queen Mary. 

===Royal charter===
It was granted its Royal charter in 1837 under King William IV. Supplemental charters of 1887, 1909 and 1925 were replaced by a single charter in 1971, and there have been minor amendments since then.

The original charter of 1837 set out the purpose of the Royal Institute to be: &#x27;... the general advancement of Civil Architecture, and for promoting and facilitating the acquirement of the knowledge of the various arts and sciences connected therewith...&#x27;

The RIBA&#x27;s operational framework is provided by its byelaws, which are more frequently updated than the charter. Any revisions to the charter or byelaws require the approval of the Privy Council.

===Motto ===
The design of the institute&#x27;s Mycenaean lions medal and the Latin motto &quot;Usui civium, decori urbium&quot; has been attributed to Thomas Leverton Donaldson, who had been honorary secretary until 1839. The RIBA &quot;Guide to its Archive and History&quot; (Angela Mace,1986) records that the first official version of the badge of the Lion Gate at Mycenae was used as a bookplate for the institute&#x27;s library and publications from 1835 to 1891, when it was redesigned by J. H. Metcalfe. It was again redesigned in 1931 by Eric Gill and in 1960 by Joan Hassall. The description in the 1837 by-laws was: &quot;gules, two lions rampant guardant or, supporting a column marked with lines chevron, proper, all standing on a base of the same; a garter surrounding the whole with the inscription &quot;Institute of British Architects, anno salutis MDCCCXXXIV&quot;; above a mural crown proper, and beneath the motto &quot;Usui civium decori urbium&quot; &quot;. The motto is translated &quot;for the use of the people, for the glory of the city&quot;. 

===Architectural education===
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the RIBA and its members had a leading part in the promotion of architectural education in the United Kingdom, including the establishment of the Architects&#x27; Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK) and the Board of Architectural Education under the Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938. A member of the RIBA, Lionel Bailey Budden, then Associate Professor in the Liverpool University School of Architecture, had contributed the article on Architectural Education published in the fourteenth edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (1929). His School, Liverpool, was one of the twenty schools named for the purpose of constituting the statutory Board of Architectural Education when the 1931 Act was passed.

Soon after the passing of the 1931 Act, in the book published on the occasion of the institute&#x27;s centenary celebration in 1934, Harry Barnes, FRIBA, Chairman of the Registration Committee, mentioned that ARCUK could not be a rival of any architectural association, least of all the RIBA, given the way ARCUK was constituted. Barnes commented that the Act&#x27;s purpose was not protecting the architectural profession, and that the legitimate interests of the profession were best served by the (then) architectural associations in which some 80 per cent of those practising architecture were to be found. 

The RIBA &quot;Guide to its Archive and History&quot; (1986) has a section on the &quot;Statutory registration of architects&quot; with a bibliography extending from a draft bill of 1887 to one of 1969. The Guide&#x27;s section on &quot;Education&quot; records the setting up in 1904 of the RIBA Board of Architectural Education, and the system by which any school which applied for recognition, whose syllabus was approved by the Board and whose examinations were conducted by an approved external examiner, and whose standard of attainment was guaranteed by periodical inspections by a &quot;Visiting Board&quot; from the BAE, could be placed on the list of &quot;recognized schools&quot; and its successful students could qualify for exemption from RIBA examinations.

The content of the acts, particularly section 1 (1) of the amending act of 1938, shows the importance which was then attached to giving architects the responsibility of superintending or supervising the building works of local authorities (for housing and other projects), rather than persons professionally qualified only as municipal or other engineers. By the 1970s another issue had emerged affecting education for qualification and registration for practice as an architect, due to the obligation imposed on the United Kingdom and other European governments to comply with European Union Directives concerning mutual recognition of professional qualifications in favour of equal standards across borders, in furtherance of the policy for a single market of the European Union. This led to proposals for reconstituting ARCUK. Eventually, in the 1990s, before proceeding, the government issued a consultation paper &quot;Reform of Architects Registration&quot; (1994). The change of name to &quot;Architects Registration Board&quot; was one of the proposals which was later enacted in the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 and re-enacted as the Architects Act 1997; another was the abolition of the ARCUK Board of Architectural Education. 

RIBA Visiting Boards continue to assess courses for exemption from the RIBA&#x27;s examinations in architecture. Under arrangements made in 2011 the validation criteria are jointly held by the RIBA and the Architects Registration Board, but unlike the ARB, the RIBA also validates courses outside the UK.

In 2005 the RIBA set up Academy of Urbanism.

In 2019 the RIBA Council voted for the creation of the RIBA Future Architects initiative, an online platform and international network aimed at Part I, Part II and Part III architectural students and graduates. The initiative was championed by student and associates&#x27; representatives on Council, after a 2018 campaign highlighting the hardship architectural students faced in their degrees. The initiative is designed to support, inspire and provide a voice as students and graduates transition from study to practice.

===Design policy===
The RIBA sees itself as a lobbying organisation acting for architects, &quot;for better buildings, stronger communities, and higher environmental standards&quot;. For example, in 2005 in response to concerns that the UK government&#x27;s Private Finance Initiative did not offer good value for money, RIBA put forward a model known as &quot;Smart PFI&quot;, under which a traditionally appointed design team would prepare &quot;example plans&quot; which would be finalised and costed by PFI bidders.

==Structure==
The RIBA is governed by the RIBA Council, a group of 60 members, elected from among the RIBA membership, the majority of whom are chartered architects.

The RIBA is a member organisation, with 44,000 members. Chartered Members are entitled to call themselves chartered architects and to append the post-nominals RIBA after their name; Student Members are not permitted to do so. Formerly, fellowships of the institute were granted, although no longer; those who continue to hold this title instead add FRIBA. Members gain access to all the institute&#x27;s services and receive its monthly magazine the &quot;RIBA Journal&quot; and articles on its website, RIBAJ.com.

===Designation===
*ARIBA: Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (no longer granted to new members)
*FRIBA: Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (and Hon Fellow – an honorary designation)
*RIBA: Chartered member of the Royal Institute of British Architects
* The institute&#x27;s president is designated PRIBA, past presidents use PPRIBA

===Regions===
The institute also maintains twelve regional offices around the United Kingdom, including a London regional office. The first regional office was the East of England, opened at Cambridge in 1966. Each region encompasses several local architectural groups. In February 2022, the RIBA was criticised for cost-cutting proposals to merge its offices across England into three &#x27;super regions&#x27;.

* RIBA East – Great Shelford
* RIBA East Midlands – Nottingham
* RIBA London – London
* RIBA North East – Newcastle
* RIBA North West – Liverpool
* RIBA South / South East – Reading
* RIBA South West / Wessex – Bristol
* RIBA West Midlands – Birmingham
* RIBA Yorkshire – Leeds
* RIAS – Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland, Edinburgh
* RSAW – Royal Society of Architects in Wales, Cardiff
* RSUA – Royal Society of Ulster Architects, Belfast

There are also international branches under the RIBA International umbrella, with offices in London, Shanghai and Sharjah (United Arab Emirates). There are four principal membership groups:
* RIBA Americas – includes the RIBA USA Chapter
* RIBA Asia and Australasia
* RIBA Europe
* RIBA Middle East and Africa

===RIBA Enterprises===
RIBA Enterprises was the commercial arm of RIBA, with a registered office in Newcastle upon Tyne, a base at 76 Portland Place in London, and an office in Newark, later sold to allow further investment. It once employed over 250 staff, approximately 180 of whom were based in Newcastle. Its services include RIBA Insight, and &quot;RIBA Product Selector.&quot; It previously ran RIBA Publishing, RIBA Bookshops (which operates online and at 66 Portland Place), RIBA Appointments and &quot;RIBA Journal&quot;. These all now operate as part of the RIBA.

RIBA Enterprises also included the Newcastle-based NBS (National Building Specification), which had 130 staff and dealt with building regulations and the Construction Information Service. In June 2018, the RIBA announced it was selling a £31.8 million stake in RIBA Enterprises, to LDC, the private equity arm of Lloyds Bank. In November 2020, NBS was sold to Byggfakta Group, a Sweden-based information services provider. The RIBA received £172 million from the sale of its stake in NBS, some of which was reinvested to provide a reliable income stream for the institute.

The RIBA has been recognised as a business Superbrand since 2008.

==RIBA headquarters==

The RIBA&#x27;s headquarters has been at 66 Portland Place, London, since 1934. This Grade II* listed building was designed by architect George Grey Wornum for the institute and features sculptures by Edward Bainbridge Copnall and James Woodford. The building is open to the public, and includes a library, architectural bookshop, a café, bar, exhibition galleries and lecture theatre. Rooms are hired out for events.

The organisation also owns an adjacent building at 76 Portland Place, a 1950s office building overhauled in 2013, which housed RIBA staff and a members&#x27; café. In September 2021, following the COVID-19 pandemic and an £8 million budget deficit in the year ending December 2020, the RIBA announced plans to sell 76 Portland Place and to reduce staff numbers. Chief executive Alan Vallance said 89% of RIBA&#x27;s staff only wanted to work two or three days a week from an office, so 76 Portland Place was surplus to requirements. A potential 20 further redundancies were reported on 31 January 2022. The organisation&#x27;s annual report and accounts for the year ending 31 December 2022 reported a £6.3 million trading deficit (following shortfalls of £8 million in 2021 and £8.2 million in 2020), though the sale of its lease on 76 Portland Place for nearly £12 million had since helped balance its books.

In January 2022, the RIBA announced an architectural competition for RIBA-chartered architectural practices for a £20 million &quot;comprehensive refurbishment&quot; of its 66 Portland Place HQ. In 2024, this renovation was budgeted at £85 million. The building will close on 1 June 2025 for two and a half years to enable refurbishment.

===British Architectural Library===

The British Architectural Library, sometimes referred to as the RIBA Library, was established in 1834 upon the founding of the institute with donations from members. Now, with over four million items, it is one of the three largest architectural libraries in the world and the largest in Europe. Some items from the collections are on permanent display at the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A) in the V&amp;A + RIBA Architecture Gallery and included in temporary exhibitions at the RIBA and across Europe and North America. Its collections include:

*Archives: 1.5 million items made up of architects&#x27; personal papers, correspondence, notebooks and diaries.
*Audiovisual materials: Talks held at the RIBA, including talks by winners of the Royal Gold Medal.
*Biographical files: 20,000 biographical files relating to a specific architect or firm. Files contain a mix of nomination papers for membership of the RIBA, obituaries, brochures, articles and letters.
*Books: 150,000 books and 20,000 pamphlets, with the earliest book dating from 1478. Amongst the items is a first edition of Andrea Palladio&#x27;s &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot; from 1570 and John Tallis&#x27;s &quot;Tallis&#x27;s London street views&quot; from 1838 to 1840.
*Drawings: 1 million items are held. These predominantly cover British architects from the Renaissance to the present day, such as Ernő Goldfinger, Charles Holden and Edwin Lutyens. It holds the world&#x27;s largest collection of drawings by Andrea Palladio.
*Models: Examples come from architects such as Denys Lasdun for his Keeling House and National Theatre, London.
*Periodicals: 2,000 architectural titles collected, with complete sets of &quot;Architectural Review&quot;, &quot;Architects&#x27; Journal&quot;, and &quot;Country Life&quot;.
*Photographs: 1.5 million items, including the archive of the Architectural Press. Items date from the 19th century, but with major holdings of 20th-century photographers such as Eric de Maré, John Maltby, John Donat and Henk Snoek.

The overcrowded conditions of the library was one of the reasons why the RIBA moved from 9 Conduit Street (where it had been since 1859) to larger premises at 66 Portland Place in 1934. The library remained open throughout World War II and was able to shelter the archives of Modernist architect Adolf Loos during the war.

The library is based at two public sites: the Reading Room at the RIBA&#x27;s headquarters, 66 Portland Place, London; and the RIBA Architecture Study Rooms in the Henry Cole Wing of the V&amp;A. The Reading Room, designed by the building&#x27;s architect George Grey Wornum and his wife Miriam, retains its original 1934 Art Deco interior with open bookshelves, original furniture and double-height central space. The study rooms, opened in 2004, were designed by Wright &amp; Wright Architects. The library is funded entirely by the RIBA but it is open to the public without charge. It operates a free learning programme aimed at students, education groups and families, and an information service for RIBA members and the public through the RIBA Information Centre.

A partnership with the London Archives will see some of the collections and contents of the library transferred temporarily to the London Archives, Clerkenwell, when the library closes in April 2025 for the renovation of 66 Portland Place.

===V&amp;A + RIBA Architecture Partnership===

Since 2004, through the V&amp;A + RIBA Architecture Partnership, the RIBA and V&amp;A have worked together to promote the understanding and enjoyment of architecture.

In 2004, the two institutions created the Architecture Gallery (Room 128) at the V&amp;A showing artefacts from the collections of both institutions, this was the first permanent gallery devoted to architecture in the UK. The adjacent Architecture Exhibition Space (Room 128a) is used for temporary displays related to architecture. Both spaces were designed by Gareth Hoskins Architects. At the same time the RIBA Library Drawing and Archives Collections moved from 21 Portman Place to new facilities in the Henry Cole Wing at the V&amp;A. Under the Partnership new study rooms were opened where members of the public could view items from the RIBA and V&amp;A architectural collections under the supervision of curatorial staff. These and the nearby education room were designed by Wright &amp; Wright Architects.

In June 2022, the RIBA announced it would be terminating its partnership with the V&amp;A in 2027, &quot;by mutual agreement&quot;, ending the permanent architecture gallery at the museum. Artefacts will be transferred back to the RIBA&#x27;s existing collections, with some rehoused at the institute&#x27;s headquarters at 66 Portland Place, set to become a new House of Architecture following a £20 million refurbishment.

==RIBA Awards==

The RIBA has been awarding the President&#x27;s Medals annually since 1836, making them the institute&#x27;s oldest awards, and possibly the oldest awards worldwide in the field of architecture. The Institute runs many other awards including the Stirling Prize for the best new building of the year; the Royal Gold Medal (first awarded in 1848), which honours a distinguished body of work; the Stephen Lawrence Prize, sponsored by the Marco Goldschmied Foundation, originally for projects with a construction budget of less than £1,000,000, and the President&#x27;s Awards for Research. The RIBA European Award was inaugurated in 2005 for work in the European Union, outside the UK. The RIBA National Award and the RIBA International Award were established in 2007. Since 1966, the RIBA also judges regional awards which are presented locally in the UK regions (East, East Midlands, London, North East, North West, Northern Ireland, Scotland, South/South East, South West/Wessex, Wales, West Midlands and Yorkshire). Inaugurated in 2001, the Manser Medal was renamed the RIBA House of the Year award in 2014.

==RIBA competitions==

RIBA Competitions is the Royal Institute of British Architects&#x27; unit dedicated to organising architectural and other design-related competitions.

Architectural design competitions are used by an organisation that plans to build a new building or refurbish an existing building. They can be used for buildings, engineering work, structures, landscape design projects or public realm artworks. A competition typically asks for architects and/or designers to submit a design proposal in response to a given Brief. The winning design will then be selected by an independent jury panel of design professionals and client representatives. The independence of the jury is vital to the fair conduct of a competition.

==&quot;RIBA Plan of Work&quot;==
The &quot;RIBA Plan of Work&quot;, first developed in 1963, is a stage-by-stage model considered &quot;the definitive design and process management tool for the UK construction industry&quot;. The latest version is the &quot;RIBA Plan of Work 2020&quot;, which has eight stages, 0 to 7. This version replaced the 2013 version. Previously, the &quot;RIBA Outline Plan of Work 2007&quot; used letters for each stage (stages A-L) rather than numbers.

RIBA work plan stages are often referred to in architectural, planning and procurement contexts, for example procurement notices may specify the relevant stages of work for which professional support is required.

==Education==

In addition to the Architects Registration Board, the RIBA provides accreditation to architecture schools in the UK under a procedure which validates courses at over 50 educational establishments across the UK. It also provides validation to international courses without input from the ARB.

The RIBA has three parts to the education process: Part I which is generally a three-year first degree, a year-out of at least one year work experience in an architectural practice precedes the Part II which is generally a two-year post graduate diploma or masters. A further year out must be taken before the RIBA Part III professional exams can be taken. Overall it takes a minimum of seven years before an architecture student can seek chartered status.

==Criticism==
===Lack of representation===
In common with other professional bodies established in the early 19th century, the RIBA was initially a men-only institution. Thomas Leverton Donaldson, the RIBA&#x27;s first secretary aimed &quot;To uphold ourselves the character of Architects as men of taste, men of science, men of honour&quot;; this vision of the masculine architect largely excluded women from the architecture profession for decades. More than 60 years after its foundation, the RIBA first admitted women as members in 1898; the first female member was Ethel Charles (1871–1962), followed by her sister Bessie (1869–1932) in 1900. It was then more than 30 years before the RIBA elected its first woman fellow, Gillian Harrison (1898–1974), in 1931, and a further 77 years before RIBA elected its first female president, Ruth Reed. There is no record of any of the buildings designed by the early women members.

In 1985, when under 5% of chartered architects were women, the Women Architects Forum was established. In 1993 the RIBA established a special interest group, the Women Architects Group; in 1999, renamed Women In Architecture, it became independent of the RIBA, which, in 2000, set up its first equality forum, Architects For Change. This became an umbrella group for Women In Architecture, the Society of Black Architects, student forum Archaos and other groups. In 2017, around 17% of architects were women, up from 8% in 1999. In November 2024, the RIBA commissioned an investigation, to be undertaken by the Fawcett Society, into gender equity in architecture. Women make up 31% of architects, while the average gender pay gap is 16%.

The RIBA has been criticised by architects outside southeast England as a London-centric organisation which does not reach out to all members in the United Kingdom and beyond. The organisation has also been accused of institutional racism, of having a &quot;deep, systemic disengagement from the membership&quot;, of lacking transparency, and being &quot;increasingly irrelevant&quot; to architects.

In March 2022, young architects began a campaign to get the next RIBA president to move beyond &quot;empty slogans and self-serving initiatives&quot; and shake up an institute seen as &quot;out of touch&quot; with the wider profession. The campaign included members of a grassroots organisation, the Future Architects Front (FAF), and the institute’s Future Architects Steering Group; their preferred candidate, Muyiwa Oki, was named on 6 May 2022. Days later, the RIBA announced a restriction on new members participating in the elections (starting on 28 June 2022), a rule change described by the FAF as &quot;an outrageous lack of transparency&quot; and &quot;exclusionary tactics&quot;. Nonetheless, in August 2022, Oki was elected to be the next RIBA president from September 2023. In 2024, the Just Transition group, which had also supported Oki, put forward another &#x27;change&#x27; candidate, Funmbi Adeagbo, to succeed Oki as president in September 2025.

Also in May 2022, a RIBA director, Dian Small, highlighted the lack of diversity at an RIBA awards event, suggesting black architects &quot;were not invited&quot;. On 26 May 2022, the RIBA&#x27;s first director of diversity and inclusion, Marsha Ramroop, left after 13 months with the organisation. In December 2022, the RIBA decided not to &quot;proceed with the development and sale of an equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) guidance book for practices, originally planned for 2024&quot;. The RIBA had commissioned Ramroop to write the book; she said she was &quot;extremely disappointed that RIBA has taken the decision not to go ahead with publishing it.&quot;

===Governance===

Questions about RIBA transparency were also raised by Alan Jones during his presidency (2019–2021). Between 31 March and 15 June 2020, he temporarily stepped back over a matter in his private life, reported by the RIBA as a &quot;serious incident&quot; to the Charity Commission. After an independent investigation, Jones resumed his role as president on 15 June 2020. In July 2021, he stepped down as a RIBA trustee, feeling unable to support a proposal to renew the contract of the RIBA chief executive, Alan Vallance, having made &quot;serious allegations&quot; about Vallance&#x27;s conduct in February 2020. Senior figures demanded the body &#x27;come clean&#x27; about the conflict saying &quot;The RIBA is becoming an increasingly secretive organisation. ... Confidentiality has been weaponised and woe betide anyone who wants to ask difficult questions...&quot; A Council Board Advisory Group was established, with a QC investigating complaints. Jones told &quot;Architects&#x27; Journal&quot; that he had come under pressure from senior RIBA figures to resign, and felt that &quot;in terms of [RIBA&#x27;s] transparency and accountability, there is room for improvement.&quot;

A RIBA council member, Kerr Robertson, was removed as a councillor in October 2022. Described by &quot;Architects&#x27; Journal&quot; as a whistleblower, Robertson had criticised RIBA&#x27;s board about issues including alleged conflicts of interest, institutional bullying, trustee interference in RIBA election rules changes, and a data breach.

==Presidents==
Presidents of the RIBA are elected by RIBA members, serve a two-year term and chair the RIBA Council. The post was created in 1835, shortly after the institute&#x27;s founding. In 2009, 174 years later, Ruth Reed became the institute&#x27;s first female president.

The current RIBA president, serving from September 2023 to August 2025, is Muyiwa Oki, who was elected in August 2022 and took office on 1 September 2023.


== Secretaries ==
The role of secretary of the RIBA was established in 1871. Between 1835 and 1870, the secretarial duties of the institute fell to honorary secretaries. Recent and current holders of the role are now referred to as chief executive.

<text>Pituffik Space Base ( ; ; ), formerly Thule Air Base (), is a United States Space Force base located on the northwest coast of Greenland in the Kingdom of Denmark under a defense agreement between Denmark and the United States. Denmark was a founding member of NATO in 1949 and the 1951 Greenland Defense Agreement allowed the United States to operate the base under a NATO framework. Under the agreement the Danish national flag must be side by side with the US national flag on the base.

It is the northernmost installation of the U.S. Armed Forces, north of the Arctic Circle and from the North Pole. Pituffik&#x27;s Arctic environment includes icebergs in North Star Bay, two islands (Saunders Island and Wolstenholme Island), a polar ice sheet, and Wolstenholme Fjord. The base is home to a substantial portion of the global network of missile warning sensors of Space Delta 4, and space surveillance and space control sensors of Space Delta 2, providing space awareness and advanced missile detection capabilities to North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), the United States Space Force, and joint partners.

Pituffik Space Base is also home to the 821st Space Base Group and is responsible for space base support within the Pituffik Defense Area for the multinational population of &quot;Team Pituffik&quot;. The base hosts the 12th Space Warning Squadron (12 SWS) which operates a Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) designed to detect and track ICBMs launched against North America. The base is also host to Detachment 1 of the 23rd Space Operations Squadron, part of the Space Delta 6&#x27;s global satellite control network. The airfield&#x27;s runway handles more than 3,000 US and international flights per year. The base is also home to the northernmost deep water port in the world.

Pituffik Space Base has previously served as the regional hub for nearby installations, including Cape Atholl (LORAN station), Camp Century (Ice Cap Camp), Camp TUTO (Ice Cap Approach Ramp and Airstrip), Sites 1 and 2 (Ice Cap Radar Stations), P-Mountain (radar and communications site), J-Site (BMEWS), North and South Mountains (research sites), and a research rocket firing site. It also was essential in the construction and resupply of High Arctic weather stations, including CFS Alert (Alert Airport) and Station Nord.

== History ==

===Location and original population===
In 1818, Sir John Ross&#x27;s expedition made first contact with nomadic Inuktun in the area. James Saunders&#x27;s expedition aboard HMS &quot;North Star&quot; was marooned in North Star Bay in 1849–50 and named landmarks. Robert Peary built a support station by a protected harbor at the foot of iconic Mount Dundas in 1892. It served as a base camp for his expeditions and attracted a permanent population. In 1910 explorer Knud Rasmussen established a missionary and trading post there. He called the site &quot;Thule&quot; after classical &quot;ultima Thule&quot;; the Inuit called it &quot;Umanaq&quot; (&quot;heart-shaped&quot;), and the site is commonly called &quot;Dundas&quot; today. The United States abandoned its territorial claims in the area in 1917 in connection with the purchase of the Virgin Islands. Denmark assumed control of the village in 1937.

A cluster of huts known as Pituffik (&quot;the place the dogs are tied&quot;) stood on the wide plain where the base was built in 1951; a main base street was named Pituffik Boulevard. The population was forcibly relocated to Thule. Later in 1953, the USAF planned to construct an air defense site near that village, and in order to limit contact with soldiers, the Danish government again relocated 130 inhabitants of &quot;Old Thule&quot;, settling them north in a newly constructed village also named Thule (colloquially &quot;New Thule&quot;, now Qaanaaq).

In a Danish Supreme Court judgment of 28 November 2003, the move was considered an expropriative intervention. During the proceedings it was recognized by the Danish government that the movement was a serious interference and an unlawful act against the local population. The Thule tribe was awarded damages of 500,000 kroner, and the individual members of the tribe who had been exposed to the transfer were granted compensation of 15,000 or 25,000 each. A Danish radio station continued to operate at Dundas, and the abandoned houses remained. The USAF only used that site for about a decade, and it has since returned to civilian use.

Knud Rasmussen was the first to recognize the Pituffik plain as ideal for an airport. USAAF Colonel Bernt Balchen, who built Sondrestrom Air Base, knew Rasmussen and his idea. Balchen led a flight of two Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats to Thule on 24 August 1942 and then sent a report advocating an air base to USAAF chief Henry &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold. However, the 1951 air base site is a few kilometers inland from the original 1946 airstrip and across the bay from the historical Thule settlement, to which it is connected by an ice road. The joint Danish-American defense area, designated by treaty, also occupies considerable inland territory in addition to the air base itself.

===World War II===
After the German occupation of Denmark on 9 April 1940, Henrik Kauffmann, Danish Ambassador to the United States, made an agreement &quot;In the name of the king&quot; with the United States, authorizing the United States to defend the Danish colonies on Greenland from German aggression – this agreement faced Kauffmann with a charge of high treason by the protectorate Government. Beginning in the summer of 1941, the US Coast Guard and the War Department established weather and radio stations at Narsarsuaq Airport (Bluie West-1), Sondrestrom Air Base (Bluie West-8), Ikateq (Bluie East Two), and Gronnedal (Bluie West-9). In 1943 the Army Air Forces set up weather stations Scoresbysund (Bluie East-3) on the east coast around the southern tip of Greenland, and Thule (Bluie West-6) to be operated by Danish personnel. Many other sites were set up, but BW-6, isolated in the far North, was then of very minor importance.

===Joint weather station===
After liberation, Denmark ratified the Kauffmann treaty but began efforts to take over US installations. Nonetheless, in summer 1946, the radio and weather station was enhanced with a gravel airstrip and an upper-air (balloon) observatory. This was part of an American-Canadian initiative to construct joint weather stations in the High Arctic. This station was under joint US-Danish operation. The location changed from the civilian village at Thule (Dundas) to mainland Pituffik. In 1946–1951, the airstrip played an important role in Arctic resupply, aerial mapping, research, and search-and rescue.

The ratification of the treaty in 1951 did not change much, except that the Danish national flag must be side by side with the US national flag on the base.

===Modern air base===
In 1949, Denmark joined NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and abandoned its attempt to remove the United States bases. By the outbreak of the Korean War next year, the USAF embarked on a global program of base-building in which Thule (at the time) would be considered the crown jewel owing to its location across the Pole from the USSR, as well as its merit of being the northernmost port to be reliably resupplied by ship. Thule became a key point in American nuclear retaliation strategy. Strategic Air Command (SAC) bombers flying over the Arctic presented less risk of early warning than using bases in the United Kingdom. Defensively, Thule could serve as a base for intercepting bomber attacks along the northeastern approaches to Canada and the US.

A board of Air Force officers headed by Gordon P. Saville made a recommendation to pursue a base at Thule in November 1950. It was subsequently supported by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and approved by President Truman. To replace the agreement entered into during World War II between the US and Denmark, a new agreement with respect to Greenland was ratified on 27 April 1951 (effective on 8 June 1951). At the request of NATO, the agreement became a part of the NATO defense program. The pact specified that the two nations would arrange for the use of facilities in Greenland by NATO forces in defense of the NATO area known as the Greenland Defense Area.

Thule Air Base was constructed in secret under the code name Operation Blue Jay, but the project was made public in September 1952. Construction for Thule Air Base began in 1951 and was completed in 1953. The construction of Thule is said to have been comparable in scale to the enormous effort required to build the Panama Canal. The United States Navy transported the bulk of men, supplies, and equipment from the naval shipyards in Norfolk, Virginia. On 6 June 1951 an armada of 120 ships sailed from Naval Station Norfolk. On board were 12,000 men and 300,000 tons of cargo. They arrived at Thule on 9 July 1951. Construction, aided by continuous daylight in summer, took place around the clock. The workers lived on board the ships until quarters were built. Once they moved into the quarters, the ships returned home.

On 16 June 1951, the base was accidentally discovered by French cultural anthropologist and geographer Jean Malaurie and his Inuit friend Kutikitsoq, on their way back from the geomagnetic North Pole.

===Strategic Air Command===

Originally established as a Strategic Air Command installation, Thule would periodically serve as a dispersal base for B-36 Peacemaker and B-47 Stratojet aircraft during the 1950s, as well as providing an ideal site to test the operability and maintainability of these weapon systems in extreme cold weather. Similar operations were also conducted with B-52 Stratofortress aircraft in the 1950s and 1960s.

In 1954, the Globecom Tower, a tower for military radio communication, was built at Northmountain. At the time of its completion it was the third tallest human-made structure on earth and the tallest structure north of the Arctic Circle in the Western hemisphere.

In the winter of 1956-1957, three KC-97 tankers and alternately one of two RB-47H aircraft made polar flights to inspect Soviet defenses. Five KC-97s prepared for flight with engines running in temperatures of in order to ensure three could achieve airborne status. After a two-hour head start, a B-47 would catch up with them at the northeast coastline of Greenland where two would offload fuel to top off the B-47&#x27;s tanks (the third was an air spare). The B-47 would then fly seven hours of reconnaissance, while the tankers would return to Thule, refuel, and three would again fly to rendezvous with the returning B-47 at northeast Greenland. The B-47 averaged ten hours and in the air, unless unpredictable weather closed Thule. In that case the three tankers and the B-47 had to additionally fly to one of three equidistant alternates: England, Alaska, or Labrador. All of this sometimes took place in moonless, 24-hour Arctic darkness, December through February. These flights demonstrated the capabilities of the US Strategic Air Command to Soviet Anti-Air Defense.

In 1959, the airbase was the main staging point for the construction of Camp Century, some from the base. Carved into the ice, and powered by a nuclear reactor, PM-2A Camp Century was officially a scientific research base, but in reality was the site of the top secret Project Iceworm. The camp operated from 1959 until 1967.

In the late 1950s, the DEW 1 to 4 were built as &quot;weather stations&quot;. Thule Air Base would act as a supply station for the DYE bases.

===Aerospace defense===

In 1957 construction began on four Nike Missile sites around the base, and they and their radar systems were operational by the end of 1958.

In 1961, a Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) radar was constructed at &quot;J-Site&quot;, northeast of main base. BMEWS was developed by the RCA Corporation in order to provide North America warning of a transpolar missile attack from the Russian mainland and submarine-launched missiles from the Arctic and North Atlantic oceans. At this time, Thule was at its peak with a population of about 10,000. Starting in July 1965, there was a general downsizing of activities at Thule. The base host unit, the 4683d Air Defense Wing, was discontinued. By January 1968, the population of Thule was down to 3,370. On 21 January 1968, a B-52G bomber carrying four nuclear weapons crashed just outside Thule – see below.

Thule is the location where the fastest recorded sea level surface wind speed in the world was measured, when a peak speed of was recorded on 8 March 1972, immediately prior to the instrument&#x27;s destruction.

===Air Force Space Command from 1982 to 2019===

Thule became an Air Force Space Command base in 1982. Today Thule is home to the 821st Space Base Group, which exercises air base support responsibilities within the Thule Defense Area. The base hosts the 12th Space Warning Squadron (21st Operations Group, 21st Space Wing), a Ballistic Missile Early Warning Site designed to detect and track ICBMs launched against North America. Missile warning and space surveillance information flows to NORAD command centers located at Peterson Space Force Base, Colorado. Thule is also host to Detachment 1 of the 23rd Space Operations Squadron, part of the 50th Space Wing&#x27;s global satellite control network, as well as operating many new weapons systems. In addition, the airfield boasts a asphalt runway, with 3,000 US and international flights per year.

A delegation from the NATO Parliamentary Assembly visited Thule in early September 2010 and were told by the base commander that, at that time (summer), approximately 600 personnel were serving at Thule, a mix of mostly US and Danish active duty personnel and contractors.

There is only a brief period each year in the summer when sea ice thins sufficiently to send supply ships to the base. The US sends one heavy supply ship each summer in what is called Operation Pacer Goose.

=== Transfer to Space Force ===
In 2020, Thule Air Base was formally transferred to the United States Space Force. On 6 April 2023, Thule was renamed Pituffik Space Base, reflecting its status as a Space Force base and the native name for the region.

==Remote tracking station==
Thule Tracking Station (TTS) is operated by Pituffik Space Base, using the callsign POGO. The station ) is a U.S. Space Force installation in Greenland, near the base, and has a Remote Tracking Station (callsign: Polar Orbiting Geophysical Observatory (POGO)) of the Satellite Control Network.

It was originally the classified 6594th Test Wing&#x27;s Operating Location 5 designated by Air Force Systems Command on 15 October 1961: the station was operational on 30 March 1962, with &quot;transportable antenna vans parked in an old Strategic Air Command bomb assembly building.&quot; 
The permanent RTS equipment was emplaced in 1964, and a communications terminal was emplaced on Pingarssuit Mountain—Thule Site N-32 (moved to Thule Site J in 1983.

=== USAF tugboat ===
To assist with port operations, Pituffik is home to the only tugboat in the Department of the Air Force, the 71-foot &quot;Rising Star (USAF TG-71-9001)&quot;. In the summertime, the &quot;Rising Star&quot; escorts fuel tankers and cargo ships, aligns them with the pier, and moves icebergs out of the way as vessels enter North Star Bay. It is also used for sightseeing tours of the surrounding bays and fjords during the summer. In the winter, it is hauled onto shore. In 2020, the tugboat was used to save a sinking ship and its crew of six 50 kilometers south of base, towing the distressed ship back to the port at Pituffik.

==Accidents==
===C-124 plane crash (1954)===
In 1954, a Douglas C-124C Globemaster II operated by the US Air Force crashed on approach to the air base, killing ten people.

===B-52 nuclear bomber crash (1968)===

On 21 January 1968, a B-52G Stratofortress from the 380th Strategic Aerospace Wing, Plattsburgh Air Force Base, New York, on a secret airborne nuclear alert crashed and burned on the ice near Thule Air Base. The impact detonated the high explosives in the primary units of all four of the B28 nuclear bombs it carried, but nuclear and thermonuclear reactions did not take place due to the PAL and fail-safe mechanisms in the weapons, thus preventing the actual detonation of the weapons themselves. The resulting fire caused extensive radioactive contamination. More than 700 Danish civilians and US military personnel worked under hazardous conditions, the former without protective gear, to clean up the nuclear material. In 1987, nearly 200 of the Danish workers tried unsuccessfully to sue the United States. Kaare Ulbak, chief consultant to the Danish National Institute of Radiation Hygiene, said Denmark had carefully studied the health of the Thule workers and found no evidence of increased mortality or cancer.

The Pentagon maintained that all four weapons had been destroyed. Although many of the details of the accident are still classified, some information was released by the US authorities under the Freedom of Information Act. After reviewing these files, an investigative reporter from BBC News claimed in May 2007 that the USAF was unable to account for one of the weapons. In 2009, the assertions of the BBC were refuted by a Danish report after a review of the available declassified documentation.

== Airlines and destinations ==

===Airlines ===

, one airline provided commercial service to Pituffik.
===Cargo shipping===
Ocean transportation is provided by Schuyler Line Navigation Company, a US flag ocean carrier. Schuyler Line operates under government contract to supply sustainment and building supplies to the base.

==Climate==
Pituffik has a tundra climate (ET) with long, severely cold winters lasting most of the year and short and cool summers. Precipitation is very low year round, but peaks during summer. The structures of the base are built on permafrost which makes them vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
==Film==
Pituffik Space Base is depicted in the 2023 documentary film The Color of Ice, which follows scientists testing a hot-tip drill to melt into the ice sheet at the edge of the base. The film highlights how the ice-sheet surface at TUTO Ramp Road, which was built by United States Army Corps of Engineers for ice-sheet access to Camp Century in the 1960s, has melted downwards by almost 100 feet. Pituffik Space Base itself is arguably presented as a liminal space in the film.

<doc id="750744" wikidata="Q4787008" url="?curid=750744" title="Architects Registration Board">
<text>The Architects Registration Board (ARB) is the statutory body for the registration of architects in the United Kingdom. It operates under the Architects Act 1997 as amended, a consolidating Act. It began under the Architects (Registration) Act 1931 (21 &amp; 22 Geo. 5. c. 33) which gave it the name the Architects&#x27; Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK). It prescribes architectural qualifications, maintains the Register of Architects, issues a code of professional conduct and competence and imposes sanctions if a finding of unacceptable professional conduct or serious professional incompetence is made against an architect. Its main source of income is fees payable under Part II of the Act by persons on their becoming registered or for their retention on the Register. The board is required to pay into the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom any sum paid under a penalty order which its Professional Conduct Committee has made under Part III of the Act (in conduct cases). Fines imposed by a magistrates&#x27; court (or similar in Scotland or Northern Ireland) under Part IV of the Act (in misuse of title cases) are not payable to the board.

From January 2019 all board members (five architects and six non-architects) are appointed by the Privy Council.

==Registration==
A registrar, who may be an employee of the board or its contractor, is appointed for the purpose of admitting persons to the register or placing them on the list of visiting EU architects and, in some instances, causing matters concerning conduct and competence to be investigated.

==Prescribing qualifications==
As the UK &quot;competent authority&quot; for the purpose of Article 46 of the Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications Directive 2005/36/EC, the ARB has published its procedures for the prescription of qualifications for persons applying for registration under section 4 of the Architects Act 1997.

In 2022, the ARB proposed radical changes to how architects were trained including scrapping the existing Parts 1 to 3 and switching to a more flexible, ‘outcomes-based’ system. The ARB said its changes &quot;will open up the profession to a wider pool of talent, offering those who might have previously been excluded a new range of routes to qualification and professional practice&quot;.

==&quot;Discipline&quot; in the Architects Act 1997 (as amended)==
The primary meaning of &quot;discipline&quot; traditionally refers to education, with the meaning of a branch of knowledge (as: &quot;in what discipline is his doctorate?&quot;; &quot;teachers should be well trained in their subject&quot;; &quot;anthropology is the study of ...).

In the Architects Act 1997 (as amended) education is referred to in Part II which is headed &quot;Registration etc.&quot;, not in Part III which is headed &quot;Discipline&quot;. References in Part II are:
:&quot;educational establishments&quot; in section 4A(2)(c)(i);
:&quot;education and training &quot; in section 6(2A);
:&quot;educational bodies&quot; in section 6(3)(b);
:&quot;architectural education&quot; in section 6A.
:&quot;The Education Fund&quot; is mentioned in SCHEDULE 2 (Section 27, Transitional Provisions).

In Part III of the Architects Act 1997 &quot;Discipline&quot; is being used in one of the secondary meanings, such as:

:punish to gain control or enforce obedience: &quot;The teacher disciplined the pupils rather frequently&quot;;

:the act of punishing: &quot;The offenders deserved the harsh discipline they received&quot;

==Professional Conduct Committee of the ARB==

The legislation requires there to be a Professional Conduct Committee of the Board (whose remuneration or expenses are decided and paid by the Board as the corporate body). The function of this Committee is to hear and determine allegations against registered persons which have been formally reported or referred to it in accordance with the Architects Act 1997 (as amended) and the Rules which the Board is authorised to make.

The Act states explicitly that failure to comply with the provisions of the code of professional conduct issued by the Board shall not be taken of itself to constitute unacceptable professional conduct. The Act also provides for the publication of a statement exonerating an architect against whom an allegation of unacceptable professional conduct or serious professional incompetence has not been sustained.

==Judicial precedent==

On an appeal to a divisional court in 1957 concerning a pure breach of the Code of Professional Conduct under the legislation then in force (the architect was practising an estate agent&#x27;s business as well as his own), when the registration body was constituted under the name the Architects&#x27; Registration Council of the United Kingdom, Mr Justice Devlin ruled: &quot;It is not of itself disgraceful to disagree with a majority view and to act accordingly. It is only if a man has bound himself in honour to accept that view and to act according to the code that a deliberate breach of the code for his own profit can be called disgraceful&quot;. In the course of giving judgment in this appeal Lord Chief Justice Goddard had mentioned a letter which had been sent in 1937 by &quot;the president of the council&quot; [sic] to the Institute of Chartered Surveyors recognising the fact that there was nothing in a Bill, which the council was then promoting (and which subsequently became the Architects Registration Act, 1938), to interfere with the activities of registered architects.

==The decisive issues concerning the legislation for the Register of Architects==

Records held by the British Architectural Library show that from the 1890s the motivations for promoting and opposing a registration act had been mixed. But the content of the originating act of 1931 as amended by the act of 1938 shows that the decisive issue at that time was the importance attached to giving to architects the responsibility of superintending or supervising the building works of local authorities (for housing and other projects), rather than to persons professionally qualified only as municipal or other engineers. A significant indicator for this inference is in section 1 (1) of the 1938 act.

By the 1970s that issue had had its day, to be replaced by another which has resulted in the current legislation: the Architects Act 1997 as amended. The issue which emerged in the 1970s developed into the obligation imposed on the United Kingdom and other European governments to comply with European Union Directives concerning the designation of &quot;competent authorities&quot; in connection with the mutual recognition of professional qualifications in favour of equal standards across borders, in furtherance of the single market policy.

==Inspection of the register==
In connection with the protection of title and the enforcement provisions, the originating and later legislation imposed on the registration body (now the ARB) a requirement to provide copies of the Register annually. Formerly, hard bound copies of all volumes in the annual series, from volume 1 for 1933, were available for inspection by members of the public at the British Architectural Library of the Royal Institute of British Architects, London. Latterly, some hiatus on the part of the Board in producing printed copies of the Register in accordance with the legislation and the Board&#x27;s previous practice has impeded the continuation of the series for retention (on the part of the British Architectural Library or others) as annual volumes for reference. The current website offers only a downloadable pdf format.

For other more limited purposes and for commercial and similar purposes names of persons currently registered can be searched online at a website maintained by the registration body. The information held on this version of the Register could help members of the public, who wish to find an architect to meet their needs, to locate a practitioner who has registered status and is conveniently situated.

<text>Isaac Wayne MacVeagh (April 19, 1833 – January 11, 1917) was an American lawyer, politician and diplomat. He served as the 36th Attorney General of the United States under the administrations of Presidents James A. Garfield and Chester A. Arthur.

==Biography==
===Early life===
MacVeagh was born in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, on April 19, 1833, the son of Major MacVeagh and Margaret (&quot;née&quot; Lincoln) McVeagh. His brother, Franklin MacVeagh, was a Chicago wholesale grocer, banker and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under President William Howard Taft.

He attended Yale University, where he was a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Phi chapter), and graduated tenth in his class in 1853. He was admitted to the bar in 1856, and was the District Attorney of Chester County, Pennsylvania, from 1859 through 1864. During the American Civil War he joined the emergency militia of Pennsylvania that was organized against the threat of Confederate invasion in 1862 and 1863. He raised an independent cavalry company and later served in the 29th Emergency Militia Regiment, reaching the rank of major.

===Politician and lawyer===
MacVeagh became a leader in the Republican Party, and was a prominent opponent of his father-in-law, Simon Cameron, in the fight within the party in 1871. He was the Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire in 1870 through 1871, and was a member of the state constitutional convention of 1872 and 1873.

In 1875, MacVeagh co-founded the Philadelphia-based law firm known today as Dechert LLP. He also served as Chairman of the MacVeagh Commission, sent in 1877 by President Rutherford B. Hayes to Louisiana, which secured the settlement of the contest between two existing state governments and thus made possible the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the state.

MacVeagh served as the 36th Attorney General in 1881 under President James A. Garfield. He resigned after President Garfield&#x27;s assassination. Chester Arthur was to be 21st President and MacVeagh served as a cabinet member.

In 1892, he supported Grover Cleveland, the Democratic nominee for the presidency, and from 1893 to 1897 he served as Ambassador to Italy. He returned to the Republican Party in 1896. In 1897, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. In 1903, he was a chief counsel of the United States before the Hague tribunal in the case regarding the claims of Germany, Britain and Italy against the republic of Venezuela.

After the outbreak of World War I MacVeagh championed the cause of the Allies in an article &quot;The Impossible Chasm&quot;, contributed to the &quot;North American Review&quot; in July 1915. In his last article &quot;Lusitania Day: May 7 1916&quot;, for the same magazine, he assailed the slowness of the American government in asserting its rights against Germany.

==Personal life==
MacVeagh married Letitia Miner Lewis, in 1856. They had one son, Charles MacVeagh (June 6, 1860 – December 4, 1931), who became the Ambassador to Japan.

In 1866, after his first wife&#x27;s death, he married Virginia Rolette Cameron, a daughter of U.S. Secretary of War Simon Cameron.

MacVeagh died in Washington, D.C., on January 11, 1917. He was buried at the Church of the Redeemer Cemetery in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.

<text>Crotched Mountain is a small mountain in western Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, in the United States. The summit of the mountain is in the town of Francestown, while the western slopes of the mountain rise in the town of Bennington, and a long southern ridge of the mountain is in Greenfield. The mountain was named for its appearance. Early settlers thought its V-shaped peaks resembled the fork or &quot;crotch&quot; of a tree.

The Crotched Mountain Ski &amp; Ride occupies the northern slopes of the mountain. It has 25 trails, 5 chairlifts, and of vertical drop. The Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center occupies a portion of the mountain&#x27;s southern ridge in Greenfield.

The mountain was the site of the world&#x27;s first wind farm. In 1980, US Windpower installed 20 wind turbines rated at 30 kilowatts each, on the shoulder of Crotched Mountain. The company went out of business and the wind turbines were dismantled years ago.

<text>The University of West Florida (West Florida or UWF) is a public university in Pensacola, Florida, United States. Established in 1963 as a member institution of the State University System of Florida, the University of West Florida is a comprehensive research university without faculties of law or medicine, a designated space-grant institution, and sits on the third largest campus in the State University System, at . The university&#x27;s mascot is Argie the Argonaut and its logo is the chambered nautilus.

==History==

In 1962, the Florida Legislature authorized the State Board of Education to locate a state university in Escambia County. Harold Crosby was appointed the first president in July 1964. UWF became the sixth institution of the State University System of Florida, which today consists of twelve public universities.

Ground was broken on April 16, 1965, and in the same year the chambered nautilus was adopted as the official UWF emblem. UWF was originally an upper-level institution, enrolling juniors, seniors and graduate students. The first students began classes in the fall of 1967, and in June 1968, 58 students received degrees in the first commencement ceremony. In 1969, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools accredited the university undergraduate programs, and the first master&#x27;s degree programs were established.

In July 1979, the university organized into a more traditional structure by establishing three colleges: Arts and Sciences, Business, and Education. In 1999, the colleges reorganized into the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Business and the College of Professional Studies. In Aug. 2012, the former three-college structure transitioned into four academic colleges: College of Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities; College of Education and Professional Studies; College of Science, Engineering and Health; and the College of Business. The most recent reorganization took place in 2015, splitting the former College of Science, Engineering and Health in two.

Today, the university has four colleges: College of Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities; College of Business; Hal Marcus College of Science and Engineering; and Usha Kundu, MD College of Health. In addition, UWF has the School of Education.

===Chambered Nautilus===

<doc id="750760" wikidata="Q1317441" url="?curid=750760" title="Mai Shiranui">
<text>is a character in the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series of fighting games by SNK. Introduced in 1992&#x27;s &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot;, the character was originally conceived as a male character named &quot;Ninja Master&quot;, but when a request was put in to include a female character in the game they revised the concept entirely. For the game&#x27;s sequel &quot;Fatal Fury 3&quot; they considered replacing her with another female character, but due to heavy fan request she returned instead and has appeared in nearly every entry in both the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;King of Fighters&quot; series since.

Mai is a Japanese kunoichi and the inheritor of her family&#x27;s ninjitsu fighting style. Deeply in love with the character Andy Bogard, she enters martial arts tournaments against him so he may see her as a warrior. In addition to the aforementioned series she has appeared in a multitude of other games including the &quot;SNK vs Capcom&quot; series and various collaboration events between SNK and other gaming companies. She has been voiced by various voice actresses including Akoya Sogi, Kotono Mitsuishi, Sarah Sawatsky, Lisa Ann Beley, Rebecca Rose, Kotono Mitsuishi, and Megumi Hayashibara. In live action media, she has been portrayed by American actress Maggie Q, as well as Chinese actress Pan Chun Chun.

Mai has been well received, seen as a mascot for SNK as a whole who has heavily promoted her in various video game crossovers and merchandise. Her portrayal which often emphasizes the swaying of her large breasts has been cited as one of the first examples of the concept of breast physics in gaming, and a significant element of her character&#x27;s appeal. Other outlets have attributed some of her popularity to &quot;Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture&quot;″s portrayal of her, while others have praised her personality and ownership of her sexuality. She has additionally been seen as a rival character to &quot;Street Fighter&quot;″s Chun-Li, and symbolic of the rivalry between SNK and &quot;Street Fighter&quot; developer Capcom. She has also been cited as a frequent subject of cosplay, which her outfit in particular seeing frequent usage in China and Taiwan in promotions and media across both countries.

==Conception and creation==

Introduced in the 1992 SNK developed fighting game &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot;, the character was originally conceived as a male ninja simply named Ninja Master. However, after the character&#x27;s concept was about sixty percent realized, a request was put in to include a female character, and they scrapped their original idea, retaining the ninja identity while developing several character concepts. In terms of personality, they wanted her to be strong-willed woman who made most of her own equipment, and to have a taste in heavy metal music, particularly the band Pantera.

Standing 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall, Mai is a Japanese woman with measurements of 87-55-91 cm (34-22-36 in). Her long brown hair is worn in a ponytail style, with bangs that frame her face and an ornate hairpin holding it in place. Her outfit consists of a red uwagi with extended loincloth, while a decorative sash tied to form a butterfly musubi dangles from behind her. While matching fingerless gloves and red tabi cover her hands and feet, the lower portion of the uwagi ends similarly to a leotard with the back pulled tightly between her buttocks. The outfit exposes a significant part of her body, particularly her hips, cleavage and the sides of her breasts. While the development team originally gave her a more stern appearance in &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot;, they softened it in her subsequent appearances.

She was originally intended to be excluded from the game&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Fatal Fury 3&quot; and replaced with another female character, Alice Chrystler. However, due to heavy fan request, Mai returned instead. Several redesigns were considered for her appearance in the game, including a full armored appearance in heavy ninja gear, before changing her attire to incorporate a bustier. When asked if this was done to reduce the amount of exposure from her outfit, the development team responded there was &quot;no reason in particular&quot;. Subsequent games however reverted to her previous design, which has remained mostly consistent since with minimal changes.

===&quot;The King of Fighters&quot; and onward===
As her design was refined for &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, they aimed to emphasize her sex appeal, modelling her breasts after model Fumie Hosokawa, while her hips were based on those of media personality Ai Iijima. During work on &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot;, the person working on Mai&#x27;s sprites, C.A.C Yamaski, asked the development head if he could increase the number of sprites for her standing idle animation. The latter agreed due to having extra space on the game&#x27;s ROM, but was surprised upon seeing the results: while in earlier games her breasts were given a slight amount of jiggle in her animations, the sprite artist had emphasized the movement of her breasts dramatically. While the animation was censored in Western releases of the game, this aspect endured into subsequent titles and the team felt this was a significant factor in her enduring popularity.

For her portrayal in &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot;, character artist Ritsu Yamaguchi wanted to recreate the atmosphere of her &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series appearances. He noted that while &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; often placed emphasis on her breasts, hips and buttocks to depict her as a character that exudes sex appeal, he saw her character in &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; as portrayed &quot;stoic&quot; motions and as a serious fighter even though her clothing was still revealing. He felt her outfit alone would illustrate her sex appeal, so he focused on the stoic aspect to give her a &quot;more sensual atmosphere&quot;, downplaying many of her more sexual animations by comparison.

Later games meanwhile added secondary outfit options. For her appearance in the &quot;King of Fighters: Maximum Impact&quot; series, her &quot;Another&quot; outfit shortens her hair into a bob cut with the ends flared out, with both her hair and outfit changed to black. Her gloves and boots are larger in this version, with a fur lining around them and parts of her uwagi, while a red scarf extends from her neck and juts out from behind her. In his blog during the game&#x27;s development, game script writer Akihiko Ureshino joked that this version of her design &quot;feels like her fabric area has decreased despite her increasing beauty&quot;, though he was worried some variations may be removed from the final game for being too overt. Meanwhile, in &quot;SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy&quot;, she is most prominently given a cow print bikini for an outfit which features a matching fake tail, while her hair clip is changed to a set of horns with fake cow ears extending from it.

For her appearance in &quot;Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&quot;, her recurring outfit was relegated to a secondary outfit. Her primary meanwhile was changed to black leather pants, a matching unzipped jacket with loose sleeves that exposed her midriff and cleavage, and black leather gloves on her hands. The look was inspired by her love of heavy metal and to give her a more casual outfit, as Ureshino felt her regular outfit would be out of place as street attire and would more likely get her arrested. This outfit was also included for her guest character appearance in &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; as an alternative to her regular attire.

==Appearances==
===Fighting games===
Mai Shiranui is a Japanese kunoichi first introduced in the 1992 video game &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot; by SNK. The inheritor of her family&#x27;s ninjitsu style, she met Andy Bogard at a young age and fell in love with the boy, though Andy himself is dedicated to his own martial arts training. During the three man team &quot;King of Fighters&quot; series of tournaments, she initially attempts to partner with him, though he rebukes her offer, and she instead joins with other female fighters such as Yuri Sakazaki and King so Andy will recognize her as a fighter. Since her introduction she has appeared in almost every &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; title since with the exception of &quot;&quot;. She has also been in almost every &quot;King of Fighters&quot; series game with the exception of &quot;King of Fighter XI&quot;, only appearing in the PlayStation 2 version, and &quot;XII&quot;, where she was excluded entirely. She additionally appears in spinoff game &quot;King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2&quot; and its related title, &quot;King of Fighters Maximum Impact Regulation A&quot;.

In other SNK-related fighting games, Mai has appeared playable in every game in the &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot; series, She is also playable character in &quot;SNK Gals&#x27; Fighters&quot;, &quot;NeoGeo Battle Coliseum&quot;, and &quot;SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy&quot;. She has also appeared in mobile fighting game titles such as &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, &quot;Fatal Fury Mobile&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters-i&quot;, and &quot;The King of Fighters D: DyDO Smile STAND&quot;. Outside of SNK-related works, Mai appears as downloadable content for Koei Tecmo&#x27;s &quot;Dead or Alive 5 Last Round&quot;, its sequel &quot;Dead or Alive 6&quot;, and in Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;.

In video games, the character was originally voiced by Akoya Sogi, with Ami Koshimizu taking over the role with the release of &quot;King of Fighters: Sky Stage&quot; in 2010. Koshimizu stated she initially had an image of Mai as a &quot;mature older sister&quot;, but when they directed her to portray the character as a &quot;cheerful older sister in the neighborhood&quot; instead, she tried to balance the portrayal with a hint of sexiness. To this end, she spoke in a lower tone than normal, and used a lot of expression to create a sense of familiarity to give the impression someone could easily be friends with her. In 2025, Rebecca Rose serves as Mai&#x27;s English voice actress for her appearances in &quot;Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&quot; and Street Fighter 6.

In terms of gameplay, Mai is a very mobile and fast character, but also frequently physically weaker in the games. As a result, playing her effectively requires players to connect with more consistent attacks. However this has also led her to be considered one of the easier characters for beginners in titles, and to master using against other players in older titles. She furthermore has a variety of hand-to-hand combat maneuvers, such as her &quot;Flying Squirrel Dance&quot; diving attack and a rushing cartwheel kick followed by an elbow strike called &quot;Deadly Ninja Bees&quot;. She can additionally produced flames with some of her attacks, and throw her large folding fans as projectiles.

Mai is featured as a playable character in the console shooter games &quot;KOF Sky Stage&quot; and &quot;Neo Geo Heroes: Ultimate Shooting&quot;, the quiz game &quot;Quiz King of Fighters&quot;, and the &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot; spin-off crossover card battle series &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash&quot;. She is also one of the heroes in the Thailand-exclusive MOBA game &quot;The King of Fighters Online&quot;. In a 2017 MMORPG &quot;The King of Fighters: World&quot; by Ledo Interactive, Mai is featured in person as a non-player and tutorial character, but the players will be able to use her Shiranui style for their own characters. Mai also appears in the 1998 visual novel game &quot;The King of Fighters: Kyo&quot;, and later in several titles of SNK&#x27;s &quot;Days of Memories&quot; dating sim series.

She&#x27;s featured, usually as a playable character, in various non-fighting &quot;King of Fighters&quot;-related mobile games either developed or licensed by SNK, including &quot;KOF Gals Mahjong&quot;, &quot;KOF: Battle de Paradise&quot;, &quot;Mini King of Fighters&quot;, &quot;The Rhythm of Fighters&quot;, and &quot;The King of Fighters M&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;97 OL&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters: Destiny&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;98: Ultimate Match Online&quot; action RPG &quot;The King of Fighters All Star&quot;, and augmented reality game &quot;The King of Fighters Orochi Go&quot;.

She additionally appears in Bandai Namco&#x27;s crossover tactical RPG &quot;Queen&#x27;s Gate: Spiral Chaos&quot;, as well as a gamebook for the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Blade&quot; ecchi series.

Mai&#x27;s image was additionally licensed as a roulette character for pachislot machines. In 2003, SNK sued machine manufacturer Aruze for copyright infringement after Mai&#x27;s likeness was used without permission for their pachinko game &quot;Iregui&quot;. Mai is prominently featured in the &quot;Universal Fighting System&quot; collectible card game.

===In other media===

Mai has appeared in various other media related to the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;King of Fighters&quot; series. In film, she was one of the protagonists of the 2009 American live-action movie &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;. The movie is loosely based on the games, and portrays her as a CIA agent and girlfriend to fellow series character Iori Yagami. She works alongside the other heroes to try and stop the villain Rugal, who seeks to use an alternate reality to gain the power of the god Orochi. She was played by Maggie Q, who performed her own stunts, while in Japan she was dubbed by Ami Koshimizu.

In anime, Mai first appears in &quot;Fatal Fury 2: The New Battle&quot; where she is voiced by Sarah Sawatsky in English, and Kotono Mitsuishi in Japanese. Appearing in a small role, she is kidnapped by the villain Laurence Blood, with Andy rescuing her. In the follow up anime &quot;Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture&quot;, Mai helps the others on their quest to stop the antagonist Laocorn Gaudeamus and his henchmen, and is voiced by Lisa Ann Beley in English while Mitsuishi reprises her role in Japanese. She additionally appears in &quot;The King of Fighters: Another Day&quot;, a tie in to &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; where she is voiced by Akoya Sogi.

In other video media, Mai also appears in the YouTube animated series &quot;The King of Fighters: Destiny&quot; as part of the &quot;Queens Team&quot; alongside King and Yuri. Produced in China, she is voiced by Ami Koshimizu in Japanese, and Selene Zhan in Chinese, who was also the dubbing director for the work. Motion capture for Mai&#x27;s body and face meanwhile was provided by Duan Yixuan of the idol group BEJ48. For her crossover appearance in Korean mobile game &quot;Mad Blade&quot;, the developers produced a live-action short film featuring Mai. Played by actress Pan Chun Chun, the short plays on a joke about her originating from 2D fighting games, showing her initially unable to move from side to side against an opponent.

In audio media, Mai appears in &quot;Dengeki G&#x27;s Magazine&quot; drama CD series for &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, where she is voiced by Megumi Hayashibara. In 1994, Japanese idol Reiko Chiba performed a vocal track called &quot;Dear Mai Boi&quot; in character as Mai for her music single &quot;Non Stop! One Way Love&quot;, later cosplaying as the character to promote it. Akoya Sogi meanwhile performed as Mai as part of the &quot;King of Fighter &#x27;97 Radio Drama Clash Edition&quot; broadcast in Japan in 1997. Later, she appeared alongside the rest of SNK&#x27;s voice cast as part of their &quot;NEO・GEO DJ Station Live&quot; audio performances in Shinjuku, Tokyo, singing &quot;Dear Mai Boi&quot; herself in 1998. Recordings of the events were later released on laserdisc and CD as two-disc sets.

==Promotion and merchandise==
Mai has been used extensively by SNK to promote their games and company as a whole, using her image on a variety of products such as clothing and condoms. She was featured in live-action commercials for &quot;Fatal Fury Special&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot; in 1993. Multiple &quot;booth babe&quot; models dressed as the character have been fixtures at Tokyo Game Show and other venues, noted in particular for their popularity at such events. Various Asian celebrities have also been hired to promote the character, such as Korean idol Kyungri of the band Nine Muses, Chinese actress Li Bingbing, and Japanese adult actress Kirara Asuka. Meanwhile, a 2005 fan-voted &quot;Ultimate Mai Shiranui Cosplay Tournament&quot; promotional event in Taiwan exhibited nearly a hundred women who dressed up as Mai.

She has also been the focus of other SNK promotions, such as artist Falcoon signing limited edition posters of Mai at E3 2005. Mai was featured heavily in promotional materials for &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot;, and an exclusive t-shirt depicting her was given to all registered participants in the &quot;King of Fighters&quot; championship at EVO 2012. &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; Premium Edition included a soundtrack with an illustrated case featuring the character, and the game&#x27;s pre-order bonuses included a Mai PlayStation 4 theme. Mai was also announced to join the roster of the mobile action RPG &quot;SNK All-Star&quot; if the number of pre-registered users exceeds half million. A variety of merchandise was also produced to promote her appearance in &quot;SNK Heroines&quot;, including a t-shirt, standees and stickers bundled with special editions of the game. Mai&#x27;s outfit and appearance have also been made available as promotional cosmetic skins for players in a variety of games, including titles such as &quot;GungHo Games&quot;, &quot;The King of Soldier II&quot;, &quot;Dragon Throne: Battle of Red Cliffs&quot;, &quot;Black Desert Online&quot;, &quot;Wizardry Online&quot;, &quot;Mabinogi Heroes&quot;, &quot;HIT&quot;, &quot;Knives Out-Tokyo Royale&quot;, &quot;Phantasy Star Online 2&quot;, &quot;Lost Saga&quot;, &quot;Mobile Legends: Bang Bang&quot;, and &quot;Fall Guys&quot;.

A variety of figures have also been produced by a wide range of manufacturers such as A-Label, Aizu Project, Alphamax, Daiki, Hobby Japan, Max Factory, Volks, SNK themselves, and a &quot;mecha&quot; figure by YCY. In 2009, an exclusive Volks figure was sold in an auction for the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Several major figure product lines have also featured the character, such as the Cy Girls series, , and by Good Smile as part of their Nendoroid and Pop Up Parade figure lines. Meanwhile, several diorama figures have also been released including a 1/6th scale figure by Gantaku, a 1/4th scale figure by Kinetiquettes, and antoher by PJ Studio. A large bust sculpture of Mai was also produced by Queen Studios, featuring glass eyes. In other merchandise, Exar produced a joystick controller modeled after the Neo Geo&#x27;s for PlayStation consoles, decorated with Mai-related imagery. In both 2019 and 2020, an entirely Mai-themed Neo-Geo shop opened in Tokyo&#x27;s Akihabara district for a limited time to celebrate the character&#x27;s in-universe birthday. In November 2024, Japanese fitness company Tanita 
as part of their collaboration with SNK studied the bodies of several &quot;King of Fighters&quot; characters to promote their new body composition monitor, among which included Mai.

==Critical reception==

Mai has been well received since her introduction. The staff of &quot;UGO.com&quot; described her as a mascot not only for &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; but SNK as a whole, and felt the character&#x27;s role as an &quot;unapologetic sex symbol&quot; was a driving force for sales of the &quot;King of Fighters&quot; franchise. &quot;The Mary Sue&quot;″s Princess Weekees meanwhile cited her as one of the most iconic women in fighting games, noting that while SNK&#x27;s games themselves were often overlooked in the mainstream, people, including herself, knew about Mai thanks to her sex appeal. &quot;Joystiq&quot;″s Richard Mitchell meanwhile emphasized the character&#x27;s presence in SNK&#x27;s work over their competitor Capcom&#x27;s stating &quot;there&#x27;s one thing &quot;Street Fighter&quot; will never have, and that&#x27;s Mai&quot;. Her omission from &quot;The King of Fighters XII&quot; drew particular backlash, with players boycotting the game and coining the phrase &quot;no Mai, no buy&quot;. James Stephanie Sterling in an article for &quot;Destructoid&quot; in particular criticized her absence from the game, comparing it to Capcom &quot;releasing &quot;Street Fighter&quot; without Ryu&quot;.

Other outlets meanwhile compared Mai to &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character Chun-Li, as both have been cited as the first two prominent female characters of fighting games. Frederick Badlissi of &quot;Diehard GameFan&quot; jokingly called it the &quot;question of &#x27;anatomic supremacy&#x27; between Mai Shiranui’s breasts (the &#x27;North&#x27;) and Chun-Li’s thighs (the &#x27;South&#x27;)&quot;. &quot;Games Tribune Magazine&quot; writer Javier Bello felt the comparison was in part due to the visual appeal of both characters introducing &quot;a sexy and pleasing touch to the eye&quot; in contrast to a cast of &quot;squads of fighters with plenty of testosterone and muscles&quot;, with Mai&#x27;s emphasis on exposure pushing her popularity further in his opinion. French magazine &quot;Hardcore Gamers&quot; devoted a two-page spread to the characters to compare them, with the article emphasizing while Chun-Li was often the more interesting character, Mai was more consistently alluring, though no less influential on other characters in the fighting game industry.

In regards to her appearance in &quot;Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture&quot;, Jean-Karlo Lemus and Heidi Kemps of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; noted the emphasis on fanservice, particularly with how she was introduced &quot;boobs first&quot; in the production. She compared it to her portrayal in the &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot; video game, and observed while her appearance in the game was attractive, she was not &quot;as over-the-top as she eventually became&quot; in her later &quot;King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot; appearance. Kemps felt the anime&#x27;s portrayal of Mai affected public perception and led to her later more sexualized appearance and Lemus agreed, feeling elements anime character designer Masami Ōbari had inserted into the film focusing on sexuality supported this theory. The observation was shared by the staff of &quot;Game On! USA&quot;, who praised Obari&#x27;s anatomical detail in the film and stated he &quot;made Mai Shinarui the crazy underdressed heroine she is today&quot;. Seiichiro Hayakawa of &quot;Magmix&quot; praised how Obari showed her as a &quot;sensual&quot; character, moreso than he expected, while also displaying her with considerable strength. He further stated that alongside the fanservice, her portrayal left a considerable impression on him of her as a &quot;representative fighting game character&quot;.

Gavin Jasper stated while focus was often placed on her breasts, he felt her &quot;optimistic spirit helps balance her into a fun character who is always a blast to play as&quot;. He further praised how she owned her sexuality, integrating her sex appeal as an intentional part of her character&#x27;s battle strategy. Jasper also added that while she is often portrayed as chasing after Andy, he liked that she was not content with simply being a side character and someone that deserved to be his partner over other characters, her role in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;″ Women&#x27;s Team &quot;ultimately her way of showing him up and teaching him a lesson&quot;. Meanwhile, the staff of Chinese website &quot;163.com&quot; noted that while the &quot;King of Fighters&quot; series later introduced sexier characters, they were often ignored in part thanks to Mai&#x27;s &quot;exaggerated style&quot; and personality, the latter of which they felt was vital for a character&#x27;s enduring appeal.

However, some have complained about her design, feeling it represents a trend of oversexualization of female characters in fighting games. A thesis for the Federal University of Bahia cited Mai as an example of how female fighting game characters hypersexualize the breasts and hips, drawing comparisons to portrayal of the mythological Venus. It additionally cited her as an example of how such games tend to portray Asian women as inherently sexual through their use of traditional clothing and how much of her body it exposes.

===Cultural impact===

The animation of Mai&#x27;s breasts in &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot; has been cited as one of the earliest examples of breast physics in video games, a conception that later games have steadily tried to refine, though Mai has remained the most prominent example in 2D animation of the concept. Brett Elston of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; emphasized that while female fighting game characters were prominent in the 1990s, with each new game often trying to out-sexualize the others, gaming periodicals were &quot;abuzz with commentary on what Mai&#x27;s bobbing bosom meant for the industry&quot;, with Elston comparing it to &quot;witnessing (half-naked) women entering the workplace for the first time&quot;. The staff of &quot;Inside Games&quot; praised it as &quot;80% of Mai Shiranui&#x27;s charm&quot; and an enduring aspect of her character, citing how it fit as a distractionary element of her role as a ninja that was refined to be more realistic as the series progressed.

Mai has been cited as especially popular among the young people in Hong Kong during the late 1990s, impacting local youth and Mong Kok culture in the country. Mai has also been cited as one of the most popular subjects of cosplay worldwide, appearing on televised material such China&#x27;s &quot;Cybernet&quot; television broadcast where the host cosplayed as the character several times, and also on Taiwanese television show &quot;Video Game Fighter&quot;, where both hosts cosplayed as her. In an interview with &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; developer Team Ninja, they stated their character Momiji&#x27;s red clothing and ability to shoot fire was a direct homage to Mai. Mai has also been the frequent subject of explicit third party works, including hentai doujinshi, erotic cosplay, and pornographic films.

Mai&#x27;s outfit has been observed as particularly popular among models in China and Taiwan, with models wearing the attire appearing at non-gaming events such as book signings or car shows. The outfit has also appeared in film, such as 2018&#x27;s &quot;Smiling Proudly in the Gambling World: The Gamble World of Fun&quot; (Chinese: 笑傲赌界) where it is worn by one of the movie&#x27;s antagonists. &quot;Kotaku&quot;″s Brian Ashcraft attributed its popularity to the outfit&#x27;s simplicity rather than any correlation to the &quot;King of Fighters&quot;, with the attire acting as a &quot;uniform of sorts&quot; as an &quot;easy go-to choice&quot; for cosplay. In contrast, Singaporean pop-culture site &quot;Lollipop&quot; felt the outfit demanded &quot;a special kind of physique&quot;, and felt this to why it was popular with models.

In 2019, when discussing Terry Bogard&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, producer Masahiro Sakurai explained while Mai was widely popular, she would not be able to appear in the game in any context as the game was made for &quot;good boys and girls of many different ages&quot;. The statement rapidly became a meme on social media platforms, with Team Ninja taking the opportunity to advertise her inclusion in &quot;Dead or Alive 5&quot; and to welcome players to &quot;the world of adults&quot;. The development team later clarified it was out of concern that her presence would increase the game&#x27;s age rating. The decision still led some to question the exclusion in light of explicit characters such as Bayonetta appearing in the title, with &quot;Inside Games&quot; joking perhaps Mai was &quot;too big&quot; for the title and suggesting it only added to her appeal.

<doc id="750768" wikidata="Q725143" url="?curid=750768" title="Speak &amp; Spell (album)">
<text>Speak &amp; Spell is the debut studio album by English electronic music band Depeche Mode. It was released on 5 October 1981, or possibly 29 October 1981, by Mute Records. It was the band&#x27;s only album to feature Vince Clarke, and is much lighter in tone than their subsequent releases.

The album peaked at number 10 on the UK Albums Chart, and was ranked number 991 in the 2000 book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

==Background and recording==

Depeche Mode had toured their songs in 1980 before going into the studio to record their first album. According to Daniel Miller, who co-produced &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot; with the band, it was a collection of songs the band had been playing live over the past year, plus a few new songs, although some songs from their live act did not make it on the record. Vince Clarke wrote most of the songs, with Martin Gore contributing two tracks. Though they started as a band with a guitar and bass, they switched over to being an all-synthesizer band due to the cheap cost and convenience of the devices. Singer David Gahan recalled that, despite being all-synth, they used them traditionally in their songs, with a lead line, a bass line and a rhythm line. Recorded in early 1981 and signed by Mute Records, by the time the album was released in October 1981, Clarke wanted to leave the band. As the band was negotiating with American label Sire Records for a contract, news of Vince&#x27;s impending departure was kept confidential until after the contract was signed. Seymour Stein, CEO of Sire records, caught one of Depeche Mode&#x27;s early shows and was enthused by their live presence, saying &quot;Depeche Mode were the first of those [early synth] bands that were so fucking great live, that it was just amazing.&quot; &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot; was released in October 1981, the band finished their UK tour and played their last live show with their original lineup in November, and Clarke left shortly after. After quitting, Clarke responded to a classified ad from Alison Moyet and the two collaborated to start the band Yazoo.

When interviewed by Simon Amstell for Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Popworld&quot; programme in 2005, both Gore and Andrew Fletcher stated that the track &quot;What&#x27;s Your Name?&quot; was their least favourite Depeche Mode song of all time.

==Critical reception==
Upon its release, &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot; received generally positive reception from critics. &quot;Record Mirror&quot; praised Depeche Mode&#x27;s smart simplicity and noted the album offers &quot;much to admire and little to disappoint.&quot; Reviewer Sunie commented that the band&#x27;s chief skill &quot;lies in making their art sound artless; simple synthesiser melodies, Gahan&#x27;s tuneful but undramatic singing and a matter-of-fact, gimmick-free production all help achieve this unforced effect.&quot; As a whole she describes it as &quot;a charming, cheeky collection of compulsive dance tunes&quot;. Mike Stand of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; wrote: &quot;Synthesisers and bubblegum go together like tinned peaches and Carnation, hence [Depeche Mode&#x27;s] hit singles: melody, uncluttered electronics and nice voices in humanising harmony.&quot; Paul Morley of the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; described the album as &quot;generous, silly, susceptible electro-tickled pop... that despite its relentless friskiness and unprincipled cheerfulness is encouraging not exasperating&quot;, noting the music&#x27;s &quot;diverting vitality&quot;, and concluding that &quot;Depeche Mode, apparently, could quickly move... far up and away from constructing slightly sarcastic jingles.&quot;

Paul Colbert of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; felt that Depeche Mode speak with &quot;a winning immediacy&quot; and called the album &quot;a wriggling giant of motivation, persuading each muscle to jump in time with the music&quot;, while at the same time criticising the presence of certain tracks such as &quot;Nodisco&quot; that &quot;repeat earlier thoughts and feels without adding fresh views.&quot; Rob White, writing for the Christchurch &quot;Press&quot;, was less positive, calling the music on &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot; &quot;instant pop, instantly disposable, as precious as the gladwrapped swan on the... cover&quot;, remarking that the songs &quot;would actually blow away in the wind... if it wasn&#x27;t for their ability to chance upon melody hooks that drag you along without any real protest&quot; and ultimately calling the album &quot;tedious&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau dismissed the bulk of the album as &quot;tuneful pap&quot; that &quot;crosses Meco (without the humble functionalism), Gary Numan (without the devotion to surface), and Kraftwerk (without the humor—oh, definitely without the humor).&quot;

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Ned Raggett described &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot; as &quot;at once both a conservative, functional pop record and a groundbreaking release&quot;, as well as &quot;an undiluted joy.&quot; Nitsuh Abebe of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; said that the album endures &quot;not as stylish futurism (not anymore) but as the happy noises of teenagers who believed it to be stylish futurism—and with a charming earnestness.&quot; In January 2005, &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot; was included as an &quot;essential&quot; album in &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Depeche Mode + the Story of Electro-Pop&quot; special edition.

==2006 re-release==

The album was re-released on 3 April 2006 (along with &quot;Music for the Masses&quot; and &quot;Violator&quot;) as part of Mute&#x27;s extensive Depeche Mode reissue schedule. This special edition release was a double disc set that included a Hybrid SACD/CD and a DVD. This format included the album in five formats—multi-channel SACD, stereo SACD, PCM stereo CD, DTS 5.1 and Dolby Digital 5.1.

In the United States, the album was not re-released until 2 June 2006. The US version was only a CD rather than a SACD/CD Hybrid, though it still included the DVD which was identical to the European one (barring some different copyrights and logos).

The re-release somewhat preserves the album as it was originally intended. As such, while it is mostly the same as the UK version, North America got a completely new version with some songs that have never been released there. For example, &quot;New Life&quot; was the original version, not a remix, and &quot;I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead&quot; finally debuted (on a Depeche Mode release) in North America. However, &quot;Dreaming of Me&quot;, the band&#x27;s very first single which was not on the original album, was included at the end. The four bonus tracks on the original CD release in the UK, were omitted from the re-issued CD, but were on the DVD.

Also included was a 28-minute documentary about the making of the album entitled &quot;Depeche Mode: 1980–1981 (Do We Really Have to Give Up Our Day Jobs?)&quot; featuring interviews with the group (including Vince Clarke) and other relevant personnel such as Daniel Miller. There is various footage of the group&#x27;s appearances on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; including their very first appearance from 1981 performing &quot;New Life&quot;. There is also vintage BBC footage of the Speak &amp; Spell Tour from the same year.

The remastered album was released on limited-edition vinyl in March 2007.

<text>A cooling tower is a device that rejects waste heat to the atmosphere through the cooling of a coolant stream, usually a water stream, to a lower temperature. Cooling towers may either use the evaporation of water to remove heat and cool the working fluid to near the wet-bulb air temperature or, in the case of &quot;dry cooling towers&quot;, rely solely on air to cool the working fluid to near the dry-bulb air temperature using radiators. 

Common applications include cooling the circulating water used in oil refineries, petrochemical and other chemical plants, thermal power stations, nuclear power stations and HVAC systems for cooling buildings. The classification is based on the type of air induction into the tower: the main types of cooling towers are natural draft and induced draft cooling towers.

Cooling towers vary in size from small roof-top units to very large hyperboloid structures that can be up to tall and in diameter, or rectangular structures that can be over tall and long. Hyperboloid cooling towers are often associated with nuclear power plants, although they are also used in many coal-fired plants and to some extent in some large chemical and other industrial plants. The steam turbine is what necessitates the cooling tower. Although these large towers are very prominent, the vast majority of cooling towers are much smaller, including many units installed on or near buildings to discharge heat from air conditioning. Cooling towers are also often thought to emit smoke or harmful fumes by the general public and environmental activists, when in reality the emissions from those towers mostly do not contribute to carbon footprint, consisting solely of water vapor.

==History==
Cooling towers originated in the 19th century through the development of condensers for use with the steam engine. Condensers use relatively cool water, via various means, to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines. This reduces the back pressure, which in turn reduces the steam consumption, and thus the fuel consumption, while at the same time increasing power and recycling boiler water. However, the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water, without which they are impractical. While water usage is not an issue with marine engines, it forms a significant limitation for many land-based systems.

By the turn of the 20th century, several evaporative methods of recycling cooling water were in use in areas lacking an established water supply, as well as in urban locations where municipal water mains may not be of sufficient supply, reliable in times of high demand, or otherwise adequate to meet cooling needs. In areas with available land, the systems took the form of cooling ponds; in areas with limited land, such as in cities, they took the form of cooling towers.

These early towers were positioned either on the rooftops of buildings or as free-standing structures, supplied with air by fans or relying on natural airflow. An American engineering textbook from 1911 described one design as &quot;a circular or rectangular shell of light plate—in effect, a chimney stack much shortened vertically (20 to 40 ft. high) and very much enlarged laterally. At the top is a set of distributing troughs, to which the water from the condenser must be pumped; from these it trickles down over &quot;mats&quot; made of wooden slats or woven wire screens, which fill the space within the tower&quot;.
A hyperboloid cooling tower was patented by the Dutch engineers Frederik van Iterson and Gerard Kuypers in the Netherlands on August 16, 1916. The first hyperboloid reinforced concrete cooling towers were built by the Dutch State Mine (DSM) Emma in 1918 in Heerlen. The first ones in the United Kingdom were built in 1924 at Lister Drive power station in Liverpool, England. On both locations they were built to cool water used at a coal-fired electrical power station.

According to a Gas Technology Institute (GTI) report, the indirect–dew-point evaporative-cooling Maisotsenko Cycle (M-Cycle) is a theoretically sound method of reducing a working fluid to the ambient fluid’s dew point, which is lower than the ambient fluid’s wet-bulb temperature. The M-cycle utilizes the psychrometric energy (or the potential energy) available from the latent heat of water evaporating into the air. While its current manifestation is as the M-Cycle HMX for air conditioning, through engineering design this cycle could be applied as a heat- and moisture-recovery device for combustion devices, cooling towers, condensers, and other processes involving humid gas streams.

The consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 2040–2069.

In 2021, researchers presented a method for steam recapture. The steam is charged using an ion beam, and then captured in a wire mesh of opposite charge. The water&#x27;s purity exceeded EPA potability standards.

==Classification by use==

===Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)===



An HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) cooling tower is used to dispose of (&quot;reject&quot;) unwanted heat from a chiller. Liquid-cooled chillers are normally more energy efficient than air-cooled chillers due to heat rejection to tower water at or near wet-bulb temperatures. Air-cooled chillers must reject heat at the higher dry-bulb temperature, and thus have a lower average reverse–Carnot-cycle effectiveness. In hot climates, large office buildings, hospitals, and schools typically use cooling towers in their air conditioning systems. Generally, industrial cooling towers are much larger than HVAC towers.
HVAC use of a cooling tower pairs the cooling tower with a liquid-cooled chiller or liquid-cooled condenser. A &quot;ton&quot; of air-conditioning is defined as the removal of . The &quot;equivalent ton&quot; on the cooling tower side actually rejects about due to the additional waste-heat–equivalent of the energy needed to drive the chiller&#x27;s compressor. This &quot;equivalent ton&quot; is defined as the heat rejection in cooling or of water by , which amounts to , assuming a chiller coefficient of performance (COP) of 4.0. This COP is equivalent to an energy efficiency ratio (EER) of 14.

Cooling towers are also used in HVAC systems that have multiple water source heat pumps that share a common piping &quot;water loop&quot;. In this type of system, the water circulating inside the water loop removes heat from the condenser of the heat pumps whenever the heat pumps are working in the cooling mode, then the externally mounted cooling tower is used to remove heat from the water loop and reject it to the atmosphere. By contrast, when the heat pumps are working in heating mode, the condensers draw heat out of the loop water and reject it into the space to be heated. When the water loop is being used primarily to supply heat to the building, the cooling tower is normally shut down (and may be drained or winterized to prevent freeze damage), and heat is supplied by other means, usually from separate boilers.

===Industrial cooling towers===

Industrial cooling towers can be used to remove heat from various sources such as machinery or heated process material. The primary use of large, industrial cooling towers is to remove the heat absorbed in the circulating cooling water systems used in power plants, petroleum refineries, petrochemical plants, natural gas processing plants, food processing plants, semi-conductor plants, and for other industrial facilities such as in condensers of distillation columns, for cooling liquid in crystallization, etc. The circulation rate of cooling water in a typical 700 MWth coal-fired power plant with a cooling tower amounts to about 71,600 cubic metres an hour (315,000 US gallons per minute) and the circulating water requires a supply water make-up rate of perhaps 5 percent (i.e., 3,600 cubic metres an hour, equivalent to one cubic metre every second).

If that same plant had no cooling tower and used once-through cooling water, it would require about 100,000 cubic metres an hour A large cooling water intake typically kills millions of fish and larvae annually, as the organisms are impinged on the intake screens. A large amount of water would have to be continuously returned to the ocean, lake or river from which it was obtained and continuously re-supplied to the plant. Furthermore, discharging large amounts of hot water may raise the temperature of the receiving river or lake to an unacceptable level for the local ecosystem. Elevated water temperatures can kill fish and other aquatic organisms (see &quot;thermal pollution&quot;), or can also cause an increase in undesirable organisms such as invasive species of zebra mussels or algae. 

A cooling tower serves to dissipate the heat into the atmosphere instead, so that wind and air diffusion spreads the heat over a much larger area than hot water can distribute heat in a body of water. Evaporative cooling water cannot be used for subsequent purposes (other than rain somewhere), whereas surface-only cooling water can be re-used.
Some coal-fired and nuclear power plants located in coastal areas do make use of once-through ocean water. But even there, the offshore discharge water outlet requires very careful design to avoid environmental problems.

Petroleum refineries may also have very large cooling tower systems. A typical large refinery processing 40,000 metric tonnes of crude oil per day ( per day) circulates about 80,000 cubic metres of water per hour through its cooling tower system.

The world&#x27;s tallest cooling tower is the tall cooling tower of the Pingshan II Power Station in Huaibei, Anhui Province, China.
==Classification by build==

=== Package type ===

These types of cooling towers are factory preassembled, and can be simply transported on trucks, as they are compact machines. The capacity of package type towers is limited and, for that reason, they are usually preferred by facilities with low heat rejection requirements such as food processing plants, textile plants, some chemical processing plants, or buildings like hospitals, hotels, malls, automotive factories, etc.

Due to their frequent use in or near residential areas, sound level control is a relatively more important issue for package type cooling towers.

=== Field-erected type ===
Facilities such as power plants, steel processing plants, petroleum refineries, or petrochemical plants usually install field-erected type cooling towers due to their greater capacity for heat rejection. Field-erected towers are usually much larger in size compared to the package type cooling towers.

A typical field-erected cooling tower has a pultruded fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) structure, FRP cladding, a mechanical unit for air draft, and a drift eliminator.

==Heat transfer methods==

With respect to the heat transfer mechanism employed, the main types are:
* Wet cooling towers or open-circuit Cooling Tower or evaporative cooling towers operate on the principle of evaporative cooling. The working coolant (usually water) is the evaporated fluid, and is exposed to the elements.
* Closed circuit cooling towers (also called fluid coolers) pass the working coolant through a large heat exchanger, usually a radiator, upon which clean water is sprayed and a fan-induced draft applied. The resulting heat transfer performance is close to that of a wet cooling tower, with the advantage of protecting the working fluid from environmental exposure and contamination. 
* Adiabatic cooling towers spray water into the incoming air or onto a cardboard pad to cool the air before it passes over an air-cooled heat exchanger. Adiabatic cooling towers use less water than other cooling towers but do not cool the fluid as close to the wet bulb temperature. Most adiabatic cooling towers are also hybrid cooling towers.
* Dry cooling towers (or dry coolers) are closed circuit cooling towers which operate by heat transfer through a heat exchanger that separates the working coolant from ambient air, such as in a radiator, utilizing convective heat transfer. They do not use evaporation and are air-cooled heat exchangers.
*Hybrid cooling towers or wet-dry cooling towers are closed circuit cooling towers that can switch between wet or adiabatic and dry operation. This helps balance water and energy savings across a variety of weather conditions. Some hybrid cooling towers can switch between dry, wet, and adiabatic modes. Thermal efficiencies up to 92% have been observed in hybrid cooling towers.

In a wet cooling tower (or open circuit cooling tower), the warm water can be cooled to a temperature &quot;lower&quot; than the ambient air dry-bulb temperature, if the air is relatively dry (see dew point and psychrometrics). As ambient air is drawn past a flow of water, a small portion of the water evaporates, and the energy required to evaporate that portion of the water is taken from the remaining mass of water, thus reducing its temperature. Approximately of heat energy is absorbed for the evaporated water. Evaporation results in saturated air conditions, lowering the temperature of the water processed by the tower to a value close to wet-bulb temperature, which is lower than the ambient dry-bulb temperature, the difference determined by the initial humidity of the ambient air.

To achieve better performance (more cooling), a medium called &quot;fill&quot; is used to increase the surface area and the time of contact between the air and water flows. &quot;Splash fill&quot; consists of material placed to interrupt the water flow causing splashing. &quot;Film fill&quot; is composed of thin sheets of material (usually PVC) upon which the water flows. Both methods create increased surface area and time of contact between the fluid (water) and the gas (air), to improve heat transfer.

==Air flow generation methods==
With respect to drawing air through the tower, there are three types of cooling towers:
* Natural draftUtilizes buoyancy via a tall chimney. Warm, moist air &quot;naturally&quot; rises due to the density differential compared to the dry, cooler outside air. Warm moist air is less dense than drier air at the same pressure. This moist air buoyancy produces an upwards current of air through the tower.
* Mechanical draftUses power-driven fan motors to force or draw air through the tower.
** Induced draftA mechanical draft tower with a fan at the discharge (at the top) which pulls air up through the tower. The fan &quot;induces&quot; hot moist air out the discharge. This produces low entering and high exiting air velocities, reducing the possibility of &quot;recirculation&quot; in which discharged air flows back into the air intake. This fan/fin arrangement is also known as &quot;draw-through&quot;. 
** Forced draftA mechanical draft tower with a blower type fan at the intake. The fan &quot;forces&quot; air into the tower, creating high entering and low exiting air velocities. The low exiting velocity is much more susceptible to recirculation. With the fan on the air intake, the fan is more susceptible to complications due to freezing conditions. Another disadvantage is that a forced draft design typically requires more motor horsepower than an equivalent induced draft design. The benefit of the forced draft design is its ability to work with high static pressure. Such setups can be installed in more-confined spaces and even in some indoor situations. This fan/fin geometry is also known as &quot;blow-through&quot;.
* Fan assisted natural draftA hybrid type that appears like a natural draft setup, though airflow is assisted by a fan.

===Hyperboloid cooling tower===
On 16 August 1916, Frederik van Iterson took out the UK patent (108,863) for &quot;Improved Construction of Cooling Towers of Reinforced Concrete&quot;. The patent was filed on 9 August 1917, and published on 11 April 1918. In 1918, DSM built the first hyperboloid natural-draft cooling tower at the Staatsmijn Emma, to his design.

Hyperboloid (sometimes incorrectly known as hyperbolic) cooling towers have become the design standard for all natural-draft cooling towers because of their structural strength and minimum usage of material. The hyperboloid shape also aids in accelerating the upward convective air flow, improving cooling efficiency. These designs are popularly associated with nuclear power plants. However, this association is misleading, as the same kind of cooling towers are often used at large coal-fired power plants and some geothermal plants as well. The steam turbine is what necessitates the cooling tower. Conversely, not all nuclear power plants have cooling towers, and some instead cool their working fluid with lake, river or ocean water.

==Categorization by air-to-water flow==

===Crossflow===
Typically lower initial and long-term cost, mostly due to pump requirements.
Crossflow is a design in which the airflow is directed perpendicular to the water flow (see diagram at left). Airflow enters one or more vertical faces of the cooling tower to meet the fill material. Water flows (perpendicular to the air) through the fill by gravity. The air continues through the fill and thus past the water flow into an open plenum volume. Lastly, a fan forces the air out into the atmosphere.

A &quot;distribution&quot; or &quot;hot water basin&quot; consisting of a deep pan with holes or &quot;nozzles&quot; in its bottom is located near the top of a crossflow tower. Gravity distributes the water through the nozzles uniformly across the fill material. Cross Flow V/s Counter Flow

Advantages of the crossflow design:
* Gravity water distribution allows smaller pumps and maintenance while in use.
* Non-pressurized spray simplifies variable flow.

Disadvantages of the crossflow design:
* More prone to freezing than counterflow designs.
* Variable flow is useless in some conditions.
* More prone to dirt buildup in the fill than counterflow designs, especially in dusty or sandy areas.

===Counterflow===

In a counterflow design, the air flow is directly opposite to the water flow (see diagram at left). Air flow first enters an open area beneath the fill media, and is then drawn up vertically. The water is sprayed through pressurized nozzles near the top of the tower, and then flows downward through the fill, opposite to the air flow.
Advantages of the counterflow design:
* Spray water distribution makes the tower more freeze-resistant.
* Breakup of water in spray makes heat transfer more efficient.

Disadvantages of the counterflow design:
* Typically higher initial and long-term cost, primarily due to pump requirements.
* Difficult to use variable water flow, as spray characteristics may be negatively affected.
* Typically noisier, due to the greater water fall height from the bottom of the fill into the cold water basin

===Common aspects===
Common aspects of both designs:
*The interactions of the air and water flow allow a partial equalization of temperature, and evaporation of water.
*The air, now saturated with water vapor, is discharged from the top of the cooling tower.
*A &quot;collection basin&quot; or &quot;cold water basin&quot; is used to collect and contain the cooled water after its interaction with the air flow.

Both crossflow and counterflow designs can be used in natural draft and in mechanical draft cooling towers.

==Wet cooling tower material balance==

Quantitatively, the material balance around a wet, evaporative cooling tower system is governed by the operational variables of make-up volumetric flow rate, evaporation and windage losses, draw-off rate, and the concentration cycles.

In the adjacent diagram, water pumped from the tower basin is the cooling water routed through the process coolers and condensers in an industrial facility. The cool water absorbs heat from the hot process streams which need to be cooled or condensed, and the absorbed heat warms the circulating water (C). The warm water returns to the top of the cooling tower and trickles downward over the fill material inside the tower. As it trickles down, it contacts ambient air rising up through the tower either by natural draft or by forced draft using large fans in the tower. That contact causes a small amount of the water to be lost as windage or drift (W) and some of the water (E) to evaporate. The heat required to evaporate the water is derived from the water itself, which cools the water back to the original basin water temperature and the water is then ready to recirculate. The evaporated water leaves its dissolved salts behind in the bulk of the water which has not been evaporated, thus raising the salt concentration in the circulating cooling water. To prevent the salt concentration of the water from becoming too high, a portion of the water is drawn off or blown down (D) for disposal. Fresh water make-up (M) is supplied to the tower basin to compensate for the loss of evaporated water, the windage loss water and the draw-off water.

Using these flow rates and concentration dimensional units:
A water balance around the entire system is then:

Since the evaporated water (E) has no salts, a chloride balance around the system is:
:formula_1

and, therefore:

:formula_2

From a simplified heat balance around the cooling tower:

:formula_3

Windage (or drift) losses (W) is the amount of total tower water flow that is entrained in the flow of air to the atmosphere. From large-scale industrial cooling towers, in the absence of manufacturer&#x27;s data, it may be assumed to be:

:W = 0.3 to 1.0 percent of C for a natural draft cooling tower without windage drift eliminators
:W = 0.1 to 0.3 percent of C for an induced draft cooling tower without windage drift eliminators
:W = about 0.005 percent of C (or less) if the cooling tower has windage drift eliminators
:W = about 0.0005 percent of C (or less) if the cooling tower has windage drift eliminators and uses sea water as make-up water.

===Cycles of concentration===
Cycle of concentration represents the accumulation of dissolved minerals in the recirculating cooling water. Discharge of draw-off (or blowdown) is used principally to control the buildup of these minerals.

The chemistry of the make-up water, including the amount of dissolved minerals, can vary widely. Make-up waters low in dissolved minerals such as those from surface water supplies (lakes, rivers etc.) tend to be aggressive to metals (corrosive). Make-up waters from ground water supplies (such as wells) are usually higher in minerals, and tend to be scaling (deposit minerals). Increasing the amount of minerals present in the water by cycling can make water less aggressive to piping; however, excessive levels of minerals can cause scaling problems.

 As the cycles of concentration increase, the water may not be able to hold the minerals in solution. When the solubility of these minerals have been exceeded they can precipitate out as mineral solids and cause fouling and heat exchange problems in the cooling tower or the heat exchangers. The temperatures of the recirculating water, piping and heat exchange surfaces determine if and where minerals will precipitate from the recirculating water. Often a professional water treatment consultant will evaluate the make-up water and the operating conditions of the cooling tower and recommend an appropriate range for the cycles of concentration. The use of water treatment chemicals, pretreatment such as water softening, pH adjustment, and other techniques can affect the acceptable range of cycles of concentration.

Concentration cycles in the majority of cooling towers usually range from 3 to 7. In the United States, many water supplies use well water which has significant levels of dissolved solids. On the other hand, one of the largest water supplies, for New York City, has a surface rainwater source quite low in minerals; thus cooling towers in that city are often allowed to concentrate to 7 or more cycles of concentration.

Since higher cycles of concentration represent less make-up water, water conservation efforts may focus on increasing cycles of concentration. Highly treated recycled water may be an effective means of reducing cooling tower consumption of potable water, in regions where potable water is scarce.

==Maintenance==
Clean visible dirt &amp; debris from the cold water basin and surfaces with any visible biofilm (i.e., slime).

Disinfectant and other chemical levels in cooling towers and hot tubs should be continuously maintained and regularly monitored.

Regular checks of water quality (specifically the aerobic bacteria levels) using dipslides should be taken as the presence of other organisms can support legionella by producing the organic nutrients that it needs to thrive.

===Water treatment===

Besides treating the circulating cooling water in large industrial cooling tower systems to minimize scaling and fouling, the water should be filtered to remove particulates, and also be dosed with biocides and algaecides to prevent growths that could interfere with the continuous flow of the water. Under certain conditions, a biofilm of micro-organisms such as bacteria, fungi and algae can grow very rapidly in the cooling water, and can reduce the heat transfer efficiency of the cooling tower. Biofilm can be reduced or prevented by using sodium chlorite or other chlorine based chemicals. A normal industrial practice is to use two biocides, such as oxidizing and non-oxidizing types to complement each other&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses, and to ensure a broader spectrum of attack. In most cases, a continual low level oxidizing biocide is used, then alternating to a periodic shock dose of non-oxidizing biocides.

==== Algaecides and biocides ====
Algaecides, as their name might suggest, is intended to kill algae and other related plant-like microbes in the water. Biocides can reduce other living matter that remains, improving the system and keeping clean and efficient water usage in a cooling tower. One of the most common options when it comes to biocides for your water is bromine.

==== Scale inhibitors ====
Among the issues that cause the most damage and strain to a water tower&#x27;s systems is scaling. When an unwanted material or contaminant in the water builds up in a certain area, it can create deposits that grow over time. This can cause issues ranging from the narrowing of pipes to total blockages and equipment failures.

The water consumption of the cooling tower comes from Drift, Bleed-off, Evaporation loss, The water that is immediately replenished into the cooling tower due to loss is called Make-up Water. The function of make-up water is to make machinery and equipment run safely and stably.

====Legionnaires&#x27; disease====

Another very important reason for using biocides in cooling towers is to prevent the growth of &quot;Legionella&quot;, including species that cause legionellosis or Legionnaires&#x27; disease, most notably &quot;L. pneumophila&quot;, or &quot;Mycobacterium avium&quot;. The various &quot;Legionella&quot; species are the cause of Legionnaires&#x27; disease in humans and transmission is via exposure to aerosols—the inhalation of mist droplets containing the bacteria. Common sources of &quot;Legionella&quot; include cooling towers used in open recirculating evaporative cooling water systems, domestic hot water systems, fountains, and similar disseminators that tap into a public water supply. Natural sources include freshwater ponds and creeks.

French researchers found that &quot;Legionella&quot; bacteria travelled up to through the air from a large contaminated cooling tower at a petrochemical plant in Pas-de-Calais, France. That outbreak killed 21 of the 86 people who had a laboratory-confirmed infection.

Drift (or windage) is the term for water droplets of the process flow allowed to escape in the cooling tower discharge. Drift eliminators are used in order to hold drift rates typically to 0.001–0.005% of the circulating flow rate. A typical drift eliminator provides multiple directional changes of airflow to prevent the escape of water droplets. A well-designed and well-fitted drift eliminator can greatly reduce water loss and potential for &quot;Legionella&quot; or water treatment chemical exposure. Also, about every six months, inspect the conditions of the drift eliminators making sure there are no gaps to allow the free flow of dirt.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend that health-care facilities regularly test for the &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot; bacteria. Scheduled microbiologic monitoring for &quot;Legionella&quot; remains controversial because its presence is not necessarily evidence of a potential for causing disease. The CDC recommends aggressive disinfection measures for cleaning and maintaining devices known to transmit &quot;Legionella&quot;, but does not recommend regularly-scheduled microbiologic assays for the bacteria. However, scheduled monitoring of potable water within a hospital might be considered in certain settings where persons are highly susceptible to illness and mortality from &quot;Legionella&quot; infection (e.g. hematopoietic stem cell transplantation units, or solid organ transplant units). Also, after an outbreak of legionellosis, health officials agree that monitoring is necessary to identify the source and to evaluate the efficacy of biocides or other prevention measures.

Studies have found &quot;Legionella&quot; in 40% to 60% of cooling towers.

==Terminology==


*Windage or DriftWater droplets that are carried out of the cooling tower with the exhaust air. Drift droplets have the same concentration of impurities as the water entering the tower. The drift rate is typically reduced by employing baffle-like devices, called drift eliminators, through which the air must travel after leaving the fill and spray zones of the tower. Drift can also be reduced by using warmer entering cooling tower temperatures.

*Blow-outWater droplets blown out of the cooling tower by wind, generally at the air inlet openings. Water may also be lost, in the absence of wind, through splashing or misting. Devices such as wind screens, louvers, splash deflectors and water diverters are used to limit these losses.

*PlumeThe stream of saturated exhaust air leaving the cooling tower. The plume is visible when water vapor it contains condenses in contact with cooler ambient air, like the saturated air in one&#x27;s breath fogs on a cold day. Under certain conditions, a cooling tower plume may present fogging or icing hazards to its surroundings. Note that the water evaporated in the cooling process is &quot;pure&quot; water, in contrast to the very small percentage of drift droplets or water blown out of the air inlets.

*Draw-off or blow-downThe portion of the circulating water flow that is removed (usually discharged to a drain) in order to maintain the amount of total dissolved solids (TDS) and other impurities at an acceptably low level. Higher TDS concentration in solution may result from greater cooling tower efficiency. However the higher the TDS concentration, the greater the risk of scale, biological growth, and corrosion. The amount of blow-down is primarily regulated by measuring by the electrical conductivity of the circulating water. Biological growth, scaling, and corrosion can be prevented by chemicals (respectively, biocide, sulfuric acid, corrosion inhibitor). On the other hand, the only practical way to decrease the electrical conductivity is by increasing the amount of blow-down discharge and subsequently increasing the amount of clean make-up water.

* Zero bleed for cooling towers, also called zero blow-down for cooling towers, is a process for significantly reducing the need for bleeding water with residual solids from the system by enabling the water to hold more solids in solution.

*Make-upThe water that must be added to the circulating water system in order to compensate for water losses such as evaporation, drift loss, blow-out, blow-down, etc.

*NoiseSound energy emitted by a cooling tower and heard (recorded) at a given distance and direction. The sound is generated by the impact of falling water, by the movement of air by fans, the fan blades moving in the structure, vibration of the structure, and the motors, gearboxes or drive belts.

*ApproachThe approach is the difference in temperature between the cooled-water temperature and the entering-air wet bulb temperature (twb). Since the cooling towers are based on the principles of evaporative cooling, the maximum cooling tower efficiency depends on the wet bulb temperature of the air. The wet-bulb temperature is a type of temperature measurement that reflects the physical properties of a system with a mixture of a gas and a vapor, usually air and water vapor

*RangeThe range is the temperature difference between the warm water inlet and cooled water exit.

*FillInside the tower, fills are added to increase contact surface as well as contact time between air and water, to provide better heat transfer. The efficiency of the tower depends on the selection and amount of fill. There are two types of fills that may be used:
**Film type fill (causes water to spread into a thin film)
**Splash type fill (breaks up falling stream of water and interrupts its vertical progress)

*Full-flow filtrationFull-flow filtration continuously strains particulates out of the entire system flow. For example, in a 100-ton system, the flow rate would be roughly 300 gal/min. A filter would be selected to accommodate the entire 300 gal/min flow rate. In this case, the filter typically is installed after the cooling tower on the discharge side of the pump. While this is the ideal method of filtration, for higher flow systems it may be cost-prohibitive.

*Side-stream filtrationSide-stream filtration, although popular and effective, does not provide complete protection. With side-stream filtration, a portion of the water is filtered continuously. This method works on the principle that continuous particle removal will keep the system clean. Manufacturers typically package side-stream filters on a skid, complete with a pump and controls. For high flow systems, this method is cost-effective. Properly sizing a side-stream filtration system is critical to obtain satisfactory filter performance, but there is some debate over how to properly size the side-stream system. Many engineers size the system to continuously filter the cooling tower basin water at a rate equivalent to 10% of the total circulation flow rate. For example, if the total flow of a system is 1,200 gal/min (a 400-ton system), a 120 gal/min side-stream system is specified.

*Cycle of concentrationMaximum allowed multiplier for the amount of miscellaneous substances in circulating water compared to the amount of those substances in make-up water.

*Treated timberA structural material for cooling towers which was largely abandoned in the early 2000s. It is still used occasionally due to its low initial costs, in spite of its short life expectancy. The life of treated timber varies a lot, depending on the operating conditions of the tower, such as frequency of shutdowns, treatment of the circulating water, etc. Under proper working conditions, the estimated life of treated timber structural members is about 10 years.

*LeachingThe loss of wood preservative chemicals by the washing action of the water flowing through a wood structure cooling tower.

*Pultruded FRPA common structural material for smaller cooling towers, fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) is known for its high corrosion-resistance capabilities. Pultruded FRP is produced using pultrusion technology, and has become the most common structural material for small cooling towers. It offers lower costs and requires less maintenance compared to reinforced concrete, which is still in use for large structures.

==Fog production==

Under certain ambient conditions, plumes of water vapor can be seen rising out of the discharge from a cooling tower, and can be mistaken as smoke from a fire. If the outdoor air is at or near saturation, and the tower adds more water to the air, saturated air with liquid water droplets can be discharged, which is seen as fog. This phenomenon typically occurs on cool, humid days, but is rare in many climates. Fog and clouds associated with cooling towers can be described as homogenitus, as with other clouds of man-made origin, such as contrails and ship tracks.

This phenomenon can be prevented by decreasing the relative humidity of the saturated discharge air. For that purpose, in hybrid towers, saturated discharge air is mixed with heated low relative humidity air. Some air enters the tower above drift eliminator level, passing through heat exchangers. The relative humidity of the dry air is even more decreased instantly as being heated while entering the tower. The discharged mixture has a relatively lower relative humidity and the fog is invisible.

== Cloud formation ==
Issues related to applied meteorology of cooling towers, including the assessment of the impact of cooling towers on cloud enhancement were considered in a series of models and experiments. One of the results by Haman&#x27;s group indicated significant dynamic influences of the condensation trails on the surrounding atmosphere, manifested in temperature and humidity disturbances. The mechanism of these influences seemed to be associated either with the airflow over the trail as an obstacle or with vertical waves generated by the trail, often at a considerable altitude above it.

==Salt emission pollution==
When wet cooling towers with seawater make-up are installed in various industries located in or near coastal areas, the drift of fine droplets emitted from the cooling towers contain nearly 6% sodium chloride which deposits on the nearby land areas. This deposition of sodium salts on the nearby agriculture and vegetative lands can convert them into sodic saline or sodic alkaline soils depending on the nature of the soil and enhance the sodicity of ground and surface water. The salt deposition problem from such cooling towers aggravates where pollution control standards are not imposed or not implemented to minimize the drift emissions from wet cooling towers using seawater make-up.

Respirable suspended particulate matter, of less than 10 micrometers (μm) in size, can be present in the drift from cooling towers. Larger particles above 10 μm in size are generally filtered out in the nose and throat via cilia and mucus but particulate matter smaller than 10 μm, referred to as PM10, can settle in the bronchi and lungs and cause health problems. Similarly, particles smaller than 2.5 μm, (PM2.5), tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung, and very small particles (less than 100 nanometers) may pass through the lungs to affect other organs. Though the total particulate emissions from wet cooling towers with fresh water make-up is much less, they contain more PM10 and PM2.5 than the total emissions from wet cooling towers with sea water make-up. This is due to lesser salt content in fresh water drift (below 2,000 ppm) compared to the salt content of sea water drift (60,000 ppm).

==Use as a flue-gas stack==
At some modern power stations equipped with flue gas purification, such as the Großkrotzenburg Power Station and the Rostock Power Station, the cooling tower is also used as a flue-gas stack (industrial chimney), thus saving the cost of a separate chimney structure. At plants without flue gas purification, problems with corrosion may occur, due to reactions of raw flue gas with water to form acids.

Sometimes, natural draft cooling towers are constructed with structural steel in place of concrete (RCC) when the construction time of natural draft cooling tower is exceeding the construction time of the rest of the plant or the local soil is of poor strength to bear the heavy weight of RCC cooling towers or cement prices are higher at a site to opt for cheaper natural draft cooling towers made of structural steel.

==Operation in freezing weather==
Some cooling towers (such as smaller building air conditioning systems) are shut down seasonally, drained, and winterized to prevent freeze damage.

During the winter, other sites continuously operate cooling towers with water leaving the tower. Basin heaters, tower draindown, and other freeze protection methods are often employed in cold climates. Operational cooling towers with malfunctions can freeze during very cold weather. Typically, freezing starts at the corners of a cooling tower with a reduced or absent heat load. Severe freezing conditions can create growing volumes of ice, resulting in increased structural loads which can cause structural damage or collapse.

To prevent freezing, the following procedures are used:
* The use of water modulating by-pass systems is not recommended during freezing weather. In such situations, the control flexibility of variable speed motors, two-speed motors, and/or two-speed motors multi-cell towers should be considered a requirement.
* Do not operate the tower unattended. Remote sensors and alarms may be installed to monitor tower conditions.
* Do not operate the tower without a heat load. Basin heaters may be used to keep the water in the tower pan at an above-freezing temperature. Heat trace (&quot;heating tape&quot;) is a resistive heating element that is installed along water pipes to prevent freezing in cold climates.
* Maintain design water flow rate over the tower fill.
* Manipulate or reduce airflow to maintain water temperature above freezing point.

==Fire hazard==
Cooling towers constructed in whole or in part of combustible materials can support internal fire propagation. Such fires can become very intense, due to the high surface-volume ratio of the towers, and fires can be further intensified by natural convection or fan-assisted draft. The resulting damage can be sufficiently severe to require the replacement of the entire cell or tower structure. For this reason, some codes and standards recommend that combustible cooling towers be provided with an automatic fire sprinkler system. Fires can propagate internally within the tower structure when the cell is not in operation (such as for maintenance or construction), and even while the tower is in operation, especially those of the induced-draft type, because of the existence of relatively dry areas within the towers.

==Structural stability==
Being very large structures, cooling towers are susceptible to wind damage, and several spectacular failures have occurred in the past. At Ferrybridge power station on 1 November 1965, the station was the site of a major structural failure, when three of the cooling towers collapsed owing to vibrations in winds. Although the structures had been built to withstand higher wind speeds, the shape of the cooling towers caused westerly winds to be funneled into the towers themselves, creating a vortex. Three out of the original eight cooling towers were destroyed, and the remaining five were severely damaged. The towers were later rebuilt and all eight cooling towers were strengthened to tolerate adverse weather conditions. Building codes were changed to include improved structural support, and wind tunnel tests were introduced to check tower structures and configuration.

<text>The United States Senate Committee on Finance (or, less formally, Senate Finance Committee) is a standing committee of the United States Senate. The committee concerns itself with matters relating to taxation and other revenue measures generally, and those relating to the insular possessions; bonded debt of the United States; customs, collection districts, and ports of entry and delivery; deposit of public moneys; general revenue sharing; health programs under the Social Security Act (notably Medicare and Medicaid) and health programs financed by a specific tax or trust fund; national social security; reciprocal trade agreements; tariff and import quotas, and related matters thereto; and the transportation of dutiable goods. It is considered to be one of the most powerful committees in Congress.

==History==

The Committee on Finance is one of the original committees established in the Senate. First created on December 11, 1815, as a select committee and known as the Committee on Finance and an [sic] Uniform National Currency, it was formed to alleviate economic issues arising from the War of 1812. On December 10, 1816, the Senate officially created the Committee on Finance as a standing committee. Originally, the committee had power over tariffs, taxation, banking and currency issues and appropriations. Under this authority the committee played an influential role in the most heated topics of the era, including numerous tariff issues and the Bank War. The committee was also influential in the creation of the Department of Interior in 1849. Under the chairmanship of William Pitt Fessenden, the committee played a decisive role during the Civil War. Appropriating all funds for the war effort as well as raising enough funds to finance the war through tariffs and the nation&#x27;s first income tax. Additionally, the committee produced the Legal Tender Act of 1862, the nation&#x27;s first reliance on paper currency.

In 1865 the House of Representatives created an Appropriations Committee to relieve the burden from the Committee on Ways and Means. The Senate followed this example by forming the Senate Appropriations Committee in 1867.

Despite the loss of one of its signature duties, the committee continued to play a prominent role in the major issues of the nation. The committee was at the center of the debate over the silver question in the latter half of the 19th Century. Passage of the Bland–Allison Act and the Sherman Silver Purchase Act were attempts to remedy the demand for silver, though the silver cause would eventually fail by the end of the century. The committee also continued to play a role in the debate over income taxes. The repeal of the Civil War income taxes in the 1870s would eventually be raised in 1894 with the passage of a new income tax law. The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in ruled the income tax as unconstitutional, since it was not based on apportionment. The fight for an income tax finally culminated with the Payne–Aldrich Tariff Act of 1909. In order to pass the new tariff Senate leaders, including Chairman Nelson Aldrich, allowed for a Constitutional Amendment to be passed. Four years later the 16th Amendment was officially ratified and in 1913 the nation&#x27;s first peacetime income tax was instituted.

Around that same time the committee lost jurisdiction over banking and currency issues to the newly created Committee on Banking and Currency. The committee did gain jurisdiction over veterans’ benefits when it successfully passed the War Risk Insurance Act of 1917. The act shifted pensions from gratuities to benefits and served as one of the first life insurance programs created under the federal government.

The Finance Committee continued to play an increasingly important role in the lives of the nation&#x27;s veterans. The committee helped consolidate the veteran bureaucracy by streamlining the various responsibilities into a Veterans&#x27; Bureau, which would ultimately become the Veterans&#x27; Administration. In 1924, the committee passed a &quot;Bonus Bill&quot; that compensated World War I veterans for their service. This series of improved veteran benefits reached a crescendo in 1944 with the passage of the Servicemen&#x27;s Readjustment Act. Senator Bennett &quot;Champ&quot; Clark, who served as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Veterans, assured smooth sailing of the bill through the Senate. The bill not only ended the usual demands from returning veterans that had been seen in nearly every war the US had participated in, but also provided more generous benefits than veterans had previously received, including funds for continuing education, loans and unemployment insurance.

Not all Finance Committee legislation was as well received as the G.I. Bill. At the beginning of the Great Depression the committee passed the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act. The act greatly increased tariffs and had a negative effect on the nation&#x27;s economy. Following traditional economic practices the members of the committee, including Chairman Reed Smoot, felt that protection of American businesses was required in order to buoy them during the dire economic times. The effort backfired and the economic situation worsened. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff would eventually be replaced by the Reciprocal Tariff Act of 1934 which authorized the president to negotiate trade agreements. This act not only set up the trade policy system as it exists today but also effectively transferred trade making policy from the Congress to the president.

The committee also played an important role in two major acts created under the New Deal. The committee received jurisdiction over the National Industrial Recovery Act because of tax code changes in the bill. The new bureaucracy was President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s attempt to stimulate the economy and promote jobs for unemployed Americans while also regulating businesses. The National Recovery Administration would ultimately fail as it lost public support, but the act served as a springboard for the Wagner Act and the National Labor Board.

Probably the largest and most lasting pieces of legislation shaped by the Finance Committee during the New Deal was the 1935 Social Security Act. Once again, the committee received jurisdiction owing to the payroll taxes that would be enacted to pay for the new program. The act was the first effort by the federal government to provide benefits to the elderly and the unemployed, leading to enhanced economic welfare for many elderly Americans.

In 1981, a Senate Resolution required the printing of the history of the Committee on Finance.

==Role==
The role of the Senate Committee on Finance is very similar to that of the House Committee on Ways and Means. The one exception in terms of authority is that the Finance Committee has jurisdiction over both Medicare and Medicaid, while the House Ways and Means Committee only has jurisdiction over Medicare. (The House Energy and Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over Medicaid.) The other difference in terms of power is that all revenue raising measures must originate in the House, giving the Ways and Means Committee a slight edge in setting tax policy.

In addition to having jurisdiction over legislation, the Committee on Finance has extensive oversight powers. It has authority to investigate, review and evaluate existing laws, and the agencies that implement them.

==Jurisdiction==
In accordance of Rule XXV of the United States Senate, all proposed legislation, messages, petitions, memorials, and other matters relating to the following subjects are referred to the Senate Committee on Finance:
# Bonded debt of the United States, except as provided in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974;
# Customs, collection districts, and ports of entry and delivery;
# Deposit of public moneys;
# General revenue sharing;
# Health programs under the Social Security Act and health programs financed by a specific tax or trust fund;
# National social security;
# Reciprocal trade agreements;
# Revenue measures generally, except as provided in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974;
# Revenue measures relating to the insular possessions;
# Tariffs and import quotas, and matters related thereto; and,
# Transportation of dutiable goods.

Given its broad remit with regards to taxation, mandatory spending, international trade, Social Security, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, interest on the national debt, and healthcare finance—including Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program—the Senate Committee on Finance is arguably one of the most influential standing committees in either house of Congress. A wide array of senators with differing policy interests seek membership on the committee due to its broad role in setting fiscal, tax, trade, health, and social policy.

<doc id="750798" wikidata="Q2306874" url="?curid=750798" title="Wonderful Town">
<text>Wonderful Town is a 1953 musical with book written by Joseph A. Fields and Jerome Chodorov, lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and music by Leonard Bernstein. The musical tells the story of two sisters who aspire to be a writer and actress respectively, seeking success from their basement apartment in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village. It is based on Fields and Chodorov&#x27;s 1940 play &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot;, which in turn originated from autobiographical short stories by Ruth McKenney first published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in the late 1930s and later published in book form as &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot;. Only the last two stories in McKenney&#x27;s book were used, and they were heavily modified.

After a pre-Broadway try-out at the Forrest Theatre in Philadelphia, &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; premiered on Broadway in 1953, starring Rosalind Russell in the role of Ruth Sherwood, Edie Adams as Eileen Sherwood, and George Gaynes as Robert Baker. It won five Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Actress, and spawned three New York City Center productions between 1958 and 1966, the 1955 and 1986 West End production and 2003 Broadway revival. It is a lighter piece than Bernstein&#x27;s later works, &quot;West Side Story&quot; and &quot;Candide&quot;, but none of the songs have become as popular.

==Synopsis==
;Act I
During the summer of 1935 in Greenwich Village, New York, a tour guide leads a group of sightseers on a tour of &quot;Christopher Street&quot; and its colorful residents. 

When the tourists have departed, the witty Ruth Sherwood arrives in Greenwich Village with Eileen, her younger sister.
The two have just arrived from Columbus, Ohio, determined to forge a life in New York City as a writer (Ruth) and an actress (Eileen).
Soon they are living in a basement apartment, recently vacated by Violet.
Their landlord is Mr. Appopoulos.
Their apartment building is shaken frequently by dynamite from the construction of a subway underneath them and they are disturbed by Violet&#x27;s returning customers.
The sisters are soon stricken with homesickness for &quot;Ohio&quot;.

The next morning, Ruth and Eileen set out to try their hand at &quot;Conquering New York&quot;, only to find defeat and humiliation.
Eileen, at least, has gotten food from a food samples man, as well as Mr. Valenti, but has also met Frank Lippencott, a local Walgreens manager who has developed a crush on her.
Ruth, however, is left to wonder at her sister&#x27;s magnetic appeal and her own unique romantic abilities — a talent for repelling men that is so successful that she could write a book entitled &quot;One Hundred Easy Ways to Lose a Man.&quot;

Eventually, Ruth talks her way into the offices of a short story magazine, where she meets Bob Baker.
Bob likes Ruth, but advises her that she has little chance of success, and tells her flat out what a waste of money and time it was to come to New York City, because he along with many others have done the same thing (&quot;What a Waste&quot;).
Undaunted, Ruth leaves three stories with Bob in the hope that he will read them.

Meanwhile, Eileen has been eating all of her lunches free at Walgreens, and finds herself infatuated with Frank (&quot;A Little Bit in Love&quot;), and invites him over to dinner so Ruth can have free lunches when she goes to Walgreens, too.
Bob arrives at the apartment, looking for Ruth, and Eileen invites him over for dinner as well.
The phone rings, and it is Chick Clark, a newspaper editor, whom Eileen met in an elevator, wanting to see Eileen.

The upstairs neighbors, Wreck, an out-of-season American football player (&quot;Pass the Football&quot;), and his live-in lover, Helen, ask the girls to hide Wreck while Helen&#x27;s mother, Mrs. Ella Wade is in town, because Mrs. Wade does not yet know about Wreck.
Eileen happily agrees to stow him in their apartment, much to Ruth&#x27;s hesitation.
Wreck describes his lucky history as a student at Trenton Tech, who got by very well only because of his ability with football.

Eileen has invited Frank Lippencott, Bob Baker, and Chick Clark, a slimy newspaper scribe whom she has met with the object of furthering Ruth&#x27;s career, over for potluck supper.
Unaware of each other&#x27;s feelings, both women find themselves attracted to Bob.
Soon, all five of them are seated around the cramped apartment trying to fill the awkward silence (&quot;Conversation Piece&quot;).
Meanwhile, Helen deals with her overbearing and exaggerated mother.

Ruth and Bob talk over the quality of her stories, and he advises her to write about what she knows rather than flights of fancy.
Both say several wrong things, and he finally tells her off.
He soon regrets it as Ruth rushes inside in tears (&quot;A Quiet Girl&quot;).

While all this is happening, anxious to be alone with Eileen, Chick Clark creates a bogus assignment for Ruth.
He sends her off to the Brooklyn Navy Yard to interview a group of Brazilian navy cadets.
She quickly realizes that their sole interest is to learn and dance the &quot;Conga!&quot;. 
The sailors follow Ruth home, where the girls soon find themselves in chaotic confusion, as all the citizens of Christopher Street join the conga line in a finale.
Ruth runs into Bob and gives him a piece of her mind, while Eileen is hauled off to jail for causing the riot.

;Act II
In the local jail Eileen finds herself practically running the place, with Officer Lonigan and his brigade of doting Irish police officers at her beck and call.
Given her name, they are convinced that she is Irish.
They serenade her and are not at all discouraged when she says she is not Irish (&quot;My Darlin&#x27; Eileen&quot;).
Ruth comes to assure Eileen that she will bail her out as soon as she collects the money from her new job as a promoter for the Village Vortex, a local nightclub.
At the club, Ruth digs the rhythm of swing (&quot;Wonderful Town Swing&quot;).

Meanwhile, Wreck is awkwardly masquerading as a wealthy art collector to meet the approval of Helen&#x27;s mother, and Chick is frantically calling Eileen, trying to make things right.
Thanks to Bob, Eileen is soon released from jail, and the sisters learn that Mr. Appopoulos has been so scandalized by a missing picture that he painted (that was actually stolen and sold for $2 by Helen and Wreck for Wreck to stay at the Y) as well as Eileen&#x27;s arrest that he has threatened to evict them.
Eileen discovers that Ruth is also attracted to Bob Baker, and the two of them wish, for a moment, that they had never left home (&quot;Ohio&quot; (reprise)).
Eileen is then confronted by the rhythmical Speedy Valenti, owner of the Village Vortex (the night club), who arranges for her New York City debut as a singer because her fame has reached the front page of the news.
Mr. Appopoulos immediately changes his tune now that one of his tenants has a paying job, and extends their lease.

Eileen soon learns that Bob Baker has quit his job as a result of a disagreement with his boss about Ruth&#x27;s story on the Brazilian sailors.
Eileen is thrilled that Bob quit his job and assures the unbelieving Bob that it&#x27;s love that he feels for Ruth.
Bob, faced with the facts, hesitantly realizes the truth that it is love (&quot;It&#x27;s Love&quot;).

The mood at the Vortex turns jazzy (&quot;Ballet At the Village Vortex&quot;).
Eileen finds herself with a case of stage fright and she convinces Ruth to join her on stage to sing.
Chick arrives to make amends and presents Ruth with a press pass: His boss has read her story about the Brazilian sailors and loved it, and given Ruth a job to take on the following Monday.
The Vortex is alive with singing and dancing (&quot;Wrong Note Rag&quot;), and Bob decides it is the perfect moment to let Ruth know how he feels.
The curtain closes as Eileen and the guests at the club sing &quot;It&#x27;s Love&quot; along with everyone in a finale in celebration of Ruth and Bob&#x27;s newfound affection.

==Production history==

===Original Broadway production===

Produced by Robert Fryer, the original production premiered at the Winter Garden Theatre on February 25, 1953, where it ran for 559 performances, closing on July 3, 1954. George Abbott served as director, with choreography by Donald Saddler. The original cast featured Rosalind Russell in the role of Ruth Sherwood, Edie Adams as Eileen Sherwood, and George Gaynes as Robert Baker. Carol Channing replaced Russell for the final 6 months of the run.

===Original London production===

The West End premiere opened at The Prince&#x27;s Theatre on February 25, 1955, running for 207 performances starring Pat Kirkwood as Ruth, Shani Wallis as Eileen, and Sid James as Wreck. The musical was produced by Jack Hylton with Cyril Ornadel as music director.

===1958 television production===

On November 30, 1958, CBS Television broadcast a live special of the musical, with Rosalind Russell (Ruth Sherwood), Jackie McKeever (Eileen Sherwood), Sydney Chaplin (Bob Baker), and Jordan Bentley (the Wreck).

===2003 Broadway revival===

In May 2000 City Center Encores! presented a staged concert starring Donna Murphy and Laura Benanti. With direction and choreography by Kathleen Marshall, the production was well received, eventually leading to a full revival. Again directed by Marshall, the 2003 Broadway Revival opened at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre on November 23, 2003, and closed on January 30, 2005 after 497 performances. Murphy reprised her role as Ruth, with Jennifer Westfeldt as Eileen and Gregg Edelman as Robert. Brooke Shields took over the role of Ruth beginning September 28, 2004. As had happened when Shields was a replacement for Rizzo in the Broadway revival of &quot;Grease&quot;, the cast album was re-released with Shields&#x27; voice replacing Murphy&#x27;s.

===Other productions===

A West End revival starring Maureen Lipman opened at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in August 1986 and closed March 1987.

A Non-Equity National Tour was presented by Music Theatre Associates in 2006 and 2007.

&quot;Wonderful Town&quot; premiered on May 25, 2008 at the Shaw Festival in Niagara On The Lake, Ontario.

In 2012 the Hallé Concerts Society, the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, and The Lowry, Salford Quays, mounted a joint production at the Lowry from 31 March to 21 April, with the Hallé Orchestra conducted by Sir Mark Elder. It then went on to tour the UK until 7 July. The cast included Connie Fisher, Lucy van Gasse and Michael Xavier. The production was directed by Braham Murray.

Mary Zimmerman directed the 2016 Goodman Theatre (Chicago) revival which previewed from September 10 to run September 20 to October 23: the cast included Bri Sudia (Ruth) Lauren Molina (Eileen), and Matt DeCaro (Appopoulos), the sets were designed by Todd Rosenthal. The production was staged with a 1950s - rather than 1930s - setting.

An off-West-End production was presented at Ye Olde Rose and Crown Theatre by All Star Productions in October 2016.

In Dec 2016, the Staatsoperette Dresden presents the premiere of a German version (book and lyrics translated by Roman Hinze)

<doc id="750807" wikidata="Q669137" url="?curid=750807" title="Brio (company)">
<text>Brio (stylized BRIO) is a wooden toy company founded in Sweden. The company was founded in the small town of Boalt, Scania, Götaland in 1884 by basket maker Ivar Bengtsson. For a long time the company was based in Osby, Scania, in southern Sweden. In 1908 Ivar&#x27;s three sons took the company over and gave it the name &quot;BRIO&quot;, which is an acronym for: BRöderna (&#x27;the brothers&#x27;) Ivarsson (in) Osby. In 2006 BRIO moved its headquarters to Malmö, Scania. It is best known for its wooden toy trains, sold in Europe since 1958.

==Lekoseum==

In 1984, the company started the BRIO Lekoseum (from Swedish &quot;leka&quot;, to play), a toy museum featuring the company&#x27;s products and those of other companies (such as Barbie dolls and Märklin model railways), at the headquarters in Osby. Children can play with many of the toys. Since the late summer of 2014 the museum has been run as an independent foundation, hence the official name is now only Lekoseum.

BRIO is best known for its wooden toy trains, sold in Europe since 1958. Most are non-motorized and suitable for younger children. The cars connect with magnets and are easy to manipulate; in recent years, the range has been extended with battery powered, remote control, and &#x27;intelligent track&#x27;-driven engines. BRIO licenses &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot; wooden trains in some parts of Europe, but Mattel holds the &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot; license in the United States. Many competitors, such as Whittle Shortline, make products that are compatible with BRIO.

BRIO also sells BRIO-Mec construction kits. Long, thin wooden slats with evenly spaced holes are connected together with various fasteners made of colorful plastic. Young children can build sturdy and elaborate constructions.

BRIO also sold &quot;Theodore Tugboat&quot; toys. Released were the tugboats, the Dispatcher, Benjamin Bridge, Chester the Container Ship, and Barrington and Bonavista barges. These toys were discontinued in 2000, a year before the show was cancelled.

During the 1960s BRIO manufactured dollhouses and dollhouse furniture. Some of this furniture is highly sought after by collectors as it comprises miniature replicas of items by Danish designer Arne Jacobsen. Pieces include the &#x27;egg&#x27; chair, the &#x27;series 7&#x27; chair, and the &#x27;swan&#x27; couch.

Additionally, the Alga subsidiary was one of five companies who at one time produced the physical skill game &quot;Crossbows and Catapults&quot;.

== Recent company history ==
In 1983, BRIO acquired the Swedish game manufacturer &quot;Alga&quot;, originally founded as a subsidiary of Pressbyrån in 1917.

Plantoys of Thailand had a joint venture with BRIO in 2001-2002, being present in the Brio catalogs of the time. 
In 2004, the Swedish investment company Proventus became the major shareholder of Brio with more than 40% of the votes. In the same year BRIO of Sweden moved most of its production to three factories in Guangdong Province, China.

The &quot;Financial Statement January — December 2008&quot; presented on February 17, 2009 speaks of financial problems concerning the company&#x27;s liquidity. On the 11th of March 2009 the company stated &quot;BRIO financially reconstructed — shareholders’ equity strengthened by more than SEK 300 million&quot;.

BRIO was acquired by the Ravensburger Group on January 8, 2015.

<text> (; French for , ), is the national motto of France and the Republic of Haiti, and is an example of a tripartite motto. Although it finds its origins in the French Revolution, it was then only one motto among others and was not institutionalized until the Third Republic at the end of the 19th century. Debates concerning the compatibility and order of the three terms began at the same time as the Revolution. It is also the motto of the Grand Orient and the Grande Loge de France.

==Origins during the French Revolution==
Some claim that Camille Desmoulins invented the phrase, in number 35 of &quot;Révolutions de France et de Brabant&quot;, published on 26 July 1790. However, it is not confirmed as this is only the first official mention of the phrase. Speaking of the July 1790 Fête de la Fédération festival, he described &quot;the citizen-soldiers rushing into each other&#x27;s arms, promising each other &quot;liberty, equality, fraternity.&quot;&quot; (French: &quot;les soldats-citoyens se précipiter dans les bras l’un de l’autre, en se promettant liberté, égalité, fraternité.&quot;) 

Several months later, Maximilien Robespierre popularized the phrase in his speech &quot;On the organization of the National Guard&quot; (), on 5 December 1790, article XVI, which was disseminated widely throughout France by the popular Societies.

Credit for the motto has been given also to Antoine-François Momoro (1756–1794), a Parisian printer and Hébertist organizer. During the Federalist revolts in 1793, it was altered to &quot;Unity, indivisibility of the Republic; liberty, equality, brotherhood or death&quot; (). 

In 1839, the philosopher Pierre Leroux claimed it had been an anonymous and popular creation. The historian Mona Ozouf underlines that, although &quot;Liberté&quot; and &quot;Égalité&quot; were associated as a motto during the 18th century, &quot;Fraternité&quot; wasn&#x27;t always included in it, and other terms, such as &quot;Amitié&quot; (Friendship), &quot;Charité&quot; (Charity) or &quot;Union&quot; were often added in its place.

In 1791, the emphasis upon &quot;Fraternité&quot; during the French Revolution, led Olympe de Gouges, a female journalist, to write the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen as a response. The tripartite motto was neither a creative collection, nor really institutionalized by the Revolution. As soon as 1789, other terms were used, such as &quot;&quot;la Nation, la Loi, le Roi&quot; (The Nation, The Law, The King), or &quot;Union, Force, Vertu&quot; (Union, Strength, Virtue), a slogan used beforehand by masonic lodges, or &quot;Force, Égalité, Justice&quot; (Strength, Equality, Justice), &quot;Liberté, Sûreté, Propriété&quot;&quot; (Liberty, Security, Property), etc.

In other words, &quot;liberté, égalité, fraternité&quot; was one slogan among many others. During the Jacobin revolutionary period, various mottos were used, such as &quot;liberté, unité, égalité&quot; (liberty, unity, equality); &quot;liberté, égalité, justice&quot; (liberty, equality, justice); &quot;liberté, raison, égalité&quot; (liberty, reason, equality), etc. The only solid association was that of &quot;liberté&quot; and &quot;égalité&quot;, with &quot;fraternité&quot; being ignored by the &quot;Cahiers de doléances&quot; as well as by the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.

&quot;Fraternité&quot; was only alluded to in the 1791 Constitution, as well as in Robespierre&#x27;s draft Declaration of 1793, placed under the invocation of (in that order) &quot;égalité, liberté, sûreté&quot; and &quot;propriété&quot; (equality, liberty, safety, property)—though it was used not as a motto, but as articles of declaration, as the possibility of a universal extension of the Declaration of Rights: &quot;Men of all countries are brothers, he who oppresses one nation declares himself the enemy of all.&quot; &quot;Fraternité&quot; did not figure in the August 1793 Declaration.

The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789 defined liberty in Article 4 as follows:

Equality was defined by the Declaration in terms of judicial equality and merit-based entry to government (art. 6):

 actually finds its origins in a May 1791 proposition by the &quot;Club des Cordeliers&quot;, following a speech on the Army by the Marquis de Guichardin. A British marine held prisoner on the French ship &quot;Le Marat&quot; in 1794, wrote home in letters published in 1796:

The compatibility of &quot;liberté&quot; and &quot;égalité&quot; was not in doubt in the first days of the Revolution, and the problem of the antecedence of one term on the other not lifted. Abbé Sieyès considered that only liberty ensured equality, unless equality was to be the equality of all, dominated by a despot, while liberty followed equality ensured by the rule of law. The abstract generality of law, theorized by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his 1762 book &quot;The Social Contract&quot;, thus ensured the identification of liberty to equality, liberty being negatively defined as an independence from arbitrary rule, and equality considered abstractly in its judicial form.

This identification of liberty and equality became problematic during the Jacobin period, when equality was redefined, for instance, by François-Noël Babeuf, as equality of results, and not only a judicial equality of rights. Thus, Marc Antoine Baudot considered that the French temperament was inclined towards equality than liberty, a theme which was re-used by Pierre Louis Roederer and Alexis de Tocqueville. Jacques Necker considered that an equal society could only be found on coercion.

The third term, &quot;fraternité&quot;, was the most problematic to insert in the triad, as it belonged to another sphere, that of moral obligations rather than rights, links rather than statutes, harmony rather than contract, and community rather than individuality. Various interpretations of &quot;fraternité&quot; existed. The first one, according to Mona Ozouf, was one of &quot;fraternité de rébellion&quot; (Fraternity of Rebellion), that is the union of the deputies in the &quot;Jeu de Paume Oath&quot; of June 1789, refusing the dissolution ordered by the King Louis XVI: &quot;We swear never to separate ourselves from the National Assembly, and to reassemble wherever circumstances require, until the constitution of the realm is drawn up and fixed upon solid foundations.&quot; Fraternity was thus issued from Liberty, and oriented by a common cause.

Another form of &quot;fraternité&quot; was that of the patriotic Church, which identified social links with religious links and based fraternity on Christian brotherhood. In this second sense, &quot;fraternité&quot; preceded both &quot;liberté&quot; and &quot;égalité&quot;, instead of following them as in the first sense. Thus, two senses of Fraternity: &quot;one, that followed liberty and equality, was the object of a free pact; the other preceded liberty and equality as the mark on its work of the divine craftsman.&quot;

Another hesitation concerning the compatibility of the three terms arose from the opposition between liberty and equality as individualistic values, and fraternity as the realization of a happy community, devoid of any conflicts and opposed to any form of egotism. This fusional interpretation of Fraternity opposed it to the project of individual autonomy and manifested the precedence of Fraternity on individual will.

In this sense, it was sometimes associated with death, as in &quot;Fraternité, ou la Mort!&quot; (Fraternity or Death!), excluding liberty and even equality, by establishing a strong dichotomy between those who were brothers and those who were not, in the sense of &quot;you are with me or against me&quot;, brother or foe. Louis de Saint-Just thus stigmatized Anarchasis Cloots&#x27; cosmopolitanism, declaring &quot;Cloots liked the universe, except France.&quot;

With the Thermidor and the execution of Robespierre, &quot;fraternité&quot; disappeared from the slogan, reduced to the two terms of liberty and equality, re-defined again as simple judicial equality and not as the equality upheld by the sentiment of fraternity. In 1799, the First Consul (Napoleon Bonaparte) established the motto &quot;liberté, ordre public&quot; (liberty, public order).

==19th century==
Following Napoleon&#x27;s rule, the triptych dissolved itself, as none believed it possible to conciliate individual liberty and equality of rights with equality of results and fraternity. The idea of individual sovereignty and of natural rights possessed by man before being united in the collectivity, contradicted the possibility of establishing a transparent and fraternal community. Liberals accepted liberty and equality, defining the latter as equality of rights and ignoring fraternity.

Early socialists rejected an independent conception of liberty, opposed to the social, and also despised equality, as they considered, as Fourier, that one had only to orchestrate individual discordances, to harmonize them, or they believed, as Saint-Simon, that equality contradicted equity, by a brutal levelling of individualities. Utopian socialism thus only valued fraternity, which was, in Cabet&#x27;s Icarie, the sole commandment.

This opposition between liberals and socialists was mirrored in rival historical interpretations of the Revolution, with liberals admiring 1789, and socialists admiring 1793. The July Revolution of 1830, establishing a constitutional monarchy headed by Louis-Philippe, substituted &quot;ordre et liberté&quot; (order and liberty) to the Napoleonic motto &quot;Liberté, Ordre public&quot;. 

Despite this apparent disappearance of the triptych, the latter was still being thought in some underground circles, in Republican secret societies, masonic lodges such as the &quot;Indivisible Trinity,&quot; far-left booklets or during the Canuts Revolt in Lyon. In 1834, the lawyer of the Society of the Rights of Man (Société des droits de l&#x27;homme), Dupont, a liberal sitting in the far-left during the July Monarchy, associated the three terms together in the &quot;Revue Républicaine&quot;, which he edited:

In 1847, the triptych resurfaced during the &quot;Campagne des Banquets&quot;, upheld for example in Lille by Ledru-Rollin.

Two interpretations had attempted to conciliate the three terms, beyond the antagonism between liberals and socialists. One was upheld by Catholic traditionalists, such as Chateaubriand or Ballanche, the other by socialist and republican such as Pierre Leroux. Chateaubriand gave a Christian interpretation of the revolutionary motto, stating in the 1841 conclusion to his &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;outre-tombe&quot;:

Neither Chateaubriand nor Ballanche considered the three terms to be antagonistic. Rather, they took them for being the achievement of Christianity. On the other hand, Pierre Leroux did not disguise the difficulties of associating the three terms, but superated it by considering liberty as the aim, equality as the principle and fraternity as the means. Leroux ordered the motto as Liberty, Fraternity, Equality, an order supported by Christian socialists, such as Buchez.

Against this new order of the triptych, Michelet supported the traditional order, maintaining the primordial importance of an original individualistic right. Michelet attempted to conciliate a rational communication with a fraternal communication, &quot;right beyond right&quot;, and thus the rival traditions of socialism and liberalism. The republican tradition would strongly inspire itself from Michelet&#x27;s synchretism.

===1848 Revolution===

With the 1848 February Revolution, the motto was officially adopted, mainly under the pressure of the people who had attempted to impose the red flag over the tricolor flag. The 1791 red flag was the symbol of martial law and of order, not of insurrection. Lamartine opposed popular aspirations, and in exchange of the maintaining of the tricolor flag, conceded the Republican motto of , written on the flag, on which a red rosette was added.

Fraternity was then considered to resume, and to contain both Liberty and Equality, being a form of civil religion, which, far from opposing itself to Christianity, was associated with it in 1848 establishing social links, as called for by Rousseau in the conclusion of the &quot;Social Contract&quot;.

Fraternity was not devoid of its previous sense of opposition between brothers and foes, with images of blood haunting revolutionary Christian publications, taking in Lamennais&#x27; themes. Thus, the newspaper &quot;Le Christ républicain&quot; (The Republican Christ) developed the idea of the Christ bringing forth peace to the poor and war to the rich.

On 6 January 1852, the future Napoleon III, first President of the Republic, ordered all prefects to erase the triptych from all official documents and buildings, conflating the words with insurrection and disorder. Auguste Comte applauded Napoleon, claiming equality to be the &quot;symbol of metaphysical anarchism&quot;, and preferring to it his diptych &quot;ordre et progrès&quot;, &quot;order and progress&quot;, which became the motto of Brazil, Ordem e Progresso. Proudhon criticized fraternity as an empty word, which he associated with idealistic dreams of Romanticism. He preferred to it the sole term of liberty.

===Paris Commune and Third Republic===
Pache, mayor of the Paris Commune, painted the formula &quot;Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité, ou la mort&quot; on the walls of the commune. It was under the Third Republic that the motto was made official. It was then not dissociated with insurrection and revolutionary ardours, Opportunist Republicans such as Jules Ferry or Gambetta adapting it to the new political conditions. Larousse&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire universel&quot; deprived fraternity of its &quot;evangelistic halo&quot; (Mona Ozouf), conflating it with solidarity and the welfare role of the state.

Some still opposed the Republican motto, such as the nationalist Charles Maurras in his &quot;Dictionnaire politique et critique&quot;, who claimed liberty to be an empty dream, equality an insanity, and only kept fraternity. Charles Péguy, renewing with Lamennais&#x27; thought, kept fraternity and liberty, excluding equality, seen as an abstract repartition between individuals reduced to homogeneity, opposing &quot;fraternity&quot; as a sentiment put in motion by &quot;misery&quot;, while equality only interested itself, according to him, to the mathematical solution of the problem of &quot;poverty.&quot;

Péguy identified Christian charity and socialist solidarity in this conception of fraternity. On the other hand, Georges Vacher de Lapouge, the most important French author of pseudo-scientific racism and supporter of eugenism, completely rejected the republican triptych, adopting another motto, &quot;déterminisme, inégalité, sélection&quot; (determinism, inequality, selection). According to Ozouf, the sole use of a triptych was the sign of the influence of the republican motto, despite it being corrupted in its opposite.

==20th century==

During the German occupation of France in World War II, this motto was replaced by the reactionary phrase &quot;travail, famille, patrie&quot; (work, family, fatherland) by Marshal Pétain, who became the leader of the new Vichy French government in 1940. Pétain had taken this motto from the colonel de la Rocque&#x27;s &quot;Parti social français&quot; (PSF), although the latter considered it more appropriate for a movement than for a regime.

Following the Liberation, the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF) re-established the Republican motto , which was incorporated into the 1946 and the 1958 French constitutions.

In 1956, the Algerian woman militant Zohra Drif, who during the Algerian War planted a bomb in the Milk Bar Cafe in which three French women were killed, justified this and other violent acts by the FLN, by asserting that the French Authorities did not see their dedication to the principles of Equality and Liberty as relevant in Algeria.

==Other nations==
Many other nations have adopted the French slogan of &quot;liberty, equality, and fraternity&quot; as an ideal. Indian polymath and social reformer B.R. Ambedkar is to have said, &quot;I like the religion that teaches &#x27;liberty, equality, and fraternity&#x27;&quot;. He, as Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution of India, included these words in the preamble to the Constitution of India, in 1950. 

Since its founding, &quot;Liberty, Equality and Brotherhood&quot; has been the lemma of the Social Democratic Party of Denmark. In the United Kingdom the political party the Liberal Democrats refer to &quot;the fundamental values of liberty, equality and community&quot; in the preamble of the party&#x27;s Federal Constitution, and this is printed on party membership cards.

The Czech slogan &quot;Rovnost, volnost, bratrství&quot; was a motto of the Czech national gymnastics organization Sokol at the end of the 19th century. Liberal values of the fraternal organization manifested themselves in the Czech independence movement during World War I, when many Sokol members joined armies of the Allies and formed the Czechoslovak Legion to form independent Czechoslovakia in 1918.

The Philippine National Flag has a rectangular design that
consists of a white equilateral triangle, symbolizing liberty,
equality, and fraternity; a horizontal blue stripe for peace,
truth, and justice; and a horizontal red stripe for patriotism
and valor. In the center of the white triangle is an eight-
rayed golden sun symbolizing unity, freedom, people&#x27;s
democracy, and sovereignty.

Some former colonies of the French Republic, such as Haiti, Chad, Niger, and Gabon, have adopted similar three-word national mottos.

The idea of the slogan &quot;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity&quot; has influenced as natural law, the First Article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:

==Culture==
The term is referred to in the 1993-94 film trilogy &quot;Three Colours&quot; by Krzysztof Kieślowski.

&quot;Libertad! Igualdad! Fraternidad!&quot; is the title of an English-language poem by William Carlos Williams.

<doc id="750821" wikidata="Q589944" url="?curid=750821" title="Erik Sandin">
<text>Erik Sandin (born July 29, 1966), is an American musician, best known as the drummer of the punk rock band NOFX, and former member of punk rock band Caustic Cause. He was a founding member of NOFX when they formed in Hollywood, California, in 1983.

Two years after forming NOFX, he moved to Santa Barbara, leaving the band. In just one year without Sandin, the band had already gone through two drummers (Scott Sellers and Scott Aldahl) and in 1986 the band talked Sandin into rejoining NOFX.

He has been NOFX&#x27;s permanent drummer since his return in 1986, and played drums on every NOFX full-length album and EP released, including the 2007 live album &quot;They&#x27;ve Actually Gotten Worse Live!&quot;. The band Dogpiss featured a song about him called &quot;Erik Sandin&#x27;s Stand In&quot; on the Fat Wreck Chords compilation album &quot;Short Music for Short People&quot;.

Before the recording of the 1992 album &quot;White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean&quot;, NOFX frontman Fat Mike gave Sandin an ultimatum. He had to quit heroin or be replaced. After realizing that NOFX was the most important thing in his life and with assistance of Brett Gurewitz and Lynn Strait, Sandin entered rehab at The Ranch in Desert Hot Springs, California for treatment of heroin addiction. Sandin has not used the drug since. As it can be seen in the video series Backstage Passport, he conducts a more sober and &quot;clean&quot; life than his bandmates, often going back to the hotel after a show instead of hanging out and partying with the rest of the band.

== Pickle Stix ==
In early 2020, unsure of whether or not NOFX would tour again due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sandin turned his hobby of shaping surfboards into an actual business. Sandin launched Pickle Stix and began crafting and shipping custom surfboards out of his garage in Long Beach, California. During this period, Sandin was crafting between twenty and forty boards a day, likening the process to his approach to creating music on his instrument.

Sandin began shaping surfboards in 2008, which spurred out of a desire to contribute to surfing&#x27;s art form, similar to his desire to contribute to music&#x27;s art form. The second board he ever shaped was finished with a shade of green reminiscent of a pickle. Sandin&#x27;s friend, Curly, began calling it his pickle stick, hence the title Sandin would eventually decide upon for the business.

Before the establishment of Pickle Stix, Sandin claims to have shaped a couple hundred boards in his free time for the purpose of riding some himself, selling on craigslist, and gifting to friends.

== Drum Equipment ==
Since 1992, Sandin has frequented the Yamaha Absolute Hybrid Maple Kit as his drum kit of choice, in which he prefers a 22&quot; x 18&quot; kick drum, 14&quot; x 6&quot; snare drum, 12&quot; rack tom, and 16&quot; floor tom. Regarding snare drums, Sandin specifically frequents the AMS1460 and RRS1455. 

Sandin has also been known to play Yamaha&#x27;s Stage Custom Birch drum kit.

<doc id="750827" wikidata="Q344590" url="?curid=750827" title="Actually">
<text>Actually (stylised as Pet Shop Boys, actually.) is the second studio album by English synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys, released on 7 September 1987 by Parlophone in the United Kingdom and by EMI Manhattan in North America. The album features two number one singles, &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin&quot; and &quot;Heart&quot;, and a duet with Dusty Springfield, &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot; &quot;Actually&quot; is the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; top-selling album in the UK, certified triple platinum with over one million sales; worldwide it has sold over four million copies. 

==Background and composition==
For their second album, Pet Shop Boys still had material from their early songwriting days, including &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin&quot; (1982), &quot;Rent&quot; (1984), and &quot;One More Chance&quot; which they had recorded with Bobby Orlando and released as an unsuccessful single outside the UK in 1984. &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot; was a collaboration with songwriter Allee Willis, suggested by their manager Tom Watkins; they had hoped to include it on &quot;Please&quot; (1986) but had to wait for a response from Dusty Springfield.

The duo also wrote new material. &quot;Hit Music&quot; was inspired by the Henry Mancini theme song &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; covered by Art of Noise. The music for &quot;I Want to Wake Up&quot; was written by Chris Lowe; the lyrics added by Neil Tennant compare unrequited love to a bad dream, mentioning the songs &quot;Tainted Love&quot; and &quot;Love Is Strange&quot;. The chart-topper &quot;Heart&quot; was a song they considered giving to Hazell Dean but decided to keep for themselves. 

&quot;Shopping&quot; began as a joke about spelling out the word as they were shopping, but the lyrics took a serious turn about the privatisation of national industries under Margaret Thatcher. The &quot;Tell Sid&quot; advertisements for British Gas, encouraging people to buy shares in the company, were a particular source of inspiration.

Composer Ennio Morricone shares a songwriting credit on &quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;. Pet Shop Boys had contacted Morricone about writing a string arrangement for their song &quot;Jealousy&quot;, but instead he sent them an Italian song to work with. Pet Shop Boys used the music from the chorus of Morricone&#x27;s song and wrote a new verse, with Lowe adding chord changes. Angelo Badalamenti contributed an arrangement which was programmed into a Fairlight by Blue Weaver in lieu of an orchestra. The title &quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Happen Here&quot; refers to an early belief, discussed by Tennant and his friend Christopher Dowell, that AIDS would not greatly impact the UK. By the time Tennant wrote the lyrics, Dowell had been diagnosed with the disease; he died two years later.

The last track on the album, &quot;King&#x27;s Cross&quot;, depicts the area around King&#x27;s Cross station in London, which at the time was a destination for drug addicts, prostitutes, and the homeless, as well as people coming by train from northern England and Scotland seeking opportunities. According to Tennant, &quot;It&#x27;s an angry song about Thatcherism. Mrs Thatcher came in on the promise of firm government and I&#x27;m interpreting &#x27;the smack of firm government&#x27; literally as hitting someone. That&#x27;s what firm government tends to mean—you hit the weakest person, the man at the back of the queue&quot;. With this and songs like &quot;Shopping&quot; and &quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;, Tennant noted that &quot;Actually&quot; can be taken loosely as a critique of Thatcherism.

==Recording==
&quot;Actually&quot; was recorded at Sarm Studios and Advision Studios. On the album Pet Shop Boys worked with several producers, including Julian Mendelsohn and Stephen Hague. Mendelsohn produced and engineered half of the album&#x27;s ten tracks, including the lead single and UK number one &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin&quot;, while Hague, who had produced the duo&#x27;s previous album &quot;Please&quot;, this time only produced a few tracks, including &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot;, and mixed &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin&quot;. &quot;Heart&quot;, which went on to became a UK number one single, was produced by Andy Richards and mixed by Mendelsohn. Wanting to keep everything fresh and not lose perspective, the production method was usually to work only a few hours at the time on each track and then switch to another.

==Album cover==
The album cover was originally going to feature a painting by Scottish artist Alison Watt, who had just won the National Portrait Gallery-supported John Player Portrait Award. The group traveled to Glasgow, along with photographer Eric Watson and designer Mark Farrow, to meet her. Sittings for the painting would have taken three weeks, so instead photos were taken of the duo in different poses. After a few weeks, Watt submitted the painting, but Lowe was unhappy with how he looked in it. The painting was reworked and although Tennant was pleased with it, Lowe still had reservations. It was decided that the painting wasn&#x27;t right for the album and it was shelved. The painting was bought by Tennant.

While shooting the video for &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot;, photographer Cindy Palmano was commissioned to take photographs of them for a &quot;Smash Hits&quot; cover. She placed them in front of a waist-high piece of reflective metal, with a similar sheet behind them. The photo where Tennant is yawning and Lowe is scowling was the favourite and &quot;Smash Hits&quot; were keen to use it as a front cover. Eric Watson then took some photos, but it was thought these weren&#x27;t strong enough for the album cover, so they were used for the inner sleeve. The group then decided that Palmano&#x27;s photo was the best choice. The issue of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; was due to go to press the following day. They persuaded the magazine to release Palmano&#x27;s photograph and agreed to do a hastily arranged photo session for them.

Inspired by Jean-Paul Goude&#x27;s design for Grace Jones album &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot;, Mark Farrow tightly cropped the photo to remove the reflective background and just have the duo on a plain white background. Chris Lowe was, and remains, unhappy with the cover. However it has come to be seen as the defining image of them.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Actually&quot; was released on 7 September 1987, debuting at number two on the UK Albums Chart behind Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Bad&quot;. It was in the top 40 for 42 consecutive weeks, with 15 weeks in the top 10. It is the only Pet Shop Boys album to be certified triple platinum by BPI. 
&quot;Actually&quot; was also certified platinum in seven other countries, including Germany where sales exceeded 500,000 (see Certifications and sales). In the United States, &quot;Actually&quot; peaked at number 25 and spent 45 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling over 750,000 copies with a gold certification.

&quot;Actually&quot; produced four UK top 10 singles: the number-one single &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin&quot;, &quot;Rent&quot;, &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot;—which peaked at number two in both the UK and US and led to a resurgence of interest in Dusty Springfield&#x27;s earlier work—and another UK number one in April 1988 with a remixed version of the song &quot;Heart&quot;.

In television commercials for the release, Lowe and Tennant were shown in black tie, blank-faced against a white background. The former seems unimpressed by a radio DJ-style Alan &#x27;Fluff&#x27; Freeman voiceover listing their previous hits and new singles from &quot;Actually&quot;, while the latter eventually &quot;gets bored&quot; and yawns, with the image then freezing to create, roughly, the album&#x27;s cover shot.

During this period Pet Shop Boys also completed a full-length motion picture called &quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;. Featuring songs by the duo, it was most famous for containing the video for &quot;Always on My Mind&quot; (starring Joss Ackland as a blind priest), which—while not on &quot;Actually&quot;—was released as a single during this period.

&quot;Actually&quot; was re-released in 2001 as &quot;Actually: Further Listening 1987–1988&quot;. The new version was digitally remastered and came with a second disc of B-sides and previously unreleased material from around the time of the album&#x27;s original release. A remastered single-disc edition of &quot;Actually&quot;, containing only the 10 original tracks, was released in 2009. In 2018, a newly remastered edition of &quot;Actually: Further Listening 1987–1988&quot; was released, with the same contents as the 2001 edition.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Actually&quot; was generally well received by critics. At the time of its release, Chris White of &quot;Music Week&quot; said &quot;Actually&quot; was &quot;well worth the wait with the duo coming up with another highly original and distinctive-sounding album&quot; and called it a &quot;great pop album which will deservedly be one of the year&#x27;s biggest sellers&quot;. In December 1987, Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; praised it as &quot;actual pop music with something actual to say—pure commodity, and proud of it.&quot; In his retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that &quot;Actually&quot; is the album where &quot;the Pet Shop Boys perfected their melodic, detached dance-pop.&quot;

&quot;Actually&quot; is featured in the 2005 musical reference book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, and has been recognised in various other &quot;must-listen&quot; lists. In 2006, &quot;Q&quot; magazine included &quot;Actually&quot; in its list of the &quot;40 Best Albums of the &#x27;80s&quot; at number 22. In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked the record at number 88 on its list of the &quot;100 Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed &quot;Actually&quot; at number 435 on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Usage in other media==
Although not released as a single, the track &quot;Shopping&quot; is frequently featured as background music in British television news and current affairs programmes dealing with retail business issues and as bumper music on home shopping shows. This is despite the fact that the song is actually a critique of privatisation in 1980s Britain, and has little to do with actual shopping. &quot;Shopping&quot; was also used in a season 1 episode of the Disney Channel television series &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;. A more appropriate use of &quot;Shopping&quot; is in the fourth episode of &quot;Andrew Marr&#x27;s History of Modern Britain&quot;, dealing with privatisation and deregulation. 

&quot;King&#x27;s Cross&quot; served in the Japanese media as a commercial song for the Aurex&#x27;s (owned by Toshiba) cassette tape recorder model XDR. The album is featured in the preview of Naughty Dog&#x27;s game &quot;&quot;.

<text>The Fiat Bravo and Fiat Brava (Type 182) are small family cars produced by the Italian automaker Fiat from 1995 to 2003 (2001 in Europe). They were effectively two versions of the same car: the Bravo, a three-door hatchback, and the Brava, a five-door fastback. The Bravo name was revived in January 2007, with the all-new Fiat Bravo, a replacement for the Stilo. The new version was available only with five doors.

The name Brava was also used in the United States in the 1980s, on the earlier Fiat 131.

==History==

The Bravo and the Brava were replacements for Fiat&#x27;s successful but ageing Tipo model. The two cars were very different in styling detail and driving experience, the Bravo chassis being tuned for more precise handling, whilst the Brava was tuned for better comfort. The interior trim and many of the body colours were unique to either one version or the other. Both cars had a two-star safety rating on Euro NCAP. The cars came with all-new engines, the base model using a 1.4 L 12-valve engine producing . Three other petrol engines were available: the 1.6 L 16 valve; the 1.8 L 16-valve engine and the top-of-the-range 2.0 L 20-valve inline five unit used in the HGT model, which produced and which could take the car to a maximum speed of . In 1999, the 155 HGT model replaced the older model, offering greater power of .

Two turbodiesel engines were also available: both were 1.9 L four-cylinder units, one producing and the other making . The Bravo/Brava was voted European Car of the Year on its launch.

The Bravo/Brava chassis spawned saloon and estate versions in 1996, which were badged as the Fiat Marea, a car which aimed at Ford Mondeo and Opel/Vauxhall Vectra buyers, which won praise for its large boot.

Another car based on the Bravo/Brava underpinnings, the Fiat Multipla, was launched in 1998, which was a six-seater compact MPV. In 1999, the Bravo/Brava received a mild makeover. It was discontinued in 2001, being replaced by the Fiat Stilo.

The cars were advertised as being silent, futuristic, economical and offering &quot;The Choice&quot;. Fiat&#x27;s Italian adverts said &quot;Fiat Bravo. Fiat Brava. La Scelta&quot;, which roughly translates as &quot;Fiat Bravo. Fiat Brava. The Choice&quot;, hinting at the fact that they &#x27;were very similar cars but with the option of a sporty three-door hatchback or a practical five-door fastback.

Peter Davis, Fiat&#x27;s Styling Center director at the time, said that they started working on the Bravo and Brava immediately after they had finished working on the Coupe and the Barchetta. He said they wanted to push the design to the limit, break the rules and discover every angle of the car, distinguishing it from the competitors.

Jeremy Clarkson reviewed the Fiat Bravo and Brava in 1995 on &quot;Top Gear&quot;, stating that &quot;This is how an ordinary car can look like, if you put a bit of effort into it&quot;. He also stated : &quot;I&#x27;m in a three-door hatchback, which you can buy for less than £10,000, and I&#x27;m having fun, and it&#x27;s only got a 1.4-litre engine! A good-looking car that&#x27;s nice to drive and cheap to run too.&quot; Clarkson also said that the car felt rigid, there were no squeaks or rattles, and all the switches inside had a quality feel.

==Facelift==
The Bravo/Brava received a mild facelift in 1999.

The 1.4L 12v engine was dropped in favour of the 1.2 16v unit from the Fiat Punto, the 2.0L 20V engine of the HGT model gained VVT and VIS systems upping the power from to , the dashboard was redesigned and improved across all trim levels, the grilles of the cars were redesigned, the A/C unit was swapped with the automatic one from the Fiat Coupé, and other small details about the cars were changed throughout the range of trims.

The 1.9 turbodiesel was phased out in favour of 1.9 JTD diesel units (now with and ), to give even better economy and refinement. In the Greek market, all later model Bravas received the rear deck spoiler as standard.

<doc id="750830" wikidata="Q320279" url="?curid=750830" title="Siemens–Duewag U2">
<text>The Siemens–Duewag U2 is a type of light rail vehicle (LRV), built by consortium of Siemens, Duewag and Wegmann &amp; Co built between 1968 and 1990.

The design was based on the prototype U1 tram built in 1965 for the Frankfurt U-Bahn. The U2 was also designed for and used by the Frankfurt U-Bahn. The name is derived from the class identifier given to the cars in the Frankfurt.

The U2 was later exported to North America and adapted for use on light rail systems in Edmonton, Calgary, and San Diego, during a period in which few purpose-built LRVs were being manufactured.

==History==
===U1 prototype===

In the early 1960s, Duewag developed and manufactured a prototype of a new tram for the Frankfurt U-Bahn. The design was largely based on the previously delivered trams, but added electronic controls that allowed several railcars to be coupled together to form trains, and a floor height of that made it possible to board from platforms with a height of without having to add a folding step previously used. The new car was debuted at the International Transport Exhibition in Munich in 1965 and two vehicles arrived in Frankfurt in May 1966. There was no further production of the U1, and they were only used in regular service for a few years before being retired in 1976 because of their incompatibility with the rest of the fleet.

===U1 production vehicles===
With the experience learned from the two prototypes, several changes were made for the production series of cars. 

The vehicles were built by consortium of Siemens, Duewag and Wegmann &amp; Co. Duewag was the primary developer and manufacturer, Siemens provided the electrical equipment, and Wegmann did some assembly under contract.

The U2 vehicle was originally developed for the light rail system in Frankfurt. Its design was later used for systems in Edmonton and Calgary. The model was chosen for operations in San Diego in 1979, however, the planned platform level was lower than their counterpart system, so a street-level version was developed, and 71 vehicles were eventually delivered in stages.

===In Mendoza===
San Diego Metropolitan Transit System exported 11 cars to the Metrotranvia Mendoza system in Argentina in early 2010. These cars entered service in 2012 with a further 24 for expansion and parts donors following later that year.

===Refurbishment===
Edmonton Transit Service refurbished all 37 of its U2s to extend their operational life by another 10 years. Upgrades included overhauls to the mechanical and electrical systems, the addition of new LED interior and exterior destination signs, additional speakers to improve sound volume, and retrofits for CBTC operation for the Metro Line. Refurbishment was done by Bombardier Transportation in Buffalo, New York.

===Retirement===
In 2010, the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System sold 35 cars to Mendoza, Argentina, followed by the bulk of its U2 fleet retiring in 2013, when the Orange Line received low-floor cars. The remainder were used on its initial operating segment until January 2015. In 2016, two cars were shipped to Texas for use at a dog training facility, The majority of the U2&#x27;s had left the property by 2018, having been either scrapped or donated to museums, with car 1001 being retained.

After 48 years of service, the last Frankfurt examples were retired in April 2016. The Frankfurt cars have been replaced by Bombardier Flexity Swifts, there are three cars left for museum purposes.

Calgary Transit has begun a similar retirement system as they have begun to introduce the Siemens S200 as both a replacement and expansion of the fleet. The city has begun to explore additional disposition options. The U2s in Calgary had been retired in 2016 but there are still 40 in service out of 83 DCs and 2 ACs.

Edmonton Transit Service has announced that its 37 U2s will be replaced by 2030, as they intend to procure new LRV&#x27;s between 2023-2024. They have also stated that they are looking into preserving at least one vehicle for their historical fleet.

==Technical details==
The U2&#x27;s dimensions are by by . In the US and Canada, usually up to five U2 cars are coupled to run as a train. Calgary Transit regularly couples up six U2 cars to shuttle them from Anderson Garage to Haysboro storage. These unique shuttle trains can be commonly seen after the evening rush hour. Each articulated car has a total passenger capacity of 264 passengers. It may be equipped with two DC motors for a total power output of and a maximum speed of , or with four AC motors for an output of and speed of .

As the length of a tram or light-rail train running on shared track is restricted to a maximum of in Germany, up to four U2 cars may be used in a single consist on such track.

Frankfurt U2 cars use Scheren (diamond) or single-arm (z-shaped) pantographs, while Calgary, Edmonton and San Diego vehicles use the latter style pantograph exclusively.

In order to operate safely, the cars require to accelerate from a station, and to maintain speed.

==Variants==

Siemens-Duewag Type U3 is an upgraded version of the U2 with a slightly longer length and cosmetic changes. Introduced in 1977, they entered service in 1980 and will be exported to Monterrey in Mexico, after being retired from service by Germany&#x27;s Frankfurt U-Bahn. Three examples will be preserved for museum service

Siemens-Duewag Type U2a on Sacramento Regional Transit&#x27;s light rail system is an upgraded version of the U2 that shares similar characteristics of the newer SD-100s and SD-160s, yet it still uses the mechanical equipment of the U2.
Siemens also developed a U2 running on alternating current motors using inverters (nicknamed the U2-AC). 2 units were purchased by the Government of Alberta in 1988 and operated as demo units for Edmonton and Calgary. Calgary ended up adding the two units to their main fleet until 2015, when both were retired due to part issues. One of the units is still active as a track inspection vehicle, while the other was scrapped for spare parts.

Two variants, designated U2h and U2e, were locally created during the early 2000s in Frankfurt to serve different platform heights on the network. Originally the trains were designed to serve platforms of height, with one large step at each door. As platforms were rebuilt to create a unified standard height of , modifications were required to the fleet: U2h retained a small step to serve platforms on lines U1 to U3, while U2e lost the step entirely to serve and later platforms on lines U4, U6 and U7.

==U2 cars acquired, by city==
* Calgary (CTrain) — 85 cars (83 U2-DC, and 2 U2-AC acquired from Edmonton)
* Edmonton (Edmonton LRT) — 37 cars, 2 U2-AC cars operated as demonstrators between 1988 and 1990, plus 3 parts cars acquired from Calgary.
**Retrofitted to have electronic LED destination signs on the exterior and interior among other changes, including introducing moving block communications-based train control systems installed by Thales which allow the trains to run in a fully automated mode
* Frankfurt (Public transport in Frankfurt am Main) — 104 cars; U2 cars completely retired from service as of 2016.
* San Diego (San Diego Trolley) — 71 cars; U2 cars completely retired from service on the San Diego Trolley on January 26, 2015
* Mendoza (Metrotranvía Mendoza) — 18 cars (purchased used from San Diego)

===U2a cars acquired, by city===

* Sacramento (SacRT light rail) - 26 cars

==Preservation==
San Diego MTS retired their last U2 vehicles in January 2015, coinciding with low floor S70 cars being deployed on its Blue Line, six examples are preserved by various museums and nonprofits. 
* San Diego Electric Railway Association (SDERA) - Car 1002, now on display in National City
* Southern California Railway Museum - Cars 1003 and 1008, operate regularly on the Museum system, independently and as a two-car train.
* Western Railway Museum - Cars 1017 and 1018, operate on museum excursions
* Rockhill Trolley Museum - Car 1019 operates regularly on the Museum system.

MTS has retained Car 1001 as part of its heritage fleet of light rail vehicles. The car was unveiled as part of a celebration at 12th &amp; Imperial on July 11, 2019, and re-entered service two days later. The car operates on the Silver Line, alongside San Diego PCC cars 529 and 530.

The City of Edmonton has stated that at least one U2 will be preserved and operational for their historical fleet. The City of Calgary is currently looking into putting one on static display.

Cars 303-305 of the Frankfurt system have also been preserved following retirement in 2016.

<text>Sophia Fominichna Palaiologina or Paleologue (; born Zoe Palaiologina; ; – 7 April 1503) was a Byzantine princess from the Palaiologos imperial dynasty and the grand princess of Moscow as the second wife of Ivan III of Russia. Her father was Thomas Palaiologos, the despot of the Morea. Through her eldest son, Vasili III, she was the grandmother of Ivan IV, the first crowned tsar of all Russia.

== Family ==
Zoe was born in the Morea in 1449. Her father was Thomas Palaiologos, Despot of the Morea and younger brother of the last Byzantine Emperor, Constantine XI Palaiologos (). Her mother was Catherine, daughter and heiress of Centurione II Zaccaria, the last independent Prince of Achaea and Baron of Arcadia.

The marriage between Thomas Palaiologos and Catherine Zaccaria produced four children: Helena (later wife of Lazar Branković, Despot of Serbia), Zoe, Andreas, and Manuel.

==In Italy==

The fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453 was a turning point in Zoe&#x27;s life. Seven years later, in 1460, the Ottoman army attacked Morea and quickly breached the Hexamilion wall across the Isthmus of Corinth, which was too long to be effectively manned and defended by Thomas&#x27; forces. Thomas and his family escaped to Corfu and then to Rome, where (already recognized as the legitimate heir to the Byzantine Empire by the Pope) he made a ceremonial entrance as Byzantine Emperor on 7 March 1461. Catherine remained in Corfu with her children and died there on 16 August 1462.

Zoe and her brothers remained in Petriti, a fishing port on the southeast coast of Corfu, until 1465, when their dying father recalled them to Rome. Thomas Palaiologos died on 12 May 1465.

Zoe and her brothers were adopted by the Papacy after her father&#x27;s death. Born and raised in the Orthodox religion, it is possible that she was educated as a Catholic in Rome. She spent the next years in the court of Pope Sixtus IV.

The care of the Imperial children was assigned to a famous Greek humanist, theologian and scholar, Cardinal Basilios Bessarion. The Cardinal&#x27;s surviving correspondence shows that the Pope took an interest in the welfare and development of Sophia and her brothers. They received 3,600 crowns (in payments of 200 crowns per month) for their clothes, horses and servants, and an additional 100 crowns for the maintenance of a modest household that included a doctor, a Latin teacher, a Greek teacher, a translator, and one or two priests.

After the death of Thomas Palaeologus, his eldest son, Andreas, claimed the Imperial title, but he sold his rights to several European monarchs and ultimately died in poverty. During the reign of Bayezid II, Manuel returned to Constantinople (now Istanbul) and remained there, at the mercy of the Sultan. According to some sources, he converted to Islam, raised a family and served in the Turkish Navy.

In 1466, the Venetian Republic invited King James II of Cyprus to ask for the hand of Sophia in marriage, but he refused. Around 1467, Pope Paul II offered Sophia&#x27;s hand to a Prince Caracciolo. Although they were solemnly betrothed, the marriage never took place.

==Grand Princess consort of Moscow==

Maria of Tver, the first wife of Grand Prince Ivan III of Moscow, died in 1467. Their marriage produced one son, Ivan the Young, born in 1458. 

The marriage between Sophia and Ivan III was proposed by Pope Paul II in 1469, probably in hopes of strengthening the influence of the Catholic Church in Russia and eventually unifying the Orthodox and Catholic churches, as stipulated in the Council of Florence. Ivan III&#x27;s motives for pursuing this union were probably related to Sophia&#x27;s status and her rights over Constantinople. Cardinal Bessarion, a dedicated advocate of reunification, may have conceived the marriage plan.

Negotiations lasted for three years. Russian chronicles describe the events as follows: 

*On 11 February 1469, a delegation led by Cardinal Bessarion arrived in Moscow with the formal proposal of a marriage between Sophia and the Grand Prince. Ivan III consulted his mother, Maria of Borovsk, the Metropolitan Philip and his boyars, and received a positive response.
*In 1469, Ivan Fryazin (&quot;Gian-Battista della Volpe&quot;) was sent to the Papal Court to engage in formal negotiations for the match. The Pope received the Russian Ambassador with great honors. According to the chronicles, Fryazin returned to Moscow with a portrait of the princess that &quot;caused an extreme surprise in the court&quot;. (This portrait has not survived. It was probably painted by one of the painters in residence at the Papal Court at that time, either Pietro Perugino, Melozzo da Forlì or Pedro Berruguete). 
*On 16 January 1472, Fryazin was sent to Rome again, this time to bring home his master&#x27;s bride. He arrived in Rome on 23 May, after a journey of more than four months.
*The marriage took place on 1 June 1472, at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Because Grand Prince Ivan III could not be present, Fryazin served as his proxy. Clarice Orsini (wife of Lorenzo the Magnificent, ruler of Florence) and Queen Catherine of Bosnia were among the guests at the ceremony. Sophia received 6,000 ducats as a dowry.
*On 24 June 1472, Sophia and Fryazin left Rome with a grand entourage. The bride was accompanied by Cardinal Bessarion, who was probably there to act as an agent at the Moscow court. Legend says that Sophia&#x27;s dowry included books that became the basis of the famous library of Ivan the Terrible, her grandson. Their itinerary took them to the north of Italy and through Germany to the port of Lübeck, where they arrived on 1 September. The voyage across the Baltic Sea took 11 days. The ship landed in Reval (now Tallinn) in October 1472, and she continued the trip through Dorpat (now Tartu), Pskov, and Novgorod. Sophia was officially acclaimed in Pskov, and she impressed onlookers by the way she thanked the public for the celebrations. Sophia finally arrived in Moscow on 12 November 1472.

Even before she departed for Russian lands, it became apparent that the Vatican&#x27;s plans to have Sophia represent Catholicism had failed: Immediately after her wedding, she returned to the faith of her fathers. Papal Legate Anthony was not permitted to enter Moscow carrying the Latin cross before him. The Korsun cross is on view in the collections of the Moscow Kremlin Museums.

The formal wedding between Ivan III and Sophia took place at the Dormition Cathedral in Moscow on 12 November 1472. Some sources say that the ceremony was performed by Metropolitan Philip, others state that Hosea, Abbot of Kolomna, was the officiant.

Special mansions and gardens were built for Sophia in Moscow. They were burned in the great Moscow fire of 1493, and much of the treasure of the Grand Princess was lost.

Sophia was apparently not obliged to follow the custom of isolation that was practiced by elite Russian women among the wealthy boyars and the royal family. It was noted that she did not confine herself to the terems, the women&#x27;s quarters, but greeted foreign representatives as the queens of Western Europe did.

The Venetian ambassador, Ambrogio Contarini, wrote that in 1476 he had an audience with the Grand Duchess, who received him politely and kindly, and respectfully asked about the Doge.

Before the invasion of Akhmad in 1480, Sophia, her children, household and treasury were sent away, first to Dmitrov and then on to Belozersk. For fear Akhmad would finally take Moscow, she was advised to flee farther north, to the sea. These precautions led Vissarion, Bishop of Rostov, to warn the Grand Duke that his excessive attachment to his wife and children would be his destruction. The family did not return to Moscow until the winter. 

===Dynastic problems and rivalry===

Over time, the second marriage of the Grand Prince became one of the main sources of tension in the court, thanks to the &quot;shrewd&quot; character of the new Grand Princess and the spreading rumours that her husband let himself be directed by her suggestions. It is believed that Sophia introduced grand Byzantine ceremonies and meticulous court etiquette into the Kremlin, pleased with the idea of Moscow as a Third Rome.

In 1472, she was repelled by the formal tributary gesture with which her spouse greeted the Mongolian representatives. She is supposed to have convinced him to abandon that subordinate relationship with the Mongols in a break that was eventually completed in 1480.

Soon, the court divided into two parties. One supported the heir to the throne, Ivan the Young, and the other sided with Sophia. In 1476, the Venetian Ambrogio Contarini noted that the heir to the throne had lost his father&#x27;s favor, thanks to the intrigues of the Despoina. Despoina, or “Lady”, was used as a Byzantine court title. Sophia was so honoured as her father&#x27;s heir. However, if any tension existed between father and son, it did not interfere with his rights: From 1477 Ivan the Young was officially referred to as the co-ruler of Ivan III.

The princely family increased significantly: between 1474 and 1490, as the Grand Princess gave birth to eleven children, five sons and six daughters. 

There is a legend associated with the birth of Sophia&#x27;s eldest son, the future Vasily III: During one of her devout visits to the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius, the Grand Princess had a vision of the Venerable Sergius of Radonezh in which the saint &quot;presented her the long-waited son between his arms.&quot;

Another source of tension appeared in the Russian court in January 1483, when Ivan the Young married Elena, daughter of Stephen III the Great, Prince of Moldavia. The heir&#x27;s new wife soon became involved in court intrigues, especially after 10 October 1483, when she gave birth to a son, Dmitry. After the annexation of Tver in 1485, the Grand Duke named Ivan the Young Grand Prince of this domain. During the 1480s, Ivan&#x27;s position as the rightful heir was quite secure and Sophia&#x27;s supporters became less so. In particular, the Grand Princess was unable to obtain government posts for her relatives: Her brother, Andreas, departed from Moscow with nothing, and her niece, Maria (wife of Vasily Mikhailovich, Hereditary Prince of Verey-Belozersky), was forced to flee to Lithuania with her husband, an event that further undermined Sophia&#x27;s position at court. According to sources, Sophia had arranged her niece&#x27;s marriage to Prince Vasily in 1480, and in 1483 she gave Maria some jewelry that belonged to Ivan III&#x27;s first wife. When Ivan the Young asked for these jewels (he wanted to give them to his wife, Elena, as a gift), he discovered they were missing. Outraged, he ordered a search. Prince Vasily did not wait for retribution, but fled to Lithuania with his wife. One direct consequence of this episode was that Prince Michael of Verey-Belozersky, Vasily&#x27;s father, bequeathed his domains to the Grand Prince, effectively disinheriting his son. Sophia was able to obtain a pardon for her niece and her husband in 1493, but they never returned.

New factors came into play around 1490 when Ivan the Young became ill. The diagnosis was gout. Sophia wrote to a Venetian doctor named Leon, who imprudently promised Ivan III that he could cure the heir to the throne. All efforts failed. Ivan the Young died on 7 March 1490, and the doctor was executed. Rumors spread through Moscow that Sophia had poisoned the heir. Andrey Kurbsky, who wrote about these events almost 100 years later, said that these rumors were indisputable facts. However, modern historians say that, due to lack of sources, the theory that Sophia poisoned Ivan the Young cannot be verified. 

In 1497, Sophia and her eldest son, Vasili, were allegedly involved in a plot to kill Prince Dmitry, son of Ivan the Young. Both were disgraced and probably banished from court. On 4 February 1498, in the Dormition Cathedral in an atmosphere of great splendor, Prince Dmitry was crowned Grand Prince and co-ruler with his grandfather. Sophia and her son Vasili were not invited to the coronation. However, they were restored to favor in mid-1499 and allowed to return to court.

On 11 April 1502, the dynastic struggle came to an end. According to chronicles, Ivan III suddenly changed his mind and imprisoned both Grand Prince Dmitry and his mother, Elena, placing them under house arrest, surrounded by guards. Three days later, on 14 April, Vasili was crowned the new Grand Prince and co-ruler. Soon, Dmitry and his mother were transferred from house arrest to prison. 

The downfall of Dmitry and Elena also determined the fate of the Moscow-Novgorod Reformation movement in the Orthodox Church. In 1503, a council finally defeated it, and many prominent and progressive leaders of the movement were executed. Elena of Moldavia died in prison on 18 January 1505. Her son Dmitry died a few years later, on 14 February 1509, either from hunger and cold, or, as some claim, by suffocation on the orders of his uncle.

==Death==

The triumph of her son was the last important event in Sophia&#x27;s life. She died on 7 April 1503, two years before her husband, who died on 27 October 1505.

She was buried in a massive white stone sarcophagus in the crypt of the Ascension Convent in the Kremlin, next to the grave of Maria of Tver, the first wife of Ivan III. The word &quot;Sophia&quot; is carved on the lid of the sarcophagus.

The Ascension Convent was demolished in 1929 as ordered by the Soviet government, and the remains of Sophia and of other royal women were transferred to an underground chamber in the southern extension of the Cathedral of the Archangel.

<text>The Peugeot 206 is a supermini car (B-segment) designed and produced by the French car manufacturer Peugeot since May 1998 as a replacement to the Peugeot 205. Developed under the codename &quot;T1&quot;, it was released in September 1998 in hatchback form, which was followed by coupé cabriolet (206 CC) in September 2000, station wagon (206 SW) in September 2001, and a sedan version (206 SD) which is an abbreviation of the Iranian and Persian word sandogh-dar(sedan), it was made, produced and sold in Iran. in September 2005, before being replaced by the 207 in April 2006.

Its facelifted version was initially launched in South America in September 2008, and in China in November 2008, in hatchback, sedan and station wagon body styles, and marketed as the 207 Compact, and as the 207 respectively. This version was subsequently launched in Europe in February 2009, only in hatchback form and marketed as the 206+. In South America it continued to be offered as the 207 Compact nameplate until January 2017, and furthermore in China, both under the 207 nameplate and as the [[Citroën C2]].

The 206 is the best-selling Peugeot model of all time with 8,358,217 cars sold by 2012. , the facelifted version of the car (called the 207i) remained in production under license in Iran by IKCO. In 2020, the 206 had been counted as the thirtieth most long-lived single generation car by Autocar magazine.

==Overview==
===Project===

During the early 1990s, Peugeot decided not to directly replace the Peugeot 205, citing the reason that superminis were no longer profitable or worthwhile. Instead, Peugeot followed a unique strategy and decided that its new, smaller, supermini, the Peugeot 106 (launched in 1991), would take sales from the lower end of the 205 range while the lowest models of the Peugeot 306 range, launched in 1993 to replace the Peugeot 309, would take sales from the top-end 205s. Between the 106 and 306, Peugeot hoped that the 205 would not need to be replaced, and could be phased out slowly, while customers who would normally plump for the 205 would continue to have a choice with either a smaller or larger car. This strategy did not work. With the 205 phased out, other superminis like the Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Polo continued to sell well and increased in popularity, and without a direct competitor to these cars Peugeot was losing sales fast. A new supermini was required, and the 206 was launched in 1999 as a somewhat belated replacement for the 205.

On 7 April 1994, Jacques Calvet, then president of Peugeot, approved of the 206 development program codenamed &quot;T1&quot;, with launch planned by 1997. The in-house design team was led by Peugeot&#x27;s Head of Design, Murat Günak, and designer . The design was fixed six months after project approval, and the project took 34 months from design freeze to start of production. The development costs a total of 6.3 billion francs, with intensive use of IT as it is their first car designed with a digital mock-up along with crash simulations. The prototype was extensively tested on the Belchamp test circuit in the Valentigney forest. With no larger in-house platform from PSA Group to base its new supermini on (the Peugeot 106 shared its platform with the Citroën Saxo), Peugeot developed an all-new front drive platform for the 206.

===Powertrain===
The 206 was originally launched as a hatchback with 1.1L, 1.4L, and 1.6L petrol engines and a 1.9L diesel engine, an HDi version with common rail coming later. In 1999 a 2.0L GTi capable of , and in 2003 a tuned version of the GTi called the Peugeot 206 RC (GTi 180 in the UK), were added to the range. It did 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 7.4 seconds and it reached a top speed of with . In 2001, two more versions of the 206 were launched – the 206 CC (&quot;coupé convertible&quot;) with a folding steel roof and the 206 SW station wagon. A 4-door notchback sedan version, developed by Iran Khodro, was unveiled in late 2005, and it is available in the Iranian, North African, Chinese, Russian, Romanian, Turkish and Bulgarian markets.

===Production and marketing===
The Peugeot 206 was mainly manufactured in Peugeot&#x27;s Poissy and Mulhouse factories in France until 18 December 2012, as well as in Ryton, United Kingdom, whereas outside Europe it was produced in Iran (Iran Khodro), Chile (for the Mexican and Colombian markets, French-made 206s were cheaper than Chilean-built ones, in Chile), Argentina (PSA), Brazil (PSA), Uruguay (Oferol), China (Dongfeng), Indonesia (Gaya Motor) and Malaysia (Naza). In 2003, it received a minor facelift, getting clear headlights, different rear clusters, new side repeater lamps, chrome badges, a new range of colors, as well as other subtle interior revisions.

The Peugeot 206 was also assembled at its Ryton facility in Coventry, England, however, with the introduction of the 207 to the range, Peugeot decided to close the Ryton factory, ending the 206 production on 12 December 2006 and move production to Slovakia, due to the fact that they could produce their vehicles with same or better quality for a lower price there.

The Peugeot 206 proved to be a sales success all over Europe. It was one of the best-selling cars in Europe from 2001 to 2003 and it was the best car of the year in the UK for three consecutive years, between 1998 and 2001. The 1.4-litre XR was the best-selling model. On 26 May 2005, the 206 celebrated the five millionth unit produced since its commercial launch on 10 September 1998. Sales in the United Kingdom were strong from the start, with the 206 regularly being among the nation&#x27;s five most popular new cars during its first six years on sale. Second hand examples of the 206 traditionally hold their value well, due to high demand.

Production in Brazil took place in Porto Real, Rio de Janeiro, starting in 2001 with the hatchback, followed by the station wagon version in 2005. The models produced there featured 1.0-litre 16-valve, 1.4-litre 8-valve and 1.6-litre 16-valve engines, the last two of which are flexible fuel engines (petrol/ethanol). The 1.0-litre version used a Renault-sourced engine and was produced until 2006.

The Peugeot 206 has also been produced in Villa Bosch, Buenos Aires, Argentina, from July 1999 to 7 December 2016. The trim levels manufactured are XR, XRD, XS, XT and XTD. The diesel powered versions use the naturally aspirated DW engine. Some of these versions are equipped with local-made engines in Jeppener, Buenos Aires.

In May 2006, the Malaysian car manufacturer Naza launched a locally assembled version of the model with the name of 206 Bestari. In 2006, Peugeot started production of the 206 in China. In September 2006, Dongfeng Peugeot-Citroën Automobile launched a slightly modified Peugeot 206 called the Citroën C2 (this car was not related to the European-market Citroën C2).

== Body styles ==

=== 206 SW (T12) ===
In 2001, Peugeot showcased a near-production concept version of the 206 SW (&quot;Sports Wagon&quot;). Developed with the codename &quot;T12&quot;, the production model was released in March 2002 and was manufactured at the Ryton plant. It adopts a reinforced rear axle in order to support the excess weight. In 2007, the 206 SW assembly line was moved to Poissy after the Ryton plant was closed. By the end of its production, 366,000 units were produced. Sales ended in July 2006 after the 206 SW was replaced by the 207 SW.
===206 SD (T13)===

A notchback sedan model was introduced in Iran in 2006. Developed under the codename &quot;T13&quot;, it was jointly designed by the Peugeot Design Center for Iran Khodro and is the fifth and last version of Peugeot 206 models.

Since 2006, Iran Khodro started exporting the 206 SD to other countries, including Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, and Algeria, along with Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia.

It was also produced in Brazil, starting from October 2008, with the front end of the 206+ and sold as the 207 Passion. It was not related, however, to the 207 sold in Europe. It was removed from offer in the first quarter of 2015. This model was also offered throughout the rest of Latin America, including in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, Ecuador or Mexico.

In Malaysia and China, it was also locally produced and sold as the 207, solely as a sedan version.

===206 CC (T16)===
The Peugeot 206 CC was formally launched at the Paris Motor Show in September 2000 and was based on the Peugeot 20Coeur (or Two-oh-heart) concept car, revealed two years before at the Geneva Motor Show. It is a coupé cabriolet featuring a powered fold-away roof based on the Georges Paulin system, first seen on the 1935 Peugeot 402 Eclipse coupe.

It was developed with the codename &quot;T16&quot;. The roof-trunk modules, specific to the CC are manufactured in Cerizay, France, by the French company Heuliez, which is specialized in producing short series for niche markets such as convertibles or station wagons. Heuliez manufactured, assembled and painted the cars, while final assembly took place in Mulhouse. Production was stopped in early 2008, and it has since been replaced by the 207 CC.

==Variants==
===Grand Tourisme===
In order to homologate the 206 World Rally Car, Peugeot needed to sell road going versions of the 206 that were at least 4.0 metres long (the minimum length stipulated by the FIA for WRC cars). The WRC car was homologated with the 206 Grand Tourisme, similar to the standard 206 but with front and rear body extensions to bring the car from the standard road car&#x27;s 3.83 meters to the rally car&#x27;s 4 metre length.
4000 cars in total were produced, each with a unique number on a plaque on the door pillar both sides. 600 right-hand drive cars were produced for the UK. The mechanicals fitted to the Grand Tourisme were what was fitted to the upcoming 206 GTI, not yet released.

===GTi 180 and RC===

Introduced to the market in 2003, the Peugeot 206 GTi 180 and 206 RC brought high performance to the product range. The range topping GTi 180 was brought to the UK market, while the 206 RC was introduced to the rest of Europe. The new &#x27;hot hatch&#x27; used the 2 litre EW10J4S engine, which produced thanks to variable valve timing and modified inlet and exhaust manifolds. Other features on the 206 GTi 180 and 206 RC include 17 inch alloy wheels, racing bucket front seats, a short shift gear linkage and altered gearbox ratios (1st &amp; 2nd gears). The new car was capable of reaching in 7.4 seconds.

The 206 GTi 180 and 206 RC were produced to celebrate Peugeot&#x27;s rallying successes from 2000 to 2003, and to replicate the success Peugeot had with the 205 GTi in the 1980s.

===206 Escapade===

Following brands like Fiat and Volkswagen, Peugeot sells an off-roader version of the Peugeot 206 in selected South American markets, called the Peugeot 206 Escapade. It is essentially a Peugeot 206 SW station wagon with a rugged SUV-like bodykit and higher and tougher suspension. It is powered with a 1.6L 16v engine.

===Citroën C2 (T21)===
In November 2006, the Chinese joint venture Dongfeng Peugeot-Citroën launched a derivative version of the Peugeot 206 known as the Citroën C2. While it shares the same nameplate with a European-market model, it is instead a 206 with a modified front and rear body. In 2012, Citroën released a crossover-styled version called the Citroën C2 Cross. Almost 80,000 Citroën C2 were produced in China from 2006 to 2013.

===Naza 206 Bestari===
In Malaysia, the 206 was also marketed under the Naza name. It was sold as the Naza 206 Bestari, and was available in 1.4L petrol engine (TU3JP), and with the option of 5- speed manual transmission and 4-speed automatic transmission (codename AL4). It was replaced by the 206 SD, which was renamed as the 207 in Malaysia.

== Powertrain ==
==206+ (T31)==
The 206+ is a facelifted version of the 206, with a new front end and styling, similar to the European 207. It was manufactured in Mulhouse, France, and was launched in February 2009.

In May 2008, Peugeot&#x27;s Brazilian branch announced it would not manufacture nor import the Peugeot 207 to Brazil, but instead it would change some elements of the 206 already in production, arguing it would be impractical to do otherwise. The car, launched in August 2008, had minor changes to mechanical parts such as the suspension and gearbox. It is marketed between the original 206 and the European 207, having the Volkswagen Fox, Renault Clio Campus and the Chevrolet Agile as its main competitors. It is offered in 3- and 5-door hatchback, estate and 4-door saloon bodystyles, including a facelifted 207 Escapade.


The car is sold under the &quot;207 Compact&quot; nameplate in Argentina (country in which it is also produced) and Uruguay, in order to differentiate it from the European 207 CC and RC, which are also sold in those countries. Peugeot planned to name it &quot;207 Brasil&quot; in Brazil, but soon dropped the &quot;Brasil&quot; from the name, as this decision gained generally negative reactions from the media. The Brazilian 207 has also been criticized because it was perceived essentially as a facelifted 206, despite Peugeot&#x27;s efforts to market it as an entirely new car and even selling it at a higher base price.

In February 2009, Peugeot announced that this revised model will be made at the Mulhouse plant in France for the European (left-hand drive only) market, badged as the 206+. as a patriotic recession-beating rejoinder to Renault&#x27;s initiative of importing low priced Dacias from Romania. In May 2009 the company announced the recruitment of an additional 450 workers to support production at Mulhouse of the 206+ and the two door 308 models also assembled at this facility. This plant exported the model under the 207 Compact nameplate to Chile (since 2010), Mexico (2009–2011) and the Dominican Republic.

From October 2010, Naza Group started the assembly of the 207 sedan in Malaysia. It was also exported throughout RHD Southeast Asian and South Asian markets such as Thailand, Indonesia, Brunei, and Sri Lanka.

From May 2013, Peugeot no longer offers the 206+ in Europe due to higher demands of the newer 208 and the introduction of the 207-based 301.

===Iranian production===
In March 2010, Iran Khodro Company (IKCO), which produces the Peugeot 206 in Iran since April 2001, announced the production of the &quot;207i&quot; in hatchback version. The annual production target for this locally built 206+ was 15,000–20,000 annually. At the end of year 2011, IKCO&#x27;s production of the 207i stopped temporary during relation cut between IKCO and Peugeot because of international sanctions against Iran. This was IKCO&#x27;s main seller and it strongly impacted the company&#x27;s sales. However, in early 2016 IKCO presented an Iranized model, no longer dependent on French parts, and production restarted. IKCO had redeveloped the 207i using parts manufactured in Iran, India and China and launched the production of a vehicle extremely close to the one supplied by Peugeot. This second series 207i, launched in 2017, has some aesthetic differences (rear lights for example) and additional equipment (rear view camera, infotainment system). It retains the Peugeot badge, despite the rupture of ties between the two companies.

In December 2016, the three-box, automatic-only sedan version of the 207i was presented. Called the 207i SD, it was fitted with the TU5 engine but did not meet sales expectations and was withdrawn in 2019.

==Safety==

The 206 in its standard European market configuration received 4 stars for adult occupants and 2 stars for pedestrians from Euro NCAP in 2000.

The 207 Compact in its most basic Latin American market configuration with no airbags received 1 star for adult occupants and 2 stars for toddlers from Latin NCAP in 2010.

The 207 Compact in its most basic Latin American market configuration with 2 airbags received 2 stars for adult occupants and 2 stars for toddlers from Latin NCAP in 2010.

==Motorsport==

In 1999, Peugeot Sport unveiled the 206 WRC, and it competed for the first time in that year&#x27;s World Rally Championship, with French tarmac veteran and long-time marque stalwart Gilles Panizzi narrowly failing, against a resurgent reigning champion in Mitsubishi&#x27;s Tommi Mäkinen, to win the Rallye Sanremo. The car was soon a success, however, and won both the manufacturers&#x27; and drivers&#x27; championships in 2000, Peugeot&#x27;s first such accolades since their withdrawal from the WRC after Group B was banned after the 1986 season, and achieved in the hands of Panizzi, Francois Delecour and Mäkinen&#x27;s successor as drivers&#x27; world champion, Marcus Grönholm.

For 2001, Grönholm competed alongside two refugees of SEAT&#x27;s exit from the championship at the end of 2000; compatriot Harri Rovanperä and the French 1994 world champion, Didier Auriol. Rovanperä and Auriol each contributed single wins, on Swedish Rally and Rally Catalunya respectively (the former to be a sole career win for the Finn, and the latter victory helped by assorted problems for the blisteringly quick debuting Citroën Xsara WRCs), before Auriol left the team at the end of the season. Grönholm, meanwhile, suffered sufficient reliability woes in the first half of the year such that he could manage no higher than fourth overall in the series, although Peugeot did fend off Ford, with a 1–2 result by the two Finns on the season-ending Rally of Great Britain to successfully defend the constructors&#x27; championship title.
In 2002, Grönholm – despite now being paired in the factory line-up with defending 2001 champion from Subaru, the Briton Richard Burns – led Peugeot to a repeat of the WRC title double aboard his 206 WRC. His dominance that year was compared to Michael Schumacher&#x27;s dominance of Formula One. In summary, Peugeot won two drivers&#x27; championships, in 2000 and 2002, and three manufacturers&#x27; titles in a row between 2000 and 2002. However, by 2003 the 206 WRC was beginning to show its age and was less effective against the competition, notably the newer Xsara WRC and the Subaru Impreza WRC, so it was retired from competition at the end of the season, to be replaced with the 307 WRC, albeit, unlike its predecessor, based not on the production version&#x27;s hatchback, but its coupé cabriolet body style.

The Peugeot 206 WRC was awarded the Autosport &quot;Rally Car of the Year&quot; in 2002, preceded by the Ford Focus RS WRC and followed by the Citroën Xsara WRC.

In 2002, Peugeot GB created the Peugeot 206 Cup, a one-make rally championship aimed at young drivers. The championship was created to help young drivers develop their careers. The cars were built by Vic Lee Racing and drivers such as Tom Boardman, Luke Pinder and Garry Jennings all drove in the championship. A similar championship also existed in France.

==Advertising==
In 2003, Peugeot launched a popular television commercial for the Peugeot 206 directed by Matthijs van Heijningen, with Creative Direction by Roberto Greco and Giovanni Porro from Euro RSCG of Milan-Italy, known as &quot;The Sculptor&quot;, involved a young man in India who sees the 206 advertised in a magazine and then goes about damaging a Hindustan Ambassador (including having an elephant sit on it) and then spending the night welding it. The following day, the car emerges as an exact replica of the 206&#x27;s shape – except with many dents and discolorations. The man then takes his 206 replica driving with friends, with many interested onlookers. The track playing is &quot;Heaven Is A Place On Earth&quot; by Raja Mushtaq, later remixed as &quot;Husan&quot;, by Bhangra Knights.

The commercial won a number of prestigious international advertising awards:
# &quot;Gold&quot;, Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity 2003, Cars category.
# &quot;Gold&quot;, Clio Awards 2003, Product/Service: Automotive category.
# &quot;Gold&quot;, ADC*E 2003, TV Commercials category.
# &quot;The Cresta Awards 2003&quot;.
# &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, International Car Advertising Film Festival 2002.
# &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, Caucasus International Festival of Advertisement (CIFA) 2002.
# &quot;Gold&quot;, Caucasus International Festival of Advertisement (CIFA) 2002.
# &quot;Epica d’Or&quot;, EPICA (Europe&#x27;s Premier Creative Awards) 2002.
# &quot;Gold&quot;, EPICA (Europe&#x27;s Premier Creative Awards) 2002, Automobiles category.
# &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, Eurobest - The European Advertising Festival 2002.

In March 2018, the commercial was recreated in celebration of the 206&#x27;s 20th anniversary. The commercial is essentially similar to the original, except that the Ambassador became a replica of the Peugeot 208 GTI.

<text>The Little San Bernardino Mountains are a short mountain range of the Transverse Ranges, located in southern California in the United States. They extend for approximately southeast from the San Bernardino Mountains through San Bernardino and Riverside Counties to near the northeast edge of the Salton Sink and Salton Sea.

The community of Palm Springs looks north and northeast across the Coachella Valley to the range.

==Geography==
The range transitions the separation from the Coachella Valley in the Colorado Desert on the south to the Mojave Desert on the north. The peaks vary in height from approximately . The range highpoint is Quail Mountain (California), elevation . Other peaks in the range include Mount Inspiration and Eureka Peak.

==Habitats==
Much of the central and eastern parts of the range are within Joshua Tree National Park. Big Morongo Canyon Preserve is located in the western end of the Little San Bernardino Mountains. The oasis here contains one of the ten largest cottonwood (&quot;Populus fremontii&quot;) and red willow (&quot;Salix laevigata&quot;) Riparian zone habitats in California. It was identified as an area of concern by the Bureau of Land Management in 1982. It also has the only native palm to California, &quot;Washingtonia filifera&quot;, or the Desert fan palm which is now common in artificial landscaping.

==Aqueduct==
The Colorado River Aqueduct, which provides water for Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and San Diego, runs along the southwest edge of the mountains.

It was succeeded in 2001 by the revised SD-160, which is equipped with alternating current motors and plug doors. The first orders for the SD-160 were placed in 2001, and production continued until 2013.

A related design is the SD-400/SD-460 high-floor light rail vehicle, which was initially built by a Siemens–Duewag joint venture. Siemens purchased Duewag in 1999, and assembled the SD-460 model alongside the SD-100/SD-160 in Florin, California.

The SD-100, SD-160, SD-400, and SD-460 were succeeded in the 2010s by newer LRV designs from Siemens, including the low-floor S700 and S70 and the high-floor S200. , most SD-100 and SD-160 vehicles remain in service with their original operators.

==History==
=== Orders ===
Production of the SD-100 was launched in 1992 when the Regional Transportation District, located in Denver, Colorado placed an order for 49 vehicles. The physical design was derived from the U2A car that was built between 1985 and 1991, but built with more modern mechanical equipment.

The first vehicles rolled off the production line at the Siemens facility in Florin, California in 1994, in time for the start of Light Rail service in Denver.

In 1993, the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System ordered 52 SD-100 cars as the San Diego Trolley system was expanded with a new line, these entered service in 1995. In Early 2021, they were being phased out and in 2023 have been retired from service being replaced by the newer Siemens S700 models. 

The final order for the SD-100 came in 1996, when the Utah Transit Authority, located in Salt Lake City placed an order for 23 vehicles that were delivered before the start of the TRAX light rail service in 1999.

In 2001, Siemens launched the SD-160 light rail vehicle, which used alternating current motors instead of direct current motors and outward sliding doors. Calgary Transit ordered 72 vehicles for its CTrain service, while the Utah Transit Authority ordered 17 vehicles as it expanded the TRAX light rail service. Deliveries to both agencies started in 2003.

The physical design of the SD-160 was updated in 2005 with a new end cap that changed the look of the front/rear of the train. The Edmonton Transit Service ordered 57 of the redesigned SD-160 vehicles and Calgary Transit ordered 38.

=== Service history ===
Starting in late 2017, Calgary has been sending SD-160s to Siemens&#x27; facility in Florin for mid-life refurbishment. The refurbished units contain several components and electronics already present on the S200, the successor to the SD-160. Along with some electronic improvements, they have been upgraded to be compatible with Calgary&#x27;s newer SD-160s, which were previously incompatible due to software differences. The refurbished fleet will eventually start to run with the newer units once the software has been adjusted to allow seamless operation.

Since 2022, 39 retired San Diego SD-100s were transferred to Metrotranvía Mendoza to supplement its existing fleet of Siemens–Duewag U2 which had also been purchased from San Diego.

Currently, the Metropolitan Transportation System (MTS) of San Diego, California is in the process of donating its Siemens SD100 pairs to the Mendoza Transportation Society, which has an urban metro-tram service that connects four departments (Las Heras, Ciudad , Godoy Cruz and Maipú) of the Province of Mendoza, Argentine Republic. The donation consists of 39 pairs of the mentioned model, until June 2023 9 of the total pairs that are operating and providing regular service in Mendoza, Argentina have arrived, while for the remaining 30 MTS is expected to withdraw them from their service between this year and the next in order to coordinate the shipping logistics of these pairs between the two cities.

The arrival of these formations is important for Mendoza since it is carrying out works to double the route of its metro-tram service (it is estimated that they will end in 2026 or 2027), the arrival at the Mendoza International Airport and the department of Luján de Cuyo stands out. In addition, due to its speed compared to other means of transport, it is increasingly chosen and presents a greater demand for people, which is why it is also planned to join two pairs to increase passenger capacity.

==Technical details==
The SD-160&#x27;s dimensions are by by and can be joined together to form trains of up to six cars in length. It is powered by four AC motors which provide a maximum of 580 kW. In most applications, the SD-160 has a maximum speed of . Some SD-160 trains, such as those operated in Denver, are configured to reach higher speeds of . It accelerates at and decelerates at , with emergency braking deceleration of . The brakes also serve as a generator, regenerating power back to a city&#x27;s electrical lines. The SD-160 has a passenger capacity of 236 passengers (standing) with 64 seats.

Compared to its predecessor, the Siemens–Duewag U2, the SD-160&#x27;s driver&#x27;s cabin is significantly larger, but its total length is still less than , allowing three vehicles to be combined and still be under the maximum length of a German streetcar train assembly. Each vehicle also features an onboard closed-circuit TV security camera system for increased passenger safety. Unlike the Siemens SD-100, the Siemens SD-160 does not use the bi-folded doors, instead using sliding doors similar to designs featured on the Siemens S70. In addition, both can be used together in mixed trains consisting of SD-100s and SD-160s. The new, streetcar-length S70 cars ordered for San Diego are designed to be compatible with the SD-100, allowing the SD-100 to operate in a mixed consist, sandwiched between two S70 cars.

The SD-160NG for Calgary have been taking over some features from the SD-460 series including IGBT equipment.

<text>Serranilla Bank ( and &quot;Placer de la Serranilla&quot;) is a partially submerged reef, with small uninhabited islets, in the western Caribbean Sea. It is situated about northeast of Punta Gorda, Nicaragua, and roughly southwest of Jamaica. The closest neighbouring land feature is Bajo Nuevo Bank, located to the east.

Serranilla Bank was first shown on Spanish maps in 1510. It is administered by Colombia as part of the department of San Andrés and Providencia. The reef is subject to a sovereignty dispute involving Colombia and the United States. A previous claim by Honduras was resolved in favor of Colombia when the two countries approved a treaty establishing their maritime boundaries. Jamaica&#x27;s claim was resolved when it established a joint regime area with overlapping maritime boundaries in 1993, but acknowledging Colombian control of Serranilla and Bajo Nuevo banks. In 2012, in regards to Nicaraguan claims to the islands, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) upheld Colombia&#x27;s sovereignty over the bank. However, the judgment does not analyze or mention the U.S. claim over the reef.

== Geography ==
Serranilla Bank is a former atoll, now a mostly submerged carbonate platform consisting of shallow reef environments. It is about in length and in width, covering an area of over , almost entirely under water. Three small cays and two rocks emerge above the water to form the bank&#x27;s islands. These are West Breaker, Middle Cay, East Cay, Beacon Cay, and Northeast Breaker. They are largely barren, with sparse vegetation of bushes and some trees. Many shipwrecks are located in its vicinity. The bank lacks coral reefs and has minimal sediment cover. Accretion of the bank is not keeping up with the rise in sea level. The southeastern portion is covered mainly by hardgrounds, while the rest of the bank is mostly covered by thin Halimeda sediments.

Beacon Cay is the largest islet in the Bank. It is overbuilt with small military facilities, which house a small rotating garrison of Colombian naval personnel. There is a lighthouse on a coral ledge in the southwest approach to the bank. It is a tall skeletal tower built atop a 3-storey crew residence. The lamp emits a focal plane beam of light as two white flashes every 20 seconds. The current lighthouse was first erected in 1982, and was reconstructed in May 2008 by the Colombian Ministry of Defence. It is currently maintained by the Colombian Navy and overseen by the state&#x27;s Maritime Authority.

== History ==
The Serranilla Bank was first shown on Spanish maps in 1510 as &quot;Placer de la Serranilla&quot;. It was mentioned by Louis-Michel Aury, whose ship was shipwrecked on it in 1820. In later history, it has been the subject of conflicting claims by several sovereign states; in most cases, the dispute stems from attempts by a state to expand its exclusive economic zone over the surrounding seas.

Between 1982 and 1986, Colombia maintained a formal agreement with Jamaica, which granted regulated fishing rights to Jamaican vessels within the territorial waters of Serranilla Bank and nearby Bajo Nuevo Bank. In November 1993, the two states agreed upon a maritime delimitation treaty establishing a &quot;Joint Regime Area&quot; to cooperatively manage and exploit living and non-living resources in designated waters between the two banks. However, the territorial waters immediately surrounding the cays themselves were excluded from the zone of joint-control, as Colombia considers these areas to be part of her coastal waters. The agreement came into force in March 1994.

Nicaragua formerly claimed all the islands on its continental shelf, covering an area of over 50,000 km2 in the Caribbean Sea, including the Serranilla Bank and all islands associated with the San Andrés and Providencia archipelagoes. It had persistently pursued this claim against Colombia in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), filing cases in both 2001 and 2007. Nicaragua formally accepted the ICJ&#x27;s 2012 ruling of Colombian sovereignty in a 2014 constitutional amendment.

The United States&#x27; claim was made in 1879 and 1880 under the Guano Islands Act by James W. Jennett. Most claims made by the U.S. over the guano islands in this region were officially renounced in a treaty with Colombia dated September 1972. But whether or not Serranilla Bank was included in the agreement is disputed. There is no specific mention of the feature in the treaty, and as per Article 7 of the treaty, only matters specifically mentioned in the document are subject to it. The U.S. considers the reef an insular area.

Honduras claimed Serranilla Bank as part of its national territory in Article 10 of its Constitution. In 1986, it agreed upon a maritime boundary demarcation with Colombia that excluded Honduras of any control over the bank or its surrounding waters. The ratification of this boundary on 20 December 1999 proved to be controversial within Honduras, as it ensured that the state implicitly recognized Colombia&#x27;s sovereignty over the claimed territory. At that time, Nicaragua disputed Honduras&#x27; legal right to hand over these areas before the ICJ. Despite the agreement with Colombia, the Honduran government has not officially renounced the claim in the Constitution.

== Notable fauna ==
In 1952, Serranilla Bank was the site of the last sighting of the now-extinct Caribbean monk seal.

<doc id="750894" wikidata="Q687194" url="?curid=750894" title="Nuclear lamina">
<text>The nuclear lamina is a dense (~30 to 100 nm thick) fibrillar network inside the nucleus of eukaryote cells. It is composed of intermediate filaments and membrane associated proteins. Besides providing mechanical support, the nuclear lamina regulates important cellular events such as DNA replication and cell division. Additionally, it participates in chromatin organization and it anchors the nuclear pore complexes embedded in the nuclear envelope.

The nuclear lamina is associated with the inner face of the inner nuclear membrane of the nuclear envelope, whereas the outer face of the outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum. The nuclear lamina is similar in structure to the nuclear matrix, that extends throughout the nucleoplasm.

== Structure and composition ==
The nuclear lamina consists of two components, lamins and nuclear lamin-associated membrane proteins. The lamins are type V intermediate filaments which can be categorized as either A-type (lamin A, C) or B-type (lamin B1, B2) according to homology of their DNA sequences, biochemical properties and cellular localization during the cell cycle. Type V intermediate filaments differ from cytoplasmic intermediate filaments in the way that they have an extended rod domain (42 amino acid longer), that they all carry a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at their C-terminus and that they display typical tertiary structures. Lamin polypeptides have an almost complete α-helical conformation with multiple α-helical domains separated by non-α-helical linkers that are highly conserved in length and amino acid sequence. Both the C-terminus and the N-terminus are non α-helical, with the C-terminus displaying a globular structure with immunoglobulin type folded motif. Their molecular weight ranges from 60 to 80 kilodaltons (kDa).
In the amino acid sequence of a nuclear lamin, there are also two sites present, flanking the central rod domain. A phosphorylation event at the onset of mitosis leads to a conformational change which causes the disassembly of the nuclear lamina. (discussed later in the article)

In the vertebrate genome, lamins are encoded by three genes. By alternative splicing, at least seven different polypeptides (splice variants) are obtained, some of which are specific for germ cells and play an important role in the chromatin reorganisation during meiosis. Not all organisms have the same number of lamin encoding genes; &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; for example has only 2 genes, whereas &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; has only one.

The presence of lamin polypeptides is a property of all animals.

The nuclear lamin-associated membrane proteins are either integral or peripheral membrane proteins. The most important are lamina associated polypeptides 1 and 2 (LAP1, LAP2), emerin, lamin B-receptor (LBR), otefin and MAN1. Due to their positioning within or their association with the inner membrane, they mediate the attachment of the nuclear lamina to the nuclear envelope.

== Role and interaction aspects ==

The nuclear lamina is assembled by interactions of two lamin polypeptides in which the α-helical regions are wound around each other to form a two stranded α-helical coiled-coil structure, followed by a head-to-tail association of the multiple dimers. The linearly elongated polymer is extended laterally by a side-by-side association of polymers, resulting in a 2D structure underlying the nuclear envelope. Next to providing mechanical support to the nucleus, the nuclear lamina plays an essential role in chromatin organization, cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, DNA repair, cell differentiation and apoptosis.

=== Chromatin organization ===

The non-random organization of the genome strongly suggests that the nuclear lamina plays a role in chromatin organization. It has been shown that lamin polypeptides have an affinity for binding chromatin through their α-helical (rod like) domains at specific DNA sequences called &quot;matrix attachment regions&quot; (MAR). A MAR has a length of approximately 300–1000 bp and has a high A/T content. Lamin A and B can also bind core histones through a sequence element in their tail domain.

Chromatin that interacts with lamina forms lamina-associated domains (LADs). The average length of human LADs is 0.1–10 MBp. LADs are flanked by CTCF-binding sites.

=== Cell cycle regulation ===

At the onset of mitosis (prophase, prometaphase), the cellular machinery is engaged in the disassembly of various cellular components including structures such as the nuclear envelope, the nuclear lamina and the nuclear pore complexes. This nuclear breakdown is necessary to allow the mitotic spindle to interact with the (condensed) chromosomes and to bind them at their kinetochores.

These different disassembly events are initiated by the cyclin B/Cdk1 protein kinase complex (MPF). Once this complex is activated, the cell is forced into mitosis, by the subsequent activation and regulation of other protein kinases or by direct phosphorylation of structural proteins involved in this cellular reorganisation. After phosphorylation by cyclin B/Cdk1, the nuclear lamina depolymerises and B-type lamins stay associated with the fragments of the nuclear envelope whereas A-type lamins remain completely soluble throughout the remainder of the mitotic phase.

The importance of the nuclear lamina breakdown at this stage is underlined by experiments where inhibition of the disassembly event leads to a complete cell cycle arrest.

At the end of mitosis, (anaphase, telophase) there is a nuclear reassembly which is highly regulated in time, starting with the association of &#x27;skeletal&#x27; proteins on the surface of the still partially condensed chromosomes, followed by nuclear envelope assembly. Novel nuclear pore complexes are formed through which nuclear lamins are actively imported by use of their NLS. This typical hierarchy raises the question whether the nuclear lamina at this stage has a stabilizing role or some regulative function, for it is clear that it plays no essential part in the nuclear membrane assembly around chromatin.

=== Embryonic development and cell differentiation ===

The presence of lamins in embryonic development is readily observed in various model organisms such as &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot;, the chick and mammals. In &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot;, five different types were identified which are present in different expression patterns during the different stages of the embryonic development. The major types are LI and LII, which are considered homologs of lamin B1 and B2. LA are considered homologous to lamin A and LIII as a B-type lamin. A fourth type exists and is germ cell specific.

In the early embryonic stages of the chick, the only lamins present are B-type lamins. In further stages, the expression pattern of lamin B1 decreases and there is a gradual increase in the expression of lamin A. Mammalian development seems to progress in a similar way. In the latter case as well it is the B-type lamins that are expressed in the early stages. Lamin B1 reaches the highest expression level, whereas the expression of B2 is relatively constant in the early stages and starts to increase after cell differentiation. With the development of the different kinds of tissue in a relatively advanced developmental stage, there is an increase in the levels of lamin A and lamin C.

These findings would indicate that in its most basic form, a functional nuclear lamina requires only B-type lamins.

===DNA replication===

Various experiments show that the nuclear lamina plays a part in the elongation phase of DNA replication. It has been suggested that lamins provide a scaffold, essential for the assembly of the elongation complexes, or that it provides an initiation point for the assembly of this nuclear scaffold.

Not only nuclear lamina associated lamins are present during replication, but free lamin polypeptides are present as well and seem to have some regulative part in the replication process.

===DNA repair===

Repair of DNA double-strand breaks can occur by either of two processes, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). A-type lamins promote genetic stability by maintaining levels of proteins that have key roles in NHEJ and HR. Mouse cells deficient for maturation of prelamin A show increased DNA damage and chromosome aberrations and are more sensitive to DNA damaging agents.

=== Apoptosis ===

Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is critical in tissue homeostasis, and in defending the organism against invasive entry of pathogens. Apoptosis is a highly regulated process in which the nuclear lamina is disassembled in an early stage.

In contrast to the phosphorylation-induced disassembly during mitosis, the nuclear lamina is degraded by proteolytic cleavage, and both the lamins and the nuclear lamin-associated membrane proteins are targeted. This proteolytic activity is performed by members of the caspase-protein family who cleave the lamins after aspartic acid (Asp) residues.

== Laminopathies ==

Defects in the genes encoding for nuclear lamin (such as lamin A and lamin B1) have been implicated in a variety of diseases (laminopathies) such as:
* Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy - A muscle wasting disease
* Progeria - Premature aging
* Restrictive dermopathy - A disease associated with extremely tight skin and other severe neonatal abnormalities

<doc id="750896" wikidata="Q2135809" url="?curid=750896" title="Frieda (Peanuts)">
<text>Frieda is a fictional character in the comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; by Charles Schulz. She is known for having naturally curly hair, of which she is extremely proud.

According to Schulz, Frieda&#x27;s character was inspired by his longtime friend Frieda Rich, a local artist whom he met while taking classes at the Art Instruction Schools in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She was a regular in &quot;Peanuts&quot; throughout the 1960s, but as newer characters were phased in towards the end of the decade, she began appearing less often, and she ceased to be a featured character after 1985, making only cameo appearances since then in various television specials. Her full name was revealed in the 2015 film &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot; as Frieda Rich, where she places 12th in the test results.

== Character outline ==

===Appearance===
Frieda has red &quot;naturally&quot; curly hair, of which she is quite proud. She was the only girl on Charlie Brown&#x27;s baseball team to not wear a cap because it would cover up her &quot;naturally&quot; curly hair. She often wears dresses, usually lavender in the TV specials and movies, but colored dark pink in &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot; and green in &quot;Peanuts,&quot; the TV series. She also wears saddle shoes.

===Personality and characteristics===

Frieda made her debut on March 6, 1961, when Linus introduced her to Charlie Brown. She was the eleventh permanent character to join the cast, and the first since Sally was born in 1959. She was initially presented, in both the advance press release and the first few strips, as Linus&#x27; schoolmate. She sat behind him in class, and although he considered her a friend, he also confessed that because she was such a chatterbox, he hadn&#x27;t heard a word their teacher said the whole semester. Her most prominent feature is her &quot;naturally&quot; curly hair, which she manages to work into every conversation, to the dismay of those around her. This self-love of her hair leads people to believe that she is rather vain. In turn, Frieda herself believes that the other girls are jealous of her hair (and often becomes disappointed or depressed when the other girls tell her that they&#x27;re &quot;not&quot; jealous of her hair), and also that &quot;people expect more of her&quot; because she has it. Nevertheless, enough people in the neighborhood like her that she got thirty valentines one year. Journalist Christopher Caldwell described her as, &quot;A fetching, kind and charming girl, who throws her deeper goodness away because she wants to be admired for such superficialities as &#x27;being a good conversationalist.&quot; She admitted that she used to be an avid reader until she started getting too busy.

Frieda Rich, the character&#x27;s namesake, was once asked whether she bore any character resemblances to her cartoon counterpart. She replied &quot;I recognize myself,&quot; adding as an example that while talking to Schulz once about Universalists and Congregationalists, she had jokingly called herself a &quot;conversationalist,&quot; and Schulz borrowed that for the strip.

==Relationships with other characters==

===Charlie Brown===
Frieda was usually nicer to Charlie Brown than most of the other girls in the neighborhood. Unlike Lucy, Patty, and Violet, she seemed to be mindful of his feelings and never teased him or put him down to his face (except for rare moments in the Peanuts specials), though she did get mad at him a few times. She eventually joined Charlie Brown&#x27;s baseball team as an outfielder, but refused to wear a baseball cap because it would hide her curly hair. She seemed to be one of the few characters that Charlie Brown felt confident enough to stand up to, as he did once when she was badgering Snoopy about chasing rabbits and he told her to mind her own business.

===Linus van Pelt===
Linus was the first character in the series that Frieda met. She sat behind him in school, and after they became friends, he introduced her to some of the other kids in the neighborhood. Not much is shown of their friendship beyond those strips that introduce her, but this early in their relationship, they seemed to look out for each other. Linus tried to protect her the first time she unintentionally upset Lucy (see below), and she in turn was one of the few kids who didn&#x27;t see his need for a security blanket as a bad thing, for which he was so grateful that he kissed her hand.

===Lucy van Pelt===
Frieda&#x27;s relationship with Lucy got off to a rocky start when Frieda, as usual, brought up her naturally curly hair almost as soon as they were introduced. Lucy became visibly offended by this, to the point where Linus (performing the introductions) felt it necessary to beg Lucy not to slug her. Despite Frieda&#x27;s &quot;faux pas&quot; the two girls eventually became friends, and when they played baseball for Charlie Brown&#x27;s team they often spent their time in the outfield chatting instead of paying attention to the game. Frieda is sometimes seen with Lucy&#x27;s mean girl clique with Patty and Violet.

===Schroeder===
Frieda has made Lucy jealous by leaning on Schroeder&#x27;s piano. Schroeder seemed to dislike her as much as he disliked Lucy when she didn&#x27;t know who Beethoven was (and after Frieda claimed that she was hanging around Schroeder because she was a music lover). In one strip and episode of &quot;The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show,&quot; Frieda commented to Lucy that Schroeder wasn&#x27;t very friendly. When Frieda attempted to kiss Schroeder while he was playing his piano, she was surprised when she found she had kissed Snoopy instead, and she ran away disgusted. On another occasion, a jealous Lucy (with encouragement from Snoopy) actually got into a physical altercation with Frieda when the former discovered her leaning on Schroeder&#x27;s piano, Lucy&#x27;s usual domain. Lucy ends up winning the fight, as can be seen in the last panel where a battered, injured Lucy triumphantly shakes hands with Snoopy. Schroeder does 
have feelings for Frieda. Once he did give Frieda a valentine, which he was bashful about. The valentine had a picture drawn by Schroeder of her leaning on his piano. In another strip, Schroeder and Charlie Brown were talking about Frieda. However, Frieda does not return his affection. Another time, Frieda and Lucy decided to work together in an attempt to get Schroeder to like Lucy.

===Snoopy===
Out of all the characters, Frieda has the most trouble getting along with Snoopy, whom she frequently accuses of being &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;useless.&quot; She has strong pre-conceived notions of what a beagle should be doing with its time; she wants Snoopy to be a working dog and a hunter (especially a hunter of rabbits), and not spend so much time sleeping on top of his doghouse. She often comes over and tries to goad Snoopy into chasing rabbits with her, either by threat or persuasion, which he is always reluctant to do. If he does consent to &quot;hunt,&quot; he&#x27;ll either it and only pretend to look for the rabbits, or if he does find rabbits he&#x27;ll frolic and play with them once he&#x27;s out of Frieda&#x27;s sight. Once, in a fit of frustration, she reported Snoopy&#x27;s behavior to the &quot;Head Beagle,&quot; which led to him being found guilty of not meeting his rabbit quota and left the neighborhood kids mad at her for turning him in. In the movie &quot;Snoopy Come Home&quot;, she said at Snoopy&#x27;s farewell party: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry to see you go, Snoopy. I&#x27;m sorry we never caught any rabbits.&quot;

===Faron===
Faron is a male cat that Frieda&#x27;s mother bought for her. Frieda believed Snoopy was too smug for his own good, and decided that having a cat in the neighborhood would take him down a few notches. Her choice of cat ended up being more comical than intimidating; Faron is seemingly boneless, and she carries him everywhere, draped over her arms. He seemed to be as unpopular with the other neighborhood kids as he was with Snoopy; Frieda tried to find someone to hold Faron for her whenever she needed to go somewhere like the library that wouldn&#x27;t allow cats inside, but she usually had a lot of trouble finding a willing volunteer. A running gag included Charlie Brown, Linus, and even Snoopy getting trapped into holding Faron while Frieda ran her errands.

Faron was named for country music singer Faron Young, whom Schulz &quot;admired very much,&quot; but he only made a few appearances in the strip. Schulz was not satisfied with his own drawing of a cat; also, he wanted to continue exploring Snoopy&#x27;s fantasy life, and felt like having a cat in the strip brought Snoopy back to being too much of a real dog. Schulz didn&#x27;t even draw Faron for his last appearance, in which the cat got stuck in a tree.

Faron once spoke English to Snoopy in a thought balloon, making him one of the few non-human or non-dog animals to do so.

==Last appearance==
Although Frieda was a regular character in the 1960s, her appearances gradually began dwindling. According to Charles Schulz, &quot;I realized that Frieda added relatively little to the strip and had few character traits beyond bragging about her hair and her obsession with getting Snoopy to chase rabbits.&quot; After her last major storyline in October 1969 (after reporting Snoopy to the Head Beagle), she only featured in 10 further strips between 1970 and 1985, often with over a year between appearances. Her penultimate appearance was in 1978, after which she disappearing for seven years before her final appearance on November 22, 1985.

Frieda also continued to make appearances in the animated &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials and the Saturday morning series &quot;The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show&quot;, even being mentioned in the lyrics of the latter&#x27;s theme song. She is also featured as an unseen character in the musical &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;, being mentioned several times, and yelled to at one point after Lucy heard one of Charlie Brown&#x27;s secrets. Also in this show, her characteristic fondness for hunting rabbits is assumed by Sally. Frieda appeared in 150 strips and appeared for the last time on November 22, 1985. Frieda appears in &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot; (2015) directed by Steve Martino. She is voiced by Francesca Capaldi who also voices The Little Red-Haired Girl in the movie. Frieda also makes multiple appearances in the &quot;Peanuts (TV series)&quot;.

<doc id="750900" wikidata="Q1257783" url="?curid=750900" title="Bajo Nuevo Bank">
<text>Bajo Nuevo Bank, also known as the Petrel Islands (), is a small, uninhabited reef with some small grass-covered islets, located in the western Caribbean Sea at , with a lighthouse on Low Cay at . The closest neighboring land feature is Serranilla Bank, located to the west.

The reef was first shown on Dutch maps dating to 1634 but was given its present name in 1654. Bajo Nuevo was rediscovered by the English pirate John Glover in 1660. The reef is now subject to a sovereignty dispute involving Colombia and the United States. On 19 November 2012, regarding Nicaraguan claims to the islands, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) found, unanimously, that the Republic of Colombia has sovereignty over both Bajo Nuevo and Serranilla Banks, although the judgment does not analyze or mention the competing claims of Honduras or the United States.

==Geography==
Bajo Nuevo Bank is about long and wide. The satellite image shows two distinct atoll-like structures separated by a deep channel wide at its narrowest point. The larger southwestern reef complex measures northeast-southwest, and is up to wide, covering an area of about . The reef partially dries on the southern and eastern sides. The smaller northeastern reef complex measures east-west and is up to wide, covering an area of . The land area is minuscule by comparison.

The most prominent cay is Low Cay, in the southwestern atoll. It is long and wide (about ), no more than high, and barren. It is composed of broken coral, driftwood, and sand. The light beacon on Low Cay is a metal tower, painted white with a red top. It emits a focal plane beam of light as two white flashes of light every 15 seconds. The beacon was erected in 1982, and reconstructed by the Colombian Ministry of Defence in February 2008. It is currently maintained by the Colombian Navy and overseen by the state&#x27;s Maritime Authority.

==Territorial dispute==
Bajo Nuevo Bank is the subject of conflicting claims made by several sovereign states. In most cases, the dispute stems from attempts by a state to expand its exclusive economic zone over the surrounding seas.

Colombia currently claims the area as part of the department of Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina. Naval patrols in the area are carried out by the San Andrés fleet of the Colombian Navy. Colombia maintains that it has claimed these territories since 1886 as part of the geographic archipelago of San Andrés and Providencia. This date is disputed by other claimant states, who argue that Colombia had not claimed the territory by name until recently.

Jamaica&#x27;s claim has been resolved since entering into several bilateral agreements with Colombia. Between 1982 and 1986, the two states maintained a formal agreement which granted regulated fishing rights to Jamaican vessels within the territorial waters of Bajo Nuevo and nearby Serranilla Bank. Jamaica&#x27;s signing of this treaty was regarded by critics as a &quot;de facto&quot; recognition of Colombian sovereignty over the two banks. However, the treaty is now extinguished, as Colombia declined to renew it upon its expiration in August 1986.

In November 1993, Colombia and Jamaica agreed upon a maritime delimitation treaty establishing the Joint Regime Area to cooperatively manage and exploit living and non-living resources in designated waters between the two aforementioned banks. However, the territorial waters immediately surrounding the cays themselves were excluded from the zone of joint-control, as Colombia considers these areas to be part of its coastal waters. The exclusion circles were defined in the chart attached to the treaty as &quot;Colombia&#x27;s territorial sea in Serranilla and Bajo Nuevo&quot;. The agreement came into force in March 1994.

Nicaragua formerly claimed all the islands on its continental shelf, covering an area of over 50,000 km2 in the Caribbean Sea, including Bajo Nuevo Bank and all islands associated with the San Andrés and Providencia archipelagoes. It had persistently pursued this claim against Colombia in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), filing cases in both 2001 and 2007. The dispute originated in the debated validity and applicability of the Esguerr–Bárcenas treaty, exchanged with Colombia in March 1928. Nicaragua formally accepted the ICJ&#x27;s 2012 ruling of Colombian sovereignty in a 2014 constitutional amendment.

The United States claim was made on 22 November 1869 by James W. Jennett under the provisions of the Guano Islands Act. Most claims made by the U.S. over the guano islands in this region were officially renounced in a treaty with Colombia dated September 1972. However, Bajo Nuevo Bank was not mentioned in the treaty, and Article 7 of the treaty states that matters not specifically mentioned in the treaty are not subject to its terms. The United States considers the bank an insular area.

Honduras, before its ratification of a maritime boundary treaty with Colombia on 20 December 1999, had previously also laid claim to Bajo Nuevo and nearby Serranilla Bank. Both states agreed upon a maritime demarcation in 1986 that excluded Honduras from any control over the banks or their surrounding waters. This bilateral treaty ensured that Honduras implicitly recognized Colombia&#x27;s sovereignty over the disputed territories. Nicaragua disputed Honduras&#x27;s legal right to hand over these areas before the ICJ.

<doc id="750901" wikidata="Q4969246" url="?curid=750901" title="Britain Goes Wild with Bill Oddie">
<text>Britain Goes Wild with Bill Oddie is a live BBC TV show, broadcast nightly, Monday – Thursday, from 31 May 2004 to 17 June 2004.

Following on from the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Wild in Your Garden&quot;, presenters Bill Oddie, Kate Humble and Simon King spent one hour each evening, describing wildlife and presenting live action from a number of hidden cameras in or near nest boxes, as well as a badger sett. Short, pre-filmed documentary pieces were also included. While Oddie and Humble both presented the series from an organic farm in Devon, England, where the nestboxes and sett were located, King worked on location – at Bass Rock observing gannets in the first week, at a quarry observing a family of peregrine falcons in the second week, at the London Wetlands Centre in the third week, and joining Oddie and Humble on the farm for the final programme.

It set a record for its timeslot of 8pm on BBC Two on its first evening of broadcast of 3.4 million viewers – one million more than the Channel 4 programme showing at that time. It also created a run on nest boxes for wild birds and bumble bees, bird baths and bird feed from suppliers, likened to the Delia power phenomenon created when Delia Smith mentioned the tools and ingredients she was using on her cooking programme &quot;Delia&#x27;s How to Cook&quot;.

Oddie presented an update of some of the featured animals later in 2004.

A sequel, &quot;Springwatch with Bill Oddie&quot;, was broadcast in 2005.

The series&#x27; theme music was composed by David Poore, and is still used as the theme for &quot;Springwatch&quot; and &quot;Autumnwatch&quot;.

<doc id="750906" wikidata="Q1283437" url="?curid=750906" title="Edelweiss (grape)">
<text>Edelweiss is a very winter-hardy wine grape variety, pale green in color, derived from crossing the Minnesota 78 and Ontario grapes. It was developed by pioneering American grape breeder Elmer Swenson in 1980 in cooperation with the University of Minnesota. The clusters are large and rather loose, weighing a pound or more. Early picking of the grape is essential for making a wine. Should Edelweiss not be harvested early, the completely ripe &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot; flavoring becomes too strong for the palate of most. Edelweiss was first developed as a table grape. This variety bears the Minnesota winters, but mulching is encouraged. During this process be wary when tying the shoots together because they break easily. Edelweiss has strong resistance to grape disease and fungus and can tolerate negative thirty-five degree temperatures.

Nebraska&#x27;s premiere grape is Edelweiss. The wineries in the state have won numerous awards nationwide with their Edelweiss wines.

<doc id="750907" wikidata="Q634551" url="?curid=750907" title="A. N. R. Robinson">
<text>Arthur Napoleon Raymond Robinson (16 December 1926 – 9 April 2014; known as A. N. R. or &quot;Ray&quot; Robinson), was a Trinidadian politician who was the third president of the country, serving from 19 March 1997 to 17 March 2003. He was also Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s third prime minister, serving in that capacity from 18 December 1986 to 17 December 1991. He is recognized for his proposal that eventually led to the founding of the International Criminal Court.

Robinson was the first active politician to be elected to the presidency, and was the first presidential candidate who was not elected unopposed (the Opposition People&#x27;s National Movement nominated Justice Anthony Lucky as its candidate for president). President Robinson sparked controversy in his term in office when he refused to appoint certain senators recommended by Prime Minister Basdeo Panday following the elections in 2000 and in 2001 when he appointed the Leader of the Opposition Patrick Manning to the position of prime minister after a tied election.

==Early life==

Robinson was born in Tobago in 1926 to James and Isabella Robinson. He was educated at Castara Methodist School (where his father served as head master) and Bishop&#x27;s High School, where he obtained a Higher School Certificate with distinction in Latin and competed for an Island Scholarship. He obtained a Bachelor of Laws degree from London University as an external student. In 1951 he left for the United Kingdom, where he was called to the bar at Inner Temple and obtained a degree in philosophy, politics and economics from St. John&#x27;s College, Oxford. Robinson returned to Trinidad and Tobago, where he practised as a Barrister-at-Law.

Robinson married Patricia Rawlins and had two children, David and Ann-Margaret.

==Political life==
Robinson was a founding member of the People&#x27;s National Movement and served in the parliament of the West Indies Federation between 1958 and 1960. In 1961 he was elected to the Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago, serving as member of parliament for Tobago. He was the country&#x27;s Minister of Finance from 1961 to 1966. Following the Black Power Revolution in 1970, Robinson resigned from the People&#x27;s National Movement and formed the Action Committee of Dedicated Citizens, which joined forced with the Democratic Labour Party to contest the 1971 General Elections; Robinson and the DLP ended up boycotting the elections in protest over the use of voting machines.

After the 1971 election, the Action Committee of Dedicated Citizens became the Democratic Action Congress which won both Tobago seats in the 1976 General Elections. As leader as the DAC, Robinson worked for internal self-government for Tobago, culminating in the passage of the Tobago House of Assembly Act in 1980. Robinson resigned from Parliament to contest the Tobago House of Assembly elections, and became the Chairman of the Assembly following victory by the DLP. He had also proposed the idea of the International Court.
In 1981 Robinson allied with the United Labour Front under the leadership of Basdeo Panday, and the Tapia House Movement, under the leadership of Lloyd Best, to form the National Alliance for Reconstruction. It entered into an alliance with the Organisation for National Reconstruction, under the leadership of Karl Hudson-Phillips, to successfully fight the 1983 Trinidad and Tobago local elections. Building on this victory the four parties combined to form the National Alliance for Reconstruction.

ANR Robinson went on to become prime minister through the National Alliance For Reconstruction. Shortly after assuming the position, he dismissed Basdeo Panday, Kelvin Ramnath, Trevor Sudama and John Humphrey from the Cabinet. However, Robinson subsequently lost the 1991 elections. He rejoined the UNC Administration as a coalition member representing the NAR. Panday later offered to nominate him to become the next President of Trinidad and Tobago.

Robinson was instrumental in the creation of the International Criminal Court. In 1989, he asked Benjamin Ferencz and Robert Kurt Woetzel to assist in drafting a proposal for the UN General Assembly to ask the UN&#x27;s International Law Commission to study the possibility of creating the International Criminal Court. The resolution was presented on behalf of Trinidad and Tobago at the UN General Assembly in June 1989, leading to the adoption of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in July 1998 and creation of the International Criminal Court on 1 July 2002.

===Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt===
During the 1990 &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; attempt by the Jamaat al Muslimeen, Robinson and much of his cabinet were held hostage for six days by gunmen under the leadership of Yasin Abu Bakr. When instructed to order the army to stop firing on the Red House, where they were held hostage, Robinson instead instructed them to &quot;attack with full force,&quot; an action which led to him getting beaten by his captors. He was also shot in his leg.

==Illness and death==
Robinson suffered from a number of ailments including a stroke and prostate complications and was hospitalised at St. Clair Medical Hospital after he complained of feeling ill. Following an illness of several months, he died at St. Clair Medical Centre at about 6:00 am on 9 April 2014. In reaction, Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar said that he was &quot;one of our nation&#x27;s outstanding sons...but the legacy he leaves behind shall surely live on to inspire today&#x27;s and tomorrow&#x27;s generations.&quot;

== Honours ==

In 1997 Robinson was awarded the Trinity Cross, at that time the highest order of Trinidad and Tobago.

During the investiture of President Thomas Boni Yayi of Benin as a titled Yoruba chieftain on 20 December 2008, the reigning Ooni of Ile-Ife, Nigeria, Olubuse II, referred to President Robinson and his wife as previous recipients of the same royal honour.

In May 2011, the airport in Tobago was renamed the A. N. R. Robinson International Airport, replacing the name &quot;Crown Point International Airport&quot;.

In November 2011, A. N. R. Robinson was the recipient of Tobago&#x27;s highest award, the Tobago Medal of Honour.

<doc id="750909" wikidata="Q928076" url="?curid=750909" title="Introspective">
<text>Introspective is the third studio album by English synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys, released on 10 October 1988 by Parlophone. It received generally positive reviews from critics.

==Background==
The album was unusual in that it reversed the typical process by which pop/dance acts released singles. Instead of releasing an album of regular-length (3–5-minute) songs, then releasing lengthy remixes of those songs on subsequent singles, &quot;Introspective&quot; was released as an LP consisting of songs that all lasted six minutes or more. Tracks released as singles like &quot;Always on My Mind&quot; and &quot;Domino Dancing&quot; had been issued as shorter, more radio-friendly mixes prior to the album. None was released as a radio single in the same form as it appeared on the album. It was also the case for the two other singles &quot;Left to My Own Devices&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot;.

Of the six tracks on the album, only two were written specifically for the album—&quot;Left to My Own Devices&quot; and &quot;Domino Dancing&quot;. &quot;Always on My Mind&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot; are cover versions, &quot;I Want a Dog&quot; is a song that previously appeared as B-side of the single &quot;Rent&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Not Scared&quot; is their own version of a song they had written for Patsy Kensit&#x27;s pop group Eighth Wonder. &quot;Always on My Mind&quot; was re-recorded for this album and mixed with &quot;In My House&quot;, a new acid-house track on the album which expanded the lyric.

&quot;Introspective&quot; was re-released in 2001 (as were the duo&#x27;s first six albums) as &quot;Introspective/Further Listening 1988–1989&quot;. The re-released version was digitally remastered and came with a second disc of B-sides and previously unreleased material from around the time of the album&#x27;s original release. Yet another re-release followed on 9 February 2009, under the title &quot;Introspective: Remastered&quot;. This version contains only the six tracks on the original. With the 2009 re-release, the 2001 two-disc re-release was discontinued. On 2 March 2018, the two-disc version of the album was re-released, this time featuring newly remastered versions of the tracks. It was also released as a digital download and on vinyl.

Neil Tennant, in a speech he gave to the Oxford Union, said he regretted releasing &quot;Introspective&quot; so soon after &quot;Actually&quot; as he felt the 12-inch nature of the songs may have put some fans off the band and this probably impacted on the sales of &quot;Behaviour&quot;, the subsequent album critically regarded as the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; finest album but commercially one of their least successful. Nevertheless, &quot;Introspective&quot; remains, according to Tennant, the best-selling Pet Shop Boys album internationally. It peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart, behind U2&#x27;s &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;.

<text>Wild In Your Garden was a live BBC Television show, broadcast in 2003.

Presenters Bill Oddie, Kate Humble (both in a suburban garden in Bristol, England) and Simon King (mostly on location nearby) presented live action from a number of hidden cameras in or near nest boxes, badger setts and the like. Short, pre-filmed documentary pieces were also included. It was shown twice a day, but at different times, sometimes after midnight.

A sequel, &quot;Britain Goes Wild with Bill Oddie&quot;, was broadcast in 2004 and the format eventually developed into the &quot;Springwatch&quot; series.</text><links>

<text>Victor-Maurice, comte de Broglie (12 March 16474 August 1727) was a French Royal Army officer.

Victor-Maurice de Broglie was born in the De Broglie house, a noble family originally from Piedmont. He was the son of François-Marie, comte de Broglie and Angelique de Vassal, Countess of Favria. After the death of his father he inherited the countships of Revello and de Broglie, the marquisate of Senonches and also received the Government of La Bassee, near Lille.

He served under Condé, Turenne, and other commanders of the age of Louis XIV in the Franco-Dutch War and other conflicts. He was with Turenne during the Frond in the 1654 campaign to take Stenay.

He was named &quot;maréchal de camp&quot; in 1676, lieutenant-general in 1688, and finally marshal of France in 1724, just three years before his death.

He had three sons, one of whom predeceased him. The second son, Charles-Guillaume, marquis de Broglie, was his heir, while the third son, François-Marie, a general and a marshal of France like his father, became the first Duke of Broglie.

<text>Grand prince or great prince (feminine: grand princess or great princess) (; ; ; ; ) is a title of nobility ranked in honour below Emperor, equal to Archduke, King, Grand duke and Prince-Archbishop; above a Sovereign Prince and Duke.

Grand duke is the usual and established, though not literal, translation of these terms in English and Romance languages, which do not normally use separate words for a &quot;prince&quot; who reigns as a monarch (e.g., Albert II, Prince of Monaco) and a &quot;prince&quot; who does not reign, but belongs to a monarch&#x27;s family (e.g., Prince George of Wales). Some Slavic (Królewicz), Germanic, Dutch, and Scandinavian languages do use separate words to express this concept, and in those languages &quot;grand prince&quot; is understood as a distinct title (for a cadet of a dynasty) from &quot;grand duke&quot; (hereditary ruler ranking below a king). Some recent sources also use Archduke.

The title of &quot;grand prince&quot; was once used for the sovereign of a &quot;grand principality&quot;. The last titular grand principalities vanished in 1917 and 1918, the territories being united into other monarchies or becoming republics. Already at that stage, the grand principalities of Lithuania, Transylvania and Finland had been for centuries under rulers of other, bigger monarchies, so that the title of &quot;grand prince&quot; was superseded by the titles &quot;king&quot; and &quot;emperor&quot; there. Ivan IV of Moscow in the 16th century was the last sovereign to reign whose highest title was &quot;velikiy knyaz&quot;, until he assumed the rank of Tsar of Russia. &quot;Velikiy knyaz&quot; is a Russian title that is often translated as &quot;grand prince&quot; because there are no better equivalents in European languages. When Ivan IV&#x27;s pre-tsarist title is referred to in English, however, it is usually as &quot;grand duke&quot;.

&quot;Velikiy knjaz&quot; is also a Russian courtesy title for members of the family of the Russian tsar (from the 17th century), although the people who held this title were not sovereigns.

==Terminology in Slavic and Baltic languages==
Velikiy knyaz (Meaning closest to Grand Prince but was generally translated as Grand Duke in state documents written in Latin), used in the Slavic and Baltic languages, was the title of a medieval monarch who headed a more-or-less loose confederation whose constituent parts were ruled by lesser knyazs ( often translated as &quot;princes&quot; ) . Those great knyazs&#x27; (grand princes&#x27;) title and position was at the time sometimes translated as king, though kings, princes, and dukes seemingly initially did not exist amongst proto-Slavs and Balts with Knyaz being a Germanic loanword adopted by tribal chieftains. Although, the Slavic &#x27; and the Baltic &#x27; (nowadays usually translated as prince) are similar to kings in terms of ruling and duties. However, a velikiy knyaz (grand prince) was usually only &quot;&quot; within a dynasty, primogeniture not governing the order of succession. All knyazs (princes) of the family were equally eligible to inherit a crown (for example, succession might be through agnatic seniority or rotation). Often other members of the dynasty ruled some constituent parts of the monarchy/country. An established use of the title was in the Kievan Rus&#x27; and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (from the 14th century). Thus, &quot;Veliki Knjaz&quot; has been more like a regional &quot;high king&quot; (but without international recognition as such) than a &quot;grand duke&quot;, at least, originally and was not subordinated to any other authority as more western (for example Polish) Grand Dukes were. As these countries expanded territorially and moved towards primogeniture and centralization, their rulers acquired more elevated titles.

==Use in the Middle Ages==

===Hungary===
&quot;Grand Prince&quot; () was the title used by contemporary sources to name the leader of the federation of the Hungarian tribes in the 10th century. Constantine VII mentioned Árpád in his book &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; as &#x27;, while Bruno of Querfurt referred to Géza in his &quot;Sancti Adalberti Pragensis episcopi et martyris vita altera&quot; as &#x27;. It was used by Géza and his son and heir Stephen of Hungary.

===Serbia===
In the Middle Ages, the Serbian &quot;veliki župan&quot; (велики жупан) was the supreme chieftain in the multi-tribal society. The title signifies overlordship, as the leader of lesser chieftains titled &quot;župan&quot;. It was used by the Serb rulers in the 11th and 12th centuries. In Greek, it was known as &quot;archizoupanos&quot; (ἄρχιζουπάνος), &quot;megazoupanos&quot; (μεγαζουπάνος) and &quot;megalos zoupanos&quot; (μεγάλος ζουπάνος).

In the 1090s, Vukan became the &quot;veliki župan&quot; in Raška (Rascia). Stefan Nemanja expelled his brother Tihomir in 1168 and assumed the title of &quot;veliki župan&quot;, as described in the Charter of Hilandar (). A Latin document used &quot;mega iupanus&quot; for King Stefan the First-Crowned (). Afterwards, it was a high noble rank with notable holders such as Altoman Vojinović ( 1335–59).

=== Kievan Rus&#x27; and successor states ===
==== Kievan Rus&#x27; ====
==== Later Rus&#x27; principalites ====

In the 13th century, the monarchs of other Rus&#x27; principalities which originated as appanages of Kiev, such as Vladimir-Suzdal and Galicia-Volhynia, started claiming the title of &quot;grand prince&quot; as well. Next were Moscow, Tver&#x27;, Yaroslavl&#x27;, Ryazan&#x27;, Smolensk, and others, each claiming to be the legitimate successors of the former Kievan Rus&#x27; realm. From the 15th century, the Grand Princes of Moscow (Muscovy) started adding &quot;and of all Rus&#x27;&quot; to their title until Ivan IV proclaimed himself &quot;tsar of Russia&quot; in 1547.

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===

The Lithuanian title &#x27; was used by the rulers of Lithuania, and after 1569, it was one of two main titles used by the monarch of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The kings of Poland from the Swedish House of Vasa also used this title for their non-Polish territories. This Lithuanian title was sometimes latinized as &#x27; or Grand Duke.

==Modern use==

In 1582, King Johan III of Sweden added Grand Prince of Finland to the subsidiary titles of the Swedish kings, however without any territorial or civic implications, Finland already being a fully integrated part of the Swedish realm.

The Holy Roman Empire ruling house of Habsburg instituted a similar Grand Principality in Transylvania (&quot;Siebenburgen&quot;) in 1765.

After the Russian conquests, the title continued to be used by the Russian emperor in his role as ruler of Lithuania (1793–1918) and of autonomous Finland (1809–1917) as well. His titulary included, among other titles: &quot;Grand Duke of Smolensk, Volynia, Podolia&quot;, &quot;Lord and Grand Duke of Nizhni Novgorod, Chernigov&quot; etc.

A more literal translation of the Russian title than &quot;grand duke&quot; would be &quot;great prince&quot; — especially in the pre-Petrine era — but the term is neither standard nor widely used in English. In German, however, a Russian Grand Duke was known as a &#x27;, in Swedish as a &quot;Storfurste&quot; and in Latin as &#x27;.

Grand prince remained as a dynastic title for the senior members of the Romanov dynasty in Russia&#x27;s imperial era. The title &quot;&quot;, its use finally formalized by Alexander III, then belonged to children and male-line grandchildren of the emperors of Russia. The daughters and paternal granddaughters of the emperors used a different version of the title (, &quot;Velikaya Knyazhna&quot;) from females who obtained it as the consorts of Russian &quot;grand princes&quot; (, &quot;Velikie Knyagini&quot;). In modern times a Russian Grand Duke or Grand Duchess is styled &quot;Imperial Highness&quot;.

The title grand prince was also used for the heir apparent to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.

<text>Beta is a winter-hardy variety of North American grape derived from a cross of the &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot;-based cultivar Concord and a selection of &quot;Vitis riparia&quot;, the wild riverbank grape, called Carver. It is an extremely cold-hardy grape that is self-fertile. This variety is grown successfully in Finland and was widely planted in Minnesota in the early 20th century. It ripens in late September in New York State. It bears dark, blue-black fruit that is used for jellies, fruit juices, etc., but rarely for wine.

==History==
Beta was released by Louis Suelter, and named for his wife. Because of this, the proper pronunciation is actually &quot;Bett-uh&quot;, but the name is more commonly assumed to follow the pronunciation of the Greek letter. Suelter released a number of other cultivars from the same cross, including the equally winter-hardy Suelter grape.

<text>The Masalit (Masalit: &quot;masala/masara&quot;; ) are an ethnic group inhabiting western Sudan and eastern Chad. They speak the Masalit language.

==Overview==
The Masalit primarily live in Geneina, the capital of West Darfur, though a few thousand also live in Al Qadarif State in eastern Sudan, and in South Darfur. According to &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, there were 462,000 total Masalit speakers as of 2011, of whom 350,000 resided in Sudan.

Masalit tradition traces their origins to Tunisia. After migrating through Chad, they eventually settled in present-day Sudan.

Before 1874, the Masalit were divided between multiple polities in the region such as the Wadai Sultanate and the Sultanate of Darfur. However, after the conquest of the Sultanate of Darfur by the Ottomans and Egyptians in 1874, the Masalit were unified into a Sultanate by Hajjam Hasab Allah. However, Hajjam&#x27;s rule was seen by the Masalit population as oppressive. Thus, he was ousted in 1883 by Ismail Abdel Nebi, who took control of the Sultanate. In 1895 the Masalit Sultanate was invaded by the Mahdist State; the Sultan escaped capture by putting himself under the protection of the sultan of Wadai. The fall of the Mahdist state in 1898 did not bring peace to
western Darfur. &#x27;Ali Dinar&#x27;s accession to the throne of a restored Darfur Sultanate, and his claims of sovereignty over all small frontier
states, ushered in a new period of conflict. In 1903 &#x27;Ali Dinar attacked and defeated the Masalit, and captured and executed their sultan. Subsequently
the Sultan&#x27;s brother, Taj al-Din Isma&#x27;il, rallied the Masalit forces and drove out the Darfuri army. The peace treaty of 1908 left
&#x27;Ali Dinar in &quot;de jure&quot; control of the Masalit, but in reality it placed Taj al-Din at the head of a small but
proud Masalit state under the vassalage of the Sultanate of Darfur.

Masalit tribes were among the rebel groups that fought against the Sudanese central government and the pro-government Janjaweed militia during the War in Darfur that started in 2003. Reprisals and ethnic cleansing led to an estimated 170,000 deaths over two years, and intermittent violence persisted afterwards. As part of the 2023 civil war in Sudan, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) (a successor to the Janjaweed) launched a new campaign of ethnic cleansing in Darfur. In June 2023, Khamis Abakar, a Masalit and the governor of West Darfur, accused the RSF of genocide; he was later killed.

==Language==
The Masalit speak the Masalit language, which belongs to the Maban language group of the Nilo-Saharan language family.

Masalit is divided into several dialects, with the variety spoken in South Darfur differing from that of West Darfur. The northern Masalit dialect is spoken to the east and north of Geneina.

The Masalit language is most closely related to the Marfa, Maba and Karanga languages. It shares 45% of its vocabulary with Marfa, 42% with Maba, and 36% with Karanga.

Most Masalit are bilingual in Arabic, except in the central area, where the Nilo-Saharan vernacular is primarily spoken.

Masalit is written using the Latin script.

== Culture ==
The Masalit are also known as the Kana Masaraka/Masaraka, Mesalit, and Massalit. They are primarily subsistence agriculturalists, cultivating peanuts and millet. Further south in their territory, they grow various other crops, including sorghum. The typical Masalit dwelling is conical in shape, and constructed of wood and thatch.

The Masalit are Muslim and their religious practices incorporate traditional beliefs and customs. Islam first appeared in the area around the 17th century with the arrival of wandering Muslim mystics.

==Genetics==
Maternally, the Masalit entirely belong to African-based derivatives of the macrohaplogroup L according to Hassan (2010). Of these mtDNA clades, the L0a1 (14.6%) and L1c (12.2%) lineages are most frequent. 

According to Hassan et al. (2008), around 71.9% of Masalit are carriers of the E1b1b paternal haplogroup. Of these, 73.9% bear the V32 subclade. Approximately 6.3% also belong to the haplogroup J1. This points to significant patrilineal gene flow from neighbouring Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations. The remaining Masalit are primarily carriers of the A3b2 lineage (18.8%), which is instead common among Nilotes.

This altogether suggests that the genetic introgression into the Masalit&#x27;s ancestral population was asymmetrical, occurring primarily through Afro-Asiatic-speaking males rather than females.

<doc id="750923" wikidata="Q3326740" url="?curid=750923" title="People's National Movement">
<text>The People&#x27;s National Movement (PNM) is the longest-serving and oldest active political party in Trinidad and Tobago. The party has dominated national and local politics for much of Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s history, contesting all elections since 1956 serving as the nation&#x27;s governing party or on four occasions, the main opposition. It is one out of the country&#x27;s two main political parties. There have been four PNM Prime Ministers and multiple ministries. The party espouses the principles of liberalism and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the political spectrum.

The party was founded in 1956 by Eric Williams, who took inspiration from Norman Manley&#x27;s democratic socialist centre-left People&#x27;s National Party in Jamaica. It won the 1956 General Elections and went on to hold power for an unbroken 30 years. After the death of Williams in 1981, George Chambers led the party. The party was defeated in the 1986 General Elections, losing 33–3 to the National Alliance for Reconstruction (NAR). Under the leadership of Patrick Manning, the party returned to power in 1991 following the 1990 attempted coup by the Jamaat al-Muslimeen, but lost power in 1995 to the United National Congress (UNC). The PNM lost again to the UNC in the 2000 General Elections, but a split in the UNC forced new elections in 2001. These elections resulted in an 18–18 tie between the PNM and the UNC, and President Arthur N. R. Robinson appointed Manning as Prime Minister. Manning was unable to elect a Speaker of the House of Representatives, but won an outright majority in new elections held in 2002 and again in 2007, before losing power in 2010. It returned to power in the 2015 general election under Keith Rowley where it had its best result since the 1981 general election, winning 51.7 percent of the popular vote and 23 of the 41 seats. In the 2020 general election, they won the popular vote and a majority in the House of Representatives, winning 22 seats.

The party symbol is the balisier flower (&quot;Heliconia bihai&quot;) and the Party&#x27;s political headquarters is known as the &quot;Balisier House&quot; located in Port of Spain. Historically, the PNM has been supported by a majority of Afro-Trinidadians and Tobagonians and the Creole-Mulatto population, thus it is colloquially called the &quot;Black Party&quot;, the &quot;African Party&quot;, or the &quot;Creole Party&quot;. The PNM has its strongest support in cities and urban areas. It was also historically supported by different minorities such as the Chinese, Christian Indians (other than Presbyterian Indians), and Muslims of any ethnicity of the country.

The PNM&#x27;s signature policies and legislative decisions include independence, writing the , republicanism, the establishment of the Tobago House of Assembly, the Public Transport Service Corporation, the Water Taxi Service, universal preschool, primary and secondary education, universal health care, criminalizing child marriage and decriminalizing cannabis. In government since the 2015 general election, the party holds an overall majority of 22 out of 41 Members of Parliament in the House of Representatives and 16 out of 31 members of the Senate. The party has 72 out of the 139 local councillors and is in control of seven of the 14 regional corporations since the 2019 Trinidadian local elections. The party also has one out of 12 assembly members in the Tobago House of Assembly since the December 2021 Tobago House of Assembly elections.

Despite not being a socialist party, the PNM was a member of the democratic socialist West Indies Federal Labour Party in the Federal Parliament of the West Indies Federation from 1957 to 1962. The party includes a semi-autonomous Tobagonian branch known as the Tobago Council of the People&#x27;s National Movement. As of September 2018, the PNM has 100,000+ registered members.

== Rise to power ==

When Eric Williams returned to Trinidad in 1948 he set about developing a political base. Between 1948 and 1955 he delivered a series of political lectures, under the auspices of the Political Education Movement (PEM) a branch of the Teachers Education and Cultural Association. Naparima College is one of the locations at which such lectures were delivered. On 15 January 1956 Williams launched the PNM. In the 1956 General Elections the PNM captured 13 of the 24 elected seats in the Legislative Council with 38.7% of the votes cast. In order to secure an outright majority in the Legislative Council Williams managed to convince the Secretary of State for the Colonies to allow him to name the five appointed members of the council (despite the opposition of the Governor Sir Edward Betham Beetham). This gave him a clear majority in the Legislative Council. Williams was thus elected Chief Minister and was also able to get all seven of his ministers elected.

In the 1958 Federal Elections (which the PNM contested as part of the West Indies Federal Labour Party), it won four of the 10 Trinidad and Tobago seats with 47.4% of the vote. The Opposition, Democratic Labour Party won the other six seats.

== Independence era ==
In the 1961 General Elections the PNM won 20 of 30 seats with 58% of the vote. With the collapse of the West Indian Federation, the PNM led Trinidad and Tobago to independence on 31 August 1962.

In the 1966 General Elections the PNM won 24 of 36 seats, with 52% of the vote. However, economic and social discontent grew under PNM rule. This came to a climax in April 1970 with the Black Power Revolution. On 13 April, PNM Deputy Leader and Minister of External Affairs A. N. R. Robinson resigned from the party and government. On 20 April, facing a revolt by a portion of the Army in collusion with the growing Black Power movement, Williams declared a State of Emergency. By 22 April, the mutineers had begun negotiations for surrender. Following this certain ministers were forced to resign including John O&#x27;Halloran, Minister of Industry and Gerard Montano, Minister of Home Affairs.

In the 1971 General Elections the PNM faced only limited opposition as the major opposition parties boycotted the election citing the use of voting machines. The PNM captured all 36 seats in the election, including eight that they carried unopposed. Additionally, Williams split the post of Deputy Leader into three and appointed Kamaluddin Mohammed, Errol Mahabir and George Chambers to the position.

In 1972, J. R. F. Richardson crossed the floor and declared himself an Independent. He was subsequently appointed Leader of the Opposition. He was soon joined by another MP, Dr. Horace Charles.

In 1973, the PNM faced a major crisis. On 28 September Williams announced that he would not stand for re-election. This led to a race to succeed him as Political Leader of the party. By 18 November 250 of 476 registered party groups had submitted nominations, 224 of them for Attorney General Karl Hudson-Phillips and 26 for Minister of Health, Kamaluddin Mohammed. Williams announced on 2 December that he would return as Political Leader and Hudson-Phillips was forced out of the party.

== Decline and fall ==
In 1976 the PNM won 24 of 36 seats with 54% of the vote. In March 1978, Hector McClean, Minister of Works, resigned from the party and government and declared himself an independent MP.

On 29 March 1981, Eric Williams died. Williams had maintained an iron grip over the party and forced all potential rivals out of the party. In the absence of a clear successor, President Ellis Clarke was left to choose the new Prime Minister from among the three Deputy Political Leaders of the party. Clarke appointed George Chambers Prime Minister in preference to Kamaluddin Mohammed and Errol Mahabir. Chambers was subsequently elected as Political Leader of the PNM and led the party to victory in the 1981 General Elections. The PNM won 26 of 36 seats and 52% of the vote.

It subsequently held on to power until 1986 when it was defeated by the National Alliance for Reconstruction (NAR) under the leadership of A. N. R. Robinson. The PNM won three of 36 seats, with 32% of the vote. Chambers resigned and was succeeded by Patrick Manning as Political Leader.

== Manning and the PNM re-invented ==

When Manning became leader he promised a &quot;new PNM&quot; and purposely ignored the discredited old guard. He appointed Wendell Mottley, Keith Rowley and Augustus Ramrekersingh as his deputy leaders.

The PNM was returned to power in the 1991 elections after the NAR self-destructed. In the 1991 election it won 21 of 36 seats with 45% of the vote. However, in the latter half of that term the party became unstable. It lost one seat in a by-election and another when Ralph Maraj defected to the United National Congress. The issue that led Maraj to defect was the declaration of a limited State of Emergency which sole purpose was to remove Occah Seepaul (Maraj&#x27;s sister) as Speaker of the House of Representatives. The party also suffered a loss of support with the death Minister of Public Utilities, Morris Marshall, a favourite of the party grassroots. Attempting to halt the decline in party support Manning called an early &quot;snap election&quot; in 1995 . Many party front-benchers did not seek reelection including Finance Minister Wendell Mottley.

The party lost the 1995 General Elections winning 17 of 36 seats with 48% of the vote. The United National Congress (UNC) under the leadership of Basdeo Panday also won 17 seats and formed a coalition government with the National Alliance for Reconstruction which had won the remaining two seats. The PNM was further weakened when two MPs resigned from the party and threw their support behind the UNC government. This led to numerous calls for Manning to resign the party leadership, and for calls for Mottley to replace him. Manning declined to resign and Mottley appeared to have taken a sabbatical from politics. When leadership elections were held in 1997 Manning was challenged by Keith Rowley. Manning was returned as Political Leader.

In 2000 the PNM suffered another defeat, winning 16 of 36 seats with 46% of the vote. Another election was held in 2001 which resulted in a tie with both the PNM and UNC winning 18 seats, the PNM with 46% of the electoral vote and the UNC with 50%. However President Arthur N.R. Robinson appointed Manning as Prime Minister on the basis of &quot;moral and spiritual grounds&quot;. (In Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s elections, the number of seats needed to occupy the lower house is really the best indicator of whether or not a party would win elections). Unable to elect a Speaker, Manning advised the President to prorogue Parliament. On 7 October 2002 General Elections were held in which the PNM won 50.7% of popular votes and 20 out of 36 seats.

== In government since 2015 ==

On 9 September 2015, Keith Rowley was sworn in as the new Prime Minister, following the election victory of the PNM.
In August 2020, the governing PNM won the following general election, leading to the incumbent Prime Minister Keith Rowley serving a second term.

<doc id="750942" wikidata="Q634291" url="?curid=750942" title="High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy">
<text>The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission (HR/VP) is the chief co-ordinator and representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) within the European Union (EU). The position is currently held by Kaja Kallas.

The Treaty of Amsterdam had established the position of High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy. The position was augmented by the Treaty of Lisbon, which established its current title and powers, including a seat on the European Commission as Vice-President, and a chair of the council of EU foreign ministers. The first person to hold the full title of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, inaugurated upon the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, was Catherine Ashton. Early in the first term of the post, the office-holder became assisted by the European External Action Service (EEAS) that was set up in December 2010.

==Titles==
The formal title of the High Representative is &quot;High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy&quot;. This post was previously styled as High Representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and, under the European Constitution, had been designated to be titled the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs. This latter title, as EU Foreign Minister or EU Foreign Chief is still applied by commentators and sections of the media as a publicly recognisable shorthand for the post. The style High Representative equates to that of High Commissioner in diplomatic circles. Since the High Representative is ex officio a Vice-President of the European Commission, the office-holder is sometimes referred to as the HR/VP.

==Role==

Where foreign matters are agreed between EU member states, the High Representative can speak for the EU in that area, such as negotiating on behalf of the member states. The Representative co-ordinates the work of the European Union Special Representatives as well as other appointments such as anti-terrorist co-ordinator.

Beside representing the EU at international fora and co-ordinating the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Common Security and Defence Policy, the High Representative is:
* &quot;ex-officio&quot; Vice-President of the European Commission
* participant in the meetings of the European Council
* responsible of the European Union Special Representatives
* head of the External Action Service and the delegations
* President of the Foreign Affairs Council
* Secretary-general of the Western European Union (prior to the abolition of the WEU on 30 June 2011)
* Head of the European Defence Agency
* Chairperson of the board of the European Union Institute for Security Studies

According to proposals made in 2009 by the Swedish EU presidency, the High Representative will control the staffing and budget of the EEAS, and propose the size of budget to be allocated. The High Representative is responsible for appointing EEAS staff and for controlling general foreign policy (outside of trade, development and enlargement which has to be made together with the commission) including security initiatives and intelligence sharing. However, although the High Representative may prepare initiatives, decisions will still have to be taken by the member states in Council. The High Representative would also have to report to Parliament.

With the growth in role of the High Representative, and their exclusion from the European Council, the national foreign ministers are now uncertain of their role vs the High Representative. At an informal meeting in Finland it was mooted that they could serve as special envoys on the High Representative&#x27;s behalf. This has been backed by Ashton who said that so long as the EU spoke with one voice, it did not matter who was speaking.

==History==
The post was introduced under the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Treaty stated that the Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union should have &quot;the function of the High Representative for the common foreign and security policy.&quot; Thus, Javier Solana became the first permanent High Representative. Initially the post was much more limited in scope than the present one created in 2009 by the Treaty of Lisbon.

===Treaty of Lisbon===

The European Constitution proposed to merge the European Commissioner for External Relations with the High Representative to create a &quot;Union Minister for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy&quot;. Although the Constitution failed to be ratified, its replacement, the Treaty of Lisbon, retained the change under a different name. The new &quot;High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy&quot; would still merge the External Relations Commissioner with the High Representative and, like the Constitution, would have it backed up by an External Action Service. The new role also took over other foreign affairs roles, such as chairing the Foreign Affairs Council and representing the EU in international fora, roles which were previously exercised by the foreign minister of the country holding the presidency of the European Union (along with the foreign minister of the country previously holding the presidency and the one to take it next).

Despite the name change, many parts of the media still referred to it as a foreign minister and in negotiations it was decided that the High Representative would no longer also be the Council&#x27;s Secretary-General but would be a Vice-President of the European Commission, filling the now merged Commission post. The merger of the two posts has been seen as furthering the answer to Kissinger&#x27;s question:

==Appointments==
The High Representative is appointed by the European Council acting by qualified majority. However, in order to take up their role in the commission, in particular as a vice-president, the High Representative has to appear before Parliament for questioning and then be subject to Parliament&#x27;s vote of approval on the proposed Commission.

The basic monthly salary of the High Representative is fixed at 130% (higher than a vice-president but less than the Commission President) of the highest grade of the EU civil service (grade 16, step 3), which works out at €23,006.98. There are other allowances on top of that as all other conditions of employment for the High Representative are aligned to that of the commission.

=== Javier Solana Madariaga (1999–2009) ===

The Amsterdam Treaty introduced the post of &quot;High Representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy&quot; to represent the EU on the world stage. It was decided that the Secretary-General of the Council would be the High Representative. This meant that the Secretary-General at the time, Jürgen Trumpf, was the first High Representative, although he only served for a few months.

The first permanent High Representative was Javier Solana Madariaga, former Secretary General of NATO. He was appointed on 4 July 1999 at the Cologne European Council as Council Secretary-General and High Representative. He took up the post on 18 October 1999, shortly after standing down from NATO. The post had a budget of €40 million, most of which goes to Balkan operations. During his tenure, the position was expanded rapidly, with several more functions combined into the function of High Representative. From 25 November 1999 he was also appointed Secretary-General of the Western European Union (WEU), overseeing the transfer of responsibilities from that organisation to the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). In 2004, his five-year mandate was renewed; he also became president of the European Defence Agency for the duration of his second term.

The Clinton administration claimed in May 2000 that Solana was the fulfilment of Henry Kissinger&#x27;s famous desire to have a phone number to talk to Europe. In December 2003 Solana released the European Security Strategy, which sets out the main priorities and identifies the main threats to the security of the EU, including terrorism. On 25 March 2004, Solana appointed Gijs de Vries as the anti-terrorist co-ordinator for the CFSP, and outlined de Vries&#x27;s duties as being to streamline, organise and co-ordinate the EU&#x27;s fight against terrorism.

He has negotiated numerous Treaties of Association between the European Union and various Middle Eastern and Latin American countries, including Bolivia and Colombia. Solana played a pivotal role in unifying the remainder of the former Yugoslavian federation. He proposed that Montenegro form a union with Serbia instead of having full independence, stating that this was done to avoid a domino effect that might proceed from demands for independence by Kosovo and Vojvodina. Local media sarcastically named the new country &quot;Solania&quot;.

On 21 January 2002, Solana said that the detainees at Guantanamo Bay should be treated as prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention. The EU has stated that it hopes to avoid another war like the Iraqi invasion through this and future negotiations, and Solana has said the most difficult moments of his job were when the United Kingdom and France, the two permanent EU Security Council members, were in disagreement. The so-called Vilnius letter, a declaration of support by eastern European countries for the United States&#x27; aim of régime change in Iraq, and the letter of the eight, a similar letter from the UK, Italy, and six second-tier countries, are generally seen as a low-water mark of the CFSP. Solana operated as a &quot;quiet diplomat&quot;, and found himself frequently pushed to the side in negotiations and sent on missions known to be impossible.

Solana has played an important role working toward a resolution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and continues to be a primary architect of the &quot;Road map for Peace&quot;, along with the UN, Russia, and the United States in the Quartet on the Middle East. On 22 July 2004, he met Ariel Sharon in Israel. Sharon had originally refused to meet him, but eventually accepted that the EU was involved in the Road Map. Solana criticised Israel for obstructing the Palestinian presidential election of 9 January 2005, but then met Sharon again on 13 January.

In November 2004 he assisted the United Kingdom, France and Germany in negotiating a nuclear material enrichment freeze with Iran. In the same month he was involved in mediating between the two presidential candidates in the post-election developments in Ukraine, and on 21 January 2005 he invited Ukraine&#x27;s new President Viktor Yushchenko to discuss future EU membership.

=== Catherine Ashton (2009–2014) ===
Although Solana was originally selected to be the first Foreign Minister, the delays in introducing the post meant that after 10 years of service he stood aside for a new candidate. After numerous candidates were put forward, EU leaders agreed on Catherine Ashton from the United Kingdom as the first merged High Representative. Ashton was previously the European Commissioner for Trade and otherwise had no foreign affairs experience. Ashton unexpectedly came to the top of the shortlist when she was nominated unanimously by the centre-left leaders who claimed the post. Ashton was confirmed by the European Parliament before she took up the post. In the same European Council meeting, Pierre de Boissieu was appointed Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union, showing that the High Representative and the Secretary-General will no longer be the same person.

In October 2010 most major appointments to the EEAS were made, including Pierre Vimont (France) as Secretary General, Helga Schmid (Germany) and Maciej Popowski (Poland) as Deputy Secretaries General and David O&#x27;Sullivan (Ireland) as chief operating officer. Slowly other staff and ambassadors were appointed in cycles. Ashton formally launched the EEAS on 1 December 2010 at a low key event where she outlined her key priorities as relations with the US and China, climate change, poverty eradication, crisis management and counter-terrorism.

Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Ashton chaired a meeting of the foreign relations, development and environment DGs and experts from the Council and the Situation Centre (the EU intelligence-gathering agency). There they agreed on €3 million in aid, to look for further financial assistance, to send personnel to assess the situation and to co-ordinate pledges from member states. Ashton then chaired a meeting of member states&#x27; ambassadors and acted as a general co-ordinator; for example contacts from the UN went via Ashton. Although she refused to describe it as the first act of the external action service, Ashton did emphasise that it was the first time that such a co-ordination between all the various EU foreign policy actors had been accomplished before. Spain, which held the rotating Council presidency that would have taken charge before the Treaty of Lisbon, took a back seat though assisted, for example by offering use of the Spanish base in Panama. However, the majority of aid relief was dealt with bilaterally between Haiti and individual member states and Ashton was criticised afterward for being one of the few foreign representatives not to travel to Haiti personally. Despite EU ministers then agreeing to deploy European gendarmes, criticism was levied at Ashton for failing to improve the EU&#x27;s international profile during the crisis. Ashton responded thus: &quot;There&#x27;s been a recognition from the people of Haiti, the US, the UN and others of the extremely important role the EU has played. On the main issue, we should ask, have we tried to save lives, to support the people of Haiti? Yes we have.&quot;

Criticism continued to mount, including complaints that she skipped a defence meeting to attend the inauguration of Ukraine&#x27;s Prime Minister alleged bias towards British officials, lack of language skills and risking a UK-French feud over creating an EU military planning headquarters. She has been defended by some, including Commissioner Günther Oettinger, on the ground that she has had to take on a job that combines three previous jobs and is working on establishing the EEAS so she is unable to take on everything at once, nor please everyone. Despite early Spanish assistance during 2010, Ashton did find herself competing with the Spanish foreign minister on who was going to be speaking for the EU and the need to find consensus between the member states and institutions pushed back the expected operational date of the EEAS from spring 2010 to December 2010. In contrast to the Spanish position, in 2011 Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski said he would act as Ashton&#x27;s &quot;loyal deputy&quot;.

Secretary General Pierre Vimont joined those defending Ashton from criticism; praising her work in opening the EEAS office in Benghazi, Libya as making the EEAS very popular in Libya. He also supported her over Syria and has asked her to stand for a second term. Polish Minister for Europe, Mikołaj Dowgielewicz, also stated criticism against Ashton was &quot;a lot of hot air&quot; and that &quot;she has an impossible job to do and she is doing it well. At the end of her time in office, people will be more positive about what she has done. She will leave a real legacy.&quot;

However, Former European Commission adviser Dr Fraser Cameron argued that &quot;the criticism one hears of Ashton is pretty strong and it will be difficult to overcome the bad press she has. It represents a problem for the EEAS, when it comes to public diplomacy, and reflects the system we have for choosing leaders. Too often, the EEAS is waiting until the last member state signs up to the position; they could set out a view much earlier. When you look at places like Egypt – Cathy has been five times, but people are still not quite sure what the EEAS does or who speaks for Europe. The glass is less than half full. I think the criticism of Ashton is down to style and morale in the EEAS is not as good as it should be.&quot;

Ashton chaired the meetings between the E3/EU+3 (P5+1 countries and the EU) and Iran in Geneva, which led to an interim agreement on 24 November 2013, and the Joint Plan of Action.

The tone of public comment on Aston&#x27;s performance in office was subsequently to be influenced especially by her contributions to negotiations over Kosovo and the normalisation of its relationship with Serbia, and over Iran over its nuclear program. In October 2013, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; wrote of her:

But now the 57-year-old baroness is suddenly at the center of world diplomacy. And whenever she is mentioned, she earns praise for her hard-nosed negotiating skills, her stamina and her diplomatic talents. It is said that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has much faith in her. &quot;She is discrete and perceptive, but also tenacious. That makes her an ideal negotiator&quot;, says Alexander Graf Lamsdorff, the head of Germany&#x27;s business-friendly Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament and a member of its Committee on Foreign Affairs.

After the November 2013 negotiation of an interim agreement with Iran over its nuclear program. the &quot;Financial Times&quot; wrote that Ashton was &quot;no longer the diplomatic dilettante&quot;. A senior French diplomat was quoted as saying, &quot;I tip my hat to her... She truly played a decisive role&quot;. The report continued that, after initially insisting on negotiating only with other foreign ministers, by the latter stages of the negotiations the Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif &quot;now... wanted to deal only with Lady Ashton&quot;. Said a western diplomat, &quot;That the others agreed to this was significant. For China and Russia to be outside while she was in the room negotiating details was quite remarkable&quot;.

=== Federica Mogherini (2014–2019) ===

In July 2014, given the large number of Italian MEPs belonging to the S&amp;D group following the 2014 election, the European Council considered her as a candidate for the position of High Representative, in Jean-Claude Juncker&#x27;s new European Commission. On 13 July 2014, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; among other European newspapers reported that her nomination proposal had been opposed by some eastern European countries, including Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and Poland, where her stance towards Russia concerning the Russo-Ukrainian war was considered to be too soft. Nonetheless, on 2 August 2014, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi formally nominated her by letter to EC President-elect Jean-Claude Juncker, as Italy&#x27;s official candidate for EU Commissioner. On 30 August, Europe&#x27;s socialist Prime Ministers met prior to the convening of the European Council, at which she received the approval of the Party of European Socialists. On the same day the President Herman Van Rompuy announced that the European Council had decided to appoint the Italian Minister as its new High Representative, effective from 1 November 2014.

At her first press conference, she declared that her efforts would be devoted to establishing discussions between Russia and Ukraine to solve the crisis between the two countries.

In 2015, Mogherini won praise for her role in negotiating the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an international agreement on the nuclear program of Iran, and along with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was the one to announce the accord to the world.

In February 2015, the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker appointed Michel Barnier, the former EU Internal Market Commissioner, as his special advisor on defence and security. Juncker stated that Barnier&#x27;s role will be to advise the European Commission and particularly the EUHRVP Federica Mogherini on important defence and security issues. Barnier&#x27;s appointment came on the heels of the nomination of senior French diplomat Alain Le Roy as the new Secretary General of the European External Action Service (EEAS or EAS).

=== Josep Borrell Fontelles (2019–2024) ===
In 2020, EU Development Ministers have launched the Team Europe aid package to support partner countries to address the pandemic and its economic consequences by providing an overall financial support of over €20 billion.

&quot;In this global pandemic, international solidarity is not just a matter of staying true to our values&quot;, Josep Borrell Fontelles, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said. &quot;It is also about making sure that we win the fight against the virus together.&quot;

&quot;Unless the virus is defeated everywhere, it is not defeated. A global pandemic can only be solved globally, with united, swift and decisive global action, as we are presenting it today&quot;, Borrell Fontelles added.
In the wake of the 18 February 2022 Russian declaration on L/DPR (the self-proclaimed Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic and Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic), High Representative Borrell warned Moscow to return to the tenets of the Minsk agreements, to the discussions within the Normandy Format and the Trilateral Contact Group, which respect the borders of Ukraine.

With the development of the Israel-Hamas war, Borrell has been repeatedly critical of Israel actions, calling the country&#x27;s siege of Gaza illegal and dismissing its evacuation orders as unrealistic. As European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, he condemned the &quot;barbaric and terrorist attack&quot; by Hamas on Israel which started the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. On 10 October 2023, Borrell accused Israel of breaking international law by imposing a total blockade of the Gaza Strip. On 3 January 2024, he condemned the comments of the Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, writing, &quot;Forced displacements are strictly prohibited as a grave violation of [international humanitarian law] &amp; words matter.&quot; On 29 January 2024, Borrell told UN Secretary-General António Guterres that funding toward UNRWA has not been suspended and the EU will determine funding decisions after the investigation. Borrell stated, &quot;We shouldn’t let allegations cloud UNRWA’s indispensable and great work.&quot; In March 2024, Borrell said Israel&#x27;s depriving food from Palestinians was a serious violation of international humanitarian law, and described the Al-Rashid humanitarian aid incident as &quot;totally unacceptable carnage&quot;. Following the International Court of Justice advisory opinion on Israel&#x27;s occupation of the Palestinian territories, Borrell stated that international law is &#x27;binding&#x27;, and called for the EU foreign ministers &quot;to move on from words to deeds&quot; regarding Israel&#x27;s failure to comply with international legality in Gaza and the West Bank.

=== Kaja Kallas (2024–present) === 

On 1 December 2024, her first day in office as High Representative, Kallas visited Ukraine along with European Council President Antonio Costa and Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos, expressing strong support for a Ukrainian victory by stating that &quot;the European Union wants Ukraine to win this war&quot;. The trip was criticized by Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who stated, without further elaboration, that Kallas and Costa made statements not agreed upon by EU bodies. On the same day, Kallas also warned the Georgian government against using violence to suppress ongoing protests over the ruling party&#x27;s decision to postpone EU accession talks, threatening sanctions.
