<text>Yvonne Joyce Craig (May 16, 1937 – August 17, 2015) was an American actress who is best known for her role as Barbara Gordon/Batgirl in the 1960s television series &quot;Batman&quot;. Other notable roles in her career include Dorothy Johnson in the 1963 movie &quot;It Happened at the World&#x27;s Fair&quot;, Azalea Tatum in the 1964 movie &quot;Kissin&#x27; Cousins&quot;, and as the green-skinned Orion Marta in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Whom Gods Destroy&quot; (1969).

&quot;The Huffington Post&quot; called her &quot;a pioneer of female superheroes&quot; for television.

Craig was a philanthropist and &quot;an advocate for workers unions, free mammograms, and equal pay for women&quot;.

==Early life and education==
 Yvonne Craig was born in Taylorville, Illinois, the first of Maurice Melvin and Pauline Virginia (née Rogers) Craig&#x27;s three children. Craig&#x27;s father&#x27;s work caused the family to move in 1951 from Columbus, Ohio to the Oak Cliff neighborhood in Dallas, Texas. Craig first attended W. H. Adamson High School for a semester and then Sunset High School for three years.

She did not graduate high school due to the lack of &quot;a single PE credit&quot;. Craig explained the lack of credit, saying &quot;The funny thing about the PE credit is, I was going to the Edith James School of Ballet, and she&#x27;d have recitals at the art museum, and [the PE teacher] would come see me dance my little legs off, and then I&#x27;d come in to PE class, wrapped up, and claim I&#x27;d sprained and couldn&#x27;t play a sport&quot;. Craig had enough credits to get into college and attended UCLA.

==Career==
===Ballet===

Craig started studying ballet at the age of 10 at the Edith James School of Ballet in Dallas. She was discovered there by the Russian ballerina Alexandra Danilova. While still in high school, Danilova helped her obtain a scholarship to the School of American Ballet in New York City. While there, the 16 year-old Craig lived with roommate and future comedienne Carol Burnett at the Rehearsal Club on West 53rd Street.

In 1954 and at 17 years of age, Craig joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo as its youngest &quot;corps de ballet&quot; member. She was a professional ballerina with the company for three years. This training was helpful when she performed stunts while playing Batgirl. She left the ballet company in 1957 &quot;over a disagreement on casting changes&quot; and moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of continuing her dancing career.

===Acting===

Craig explained how her acting career started in Los Angeles, saying &quot;...this guy invited me to his office and said, &#x27;I&#x27;m making a movie, do you want to be in it?&#x27; I said, &#x27;No, I&#x27;m a ballet dancer and working my way toward soloist... I don&#x27;t want to be an actress&#x27;. But we became friends, so one night we&#x27;re out to dinner, and this man comes to the table and said John Ford&#x27;s son Patrick was going to make a movie with John Wayne&#x27;s son, who was also named Patrick. He asked, &#x27;Are you an actress?&#x27; I couldn&#x27;t talk - I had my mouth full - and the guy who took me out said,&#x27;She is, and I&#x27;m her manager, what can we do for you?&#x27;&quot;. The movie was 1959&#x27;s &quot;The Young Land&quot;, which also starred Dennis Hopper. Craig was paid US $750 a week () to act in the film, versus the $94 a week she had earned in ballet.

===1950s===
One of her earliest television roles was in an episode of the TV series &quot;Perry Mason&quot; (&quot;The Case of the Lazy Lover&quot;, 1958) alongside Neil Hamilton, who played her stepfather (later Hamilton played Police Commissioner James Gordon, Batgirl&#x27;s father). Shortly afterwards, she appeared in three films—&quot;The Young Land&quot;, &quot;The Gene Krupa Story&quot;, and &quot;Gidget&quot; (all 1959)—and also guest-starred in the TV series &quot;Mr. Lucky&quot; as Beverly Mills in the episode &quot;Little Miss Wow&quot; (also 1959).

===1960s===
Craig appeared with Bing Crosby in &quot;High Time&quot; (1960) and in &quot;Seven Women from Hell&quot; (1961), featured alongside Cesar Romero. In 1962, she guest-starred on the Western &quot;Laramie&quot; in the episode &quot;The Long Road Back&quot;.

Craig appeared with Elvis Presley in two films: &quot;It Happened at the World&#x27;s Fair&quot; (1963) and &quot;Kissin&#x27; Cousins&quot; (1964). She also starred in the low budget science fiction film &quot;Mars Needs Women&quot; (1966) with Tommy Kirk and appeared in &quot;In Like Flint&quot; (1967) as a Russian ballet dancer opposite James Coburn.

During the 1960s, Craig regularly appeared in television drama series. She appeared five times on &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, portraying five separate girlfriends for the titular character between 1959 and 1962. In 1960, she played Jo, a young photographer with Charles Bronson in &quot;Man with a Camera&quot;. In 1964, Craig guest-starred as Carol, an underwater photographer, on &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; (&quot;Turn Back the Clock&quot;). In 1965, Craig appeared in &quot;The Big Valley&quot; (&quot;The Invaders&quot;) and &quot;Kentucky Jones&quot; (&quot;Kentucky′s Vacation&quot;),
Craig played a Navy nurse with exotic Arabian dance skills in an episode of &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; (&quot;Pumpkin Takes Over&quot;) and in an episode of &quot;The Big Valley&quot; with Lee Majors and Barbara Stanwyck; both aired in 1965. That same year, she appeared in an episode of &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (&quot;The Brain-Killer Affair&quot;), where she helps solve the mystery of a brain-endangering poison. The following year, she came back as an U.N.C.L.E. employee in a theatrical film, &quot;One Spy Too Many&quot;, expanded from the episode &quot;The Alexander the Greater Affair&quot;. In an episode of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; (&quot;The Night of the Grand Emir&quot;) in 1966, she played an assassin who performs an exotic Arabian dance. In a 1968 episode of &quot;The Ghost &amp; Mrs. Muir&quot; (&quot;Haunted Honeymoon&quot;), she played Gladys Zimmerman, a bride-to-be who was stranded overnight at Gull Cottage.

Craig played a main character as well did the vocals for part of the soundtrack for &quot;Ski Party&quot; (1965) with Frankie Avalon. She was also Natasha, the Russian ballerina, in the spy film parody &quot;In Like Flint&quot; (1967) starring James Coburn.

===Batgirl===

From September 1967 until March 1968, Craig appeared in her highest-profile role as Batgirl/Barbara Gordon for the third and final season of the 1960s ABC TV series &quot;Batman&quot;. As Batgirl, she wore a purple and yellow outfit and rode a &quot;purple motorcycle with white lace trim&quot;, whereas her alter ego Barbara Gordon was the librarian daughter of Commissioner Gordon. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised her for &quot;add[ing] a scrappy girl-power element&quot; to a TV series it described as &quot;campy&quot;.
Craig did her own stunts on the show. &quot;Although they didn&#x27;t want me to do my stunts (and I ultimately did my own stunts), I mean, I kind of talked them into it. They knew that I danced and what they didn&#x27;t know was that I rode a motorcycle so I could do the stuff on the bikes.&quot; She did complain about riding the Batgirl Cycle. &quot;They had taken off the shock absorbers to put on the bat wings, so, whenever I went over a bump, it was like jumping off a table stiff-legged.&quot; The Batgirl Cycle was a customized 1967 Yamaha YCS1 Bonanza 180.

Co-star Burt Ward described working with Craig, saying &quot;Yvonne was a dear friend and a wonderful actress to work with. We had a great time on Batman. We were friends. She got along great with Adam and myself and everybody else. She was just a delightful person with a sparkling personality. She had an energy and brightness to her that was just uplifting&quot;.

While acting on &quot;Batman&quot;, Craig appeared as a contestant on the game show &quot;The Dating Game&quot; in 1967.

After &quot;Batman&quot; ended, Craig continued to act in television. She appeared in guest roles in &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot;, &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;, &quot;Mannix&quot;, and &quot;Emergency!&quot;

===Portrayed &quot;Marta&quot; in &quot;Star Trek&quot;===
In 1969 Craig appeared on &quot;Star Trek&quot; as Marta, a green-skinned Orion woman in the episode &quot;Whom Gods Destroy&quot;. In the episode, former Starfleet Captain Garth (Steve Ihnat), is incarcerated in a mental asylum on a distant planet. Garth lures Captain Kirk (William Shatner) to visit him in order to escape by hijacking the Enterprise. In the Star Trek canon, Orion women are described as &quot;...like animals. Vicious. Seductive. They say no human male can resist them&quot;. Garth uses Marta, also an escaped inmate, in an attempt to have her seduce Kirk through dance and then murder him.

Craig related the problems in having to wear green body makeup from head to toe in the episode. &quot;Susan [Oliver, who portrayed the Orion &quot;Vina&quot; in the show&#x27;s pilot episode &quot;The Cage&quot;] and I were supposed to be from the same planet. Only they couldn’t remember how they got Susan green in the first season episode – they somehow had lost the makeup. So, they had to devise a substitute formula. I had skid marks because the makeup wouldn’t stay on. Then, they sprayed me with Liquid Bandage, which has to be removed with acetone, so my skin was all burned – I was a walking disaster. When you perspire, Liquid Bandage won’t stick, so here I was, walking around with moss hanging from my armpits. It was just hideous. I would take two showers at the studio, then go home and take an oil bath, and then take another shower to get the remainder of it off. Then, I would start all over again the next day&quot;.

Craig discussed having to provide her own choreography, saying &quot;When they had to audition me they said, &#x27;Can you do a three-minute dance?&#x27; and I said, &#x27;Unless you&#x27;re doing &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, three minutes is a long time,&#x27; but I said, &#x27;Yes, I can do a three-minute dance if you want it, but you&#x27;ll probably just have to cut it to pieces, because that&#x27;s crazy&#x27;. It&#x27;s nuts, but it was fun to do&quot;.

===1970s===
From 1969 to 1972, she appeared in four episodes of the comedy series &quot;Love, American Style&quot;. In a 1970 episode of &quot;Land of the Giants&quot; (&quot;Wild Journey&quot;), she played one-half of a humanoid, time-observing duo (with Bruce Dern), who chase two of the Earth castaways (series stars Gary Conway and Don Marshall) into the past, ultimately forcing them to relive the flight that sent them to the giants&#x27; planet.

===Batgirl &quot;Equal Pay Act&quot; public service announcement===
In 1973 Craig reprised her Batgirl role in a public service announcement (PSA) promoting equal pay for women sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division.

In the PSA, Batman and Robin were tied to a post threatened by a ticking time bomb. Batgirl arrives but refuses to release them because she is paid less than Robin, in violation of the Equal Pay Act of 1963. The PSA was written and directed by Sidney Galanty, and narrated by the &quot;Batman&quot; TV series creator and producer William Dozier. Dick Gautier played Batman, due to Adam West distancing himself from the character.

In 1973, Craig appeared in a first-season episode of &quot;Kojak&quot; (&quot;Dark Sunday&quot;), and in 1977, she made a guest appearance in &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; (&quot;The Infiltrators&quot;).

===1980s===
When her Hollywood career slowed in the 1980s, Craig ventured into private business after tiring of the roles she was offered. She said &quot;I was being offered the same kinds of roles all the time and just thought, &#x27;Why would you bother repeating yourself?&#x27;&quot;

Briefly a co-producer of industrial shows, Craig began a new career as a real estate broker.

===1990s and later career===
Craig was the producer for &quot;Comic Book Kid&quot; (1993).

From 2009 to 2011, she voiced Grandma on the animated children&#x27;s series &quot;Olivia&quot;.

==Public appearances at conventions==
In the 1980s Craig attended many comic and fan conventions, signing photos and talking with fans.

Marvel and DC comic book letterer Steve Haynie remembered Craig&#x27;s interaction with convention goers, saying &quot;Yvonne Craig&#x27;s first convention appearance was at the 1988 Magnum Opus Con in Columbus, Georgia. She was going to give away autographed photos, but a few of us talked her out of that by pointing out that other guests supported themselves by selling photos. We warned her about the autograph dealers that would swoop in to take advantage of her generosity. She gave in with, &#x27;OK, then. How about fifty cents?&#x27; We told her no again. I took off for a few minutes, and when I came back she agreed to go as high as two dollars apiece. All the money was donated to a charity the local Star Fleet chapter worked with... Yvonne Craig enjoyed meeting fans&quot;.

Fellow actor Julie Newmar said of Craig when she attended conventions, &quot;My memory of her, especially, was her ebullience... that’s the kind of person she was... A smile, always a smile. And she would always show up in these marvelous clothes. They were all made of this silky kind of material. It’s body-hugging. It’s what our Catwoman and Batgirl costumes should have been made out of. Kind of similar but very clinging and comfortable. She was buxom and adorable... Everyone liked her&quot;.

==Autobiography==
Craig published an autobiography called &quot;From Ballet to the Batcave and Beyond&quot; (2000).

==Illness and death==
Craig died at age 78 at her home in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California, on August 17, 2015, from breast cancer that had spread to her liver.

==Filmography==
Craig appeared in the documentary film &quot;Ballets Russes&quot; (2005).

<text>The Boston Water and Sewer Commission (BWSC) serves retail customers with water services in Boston, Massachusetts. It purchases water wholesale from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA).

The largest retail water and wastewater utility in New England, BWSC owns and operates the drinking water distribution, wastewater collection and stormwater drainage systems; which utilise of water main and of sewer pipe and storm drain. It was created in 1977 taking control of the city operated sewer system and the state operated treatment facilities. 

The basic Boston water distribution system opened in 1848, and the wastewater collection system in 1883. In a response to the dangers posed to Boston by severely deteriorated water distribution and wastewater collection systems, BWSC was created in 1977 by an act of the Massachusetts legislature as a public instrument, a corporate separate and apart from the City of Boston. The Enabling Act empowered the BWSC to independently set rates and charges for the water distribution and wastewater collection services it provides and entrusted BWSC to improve and maintain the integrity of its systems.

BWSC purchases water from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA), a wholesale supplier of water and wastewater services. MWRA collect water in the Quabbin Reservoir, connected by a tunnel to Boston, and enters BWSC distribution system at 27 metered sites. When full, the Quabbin Reservoir holds , making it one of the largest man-made public water supplies in the country.

In the 40 years since its creation, BWSC has relaid or relined over of aging, and claims to have reduced the amount of water being lost through system leaks by per day. It has also, in conjunction with the MWRA, eliminated of combined sewer overflows to Boston Harbor. In 2003, BWSC installed an automated reading device on every meter, that allows it to track daily consumption.

The BWSC is home to the largest solar array in the City of Boston. In June 2007, the City of Boston became one of thirteen inaugural Solar America Cities under the Solar American Initiative led by the U.S. Department of Energy and launched Solar Boston, a half-million-dollar program to encourage the widespread adoption of solar energy in Boston. Through Solar Boston, the City will:

(a) Develop a strategy for the installation of solar technology throughout Boston including mapping feasible locations, preparing a project-labor agreement, and planning the citywide bulk purchase, financing, and installation of solar technology, (b) Work with local organizations to maximize Boston &#x27;s participation in state incentive programs and innovative financing initiatives (c) Create a successor non-profit organization to implement the long-term goals of the partnership, (d) Solar Boston partners include the U.S. Department of Energy, the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative, local utilities and unions, an anonymous foundation, and a broad range of local, regional, and national clean energy stakeholders including the US Department of Energy.

<doc id="748588" wikidata="Q261193" url="?curid=748588" title="Alison Doody">
<text>Alison Doody (born 11 November 1966) is an Irish actress and model. After making her feature film debut as Bond girl Jenny Flex in &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985), she went on to play Elsa Schneider in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; (1989). Other roles include Siobhan Donavan in &quot;A Prayer for the Dying&quot; (1987), Charlotte in &quot;Taffin&quot; (1988), Rebecca Flannery in &quot;Major League II&quot; (1994) and Catherine Buxton in &quot;RRR&quot; (2022). She also played Pam in &quot;Beaver Falls&quot; (2011–2012).

==Early life==
The youngest of three children, Doody was born in Dublin, Ireland. Her mother, Joan, was a beauty therapist, and her father, Patrick, worked in the property business and farmed. Doody attended Mount Anville Secondary School.

==Career==
Approached by a photographer, Doody took up modeling, which turned into a commercial career. Doody avoided glamour and nude work, a point which she extended to her acting career. 

Having come to the attention of the casting director of a new &quot;James Bond&quot; film, she accepted a small part as Jenny Flex in 1985&#x27;s &quot;A View to a Kill.&quot; Doody was listed as one of 12 Promising New Actors of 1986 in John Willis&#x27; Screen World, Vol. 38. Still only 18 when she appeared in the role, Doody was – and remains – the youngest Bond girl to date. Another early movie was a small part as IRA member Siobhan Donovan in &quot;A Prayer for the Dying&quot; (1987), which starred Mickey Rourke.

Doody had a non-speaking role in the 1987 television adaptation of &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; appearing as Archibald Craven&#x27;s wife, Lilias, in his dream. Her first lead role was in a 1988 episode of Jim Henson fantasy series &quot;The Storyteller&quot; as Sapsorrow, opposite John Hurt, Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders.

She played opposite Pierce Brosnan in the film &quot;Taffin&quot; (1988) before taking probably her most high-profile part to date, as Austrian Nazi-sympathiser and archaeologist Elsa Schneider in 1989&#x27;s &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; playing opposite Harrison Ford. The film also starred Sean Connery as Indy&#x27;s father; Doody has acted alongside three actors (Moore, Connery, and Brosnan) who have portrayed James Bond.

In 1991, Doody co-starred opposite Jonathan Pryce in mini-series &quot;Selling Hitler&quot;, inspired by the publishing fraud known as the Hitler Diaries. She subsequently relocated to Hollywood. Chosen to replace Cybill Shepherd as spokeswoman for L&#x27;Oréal, she went on to play opposite Charlie Sheen in 1994&#x27;s &quot;Major League II&quot; as Flannery, his girlfriend and agent.

After almost a decade away from the screen, Doody returned to acting with a small role in 2003 film &quot;The Actors&quot; with Michael Caine, playing herself in an award ceremony scene. She played alongside Patrick Swayze in the 2004 television film &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; and also starred in a short called &quot;Benjamin&#x27;s Struggle&quot; (2005), a pamphlet about the Holocaust, and in the TV series &quot;Waking the Dead&quot; (in a two-part episode called &quot;The Fall&quot;). In 2010, Doody shot a part in Danny Dyer&#x27;s film &quot;The Rapture&quot; (2010). She later guest starred in RTÉ&#x27;s medical drama &quot;The Clinic&quot;., and was set to star in a 2011 remake of horror classic &quot;The Asphyx&quot;, but the project later stalled.

In 2011, she began the first of two series on E4 comedy-drama &quot;Beaver Falls&quot;, playing Pam Jefferson. In 2014 she appeared in &quot;We Still Kill the Old Way&quot;.

On 21 November 2018, she received the &quot;Almería, tierra de cine&quot; award, and she received a star on Almeria Walk of Fame.

On 20 November 2019 she made her debut in the Indian film industry with the film &quot;RRR&quot;.

==Personal life==
Doody married Gavin O&#x27;Reilly, CEO of the Independent News &amp; Media, on 25 June 1994, at the O&#x27;Reilly family residence Castlemartin. The couple made their home at Bartra House, a home overlooking the sea in Dalkey; at the time of purchase, it was the most expensive house in Ireland. The marriage produced two daughters. She separated from O&#x27;Reilly in 2004, and divorced him in 2006.

During the 2011 filming of the comedy-drama &quot;Beaver Falls&quot; in South Africa, Doody met Douglas De Jager, a packaging tycoon from Cape Town. The couple had been keeping their relationship low-key, before De Jager died of a heart attack in July 2012.

She was engaged to businessman Tadhg Geary from 2014 to 2015.

<text>Kathryn Bridget Moynahan (born April 28, 1971) is an American actress and former model. She graduated from Longmeadow High School in Massachusetts in 1989 and began pursuing a career in modeling. Moynahan appeared in department-store catalogs and magazines, and after doing television commercials, began taking acting lessons. She made her television debut in a guest appearance in the comedy series &quot;Sex and the City&quot; in 1999, where she later had a recurring role as Natasha.

Moynahan made her feature-film debut in &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot; (2000). She had supporting roles in &quot;Serendipity&quot; (2001); &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; (2002); &quot;The Recruit&quot; (2003); &quot;I, Robot&quot; (2004); &quot;Lord of War&quot; (2005); &quot;Gray Matters&quot; (2006); &quot;Prey&quot; (2007); &quot;Noise&quot; (2007); &quot;Ramona and Beezus&quot; (2010); &quot;John Wick&quot; (2014); &quot;The Journey Home&quot; (2014) and &quot;John Wick: Chapter 2&quot; (2017).

Moynahan starred in the ABC television series &quot;Six Degrees&quot;, which premiered in September 2006, and was taken off the schedule after just eight episodes. From 2010 to 2024, she starred as Erin Reagan in the CBS police drama &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;.

==Early life==
Kathryn Bridget Moynahan was born April 28, 1971, in Binghamton, New York. She is the daughter of Irish Americans Mary Bridget (née Moriarty), a former school teacher, and Edward Bradley Moynahan, a scientist and former administrator at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and has described her family background as Irish-Catholic. Moynahan has an older brother, Andy, and a younger brother, Sean, who work as a computer programmer and potter, respectively. When Moynahan was around seven years old, her family moved to Longmeadow, Massachusetts, where she later attended Longmeadow High School, and was captain of the girls&#x27; soccer, basketball, and lacrosse teams, graduating in 1989. She has said that during her childhood, she was a &quot;tomboy&quot;.

==Career==
===Modeling===
After graduating from high school, Moynahan pursued a modeling career despite having never read fashion magazines growing up. She accompanied a friend to a modeling audition in Springfield, Massachusetts and was signed by the modeling agency instead of her friend. Moynahan moved to New York City at age 18, and a year later, began appearing in magazines such as &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Elle&quot;, and on covers of other widely known magazines. Her cover highlights include &quot;Vogue Paris&quot; (May 1993), &quot;Elle&quot; (October 1993), and &quot;Glamour&quot; (six times). 

===Acting===
Discussing her modeling work in a July 2004 interview, Moynahan said, &quot;It was a crazy world that paid a lot of money. I liked being a model, but I knew it would never last, so I looked into acting.&quot; She began doing soap and shampoo commercials in addition to taking acting and art classes. She studied acting at the Caymichael Patten Studio in New York and made her TV debut in 1999 as Natasha in HBO&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. She later had a recurring role in the show until the divorce of her character from Mr. Big (Chris Noth). The following year, she appeared in smaller film roles, including having parts in &quot;In the Weeds&quot; and &quot;Whipped&quot;.

Moynahan made her feature-film debut in the 2000 comedy-drama &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot; as Rachel, a bartender and dancer in a wild New York bar, a role considered her breakthrough. She accepted the role because she &quot;thought it was interesting that the whole movie revolved around five women…and my character was so strong and independent.&quot; The film received generally unfavorable reviews, but was a box-office success, earning $133 million worldwide. Her next role was a supporting role in 2001 film &quot;Serendipity&quot; as Hally, the fiancée of John Cusack&#x27;s character.

Moynahan worked opposite Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman in the action film &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot;, based on Tom Clancy&#x27;s book of the same name. She played Dr. Catherine Muller, a love interest for Affleck&#x27;s Jack Ryan. Dave Larsen of the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; reported the subplot involving Moynahan and Affleck was &quot;the film&#x27;s weakest point.&quot; The film received ambivalent reviews, but was a commercial success, earning $193 million at the box office. Moynahan&#x27;s next role was as a CIA trainee in &quot;The Recruit&quot; (2003). The movie was poorly received, with Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot; calling it &quot;a less-than-middling melodrama whose subject matter and talent never click as much as its credits portend.&quot;

In 2004, Moynahan worked alongside Will Smith in Alex Proyas&#x27; science-fiction movie &quot;I, Robot&quot;, loosely based on Isaac Asimov&#x27;s short-story collection of the same name. She portrayed Dr. Susan Calvin, a specialist in robot psychology. The film received mixed reviews, though critics enjoyed Moynahan&#x27;s performance. Daniel Neman of &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; disliked the film, concluding that Moynahan &quot;turns in an able performance as Dr. Calvin, the convenient character.&quot; With revenue of $347 million worldwide, the film remains Moynahan&#x27;s most commercially successful picture to date. Her next movie was 2005&#x27;s &quot;Lord of War&quot;, a political crime thriller, where she played Ava Fontaine Orlov, the wife of Nicolas Cage&#x27;s character. In 2006, &quot;Maxim&quot; named Moynahan #96 on its annual &quot;Hot 100&quot; list.

In September 2006, away from film, Moynahan worked as Whitney Crane in the ABC television drama series &quot;Six Degrees&quot; co-starring with Jay Hernandez, Erika Christensen, Hope Davis, Dorian Missick, and Campbell Scott. The series centered on six residents of New York City and their relationships and connections with one another, based on the idea of six degrees of separation. It debuted on September 20, 2006, and was watched by almost 13.3 million viewers. It debuted to varied reception, with David Hinckley of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; writing, &quot;In theory, it&#x27;s an intriguing concept for a series. But in practice, &quot;Six Degrees&quot; doesn&#x27;t work at all in drawing you in at the start.&quot; After one season, it was cancelled in May 2007.

Moynahan&#x27;s next film role was in the November 2006 thriller &quot;Unknown&quot;, about a group of individuals kidnapped and trying to escape their captors together. She was next seen in 2007, in &quot;Gray Matters&quot;, working with Heather Graham and Tom Cavanagh, before being cast in Henry Bean&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Noise&quot; as Helen Owen, the wife of David Owen (Tim Robbins). The movie was screened at a special presentation at the 2007 Rome Film Festival and released in theaters in 2008.

In December 2008, Moynahan guest-starred in two episodes of the ABC television comedy-drama &quot;Eli Stone&quot; as the titular character&#x27;s (Jonny Lee Miller) ex-girlfriend. Returning to film, she appeared in &quot;Ramona and Beezus&quot;, as the mother to Joey King and Selena Gomez&#x27;s characters. The film was directed by Elizabeth Allen and released in July 2010. The next year, Moynahan worked with Aaron Eckhart, Michelle Rodriguez and Michael Peña in the action science-fiction feature &quot;&quot; (2011). 

Beginning in 2010, Moynahan starred as Assistant District Attorney Erin Reagan on the CBS television show &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;. Co-star Donnie Wahlberg encouraged her to take the role after working with her on a 2008 TV pilot called &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;. Moynahan portrayed Erin Reagan throughout &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;&#x27; 14-year run. Moynahan has also directed episodes of the series.

In November 2009, Moynahan signed a deal with Garnier to appear in television and print advertising promoting their Ultra-Lift skincare products.

In 2014, Moynahan appeared as the late wife of the title character in the action film &quot;John Wick&quot;, and appearing in the 2017 sequel. Most recently, in 2019, she starred in the action film &quot;Crown Vic&quot;.

==Personal life==
Moynahan lived with screenwriter Scott Rosenberg from 2001 to 2003.

She dated NFL quarterback Tom Brady from 2004 to 2006. On February 18, 2007, Moynahan&#x27;s representative confirmed that she was more than three months pregnant and that Brady was the father. On August 22, 2007, she gave birth to their son.

In 2010, she moved from Pacific Palisades, California, to New York City when she was cast in &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;. Moynahan was in a brief relationship with director McG in late 2010.

On October 17, 2015, she married businessman Andrew Frankel at a ceremony in the Hamptons. Moynahan is the stepmother to Frankel&#x27;s three sons from a previous
marriage.

<text>Franklin MacVeagh (November 22, 1837July 6, 1934) was an American politician, lawyer, grocer and banker. He served as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President William Howard Taft.

==Formative years and family==
Born on November 22, 1837, in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, Franklin MacVeagh was a son of Major MacVeagh and the former Margaret Lincoln. His brother, Isaac Wayne MacVeagh, became the U.S. Attorney General under Presidents James A. Garfield and Chester A. Arthur.

MacVeagh graduated from Yale University in 1862, where he was a member of Skull and Bones. He then graduated from Columbia Law School in 1864. A Methodist, MacVeagh married Emily Eames in 1868; they had five children.

==Professional life==
MacVeagh initially worked as a wholesale grocer and lawyer and was subsequently hired by the Commercial National Bank of Chicago. Still serving as the director of that bank in 1909 after having held that position for twenty-nine years, he was nominated to be the United States Secretary of the Treasury by President and fellow Bonesman William Howard Taft. 

MacVeagh failed to address the pressing problem of currency reform, however, leaving it to the National Monetary Commission, which had been established by the Aldrich-Vreeland Act of 1908, but did stress the urgency of reform in his annual report. He is remembered for increasing the efficiency and general progressiveness of the Treasury Department. During his tenure, he abolished 450 unnecessary positions, rehabilitated the U.S. Customs Service with the introduction of electric automatic weighing devices and accepted certified checks instead of currency for customs and internal revenue payments. He was also involved in the creation of the buffalo nickel.

In 1885, MacVeagh served as the eighth president of the Commercial Club of Chicago.

His Washington, D.C., home at 2829 16th St., NW, was designed and built between 1910 and 1911 by noted architect Nathan C. Wyeth. It is now home to the Mexican Cultural Institute of the Embassy of Mexico.

He also owned a large summer estate in Dublin, New Hampshire (now listed on the National Register of Historic Places) known as Knollwood.

==Death and interment==
Franklin MacVeagh died in Chicago, Illinois, on July 6, 1934, at age 96, and was interred in Graceland Cemetery in Chicago.

However this arrangement proved short-lived as the New Rochelle campus was sold in December 2019 to the Grand Lodge of New York Freemasons in order to pay off the College of New Rochelle&#x27;s debts. It has since been turned into a senior-living facility for aged and infirm Freemasons.

<doc id="748616" wikidata="Q494871" url="?curid=748616" title="Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring">
<text>Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring () is a 2003 South Korean drama film directed by Kim Ki-duk about a Buddhist monastery that floats on a lake in a pristine forest. The story is about the life of a Buddhist monk as he passes through the seasons of his life, from childhood to old age.

The film stars O Yeong-su, Kim Young-min, Seo Jae-kyung and Yeo-jin Ha. The director himself appears as the man in the last stage of life. The film was released in the United States in 2004 by Sony Pictures Classics, in subtitle format.

== Synopsis ==
The film is divided into five segments (the titular seasons), each segment depicting a stage in the life of a novice Buddhist monk and his older teacher. The segments are roughly 10 to 20 years apart, and the action of each takes place during the season in question. The story unfolds rather simply, but the implications of the characters&#x27; actions are silently commented upon by the presence of Buddhist symbols and iconography.

===Spring===
A young Buddhist apprentice lives with his master in a small floating monastery, drifting on a lake in the serene forested mountains of Korea. The boy and his master live a life of prayer and meditation, using an old rowboat to reach the bank of the lake, where they regularly go walking for exercise and to collect herbs.In this part of the film, the animal owned by the monastery is a dog, a Buddhist symbol of fidelity to one’s master.

One day, in a creek among the rocky hills, the apprentice torments a fish by tying a small stone to it with string and laughing as it struggles to swim. Shortly after, he does the same to a frog and a snake; his master quietly observes all three occasions, and that night he ties a large, smooth rock to the apprentice as he sleeps. In the morning, he tells his apprentice that he cannot take off the rock until he unties the creatures he tormented—adding that if any of them have died, he will &quot;carry the stone in his heart forever.&quot; The boy struggles with the load on his back through the forest and finds the fish lying dead at the bottom of the creek, the frog still alive and struggling where he left it, and the snake in a pool of blood, presumably attacked and killed by another animal, unable to get away. The master watches as the boy begins to cry heavily at seeing what he has done to the snake.

===Summer===
The apprentice, now a teenager, encounters a mother and daughter dressed in modern clothes, indicating that the film takes place in modern times, walking along the forest path to look for the monastery. The apprentice silently greets and rows them across the lake to the monastery, where a colorful rooster is now part of the household. In Buddhist art, this bird is the representation of desire and craving. The daughter has an unspecified illness, displaying symptoms of a fever, and her mother brings her to the master in the hope of healing her. The master agrees to take in the teenage girl for a time, and the mother leaves. Over the next few days, the apprentice gets sexually attracted to the girl but is too shy to say anything; however, when he finds her sleeping in front of the Buddha statue, he gropes her breast. She wakes up and slaps him. In a guilty panic, the apprentice begins to pray incessantly, something his master notes as strange. Touching the apprentice&#x27;s shoulder, the girl seems to forgive him.

Eventually, the two wander off into the forest and have sex. They repeat the act over the next few nights, hiding their relationship from the master, until he discovers them asleep and naked, drifting around the lake in the rowboat. He wakes them up by pulling the plug out of a drain hole in the boat. Rather than expressing anger or disappointment, he merely warns his apprentice that &quot;lust leads to a desire for possession and possession leads to murder&quot; and says the girl must leave since she has recovered from her illness. After the master rows the girl ashore the following morning, the apprentice is distraught and runs away that night in pursuit of her, taking the monastery&#x27;s Buddha statue and the rooster with him. The implications of his two thefts are that while burdened with his craving as symbolized by the bird, he also has with him the &quot;burden&quot; of his master&#x27;s teachings, as symbolized by the Buddha statue.

===Fall===
Many years later in fall, the aging master returns from a supply run to a nearby village, bringing a cat in his backpack.

By chance, he glimpses a story about his former apprentice in a newspaper: He is wanted for the murder of his wife. Foreseeing his protege&#x27;s return, he modifies the teenage monk&#x27;s garments by hand, and soon afterward, the apprentice appears at the spiritual door at the lake&#x27;s edge, full of anger and carrying the bloodstained knife with which he stabbed his wife for having an affair with another man. Unwilling to live, he seals his eyes, mouth and nose in a suicide ritual (after brushing the Chinese character for &quot;closed&quot; on each of the seals) and sits in front of the newly returned Buddha statue, waiting for death. The master discovers him and beats him ruthlessly, declaring that while he may have killed his wife, he will not kill himself so easily. He ties his bloodied apprentice to the ceiling and sets a candle to slowly burn through the rope, then begins writing out the &quot;Heart Sutra&quot; on the monastery deck, holding the cat in his arms and dipping its tail into a bowl of black ink. The apprentice eventually falls and, beginning his repentance, cuts his hair off and is ordered to carve the Chinese characters into the wood to quiet his heart.

Two detectives arrive at the monastery to arrest the apprentice, but the master asks them to allow him until the next day to finish his task. The apprentice continues throughout the night and collapses into sleep immediately upon finishing. Influenced by the soothing presence of the master, the detectives help the old monk paint his apprentice&#x27;s carvings in orange, green, blue and purple. This appears to quiet their hearts as well.

The apprentice wakes up and is peacefully taken away by the detectives, with the cat accompanying them in the back of the boat. In Buddhism, &quot;the body of the cat is the temporary resting place of the soul of very spiritual people&quot;. When the monk brings back the cat (before he has gained information about the former apprentice), it demonstrates that at his advanced age, he has, in his solitude, achieved some form of inner peace and foreshadows his death. When the cat leaves with the apprentice, it perhaps symbolizes the monk&#x27;s dying wish - that the apprentice finds inner peace as well. After they leave, the master, knowing that his life is at its end, builds a pyre in the rowboat. He seals shut his ears, eyes, nose and mouth with paper in the same death ritual his apprentice performed, and he meditates while suffocating and burning to death. The master&#x27;s tears can be seen through the paper seals as he is engulfed in flame and a snake swims from the rowboat to the monastery.

===Winter===
The now middle-aged apprentice returns to the frozen lake and former home, which has been drifting uninhabited for years. During this segment, the animal motif is the snake, the Buddhist symbol of anger. He finds his master&#x27;s clothes, laid out just before his death, and digs his master&#x27;s teeth out of the frozen rowboat. He carves a statue of the Buddha out of ice, wraps his master&#x27;s &quot;sarira&quot; (small crystals sometimes found among cremated remains of monks and considered sacred relics) in red cloth, and sets them in the statue where the &quot;third eye&quot; would be located, under a waterfall. He finds a book of choreographic meditative stances and begins to train and exercise in the freezing weather.

Eventually, a woman comes to the monastery with her baby son and a shawl wrapped around her face. She leaves her son and flees into the night, but as she runs across the frozen lake, she accidentally falls into a hole in the ice dug by the monk. Finding her body the next day, he removes her from the water to look at her face, though it remains hidden on screen. Instead, in the next shot, the scarf is open on the ice and a carved stone head of Buddha is sitting on it.

Finally completing his long self-discipline, he ties to his body the monastery&#x27;s large, circular grinding stone emblematic of the Buddhist Bhavacakra, the wheel of life and rebirth. He takes a statue of the Buddha to come, Maitreya, from the monastery and climbs to the summit of the tallest of the surrounding mountains. As he climbs, dragging the stone wheel behind him and struggling to carry the statue, he reflects on the fish, frog and snake he tormented. Attaining the summit, he prays and leaves the statue seated on top of the circular grinding stone, overlooking the monastery in the lake far below.

===...and Spring===
Returning to spring again, the cycle recommences. The new master lives in the monastery with the abandoned baby, now a young boy and his apprentice. The boy is shown tormenting a turtle in front of the monastery, ominously a traditional symbol of longevity and prognosticating the future. Wandering into the same rocky hills his master had in his boyhood, the giggling boy echoes his predecessor by forcing stones into the mouths of a fish, frog, and snake (these last scenes were deleted in the U.S. release of the movie). A final image shows the Buddha statue on top of the mountain looking down over the lake.

== Production ==
Director Kim Ki-duk said of the film: &quot;I intended to portray the joy, anger, sorrow and pleasure of our lives through four seasons and through the life of a monk who lives in a temple on Jusan Pond surrounded only by nature.&quot;

&quot;The hermitage that is the stage for &quot;Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring&quot; is an artificially constructed set made to float on top of Jusanji Pond in Cheongsong County, North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. Created about 200 years ago, Jusanji Pond () is an artificial lake in which the surrounding mountains are reflected in its waters. It retains the mystical aura of having trees more than one hundred years old still growing along its shores. LJ Film was able to obtain permission to build the set after finally convincing the Ministry of Environment through six months of negotiations.&quot;

== Reception ==
&quot;Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring&quot; was acclaimed by film critics, holding a 95% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes and an 85 out of 100 on Metacritic. Peter Rainer of &quot;New York&quot; praised the film&#x27;s &quot;tranquil beauty&quot; and argued, &quot;Kim exalts nature—life&#x27;s passage—without stooping to sentimentality. He sees the tooth and claw, and he sees the transcendence. Whether this is a Buddhist attribute, I cannot say, but the impression this movie leaves is profound: Here is an artist who sees things whole.&quot; James Berardinelli wrote that the film&#x27;s pace &quot;is deliberate, but there is too much richness in the movie&#x27;s emotional tapestry for it to be considered dull or drawn-out. [...] The film raises questions about how we live our lives and how actions, like ripples in the waters of time, can have unexpected consequences years later.&quot; Berardinelli also stated that the &quot;perfectly composed shots [amplified] an emotionally resonant story.&quot;

Roger Ebert included the film in his Great Movies list in 2009, writing, &quot;The film in its beauty and serenity becomes seductive and fascinating. [...] There is little or no dialogue, no explanations, no speeches with messages. [Ki-duk] descends upon lives that have long since taken their form. If conflict comes, his characters will in some way bring it upon themselves, or within themselves. That causes us to pay closer attention.&quot;

In a 2016 international critics&#x27; poll conducted by the BBC, &quot;Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring&quot; was voted one of the 100 greatest motion pictures since 2000. In 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked it number 5 among the classics of modern South Korean Cinema.

== Music ==
The traditional song used near the end of the film, while the adult monk is climbing the mountain, is called &quot;Jeongseon Arirang,&quot; sung by Kim Young-im. The film score was composed by Ji Bark.

== Controversy ==
A sequence was excised from the international version of the film, likely due to its animal cruelty.

<doc id="748618" wikidata="Q6784392" url="?curid=748618" title="Massachusetts Water Resources Authority">
<text>The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) is a public authority in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that provides wholesale drinking water and sewage services to 3.1 million people in sixty-one municipalities and more than 5,500 large industrial users in the eastern and central parts of the state, primarily in the Boston area.

The authority receives water from the Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoirs and the Ware River in central and western Massachusetts. For sewage, it operates a large treatment center on Deer Island at the mouth of Boston Harbor, among other properties.

The modern MWRA was created in 1985 after being split from the Metropolitan District Commission. It gained the ability to raise its own revenues and issues its own bonds. The Department of Conservation and Recreation is the successor to the MDC, and still maintains the watershed lands.

==Service area==
The MWRA service area covers fifty-eight communities in Greater Boston and MetroWest plus three communities in Western Massachusetts, (Chicopee, Wilbraham, and South Hadley). The table below shows the services communities receive.

==Water system==
The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority and the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) own and operate the collection, treatment, distribution, and storage facilities that supply drinking water to some forty municipalities in the metropolitan Boston area. This water system design was based upon the purchase and subsequent protection of an entire watershed. This design assures that the water remains as pristine as possible. However, modern regulations require that all supplies of drinking water be chemically treated regardless of the source. Additions to the MWRA water system throughout its history have resulted in redundancies that allow major sections of the water system to be shut down for repair or maintenance.&#x27; The MWRA Operations Control Center is in Chelsea.

===Water sources===
Primary sources:
* Quabbin Reservoir – storage capacity
* Wachusett Reservoir – storage capacity
* Ware River (during high flow only)

Backup sources:
* Sudbury Reservoir – storage capacity
* Foss Reservoir, a.k.a. Framingham Reservoir No. 3 – storage capacity

===Eastbound water flow===
Water bound for Greater Boston flows from the MWRA&#x27;s main storage facility, the Quabbin Reservoir in central Massachusetts, through the Quabbin Aqueduct to the Wachusett Reservoir in and around Boylston and Clinton. Tributary rivers and streams comprising the Wachusett watershed, a 108 square mile (280 square kilometer) drainage basin, also feed the Wachusett Reservoir.
The Cosgrove Tunnel carries water from there to the John J. Carroll Water Treatment Plant, located at the town lines of Marlborough, Northborough, and Southborough, Massachusetts. The plant replaced one used previously only for pH control. It comprises four ozone generators with diffusers and five concrete contact chambers with a volume of . The plant has a capacity of per day, on an average day or per day, at peak level. It cost US$340 million.

The MetroWest Water Supply Tunnel (MWWST) carries water further east, passing the Norumbega Reservoir, Schneck&#x27;s Pond, and Norumbega Covered Storage in Weston. Near Route 128 and the Charles River, it splits in two, feeding regional distribution lines at the Loring Road Tanks and an interconnection with the City Tunnel passing into Newton. In the Chestnut Hill area, the City Tunnel splits into the City Tunnel Extension (northeast) and Dorchester Tunnel (southeast), which act as backbones for smaller distribution mains and feed various regional storage tanks.

===Westbound water flow===
The Chicopee Valley Aqueduct carries water from the Quabbin Reservoir to the Western Massachusetts communities of Chicopee, Wilbraham and South Hadley (Fire District No. 1). It passes through the Ware Water Treatment Facility and the Nash Hill Covered Reservoir in Ludlow.

===Pressure zones===
The water system is divided into seven pressure zones, needed because different consumers are at different altitudes. The seven zones, measured from &quot;Boston City Base&quot; level are approximately:
* 185 ft – Low Service – Cambridge and lower portions of Boston, Somerville, Medford, Malden, Chelsea, Everett, and Winchester
* 280 ft – Northern and Southern High Service – Downtown Boston towers, southern and western Boston, part of Milton, Quincy, Needham, Weston, Wellesley, Watertown, southern Waltham, Marblehead, Swampscott, Revere, Melrose, Peabody; parts of Newton, Brookline, Arlington, Somerville, Medford, Malden, Everett, Wakefield, and Stoneham
* 320 ft – Intermediate High Service – parts of Belmont, Watertown, and Newton
* 330 ft – Northern Intermediate High Service – Reading, Woburn; parts of Stoneham, Winchester
* 400 ft – Southern Extra High Service – Stoughton, Canton, Norwood, Westwood, Dedham; parts of Milton, Boston, Brookline, and Newton
* 440 ft – Northern Extra High Service – Bedford, Lexington; parts of Winchester, Arlington, Belmont, and Waltham

===Water storage facilities===
The major MWRA water storage facilities outside of the source reservoirs are listed below. Covered storage facilities ( total capacity) are in primary use, and surface reservoirs are used as backup only. (Uncovered reservoirs cannot store potable water without the need for later treatment).

===Redundancy===
The Wachusett Aqueduct is an older parallel conduit to the Cosgrove Tunnel, and is still available as standby transmission for moving water from the Wachusett Reservoir to the Carroll Water Treatment Plant. It was used for this purpose during a tunnel shutdown in 2003.

The Hultman Aqueduct begins at the Carroll Water Treatment Plant and parallels the MetroWest Water Supply Tunnel (MWWST), which replaced it in 2003. After the MWWST&#x27;s completion the Hultman Aqueduct underwent a major reconstruction project, which lasted from 2009 to 2014, with the goal of maintaining it as a standby alternative to the MWWST. With the completion of its refurbishment in 2014 it returned to standby status for use in the event the MWWST is unavailable.

The Wachusett Aqueduct open channel extends past the Carroll Water Treatment Plant and connects the underground portion of the Wachusett Aqueduct to the Sudbury Reservoir. Before the Hultman and Cosgrove aqueducts were built this served as the primary method of transmission for water from the Wachusett Reservoir. Although no longer used for that purpose it is maintained as emergency transmission. In an emergency this can be used to feed untreated Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoir water into the emergency source reservoirs.

The backup Weston Aqueduct runs from the Sudbury Reservoir in Framingham, running to the Loring Road storage tanks in Weston via the Weston Reservoir (a backup surface storage reservoir). The Hultman Aqueduct and the MWWST connect with the Sudbury Reservoir and Weston Aqueduct.

The Sudbury Aqueduct runs from Foss Reservoir (Framingham Reservoir No. 3) in Framingham directly to the Chestnut Hill Reservoir, parallelling the MWWST. Sudbury Reservoir and Foss Reservoir are connected by a surface waterway. Framingham Reservoirs No. 1 and No. 2 are downstream on the Sudbury River from No. 3, and are no longer designated as emergency water supplies.

Construction on a redundant barrel of the Chicopee Valley Aqueduct was substantially complete in 2008.

During the failure of the interconnection between the MWWST and City Tunnel in May 2010, the MWRA drew water from the Chestnut Hill Reservoir, Spot Pond Reservoir, and Sudbury Reservoir via the Sudbury Aqueduct. The Hultman Aqueduct was unavailable as a backup as it was undergoing reconstruction at the time.

In an emergency, water can be treated with sodium hypochlorite at any point in the system by deploying Mobile Disinfection Units – trailer-mounted units that the MWRA has stored at strategic locations throughout its system. Emergency chlorination was used during the main break of May 2010, but not quickly enough to prevent the need for a boil-water order; part of the delay was the need for follow-up testing.

===Electrical generation===
The system includes three hydropower stations (one inactive) and two wind turbines, with a total capacity of 19.8 MW. Water released to the Swift River flows through the Winsor Station below the Winsor Dam but the turbines were damaged in a fire and have not been reactivated. Water transferred from Quabbin to Wachusett can pass either through the turbines at Oakdale or through bypass pipes when flow requirements exceed turbine ratings. Water released from Wachusett into the Cosgrove Tunnel passes through the Cosgrove turbines. The 4 original turbines in the Wachusett Gatehouse, located at the start of the Wachusett Aqueduct, have not been used in over 40 years. A 1.54MW turbine is currently being installed at the dam. A turbine at Southborough at the start of the Weston Aqueduct has also been inactive for a long period.

The Quabbin Aqueduct connects the two reservoirs, and relies upon gravity to accommodate the three separate operational needs. First, diversion of water from the Ware River into the Quabbin Reservoir uses this aqueduct. Second, water transfer from the Quabbin Reservoir to the Wachusett Reservoir, through a hydropower station or a bypass pipe, uses it as well. The bypass valves are non-regulating valves, and when opened, only the head in the Quabbin Reservoir and the physical characteristics of the aqueduct govern the flow. Because the turbines are flow limited, the bypass mechanism permits transfer rates nearly twice as high as are possible through the turbines. Operationally, the single aqueduct fulfills three purposes, but only one operational mode is possible at a given time.

MRWA also owns and operates several solar power and wind power facilities to help meet Massachusetts&#x27; greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, and undertakes energy efficiency projects. One wind turbine is located at the Charlestown sewage pumping station, near Encore Boston Harbor, with a rated capacity of 1.5 MW.

As a large customer, the MWRA also generates its own electricity at Deer Island Sewage Treatment Plant and Carroll Water Treatment Plant during periods of high demand to earn money with demand response contracts and to avoid high peak-time prices. This further reduces emissions from less-efficient grid peaking power plants that would otherwise be needed.

== Water system history and plans ==

===Major construction===
Local wells, springs (including one on Boston Common), and rain barrels were the first sources of water for Boston residents. Jamaica Pond was used as a water source for Boston starting in 1795, using wooden pipes (later with cast iron). After several epidemics and fires which exposed the inadequacy of the water supply, the Cochituate System was constructed by the Cochituate Water Board, starting in 1845 and opening in 1848. It included a dam on the Sudbury River, creating Lake Cochituate which fed the Cochituate Aqueduct leading to the Brookline Reservoir and local storage such as the Beacon Hill Reservoir. When Boston annexed Charlestown in 1873, the Mystic Lakes system was added to Boston&#x27;s water supply. The Cochituate Reservoir and Aqueduct were abandoned in 1951; none of the other reservoirs or lakes are currently in use as part of the primary or backup water supply.

The Boston Water Board constructed seven reservoirs in the Sudbury River watershed from 1875 to 1898. Water impounded in these reservoirs was delivered to the Chestnut Hill Reservoir by the Sudbury Aqueduct, completed in 1878. Some distribution mains serving the Boston Low Service area date to the period when water was gravity-fed from the Brookline and Chestnut Hill Reservoirs. (These were transferred to Weston Reservoir by 1900, and covered storage in Weston by 1978, with supplemental service from the City Tunnel and City Tunnel Extension.) In the late 1800s, water was pumped from Chestnut Hill to the Waban Hill Reservoir in Newton and the Fisher Hill Reservoir in Brookline to create the Southern High Service zone. Other pumping stations were also added: one at Alewife Brook in Somerville and another at Spot Pond in Stoneham. Some of the distribution mains carrying the now-unused supply from the Mystic Lakes, and those connecting Chestnut Hill with these mains and Spot Pond, are still supplying the northern Low Service area. Spot Pond served the northern Low Service zone, and pumped water to the Fells Reservoir to create the Northern High Service zone.

Population growth and the increasing popularity of indoor plumbing continued to put pressure on the region&#x27;s water supply. After considering Lake Winnipesaukee, Sebago Lake, and the Merrimack River, the Metropolitan Water Board decided to create the world record-setting Wachusett Reservoir by damming the Nashua River in Clinton, Massachusetts. It was completed in 1905 and filled in 1908, feeding the Wachusett Aqueduct. Water travelled to the Boston area via the Weston Aqueduct and the Weston Reservoir, or via the new Sudbury Reservoir and the older Sudbury Aqueduct.

Continued growth in water demand prompted the 1926 construction of the Wachusett-Coldbrook Tunnel to tap seasonal excess water in the Ware River. The tunnel was extended to the Swift River to become the Quabbin Aqueduct. The Metropolitan Water Supply Commission began construction of the massive Quabbin Reservoir in 1936, and it took from 1939 to 1946 to fill the reservoir. The creation of the new reservoir resulted in the disincorporation of four Western Massachusetts towns.

The Chicopee Valley Aqueduct was completed in 1950. Other pressure zones were created around Route 128 suburbs in 1951 by adding several pumping stations.

Capacity was expanded in 1941 with the completion of the Hultman Aqueduct (which connected the Wachusett Aqueduct to the end of the Weston Aqueduct at Norumbega). The City Tunnel was added in 1951, connecting to the Chestnut Hill nexus. The City Tunnel Extension (1961) and Dorchester Tunnel (1978) carried high-pressure water part of the way to Fells and Blue Hills reservoirs, respectively. The Dorchester Tunnel allowed the relegation of the Sudbury Aqueduct and Chestnut Hill Reservoir to backup status, which also improved water quality. The redundant Cosgrove Tunnel was finished in 1965, allowing maintenance of the Wachusett Aqueduct.

===Conservation era===
Demand for water exceeded the &quot;safe supply&quot; of per day (for which precipitation is reliably available) starting in 1969. Though diverting water from the yet further westward Connecticut River was considered several times, in 1986, the MWRA instead undertook a campaign of water conservation. Demand was reduced to sustainable levels by 1989, and continued to drop to around per day by 2009.

From 1996 to 2009, the MWRA constructed sanitary covered storage tanks. These are now the primary local storage; the remaining small uncovered reservoirs are only used for backup because the water from these basins would require further treatment. The MetroWest Water Supply Tunnel was finished in 2003, allowing rehabilitation of the increasingly leaky Hultman Aqueduct.

===2010 supply failure===
The 2010 Boston Water Emergency was caused by a catastrophic failure of a collar connecting two sections of pipe that ruptured in Weston, Massachusetts, on May 1, disrupting the connection between the MetroWest Water Supply Tunnel and the City Tunnel. This resulted in activation of the backup reservoir system for the first time, and a boil-water order for the entire MWRA system affecting approximately two million residents of 31 cities and towns. On May 4, test results indicating the backup water supply was clean enabled lifting of the boil water order.

===System expansion===
Given that conservation efforts brought demand well below the MWRA-defined &quot;safe yield&quot;, and desiring to amortize over more ratepayers the fixed costs of large projects like the MetroWest Tunnel and Deer Island sewage treatment plant, the MWRA is seeking to add more wholesale water customers, including municipalities and properties straddling the border of its service area. At the same time, certain communities in Massachusetts are facing a shortage of available water due to population growth or other factors.

From 2002 to 2009, the following municipalities and other customers have been added to the system:
* Stoughton, Massachusetts
* Avalon (private development on Danvers-Peabody border)
* Dedham/Westwood Water District
* YMCA (private customer on Salem-Marblehead border)
* Reading, Massachusetts
* Wilmington, Massachusetts

===Lead pipe removal===
MWRA and municipal water mains are made of concrete, steel, and iron, but as of 2016, about 5% of service lines (between the street and buildings, running from public to private property) in various municipalities were still made of lead. In 2016, during the Flint water crisis, the MWRA board approved $100 million in zero-interest loans for lead pipe removal. Each affected municipality is responsible for designing and operating its own program; MWRA estimates this funding will be enough to removal all lead service pipes from the entire system. MWRA has adjusted water pH since 1996 to avoid corrosion and leaching of lead from remaining pipes into drinking water.

===Planned expansions and upgrades===

Burlington, Massachusetts town meeting voted in 2018 to connect to the MWRA via Arlington, to make up for a partial shutdown of its Vine Brook Treatment Plant due to wells contaminated with 1,4 dioxane. Another vote to fund the second phase of construction is expected in 2021. In the meantime, Burlington gets MWRA water via Lexington if supplies drop to the point that a full outdoor watering ban is necessary (which happened during the drought of summer 2020).

In June 2020, the Lynnfield Center Water District (one of two districts in Lynnfield, Massachusetts) reached its pumping capacity, due to a combination of drought and high residential water usage during the COVID-19 pandemic in Massachusetts. It started the process of making an emergency interconnection to the Lynnfield Water District, which is supplied by the MWRA.

Because they have no alternative routes, City Tunnel, City Tunnel Extension, and Dorchester Tunnel cannot be taken out of service for more than a day for maintenance. Some of the valves that would allow that to happen are corroded or underwater. The MWRA is planning to use a tunnel boring machine to dig two new 10-foot-diameter tunnels from Shaft 55A in Weston. The new Northern Tunnel would go to the Waltham-Belmont border, and together with smaller service mains in Belmont, Arlington, and Medford, would form a loop with the City Extension Tunnel and City Tunnel. The new Southern Tunnel would go to Shaft 7C on the Dorchester Tunnel in Boston, forming a southern loop. A smaller service main in Boston would provide redundancy for the remainder of the Dorchester Tunnel. As of 2018, the project is expected to take 17 to 23 years to design and construct.

Various other &quot;Metropolitan Redundancy Interim Improvements&quot; would increase reliability in the short term and in the long term help eliminate any single point of failure that would necessitate a boil-water order or cause a complete water outage in any given area. This includes making a new connection for the Commonwealth Avenue Pumping Station in Newtown to low service lines, to allow the city to continue to receive water in case the City Tunnel goes out of service. MWRA also has a program to finance replacement or lining of local water mains, to maintain quality for consumers.

==Sewage systems==
===Metro Boston sewage===

In 1884, the Boston Main Drainage System was completed, carrying sewage from 18 towns to Moon Island to be held for an outgoing tide. In the early 1900s, the sewage was pumped directly into Boston Harbor. The Metropolitan District Commission built a sewage treatment plant at Nut Island in 1952, and another at Deer Island in 1968. The Clean Water Act of 1972 imposed more stringent requirements. MWRA stopped discharging floating debris and fluids (scum) into Boston Harbor in 1989; it is now landfilled. Dumping of sludge into Boston Harbor ended in 1991 by using a facility in Quincy to convert it into fertilizer. Sewage processing was improved and consolidated at Deer Island in the 1990s, with a deep-water discharge system finished in 2000. In 1993, the Charlestown sewage pumping station was named after long-time MWRA sewage engineer Peter M. DeLauri. Federally mandated projects to reduce combined sewer outflow events into Boston Harbor and local rivers were ongoing as of 2004.
 The South Boston CSO Storage Tunnel was completed in 2011.

Sludge is transported from Deer Island via the Inter-Island Tunnel to Quincy, where it is pelletized for sale as fertilizer by the New England Fertilizer Company and the MWRA itself doing business as Bay State Fertilizer. Some fertilizer is transported by the MWRA-owned Fore River Railroad. Discharges to Massachusetts Bay are disinfected with sodium hypochlorite, then de-chlorinated with sodium bisulfite.

Major headworks send sewage to the Deer Island Treatment plant from Chelsea Creek, the Columbus Park neighborhood of South Boston, the new Nut Island Headworks, Ward Street in Roxbury, and the Winthrop Terminal Facility. Thirteen pumping stations help feed the system, including the Intermediate Pumping Station in North Weymouth, DeLauri station in Charlestown, and a rehabilitated station on Alewife Brook Parkway in Somerville. The system also has a number of combined sewage overflow prevention storage tunnels and emergency discharge points.

===Clinton and Lancaster===

MWRA assumed legal responsibility for the Clinton Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1987. The facility serves Clinton and a portion of the town of Lancaster. It discharges into the South Nashua River. MWRA, its predecessors, and the town of Clinton have had funding disputes over the plant, which was created to compensate Clinton for sewage problems caused by the construction of the Wachusett Reservoir.

===Rutland-Holden===

The Rutland-Holden Trunk Sewer was completed in 1934, and the Rutland-Holden Relief Trunk Sewer added capacity in the 1980s. These lines are state projects to improve quality of public drinking water sources: the Wachusett Reservoir, Quinapoxet River, and Ware River. They are owned by the Department of Conservation and Recreation and operated by MWRA. Sewage is collected from the town of Rutland, the town of Holden, portions of West Boylston via Holden, and Anna Maria College in Paxton. Sewage flows out of the MWRA&#x27;s jurisdiction, into the sewage system of the city of Worcester, treated by the Upper Blackstone Water Pollution Abatement District at a plant in Millbury, and discharged into the Blackstone River. The source towns and college pay the city of Worcester for treatment and MWRA for operational costs based on flow rates.

==Water and sewage statistics==
MWRA Total Water Demand and Wastewater Generation

: * Total withdrawals and water sales included an additional (temporary) demand from Cambridge while it rebuilt its own water treatment plant. For calendar year 1999, 15 mgd; calendar year 2000, 14 mgd; and calendar year 2001, 6 mgd.
: ** Total withdrawals do not include an additional demand associated with Carroll Water Treatment Plant start up and testing activities. For calendar year 2003, 2,710 MG (annual average 7.4 mgd); calendar year 2004, 1,326 MG (annual average 3.6 mgd); calendar year 2005, 12,264 MG (annual average 33.6 mgd).

Annual Water and Sewer Retail Rate Survey

&quot;The MWRA Advisory Board...
was established by the state Legislature to represent the 60 communities in the MWRA
service area. Through annual comments and recommendations on the Authority’s proposed
capital and current expense budgets and rates, the Advisory Board provides a ratepayer
perspective on the MWRA’s plans and policies to improve the region’s water and sewer
systems.&quot;

&quot;The water and sewer rates cited on the following pages for average annual household use are based
on the industry standard of 120 hundred cubic feet (HCF), or approximately . Actual
usage per household will vary. The principal goal of the survey is to track retail rate increases from year to year using a consistent standard.&quot;

===MWRA debt===
&quot;The biggest driver of MWRA&#x27;s budget is debt service on the bonds that financed major capital improvement projects.

Since its creation in 1985, MWRA has completed $6.8 billion worth of upgrades to its water and sewer systems. These projects have all but reversed the effects of neglect and underfunding of the previous decades.

With the sewer treatment facilities on Deer Island complete, the clean-up of Boston Harbor has gained national acclaim as one of the greatest environmental success stories of our time. On the drinking water side, massive upgrades to water infrastructure, including a state-of-the-art ozone disinfection plant and covered storage tanks throughout the district guarantee some of the best drinking water in the country for generations to come. But these improvements have come at a price.&quot;

== Annual test reports ==
Water test results must be made public annually. The MWRA&#x27;s drinking water test results for 2014 were published in June 2015. Results from previous years are also available online.

== Fluoridation ==
The MWRA has fluoridated its drinking water since the 1980s, maintaining a target fluoride level of 0.7 parts per million.

<text>Voltairine de Cleyre (; November 17, 1866 – June 20, 1912) was an American anarchist, feminist writer and public speaker.

Born into extreme poverty in Michigan, de Cleyre taught herself how to read and write, and became a lover of poetry. She was educated at a Catholic convent, which improved her literary and linguistic capabilities, but also influenced her turn towards anti-theism and anti-authoritarianism. After graduating, de Cleyre began her activist career in the freethought movement, lecturing around the country and writing for a number of rationalist publications. Drawn towards socialism and individualist anarchism, she converted fully to anarchism in the wake of the Haymarket affair, which radicalized her against the state and capitalism. 

She moved to Philadelphia, where she lived for most of her adult life and taught many of the city&#x27;s Jewish anarchists. By the late 1890s, de Cleyre was a leading figure in the American anarchist movement, regularly speaking at events, writing for publications and organizing anarchist groups. She also went on a lecture tour of the United Kingdom, during which she was introduced to Spanish anarchists, who influenced her adoption of the philosophy of anarchism without adjectives and her later defense of propaganda of the deed. 

Following a murder attempt by Herman Helcher, a mentally ill former student of hers, her physical health rapidly deteriorated and she never fully recovered, but was able to return to writing and public speaking after a few years. During the free speech fights of the early 20th century, she was arrested for inciting a riot in Philadelphia. Towards the end of the 1900s decade, she grew increasingly depressed and lost her faith in anarchism. But by 1910, she had returned to the movement and moved to Chicago, where she lectured on progressive education. During the final years of her life, she was a keen supporter of the Mexican Revolution. She died in 1912, and was buried near the grave of the Haymarket anarchists.

Although eulogized by many anarchists of her time, she was largely forgotten or ignored in many histories of the anarchist movement, due in part to her short life. Her biographers, Paul Avrich and Margaret Marsh, and collectors of her writings, such as A. J. Brigati, Sharon Presley and Crispin Sartwell, brought her life and work back to public attention by the turn of the 21st century.

== Early life ==

===Childhood===
Voltairine De Claire was born on November 17, 1866, in Leslie, Michigan. She was the third daughter of Hector De Claire, a French-American artisan and socialist, and Harriet De Claire, a New Englander whose family was involved in the abolitionist movement. She was named by her freethinking father after the French philosopher Voltaire. 

After the death of their first child, Marion, the family moved to a small house in St. Johns in May 1867. There De Claire grew up in extreme poverty. Adelaide De Claire later attributed her sister&#x27;s radicalism to their experiences with poverty, which gave her compassion for the poor and working class. Their financial difficulties made De Claire&#x27;s father bitter and demanding, while her mother withdrew her affections from her. Although she would remain a devoted daughter throughout her life, De Claire never forgave her mother for her cold behavior towards her.

As De Claire grew up, she developed a love of nature, as well as a &quot;headstrong and emotional&quot; personality. Her sister Adelaide remembered her as a &quot;wayward&quot; child, who was &quot;often very rude to those who loved her best&quot;. At the age of four, she was refused entry to primary school because of her young age. Indignant at the rejection, she taught herself how to read and was admitted the next year. She and her sister spent much of their time at home reading poetry and novels by British writers, with Lord Byron in particular becoming a strong influence on De Claire&#x27;s writing style. Before long, De Claire herself was writing her own poetry. In her childhood poetry, De Claire wrote of her wishes to be different and her love of nature. Anarchist Hippolyte Havel described her earliest poems as including a &quot;vein of sadness&quot;; after Adelaide rediscovered these poems in the 1930s, she expressed regret that her family did not recognize De Claire&#x27;s &quot;beautiful spirit&quot;. 

In the 1870s, De Claire&#x27;s father left St. Johns to seek work elsewhere and never returned home. In early 1879, De Claire was sent to live with her father in Port Huron, after Adelaide fell gravely ill and their mother was unable to care for them both. The now-adolescent De Claire became restless and homesick in Port Huron, which she regarded as a &quot;nasty hole&quot;. In September 1880, her father enrolled her to be educated in the convent of Our Lady of Lake Huron, across the river in the Canadian city of Sarnia. He hoped the institution would discipline her and rid her of her love of idle reading. De Claire considered her three years at the convent to have been a prison sentence. She never understood nor forgave her father for sending her there, and felt abandoned by him. Within a few weeks of arriving at the convent, she attempted to escape, but was forced to turn back after she realized she would never make it to St. Johns.

===Catholic education===
At the convent, De Claire attended services and classes given by the Carmelite nuns, of whom only one was kind to her. As a Protestant, she was not compelled to recite the Catholic prayers and was allowed to read the Bible. Her correspondence was monitored and sometimes withheld by the nuns. Adelaide recounted that her sister could not speak openly about how she was punished by the nuns, but once told her of how other students were forbidden from speaking to her for a week. After some weeks, De Claire&#x27;s homesickness partly subsided and her reactions against the rules imposed on her became more tempered. When she was allowed to visit her father, she seized the opportunity to write her mother an uncensored letter that the nuns could not read; she admitted that she was opening up to the education and reassured her mother that she was not having Catholicism imposed on her.

In her time at the convent, De Claire improved her grasp on writing and music, became fluent in the French language and learned how to play the piano. Her anti-Catholicism was tempered by her time in the convent, as she developed a sympathy for the Catholic Church&#x27;s aesthetics and ethics, particularly its charity towards the poor and its ideal of fraternity. She even considered joining the Carmelite order as a nun. Despite her convictions, her skepticism intensified and she began to doubt the existence of the Christian God. She later recalled how difficult this process was, as her internal struggle between disbelief and &quot;religious superstition&quot; coincided with the struggle between her own rebellious spirit and obedience to the nuns&#x27; authority. It was during this time that she became a freethinker, like her father before her, and punishments for her insubordination increased up until the moment she began her final exams. 

On December 20, 1883, she submitted her graduation essay, for which she graduated with a gold medal. De Claire&#x27;s time in the convent was a formative experience for her. By the time of her graduation, she was already a committed anti-theist and anti-authoritarian. She later recounted that this experience with &quot;Ignorance and Superstition&quot;, had convinced her that her own will was supreme and laid the foundations for her later conversion to anarchism.

==Political career==
===Freethought===
At the age of 17, De Claire returned home to St. Johns, where she found that the convent&#x27;s education had left her unprepared to find work. Again struggling with poverty, she offered her services as a private tutor for handwriting, music and the French language; in late 1885, she moved in with her aunt in Greenville, Michigan, to pursue this line of work. By this time, she had become a convinced freethinker. Over the subsequent years, she became an active participant in the freethought movement, giving lectures at their meetings and writing for their periodicals. It was through atheism that she first came into contact with anarchism, as the two tendencies often crossed over due to their rejection of clerical and political authority. 

In 1886, she moved to Grand Rapids, where she became editor-in-chief of the weekly freethought magazine &quot;The Progressive Age&quot;. She published several essays and stories under the pen name of &quot;Fanny Fern&quot;, adopted from the popular writer of the same name. From 1887, she also changed how she signed her real name, from Voltairine De Claire to Voltairine de Cleyre. During this time, she went on speaking tours at freethought events, where she frequently recounted her experiences in the convent. Hundreds of people, sometimes even thousands, would travel to attend de Cleyre&#x27;s lectures. De Cleyre considered herself &quot;more of a writer&quot; than an orator, expressing contempt for the disjointed and repetitive character of extemporaneous speaking. Her speeches were always carefully prepared, pre-written and read from paper. 

As the years went by, de Cleyre became increasingly famous among freethinking circles, motivating her to undertake lecture tours for the American Secular Union, which took her throughout the Midwestern and Northeastern United States. She would always return to Michigan, where she would stay at her place in Grand Rapids, her aunt&#x27;s house in Greenville, or visit her family in St. Johns; her sister and mother disapproved of her new-found radical politics and talked very little about their opinions. 

Demand for de Cleyre as a speaker and writer grew throughout the United States, as she contributed prose and poetry to several freethought periodicals, including &quot;The Truth Seeker&quot;. She enjoyed traveling around the country and seeing the &quot;wonderful sweet things&quot; of the world, although she also reported of the poverty and repression she saw. By this time, de Cleyre had begun to consider the freethought movement too narrow in scope, which led her to branch out into other social reform movements. Her travels brought her into contact with the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, as well as socialism and anarchism.

===Conversion to anarchism===
In December 1887, de Cleyre attended a lecture by the socialist Clarence Darrow, whose speech introduced her to the socialist program for improving the conditions of the working classes. She quickly became a convinced anti-capitalist, writing denunciations of the &quot;coal-kings&quot; and &quot;salt-owners&quot; that created monopolies, unemployment and the exploitation of labor. She proudly considered herself a socialist and began to write about socialist themes in her essays and speeches, which progressed from a freethinking rejection of clerical authority to a rejection of all forms of oppression. Debates and discussions with Jewish anarchists in Pittsburgh influenced her to begin studying anarchist theory, driving her towards the individualist anarchism advocated in Benjamin Tucker&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Liberty&quot;. Before long, she had abandoned state socialism and began moving towards anarchism.
De Cleyre&#x27;s conversion to anarchism was accelerated by the Haymarket affair. After a bomb was thrown at police during a workers&#x27; rally in Chicago, eight men who had organized the rally were found guilty in a show trial. The affair deeply affected de Cleyre, who dedicated poems to people who had defended the Haymarket anarchists, and later attended annual commemorations of the affair. 

When news of the bombing had first reached her, she initially felt outraged and proclaimed that the perpetrators &quot;ought to be hanged&quot;, a reaction which she immediately regretted. She followed the trial enthusiastically, quickly coming to the conclusion that the men had been falsely accused and that the trial was a farce, which led her to question whether &quot;justice under the law&quot; was really possible. When four of the men were hanged, they became martyrs in her eyes. She soon embraced their ideal of anarchism, a philosophy she would hold to for the rest of her life. 

The following year, de Cleyre had a series of romantic affairs which left a lasting impact on her life. She fell deeply in love with Thomas Hamilton Garside, a Scottish labor union organizer, but he abandoned her after a few months, leaving her emotionally devastated. De Cleyre was comforted by Dyer Lum, a man 27 years older than her who became a stabilizing influence in her life, and with whom she expressed their mutual love through poetry. Under Lum&#x27;s guidance, her understanding of anarchism developed and matured. De Cleyre came to reject both communist and collectivist anarchism, aligning instead with Lum&#x27;s understanding of mutualism and adopting his evolutionary ethics. The two aligned with each other in both political ideology and personal temperament, from their synthesis of socialism and individualism to their struggles with depression. Their affair was ultimately unstable and short-lived, as Lum was unwilling to leave his wife and de Cleyre continued to pursue romantic affairs with other men, although they would remain friends and collaborators until Lum&#x27;s death in 1893.

===Move to Philadelphia, motherhood and tutoring===

In June 1888, de Cleyre visited Philadelphia for the first time, having been invited to speak at a freethinkers&#x27; meeting. She was so impressed by the city that she decided to move there the following year, making the city her home for the next two decades. There she met the freethinker James B. Elliott, with whom she had a brief romantic relationship. As de Cleyre refused Elliott&#x27;s proposal of marriage, it quickly broke down and they separated, although they remained friends and lived together for several years afterwards. During this time, de Cleyre became pregnant; it was not a happy memory for her, as her pregnancy was characterized by long periods of pain and sickness. She considered having an abortion, but her doctor advised against it, believing her health was not strong enough to sustain one. On June 12, 1890, de Cleyre gave birth to their son Harry, but her chronic condition and depressive mood made her feel physically and emotionally incapable of raising him. She soon went off to lecture at freethought events in Kansas, where she remained for almost a year. She returned to Philadelphia in 1891, but she largely stayed away from her son. Her sister Adelaide, herself childless, asked if she could take care of Harry, to which de Cleyre responded that it was up to Elliott to decide; he refused. The rest of de Cleyre&#x27;s correspondence from this period never mentions her son.

In Philadelphia, de Cleyre began tutoring Jewish anarchist immigrants in the English language, which provided her with a small income. She still lived in poor conditions and her work exhausted her, but her lack of professional education meant that she had no options for alternative lines of work. Her income was only occasionally supplemented by translation and publishing work. She lived an austere lifestyle, possessing few clothes and eating very little, which, combined with overwork, worsened her chronic illness. During this time, she took on hundreds of Jewish students and became friends with many more. In her later essay, &quot;The Making of an Anarchist&quot;, she praised the Jewish community&#x27;s dedication to their education and commitment to the radical movement, even in the face of extreme poverty and antisemitism in the United States. But she was also worried by the tendency of some of her Jewish comrades to assimilate into the dominant American capitalist culture, relinquishing social change for individual advancement.

While she taught her students the English language, de Cleyre herself endeavored to learn Yiddish, eventually becoming fluent in it. She regularly read and contributed articles to the Yiddish anarchist magazine, the &quot;Fraye Arbeter Shtime&quot;, warning the editor Saul Yanovsky against cutting up or changing her words when translating them from English. She also translated Yiddish essays and articles from &quot;Mother Earth&quot;, and even tried her hand at writing original works in Yiddish, but only one has survived. Meanwhile, a number of her own pupils, including Nathan Navro and Joseph J. Cohen, gained enough fluency in English to publish articles in Anglophone anarchist publications. 

She was particularly attracted to her young student Samuel H. Gordon, who later became her lover and political collaborator. She paid for his medical education, after which he began to move away from anarchism as he saw personal professional success. As time went on, they argued more frequently and more angrily, with one particularly bad argument ending in them both taking poison, although they both survived. De Cleyre herself claimed that the argument was because she had rejected his marriage proposal, refusing to become a domestic housewife.

===Feud with Emma Goldman===

In August 1893, de Cleyre first met the anarchist activist Emma Goldman. She attended a rally that Goldman was due to address, but when Goldman was arrested before she could speak, de Cleyre spoke in her place, protesting against the suppression of freedom of speech. They met again in December, when de Cleyre travelled to New York to speak in her defense. She visited Goldman in her cell on Blackwell&#x27;s Island, where they discussed anarchism and the recent imprisonment of Alexander Berkman. Back in Philadelphia, de Cleyre wrote that she would soon return to see Goldman, together with her partner Gordon. But Gordon was a follower of Johann Most, who had publicly denounced Berkman and Goldman. Goldman informed de Cleyre that she preferred not to see Gordon, as it would have used up one of her two monthly prison visitations. De Cleyre was hurt by the rebuff and did not write back; she did not even speak to Goldman after her release. They only briefly resumed contact when Goldman appealed for de Cleyre&#x27;s help in campaigning for the reduction of Berkman&#x27;s prison sentence.

Although they shared an anarchist feminist outlook, the two had divergent backgrounds and personalities. Historian Paul Avrich said that de Cleyre and Goldman differed &quot;as poetry differs from prose&quot;, while their mutual friend Carl Nold compared their oratory respectively to a violin and a bass drum. De Cleyre herself disliked Goldman&#x27;s style of public speaking and writing, dismissing her work as &quot;incoherent&quot;, while also privately admitting their &quot;force&quot;. De Cleyre criticised Goldman&#x27;s indulgences in material pleasures, which provoked a reaction from the latter. De Cleyre&#x27;s &quot;puritan&quot; resentment of what she perceived as middle-class extravagance, from social drinking to birthday parties, drew criticism from other anarchists. She routinely denounced respectability politics and intellectualism, which she thought was moving the anarchist movement away from the working class and towards the bourgeoisie. Goldman took this as a personal attack and denied the charges, while also defending her appeals to the middle classes.

===Agitation, education and organization===
By the end of the 19th century, de Cleyre had become one of the leading public figures of the American anarchist movement. She acted as a link between the Jewish immigrants and American workers of Philadelphia, and contributed several articles, poems and stories to many anarchist publications. She delivered numerous lectures throughout the Northeastern United States. Her regular speaking engagements included commemorations of the Paris Commune, which took place each March, and memorial meetings for the Haymarket martyrs, which took place each May. At one such meeting, she praised Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld for pardoning the Haymarket defendants, declaring that he had &quot;sacrificed his political career to an act of justice&quot;. She believed that the Haymarket martyrs had not died in vain, as their sacrifice had served to invigorate the anarchist movement.

She was also active as a movement functionary, organizing meetings, establishing groups and distributing literature. In the early 1890s, she established an anarchist study group together with Dyer Lum, and in 1892, she co-founded the Ladies&#x27; Liberal League (LLL), a freethinking feminist group which organized forums on various political subjects. Through the LLL, she met Margaret Perle McLeod and Natasha Noshkin, with whom she helped establish a Radical Library that provided an education space for Jewish anarchists in Philadelphia. She also became friends with the Danish-American anarchist Mary Hansen and her English partner George Brown, with whom she regularly had dinner and discussed literature, eventually moving in with them in 1894.

Over time, de Cleyre&#x27;s tutoring work, anarchist activism and sustained poverty had exhausted her. Aside from visiting her friends, she lived a rather isolated and secluded life, kept company by her pet cats, birds and fish. Although often lonely and depressed, de Cleyre cherished the independence she had in Philadelphia and thought herself strong for living her life according to her own principles.

===Travels in Britain===

In 1895, de Cleyre began contributing to &quot;The Rebel&quot;, an anarchist communist magazine founded by the English anarchist Charles Mowbray, for whom de Cleyre had previously raised funds for his legal defense against sedition charges. Although she wrote under a &quot;nom de plume&quot; and disagreed with communist economics, she was briefly considered for the role of editor-in-chief. As her health declined due to overwork and arguments with her partner Gordon increased, her fellow magazine contributors Harry Kelly and John Turner convinced her to visit the United Kingdom. She set sail on June 13, 1897, arriving in England within a week. She stayed in London for two months, as a guest in John and Mary Turner&#x27;s house. She was introduced to the Freedom Group, as well as the German historian Max Nettlau, Jewish anarchist editor Abraham Frumkin and the labor organizer William Wess.

Through Wess, she met the famous Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, who told her about his escape from the Russian Empire over a cup of tea. She also met Mary Turner&#x27;s sister-in-law Lizzie Bell, the wife of Thomas Hastie Bell, with whom she became fast friends and stayed in each other&#x27;s company throughout de Cleyre&#x27;s time in Britain. She was a repeat visitor of the British Museum, where she saw Lord Byron&#x27;s own handwriting; she also paid her respects at Byron&#x27;s grave. She even traveled to visit Stonehenge, which she had wanted to see her whole life. In contrast, she strongly disliked London due to its heavy air pollution. She was nevertheless very happy among her friends in the city, which provided a much-needed break from her work life, causing her health and mood to sharply improve.

In August 1897, a group of Spanish anarchists arrived in London, having escaped the severe political repression of the Montjuïc trials. De Cleyre, who herself had been active in spreading awareness of the repression in Spain, greeted 28 of the Spanish refugees upon their arrival. After their wounds were treated by a doctor, they held a mass meeting in Trafalgar Square and a number of smaller meetings in private homes. They described to de Cleyre the repression they had faced and showed her the scars left by their torture in the Montjuïc Castle. At one of these meetings, the Italian anarchist Michele Angiolillo resolved to assassinate the Spanish prime minister Antonio Cánovas del Castillo. De Cleyre sympathized with his attack against Castillo, writing three poems and a short story about him. His execution inspired her to write another poem, &quot;Light Upon Waldheim&quot;, in which she lovingly described the Haymarket Martyrs&#x27; Monument in Waldheim Cemetery. Her meetings with the Spanish anarchists, who had strengthened her commitment to libertarian and anti-authoritarian thought, also inspired her to begin learning the Spanish language. She was most impressed by Fernando Tarrida del Mármol, from whom she adopted and developed the philosophy of anarchism without adjectives. During this time, she also met a number of French anarchists, including former Communards, such as Jean Grave. In mid-August, she took a week-long trip to Paris, where she met Sébastien Faure, saw the city&#x27;s sites and paid her respects to the revolutionaries buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery.

After returning to Britain, she decided to visit Scotland. While staying in Glasgow&#x27;s neighborhood of Govanhill with Maggie and Will Duff, she quickly fell in love with the country, remarking that if she could make a living there, she would never return to America. She gave a series of lectures in all of Scotland&#x27;s major cities, remarking with sadness that Dundee had been &quot;disfigured by vomiting chimneys&quot; and reporting of its problems with child labor. Before she left, the Duffs gave her a poetry collection by the English socialist Francis Adams. In September 1897, she left Glasgow and returned to London, stopping off at Bradford, Leeds and Manchester, where she gave a series of lectures on anarchism and feminism. Back in London, she gave one final address to the Jewish anarchists at the South Place Ethical Society, before returning to America.

===Return to activism in America===
De Cleyre was reinvigorated by her time in Britain and immediately returned to her writing and speaking engagements. She began writing regular reports on the United States for the &quot;Freedom&quot; newspaper in London, and started a translation of Jean Grave&#x27;s &quot;Moribund Society and Anarchy&quot;. Her work on the latter was accelerated by the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, as she thought the book had been made more relevant by the rise of American imperialism. Although she criticized the United States&#x27; involvement in the war, she did not offer an unqualified condemnation of the war itself, due to her belief that the Spanish Empire needed to be broken up, even if a government was required to do so.

Once again, she began to overwork herself and her health began to sharply decline. She returned to her tutoring work, which marginally improved her financial situation. Despite making so little money that she was malnourished, she refused to take any money from the anarchist movement. In order to conserve her energy, she curbed her speaking and writing efforts, passing her &quot;American Notes&quot; column at &quot;Freedom&quot; over to Harry Kelly. She was able to find a quiet farm in Torresdale, owned by the spiritualist Sada Bailey Fowler, where being closer to nature provided a peaceful and relaxing environment for her to recover in.

She soon returned to Philadelphia and went back to tutoring, writing and public speaking tours. While in Chicago in November 1899, she met the Russian social revolutionary Nahum Berman with whom she briefly had a relationship before returning to Philadelphia. He died only a few months after she left. Inspired by Berman, she established another anarchist reading group, the Social Science Club, which soon became the foremost anarchist group in Philadelphia. Together with other members of the group, she moved into a house in Fairmount Avenue. By this time, her partner Samuel H. Gordon had graduated as a Doctor of Medicine, left the anarchist movement and broken up with de Cleyre after she rejected his marriage proposal. De Cleyre and her anarchist group held a number of public meetings outside Philadelphia City Hall, where she gave speeches and distributed leaflets, gaining hundreds of new converts to the anarchist movement. De Cleyre and George Brown also gave lectures to high school and university students, and distributed anarchist propaganda at labor union meetings.

===Repression and direct action===
The group&#x27;s propaganda activities began to face difficulties in the wake of the assassination of William McKinley by Leon Czolgosz, which unleashed a wave of political repression against the anarchist movement. De Cleyre hoped that the widespread anti-anarchist sentiment would subside, but it continued unabated over the subsequent weeks. Philadelphia police raided anarchist clubs, broke up their public meetings and surveilled their members. Although de Cleyre herself was never arrested, she publicly denounced the political repression. In March 1902, after Senator Joseph R. Hawley offered $1,000 () to take a shot at an anarchist, de Cleyre publicly accepted his challenge in an open letter published in the &quot;Free Society&quot; newspaper.

Although she did not agree with his assassination, she remarked that assassination attempts were an occupational hazard of being a head of state. De Cleyre believed McKinley&#x27;s support for capitalism and imperialism had been responsible for his own death. Although de Cleyre had previously rejected violence as a pacifist, her sympathy for Czolgosz&#x27;s attack against McKinley marked a turning point, as she increasingly began to accept violent methods such as propaganda of the deed. She continued to believe that violent action was almost always unreasonable, she came to consider that there were some cases in which violence became the only effective way of opposing tyranny. To de Cleyre, anarchists should not preach violence, but should not condemn violent acts against the system either. She believed that violent attacks by individuals were inevitable responses to the severity of state violence. She sympathized with the self-sacrifice displayed by anarchist assassins, and mourned them when they were executed. While never abandoning her preference for non-violence and education, she also began to vocally support acts of &quot;direct action&quot;.

==Later life==
===Assassination attempt and declining health===
On December 19, 1902, de Cleyre was shot three times at point blank range by Herman Helcher, a former student who had developed an obsession with her and harbored paranoid delusions about her actions. One bullet embedded in her chest and two more were lodged in her back. She was rushed to the Hahnemann University Hospital, but as the establishment practiced homeopathy, no surgery to remove the bullets was performed. Although the wounds were presumed to be fatal, she recovered after a few days.

De Cleyre refused to identify or press charges against Helcher. She expressed empathy for his situation, due to his mental disorder and extreme poverty, which she believed had driven him to attempt such an act of violence. While she was still in recovery, she publicly defended him, refusing to appear as a witness in his trial and campaigning for his release from jail. She appealed to &quot;Free Society&quot; in an open letter, asking that her comrades in the anarchist movement show him forgiveness and organize a defense fund for him. Despite her appeals, Helcher was found guilty of attempted murder. He was committed to a mental asylum, where he died.

De Cleyre returned home from hospital on January 2, 1903. She soon resumed her regular life, giving public lectures on the issue of &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; before audiences of hundreds of people. She rallied against the prison system, declaring that, in all the years of retributive justice, states had never been able to eliminate crime. She rejected the criminal psychology of Cesare Lombroso, doubting his hypothesis that criminals were naturally inclined to commit crime. She admitted that some criminals were driven by mental disorders, like Helcher himself, but believed that they ought to be treated medically rather than subjected to carceral punishment. To de Cleyre, prisons failed as institutions of rehabilitation, as they cultivated bitterness in prisoners and alienated them from society. She thus called for the abolition of retributive justice by resolving the material conditions that drove people to crime. De Cleyre&#x27;s response to her own attempted murder gained her substantial sympathy from the public and generated publicity in the Philadelphia press.

By May 1903, de Cleyre had fully resumed her anarchist activism, rallying support for a textile workers&#x27; strike in Germantown. But her activities again exhausted her and, on the advice of her doctors to seek rest and recuperation, she decided to take a trip to Norway. As her trip coincided with German kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s state visit to Norway, the local press speculated whether she was intending to assassinate him and she was closely surveilled by the Norwegian police from the moment she arrived. She visited Christiania and spent weeks hiking in the countryside of Nes, but ended up being disappointed with Norway&#x27;s &quot;chilly&quot; climate and people and decided instead to visit Glasgow. After giving a public speech on anarchism at a meeting of the Norwegian Labour Party, she departed for Scotland, where she again stayed with the Duffs. She then went to London, where she met the German anarchist Rudolf Rocker, a fellow Yiddish-speaking gentile, and gave a lecture at the South Place Institute.

Upon her return to the United States, her health suddenly experienced a dramatic decline; her chronic condition was finally diagnosed as an atrophy of tissues caused by a catarrh in her nose. By early 1904, the infection had spread to the rest of her head and her ears, causing her to temporarily experience hearing loss and leaving her with a loud pounding noise in her ears that lasted for the rest of her life. The infection compelled her to rest and recuperate, as the pain caused her difficulty in speaking and prevented her from concentrating on her writing. She nevertheless wrote on a weekly basis to John Turner, while he awaited deportation. Her health failed to improve, even after spending a month at the Philadelphia Jewish Hospital and two further months at a farm in Torresdale. She then went to the Medico-Chirurgical Hospital, where she stayed from September 1904 to January 1905. During this time, she experienced regular convulsions and her condition was presumed fatal; Moses Harman prepared an obituary and memorial issue of &quot;Lucifer&quot; for her. Natasha Noshkin and Emma Goldman themselves established the &quot;Friends of Voltairine de Cleyre&quot; group, which appealed for financial support from the anarchist movement. Goldman, who had not seen de Cleyre since their feud, committed herself fully to supporting her. Hillel Solotaroff approached Samuel Gordon to request he help his former lover and benefactor, but Gordon refused.

Despite her condition, on Christmas Day of 1904, de Cleyre left the hospital to attend a meeting being held by the Russian Socialist Revolutionary Catherine Breshkovsky. De Cleyre attempted to speak at the meeting, but her condition prevented her from doing so and her friends forced her to return to hospital. After she left hospital, her mother came to care for her, but her health failed to improve. Before long, the intense pain caused by her chronic illness made her contemplate suicide. After her mother returned to Michigan, she took a morphine overdose, leaving a suicide note in which she committed her body to research at the Hahnemann Medical College, but the morphine did not kill her. Under Nathan Navro&#x27;s care, she made a recovery, although she would remain in chronic pain and weakened health for the rest of her life.

===Return to writing===

After three years of severe illness, by the spring of 1906, de Cleyre had regained enough of her strength to return to her regular activities. By October 1906, she was organizing a lecture series for the Social Science Club and addressing the annual Haymarket memorial event in Chicago. She then went on another lecture tour, speaking at freethought meetings in several cities of the Northeastern United States. While visiting New York, she visited Emma Goldman and spoke together with her at anarchist meetings; their relationship had improved substantially since Goldman had aided de Cleyre through her illness. De Cleyre was happy to hear news from Goldman that the anarchist movement was growing throughout the continent, but regretted that her health prevented her from visiting the Pacific coast. Before long, de Cleyre once again began referring to Goldman as her &quot;friend and comrade&quot; and later defended her against attacks from an English socialist paper. She also contributed essays, short stories and poems to Goldman&#x27;s magazine &quot;Mother Earth&quot;, which gave her a platform to discuss many of the debates within the anarchist movement. 

Through this publication, de Cleyre met its editor Alexander Berkman. She attempted to start a weekly publication with Berkman, but the project was not realized during her lifetime, only taking form in 1916 with the publication of &quot;The Blast&quot;. Over the summer of 1906, the two became close friends. She gave him advice for writing and editing his memoirs; she proofread every page, issued corrections and style suggestions. De Cleyre predicted that it would be hailed as a masterpiece, and her biographer Paul Avrich partly credits her for the book&#x27;s positive reception.

===Free speech fights===

During the Panic of 1907, which saw millions of workers lose their jobs, the Philadelphia anarchists organized a series of unemployment demonstrations and mass meetings. In an address to unemployed workers on February 20, 1908, De Cleyre spoke out against the capitalist system and called for workers to expropriate the means of production and private property. After a workers&#x27; demonstration on Broad Street was escalated into a riot and broken up by police, de Cleyre herself was arrested for the first and only time in her life. Her arresting officers were surprised that she did not resemble the stereotypical anarchist and that her papers included revolutionary poems about worms.

She and Chaim Weinberg were tried on June 18, 1908, but as the prosecution failed to produce a witness, the judge rendered a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict. When Italian workers implicated in the Broad Street Riot were sentenced to several years of penal labor, de Cleyre immediately established a defense committee in order to raise funds for the convicted workers and agitate for their release. By 1909, she managed to secure the release of two of the prisoners.

The Broad Street Riot came at a time when a number of unemployment riots and free speech fights were breaking out throughout the country. On June 30, 1909, a mass meeting was held at the Cooper Union by the National Free Speech Committee, on which de Cleyre was one of the leading anarchist members. At the meeting, she declared that the only way that freedom of speech could be defended was by continuing to speak freely. When the police prevented Emma Goldman from speaking at a number of public meetings in Philadelphia, de Cleyre organized rallies against police censorship and in defense of her freedom of speech.

===Worsening depression===
While continuing to teach in the evenings, de Cleyre dedicated herself to anarchist activism, overseeing the integration of the Social Science Club and Radical Library into The Workers Circle. She began earning enough money from her teaching to move into a well-furnished apartment, but her chronic illness still caused her severe and constant pain. She wrote to Berkman that she had begun to hate life itself, which she saw as having caused endless suffering. She became isolated and fell into a deep depression. When she was visited by Samuel Gordon, she apparently did not recognize him, even though she still kept a picture of him on her wall. She increasingly remarked that joy no longer appealed to her; her depression left her without hope and sapped her of her energy. 

She went back to her family home in St. Johns to spend some time with her mother. She also visited Port Huron and Sarnia, finding that both towns had experienced great urban decay. Her return to the land of her childhood provoked a sense of nostalgia within her, but she ultimately resolved to return to Philadelphia. By December 1909, she was back in Philadelphia, where her depression again resurfaced. 

As de Cleyre&#x27;s depression worsened, she began to lose her faith in anarchism, coming to believe that societal ignorance and prejudice were too strong to overcome. In February 1910, she rejected Berkman&#x27;s invitation to speak in New York as she felt that she had nothing to say. Berkman now found himself providing de Cleyre with moral support; he suggested that she leave Philadelphia to do another lecture tour, but she rebuffed him. Joseph Cohen likewise suggested she do a lecture tour and she rebuffed him too, proclaiming that she no longer believed in her former anarchist philosophy. But as her depression continued, she began to reconsider their suggestions that she could benefit from a change in location. By August 1910, she had decided to move to Chicago.

===Ferrer movement activism===

In October 1910, she left Philadelphia, moving through New York while lecturing on several subjects. In Buffalo, New York, she addressed a meeting of the Ferrer movement, which had formed after the execution of the Spanish pedagogue Francesc Ferrer. She sympathized with Ferrer&#x27;s anti-authoritarian and secular approach to education, and denounced the Spanish state for executing a teacher. She lectured on the need for &quot;integral&quot; education to improve people&#x27;s skills, without interference from the church or state. Alongside book learning, she believed that children ought to be educated by observing nature and doing things for themselves. Her ideal school was a boarding school in the countryside, with a farm and workshop provided for children to learn any craft of their choosing. Her educational letters received criticism from a number of Buffalo newspapers, which prompted her to point out that her formal education had been in a Catholic school but her own philosophy had been shaped by her experiences in life.

From Buffalo, she moved on to Cleveland, where she addressed another meeting of the Ferrer movement. She recalled that a priest had become so angry with her anti-Catholic remarks that he went to get a police officer, but never managed to return with one. She then traveled through Michigan, finally arriving in Chicago in time to address the annual Haymarket memorial event. She rented a room in the city from the local Jewish anarchists Jacob and Anna Livshis. In Chicago, she again supported herself through tutoring work, gaining many clients after posting an advert in the &quot;Fraye Arbeter Shtime&quot;. Through teaching English and mathematics, she was able to earn a weekly salary of $13.50 (), part of which she sent to her mother.

She continued her lectures in Chicago, giving weekly talks at the city&#x27;s Modern School. Despite her interest in pedagogy, she largely did not teach children, as she disliked being around them. She also became more critical of the Ferrer movement due to its vague educational programme, which she felt did not clearly outline what it wanted children to learn and how. She was dissatisfied with the Chicago Modern School, which she described as chaotic and disordered. She left the school in January 1911 and turned down an offer from Alexander Berkman to take over management of a Ferrer school in New York. She worried that activists had hastily joined the Ferrer movement without understanding what such education entailed. Before long, she had become completely disillusioned with the Ferrer movement and began to think that the best way to change education was to convert teachers within state schools to progressive methods.

===Support for the Mexican Revolution===

Her change in location ultimately failed to affect her mood, and de Cleyre once again fell into a depression. She found it increasingly difficult to write, lacked the confidence that drove her during her earlier years, and became apathetic towards her earlier political beliefs. Physically and emotionally exhausted, she became irritable towards those around her, finding living in the communal Livshis house difficult due to its lack of privacy. She longed for peace and quiet, even finding herself desiring to return to a convent. Just as her depression was reaching its lowest point, the Mexican Revolution broke out. 

Her spirits were rapidly lifted and she devoted herself to supporting the revolution. She believed that the events in Mexico were the social revolution she had been waiting for most of her adult life. She found the direct action of the Mexican peasant movement to be a refreshing alternative to the urban &quot;theory-spinners&quot; of the American anarchist publications. She denounced the racism expressed by White Americans towards the indigenous Mexican and Mestizo revolutionaries, exhalting their desire for land and freedom and rejecting American stereotypes of &quot;Mexican laziness&quot;. By July 1911, she was working for the Magonist newspaper &quot;Regeneración&quot;. She also established the Mexican Liberal Defense League, for which she served as treasurer. 

She appealed for funds from anarchist newspapers and groups. She defended the revolution at both public and private meetings, and distributed copies of &quot;Regeneración&quot; and William C. Owen&#x27;s pamphlets throughout Chicago. She was ultimately dissatisfied with the $250 () which she managed to collect for the revolution, expressing frustration that American libertarians had been so slow and ineffectual in aiding the struggling Mexican revolutionaries. During this time, she met and began a relationship with the Czech anarchist Joseph Kucera, who she collaborated with closely on her activities to support the revolution. She also studied the Spanish language and planned to travel to Los Angeles, but her illness prevented her from going, so Kucera went instead. Her last published poem was dedicated to the Mexican Revolution.

===Final years and death===
In her later years, de Cleyre developed a strong sympathy for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), which moved her closer to left-wing politics and anti-capitalism. At the same time, she abandoned her long-held pacifism, began advocating for violent social revolution and appealed for her readers to carry out direct action. In the wake of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; bombing in 1910, she wrote a letter to Saul Yanovsky in which she expressed regret that the bombing had not killed the paper&#x27;s publisher, Harrison Gray Otis. In a subsequent letter to Alexander Berkman, she reported of her new-found &quot;class consciousness&quot; and belief in class conflict. Together with Berkman and Goldman, she publicly defended the bombing suspects, the McNamaras, and accused the labor leaders Samuel Gompers and Morris Hillquit of hypocrisy for demanding they be punished. She asked why they had not demanded justice for the many more workers who had died in the Johnstown Flood of 1889, Panic of 1907 and Cherry Mine disaster of 1909, and declared that such events had made violence against the capitalist system a necessity. During the San Diego free speech fight of 1912, she expressed outrage that one hundred members of the IWW &quot;had been made to kneel and kiss the flag&quot;, declaring that she would rather have been shot than forced to prostrate herself.

Despite her failing health, she over-worked herself writing letters, giving speeches, organizing meetings and demonstrations and editing others&#x27; memoirs. By April 1912, her health broke under fatigue. She experienced chronic pain, headaches and sensory overload, exacerbated by the extreme weather in Chicago. She also experienced social isolation and homesickness for Philadelphia. On April 17, she came down with an attack of otitis media. She was moved to the St. Mary of Nazareth Hospital, where her infection was found to have spread to her brain. By the time that her son and Nathan Navro had arrived from Philadelphia, she had lost the ability to speak or move her body, though she expressed her disapproval of a passing priest with a scowl. De Cleyre spent the last nine weeks of her life in pain in her hospital bed, finally dying on June 20, 1912.
Three days later, her body was buried at the Waldheim Cemetery, next to the tomb of the Haymarket martyrs. Her funeral was attended by 2,000 people, including representatives of several trade unions. De Cleyre&#x27;s sister Addie recalled Lucy Parsons arranging red carnations on her casket, while the crowd stood in silence. Simultaneous gatherings were held in Philadelphia and New York. When Emma Goldman returned to Chicago from a lecture tour, she immediately went to lay flowers at her grave, where she expressed her feeling that the Haymarket martyrs had gained another member.

== Political thought ==
===Anarchism===

From an early age, de Cleyre despised authority and loved liberty; when pressed as to why she considered herself an anarchist, she responded &quot;because I cannot help it&quot;. She was driven towards anarchism by the Haymarket affair and was specifically drawn to the individualist anarchism of Benjamin Tucker, although she never adopted the label of &quot;individualist&quot; for herself. De Cleyre believed that the state was unable to solve poverty, and even contributed to worsening it. She saw anarchism as a means to change social conditions by establishing freedom and abolishing authority over individuals, a common cause she noted across all anarchist schools of thought.

She considered herself to be an anarchist without adjectives, rejecting qualifying economic labels, as she was more interested in changing social conditions and believed that free economic experimentation ought to be upheld. She believed that no future anarchist society would comply with prescriptive proposals from the present day. To her, internecine conflicts over economic ideology resembled Christian schisms between &quot;inquisitors&quot; and &quot;heretics&quot;. De Cleyre also rejected the supposition that anarchism was an inherently violent or foreign ideology, instead upholding a peaceful approach to anarchism that was in keeping with American revolutionary traditions of self-governance and decentralization.

===Feminism===
Alongside Emma Goldman, de Cleyre was one of the main figures of anarchist feminism at the turn of the century in the United States. They advocated for the abolition of gender roles, which they saw as an extension of political authority into the personal domain, and for the establishment of women&#x27;s self-determination. De Cleyre rejected the idea that gender roles were natural, pointing out that they were products of socialization, where girls were prohibited from exhibiting masculine behavior and vice versa. 

De Cleyre&#x27;s feminist writings confronted issues that most mainstream feminists of her time ignored, such as women&#x27;s sexuality, economic independence and patriarchal family structures. She rejected the institutions of marriage and the nuclear family, which she saw as inherently oppressive to women, as it positioned women as subservient to and dependent on men. She also rejected the concept of women&#x27;s &quot;natural rights&quot;, calling instead for women to empower themselves, stand up and fight for gender equality. She also believed that, if material conditions changed so that poverty were eliminated, gender inequality would in turn disappear. 

To de Cleyre, the Church and State both played central roles in the oppression of women, with the former teaching that women are inherently inferior, while the latter prohibited women from discussing issues such as marital rape through obscenity laws and prevented women from achieving economic independence by protecting monopoly capitalism and wage labor.

===Freethought===
De Cleyre was a staunch opponent of the Christian Church, influenced by her time spent in a Catholic convent as a child, which had initially led her to reject superstition, embrace freethought and advocate for the separation of church and state. She entered the freethought movement at a time of heightened puritanism, when advocating against religion presented a genuine physical danger to her and other freethinking activists. Inspired by freethinking women such as Ella Gibson, Victoria Woodhull, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frances Wright, Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Matilda Joslyn Gage, de Cleyre broke from her religious education and &quot;buried her past self&quot;. 

Pointing out the influence that parents had on their child&#x27;s early intellectual development, which often resulted in the indoctrination of religious ideas, she emphasised the importance of teaching children critical thinking. De Cleyre herself came to believe that the &quot;God-Idea&quot; presented an inherent danger to society, as it was used to suppress liberty and women&#x27;s rights. She instead called for people to embrace rationalism and the scientific method; to de Cleyre, truth results from freedom, rather than force. She rejected the institutions of the church, state and marriage as authoritarian, considering them to be analogous to slavery. She thus saw anarchism, freethought and feminism as &quot;inextricably intertwined&quot;.

===Libertarianism===
De Cleyre believed that each historical era had a &quot;dominant idea&quot; that people adhered to, and that in her own period in time, this dominant idea was economic materialism or &quot;Thing-Worship&quot;. In counterposition to this, she upheld individuals&#x27; free will and moral responsibility to commit themselves to their own ideals. She also accepted the influence that material conditions had on people&#x27;s actions, and while she believed each person was responsible for their own actions, she rejected retributive justice as a solution to criminal behavior, instead proposing the abolition of poverty as a way to solve crime. She was also a fierce advocate of freedom of speech, speaking out against censorship and defending people from political repression even when she disagreed with what they had to say. De Cleyre was committed to what poet Franklin Rosemont called &quot;wild freedom&quot;.

== Legacy ==
===Tributes===

De Cleyre was eulogised in &quot;Regeneración&quot; and &quot;Mother Earth&quot;. Emma Goldman said that de Cleyre was &quot;beautiful in her spiritual defiance and filled with the revolt of a flaming ideal&quot;. Jay Fox said that &quot;her memory will linger long, like the odor of a fragrant rose crushed at full bloom&quot;. From Glasgow, her friend Will Duff wrote that she was &quot;tombed in the true hearts that loved [her] well&quot;. Tributes to her were also written for a memorial issue of &quot;Mother Earth&quot; by Alexander Berkman. German anarcho-syndicalist Rudolf Rocker called her &quot;one of the most wonderful women that America has given the world&quot;. German anarchist historian Max Nettlau called her &quot;the pearl of Anarchy&quot; who shone with &quot;libertarian feeling and artistic beauty&quot;. Romanian-American anarchist Marcus Graham said she was &quot;the most thoughtful woman anarchist&quot; of her century.

Her nurse Annie Livshis compiled a memorial collection of her poems, portrait and favorite song, and sent her fur hat to her mother with a letter of appreciation. Later in 1912, de Cleyre&#x27;s friends, led by Alexander Berkman, formed a committee to collect and publish her writings. Berkman&#x27;s own &quot;Prison Memoirs&quot;, which de Cleyre helped edit, was published after her death. Berkman returned the favor by editing her own writings into a collection of &quot;Selected Works&quot;, which was published by Mother Earth in 1914. Her son Harry de Cleyre treated her &quot;Selected Works&quot; as his own personal Bible, praising her for her &quot;stubborn defense of those being oppressed&quot;. De Cleyre&#x27;s mother Harriet also began signing her name as &quot;Harriet de Cleyre&quot;, in tribute to her late daughter.

In her biography of de Cleyre, Emma Goldman described her as the &quot;most gifted and brilliant Anarchist woman America ever produced&quot;. Goldman considered her biography of de Cleyre to be among her best work, although it was later found to have included a number of factual errors and distortions. When Goldman died, according to her wishes, she was buried near de Cleyre and the Haymarket anarchists at Waldheim Cemetery. On the anniversary of de Cleyre&#x27;s death, memorial meetings were held in cities throughout the United States. George Edwards set her poem &quot;The Hurricane&quot; to music, Leonard Abbott cited her in his lecture series on radical literature, and her poems were regularly recited at the Ferrer Colony.

===Influence===
A. J. Brigati considered de Cleyre to be among the most influential figures of the freethought movement. American politician Leonard Abbott placed her alongside Louise Michel and Emma Goldman, who he considered to be &quot;the three great anarchist women of modern times&quot;. Libertarian feminist scholar Sharon Presley considered de Cleyre&#x27;s feminist writings to be among her &quot;most important theoretical contributions&quot;, noting how many of her views anticipated contemporary feminist arguments on gender roles and institutional oppression.

Already in the 1930s, Emma Goldman remarked that de Cleyre&#x27;s life and work &quot;had little influence in America, which of course did not speak against her. It was due to her personality as it was hard for her to get out of her shell&quot;. Goldman regretted that, after de Cleyre&#x27;s death, no prominent American public figure had taken up anarchism as their &quot;life&#x27;s goal&quot;. She thought that the lack of public figures was responsible for the stagnation of the anarchist movement. George Brown thought that &quot;had [de Cleyre] done the same work in some popular cause, she would have been famous and the world would have acclaimed her, as I believe her to have been, the greatest woman America has produced&quot;.

===Historical recognition===
Compared with other leading figures in American anarchism, de Cleyre has received relatively little scholarly attention. Many historians of classical anarchism neglected to give her attention, others perpetuated factual errors and myths about her, and even Max Nettlau&#x27;s work on her has been obscure or unpublished. Her work was also largely neglected from collections of anarchist and feminist works, with only her essay &quot;Anarchism and American Traditions&quot; receiving attention from documentarians. Historian Paul Avrich attributed this scholarly neglect to her short life, which ended before the major events of the early 20th century.

Paul Avrich&#x27;s 1978 book &quot;An American Anarchist&quot; has been credited as one of the main contributions to scholarship about de Cleyre, who, as of the early 21st century, remained largely unstudied in academic circles. In 2004, A. J. Brigati edited and published the first modern collection of her work, &quot;The Voltairine de Cleyre Reader&quot;, which included annotations and scholarly analysis of her life and work. In 2005, two more collections of her speeches and articles were published: &quot;Exquisite Rebel: The Essays of Voltairine de Cleyre – Anarchist, Feminist, Genius&quot;, edited by Presley and Crispin Sartwell and published by SUNY Press, and &quot;Gates of Freedom: Voltairine de Cleyre and the Revolution of the Mind&quot;, from University of Michigan Press.

<text>Josevata Taliga &quot;Joe&quot; Rokocoko (pronounced , born 6 June 1983) is a New Zealand former professional rugby union player, who played as a wing.

Born in Fiji, Rokocoko grew up in New Zealand and played for the Blues and Auckland. He later played for French clubs Bayonne and Racing 92.

He won 68 caps for New Zealand between 2003 and 2010, and scored 46 tries. He is New Zealand&#x27;s joint-second-top try scorer.

==Early life==
Born 6 June 1983 in Nadi, Fiji, Rokocoko migrated to New Zealand with his family at the age of 5, settling in Weymouth, South Auckland, and he attended James Cook High School. Rokocoko later won a scholarship to Saint Kentigern College, where he was a member of the 2001 National Secondary Schools team. After an outstanding career with New Zealand international sides at the under-16, under-19, and under-21 level, he started playing Super 12 rugby.

==Playing career==
Rokocoko played for the Blues in the 2003 Super 12 season. He made his first appearance for the All Blacks on 14 June 2003 against England. He had a high strike rate for the All Blacks, scoring 25 tries in his first 20 tests, and breaking the All Blacks single-season record for test tries previously shared by Jonah Lomu and Christian Cullen—his 17 test tries scored in 2003 is the highest for any player in one season. The International Rugby Players&#x27; Association named him new player of the year in 2003. His incredible speed has been seen many times throughout his career. On 19 June 2004, in the All Blacks&#x27; second 2004 test with England, Rokocoko shredded the England defence for three tries in a 36–12 All Blacks victory over the reigning Rugby World Cup champions.

Rokocoko returned to the All Blacks line-up for the 2005 Tri Nations Series, punctuating his comeback with a two-try effort in the All Blacks&#x27; pivotal home fixture against South Africa. By the end of the 2006 season he had scored 35 tries in 39 test matches – and in total scored 46 tries with the All Blacks in 68 tests, including 4 hat-tricks: against France (2003), Australia (2003), England (2004) and Romania (2007). He scored his first try since the 2007 Rugby World Cup against Italy in June 2009.

In 2011, after 68 games for New Zealand and 96 for the Blues, he signed with Aviron Bayonnais of the Top 14. He played for Aviron Bayonnais for a total of four seasons, where he made a positional switch from wing to centre during his time there. In July 2015, it was announced that Rokocoko had signed a contract with Racing Metro 92, and will link up with a host of other New Zealanders plying their trade at this club in Paris. He debuted for them on Friday 21 August 2015, where Racing Metro recorded an emphatic victory over Toulon at Stade Mayol in Toulon. In the final of the 2015–16 Top 14 season Rokocoko scored a try as Racing defeated Toulon.

==Personal life==
Although often known as Joe, Rokocoko asked New Zealand rugby management to list his Christian birth name, Josevata, on team releases.

He is a cousin of former Auckland Blues and All Black winger Joeli Vidiri and New Zealand sevens player Iliesa Tanivula. He and fellow All Black wing Sitiveni Sivivatu regard themselves as cousins because Sivivatu lived with the Rokocoko family, but they are not blood relations.

In January 2008, Rokocoko married Beverly Politini, the daughter of Howard Politini, a Major in the Fiji Military, at a wedding attended by a large number of All Blacks. They have a son called Cypress Rokocoko.

<text>The Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices (HKETOs) are the trade offices of Hong Kong outside the territory. There are 14 HKETOs outside Hong Kong and China, and seven in China (four offices and three liaison units).

In addition to HKETOs, the Hong Kong Government has an office in Beijing, the capital of China, called the Office of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in Beijing.

== History ==
Prior to the transfer of sovereignty in 1997, Hong Kong&#x27;s commercial interests in its major trade markets were represented by Hong Kong Government Offices – consular matters were handled by the relevant British embassy or high commission. By 1982, the Hong Kong Government Offices, with locations in London, Brussels, Washington and Geneva, were placed under the then Councils and Administration Branch () of the Hong Kong Government.

HKETO Brussels is the second among all HKETOs, marking its 50th anniversary in 2015.

In preparation for the handover, the British and Chinese governments agreed that these offices should be renamed &quot;Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices&quot;, to make clear that they did not have diplomatic or consular functions. In the United Kingdom, the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office Act 1996 conferred a number of personal immunity and tax privileges on the HKETO in London.

Similar arrangements were negotiated with other host countries of HKETOs. For instance, the HKETO in Toronto is accredited by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada under the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office Privileges and Immunities Order, and HKETO in Sydney by the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1995.

&quot;Hong Kong Free Press&quot; revealed that HKTDC paid around HKD $84,000,000 from 2014 to 2020 to US lobbying firms, on behalf of the Hong Kong government, in an attempt to convince US politicians to object to the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The lobbyist contracts were signed by the HKTDC, and the HKETO in Washington D.C. gave instructions to the lobbyists.

== Functions ==
Hong Kong has full autonomy in the conduct of its external commercial relations. The Basic Law of the Hong Kong provides that it shall be a separate customs territory and may, using the name &#x27;Hong Kong, China&#x27;, participate in relevant international organisations and international trade agreements, such as the World Trade Organization.

The HKETOs concentrate most of their work on promoting Hong Kong&#x27;s economic and trade interests. The major function of HKETOs include:
* Enhancing understanding of Hong Kong among opinion-formers
* Monitoring developments that might affect Hong Kong&#x27;s economic and trading interests
* Liaising closely with the business and commercial sectors, politicians and the news media. 
* Organise events to promote Hong Kong&#x27;s image
* Regularly meeting with counterparts and contacts in the territories under their purview
* Organizes overseas visits of senior Hong Kong officials

HKETO London serves concurrently as Hong Kong&#x27;s permanent mission to the International Maritime Organization, HKETO Brussels to the European Union, and HKETO Geneva to the World Trade Organization.

In countries or territories where no HKETO is present, diplomatic missions of China have the duty to represent Hong Kong&#x27;s interests. Visa applications at these missions are, nevertheless, sent to and processed by the Immigration Department of Hong Kong.

== Organisation ==
Overseas HKETOs are placed under the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau of the Hong Kong Government. Offices of the Government of the Hong Kong in Beijing and other parts of mainland China are placed under the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau. The head of the HKETOs are usually called Director.

== Privileges and immunities ==
The privileges and immunities granted to the HKETOs are the result of negotiations with the host governments and these vary from one office to another. In some cases, the host governments (such as the United Kingdom, Australia and Germany) have granted certain privileges and immunities to the HKETOs through dedicated domestic legislation.

At present, all eleven overseas HKETOs have been granted certain privileges and immunities by respective host governments to facilitate the HKETOs to discharge their duties without intervention. Broadly speaking, the privileges and immunities enjoyed by the HKETOs mainly include the inviolability of premises, official correspondence, archives and documents as well as the exemption of premises and representatives from taxation.

HKETO Berlin (Germany) is the only regional representative office that has a quasi-diplomatic status.

== Locations ==
The HKETOs outside of mainland China, particularly those in Europe and Asia, have responsibilities for several countries. Those in the mainland similarly have responsibilities across several provinces.

<doc id="748629" wikidata="Q100257583" url="?curid=748629" title="Student rights in higher education">
<text>Student rights are those rights, such as civil, constitutional, contractual and consumer rights, which regulate student rights and freedoms and allow students to make use of their educational investment. These include such things as the right to free speech and association, to due process, equality, autonomy, safety and privacy, and accountability in contracts and advertising, which regulate the treatment of students by teachers and administrators. There is very little scholarship about student rights throughout the world. In general most countries have some kind of student rights (or rights that apply in the educational setting) enshrined in their laws and proceduralized by their court precedents. Some countries, like Romania, in the European Union, have comprehensive student bills of rights, which outline both rights and how they are to be proceduralized. Most countries, however, like the United States and Canada, do not have a cohesive bill of rights and students must use the courts to determine how rights precedents in one area apply in their own jurisdictions.

==Canada==
Canada, like the United States, has a number of laws and court precedents which regulate higher education and provide student rights. The Canadian Encyclopedia, which details issues of Canadian life and governance, states that in Canada &quot;Basically two sorts of rights apply to students: substantive rights – the actual rights that students should enjoy – and procedural rights – methods by which students claim their rights. This article is concerned with students in public institutions, although those in private schools can claim rights under the common law and provincial education Acts.&quot;

Canada does not yet have a national student Bill of Rights or comparable document. If and when one is put in place in Canada it is likely that this document will be called a Charter of Student Rights and Freedoms. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is equivalent to the National Bill of Rights in the United States. The Canadian national student union or government is the Canadian Federation of Students and it has not put forth any such bill.

==France==

===Privacy rights===

* Right to privacy in higher education
In the AlBaho Case, a French criminal court found three senior academics at the &quot;École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris&quot; (ICPSE) guilty of email espionage. This was the first incident where academic staff were found guilty of a criminal act as a result of a complaint made by a student – and where those staff members had the full support of their institution.

==United States==
==Romania==
Romania is the country with the greatest student rights legislation currently in place. In 2011 the National Alliance of Student Organizations in Romania, which is also part of the European Student Union, worked with the Romanian National Government to bring into law the Romanian National Student Code of Rights and Responsibilities. This document provides Romanian students with roughly a hundred theoretical and procedural rights necessary to ensure theoretical rights are fulfilled. This document includes the following rights:

==The student rights movement==
Students in both Europe and North America began calling for the expansion of civil rights and student rights during the Vietnam War era. They established legal rights by forming student unions and lobbying for institutional policies (thus, changing the cultural treatment of students), lobbying for legislative change on state and national levels and circulating petitions for the creation of national student rights bills. In America, for instance, students won the right to retain their civil rights in institutions of higher education. In Europe, this movement has been explosive. Students have banded together and formed unions in individual institutions, at the state and national levels and eventually at the continental level as the European Student Union. They have been instrumental in lobbying for rights in individual countries and in the EU in general. In 2011, for instance, Romania put forth an extensive national student bill of rights providing Romanian students with a hundred rights assembled in a clear and easy to access document. Europe has also set forth legislation stipulating the rights of EU students studying in other EU countries.

European students have used the tactics established during the global labour movement of the eighteen and nineteen hundreds to gain labour or work place standards. They have unionized, stated their demands both verbally and in writing (sometimes in the form of a proposed student bill of rights), publicized their message and gone on strike. During the labor movement, workers in the United States, for example, won the right to a 40-hour work week, to a minimum wage, to equal pay for equal work, to be paid on time, to contract rights, for safety standards, a complaint filing process etc. Students have, likewise, demanded that these regulations as well as civil, constitutional, contract and consumer rights, which regulate other industries, be applied to higher education.

The European student movement and the United States movement differ in a number of ways. These differences may be a factor in determining why European Students have been more successful in obtaining legally recognized student rights, from the right to access free education to the right to move and study freely from one EU country to the next, to the right to exercise their national legal rights in institutions of higher education.

===Differences between European and United States student movements===
* National student organization mandates: Different levels of student representation
The European Student Union ESU mandate requires the ESU to determine the demands of students and to convey them to legislators. The United States Student Association USSA also has a mandate to amplify the student voice in legal decision making but it does not stipulate how it will determine the student voice or ensure that it is representative of the students themselves. The ESU focuses on gathering input from students across the nation, creates a student bill of rights enabling students to critique it, proposes legislation to achieve these rights at both the state and continental level and then creates information resources so students know their rights. The USSA, determines its objectives through the USSA membership. USSA does not seem to conduct research across the nation or to state student objectives on their website so students can express a desire to add or delete from this list. If the USSA does conduct research they do not show this on their website, do not have a search function on the website and do not publish this information for students.
:* Currently, the ESU mandate is to &quot;promote the educational, social, economic and cultural interests of students&quot;, to &quot;represent, defend and strengthen students&#x27; educational, democratic and political and social rights and &quot;represent and promote the[m] ... at the European [continental] level towards all relevant bodies and in particular the European Union, Bologna Follow Up Group, Council of Europe and UNESCO.&quot; The ESU will accomplish this by &quot;conducting research&quot;, &quot;campaigns&quot;, &quot;conferences&quot;, &quot;trainings&quot;, &quot;partnership projects&quot;, &quot;providing information&quot;, and creating &quot;publications&quot; for &quot;students, policy-makers and higher education professionals&quot;.
:* The ASSU&#x27;s mandate is to &quot;develop[] current and future leaders and amplif[y] the student voice at the local, state, and national levels by mobilizing grassroots power to win concrete victories on student issues. The United States Student Association Foundation ensures the pipeline of effective student leadership by facilitating education, training and other development opportunities at national, state, and local levels in advocating for issues that affect students.&quot; The mission statement does not say how they intend to do these things but it seems from the website that they hold grass roots lobbying, student conferences and electoral training, and propose bills to the US Senate.
* National student organization mandates: Publicity for student demands
The ESU clearly states student demands through the nation and through the EU. They have compiled these demands into a student bill of rights, referred to as the 2008 Student Rights Charter. This document is not legally binding but it is a clear representation of all student demands. It helps students, institutions and governments understand what students are demanding and also helps student unions, in individual institutions, lobby for rights which help change the culture and treatment of students on a local level. The ESU has democratically created a proposed student bill of rights they want accepted in legislation at a national and continental level. These demands include: access to higher education, to student involvement in institutional governance, extracurricular support and curricular quality standards. Each right has been broken down into more detailed demands required to achieve these rights. While student associations in America are pushing for this, there has been no centralized effort through the national student association.

USSA Legislative initiatives have included student debt forgiveness, enabling undocumented immigrant students to attend college, allocating more governmental money toward institutions and students but again these objectives seem to be created by USSA members without national research on the student voice. There is no way to search their website to determine if they conduct research to gather input form students across the nation.
* Institutional student bodies: A student union focus vs. a student government focus.

The European student movement and the United States movement also differ on a local institutional level. In Europe most institutional student organizations are referred to as student unions which suggests that they are engaged in lobbying for student rights. In America these are referred to as Student Governments or Student Associations and the focus is more on learning the democratic process. The problem is, however, that most student governments only have about 20-25% representation in the Academic Senate or institutional decision making body and far less experience in democratic processes than other institutional representatives. Student governments focus on teaching students how to be leaders and participate in democracy where as unions focus more on determining the student voice and achieving student rights through lobbying.

<text>Dawn Elberta Wells (October 18, 1938 – December 30, 2020) was an American actress. She is best known for her role as Mary Ann Summers in the sitcom &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;.

==Early life==
Wells was born to Evelyn (née Steinbrenner) and Joe Wesley Wells in Reno, Nevada, where she attended and graduated from Reno High School. Her father owned a local Reno construction company called &quot;Wells Cargo&quot; (not to be confused with the trailer manufacturer). After high school graduation, Wells attended Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, where she majored in chemistry. She transferred to the University of Washington in Seattle, where she graduated in 1960 with a degree in theater arts and design. She was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority.

==Career==
In 1959, Wells was crowned Miss Nevada and represented her state in the Miss America 1960 pageant in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

In Hollywood, Wells made her debut on &quot;The Roaring 20&#x27;s&quot; and the movie &quot;The New Interns&quot; and was cast in episodes of such television series as &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;, &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; with Efrem Zimbalist Jr., &quot;Cheyenne&quot; with Clint Walker, &quot;Maverick&quot; with Jack Kelly, and &quot;Bonanza&quot; with Lorne Greene and Dan Blocker.

Wells appeared as a guest star on the &quot;Wagon Train&quot; episode &quot;The Captain Dan Brady Story&quot; with guest star Joseph Cotten, &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot; with Dale Robertson, &quot;87th Precinct&quot; with Robert Lansing, &quot;Surfside 6&quot; with Troy Donahue and Van Williams, &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; with Robert Conrad, &quot;Ripcord&quot; with Ken Curtis, &quot;The Everglades&quot; with Ron Hayes, &quot;The Detectives&quot; with Robert Taylor, &quot;Lawman&quot; with John Russell, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s World&quot; with Glenn Corbett, &quot;Channing&quot; with Jason Evers, &quot;Laramie&quot; with Robert Fuller, &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; with Gene Barry, &quot;The Invaders&quot; with Roy Thinnes, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; with Robert Conrad, &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; with Efrem Zimbalist Jr., &quot;Vega$&quot; with Robert Urich, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; with Ricardo Montalbán, &quot;Matt Houston&quot; with Lee Horsley, &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, &quot;Herman&#x27;s Head&quot; with William Ragsdale, &quot;Three Sisters&quot; with Vicki Lewis, &quot;Pastor Greg&quot; with Greg Robbins, and &quot;Roseanne&quot; with Roseanne Barr.

===&quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;===

She took her signature role of Mary Ann on &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; in 1964. The series aired for a total of 98 episodes from 1964 to 1967. She reprised her character in the various &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; specials, including the reunion cartoon spin-off &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Planet&quot; (1982–83), and three reunion TV-movies: &quot;Rescue from Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1978), &quot;The Castaways on Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1979), and &quot;The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1981). She also reprised her character in a 1987 episode of &quot;ALF&quot;, &quot;Somewhere Over the Rerun&quot;, and 1992 episode of &quot;Baywatch&quot;, &quot;Now Sit Right Back and You&#x27;ll Hear a Tale&quot;.

In 1993, Wells published &quot;Mary Ann&#x27;s Gilligan&#x27;s Island Cookbook&quot; with co-writers Ken Beck and Jim Clark, including a foreword by Bob Denver. Alan Hale Jr., who played The Skipper on &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, contributed a family recipe (Kansas Chicken and Dumplings) to her cookbook. Hale&#x27;s character was the inspiration behind recipes such as Skipper&#x27;s Coconut Cream Pie, Skipper&#x27;s Navy Bean Soup, and Skipper&#x27;s Goodbye Ribeye, and he is depicted as Skipper Jonas Grumby in numerous photographs throughout the book. She said in a 2014 interview with GoErie.com: &quot;Alan could not have been kinder to a young actress. He was a real peach.&quot;

In 1997, Wells starred as her &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; character in a music video for the song &quot;Mary Ann&quot; by the pop-punk band Squirtgun. The song describes an infatuation with Mary Ann and sings praises to the wholesome character, specifically choosing her over Ginger. The video reached the top 40 of MTV&#x27;s Alternative Music charts, and it was featured as part of a variety of alternative-themed music video programs.

In 2005, Wells consigned for sale her original gingham blouse and shorts ensemble from her signature role. Auction house Profiles in History sold it for $20,700.

In 2014, Wells released &quot;What Would Mary Ann Do? A Guide to Life&quot;, which she co-wrote with Steve Stinson. The book was released to coincide with the 50th anniversary of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;.
A recurring theme, in the form of a rivalry, developed from the show that posed the question, mainly to men, as to which one of the young female stars they preferred: Ginger or Mary Ann? Wells embraced the good-natured rivalry. During a 2014 interview with the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;, Wells said that she had a t-shirt that read: &quot;Ginger or Mary Ann, the ultimate dilemma.&quot; The question of which of these two characters men prefer endured long after the end of the series. &quot;You can go anywhere and say &#x27;Ginger or Mary Ann?&#x27; You don&#x27;t have to say what show it is. Everybody gets it. And I always win.&quot;

===Film===
Wells had small roles in the early-1960s films &quot;Palm Springs Weekend&quot; and &quot;The New Interns&quot;, and later starred with Michael Dante in the independent 1975 film &quot;Winterhawk&quot;, playing a Western settler kidnapped by a Native American chief. Her other films include &quot;The Town That Dreaded Sundown&quot;, &quot;Return to Boggy Creek&quot;, &quot;Lover&#x27;s Knot&quot;, &quot;Soulmates&quot;, &quot;Forever for Now&quot;, and &quot;Super Sucker&quot;. In fall 2011, she began filming &quot;Silent but Deadly&quot; (originally titled &quot;Hotel Arthritis&quot;), a comedy horror film released in 2012.

===Theater===
Following &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, Wells embarked on a theater career, appearing in nearly 100 theatrical productions as of July 2009. She spent the majority of the 1970s and 1980s touring in theater productions, notably the second national (bus and truck) tour of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Chapter Two&quot; (in the role of Jennie Malone), and replacing Lorna Luft as Sonia Walsk in the second national tour of &quot;They&#x27;re Playing Our Song&quot;. She also had a one-woman show at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 1985.

===MeTV===
In May 2016, Wells was named marketing ambassador to MeTV Network, which had begun airing reruns of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;.

==Humanitarian activities==
For several years, Wells operated a business, Wishing Wells Collections, making clothing for people with limited mobility. She was the founder of the Idaho Film and Television Institute, a not-for-profit, educational organization with &quot;a vision of education, technical training and economic development in Southeastern Idaho.&quot;.

Wells organized and founded SpudFest, an annual family film and festival in Driggs, Idaho, which was sponsored by Idaho Potatoes.

SpudFest held festivals from 2004 to 2008, and showcased film premieres, and included in-person festival appearances by classic TV icons, including Barbara Eden of &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; and actor Lou Ferrigno, who portrayed &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;.

Wells also lent her support to the Denver Foundation, a West Virginia charity chaired by Dreama Denver, widow of Wells&#x27; &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; co-star Bob Denver. In November 2009, she appeared at the Denver Foundation&#x27;s Christmas Wish Celebrity Auction, helping to raise funds for the disabled and disadvantaged in West Virginia.

==Personal life and death==
Wells married Larry Rosen, a talent agent, on October 27, 1962. The couple had no children, and divorced in 1967.

In 2018, a GoFundMe page was set up to help Wells cope with financial trouble from medical care after a fall.

In June 2020, Wells&#x27;s manager revealed in court documents that Wells was suffering from dementia.

Wells died from COVID-19 in Los Angeles, on December 30, 2020, at age 82, during the COVID-19 pandemic in California. The week before her death, she had recorded a Happy New Year video to be released on the holiday.

<text>Lewis Wetzel (1763 – 1808) was an American scout and frontiersman. Because of how feared he was by the Native American Tribes, he was nicknamed &quot;Death Wind&quot;. He stood about 5ft 10in with knee length black hair. He was an expert with a knife and tomahawk and was even deadlier with a black powder rifle, or musket. While running at full speed, Death Wind could load powder from his powder horn, a ball round and pack it, aim it and fire with expert marksmanship every time. Raised in what is now the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia, his exploits were once hailed as similar to those of Daniel Boone.

==Early and family life==

Possibly born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania in 1763, or on the South Branch of the Potomac River where his parents had moved before 1770, Lewis was the son of Mary Bonnet (1735–1805; daughter of Jean Jacques Bonnet, Flemish Huguenot) and John Wetzel (1733–1786; indentured servant emigrant from Germany&#x27;s Palatine region or Friedrichstal, Baden, Germany). The Wetzel and Bonnet families moved to the Wheeling Creek area in what is now the northern panhandle of West Virginia by 1770, as had the Zane, McColloch, Eberly, Rosencranz and other pioneer families. Such settlement had been illegal according to a treaty made by the British ending the French and Indian War, but the disputed Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768) (made with the Iroquois, traditional enemies of the Shawnee and other tribes of the areas being ceded) led many pioneers to again try westward settlement.

The Wetzel family settled in a fairly isolated location near the Ohio River about 14 miles from Fort Henry (which had been built at the confluence of Wheeling Creek to protect settlers from Indian raids). Despite the hardships of frontier living, several Wetzel children survived to adulthood: Martin (1757–1829), Jacob (1765–1827), John and George (d. 1786), as well as daughters Susannah Wetzel Goodrich (1767–1828) and Christina Wetzel Wolfe (1759–1786). As discussed below, the Wetzels suffered many raids by Native Americans. Raids became particularly severe following the murder of Chief Logan&#x27;s family near Fort Henry in 1774 (which led to Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War). The execution of Chief Cornstalk in 1777 at Fort Randolph (at the confluence of the Ohio and Kanawha Rivers, modern Point Pleasant, West Virginia) also led to attacks at Fort Henry. The elder John Wetzel, his son George and daughter Christina all died in raids in 1786, before Lewis Wetzel reached age 25, and led to his Indian-fighting career. Lewis Wetzel&#x27;s older brother, Martin (1757–1829), a friend of Daniel Boone and Simon Kenton, helped his father fight Native Americans in the Battle of Point Pleasant in 1774, and defended Fort Henry in 1777 and 1782, although one of his favorite frontier weapons was a tomahawk. His younger brother Jacob Wetzel (or Whetzel), helped construct a wagon road into central Indiana after fighting Indian wars in western Pennsylvania and the Northwest Territory with Kenton and under Generals Arthur St. Clair and William Henry Harrison.

==Indian fighter==
In 1778, Lewis, then 13, and his brother Jacob, 11, were tending the family&#x27;s corn field during a raid by Wyandot Native Americans, and taken prisoner but managed to escape two days later. A bullet grazed Lewis&#x27;s breastbone before his capture, but his captors were able to staunch the bleeding and lead the boys away. The boys managed to return to Fort Henry (modern Wheeling, West Virginia), which the Wetzel men also helped defend in September 1782. Wetzel grew to some six feet tall, and became striking and very athletic, but some considered him socially inept, in part because he never cut his hair, which grew extremely long and was held in a ponytail as often also done by Native Americans. He rationalized it as expecting he would be scalped as he had scalped many. His varied skills in what is now known as guerrilla warfare became famous.

In 1781, Col. Daniel Brodhead reached the main Turtle clan village of Gekelmukpechunk, now known as Newcomerstown, Ohio. He requested a peaceful discussion between the main chiefs of the village and three were sent to meet him. He hoped to secure the villagers&#x27; allegiance and enlist new warriors into his campaign. However, Lewis Wetzel&#x27;s younger brother Martin attacked one of the peaceful chiefs with a tomahawk from behind, killing him just as they had crossed the river. Fearing massive losses and an unplanned battle, Brodhead retreated and instead refocused his troops on their initial goal of reaching Coshocton.

In June 1786, four of the Wetzel men were returning by canoe from a hunting trip when they were attacked by tribesmen. Although Lewis Wetzel managed to canoe beyond musket range (and was not wounded), his father John and brother George died before reaching Baker&#x27;s Station, though his brother Martin survived his wound. At some point, the young man vowed to avenge his family.

Wetzel later participated in several military campaigns against Native American tribes in the Ohio region, and claimed to have taken 27 or 37 Native American scalps. He preferred to operate alone; military procedure did not suit him even while serving with the militia. He became renowned for an ability to load his rifle while sprinting (perhaps by using smaller shot than other frontiersman as well as for always holding a few bullets in his mouth), and which probably saved his life several times during raids although lead poisoning would have ongoing mental and physical effects.

Lewis Wetzel was implicated in the deaths of several friendly Native Americans, and he may have knived others to death as they slept. The most famous incident turning public opinion against him involved the Seneca Chief Tegunteh (whom American soldiers called &quot;George Washington&quot; for his upright character), who had traveled to Fort Harmar, near present-day Marietta, Ohio in 1788. Wetzel ambushed, shot and scalped Tegunteh on an isolated path; the dying chief survived long enough to identify his attacker. Wetzel readily admitted the deed on November 6 to Colonel Josiah Harmar, bragging “I´ll shoot ‘em down like the worthless dogs they are long as I live,” but escaped by sprinting away through the woods, and when recaptured two weeks later, clubbed his jailer with his chains and escaped again before trial; when captured in mid-December near Maysville, Kentucky and taken to Fort Washington (now Cincinnati), a 200-man mob led by Kenton threatened the peace and Harmar released Wetzel. The future President James Madison&#x27;s brother John Madison died in an attack near the Kanawha River while on a seven-month expedition with Wetzel as his scout, and the same account claims Lewis and Clark asked Wetzel to join their expedition (although mentioned in neither their letters or diaries).
Either following a suspended death sentence for killing a Native American in 1791 or as many Native Americans left the Ohio Valley following the 1795 Treaty of Greenville, Wetzel relocated to the Louisiana Territory and eventually to New Orleans, where he spent several years in prison for counterfeiting.

==Death and legacy==

Accounts about his final years vary. He had no known children, although several of his siblings had children, and some were named in his honor. Most likely Lewis Wetzel died in 1808 in Natchez, Mississippi, at the residence of his cousin Philip Sykes, since a skeleton matching Wetzel&#x27;s description including the long hair was exhumed along with a rifle and other equipment at Sykes&#x27; former farm. The remains were reinterred in the McCreary Cemetery in Marshall County, West Virginia. Some believe Wetzel married a Spanish woman, settled along the Brazos River and died in 1839.

Another Lewis Wetzel (1825–1862) of Point Pleasant, West Virginia (judge and newspaper editor) was one of the founders of the state of West Virginia, but murdered by another pro-Union founder, John Hall.
Martin Wetzel&#x27;s direct descendant, Robert Lewis Wetzel (his middle name reflecting this scout), of Clarksburg, West Virginia, was a veteran of the Korean and Vietnam wars, and rose to the rank of Lieutenant General and Corps commander during the Cold War.

Among places in West Virginia, Wetzel County, West Virginia, is named for him or his family, as is the Lewis Wetzel Wildlife Management Area. West Virginia has erected historical markers commemorating the Wetzel family near Limestone in Marshall County and specifically mentions Lewis Wetzel on the markers for Fort Beeler and Terra Alta in Preston County. An Ohio historical marker notes Lewis Wetzel&#x27;s involvement in the Broadhead Massacre of peaceful Indians at the Moravian mission.
The Western novelist Zane Grey wrote about Wetzel in his books &quot;Betty Zane&quot;, &quot;The Spirit of the Border&quot;, and &quot;The Last Trail&quot;. More recently, Allan W. Eckert recounts Wetzel&#x27;s exploits in &quot;That Dark and Bloody River.&quot;

<text>Billy Warlock (born William Alan Leming; March 26, 1961) is an American actor known for playing Eddie Kramer, a lifeguard on the first three seasons of &quot;Baywatch&quot; and in the reunion movie in 2003, as well as for numerous daytime roles, most notably Frankie Brady on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and A.J. Quartermaine on &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

==Early life==
Warlock was born William Alan Leming in Gardena, California, the son of Dick Warlock ( Richard Anthony Leming), a successful Hollywood stunt man who did stunts for Kurt Russell and was the stunt driver in the Disney picture, &quot;The Love Bug&quot;. His siblings include Lance Warlock and a sister, Rhonda.

After graduation from Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, California in 1979, his father landed him a stunt job as Robin Williams&#x27;s stunt double in a &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; episode, one that was produced by Garry Marshall. Several months later, Billy auditioned for Marshall and won his first major television role as Leopold &quot;Flip&quot; Phillips, Roger&#x27;s brother (and Marion Cunningham&#x27;s younger nephew), in the ninth and tenth seasons of &quot;Happy Days&quot;.

==Career==

As a young adult, Warlock had a small role in &quot;Halloween II&quot; (1981), and &quot;Lovely But Deadly&quot; (1981), directed by David Sheldon. He later appeared in &quot;Hotshot&quot; (1987), directed by Rick King, and played the lead role in the horror film &quot;Society&quot; (1989), directed by Brian Yuzna.

The same year, Warlock appeared as an original cast member of &quot;Baywatch&quot;, where he played lifeguard Eddie Kramer for the first three seasons. In the early 1990s, he also was on the short-lived TV Series &quot;The Hat Squad&quot;, with Nestor Serrano and Don Michael Paul from 1992 to 1993, and portrayed Lyle Menendez in the 1994 television movie &quot;Honor Thy Father and Mother: The True Story of the Menendez Murders&quot;.

He also starred on soap operas such as &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot;. In the latter, he portrayed A. J. Quartermaine from June 13, 1997, to December 11, 2003, and for several visits in 2005 from February 4 to February 11, when his character was presumed dead. He reprised the role from March 15 until April 26 when his character was actually murdered in his hospital room by Dr. Asher Thomas (Larry Poindexter) after he kidnapped his biological son, Michael Corinthos (Dylan Cash).

On &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, Warlock portrayed Frankie Brady from 1986 to 1988, from 1990 to 1991, and again beginning in June 2005. In 1988, he won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series for his performance on the series. He was let go from the soap and his final airdate was November 2006. In spring 2007, he joined the cast of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; in the role of Ben Hollander, Jack Abbott&#x27;s campaign manager. Warlock appeared on the show from May 2007 to January 2008.

In 2003, Warlock reprised his role of Eddie Kramer in the &quot;&quot; television film. The following year, he appeared in an off-Broadway revival production of &quot;The Normal Heart&quot; at the Public Theater in New York City. Charles Isherwood of &quot;Variety&quot; praised his performance as &quot;sincere and nicely understated.&quot; During the summer of 2010, Warlock appeared on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; as Anthony Blackthorn.

==Personal life==
Warlock was once engaged to his &quot;Baywatch&quot; co-star Erika Eleniak, who had played his character Eddie&#x27;s love interest on the show, Shauni McClain, as well. Warlock was married to soap actress Marcy Walker but they later divorced. He married former &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; and &quot;As the World Turns&quot; co-star Julie Pinson on August 26, 2006, in Las Vegas, Nevada.

<text>Monroe University is a private for-profit university in New York City. It was founded in 1933 and has campuses in the Bronx, New Rochelle and Saint Lucia, with degree programs also available through Monroe Online. It is named after James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States. It is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

==History==

The school was founded in 1933 by Mildred King as the Monroe School of Business, a women&#x27;s business school, in the West Farms section of the Bronx. The name came from the nearby James Monroe High School; the founder hoped that graduates of the high school might enroll at her new school of business. Classes were held at the site of the former Starlight Ballroom.

Monroe became an accredited junior college in 1972 when it earned the right to grant associate degrees; it was renamed to Monroe Business Institute. More classrooms were added on Morris Avenue, and in 1977 the West Farms facilities were closed and all Monroe programs were consolidated in the Fordham Road area.

In 1990 the school received accreditation from the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, and the name was again changed, to Monroe College. 

On-campus student housing was constructed at its New Rochelle, New York, location in 2003. In the same year, degree programs in hospitality, criminal justice and culinary arts were introduced. The college built Milavec Hall, a building for math, English and arts classes, and began construction of a 200-bed student housing building at its Main Street location in New York.

Online course options for business management and administration were introduced in 2004 and an MBA program was added in 2005.

<text>USS &quot;Torsk&quot;, hull number SS-423, is a built for the United States Navy during World War II. Armed with ten torpedo tubes, the &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarines were incremental developments of the highly-successful s that formed the backbone of the US Navy&#x27;s submarine force during the war. &quot;Torsk&quot; was laid down at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in June 1944, was launched in September that year, and commissioned in December.

In 1945, &quot;Torsk&quot; made two war patrols off Japan, sinking one cargo vessel and two coastal defense frigates. The latter of these, torpedoed on 14 August 1945, was the last enemy ship sunk by the United States Navy in World War II. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, she operated primarily as a training vessel; she also went on deployments to the Mediterranean Sea and helped to train elements of the Atlantic Fleet in anti-submarine tactics. Decommissioned in 1968, she replaced at the Washington Naval Yard, where she would serve for another three years training members of the Naval Reserve. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in December 1971 and turned over to the state of Maryland for use as a museum ship. She is now part of the fleet of Historic Ships in Baltimore.

==Name==
Following US Navy naming practice for submarines in the 1940s, &quot;Torsk&quot; was named for a fish: &quot;Torsk&quot; is the common name in the North American fishery for the Cusk, a cod-like fish in the family Lotidae. It is also a Scandinavian term for the Atlantic cod.

==Design==
The &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarines were incremental improvements of the preceding and es of fleet submarines that proved to be highly successful during operations against Japan in the Pacific War. The &quot;Tench&quot;es, the culmination of early wartime experiences, were the last submarine class to be built by the United States Navy during the war.

&quot;Torsk&quot; is long, with a beam of and a maximum draft of . She displaced surfaced and submerged. The &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarines were powered by four Fairbanks-Morse Model 38D8- 10-cylinder opposed piston diesel engines driving electrical generators. These were rated at for a maximum speed of on the surface. During underwater operations, she was powered by two 126-cell &quot;Sargo&quot; batteries that drove two low-speed direct-drive General Electric electric motors. Her electric motors provided and a top speed of submerged. While surfaced, she had a cruising radius of at a speed of . Her submerged endurance was limited by the life of her batteries, which at a speed of , would be depleted after 48 hours. She could carry enough provisions for her crew of ten officers and 71 enlisted men for 75 days of operations.

The submarine was armed with ten torpedo tubes, six of which were in the bow, with the other four located in her stern. These were supplied with a total of 28 torpedoes. She was also fitted with a /25 caliber deck gun and a Bofors 40 mm and Oerlikon 20 mm cannon.

==Service history==
===World War II===
The keel for &quot;Torsk&quot; was laid down at the Portsmouth Navy Yard on 7 June 1944, and the completed hull was launched on 6 September. Work was completed by the end of the year, and she was commissioned on 16 December. Beginning on 31 December, she began training exercises that lasted until 11 February 1945; five days later she sailed to Port Everglades, Florida, where she conducted anti-submarine experiments. The vessel remained there only briefly, and on 20 February, she got underway for the Pacific Ocean, passing through the Panama Canal and arriving in Hawaii on 23 March. There, she conducted further training and underwent repairs in preparation for her first war patrol.

&quot;Torsk&quot; cruised to Guam and then proceeded to Kii Suido in the Japanese home islands, arriving there on 11 May. While there, she patrolled for American air crews that had to bail out from damaged aircraft during their raids on Japan, but no aircraft went down in the area that day. Late on 11 May, she moved to the northeastern coast of Honshu, arriving two days later. Over the course of 14 and 15 May, she attempted to contact the submarine wolfpack operating in the area, and she finally rendezvoused with the submarines and the next day. She joined their patrols on the east coast of the island, but found no Japanese vessels in the area.

&quot;Torsk&quot; encountered a Japanese coastal minelayer on 2 June between Honshu and Hokkaido. She launched a spread of six torpedoes, but the minelayer evaded them, prompting &quot;Torsk&quot; to dive to evade the expected counter-attack that did not occur. Two days later, she located a freighter off Kobe Saki; she fired four torpedoes but again missed her target. &quot;Torsk&quot; departed the area on 5 June, bound for Midway Atoll, arriving there on 11 June; from there, she continued on to Pearl Harbor. After arriving on 16 June, she underwent a refit and began her second patrol on 17 July. She again sailed to Guam, where she stayed on 1 and 2 August, before continuing on to the Sea of Japan.

On 10 August, &quot;Torsk&quot; passed through the minefields in the Tsushima Strait, and the next day, she found and took aboard seven Japanese sailors from the merchant ship &quot;Koue Maru&quot; that had been sunk four days earlier. Later on the 11th, the submarine entered her patrol area. While patrolling off Dogo Island the next morning, she located a small freighter and sank her with a submerged torpedo attack. Off Ando Saki on 13 August, &quot;Torsk&quot; found several small fishing boats and another small freighter; she sank the latter and later that day, attempted to sink another cargo vessel in Wakasa Wan but her torpedoes missed.

On 14 August, she encountered a medium-sized cargo ship accompanied by a &quot;Kaibōkan&quot; type escort vessel steaming off （. When the two ships approached Kasumi Ko at 10:35, &quot;Torsk&quot; launched a new, experimental Mark 28 torpedo, an acoustic homing torpedo, at the &quot;Kaibōkan&quot;. The torpedo struck the ship and blew a hole in the stern, bending it up at a 30-degree angle and causing it to rapidly sink. &quot;Torsk&quot; then attempted to torpedo the freighter as it entered the harbor, but the torpedoes missed, possibly because they struck uncharted coral reefs.

At around 12:00, a second &quot;Kaibōkan&quot; arrived in the area to hunt for &quot;Torsk&quot;; the latter fired a second Mark 28 torpedo and then dove deep to evade any depth charge attacks. After reaching a depth of , she launched a Mark 27 torpedo, a passive acoustic torpedo. Shortly thereafter, the hydrophone operator detected a large explosion; this was the Mark 28 striking the &quot;Kaibōkan&quot;, and a minute later the Mark 27 struck the vessel as well. This proved to be the last Japanese warship to be sunk in World War II, as the Japanese government announced it would surrender the next day. Additional patrol vessels arrived in the area, and their presence, coupled with that of patrol aircraft, compelled &quot;Torsk&quot; to remain submerged for more than seven hours. She then surfaced and proceeded toward the Noto Peninsula. After receiving word of Japan&#x27;s surrender on 15 August, &quot;Torsk&quot; continued patrolling the Sea of Japan, conducting surveillance of Japanese installations and destroying any naval mines she encountered. On 1 September, she departed the area for the Marianas Islands, passing through the Tsushima Strait two days later, and arriving in Guam on 9 September, concluding her second patrol.

===1946–1971===
On 10 September, &quot;Torsk&quot; sailed from the Marianas, bound for Pearl Harbor. From there, she proceeded to the Panama Canal, sailed into the Atlantic and ultimately arrived in New London, Connecticut in mid-October. This was her home port for the next seven years, during which time she served primarily as a training ship. She was also involved with various tests and training exercises. The submarine was also used for Navy Reserve training cruises. She was assigned to Submarine Squadron 2 in June 1949 and in mid-1950 she was sent on a deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. She returned to New London later in the year for fleet maneuvers. In 1951, her training operations took her to the Caribbean Sea.

The vessel underwent the Fleet Snorkel conversion in early 1952, after which she went on another Mediterranean deployment in the middle of the year. She arrived back in New London on 27 November, after which she resumed her training duties. These activities took the boat as far north as Halifax, Nova Scotia and as far south as Havana, Cuba. &quot;Torsk&quot; was transferred to Submarine Squadron 6, based at Norfolk, Virginia. From there, she served as a training submarine for anti-submarine aircraft and surface ships to practice detecting and targeting. &quot;Torsk&quot; frequently cruised in the Caribbean throughout this period. She made a visit to the Great Lakes by way of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in June 1959, visiting numerous ports in Lake Ontario and Lake Michigan. She arrived back in Norfolk in mid-August.

&quot;Torsk&quot; resumed her Mediterranean deployments in the 1960s, which included a joint training exercise, &quot;New Broom X&quot;, with fleet units of British Commonwealth navies. She also continued to help train anti-submarine forces of the Atlantic Fleet. She participated in the blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962. The vessel was decommissioned on 4 March 1968. She was taken to the Boston Navy Yard and modified to be used as a Navy Reserve training vessel, stationed in the Washington Navy Yard. She operated there until 1971, and on 15 December she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register.

===Museum ship===

The Navy turned &quot;Torsk&quot; over to the state of Maryland on 26 September 1972 so she could be preserved as a museum ship; she was moored in the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, Maryland, where she remains today as part of the Historic Ships in Baltimore. As of 2024, &quot;Torsk&quot; is docked next to the LV116 Chesapeake and the National Aquarium (Pier 3). The &quot;Torsk&quot; Volunteer Association works hand-in-hand with Historic Ships in Baltimore to provide skilled restoration and maintenance activities for the vessel. &quot;Torsk&quot; was designated a National Historic Landmark on 14 January 1986. &quot;Torsk&quot; and its companions are major contributing elements in the Baltimore National Heritage Area.

<text>Faneuil Hall ( or ; previously ) is a marketplace and meeting hall located near the waterfront and today&#x27;s Government Center, in Boston, Massachusetts. Opened in 1742, it was the site of several speeches by Samuel Adams, James Otis, and others encouraging independence from Great Britain. It is now part of Boston National Historical Park and a well-known stop on the Freedom Trail. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;the Cradle of Liberty&quot;, though the building and location have ties to slavery.

In 2008, Faneuil Hall was rated number 4 in &quot;America&#x27;s 25 Most Visited Tourist Sites&quot; by &quot;Forbes Traveler&quot;.

==History==
===Eighteenth century===
After the project of erecting a public market house in Boston had been discussed for some years, colonial merchant and slave trader Peter Faneuil offered, at a public meeting in 1740, to build a suitable edifice at his own cost as a gift to the town. and although a vote of thanks was passed unanimously, his offer was accepted by a majority of only seven (367 to 360). Funded in part by profits from slave trading, the building was begun in Dock Square in September of the same year. It was built by artist John Smibert in 1740–1742 in the style of an English country market, with an open ground floor serving as the market house, and an assembly room above. According to Sean Hennessey, a National Park Service spokesman, some of Boston&#x27;s early slave auctions took place near Faneuil Hall.

In 1761, the hall was destroyed by fire, with nothing but the brick walls remaining. It was rebuilt by the town in 1762. In 1775, during the British occupation of Boston, it was used for a theatre.

=== Nineteenth century ===
In 1806, the hall was greatly expanded by Charles Bulfinch, doubling its height and width and adding a third floor. Four new bays were added, to make seven in all. The open arcades were enclosed, and the cupola was moved to the opposite end of the building. Bulfinch applied Doric brick pilasters to the lower two floors, with Ionic pilasters on the third floor. This renovation added galleries around the assembly hall and increased its height. Faneuil Hall was used for town meetings until 1822. Neighboring Quincy Market was constructed between 1824 and 1826.

Abolitionists met at the hall in the 1830s and formed the Committee of Vigilance and Safety to &quot;take all measures that they shall deem expedient to protect the colored people of this city in the enjoyment of their lives and liberties.&quot;

Faneuil Hall was entirely rebuilt of noncombustible materials in 1898–1899.

===Twentieth and twenty-first centuries===
On October 9, 1960, the building was designated a National Historic Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places following the passage of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, which placed all National Historic Landmarks in the National Register. The ground floor and basement were altered in 1979. The Hall was restored again in 1992, and in 1994 the building was designated a local Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission.

The headquarters of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts is located on the fourth floor and includes an armory, library, offices, quartermaster department, commissary, and a military museum with free admission.

====Faneuil Hall Marketplace====

Faneuil Hall is owned by the city of Boston, as is Quincy Market (commonly referred to as Faneuil Hall Marketplace), which includes three historic granite buildings—North Market, Quincy Market, and South Market—to the east of Faneuil Hall that operate as an indoor/outdoor mall and food eatery. The architect for the 1976 refurbishment and repositioning of Quincy Market was Benjamin Thompson and Associates and managed by the Rouse Company; its success in the late 1970s led to the emergence of similar marketplaces in other U.S. cities. It has since come under the ownership of the Ashkenazy Corp.

Faneuil Hall is not part of the festival marketplace known as Faneuil Hall Marketplace. Rather it is owned by the City of Boston and managed by the National Park Service.

The North and South Markets buildings are currently under study for landmark status by the Boston Landmarks Commission.

==Uses==
On Friday in early August 1890, one of the first black Republican legislators of Boston, Julius Caesar Chappelle, made a speech &quot;At the Cradle of Liberty&quot; in support of the Federal Elections bill that would help give Black people the right to vote. Chappelle was a Boston legislator from 1883 to 1886. The Faneuil Hall event was covered by the media in the United States, and the speech by Chappelle appeared in an August 9, 1890, article, &quot;At the Cradle of Liberty, Enthusiastic Endorsement of the Elections Bill, Faneuil Hall again Filled with Liberty Loving Bostonians to Urge a Free Ballot and Fare Count&quot; on the front page of &quot;The New York Age&quot; newspaper on Saturday, August 9, 1890.

On November 7, 1979, Faneuil Hall was the site of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy&#x27;s speech declaring his candidacy for president. On November 3, 2004, Faneuil Hall was the site of Senator John Kerry&#x27;s concession speech in the 2004 presidential election.

On April 11, 2006, Governor Mitt Romney signed Massachusetts&#x27; health care bill into law with a fife and drum band in Faneuil Hall before 300 ticketed guests.

On October 30, 2013, President Barack Obama delivered a defense of the Affordable Care Act from the same spot where Romney signed his state&#x27;s expansion of healthcare in 2006.

On November 2, 2014, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino lay in state in Faneuil Hall following his death on October 30, 2014.

The headquarters of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts has been in Faneuil Hall since 1746, currently on the 4th floor.

It is also still used for political debates between Massachusetts candidates as well as political shows, such as &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;.

==Name==
&quot;Faneuil&quot; is a French name, and is anglicized as or (rhyming with &quot;panel&quot; or &quot;Daniel&quot;). During the colonial era, it may have been pronounced as in &quot;funnel&quot;. At Peter Faneuil&#x27;s burial, only the Faneuil family crest was displayed on his headstone; its current inscription of &quot;P. Funel&quot; was added much later. In his 1825 novel &quot;Lionel Lincoln&quot;, James Fenimore Cooper used eye dialect for Bostonian characters to indicate that they pronounced it &quot;Funnel Hall&quot;.

Boston area locals often use the term &quot;Faneuil&quot; to refer to the entire surrounding neighborhood, particularly as a landmark for its vibrant nightlife.

In August 2017, amid heightened media coverage of the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials, the activist group New Democracy Coalition proposed that Faneuil Hall&#x27;s name be changed because of Peter Faneuil&#x27;s participation in the slave trade. In response to the proposal, Boston mayor Marty Walsh stated: &quot;We are not going to change the name of Faneuil Hall&quot;. Additional name change protests have followed, including activists chaining themselves to the front door and a sit-in.

==Building elements==
===Bell===
After a sixty-two year hiatus, the hall&#x27;s bell began ringing again in 2007 when a stuck clapper was freed and lubricated and new bellrope attached to the bell. Its last known ringing with its clapper had been at the end of World War II in 1945 (though it had been rung several times after that with a mallet).

===Grasshopper weather vane===
The gilded grasshopper weather vane on top of the building was created by Deacon Shem Drowne in 1742. Gilded with gold leaf, it weighs , is long, and is believed to be modeled after that of the London Royal Exchange, itself based upon the family crest of Thomas Gresham.
===Public art and landscape artwork===

The area between the eastern end of Faneuil Hall and Congress Street is part of Boston National Historical Park. In this landscape is a nineteenth-century sculpture of Samuel Adams created by sculptor Anne Whitney. The granite plaza surface is marked for with the approximate location of the early colonial shoreline c. 1630. The street layout and building plot plan designations from an 1820 map are shown by etched dashed lines and changes from pink granite to grey granite paving slabs. The shoreline marking artwork entitled, &quot;A Once and Future Shoreline,&quot; is made with etched silhouettes of seaweed, sea grass, fish, shells and other materials found along a high tide line.

Art within Faneuil Hall includes many paintings and sculpture busts of Revolutionary War activists, pre Civil War abolitionists, and political leaders.

<doc id="748661" wikidata="Q7414097" url="?curid=748661" title="San Francisco Public Utilities Commission">
<text>The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) is a public agency of the City and County of San Francisco that provides water, wastewater, and electric power services to the city. The SFPUC also provides wholesale water service to an additional 1.9 million customers in three other San Francisco Bay Area counties.

==Functions==

The SFPUC manages a complex water supply system consisting of reservoirs, tunnels, pipelines and treatment facilities and is the third largest municipal utility agency in California. The SFPUC provides fresh water from Hetch Hetchy Reservoir and other sources to 2.7 million customers for residential, commercial, and industrial uses. About one-third of its delivered water is sent to customers within San Francisco, while the remaining two-thirds are sent to customers in Alameda, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties.

The SFPUC has been an clean power provider for more than 100 years, when it began generating hydro power for the construction of the O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam. The SFPUC Power Enterprise includes two power programs: Hetch Hetchy Power and CleanPowerSF. 

Hetch Hetchy Power generates and delivers 100% greenhouse gas-free energy to more than 6,300 customer accounts, including municipal buildings and facilities, such as San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco International Airport, schools, libraries and the Muni transit system. Hetch Hetchy Power also provides electricity to some commercial and residential developments, including affordable housing sites.

The SFPUC also administers and operates CleanPowerSF, a Community Choice Aggregation program within the guidelines of California State law. 

Together, the SFPUC’s two power programs meet over 75% of the electricity demand in San Francisco. In 2023, CleanPowerSF and Hetch Hetchy Power collectively saved customers more than $170 million on electric bills compared to for-profit utility PG&amp;E. 

The SFPUC manages an extensive wastewater system that collects, conveys, and provides secondary treatment to combined sewage flows (both stormwater and sewage) within the City &amp; County of San Francisco before discharging it into the San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The Southeast Water Pollution Control Plant handles about 80% of the city&#x27;s wastewater, while the Oceanside Water Pollution Control Plant handles the remaining 20%. A third facility, the North Point Wet-Weather Facility, only operates during wet weather to provide primary treatment to combined sewage prior to discharging to the San Francisco Bay.

==Historical origins==
From the mid-19th Century, much of the Alameda County watershed was owned by the Spring Valley Water Company (SVWC), a private enterprise which held a monopoly on water service to San Francisco.

In 1906, William Bowers Bourn II, a major stockholder in the SVWC, and owner of the giant Empire Mine, hired Willis Polk to design a &quot;water temple&quot; atop the spot where three subterranean water mains converge, from the Arroyo de la Laguna and Alameda Creeks, the Sunol infiltration galleries, and a 30-inch pipeline from the artesian well field of Pleasanton.

Municipal efforts to buy out the SVWC had been a source of constant controversy from as early as 1873, when the first attempt to purchase it was turned down by San Francisco voters because the price was too high. Other sources claim that as one born into wealth and classically educated, Bourn was partially motivated by a sense of civic responsibility.

Prior to completion of the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct in 1934, half of San Francisco&#x27;s water supply, approximately 6 million gallons per day passed through the Sunol temple. The SVWC, including the temple, was purchased by the city of San Francisco in 1930 for US$40 million.

In 1932, a new city charter was adopted which established the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. At the time of its formation, the commission was responsible for the Hetch Hetchy Project, San Francisco Municipal Railway, Water Department, and Airport. The Airport was later transferred out of the SFPUC to the newly formed Airport Commission in 1971. Similarly, in 1994 the Municipal Railway was moved out to the separate Public Transportation Commission.

==Structure and leadership==
The SFPUC is headed by a board consisting of five Commissioners, who are nominated by the Mayor of San Francisco and confirmed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Each of the five Commissioners is chosen according to criteria set forth in the San Francisco City Charter:

Seat 1 on the Commission shall be a member with experience in environmental policy and an understanding of environmental justice issues. Seat 2 shall be a member with experience in ratepayer or consumer advocacy. Seat 3 shall be a member with experience in project finance. Seat 4 shall be a member with expertise in water systems, power systems, or public utility management, and Seat 5 shall be an at-large member.

The Commission meets on the second and fourth Tuesdays of each month. Their responsibility is to provide operational oversight in such areas as rates and charges for services, approval of contracts, and organizational policy.

The board appoints a General Manager as the chief executive of the SFPUC, with each division headed by an Assistant General Manager (AGM). The six divisions are: Business Services, External Affairs, Infrastructure, Power Enterprise, Water Enterprise, and Wastewater Enterprise.

==Controversy==
Then-SFPUC director Harlan Kelly resigned on November 30, 2020, charged with accepting bribes from a contractor. Kelly&#x27;s trial began in June 2023. Kelly was convicted in July 2023 of felony bribery and bank fraud and sentenced to four years in prison. 

==Environmental sustainability==
With the goal of improving sustainability and the city of San Francisco&#x27;s goal to become a &quot;zero emission city&quot; by 2030, the SFPUC is implementing a number of projects in all of its core businesses: water, power and sewer.

* Water: SFPUC is applying a &quot;Water System Improvement Program&quot; (WSIP) to manage a wide range of projects focusing on the optimization of pipelines, pump stations and water tanks usage.
* Power: SFPUC is generating and providing different typologies of clean energy (hydroelectric, solar and biogas) for municipal services and citizens needs. Moreover, in collaboration with Paradox Engineering is seeking to exploit street light pole developing an integrated infrastructure with the specific scope of monitor the usage of urban services, optimize the power consumption and consequently reduce waste.
* Sewer: SFPUC is applying the &quot;Sewer System Improvement Program&quot; (SSIP) to manage a wide range of projects that includes optimization of pump stations and wastewater treatment processes. In addition, SFPUC has applied over $50M of funding to pilot and are constructing various Low Impact Designs (LID) through their &quot;Early Implementation Projects&quot; to test if LID features such as bio-retention systems or creek daylighting projects would reduce the volume of stormwater that would be collected, conveyed and treated. By reducing the stormwater flows to the wastewater treatment plants, energy consumption may be reduced. SFPUC is equally committed to environmental justice causes and will address sewage flooding at many flood-prone neighborhoods in San Francisco: (1) Cayuga Avenue, (2) Alemany Circle, (3) Folsom and 17th Streets, (4) Toland Street, (5) Foerster Street, (6) Urbano Dr and Victoria Street, (7) Wawona Ave and 15th Ave. The low-lying areas of San Francisco along the San Francisco Bay is vulnerable to periodic flooding from runoff and wastewater during winter storms. Continued land subsidence, sea level rise, and urban growth in hitherto industrial neighborhoods will continue to challenge the runoff and sewage collection and conveyance system.

<doc id="748669" wikidata="Q4572296" url="?curid=748669" title="Clark Atlanta University">
<text>Clark Atlanta University (CAU or Clark Atlanta) is a private, Methodist, historically black research university in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. Clark Atlanta is the first Historically Black College or University (HBCU) in the Southern United States. Founded on September19, 1865, as Atlanta University, it consolidated with Clark College (established 1869) to form Clark Atlanta University in 1988. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

== History ==
Atlanta University was founded on September 19, 1865, as the first HBCU in the Southern United States. Atlanta University was the nation&#x27;s first graduate institution to award degrees to African Americans and the first to award bachelor&#x27;s degrees to African Americans in the South; Clark College (1869) was the nation&#x27;s first four-year liberal arts college to serve African-American students. The two consolidated in 1988 to form Clark Atlanta University.
=== Atlanta University ===
In the city of Atlanta, while the Civil War was well underway, two literate African American ex-slaves, James Tate and Grandison B. Daniels, in 1862 established the first school in Atlanta for African American children. It was located on the corner of Courtland and Jenkins Streets in an old church building of Friendship Baptist Church, the original home of First Baptist Church. Tate and Daniels, along with 25 other former slaves, founded Friendship Baptist Church, the first black Baptist autonomous congregation. They began holding classes in an old church building built in 1848. The building was badly damaged during the Siege of Atlanta in 1864. The school would later become Atlanta University in September 1865.

When white missionary Reverend Frederick Ayer, along with his wife, arrived in Atlanta in November 1865 under the auspices of the American Missionary Association, the AMA church purchased a boxcar for $310 (~$ in ) in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and sent it to Friendship by the Ninth Street Baptist Church of Cincinnati, Ohio. The modest space of the boxcar served two purposes: a new teaching space for Atlanta University and a meeting space for the Friendship Church congregation. Tate and Daniels readily transferred their responsibilities to Ayer, who was better prepared to lead the educational effort, in 1865.

Atlanta University was founded on September 19, 1865, by James Tate and Grandison Daniels. Two years later, Edmund Asa Ware of the American Missionary Association was appointed the first president. Atlanta University was chartered in 1867 with the assistance from Oliver Otis Howard of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau. He also appointed William J. White as educational agent of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau on January 12, 1867. White was the half-brother of founder James Tate and was the co-founder of the Augusta Institute in 1867, which would become Morehouse College. He served as trustee of Atlanta University in 1869.

Atlanta University—now Clark Atlanta University—is the first HBCU in the Southern United States, and the nation&#x27;s oldest graduate institution serving a predominantly African-American student body. It was chartered on October 17, 1867. It offered its first instruction at the postsecondary level in 1869. Its first graduating class was in 1873 (normal school for future teachers including women), and it awarded its first six bachelor&#x27;s degrees in June 1876.

Atlanta University was the first to accept women, and the first HBCU to have a women&#x27;s dormitory, North Hall, built in 1869. One woman earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Atlanta University between 1876 and 1895. Seven women received bachelor&#x27;s degrees from Atlanta University between 1895 and 1900. Atlanta University awarded bachelor&#x27;s degrees 53 years (1876–1929) before exclusively offering graduate degrees.

A 1912 catalog shows that Atlanta University had three divisions—the college and the normal school, each with a preparatory division. Enrollment that year was 403-40 college students, 62 normal students, 115 high school students in the college prep program and 183 high school students in the normal program. At that time half of the Atlanta University alumni were employed in teaching. There were a group of small Black colleges in Atlanta – Atlanta, Morehouse, Spelman, Clark, Morris Brown and Gammon – each guarding its independence but each dependent on Northern philanthropy. By the end of World War I, the Northern philanthropists were demanding mergers to improve educational quality. 1929 saw the creation of the Atlanta University Affiliation, in which Atlanta University took on a new role as the graduate school, with Morehouse and Spelman as undergraduate colleges. Before World War II, the Affiliation came to include other Black colleges in Atlanta. By 1988, Atlanta University merged with Clark College, becoming Clark Atlanta University on July 1, 1988.

North Hall – now Gaines Hall (Morris Brown College)
Atlanta University began on West Mitchell, about a mile from downtown Atlanta. Built in 1869 by architect William H. Parkins, North Hall, now Gaines Hall, marked the first female dormitory on the campus of a co-ed school in the United States. Gaines Hall stood as Atlanta University&#x27;s initial original building. A year later, South Hall opened for boys. Wings were added to each in 1871 and 1880. In 1882, Stone Hall opened as the main building, containing the chapel, lecture halls, recitation rooms, laboratories and administrative offices. By 1905 four more permanent buildings had been added, including a Carnegie Library. North Hall is the middle building, flanked by South Hall (left) and North Hall. South Hall was later demolished by Morris Brown College. A fire in mid-August 2015 threatened to raze the building completely. In October 2017, a court ruling returned the property to Clark Atlanta University.

Stone Hall – now Fountain Hall (Morris Brown College)
Erected in 1882 on the crest of Diamond Hill on the Morris Brown College campus, Fountain Hall is one of the earlier structures for the original site of Atlanta University. Historically, the hall is significant to the city, state, and nation for its role in providing higher education to Blacks in this country. It was for this reason that Fountain Hall was made a National Historic Landmark in 1975. Architecturally, this building is important as a work of G. L. Norrman. This Atlanta architect was active during the late nineteenth and very early twentieth centuries, but few of his works have survived. The three-story, red brick structure is also an excellent example of the High Victorian style, its clock tower a rare sight in Atlanta. Over its 138-year history, Fountain Hall has served as the location for administrative offices, as well as a number of other university activities, contributing greatly to the cultural fabric of the city through the education of its citizens.

From its construction in 1882 until 1929, Fountain Hall primarily functioned as the administration building for Atlanta University, though it contained a chapel, library, recitation rooms, and laboratories during various times in its history. It served in a similar capacity for Morris Brown College for many years. Currently, the structure contains offices, a chapel, art studios, and a gallery. Fountain Hall has been a gathering place and focus of activity in the education process of many of the mostly Black Americans attending the university and college since its construction. Because of the building&#x27;s location, Fountain Hall can be seen from some distance and has long served as an impressive and identifying landmark for the historic Atlanta University Center.

In the early 1930s, Morris Brown College was in financial trouble and was forced to give up its property at Houston and Boulevard. Since its affiliation with Spelman and Morehouse, Atlanta University was no longer using several of its original buildings. In 1932, Bishop W. A. Fountain, former college president and then chairman of the Board of Trustees, and his son, W. A. Fountain, Jr., President of Morris Brown, negotiated for the college to become part of the university system and lease some of the vacant buildings on the old campus. After this, Stone Hall became known as Fountain Hall, named for Bishop William A. Fountain. In the 1929, the college deeded the buildings, establishing a permanent home for Morris Brown College.

The Atlanta University campus was moved to its present site, and the modern organization of the Atlanta University Center emerged, with Clark College, Morris Brown College, and the Interdenominational Theological Center joining the affiliation later. The story of the Atlanta University over the next twenty years after 1930 includes many significant developments. Graduate Schools of Library Science, Education, and Business Administration were established in 1941, 1944, and 1946, respectively. The Atlanta School of Social Work, long associated with the university, gave up its charter in 1947 to become an integral part of the university. In 1957, the controlling boards of the six institutions (Atlanta University; Clark, Morehouse, Morris Brown and Spelman Colleges; and Gammon Theological Seminary) ratified new articles of affiliation. The new contract created the Atlanta University Center. The influence of Atlanta University has been extended through professional journals and organizations, including &quot;Phylon&quot;, and through the work of Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois, a member of the center.

The significance of Atlanta University Center rests in the quality of its leaders, faculty, and graduates. Edmund Asa Ware was Atlanta University&#x27;s spiritual and intellectual father. His dedication to academic excellence and rejection of racial inferiority influenced other black colleges and American education in general. John Hope, former Morehouse president and Atlanta University&#x27;s first black president, is noted in every history of American education during the first half of this century. Atlanta University&#x27;s most famous faculty member (1897–1910) was W. E. B. DuBois, who began the Atlanta Studies on Negro Sociology and later became the director of publications for the NAACP.

The influential Atlanta Sociological Laboratory was founded at Atlanta University in 1895.

===Clark College===
Clark College was founded in 1869 by the Methodist Episcopal Church, which later became the United Methodist Church as the nation&#x27;s first four-year liberal arts college to serve the primarily African-American student population. Originally named Clark University, the school was chartered and incorporated in 1877. It first offered instruction at the postsecondary level in 1879, and awarded its first degree (baccalaureate) in 1880. It became Clark College in 1940. It was named for Bishop Davis Wasgatt Clark, who was the first President of the Freedman&#x27;s Aid Society and became Bishop in 1864. A sparsely furnished room in Clark Chapel, a Methodist Episcopal church in Atlanta&#x27;s Summerhill section, housed the first Clark College class. In 1871, the school relocated to a new site on the newly purchased Whitehall and McDaniel Street property. In 1877, the School was chartered as Clark University.
An early benefactor, Bishop Gilbert Haven, visualized Clark as the &quot;university&quot; of all the Methodist schools founded for the education of freedmen. After the school changed locations several times, Bishop Haven, who succeeded Bishop Clark, was instrumental in acquiring in South Atlanta, where in 1880 the school conferred its first degree. In 1883, Clark established a theology department named for Dr. Elijah H. Gammon. In 1888 the Gammon School of Theology became an independent theological seminary, and is currently part of the Interdenominational Theological Center. Clark College merged with Atlanta University on July 1, 1988, to form Clark Atlanta University.

In 2010, the university was censured by the American Association of University Professors.

=== Philanthropy ===
In December 2020, MacKenzie Scott donated $15 million (~$ in ) to Clark Atlanta University. Her donation is the largest single gift in the history of the institution.

In September 2021, Clark Atlanta launched a 10-year $250 million capital campaign to raise scholarhips funds for more low-income students, advance research and teaching efforts, improve infrastructure and technology on campus, and to establish more endowment chairs and professorships.

<doc id="748682" wikidata="Q5327824" url="?curid=748682" title="East Bay Municipal Utility District">
<text>East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD), colloquially referred to as &quot;East Bay Mud&quot;, is a public utility district which provides water and sewage treatment services for an area of approximately in the eastern side of the San Francisco Bay. As of 2018, EBMUD provides drinking water for approximately 1.4 million people in portions of Alameda County and Contra Costa County in California, including the cities of Richmond, El Cerrito, Hercules, San Pablo, Pinole, Lafayette, Moraga, Orinda, Danville, Oakland, Piedmont, Emeryville, Berkeley, Albany, Alameda, San Leandro, neighboring unincorporated regions, and portions of cities such as Hayward and San Ramon. Sewage treatment services are provided for 685,000 people in an 88-square-mile area (as of 2018). EBMUD currently has an average annual growth rate of 0.8% and is projected to serve 1.6 million people by 2030. Headquartered in Oakland, EBMUD owns and maintains 2 water storage reservoirs on the Mokelumne River, 5 terminal reservoirs, of water transmission aqueducts, of water mains, 6 water treatment plants (WTPs), of wastewater interceptor sewer lines and a regional wastewater treatment facility (WWTF) rated at a maximum treatment capacity of 320 MGD.

==EBMUD Reservoirs==
* Camanche Reservoir
* Pardee Reservoir
* Briones Reservoir
* Lafayette Reservoir
* San Pablo Reservoir
* Upper San Leandro Reservoir

==History==
In 1923, EBMUD was founded due to the rapid population growth and severe drought in the area. The district constructed Pardee Dam (finished in 1929) on the Mokelumne River in the Sierra Nevada, and a large steel pipe Mokelumne Aqueduct to transport the water from Pardee Reservoir across the Central Valley to the San Pablo Reservoir located in the hills of the East Bay region. In subsequent years, EBMUD constructed two additional aqueducts to distribute water to several other East Bay reservoirs. From the various large regional reservoirs, water is transported to treatment plants and delivered to local reservoirs and tanks, thence distributed by gravity to customers.

In the 1980s with federal grant funding, EBMUD undertook a major facility expansion to accommodate wet weather waste water overflow (i.e. the vastly increased system demand in the rainy season). This project took many years of construction for implementation, after the planning and Environmental Impact Statement phases.

In 1994, the EBMUD board of directors approved the Seismic Improvement Plan (SIP), a $189 million capital project designed to minimize damage and disruption in the event of a potential earthquake along the Hayward Fault. One of EBMUD&#x27;s main water supply lines, the Claremont Tunnel, traverses the Hayward Fault, and the maximum credible earthquake along the fault could sever the tunnel, which was originally built in 1929. Some of the major projects included in SIP were the Southern Loop Pipeline, a new seismically-reinforced alternate route which would allow restoration of water service; and seismic upgrades to the Claremont Tunnel. The expected benefit of SIP was avoiding a potential $1.2 billion in lost revenue and damage resulting from a major earthquake.

In May 2008, EBMUD announced severe drought and austerity measures for its customers. With the easing of the drought, these measures were rescinded in 2010. EBMUD announced mandatory water rationing again in August 2014. The emergency regulations imposed during this prolonged drought were relaxed effective July 1, 2016, after the drought was declared officially ended. EBMUD announced mandatory water rationing again in April 2022, following a bleak California snow survey and the driest January to March period on record.

== Finances ==
As with other public entities, the District has significantly underfunded liabilities for legacy costs. These include $535 million for retirement and $89 million for retiree health.

EBMUD has several sources of revenue for both water and sewage treatment enterprises. These sources include the sale of water, hydroelectric power, system capacity charges, sewage treatment charges, connection fees, wet weather facilities charges, interest and property tax increments.

In 2007, the water system was anticipated to generate a total of $375.5 million in revenue. Water sales account for approximately 76 percent of the revenue, with System Capacity Charges generating an additional 7 percent in revenue. Property Tax Revenue is expected to generate an additional 5 percent of revenues, with interest, electric energy sales, reimbursements and other sources making up the remaining 12 percent of revenues.

== Water rights ==
Historically, 90 percent of the water used by EBMUD comes from the 577 square mile protected Mokelumne River watershed. EBMUD has water rights for up to 325 million U.S. gallons per day (MGD) (997 acre-feet) or a total of 364,000 acre-feet per year. In normal years, EBMUD reservoirs in the East Bay receive an additional 30,000 acre-feet of local water from runoff annually. In dry years, evaporation and other losses can total more than the local runoff. Runoff from the Mokelumne watershed is not sufficient to meet EBMUD customer needs in times of severe drought.

In February 2020, 75 project customers, including the East Bay Municipal Utility District, received permanent federal water contracts for the Central Valley Project.

==Effects of California drought==
In April 2015, EBMUD declared a Stage 4 critical drought and has set a community-wide goal to reduce water use by 20%. To reach this goal, EBMUD has adopted new water rules that affect all customers and must supplement normal water supplies with water from additional sources, like 33,250 acre-feet from the Central Valley Project. EBMUD has enforced strict water restrictions in order to ensure all conservation measures are being taken. By the end of 2015, EBMUD was projected to have in storage 320,000 to 330,000 acre-feet of water.

On May 10, 2016, EBMUD declared an end to the drought emergency, as their reservoirs had more water than average. The board voted to relax many of the water conservation rules and the 25% surcharge, effective July 1, 2016. It announced that Pardee Reservoir had reached 100 percent of its capacity in January 2017 and had begun releasing excess water into Camanche Reservoir.

==Future expansion==
EBMUD has begun considering the expansion of its own Pardee Reservoir as the main route to secure enough water for its projected 2040 requirements. This proposal would expand Pardee Reservoir by building a new dam on the river. Environmentalists claimed that this action would destroy a beautiful section of the river which is used by the public for fishing, swimming and kayaking. Environmental activists such as the coordinator of the Environmental Water Caucus criticized EBMUD for disregarding an opportunity to join the consortium interested considering expanding the Los Vaqueros Reservoir (built and operated by the Contra Costa Water District (CCWD)). EBMUD countered its critics by saying that at the time their officials believed the Los Vaqueros proposal was not sufficiently developed to be a reliable alternative for their future plans. CCWD officials pointed out that their expansion plans were much further developed than any of EBMUD&#x27;s alternatives.

In 2009, environmental activists groups sued to block approval of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Pardee Reservoir expansion proposal. Following a two-year trial, Sacramento Superior Court Judge Timothy Frawley agreed with the plaintiffs&#x27; objections and rejected the EIS in 2011. His ruling stated that EBMUD had not adequately addressed all the potential environmental harms of the project. Specifically, Judge Frawley said the document completely omitted discussing a less destructive alternative - working with CCWD on expanding Los Vaqueros reservoir. Moreover, it neglected to discuss the impacts of: (1) flooding two whitewater runs (Electra and Middle Bar); (2) destroying the historic Middle Bar Bridge and (3) inundating a stand of black willow trees that were important to the culture of the native Miwok people. After reviewing the ruling, EBMUD announced in December, 2011, that it had dropped plans for a new dam on the Mokelumne River, and would work with CCWD on expanding Los Vaqueros.

<text>The Dodge Dart is a line of passenger cars produced by Dodge from the 1959 to 1976 model years in North America, with production extended to later years in various other markets. 

The production Dodge Dart was introduced as a lower-priced full-size model in 1960 and 1961, but became a mid-size car for one model year for 1962, and was then reduced to a compact for two generations, from 1963 to 1976.

Chrysler had first used &#x27;Dart&#x27; name plates on two Italian styled show cars, in 1956 and 1957, before it became a Dodge model name. The Dart nameplate was resurrected for a Fiat-derived compact car that was introduced in 2012.

==History==

The Dart name originally appeared on a 1956 Chrysler show car, featuring a streamlined body designed by the Italian coachbuilder Carrozzeria Ghia, that was later modified and renamed the Dart Diablo. For 1957, Ghia built Chrysler a second, visually similar show car, the Chrysler Ghia Super Dart 400.

===First generation (1960–1961)===
====1960====
The first Dodge Darts were introduced for the 1960 model year. They were downsized large cars developed to replace Plymouths in the standard, low-priced car segment for the Dodge dealer network. Dodge dealers had been selling Plymouths since 1930, but divisional restructuring took the Plymouth brand away from the Dodge dealer network. Project planners proposed the name Dart, only to have Chrysler executives demand an expensive research program that produced the name Zipp. This was promptly rejected in favor of Dart.

With the cancellation of Chrysler&#x27;s upper level DeSoto brand, upper-level Dodge products were pushed upmarket, while using Plymouth products with more features for lower-level Dodge products.

The Dart sedans and coupes were based on the unibody Plymouth platform with a wheelbase, shorter than the standard-size Dodge line. However, the Dart station wagons used the same wheelbase as the upmarket Polara wagons. The Dart line was offered in three trim levels: the basic Seneca, mid-range Pioneer, and premium Phoenix. The new Dart came standard with a new engine, the slant-six. The (standard equipment on certain Phoenix and Pioneer body styles) and V8s were optional with two-barrel or four-barrel carburetors, and with single or dual exhaust. The Dodge V8 was added in 1961. Brakes were 11-inch drums.

Sales of the new Dart were greater than those of the full-size Dodge Matador and Dodge Polara, which also created an in-house competitor for Plymouth. Advertising from 1960 and 1961 compared the Dart to the &quot;C&quot; car (Chevrolet), the &quot;F&quot; car (Ford) and the &quot;P&quot; car (Plymouth). After the economic downturn of 1958–59, Dodge production for 1960 rebounded to 367,804 cars, the division&#x27;s highest total to date, and good for sixth place behind Chevrolet, Ford, Plymouth, Rambler, and Pontiac. Chrysler officials were somewhat less comforted at how 87% of Dodge&#x27;s volume consisted of the low-profit Dart line, compared to the upmarket Matador and Polara, of which only 41,000 were sold for the 1960 model year.

As the Dart&#x27;s sales climbed, Plymouth&#x27;s sales dropped. Chrysler executives did little to stop the infighting between the divisions. Dart sales were so strong in 1960 that production of the medium-priced model lines were reduced. The full-size, mid-priced Matador was discontinued after the 1960 model year as buyers selected the slightly smaller but better-appointed and less expensive Dart Phoenix. The premium Polara remained in the medium-price segment in 1961.

====1961====
For the 1961 model year, the Dart continued as the smallest full-size Dodge. It retained the wheelbase, and was restyled to emulate the larger Polara. The same three trim levels were available: the premium Phoenix, mid-range Pioneer, and base Seneca. Once again, wagons shared the Polara&#x27;s wheelbase; they also shared the Polara&#x27;s unique side-mounted taillights.

Engine choices included the slant-six, and the and V8s were also available in various configurations. Phoenix convertibles were equipped with V8 engines. Beginning mid-year, some Darts ordered with the 225 engine were equipped with the die-cast aluminum block. Darts in all series were equipped as standard with three-speed, column-shifted manual transmissions. Chrysler&#x27;s pushbutton-shifted TorqueFlite automatic was available at extra cost. The alternator, introduced as standard equipment in 1960 on the Valiant, replaced the previous DC generator on all 1961 Chrysler products. Canadian-built 1961 Darts were identical to U.S. models on the outside, but the interior trim, controls, and displays were those used on the U.S. Plymouth.

Virgil Exner&#x27;s 1961 styling with its reverse fins, rear fender scalloping (the taillights were widely referred to as &quot;ingrown toenails&quot;), and the concave grille was highly unpopular with consumers. The low position and small size of the Dart&#x27;s tail lights, just above the corners of the bumper, was also criticized and drivers of following cars complained that they could not see them. The wraparound taillights projected light sideward, not rearward. By mid-year, Dodge made auxiliary taillights available at extra cost through its dealer network. However, these large round lights were mounted near the inboard side of the reverse fins and aggravated the already awkward styling.

The 1961 automobile market was generally an off-year for automobile sales, and Dodge production went down to 269,367 units, of which 142,708 were Darts. Among all the Darts sold, almost half (66,100) were the Seneca line, down from 111,600 in 1960. Combined sales of Dart and Polara were lower than Plymouth&#x27;s sales for 1961. Dodge ranked ninth in sales in the American market in 1961, down from sixth place in 1960. Sales of the compact Dodge Lancer were 74,773 units compared to its Plymouth twin, the Valiant, which sold 143,078 units for the same year. The 1961 model year saw Dodge&#x27;s total production drop below the slow-selling 1959 model year and almost the disastrous recession year of 1958 when Dodge faced the consequences of the poor reputation of its 1957 models.


===Second generation (1962)===

For 1962, the Seneca, Pioneer, and Phoenix trim levels and names were dropped – instead trim levels became Dart, Dart 330, Dart 440, and Polara 500, offered in downsized two- and four-door hardtop, and convertible styles, that stood out by their raised, protruding grilles, encompassing what look like inner headlights, similar to the inner headlights in the protruding grille of a 1969 Ford Mustang.

The Dodge Polara 500 was dimensionally identical but not officially a Dart by dint of its different name, and it was not built nor sold in Canada. The Dart models were the same in Canada as in the U.S. except that the base model was badged &quot;Dart 220&quot;.

The Dart and Polara were downsized as part of Chrysler&#x27;s hasty effort to compete with what company leaders thought would be downsized large cars from Chevrolet. However, they had overheard talk not of the big Chevrolets, but of the compact Chevy II Nova. This was a basic front-engine compact to compete more directly than the Corvair with the Ford Falcon, Rambler American, and Plymouth Valiant. Chevrolet&#x27;s Impala and Ford&#x27;s Galaxie both remained sized in accord with the prevailing norms of full-size cars.

The redesigned Dart was perceived more as an intermediate, like the Rambler Classic or the Ford Fairlane. When Dodge dealers voiced their displeasure at having no true full-size car to offer, Chrysler quickly created the Dodge Custom 880 in January 1962 by putting the 1961 Dodge Polara front end assembly on a version of the 1962 Chrysler Newport body.

The 1962 Dart, like the Plymouth, was on a new lightweight unibody &quot;B&quot; platform, featuring Chrysler&#x27;s well-received &quot;Torsion-Aire&quot; torsion bar front suspension and asymmetric rear leaf springs. The rigidity gained through the nearly pure unibody platform combined with the suspension&#x27;s low unsprung weight and near-ideal geometry provided sound handling, braking, and acceleration; the latter especially with the mid-year &quot;Ramcharger&quot; V8 which was aimed primarily at sanctioned drag racing, where it quickly broke performance records.

In 1961, a third-generation turbine engine (CR2A) was installed in a 1962 Dart, which successfully drove from New York City to Los Angeles, through snowstorms, rain and heavy winds.

The Dart&#x27;s new B-body chassis platform was quite long-lived; while 1962 was the only year for a B-body model named &quot;Dart&quot;, the B platform remained in use with only very slight modification and a few new letter designations through to the 1981 R-body cars.

===Third generation (1963–1966)===
For 1963, Dodge made a last-minute decision to drop the Lancer name in favor of &quot;Dart&quot; for Dodge&#x27;s newly designed &quot;senior compact&quot;, a marketing term referring to the wheelbase having grown to from the Lancer&#x27;s . This longer wheelbase used the same A-body suspension of the Valiant and defunct Lancer, and would underpin all Darts from 1963 to 1976 except the 1963–1966 station wagons which used the Valiant&#x27;s ( wheelbase) and the 1971–1976 Demon/Sport which used the Plymouth Duster&#x27;s wheelbase. The longer wheelbase gave more rear seat legroom than the previous Lancer or the contemporaneous Valiant. The Dart was available as a 2- or 4-door sedan, a 2-door hardtop coupe, a station wagon, and a convertible. Three trim levels were offered: the low-spec &quot;170&quot;, the high-spec &quot;270&quot;, and the premium &quot;GT&quot;, which was available only as a 2-door hardtop or convertible. The 1963 Dart has a turning diameter of .

The Dart was an instant market success, with 1963 sales up sharply compared to those of the 1962 Lancer. The Dart remained extremely popular through the end of the Dart&#x27;s production run in 1976 in comparison to the Ford Falcon and the Chevrolet Nova.

Initial engine offerings were two sizes of the slant-six: a , version was fitted as standard equipment, and a , version was available for less than $50 extra. The aluminum engine block for the 225 was discontinued early in the 1963 model year. After the start of the 1964 model year, an all-new, compact, lightweight LA V8 producing with a 2-barrel carburetor was introduced as the top engine option. 1964 was the last year for pushbutton control of the optional Torqueflite automatic transmission, so 1963 and 1964 models were the only compact Darts so equipped. Standard axle ratios in 1964 were 2.93:1 with automatic transmission and 225 engine, or 3.23:1 with manual transmission and 225 engine, or with 170 engine and either transmission. A 3.55:1 ratio was optional. New features included stronger door locks and a refined automatic choke.

In 1965, the 2-barrel 273 remained available, but a new performance version of the 273 engine was released with a 4-barrel carburetor, 10.5:1 compression, a more aggressive camshaft with solid tappets, and other upgrades which increased output to . At the same time, the Dodge Dart Charger was offered. The Dart Chargers were yellow Dart GT hardtops with black interiors, Charger 273 engines, (Plymouth called their 4 barrel 273 Commando), premium mechanical and trim specifications, and special &quot;Charger&quot; badging. They were the first Dodge models to bear the &quot;Charger&quot; name. The following year the larger B-body Dodge Charger was introduced, and the &quot;Charger&quot; name was thenceforth associated with Dart models only in the &quot;Charger 225&quot; marketing name for the optional larger 6-cylinder engine.

Other new options for 1965 included upgraded suspension components and larger wheels and tires. Factory-installed air conditioning became available after the start of the 1965 model year, as well as disc brakes, which required the wheels to clear the calipers. Front seat belts became standard.


===Fourth generation (1967–1976)===
====Engines====
The Slant-6 engine remained standard equipment, though its power rating rose from to for 1967, owing to the installation of the 225 engine&#x27;s 1 barrel Carter BBD or Holley 1904 series carburetor and the revised camshaft the bigger engine had received in 1965. For North American domestic-market vehicles, the base 170 engine was replaced for 1970 with a stronger new version of the slant-6. This new base engine was also less costly to make, for unlike the previous 170 engine, the 198 used the same block as the 225. The smaller displacement was achieved with a new crankshaft ( stroke vs. the stroke of the 225 crank) and connecting rods ( long vs. the rods in the 225). Nevertheless, the 225 remained an upgrade option. The 2-barrel small-block V8 was supplanted on the option list in 1968 by a 2-barrel engine. The 318 was rated at versus the 2-barrel carbureted 273&#x27;s . At the same time the 4-barrel carbureted 273 was replaced on the options list by the 4-barrel carbureted available only in the 1968–1972 Swinger and the hottest Dart, the performance-oriented GTS models. The Dart GTS came standard with the V8. A big-block was optional.

=== 1967 ===
The Dart and its sister model—the Plymouth Valiant—were substantially redesigned for the 1967 model year. In addition to new styling, the cars received revised steering systems, wider front track and frame rail spacing, and redesigned K-members capable of accepting larger engines. The Dart kept this basic form, with facelifts consisting of revised front and rear-end styling and interior trim, until the end of A-body production in 1976 for North America and 1981 for South America.

The restyled Dart for 1967 featured a rear window with compound inverse curves. This created a unique appearance at the rear of the greenhouse, but tended to collect snow and created thick C-pillars that looked formal but created blind spots for drivers. Curved side glass was used for the first time on a Chrysler compact. The front featured a new dual-plane front end contour: the center section of the grille, bumper, and leading edge of the hood were recessed from the front plane of the car. The single headlamps were placed forward of the recessed center section, defining the front plane. Park/turn lamps were set into the grille, in the corners formed by the transition area between the recessed and forward sections.

With the new design, changes were made to the Dart lineup, beginning with the elimination of its station wagons and the base model&#x27;s &quot;170&quot; designation. The only body styles were the 2- and 4-door sedans, the hardtop, and the convertible. The base 170 model was now badged simply as &quot;Dart&quot;. The 270 and GT versions carried on unchanged for the most part. In late 1967, the GTS model debuted but was built in limited quantities due to its lateness in the model year; the 1968 GTS was, arguably, improved by fitting the new high-output V8 as standard equipment.

The 1967 Dart, along with all other 1967 Chrysler products, got a new dual-circuit brake hydraulic system to ensure a loss of pressure in the front brakes would not prevent the rear brakes from working, and vice versa. The system also incorporated a brake system fault telltale on the dashboard. Other changes to comply with new federal safety laws included collapsible steering columns, additional padding on the dashboard and sun visors. Shoulder belt anchors were also provided for front outboard occupants.

The 1967 redesign removed all traces of the older Virgil Exner styling that proved less popular by the early 1960s. The newer body was trimmer and proved extremely popular, causing sales of the Dart to surpass compacts from Ford and GM.

====1968====

Changes for 1968 were relatively subtle. The park and turn lights in the grille were moved slightly inboard and made round. Side marker lights were added to the front fenders and rear quarter panels, to comply with newly introduced Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108. Shoulder harnesses (separate, this year and until 1973, from the lap belts) and non-glare matte finish on the windshield wiper arms were also part of the 1968 federally mandated safety package. Chrysler&#x27;s &quot;clean air package&quot; emission control system became standard equipment on cars sold in all 50 states. The steering linkage was revised again, as were the windshield and rear window gaskets and trim-lock strips, leaving the 1967 pieces as one-year-only items. The standard rear axle ratio was dropped from 2.93 to 2.76 with all standard-performance engines and automatic transmission. Part-throttle downshift functionality was added as a refinement to the TorqueFlite automatic transmission in 6-cylinder cars, to retain acceptable city performance with the taller rear axle ratio.

=====Hemi Dart=====
A limited option for 1968 only, code L023, the Hurst-reworked Hemi Darts used the Hemi engine. These special models (only 80 were made) were created strictly for drag racing, and included a non-warranty disclaimer. On February 20, 1968, corporate headquarters in Highland Park, Michigan, sent out a press release to Dodge dealerships. It was a promotional pitch purposed at selling drag-ready, Hemi-powered Darts. The press release stated that Dodge wanted to make a factory-built and ready drag racer out of the 68 Dart GTS hardtop for competition in class B Super Stock (drag racing). Engineers stated the new Hemi Dart reached speeds of in less than 11 seconds and  times in the 10-11 second range, although times have been reported as low as the 9-10 second range.

To keep weight low, a fiberglass hood and fenders were used. The hood featured a functional intake scoop and four hood pins for full lift-off removal of the hood. Lightweight acid-dipped steel doors with thin side window glass were used. As the doors lacked a window mechanism, a strap was attached to the bottom of the glass on the interior door panel. To keep glass up, the strap latched to the inside of the door. The interior included only two bucket seats from a Dodge van. The center console, heater, sound deadeners, side-view mirrors, radio, carpeting, and even armrests were omitted to save weight.

The engine was a race-spec 426 Hemi. These motors had a compression ratio of 10.25:1 pistons, bore x stroke fed through a 2X4-barrel Holley carburetors atop a lightweight crossram aluminum intake manifold rated at at 5,000 rpm and a maximum torque of at 4,000 rpm. A high-performance Mopar battery was moved to the trunk to free up room and improve weight distribution.

Darts could be ordered with either a four-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmissions. Manual transmission equipped cars, code A-833, featured a Dana 60 built heavy-duty axle with a 4.88 gear ratio, heavy-duty clutch, steel bellhousing, and special torque shaft and pivots. Manual transmissions were modified by removing synchronizers which lowered the chances of missed shifts. A Hurst floor-mounted shifter came standard.

The automatic transmissions were the then-new Chrysler-built 727 TorqueFlite three-speed with 8-3/4 inch large stem pinion center section with a 4.86 gear set, and a 2,600 rpm high speed torque converter. They were also modified with a floor-mounted Hurst shifter for manual shifting.

Other features include heavy-duty rear shocks, heavy-duty radiator with a seven-blade fan, and deep groove pulleys, a high capacity oil pump, solid-lifter cam, and a roller timing chain to reduce stretch and provide more reliable performance. A transistorized dual points breaker distributor coupled with a Prestolite ignition and solid core wires were also used.

The cars weighed approximately . The cars were designed to meet street legal requirements, but due to the modifications, the cars came with disclaimers that they were not for street use, but rather &quot;supervised acceleration trials&quot;, or drag racing.

====1969====

The 2-door sedan was dropped at the end of 1968 and replaced with the Swinger 2-door hardtop for 1969 available in Custom, GT, and GTS trim. Also added was the Swinger 340.

The entire 1969 Dart range received trim updates including another minor revision of the grille and a return to rectangular park/turn lights. The 1968 round side marker lights were replaced with rectangular reflectors. Head restraints were optional equipment until January 1, 1969, when their installation became mandatory under federal law. The 6-cylinder models received a carburetor anti-ice system borrowed from Canadian-market Chrysler 6-cylinder engines, and the drum brake automatic adjusters were revised for more consistent operation. At the top of the Dart performance range for 1969, there was limited availability of the 440 V8 in the Dart GTS model.

====1970====
The Dart was refreshed for 1970 with front and rear changes designed to bring the car closer to the design themes found in Dodge&#x27;s full-size vehicles through grille and contour changes. In the rear, the Dart&#x27;s new rectangular tail lights were set into a wedge-shaped rear bumper design continuing the angled trailing edge of the new deck lid and quarter panels. The revised rear styling did not change the 14.1 cubic ft trunk space of the 1969 model. 14-inch wheels became standard equipment, and the slant-6 was replaced by a larger version for improved base-model performance and greater manufacturing economy—the 198 used the same block as the 225, while the 170 had used a different block. Changes to the fuel system improved drivability, economy, and emission control. Part-throttle downshift was added to the 8-cylinder automatic transmissions. In compliance with FMVSS 108, side marker lights and reflectors were installed at all four corners. 1970 Darts for the US and Canadian markets were built in Canada at the Windsor, Ontario, or Los Angeles, California assembly plant. All 1970 Darts got the federally mandated steering column and ignition lock.

The &quot;Swinger&quot; name was applied to all the Dart two-door hardtops except in the high-line custom series. Other changes were made to the Dart line to avoid internal competition with Dodge&#x27;s new Challenger: the Dart convertible was discontinued along with the optional V8, leaving the 340 4-barrel V8 as the top Dart engine.

The performance model in the Dart line for 1970 was the Swinger 340 2-door hardtop. The 1970 Swinger 340 came with functional hood scoops with 340 emblems. Standard equipment included front disc brakes (only on the Swinger), heavy-duty &quot;Rallye&quot; suspension, a 3.23:1 rear axle ratio, fiberglass-belted bias-ply tires mounted to 14 × 5½ inch steel wheels, and a bumblebee stripe. Optional equipment included an upgrade over the standard bench seat with all-vinyl bucket seats, with which a center console could be ordered. A performance hood upgrade with scoops was painted flat black with hood tie-down pins. Mechanical options included power-assisted brakes and steering. Rallye wheels and wire wheel covers were also optional, as was a 6000 rpm tachometer and a vinyl roof covering in black or white.

====1971====
For 1971, Chrysler introduced a 2-door hardtop in the Valiant line called the Scamp. It was the same car as the Swinger with a Valiant front clip. The 1970 Dart&#x27;s dual tail lamps were given over to the badge-engineered Scamp, while the 1971 Dart received new smaller quad taillamps that would be used through 1973. The custom 2-door hardtop coupe became the Swinger, and the standard Swinger became the Swinger Special. Dodge gained a version of Plymouth&#x27;s popular Valiant-based fastback Duster which was to be named the &quot;Beaver&quot;, but when Chrysler&#x27;s marketing department learned that &quot;beaver&quot; was CB slang for vagina, the vehicle was renamed the &quot;Dart Demon&quot;.

As was the case with previous Dodge rebadges of Plymouth Valiants, such as the 1961–1962 Lancer, sales of the Demon lagged behind those of the Duster. With optional hood scoops and blackout hood treatment, the car was advertised as a performance car. The Demon&#x27;s Dart-type front fender wheel lips and Duster-type rear wheel fender lips reveal the car was essentially a Duster with Dart front sheet metal and other minor styling changes. A new audio option became available for 1971: Chrysler&#x27;s cassette-recorder. Unlike the 8-track tapes, the cassette player was relatively compact, and it was mounted on the console or on its own floor-mount casing. This unit offered an available microphone in which one could record their own dictation.

The Swinger 340, Dart&#x27;s performance model, was replaced by the Demon 340, 275 HP engine with an optional 4-speed manual transmission, optional hood scoops, and blackout hood treatment. In 1971, Chrysler ended their longstanding corporate practice of installing left-hand-threaded wheel studs on the left side of the vehicle; all-wheel studs on the Dart thenceforth used conventional right-hand threads.

====1972====
Changes for 1972 included a revised grille without the central divider of the 1970 and 1971 items, new surface-mounted sidemarker lights rather than the previous flush-mount units, the instrument cluster was now shared with the Valiant and featured a large, rectangular speedometer and several, small, round gauges; the AM/FM-radio option returned. The Demon had new fender-mounted metal &quot;Demon&quot; badges without the small devil character on the 1971 decals. The &quot;Demon&quot; decal on the rear of the car was replaced by &quot;Dodge&quot; and &quot;Dart&quot; emblems on the lower right edge of the deck lid. Some Demons with the side and rear panel tape stripes retained the tape devil character. A new, optional, single, hood scoop replaced 1971&#x27;s dual scoops, and was coupled with a hood-paint blackout that had been standard on the 1971 high-trim/high-value Demon Sizzler model. Cars equipped with the optional rally wheels now came with newly restyled center caps, finished in a light-argent (silver) paint. Demon production was substantially less than Duster&#x27;s; this is reflected in higher collector car values for the Demon, especially V8 models.
====1973====
The 1973 model year Darts received new front styling with revised fenders, grille, header panel, and hood. Impact absorbing front bumpers were installed to comply with new federal regulations, as well as side-impact guard beams in the doors and new emission control devices. New single-piston disc brakes replaced the more complex 4-piston units offered from 1965 to 1972.

Chrysler&#x27;s new electronic ignition system was standard equipment on all engines, and starter motors were revised for faster engine cranking. The K-frame was modified to accommodate a new spool-type engine mount that limited engine roll to 3°. The upper ball joints were upgraded to the larger B-body units. Along with these chassis changes, the wheel bolt pattern on Darts with disc brakes was enlarged from to the pattern common to the larger B- and C-body Chrysler-built passenger cars. Darts with 4-wheel drum brakes continued with the smaller bolt pattern. The standard rear axle was still the 7¼-inch unit, but the heavy-duty option was now an 8¼-inch item rather than the previous 8¾-inch rear axle. Standard rear axle ratios were 2.76:1 with automatic transmission and 3.23:1 with manual, though other ratios were available. Vent wings were deleted from the Swinger but not from the 4-door sedans. A new &quot;Quiet Car&quot; package was available, consisting of extra sound insulation, premium exhaust hangers, and an exhaust resonator.

The Demon fastback was renamed &quot;Dart Sport&quot; in response to poor sales. It was thought that the &quot;Demon&quot; name and devil-with-pitchfork logo negatively affected sales to people of faith. 
The high-performance model thus became Dart Sport 340, and 1973 saw styling changes to go along with the name change. The Dart Sport received the same new front end as the other Darts, and its taillights were changed to two lights per side, each with a chrome trim ring. These would remain unchanged through the 1976 model year.

====1974====

In 1974, the US federal bumper impact standards were expanded to cover rear bumpers as well as front ones, and as a result, the Swinger and Dart sedan&#x27;s rear bumpers grew much more massive. Taillights larger than the previous year&#x27;s items were set above the rear bumper, rather than within it. Shoulder and lap belts were finally combined in all Chrysler products into a retractable, inertia-sensitive, single-buckle design Chrysler called &quot;Unibelt&quot;, replacing the difficult-to-use separate lap and shoulder belts that had been installed through 1973.

The Arab oil embargo of 1973, increased sales of smaller cars in the U.S. Dodge introduced the Dart SE (special edition) in mid-1974 as a four-door sedan and two-door hardtop. The SE included velour high back bucket seats with folding armrest, carpeted door panels, woodgrain instrument panel, and deluxe wheel covers along with a TorqueFlite automatic transmission as standard equipment. The SE came equipped with the &quot;quiet car&quot; package introduced in 1973. The air conditioning system available on all Darts had increased capacity, quicker cooldown and lower minimum temperatures. An evaporator pressure regulator valve, long used on larger Chrysler products, varied the compressor&#x27;s capacity without cycling the clutch.

The Dart Sport 340 was replaced by the Dart Sport 360 245 Bhp. as the V8 engine replaced the engine discontinued after 1973.

====1975====

The 1975 models were virtually identical to the 1974s, except for a new grille and that California and some high-altitude models were equipped with catalytic converters and so required unleaded gasoline. All 1975 models were required to pass a roof crush test and to meet this stringent requirement, additional reinforcements were added to all Dart 2-door hardtops. Heavy gauge steel in the windshield pillar area had been incorporated into the windshield, pillar, and roof design. Darts were also equipped with an improved energy-absorbing steering column which used multiple slots in the column jacket to replace prior used convoluted mesh design. At impact, force applied to the steering wheel curled the column jacket back over a mandrel mounted on the floor. Federal Motor Safety Standards briefly required that the front seat belts include a starter interlock system that prevented the engine from starting unless the front seat outboard occupant and the driver fastened their belts.

The 198 slant-six engine was discontinued and the 225 became standard equipment on all models. As in 1974, the 360 V8 was limited to the Dart Sport 360 model. A 4-speed manual transmission was offered with the 6-cylinder engine for the first time in the North American market since 1965 and with a new 30% overdrive 4th gear ratio. It was Chrysler&#x27;s first application of overdrive since 1959. The final drive ratio in fourth gear was 2.36:1 on the slant-six cars equipped with 3.23:1 rear axle, and 2.15:1 on the V8s equipped with 2.94:1 rear axle. The result was less engine noise and wear and greater fuel economy.

Also for 1975, heaters had 14% more heating capacity than in the previous year&#x27;s models. The added capacity was the result of adding a third speed to the blower system, which provided 20% greater airflow at maximum setting. The electrically heated backglass defogger grid timer cycle was doubled to 10 minutes. Additionally, sound insulation was improved.

====1976====

1976 was the Dart&#x27;s final year in the North-American market. The rear-view mirror was mounted on the windshield rather than from the roof. Front disc brakes became standard equipment on 1 January 1976 in accord with more stringent U.S. federal brake-performance requirements, a new 2-spoke steering wheel debuted and a new foot-operated parking brake replaced the under-dash T-handle used since the Dart&#x27;s 1963 introduction as a compact car. The grille&#x27;s parking lamps were cast in amber, whereas the previous years had clear lenses with amber-colored bulbs.

The Dart Sport 360 was dropped as a separate model in 1976, but the four-barrel, dual exhaust (without catalytic converters) V8 was a $376 option (except in California) for the $3,370 Dart Sport V8 models with automatic transmission. &quot;Car &amp; Driver&quot; magazine tested the Dart Sport 360 in the April 1976 issue, pitting it against the Chevrolet Corvette and Pontiac Trans Am, and found its top speed of to be second to the Corvette&#x27;s .

Dart Custom 4-Door Sedan was dropped as the mid-level 4-door sedan model, but the features and trim were carried over as option package A68. Sedans equipped with the Custom package received the same &quot;Custom&quot; front fender badges as were applied to the standalone 1975 models of the same name. Elimination of the Custom series narrowed Dart&#x27;s 4-Door Sedan offerings in Dart&#x27;s final year to two models, Dart and Dart Special Edition.

=====A38 Police Package=====
In 1976, the Dart was offered with a police package, with production code A38. The A38 Dart had high-specification components and systems throughout, including a heavy-duty suspension with a rear sway bar, stronger leaf springs and firmer shock absorbers, larger brakes with semi-metallic front disc pads, maximum engine cooling as well as a high-capacity alternator and battery. The engines were Chrysler&#x27;s 225 slant-six, 318 V8, and LA V8 (220 H.P., with non-catalyst in 49-state models and a true dual exhaust; California models had a single exhaust with the catalytic converter) with an A727 TorqueFlite transmission. Police-specific equipment such as a calibrated speedometer (&quot;certified&quot; 120 mph), high-intensity dome light and wiring harness for a rooftop light bar were standard equipment with an A-pillar spotlight and push bars were optional. Production volume was low, with most A38 Darts going to the Los Angeles and Ventura police departments in Southern California. For the most part, police agencies preferred the larger intermediate Dodge Coronet or full-size Dodge Monaco.

A37 Taxi Package
A Taxi Package was also offered in Dart&#x27;s final year of production. Standard equipment included roof-light wiring, structural reinforcements in the body frame members, heavy-duty shocks and alternator and maximum capacity radiator. Engine options were the 225 slant-six or 318 V8. The Taxi package also included numerous interior upgrades including high-grade black vinyl, heavy duty floor mats, and heavy duty springs in front and rear seat cushions and seat backs. At extra cost, fleet buyers could specify a broader range of colors than those offered to retail buyers from the Production and Fleet Paint Selector, including Taxi Yellow, color code Y7.

====Dart Sport packages====
=====Convertriple and Hang 10=====
For 1973 and 1974, the Convertriple option on the Dart Sport included a fold-down rear seat/security panel offering of lengthwise space, and a manually operated metal sunroof. It was advertised as &quot;three cars in one&quot;: an economy compact, a convertible alternative because of the sunroof, and a roomy station wagon alternative because of the fold down rear seat.

The Convertriple was the basis for the 1975 Hang 10 option. It was aimed at surfers in an attempt by Dodge marketers to better determine consumer preferences in a declining performance market. Hang ten is a surfing expression for balancing at the end of a surfboard with ten toes over the nose of the board while riding the wave. Available only in eggshell white exterior with a factory-installed sunroof, the car&#x27;s fold-down rear seat permitted the loading of a surfboard through the trunk. The Hang 10 option continued the surfing theme with various colored stripe material accenting the white vinyl seats and door panels. Orange shag carpet covered the back of the fold-down rear seat while the dash and center console had orange accents. Red and blue exterior stripes started at the quarter panels with a wave-riding surfer graphic. A surfboard design ran down the center of the hood. Between the taillights, the stripe pattern fattened into surfboard-shaped letters that spelled out &quot;Hang 10.&quot;

=====Caravan Tan=====
In mid-1974, Dodge introduced the Caravan Tan trim package. Features for this Dart Sport included a desert-hued vinyl bench seat with multi-colored striped inserts and white piping, and gold-colored instrument panel, dashboard, and carpeting. Exterior color choices were dark moonstone, Sienna, gold metallic, dark gold metallic, golden fawn, and white.

=====Spirit of &#x27;76=====
In a tie-in with the United States Bicentennial, a Spirit of &#x27;76 edition of the Dart Sport featured white paint with prominent red and blue bodyside striping meant to evoke the image of the American flag.

=====Dart Lite=====
In response to increased interest in fuel economy, Dodge offered the Dart Lite fuel economy package which weighed at least less than the ordinary Dart Sport. The 225 slant-six was the only available engine, equipped with an aluminum intake manifold for the first time since 1960 and a specially calibrated carburetor and distributor. Bumper reinforcement brackets were aluminum instead of steel, while the hood and trunk lid bracing and inner panels were also aluminum. The slant-six engine block had already been modified for reduced weight in 1975; in the middle of 1976 production, its crankshaft was changed from forged steel to lighter cast iron. The high-flow exhaust system included a dual-biscuit catalytic converter, a larger 2¼&quot; headpipe, and the muffler used on V8 models. The Dart Lite was equipped with a 2.94:1 rear axle rather than the customary 3.21:1 ratio when the car was ordered with a three- or four-speed manual transmission. The A833OD Overdrive 4-speed manual transmission housing was made of aluminum and had a .73:1 final drive ratio which allowed cruising at highway speeds with minimum engine revolutions. Like all other Darts, the Dart Lites with automatic transmission came with a 2.76:1 rear axle as standard equipment. The Dart Lite with manual transmission was rated by the EPA at 36 mpg (6.5 L/100km) in highway driving. The Plymouth version was the Feather Duster.

== Taxi ==
Darts were offered to the taxicab industry for their whole production run from 1963 to 1976. While specifications varied by year, interior upgrades generally included heavy-duty front and rear black rubber floor mats, heavy-duty seat cushion springs with full-foam back and air-foam seats, black all-vinyl trim with heavy canvas-backed vinyl seat covers, interior door pull assist straps or handles, and a door-ajar warning light for the driver. Mechanically, Dart taxicabs were generally equipped with heavy-duty brakes, tires, shock absorbers, front torsion bars and rear leaf springs, a high-output alternator, an increased-capacity cooling system, and extra-lean carburetor calibration for greater economy. In 1976, the Chrome Yellow taxi package was available only with a 225 slant-six engine producing and ; transmission was the (rare) A-727-RG (raised-deck motor, which was the slant-six series) with California emissions, and . Options included a radio suppression package and a Fuel Pacer System. Many—if not all—of them had a body-color paint sales code of &quot;999&quot;, meaning special order paint.

==Racing and competition==
===D-Dart===
Dodge offered a performance version of the Dart GT in 1966. Known as the D-Dart for competitive use in NHRA&#x27;s D/stock class, the 273 V8 was modified to produce . Most of the power came from a larger carburetor and a more radical camshaft. The bulletin sent to the dealers from Chrysler also mentions an rear axle with 4.89:1 final drive ratio.

===SCCA competition===
In 1966, the SCCA introduced the new Trans-American Sedan Championship that allowed competition among Dodge Darts, Plymouth Barracudas, Chevrolet Corvairs, Ford Mustangs, and other &quot;production touring cars&quot; with a maximum wheelbase of . The cars competed in two classes, over 2 liters and under 2 liters. Few modifications were allowed; bumpers, rear seats, and floor mats could be removed, mufflers could be replaced with straight pipes, and different wheels could be used so long as the stock rim diameter and width were maintained.&lt;ref name=&quot;66T/A&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Any engine component available over the dealer parts counter was sanctioned for use. Bob Tullius&#x27; race team, called &quot;Group 44,&quot; used Dart 270 model coupes and GT coupes with 273-4bbl engines and were sponsored by Quaker State. The team won the 24-hour endurance race at Marlboro Motor Raceway in car No.4 driven by Tullius and Tony Adamowicz, who would also go on to win at Riverside International Raceway. Dodge pulled sponsorship of the Darts after one season.

===Super stock===
Although racers like Dick Landy and Don Garlits had modified Darts in the mid-1960s to run in the National Hot Rod Association - NHRA funny car class using the 426 Hemi, super stock class racing of the Dart was almost non-existent due to the small V-8s available. In 1968, Dodge contracted Hurst Performance to build a limited number of Darts powered by the RB big-block and Hemi-powered Darts to compete in the SS/B class as the LO23 &quot;Hurst Hemi Dart&quot;. According to Chrysler staff engineer Larry Shepard, the majority of these Darts were Hemi powered, although a small pilot run of fifty 440-powered Darts were also built in 1968. &quot;In 1969,&quot; said Shepard, &quot;we built over 600 440-powered Darts-basically the same as the 383 GTS, except for the engine.&quot;

==Foreign markets==
Right-hand drive 1960, 1961, and 1962 Darts were exported to Commonwealth countries such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Singapore. In Australia they were badged as the Dodge Phoenix. In South Africa, a DeSoto-branded version of the car called the Diplomat was sold from 1960 to 1962, as well. Once the &quot;Dart&quot; name was moved to Dodge&#x27;s compact car for 1963, the Phoenix was no longer Dart-related; each year thereafter through 1971, the &quot;Phoenix&quot; name was applied to the RHD version of a Dodge or Plymouth B-body or C-body for Commonwealth export.

Chrysler Australia used the 1967 Dart front end in the Australian-built VE Valiant. The two-door coupe versions of the subsequent VF and VG models used the Dart two-door&#x27;s body from the A-pillar back married to an Australian front end. Australian sedan and pickup truck models were also exported in knock-down kit form to New Zealand for local assembly there from 1963 to 1978.

Dodge Darts were assembled in right-hand drive in South Africa during the 1960s and up until 1972 and sold locally as the Chrysler Valiant. All South African models were built with a locally sourced 225 cu in six-cylinder engine. U.S. Plymouth/Dodge models were fully replaced by Australian Chrysler products from 1972. 
===South America===

The Dodge Dart started being produced in Brazil from knock-down kits in October 1969, replacing the Simca-derived Chrysler Esplanada.

Production of A-body Darts continued in Brazil, where they were also sold as Charger, Magnum and Le Baron, through 1981 and in Colombia through 1977. Dart-based A-body cars with various names including Valiant, Coronado and Polara were produced in Argentina through 1979. The Brazilian A-body cars used the bodystyle from 1970 and were always equipped with the 318 cubic inch V8, set up to run on the lower-octane fuel used in Latin America at the time. Originally a three-speed manual transmission was standard, with an optional Torqueflite automatic transmission, and later a four-speed manual was also available. The equipment levels in Brazil were: Sedan de Luxo, Coupe de Luxo, SE, Gran Sedan, Gran Coupe, Charget LS, Le Baron and Magnum with the sporty Charger R/T .

The last true A-body Dart was built in the summer of 1981 in Brazil. This car is virtually identical to the U.S. market&#x27;s 1976 Swinger.

=== Spain ===

From 1965 to 1970 a Spanish version of the Dodge Dart based on the original from the United States was manufactured in the Barreiros Villaverde factory in Madrid. In 1969, the Barreiros-made Dart was facelifted with a different front fascia; using the same headlights from Dodge C-38 trucks. 

In March 1971 a new version, using the same 111 in (2,819 mm) wheelbase but with different sheet metal, the Dodge 3700 was produced until 1977 when the Spanish automotive taxation system was changed. The 3700 actually received the sheet metal from the Argentinian Dodge Polara, with certain modifications for the Spanish market. The rear wheel openings were larger and round, the grille and all lights were different, as was the instrumentation. The 3700 also came as standard with front disc brakes and power steering. A total of 17,589 units were manufactured of the earlier range (1965 to 1970) in Spain, they were produced as a SKD due to the protectionist Spanish regulations of those years. 9,959 Dodge 3700s were built until 1977, although the last new 3700 was only first registered in 1980.
The Dart and the 3700 were the biggest national production car available in Spain during all production years. It was an expensive luxury car with very low fuel economy by Spanish standards. Nonetheless, it was considered an economic car for its size in those few markets to which it was exported. In Switzerland, for instance, it was priced exactly the same as a V8-engined American-built four-door Dodge Dart Custom and had only slightly less power, but was taxed considerably less. These vehicles were also exported to other European markets such as France and the United Kingdom but without much success. The Spanish Dodges never met sales goals and was an expensive failure for the Barreiros concern. The break-even point was 5,000 cars per year, a goal which was only surpassed once, in 1966. The Barreiros brothers were forced to sell off the company which was reorganized as Chrysler España, S.A.
The Dodge Dart GL was a luxury model, while the GT was the sporty version. The base version has a three-speed manual transmission, while the GT came with either a four-speed manual or a three-speed automatic - this was the same unit as the one mounted in the Chrysler 2 L.

The gasoline Darts had the biggest engine ever mounted into a mass-produced car in Spain, the Chrysler slant-six engine. The &quot;3700&quot; number is a reference to the 3.7 litres of displacement. No other six-cylinder engine car has been produced as much in Spain.

A diesel Dart (named &quot;Barreiros diesel&quot;) was also produced. These models, mainly intended for taxi use, were very basic and very slow. They have 7-inch round headlamps rather than the large oblong units on fancier Spanish Darts, and use the round taillights from the first generation Simca 1000. The engine was the Barreiros C65, a inline-four with at 4,500 rpm. Top speed was claimed to be .
There was also a station wagon version, as well as variants (diplomatic motorcade cars, ambulances, hearses, etc.)

Production of Spanish Dodges stopped in 1977. Peugeot bought the Villaverde factory, as Chrysler was divesting their European operations in Spain, France, and the United Kingdom.

Spanish Dodges were popular with members of the Spanish government during the 1960s and 1970s. Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco was killed on 20 December 1973 while traveling in his Dodge 3700 GT. On 12 June 1975, Fernando Herrero Tejedor, the Minister Secretary General of the Movimiento Nacional and the politician mentoring Adolfo Suárez, died in a car accident while travelling in his official Dodge 3700 in the municipality of Adanero. Peugeot would not market another large car in Spain similar to the size of the Dart (the previous Chrysler 180 was smaller) until the Talbot Tagora came out in 1980, albeit without much success.

Although being the only large Dodge produced locally in Spain, previous American models such as the Coronet and Meadowbrook were exported to Spain ever since the 1950s with moderate success.

===Mexico===

The Dart name (rather than Aspen) was applied to Dodge-branded F-body cars in Mexico, corresponding to the Mexican Chrysler-branded F-body cars badged as Valiant Volare (without the &quot;é&quot; in the &quot;Volare&quot; nameplate). The F-body was withdrawn from production worldwide after 1980, but in Mexico, the M-body was badged as a Dodge Dart for 1981 and 1982 using the front header panel from the discontinued 1980 Volare/Aspen, the K-body was sold as a Dodge Dart K (and as a Valiant Volare K) from 1982 to 1989, and the E-body was sold as the Dodge Dart Europa, officially badged as the Dodge Dart E, from 1986 to 1989. It was a downscale (lower price, cheaper trim) version of the American Dodge 600 4-door sedan. It replaced the Dart K 4-door sedan. Dart K 2-door and wagon models were sold alongside the Dart E until 1988 and the old SOHC I-4 2.2 L engine was replaced by the new 2.5 L I-4 for the 1987 season. These were the last new cars in the world to bear the Dodge Dart name until its revival in 2013. The Dart name was dropped when Chrysler de México introduced the Spirit in 1990.

== Epilogue ==
The Dodge Dart was sold alongside its replacement for part of the 1976 model year before it was discontinued in the U.S. and Canadian markets. Over its original 13-year production run, the Dart earned a good reputation. &quot;The Dart was one of the most successful compact cars ever introduced in the American automobile marketplace,&quot; according to R. D. McLaughlin, then vice president of Chrysler&#x27;s Automotive sales division, &quot;It enjoys a strong owner loyalty and is a car that has established a reputation for reliability and value... these are [some] reasons why we will continue to market the Dart while introducing the new compact Aspen.&quot;

The A-body Dart was replaced by the F-body Dodge Aspen in late spring of 1976, alongside the somewhat larger M-body Dodge Diplomat (which was seen as a high end mid-size car or even a low end full-size car that was positioned between the Aspen and St. Regis). Nevertheless, as these cars were considerably too large for the compact car market, that segment would be occupied by the Omni for Dodge to compete in a rapidly changing automobile market. The Aspen was replaced in 1980 by the Dodge Aries and the Dodge 400 in 1982. These models would then be succeeded by the Dodge Spirit and later by the Stratus and Avenger sedans. The Diplomat would be produced until 1989 when it was replaced by the full-size Monaco and then the Intrepid. The Intrepid was then replaced by the Dodge Charger sedan. After 35 years, the Dodge Dart (PF) was resurrected for the 2013 model year as a nameplate in the domestic market to replace the Caliber as Dodge&#x27;s compact passenger car.

<text>Jameer Lamar Nelson Sr. (born February 9, 1982) is an American former professional basketball player who serves as general manager for the Delaware Blue Coats of the NBA G League. He played college basketball for the Saint Joseph&#x27;s Hawks, where he was named national college player of the year in 2004. Drafted 20th overall in the 2004 NBA draft, Nelson spent the first ten years of his NBA career with the Orlando Magic. In 2009, he was named an All-Star and made an appearance in the NBA Finals with the Magic. He has also played for the Dallas Mavericks, Boston Celtics, Denver Nuggets, New Orleans Pelicans and Detroit Pistons.

==High school career==
Nelson attended Chester High School in Chester, Pennsylvania and was a letterman in basketball. In 2000, he helped lead his team to the PIAA AAAA State championship.

==College career==
Nelson began his play at Saint Joseph&#x27;s University in the 2000–01 season. He had a breakout freshman season in which he was named unanimous National Freshman of the Year. During his junior season in 2002–03, he averaged 19.7 points per game, 5.1 rebounds per game, and 4.7 assists per game. He declared for the 2003 NBA draft, but later decided to remain for his senior season.

Nelson led the Saint Joseph&#x27;s Hawks to a 27–0 regular season record in 2003–04. The Hawks&#x27; first loss came in the Atlantic 10 tournament to Xavier. Nelson and junior guard Delonte West formed what was largely considered the nation&#x27;s best backcourt, helping the Hawks earn a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament. They advanced to the Elite Eight and were within seconds of the Final Four before Oklahoma State Cowboys&#x27; John Lucas III hit a three-pointer with only a few seconds remaining (after the make, Nelson dribbled up the court and had a chance to tie the game, but his 15-foot shot fell short). Saint Joseph&#x27;s finished with a 30–2 record, the best in the university&#x27;s history. Nelson averaged 20.6 points, 5.3 assists, and 2.9 steals per game. He received the Lowe&#x27;s Senior CLASS Award his final year, recognizing him as the nation&#x27;s top senior men&#x27;s basketball player. He left the Hawks as the best player in the program&#x27;s history, as its all-time leader in scoring (2,094 points), assists (714), and steals (256). Nelson&#x27;s number was retired by the university on April 23, 2004.

Because of his extraordinary accomplishments as a senior, Nelson won the 2004 Wooden Award, the 2004 Naismith Award, the 2004 Bob Cousy Award, the Rupp Trophy, the Oscar Robertson Trophy and many more accolades, including being featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Nelson was the first Atlantic 10 athlete to be on the cover of the magazine since Mark Macon in 1988.

==Professional career==

===Orlando Magic (2004–2014)===
Nelson was selected with the 20th overall pick in the 2004 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets, and was subsequently traded to the Orlando Magic for a 2005 first-round draft pick. Though many speculated he would be a top 10 pick, he fell to number 20, and the Magic were able to acquire both Nelson and Dwight Howard in the same draft.

As a rookie, Nelson served as the primary backup to the Magic&#x27;s All-Star point guard Steve Francis. Due to Nelson&#x27;s impressive play, the Magic moved Francis to shooting guard to make room for Nelson to start at point guard. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team, and garnered Rookie of the Year consideration.

On February 22, 2006, the Magic dealt Francis to the New York Knicks, paving the way for Nelson to become the long-term starting point guard of Orlando. Nelson&#x27;s play improved with the mid-season trade of Francis, finishing the season with averages of 14.6 points and 5 assists per game on 48.3% field goal shooting.

The following year, Nelson helped lead the Magic back into the postseason for the first time since 2003. He averaged 14.3 points, 3 rebounds, and 3.3 assists per game during the NBA playoffs, however the Magic were ultimately swept by the top-seeded Detroit Pistons in the first round.

During the 2008 All-Star weekend Slam Dunk Contest, Nelson assisted teammate Dwight Howard on several of his dunks, including the famous Superman dunk. That year, the Magic once again made the playoffs, defeating the Toronto Raptors in the first round before falling to the Pistons in the second round. He averaged 16.2 points, 4.7 assists and 4.1 rebounds per game through the playoffs, helping Orlando to their first playoff series win in 12 years.
Nelson set career highs in points, steals, and shooting percentages during the 2008–09 NBA season. He, along with teammates Dwight Howard and Rashard Lewis, were selected to play in the 2009 NBA All-Star Game. However, a torn labrum in Nelson&#x27;s right shoulder, a potential season-ending injury, forced him to miss the game. Nelson was averaging 16.7 points per game and 5.4 assists at the time. After a four-month recovery, Nelson returned for the NBA Finals with the controversial decision by Stan Van Gundy for allowing him to play in heavy minutes by limiting Rafer Alston playing, which led the team into demise as the Magic were defeated by the Lakers in five games.

On November 16, Nelson suffered a torn meniscus in his left knee, and had arthroscopic surgery to repair his knee. He returned to action on December 21. Nelson and the Magic again surged into the playoffs with their third straight Southeast Division title, sweeping the Charlotte Bobcats and Atlanta Hawks before falling to the Boston Celtics in six games in the Eastern Conference Finals. He averaged 19 points and 4.8 assists per game in Orlando&#x27;s 14 playoff games.
On March 18, 2011, Nelson made a game winning buzzer beater against the Denver Nuggets to secure an 85–82 victory for Orlando. On April 10, 2011, Nelson&#x27;s last-second three-pointer was ruled &quot;no basket&quot;, and the Magic lost to the Chicago Bulls 102–99.

Nelson and Dwight Howard, who were close friends since their rookie seasons, were on opposite sides of a trade that sent Rashard Lewis to Washington in exchange for Gilbert Arenas (Nelson considered Lewis one of the team&#x27;s leaders while Howard reportedly pushed management into making the trade). Their relationship was further strained when Howard publicly stated his desire to play with a superstar point guard like Deron Williams or Chris Paul, and was reportedly the driving force behind the firing of coach Stan Van Gundy. Howard eventually forced a trade to the Lakers in the 2012 offseason. Despite this, Nelson re-signed with the Magic on a three-year deal.

On February 23, 2014, Nelson scored his 8020th point, passing Shaquille O&#x27;Neal for fourth place on the Magic&#x27;s all-time scoring list.

On June 30, 2014, he was waived by the Magic after 10 seasons with the team.

===Dallas Mavericks (2014)===

On July 24, 2014, Nelson signed a two-year, $5.6 million contract with the Dallas Mavericks. He appeared in 23 games for the Mavericks and averaged 7.3 points and 4.1 assists per game.

===Boston Celtics (2014–2015)===
On December 18, 2014, Nelson was traded, along with Jae Crowder, Brandan Wright, a 2015 first-round pick, a 2016 second-round pick and a $12.9 million trade exception, to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Rajon Rondo and Dwight Powell. In six games for Boston, Nelson averaged 4.8 points and 5.5 assists per game. In his second game with Boston, Nelson returned to Orlando for the first time since leaving for Dallas as a free agent.

===Denver Nuggets (2015–2017)===
On January 13, 2015, Nelson was traded to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for Nate Robinson. On June 26, 2015, Nelson opted out of the remaining year of his contract with the Nuggets to become a free agent.

On August 7, 2015, Nelson re-signed with the Nuggets.

On October 18, 2017, Nelson was waived by the Nuggets.

===New Orleans Pelicans (2017–2018)===
On October 22, 2017, Nelson signed with the New Orleans Pelicans.

===Detroit Pistons (2018)===
On February 1, 2018, Nelson was traded, along with Ömer Aşık, Tony Allen and a protected first-round pick, to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for Nikola Mirotić and a 2018 second-round pick. In addition, Chicago will have the right to swap its 2021 second-round pick with New Orleans&#x27; own 2021 second-round pick. Seven days later, he was traded to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Willie Reed and future second-round draft considerations.

Nelson&#x27;s final NBA game was played on March 13, 2018, in a 79–110 loss to the Utah Jazz. In his final game, Nelson played for 26 minutes and recorded 4 assists, 1 rebound, 1 steal but no points.

==Executive career==
On November 11, 2020, the Delaware Blue Coats of the NBA G League named Nelson as the assistant general manager.

<text>In combinatorial mathematics, the Lubell–Yamamoto–Meshalkin inequality, more commonly known as the LYM inequality, is an inequality on the sizes of sets in a Sperner family, proved by , , , and . It is named for the initials of three of its discoverers. To include the initials of all four discoverers, it is sometimes referred to as the YBLM inequality.

This inequality belongs to the field of combinatorics of sets, and has many applications in combinatorics. In particular, it can be used to prove Sperner&#x27;s theorem. Its name is also used for similar inequalities.

==Statement of the theorem==
Let &quot;U&quot; be an &quot;n&quot;-element set, let &quot;A&quot; be a family of subsets of &quot;U&quot; such that no set in &quot;A&quot; is a subset of another set in &quot;A&quot;, and let &quot;ak&quot; denote the number of sets of size &quot;k&quot; in &quot;A&quot;. Then
: formula_1

==Lubell&#x27;s proof==
 proves the Lubell–Yamamoto–Meshalkin inequality by a double counting argument in which he counts the permutations of &quot;U&quot; in two different ways. First, by counting all permutations of &quot;U&quot; identified with {1, …, &quot;n&quot; } directly, one finds that there are &quot;n&quot;! of them. But secondly, one can generate a permutation (i.e., an order) of the elements of &quot;U&quot; by selecting a set &quot;S&quot; in &quot;A&quot; and choosing a map that sends {1, … , |&quot;S&quot; | } to &quot;S&quot;. If |&quot;S&quot; | = &quot;k&quot;, the set &quot;S&quot; is associated in this way with &quot;k&quot;!(&quot;n&quot; − &quot;k&quot;)! permutations, and in each of them the image of the first &quot;k&quot; elements of &quot;U&quot; is exactly &quot;S&quot;. Each permutation may only be associated with a single set in &quot;A&quot;, for if two prefixes of a permutation both formed sets in &quot;A&quot; then one would be a subset of the other. Therefore, the number of permutations that can be generated by this procedure is
:formula_2
Since this number is at most the total number of all permutations,
:formula_3
Finally dividing the above inequality by &quot;n&quot;! leads to the result.

== History ==
The castle &quot;Gloworp&quot; was first mentioned in the 12th century. The town itself probably was a foundation from lower rhenish settlers from Aachen which is spelled Aken in the Dutch language. Aken, a rectangular settlement with a regular system of streets, was first documented in 1219, naming the mayor Waltherus de Aken. In 1270 Aken received its town charter as &quot;Civitas&quot;. The name Aken could be based on the Latin word &quot;Aqua&quot; (location at or near the water). Aken developed into a prosperous town due to its inland harbour on river Elbe which was enlarged and modernized after 1889.

<doc id="748699" wikidata="Q4874116" url="?curid=748699" title="Columbia Gas of Massachusetts">
<text>Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, the assumed name of Bay State Gas Company, was a supplier of retail natural gas to over 300,000 customers in parts of Massachusetts surrounding Springfield, Brockton, and Lawrence. It was a subsidiary of NiSource. The company&#x27;s operations in New Hampshire and Maine were sold to Unitil Corporation in 2008.

The company received attention after the Merrimack Valley gas explosions in September 2018. In February 2020, it was announced that energy company Eversource would acquire the Massachusetts gas assets of Columbia Gas for $1.1 billion. Columbia Gas was also ordered to pay a $53 million fine for violating the Pipeline Safety Act. The acquisition by Eversource was completed in October 2020, effectively ending Columbia Gas operations in Massachusetts.

==2018 Merrimack Valley gas explosions==

On September 13, 2018, starting at approximately 4:20 PM, three Merrimack Valley communities supplied by Columbia—Lawrence, Andover, and North Andover, Massachusetts—suffered numerous fires and explosions as a result of an over-pressurized subterranean gas line. Massachusetts authorities evacuated the communities and the American Red Cross deployed and set up numerous shelters in nearby communities for those who were displaced by the explosions and subsequent fires. On September 14, Governor of Massachusetts Charlie Baker declared a state of emergency, and issued a decree appointing Eversource to evaluate and oversee the management of the gas distribution system in the affected area.
The company remained without response for almost an entire day following the incidents in Lawrence, North Andover, and Andover. The CEO was criticized by the governor, as well as several town and city leaders.

<doc id="748700" wikidata="Q17118831" url="?curid=748700" title="Oche">
<text>The oche , also the throw line or toe line, in the game of darts is the line behind which the throwing player must stand. For steel tip darts, it is generally from the face of the dartboard, measured perpendicularly. This is the recognized world standard as set by the World Darts Federation and is used in most areas. The diagonal distance from the bull&#x27;s eye to the oche, , may also be used. In soft tipped darts, the perpendicular distance is , as set by the American National Dart Association. This was the original distance first standardized by the British Darts Organisation for all darts.

The throwing player must stand so that no portion of either foot extends past the edge of the oche closest to the dartboard. One or both feet may touch any other portion, and the player may lean forward over the oche if desired.

==Origin==
The origin of the term is unknown, though it probably came into use in the 1920s. It was originally spelled &quot;hockey&quot;, only becoming &quot;oche&quot; in the late 1970s.

There is a popular (but unsubstantiated) theory that there was a brewery called &quot;S. Hockey and Sons&quot; in the West Country of England whose beer crates were used to measure out the from the dartboard. This tale is also sometimes associated with the phrase &quot;toeing the hockey&quot;. However, according to a statement made by the Brewery History Society in the 1990s, no records of such a brewery can be found.

Another theory traces the term&#x27;s origin to darts competitions held in the 1920s by an English newspaper, the &quot;News of the World&quot;. This newspaper used the word &quot;hockey&quot; for the throwing line in their tournament rules, and may have been the first to do so. &quot;Hockey&quot; might be derived from the Old English word which meant &#x27;to spit&#x27;. It is said that spitting competitions were held in the bars of English public houses, and that the &quot;hockey line&quot; was determined by the length that a given player could spit from a position with his back to the dartboard.

Eric Partridge suggested that the term comes from &quot;hoggins line&quot;.

<doc id="748730" wikidata="Q819142" url="?curid=748730" title="Sperner family">
<text>In combinatorics, a Sperner family (or Sperner system; named in honor of Emanuel Sperner), or clutter, is a family F of subsets of a finite set &quot;E&quot; in which none of the sets contains another. Equivalently, a Sperner family is an antichain in the inclusion lattice over the power set of &quot;E&quot;. A Sperner family is also sometimes called an independent system or irredundant set.

Sperner families are counted by the Dedekind numbers, and their size is bounded by Sperner&#x27;s theorem and the Lubell–Yamamoto–Meshalkin inequality. They may also be described in the language of hypergraphs rather than set families, where they are called clutters.

==Dedekind numbers==
The number of different Sperner families on a set of &quot;n&quot; elements is counted by the Dedekind numbers, the first few of which are
:2, 3, 6, 20, 168, 7581, 7828354, 2414682040998, 56130437228687557907788 .
Although accurate asymptotic estimates are known for larger values of &quot;n&quot;, it is unknown whether there exists an exact formula that can be used to compute these numbers efficiently.

The collection of all Sperner families on a set of &quot;n&quot; elements can be organized as a free distributive lattice, in which the join of two Sperner families is obtained from the union of the two families by removing sets that are a superset of another set in the union.

==Bounds on the size of a Sperner family==

=== Sperner&#x27;s theorem ===

The &quot;k&quot;-element subsets of an &quot;n&quot;-element set form a Sperner family, the size of which is maximized when &quot;k&quot; = &quot;n&quot;/2 (or the nearest integer to it).
Sperner&#x27;s theorem states that these families are the largest possible Sperner families over an &quot;n&quot;-element set. Formally, the theorem states that, for every Sperner family &quot;S&quot; over an &quot;n&quot;-element set,

:formula_1

===LYM inequality===
The Lubell–Yamamoto–Meshalkin inequality provides another bound on the size of a Sperner family, and can be used to prove Sperner&#x27;s theorem.
It states that, if &quot;ak&quot; denotes the number of sets of size &quot;k&quot; in a Sperner family over a set of &quot;n&quot; elements, then
: formula_2

==Clutters==
A clutter is a family of subsets of a finite set such that none contains any other; that is, it is a Sperner family. The difference is in the questions typically asked. Clutters are an important structure in the study of combinatorial optimization.

In more complicated language, a clutter is a hypergraph formula_3 with the added property that formula_4 whenever formula_5 and formula_6 (i.e. no edge properly contains another). An opposite notion to a clutter is an abstract simplicial complex, where every subset of an edge is contained in the hypergraph; this is an order ideal in the poset of subsets of &quot;V&quot;.

If formula_7 is a clutter, then the blocker of &quot;H&quot;, denoted by formula_8, is the clutter with vertex set &quot;V&quot; and edge set consisting of all minimal sets formula_9 so that formula_10 for every formula_11. It can be shown that formula_12 , so blockers give us a type of duality. We define formula_13 to be the size of the largest collection of disjoint edges in &quot;H&quot; and formula_14 to be the size of the smallest edge in formula_8. It is easy to see that formula_16.

=== Examples ===
# If &quot;G&quot; is a simple loopless graph, then formula_17 is a clutter (if edges are treated as unordered pairs of vertices) and formula_8 is the collection of all minimal vertex covers. Here formula_13 is the size of the largest matching and formula_14 is the size of the smallest vertex cover. Kőnig&#x27;s theorem states that, for bipartite graphs, formula_21. However for other graphs these two quantities may differ.
# Let &quot;G&quot; be a graph and let formula_22. The collection &quot;H&quot; of all edge-sets of &quot;s&quot;-&quot;t&quot; paths is a clutter and formula_8 is the collection of all minimal edge cuts which separate &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot;. In this case formula_13 is the maximum number of edge-disjoint &quot;s&quot;-&quot;t&quot; paths, and formula_14 is the size of the smallest edge-cut separating &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot;, so Menger&#x27;s theorem (edge-connectivity version) asserts that formula_21.
# Let &quot;G&quot; be a connected graph and let &quot;H&quot; be the clutter on formula_27 consisting of all edge sets of spanning trees of &quot;G&quot;. Then formula_8 is the collection of all minimal edge cutsets in &quot;G&quot;.

=== Minors ===
There is a minor relation on clutters which is similar to the minor relation on graphs. If formula_7 is a clutter and formula_30, then we may delete &quot;v&quot; to get the clutter formula_31 with vertex set formula_32 and edge set consisting of all formula_11 which do not contain &quot;v&quot;. We contract &quot;v&quot; to get the clutter formula_34. These two operations commute, and if &quot;J&quot; is another clutter, we say that &quot;J&quot; is a minor of &quot;H&quot; if a clutter isomorphic to &quot;J&quot; may be obtained from &quot;H&quot; by a sequence of deletions and contractions.

<text>A cooper is a craftsman who produces wooden casks, barrels, vats, buckets, tubs, troughs, and other similar containers from timber staves that were usually heated or steamed to make them pliable.

Journeymen coopers also traditionally made wooden implements, such as rakes and wooden-bladed shovels. In addition to wood, other materials, such as iron, were used in the manufacturing process. The trade is the origin of the surname Cooper.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;cooper&quot; is derived from Middle Dutch or Middle Low German &quot;kūper&quot; &#x27;cooper&#x27; from &quot;kūpe&quot; &#x27;cask&#x27;, in turn from Latin &quot;cupa&quot; &#x27;tun, barrel&#x27;. The word was adopted in England as an occupational surname, Cooper. 

The art and skill of &quot;coopering&quot; refers to the manufacture of wooden casks, or barrels. The facility in which casks are made is referred to as a cooperage.

==History==
Traditionally, a cooper is someone who makes wooden, staved vessels, held together with wooden or metal hoops and possessing flat ends or heads. Examples of a cooper&#x27;s work include casks, barrels, buckets, tubs, butter churns, vats, hogsheads, firkins, tierces, rundlets, puncheons, pipes, tuns, butts, troughs, pins and breakers. 

A &quot;&quot; was the man who fitted the wooden or metal hoops around the barrels or buckets that the cooper had made, essentially an assistant to the cooper. The English name Hooper is derived from that profession. Over time, coopers took on the role of the hooper themselves.

===Antiquity===

An Egyptian wall-painting in the tomb of Hesy-Ra, dating to 2600 BC, shows a wooden tub made of staves, bound together with wooden hoops, and used to measure. Another Egyptian tomb painting dating to 1900 BC shows a cooper and tubs made of staves in use at the grape harvest. Palm-wood casks were reported in use in ancient Babylon. In Europe, buckets and casks dating to 200 BC have been found preserved in the mud of lake villages. A lake village near Glastonbury dating to the late Iron Age has yielded one complete tub and a number of wooden staves. 

The Roman historian Pliny the Elder reports that cooperage in Europe originated with the Gauls in Alpine villages where they stored their beverages in wooden casks bound with hoops. Pliny identified three types of coopers: ordinary coopers, wine coopers and coopers who made large casks. Large casks contained more and longer staves and were correspondingly more difficult to assemble. Roman coopers tended to be independent tradesmen, passing their skills on to their sons. The Greek geographer Strabo records wooden &quot;pithoi&quot; (casks) were lined with pitch to stop leakage and preserve the wine. Barrels were sometimes used for military purposes. Julius Caesar used catapults to hurl barrels of burning tar into towns under siege to start fires. 

Empty casks were used to line the walls of shallow wells from at least Roman times. Such casks were found in 1897 during archaeological excavation of Roman Silchester in Britain. They were made of Pyrenean silver fir and the staves were one and a half inches thick and featured grooves where the heads fitted. They had Roman numerals scratched on the surface of each stave to help with reassembly.

In Anglo-Saxon Britain, wooden barrels were used to store ale, butter, honey, and mead. Drinking vessels were also made from small staves of oak, yew or pine. These items required considerable craftsmanship to hold liquids and might be bound with finely worked precious metals. They were highly valued items and were sometimes buried with the dead as grave goods. 

After the Battle of Hastings in 1066, when the Normans started settling in England, much wine was shipped over the English Channel from France.

Wherever and whatever goods were traded, casks were used, in the same way as cardboard boxes later became common storage containers.

===Middle Ages to 20th century===
====On ships====
Ships, in the age of sail, provided much work for coopers. They made water and provision casks, the contents of which sustained crew and passengers on long voyages. They also made barrels to contain high-value commodities, such as wine and sugar. The proper stowage of casks on ships about to sail was an important stevedoring skill. Casks of various sizes were used to accommodate the sloping walls of the hull and make maximum use of limited space. Casks also had to be tightly packed, to ensure they did not move during the voyage and endanger the ship, crew and cask contents. 

Whaling ships in particular, featuring long voyages and large crews, needed many casks – for salted meat, other provisions and water – and to store the whale oil. Sperm whale oil was a particularly difficult substance to contain, due to its highly viscous nature, and oil coopers were perhaps the most skilled tradesmen in pre-industrial cooperage. Whaling ships usually carried a cooper on board, to assemble shooks (disassembled barrels) and maintain casks. 

In the 19th century, coopers who crafted barrels on ships were often called groggers (or jolly jack tars), as when a barrel of rum had been emptied, they would fill it up with boiling water and roll it around, creating a drink which was called grog.

====On land====
Coopers in Britain started to organise as early as 1298. The Worshipful Company of Coopers is one of the oldest Livery Companies in London. It still survives today although it is now largely a charitable organisation. In the 16th century, the company won the right for coopers to be independent from breweries.

Many coopers worked for breweries, making the large wooden vats in which beer was brewed, such as Guinness in Ireland. They also made the wooden kegs in which the beer was shipped to liquor retailers. Beer kegs had to be particularly strong in order to contain the pressure of the fermenting liquid, and the rough handling they received when transported, sometime over long distances, to pubs where they were rolled into tap-rooms or were lowered into cellars. 

Prior to the mid-20th century, the cooper&#x27;s trade flourished in the United States; a dedicated trade journal was published, the &quot;National Cooper&#x27;s Journal&quot;, with advertisements from firms that supplied everything from barrel staves to purpose-built machinery.

After the Industrial Revolution at the turn of the 19th century and prohibition in the United States in the early 20th century, there was less demand for barrels, and over time, various other containers were manufactured for shipping goods, including shipping containers, metal drums, and corrugated cardboard. Storing, shipping, and fermenting alcohol became the main uses for wooden barrels. 

In the early days, Guinness employed its own team of up to 300 highly-paid coopers in the brewery, making barrels which would be shipped around the world, and wooden casks were used by the brewery for nearly two centuries. In 1946 aluminium kegs were introduced, and over time gradually replaced the wooden barrels, until these in turn were replaced by stainless steel in the late 1980s. By 1961 there were only 70 coopers still employed by Guinness, and the last wooden cask was used in March 1963.

==Construction, types, and sizes ==
===Wood===
Barrels intended for wine storage are made predominantly with either French common oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;), French white oak (&quot;Quercus petraea&quot;) or American white oak (&quot;Quercus alba&quot;), or &quot;Quercus sessilifolia&quot;, an Asian species that grows in Japan, Taiwan, and much of south-eastern China.

===Types of coopering===
There are three main categories of coopering:
*White coopering, creating pails, butter churns, tubs, spoons, ladles, and other household equipment 
*Dry, or &quot;slack&quot; (U.S.), coopering, making casks for holding dry goods, like flour, tobacco and vegetables, designed to keep moisture out
*Wet, or &quot;tight&quot; (U.S.) coopering, making casks for holding liquids, including water, wine, whiskey, milk, oil, and paint

===Cask sizes===

In wet coopering, wooden casks were traditionally made in several sizes in England and Ireland, including:
* Firkin, containing 
* Kilderkin, containing 
* Barrel, containing 
* Hogshead, containing 
* Butt, containing 

The firkin is the most common size for an ale cask.

===Construction process===
As part of the barrel-making process, the cask needs to be steamed to soften and loosen lignin in the wood, and it is then toasted. Toasting develops the flavours of the sugars in the wood, that is the cellulose and hemicellulose. Then the barrel is charred, which involves exposing it to for 45 seconds.

A wine barrel is toasted for around 35 minutes with a low fire, while for whiskey it is usual to toast for just 45 seconds on a high fire, to burn the surface.

==21st century==
In the 21st century, coopers mostly operate barrel-making machinery and assemble casks for the wine and spirits industry. Traditionally, the staves were heated to make them easier to bend. This is still done, but now because the slightly toasted interior of the staves imparts a certain flavour over time to the wine or spirit contents that is much admired by experts. 

In the 1960s, breweries started using metal casks because of cost and simplicity; since then, the trade of master cooper in England has been dwindling. In 2009 there were only four breweries left in England employing coopers, and only one was a master cooper: Alastair Simms at Wadworth Brewery in Devizes, Wiltshire). When he appealed for apprentices, there were many applications, but the government&#x27;s insistence that trainees should attend a university killed off a lot of the interest. Subsequently, there has been a resurgence of craft breweries and English winemakers employing coopers. In 2015 Simms was at Theakston Brewery in Masham, North Yorkshire. Simms had an apprentice by November 2015. He still uses the traditional tools, including a which he estimates is over 250 years old.

In the United States, there are also few master coopers left. Ramiro Herrera, Master Cooper for Caldwell Vineyard in the Napa Valley, was sent to France to learn his trade, where only two out of 40 starters completed the four-year training course. It takes him around 11 hours to build a barrel, before it is ready to be toasted.

Recycling casks is common in the trade, and wine casks may be converted to contain beer. Centuries-old tools remain the preferred tool of the master cooper.

By 2021, very few of the 30-odd coopers left in the United States still used traditional methods.

The number of coopers has declined in Australia. A 1959 photograph held in the National Library of Australia is captioned &quot;The cooper Harry Mahlo (one of the last coopers) Yalumba wineries, Angaston, Barossa Valley, South Australia, 1959&quot;. Several cooperages have closed in the 21st century, and, while there is a need for new coopers, there has been no pathway to the trade via apprenticeships since 1996, when the Howard government reformed the apprenticeship scheme to focus particularly on construction, food and hospitality, and hairdressing. In January 2024, it was reported that there was only one winery left in Australia still making its own barrels for storing wine, and there were fewer than 100 people still making barrels at small cooperages for other purposes. Some cooperages, such as the Margaret River Cooperage in Margaret River, Western Australia, do not make new barrels, but recooper imported barrels for use by small wineries.

==In film==
The 2015 film &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; featured master cooper Alastair Simms, who made 200 barrels for the film.

<text>Alana Monique Beard (born May 14, 1982) is an American former professional basketball player. After playing college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils, she was drafted second overall by the Washington Mystics in the 2004 WNBA draft. She signed on with the Los Angeles Sparks as a free agent in 2012. Beard was the 2017 and 2018 WNBA Defensive Player of the Year. Beard announced her retirement from the WNBA on January 23, 2020.

==Early years==
Beard was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, on May 14, 1982, to LeRoy and Marie Beard. She played for Southwood High School in Shreveport, Louisiana, where she led her team to four consecutive state titles. The team compiled a record of 144–6 while she was on the team. She scored 2,646 points during her four years, and finished her high school career with 53 consecutive victories. Beard was named a WBCA All-American. She participated in the 2000 WBCA High School All-America Game, where she scored fifteen points.

==College==
Coach Gail Goestenkors, then at Duke University, successfully recruited Beard. During her four years, she set a school scoring record of 2,687 points. Beard is the first NCAA basketball player to amass over 2,600 points, 500 assist and 400 steals. During the four years Beard played for Duke, the team won four regular season and tournaments championships. Beard helped Duke reach the Final Four twice in her career. In her senior year, the team achieved the first ever number one ranking in the final AP poll of the year.

==WNBA career==
Beard was drafted in 2004 with the 2nd overall pick by the Washington Mystics. In her rookie season, she immediately became a starter and helped lead the Mystics to the playoffs, despite the loss of star Chamique Holdsclaw halfway through the season. They lost to the Connecticut Sun in the first round of the playoffs 2–1.

In her second season, Beard was named a WNBA All-Star for the first time in her career, while averaging 14.1 ppg, but the Mystics never made the playoffs.

Beard had the best year of her career in the 2006 season, averaging a career-high 19.2 ppg, shooting nearly 50% from the field and was once again named a WNBA All-Star. Her season performance, led the Mystics to a playoff berth but were eliminated yet again by Connecticut in the first round in a 2-game sweep.

The 2009 season would be Beard&#x27;s final year playing with the Mystics. Following the 2009 season, Beard sat out two consecutive seasons, she missed the 2010 season after undergoing surgery to repair an ankle tendon and sat out the 2011 season with a foot injury.
After recovering from back-to-back season ending injuries, Beard signed with the Los Angeles Sparks in 2012 during free agency. Beard played the shooting guard in the Sparks&#x27;s starting lineup. With a supporting cast of Candace Parker, Kristi Toliver and Nneka Ogwumike, the Sparks made it back to the playoffs for the first time in 2 years with Beard&#x27;s contributions as the Sparks finished second in the Western Conference with a 24–10 record. She averaged 11.4 ppg in 33 games while shooting a career-high in 3-point field goal percentage. The Sparks made it to the second round but were swept 2-0 by the Minnesota Lynx.

Prior to the 2015 season, Beard re-signed with the Sparks in free agency. During the 2015 season, Beard missed the first two months with plantar fasciitis. She played 14 games with 11 starts, averaging 7.8 ppg after recovery. By this time, Beard had already transitioned into playing the small forward in the Sparks&#x27;s starting lineup. The Sparks still made it to the playoffs but lost 2–1 in the first round by the Minnesota Lynx, who won the championship that year.

In the 2016 season, Beard would be fully healthy, playing and starting in all 34 games, averaging 7.1 ppg. With the all-star trio of Parker, Toliver and Ogwumike, the Sparks were a championship contender and finished with a 26–8 record. With the WNBA&#x27;s new playoff format in effect, the Sparks were the number 2 seed in the league with a double-bye to the semi-finals (the last round before the WNBA Finals) facing the Chicago Sky. The Sparks defeated the Sky 3–1 in the series, advancing to the WNBA Finals for the first time since 2003. In the WNBA Finals, it was the second time in league history where two teams from the same conference faced each other in the Finals due to the new playoff format, as they faced the championship-defending Minnesota Lynx. It would be Beard&#x27;s first career finals appearance and one of the most memorable highlights of the series was in Game 1 where Beard made a game-winning jump shot at the buzzer to give the Sparks a 1–0 lead. The Sparks would go on to win the series in five games, clinching the 2016 WNBA Championship and Beard winning her first career championship.

In February 2017, Beard re-signed once again with the Sparks in free agency. During the 2017 season, Beard would once again start in 34 games for the second consecutive season, averaging 6.9 ppg, achieved a career-high in field goal shooting percentage and also led the league in steals, helping the Sparks to 26–8 record and the number 2 seed in the league. In September 2017, the WNBA announced that Beard won the WNBA Defensive Player of the Year, becoming only the second Sparks player after Lisa Leslie to do so. The Sparks would go on to advance to the Finals for the second season in a row, after defeating the Phoenix Mercury in a 3-game sweep, setting up a rematch with the Lynx. However, the Sparks would lose in five games, failing to win back-to-back championships.

In February 2018, Beard again re-signed with the Sparks in free agency. Midway through the season, Beard suffered a groin injury which kept her out for a few weeks and would make her return by August. Beard would finish the season with a career-low in scoring, but she would end up winning Defensive Player of the Year for the second year in a row. The Sparks finished 19–15 with the number 6 seed. They would defeat the championship-defending Minnesota Lynx 75–68 in the first round elimination game. In the second round elimination game, the Sparks would lose 96–64 to the Washington Mystics.

In February 2019, Beard re-signed with the Sparks for the fourth time. In 2019, Beard was struggled with a hamstring injury throughout the entire season, causing her to only play half the season, also resulting in less playing time and a new career-low in scoring. Despite this, the Sparks were still a playoff team earning the number 3 seed with a 22–12 record, receiving a bye to the second round. They defeated the defending champion Seattle Storm in the second round elimination game by a score of 92–69. However, the Sparks were swept by the Connecticut Sun in the semi-finals.

Beard announced her retirement from the WNBA on January 23, 2020 after a 15-year career.

Beard was a member of the USA Women&#x27;s U18 team which won the gold medal at the FIBA Americas Championship in Mar Del Plata, Argentina. The event was held in July 2000, when the USA team defeated Cuba to win the championship. Beard helped the team the gold medal, starting all five games and leading all scorers with 15.4 points per game. She was the leading scorer in the opening game against Puerto Rico with 23 points (tied with Aminata Yanni) and the leading scorer against Argentina with 24 points.

She continued as a member of the team which went on to the World Championships in Brno, Czech Republic. Beard was the second leading scorer for the USA team (behind Diana Taurasi) with 18.0 points per game. That scoring placed her fifth among all participants. She helped the team win the bronze medal.

==Off the court==
In 2004, Beard started the &quot;Alana Beard Foundation&quot; a nonprofit organization that sponsors female AAU basketball teams, aiding young women with the necessary resources to achieve success on or off court. The foundation currently sponsors seven female AAU basketball teams. Six of the teams are located in Maryland called Alana Beard&#x27;s Future and one in her hometown Shreveport, Louisiana, called the Southern Mystics.

In 2018, Beard traveled to the Philippines as a Sports Envoy with the U.S. State Department&#x27;s Sports Diplomacy Office. Together with Cherokee Parks, she led a basketball clinic for youth in Davao and Manila. In so doing, Beard helped contribute to Sports Diplomacy&#x27;s mission to promote leadership and inclusion in youth.

<doc id="748738" wikidata="Q235392" url="?curid=748738" title="Chlodio">
<text>Chlodio (probably died after 450), also Clodio, Clodius, Clodion, Cloio or Chlogio, was a Frankish king who attacked and then apparently ruled Roman-inhabited lands around Cambrai and Tournai, near the modern border of Belgium and France. He is known from very few records.

His influence probably reached as far south as the River Somme. He was therefore the first Frankish ruler to become established so deep within the Roman Empire, and distant from the border regions where the Franks had already been established for a long time. He was possibly a descendant of the Salian Franks, who Roman sources report to have settled within Texandria in the 4th century.

Gregory of Tours reported that in his time people believed that the Merovingian dynasty, who were still ruling, were descended somehow from Chlodio.

== Name ==
&quot;Chlodio&quot; is a short form of Frankish names such as &quot;*Hlodowig&quot; (the same name as Clovis, Louis and Ludwig) or *&quot;Hlodhari&quot; (Chlothar, modern Lothar), which are derived from the Germanic root *&quot;hlod&quot;- (&#x27;famous&#x27;).

==Ancestry==

In later medieval chronicles, several different ancestries were given, naming Franks who were known from earlier Roman historical records. These pedigrees are considered unreliable today.

The non-contemporary &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot; says his father was Pharamond, a Frankish King only known from medieval records. Pharamond in turn was said to be the son of a real Frankish king, known to have fought the Romans, named Marcomer. 

The &quot;Chronicle of Fredegar&quot;, on the other hand, makes Chlodio a son of Theudemeres, another real Frankish king who Gregory of Tours reported to have been executed with his mother by the Romans.

==Attestations==
Gregory of Tours (II,9) reported that &quot;Chlogio&quot; (as he spells his name in Latin) attacked from a fort (&quot;castrum&quot;) named &quot;Dispargum&quot; within or upon the bounds of the &quot;Thoringian&quot; land, which is described as being west of the Rhine and north of the Romanized population living in Gaul north of the Loire. One translation of what Gregory wrote, adding some Latin key words in square brackets, is as follows:
:It is commonly said that the Franks came originally from Pannonia and first colonized the banks of the Rhine. Then they crossed the river, marched through Thuringia [&quot;Thoringiam transmeasse&quot;], and set up in each country district [&quot;pagus&quot;] and each city [&quot;civitas&quot;] long-haired kings chosen from the foremost and most noble family of their race. [...] They also say that Clodio, a man of high birth and marked ability among his people, was King of the Franks and that he lived in the castle of Duisberg [&quot;Dispargum castrum&quot;] in Thuringian territory [&quot;in terminum Thoringorum&quot;]. In those parts, that is towards the south, the Romans occupied the territory as far as the River Loire. [...] Clodio sent spies to the town of Cambrai. When they discovered all that they needed to know, he himself followed and crushed the Romans and captured the town. He lived there only a short time and then occupied the country up to the Somme. Some say that Merovech, the father of Childeric, was descended from Clodio.

This description of locations does not match the normal medieval and modern &quot;Thuringia&quot;, which is far inland and east of the Rhine and distant from all known Frankish areas.

Dispargum has therefore been interpreted many ways, for example possibly as Duisburg on the Rhine itself, or Duisburg near Brussels, or Diest, which is also in Belgium. The latter two proposals would fit the geography well, because they are within striking distance of the &quot;Silva Carbonaria&quot;, west of the Rhine, and close to Toxandria, which is known to have been settled by the Salians in the time of Julian the Apostate. It suggests that &quot;&quot;Thoringorum&quot; (genitive case) was actually referring to the &quot;Civitas Tungrorum&quot;. This matches Gregory&#x27;s previous mention in the same passage of how the Franks had earlier settled on the banks of the Rhine and then moved into &quot;Thoringia&quot;&quot; on the left side of the Rhine. 

According to this account, Chlodio held power in the northernmost part of still-Romanized Northern Gaul, together with an area further northeast apparently already Frankish. 

Two works written after Gregory of Tours, added details which are generally considered unreliable, but which may contain some facts derived from other sources. These are the &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot; and the &quot;Chronicle of Fredegar&quot;. It is the first of these which specifies that Chlodio first pushed west through Roman-inhabited territories of the &quot;Silva Carbonaria&quot;, a large forested region which ran roughly from Brussels to the Sambre, and then took the Roman city of Turnacum (modern Tournai), before moving south to Cameracum (modern Cambrai). According to Lanting &amp; van der Plicht (2010), the Frankish conquest of Turnacum and Cameracum probably happened in the period 445–450. Syvänne Syvänne (2020) concludes that the Frankish War took place between 441 and 446.

In about 445 AD or 448 AD, a marriage party of the Franks of Chlodio was attacked and defeated at a village named Vicus Helena by Flavius Aëtius, the commander of the Roman army in Gaul. This is known because the future emperor Majorian was present, and this incident was therefore celebrated in the panegyric written by Sidonius Apollinaris for him. The passage describes &quot;Cloio&quot; as having overrun the land of the Atrebates (Artois, a province north of the Somme, and partly between Tournai and Cambrai).

==Possible connection to Merovingians==
As explained above, Gregory of Tours mentions that &quot;some people said&quot; that Merovech, the ancestor of the &#x27;Merovingian&#x27; dynasty, was descended from Chlodio. Merovech&#x27;s supposed son Childeric I is known only from records associating him with Romanized northern Gaul. Only once Childeric&#x27;s son Clovis I took power in that area did he turn to the Frankish kingdoms that were still ruling in more traditionally Frankish areas. According to Gregory&#x27;s understanding, the original Franks living west of the Rhine had different kings in each Roman district (&quot;pagus&quot; or &quot;civitas&quot;), but they were all part of one specific noble family, which had included Chlodio. However, according to the &quot;Gesta episcoporum Cameracensium&quot;, Clovis and his noble-blooded competitor King Ragnachar of Cambrai (the town Chlodio had put under Frankish control) were related not through the male line, but through Clovis&#x27;s mother, Basina, a &quot;Thuringian&quot; princess whom his father met when exiled from Gaul. Gregory reports that Clovis asked Ragnachar: &quot;Why have you humiliated our family in permitting yourself to be bound? It would have been better for you to die.&quot; He then killed him with an axe and told Radnachar&#x27;s brother Ricchar, &quot;If you had aided your brother, he would not have been bound&quot;, before killing Ricchar in the same way.

A contemporary Roman historian, Priscus writes of having witnessed in Rome, a &quot;lad without down on his cheeks as yet and with fair hair so long that it poured down his shoulders, Aetius had made him his adopted son&quot;. Priscus writes that the excuse Attila used for waging war on the Franks was the death of their king and the disagreement of his children over the succession, the elder being allied with Attila and the younger with Aetius. It has been speculated that this Frankish succession dispute may involve the royal family which supposedly included Chlodio and Merovech. On the other hand, it has also been argued that the Franks in this story must be Rhineland Franks, with whom Aëtius was known to have had various interactions.

<text>Snowbird is an unincorporated community in Little Cottonwood Canyon in the Wasatch Range of the Rocky Mountains near Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. It is most famous for Snowbird Ski and Summer Resort, an alpine skiing and snowboarding area, which opened in December 1971.

== History ==
The development of Little Cottonwood Canyon and the town of Alta dates to the 19th century. A U.S. Army soldier first prospected for silver there in 1869. Mining became a large local industry, and Little Cottonwood Canyon became one of the largest producers of silver ore in the Wasatch Mountains. Known as the Emma Mine (the origin of the name of the Big Emma ski run in Snowbird&#x27;s Gad Valley), the soldier&#x27;s find eventually produced more than $3.8 million in silver. At its peak, 8,000 people lived and worked in the narrow canyon, which held two smelters, 138 homes, hotels, boarding houses, stores and a railroad. The entire town was later destroyed by a series of avalanches.

The resort is a multi-facility winter and summer (primarily winter) resort. Mainly known for its winter powder skiing and snowboarding, during other seasons Snowbird also hosts hikers, mountain bikers, fishermen, and other mountain vacationers. The facilities include ski lifts, hotels, condominiums, spa facilities, restaurants, other resort-related retail businesses, and medical services.

The resort operates almost entirely on privately owned land, unlike the majority of Utah ski areas.

The originator of the Snowbird resort concept was Ted Johnson, who had managed the Alta Lodge in the town of Alta at the head of Little Cottonwood Canyon for about a decade. He had explored the terrain below Alta in the Peruvian Gulch and Emma Mine/Gad Valley watersheds that later became Snowbird. Johnson met Dick Bass, a Texas oilman, in 1969, and the two partnered to create the Snowbird resort, which opened in 1971. In 1974, Johnson sold his interest in Snowbird to Bass.

On May 12, 2014, an ownership change was announced. Businessman Ian Cumming became the majority owner, in partnership with Bass, who remained chairman. Dick Bass died in 2015 and Ted Johnson died in 2018.

In July 2021 Snowbird shut down the Tram Club, without any warning or prior intimation to the staff or public. It had been at Snowbird since 1994 and was a hot spot for locals in the community. The tram club was reopened in December 2022.

== Climate == 
Hidden Peak, , is the highest point within the Snowbird ski area. Hidden Peak has a subalpine climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;), bordering on an Alpine climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;). There is no weather station at the summit, but this climate table contains interpolated data for an area around the summit.
==Ski resort==

Snowbird resort is a year-round ski and summer resort located in the heart of the Wasatch National Forest on the eastern border of the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy. It is from Salt Lake City International Airport, from downtown Salt Lake City and east of the suburb of Sandy. The resort first opened in December 1971.

Snowbird shares Little Cottonwood Canyon with Alta Ski Area to the east, just up the canyon over a ridge that separates the two. Beginning winter 2002, the two resorts offer a joint day pass and a joint season ticket allowing full access all of the terrain on both mountains: 26 ski lifts and tows and a skiable area of . The collaboration coincided with the opening of a new lift in Mineral Basin, a large bowl owned by Snowbird on the back of Snowbird&#x27;s Hidden Peak and Alta&#x27;s Sugarloaf mountains that had been skiable within the resort since 1999. The installation of Baldy Express in 2002 allowed access to Alta from the Basin. Other access points between the two resorts exist as well. The offer is open to skiers only, as a result of Alta&#x27;s skiers-only (no snowboarders) policy.

Both areas receive more than of snowfall per year due to lake-effect enhancement from the Great Salt Lake, making them the second snowiest ski areas in the United States (after the ones in the Cascades). In contrast to the humid and wet conditions in the Cascades near the Pacific Ocean, the arid condition of the Great Basin produces very dry and powdery snow, making Snowbird and Alta top global destinations for powder-skiing aficionados. Another benefit of being East of the Great Salt Lake is that salt from the lake provides the condensation nuclei that creates ice pellet snow that doesn&#x27;t pack like normal snowflakes. Loose powder for days after a snowfall is common. On very windy days the salt is lifted thousands of feet and has been known to coat the windshield of airplanes flying into Salt Lake City.

Snowbird, which operates primarily on privately owned land, usually closes on Memorial Day in late May while the occasional ski year can last as long as the Fourth of July on the upper part of the mountain (accessed by the aerial tram), perennially offering the longest ski season in Utah as other Utah resorts must close earlier because they are on Forest Service land. Snowbird has a skiable area of with a vertical drop of from the summit of Hidden Peak, which has an elevation of above . Hidden Peak is serviced by an aerial tram from the base area.

The resort covers three drainage areas: Peruvian Gulch, Gad Valley, and Mineral Basin. Snowbird is perennially celebrated by industry magazines for its exceptional snowfall, vast and wide-ranging terrain and easy accessibility from the Salt Lake City International Airport.

Snowbird set a resort record of of cumulative snow (mid-mountain measurement) in May 2011. Snowbird is known for its particularly challenging terrain, with most ski runs having a difficulty of &quot;intermediates only&quot; or higher. The most difficult part of the mountain is the cirque traverse, which contains all runs for experts only.

=== Lifts ===

Snowbird currently has 10 chairlifts (6 high-speed quads, 4 doubles), a surface lift, an aerial tram, and a tunnel enclosing a one-way conveyor lift connecting Peruvian Gulch to Mineral Basin allowing easier access for beginners and intermediates to new terrain. The tunnel, the only of its kind in North America, also allows for skier transport when winds require the closing of the aerial tram. The tunnel connects the front half of the resort to Mineral Basin, which is the back half of the mountain. Inside of the tunnel, there are also pictures with descriptions about the history of the tunnel&#x27;s construction.

===Facilities===

The resort lodging includes: the Iron , the Inn, the Lodge at Snowbird, the Cliff Lodge and the Cliff Club. The resort also has gift shops, restaurants, arcades, hiking trails, pools and a rooftop spa. The summit restaurant was built atop Hidden Peak during the summer of 2015.

The resort has of meeting space, with 31 meeting rooms and a Event Center available in the summer.

===Summer activities===
While being widely known as a ski resort, Snowbird is also open during the summer. Throughout the warmer months, Snowbird offers activities such as: Alpine Slide, Mountain Coaster, Summer Tubing, Vertical Drop, and Ropes Courses.

The Alpine Slide is a course that runs down the Chickadee ski slope and includes twists, turns, and tunnels. The Mountain Coaster is a wheeled cart track that fits up to two riders. It sits near the base of the Peruvian Express chairlift outside the Snowbird Center. Summer Tubing is the warm weather version of snow tubing and is available to the east of Chickadee by the entrance of the Cliff Lodge. The Vertical Drop is a 50-foot tower drop ride located near the top of Chickadee. The Ropes Course, located near Chickadee bowl, allows participants to be strapped into a harness and walk high above ground. Other activities include hiking and mountain biking.

===Awards===
&quot;Skiing Magazine&quot; ranked the Alta-Snowbird ski area second in North America overall and first in the United States for the 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons.
According to &quot;SKI Magazine&quot; (October 2002) Snowbird ranked 20th in North America with gold medals in snow, access, challenge, terrain, scenery, weather, and lifts. In specific categories it was ranked third in North America for snow, fourth in North America for challenge, and fifth in North America for terrain. Snowbird ranks as the second best resort in North America, runner-up to Whistler Blackcomb resort in Canada, according to &quot;Skiing Magazine&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Outside&quot; named Alta-Snowbird the number one ski destination in North America. More recently, ZRankings ranked Snowbird as the fourth best ski resort in North America. Snowbird&#x27;s snowfall and weather is also considered to be amongst the best in the world for skiing; ZRankings rated Snowbird&#x27;s snow as the second best in North America (behind its next-door neighbor, Alta).
Two of Snowbird&#x27;s mountain school instructors, Rob Sogard and Nancy Thoreson, made &quot;SKI Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Top 100 list.

<text>&quot;Forever Marshall Islands&quot; (), also known by its incipit, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Our Islands&quot;), is the national anthem of the Marshall Islands. The lyrics were written by former President Amata Kabua, and the music was composed by Korean composer Gil ok-yun (also known by his Japanese name, Jun Yoshiya, 吉屋潤) by the request of President Kabua. The song was finished and recorded at Oasis Records in Seoul. Kabua and Gil became acquaintances after Jiyong (池勇), an economic adviser for President Amata Kabua, introduced Gil Ok Yun to Kabua.

The anthem was adopted in 1991. It replaced a previous national anthem, &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="748750" wikidata="Q788537" url="?curid=748750" title="Slot car">
<text>A slot car or slotcar is a powered miniature automobile or other vehicle that is guided by a groove or slot in the track on which it runs. A pin or blade extends from the bottom of the car into the slot. Though some slot cars are used to model highway traffic on scenic layouts, the great majority are used in the competitive hobby of slot car racing or slot racing.

==Description==

Slot cars are usually models of actual automobiles, though some have bodies purpose-designed for miniature racing. Most enthusiasts use commercially available slot cars (often modified for better performance), others motorize static models, and some &quot;scratch-build&quot;, creating their own mechanisms and bodies from basic parts and materials.

Drivers generally use a hand-held controller to regulate a low-voltage electric motor hidden within the car. Traditionally, each car runs on a separate lane with its own guide-slot (though recently developed digital technology can allow cars to share and change lanes). The challenge in racing slot cars comes in taking curves and other obstacles as fast as possible without causing the car to lose its grip and spin sideways, or to &#x27;deslot&#x27;, leaving the track altogether.

Some enthusiasts, much as in model railroading, build elaborate tracks, sculpted to have the appearance of a real-life racecourse, including miniature buildings, trees, and people. Hobbyists whose main goal is competition often prefer a track unobstructed by scenery.

Model motorcycles, trucks and other vehicles that use the guide-slot system are also generally included under the loose classification of &quot;slot car.&quot;

== Operation ==

The diagram on the right shows the wiring of a typical 1:24 or 1:32 slot car setup. Power for the car&#x27;s motor is carried by metal strips next to the slot, and is picked up by contacts alongside the guide flag (a swiveling blade) under the front of the slot car. The voltage is varied by a resistor in the hand controller. This is a basic circuit, and optional features such as braking elements or electronic control devices are not shown. Likewise, the car&#x27;s frame or chassis has been omitted for clarity.

HO slot cars work on a similar principle, but the current is carried by thin metal rails that project barely above the track surface and are set farther out from the slot. The car&#x27;s electrical contacts, called &quot;pickup shoes&quot;, are generally fixed directly to the chassis, and a round guide pin is often used instead of a swiveling flag.

Today, in all scales, traction magnets are sometimes used to provide downforce to help hold the car to the track at higher speeds, though some enthusiasts believe magnet-free racing provides greater challenge and enjoyment and allows the back of the car to slide or &quot;drift&quot; outward for visual realism.

== Scale ==

There are three common slotcar scales (sizes): 1:24 scale, 1:32 scale, and so-called HO size (1:87 to 1:64 scale). These are also commonly written as 1/24, 1/32, 1/87 and 1/64. Usual pronunciation is &quot;one twenty-fourth&quot;, &quot;one thirty-second&quot;, and so on, but sometimes &quot;one to twenty-four&quot;, &quot;one to thirty-two&quot;.
* 1:24 scale cars are built so that one unit of length (such as an inch or millimetre) on the model equals 24 units on the actual car. Thus, a model of a Jaguar XK-E (185 inches or 4.7 m overall length) would be long in 1:24 scale. 1:24 cars require a course so large as to be impractical for many home enthusiasts, so most serious 1:24 racing is done at commercial or club tracks.
* 1:32 scale cars are smaller and more suited to home-sized race courses, but they are also widely raced on commercial tracks, in hobby shops or in clubs. This scale is the most popular in Europe, and is equivalent to the old #1 gauge (or &quot;standard size&quot;) of toy trains. A Jaguar XK-E would be about in 1:32 scale.
* HO-sized cars vary in scale. Because they were marketed as model railroad accessories, the original small slot cars of the early 1960s very roughly approximated either American and European HO scale (1:87) or British OO scale (1:76). As racing in this size evolved, the cars were enlarged to take more powerful motors, and today they are often 1:64 or larger in scale; but they still run on track of approximately the same width, and are generically referred to as HO slot cars. They are usually not accurate scale models, since the proportions of the tiny bodies must often be stretched to accommodate a standard motor and mechanism. The E-Jaguar scales out to long in 1:87 and in 1:64). Although there is HO racing on commercial and shop-tracks, probably most HO racing occurs on home racetracks.

In addition to the major scales, slot cars have been commercially produced in 1:48 scale and 1:43 scale, corresponding to O gauge model trains. 1:48 cars were promoted briefly in the 1960s, and 1:43 slot car sets are generally marketed today (2007) as children&#x27;s toys. So far, there is little organized competition in 1:43, but the scale is gaining some acceptance among adult hobbyists for its affordability and moderate space requirements. The E-Jaguar would be long in 1:43.

== History ==

The first commercial slot cars were made by Lionel and appeared in their catalogues from 1912, drawing power from a toy train rail sunk in a trough or wide slot between the rails. They were surprisingly similar to modern slot cars, but independent speed control was available only as an optional extra. Production was discontinued after 1915. Sporadically over the next forty years, several other electrically powered commercial products came and went. Although a patent was registered as far back as March 1936 for a slot car, until the late 1950s, nearly all powered toy vehicles were guided by raised rails, either at the wheels (railroad-style), or at the lane center, or edge.

By the late 1930s, serious craftsmen/hobbyists were racing relatively large (1:16 to 1:18 scale) model cars, powered by small internal combustion engines, originally with spark-ignition, later with glow plug engines. For guidance, the cars were clamped to a single center rail, or tethered from the center of a circular track, then they were started and let go for timed runs. There was no driver control of either the speed or steering, so &quot;gas car&quot; racing was largely a mechanic&#x27;s hobby. In the 1940s hobbyists in Britain began to experiment with controllable electric cars using handbuilt motors, and in the 1950s using the small model train motors that had become available. In 1954, the Southport Model Engineering Society in the UK was challenged by a patent-holder for using rail-guided gas-car exhibitions to raise funds, so, as a replacement, the members constructed an electric racecourse, a groundbreaking six-lane layout nearly 60 feet long, for 1:32 rail-guided cars, which is widely considered to be the progenitor of electric rail- and slot-racing. In 1955–1956, several clubs in the UK and US, inspired by the Southport layout, were also racing electric cars guided by center rails, and soon after, by slots in the track surface. The term &quot;slot car&quot; was coined to differentiate these from the earlier &quot;rail cars&quot;. As the member-built club layouts proliferated, the relative advantages of rail and slot were debated for several years, but the obtrusive appearance of the rails and their blocking of the car&#x27;s rear wheels when sliding through corners were powerful disadvantages. New clubs increasingly chose the slot system. By 1963, even the pioneer rail-racing clubs had begun to switch to slots.
In 1957, Minimodels converted its Scalex 1:30 (later, 1:32) clockwork racers to electricity, creating the famous Scalextric line of slot-guided models, and Victory Industries introduced the VIP line, both companies eventually using the new plastic-molding technologies to provide controllable slot racers with authentic bodies in 1:32 scale for the mass market. Both lines included versatile sectional track for the home racer - or the home motorist; VIP produced sports cars and accessories slanted toward a &quot;model roadways&quot; theme, while Scalextric more successfully focused on Grand Prix racing.

As Scalextric became an instant hit, American hobbyists and manufacturers were adapting 1:24 car models to slots, and British-American engineer Derek Brand developed a tiny vibrator motor small enough to power model cars roughly in scale with HO and OO electric trains. In 1959, Playcraft division of Mettoy produced these in the UK, and a year later, Aurora Plastics Corp. released HO vibrator sets with huge success in the US. The tiny cars fascinated the public, and their cost and space requirements were better suited to the average consumer than the larger scales. In only a year or two, Scalextric&#x27;s 1:32 cars and Aurora&#x27;s &quot;Model Motoring&quot; HO line had set off the &quot;slot car craze&quot; of the 1960s.
 The slot car craze was largely a US phenomenon, but, commercially, it was a huge one. In 1963, after a million and a half had been produced, Aurora replaced the trouble-prone vibrator cars with an innovative flat-commutator (&quot;pancake&quot;) motor, also created by Brand, and what is probably the best-selling slot car in history, the Aurora Thunderjet-500 was born. Faller produced it for sale in Europe, and competing companies tried in vain to match the speed and reliability of Brand&#x27;s design. The Thunderjets and their improved versions, the AFX, sold in the tens of millions, completely dominating the HO market for almost a decade, until challenged by Tyco cars in the early 1970s.

By the late 1970s the slot car boom was well over, the model train tie-ins and miniature motoring concepts largely forgotten, and the market returned to the more serious racing hobbyist, with local and national racing organizations evolving to set standards and rules for different classes of competition. Technological innovation brought much higher speeds in all scales, with faster motors, better tires, and traction magnets to hold the cars down in curves, though some of the 1960s enthusiasts thought that slot racing had become too specialized for the casual hobbyist, and fondly remembered the more primitive cars of their youth as not as fast, but more fun.

In the 1990s, computer design and methods of printing on 3-D objects helped create much more detailed and authentic models than the simple shapes and rudimentary graphics of the slot car boom. In addition, newly manufactured replicas of Aurora&#x27;s HO slot cars of the 1960s and 1970s appeared on the market and consumers gained the option of racing either the modern high-tech wondercars or the more basic designs of an earlier time. In 2004, the Digital Command Control (DCC) systems, which had revolutionized model railroading in the 1990s, began to appear in 1:32 slot cars, offering the ability to race multiple cars per lane with more realistic passing.

In 2012, Hong Kong Chinese inventor Mak Wing Kwong introduced the &quot;Dynamic Motion Express&quot; slot car system. The DMX track has a series of parallel slots, allowing drivers to choose lanes on the inside, middle, or outside of the raceway, passing or blocking other racers. DMXslot cars have a rotating mechanism underneath each car with four pins that retract and protrude as the driver commands the car to move left or right. The car disengages its pin with one lane’s slot, moves to one side or the other, and reinserts a pin in the new lane’s slot.

== Developments ==

A number of technological developments have been tried over the years to overcome the traditional slot car&#x27;s limitations. Most lasted only a few years, and are now merely historical curiosities.

Around 1962, AMT&#x27;s Turnpike system used multiple electrical pickups within the slot to allow drivers to control, to a limited extent, the steering of special 1:25 cars.

In the late 1960s the Arnold Minimobil system, also marketed as the Matchbox Motorway, used a long hidden coil, powered by track-side motors, to move die-cast or plastic cars down the track via a slot and detachable pin. Cars in different lanes could race, but cars in the same lane moved at the same speed, separated by a fixed distance.

Also in the 1960s Eldon Industries, Inc. produced 1:32 scale slot cars and sets with a lane change system for analogue cars branded Selectronc that used lane change sections with a dedicated lane change controller. The cars and transformer used diodes to separate the control signals from the hand controllers that allowed for both cars to run independently in the same lane.

In the mid and late 1970s several manufacturers including Aurora, Lionel, and Ideal introduced slotless racing systems that theoretically allowed cars to pass one another from the same lane. Most used a system of multiple power rails that allowed one car to speed up momentarily and move to the outside to pass. Though briefly successful as toy products, none of these systems worked well enough to be taken up by serious hobbyists.

In 2004, a number of traditional slot car manufacturers introduced digital control systems, which enable multiple cars to run in the same lane and to change lanes at certain points on the course. Digitally coded signals sent along the power strips allow each car to respond only to its own controller.

In addition, manufacturers have used the slot track system to allow the racing of a variety of unusual things, including motorcycles, boats, airplanes, spacecraft, horses, fictional and cartoon vehicles, snowmobiles, and futuristic railroad trains.

== Tracks ==
The first sectional slot tracks from Scalextric and VIP were molded rubber and folded metal, respectively, but modern slot tracks fall into two main categories: plastic tracks and routed tracks.

Plastic tracks are made from the molded plastic commercial track sections. Sectional track is inexpensive and easy to assemble, and the design of the course can be easily changed. The joints between the sections, however, make a rough running surface, prompting the derisive term &quot;clickety-clack track&quot;. The many electrical connections cause voltage drop and contribute to more frequent electrical problems. For a permanent setup, the joints can be filled and smoothed, and the power rails soldered together or even replaced with continuous strips, but the surface is seldom as smooth as a good routed track.

Routed tracks have the entire racecourse made from one or a few pieces of sheet material (traditionally chipboard or MDF, but sometimes polymer materials) with the guide-slots and the grooves for the power strips cut directly into the base material using a router or CNC machining. This provides a smooth and consistent surface, which is generally preferred for serious competition.

== Electrical equipment ==

Power for most slot car tracks comes from a power pack. Power packs contain a transformer, which reduces high voltage house current to a safe 12 to 20V, depending on car type) and usually a rectifier, which changes AC to DC, for cooler running and simpler motors. High-capacity lead-acid batteries are sometimes used for hobby slot cars. Toy race sets may use dry cell batteries at 3 to 6 volts.

Controllers (&quot;throttles&quot;) vary car speed by modulating the voltage from the power pack. They are usually hand-held and attached by wires to the track. Besides speed control, modern racing controllers usually feature an adjustable &quot;brake&quot;, &quot;coast&quot;, and &quot;dial-out&quot;. Braking works by temporarily connecting the rails together by a switch (or via a resistor for reduced braking); this converts the car&#x27;s motor into a generator, and the magnetic forces that turned the motor are now slowing it down. Coast allows a certain amount of power to continue to the track after the driver has &quot;let-off&quot; (which would otherwise cut all power to the car). A dial-out allows the driver to limit the maximum power that can reach the car.

The early rail-car tracks used telegraph keys, model-train rheostats and other improvised means to control car speed. The first commercial race sets (1957) used handheld controllers with a thumb-button; like the telegraph key, these were either on or off, requiring the driver to &quot;blip&quot; the throttle for intermediate speeds. Later versions had an intermediate speed, and one late version used a buzzer mechanism to provide full-range speed control.

From 1959 to about 1965, most HO slot sets had a table-mounted controller with a miniature steering wheel or simple dial-knob operating a rheostat (variable resistor), which gave precise control throughout the car&#x27;s speed range. This type could be left on a particular speed setting, making it very suitable for model highway layouts, but they were awkward for racing. Around 1960, handheld rheostats began to appear. Most early examples had vertical, thumb-operated plungers with the rheostat in the grip. Aurora had a plunger design in which a stack of carbon/silicon discs replaced the rheostat. Less common styles included a horizontal thumb-plunger and a full-grip squeeze controller. In 1965, Russkit introduced the trigger-operated pistol grip controller. The pistol grip quickly became the standard rheostat-controller style both for race sets and serious hobbyists, and has remained so to the present day. Control is by the index finger, and the heat-generating rheostat is above the grip for comfort and effective ventilation.

For good response, rheostats must be matched to the particular cars involved. To race different classes of cars, several controllers with different resistance ratings are often required. In the 1970s, electronic additions to the rheostat controllers became popular, which allowed them to be tuned to the particular car being raced. Some modern electronic controllers dispense with the rheostat altogether, and can be used for all classes and types of car. Digital slot cars generally use a controller that is trigger operated, though the rheostat housing is replaced by a slim bulge containing the electronics.

On most tracks, a driver will plug or clip his personal controller to his lane&#x27;s &quot;driver&#x27;s station&quot;, which has wired connections to the power source and track rails. Modern controllers usually require three connections - one to the power terminal of the driver&#x27;s station (customarily white), one to the brake terminal (red), and one to the track terminal (black). Conventional slot car tracks are wired in one of two ways: with the power terminal connected to the power source positive and the brake terminal negative (called &quot;positive gate&quot;), or the other way around (&quot;negative gate&quot;). Resistance type controllers can be used with either positive or negative track wiring, most electronic controllers can only be used with one or the other, although a few electronic controllers feature a switch that adapts them for either gate configuration.

==Competition==
Slot car racing ranges from casual get-togethers at home tracks, using whatever cars the host makes available, to very serious competitions in which contestants painstakingly build or modify their own cars for maximum performance and compete in a series of races culminating in national and world championships.

<doc id="748756" wikidata="Q5386958" url="?curid=748756" title="Eric Lerner">
<text>Eric J. Lerner (born May 31, 1947) is an American popular science writer and independent plasma researcher. He wrote the 1991 book &quot;The Big Bang Never Happened&quot;, which advocates Hannes Alfvén&#x27;s plasma cosmology instead of the Big Bang theory. He is founder, president, and chief scientist of LPP Fusion.

==Professional work==

Lerner received a BA in physics from Columbia University and started as a graduate student in physics at the University of Maryland, but left after a year due to his dissatisfaction with the mathematical rather than experimental approach there. He then pursued a career in popular science writing.

Lerner is an active general science writer, estimating that he has had about 600 articles published. He has received journalism awards between 1984 and 1993 from the Aviation Space Writers Association. In 2006 he was a visiting scientist at the European Southern Observatory in Chile.

=== LPP Fusion ===
In 1984, he began studying plasma phenomena and laboratory fusion devices, performing experimental work on a machine called a dense plasma focus (DPF). NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has funded mainstream as well as alternative approaches to fusion, and between 1994 and 2001 NASA provided a grant to Lawrenceville Plasma Physics, the company of which Lerner was the only employee, to explore whether Lerner&#x27;s alternative approach to fusion might be useful to propel spacecraft; a 2007 &quot;New York Times&quot; article noted that Lerner had not received funding from the US Department of Energy. He believes that a dense plasma focus can also be used to produce useful aneutronic fusion energy. Lerner explained his &quot;Focus Fusion&quot; approach in a 2007 Google Tech Talk.

On November 14, 2008, Lerner received funding for continued research, to test the scientific feasibility of Focus Fusion. On January 28, 2011, LPP published preliminary results. In March 2012, the company published a paper saying that it had achieved temperatures of 1.8 billion degrees, beating the old record of 1.1 billion that had survived since 1978. In 2012 the company announced a collaboration with a lab at the Islamic Azad University Central Tehran Branch in Iran. In 2017, Lerner et al. published evidence of confined ion energies in excess of 200 keV, with the best “shot” having a mean ion energy of 240 keV ± 20 keV which was reported as a record for confined fusion plasmas.

In October 2021, the company announced improved results with the latest version of its device, with reduced erosion and higher temperatures, but the prior month, an independent expert stated that they were not close to a commercial fusion reactor with this device.

In March, 2023 Lerner et al. published a paper in a special issue of the Journal of Fusion Energy showing that LPPFusion led all fusion companies in achieving” the highest ratio of fusion energy generation to device energy input (wall-plug efficiency).

==&quot;The Big Bang Never Happened&quot;==

In his book, &quot;The Big Bang Never Happened&quot;, Lerner rejects mainstream Big Bang cosmology, and instead advances a non-standard plasma cosmology originally proposed in the 1960s by Hannes Alfvén, the 1970 Nobel Prize recipient in Physics. The book appeared at a time when results from the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite were of some concern to astrophysicists who expected to see cosmic microwave background anisotropies but instead measured a blackbody spectrum with little variation across the sky. Lerner referred to this as evidence that the Big Bang was a failed paradigm. He also denigrated the observational evidence for dark matter and recounted a well known cosmological feature that superclusters are larger than the largest structures that could have formed through gravitational collapse in the age of the universe.

As an alternative to the Big Bang, Lerner adopted Alfvén&#x27;s model of plasma cosmology that relied on plasma physics to explain most, if not all, cosmological observations by appealing to electromagnetic forces. Adopting an eternal universe, Lerner&#x27;s explanation of cosmological evolution relied on a model of thermodynamics based on the work of the Nobel Chemistry prize winner Ilya Prigogine under which order emerges from chaos. This is in apparent defiance of the second law of thermodynamics. As a way of partially acknowledging this, Lerner asserts that away from equilibrium order can spontaneously form by taking advantage of energy flows, as argued more recently by American astrophysicist Eric Chaisson.

== Criticism ==

Lerner&#x27;s ideas have been rejected by mainstream physicists and cosmologists. In these critiques, critics have explained that, contrary to Lerner&#x27;s assertions, the size of superclusters is a feature limited by subsequent observations to the end of greatness and is consistent with having arisen from a power spectrum of density fluctuations growing from the quantum fluctuations predicted in inflationary models. Anisotropies were discovered in subsequent analysis of both the COBE and BOOMERanG experiments and were more fully characterized by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and Planck.

Physical cosmologists who have commented on the book have generally dismissed it. In particular, American astrophysicist and cosmologist Edward L. Wright criticized Lerner for making errors of fact and interpretation, arguing that:
* Lerner&#x27;s alternative model for Hubble&#x27;s law is dynamically unstable
* the number density of distant radio sources falsifies Lerner&#x27;s explanation for the cosmic microwave background
* Lerner&#x27;s explanation that the helium abundance is due to stellar nucleosynthesis fails because of the small observed abundance of heavier elements
Lerner has disputed Wright&#x27;s critique.

==Activism==
While at Columbia, Lerner participated in the 1965 Selma March and helped organize the 1968 Columbia Student Strike.

In the 1970s, Lerner became involved in the National Caucus of Labor Committees, an offshoot of the Columbia University Students for a Democratic Society. Lerner left the National Caucus in 1978, later stating in a lawsuit that he had resisted pressure from the U.S. Labor Party, an organization led by Lyndon LaRouche, to violate election law by channeling profits of an engineering firm to the organization.

More recently, Lerner sought civil rights protection for immigrants as a member and spokesman for the New Jersey Civil Rights Defense Committee. He participated in the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011.
