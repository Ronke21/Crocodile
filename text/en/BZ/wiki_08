<text>Sea Pictures, Op. 37 is a song cycle by Sir Edward Elgar consisting of five songs written by various poets. It was set for contralto and orchestra, though a distinct version for piano was often performed by Elgar. Many mezzo-sopranos have sung the piece.

The songs are:
* &quot;Sea Slumber Song&quot; by Roden Noel (approximately 4 minutes)
* &quot;In Haven (Capri)&quot; by Caroline Alice Elgar, the composer&#x27;s wife (under 2 minutes)
* &quot;Sabbath Morning at Sea&quot; by Elizabeth Barrett Browning (approximately 4 minutes)
* &quot;Where Corals Lie&quot; by Richard Garnett (approximately 3 minutes)
* &quot;The Swimmer&quot; by Adam Lindsay Gordon (approximately 5 minutes)

Much of the vocal line of the first song, &quot;Sea Slumber Song&quot;, is heard again in other parts of the cycle; most notably, the second stanza is heard again almost in its entirety as part of the finale.

== History ==
Elgar composed the piece on his 1894 Broadwood Square piano while residing at Birchwood Lodge, Great Storridge in Herefordshire. The songs were originally written in high keys for a soprano voice, but transposed to lower keys for the orchestral version, largely at the request of the contralto Clara Butt. The songs were composed in July 1899 (apart from &quot;In Haven (Capri)&quot;, which was a reworking of his 1897 &quot;Love alone will stay&quot;).

The premiere was on 5 October 1899 at the Norfolk and Norwich Festival with Elgar himself conducting and Clara Butt singing, dressed as a mermaid. On 7 October, Clara Butt gave the first London performance at St. James&#x27;s Hall, with Elgar at the piano. Nearly two weeks later, on 20 October, Butt performed it for Queen Victoria at Balmoral.

Until August 1900, Elgar&#x27;s songs had been published by Novello: but Elgar had a disagreement with them, and from then his songs, including &quot;The Pipes of Pan&quot; and &quot;Sea Pictures&quot; were published by Boosey &amp; Hawkes, who bought the copyright for £50, with a small royalty per copy of the songs published separately.

&quot;Sea Pictures&quot; was also published in the following languages:
* German: &quot;See-Bilder&quot; with words by Dr. Wilhelm Henzen
* French: &quot;Marines&quot; with words by George Petilleau.

== Other versions ==
While the cycle is heard most often in its canonical form for contralto and symphony orchestra, it can also be performed as a work for voice and piano, and in recent years some sopranos have taken up the work using Elgar&#x27;s original keys.

In 2010, the British composer Donald Fraser made a version of Sea Pictures for SATB chorus and strings. The first recording of that version was made by the English Chamber Orchestra, Rodolfus Choir and conductor Kenneth Woods in Abbey Road Studios in 2013. Fraser&#x27;s arrangement was hailed by Stephen Johnson in BBC Music Magazine as &quot;beautifully realised, performed with warmth and understanding, and sympathetically recorded.&quot;

Fraser has also made a version of the work for SATB chorus and large symphony orchestra.

<text>Roland Dorgelès (; 15 June 1885 – 18 March 1973) was a French novelist and a member of the Académie Goncourt.

Born in Amiens, Somme, under the name Roland Lecavelé (he adopted the pen name Dorgelès to commemorate visits to the spa town of Argelès), he spent his childhood in Paris.

A prolific author, he is most renowned for the Prix Femina-winning &quot;Wooden crosses&quot; (), a moving study of World War I, in which he served. It was published in 1919 (in English by William Heinemann in 1920).

Dorgelès served as a juror with Florence Meyer Blumenthal in awarding the Prix Blumenthal, a grant given between 1919 and 1954 to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers and musicians.

<text>Claude (Claudius) Honoré Désiré Dornier (14 May 1884 – 5 December 1969) was a German-French airplane designer and founder of Dornier GmbH. His notable designs include the 12-engine Dornier Do X flying boat, for decades the world&#x27;s largest and most powerful airplane. He also made several other successful aircraft.

==Biography==
The son of a French wine importer and his German wife, Claude Dornier was born in Kempten im Allgäu in Bavaria where he grew up and attended school, with science being his chief interest. Dornier then moved to Munich, where he graduated in 1907 from the Technical University.

As a young engineer, Dornier first worked on strength calculations at the Nagel Engineering Works in Karlsruhe. In 1910 he joined Luftschiffbau Zeppelin in Friedrichshafen on the Bodensee, where his abilities quickly attracted Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin&#x27;s attention. Soon appointed as the Count&#x27;s personal scientific advisor, Dornier began working on improving the strength of light metal sections, and later on aircraft engineering and giant metal flying boats and was responsible for the development of the first stressed skin all-metal monocoque aircraft designs, including the Zeppelin-Lindau D.I, which was the first such aircraft to enter production.

After political pressure he joined the Nazi Party in 1940 and during the Second World War his company created many aircraft for the German armed forces. After the war during the denazification of Germany, Claude Dornier was classified as a &quot;Follower&quot; (Group IV).

Dornier received the Ludwig-Prandtl-Ring from the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics) for &quot;outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering&quot; in 1959.

His son, , was also an aircraft designer.

In 1987 Dornier was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

Thomas Wilson Dorr was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the son of Sullivan and Lydia (Allen) Dorr. His father was a prosperous manufacturer and co-owner of Bernon Mill Village. Dorr&#x27;s family occupied a good social position. He had sisters and other siblings.

As a boy, he attended Phillips Exeter Academy. After graduating from Harvard College in 1823, he went to New York City, where he studied law under Chancellor James Kent and Vice-Chancellor William McCoun. He was admitted to the bar in 1827 and returned to Providence to practice.

Thomas Dorr never married, but two of his sisters wed prominent men. One of his nephews married a daughter of John Lothrop Motley.

== Background ==
Dorr began his political career when elected as a representative in the Rhode Island General Assembly in 1834. He became concerned about issues of the franchise: white men who were not allowed to vote because they did not own a certain value of real estate, and the dominance of rural interests in the state legislature, where seats were apportioned by geographic jurisdictions, with all towns being treated as equal.

In the half-century following the American Revolution, some activists worked to expand the franchise, often by reducing property or similar requirements. In Rhode Island, such attempts were made at intervals from 1797 to 1834 but had invariably been obstructed by the state government. In 1834 a convention met at the capital of Providence to consider the matter again. Dorr was a member of the committee which drew up an address to the people. All efforts at reform, however, were blocked again by the legislature, dominated by rural interests. Its apportionment resulted in an under-representation of the growing urban populations in the industrializing cities.

By 1841 Rhode Island was almost the only state that had not adopted universal suffrage for white males. It was the only state that did not adopt a new written constitution after the Revolution. It relied on its original 17th-century colonial charter. Under that document, the original grantees had had the sole right to decide who should have a voice in the management of public affairs. As was customary at the time, they had decreed that land ownership, specifically of &quot;a moderate landed estate&quot;, was required to vote.

By 1840 this requirement resulted in more than half the adult white male population being excluded from voting. Apportionment by geographic towns resulted in 19 seats, more than half of the legislature, being held by towns that had a total population of only 3,500 voters, when the state had a total of 108,000 residents, with many of them living in the larger cities.

Moreover, no person who did not own real estate could bring suit for recovery of debt or obtain redress for personal injury unless a freeholder endorsed his writ. Many residents had become landless with the onset of the Industrial Revolution, and the number of residents who did not own real estate was increasing with a wave of immigration from Ireland.

== Suffrage referendum ==

In 1840 the Rhode Island Suffrage Association was formed to address this increasingly unsatisfactory situation, and processions and popular meetings were held. State legislator Thomas Wilson Dorr took a leading part in the agitation.

The legislature refused to remedy the grievances, and the old charter did not provide any means for citizens to convene a constitutional convention. A &quot;People&#x27;s Party&quot;, therefore, was formed, which held a convention, adopted a constitution, and submitted it to a vote of the people. Approximately 14,000 ballots were cast in favor of it, and less than 100 cast against it. Of those in favor, more than 4,900 were qualified voters. The proposed state constitution was formally approved not only by the majority of the males over twenty-one but apparently by a majority of the voters considered legal under the charter.

The existing state government refused to consider any of these acts as legal.

=== Constitutional Convention called ===
The legislature called a constitutional convention itself and submitted a new constitution to the people. The government&#x27;s constitution was defeated by the narrow margin of 676 votes out of 16,702. This new constitution provided for most of what Dorr and his followers had been seeking, and historians believe their rejection of it was a tactical error. Feelings had become very bitter, and the Dorrites had already put their constitution into effect by electing an entire state ticket, with Dorr as governor.

== Governor Thomas Wilson Dorr ==
In May 1842 two governments in Rhode Island had held elections and were claiming the allegiance of the people. The People&#x27;s Party did not attempt to seize the state house or machinery of government. Both governors issued proclamations, and Governor Samuel Ward King of the &quot;Law and Order&quot; party appealed to Washington, DC for Federal aid. Dorr went to Washington to plead his own cause before President John Tyler. There he received no encouragement, and he returned to Rhode Island.

=== Governor in exile ===
Meanwhile, King had proclaimed martial law, offered a US$5,000 reward for the capture of Dorr, and made wholesale imprisonments of the latter&#x27;s followers under the &quot;Algerine Law&quot;. Many of Dorr&#x27;s followers deserted him and he fled the state on May 18, 1842. A bungled attack on the Providence arsenal (which his father and younger brother, partisans of the &quot;Law and Order&quot; faction, were helping defend) led to the rebellion&#x27;s disintegration.
Dorr returned briefly in June with a small band of New York volunteers and assembled an armed force of his followers on Acote&#x27;s Hill in Chepachet. The governor ordered the state militia out, which marched on Chepachet. Realizing that they would be defeated if they engaged the militia, Dorr&#x27;s followers dispersed. Dorr sought refuge in New Hampshire and Massachusetts.

== Aftermath ==
Dorr returned to Providence in October 1843, when he hoped the more liberal constitution that had been adopted would protect him, but he was arrested. King and the old government sought their revenge. Dorr was tried for treason against Rhode Island at Newport, a conservative stronghold, before the Rhode Island Supreme Court; he was convicted and sentenced to solitary confinement at hard labor for life. He was committed on June 27, 1844.

The public was outraged about this sentence, and in 1845 the legislature passed an Act of General Amnesty; Dorr was released after serving twelve months of his term. In 1851 his civil rights were restored. In January 1854 the legislature passed an act annulling the verdict of the supreme court, but the state court ruled this act was unconstitutional. Dorr&#x27;s health had been broken by his ordeal, and after his release he lived in retirement until his death.

His work, however, bore fruit: in 1843 a third constitution had been drafted and ratified by the people that provided universal male suffrage. Today, Rhode Island&#x27;s state government recognizes the legitimacy of Dorr&#x27;s efforts and includes Dorr in its list of governors.

<doc id="727271" wikidata="Q1512293" url="?curid=727271" title="Pentagonal hexecontahedron">
<text>In geometry, a pentagonal hexecontahedron is a Catalan solid, dual of the snub dodecahedron. It has two distinct forms, which are mirror images (or &quot;enantiomorphs&quot;) of each other. It has 92 vertices that span 60 pentagonal faces. It is the Catalan solid with the most vertices. Among the Catalan and Archimedean solids, it has the second largest number of vertices, after the truncated icosidodecahedron, which has 120 vertices.

== Properties ==

The faces are irregular pentagons with two long edges and three short edges. Let formula_1 be the real zero of the polynomial formula_2.
Then the ratio formula_3 of the edge lengths is given by:
formula_4. 
The faces have four equal obtuse angles and one acute angle (between the two long edges). The obtuse angles equal formula_5, and the acute one equals formula_6. The dihedral angle equals formula_7.

Note that the face centers of the snub dodecahedron cannot serve directly as vertices of the pentagonal hexecontahedron: the four triangle centers lie in one plane but the pentagon center does not; it needs to be radially pushed out to make it coplanar with the triangle centers. Consequently, the vertices of the pentagonal hexecontahedron do not all lie on the same sphere and by definition it is not a zonohedron.

To find the volume and surface area of a pentagonal hexecontahedron, denote the shorter side of one of the pentagonal faces as formula_8, and set a constant &quot;t&quot;
formula_9

Then the surface area (formula_10) is:
formula_11.

And the volume (formula_12) is:
formula_13.

Using these, one can calculate the measure of sphericity for this shape:
formula_14

== Construction ==
The pentagonal hexecontahedron can be constructed from a snub dodecahedron without taking the dual. Pentagonal pyramids are added to the 12 pentagonal faces of the snub dodecahedron, and triangular pyramids are added to the 20 triangular faces that do not share an edge with a pentagon. The pyramid heights are adjusted to make them coplanar with the other 60 triangular faces of the snub dodecahedron. The result is the pentagonal hexecontahedron.

An alternate construction method uses quaternions and the icosahedral symmetry of the Weyl group orbits formula_15 of order 60. This is shown in the figure on the right.

Specifically, with quaternions from the binary Icosahedral group formula_16, where formula_17 is the conjugate of formula_18 and formula_19 and formula_20, then just as the Coxeter group formula_21 is the symmetry group of the 600-cell and the 120-cell of order 14400, we have formula_22 of order 120. formula_23 is defined as the even permutations of formula_24 such that formula_25 gives the 60 twisted chiral snub dodecahedron coordinates, where formula_26 is one permutation from the first set of 12 in those listed above. The exact coordinate for formula_27 is obtained by taking the solution to formula_28, with formula_29, and applying it to the normalization of formula_30.

=== Cartesian coordinates ===
Using the Icosahedral symmetry in the orbits of the Weyl group formula_31of order 60 gives the following Cartesian coordinates with formula_32 is the golden ratio:

* Twelve vertices of a regular icosahedron with unit circumradius centered at the origin with the coordinates formula_33
* Twenty vertices of regular dodecahedron of unit circumradius centered at the origin scaled by a factorformula_34 from the exact solution to the equation formula_35, which gives the coordinates 
formula_36 and formula_37
* Sixty vertices of a unit circumradius chiral snub dodecahedron scaled by formula_38. There are five sets of twelve vertices, all with even permutations (i.e. with a parity signature=1). 
A group of two sets of twelve have 0 or 2 minus signs (i.e. 1 or 3 plus signs): 
formula_39
formula_40
and another group of three sets of 12 have 0 or 2 plus signs (i.e. 1 or 3 minus signs):formula_41 
formula_42
formula_43
Negating all vertices in both groups gives the mirror of the chiral snub dodecahedron, yet results in the same pentagonal hexecontahedron convex hull.

== Variations==
Isohedral variations can be constructed with pentagonal faces with 3 edge lengths.

This variation shown can be constructed by adding pyramids to 12 pentagonal faces and 20 triangular faces of a snub dodecahedron such that the new triangular faces are coparallel to other triangles and can be merged into the pentagon faces.
==Orthogonal projections==
The &quot;pentagonal hexecontahedron&quot; has three symmetry positions, two on vertices, and one mid-edge.
==Related polyhedra and tilings==

This polyhedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of polyhedra and tilings of pentagons with face configurations (V3.3.3.3.&quot;n&quot;). (The sequence progresses into tilings the hyperbolic plane to any &quot;n&quot;.) These face-transitive figures have (n32) rotational symmetry.

<text>John Thompson Dorrance (November 11, 1873 – September 21, 1930) was an American chemist who discovered a method to create condensed soup, and was president of the Campbell Soup Company from 1914 to 1930.

==Early life==
Born in Bristol, Pennsylvania, he earned a bachelor of science degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and a doctor of philosophy from the University of Göttingen in Germany. He turned down offers to join the faculty at Cornell University and Columbia University to pursue work with his uncle.

==Career==
A nephew of the general manager of the Joseph Campbell Preserve Company, he went to work there in 1897 and invented condensed soup.

Dorrance went on to become the president of Campbell Soup Company from 1914 to 1930, eventually buying out the Campbell family. He turned the business into one of America&#x27;s longest-lasting brands. He was succeeded by his brother, Arthur Dorrance.

==Personal life==
In 1906 he married Ethel Mallinckrodt, with whom he had five children.

==Death==
Dorrance died on September 21, 1930, of heart disease at his home in Cinnaminson Township, New Jersey. He was buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. His estate in Radnor Township, Pennsylvania is now the home of Cabrini University.

Following Dorrance&#x27;s death, there was significant litigation over his domicile for purposes of estate and inheritance tax. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that he was domiciled in Pennsylvania, and the Supreme Court of New Jersey held that he was domiciled in New Jersey, and his estate was required to pay estate tax to both states. The estate sought relief in the United States Supreme Court, but the request for review was denied.

==Legacy==
In 2012, Dorrance was elected into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

<text>The Freestylers are a British electronic music group, consisting of producers Matt Cantor and Aston Harvey. They have released five studio albums and a number of mix compilations for, among others, Fabric and BBC Radio.

The group took their name from their first sample &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Rock&quot; by Freestyle, which they also sampled on Drop the Boom.

==Career==
===Formation–Raw as Fuck album (1996–2004)===
The Freestylers formed in 1996 when DJs and dance music producers Matt Cantor and Aston Harvey joined forces. Both Cantor and Aston had been involved in the British dance music scene since the early 1990s. Cantor had recorded both as Cut &amp; Paste and Strike with Andy Gardner (Plump DJs). Aston Harvey recorded as Blapps! Posse, best known for their 1990 breakbeat dance hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Hold Back&quot;, before working with Definition of Sound, Rebel MC and DJ Rap (as DJ Rap and Aston).

The trio&#x27;s first single, &quot;Drop the Boom (AK-48)&quot;, on their own Scratch City Records in 1996 became a dancefloor hit in the UK and Miami. The band released the &quot;Freestyle EP&quot; in 1996 on Freskanova (Freskanova&#x27;s parent label, &quot;Fresh&quot;, had released Cantor and Harvey&#x27;s previous works). When playing live, the group consisted of Cantor and Harvey on keyboards and programming, turntablist Jason Tunbridge (Mad Doctor X), guitarist (Tony Ayiotou), drummer Clive Jenner, bass guitarist Joe Henson, MC Navigator and Tenor Fly and three breakdancers (Coza, Marat, Lil&#x27;Tim).

The band released their first album, &quot;We Rock Hard&quot;, in 1998. The single &quot;B-Boy Stance&quot; became a hit in the UK in 1998, featuring the contributions of rapper Tenor Fly. In 1999, the Freestylers enjoyed success in the U.S. with the track &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, which reached number 8 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance charts, and the video for &quot;Here We Go&quot; becoming a hit on a MTV. &quot;We Rock Hard&quot; sold well in the US, selling over 150,000 copies and reaching the top 30 on the Billboard &quot;Heatseekers&quot; chart.

Following the success of &quot;B-Boy Stance&quot;, the band were asked to remix tracks by Audioweb, Afrika Bambaataa and the Jungle Brothers as well as a big beat compilation album &quot;FSUK 2&quot; and a Radio 1 Essential Mix featuring Beenie Man, Public Enemy, Whodini and The Fall.

The Freestylers released a mix album, &quot;Electro Science&quot;, in 2000. Their second album, &quot;Pressure Point&quot;, was released in 2001 with the track &quot;Get Down Massive (featuring Navigator)&quot; reaching number 16 on the Billboard dance charts in 2002.

During 2002 and 2003, the group began releasing singles under the alias Raw As Fuck, which later became the title of their third studio album. Released in 2004, it featured the single &quot;Push Up&quot;, which reached the top 30 in the UK and the top 3 in Australia. The song &quot;Get A Life&quot;, which was released as the album&#x27;s first single, was re-released and reached the top 20 in Australia.

===Adventures in Freestyle (2006) and current activity===
Released in 2006 album &quot;Adventures in Freestyle&quot; experimented with a variety of styles, and saw the Freestylers working with assorted underground vocalists.

In 2008, the song &quot;Jump &#x27;n&#x27; Twist&quot; from their fourth studio album &quot;Adventures in Freestyle&quot; was featured in the soundtrack for Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2008.

In 2010 the remixes of &quot;Cracks&quot; (originally from the &quot;Past, Present and Future E.P.&quot;) was released through Never Say Die Records. The Flux Pavilion remix received 25 million hits on YouTube.

CTRL-Z, hailing from Hammersmith and individually known as DJ Dash (Tom Petais) &amp; DJ Inch (Nicky D’Silva), have been very involved with The Freestylers&#x27; music. In 2009, their remake of &quot;Ruffneck&quot; (renamed &quot;Ruffneck &#x27;09&quot;) became the first ever release of the Never Say Die Records label. They also remixed &quot;Security&quot; in 2007 and &quot;Cracks&quot; in 2010. CTRL-Z has also co-produced songs with The Freestylers, such as &quot;Turn to Dust&quot; from the &quot;Adventures in Freestyle&quot; album.

In 2012, Freestylers signed with Black Hole Recordings subsidiary Rub-A-Duck Records. Through the label, they have released singles such as &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;Over You&quot;, as well as their latest album &quot;The Coming Storm&quot; in 2013. 2012 also saw new member Chris Bishop (Screwface from Stereo:Type) joining the production team.

<doc id="727290" wikidata="Q48690" url="?curid=727290" title="Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado">
<text>Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado (17 April 1919 – 23 June 1983) was a Cuban politician who served as the president of Cuba from 1959 to 1976. He was a close ally of Cuban revolutionary and longtime leader Fidel Castro.

==Background==
Dorticós was born to a wealthy family in Cienfuegos, Las Villas Province, on 17 April 1919. His father was both a lawyer and a physician, and one of his ancestors was Tomas Terry, a Venezuelan-born entrepreneur of paternal Irish descent who amassed one of the largest fortunes in the Western Hemisphere ($25 million at the time of his death in 1886), who established the Thomas Terry Theatre in Cienfuegos. After working briefly as a teacher, Dorticós studied law and philosophy at the University of Havana, graduating with a law degree in 1941. He joined the Communist-controlled Popular Socialist Party, and acted for a time as secretary to Juan Marinello, the party&#x27;s leader.

In the 1950s, Dorticós established a prosperous law practice in Cienfuegos, and served as Commodore of the Cienfuegos Yacht Club. He strongly opposed the government of Fulgencio Batista, and participated in the Civil Resistance Movement, supplying the rebel forces with arms and supplies. Dorticós was elected dean of the Havana Bar Association in 1958 prior to being arrested by the Batista regime in the same year and being briefly exiled to Mexico.

==Roles in government==
After the success of the Revolution on 1 January 1959, Dorticós returned to Cuba and was appointed Minister of Revolutionary Laws in the cabinet headed by Fidel Castro. In that capacity, he played an important role in drafting revolutionary legislation such as the Agrarian Reform Act and the Fundamental Organic Law that supplanted the Constitution of 1940. After the resignation of President Manuel Urrutia, Dorticós was appointed President of Cuba by the Council of Ministers on 17 July 1959. 

As President, Dorticós represented Cuba at the 1st Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade, SFR Yugoslavia (1961), and at the Summit of the Organisation of American States in Punta del Este, Uruguay (1962). During the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, Dorticós gave a speech at the United Nations in which he announced that Cuba possessed nuclear weapons, which it hoped would never be used. In 1964 he participated in the 2nd Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Cairo. He was present at the inauguration of Peronist President Héctor Cámpora on 25 May 1973, in Buenos Aires, along with Chilean President Salvador Allende.

In addition to being Cuba&#x27;s President, Dorticós served as a member of the of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba (from 1965); and as president of the Central Planning Council (from 1964). For the most part, Dorticós was a figurehead, with most of the real power held by Prime Minister Fidel Castro.

A new constitution enacted in 1976 merged the posts of president and prime minister. Castro became president, and Dorticós was named President of the National Bank and a member of the Council of State.

== Death ==
Dorticós shot himself on 23 June 1983. His suicide was apparently brought on by the death of his wife, as well as chronic spinal disease.

<doc id="727293" wikidata="Q2411835" url="?curid=727293" title="The Hacker's Diet">
<text>The Hacker&#x27;s Diet (humorously subtitled &quot;How to lose weight and hair through stress and poor nutrition&quot;) is a diet plan created by the founder of Autodesk, John Walker, outlined in an electronic book of the same name, that attempts to aid the process of weight loss by more accurately modeling how calories consumed and calories expended actually impact weight. Walker notes that much of our fat free mass introduces signal noise when trying to determine how much weight we&#x27;re actually losing or gaining. With the help of a graphing tool (Excel is used in the book), he addresses these problems. Factoring in exercise, and through counting calories, one can calculate one&#x27;s own total energy expenditure (basal metabolic rate, thermic effect of food, and day-to-day exercise) and cut back calorie intake or increase exercise to lose weight.

== Dieting as an engineering problem ==
Walker describes the diet as approaching weight loss &quot;as an engineering problem&quot;, claiming that his approach enabled him to reduce his weight from 98 kg to 66 kg in a year and keep it stable afterwards.

Walker considers the problem of weight loss and maintenance as a control system problem. Simplifying the problem to the barest elements, he models the human body as a &quot;rubber bag,&quot; where variables such as food type, frequency, metabolic rates and even exercise are considered negligible. According to Walker, the difference between calorie intake and expenditure is the key (a calorie surplus leads to weight gain; a calorie deficit leads to weight loss). To solve the problem, one needs to monitor calorie intake and weight loss rate and make the desired proportional adjustments to reach the desired goal.

== The body as a system ==

Walker also introduces the reader at some length to simple feedback and control systems, providing spreadsheets to demonstrate feedback, oscillation and data smoothing to illustrate his arguments. While the diet is a fairly straightforward calorie-counting approach, data smoothing (exponential moving averages in particular) is considered a key element of the monitoring system. Walker presents techniques for Excel-aided or paper-and-pencil data smoothing to allow the dieter to adjust the diet for themselves using the long-term trend and to not be discouraged by short-term fluctuations based on water retention or other factors.

The diet also uses the trend line as a control system to allow the dieter early warning of relapse after the target weight is reached. As Walker states, &quot;The vast majority of people who lose weight end up, in relatively short order, gaining back every pound they lost.&quot; A quick check of the trend line provides an easy way to make small adjustments in intake, allowing much greater control of weight for life.

== Tools ==

Walker uses Excel spreadsheets to log weight and produce charts but provides a list of other software packages that may be used. Walker also provides a free online tracker and grapher at his Fourmilab website, and the program Eat Watch, mobile tracking and charting services for the Palm platform.

<text>The 2004 Irish local elections were held in all the counties, cities and towns of Ireland on Friday, 11 June 2004, on the same day as the European elections and referendum on the amending the constitutional provisions on citizenship. Polling was delayed until 19 June 2004 in County Roscommon, due to the sudden death of Councillor Gerry Donnelly.

Turnout was the highest for 20 years at around 60%, helped by the extra publicity of the referendum. The result was a setback for Fianna Fáil, which saw its share of the vote drop by 7 percentage points from its 1999 result to 32%, losing 20% of its council seats. The party lost its majority on Clare County Council for the first time in 70 years, and fell behind Fine Gael in Galway, Limerick and Waterford city councils. Labour&#x27;s share of the vote remained static at 11% while Fine Gael dropped 1%. However, both parties gained seats with the Labour Party becoming the largest party on Dublin City Council. Major gains were made by Sinn Féin which managed to double the number of seats it held, mainly at the expense of Fianna Fáil.

These were the first elections since the Local Government Act 2001 modernised council structures and abolished the dual mandate. Many new councillors were elected for the first time, including 33 of the 52 of the councillors on Dublin City Council, which the city manager described as &quot;unprecedented in the history of local government&quot;. Many of the seats vacated by TDs and senators were won by family members.

== Results ==
Voters received different-coloured ballot papers for the European election, city/county council election, and referendum, all of which went into the same ballot box and were separated by colour once the boxes arrived at the count centre for the city/county. According to the different franchises in Irish law, all residents were eligible to vote in the local elections, all EU citizens were eligible to vote in the European elections, and the referendum was confined to Irish citizens. Voters in towns with town councils received an additional ballot for that election, cast in a separate ballot box and counted locally within the town.

<doc id="727304" wikidata="Q720355" url="?curid=727304" title="Frank Nelson Doubleday">
<text>Frank Nelson Doubleday (January 8, 1862 – January 30, 1934), known to friends and family as &quot;Effendi&quot; (phonetic &quot;F.N.D.&quot;), founded the Doubleday &amp; McClure Company in 1897, which later operated under other names. Starting work at the age of 14 after his father&#x27;s business failed, Doubleday began with Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons in New York.

His son Nelson Doubleday, son-in-law John Turner Sargent, Sr. and grandson Nelson Doubleday, Jr. all worked in the company and led it through different periods. In 1986, after years of changes in the publishing business, his grandson Nelson Doubleday, Jr. as president sold the Doubleday Company to the German group Bertelsmann.

==Early life==
He was born on January 8, 1862, in Brooklyn, to William Edwards and Ellen M. Dickinson Doubleday.

His father was a hatter. Frank Doubleday&#x27;s ancestors came to Boston in the early 17th century. Early in life, he became fascinated with the printing business. By age 10, he had saved up enough money to buy his own printing press. He earned back the cost by printing advertising and news circulars for local businesses, and from that point never left the business. Frank&#x27;s distant relative Ulysses F. Doubleday was a book publisher earlier in the 19th century. When Doubleday was 14, his father&#x27;s business failed. The youth had to leave school and find a full-time job.

==Career==
He went to work at the firm of Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons in Manhattan in 1877 for the salary of $3 a week. Doubleday worked 18 years at Scribner&#x27;s, eventually rising to become the publisher of &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and head of Scribner&#x27;s subscription book department. When his relationship with Scribner&#x27;s soured, Doubleday left the company to go into partnership with Samuel S. McClure, publisher of &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine.&quot;

They formed the Doubleday &amp; McClure Co. in March 1897. The following year, Doubleday and McClure accepted a contract to manage the great publishing house of Harper &amp; Brothers, at the instigation of their banker, J. Pierpont Morgan. On taking control, Doubleday dug thoroughly through Harper&#x27;s books and decided that the company&#x27;s finances were in a shambles; he convinced McClure and Morgan to call off the deal. (Harper had gone heavily into debt in the Panic of 1893, and the extension of copyright to foreign authors in 1891 put a large dent in Harper&#x27;s principal business, the cheap domestic reprints of respected foreign authors.)

On December 31, 1899, growing tension between Doubleday and McClure led the two men to dissolve their partnership. The following year, Doubleday invited Walter Hines Page, former editor of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, to join him; the new firm was Doubleday, Page &amp; Co.

In 1921, Doubleday bought a controlling interest in the English publisher William Heinemann, after Heinemann died unexpectedly without leaving an heir. In 1927, Doubleday purchased the publishing house of George H. Doran, and his company became Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co.

An anglophile, Frank Doubleday spent many working vacations in England exploring authors and publishers for U.S. editions. His personal friends included James Barrie, Andrew Carnegie, Alfred Harcourt, Edward Mandell House, Rudyard Kipling, T. E. Lawrence, Christopher Morley, Mark Twain. Through a cousin, he met John D. Rockefeller and either edited or ghost-wrote Rockefeller&#x27;s autobiography.

Doubleday&#x27;s nickname &quot;Effendi&quot; was coined by Kipling, derived from the initials F.N.D.

==Marriage and family==
Doubleday married Neltje De Graff (1865-1918) on June 9, 1886, who published several books on gardens and birds. They adopted a boy Felix Doty, then had a son, Nelson, and daughter, Dorothy, together. Nelson Doubleday followed his father into the publishing business and served for years as president of the company, to be followed in 1978 by his own son, Nelson Doubleday, Jr. Neltje died in 1918 in Canton, China while taking working as the Commissioner for the Red Cross. After her death, Doubleday married Florence Van Wyck later that year.

<text>The Eburonian ( or &quot;Eburonium&quot;), or, much less commonly, the Eburonian Stage, is a glacial complex in the Calabrian age of the Pleistocene epoch and lies between the Tegelen and the Waalian interglacial. The transition from the Tegelen to the Eburonian started about 1.78 million years ago, lasted 480,000 years (to 1.3 million years ago). In geologic strata, at its base, from its startpoint, the Neogene underlies different Gelasian deposits starkly in much of the Netherlands.

== Discovery ==
As early as the 1920s, the names of the three well known glaciations - the Elster, the Saale and the Weichselian - had become established at the recommendation of Konrad Keilhack and Paul Woldstedt. 
After Penck &amp; Brückner successfully identified a fourth glaciation in the Alps, there were many attempts to find traces of this ice age in the northern Central Europe.
Investigations in the Netherlands, into both sedimentology and vegetation, revealed that the number of cold and warm periods must have been considerably greater. In 
1957 Zagwijn expanded the hitherto known glacials and interglacials (the Weichselian, Eemian, Saalian, Holstein, Elster and Cromer) by the Menapian glacial, Waalian interglacial, Eburonian glacial, Tegelen interglacial and Pre-Tegelen glacial. After the initial view that there had been continuous warm or cold periods, it quickly became clear that we were looking at &quot;complexes&quot; that included both warm and cold periods. The Eburonian was subdivided into four cold periods, each separated from one another by warmer periods.

== Climate &amp; vegetation ==
Very little is known about the development of the climate and vegetation during the Eburonian. The cold period is subdivided into 7 climatic sections, which differ in their average temperatures. As in the cold periods of the Menapian glacial and the Tegelen interglacial, the average temperature of the Eburonian in summer was about ca. 10 °C and the average annual temperature was -6 to -4 °C. During the warmer sections of the Eburonian, the land was covered by cool coniferous forests; during the cold periods the vegetation was open and treeless.

<doc id="727312" wikidata="Q7290270" url="?curid=727312" title="Ramsgate tug">
<text>The Ramsgate tugs were a series of tugboats used at Ramsgate harbour since the 19th century. The harbour&#x27;s development coincided with the growing use of the steam tugs that were then being built for the shipping industry. 

During this era a considerable amount of the work undertaken by the local boatmen was carried out by these tugs. The benefits of this in regard to the heavier ships in distress was inestimable, but nevertheless the salvage of wrecks soon became an intense and contested undertaking, offering substantial monetary rewards to the boatmen and the tugmen, who were otherwise ill-paid. 

Ramsgate&#x27;s tugs became a regular feature in the harbour; unlike the lifeboats they were able haul ships out into open waters against an unfavourable wind or in dead calm conditions. In the 19th century the tugs were kept with &quot;crew on board and steam up, ready to put to sea at a moment&#x27;s notice&quot;.

The first Ramsgate tug, built of wood and measuring 90 tons (91 t), with a engine, was built at South Shields by Woodhouse in 1843, and named the &quot;Samson&quot;.

The &quot;Samson&quot; and her successors—&quot;Aide&quot;, a wooden paddle steamer of 112 gross tons (114 t) built at Blackwall on the Thames and in use by 1855, &quot;Vulcan&quot;, an iron steam paddle tug of 140 tons (142 t), also built at Blackwall and delivered to Ramsgate in 1858, and &quot;Fabia&quot;, which was in service in World War II—participated in many rescues alongside the local lifeboatmen, receiving several rewards from the RNLI and grateful foreign governments. Another Ramsgate tug was &quot;Sun Swale&quot;.

In January 1881 the Ramsgate tugs &quot;Vulcan&quot; and &quot;Aide&quot; participated with the lifeboat &quot;Bradford&quot; in the rescue of the &quot;Indian Chief&quot;, in response to which the Ramsgate harbour-master, Captain Braine, wrote the commendation, &quot;Of all the meritorious services performed by the Ramsgate Tug and Life-boat, I consider this one of the best. The decision the coxswain and crew arrived at to remain till daylight, which was in effect to continue for fourteen hours cruising about with the sea continually breaking over them in a heavy gale and tremendous sea, proves, I consider, their gallantry and determination to do their duty.&quot;

==Cultural references==
In Wilkie Collins&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fallen Leaves&quot; a Broadstairs boatman laments that the advent of the Ramsgate tug destroyed the rich pickings to be made by salvaging cargo from wrecks on the Goodwin Sands.

William Broome painted two pictures featuring the Ramsgate tugs: &quot;The Ramsgate pulling and sailing lifeboat being towed by the tug &#x27;Aide&#x27; through the harbour entrance in a fierce storm, going to the rescue of the &#x27;Indian Chief&#x27; on the Goodwin Sands&quot;, held by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution Heritage Trust, and &quot;The tug &#x27;Vulcan&#x27; towing a stricken vessel into Ramsgate with a lifeboat&quot;, held by the Maritime Museum in Ramsgate. Thomas H. Willoughby Beddowes painted &quot;&#x27;And waited for dawn&#x27;; the Ramsgate lifeboat &#x27;Bradford and the tug &#x27;Vulcan&#x27; going to the rescue of the &#x27;Indian Chief&#x27; off Long Sands&quot;, in the Royal National Lifeboat Institution Heritage Trust collection. George Mears painted &quot;The tug &#x27;Vulcan&#x27; with the Ramsgate pulling and sailing lifeboat going to the wreck of the &#x27;Indian Chief&#x27;&quot; and &quot;The return of the tug &#x27;Vulcan&#x27; with the Ramsgate pulling and sailing lifeboat, returning to harbour with the rescued crew from the &#x27;Indian Chief&#x27;&quot; both with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution Heritage Trust.

<text>Charles Montagu Doughty (19 August 1843 – 20 January 1926) was an English poet, writer, explorer, adventurer and traveller, best known for his two-volume 1888 travel book &quot;Travels in Arabia Deserta&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Son of Rev. Charles Montagu Doughty, of Theberton Hall near Saxmundham, Suffolk, and Frederica Beaumont Hotham, daughter of Rev. the Hon. Frederick Hotham, of Dennington, Suffolk (son of the judge and politician Beaumont Hotham, 2nd Baron Hotham), Doughty was born at Theberton Hall and educated at private schools in Laleham and Elstree and at a school for the Royal Navy, Portsmouth. He was a student at King&#x27;s College School, Wimbledon, and went up to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, migrating to Downing College, Cambridge, from which he took a BA in 1866, then taking an MA from Caius in 1869.

==Career==
Doughty is best known for his 1888 travel book &quot;Travels in Arabia Deserta&quot;, a work in two volumes that, although it had little immediate influence upon its publication, slowly became a kind of touchstone of ambitious travel writing, one valued as much for its language as for its content. T. E. Lawrence rediscovered the book and caused it to be republished in the 1920s, contributing an admiring introduction of his own. Since then, the book has gone in and out of print. The book is a vast recounting of Doughty&#x27;s treks through the Arabian deserts, and his discoveries there. It is written in an extravagant and mannered style that has been compared to the King James Bible, but whose mixture of Elizabethanisms and Victorianisms received some criticism. Among authors who have praised the book are the British novelist Henry Green, whose essay on Doughty, &quot;Apologia,&quot; is reprinted in his collection &quot;Surviving&quot;. Green&#x27;s novels arguably show some direct stylistic influence of Doughty&#x27;s book, as noted by John Updike in his introduction to the collection of Green&#x27;s novels &quot;Loving; Living; Party Going&quot;.

Doughty&#x27;s epic poem &quot;The Dawn in Britain&quot;, originally published 1906 in six volumes, provides a preparatory basis and ideal for Laura (Riding) Jackson and Schuyler B. Jackson&#x27;s project of establishing an access to what they argue is an inherent meaning of words in their &quot;Rational Meaning: a New Foundation for the Definition of Words and Supplementary Essays&quot;. The Jacksons hail Doughty&#x27;s work as being exemplary of this access to meaning through the linguistic understanding he demonstrates in his diction, in the care he takes with his choice of words, which prefers pre-Shakespearean English for reasons &quot;fundamentally linguistic, rather than literary.&quot; Whole sections of the Jacksons&#x27; book examine Doughty&#x27;s linguistic care and thinking.

He was awarded the 1912 Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s Founder&#x27;s Medal for his travels and writings.

Edward Said characterizes Doughty as significant to the development of late 19th-century Orientalist style. Placing him in a category of Orientalism alongside T. E. Lawrence, Gertrude Bell, David George Hogarth, St John Philby, Mark Sykes, and Sir Ronald Storrs, Said writes: &quot;Each ... believed his vision of things Oriental was individual, self-created out of some intensely personal encounter with the Orient, Islam, or the Arabs; each expressed general contempt for official knowledge held about the East. ... Yet in the final analysis they all ... expressed the traditional Western hostility to and fear of the Orient.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1886, Doughty married Caroline Amelia, daughter of General Sir William Montagu Scott McMurdo. They were parents of Dorothy Susan (1892–1962) and Frederica (&quot;Freda&quot;) Gertrude Doughty (1895–1972), sculptors and potters. Doughty was uncle of Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Doughty-Wylie, VC, CB, CMG and his younger brother, the Naval Rear Admiral Henry Montagu Doughty, CB. 

Doughty was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 25 January 1926 and his ashes placed in Bay 1 of the Cloisters (tablet 2610).

<text>Aaron Douglas (May 26, 1899 – February 2, 1979) was an American painter, illustrator, and visual arts educator. He was a major figure in the Harlem Renaissance. He developed his art career painting murals and creating illustrations that addressed social issues around race and segregation in the United States by utilizing African-centric imagery. Douglas set the stage for young, African-American artists to enter the public-arts realm through his involvement with the Harlem Artists Guild. In 1944, he concluded his art career by founding the Art Department at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. He taught visual art classes at Fisk University until his retirement in 1966. Douglas is known as a prominent leader in modern African-American art whose work influenced artists for years to come.

==Early life==
Aaron Douglas was born and raised in Topeka, Kansas, on May 26, 1899, to Aaron Douglas Sr, a baker from Tennessee, and Elizabeth Douglas, a homemaker and amateur artist from Alabama. His passion for art derived from admiring his mother&#x27;s drawings. He attended Topeka High School, during which he worked for Skinner&#x27;s Nursery and Union Pacific material yard, and graduated in 1917.

After high school, Douglas moved to Detroit, Michigan, and held various jobs, including working as a plasterer and molding sand from automobile radiators for Cadillac. During this time, he went to free classes at the Detroit Museum of Art, before going on to attend college at the University of Nebraska in 1918. While attending college, Douglas worked as a busboy to finance his education. When World War I commenced, Douglas attempted to join the Student Army Training Corps (SATC) at the University of Nebraska, but was dismissed. Historians have speculated that this dismissal was correlated with the racially segregated climate of American society and the military. He then transferred for a short time to the University of Minnesota, where he volunteered for the SATC and attained the rank of corporal. After the signing of the armistice, he returned to the University of Nebraska, where he received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1922.

After graduating, Douglas worked as a waiter for the Union Pacific Railroad until 1923, when he secured a job teaching visual arts at Lincoln High School in Kansas City, Missouri, staying there until 1925. During his time in Kansas City, he exchanged letters with Alta Sawyer, his future wife, about his plans beyond teaching in a high-school setting. He wanted to take his art career to Paris, France, as many of his aspiring artist peers did.

==Career==

=== 1925–27 ===
In 1925, Douglas intended to pass through Harlem, New York, on his way to Paris to advance his art career. He was convinced to stay in Harlem and develop his art during the height of the Harlem Renaissance, influenced by the writings of Alain Locke about the importance of Harlem for aspiring African Americans. While in Harlem, Douglas studied under Winold Reiss, a German portraitist who encouraged him to work with African-centric themes to create a sense of unity between African Americans with art; Douglas was included in Alain Locke&#x27;s 1925 anthology &quot;The New Negro&quot; as Reiss&#x27;s pupil.

Douglas worked with W. E. B. Du Bois, then-editor at &quot;The Crisis&quot;, a monthly journal of the NAACP, and became art editor himself briefly in 1927. Douglas also illustrated for Charles S. Johnson, then-editor at &quot;&quot;, the official publication of the National Urban League. These illustrations focused on articles about lynching and segregation, and theater and jazz. His illustrations also featured in the periodicals &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;Theatre Arts Monthly&quot;. In 1927, Douglas was asked to create the first of his murals at Club Ebony, which highlighted Harlem nightlife.

=== 1928–31 ===
In 1928, Douglas received a one-year Barnes Foundation Fellowship in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where Albert C. Barnes, philanthropist and founder of the Barnes Foundation, supported him in studying the collection of Modernist paintings and African art. During this same year, Douglas participated in the Harmon Foundation&#x27;s exhibition organized by the College Art Association, entitled &quot;Contemporary Negro Art.&quot; In the summer of 1930, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he worked on a series of murals for Fisk University&#x27;s Cravath Hall library that he described as a &quot;panorama of the development of Black people in this hemisphere, in the new world.&quot; While in Nashville, he was commissioned by the Sherman Hotel in Chicago, Illinois, to paint a mural series. In addition, he was commissioned by Bennett College for Women in Greensboro, North Carolina, to create a mural with Harriet Tubman as its primary figure. He then moved in 1931 for one year to Paris, France, where he received training in sculpture and painting at the Académie Scandinave.

=== 1934–36 ===

Douglas returned to Harlem in the mid-1930s to work on his mural painting techniques. Having joined the American Communist Party at some point upon return, he began to explore more political topics within his art as well. In 1934, he was commissioned by New York&#x27;s 135th Street YMCA to paint a mural on their building, as well as by the Public Works Administration to paint his most acclaimed mural cycle, &quot;Aspects of Negro Life,&quot; for the Countee Cullen Branch of New York Public Library. He used these murals to inform his audiences of the place of African Americans throughout America&#x27;s history and its present society. In a series consisting of four murals, Douglas takes his audience from an African setting, to slavery and the Reconstruction era in the United States, then through the threats of lynching and segregation in a post-Civil War America to a final mural depicting the movement of African Americans north towards the Harlem Renaissance and the Great Depression. Douglas created a similar series of murals, which included &quot;Into Bondage&quot; (1936), for the Texas Centennial Exposition in Dallas in 1936.

During the height of his commissioned work as a muralist, Douglas served as president of the Harlem Artists Guild in 1935, an organization designed to create a network of young artists in New York City to provide support, inspiration, and to help out young artists during the Harlem Renaissance.

=== 1937–66 ===
In 1937, the Rosenwald Foundation awarded Douglas a travel fellowship to go to the American South and visit primarily Black universities, including Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, and Dillard University in New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1938, he again received a travel fellowship from the Rosenwald Foundation to go to the Dominican Republic and Haiti to develop a series of watercolors depicting the life of these Caribbean islands.

Upon returning to the United States in 1940, he worked at Fisk University in Nashville, while attending Columbia University Teacher’s College in New York City. He received his Master of Arts degree in 1944, and moved to Nashville, to found and sit as the chairman of the Art Department at Fisk. During his tenure as a professor in the Art Department, he was the founding director of the Carl Van Vechten Gallery of Fine Arts, which included both White and African-American art in an effort to educate students on being an artist in a segregated American South. Douglas used his experiences as an artist in the Harlem Renaissance to inspire his students to expand on the movements of African-American art. He also encouraged his students to study African-American history to fully understand the necessity for African-American art in predominantly White-American society. Douglas retired from teaching in the Art Department at Fisk University in 1966.

=== 1967–79 ===
Aaron Douglas died in Nashville on February 2, 1979, at the age of 79.

== Legacy ==

Aaron Douglas pioneered the African-American modernist movement by combining aesthetic with ancient African traditional art. He set the stage for future African-American artists to utilize elements of African and African-American history alongside racial themes present in society.

In 2007, the Spencer Museum of Art organized an exhibition titled &quot;Aaron Douglas: African-American Modernist&quot;. It was held in Lawrence, Kansas, at the Spencer Museum of Art between September 8 to December 2, 2007, and traveled to the Frist Center for the Visual Arts in Nashville, Tennessee, from January 18 to April 13, 2008. It was then on display at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C. between May 9 and August 3, 2008. Finally, it traveled to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York, New York, from August 30 to November 30, 2008. An exhaustive catalog of this exhibition was put together through collaboration between Spencer Museum of Art and The University of Kansas, with the title &quot;Aaron Douglas: African American Modernist&quot;.

Douglas&#x27;s work was featured in the 2015 exhibition &quot;We Speak: Black Artists in Philadelphia, 1920s-1970s&quot; at the Woodmere Art Museum.

In 2016, with the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, an archive of artworks created by or having to do with Aaron Douglas became available on their website. Users can access the full references of these pieces of art to determine the creation date, subject of the art, and its current residence.

==Style==

Aaron Douglas developed two art styles during his career: first as a traditional portraitist, then as a muralist and illustrator. Influenced by having worked with Winold Reiss, Douglas incorporated African themes into his artwork to create a connection between Africans and African Americans. His work is described as being abstract, in that he portrayed the universality of the African-American people through song, dance, imagery and poetry. Through his murals and illustrations for various publications, he addressed social issues connected with race and segregation in the United States, and was one of the first African-American visual artists to utilize African-centered imagery.

His work features silhouettes of men and women, often in black and white. His human depictions have characteristically flat shapes that are angular and long, with slits for eyes. Often, his female figures are drawn in a crouched position or moving as if they are dancing in a traditional African way. He adopted elements of West African masks and sculptures into his own art, with a technique that utilized cubism to simplify his figures into lines and planes. He employed a narrow range of color, tone and value, most often using greens, browns, mauves, and blacks, with his human forms in darker shades of the present colors of the painting. He created emotional impact with subtle gradations of color, often using concentric circles to influence the viewer to focus on a specific part of the painting.

His artwork is two-dimensional, and his human figures are faceless, allowing their forms to be symbolic and general, so as to create a sense of unity between Africans and African Americans. Douglas’ paintings include semitransparent silhouettes to portray the struggle of African Americans and their relative successes in various aspects of social life. His work is described as unique in creating a link between African Americans and their African ancestry through visual elements that are rooted in African art, and thus give the African-American experience a symbolic aesthetic.

<doc id="727320" wikidata="Q1240497" url="?curid=727320" title="Donald Wills Douglas Sr.">
<text>Donald Wills Douglas Sr. (April 6, 1892 – February 1, 1981) was an American aircraft industrialist and engineer.

An aviation pioneer, he designed and built the Douglas Cloudster. Though it failed in its intended purpose—being the first to fly non-stop across the United States—it became the first airplane with a payload greater than its own weight.

He founded the Douglas Aircraft Company in 1921 (the company later merged with McDonnell Aircraft to form McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which merged with Boeing in 1997). Under his leadership, the company became one of the leaders of the commercial aircraft industry, engaging in a decades-long struggle for supremacy with arch-rival William Boeing and his eponymous enterprise. Douglas gained the upper hand, particularly with his revolutionary and highly successful Douglas DC-3 airliner and its equally popular World War II military transport version, the C-47; at the start of the war, his airplanes made up 80% of all commercial aircraft in service. However, he lagged behind in the jet age and was overtaken and surpassed by Boeing. He retired in 1957.

==Early life==
Douglas was born in Brooklyn, New York, the second son of an assistant cashier at the National Park Bank. He attended Trinity Chapel School and was of Scottish descent.

After graduation in 1909, he enrolled in the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. He had been an early aviation enthusiast; at the age of 16 in the fall of 1908, he convinced his mother that he needed to witness the Fort Myer trials of the Wright Flyer. He later built model airplanes, some with rubber-bands and other motors, in his dormitory room at Annapolis and tested them on the grounds and in the academy&#x27;s armory. In 1912 he resigned from the academy in order to pursue a career in aeronautical engineering.

After being turned down for jobs by Grover Loening and Glenn Curtiss, Douglas enrolled in MIT. He received his Bachelor of Science in Aeronautical Engineering—the first person to receive such a degree from MIT—in 1914, completing the four-year course in half the time; he remained there another year as an assistant to Professor Jerome Hunsaker.

==Early engineering career==
In 1915 Douglas joined the Connecticut Aircraft Company, participating in the designing of the Navy&#x27;s first dirigible, the DN-1. In August 1915, Douglas left for the Glenn Martin Company where he was, at the age of 23, chief engineer, where he designed the Martin S seaplane. Shortly after Glenn Martin merged with Wright Company to form Wright-Martin, Douglas resigned to become, in November 1916, the chief civilian aeronautical engineer of the Aviation Section of the US Army Signal Corps. Soon thereafter he returned to the newly reformed Glenn L. Martin Company, in Cleveland, Ohio, again becoming their chief engineer. Douglas designed the Martin MB-1 bomber.

In March 1920, Douglas resigned from his $10,000 () a year job to return to California, where he had met and, in 1916, married Charlotte Marguerite Ogg (1892–1976). They had four sons and one daughter including Donald Jr.

He soon started his first aircraft company, Davis-Douglas Company with $40,000 financing from partner David Davis. They worked together to attempt to build an aircraft that could fly coast to coast nonstop, the Douglas Cloudster. Following an unsuccessful attempt, Davis left the partnership, and Douglas founded the Douglas Aircraft Company.

==World War II==
Donald Douglas was not only a very highly regarded engineer and bold entrepreneur, but as World War II approached, he proved to be remarkably prescient. A year and a half before Pearl Harbor, he was already writing that this was the &quot;hour of destiny for American aviation.&quot; He expressed confidence that the industry could meet the need, and laid out the methods by which it would be transformed from small companies producing aircraft in small batches to making them on a production-line basis. The aircraft industry grew from a distant 41st place among American industries to first place in less than five years. Douglas Aircraft grew from being a small company with 68 employees in 1922 to being the fourth largest business in the United States.

The United States out-produced its enemies in totalitarian societies. As William S. Knudsen of the National Defense Advisory Commission observed, &quot;We won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production, the like of which he had never seen, nor dreamed possible.&quot; Donald Douglas summed it up similarly, &quot;Here&#x27;s proof that free men can out-produce slaves.&quot;

==Post-war==

Douglas Sr. retired in 1957 and was replaced by his son, Donald Douglas Jr. as company president. He retained his position as chairman of the board.

In 1967, the company was struggling to expand production to meet demand for DC-8 and DC-9 airliners and the A-4 Skyhawk military attack aircraft. Quality and cash flow problems and DC-10 development costs, combined with shortages due to the Vietnam War, led Douglas to agree to a merger with McDonnell Aircraft Corporation to form McDonnell Douglas on April 28, 1967.

Douglas Sr. served as honorary chairman of the McDonnell Douglas board until his death on February 1, 1981, at the age of 88. In keeping with his lifelong love for the sea, he was cremated and his ashes were scattered over the Pacific Ocean.

McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing in 1997, marking the end of the Douglas name in the aviation industry.

<doc id="727324" wikidata="Q482834" url="?curid=727324" title="Kahramanmaraş Province">
<text>Kahramanmaraş Province () is a province and metropolitan municipality of Turkey. Its area is 14,520 km2, and its population is 1,177,436 (2022). Its provincial capital is the city of Kahramanmaraş, and the traffic code is 46. In 2023, Its Pazarcık and Elbistan districts were home to the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes causing major damage to the city with 50K+ deaths.

==Geography==
Making up 1.83 % of Turkey&#x27;s land area, Kahramanmaraş is traversed by the northeasterly line of equal latitude and longitude. 
The majority of the province with around 60% of the total area is covered with mountains, being followed by plateaus and plains. Most of the mountains in the province is part of the Southeastern Taurus Mountain range. Due to the low tree line most of the highest areas are bare, but lower regions have forests.

Southern parts of the province has a hot-summer type Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;), including the administrative center of Kahramanmaraş. Northern parts of the province show the characteristics of a continental climate (&quot;Dsa&quot; and &quot;Dsb&quot;). At the northernmost parts of the province lays the Elbistan Plain, where the town and district of Elbistan is located. It has a cold semi arid climate.

Ceyhan River is the most important river in the province. Lake Kumaşır, along with some small crater lakes on the Nurhak and Ahir mountains makes the only natural body of water in the province, though there are multiple dam reservoirs such as Dam Lake Menzelet.
==History==
More than 12,600 residents of Kahramanmaraş province were killed during the 6 February 2023 earthquakes. Both earthquakes had epicenters in the province. Many large towns and cities including Elbistan had buildings collapse.

==Districts==

Kahramanmaraş province is divided into 11 districts (İlçe):
* Afşin
* Andırın
* Çağlayancerit
* Dulkadiroğlu
* Ekinözü
* Elbistan
* Göksun
* Nurhak
* Onikişubat
* Pazarcık
* Türkoğlu

==Health==
Air pollution in Turkey is a persistent issue and has been linked to the usage of coal-fired power plants, such as the Afşin-Elbistan power stations.

==Economy==

Kahramanmaraş has historically been famous for its gold. The textile industry in Kahramanmaraş has only recently developed and mainly operates through the use of machinery.

==Education==

The Kahramanmaraş Sütçü İmam University is a recently founded university supplying social, language and technical sciences as well as medical education.

==Cuisine==

The province&#x27;s most famous culinary specialty is Dondurma, also called &quot;Maraş ice cream&quot;, available in specialist Ice Cream shops throughout Turkey. The ice cream has an elastic consistency and is served with knife and fork, often accompanied by a slice of baklava. It melts in the mouth while chewed, with a consistency similar to bubble gum.

Maraş red peppers () are also well known for its aroma, Vitamin C content, and moderate hotness. Maraş pepper is different from far-east chilies as dried with support of Scientific Investigations and Universities which contains no aflatoxin and no diseases.

<doc id="727326" wikidata="Q116736" url="?curid=727326" title="Fernando Belaúnde">
<text>Fernando Sergio Marcelo Marcos Belaúnde Terry (October 7, 1912 – June 4, 2002) was a Peruvian politician who twice served as President of Peru (1963–1968 and 1980–1985). Deposed by a military coup in 1968, he was re-elected in 1980 after twelve years of military rule.

== Early life and education ==
The second of four children, Belaúnde was born in Lima into a wealthy aristocratic family of Spanish forebears: his father, Rafael Belaúnde Diez Canseco (1886–1972), a professor, served as Prime Minister under José Bustamante y Rivero; his paternal grandfather, Mariano Andrés Belaunde, was a Finance Minister; and one of his great-grandfathers, Pedro Diez Canseco, was also President of the Republic. He attended the Sagrados Corazones Recoleta in Lima.

During the dictatorship of Augusto B. Leguía, the persecution for the political activities of his father Rafael and his uncle Víctor Andrés Belaúnde prompted the family to move to France in 1924, where Fernando attended high school and received his initial University education in engineering.

From 1930 to 1935, Belaúnde studied architecture in the United States, where he first attended the University of Miami (where his father was also teaching), and in 1935 transferred to the University of Texas at Austin, where he obtained his degree as an architect. He would later become pro-American and became very proficient in the English language, with some referring to him as &quot;Fred Blundy&quot;.

He later moved to Mexico and worked as an architect for a brief time, but returned to Peru in 1936 and started his professional career as an architect designing private homes. In 1937, he started a magazine called &quot;El Arquitecto Peruano&quot; (&quot;Peruvian Architect&quot;), which dealt with interior design, general urbanism and housing problems the country was facing. This also gave way to the Architects Association of Peru and the Urbanism Institute of Peru.

As a result, Belaúnde also became a government public-housing consultant throughout the country and abroad. In 1943, Belaúnde began teaching architecture and urban planning at Escuela Nacional de Ingenieros of Lima and later became the dean of the Civil Engineering and Architecture department. Belaúnde also directed the construction, along with other professors and students, of the faculty of architecture of the National University of Engineering in 1955.

== Political career ==

Belaúnde&#x27;s political career began in 1944 as cofounder of the National Democratic Front party which elected José Bustamante as president in 1945; he served in the Peruvian Congress until a coup by General Manuel Odría in 1948 interrupted democratic elections.

Belaúnde returned to the political arena in 1956, when the outgoing Odría dictatorship called for elections and he led the slate submitted by the &quot;National Front of Democratic Youth&quot;, an organization formed by reform-minded university students, some of which had studied under him; his principled support for the &quot;La Prensa&quot; newspaper, which had been closed down by the dictatorship in early 1956, had prompted the leadership of the National Front to approach him as to lead its slate.

=== &quot;El Manguerazo&quot; ===

He gained notoriety on June 1 of the same year when, after the national election board refused to accept his candidacy filing, he led a massive protest that became known as the &quot;manguerazo&quot; or &quot;hosedown&quot; from the powerful water cannons used by the police to repress the demonstrators. When it seemed that the confrontation was going to turn violent, Belaúnde showed the gift for symbolism that would serve him well throughout his political life; calming down the demonstrators and armed solely with a Peruvian flag, he crossed alone the gap separating the demonstrators from the police to deliver an ultimatum to the police chief that his candidacy be accepted.

The government capitulated, and the striking image of Belaúnde walking by himself with the flag was featured by the news magazine &quot;Caretas&quot; the following day, in an article entitled &quot;Así Nacen Los Líderes&quot; (&quot;This is how Leaders are Born&quot;).

=== Founding of Acción Popular ===
Belaúnde&#x27;s 1956 candidacy was ultimately unsuccessful, as the dictatorship-favored right-wing candidacy of Manuel Prado took first place. Claiming irregularities, he prepared to lead the opposition, and in July 1956 in Chincheros, Cuzco, founded the center-right Acción Popular party, claiming the mantle of recapturing indigenous Inca traditions of community and cooperation in a modern social democratic context, placing itself squarely between the pro-oligarchy right-wing and the radicalism of the left-wing APRA and communist parties.

He would go on to travel extensively throughout the country, fleshing out the ideological principles of Acción Popular, while leading the opposition. During this period Belaúnde&#x27;s traditionalism would manifest itself in dramatic flourishes, most notoriously when he challenged to a duel a Pradista congressman who refused to retract insulting statements in an open letter; the duel took place, with minor scratches on both sides.

In 1959, the Prado government&#x27;s refusal to authorize the permits for the Accion Popular annual convention led to another confrontation: Belaúnde led the opening of the convention in defiance of the prohibition, and the Prado government arrested and jailed him in the Alcatraz-like island prison of El Frontón off the Lima coast. The imprisonment lasted 12 days, during which Belaúnde engaged in a failed attempt to escape by swimming to freedom; the Prado government, facing unrelenting public pressure, was forced to release him and drop all charges.

Belaúnde ran for president once again in the general elections of 1962, this time with his own party, &quot;Acción Popular&quot;. The results were very tight; he ended in second place, following Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre (APRA), by less than 14,000 votes. Since none of the candidates managed to get the constitutionally-established minimum of one third of the vote required to win outright, selection of the President would fall to Congress; the long-held antagonistic relationship between the military and APRA prompted Haya de la Torre to make a deal with former dictator Odría, who had come in third, which would result in Odría taking the Presidency in a coalition government.

However, widespread allegations of fraud prompted the Peruvian military to depose Prado and install a military junta, led by Ricardo Pérez Godoy. Pérez Godoy ran a short transitional government and held new elections in 1963, which were won by Belaúnde by a more comfortable but still narrow five percent margin.

=== First presidency (1963–1968) ===
During Belaúnde&#x27;s first term in office, he spurred numerous developmental projects. Belaúnde held a doctrine called &quot;The Conquest of Peru by Peruvians&quot;, which promoted the exploitation of resources in the Amazon rainforest and other outlying areas of Peru through conquest, stating &quot;only by turning our vision to the interior, and conquering our wilderness as the United States once did, will South America finally achieve true development&quot;. These included the &quot;Carretera Marginal de la Selva&quot;, a highway linking Chiclayo on the Pacific coast with then isolated northern regions of Amazonas and San Martín. In 1964 in an incident called the , the Belaúnde administration targeted the Matsés after two loggers were killed, with the Peruvian armed forces using USA-made fighter planes dropping napalm on the indigenous groups armed with bows and arrows, killing hundreds.

He also advanced the ambitious Santiago Antunez de Mayolo and Chira Piura irrigation projects, and the Tinajones, Jequetepeque, Majes, Chavimochic, Olmos, Chinecas hydroelectric projects. Belaúnde also oversaw the establishment of the Peruvian National Bank (Banco de la Nación). To alleviate poverty, Belaúnde also promoted a program of &quot;social interest&quot; homes in Lima and other cities, which benefited dozen thousands of families. Legal recognition was also given to hundreds of indigenous Indian communities, the hospital network was expanded into uncovered areas, and improvements were made in social security coverage. However, his administration was also blamed for making bad economic decisions, and by 1967 the sol had become seriously devalued.

In August 1968, the Belaúnde Administration announced the settlement of a long-standing dispute with a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey over claims to the rich La Brea and Pariñas oil fields. However, widespread anger about Belaúnde&#x27;s decision to pay the Standard Oil compensation for handing over the installation to Peru forced his cabinet to resign on October 1. A further cause of anger was the fact that the document of agreement was given by Belaúnde to the press with the final page (page 11) missing and signatures were squeezed at the bottom of page 10. The missing page became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; and was later shown on television containing the contribution that Belaúnde had promised to pay.

The military&#x27;s ideology at the time had also distanced itself from the wealthy elite, with the Center of High Military Studies promoting studies of Manuel González Prada and José Carlos Mariátegui for about a decade, creating officers that believed the elite were sacrificing Peru&#x27;s sovereignty in exchange for foreign capital and that such practices resulted with an undeveloped, reliant nation. Several days after the Standard Oil controversy, Belaúnde was removed from office by a military coup led by general Juan Velasco Alvarado, who would go on to become dictator of Peru for seven years. Belaúnde spent the next decade in the United States, teaching at Harvard, Johns Hopkins and George Washington University. Meanwhile the military regime established by General Velasco instituted sweeping but ill-fated reforms, primarily the nationalization of the oil industry and the redistribution of land from owners of large holdings to the campesinos of Peru.

=== Second presidency (1980–1985) ===
In April 1980, with Peru&#x27;s economy in deep depression, the military administration permitted an election for the restoration of constitutional rule. Belaúnde won a five-year term, polling an impressive 45 percent of the vote in a 15-man contest. One of his first actions as president was the return of several newspapers to their respective owners. In this way, freedom of speech once again played an important part in Peruvian politics. Gradually, he attempted to undo some of the most radical effects of the agrarian reform initiated by Velasco, and reversed the independent stance that the Military Government of Velasco had with the United States.

At the outbreak of the 1982 Falklands War () between Argentina and the United Kingdom, Belaúnde declared that Peru was ready to support Argentina with all the resources it needed. This included a number of fighter planes from the Peruvian Air Force, ships, and medical teams. Belaúnde&#x27;s government proposed a peace settlement between the two countries, but the Argentine military junta rejected it and the British launched an attack on the Argentinian forces deployed around the islands. In response to Chile&#x27;s support of Britain, Belaúnde called for Latin American unity.

In domestic policy, he continued with many of the projects that were planned during his first term, including the completion of what is considered his most important legacy, the &quot;Carretera Marginal de la Selva&quot;, a much-needed roadway linking Chiclayo on the Pacific coast with then isolated northern regions of Amazonas and San Martín.

After a promising beginning, Belaúnde&#x27;s popularity eroded under the stress of inflation, the War on Housing&#x27;s continuation, economic hardship, and terrorism: per capita income declined, Peru&#x27;s foreign debt burgeoned, and violence by leftist insurgents (notably Shining Path) rose steadily during the internal conflict in Peru, which was launched the day before Belaúnde was elected in 1980. He was president during the peak of the Lost Decade, in which unemployment rose above 50% and homelessness rose above 30%.

Regarding Shining Path, Belaúnde personally did not pay too much attention to this: insurgent movements were already active during his first term, but without much support. In addition, some government officials and insurgents were subsequently accused of human rights violations, and a state of emergency was promulgated in the Ayacucho and Apurímac regions.

During the next years, the economic problems left over from the military government persisted, worsened by an occurrence of the &quot;El Niño&quot; weather phenomenon in 1982–83, which caused widespread flooding in some parts of the country, severe droughts in others, and sharply reduced the schools of ocean fish that are one of the country&#x27;s major resources.

=== Post-presidency (1985–2002) ===
During the national elections of 1985, Belaúnde&#x27;s party, &quot;Acción Popular&quot;, was defeated by APRA candidate Alan García. However, as established in the 1979 Constitution, he would go on to serve in the Peruvian Senate as &quot;Senador Vitalicio&quot; (&quot;senator for life&quot;), a privilege for former Presidents abolished by the 1993 Constitution.

== Political views ==
Belaúnde’s political outlook was centre-right, pro-American, and conservative. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described him as &quot;a 19th century politician, with a high moral purpose and a sense of civic duty, who was perfectly at home in the conservative political milieu of 20th-century Peru, which for long occupied a time-warp, unusual even in Latin America, about a century behind the rest of the world&quot;. During the Falklands War, he supported the claims of Argentina.

<text>William Lewis Douglas (August 22, 1845 – September 17, 1924) was an American businessman and politician from Massachusetts. He served as the 42nd governor of Massachusetts from 1905 until 1906. He also founded and oversaw the growth of the W. L. Douglas Shoe Company, a highly successful Brockton, Massachusetts, business that became one of the world&#x27;s largest shoe manufacturers. He also opened the first nationwide chain of shoe stores devoted to selling the company&#x27;s products.

Douglas received a minimal education and was apprenticed into the shoe trade. In 1876, he established his business, which grew rapidly over the next twenty years. He entered politics as a supporter of labor and an opponent of socialism, and funded his 1904 campaign for governor. In addition to labor causes, he supported reciprocity and tariff reductions in trade with Canada. He refused to run for reelection, and returned to his business.

==Early years==
William Lewis Douglas was born on August 22, 1845, in Plymouth, Massachusetts, to William and Mary (Vaughan) Douglas. His father died when he was five. He received only intermittent schooling, and began working for his uncle in his shoemaking business at the age of seven. He eventually became an apprentice, working for his uncle until a decline in business in 1859 forced him to take textile factory work. The advent of the American Civil War revived the demand for boots, and Douglas briefly returned to the shoemaking business before enlisting in the Union Army. He served for one year, was wounded, and received his discharge in 1865.

After the war Douglas went west to the Colorado Territory. There he again took up shoemaking, but also spent time working as a partner in a shoe store in Golden. In 1868 he sold his share in the store and returned to Massachusetts. There he worked for eight years as a factory supervisor in a Brockton shoe factory.

==W. L. Douglas Shoe Company==

In 1876 Douglas borrowed $875 in order to open his own shoe factory. One critical decision he made in establishing the business was that he would sell the shoes he manufactured through his own line of retail outlets, rather than shipping them to other retailers or intermediaries. His business grew rapidly: every few years the factory&#x27;s output doubled, and by 1892 he was making 3,600 shoes per day. By the early 1900s his factory was the largest shoe manufactory in the world. The retail side of the business also grew: the first store opened in 1894, and by 1900 there were 55 stores nationwide.

Douglas was one of the first shoe manufacturers to widely advertise his products. He stamped the soles of his shoes with his own image (a use he took up after he saw P. T. Barnum&#x27;s advertising), making it one of the most recognized likenesses of the time. One period writer believed Douglas was likely the most widely recognized figure in the state.

Douglas&#x27; workers were members of the Boot and Shoe Workers&#x27; Union, which in 1899 sharply raised its dues in order to finance improved benefits and welfare funds. The rank and file were unhappy with this increase, and the dispute threatened the company&#x27;s ability to label its products with the union stamp. Douglas, who had a reputation as a fair employer, worked with the union to ensure his employees paid the higher dues.

==Political career==
In 1884 Douglas was elected as a Democrat to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, serving two terms. He then served one term in the state senate in 1886, and was elected mayor of Brockton for a single term in 1890. He was regularly active in the party organization, attending most of the national conventions between 1884 and 1904. He was generally a supporter of improved labor practices, supporting the creation of a labor mediation board, and advocating for the weekly pay of workers.

In 1903, he became prominent in state level politics opposing the rise of the Socialist Party, working to instead draw Socialist sympathizers to the Democratic fold by advocating a strong labor-oriented platform. In 1904 Republican governor John L. Bates vetoed an eight-hour work day bill, galvanizing labor opposition. The Democrats united behind Douglas, highlighting his labor-positive credentials and his fiscal conservatism. He successfully mediated the end of a labor action in Fall River, raising his popularity, and he also supported reciprocity, in particular the reduction of tariffs with Canada that would reduce the price of hides and coal. Douglas defeated Bates by a wide margin with support from the American Federation of Labor, and also drawing significant votes from Socialist circles. The success was a strictly personal victory: there were no other Democratic gains in the state.

Douglas&#x27; single term in office did not particularly help the Democratic cause. He bypassed Irish Americans (a significant force in the party) in appointments, leading to accusations of anti-Catholic sentiment. He also undermined his own position by announcing early in 1905 that he would not run for reelection. According to Charles S. Hamlin, Douglas may have been forced into this position by the discovery by Republicans that he had apparently fraudulently acquired an honorable discharge after deserting during the Civil War. The &quot;quid pro quo&quot; for this information not being revealed was that Douglas not run again. Douglas, despite his labor support, did not have the support of Democrats in the legislature, who helped override several of his vetoes. In the 1905 election, Douglas promoted Hamlin as his successor; the election was won by Republican Curtis Guild Jr.

Douglas returned to his business, retiring in the early 1920s. He was awarded an honorary degree from Tufts University while governor. He also engaged in philanthropic works in Brockton, where he helped found Brockton Hospital and established a charity that funded the treatment of children with eye and ear problems. Douglas moved from Brockton to Brookline in 1918, and died in 1924 after an extended illness. He was buried in Brockton&#x27;s Melrose Cemetery. He was twice married, with three children.

<text>MARC (machine-readable cataloging) is a standard set of digital formats for the machine-readable description of items catalogued by libraries, such as books, DVDs, and digital resources. Computerized library catalogs and library management software need to structure their catalog records as per an industry-wide standard, which is MARC, so that bibliographic information can be shared freely between computers. The structure of bibliographic records almost universally follows the MARC standard. Other standards work in conjunction with MARC, for example, Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (AACR)/Resource Description and Access (RDA) provide guidelines on formulating bibliographic data into the MARC record structure, while the International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD) provides guidelines for displaying MARC records in a standard, human-readable form.

==History==
Working with the Library of Congress, American computer scientist Henriette Avram developed MARC between 1965 and 1968, making it possible to create records that could be read by computers and shared between libraries. By 1971, MARC formats had become the US national standard for dissemination of bibliographic data. Two years later, they became the international standard. There are several versions of MARC in use around the world, the most predominant being MARC 21, created in 1999 as a result of the harmonization of U.S. and Canadian MARC formats, and UNIMARC. UNIMARC is maintained by the Permanent UNIMARC Committee of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), and is widely used in some parts of Europe. 

The MARC 21 family of standards now includes formats for authority records, holdings records, classification schedules, and community information, in addition to the format for bibliographic records.

==Record structure and field designations==

The MARC standards define three aspects of a MARC record: the field designations within each record, the structure of the record, and the actual content of the record itself.

===Field designations===

Each field in a MARC record provides particular information about the item the record is describing, such as the author, title, publisher, date, language, media type, etc. Since it was first developed at a time when computing power was low, and space precious, MARC uses a simple three-digit numeric code (from 001-999) to identify each field in the record. MARC defines field 100 as the primary author of a work, field 245 as the title and field 260 as the publisher, for example.

Fields above 008 are further divided into subfields using a single letter or number designation. The 260, for example, is further divided into subfield &quot;a&quot; for the place of publication, &quot;b&quot; for the name of the publisher, and &quot;c&quot; for the date of publication.

===Record structure===

MARC records are typically stored and transmitted as binary files, usually with several MARC records concatenated together into a single file. MARC uses the ISO 2709 standard to define the structure of each record. This includes a marker to indicate where each record begins and ends, as well as a set of characters at the beginning of each record that provide a directory for locating the fields and subfields within the record.

In 2002, the Library of Congress developed the MARCXML schema as an alternative record structure, allowing MARC records to be represented in XML; the fields remain the same, but those fields are expressed in the record in XML markup. Libraries typically expose their records as MARCXML via a web service, often following the SRU or OAI-PMH standards.

===Content===

MARC encodes information about a bibliographic item, not information about the content of that item; this means it is a metadata transmission standard, not a content standard. The actual content that a cataloger places in each MARC field is usually governed and defined by standards outside of MARC, except for a handful of fixed fields defined by the MARC standards themselves. Resource Description and Access, for example, defines how the physical characteristics of books and other items should be expressed. The Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) are a list of authorized subject terms used to describe the main subject content of the work. Other cataloging rules and classification schedules can also be used.

==MARC formats==
===MARC 21===

MARC 21 was designed to redefine the original MARC record format for the 21st century and to make it more accessible to the international community. MARC 21 has formats for the following five types of data: Bibliographic Format, Authority Format, Holdings Format, Community Format, and Classification Data Format. Currently MARC 21 has been implemented successfully by The British Library, the European Institutions and the major library institutions in the United States, and Canada.

MARC 21 is a result of the combination of the United States and Canadian MARC formats (USMARC and CAN/MARC). MARC 21 is based on the NISO/ANSI standard Z39.2, which allows users of different software products to communicate with each other and to exchange data.

MARC 21 allows the use of two character sets, either MARC-8 or Unicode encoded as UTF-8. MARC-8 is based on ISO 2022 and allows the use of Hebrew, Cyrillic, Arabic, Greek, and East Asian scripts. MARC 21 in UTF-8 format allows all the languages supported by Unicode.

===MARCXML===
MARCXML is an XML schema based on the common MARC 21 standards. MARCXML was developed by the Library of Congress and adopted by it and others as a means of facilitating the sharing of, and networked access to, bibliographic information. Being easy to parse by various systems allows it to be used as an aggregation format, as it is in software packages such as MetaLib, though that package merges it into a wider DTD specification.

The MARCXML primary design goals included:

* Simplicity of the schema 
* Flexibility and extensibility
* Lossless and reversible conversion from MARC
* Data presentation through XML stylesheets
* MARC records updates and data conversions through XML transformations
* Existence of validation tools

==Future==

The future of the MARC formats is a matter of some debate among libraries. On the one hand, the storage formats are quite complex and are based on outdated technology. On the other, there is no alternative bibliographic format with an equivalent degree of granularity. The billions of MARC records in tens of thousands of individual libraries (including over 50,000,000 records belonging to the OCLC consortium alone) create inertia. The Library of Congress has launched the Bibliographic Framework Initiative (BIBFRAME), which aims at providing a replacement for MARC that provides greater granularity and easier re-use of the data expressed in multiple catalogs. Beginning in 2013, OCLC Research exposed data detailing how various MARC elements have been used by libraries in the 400 million MARC records (as of early 2018) contained in WorldCat. The MARC formats are managed by the MARC Steering Group, which is advised by the MARC Advisory Committee. Proposals for changes to MARC are submitted to the MARC Advisory Committee and discussed in public at the American Library Association (ALA) Midwinter and ALA Annual meetings.

<text>The Inner Circle Line was a steam era suburban railway line (later electrified) in Melbourne, Australia. It served the inner-northern suburbs of Parkville, Carlton North, Fitzroy North and Fitzroy. At its closure, it ran from Royal Park station on the Upfield line in the west to a triangular junction with Rushall and Merri stations on today&#x27;s Mernda line in the east. There was also a branch line to Fitzroy that opened at the same time.

==History==
The Inner Circle was opened on 8 May 1888 with three stations: North Carlton and North Fitzroy on the main line, and Fitzroy at the end of a short branch line leading south through the Edinburgh Gardens from a junction near North Fitzroy station.

===As the main line===
When the Inner Circle line first opened, services originated from Spencer Street station at the western end of the Melbourne central business district. Trains bound for the then terminus at Heidelberg station (now on the Hurstbridge line) would run to North Fitzroy station, then continue south to Victoria Park station (then known as Collingwood, and now on the Hurstbridge and Mernda lines). Locomotives would then have to change ends and the trains return to Clifton Hill station, where they diverged east on to the line to Heidelberg.

In December 1889, after the opening of the Whittlesea line, trains ran from Spencer Street to Whittlesea via the Inner Circle. Other services on the same route only travelled as far as Preston station.

A passenger service was originally provided from Spencer Street to Fitzroy station, on the branch line. By October 1889 this had been relegated to a short shuttle service from North Fitzroy station, and the passenger service closed altogether in May 1892.

For a short period between March and May 1891, the Inner and Outer Circle routes formed the only link between the eastern and western halves of the Victorian Railways system. Prior to that, the link was via a street-level tramway along the edge of the CBD between Flinders and Spencer Streets, which was generally only used at night. Between December 1888 and May 1891, when the new Flinders Street Viaduct, connecting Flinders Street and Spencer Street stations, was in its final stages of construction, the Outer and Inner Circle lines allowed freight trains to bypass the construction site.

===Replaced by direct line===
In 1901 a new direct line to Clifton Hill was opened from the central Princes Bridge station at the southern edge of the CBD through the inner eastern suburb of Abbotsford. This meant that Heidelberg-bound trains could run direct to their destination, removing the need for the reversal manoeuvre at Victoria Park. The Preston suburban service also ran via the new line. However, Whittlesea trains continued to use the more indirect route via the Inner Circle, albeit only from Spencer Street station.

With the loss of the main line services on the Inner Circle after 1901, a series of &quot;roundabout&quot; services were trialled. By 1906 a regular steam-operated service was established from Princes Bridge to North Fitzroy station via Clifton Hill, and by 1919 this service was running every hour off-peak.

Electrification of the line between Royal Park and Clifton Hill stations was commissioned on 31 July 1921, but the Fitzroy branch was not electrified. Following electrification, passenger services were extended to North Carlton running at 15 minute headways, but from 18 September 1921 they were changed to every 20 minutes. Two trains on weekdays, and a larger number at weekends were extended to Royal Park station to serve patrons of the Melbourne Zoo.

There was the possibility of a revitalisation of the Inner Circle in 1940, when the Ashworth Improvement Plan recommended a subway tunnel with five stations be built under the Melbourne CBD, from Flinders Street to the Inner Circle, with a proposed future subway from the first station to North Melbourne.

Traffic on the Inner Circle was discouraged by the circuitous route and by competition from the more direct trams to the city. Off-peak services were cut to every 30 minutes from 29 May 1944, but from 4 December 1944 20-minute headways were restored on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. The passenger service was finally cancelled on 3 July 1948, and North Carlton and North Fitzroy stations closed to passengers.

===Freight only===
After 1948 the Inner Circle line was used exclusively for freight trains serving sidings along the line itself, and the goods yard at the end of the Fitzroy branch. The overhead wiring for electric trains was dismantled in 1961. Only the main feeder cables needed for Epping (now Mernda) line trains, and for shunting at the Royal Park end, were retained. Significant changes occurred in 1965, when the line was singled and both legs of the triangle at the eastern end of the line were closed. This left just a single line from Royal Park to Fitzroy remaining for goods services. The line was officially closed on 31 July 1981.

==Today==
The rails were removed after the final closure, except for some short sections at former level crossings which can still be seen today. From Rushall to Royal Park stations the rail reserve has become a linear park which provides part of the Capital City Trail for cyclists, connecting the Merri Creek Trail to the Moonee Ponds Creek Trail in the network of shared use bicycle paths. Some signals and parts of level crossing gates also survive, with remaining overhead stanchions still carrying railway electric current between the Upfield and Mernda railway lines.

Of the three former stations, only North Carlton still stands, having been converted into a community centre. North Fitzroy station is now a slight rise in the walking and cycling path east of Nicholson Street. The path was realigned in 2002 to traverse the length of the former platform. The site of Fitzroy station has been redeveloped into a medium-density housing estate.

<text>Conditions races are horse races in which the weights carried by the runners are laid down by the conditions attached to the race. Weights are allocated according to the sex of the runners, with female runners carrying less weight than males; the age of the runners, with younger horses receiving weight from older runners to allow for relative maturity, referred to as weight for age; and the quality of the runners, with horses that have won certain values of races giving weight to less successful entrants.

Conditions races are distinct from handicap races, for which the weights carried are laid down by an official handicapper to equalise the difference in ability between the runners. In Great Britain, for example, the British Horseracing Authority&#x27;s rules define a conditions race as being one &quot;which is none of the following; a Handicap Race or a Novice Race, a race restricted to Maiden Horses, or a race governed by Selling or Claiming provisions.&quot;

Conditions races are staged at all levels of horse racing. As all of the most important races in Europe are conditions races, the term may also refer to races for the very best horses, known as Group races. That is not the case in North America and Australia, where handicaps are included in the Group race/Graded race system.

<text>Damwâld is a village in the Dantumadiel municipality of Friesland, in the Netherlands. In 2020 it had 5630 citizens. This number of citizens makes Damwâld the largest village in the municipality of Dantumadiel.

== History ==
The present day village of Damwâld is a merged place of three older villages, merged in 1971. The three villages were; Dantumawoude &quot;(Dantumawâld)&quot;, Akkerwoude &quot;(Ikkerwâld)&quot; and Murmerwoude &quot;(Moarrewâld)&quot;. But it was in the 19th century that the villages started really growing together already. From the second half of that century the buildings strongly densified and in 1880 along the Murmerlaan (later named the Haadwei) the first tram track of Friesland was opened, a horse track.

The municipality decided to move the town hall to Murmerwoude. Up until 1881 this was located in the village of Rinsumageast. The move was a bit surprising considering the fact that Murmerwoude was the smallest of the three villages and Dantumawoude which the municipality is named after had a bit of higher status with a history of noble stone house (stins) and the village of De Westereen having the biggest population. In that village al lot of people where claiming that&#x27;s the reason why the town hall should have moved to there. But it never happened. The town hall in Murmerwoude had been renovated a number of times but eventually, around 1970, the municipality decided that the town hall will be moved to stately stins of Rinsmastate in Driezum.

The move meant that a lot of the services and shops in the three villages could have been in doubt without further steps been taken. Losing the town hall could mean losing the center place-function. That and a practical reasons with the fact that the three villages even more blended together since the new housing constructions of the 1960s. And some of the houses being in one villages while others in another while they there in a row behind each other. Making it a bit confusion for the everyday people and people like the mailman. To eventually solve this problem, the local government fused the three small towns into one, in 1971, a small year before the new town hall in Driezum came into use. Giving the history the older issues probably played in the background as well. But it was until 1999 that the town hall was back in Damwâld, not far from the place where it was located in Murmerwoude.

A lot of the people from the three villages where themselves against the merger. The people of Akkerwoude especially. It was hotly debated but the council of the municipality decided to continue with the merger. The name of the new town eventually came to be Damwoude, before changing to Damwâld in 2009. The first letter of the Dutch name of each smaller village made up the first three letters of the new name. But also the name was already used historically as a short version of Dantumawoude, dating back from around 1700 and the 19th century. In 1971 there was a plea that all three villages should be named under the new town signs. That was granted, but those signs disappeared slowly over the years. The new town continued to grow and thus retained its center function.

In 2008 the Dantumadiel municipality decided to officially change the Dutch names of the villages into their West Frisian counterparts, changing the village name from Damwoude to Damwâld.

<doc id="727357" wikidata="Q4976535" url="?curid=727357" title="Brownie points">
<text>Brownie points in modern usage are an imaginary social currency, which can be acquired by doing good deeds or earning favor in the eyes of another, often one&#x27;s spouse.

==Conjectures for etymology==

===Girlguiding===
A popular etymology is an allusion to the merit badges or six points earned by Brownies (junior Girl Guides/Girl Scouts) for carrying out good deeds. Brownies were named after a kind of mythological elf that does helpful things around the house.

===Brown stamps===
A popular marketing practice employed by many stores in post-World War II US was the distribution of stamps with each purchase. The number of stamps given out varied with the amount of the purchase. These stamps were collected by customers and later redeemed for household gifts. The earliest of these stamps were brown in color and known as &quot;brown stamps&quot; or &quot;brown points&quot;. The relationship between a purchase and the collection of these &quot;brown points&quot; equated with doing a good thing (supporting the local vendor) and getting a bonus (the valuable stamps). Purportedly, the collection of these &quot;brownie points&quot; eventually evolved into the modern usage. The term Browniepoints is still used as a marketing practice in business today by a New Zealand power company and also used by a gift service.

===George R. Brown===
Another proposed etymology is that the term derives from the name of a 19th-century American railroad superintendent, George R. Brown who, in 1886, devised what was then an innovative system of merits and demerits for railroad employees on the Fall Brook Railway in New York state. Accounts of his system were published in railroad journals, and adopted by many leading U.S. railroads. American railroad employees soon began referring colloquially to &quot;brownie points&quot;, and at some point, the term entered the general vocabulary.

===Curtis Publishing===
In the 1930s, the Curtis Publishing Company published several magazines, including the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; and the &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot;. These magazines were distributed to subscribers through a delivery network that used youths, primarily boys, to sell subscriptions in residential neighborhoods. The boys received a small commission; in addition, if they met certain sales targets, they could also earn company scrip, consisting of green and brown vouchers, referred to as &quot;greenies&quot; and &quot;brownies.&quot; One brownie was worth five greenies. The greenies and brownies could be redeemed for goods from the company&#x27;s catalogue.

===Scatological===
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; conjectures that this expression could also have derived from U.S. military slang for sycophants, &quot;&quot;, while also mentioning the popular etymology that derives it from the awards system of the Brownies. The term &quot;brownie&quot; in the sense of &quot;brown-noser&quot; was in use in the 1940s. It has been suggested that the term was given impetus through its coincidence with related scatological slang.

===Earliest use===
The earliest published citation given in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; dates from 1963 (when it was reported in the journal &quot;American Speech&quot;), but the term is in fact somewhat older. Its frequent appearance in newspapers in the 1950s date back to the earliest known usage in 1951, where a man in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; speaks of earning favor with his wife in terms of brownie points.

<text>Herbert Henry Dow (February 26, 1866 – October 15, 1930) was an American chemical industrialist who founded the American multinational conglomerate Dow Chemical. A graduate of the Case School of Applied Science in Cleveland, Ohio, he was a prolific inventor of chemical processes, compounds, and products, notably bromine extraction from sea water, and was a successful businessman.

== Biography ==

===Early years===
Herbert Henry Dow was born in 1866 in Belleville, Ontario, the eldest child of Americans Joseph Henry Dow, an inventor and mechanical engineer, and his wife, Sarah Bunnell, who were from Derby, Connecticut. When the infant boy was six weeks old, the family returned to their hometown. They moved again in 1878, this time to Cleveland to follow Joseph&#x27;s job with the Derby Shovel Manufacturing Company.

After graduating from high school in 1884, Dow enrolled in the Case School of Applied Science (now known as Case Western Reserve University). While at Case, he became a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. He began specialized research into the chemical composition of brines in Ohio and nearby areas. He discovered that brine samples from Canton, Ohio and Midland, Michigan were very rich in bromine, which at the time was a primary ingredient in medicines and was widely used in the fledgeling photographic industry. Following his graduation from Case in 1888, Dow worked for a year as a chemistry professor at Huron Street Hospital College in Cleveland, while continuing his research into the extraction of chemicals from brine.

===Business career===
In 1889, Dow received his first patent after inventing a more cost-effective and streamlined process for bromine extraction. He quickly formed his own company but was bankrupt within the year. His associates were impressed with his work and in 1890 helped him to found the Midland Chemical Company in Midland, Michigan. Dow continued his work extracting bromine, and by early 1891 he had invented the Dow process, a method of bromine extraction using electrolysis to oxidize bromide to bromine.

==== Foundation of Dow Chemical ====
Dow wanted to expand his research of electrolysis to yield other chemicals. His financial backers did not approve of his continued research and fired him from the Midland Chemical Company. He continued his research, developing a process to extract chlorine and caustic soda from sodium chloride.

After seeking funding from potential backers in Cleveland, including family friends and former Case School of Applied Science classmates, Dow secured funds from James T. Pardee, Albert W. Smith, J. H. Osborn, and Cady Staley. In 1895, Dow moved his young family to Massillon, Ohio and founded the Dow Process Company to develop the production mechanism for his process. The following year he returned to Midland, where he formed the Dow Chemical Company as successor to the Dow Process Company. The Dow Process Company was incorporated with 57 original stockholders. Within three years, his new company purchased the Midland Chemical Company.

==== Breaking a monopoly ====
With his new company and new technology, Dow produced bromine very cheaply, and began selling it in the United States for 36 cents per pound. At the time, the German government supported a bromine cartel, Deutsche Bromkonvention, which had a near-monopoly on the supply of bromine, which they sold in the US for 49 cents per pound. The Germans had made it clear that they would dump the market with cheap bromine if Dow attempted to sell his product abroad. In 1904 Dow defied the cartel by beginning to export his bromine at its cheaper price to England. A few months later, an angry Bromkonvention representative visited Dow in his office and reminded him to cease exporting his bromine.

Unafraid, Dow continued exporting to England and Japan. The German cartel retaliated by dumping the US market with bromine at 15 cents a pound in an effort to put him out of business. Unable to compete with this predatory pricing in the U.S., Dow instructed his agents to buy up hundreds of thousands of pounds of the German bromine locally at the low price. The Dow company repackaged the bromine and exported it to Europe, selling it even to German companies at 27 cents a pound. The cartel, having expected Dow to go out of business, was unable to comprehend what was driving the enormous demand for bromine in the U.S., and where all the cheap imported bromine dumping their market was coming from. They suspected their own members of violating their price-fixing agreement and selling in Germany below the cartel&#x27;s fixed cost. The cartel continued to slash prices on their bromine in the U.S., first to 12 cents a pound, and then to 10.5 cents per pound. The cartel finally caught on to Dow&#x27;s tactic and realized that they could not keep selling below cost. They then increased their prices worldwide.

==== World War I ====
Dow Chemical Company focused on research, and soon was able to extract many more chemicals from brine. World War I provided demand that enabled its growth, because Britain blockaded the ports of Germany, which at the time included most of the world&#x27;s largest chemical suppliers. Dow Chemical quickly moved to fill the gap for wartime goods, producing magnesium for incendiary flares, monochlorobenzene and phenol for explosives, and bromine for medicines and tear gas. By 1918, 90% of the Dow Chemical Company production was in support of the war effort. During this time period, Dow also created the diamond logo, which is still used by the Dow Chemical Company.

====Auto industry====
Following the conclusion of the war, Dow began to research the benefits of magnesium, which the company had in large supply. He discovered that it could be used to make automobile pistons. The new pistons proved to give more speed and better fuel efficiency. The Dowmetal pistons were used heavily in racing vehicles, and the 1921 winner of the Indianapolis 500 used the Dowmetal pistons in his vehicle.

===Personal life=== 
Dow married Grace Anna Ball, a teacher in Midland, on November 16, 1892.
The union bore seven children between 1894 and 1908: Helen, Ruth, Willard, Osborn, Alden B, Margaret and Dorothy Darling. One child, Osborn Curtis, died from Spinal meningitis before his third birthday in 1902. Willard became a chemist with his father&#x27;s company, succeeding him as chief executive in 1930. Alden became one of the nation&#x27;s leading architects.

The family house was shared with Hebert Dow&#x27;s parents, Joseph and Sarah Dow, and his sisters, Helen and Mary Dow.

===Death===
By the time of his death on October 15, 1930, from cirrhosis of the liver, Dow had personally received over 90 patents. Dow was survived by his wife, Grace, and five of their seven children.

== Commemoration ==

In 1899, Dow started the Dow Gardens in Midland, Michigan, as a personal hobby on the grounds of their residence.

Herbert Henry Dow High School in Midland, Michigan opened in 1968, and is named after Dow. Among his awards is the Perkin Medal, received in 1930.

His home in Midland, known as Herbert H. Dow House, was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1976.

Grace established the Herbert H. and Grace A. Dow Foundation during 1936 in memory of her husband Herbert to enhance the quality of life for everyone in the Midland area and in the state of Michigan. In the years since, nearly half a billion dollars has been donated to worthy projects and programs in the state. The foundation&#x27;s offices are located in a building on the grounds of the Dow home and gardens.

<doc id="727364" wikidata="Q573043" url="?curid=727364" title="Anthony Comstock">
<text>Anthony Comstock (; March7, 1844 – September21, 1915) was an American anti-vice activist, United States Postal Inspector, and secretary of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice (NYSSV), who was dedicated to upholding Christian morality. He opposed obscene literature, abortion, contraception, masturbation, gambling, prostitution, and patent medicine. The terms &quot;comstockery&quot; and &quot;comstockism&quot; refer to his extensive censorship campaign of materials that he considered obscene, including birth control advertised or sent by mail. He used his positions in the U.S. Postal Service and the NYSSV (in association with the New York police) to make numerous arrests for obscenity and gambling. Besides these pursuits, he was also involved in efforts to suppress fraudulent banking schemes, mail swindles, and medical quackery.

== Life ==

Comstock was born in New Canaan, Connecticut, the son of Polly Ann (née Lockwood) and Thomas Anthony Comstock. As a young man, he enlisted and fought for the Union in the American Civil War from December 1863 to September 1865. He served without incident in Company H, 17th Connecticut Infantry, but he objected to the profanity used by his fellow soldiers.

In 1867, he moved to New York City, where he worked as a porter, a stock clerk, and a wholesale dry goods salesman. He also worked for the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association (YMCA) in New York City. On March 5, 1873, he was appointed a special agent of the U.S. Postal Service, a position he held until January 1907.

Comstock lived in Summit, New Jersey, from 1880 to 1915. In 1892, he built a house at 35 Beekman Road, where he lived until he died there in 1915.

== Enforcement of Comstock Laws ==
In 1873, Comstock created the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, an institution dedicated to moral supervision of the American public. Later that year, Comstock successfully influenced the United States Congress to pass the Comstock Laws, which made illegal the delivery by U.S. mail, or by other modes of transportation, of &quot;obscene, lewd, or lascivious&quot; material, as well as prohibiting any methods of production or publication of information pertaining to the procurement of abortion, the prevention of conception and the prevention of venereal disease.

Some of Comstock&#x27;s ideas of what were &quot;obscene, lewd, or lascivious&quot; could be seen by many modern Westerners as quite broad; during his time of greatest power, some anatomy textbooks were prohibited from being sent to medical students by the United States Postal Service.
He was a savvy political insider in New York City and was made a special agent of the United States Postal Service with police-level powers, including the right to carry a weapon. With this power, he prosecuted those that he suspected of either public distribution of pornography or commercial fraud.

=== Motivation ===
Motivated by first-hand experience with what he saw as a constant barrage of debauchery among fellow Union soldiers during the Civil War, when he gained power it was not long before Comstock aroused intense loathing from early civil liberties groups and strong support from church-based groups that were worried about public morals.

=== Targets of enforcement ===
==== Publishers of free love advocacy ====
Comstock, the self-styled &quot;weeder in God&#x27;s garden&quot;, arrested D. M. Bennett for publishing &quot;An Open Letter to Jesus Christ&quot; and later had the editor charged for mailing a free-love pamphlet. Bennett was prosecuted, subjected to a widely publicized trial, and imprisoned in the Albany Penitentiary for 11 months.

Anthony Comstock&#x27;s enforcement of his namesake laws often led him into significant legal battles with various advocates of free expression. Notably, Comstock clashed with organizations and individuals who viewed his actions as an overreach. For example, his prosecution of D. M. Bennett, the publisher of the freethought periodical &quot;The Truth Seeker&quot;, highlighted the contentious nature of the Comstock laws. Bennett&#x27;s conviction for mailing &#x27;obscene&#x27; literature sparked widespread debate about the limits of censorship and freedom of speech.

Comstock was also opposed to woman suffragists, notably Victoria Claflin Woodhull and her sister Tennessee Celeste Claflin. The men&#x27;s journal &quot;The Days&#x27; Doings&quot; popularized images of the sisters for three years and was instructed by its editor (while Comstock was present) to stop producing lewd images. Comstock also took legal action against the paper for advertising contraceptives. After the sisters published an exposé of an adulterous affair between the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher and Elizabeth Tilton, he had the sisters arrested under laws forbidding the use of the postal service to distribute &quot;obscene material&quot;. They were later acquitted of the charges.

==== Lottery operators ====
He was also involved in shutting down the Louisiana Lottery, which was the only legal lottery in the United States at the time and was notorious for corruption.

==== Distributors of sex manuals ====
Less fortunate was Ida Craddock, who died by suicide on the eve of reporting to federal prison for distributing via the U.S. mail various sexually explicit marriage manuals that she had written. Her final work was a lengthy public suicide note specifically condemning Comstock.

==== Abortion providers ====
Comstock also arrested the prominent abortion provider Madame Restell. In 1878, he posed as a customer seeking birth control for his wife. Restell provided him with pills and he returned the next day with the police, and arrested her. Rather than face the resulting trial, she committed suicide soon after it began.

=== Magnitude of impact ===
Through his various campaigns, he destroyed 15 tons of books, 284,000 pounds of plates for printing &quot;objectionable&quot; books, and nearly 4,000,000 pictures. He claimed that &quot;books are feeders for brothels.&quot;

Comstock boasted that he was responsible for 4,000 arrests and claimed he drove 15 persons to suicide in his &quot;fight for the young&quot;.

== Advocacy ==
He later lectured to college audiences and wrote newspaper articles to sustain his causes.

== Opponents ==
During his career, Comstock made many and diverse enemies, such as Emma Goldman and Margaret Sanger. In her autobiography, Goldman referred to Comstock as the leader of America&#x27;s &quot;moral eunuchs.&quot;

== Injuries ==

In later years his health was affected by a severe blow to the head. On the second of July 1873, Comstock was assaulted during an argument with a Dr. Selden, who &quot;struck him over the forehead with a heavy seal ring&quot; after being punched in the ribs by an umbrella (Selden accused Comstock of being &quot;sneak&quot;). The following year, Comstock was stabbed in the head by Charles Conroy. Conroy, long a foil for Comstock dating back to 1868, was &quot;an unrepentant two-bit pornographer—whose name even the New York Times couldn&#x27;t get right, mistakenly reporting him as John or James Conroy in his arrest notices—inadvertently kick-started Anthony Comstock&#x27;s career as the most influential moralizer in American history&quot;.

==Death==
On September 21, 1915, Comstock died of pneumonia at the age of 71 at his home in Summit, New Jersey.

== Writings ==
Anthony Comstock authored several books focused on the theme of vice suppression, including &quot;Frauds Exposed; or, How the People Are Deceived and Robbed, and Youth Corrupted&quot; (New York: J. Howard Brown, 1880), &quot;Traps for the Young&quot; (New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1883), and &quot;Morals versus Art&quot; (New York: J. S. Ogilvie and Company, 1877). These works explore various aspects of societal corruption and the perceived moral degradation of the youth.

* &quot;&quot; (1880)
* &quot;&quot; (1883)
* &quot;&quot; (1887)
* &quot;&quot; (1887)

He wrote numerous magazine articles relating to similar subjects.

== Legacy ==
Before his death, Comstock attracted the interest of a young law student, J. Edgar Hoover, who showed interest in his causes and methods. The term &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;censorship because of perceived obscenity or immorality&quot;, was coined in an editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1895. George Bernard Shaw used the term in 1905 after Comstock had alerted the New York City police to the content of Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;Mrs. Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot;. Shaw remarked that &quot;Comstockery is the world&#x27;s standing joke at the expense of the United States. Europe likes to hear of such things. It confirms the deep-seated conviction of the Old World that America is a provincial place, a second-rate country-town civilization after all.&quot; Comstock thought of Shaw as an &quot;Irish smut dealer.&quot; He is thought to be a major influence for the main antagonist of &quot;BioShock Infinite&quot;, Zachary Hale Comstock, as they share the same last names and have numerous ideological similarities.

== Biographies ==
&quot;Anthony Comstock: Roundsman of the Lord&quot; (1927), Heywood Broun and Margaret Leech of the Algonquin Round Table, examines Comstock&#x27;s personal history and his investigative, surveillance, and law enforcement techniques.

&quot;Lust on Trial: Censorship and the Rise of American Obscenity in the Age of Anthony Comstock&quot; (2018), Columbia University Press, by Amy B. Werbel, presents a colorful journey through Comstock&#x27;s career that doubles as a new history of post–Civil War America&#x27;s risqué visual and sexual culture.

&quot;The Man Who Hated Women: Sex, Censorship, And Civil Liberties In The Gilded Age&quot; (2021), Farrar, Straus and Giroux, by Amy Sohn, focuses on Comstock&#x27;s impacts on society, the Comstock Laws, and eight women charged with violating the law.

<text>Nocturama is the twelfth studio album by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, released on February 3, 2003 on Mute and ANTI-. Produced by Nick Launay, the album is the last to feature founding member Blixa Bargeld who departed the band shortly after the album&#x27;s release.

==Recording==
&quot;Nocturama&quot; was recorded in one week during an Australian tour in March 2002, and reunited Nick Cave and guitarist Mick Harvey with producer Nick Launay, who had worked with their previous band The Birthday Party twenty-one years earlier.

Reflecting on the recording experience, Launay noted: &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget the first day recording &quot;Nocturama&quot;. Blixa swept into SingSing Studio in &quot;that&quot; hat. Mick Harvey introduces me and Blixa goes, &#x27;Oh, ja, the engineer.&#x27; Mick says, &#x27;No, Blixa – the &quot;producer&quot;.&#x27; Blixa says, &#x27;Well, we&#x27;ll see about that, won&#x27;t we?&#x27; From a distance they look like the most chaotic band. From an engineering point of view, it&#x27;s just fucking mental – like recording a live gig but you&#x27;re capturing this thing for ever. As soon as Nick walks in and sits at the piano, you&#x27;re recording. The intensity is unlike any other band.&quot;

<text>John Alexander Dowie (25 May 18479 March 1907) was a Scottish-Australian minister known as a Christian evangelist and faith healer. He began his career as a Christian minister in South Australia. After becoming an evangelist and faith healer, he emigrated with his family to the United States in 1888, settling in San Francisco, where he developed his faith healing practice into a mail-order business. He moved to Chicago in time to take advantage of the crowds attracted to the 1893 World&#x27;s Fair. After attracting an immense faith healing business in Chicago, with multiple homes and businesses, including a publishing house, to keep his thousands of followers, he bought an extensive parcel of land north of the city to set up a private community.

There, Dowie founded the city of Zion, Illinois, where he personally owned all the land and established many businesses. The operations of the city have been characterized as &quot;a carefully-devised large-scale platform for securities fraud...&quot; His lieutenant initiated an investigation of his business practices and deposed him from leadership in 1905. Dowie was given an allowance until his death.

In this period, Dowie refined his religious organization, naming it in 1903 as the Christian Catholic Apostolic Church.

== Personal life and education ==
Dowie was born in 1847 in Edinburgh, Scotland, to John Murray Dowie, a tailor and preacher, and his wife. In 1860, his parents moved the family to Adelaide, South Australia.
Dowie worked for a few months in a bootmaking business owned by his uncle, Alexander Dowie.
He took various other jobs, advancing to a position as a confidential clerk for the resident partner of a firm doing a business of $2 million yearly.

In 1867, Dowie&#x27;s father was president of the South Adelaide chapter of the Total Abstinence Society, and Dowie became an active member. Around 1868, at the age of 21, Dowie returned to Edinburgh to study theology.

He married his cousin, Jane Dowie, on 26 May 1876. They had three children: A. J. Gladstone Dowie (1877–1945), Jeanie Dowie (1879–1885), and Esther Allum Dowie (1881–1902).

==Ministry in Australia and New Zealand==
=== Congregational Ministry ===
After Dowie completed his theological studies, he returned to Australia and was ordained in 1872 as pastor of a Congregational church at Alma (near Hamley Bridge). Dowie then received and accepted a call in 1873 to a pastorate at Manly, New South Wales, before moving to Newtown in 1875.

=== The Salvation Army ===
About this time, he gave up his pastorate as a Congregational clergyman. For a time, he was involved with the Salvation Army. After his move from Sydney to Melbourne in the early 1880s, he attracted many followers. In 1882, he was invited to the Sackville Street Tabernacle, Collingwood. After his authoritarian leadership led to a split in the church, Dowie was fined and jailed for more than a month for leading unauthorized processions. He gave his account of the incident in &quot;Sin in the Camp&quot;.

Dowie developed an interest in faith healing in the early 1880s after witnessing the excitement and cures affected by George Milner Stephen, and he became an independent evangelist, founding the &quot;International Divine Healing Association&quot;. He held meetings in a theater and claimed powers as a faith healer. A businessman signed over a church building to Dowie as his personal property. This insured building then burned down in a suspicious fire that the pro-temperance Dowie blamed on &quot;pro[-]liquor interests&quot;. The event was covered in both local and London newspapers.

=== Free Christian Church of Melbourne ===
Dowie established the Free Christian Church of Melbourne in 1883, which he pastored until he left with his family for the United States via New Zealand in March 1888.

Dowie toured New Zealand in 1887 and early 1888 to conduct a series of meetings to promote faith healing, including one at Christchurch where James Albert Abbott claimed to be instantly healed of his life-threatening afflictions. When Dowie toured New Zealand again early in 1888 on his way to America, he established &quot;The Christchurch Association for the Promotion of Healing through Faith in Jesus&quot;, with Abbott as its founding secretary. Later, in 1888, Abbott arrived in Melbourne to work at the Free Christian Church, where he was elected pastor in 1890.

==Life in the United States==
Dowie immigrated with his family in 1888 to the U.S.

=== California ===
He first settled in San Francisco, California, and built up a following by performing faith healings across the state. His ministry, the &quot;International Divine Healing Association&quot;, was mainly run as a commercial enterprise. All members were expected to tithe. Those who did could request Dowie&#x27;s aid in healing their ills. They made such requests by mail or telegram (or later, by telephone). Dowie prayed in response to requests by paid-up members. Although Dowie funded his lifestyle primarily through tithes, he also liked to buy up securities of bankrupt companies and sell them to his members. Two women whom he had defrauded in this way sued him and won their cases.

=== Chicago ===
After this legal and public relations defeat, Dowie moved to Chicago in 1890. After a few unsuccessful years, he gained fame by his activities on property rented adjacent to the World&#x27;s Fair in 1893. He staged elaborate &quot;Divine Healings&quot; in front of large audiences drawn from attendees to the fair. Many of these &quot;healings&quot; were staged: Dowie used audience plants and other dubious methods. For instance, he arranged for carefully screened individuals to be brought on stage to be healed. Dowie appeared to cure a range of psychosomatic illnesses with his stagecraft.

With the growth of Dowie&#x27;s following in Chicago, in 1894, he established the Zion Tabernacle downtown. He held regular services for large crowds at Chicago&#x27;s Central Music Hall. He launched his own publishing house, Zion Publishing, and started a weekly newsletter titled &quot;Leaves of Healing&quot;.

In 1896, Dowie disbanded the International Divine Healing Association to form the Christian Catholic Church in Zion. He renamed it the Christian Catholic Apostolic Church in 1903.

By the late 1890s, Zion headquarters had moved to the seven-story Zion Home on Michigan Avenue. The building also housed many worshippers in residence from all walks of life; nearby were the New Zion Tabernacle, Zion Junior School, Zion College, Zion Printing, and the Zion Hall of Seventies. Dowie also established the Zion Home of Hope, more Zion Tabernacles, and various healing homes in Chicago. He leased Chicago&#x27;s Auditorium Building to accommodate the swelling crowds attending his services. Beyond Chicago, his teaching spread through evangelists and publications across the U.S. and worldwide. Dowie faced considerable criticism as his following expanded. In 1895, he was in court fighting charges of practicing medicine without a license.

=== City of Zion ===
With a following of approximately 6,000, he sought land north of Chicago and secretly bought a large amount of real estate. In 1900, he announced the founding of Zion, 40 miles from Chicago: he personally owned all the property. He established a theocratic political and economic structure and prohibited smoking, drinking, eating pork, and the practice of any form of modern medicine. He also established a range of businesses, healing homes, and a large Tabernacle. Followers from across the world descended on Zion.

Zion has been characterized as &quot;a carefully-devised large-scale platform for securities fraud requiring significant organizational, legal, and propagandistic preparation to carry out.&quot; To this end, Dowie forced his followers to deposit their funds in Zion Bank. It appeared to be a registered entity but was, in fact, an unincorporated entity under his control. He also sold stock in an array of Zion&#x27;s businesses, which proved worthless. The entire structure of Zion was continually in debt and eventually crashed as Dowie became increasingly senile and unable to handle his affairs.

T. P. O&#x27;Connor, an Irish member of Parliament and journalist, wrote of Dowie: 
The one incomprehensible element in the man&#x27;s gigantic success is the personal luxury in which he lives, and his superb refusal at the same time to account for any of the sums of money entrusted to him. His horses are worth a fortune in themselves; his carriages are emblazoned with armorial bearings; his wife is said to dress with the gorgeous extravagance of an empress. When he travels, hemmed round with a little army of servants, the prophet of humility and self-denial has a special train chartered, and whenever the spiritual burdens become too great a tax there is a delightful country residence belonging to him in which to retreat from the clamour and importunate appeals of the faithful.

His wife and children left him. In 1904, he revisited Adelaide, Australia, but his efforts to conduct services were met with hostility.

In 1905, he suffered a stroke and traveled to Mexico to recuperate. While absent from Chicago, he was deposed from his business affairs by Wilbur Glenn Voliva, his chief lieutenant.

Voliva and official investigators maintained that funds from anywhere from $2.5 to $3.4 million were unaccounted for. Dowie attempted to recover his authority through litigation, but he was ultimately forced to retire and accept an allowance, which was paid until he died in 1907. Dowie is buried in Lake Mound Cemetery, Zion, Illinois.

==Theology and influence==
Dowie was a restorationist and sought to recover the &quot;primitive condition&quot; of the early Christian Church. He believed in an end times restoration of spiritual gifts and apostolic offices to the Church. In 1899, he declared himself &quot;God&#x27;s Messenger,&quot; and in 1901, he proclaimed to be the spiritual return of the Hebrew biblical prophet Elijah, styling himself as &quot;Elijah the Restorer&quot; and the &quot;Third Elijah.&quot; He was also an advocate of divine healing and was highly critical of other teachers on healing. This criticism largely stemmed from differences of opinion on the use of &quot;means&quot; or medicine, for Dowie advocated for total reliance on divine healing and against the use of all forms of medicine. He opened a number of healing homes to which the ill could come for instruction in healing and specific prayer. He emphasized faith in God, &quot;entire consecration&quot;, and holiness.

Dowie was a forerunner of Pentecostalism, and many of his followers became influential figures in the early twentieth-century revival. Although Dowie did not visit South Africa, his emissary Daniel Bryant, between 1904 and 1908, established churches at Wakkerstroom and on the Witwatersrand. After Bryant left, his churches proliferated into a number of denominations of Zionist Churches, all claiming their origin in Zion, Illinois, which together constitute the largest group of Christians in South Africa.

== Publications ==
Dowie published &quot;Rome&#x27;s Polluted Springs&quot; in 1877, the substance of two lectures given at the Masonic Hall, Sydney. In 1879 he published &quot;The Drama, The Press and the Pulpit&quot;, revised reports of two lectures given the previous March.

==Contest with Mirza Ghulam Ahmad==
Dowie is of particular significance to the Ahmadiyya movement in Islam due to a well-publicized contest that took place in the early 1900s between himself and the movement&#x27;s founder Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835–1908). Dowie had claimed to be the forerunner of Jesus of Nazareth&#x27;s Second Coming and was particularly hostile toward Islam, which he believed Jesus would destroy upon his return. In northern India, Ahmad had claimed to be the coming of Jesus in the spirit as well as the promised Mahdi of Islam, who would usher in the final victory of Islam on earth. In 1902, Ahmad invited Dowie to a contest, proposing a &quot;prayer duel&quot; between the two in which both would pray to God that whichever of them was false in his prophetic claim die within the lifetime of the truthful. The challenge attracted some media attention in the United States and was advertised by a number of American newspapers at the time which portrayed the contest as one between two eccentric religious figures. Dowie, however, dismissed the challenge. Ahmad reissued it the following year, adding a unilateral death prophecy. Dowie died in 1907, and Ahmad in 1908.

<text>Edwin Olin Downes, better known as Olin Downes (January 27, 1886 – August 22, 1955), was an American music critic, known as &quot;Sibelius&#x27;s Apostle&quot; for his championship of the music of Jean Sibelius. As critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he exercised considerable influence on musical opinion, although many of his judgments have not stood the test of time.

==Life and works==
Downes was born in Evanston, Illinois, USA. In New York he studied piano at the National Conservatory of Music of America, and in Boston he studied the piano with Carl Baermann and a range of music subjects with Louis Kelterborn (history and analysis), Homer Norris and Clifford Heilman (music theory) and John P. Marshall (music criticism). It was in those two cities that he made his career as a music critic – first with &quot;The Boston Post&quot; (1906–1924) and then with &quot;The New York Times&quot; (1924–1955), where he succeeded Richard Aldrich.

The most conspicuous of Downes&#x27;s topics was the music of Sibelius, about which he wrote admiringly as early as 1907. He met the composer during the latter&#x27;s visit to the U.S. in 1914. After becoming critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Downes sought to counter the prevailing enthusiasm for the music of Stravinsky by inviting Sibelius to make another visit to the U.S., but he could not persuade him to accept the invitation. For his constant proselytizing on Sibelius&#x27;s behalf, Downes was dubbed &quot;Sibelius&#x27;s Apostle&quot;. In 1937 he was appointed Commander of the Order of the White Rose of Finland, in recognition of his promotion of Sibelius&#x27;s music. Downes was a guest speaker at Sibelius&#x27;s 75th birthday celebration in 1940. In addition to scores of articles, Downes published two books on the subject of Sibelius. The first, &quot;Sibelius&quot; (1945), was published in Finnish only: a collection of Downes&#x27;s articles on the subject translated by Paul Sjöblom. The other, &quot;Sibelius the Symphonist&quot; (1956), was Downes&#x27;s last book, published posthumously. In addition to his campaigning for Sibelius, Downes, according to &quot;Baker&#x27;s Biographical Dictionary of Musicians&quot;, did much to advance the cause of other 20th-century composers, including Richard Strauss, Prokofiev, and Shostakovich in the U.S.

&quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; says of Downes that his reviews &quot;strongly influenced contemporary popular musical opinion in the USA&quot; although &quot;the taste defined in them has dated&quot;. He disparaged many composers later held in general esteem, ranging from the romantic to the atonal, including Elgar, Webern and Berg. Of Elgar&#x27;s music he wrote, &quot;it reflects the complacency and stodginess of the era of the antimacassar and pork-pie bonnets; it is affected by the poor taste and the swollen orchestral manner of the post-romantics&quot;. He dismissed Webern&#x27;s Symphony as &quot;one of those whispering, clucking, picking little pieces which Webern composes when he whittles away at small and futile ideas, until he has achieved the perfect fruition of futility and written precisely nothing.&quot; Downes opined that Webern&#x27;s music did not matter, and that the music of Louis Gruenberg was more important. With performers, too, Downes was strongly partisan.

In the 1930s his constant praise of conductor Arturo Toscanini and denigration of John Barbirolli, Toscanini&#x27;s successor as music director of the New York Philharmonic, prompted protest, with Downes&#x27;s &quot;constantly repeated line of hocus-pocus&quot; condemned as &quot;thoroughly nauseating&quot;.

From the 1930s to the 1950s, Downes was the chairman of the &quot;Metropolitan Opera Quiz&quot;, a radio broadcast during the intervals of the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s Saturday afternoon live relays. This position was later taken by his son, musicologist Edward O. D. Downes.

The Cincinnati Conservatory of Music awarded Downes an honorary doctorate in 1939. His papers, housed at the University of Georgia, include about 50,000 letters to and from composers, musicologists, performers and critics.

Downes died in New York City at the age of 69.

<doc id="727378" wikidata="Q1782833" url="?curid=727378" title="Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis">
<text>Constantinos A. Doxiadis (14 May 1913 – 28 June 1975), often cited as C. A. Doxiadis, was a Greek architect and urban planner. During the 1960s, he was the lead architect and planner of Islamabad, which was to serve as the new capital city of Pakistan. He was later known as the father of ekistics, which concerns the multi-aspect science of human settlements.

==Theories==
Doxiadis is the father of &quot;ekistics&quot;, which concerns the science of human settlements, including regional, city, community planning and dwelling design. The term was coined by Doxiadis in 1942 and a major incentive for the development of the science is the emergence of increasingly large and complex settlements, tending to regional conurbations and even to a worldwide city. However, ekistics attempts to encompass all scales of human habitation and seeks to learn from the archaeological and historical record by looking not only at great cities, but, as much as possible, at the total settlement pattern.

Doxiadis also coined the term &quot;entopia&quot;, coming from the Greek words έν (&quot;in&quot;) and τόπος (&quot;place&quot;). He quoted &quot;What human beings need is not utopia (&#x27;no place&#x27;) but entopia (&#x27;in place&#x27;) a real city which they can build, a place which satisfies the dreamer and is acceptable to the scientist, a place where the projections of the artist and the builder merge.&quot;

== Influence ==
In the 1960s and 1970s, urban planner and architect Constantinos Doxiadis authored books, studies, and reports including those regarding the growth potential of the Great Lakes Megalopolis. At the peak of his popularity, in the 1960s, he addressed the US Congress on the future of American cities, his portrait illustrated the front cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, his company Doxiadis Associates was implementing large projects in housing, urban and regional development in more than 40 countries, his Computer Centre (UNIVAC-DACC) was at the cutting edge of the computer technology of his time and at his annual &quot;Delos Symposium&quot; the World Society of Ekistics attracted the worlds foremost thinkers and experts.

In Greece, he faced persistent suspicion and opposition and his recommendations were largely ignored. Having won two large contracts (National Regional Plan for Greece and Master Plan for Athens) from the Greek Junta he was criticised by competitors, after its fall in 1974, portrayed as a friend of the colonels. His visions for Athens airport to be constructed on the adjacent island of Makronissos, where political prisoners were held, together with a bridge, a rail link and a port at Lavrion were never realised.

His influence had already diminished at his death in 1975, as he was unable to speak for the last two years of his life, a victim of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). His company Doxiadis Associates changed owners several times after his death, the heir to his computer company remained but without any links to planning or ekistics. The Delos Symposium was discontinued, and the World Society of Ekistics is today an obscure organisation.

Works about Doxiadis have appeared in the Museum of Brisbane, Milani Gallery, Brisbane and feature in the &quot;To Speak of Cities&quot; exhibition at the University of Queensland Art Museum.

==Works==

One of his best-known town planning works is Islamabad. Designed as a new city it was fully realised, unlike many of his other proposals in already existing cities, where shifting political and economic forces did not allow full implementation of his plans. The plan for Islamabad, separates cars and people, allows easy and affordable access to public transport and utilities and permits low cost gradual expansion and growth without losing the human scale of his &quot;communities&quot;.

In Riyadh, Doxiadis reoriented the city on a southwest-northeast axis, rendering &quot;the planned city... similar to an immense mosque facing Mecca.&quot; His work was also part of the architecture event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics.

<text>Robert Lees (July 10, 1912 – June 13, 2004) was an American television and film screenwriter. Lees was best known for writing comedy, including several Abbott and Costello films.

==Life and career==
Born in San Francisco, California, Lees graduated from Lowell High School in 1929. He started in show business as a dancer before becoming a writer for MGM Studios, where he was paired with writer Frederic Rinaldo. Their first screenplay was for the 1936 short film, &quot;The Perfect Set-Up&quot;. The short film was the first in the &quot;Crime Does Not Pay&quot; series. The series, which was produced by MGM in the 1930s and 1940s, were based on real life crime cases. Lees and Rinaldo continued to work on comedy shorts including, &quot;A Night At The Movies&quot;, starring Robert Benchley, and &quot;Penny Wisdom&quot;. The duo also worked on the 1937 films, &quot;Decathlon Champions&quot; and &quot;Candid Cameramaniacs&quot; from the Pete Smith Specialty series. In 1939, Lees and Rinaldo were nominated for an Academy Award for the 1939 biographical short film, &quot;Prophet Without Honor&quot;.

After completing the comedy short &quot;An Hour For Lunch&quot;, in 1939, Lees and Rinaldo moved on to feature-length films with the 1940 drama, &quot;Street Of Memories&quot;. The pair worked on the sci-fi/horror films, &quot;The Invisible Woman&quot; and &quot;The Black Cat&quot;. In 1941, they wrote their first comedy for Abbott and Costello entitled, &quot;Hold That Ghost&quot;. In the following years, Lees and Rinaldo would go on to write six more movies for the comedy duo, namely, &quot;Hit the Ice&quot;, &quot;Buck Privates Come Home&quot;, &quot;The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap&quot;, &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man&quot;, and &quot;Comin&#x27; Round the Mountain&quot; (1951). In 1952, an unused treatment they wrote for a service comedy at Paramount around 1943 was later adapted as &quot;Jumping Jacks&quot; for another comic duo, Martin and Lewis.

In the early 1950s, Lees&#x27; career was virtually destroyed when he was put on the Hollywood blacklist by movie studio bosses during the McCarthy Era for alleged Communist activities. As a result of his blacklisting, he had associates submit manuscripts to the studios under the pseudonym &quot;J. E. Selby.&quot; Lees also wrote pseudonymously for the British television series, &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; during the blacklist. At age 91 he declared that the speech he delivered in 1951 to the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities was the best thing he ever wrote.

==Retirement==
After retiring from screenwriting in 1983 and becoming associated with sexologist Helen Colton, who would become his girlfriend to the end of his life, he became active in atheist and humanist circles, sometimes speaking at events.

==Murder==
On June 13, 2004, sometime around 11 a.m., Keven Lee Graff, a 27-year-old homeless man, broke into Lees&#x27; home. Graff attacked the 91-year-old Lees and decapitated him. Graff then left the home, carrying Lees&#x27;s severed head, and broke into a neighboring house. The occupant of the home was a 69-year-old retired doctor, Morley Engleson. Graff then attacked and killed Engleson, who was on the telephone making a plane reservation. The Southwest Airlines ticketing agent heard the attack and phoned police. Before police could arrive, Graff stole Engleson&#x27;s 2001 Mercedes-Benz and left the scene.

During a search through Engleson&#x27;s house, police discovered Lees&#x27; severed head lying on a bed. Lees&#x27; longtime girlfriend, Helen Colton, discovered Lees&#x27; headless body, covered by blankets, in his bedroom some five hours later when she arrived to pick Lees up for an event at the Academy headquarters in Beverly Hills.

The following day, Graff caught the attention of security guards at the gates of Paramount Pictures when he began behaving erratically; talking to himself and yelling at passing cars. One security guard identified Graff from a picture that was shown on a televised news conference about the double murders, and phoned police.
When questioned about the crimes, Graff claimed that a man on the streets of Hollywood gave him methamphetamine and Ecstasy the night before the murders claiming he had no memory of committing the murders.

In February 2008, Graff, under a plea bargain, pleaded guilty to ten felonies for the murders of Lees and Engelson. Under the plea agreement, Graff received two consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole.

<text>Erik Gustaf Bernhard Boström (11 February 1842 – 21 February 1907) was a Swedish landowner and politician who was a member of the Swedish Parliament (1876–1907) and the longest-serving Prime Minister of Sweden of the 19th century. He served twice, first from 1891 to 1900 and then again from 1902 to 1905. He was also known as E.G. Boström or E. Gust. Boström.

In 1871, he married Carolina &quot;Lina&quot; Almqvist, with whom he had six daughters and one son. He was the brother of Filip Boström, governor of Södermanland between 1887 and 1908, and of Ebba Boström, and the nephew of the philosopher Christopher Jacob Boström.

Boström&#x27;s governmental policy was marked by its pragmatism. Over time, Boström gained a good reputation as being a rallying national icon despite being the first prime minister to have neither an academic education nor experience with upper governmental positions. He was also quite popular with King Oscar II. Boström&#x27;s eventual downfall was caused by his refusal to budge on the issue of Norway.

==Childhood and career==

Erik Gustaf Boström was born in Stockholm, the son of Eric Samuel Boström, of the district court and his wife Elisabet Gustava Fredenheim. The family was one branch of the Laestadius family of priests from Norrland. His paternal grandfather Christopher Laestander, a townsman and ship carpenter in the city of Piteå, took the surname Boström.

He was tutored by Kristian Claëson, whose first cousin served as the Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs under Boström in 1898. In 1854, he became a student at the Uppsala Cathedral School, which was also the year his father died. Five of his fellow cabinet members during his first term attended the same school: Axel Rappe, Edvard von Krusenstjerna, Ludvig Annerstedt, Gustaf Gilljam and Lars Åkerhielm. In 1861, he transferred to Uppsala University, where he studied until 1863 when his mother died and he had to take over her manor at Östanå Castle.

As a youth he availed himself of the opportunity to pay to avoid conscription, which was last possible in 1872.

Boström was quite successful as a farmer and he started to get involved in local politics. In January 1870, he became a member of the executive committee of the Agricultural Society of Stockholm County and of the county council of Stockholm County, where he also served as vice-chairperson and chairperson for many years. In 1871, he married Carolina Almqvist, daughter of Justice Councillor and Minister Ludvig Almqvist. In 1875, he was elected to the lower house of parliament to represent the judicial district of Södra Roslagen. In parliament, he joined the Lantmanna Party and quickly positioned himself as a leading protectionist, supporting tariff protection, in the Standing Committees of Ways and Means and of Banking. In addition, he was interested in a strong defence, which he considered to have manifested itself as a strong marine defence, and a strong opposition to the abolition of the Swedish allotment system.

== Chancellor of the Swedish Universities 1905–1907 ==
After he retired from his position as Prime Minister, Boström became the Chancellor of the Swedish Universities, where he tried unsuccessfully to prevent Bengt Lidforss from continuing on as associate professor at Lund University. He then tendered his resignation from his position as chancellor, although he quickly retracted it. Boström continued to be interested in politics and in a letter that he wrote to his dear old friend Carl Herslow on 4 June, he stated that it would be extremely desirable for the recently retired government to have been able to stay on. He also said in a letter that Karl Staaff&#x27;s government could take of social policy better than a conservative government could and that Staaff occasionally appeared to possess the ability to accomplish a lot, although he chose a different way. Boström died in his home in Stockholm on 21 February 1907. A few days later, the bells pealed out over Stockholm to commemorate the former Prime Minister.

==Family==

<text>Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla (22 March 183313 June 1895) was a Spanish politician. He served as Prime Minister of Spain for a little over ten weeks, in the summer of 1871, and again for eight months, between June 1872 and February 1873.

==Biography==
Born in Burgo de Osma, he was educated at Valladolid and studied law at the Central University of Madrid, where he leaned towards radicalism in politics. In 1856, he was elected deputy and soon attracted notice among the most advanced Progressists and Democrats.

Ruiz Zorrilla took part in the revolutionary propaganda that led to the military movement in Madrid on 22 June 1866. He had to take refuge in France for two years, like his fellow conspirators, but he returned to Spain when the revolution of 1868 took place. He was one of the members of the first cabinet after the revolution, and in 1869, under the regency of Marshal Serrano, he became Minister of Grace and Justice. In 1870, he was elected President of the Congress of Deputies and seconded Juan Prim in offering the throne to Amadeus of Savoy. He went to Italy as President of the Commission and carried, to the Prince at Florence, the official news of his election.

Initiated as Freemason in the &quot;Mantuana&quot; Lodge in Madrid by July 1870, Ruiz Zorrilla (symbol: &quot;Cavour&quot;; degree: 33) barely took days to become Grand Master of the Grand Lodge in a process full of irregularities, serving in that capacity until 1 January 1874. Ruiz Zorrilla did not actually preside over nor attend the meetings, and successively delegated the chair of the lodge to Simón Gris Benítez, and José Carvajal.

On the arrival of Amadeus in Spain, Ruiz Zorrilla became Minister of Public Works for a short time before resigning in protest against Serrano and Topete entering the councils of the new king. Six months later, in 1871, he was invited by Amadeus to form a cabinet, and he continued to be the principal councillor of the king until February 1873, when the monarch abdicated.

After the departure of Amadeus, Ruiz Zorrilla advocated the establishment of a republic, but he was not called upon either by the Federal Republicans to help them during 1873 or by Marshal Serrano in 1874 to join Martos and Sagasta in his cabinet. Immediately after the Restoration of the monarchy, early in 1875, Ruiz Zorrilla again went to France.

He was for nearly 18 years the soul of the republican conspiracies, the prompter of revolutionary propaganda and the chief inspirer of intrigues concerted by discontented military men of all ranks. He gave so much trouble to the Madrid governments that they organized a watch over him with the assistance of the French government and police, especially when it was discovered that the two military movements of August 1883 and September 1886 had been prepared and assisted by him. During the last two years of his life, he became less active. Failing health and the loss of his wife had decreased his energies, and the Madrid government allowed him to return to Spain some months before he died at Burgos, of heart disease.

<text>In digital electronics, especially computing, hardware registers are circuits typically composed of flip-flops, often with many characteristics similar to memory, such as:
* Store a string of bits.
* The ability to read or write multiple bits at a time, and
* Using an address to select a particular register in a manner similar to a memory address.

Their distinguishing characteristic, however, is that they also have special hardware-related functions beyond those of ordinary memory. So, depending on the point of view, hardware registers are like memory with additional hardware-related functions; or, memory circuits are like hardware registers that just store data.

Hardware registers are used in the interface between software and peripherals. Software writes them to send information to the device, and reads them to get information from the device. Some hardware devices also include registers that are not visible to software, for their internal use.

Depending on their complexity, modern hardware devices can have many registers. Standard integrated circuits typically document their externally-exposed registers as part of their electronic component datasheet.

== Functionality ==
Typical uses of hardware registers include:

* &quot;configuration&quot; and start-up of certain features, especially during initialization
* &quot;buffer storage&quot; e.g. video memory for graphics cards
* input/output (I/O) of different kinds
* &quot;status reporting&quot; such as whether a certain event has occurred in the hardware unit, for example a modem status register or a line status register.

Reading a hardware register in &quot;peripheral units&quot; — computer hardware outside the CPU — involves accessing its memory-mapped I/O address or port-mapped I/O address with a &quot;load&quot; or &quot;store&quot; instruction, issued by the processor. Hardware registers are addressed in words, but sometimes only use a few bits of the word read in to, or written out to the register.

Commercial design tools simplify and automate memory-mapped register specification and code generation for hardware, firmware, hardware verification, testing and documentation.

Registers can be read/write, read-only or write-only.

Write-only registers are generally avoided. They are suitable for registers that cause a transient action when written but store no persistent data to be read, such as a &quot;reset a peripheral&quot; register. They may be the only option in designs that cannot afford gates for the relatively large logic circuit and signal routing needed for register data readback, such as the Atari 2600 games console&#x27;s TIA chip. However, write-only registers make debugging more difficult and lead to the read-modify-write problem so read/write registers are preferred. On PCs, write-only registers made it difficult for the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) to determine the device&#x27;s state when entering sleep mode in order to restore that state when exiting sleep mode.

== Register varieties ==

The hardware registers inside a central processing unit (CPU) are called processor registers.

Strobe registers have the same interface as normal hardware registers, but instead of storing data, they trigger an action each time they are written to (or, in rare cases, read from). They are a means of signaling.

Registers are normally measured by the number of bits they can hold, for example, an &quot;8-bit register&quot; or a &quot;32-bit register&quot;.

Designers can implement registers in a wide variety of ways, including:

* register files
* standard SRAM
* individual flip-flops
* high-speed core memory

In addition to the &quot;programmer-visible&quot; registers that can be read and written with software, many chips have internal registers that are used for state machines and pipelining; for example, registered memory.

== Standards ==
SPIRIT IP-XACT and DITA SIDSC XML define standard XML formats for memory-mapped registers.

* Processor register
* Register-transfer level (RTL)

<text>Sergei Vasilyevich Zubatov (; April 7 [March 26 O.S.], 1864 – March 15, 1917) was a Russian Empire police administrator, best known as the advocate of &quot;police socialism&quot;, which included creating legal, police-controlled trade unions.

==Biography==
Born in Moscow as the son of a police chief, Sergei Zubatov became involved in revolutionary circles as a schoolboy and was expelled at the age of 16 at his father&#x27;s instigation. His father also made him marry an army officer&#x27;s daughter, , in the hope that marriage would keep him out of trouble. Instead, the couple ran a bookshop that became a gathering place for revolutionaries. In 1886, if not earlier, he was persuaded by N. S. Berdyaev, the head of the Moscow Okhrana, the department responsible for suppressing the revolutionary movement, to become an informant, under the threat of expulsion from Moscow. Information that he passed to the police led to the closure of three illegal printing-shops and to the arrests of several revolutionaries, including Mikhail Gots. By 1888 rumours about his double life had spread through revolutionary circles, so he stopped acting as a spy, and in 1889 joined the staff of the Okhrana. He systematized security policing in Russia, using the typical methods then prevalent in Europe of plainclothes police-detectives (known in Russia as &quot;filyory&quot; - ), whose actions he coordinated with the centerpiece of his system, undercover informants (секретные сотрудники). He was a master at interrogating radical activists and occasionally winning them over to his side, arguing that the Russian Empire could do more for the poor than could terrorists and agitators who would only bring down upon the people the heavy hand of reaction.

Despite rumors, Zubatov was never a Colonel (Polkovnik) in the Special Corps of Gendarmes, but he was rapidly promoted so that in 1896, at the age of 32, he was appointed head of the Moscow Okhrana Bureau, making him the official in charge of investigating and suppressing political dissent in Russia&#x27;s second city.

Despite his deeply-held monarchist convictions, Zubatov earnestly believed that repression alone could not crush the revolutionary movement. Between 1901 and 1903 he therefore also promoted the organization of pro-government trade unions to channel protest away from agitation - a practice revolutionary activists called &quot;police socialism&quot; or lambasted as Zubatovshchina ().

In February 1901 the Tsarist authorities brought in Cossacks to suppress mass demonstrations by thousands of students and workers in Moscow. In May 1901 the Moscow Chief of Police, General Dmitri Feodorovich Trepov, allowed &quot;the Community of Mutual Help of the Workers in Mechanized Industry&quot; () to hold its inaugural meeting in Moscow. With Zubatov&#x27;s support, the society was created by self-educated factory workers, who were paid a stipend by the Okhrana. The new body provoked objections from factory owners (who claimed that it was inciting unrest), and from factory inspectors (who felt that it undermined their authority). The Prime Minister, Count Sergei Witte, backed the objections, but was unable to close down the experiment because Zubatov had the backing of the Tsar&#x27;s uncle, Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich, the Governor-General of Moscow. On 19 February 1902, Zubatov succeeded in orchestrating a loyal demonstration with religious overtones by about 50,000 workers, outside the Kremlin, in honour of the former Emperor Alexander II - despite a call from the Moscow committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party to boycott the ceremony.

In August 1902 the Minister of the Interior, Plehve transferred Zubatov to Saint Petersburg as head of a special police department,
but his attempts to introduce &#x27;police socialism&#x27; in the capital city were hindered by the greater awareness and suspicion of police agents. Other societies similar to the Moscow model formed in Odessa, and Kiev. In Minsk, Zubatov encouraged the creation of the Jewish Independent Labour Party, to counter the influence of the Marxist General Jewish Labour Bund, and the holding of the first legal Zionist Congress, in 1902. But Zubatov proved unable to persuade the government to enact any actual improvement in labour legislation. In July 1903, thousands of workers took part in a general strike in Odessa which lasted two weeks before being violently repressed by police and Cossacks. A month later, on 19 August 1903, Interior Minister Vyacheslav von Plehve summoned Zubatov, accused him of fomenting strikes and betraying secrets, sacked him, and banned him from living in the Saint Petersburg or Moscow Governorates. The state-sponsored trade unions were disbanded. Many of their members joined the organization of Georgy Gapon, who led a demonstration of workers to present a petition to the Emperor at the Winter Palace which led to the Bloody Sunday massacre of January 1905 and the beginning of the 1905 Russian Revolution. After the assassination of Plehve in July 1904, Zubatov was allowed back into the capital and invited to rejoin the police, but he refused, partly in order to protect the life of his son, whom he feared revolutionary activists might threaten. He retired to private life, living off his state pension.

Zubatov committed suicide during the February Revolution of March 1917 after hearing the news of the Emperor&#x27;s abdication.

<text>David Samuel Zucker (born October 16, 1947) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. Associated mostly with parody comedies, Zucker is recognized for collaborating with Jim Abrahams and his brother Jerry as part of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker, with whom he wrote and directed the 1980 film &quot;Airplane!&quot; and created &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; franchise. As a solo filmmaker, Zucker has also directed &quot;Scary Movie 3&quot; (2003) and &quot;Scary Movie 4&quot; (2006).

==Career==
Zucker&#x27;s movies include &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; in 1977, &quot;Ruthless People&quot; in 1986, &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; in 1988, &quot;The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear&quot; in 1991, &quot;BASEketball&quot; in 1998, &quot;Scary Movie 3&quot; in 2003, and its sequel &quot;Scary Movie 4&quot; in 2006. Of 18 works with which he is associated,&quot; Phone Booth&quot;, which he produced in 2002 is the only non-comedic film.

He co-directed several films including &quot;Airplane!&quot; in 1980 and &quot;Top Secret!&quot; in 1984; along with his brother, Jerry, and Jim Abrahams, the trio make up the &quot;ZAZ&quot; team of directors. He has worked with Pat Proft (with whom he first teamed up on the &quot;Naked Gun&quot; show &quot;Police Squad!&quot;) and Craig Mazin (writer of three of the five &quot;Scary Movies&quot;). In 1987, both David and Jerry Zucker through Zucker Brothers Productions signed an agreement with Paramount Pictures for a two-year non-exclusive production agreement and development deal with the studio, and the brothers had anticipated on making four comedies for Paramount Pictures during the life of the pact. The first film was a feature film version of the early 1980s television show &quot;Police Squad!&quot;, which was originally cancelled after six episodes on the air.

ZAZ and Proft helped develop the parody genre of films, in which jokes are spit out with rapid-fire, using puns, physical humor, wit, and double entendres. Some of the veteran actors of ZAZ&#x27;s vision of parody include Leslie Nielsen, Lloyd Bridges, Charlie Sheen, Julie Hagerty, and Anna Faris (Faris starred in four of the &quot;Scary Movie&quot; series).

Looking back on his career in 2009, Leslie Nielsen said the best film he appeared in was &quot;The Naked Gun&quot;, and that David was his favorite director to work with. Nielsen said of him, &quot;He came to me one time and said, &#x27;Leslie, I&#x27;ll never make you do anything that is not funny.&#x27; ... he kept his word.&quot; Most consider his greatest work to be &quot;Airplane!&quot;, which has brought on many accolades (including preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress).

In his movies, his mother, Charlotte often made cameos (like the lady trying to put on make-up in &quot;Airplane!&quot; and Vincent Ludwig&#x27;s secretary, Dominique, in &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot;).

David Zucker is an aficionado of Davy Crockett and collects memorabilia. He has said that his dream project is to make a biographical film, which he has spent time developing. During the 1990s he regularly hosted a Davy Crockett Rifle Frolic at his ranch in Ojai, California. Zucker wrote 11 updated verses to the song &quot;The Ballad of Davy Crockett&quot;, which he claimed in 1992 that he had worked harder on those than on any of his scripts. He made a cameo appearance in &quot;The Naked Gun 2½&quot; dressed as Crockett.

Zucker began to focus more on politics starting in 2004 when he began working on political ads for the Republican Party. In 2008, he made the political parody movie &quot;An American Carol&quot;. In 2015, he made a video he called &quot;Side Effects&quot; attacking President Barack Obama for the Iran nuclear deal in the form of a parody prescription drug ad. In 2017, Zucker said that he was working on a script for a fourth &quot;Naked Gun&quot; film with Pat Proft. In 2018 he made a cameo appearance on the hidden camera TV series &quot;Impractical Jokers&quot;, where he was on FaceTime with cast member James Murray in a sketch trying to make the other person laugh.

In 2021, Zucker announced his return to filmmaking with a new spoof film titled &quot;The Star of Malta&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Zucker was born to a Jewish family in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the son of Charlotte Zucker and Burton C. Zucker, who was a real estate developer. He graduated from Shorewood High School. In 1997, David married Danielle Zucker, with whom he has two children, Charles and Sarah. He and Danielle were divorced in 2019, although they had been separated for ten years before that. His younger brother, Jerry, is his filmmaking partner. The Zucker brothers have a sister, Susan Breslau. When asked in a September 2014 interview by the BBC if he believes in God, David replied:
=== Environmentalism ===
David Zucker has been an active supporter of TreePeople since 1988 and is now the longest continuously serving board member (1990) in the organization&#x27;s history.

He has been an advocate of solar-powered and electric cars since the &#x27;90s. &quot;I can&#x27;t complain about the smog in Los Angeles if I&#x27;m contributing to it,&quot; Zucker said to the Sun Sentinel in 1990.

== Recurring cast members==
Among all of his directed and/or produced parody films, Zucker had frequently cast the late Leslie Nielsen.

<doc id="727427" wikidata="Q106170" url="?curid=727427" title="Riggs Bank">
<text>Riggs Bank was a bank headquartered in Washington, D.C. For most of its history, it was the largest bank headquartered in that city. On May 13, 2005, after the exposure of several money laundering scandals, the bank was acquired by PNC Financial Services.

The bank was known for handling the personal financial affairs of many U.S. Presidents and many embassies in Washington, D.C. Twenty-three U.S. Presidents or their families banked at Riggs, including Martin Van Buren, John Tyler, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Richard Nixon. Accounts were also held by Senators Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun and Daniel Webster, Confederate president Jefferson Davis, American Red Cross founder Clara Barton, suffragist Susan B. Anthony, and generals William Tecumseh Sherman and Douglas MacArthur.

The bank billed itself as &quot;the most important bank in the most important city in the world&quot;. Its DC headquarters were pictured on the back of an old ten dollar bill.

The bank was investigated for several money laundering scandals, including going to great lengths to allow former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to hide his fortune after his accounts were subjected to asset freezing and for unknowingly allowing the hijackers involved in the September 11 attacks to transfer money due to lax controls at the bank.

==History==
In 1836, William Wilson Corcoran opened a small brokerage house. In 1840, Corcoran and George Washington Riggs, the son of Elisha Riggs, a neighbor, formed &quot;Corcoran &amp; Riggs&quot;, which offered checking and depositing services.

In 1844, the U.S. government allowed Corcoran &amp; Riggs to be the only federal depository in Washington, significantly increasing business.

In 1845, Corcoran &amp; Riggs financed Samuel Morse&#x27;s invention of the telegraph and moved into a new headquarters at 1503–1505 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, directly across the street from the United States Department of the Treasury.

In 1847, the bank lent $16 million to the U.S. government to pay for the Mexican–American War.

In 1854, Corcoran retired, and George Washington Riggs re-assumed leadership. The bank changed its name to &quot;Riggs &amp; Company&quot;.

In 1868, the bank provided $7.2 million in gold towards the purchase of Alaska.

In the 1860s, the bank financed Robert Peary&#x27;s first expedition to the North Pole and the expansion of the United States Capitol.

In 1881, George Washington Riggs died.

In 1891, the new Riggs Bank building in Washington was opened, built in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. 

In 1896, after accepting a government charter, &quot;Riggs National Bank&quot; was formed, and Charles C. Glover was named president. In 1898, Lawrason Riggs resigned from the board of directors, ending the involvement of the Riggs family in the bank.

In 1909, the president of the bank presented to the United States Congress an economic plan that resulted in the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913.

During World War I, the bank participated in a Liberty bond drive. In the 1920s, the bank established a new savings deposit system due to the large deposit boom. During the Great Depression, Riggs director Robert V. Fleming acted as adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

In 1922, the bank acquired Hamilton Savings Bank; it opened a branch in Dupont Circle. The bank also constructed the Riggs-Tompkins Building, which was at the time the largest building in Columbia Heights.

In 1925, it acquired Northwest National Bank, and in 1928, it acquired Farmers and Mechanics National Bank, which included William Marbury on its board of directors. In 1933, Riggs acquired a portion of the assets of Chevy Chase Savings Bank.

Beginning in the early 20th century, the bank embarked on a successful project to attract embassies and diplomats as customers, and by 1950, most embassies in Washington were customers of the bank.

In the 1950s, the bank opened an office at Walter Reed Hospital.

In 1954, Riggs acquired Washington Loan and Trust; in 1958, it acquired Lincoln National Bank.

In 1981, Joe Allbritton acquired a controlling interest in the bank and became chairman.

In 1983, due to the change in control, several executives, including chairman Vincent C. Burke, resigned.

In 1986, the bank expanded into Northern Virginia with the acquisition of Guaranty Bank and Trust Company for $37.8 million.

In 1990, the bank acquired The Bank of Washington.

In 1993, Joe Allbritton resigned as chief executive officer of the bank after it suffered during the savings and loan crisis.

On May 13, 2005, after the exposure of several money laundering scandals, the bank was acquired by PNC Financial Services.

==Scandals==

===Saudi money transfers before the September 11 attacks===
In 2000, Omar al-Bayoumi opened bank accounts for two of the hijackers involved with the September 11 attacks. Shortly thereafter, Al-Bayoumi&#x27;s wife received payments totaling tens of thousands of dollars from Princess Haifa bint Faisal, the wife of Saudi Arabian ambassador Bandar bin Sultan through a Riggs bank account.

Upon discovery of these transactions, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began investigating the bank for possible money laundering and terrorist financing. Although the FBI and later the 9/11 Commission ultimately stated that the money was not intentionally being routed to fund terrorists, investigators were surprised at the lax safeguards at the bank. Several Saudi accounts were discovered to have financial improprieties, including a lack of required background checks. Regulators were not alerted to large transactions that violated federal banking laws.

Many of these transactions involved Prince Bandar personally, often transferring over $1 million at a time. According to British investigations on the Al-Yamamah arms deal, Bandar received over $1.5 billion in bribery from BAE Systems, laundered through Riggs Bank.

===Hiding the fortune of Augusto Pinochet===

Augusto Pinochet, the former dictator of Chile, was widely accused of corruption, illegal arms sales, and torture. In 1994, Riggs officials invited Pinochet to open an account at the bank. In 1998, Pinochet was arrested in the United Kingdom for possible extradition to Spain, and his accounts were subjected to asset freezing by court orders. By using a shell company and hiding accounts from federal regulators, Riggs illegally allowed Pinochet to hide and retain access to much of his fortune.

Regulators were also found to be negligent in holding the bank accountable. The bank examiner from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency tasked with investigating Riggs in 2002, R. Ashley Lee, was later given an executive position at Riggs. In 2004, Lee was placed on paid leave by the bank pending a United States Department of Justice investigation on whether he violated government ethics rules.

The disclosure of the Riggs accounts reignited the case against General Pinochet. A ruling that he was mentally incompetent to stand trial was overturned when it was proven that the general had personally orchestrated some of the enormous transactions. In 2004, Pinochet was ordered to stand trial for crimes against humanity, and additional claims of mental and physical incompetence were overruled. However, Pinochet died in December 2006 before being judged. In September 2007, Pinochet&#x27;s widow and five children were indicted by a Chilean court on charges including embezzlement.

In January 2005, the bank pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $16 million in fines for helping Pinochet. The bank and the Albritton family, which controlled the bank, agreed to pay $9 million to victims of the regime of Pinochet. The bank also paid $8 million to settle the legal case in Spain.

===Embezzlement of oil revenues from Equatorial Guinea===
In July 2004, the United States Senate published a report that showed that at least $35 million was siphoned off by Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, the long-time dictator of Equatorial Guinea, from the account held by the Embassy of Equatorial Guinea in Washington, D.C., at Riggs.

Simon P. Kareri, the Riggs employee in charge of the Equatorial Guinea and other accounts, was accused of money-laundering in separate charges. As the account manager, he allegedly established a fake holding company in his wife&#x27;s name and diverted funds into this account. In a hearing by the United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Kareri, under advisement from legal counsel, refused to answer any questions of the panel by invoking his rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

In May 2004, the bank was fined $25 million by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for violations of money-laundering laws. 

A long-running Justice Department investigation was wrapped up quickly in February 2005 with Riggs pleading guilty and paying a $16 million fine for violations of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act after a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article reported December 31, 2004, that Riggs had extensive ties to the CIA, including that several bank officials held security clearances. Also, in February 2005, the bank and the Albritton family agreed to pay $9 million to Pinochet&#x27;s victims for concealing and illegally facilitating the movement of Pinochet&#x27;s money out of Britain. No similar payment has been made concerning Equatorial Guinea, as reported in this weekly Anti-Money Laundering Report from the Fair Finance Watch. The abuses at Riggs led Congress to consider forming a single agency with greater authority to enforce money laundering and currency control laws. Daniel E. Stipano, deputy chief counsel for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said, &quot;What happened with Riggs is unacceptable. It cannot be repeated.&quot; 
Riggs admitted criminal liability for failing to prevent money laundering.

===Acquisition by PNC===
In the wake of the money laundering scandals, members of the Albritton family resigned from the bank board. On February 10, 2005, PNC Financial Services agreed to acquire Riggs, and the merger was completed on May 13, 2005. The Riggs name was retired and all Riggs branches became PNC Bank branches three days later. Soon after the merger&#x27;s completion, PNC phased out the scandal-plagued embassy business.

<doc id="727428" wikidata="Q363666" url="?curid=727428" title="Jerry Zucker">
<text>Jerry Gordon Zucker (born March 11, 1950) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. He is one third of the filmmaking trio Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker. He is best known for his role in writing and directing comedy spoof films like &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980) and &quot;Top Secret!&quot; (1984), and for co-creating the television series &quot;Police Squad!,&quot; which was later adapted into the &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; film series. He is also the director of the Academy Award-winning supernatural drama film &quot;Ghost&quot; (1990).

==Early life==
Zucker was born to a Jewish family in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the son of Charlotte A. (Lefstein) (d. 2007) and Burton C. Zucker, who was a real estate developer. He graduated from Shorewood High School. His paternal grandfather was Leonard Zucker who emigrated from Russia to the United States and became a naturalized citizen.

== Career ==
Zucker&#x27;s early career work started with Jim Abrahams and brother David Zucker. The trio performed in Madison, Wisconsin as a sketch and comedy troupe called &quot;Kentucky Fried Theater&quot;. They later adapted several of these sketches into a comedy anthology film, &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot;, directed by John Landis and released in 1977.

From there the three went on and together co-directed &quot;Airplane!&quot; in 1980 and then went on to do &quot;Top Secret!&quot; in 1984, and &quot;Ruthless People&quot; in 1986. Along with Jim Abrahams, the Zuckers constitute the &quot;ZAZ&quot; team of directors. 

In 1987, both Jerry and David Zucker through Zucker Brothers Productions had inked an agreement with Paramount Pictures for a two-year non-exclusive production agreement and development deal with the studio. The brothers had anticipated cranking out four comedies for Paramount Pictures during the life of the pact; the first film was a feature film version of the early 1980s television show &quot;Police Squad!&quot;, which was originally cancelled after six episodes on the air. 

In 1990, he lent his directorial skills to the dramatic genre with &quot;Ghost&quot;, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. Zucker&#x27;s most recent directorial effort is the 2001 film &quot;Rat Race&quot;.

Zucker&#x27;s films have been ranked among the greatest comedies of all time: &quot;Airplane!&quot; was ranked at the top of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&#x27;s&quot; list of best comedy films and AFI listed it as #10; &quot;Top Secret!&quot; made &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Top 100 list.

== Personal life ==
Like his brother David Zucker, Jerry often cast his mother, Charlotte (who died in 2007), and his sister, Susan Breslau, in small roles in his films.

<doc id="727432" wikidata="Q11693671" url="?curid=727432" title="Mortimer Zuckerman">
<text>Mortimer Benjamin Zuckerman (born June 4, 1937) is a Canadian-American billionaire media proprietor, magazine editor, and investor. He is the co-founder, executive chairman and former CEO of Boston Properties, one of the largest real estate investment trusts in the US. Zuckerman is also the owner and publisher of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, where he serves as editor-in-chief. He formerly owned the &quot;New York Daily News,&quot; &quot;The Atlantic,&quot; and &quot;Fast Company&quot;. As of August 2024, his net worth is estimated at US$2.6 billion.

==Early life and education==
Zuckerman was born on June 4, 1937, in Montreal, Canada, the son of Esther and Abraham Zuckerman, who owned a tobacco and candy store. His family is Jewish, and his grandfather was an Orthodox rabbi. Zuckerman entered McGill University in Montreal at the age of 16. He graduated from McGill with a BA in 1957 and a BCL in 1961, although he never took the bar exam. That same year, Zuckerman entered the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where he earned an MBA degree with a distinction of honor. In 1962, he received an LLM degree from Harvard Law School.

==Business career==
After graduating, Zuckerman remained at Harvard Business School as an associate professor for nine years. He also taught at Yale University. Zuckerman spent seven years at the real estate firm Cabot, Cabot &amp; Forbes, where he rose to the position of senior vice president and chief financial officer.

In 1980, he purchased the literary magazine &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, where he was the chairman from 1980 to 1999. In 1999 he sold the magazine to David G. Bradley for US$12 million. Commenting on this sale and that of &quot;Fast Company&quot; magazine, which he sold for $365 million at the height of the tech boom in 2000, he quipped, &quot;I averaged out.&quot;

While he still owned &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, in 1984, Zuckerman bought &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, where he remains its editor-in-chief. In 1993, he bought the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, which he ran until 2017 when he sold the paper to Tronc.

==Politics==
In addition to his publishing and real-estate interests, Zuckerman is also a frequent commentator on world affairs, both as an editorialist and on television. He regularly appeared on &quot;MSNBC&quot; and &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; and writes columns for &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; and the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;.

Zuckerman has varied in his party affiliations over time, since the late 1970s.

On July 12, 2010, Zuckerman said in an interview that he had helped to write one of President Barack Obama&#x27;s political speeches. Long-time Obama speechwriters Jon Favreau and Ben Rhodes disputed that and asserted that neither &quot;has ever met or spoken to Mort Zuckerman.&quot; Zuckerman later published a clarification of his remarks by stating that his help had come in the form of private conversations with various political officials in which he had offered advice and perspective on different issues.

Zuckerman, a long-time supporter of the Democratic party who cast his vote for Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election, was critical of President Obama on several fronts. Following the downgrade of US treasury debt by Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s in 2011, Zuckerman wrote in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;: &quot;I long for a triple-A president to run a triple-A country.&quot; After initially supporting Obama&#x27;s call for heavy infrastructure spending to revive the economy, Zuckerman criticized the composition of the plan: &quot;if you look at the make-up of the stimulus program, roughly half of it went to state and local municipalities, which is in effect to the municipal unions which are at the core of the Democratic party.&quot;

On Obama&#x27;s healthcare reform bill, Zuckerman stated, &quot;Eighty percent of the country wanted them to get costs under control, not to extend the coverage. They used all their political capital to extend the coverage. I always had the feeling the country looked at the bill and said, &#x27;Well, he may be doing it because he wants to be a transformational president, but I want to get my costs down!&#x27;&quot;

==Personal life==
Before marrying, Zuckerman&#x27;s dating history included writers Betty Rollin, Nora Ephron, Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington and a four-year relationship with feminist activist Gloria Steinem in the late 1980s, early 1990s.

In 1996 Zuckerman married Marla Prather, a curator of the National Gallery of Art. The couple divorced in 2001, and Prather later married lawyer Jonathan D. Schiller.

Zuckerman became a US citizen in 1977.

He owns houses in New York City, East Hampton, New York and Aspen, Colorado. He also keeps a 166-foot Oceanco Yacht, the &quot;Lazy Z&quot;. For transportation, he previously owned a Falcon 900 corporate jet but has recently purchased a Gulfstream G550.

On the November 28, 2014, episode of &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot;, Zuckerman said he was a vegan and has been since 2008, confirming what in November 2010 had been published in &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot;, &quot;The Rise of the Power Vegans.&quot; Zuckerman last appeared on &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; on July 31, 2015, making a case for Texas governor Rick Perry&#x27;s presidential run during that episode. A day later Zuckerman issued a statement that he would not be appearing at the East Hampton Artists-Writers softball game, the first time he would miss the game since 1993. The same month, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported he turned over the sale of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; to his nephews and has commented minimally on its dissolution.

==Philanthropy==
In May 2004, Zuckerman pledged $10 million to Harvard University to fund a fellowship for students who are pursuing or have earned professional degree in law, business or medicine but are interested in a degree at Harvard’s Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, or the Harvard Kennedy School. The Zuckerman Fellowship funds a scholarship for full tuition, fees, and health insurance plus an annual stipend for one academic year.

In May 2006, Zuckerman pledged $100 million from his charitable trust towards Memorial Sloan Kettering&#x27;s new cancer research facility. His donation was the largest single commitment by an individual in Memorial Sloan Kettering&#x27;s history.

In December 2012, Zuckerman pledged $200 million to endow the Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia University.

==Involvement in Jewish organizations and Israel==
Between 2001 and 2003, Zuckerman was the chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Typically, the nominating committee attempts to choose a person who is both respected and uncontroversial. However, Zuckerman was widely opposed by liberal Jewish factions. Nonetheless, Zuckerman was eventually elected and served a full term.

In their 2006 paper &quot;The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy&quot;, John Mearsheimer, political science professor at the University of Chicago, and Stephen Walt, academic dean of the Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University, named Zuckerman a member of the media wing of the &quot;Israeli lobby&quot; in the United States. Zuckerman replied: &quot;I would just say this: The allegations of this disproportionate influence of the Jewish community remind me of the 92-year-old man sued in a paternity suit. He said he was so proud, he pleaded guilty.&quot;

George W. Bush appointed Zuckerman to serve on the Honorary Delegation to accompany him to Jerusalem for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel in May 2008.

==Appointments and associations==
Zuckerman serves on the boards of trustees of several educational and private institutions such as New York University, the Aspen Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, and the Center for Communications. He is a member of the JPMorgan&#x27;s National Advisory Board, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, and the International Institute for Strategic Studies. He has been a president of the board of trustees of the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.

Zuckerman is known to be a mentor to and close associate of Daniel M. Snyder, former owner of the NFL football team Washington Commanders, and has been a financial backer to Snyder&#x27;s business ventures (&quot;CampusUSA&quot; magazine), and was a shareholder and director in Snyder Communications Inc., a marketing services business which was taken over in 2000 (by Havas Advertising).

==Honors==
Zuckerman has received three honorary degrees, including one from Colby College. He was awarded Commandeur de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the government of France in 1994, a lifetime achievement award from Guild Hall and a gold medal from the American Institute of Architecture in New York.

==Bernard Madoff investment scandal==
Zuckerman is one of the investors defrauded in a &quot;Ponzi scheme&quot;, by way of investments with Fifth Avenue Synagogue president J. Ezra Merkin who staked roughly 10% ($30 million) of Zuckerman&#x27;s charitable trust fund with convicted scammer Bernard Madoff. Zuckerman has stated that all current charitable obligations will still be honored with no changes. At a forum at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York, he remarked that no one since Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, executed in 1953 for giving atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, &quot;has so damaged the image and self respect of American Jews.&quot;

On April 6, 2009, Zuckerman filed a lawsuit against Merkin and his Gabriel Capital LP. The lawsuit claims fraud and negligent representation and seeks unspecified punitive damages. Merkin had a &quot;huge incentive not to disclose Madoff&#x27;s role, especially to investors like Zuckerman&quot; because he charged clients &quot;substantial fees&quot; to manage both his Ascot Partners LP and Gabriel Capital. The lawsuit claims over US$40 million in losses for placing his assets with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC without his knowledge. Zuckerman invested US$25 million with Merkin&#x27;s Ascot Fund in 2006 through his Charitable Remainder Trust or CRT Investments Limited and personally invested US$15 million with Merkin&#x27;s Gabriel Capital. Merkin charged Zuckerman a 1.5% fee and imposed significant &quot;lock-up restrictions on redemptions&quot;, but his agreement with Gabriel Capital contains an arbitration clause against Merkin for his lost personal US$15 million investment. The lawsuit also named the accounting firm BDO Seidman LLP and a related entity called BDO Tortuga as defendants.

The case is &quot;CRT Investments Ltd. v. J. Ezra Merkin&quot;, 601052/2009, filed in New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).

==2010 Senate election==

Although Zuckerman has been known as a Democrat, he was speculated to run for the Senate in 2010 as a Republican or an independent in order to avoid an expensive primary.

Critics pointed to apparent inconsistencies in Zuckerman&#x27;s publicly stated positions on key issues. Wayne Barrett, of the &quot;Village Voice&quot; wrote: &quot;If real estate titan Mort Zuckerman gets into the senate race against Kirsten Gillibrand, we&#x27;ll finally have a vigorous debate about the big-ticket issues troubling Americans. All we have to do is listen to Mort and we&#x27;ll get both sides of the key economic questions.&quot;

However, on March 2, 2010, he declined to run, citing family and work obligations.

<doc id="727442" wikidata="Q455914" url="?curid=727442" title="Vodka Red Bull">
<text>Vodka Red Bull (alternatively Red Bull Vodka) is a caffeinated alcoholic drink consisting of the energy drink Red Bull and varying amounts of vodka. 

Red Bull has been used as a general mixer in alcoholic beverages in Europe since the 1980s, though not specifically with vodka. However, the drink became especially popular in the US, following its invention by Matt Pickin in the United Kingdom, when it began being served at San Francisco&#x27;s Legendary Butter Bar.

The ratio of Red Bull to vodka varies but is usually ¾ of Red Bull and ¼ of vodka. In some places, it is customary to serve an entire can with a single shot of vodka; in others, a can may be split between several glasses, each containing several shots of vodka. The Red Bull dominates so that the flavour of the alcohol is not too strong.

==Health risks==
Caffeinated alcoholic drinks can be hazardous as caffeine can mask the influence of alcohol and may lead a person to misinterpret their actual level of intoxication. However, in 2012 the scientific review paper &quot;Energy drinks mixed with alcohol: misconception, myths and facts&quot; was published, discussing the available scientific evidence on the effects of mixing energy drinks with alcohol. The authors note that excessive and irresponsible consumption of alcoholic drinks has adverse effects on human health and behaviour, but it should be clear that this is due to the alcohol, and not the mixer. They concluded that there is no consistent evidence that energy drinks alter the perceived level of intoxication of people who mix energy drinks with alcohol and found no evidence that co-consumption of energy drinks causes increased alcohol consumption. A 2016 study found that consuming alcohol with energy drinks lead to increased risk of injury compared to consuming alcohol alone.

In 2001 it was reported in Sweden that two people died after drinking Vodka Red Bull. The Swedish National Food Agency investigated, but continued to permit the sale of Red Bull.

==Invention==
Vodka Red Bull was invented by the notable futurologist Benjamin Reed in 1999. It is believed it was an accidental creation and the original recipe also contained lemonade. Lemonade was eventually dropped from the recipe, as Reed felt that for more solid branding and popularity, asking for a &#x27;Vodka Red Bull &amp; lemonade&#x27; was too long-winded.

<doc id="727443" wikidata="Q7011315" url="?curid=727443" title="New Roman Times">
<text>New Roman Times is an album by musical group Camper Van Beethoven, released October 12, 2004, on Pitch-A-Tent Records. It was the band&#x27;s first studio album of new material since they released &quot;Key Lime Pie&quot; in 1989 before dissolving in 1990.

==Background and recording==
The core lineup on the album consists of David Lowery, Jonathan Segel, Victor Krummenacher, Greg Lisher, Chris Pedersen and David Immerglück, all of whom played in earlier lineups of the band. With former Camper member Chris Molla participating on a few songs as well, the album features many contributions from those involved in the band&#x27;s late-1980s heyday. The album also features some songwriting and musical contributions by Johnny Hickman, the guitarist in Lowery&#x27;s band Cracker, who was also a member of the Estonian Gauchos, an early-1980s precursor to CVB that had also featured Lowery and Molla. Cracker drummer Frank Funaro and accordionist/keyboardist Kenny Margolis, both of whom were featured in Camper&#x27;s live shows prior to the album&#x27;s release, are listed in the credits as &quot;live band blood and guts.&quot;

The album is set in a surreal, alternative universe in which the United States is split up into separate, hostile countries. Texas is a right-wing, Christian country, while California is a left-wing utopian state, although in the story it is engulfed by civil war and occupied by right-wing security forces. This is a cryptic commentary on the red state/blue state political division that exists in the US.

The main character is a Texan around the age of 20 who enlists in the army after an event similar to 9/11 occurs. In the beginning of the story, he is very nationalistic and gung-ho about defending his country. He fights in the war and is wounded, losing a leg. He returns disabled and disillusioned with the fight. After an uprising in California, he joins the right-wing security force called &quot;The Texas Bureau&quot; that maintains peace there. After being disillusioned with that work as well, he joins the &quot;rebels,&quot; who are portrayed as kind of hippie/skater/surfer eco-warriors who are allied with Mexico and with space aliens. At the end of the album, he prepares to be a suicide bomber, presumably for his new cause, although the album&#x27;s deliberately obscure storytelling style makes the ending unclear. The album features other characters as well, including space aliens, right-wing militia members, a retired intelligence officer, and mentally disturbed homeless people.

The title, in addition to commenting on the theme of the album, is a play on the typeface Times New Roman. One of the songs, &quot;That Gum You Like Is Back In Style&quot; is derived from a line in David Lynch&#x27;s cult TV show &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. Another, &quot;Come Out&quot;, is a cover of a piece by minimalist composer Steve Reich.

==Novel==
In 2018 a novel based on the album was released, called &quot;New Roman Times&quot;, authored by Evan Brown. Lowery and Segel had the following to say about the story:&quot;How did it come to all this anyway? It’s been a very confusing time, hasn’t it? Well, here’s one of the many complicated stories that should bring some understanding of the real players involved, to bring you up to speed on the events of today. So much of it rides on the tales of these characters.”-Jonathan Segel&quot;New Roman Times was intended as a kind of commentary on the fakish red/blue narrative that emerged in the media in the lead up to the Iraq war. The crazy conspiratorial elements were thrown in because it’s a Camper Van Beethoven album. The fact our 2003 unreality better matches 2018’s reality should bother us all.&quot;- David Lowery

<text>|}



















The Lockinge Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged four years or older. It is run over a distance of 1 mile (1,609 metres) at Newbury in May.

==History==
The event is named after Lockinge, a civil parish located to the north of Newbury. It was established in 1958, and originally open to horses aged three or older. The first edition was won by that year&#x27;s 2000 Guineas Stakes winner Pall Mall. The horse repeated his success as a four-year-old in 1959.

The present race grading system was introduced in 1971, and the Lockinge Stakes was given Group 2 status. It was abandoned due to torrential rain in 1975.

The event was relegated to Group 3 level in 1983, and promoted back to Group 2 in 1985. It was raised to Group 1 and closed to three-year-olds in 1995.

The Lockinge Stakes became part of the British Champions Series in 2011. It is currently the second race in the mile division, which concludes with the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in October.

The leading horses from the Lockinge Stakes often go on to compete in the Queen Anne Stakes. The last to win both races in the same year was Frankel in 2012.

<text>Alexander Sergeyevich Yakovlev (; 22 August 1989) was a Soviet aeronautical engineer. He designed the Yakovlev military aircraft and founded the Yakovlev Design Bureau. Yakovlev joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1938.

==Biography==
Yakovlev was born in Moscow, where his father was an employee of the Nobel Brothers oil company. From 1919 to 1921, he worked as a part-time courier while still in school, and in 1922 he built his first model aeroplane as part of a school project. In 1924, he built a glider, the AVF-10, which made its first flight on 24 September 1924. The design won an award and secured him a position as a worker at the Zhukovsky Air Force Military Engineering Academy. However, his repeated attempts to gain admission to the Academy were denied due to his “lack of proletariat origins”. In 1927, Yakovlev designed the AIR-1 ultralight aircraft. This was the first of ten aircraft he designed between 1927 and 1933.

In 1927, Yakovlev finally gained admittance to the Academy and graduated in 1931. He was then assigned to the Moscow Aviation Plant No. 39, where his first design bureau of lightweight aviation was established in 1932. He became the main designer in 1935, then the chief designer (1956–1984) of aircraft for the Yakovlev Design Bureau.

The Yakovlev Design Bureau developed many fighter aircraft used by the Soviet Air Force during World War II. Particularly well known are the Yak-1, Yak-3, Yak-7 and Yak-9 as well as the Yak-6 transport. In 1945 Yakovlev designed one of the first Soviet aircraft with a jet engine, the Yak-15. He also designed the first Soviet all-weather interceptor, the Yak-25P, and the first Soviet supersonic bomber, the Yak-28. In the post-war period, Yakovlev was best known for the civilian airliner, the Yak-42, a three-engine medium-range aircraft, and numerous aerobatic models.

Yakovlev served under Joseph Stalin as a Vice-Minister of Aviation Industry between 1940 and 1946. Before the start of World War II, he made a number of trips abroad, including Italy, England and Germany, to study aircraft development in those countries. After the start of the war, he helped supervise the evacuation of aircraft factories to the east, and the production organisation, while continuing as head designer of his Bureau. He was also a correspondent member of the USSR Academy of Science in 1943. In 1946 he was awarded the title &quot;General-Colonel of Aviation&quot;.

In 1976 Yakovlev became academician of the USSR Academy of Science. He was a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR (1946–1989). Yakovlev retired 21 August 1984. He was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

<text>The Coronation Cup is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged four years or older. It is run at Epsom Downs over a distance of 1 mile, 4 furlongs and 6 yards (2,420 metres), or about 1½ miles, and it is scheduled to take place each year in late May or early June.

==History==
The event was established in 1902 to commemorate the coronation of a new British monarch, King Edward VII. Epsom had staged a similar race, the Epsom Gold Cup, which was open to horses aged three or older. The Coronation Cup was temporarily switched to alternative venues during wartime periods, with runnings at Newmarket (1915–16, 1943–45) and Newbury (1941).

The race is contested on the first day of Epsom&#x27;s two-day Derby Festival meeting, the same day as the Epsom Oaks. Its distance is the same as that of both the Oaks and the Epsom Derby, and it often features horses who competed in those events in the preceding seasons.

The race was run on the Thursday of the Derby meeting until 1994, it was run on a Saturday in 1975 (This was due to the European Community Membership referendum on the Thursday), 1995-97, 2012-16 and finally run on the Friday from 1998-2011 then from 2017-present

<doc id="727455" wikidata="Q1416553" url="?curid=727455" title="Chopper (motorcycle)">
<text>A chopper is a type of custom motorcycle which emerged in the US state of California in the late 1950s. A chopper employs modified steering angles and lengthened forks for a stretched-out appearance. They can be built from an original motorcycle which is modified (&quot;chopped&quot;) or built from scratch. Some of the characteristic features of choppers are long front ends with extended forks often coupled with an increased rake angle, hardtail frames (frames without rear suspension), very tall &quot;ape hanger&quot; or very short &quot;drag&quot; handlebars, lengthened or stretched frames, and larger than stock front wheel. To be considered a chopper a motorcycle frame must be cut and welded at some point. I.e. the name chopper. The &quot;sissy bar&quot;, a set of tubes that connect the rear fender with the frame, and which are often extended several feet high, is a signature feature on many choppers.

Two famous examples of the chopper are customised Harley-Davidsons, the &quot;Captain America&quot; and &quot;Billy Bike&quot;, seen in the 1969 film &quot;Easy Rider&quot;.

==History==

===The Bob-Job Era, 1946–1959===
Before there were choppers, there was the bobber, a motorcycle that had been &quot;bobbed&quot;, or relieved of excess weight by removing parts. With the intent of making the bike lighter and faster, the fenders would often be removed, or at least to make it look better in the eyes of a rider seeking a more minimalist ride.

An early example of a bobber is the 1940 Indian Sport Scout &quot;Bob-Job&quot; which toured in the 1998 &quot;The Art of the Motorcycle&quot; exhibition. Indian Scouts and Chiefs of the time came with large, heavily valanced fenders, nearly reaching the center of the wheel on the 1941 Indian Series 441, while racing bikes had tiny fenders or none at all. The large bikes exemplified the &quot;dresser&quot; motorcycle aesthetic and provided a counterpoint to the minimalist bobber, and café racers.

In the post–World War II United States, servicemen returning home from the war started removing all parts deemed too big, heavy, ugly, or not essential to the basic function of the motorcycle, such as fenders, turn indicators, and even front brakes. The large, spring-suspended saddles were also removed in order to sit as low as possible on the motorcycle&#x27;s frame. These machines were lightened to improve performance for dirt-track racing and mud racing. In California, dry lake beds were used for long top speed runs. Motorcycles and automobiles ran at the same meets, and bobbers were an important part of the hotrod culture that developed in this era.

The first choppers were built in America and were an outgrowth of the milder customization trend that had originated after WW2 when returning soldiers and others began modifying cars and motorcycles, frequently to improve performance in top-speed races on dry lake beds in Southern California and similar desolate spaces such as unused airstrips in other parts of the country, or on the street for street racing. These early modified motorcycles were known as &quot;bobbers&quot;, and there are many common features between bobbers and choppers, with choppers differentiated by more radical modifications, especially frame tube and geometry modifications (&quot;chopped&quot; by welding) intended to make the bike longer.

The earliest choppers tended to be based on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, at first making use of the Flathead, Knucklehead and Panhead engines—many of which could be found in surplus military and police motorcycles bought cheaply at auction. As new engines became available, they were soon utilized in choppers. British bikes, particularly Triumphs, were also a popular motor for choppers early on. As the Japanese manufacturers began offering larger engines in the late 1960s these motors were also quickly put to use by chopper builders. The Honda 750-4 was the most widely used Japanese motor for early chopper builders. Choppers have been created using almost every available engine, but builders have always shown a preference for older air-cooled designs. It is rare to see a chopper with a radiator.

Over time the choppers became more and more about achieving a certain look, rather than being primarily performance-oriented modifications. The modifications that had had their origin in hot-rodding evolved into an artistic and aesthetic direction. By the mid-1970s stock Japanese and European performance motorcycles would outperform most bobbers and choppers. The one exception to this was the drag racing arena, which placed a premium on pure engine power, rather than handling over curvy courses. Chopper styling continued to be influenced by drag-bike modifications throughout the 1960s and 1970s.

While all choppers are highly customized bikes, sometimes even being built from scratch using all custom parts, not all customized bikes are choppers. In Europe at roughly the same era that choppers were invented and popularized in the US, bikers modified their bikes (primarily English brands like Triumph, BSA, Norton, and Matchless) in a different way, to achieve different looks, performance goals and riding position. The resulting bikes are known as café racers and look very different from a chopper.

As the popularity of choppers grew, in part through exposure in movies such as the 1969 classic &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, several motorcycle brands took note and began to include chopper influenced styling in their factory offerings. None of the factories were willing to go all out and do things like abandon rear-suspension to achieve the classic chopper look, however. As a result, these bikes were given the name &quot;factory customs&quot; and are not considered choppers.

Over the decades since the first choppers were created many different trends and fads have taken hold and held sway, so that it is often possible for someone to look at a chopper and say that it is a &quot;1970s&quot; style or fits into a specific era or sub-type. Some contemporary builders specialize in building choppers that very exactly fit into these styles, which are frequently referred to as &quot;old school&quot; style choppers.

=== Late 1950s to 1960s - early choppers ===
By the early 1960s there was a big enough contingent of people modifying motorcycles, still mostly big Harley-Davidsons, that a certain style had begun to take hold. A set of modifications became common: the fat tires and 16&quot; wheels of the stock motorcycles were replaced with narrower tires often on a larger 19&quot; or 21&quot; wheel. Forward-mounted foot pegs replaced the standard large &#x27;floorboard&#x27; footrests. Frequently the standard headlight and fuel tank were replaced with much smaller ones. Often upgraded chromed parts (either one-off fabricated replacements or manually chromed stock parts) were added. It is in this era that what we would today consider a chopper came into existence and began to be called the chopper.

During the 1960s, candy-colored paint, often multicolored and metal-flaked with different patterns, became a trend that allowed builders to further express their individuality and artistry. Soon many parts were being offered by small companies expressly for use in building choppers, not necessarily as performance parts as was common in the Bobber Era.

The first famous chopper builders came to prominence in this era, including Arlen Ness who was a leader in the &quot;Frisco&quot; or &quot;Bay Area Chopper&quot; style. Ness&#x27;s bikes were characterized by having long low frames and highly raked front ends, typically 45 degrees or more, and frequently made use of springer front ends. Many made use of the newer Harley-Davidson Sportster motor, a simpler and more compact &quot;unit motor&quot; that included the transmission in the same housing as the motor itself, which lent itself nicely to Ness&#x27;s stripped-down style. Many of Ness&#x27;s bikes in this era retained the rear shocks of the donor Sportster to provide a more forgiving ride than the typical hardtail chopper.

In 1967 Denver Mullins (1944–1992) and Armando ″Mondo″ Porras opened &quot;Denver&#x27;s Choppers&quot; in San Bernardino, California, and soon became famous for building &quot;long bikes&quot;, often referred to as &quot;Denver choppers&quot;. These featured even longer front ends than the Bay Area style and had a much higher frame (stretched &quot;up and out&quot;). Denver&#x27;s was particularly well known for the springer forks that they fabricated, as well as the overall style of their bikes.

With choppers still not yet a mass market concept regional variations and formulations flourished in this period. Many innovations were tried in this period, found not to work that well, and then abandoned. A great deal of knowledge about how to build long bikes that handled well adjusting rake and trail was developed, yet less sophisticated builders also created a lot of bikes that had handling issues in this period as expertise was still scarce and closely held.

===The 1970s: iconic choppers, diggers and Japanese motors===

The huge success of the 1969 film &quot;Easy Rider&quot; instantly popularized the chopper around the world, and drastically increased the demand for them. What had been a subculture known to a relatively small group of enthusiasts in a few regions of the US became a global phenomenon. During the late 1960s, the first wave of European chopper builders emerged, such as the &quot;Swedish Chopper&quot; style, but Easy Rider brought attention everywhere to choppers.

The number of chopper-building custom shops multiplied, as did the number of suppliers of ready-made chopper parts. According to the taste and purse of the owner, chop shops would build high handlebars, or later Ed Roth&#x27;s Wild Child designed stretched, narrowed, and raked front forks. Shops also custom-built exhaust pipes and many of the aftermarket kits followed in the late 1960s into the 1970s. Laws required (and in many locales still do) a retention fixture for the passenger, so vertical backrests called sissy bars became a popular installation, often sticking up higher than the rider&#x27;s head.

While the decreased weight and lower seat position improved handling and performance, the main reason to build a chopper was to show off and provoke others by riding a machine that was stripped and almost nude compared to the stock Harley-Davidsons and automobiles of the period. Style trumped practicality, particularly as forks became longer and longer handling suffered. As one biker said, &quot;You couldn&#x27;t turn very good, but you sure looked good doing it.&quot;

The Digger became another popular style. Similar to the Frisco choppers Diggers were frequently even longer than earlier bikes, but still low. The coffin and prism shaped tanks on these bikes were frequently mated with very long front ends (12&quot; over stock and more), with the archaic girder fork often being used to accomplish this instead of the more common springer or telescopic types. Body work was also moulded to flow seamlessly, using copious amounts of bondo. New paint colors and patterns included paisleys, day-glo and fluorescent, along with continuing use of metal-flakes and pearls.

Honda&#x27;s groundbreaking 750 cc four-cylinder engine, first introduced to America in the 1969 CB-750, became widely available from salvage and wrecking operations and became a popular alternative to Harley-Davidson&#x27;s motors. Harley&#x27;s then-current big-twin motor, the Shovelhead, was extremely popular with chopper builders in this era, and use of the older motors, particularly the Knucklehead and Flathead declined as parts became harder to get and the performance of the new motors proved superior.

=== The 1980s and 1990s: improved engineering and aftermarket suppliers ===

In 1984 Harley-Davidson, who had been using chopper inspired styling for a number of years, released the &#x27;Softail&#x27;, a design that hid the rear shocks under the engine creating a profile that looked a lot like a hard tail. This frame was initially offered in the Softail Custom, a bike that took many styling cues from choppers, including the narrow 21&quot; front wheel. Buyers looking for the chopper look had a plausible factory alternative, and interest in choppers declined.

With some time out of the limelight chopper builders seemed to work on craft more than wild innovation in this period. While individual builders still built long bikes, the trend was towards more moderate geometries, and the basics of how to build a good handling chopper while still looking great became more common knowledge. In this period, it became possible to assemble a complete chopper using all aftermarket parts, companies like S&amp;S Cycle built complete replacement engines based on Harley-Davidson engines, frame makers such as Paughco offered a variety of hardtail frames, and many bikes were built using these new repro parts. Super long girder and springer forked bikes were less popular in this era, while the use of telescopic forks grew, and builders upgraded to larger diameter tubes in both forks and frames to gain more rigidity.

Japanese bike builders offered a dizzying array of new bikes, including full-faired racing styled machines as well as many &#x27;customs&#x27; that picked at chopper styling in a random way and rarely achieved the powerful integrated style that more and more custom chopper builders in this era seemed able to consistently achieve. As materials, fabrication and knowledge improved the performance of the better choppers improved. More powerful engines drove the need for stronger frames, brakes and bigger tires with more grip. These trends worked together so that as the 1990s closed the modern chopper was a larger looking, more powerful machine. The widespread use of CNC made it possible for even small shops to fabricate out of block aluminum, and billet components became a signature item often replacing stamped and chromed steel components of the earlier eras.

=== The 21st Century: Reality television ===
The millennium began with the cable TV network The Discovery Channel creating a number of television shows around several custom bike builders who built choppers. The first, the 2000 special &quot;Motorcycle Mania&quot;, followed builder Jesse James of Long Beach, California, and is credited with creating &quot;a new genre of reality TV&quot; around choppers.
The celebrity builders featured on the cable shows enjoyed a large following. Companies like Jesse James&#x27; West Coast Choppers have been successful in producing expensive choppers, and a wide range of chopper-themed brands of merchandise such as clothing, automobile accessories and stickers.

The &quot;American Chopper&quot; reality television series featuring Paul Teutul Sr, and his sons Paul Jr. and Mike, ran six years starting in 2003, and featured bike building at Orange County Choppers (OCC).

=== 2010: Backlash, Bobbers and the Old School Revival ===

This led to a backlash, and a renewed interest in home garage fabricated bikes built on a budget with available materials. Many builders eschewed Harley &quot;pattern&quot; motors and frames and started building choppers out of neglected bikes like Yamaha XS-650 twins, old Harley Sportsters, and various 1980&#x27;s so called UJM bikes (four cylinder air-cooled Japanese bikes - Universal Japanese Motorcycle).

Another aspect of the backlash was a return to more traditional styling. Bobbers were again in style: stock rake machines with a stripped-down look, often with flat or primer paints in charcoal grey, flat black, olive drab or brown.

Indian Larry and Paul Cox along with other New York City builders from Psycho Cycles are often credited with leading the movement back towards old school choppers in this period. Indian Larry was a featured builder early on the series &quot;Biker Build-Off&quot; on Discovery network, and won all three build off competitions, highlighting the popularity of his old-school style.
Three-inch-wide belt drives and motors were still appreciated by many, but an increasing countermovement of people building bikes with Shovelhead motors and chain drive primaries has occurred. Springers and even girder forks have made yet another come back. Magazines such as &quot;Iron Horse&quot;, &quot;Street Chopper&quot; and &quot;Show Class&quot; cater to the retro, old-school and backyard builders, and feature more DIY technology than the TV builders with their million-dollar garages of the previous decade.

=== 2020: Narrow Muscle Choppers ===

Later-generation builders take the chopper concept but keep the bike small, nimble and performance-inspired while nodding the styling of yesteryear. Some common characteristics of these custom bikes may include tall front end, narrow tires, high-output motor, cradle seat slammed onto the frame, t-bars, mid controls for example.

== Choppers in the UK ==

In the UK, due to the cost and lack of availability of the v-twin engine, many chose to use British engines from bikes such as Triumph or BSA; following an increase in imports, Japanese engines have seen more use.

<text>Johann Anton Güldenstädt (26 April 1745 in Riga, Latvia – 23 March 1781 in St. Petersburg, Russia) was a Baltic German naturalist and explorer in Russian service.

Güldenstädt lost both his parents early, and from 1763 onwards studied pharmacy, botany and natural history in Berlin. At the age of 22, he obtained his doctorate in medicine at the University of Frankfurt in 1767. In the following year, he joined the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences&#x27; expedition sent by Catherine II of Russia to explore the Russian empire&#x27;s southern frontier. Güldenstädt travelled through Ukraine and the Astrakhan region, as well as the northern Caucasus and Georgia, both of which were almost entirely beyond the borders of the Russian empire. In March 1775 he returned to St Petersburg. The results of the expedition and Güldenstädt&#x27;s edited expedition journal were published after his death by Peter Simon Pallas in &quot;Reisen durch Russland und im Caucasischen Gebürge&quot; (Travels in Russia and the Mountains of the Caucasus) (1787–1791).

The expedition contributed greatly to the fields of biology, geology, geography, and particularly linguistics. Güldenstädt took detailed notes on the languages of the region. After the expedition, which definitively established Güldenstädt&#x27;s reputation at the Academy, he continued to work as a naturalist.

Güldenstädt&#x27;s expedition was the first systematic study of the Caucasus. As was typical of contemporary expeditions organized in the spirit of the Enlightenment (including the later American Lewis and Clark Expedition), it was tasked with the observation and description of virtually every aspect of the region under study. This included both its &quot;natural&quot; attributes — flora, fauna, geography, and geology — and its peoples, economy, and government. In this sense it was both a scientific expedition and a mission of reconnaissance to learn more about a region that was important in the simultaneous Russian war with the Ottomans, of which the Caucasus was a theater, with the Georgians acting as Russian allies. Immediately following the expedition, Russian interest in the region, particularly Georgia, grew markedly, culminating in the Treaty of Georgievsk, which made East Georgia a Russian protectorate.

In 1781, he died from an outbreak of fever in St. Petersburg.

<text>|}






















The 1000 Guineas Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to three-year-old fillies. It is run on the Rowley Mile at Newmarket over a distance of 1 mile (1,609 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late April or early May on the Sunday following the 2000 Guineas Stakes.

It is the second of Britain&#x27;s five Classic races, and the first of two restricted to fillies. It can also serve as the opening leg of the Fillies&#x27; Triple Crown, followed by the Oaks and the St Leger, but the feat of winning all three is rarely attempted.

==History==
The 1000 Guineas was first run on 28 April 1814, five years after the inaugural running of the equivalent race for both colts and fillies, the 2000 Guineas. The two races were established by the Jockey Club under the direction of Sir Charles Bunbury, who had earlier co-founded the Derby. They were named according to their original prize funds (a guinea amounted to 21 shillings, or £1.05).

By the mid-1860s, the 1000 Guineas had become one of Britain&#x27;s most prestigious races for three-year-olds. The five leading events for this age group, characterised by increasing distances as the season progressed, were now referred to as &quot;Classics&quot;. The concept was later adopted in many other countries.

European variations of the 1000 Guineas include the German 1,000 Guineas, the Irish 1,000 Guineas, the Poule d&#x27;Essai des Pouliches and the Premio Regina Elena. Other countries to have adopted the format include Australia, Japan and New Zealand.

The 1000 Guineas is served by trial races such as the Nell Gwyn Stakes and the Fred Darling Stakes, but for some horses it is the first race of the season. The 1000 Guineas itself can act as a trial for the Oaks, and the last horse to win both was Love in 2020.

<text>Ivan Ignatyevich Yakubovsky (, ; 7 January 1912 – 30 November 1976) was a Marshal of the Soviet Union, twice made a Hero of the Soviet Union and serving as commander-in-chief of the Warsaw Pact from 1967 to 1976.

==Life==
===Early life===
Born as the sixth child of a peasant family of Belarusian ethnicity in the Mogilev Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Belarus), he was employed in their village and graduated from a rural school. From 1930 he worked as section-secretary on the Makaryevsky village council, then at a plant. He graduated from two courses at the Orsha School in 1932.

===Military service===
====Pre-war====
Enlisting in the Red Army in 1932, he graduated from the Mikhail Kalinin Belarusian Association Military School in Minsk in 1934, aiming to serve as a training platoon commander in the 27th Omsk Red Banner Rifle Division (Vitebsk).

In 1935 he graduated from training courses in Leningrad, before serving in the Belorussian Military District as a platoon commander, company commander, battalion chief of staff and training battalion commander of various armoured units. Commanding a tank company in the Red Army&#x27;s September 1939 Polish campaign as part of the troops on the Belorussian front, he also served in the 1939–40 Winter War.

====World War II====
Yakubovsky entered the war in its early days on the western border as commander of a tank battalion, fighting heroically in the most difficult defensive battles in Belarus. His unit was one of the last defenders of a doomed Minsk, crushing an advanced enemy motorcycle convoy with their tanks in the city streets. From January 1942 he commanded a tank regiment of the 121st Tank Brigade on the USSR&#x27;s western front, becoming Deputy Commander of the 121st Tank Brigade (January 1942) then Commander (March 1942) of the 91st Tank Brigade and participating in the Barvinkivske-Lozova offensive. He distinguished himself in the defensive battles in the Donets Basin in the summer of 1942 and in the defensive and offensive phases of the Battle of Stalingrad, fighting on the Southern, Southwestern, Stalingrad and Don fronts and rising to colonel on 30 November 1942.

In spring 1943 the brigade was transferred to the Central Front, joining the 3rd Guards Tank Army, in which he fought right up until VE Day. Commanding the brigade, he fought heroically on the Voronezh, Bryansk, Central, 1st Ukrainian fronts, in the battle of Kursk in the Orel region, in the Battle of the Dnieper and in the liberation of Kiev and Fastiv. For his heroism at Fastiv, where his unit destroyed 30 enemy tanks in a single day, Yakubovsky was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. In spring 1944, at the head of his tank brigade, Col Yakubovsky successfully operated in Proskurovo-Chernivtsi offensive.

In June 1944 he became deputy commander of 6th Guards Tank Corps within 3rd Guards Tank Army. He participated in the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive, in the battles defending and expanding the Sandomierz bridgehead, in the Vistula–Oder Offensive in January 1945. In these operations, he commanded the advanced corps troops, at their point of impact with the German tank units. For heroic actions in the Lvov-Sandomierz operation Colonel Yakubovsky was again ranked as a Hero of the Soviet Union, by decree of 23 September 1944. From April 1945 he was deputy commander of the 7th Guards Tank Corps within 3rd Guards Tank Army, participating in the Berlin and Prague operations and rising to Major-General of Tank Troops (20 April 1945).

====Cold War====

After the war, he continued to serve as deputy commander of the tank corps in the Leningrad Military District. In 1948 he graduated from the General Staff Academy. In March 1948 he became Commander of the Armored Division in the Belorussian Military District then in April 1952 became commander of armoured and mechanized forces in the Carpathian Military District. Rising to Lieutenant-General of Tank Forces (3.05.1953), he commanded a Tank Army (December 1953 to April 1957) then a mechanized army (from April 1957).

In July 1957 he became First Deputy Commander of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, later being promoted to Colonel-General (18.08.1958). In April 1960 he was appointed Commander of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, being in post in the midst of the Berlin Crisis of 1961, when the threat of armed conflict in Europe dramatically escalated. During the crisis, in August 1961, Ivan Konev, Commander in Chief of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, was appointed Marshal of the Soviet Union and Yakubovsky was transferred to the post of his first deputy, while continuing to manage the daily operations of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. After stabilizing the situation in April 1962, Army General Yakubovsky again returned to the post of Commander of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. In January 1965 he was made Commander of the Kiev Military District.

On 12 April 1967 he was made First Deputy Minister of Defense of the USSR (simultaneously with the appointment of Andrei Grechko as Minister of Defense) and Marshal of the Soviet Union, whilst from July that year he contiguously held the post of supreme commander of the forces of the Warsaw Pact. In this capacity, he directed military preparations for the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968.

<text>Rosalyn Sussman Yalow (July 19, 1921 – May 30, 2011) was an American medical physicist, and a co-winner of the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (together with Roger Guillemin and Andrew Schally) for development of the radioimmunoassay technique. She was the second woman (after Gerty Cori), and the first American-born woman, to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

==Biography==
===Childhood===
Rosalyn Sussman Yalow was born in the Bronx, New York, the daughter of Clara (née Zipper) and Simon Sussman, and was raised in a Jewish household. She went to Walton High School (Bronx), New York City. After high school, she attended the all-female, tuition-free Hunter College, where her mother hoped she would learn to become a teacher. Instead, Yalow decided to study physics.

===College===
Yalow knew how to type, and was able to get a part-time position as a secretary to Dr. Rudolf Schoenheimer, a leading biochemist at Columbia University&#x27;s College of Physicians and Surgeons. She did not believe that any respectable graduate school would admit and financially support a woman, so she took another job as a secretary to Dr. Michael Heidelberger, another biochemist at Columbia, who hired her on the condition that she studied stenography. She graduated from Hunter College in January 1941.

A few years later, she received an offer to be a teaching assistant in physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She received this offer partially because World War II had just begun and many men went off to fight, and the University opted to offer women education and jobs to avoid being shut down. At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, she was the only woman among the department&#x27;s 400 members, and the first since 1917. Yalow earned her PhD in 1945. The next summer, she took two tuition-free physics courses under government auspices at New York University.

===Marriage and children===
She married fellow student Aaron Yalow, the son of a rabbi, in June 1943. They had two children, Benjamin and Elanna Yalow, and kept a kosher home. Yalow did not believe in &quot;balancing her career with her home life&quot; and instead incorporated her home life wherever she could in her work life. However, she viewed the traditional roles of a homemaker as a priority, and devoted herself to traditional duties associated with motherhood and being a wife.
Throughout her career, she tended to shun feminist organizations, but still advocated for including more women in science. While she believed the reason she had certain opportunities in physics was because of the war, she thought that the reason that the number of women in this field decreased after the war was due to a lack of interest. Yalow saw the feminist movement as a challenge to her traditional beliefs and thought that it encouraged women not to fulfill their duties to become mothers and wives.

==Scientific career==
The month after graduating from Hunter College in January 1941, Rosalyn Sussman Yalow was offered a position as a teaching assistant in the physics department of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Gaining acceptance to the physics graduate program in the college of engineering at the University of Illinois was one of the many hurdles she had to overcome as a woman in her field. Powerful male figures controlled opportunities for training, recognition, promotion, and many aspects of development in the field of science, and especially physics.

When Yalow entered the university in September 1941, she was the only woman in the faculty, which comprised 400 professors and teaching assistants. She was the first woman since 1917 to attend or teach at this engineering college. Yalow credited her position at the prestigious graduate school to the shortage of male candidates during World War II. Being surrounded by gifted men made her aware of a wider world in science. They recognized her talent, they encouraged her, and they supported her. They were in a position to help her succeed.

Yalow felt that other women in her field did not like her because of her ambition. Other women saw her curiosity as abandoning the only acceptable path for a woman in science at the time, becoming a high school science teacher, but Yalow wanted to be a physicist. During her time at the University of Illinois, she took extra undergraduate courses to increase her knowledge because she wanted to do original experimental research in addition to her regular teaching duties.

For years Yalow faced criticism from women at work but she never quit nor turned her back on other young women, if she believed they had the potential to become real scientists. She never became an advocate for women&#x27;s organizations in the field of science. She was even quoted as saying, &quot;It bothers me that there are now organizations for women in science, which means they think they have to be treated differently from the men. I don&#x27;t approve.&quot; Although girls and young women found a role model in her after she won her Nobel, Yalow was not a champion for improving women&#x27;s treatment or representation in science.

Yalow&#x27;s first job after teaching and taking classes at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana graduate school was as an assistant electrical engineer at Federal Telecommunications Laboratory. She again found herself to be the only woman employee. In 1946, she returned to Hunter College to teach physics and consequently influenced many women, most notably a young Mildred Dresselhaus: Yalow was responsible for steering the future &quot;Queen of Carbon Science&quot; away from primary school teaching and into a research career. She remained a physics lecturer from 1946 to 1950, although by 1947, she began her long association with the Veterans Administration by becoming a consultant to the Bronx Veteran&#x27;s Administration Hospital.

The Veteran&#x27;s Administration wanted to establish research programs to explore medical uses of radioactive substances. By 1950, Yalow had equipped a radioisotope laboratory at the Bronx VA Hospital and decided to leave teaching to finally devote her attention to full-time research. There she collaborated with Solomon Berson to develop radioimmunoassay, a radioisotope tracing technique that allows the measurement of tiny quantities of various biological substances in human blood as well as a multitude of other aqueous fluids. Originally used to study insulin levels in diabetes mellitus, the technique has since been applied to hundreds of other substances – including hormones, vitamins and enzymes – all which had been present in quantities or concentrations that were previously too small to detect. Without the contributions of Yalow to the work of accurate hormone measurement, it was impossible to diagnose various hormone-related conditions and endocrine diseases like type 1 diabetes.

Despite its huge commercial potential, Yalow and Berson refused to patent the method. In 1968, Yalow was appointed as a research professor in the department of medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital, where she later became the Solomon Berson Distinguished Professor at Large. Yalow also had a passion for the next generation of researchers. She acted as a mentor figure to scientists from around the world, many of whom came to share her passion for investigative endocrinology research. One of her students, John Eng, later used her radioimmunoassay technique in 1992 to discover a novel substance in Gila monster venom which he called exendin-4. Exenatide, a drug based on a synthetic version of exendin-4, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2005. It was the first of the GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs which became enormously popular in the 2020s for diabetes management and weight loss. Another mentee, Dr. Narayana Panicker Kochupillai, went on to become a leading endocrinology researcher in India, studying thyroid hormones and iodine deficiency. In these ways, Yalow&#x27;s legacy in endocrinology was carried on. A fitting title for Rosalyn Yalow may well be &quot;the Mother of Endocrinology.&quot;

==Awards==

Yalow was awarded a Fulbright fellowship to Portugal, which is an American scholarship program of competitive, merit-based grants that sponsor participants for exchanges in all areas of endeavor, including the sciences, business, academe, public service, government, and the arts.

In 1961, Yalow won the Eli Lilly Award of the American Diabetes Association, which provides scholarships for up to 100 scholars to attend Scientific Sessions, the world&#x27;s largest scientific and medical conference focused on diabetes and its complications. Additionally, it provides the education and training for these scholars to serve as faculty for professional education programs and to clinically manage the disease.

A year later, she was awarded the Gairdner Foundation International Award, which recognizes the world&#x27;s most creative and accomplished biomedical scientists who are advancing humanity.

The same year, Yalow was awarded the American College of Physicians Award, which recognizes excellence and distinguished contributions by individuals to internal medicine.

In 1972, Yalow was awarded the William S. Middleton Award for Excellence in Research, which is the highest honor awarded annually by the Biomedical Laboratory Research and Development Service to senior biomedical research scientists in recognition of their outstanding scientific contributions and achievements, pertaining to the healthcare of veterans.

Also in 1972, she was given the Koch Award of the Endocrine Society, which awards individuals for their dedication to excellence in research, education and clinical practice in the field of endocrinology.

In 1975, Yalow and Berson (who had died in 1972) were awarded the American Medical Association Scientific Achievement Award, which is a gold medallion award presented to individuals on special occasions in recognition of their outstanding work in scientific achievement.

The following year she became the first female recipient and first nuclear physicist of the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research. Established by Albert and Mary Lasker in 1945, the award is intended to celebrate scientists who have made fundamental biological discoveries and clinical advances that improve human health.

In 1977, Yalow was the sixth individual woman (seventh overall, considering Marie Curie&#x27;s two wins), and first American-born woman, to win the Nobel Prize in a scientific field. She was also the second woman in the world to win in the physiology or medicine category (the first was Gerty Cori). Yalow was honored for her role in devising the radioimmunoassay technique, along with Roger Guillemin and Andrew V. Schally for their research in another field. By measuring substances in the human body, the screening of the blood of donors for such diseases as hepatitis was made possible. Radioimmunoassay can be used to measure a multitude of substances found in tiny quantities in fluids within and outside of organisms (such as viruses, drugs and hormones). The list of substances is endless, but specifically, it allowed blood donations to be screened for various types of hepatitis. The technique can also be used to identify hormone-related health problems. Further, it can be used to detect in the blood many foreign substances including some cancers. Finally, the technique can be used to measure the effectiveness of dose levels of antibiotics and drugs.

In 1977, Yalow received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 1978, Yalow was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which provides an opportunity for an early-career professional with training in science or engineering to learn about a career in public policy and administration.

In 1986, Yalow was awarded the A. Cressy Morrison Award in Natural Sciences of the New York Academy of Sciences, which is offered by Mr. Abraham Cressy Morrison to individuals with superlative papers on a scientific subject within the field of The New York Academy of Sciences and its Affiliated Societies.

In 1988, Yalow received the National Medal of Science, which is given to American individuals who deserve the highest honor in science and technology.

In 1993, Yalow was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

==Death==
Yalow died May 30, 2011, in the Bronx, New York. She was predeceased by her husband, and survived by two children, Benjamin and Elanna, and two grandchildren.

<text>|}
























The Oaks Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to three-year-old fillies. It is run at Epsom Downs over a distance of 1 mile, 4 furlongs and 6 yards (2,420 metres), about 1½ miles, and it is scheduled to take place each year in late May or early June. It is the second-oldest of the five Classic races, after the St Leger. Officially the Betfred Oaks, it is also popularly known as simply The Oaks. It has increasingly come to be referred to as the Epsom Oaks in both the UK and overseas countries, although &#x27;Epsom&#x27; is not part of the official title of the race.)

It is the third of Britain&#x27;s five Classic races to be held during the season, and the second of two restricted to fillies. It can also serve as the middle leg of the Fillies&#x27; Triple Crown, preceded by the 1000 Guineas and followed by the St Leger, although the feat of winning all three is rarely attempted.

==History==
The event is named after The Oaks, an estate located to the east of Epsom which was leased to the 12th Earl of Derby in the 18th century. He and his guests devised the race during a party at the estate in 1778. It was first run (as the Oakes Stakes) in 1779, one year before the introduction of the Derby Stakes. The inaugural winner, Bridget, was owned by Lord Derby himself.

The Oaks subsequently became one of Britain&#x27;s leading events for three-year-olds. By the mid-1860s, the five leading events for this age group were referred to as &quot;Classics&quot;. The concept was later adopted in many other countries.

European variations of the Oaks include the Irish Oaks, the Preis der Diana, the Prix de Diane and the Oaks d&#x27;Italia. Other national equivalents include the AJC Oaks, the New Zealand Oaks and the Yushun Himba.

Since 1892, horses have each carried 9 stone in the race. Prior to this, there were several fluctuations, from an original 8 stone 4 pounds, down to 8 stone, then progressively upwards.

During both World Wars the race was run at Newmarket under the title the New Oaks Stakes. The 2014 running incorporated the name of Sir Henry Cecil in its title. Cecil, who died in June 2013, trained eight Oaks winners between 1985 and 2007.

<text>was a career officer, convicted war criminal and general in the Imperial Japanese Army, serving from the Russo-Japanese War to the end of World War II.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Yamada was born in Nagano Prefecture as the third son of Ichikawa Katashi, an accountant in the Imperial Japanese Army, and was adopted by the Yamada family as a child. He graduated from the 14th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1903, and his classmates included future generals Motoo Furushō and Toshizō Nishio. He was promoted to lieutenant in February 1905 and taught as an instructor at the Army Academy, and was promoted to captain in September 1912. He graduated from the 24th class of the Army Staff College in November, where his classmates included Kenji Doihara, Kiyoshi Katsuki, Hisao Tani, and Yanagawa Heisuke.

As a cavalry officer, his rise through the ranks was steady. He was promoted to major in June 1918 and appointed an instructor at the Army Cavalry School, receiving a promotion to lieutenant-colonel in August 1922. In August 1925, he was promoted to colonel and appointed commander of the IJA 26th Cavalry Regiment. In 1926, he was Chief of Staff of the Chosen Army. He served in the communications section of the 3rd Bureau of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff from 1927 to 1930. 

Yamada was promoted to major general in August 1930 and appointed commandant of the Army Cavalry School. From 1931–1932, he returned to the field as commander of the IJA 4th Cavalry Brigade, before resuming a number of administrative positions (including that of commandant of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy) to 1937. He was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure, 2nd class in February 1934 and promoted to lieutenant general in August 1934.

===World War II===
With the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Yamada was named commander of the IJA 12th Division, based in Manchukuo. During that period, the 12th Division was an elite unit, with a disproportionately large amount of firepower and heavy equipment. He became commander of the IJA 3rd Army in 1938, and that of the Central China Expeditionary Army from 1938 to 1939.

Yamada was promoted to full general in August 1940, and was recalled to Japan to assume the post of Inspector-General of Military Training from 1940 to 1944. He also served as a member of the Supreme War Council during this period. In May 1943 he was promoted to the honorific title of Third Court Rank.

In 1944, with the resignation of Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, Yamada fell from political favor, and was reassigned in July back to Manchukuo as the final commander of the Kwantung Army, and he concurrently held the positions of Japanese ambassador to Manchukuo and Governor-General of the Kwantung Leased Territory. He quickly advised Imperial General Headquarters that it would be impossible to hold the border with the Soviet Union with the forces allocated, as the Kwantung Army had largely been hollowed out with redeployment of experienced troops (with most of their equipment) to the Pacific theater of the war. With no aid forthcoming from Japan, Yamada attempted to organize large numbers of poorly-trained conscripts and volunteers into eight new infantry divisions and seven new infantry brigades, and to withdraw from border areas to protect the strategic core of the nation. However, when the Soviet Army invaded Manchuria on 9 August 1945, many of Yamada&#x27;s makeshift forces were no more than 15% combat ready and were quickly overrun.

At the surrender of Japan, Yamada was taken as a prisoner of war to Khabarovsk in the Soviet Union. He was a defendant in the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials and was sentenced to 25 years in a Gulag labor camp for war crimes. During his trial, he admitted to authorizing the use of &quot;Ishii bombs&quot;, fragile porcelain grenades containing typhus and bubonic plague bacteria, which had been developed by Unit 731 for use in bacteriological warfare. Yamada was also found to have presided over and encouraged biochemical weapon experimentation on involuntary human subjects, resulting in the torture and murder of thousands of people. In 1950 he was transferred to NKVD special camp No. 48 where a secret Soviet biological weapons facility was established. 

In December 1956, Yamada was released with the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956 renormalizing diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, and was repatriated to Japan, where he died in 1965.

<text>In mathematics, a rose or rhodonea curve is a sinusoid specified by either the cosine or sine functions with no phase angle that is plotted in polar coordinates. Rose curves or &quot;rhodonea&quot; were named by the Italian mathematician who studied them, Guido Grandi, between the years 1723 and 1728.

== General overview ==
=== Specification ===
A rose is the set of points in polar coordinates specified by the polar equation
:formula_1
or in Cartesian coordinates using the parametric equations
:formula_2

Roses can also be specified using the sine function. Since
:formula_3. 
Thus, the rose specified by is identical to that specified by rotated counter-clockwise by radians, which is one-quarter the period of either sinusoid.

Since they are specified using the cosine or sine function, roses are usually expressed as polar coordinate (rather than Cartesian coordinate) graphs of sinusoids that have angular frequency of and an amplitude of that determine the radial coordinate given the polar angle (though when is a rational number, a rose curve can be expressed in Cartesian coordinates since those can be specified as algebraic curves).

=== General properties ===

Roses are directly related to the properties of the sinusoids that specify them.

==== Petals ====
* Graphs of roses are composed of petals. A petal is the shape formed by the graph of a half-cycle of the sinusoid that specifies the rose. (A cycle is a portion of a sinusoid that is one period long and consists of a positive half-cycle, the continuous set of points where and is long, and a negative half-cycle is the other half where .)
** The shape of each petal is same because the graphs of half-cycles have the same shape. The shape is given by the positive half-cycle with crest at specified by (that is bounded by the angle interval ). The petal is symmetric about the polar axis. All other petals are rotations of this petal about the pole, including those for roses specified by the sine function with same values for and .
** Consistent with the rules for plotting points in polar coordinates, a point in a negative half-cycle cannot be plotted at its polar angle because its radial coordinate is negative. The point is plotted by adding radians to the polar angle with a radial coordinate . Thus, positive and negative half-cycles can be coincident in the graph of a rose. In addition, roses are inscribed in the circle .
** When the period of the sinusoid is less than or equal to , the petal&#x27;s shape is a single closed loop. A single loop is formed because the angle interval for a polar plot is and the angular width of the half-cycle is less than or equal to . When (or ) the plot of a half-cycle can be seen as spiraling out from the pole in more than one circuit around the pole until plotting reaches the inscribed circle where it spirals back to the pole, intersecting itself and forming one or more loops along the way. Consequently, each petal forms two loops when (or ), three loops when (or ), etc. Roses with only one petal with multiple loops are observed for , etc. (See the figure in the introduction section.)
** A rose&#x27;s petals will not intersect each other when the angular frequency is a non-zero integer; otherwise, petals intersect one another.

==== Symmetry ====
All roses display one or more forms of symmetry due to the underlying symmetric and periodic properties of sinusoids.

* A rose specified as is symmetric about the polar axis (the line ) because of the identity that makes the roses specified by the two polar equations coincident.

* A rose specified as is symmetric about the vertical line because of the identity that makes the roses specified by the two polar equations coincident.

* Only certain roses are symmetric about the pole.

* Individual petals are symmetric about the line through the pole and the petal&#x27;s peak, which reflects the symmetry of the half-cycle of the underlying sinusoid. Roses composed of a finite number of petals are, by definition, rotationally symmetric since each petal is the same shape with successive petals rotated about the same angle about the pole.

== Roses with non-zero integer values of &quot;&quot; ==


When is a non-zero integer, the curve will be rose-shaped with &quot;petals&quot; if is even, and petals when is odd. The properties of these roses are a special case of roses with angular frequencies that are rational numbers discussed in the next section of this article.

* The rose is inscribed in the circle , corresponding to the radial coordinate of all of its peaks.

* Because a polar coordinate plot is limited to polar angles between 0 and , there are cycles displayed in the graph. No additional points need be plotted because the radial coordinate at is the same value at (which are crests for two different positive half-cycles for roses specified by the cosine function).

* When is even (and non-zero), the rose is composed of petals, one for each peak in the interval of polar angles displayed. Each peak corresponds to a point lying on the circle . Line segments connecting successive peaks will form a regular polygon with an even number of vertices that has its center at the pole and a radius through each peak, and likewise:
** The roses are symmetric about the pole.
** The roses are symmetric about each line through the pole and a peak (through the &quot;middle&quot; a petal) with the polar angle between the peaks of successive petals being radians. Thus, these roses have rotational symmetry of order .
** The roses are symmetric about each line that bisects the angle between successive peaks, which corresponds to half-cycle boundaries and the apothem of the corresponding polygon.

* When is odd, the rose is composed of the petals, one for each crest (or trough) in the interval of polar angles displayed. Each peak corresponds to a point lying on the circle . These rose&#x27;s positive and negative half-cycles are coincident, which means that in graphing them, only the positive half-cycles or only the negative half-cycles need to plotted in order to form the full curve. (Equivalently, a complete curve will be graphed by plotting any continuous interval of polar angles that is radians long such as to .) Line segments connecting successive peaks will form a regular polygon with an odd number of vertices, and likewise:
** The roses are symmetric about each line through the pole and a peak (through the middle of a petal) with the polar angle between the peaks of successive petals being radians. Thus, these roses have rotational symmetry of order .

* The rose’s petals do not overlap.

* The roses can be specified by algebraic curves of order when is odd, and when is even. 

=== The circle ===
A rose with is a circle that lies on the pole with a diameter that lies on the polar axis when . The circle is the curve&#x27;s single petal. (See the circle being formed at the end of the next section.) In Cartesian coordinates, the equivalent cosine and sine specifications are
:formula_4
and
:formula_5
respectively.

=== The quadrifolium ===
A rose with is called a quadrifolium because it has petals and will form a square. In Cartesian coordinates the cosine and sine specifications are
:formula_6
and
:formula_7
respectively.

=== The trifolium ===
A rose with is called a trifolium because it has petals and will form an equilateral triangle. The curve is also called the Paquerette de Mélibée. In Cartesian Coordinates the cosine and sine specifications are
:formula_8
and
:formula_9
respectively. (See the trifolium being formed at the end of the next section.)

=== The octafolium ===
A rose with is called an octafolium because it has petals and will form an octagon. In Cartesian Coordinates the cosine and sine specifications are
:formula_10
and
:formula_11
respectively.

=== The pentafolium ===
A rose with is called a pentafolium because it has petals and will form a regular pentagon. In Cartesian Coordinates the cosine and sine specifications are
:formula_12
and
:formula_13
respectively.

=== The dodecafolium ===
A rose with is called a dodecafolium because it has petals and will form a dodecagon. In Cartesian Coordinates the cosine and sine specifications are
:formula_14
and
:formula_15
respectively.

===Total and petal areas===
The total area of a rose with polar equation of the form or , where is a non-zero integer, is
:formula_16

When is even, there are petals; and when is odd, there are petals, so the area of each petal is .

As a consequence, if someone wanted to play the popular game He_loves_me..._he_loves_me_not on a rose like above, instead of counting the petals they could calculate the area of the rose to determine the result of the game.

== Roses with rational number values for &quot; ==
In general, when is a rational number in the irreducible fraction form , where and are non-zero integers, the number of petals is the denominator of the expression . This means that the number of petals is if both and are odd, and otherwise.

* In the case when both and are odd, the positive and negative half-cycles of the sinusoid are coincident. The graph of these roses are completed in any continuous interval of polar angles that is long.

* When is even and is odd, or visa versa, the rose will be completely graphed in a continuous polar angle interval long. Furthermore, the roses are symmetric about the pole for both cosine and sine specifications.
** In addition, when is odd and is even, roses specified by the cosine and sine polar equations with the same values of and are coincident. For such a pair of roses, the rose with the sine function specification is coincident with the crest of the rose with the cosine specification at on the polar axis either at or at . (This means that roses and with non-zero integer values of are never coincident.)

* The rose is inscribed in the circle , corresponding to the radial coordinate of all of its peaks.

=== The Dürer folium ===
A rose with is called the Dürer folium, named after the German painter and engraver Albrecht Dürer. The roses specified by and are coincident even though . In Cartesian coordinates the rose is specified as
:formula_17

The Dürer folium is also a trisectrix, a curve that can be used to trisect angles.

=== The limaçon trisectrix ===
A rose with is a limaçon trisectrix that has the property of trisectrix curves that can be used to trisect angles. The rose has a single petal with two loops. (See the animation below.)

== Roses with irrational number values for &quot; ==
A rose curve specified with an irrational number for has an infinite number of petals and will never complete. For example, the sinusoid has a period , so, it has a petal in the polar angle interval with a crest on the polar axis; however there is no other polar angle in the domain of the polar equation that will plot at the coordinates . Overall, roses specified by sinusoids with angular frequencies that are irrational constants form a dense set (that is, they come arbitrarily close to specifying every point in the disk ).

<text>Baron was a Japanese politician and Governor of the Bank of Japan from 1898 to 1903. He was also a member of the House of Peers and served as a cabinet minister in the pre-war government of the Empire of Japan.

== Early life ==
Yamamoto was born in Usuki Ōita Prefecture. He was the younger son of a samurai family of Usuki Domain. After the Meiji Restoration, at 19 he moved to Osaka, and at 22 to Tokyo, where he studied at a school run by the Mitsubishi company.

==Career==
Yamamoto&#x27;s first employment was as a teacher at the Osaka University of Commerce. At 26, he was appointed its principal.

In 1883, Yamamoto turned towards commerce, and obtained a position at the Mitsubishi-affiliated shipping firm Nippon Yusen, in which he rapidly rose through the corporate ranks. In 1890, he joined the Bank of Japan (BOJ), and in 1895 was appointed the chairman of the Yokohama Specie Bank. In April 1896, in order to better acquaint himself with issues pertaining to the gold standard, he travelled to England, and while still in England the following year, was appointed to the board of directors of the Bank of Japan. In October 1898, at the strong request of Bank of Japan governor Iwasaki Yasunosuke, he was recalled to Japan to assume the role of governor of the Bank of Japan. He had been with the Bank of Japan for eight years and was 43 years old at the time.

Yamamoto served as BOJ Governor from October 20, 1898, to October 19, 1903. During his tenure, the Japanese economy experienced various crisis pertaining to foreign exchange issues and the gold and silver standards. However, his greatest concern was the increasing budget deficits incurred by the Japanese government. As head of the Bank of Japan, Yamamoto refused to yield to political pressure from the Japanese Diet, the Cabinet, and the &quot;genrō&quot; to alter his fiscal policies. When political pressure was applied to his subordinates, causing eleven senior managers to resign in protest, Yamamoto used the opportunity to fill the positions with his supporters. Yamamoto’s actions were critical in preserving the future independence of the Bank of Japan from politics. In 1903, the combined efforts of Itō Hirobumi and Yamagata Aritomo managed to dislodge Yamamoto from his position. He was then appointed as a member of the House of Peers, and in 1909 became the head of Nippon Kangyō Ginkō.

In 1911, Prime Minister Saionji Kinmochi decided that he needed an expert in the field of finance to reform the Finance Ministry during his second cabinet, and appointed Yamamoto to become Finance Minister. This was the first time that a businessman had been selected to head a cabinet post, and set a precedent for selecting business executives to head ministries focused on economics or finance. However, with a looming financial crisis in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese War, Yamamoto strongly opposed the Imperial Japanese Army’s demands for additional funding to support an increase in the number of infantry divisions. This issue led directly to the collapse of the Saionji cabinet in 1912. Afterwards, Yamamoto joined the Rikken Seiyūkai political party.

After the start of the Taishō period, during the 1st Yamamoto Gonnohyōe administration, Yamamoto was picked to become Minister of Agriculture and Commerce. Yamamoto also picked another former Bank of Japan governor, Takahashi Korekiyo, to head the Finance Ministry, hoping for a through fiscal revamp of the Japanese government. However, his cabinet was soon brought down by the Siemens scandal. Yamamoto returned again as Minister of Agriculture and Commerce under the subsequent Hara and Takahashi administrations from 1918 to 1922. He was ennobled with the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage title of &quot;danshaku&quot; (baron) in 1920. 

In 1925, Yamamoto joined the new &quot;Seiyūhontō&quot; party, along with Hatoyama Ichirō; however, the party failed to gain popular support and soon merged with the &quot;Kenseikai&quot; to form the &quot;Rikken Minseitō&quot;. However, as a former member of the rival &quot;Seiyūkai&quot;, Yamamoto found himself excluded from the highest ranks of the party leadership, and passed over for any important positions until 1932, when he was appointed as Home Minister under the Saitō Makoto administration in the aftermath of the March 15 incident. As Home Minister, he presided over a more severe interpretation of the Peace Preservation Laws.

Yamamoto continued to serve in the House of Peers until is dissolution by the post-war Constitution of Japan, and died in 1947 at the age of 91. His grave is at Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo.

<doc id="727476" wikidata="Q1330967" url="?curid=727476" title="Page replacement algorithm">
<text>In a computer operating system that uses paging for virtual memory management, page replacement algorithms decide which memory pages to page out, sometimes called swap out, or write to disk, when a page of memory needs to be allocated. Page replacement happens when a requested page is not in memory (page fault) and a free page cannot be used to satisfy the allocation, either because there are none, or because the number of free pages is lower than some threshold.

When the page that was selected for replacement and paged out is referenced again it has to be paged in (read in from disk), and this involves waiting for I/O completion. This determines the &quot;quality&quot; of the page replacement algorithm: the less time waiting for page-ins, the better the algorithm. A page replacement algorithm looks at the limited information about accesses to the pages provided by hardware, and tries to guess which pages should be replaced to minimize the total number of page misses, while balancing this with the costs (primary storage and processor time) of the algorithm itself.

The page replacing problem is a typical online problem from the competitive analysis perspective in the sense that the optimal deterministic algorithm is known.

== History ==
Page replacement algorithms were a hot topic of research and debate in the 1960s and 1970s.
That mostly ended with the development of sophisticated LRU (least recently used) approximations and working set algorithms. Since then, some basic assumptions made by the traditional page replacement algorithms were invalidated, resulting in a revival of research. In particular, the following trends in the behavior of underlying hardware and user-level software have affected the performance of page replacement algorithms:

* Size of primary storage has increased by multiple orders of magnitude. With several gigabytes of primary memory, algorithms that require a periodic check of each and every memory frame are becoming less and less practical.
* Memory hierarchies have grown taller. The cost of a CPU cache miss is far more expensive. This exacerbates the previous problem.
* Locality of reference of user software has weakened. This is mostly attributed to the spread of object-oriented programming techniques that favor large numbers of small functions, use of sophisticated data structures like trees and hash tables that tend to result in chaotic memory reference patterns, and the advent of garbage collection that drastically changed memory access behavior of applications.

Requirements for page replacement algorithms have changed due to differences in operating system kernel architectures. In particular, most modern OS kernels have unified virtual memory and file system caches, requiring the page replacement algorithm to select a page from among the pages of both user program virtual address spaces and cached files. The latter pages have specific properties. For example, they can be locked, or can have write ordering requirements imposed by journaling. Moreover, as the goal of page replacement is to minimize total time waiting for memory, it has to take into account memory requirements imposed by other kernel sub-systems that allocate memory. As a result, page replacement in modern kernels (Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris) tends to work at the level of a general purpose kernel memory allocator, rather than at the higher level of a virtual memory subsystem.

== Local vs. global replacement ==
Replacement algorithms can be &quot;local&quot; or &quot;global.&quot;

When a process incurs a page fault, a local page replacement algorithm selects for replacement some page that belongs to that same process (or a group of processes sharing a memory partition).
A global replacement algorithm is free to select any page in memory.

Local page replacement assumes some form of memory partitioning that determines how many pages are to be assigned to a given process or a group of processes. Most popular forms of partitioning are &quot;fixed partitioning&quot; and &quot;balanced set&quot; algorithms based on the working set model. The advantage of local page replacement is its scalability: each process can handle its page faults independently, leading to more consistent performance for that process. However global page replacement is more efficient on an overall system basis.

== Detecting which pages are referenced and modified ==

Modern general purpose computers and some embedded processors have support for virtual memory. Each process has its own virtual address space. A page table maps a subset of the process virtual addresses to physical addresses. In addition, in most architectures the page table holds an &quot;access&quot; bit and a &quot;dirty&quot; bit for each page in the page table. The CPU sets the access bit when the process reads or writes memory in that page. The CPU sets the dirty bit when the process writes memory in that page. The operating system can modify the access and dirty bits. The operating system can detect accesses to memory and files through the following means:
* By clearing the access bit in pages present in the process&#x27; page table. After some time, the OS scans the page table looking for pages that had the access bit set by the CPU. This is fast because the access bit is set automatically by the CPU and inaccurate because the OS does not immediately receive notice of the access nor does it have information about the order in which the process accessed these pages.
* By removing pages from the process&#x27; page table without necessarily removing them from physical memory. The next access to that page is detected immediately because it causes a page fault. This is slow because a page fault involves a context switch to the OS, software lookup for the corresponding physical address, modification of the page table and a context switch back to the process and accurate because the access is detected immediately after it occurs.
* Directly when the process makes system calls that potentially access the page cache like codice_1 and codice_2 in POSIX.

== Precleaning ==
Most replacement algorithms simply return the target page as their result. This means that if target page is &quot;dirty&quot; (that is, contains data that have to be written to the stable storage before page can be reclaimed), I/O has to be initiated to send that page to the stable storage (to &quot;clean&quot; the page). In the early days of virtual memory, time spent on cleaning was not of much concern, because virtual memory was first implemented on systems with full duplex channels to the stable storage, and cleaning was customarily overlapped with paging. Contemporary commodity hardware, on the other hand, does not support full duplex transfers, and cleaning of target pages becomes an issue.

To deal with this situation, various &quot;precleaning&quot; policies are implemented. Precleaning is the mechanism that starts I/O on dirty pages that are (likely) to be replaced soon. The idea is that by the time the precleaned page is actually selected for the replacement, the I/O will complete and the page will be clean. Precleaning assumes that it is possible to identify pages that will be replaced &quot;next&quot;. Precleaning that is too eager can waste I/O bandwidth by writing pages that manage to get re-dirtied before being selected for replacement.

==The (h,k)-paging problem==
The (h,k)-paging problem is a generalization of the model of paging problem: Let h,k be positive integers such that formula_1. We measure the performance of an algorithm with cache of size formula_1 relative to the theoretically optimal page replacement algorithm. If formula_3, we provide the optimal page replacement algorithm with strictly less resource.

The (h,k)-paging problem is a way to measure how an online algorithm performs by comparing it with the performance of the optimal algorithm, specifically, separately parameterizing the cache size of the online algorithm and optimal algorithm.

==Marking algorithms==
Marking algorithms is a general class of paging algorithms. For each page, we associate it with a bit called its mark. Initially, we set all pages as unmarked. During a stage (a period of operation or a sequence of requests) of page requests, we mark a page when it is first requested in this stage. A marking algorithm is such an algorithm that never pages out a marked page.

If ALG is a marking algorithm with a cache of size k, and OPT is the optimal algorithm with a cache of size h, where formula_1, then ALG is formula_5-competitive. So every marking algorithm attains the formula_5-competitive ratio.

LRU is a marking algorithm while FIFO is not a marking algorithm.

==Conservative algorithms==
An algorithm is conservative, if on any consecutive request sequence containing k or fewer distinct page references, the algorithm will incur k or fewer page faults.

If ALG is a conservative algorithm with a cache of size k, and OPT is the optimal algorithm with a cache of formula_1, then ALG is formula_5-competitive. So every conservative algorithm attains the formula_5-competitive ratio.

LRU, FIFO and CLOCK are conservative algorithms.

==Page replacement algorithms==
There are a variety of page replacement algorithms:

===The theoretically optimal page replacement algorithm===
The theoretically optimal page replacement algorithm (also known as OPT, clairvoyant replacement algorithm, or Bélády&#x27;s optimal page replacement policy) is an algorithm that works as follows: when a page needs to be swapped in, the operating system swaps out the page whose next use will occur farthest in the future. For example, a page that is not going to be used for the next 6 seconds will be swapped out over a page that is going to be used within the next 0.4 seconds.

This algorithm cannot be implemented in a general purpose operating system because it is impossible to compute reliably how long it will be before a page is going to be used, except when all software that will run on a system is either known beforehand and is amenable to static analysis of its memory reference patterns, or only a class of applications allowing run-time analysis. Despite this limitation, algorithms exist that can offer near-optimal performance — the operating system keeps track of all pages referenced by the program, and it uses those data to decide which pages to swap in and out on subsequent runs. This algorithm can offer near-optimal performance, but not on the first run of a program, and only if the program&#x27;s memory reference pattern is relatively consistent each time it runs.

Analysis of the paging problem has also been done in the field of online algorithms. Efficiency of randomized online algorithms for the paging problem is measured using amortized analysis.

===Not recently used===
The not recently used (NRU) page replacement algorithm is an algorithm that favours keeping pages in memory that have been recently used. This algorithm works on the following principle: when a page is referenced, a referenced bit is set for that page, marking it as referenced. Similarly, when a page is modified (written to), a modified bit is set. The setting of the bits is usually done by the hardware, although it is possible to do so on the software level as well.

At a certain fixed time interval, a timer interrupt triggers and clears the referenced bit of all the pages, so only pages referenced within the current timer interval are marked with a referenced bit. When a page needs to be replaced, the operating system divides the pages into four classes:

:3. referenced, modified
:2. referenced, not modified
:1. not referenced, modified
:0. not referenced, not modified
Although it does not seem possible for a page to be modified yet not referenced, this happens when a class 3 page has its referenced bit cleared by the timer interrupt. The NRU algorithm picks a random page from the lowest category for removal. So out of the above four page categories, the NRU algorithm will replace a not-referenced, not-modified page if such a page exists. Note that this algorithm implies that a modified but not-referenced (within the last timer interval) page is less important than a not-modified page that is intensely referenced.

NRU is a marking algorithm, so it is formula_5-competitive.

===First-in, first-out===
The simplest page-replacement algorithm is a FIFO algorithm. The first-in, first-out (FIFO) page replacement algorithm is a low-overhead algorithm that requires little bookkeeping on the part of the operating system. The idea is obvious from the name – the operating system keeps track of all the pages in memory in a queue, with the most recent arrival at the back, and the oldest arrival in front. When a page needs to be replaced, the page at the front of the queue (the oldest page) is selected. While FIFO is cheap and intuitive, it performs poorly in practical application. Thus, it is rarely used in its unmodified form. This algorithm experiences Bélády&#x27;s anomaly.
In simple words, on a page fault, the frame that has been in memory the longest is replaced.

FIFO page replacement algorithm is used by the OpenVMS operating system, with some modifications. Partial second chance is provided by skipping a limited number of entries with valid translation table references, and additionally, pages are displaced from process working set to a systemwide pool from which they can be recovered if not already re-used.

FIFO is a conservative algorithm, so it is formula_5-competitive.

===Second-chance===
A modified form of the FIFO page replacement algorithm, known as the Second-chance page replacement algorithm, fares relatively better than FIFO at little cost for the improvement. It works by looking at the front of the queue as FIFO does, but instead of immediately paging out that page, it checks to see if its referenced bit is set. If it is not set, the page is swapped out. Otherwise, the referenced bit is cleared, the page is inserted at the back of the queue (as if it were a new page) and this process is repeated. This can also be thought of as a circular queue. If all the pages have their referenced bit set, on the second encounter of the first page in the list, that page will be swapped out, as it now has its referenced bit cleared. If all the pages have their reference bit cleared, then second chance algorithm degenerates into pure FIFO.

As its name suggests, Second-chance gives every page a &quot;second-chance&quot; – an old page that has been referenced is probably in use, and should not be swapped out over a new page that has not been referenced.

===Clock===
Clock is a more efficient version of FIFO than Second-chance because pages don&#x27;t have to be constantly pushed to the back of the list, but it performs the same general function as Second-Chance. The clock algorithm keeps a circular list of pages in memory, with the &quot;hand&quot; (iterator) pointing to the last examined page frame in the list. When a page fault occurs and no empty frames exist, then the R (referenced) bit is inspected at the hand&#x27;s location. If R is 0, the new page is put in place of the page the &quot;hand&quot; points to, and the hand is advanced one position. Otherwise, the R bit is cleared, then the clock hand is incremented and the process is repeated until a page is replaced. This algorithm was first described in 1969 by Fernando J. Corbató.

====Variants of clock====
* GCLOCK: Generalized clock page replacement algorithm.
* Clock-Pro keeps a circular list of information about recently referenced pages, including all M pages in memory as well as the most recent M pages that have been paged out. This extra information on paged-out pages, like the similar information maintained by ARC, helps it work better than LRU on large loops and one-time scans.
* WSclock. By combining the Clock algorithm with the concept of a working set (i.e., the set of pages expected to be used by that process during some time interval), the performance of the algorithm can be improved. In practice, the &quot;aging&quot; algorithm and the &quot;WSClock&quot; algorithm are probably the most important page replacement algorithms.
* Clock with Adaptive Replacement (CAR) is a page replacement algorithm that has performance comparable to ARC, and substantially outperforms both LRU and CLOCK. The algorithm CAR is self-tuning and requires no user-specified magic parameters.

CLOCK is a conservative algorithm, so it is formula_5-competitive.

===Least recently used===
The least recently used (LRU) page replacement algorithm, though similar in name to NRU, differs in the fact that LRU keeps track of page usage over a short period of time, while NRU just looks at the usage in the last clock interval. LRU works on the idea that pages that have been most heavily used in the past few instructions are most likely to be used heavily in the next few instructions too. While LRU can provide near-optimal performance in theory (almost as good as adaptive replacement cache), it is rather expensive to implement in practice. There are a few implementation methods for this algorithm that try to reduce the cost yet keep as much of the performance as possible.

The most expensive method is the linked list method, which uses a linked list containing all the pages in memory. At the back of this list is the least recently used page, and at the front is the most recently used page. The cost of this implementation lies in the fact that items in the list will have to be moved about every memory reference, which is a very time-consuming process.

Another method that requires hardware support is as follows: suppose the hardware has a 64-bit counter that is incremented at every instruction. Whenever a page is accessed, it acquires the value equal to the counter at the time of page access. Whenever a page needs to be replaced, the operating system selects the page with the lowest counter and swaps it out.

Because of implementation costs, one may consider algorithms (like those that follow) that are similar to LRU, but which offer cheaper implementations.

One important advantage of the LRU algorithm is that it is amenable to full statistical analysis. It has been proven, for example, that LRU can never result in more than N-times more page faults than OPT algorithm, where N is proportional to the number of pages in the managed pool.

On the other hand, LRU&#x27;s weakness is that its performance tends to degenerate under many quite common reference patterns. For example, if there are N pages in the LRU pool, an application executing a loop over array of N + 1 pages will cause a page fault on each and every access. As loops over large arrays are common, much effort has been put into modifying LRU to work better in such situations. Many of the proposed LRU modifications try to detect looping reference patterns and to switch into suitable replacement algorithm, like Most Recently Used (MRU).

====Variants on LRU====
# LRU-K evicts the page whose K-th most recent access is furthest in the past. For example, LRU-1 is simply LRU whereas LRU-2 evicts pages according to the time of their penultimate access. LRU-K improves greatly on LRU with regards to locality in time.
# The ARC algorithm extends LRU by maintaining a history of recently evicted pages and uses this to change preference to recent or frequent access. It is particularly resistant to sequential scans.
# The 2Q algorithm improves upon the LRU and LRU/2 algorithm. By having two queues, one for hot-path items and the other for slow-path items, items are first placed in the slow-path queue and after a second access of the items placed in the hot-path items. Because references to added items are longer hold than in the LRU and LRU/2 algorithm, it has a better hot-path queue which improves the hit rate of the cache.

A comparison of ARC with other algorithms (LRU, MQ, 2Q, LRU-2, LRFU, LIRS) can be found in Megiddo &amp; Modha 2004.

LRU is a marking algorithm, so it is formula_5-competitive.

===Random===
Random replacement algorithm replaces a random page in memory. This eliminates the overhead cost of tracking page references. Usually it fares better than FIFO, and for looping memory references it is better than LRU, although generally LRU performs better in practice. OS/390 uses global LRU approximation and falls back to random replacement when LRU performance degenerates, and the Intel i860 processor used a random replacement policy (Rhodehamel 1989).

===Not frequently used (NFU)===
The not frequently used (NFU) page replacement algorithm requires a counter, and every page has one counter of its own which is initially set to 0. At each clock interval, all pages that have been referenced within that interval will have their counter incremented by 1. In effect, the counters keep track of how frequently a page has been used. Thus, the page with the lowest counter can be swapped out when necessary.

The main problem with NFU is that it keeps track of the frequency of use without regard to the time span of use. Thus, in a multi-pass compiler, pages which were heavily used during the first pass, but are not needed in the second pass will be favoured over pages which are comparably lightly used in the second pass, as they have higher frequency counters. This results in poor performance. Other common scenarios exist where NFU will perform similarly, such as an OS boot-up. Thankfully, a similar and better algorithm exists, and its description follows.

The not frequently used page-replacement algorithm generates fewer page faults than the least recently used page replacement algorithm when the page table contains null pointer values.

===Aging===
The aging algorithm is a descendant of the NFU algorithm, with modifications to make it aware of the time span of use. Instead of just incrementing the counters of pages referenced, putting equal emphasis on page references regardless of the time, the reference counter on a page is first shifted right (divided by 2), before adding the referenced bit to the left of that binary number. For instance, if a page has referenced bits 1,0,0,1,1,0 in the past 6 clock ticks, its referenced counter will look like this in chronological order: 10000000, 01000000, 00100000, 10010000, 11001000, 01100100. Page references closer to the present time have more impact than page references long ago. This ensures that pages referenced more recently, though less frequently referenced, will have higher priority over pages more frequently referenced in the past. Thus, when a page needs to be swapped out, the page with the lowest counter will be chosen.

The following Python code simulates the aging algorithm.
Counters formula_14 are initialized with and updated as described above via formula_15, using arithmetic shift operators.

from collections.abc import Sequence

def simulate_aging(Rs: Sequence, k: int) -&gt; None:
 # Simulate aging
 print(&quot; t | R-bits (0-{length}) | Counters for pages 0-{length}&quot;.format(length=len(Rs)))
 Vs = [0] * len(Rs[0])
 for t, R in enumerate(Rs):
 Vs[:] = [R[i] « (k - 1) | V » 1
 for i, V in enumerate(Vs)]
 print(&quot;{:02d} | {} | [{}]&quot;.format(t, R,
 &quot;, &quot;.join([&quot;{:0{}b}&quot;.format(V, k)
 for V in Vs])))

In the given example of R-bits for 6 pages over 5 clock ticks, the function prints the following output, which lists the R-bits for each clock tick and the individual counter values formula_14 for each page in binary representation.

»&gt; Rs = 1,0,1,0,1,1], [1,1,0,0,1,0], [1,1,0,1,0,1], [1,0,0,0,1,0], [0,1,1,0,0,0
»&gt; k = 8
»&gt; simulate_aging(Rs, k)
 t | R-bits (0-5) | Counters for pages 0-5
00 | [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1] | [10000000, 00000000, 10000000, 00000000, 10000000, 10000000]
01 | [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0] | [11000000, 10000000, 01000000, 00000000, 11000000, 01000000]
02 | [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1] | [11100000, 11000000, 00100000, 10000000, 01100000, 10100000]
03 | [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0] | [11110000, 01100000, 00010000, 01000000, 10110000, 01010000]
04 | [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0] | [01111000, 10110000, 10001000, 00100000, 01011000, 00101000]
Note that aging differs from LRU in the sense that aging can only keep track of the references in the latest (depending on the bit size of the processor&#x27;s integers) time intervals. Consequently, two pages may have referenced counters of 00000000, even though one page was referenced 9 intervals ago and the other 1000 intervals ago. Generally speaking, knowing the usage within the past 16 intervals is sufficient for making a good decision as to which page to swap out. Thus, aging can offer near-optimal performance for a moderate price.

===Longest distance first (LDF) page replacement algorithm===
The basic idea behind this algorithm is Locality of Reference as used in LRU but the difference is that in LDF, locality is based on distance not on the used references. In the LDF, replace the page which is on longest distance from the current page. If two pages are on same distance then the page which is next to current page in anti-clock rotation will get replaced.

== Implementation details ==

===Techniques for hardware with no reference bit===
Many of the techniques discussed above assume the presence of a reference bit associated with each page. Some hardware has no such bit, so its efficient use requires techniques that operate well without one.

One notable example is VAX hardware running OpenVMS. This system knows if a page has been modified, but not necessarily if a page has been read. Its approach is known as Secondary Page Caching. Pages removed from working sets (process-private memory, generally) are placed on special-purpose lists while remaining in physical memory for some time. Removing a page from a working set is not technically a page-replacement operation, but effectively identifies that page as a candidate. A page whose backing store is still valid (whose contents are not dirty, or otherwise do not need to be preserved) is placed on the tail of the Free Page List. A page that requires writing to backing store will be placed on the Modified Page List. These actions are typically triggered when the size of the Free Page List falls below an adjustable threshold.

Pages may be selected for working set removal in an essentially random fashion, with the expectation that if a poor choice is made, a future reference may retrieve that page from the Free or Modified list before it is removed from physical memory. A page referenced this way will be removed from the Free or Modified list and placed back into a process working set. The Modified Page List additionally provides an opportunity to write pages out to backing store in groups of more than one page, increasing efficiency. These pages can then be placed on the Free Page List. The sequence of pages that works its way to the head of the Free Page List resembles the results of a LRU or NRU mechanism and the overall effect has similarities to the Second-Chance algorithm described earlier.

Another example is used by the Linux kernel on ARM. The lack of hardware functionality is made up for by providing two page tables – the processor-native page tables, with neither referenced bits nor dirty bits, and software-maintained page tables with the required bits present. The emulated bits in the software-maintained table are set by page faults. In order to get the page faults, clearing emulated bits in the second table revokes some of the access rights to the corresponding page, which is implemented by altering the native table.

=== Page cache in Linux ===
Linux uses a unified page cache for
* codice_3 and anonymous codice_4ed-regions. This includes the heap and stack of user-space programs. It is written to swap when paged out.
* Non-anonymous (file-backed) codice_4ed regions. If present in memory and not privately modified the physical page is shared with file cache or buffer.
* Shared memory acquired through codice_6.
* The tmpfs in-memory filesystem; written to swap when paged out.
* The file cache including; written to the underlying block storage (possibly going through the buffer, see below) when paged out.
* The cache of block devices, called the &quot;buffer&quot; by Linux (not to be confused with other structures also called buffers like those use for pipes and buffers used internally in Linux); written to the underlying storage when paged out.
The unified page cache operates on units of the smallest page size supported by the CPU (4 KiB in ARMv8, x86 and x86-64) with some pages of the next larger size (2 MiB in x86-64) called &quot;huge pages&quot; by Linux. The pages in the page cache are divided in an &quot;active&quot; set and an &quot;inactive&quot; set. Both sets keep a LRU list of pages. In the basic case, when a page is accessed by a user-space program it is put in the head of the inactive set. When it is accessed repeatedly, it is moved to the active list. Linux moves the pages from the active set to the inactive set as needed so that the active set is smaller than the inactive set. When a page is moved to the inactive set it is removed from the page table of any process address space, without being paged out of physical memory. When a page is removed from the inactive set, it is paged out of physical memory. The size of the &quot;active&quot; and &quot;inactive&quot; list can be queried from codice_7 in the fields &quot;Active&quot;, &quot;Inactive&quot;, &quot;Active(anon)&quot;, &quot;Inactive(anon)&quot;, &quot;Active(file)&quot; and &quot;Inactive(file)&quot;.

== Working set ==

The working set of a process is the set of pages expected to be used by that process during some time interval.

The &quot;working set model&quot; isn&#x27;t a page replacement algorithm in the strict sense (it&#x27;s actually a kind of medium-term scheduler)

<text>was a general in the Imperial Japanese Army, Army Minister and Governor-General of Korea from 1927 to 1929.

==Biography==
===Military career===
A native of Osumi District in Sagami Province (part of the present-day city of Hiratsuka, Kanagawa Prefecture), Yamanashi graduated from the former 8th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1886. After serving in the IJA 5th Infantry Regiment, he graduated with honors from the 8th class of the Army Staff College in 1892. He was assigned to the IJA 4th Infantry Brigade and served in combat as an infantry platoon commander during the First Sino-Japanese War with the IJA 2nd Army.

After the war, Yamanashi&#x27;s rise through the ranks was steady and rapid. He served in a number of administrative and staff positions, before being posted to Germany as a military attaché from 1898 to 1902.

During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 to 1905, Yamanashi was vice chief-of-staff of the IJA 2nd Army and subsequently chief-of-staff of the IJA 3rd Division. He was promoted to lieutenant commander in late 1904. He returned to Europe immediately after the end of the war as military attaché to Austria-Hungary, serving from the end of 1905 to 1907, and again to Germany from 1907.

Yamanashi was promoted to major general in 1911, and assigned command of the IJA 30th Infantry Brigade. He was transferred to the IJA 1st Infantry Brigade the following year. After serving in a number of administrative positions within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff, he was assigned as chief-of-staff of the IJA 18th Division at the Battle of Tsingtao in World War I. In 1916, Yamanashi was promoted to lieutenant general, and in 1921 he was promoted to full general.

===Political career===
From 1921 to 1923, Yamanashi served as Army Minister under the cabinets of Prime Ministers Hara, Takahashi and Katō Tomosaburō. As Army Minister, Yamanashi initiated reforms which cut 2200 officers and 60,000 men from the roster of the Imperial Japanese Army. This was equivalent to approximately five divisions, but as it was spread out across the entire army, the effects were less noticeable than the subsequent abolishment of four divisions outright by Yamanashi&#x27;s successor, Ugaki Kazushige. Yamanashi also unsuccessfully attempted to challenge the entrenched concept within the Imperial Japanese Army that &quot;spirit&quot; (, or &quot;yamato-damashii&quot;) could prevail over deficiencies in modern weaponry or technology. However, at the end of his tenure, the Imperial Japanese Army was still behind the other major powers in terms of mechanization and aviation.

During the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, Yamanashi was appointed martial law commander of the Tokyo region, until the post was abolished in November 1923, but continued to be head of the Tokyo regional police forces through August 1924. In 1925 he was promoted to the honorific title of Junior Third Court Rank.

Yamanashi retired from active military service in 1927. From December 1927 to August 1929, Yamanashi served as Japanese Governor-General of Korea. He followed the relatively lenient policies established by his predecessors, and there was little significant change in Korea under Japanese rule during his tenure.

However, while in Korea, he became embroiled in a prominent corruption scandal in which he was accused of having accepted a very large bribe from a rice merchant who wanted to expand into the Korean market. The accusation had political overtones, as Yamanashi was increasingly involved in Rikken Seiyūkai politics and was being touted as a possible successor to his mentor, Tanaka Giichi. Although Yamanashi was acquitted, a number of his close associates were convicted, and he retired from public life at the end of 1929. Yamanashi died of natural causes at his home in Kamakura, Kanagawa in 1944 at the age of 80.

<doc id="727478" wikidata="Q2403252" url="?curid=727478" title="Ten Thousand Villages">
<text>Ten Thousand Villages is a nonprofit, fair trade organization that markets handcrafted products made by artisans from more than 120 artisan groups in more than 35 countries.

As one of the world&#x27;s largest and oldest fair trade organizations, Ten Thousand Villages aims to cultivate long-term buying relationships in which artisans receive a fair price for their work, and consumers have access to gifts, accessories, and home décor from around the world. Ten Thousand Villages is a founding member of the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO) and a certified member of the Fair Trade Federation (FTF).

==History==

Edna Ruth Byler founded the organization after witnessing extreme poverty during a trip to Puerto Rico in 1946. 

Byler, with the help of the Mennonite Central Committee, began selling handcrafted products from the boot of her car, eventually expanding to a storefront called Self Help Crafts in 1958. She wanted to promote sustainable economic opportunities for artisans in developing countries by creating a viable marketplace for their products. The original philosophy of Ten Thousand Villages was inspired by Mennonite values including compassion, service, mutual aid, and peacemaking. 

Over the past 30 years, Byler has worked to connect individual entrepreneurs in developing countries with market opportunities in North America.

In the 1970s, the small project moved out of Byler&#x27;s basement to become SELFHELP Crafts of the World, an official program of the Mennonite Central Committee. In 1994, the company became a member of the Fair Trade Federation. In 1996, SELFHELP became Ten Thousand Villages. The new name was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi who said, “India is not to be found in its few cities but in the 700,000 villages”.

In 2006-2007 fiscal year, the company increased purchases from artisans by more than one million dollars. In 2007, Ten Thousand Villages redesigned stores to minimize environmental impact in order to meet what they call their &quot;triple bottom line&quot; of economic, environmental and social sustainability.

By 2008, the company’s sales had surpassed $25.5 million, one third of which was paid to artisans directly. The other two thirds covered importing, storage, marketing, retail costs, and administration.

In 2012, Ten Thousand Villages and the Mennonite Central Committee entered into a partnership agreement. Ten Thousand Villages is no longer wholly owned by MCC.

In 2019, Gordon Zook became the company&#x27;s CEO.

In June 2020, Ten Thousand Villages Canada closed corporate operations. Through a licensing agreement, four stores using the Ten Thousand Villages brand remained open. A few other stores rebranded and continued operating independently.

In May 2022, Dan Alonso was appointed as the new CEO of Ten Thousand Villages, succeeding Gordon Zook.

In January 2025, it was announced that company-owned US retail locations would be closed, leaving independent non-profit board run stores as their brick and mortar channel. Ten Thousand Villages will continue e-commerce retailing as well as wholesaling to their fair-trade affiliates.

==Artisan partners==

Ten Thousand Villages encourages artisans to employ production methods that are environmentally sustainable and to use recycled and natural materials whenever possible.

Ten Thousand Villages establishes long-term trade relationships with groups that work with craftspeople who are in need of work and who produce crafts that are more likely to be sold in North America. Most of these groups are found in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East. The company often selects artisan partners that provide training and employment to those who have virtually no chance of securing employment in the mainstream labor market. Many of these artisans are disadvantaged because of disability or gender.

Ten Thousand Villages also purchases from export businesses that market handicraft products on behalf of artisans who lack access to markets. These groups provide tools and sustainable sources of income for small artisan workshops to develop their infrastructure and build business capacity.

Prices are determined by a combination of what the artisan believes fair and demand in the foreign market. Artisans are paid up-front fifty percent of the agreed-upon price in order to help them pay for the raw materials used in their products; the other fifty percent is paid once the products are complete. The artisans are paid in full before their products are sold in North America, even if they never get sold. Ten Thousand Villages’ marketing director Doug Dirks estimated that market prices abroad are up to five times what is paid to the artisan. He said that his company is willing to take that risk because they feel that it is important to what they do. Most of the artisans in these countries cannot obtain business loans from their local banks.

==Operations==

The Ten Thousand Villages USA headquarters is currently located in Akron, Pennsylvania. The company uses sales profits to increase purchases from artisan partners and to expand its domestic distribution channels. 

Ten Thousand Villages is a wholesaler as well as a retailer.

=== Merchandise ===
Ten Thousand Villages offers handmade home décor and gifts from around the world, including baskets, sculptures, jewelry, instruments, toys, tableware, planters, linens, stationery, various holiday items and other accessories. Most Ten Thousand Villages stores also sell fair trade food items such as chocolate, tea, rice, dried fruit, and coffee.

==Media==
In 2005, Ten Thousand Villages released &quot;The Power of Trading Fairly,&quot; a DVD highlighting artisan partners from Bangladesh, Guatemala and Kenya, and how their lives have been improved by fair trade.

In 2006, Make Trade Fair was released, a compilation CD to raise awareness and funds for Ten Thousand Villages.

== Impact ==

Anecdotal evidence suggests that Ten Thousand Villages has had life-altering effects on its artisan partners. Its fair trade practices directly support tens of thousands of artisans around the world. In 2009 the company conducted their “One Reason Why” campaign which showcased some of these anecdotal stories. The campaign revolved around printed and digital materials (such as bookmarks and DVDs) that presented artisans’ “one reason why” fair trade had made a difference in their lives. Also, some of the generally small artisan groups or families have transformed into full-fledged businesses that employ hundreds to thousands of people. However, little research has been conducted to determine the quantitative impact of Ten Thousand Villages and its worldwide fair trade partnerships.

<text>Yang Zhu (; ; 440–c.360 BC), also known as Yangzi (Master Yang), was a Chinese philosopher during the Warring States period. An early ethical egoist alternative to Mohist and Confucian thought, Yang Zhu&#x27;s surviving ideas appear primarily in the Chinese texts &quot;Huainanzi&quot;, &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot;, &quot;Mengzi&quot;, and possibly the &quot;Liezi&quot; and &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;. He founded the philosophical school of &quot;Yangism&quot;.

The philosophies attributed to Yang Zhu, as presented in the &quot;Liezi&quot;, clash with the primarily Daoist influence of the rest of the work. Of particular note is his recognition of self-preservation (&quot;weiwo&quot; 為我), which has led him to be credited with &quot;the discovery of the body&quot;. In comparison with other Chinese philosophical giants, Yang Zhu has recently faded into relative obscurity, but his influence in his own time was so widespread that Mencius described his philosophies along with the antithetical ideas of Mozi as &quot;floods and wild animals that ravage the land&quot;.

==Views==
===Mencius&#x27;s view of Yang Zhu===
According to Mencius, &quot;Yang&#x27;s principle is, &#x27;Each for himself&#x27;—which does not acknowledge the claims of the sovereign. Mo&#x27;s principle is, &#x27;To love all equally&#x27;—which does not acknowledge the peculiar affection due to a father. To acknowledge neither king nor father is to be in the state of the beast. If their principles are not stopped, and the principles of Confucius set forth, their perverse speaking will delude the people, and stop up the path of benevolence and righteousness.&quot;

Mencius criticized Yang Zhu as one &quot;who would not pluck a hair from his body to benefit the world.&quot; However, Yang Zhu emphasized that self-impairment, symbolized by the plucking of one&#x27;s hair, would in no way lead to others&#x27; benefit. Although he would not toil for others, he would not harm them for personal gain or advantage, which should be avoided as external to one&#x27;s nature.

Yang Zhu taught, &quot;If everyone does not harm a single hair, and if everyone does not benefit the world, the world will be well governed of itself.&quot; In other words, everyone should mind their own business, neither giving nor taking from others, and be content with what he has, and in that way one will be happy and also contribute to the welfare of the world. When personal interests conflict with collective interests or national interests, more respect and protection of personal interests should be taken. On the surface, this seems to be unfavorable to society and the collective, and it is also the most vulnerable to questioning and criticism. In fact, on the contrary, this has safeguarded both personal interests and social interests. Because the foundation of society exists for people, not people to exist for society.

===Philosophy of nature===

Although his detractors present him as a hedonist, Epicurean, and egoist, Yang Zhu was, according to contemporary sources, an early Daoist teacher identified with a new philosophical trend toward naturalism as the best means of preserving life in a decadent and turbulent world.

All beings, thought Yang Zhu, have the survival instinct, but man, the highest of creatures, lacking the strength of animals, must rely on intelligence to survive rather than strength. He felt that strength was despicable when used against others.

===Philosophy of life===
Yang Zhu directed his thought to attainment of the spiritual self through self-expression and finding contentment.
Henri Maspero described Yang&#x27;s philosophy as &quot;a mixture of pessimism and fatalism&quot;. The Yang Zhu chapter of &quot;Liezi&quot; says:
One hundred years is the limit of a long life. Not one in a thousand ever attains it. Suppose there is one such person. Infancy and feeble old age take almost half of his time. Rest during sleep at night and what is wasted during the waking hours in the daytime take almost half of that. Pain and sickness, sorrow and suffering, death (of relatives) and worry and fear take almost half of the rest. In the ten and some years that is left, I reckon, there is not one moment in which we can be happy, at ease without worry. This being the case, what is life for? What pleasure is there? For beauty and abundance, that is all. For music and sex, that is all. But the desire for beauty and abundance cannot always be satisfied, and music and sex cannot always be enjoyed. Besides, we are prohibited by punishment and exhorted by rewards, pushed by fame and checked by law. We busily strive for the empty praise which is only temporary, and seek extra glory that would come after death. Being alone ourselves, we pay great care to what our ears hear and what our eyes see, and are much concerned with what is right or wrong for our bodies and minds. Thus we lose the great happiness of the present and cannot give ourselves free rein for a single moment. What is the difference between that and many chains and double prisons?

===Philosophy of death===
Yang Zhu agreed with the search for happiness, but he felt one should not strive for life beyond one&#x27;s allotted span, nor should one unnecessarily shorten one&#x27;s life. Death is as natural as life, Yang Zhu felt, and therefore should be viewed with neither fear nor awe. Funeral ceremonies are of no worth to the deceased. &quot;Dead people are not concerned whether their bodies are buried in coffins, cremated, dumped in water or in a ditch; nor whether the body is dressed in fine clothes. What matters most is that before death strikes one lives life to the fullest.&quot;

<text>The Salpa Line (, literally &quot;Latch line&quot;; ), or its official name, Suomen Salpa (&quot;Finland&#x27;s Latch&quot;), is a bunker line on the eastern border of Finland. It was built in 1940–1941 during the Interim Peace between the Winter War and the Continuation War and further in 1944 to defend Finland against a possible Soviet invasion.

The line is 1,200 kilometres long, stretching from the Gulf of Finland to Petsamo (now Pechenga, Russia). It never saw military action because the Soviet offensive in 1944 was stopped at the VKT-line on the Karelian Isthmus. The fortifications of the Salpa Line were significantly more complete and stronger than those of the Mannerheim Line.

==Construction==
The planning of the Salpa Line was commissioned by general Rudolf Walden and the construction began at the end of the Winter War in 1940. At first, volunteers worked there—then people ineligible for the war service were mobilized. The maximum number of workers, on site was near 35,000 in the spring of 1941. After the beginning of the Continuation War on 25 June 1941 the fortification work was stopped, pillboxes and bunkers were stripped of armaments, which were sent to the front. As the tide of the conflict turned, and the front began to approach the prewar Finnish borders in early 1944, the work on the Salpa Line resumed and continued until the end of the Continuation War on 4 September 1944.

==Line composition and terrain==
728 various concrete installations, 315 km of wire obstacles, 225 km of anti-tank obstacles, 130 km of anti-tank ditches, more than 3,000 entrenchments, 254 concrete infantry shelters, trenches, rifleman&#x27;s cells and dugouts composed the power and strength of this defence line. The line even employed old 11 and 9 inch coastal mortars from the late 19th century, due to unavailability of more modern artillery.

Numerous lakes, marshes and small rocks were also incorporated in the defence line. For example, the Lake Saimaa area is a labyrinth of lakes of varying sizes, islands, straits and rivers, making the area very easy to defend. 90% of all the concrete installations of the &quot;Salpa Line&quot; were on the line between the Gulf of Finland and the Lake Saimaa waterway system. This part, as the original post-Winter War defence line, was also referred with the name &quot;Luumäki-Suomenlahti-linja&quot; (Luumäki-Gulf of Finland line) or simply as &quot;Luumäen linja&quot; (Lake Saimaa is situated north of Luumäki).

==Impact on the war==
The fortifications were never used in combat because the Red Army was stopped at the end of the Continuation War well before its advance units reached Salpa (see Battle of Tali-Ihantala). The line was partially manned with old reservists in the summer of 1944. The existence of the fortified line was an advantage for the Finns in the subsequent peace talks.

==Present day==
The remains of the decommissioned line serve as a tourist attraction. On the southernmost part of the Salpa Line is located the Salpa Line Museum (Salpa linja -museo) that was founded in 1987 by the Miehikkälä municipality and the Second World War veteran organisations.

====History====
Some of the Salpa Line objects dates back to the Winter War. In Lieksa &quot;Viisikon Salpalinja etusema&quot; was started to be built already during the pre-Winter War extra military training period . The name &quot;Viisikko&quot; refers to the name of the village and can be translated as &quot;The Five&quot;. The other names of the village are Hattuvaara (of Lieksa) or just Hattu (a Hat). The battles in Hattu are related to the battles of Lieksa from the very first war day, 30 November 1939 to 27 December 1939. The Soviet forces attacked against the Viisikko positions on 9 December 1939 and it had to start to withdraw on Christmas Day.

The other place where there have been battles during the Winter War was in the Änänkäinen and Puuruu lake areas. On the very first war day, the Soviet troops tried to capture the Kiviranta border control post just after 7 o&#x27;clock in the morning, but the prepared and reinforced Finnish border troops succeeded in slowing the speed of the attacking forces and only by the evening the Finnish border troops had withdrawn to Äninkäinen position, where the positions of the 13th separate battalion were. The Finnish counter-attack took place the next day, 1 December 1939. The 13th separate battalion was assisted by the 12th separate battalion, which had come to the place. Both the battalions attacked until the Soviet troops stopped them on the crossroad of Hattuselkonen. Then 12th separate battalion occupied the Änänkäinen position, while the 13th battalion was withdrawing driven by the Soviet troops to the Nurmijärvi of Lieksa. The Laklajoki position was missed almost without a fight. The delay action actually started only 2 December. The Soviet troops started harassing with artillery fire on 3 December and continued to do so for five days. In the first days of December also in Kuhmo the Sivakka road-crossing was lost in Kuhmo, which made it possible for the Soviet troops to go the Nurmijärvi of Lieksa to the back side of the Aninkäinen defenders.

The 13th separate battalion hold the positions and the 12th separate battalion was ordered to withdraw to Puuruu to reinforce the next possible defence position about four kilometres back. The mortars of the 12th battalion were left to reinforce those of the 13th battalion.

In four days, 7 December, the Soviet troops succeeded to take the front positions of the Finnish troops making it hard for the 12th battalion to keep its positions in Änänkäinen region. The same day the Finns destroyed a big Soviet patrol and learned, that the Soviet infantry regiment 529 will cover the southern side of the attacking Soviet division 54, which was to go to Kuhmo. The reinforced 529th regiment consisted of 6,000 soldiers added by 40 cannons and 20 tanks. The idea had been to occupy Lieksa in the independence day of Finland and then go to Nurmes 10 December and then towards Kajaani. The main target was Oulu on the West coast of Finland to cut the country into two halves.

On 8 December 13 separate battalion was allowed to withdraw from Änäkäinen to Nurmijärvi through Puuruu positions. Delaying by almost a week the Soviet troops in front of Änäkäinen provided time for building the new positions in Puuruu.

====Places====
====Other====
Near Puuruu lake there is a memorial plate attached on the granite stone with the text &quot;TÄÄLLÄ TAISTELTIIN 9–25.12.1939&quot; (&quot;The fights went on here from 9 to 25 December 1939&quot;) to commemorate the Lieksa battles.

<doc id="727491" wikidata="Q3495262" url="?curid=727491" title="St James's Palace Stakes">
<text>The St James&#x27;s Palace Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to three-year-old colts. It is run at Ascot over a distance of 7 furlongs and 213 yards (1,603 metres). It is scheduled to be run each year in June.

==History==
The event is named after St James&#x27;s Palace, a royal residence during the Tudor period. It was established in 1834, and the inaugural race was a walkover.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and for a period, the St James&#x27;s Palace Stakes was classed at Group 2 level. It was promoted to Group 1 status in 1988.

The St James&#x27;s Palace Stakes usually features horses which ran previously in the 2,000 Guineas, the Poule d&#x27;Essai des Poulains or the Irish 2,000 Guineas. It is contested on the opening day of the Royal Ascot meeting.

<text>The Queen Anne Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged four years or older. It is run at Ascot over a distance of 1 mile (1,609 metres), and is scheduled to take place each year in June.

==History==
The event was established in 1840, and during the early part of its history it was called the Trial Stakes. It was originally open to horses aged three or older. In 1930, it was renamed in honour of Queen Anne, the founder of Ascot Racecourse.

The Queen Anne Stakes was classed as a Group 3 race in 1971, and it was promoted to Group 2 level in 1984. It was given Group 1 status in 2003, and at this point the minimum age of participating horses was raised to four.

It is now the first race on the opening day of the Royal Ascot meeting.

<text>Yāqūt Shihāb al-Dīn ibn-ʿAbdullāh al-Rūmī al-Ḥamawī (1179–1229) () was a Muslim scholar of Byzantine ancestry active during the late Abbasid period (12th–13th centuries). He is known for his , an influential work on geography containing valuable information pertaining to biography, history and literature as well as geography.

==Life==
&quot;Yāqūt&quot; (&quot;ruby&quot; or &quot;hyacinth&quot;) was the &quot;kunya&quot; of Ibn Abdullāh (&quot;son of Abdullāh&quot;). He was born in Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, called in Arabic al-Rūm, whence his &quot;nisba&quot; &quot;al-Rūmi&quot;. Captured in war and enslaved, Yāqūt became &quot;mawali&quot; to ‘Askar ibn Abī Naṣr al-Ḥamawī, a trader of Baghdad, Iraq, the seat of the Abbasid Caliphate, from whom he received the &quot;laqab&quot; &quot;al-Hamawī&quot;. As ‘Askar&#x27;s apprentice, he learned about accounting and commerce, becoming his envoy on trade missions and travelling twice or three times to Kish in the Persian Gulf. In 1194, ‘Askar stopped his salary over some dispute and Yāqūt found work as copyist to support himself. He embarked on a course of study under the grammarian Al-‘Ukbarî. Five years later he was on another mission to Kish for ‘Askar. On his return to Baghdad he set up as a bookseller and began his writing career.

Yāqūt spent ten years travelling in Iran, Syria, and Egypt and his significance as a scholar lies in his testimony of the great, and largely lost, literary heritage found in libraries east of the Caspian Sea, being one of the last visitors before their destruction by Mongol invaders. He gained much material from the libraries of the ancient cities of Merv where he had studied for two yearsand of Balkh. Circa 1222, he was working on his &quot;Geography&quot; in Mosul and completed the first draft in 1224. In 1227 he was in Alexandria. From there he moved to Aleppo, where he died in 1229.

<text>The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged four years or older. It is run at Ascot over a distance of 1 mile 1 furlong and 212 yards (2,004 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in June.

==History==
The event was established in 1862, and it was named after the Prince of Wales at that time, the future King Edward VII. The original version was restricted to three-year-olds, and it was contested over 1 mile and 5 furlongs.

The race was discontinued after World War II, when there was no Prince of Wales. It returned in 1968, a year before the investiture of Prince Charles. The distance of the new version was 1 mile and 2 furlongs, and it was now open to horses aged three or older.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and for a period the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Stakes was classed at Group 2 level. It was promoted to Group 1 status in 2000, and at this point the minimum age of participating horses was raised to four.

The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Stakes is currently held on the second day of the five-day Royal Ascot meeting.

<text>Yaropolk Rostislavich (11XX - 1182?) was a grand prince of Vladimir between 1174 and 1175. He was a nephew of Andrey Bogolyubsky. In 1173, Andrey seized Kiev (Kyiv) from Roman I of Kiev and gave it to his brother Mikhalko Yuriyevich, who in turn gave it to his brother Vsevolod the Big Nest and Yaropolk Rostislavich. However on March 24, 1173, Roman&#x27;s brothers retaliated against Vsevolod and Yaropolk, taking them captive and giving Kiev to Rurik Rostislavich.

<text>Gaius Antonius (82 – 42 BC) was the second son of Marcus Antonius Creticus and Julia, and thus, younger brother of the Triumvir Mark Antony.

==Life==
===Early life===
Like both of his brothers, Gaius started his life free from paternal guidance, in the midst of scandals, parties and gambling.

===Civil war===
During Caesar&#x27;s civil war, Gaius was a legate of Julius Caesar in 49 BC and was entrusted with the defense of Illyria against Pompeians and with the campaign to regain cities already taken by rebels and the Pompeians. Gaius was entrusted with the newly recruited 24th legion and half of the new 28th legion. On the way to Illyria, Antonius was intercepted by a Pompeian fleet. Led by centurion Titus Pullo, the men refused to fight, and turned traitors. They were then reported to be fighting at the Battle of Dyrrachium.

===Caesar&#x27;s dictatorship===
With all the members of the Antonius family, he was then promoted to high offices of the &quot;cursus honorum&quot;. In 44 BC, Gaius was an urban praetor, while his brothers Mark Antony and Lucius Antonius were consul and tribune, respectively.

===Caesar&#x27;s assassination and afterward===
After the assassination of Caesar, Gaius (as a Caesarean) was appointed governor of the Roman province of Macedonia. Marcus Junius Brutus and the other assassins, however, chose Macedonia as refuge from Octavian and - following opposition from Gaius - dispossessed him of his governorship. Brutus at first seemed to treat him generously but, on finding that he was attempting to persuade his troops to mutiny and with the recent murder of Cicero ordered by his brother, Brutus ultimately ordered his death.

<text>Mary Ann Yates (1728–1787) was an English tragic actress. The daughter of William Graham, a ship&#x27;s steward and his wife, Mary, she married Richard Yates (c. 1706-1796), a well-known comedian of the time.

In 1754, aged 25, she appeared at Drury Lane as Marcia in Samuel Crisp&#x27;s &quot;Virginia&quot;. David Garrick played the part of Virginius. Yates was gradually entrusted with all the leading parts and succeeded the then famous actress Mrs Cibber as the leading tragedienne of the English stage. She was in turn succeeded and eclipsed by the famous Sarah Siddons.

There were benefit performances for Yates in 1797 at The Haymarket which included an appearance by Harriett Litchfield.

<text>Julia (104 – after 39 BC) was the mother of the triumvir general Mark Antony.

==Biography==
===Early life===
She was the daughter of Lucius Julius Caesar (the consul of 90 BC) and Fulvia. She and her brother Lucius Julius Caesar (who was consul in 64 BC) were born and raised in Rome. 

Julia was a third-cousin of Julius Caesar (their great-grandparents Gaius and Sextus Julius Caesar were siblings).

===Marriages===
Julia married Marcus Antonius Creticus, a man of a senatorial family. Their sons were the triumvir Mark Antony, Gaius Antonius and Lucius Antonius. Because of their kinship through her, Gaius Julius Caesar was obliged to promote the political careers of her sons, despite his distaste for their father and his generally low opinion of their abilities. After Julia&#x27;s first husband died in 74 BC, she married Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura, a politician who in 63 BC was involved in the Catilinarian conspiracy and was executed on the orders of Cicero.

Julia had raised her sons through her marriages. Plutarch describes her as one of the &quot;most nobly born and admirable women of her time&quot;. The following clause from Plutarch describes her relationship with her first husband:

===Later life===
Elsewhere Plutarch illustrates her character with an episode from the proscription of 43 BC, during the Second Triumvirate:

During the Perusine War (modern Perugia) between 41 BC-40 BC, Julia left Rome, although Octavian (future Roman Emperor Augustus) treated her with kindness. She never trusted Sextus Pompeius. When Sextus Pompeius was in Sicily, Julia had sent to Greece for Antony, a distinguished escort and convoy of triremes. After the reconciliation of the triumvirs, Julia returned with Antony to Italy in 39 BC and was probably present at the meeting with Sextus Pompeius at Misenum.

<doc id="727533" wikidata="Q2742441" url="?curid=727533" title="Ascot Gold Cup">
<text>|}





















The Gold Cup is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged four years or older. It is run at Ascot over a distance of 2 miles 3 furlongs and 210 yards (4,014 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in June.
It is Britain&#x27;s most prestigious event for &quot;stayers&quot; – horses which specialise in racing over long distances. It is traditionally held on the third day of the Royal Ascot meeting, which is known colloquially (but not officially) as Ladies&#x27; Day. Contrary to popular belief, the actual title of the race does not include the word &quot;Ascot&quot;.

==History==
The event was established in 1807, and it was originally open to horses aged three or older. The inaugural winner, Master Jackey, was awarded prize money of 100 guineas. The first race took place in the presence of King George III and Queen Charlotte.

The 1844 running was attended by Nicholas I of Russia, who was making a state visit to England. That year&#x27;s winner was unnamed at the time of his victory, but he was given the name &quot;The Emperor&quot; in honour of the visiting monarch. In return Nicholas offered a new trophy for the race — the &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Plate&quot; — and this became the title of the event for a short period. Its original name was restored after nine years, during the Crimean War.

It was taken by thieves on 18 June 1907. The theft was never solved, but a replacement was finished by August. Mark Twain, the American humorist, came to London about that time, and was much amused by the twin headlines appearing in &quot;The Times&quot;:

ASCOT GOLD CUP STOLEN

The Gold Cup is the first leg of Britain&#x27;s &quot;Stayers&#x27; Triple Crown&quot;, followed by the Goodwood Cup and the Doncaster Cup. The last horse to win all three races in the same year was Stradivarius in 2019.

The Gold Cup is one of three perpetual trophies at the Royal Ascot meeting, along with the Royal Hunt Cup and the Queen&#x27;s Vase, which can be kept permanently by the winning owners. A number of horses have won it more than once, and the most successful is Yeats, who recorded his fourth victory in 2009.

<doc id="727536" wikidata="Q6701051" url="?curid=727536" title="Luis Rivas">
<text>Luis Wilfredo Rivas (born August 30, 1979) is a former Major League Baseball infielder. He played for the Minnesota Twins from 2000 to 2005, Cleveland Indians in 2007, and Pittsburgh Pirates in 2008. He batted and throws right-handed.

Rivas was known to be a free-swinging hitter who will offer at almost any pitch often putting it in play. As a runner, he has good speed and is aggressive on the basepaths. Defensively, Rivas had soft hands, a great arm and good range. He turned the double play well, and was also competent ranging back on pop-ups.

From 2000 to 2004, Rivas posted a .262 batting average with 29 home runs and 165 RBI in 506 games. After the 2005 All-Star break, Minnesota optioned Rivas to Triple-A Rochester. Once thought of as the Twins&#x27; second baseman of the future, Rivas never developed into the type of consistent hitter needed. He was recalled, and then again sent back down on October 4 after the season had ended.

In 2006, Rivas played for the Durham Bulls of the International League. He hit a disappointing .218 with an OPS of .540. He signed a Minor League contract with the Cleveland Indians for the 2007 season. He hit .263 for the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons in 105 games. He earned a big league call-up on September 1, when rosters expand. In December 2007, Rivas signed a minor league contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates.

In January 2009, Rivas signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs.

<doc id="727539" wikidata="Q2997630" url="?curid=727539" title="Coronation Stakes">
<text>The Coronation Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to three-year-old fillies. It is run at Ascot over a distance of 7 furlong and 213 yards (1,603 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in June.

==History==
The event was established in 1840, and its title commemorates the coronation of a new British monarch, Queen Victoria, two years earlier.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and for a period the Coronation Stakes held Group 2 status. It was promoted to Group 1 level in 1988.

The Coronation Stakes is now contested on the fourth day of the five-day Royal Ascot meeting. It usually features fillies which ran previously in the 1,000 Guineas, the Poule d&#x27;Essai des Pouliches or the Irish 1,000 Guineas. The most recent filly to follow up a win in one of those races with victory in the Coronation Stakes was Tahiyra, the 2023 Irish 1,000 Guineas winner.

<text>Thomas Austin Yawkey (born Thomas Yawkey Austin; February 21, 1903 – July 9, 1976) was an American industrialist and Major League Baseball executive. Born in Detroit, Yawkey became president of the Boston Red Sox in 1933 and was the sole owner of the team for 44 seasons until he died of leukemia. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1980.

==Early life==

Yawkey was born in Detroit on February 21, 1903, to insurance executive Thomas J. Austin and his wife Augusta. Augusta was the eldest child of William Clyman Yawkey, who had become wealthy in the lumber and iron ore industries of the Midwestern United States. In addition to these interests, William Clyman Yawkey had agreed to buy the Detroit Tigers baseball team in 1903, but died before the deal closed. His son, William H. &quot;Bill&quot; Yawkey, completed the purchase with Frank Navin in late 1903.

When Yawkey was about six months old, his father died. After his father&#x27;s death, Yawkey and his mother moved to New York City to live with his uncle, William Yawkey. Throughout his life, Yawkey maintained a residence in New York City. In September 1918, William adopted 15-year-old Tom after his mother died. His last name was changed to Yawkey after the adoption.

Bill Yawkey died in 1919 and left half of his $40 million (roughly $644 million in 2022) estate to Tom. A clause in the will created two trusts that he gained access to at 25 and 30 years old. Yawkey graduated from the Irving School in Tarrytown, NY in 1920 and from the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University in 1925. While at Yale, Yawkey was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.

==Boston Red Sox==
Having met as alumni of the Irving School, Yawkey and Eddie Collins, a former Philadelphia Athletics second baseman, discussed purchasing a baseball team in 1933, when Yawkey was due to turn 30 and gain full access to his fortune. Collins found a potential target in the Boston Red Sox, who had spent the last fourteen years as one of the worst teams in baseball. Former owner Harry Frazee had been forced to sell most of his best players to the New York Yankees due to chronic cash shorts. His successor, Bob Quinn, had been grossly underfinanced since the illness and death of a major investor. By the 1932–33 offseason, Quinn was so strapped that he had to borrow against his life insurance to send the team to spring training.

Collins arranged a meeting between Quinn and Yawkey during the 1932 World Series; he later agreed to come to the Red Sox if Yawkey purchased the team. On February 25, 1933, Yawkey bought the Red Sox for $1.25 million, five days after Yawkey turned 30. He became team president, giving Collins control of day-to-day operations as vice president and general manager (posts Collins held until 1947).

Yawkey inherited a team that had finished the 1932 season with a record of , the worst in franchise history. Yawkey and Collins attempted to build a successful team by acquiring talented players. He also spent $1.5 million on repairs to Fenway Park, giving it much of its present look.

In 1934, the Red Sox reached a winning percentage of .500 for the first time since winning the 1918 World Series. In 1937, they achieved a first winning record for the first time since 1918, and in 1938 they finished in the first division for the first time since 1918. When it became apparent that buying top level major league players wasn&#x27;t enough to surpass the Yankees and Detroit Tigers, Yawkey began building a minor-league system as well.

Under Yawkey, the Jimmy Fund became the official charity of the team in 1953. In 1957, Yawkey was elected chairman of the Jimmy Fund&#x27;s board of trustees and helped establish the tradition of the Red Sox playing exhibition games to raise money for the fund.

Yawkey spent millions in his effort to build winning teams. In the first seven years of his ownership, the Red Sox lost $1.7 million, more than he had paid to buy the team. Yawkey spent around an additional $3 million during that time on buying players, renovating Fenway Park, and other capital expenses. In 1974, Yawkey estimated his ownership of the team had cost him over $10 million. The Red Sox won the American League pennant in 1946 (their first pennant since 1918), 1967, and 1975, but then went on to lose each World Series in seven games, against the St. Louis Cardinals (1946, 1967) and the Cincinnati Reds (1975). Yawkey never achieved his goal of winning a world championship.

According to two anonymous sources in an article by Jeff Passan in 2011, Yawkey kept Donald Fitzpatrick, an equipment manager for the Red Sox, employed despite private allegations of sexual assault against Fitzpatrick. However, no public allegations against Fitzpatrick were made until 1991, 15 years after Yawkey&#x27;s death.

===Racism and racial integration of the Red Sox===
The Red Sox were the first MLB team to sign a Mexican-born player, fielding Mel Almada on September 8, 1933. However, they were the last major league team to add a black player to their roster, allegedly due to Yawkey and the managers he hired being racists.

According to the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, as owner of the Boston Red Sox, the team&#x27;s integration policy was Yawkey&#x27;s responsibility. In 1945, Red Sox held a farce tryout chiefly designed to assuage the desegregationist sensibilities of powerful Boston City Councilman Isadore H. Y. Muchnick. Jackie Robinson, who would later play for the Brooklyn Dodgers, was subjected to racial epithets by management and left the tryout humiliated.

Attempts to integrate between 1945 and 1959 were unsuccessful. Joe Cronin, general manager after Eddie Collins, scouted black players, including Sam Jethroe, Larry Doby and Bill Greason but none signed with the team. In 1950, the team signed Lorenzo Piper Davis, their first black player, for their minor league team, but he was released in May of that year. Three years later, the team signed Earl Wilson to their minor league team, but his career was interrupted by serving in the Marines in 1957. Wilson would later return to the Sox&#x27;s Minneapolis farm team after completing his military service and be fielded by the Sox in July 1959.

In 1956, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; published an article discussing the Red Sox&#x27;s lack of black players on the team, in which manager Joe Cronin denied prejudice allegations. The article reported that the Red Sox had made an offer of $115,000 for Charlie Neal in 1954, but the offer was rejected.

Despite the Red Sox having multiple black players in their farm system during the 1950s, the team did not promote any of them to the major league until 1959. On July 21, 1959, Pumpsie Green, who was signed by the team in 1955, made his debut, making the Red Sox the final major league team to integrate its roster.

In 1967, the Red Sox fielded a team with a starting lineup including multiple black players, such as George Scott and Reggie Smith. However, the Red Sox did not sign any Black free agents between the 1972 start of the free agency system and 1993, thereby missing out on a substantial portion of top baseball talent during that twenty-one year period.

==Death and legacy==

Yawkey died from leukemia in Boston on July 9, 1976. His wife, Jean R. Yawkey, became president of the club following his death. Yawkey was posthumously inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1980.

=== The Yawkey Foundation ===
The Yawkey Foundation was established in 1976 through a bequest in his will. Yawkey set aside $10 million in his will, which was probated in New York, to establish the foundation. In 1982, Jean Yawkey created a second Yawkey Foundation.

In 2002, the original Foundation donated $25 million to Massachusetts General Hospital to build an outpatient center, and recorded $420 million in 2002 income after the sale of the Red Sox.

In 2003, the Foundation donated $15 million to Boston Medical Center, a safety net hospital, to build the Moakley Cancer Care Building.

In 2005, the Foundation created the Yawkey Scholars Program to award college scholarships to students with demonstrated financial need.

In 2007, the Yawkey Foundations donated $30 million for the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute to build the Yawkey Center for Cancer Care in Boston.

In 2008, the original Foundation supported the building of a new home, Jean Yawkey Place, for the Boston Health Care for the Homeless program.

In 2013, the Foundation awarded $10 million to the Museum of Science for a gallery and $3 million to Cape Cod Healthcare for an emergency center.

In 2014, The Foundation gave a $10 million donation to Boston University to support a paid internship program for students to work at nonprofits.

In 2018, the Foundation donated $10 million to Tidelands Georgetown Memorial Hospital to expand the facility. Yawkey donated $100,000 to build the original hospital in 1945.

In June 2021, the Foundation donated $5 million to Franciscan Children&#x27;s new mental health center.

=== Yawkey Way ===
In 1977, the section of Jersey Street where Fenway Park is located was renamed Yawkey Way in his honor. However, in August 2017, due to Yawkey&#x27;s alleged history of racism and discrimination against Black players, the Red Sox principal owner John W. Henry announced the team was seeking to change the name of the street. The following year, Henry publicly distanced the team from Yawkey, citing that he was &quot;haunted by what went on here a long time before we arrived,&quot; referring to the team being the last in the major leagues to integrate under Tom Yawkey&#x27;s guidance.

The change was unanimously approved by the Boston Public Improvement Commission in April 2018, and the name reverted to Jersey Street in May 2018. Also in May, a plaque commemorating Yawkey from &quot;his Red Sox employees,&quot; that had hung at the administrative office entrance to Fenway Park since shortly after his death was removed. In April 2019, the MBTA Commuter Rail station near the park, Yawkey station, was renamed Lansdowne station.

=== Tom Yawkey Wildlife Center Heritage Preserve ===
Through his will, Yawkey donated three coastal islands in Georgetown, South Carolina, to the state to create a wildlife preserve. The preserve covers more than of land and consists of North Island, South Island and a majority of Cat Island. It is managed by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources.

In 1919, when Yawkey was 16, he inherited part of the land from his Uncle William, who originally purchased the land as part of the South Island Gun Club. Prior to the gun club owning the land, it was the site of multiple plantations.

==Personal life==
Yawkey married Elise Sparrow in 1925, and the couple adopted a daughter named Julia in July 1936. The couple divorced in November 1944. Yawkey married Jean R. Hiller on Christmas Eve 1944. Tom and Jean Yawkey had no children. Yawkey&#x27;s only sibling, his sister Emma, died in December 1963.

In 2018, a biography of Yawkey entitled &quot;Tom Yawkey: Patriarch of the Boston Red Sox&quot; by Bill Nowlin was published by the University of Nebraska Press.

<text>The Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged four years or older. Three-year-olds foaled in the Southern Hemisphere are also eligible. It is run at Ascot over a distance of 6 furlongs (1,207 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in June.

==History==
The event was established in 1868, and it was originally called the All-Aged Stakes. It was renamed the Cork and Orrery Stakes in 1926, in honour of the 9th Earl of Cork, who served as the Master of the Buckhounds in the 19th century.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the Cork and Orrery Stakes was initially classed at Group 3 level. It was promoted to Group 2 status in 1998.

The race was renamed to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 2002. From this point it held Group 1 status. In 2012 the race was named the Diamond Jubilee Stakes, to commemorate the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee and in 2022 it was again renamed to the Platinum Jubilee Stakes, to commemorate the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee. In 2023 the race was given its present title, to honour the memory of the Queen and retain the connection with the three jubilees celebrated since 2002.

The Platinum Jubilee Stakes became part of a new international race series, the Global Sprint Challenge, in 2005.

The race is now contested on the final day of the five-day Royal Ascot meeting. Prior to 2015 the race was also open to three-year-olds. It was restricted to four-year-olds and up when a new six furlong Group One race, the Commonwealth Cup, was created at the meeting for three-year-olds only in 2015.

<doc id="727550" wikidata="Q48041" url="?curid=727550" title="Dmitry Yazov">
<text>Dmitry Timofeyevich Yazov (; 8 November 1924 – 25 February 2020) was a Marshal of the Soviet Union. A veteran of the Great Patriotic War, Yazov served as Minister of Defence from 1987 until he was arrested for his part in the 1991 August coup, four months before the fall of the Soviet Union. Yazov was the last person to be appointed to the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union on 28 April 1990, the only Marshal born in Siberia, and at the time of his death on 25 February 2020, he was the last living Marshal of the Soviet Union.

==Early life==
Yazov was born in the village of Yazovo (called Lyebyezhye at the time of his birth), Krestinsky volost, Kalachinsky district, Omsk province. He was the son of Timofey Yakovlevich Yazov (died in 1933) and Maria Fedoseevna Yazova, who were peasants. The family had four children.

==Career==
===World War II===

Yazov joined the Red Army voluntarily in November 1941 at the age of seventeen, not having time to finish high school. Upon joining the army, he claimed to be born in 1923, a year earlier than his actual birth. He was enrolled in training at the Moscow Higher Military Command School (Evacuated due to the Battle of Moscow to Novosibirsk from 2 November 1941 to 28 January 1942) and graduated in June 1942. He received a school graduation certificate only in 1953, already being a major.

From August 1942, he fought on the Volkhov and Leningrad fronts as commander of a rifle platoon, a commander of a rifle company, and platoon commander of front-line courses of junior lieutenants of the 483rd Rifle Regiment of the 177th Rifle Division of the Leningrad Front. He participated in the battles of the Siege of Leningrad, in the offensive operations of Soviet troops in the Baltic states, and in the blockade of the Courland Pocket. In 1944, he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

===Post–war military career===
In 1962, Yazov commanded Soviet ground forces in Oriente Province, Cuba, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, where he personally worked with Cuban Defence Minister Raúl Castro. The unit, which was headquartered at Holguín Air Base, was ordered to attack Guantanamo Bay Naval Base with KS-1 Komet nuclear cruise missiles if war with the United States started.

In 1971–1973, he commanded the 32nd Army Corps in the Crimean region of the Odessa Military District. In 1979–1980, Yazov was commander of the Central Group of Forces in Czechoslovakia. He was commanding the Far East Military District in the northern summer of 1986, when, according to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, he made a favourable impression on General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, which led to later promotions. He was appointed Soviet Defence Minister on 30 May 1987, after Marshal Sergei Sokolov was sacked as a result of the Mathias Rust incident two days earlier. From June 1987 to July 1990, Yazov was a candidate member of the Politburo. He was a key part of Black January. Yazov was responsible for deployment of Soviet OMON commando units to Latvia and Lithuania in early 1991. During the August Coup of 1991, Yazov was a member of the State Emergency Committee. For supporting the GKChP, the government of Valentin Pavlov was dismissed and, accordingly, Yazov lost the post of Minister of Defence. During the Yeltsin period, Yazov was prosecuted and acquitted in 1994.

On the morning of 22 August, before the first interrogation, Yazov turned to Gorbachev with a video recorded message in which he read a letter and called himself an &quot;old fool&quot;, regretted participating in this &quot;adventure&quot; and asked for forgiveness from the President of the USSR. 20 years after these events, the former defence minister said that he did not remember what he said, because he did not sleep for a day. And he named the journalist Vladimir Molchanov the initiator of this letter and video. In his memoirs, Yazov clarified that he was persuaded to turn to Gorbachev with a penitential speech to protect him from the criminal article &quot;Treason to the Motherland&quot;, and under the influence of fatigue he succumbed to the persuasion of television reporters.

Yazov was released on recognisance not to leave in January 1993. He was amnestied by the State Duma in 1994, accepting the amnesty offered by Boris Yeltsin and stating that he was not guilty. He was dismissed from the military service by Presidential Order and awarded a ceremonial weapon. He was awarded an order of Honour by the President of Russian Federation. Yazov later worked as a military adviser at the General Staff Academy.

Despite his selection by Gorbachev for the Defence Minister&#x27;s position, William Odom, in his book &quot;The Collapse of the Soviet Military&quot;, repeats Alexander Yakovlev&#x27;s description of Yazov as a &quot;mediocre officer&quot;, &quot;fit to command a division but nothing higher&quot;. Odom suggests Gorbachev was only looking for &quot;careerists who would follow orders, any orders&quot;.

In March 2019, Yazov was tried &quot;in absentia&quot; and convicted of war crimes by a Lithuanian court for his role in the military crackdown in Lithuania in January 1991, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Russia denounced the trial as politically motivated and refused to extradite Yazov.

==Death==

Yazov died in Moscow on 25 February 2020 at the age of 95, following what the Defence Ministry of Russia called &quot;a serious and prolonged illness&quot;. He is buried at the Federal Military Memorial Cemetery outside Moscow.

<text>|}

























The Eclipse Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run at Sandown Park over a distance of 1 mile, 1 furlong and 209 yards (2,002 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in early July.

==History==

The event is named after Eclipse, a celebrated 18th-century racehorse. It was established in 1886, and the inaugural running was won by Bendigo. At that time, it was Britain&#x27;s richest ever race. The prize fund of £10,000 was donated by Leopold de Rothschild at the request of General Owen Williams, a co-founder of Sandown Park.

The Eclipse Stakes was contested by high-quality fields from its inception. It was won by Ayrshire, the previous year&#x27;s Derby winner, in 1889. The first three finishers in 1903– Ard Patrick, Sceptre and Rock Sand — had won seven Classics between them.

The race has been sponsored by Coral since 1976, and it is now familiarly known as the &quot;Coral-Eclipse&quot;. The most recent Classic winner to achieve victory was City of Troy, the Epsom Derby winner, in 2024.

<doc id="727561" wikidata="Q5546596" url="?curid=727561" title="George Yeardley">
<text>Sir George Yeardley () was a planter and colonial governor of the colony of Virginia. He was also among the first slaveowners in Colonial America. A survivor of the Virginia Company of London&#x27;s ill-fated 1609 Third Supply Mission, whose flagship, the &quot;Sea Venture&quot;, was shipwrecked on Bermuda for ten months, he is best remembered for presiding over the initial session of the first representative legislative body in Virginia in 1619. With representatives from throughout the settled portion of the colony the group became known as the House of Burgesses and continued to meet, becoming the Virginia General Assembly.

==Early life==
Yeardley was baptized on July 28, 1588, in St. Saviour&#x27;s Parish, Southwark, Surrey. He was the son of Ralph Yeardley (1549–1604), a London merchant-tailor, and Rhoda Marston (died 1603). He chose not to follow his father into trade, but instead became a soldier and joined a company of English foot-soldiers to fight the Spanish in the Netherlands. As Captain of the Guard (bodyguard), he was selected to serve Sir Thomas Gates during his term as Governor of Virginia.

==Shipwreck==

Yeardley set sail from England on June 1, 1609, with the newly appointed Sir Thomas Gates aboard the &quot;Sea Venture&quot;, the flagship of the ill-fated Third Supply expedition to Jamestown. After eight weeks at sea, and seven days from expected landfall, the convoy ran into a tropical storm and the &quot;Sea Venture&quot; was shipwrecked in the Bermuda island chain. Fortunately, everyone survived. The castaways thrived on the uninhabited island. Despite numerous problems (including civil unrest among the former passengers resulting in Gates declaring martial law) two small ships were built within 10 months. The two ships, the 70–80 ton &quot;Deliverance&quot; and the 30 ton pinnace &quot;Patience&quot;, arrived at Jamestown on May 23, 1610.

==Jamestown (1610-1615)==

The shipwreck survivors found the colonists of Jamestown in desperate condition. Most of the settlers had died from sickness or starvation or had been killed by Indians. Sir Thomas Gates agreed with the Jamestown settlers to abandon the colony and return to England. He ordered Captain Yeardley to command his soldiers to guard the town preventing settlers from setting fire to the structures that were evacuated. Lord de la Warr soon arrived bringing supplies to save the struggling colony. Captain Yeardley was co-commander of the early Forts Henry and Charles at Kecoughtan--present-day Hampton, Virginia. In October 1610, Lord De La Warr ordered Captain Yeardley and Captain Edward Brewster to lead 150 men into the mountains in search of silver and gold mines.

==Political career in the New World==
In 1616 Yeardley was designated Deputy-Governor of Virginia. One of his first accomplishments was to come to an agreement with the Chickahominy Indians that secured food and peace for two years. He served from 1616 to 1617.

In November 18th, 1618, The Virginia Company of London issued its &quot;Instructions to George Yeardley,&quot; which included the commissioning of a general assembly and the ancient planter/headright system. Part of the purpose was to encourage settlers to come to Virginia, which included building a college. These instructions come to be known as &quot;the Great Charter&quot;.

On November 24th, Sir George was appointed to serve three years as governor of Virginia, and was knighted by James I during an audience at Newmarket. Before sailing to Virginia with the Great Charter, a great comet appeared over England. It was considered a bad omen for the English, but (apocryphally) a herald of American freedom.

A relation from the Flowerdew family, John Pory, served as secretary to the colony from 1618 to 1622. And when Flowerdew Hundred sent representatives to the first General Assembly in Jamestown in 1619, one was Ensign Edmund Rossingham, a son of Temperance Flowerdew&#x27;s elder sister Mary Flowerdew.

Yeardley led the first representative Virginia General Assembly, the legislative House of Burgesses, to meet on American soil. It convened at the church in Jamestown on July 30, 1619. One of the first acts of this representative body was to set the price of tobacco. 

Yeardley was governor of Virginia when, in August 1619, the &quot;White Lion&quot; landed &quot;20. and odd&quot; Angolans kidnapped in Africa and exchanged them for provisions, thus introducing the trade in enslaved Africans into the English colonies on the North American mainland.

Yeardley was appointed deputy-governor again in 1625. On September 11, 1626, Yeardley presided over the witchcraft inquiry of Joan Wright, the first legal witchcraft inquiry on record against an English settler in any British North American colony.

He served a second time as governor from March 4, 1626/27 until his death on November 13, 1627.

===Land ownership===

In 1619, he patented of land on Mulberry Island. He owned another private plantation upriver on the south side of the James River opposite Tanks Weyanoke, named Flowerdew Hundred, and owned several enslaved persons. It is often assumed that Yeardley named this plantation &quot;Flowerdew Hundred&quot; after his wife, as a kind of romantic tribute. However, the land appears to have been in use by Stanley Flowerdew, Yeardley&#x27;s brother-in-law, before it was patented by Yeardley. Although George Yeardley acquired the thousand acres that he named Flowerdew Hundred in 1619, it seems very likely that some settlement had begun there before that date, for his brother-in-law Stanley Flowerdew took a shipment of tobacco to England in the same year, probably grown on the same property. With a population of about thirty, Flowerdew Hundred Plantation was economically successful with thousands of pounds of tobacco produced along with corn, fish and livestock. In 1621 Yeardley paid 120 pounds (possibly a hogshead of tobacco) to build the first windmill in British America. The windmill was an English post design and was transferred by deed in the property&#x27;s 1624 sale to Abraham Piersey, a Cape Merchant of the London Company. The plantation survived the 1622 onslaught of Powhatan Indians, losing only six people. so the plantation may have been associated with the Flowerdew name before Yeardley&#x27;s patent. Note that Yeardley named his Mulberry Island plantation &quot;Stanley Hundred&quot;, undoubtedly after his Stanley in-laws. In other words, both of Yeardley&#x27;s plantations were named in honor of his wealthy in-laws. Clearly, the Yeardley-Flowerdew alliance was as much to do with power politics and social status as with romance.

==Family==

On 18 October 1618, George Yeardley (sometimes written as &quot;Yardley&quot; or &quot;Yearlley&quot;
) married Temperance Flowerdew, daughter of Anthony Flowerdew of Hethersett, Norfolk, and wife Martha Stanley of Scottow, Norfolk. A month later he was appointed to serve three years as governor of Virginia, and was knighted by James I during an audience at Newmarket on 24 November. This is the date commonly ascribed to the wedding; however, their children were born prior to 1618. While out-of-wedlock children occurred in early Jamestown, it would have been unthinkable for a woman of Temperance Flowerdew&#x27;s station. It is likely that they got married between 1610 and 1615. Temperance Flowerdew had also sailed for Virginia in the 1609 expedition, aboard the &quot;Faulcon&quot;, arriving at Jamestown in August 1609. She was one of the few survivors of the Starving Time.

The couple had three children: Elizabeth Yeardley was listed as age 6 in the February 1624 Jamestown Muster, so was born about 1618, James City, Virginia, Died: ~1660-1666, Bruton Parish, York County, Virginia, Inherited 1/3 of Mother&#x27;s Estate: Flowerdew Hundred Plantation; Some claim she married Major Joseph Croshaw. However, there has been no source ever found or produced to prove this conjecture. His record here does not include her as one of his several wives. Argoll Yeardley - Was listed as age 4 in the February 1624 Jamestown Muster, so was born about 1620. 
Francis Yeardley - Was listed as age 1 in the February 1624 Jamestown Muster, so was born about 1623.

==Death and legacy==
Yeardley died on November 13, 1627. He is buried in Third Jamestown Church at Jamestown, Virginia. His widow, Temperance Flowerdew married Governor Francis West. Their son, Argoll Yeardley would represent Lower Norfolk county in the House of Burgesses in 1653, shortly before his death. Argoll Yeardly had married Ann Custis, who brought her brothers John Custis II and William Custis to the colony, where they became planters, served in the House of Burgesses, and founded the Custis family of Virginia.

===In pop culture===
Jason Flemyng plays Sir George Yeardley in a British television show, &quot;Jamestown&quot;.

===Archaeological===

On July 24, 2018, archaeologists from Jamestown Rediscovery and the Smithsonian Institution announced the discovery of a prominent burial around 400 years ago in an important spot within the church. Ground-penetrating radar confirmed the presence of a skeleton of the right age and build for Yeardley who died in 1627, aged about 40. The gender, age estimate, the way the body was laid out and its prominent location within the church, support its identity as Yeardley. Another church was built on top but the position indicates a high status burial. Although the head is missing, 10 teeth have been found and tests are being carried out by the FBI and archaeologist and geneticist Turi King, who helped identify the remains of Richard III in 2012. King will assist in tracking down Yeardley relatives to compare DNA found in the remains. The results could take several months but should be available in time for 2019&#x27;s 400th Anniversary of Sir George Yeardley&#x27;s Great Reforms and the first General Assembly which introduced them.

<doc id="727562" wikidata="Q3064809" url="?curid=727562" title="Falmouth Stakes">
<text>The Falmouth Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to fillies and mares aged three years or older. It is run on the July Course at Newmarket over a distance of 1 mile (1,609 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in July.

==History==
The event is named in honour of Evelyn Boscawen, 6th Viscount Falmouth, who was a leading racehorse owner and breeder in the 19th century. It was established in 1911, and it was originally restricted to three-year-old fillies.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the Falmouth Stakes was initially classed at Group 3 level. It was opened to older fillies and mares in 1974. It became known as the Child Stakes in 1975, when Child&#x27;s Bank began a period of sponsorship. It was promoted to Group 2 level in 1987, and it reverted to its original name in 1992. It was raised to Group 1 status in 2004.

The Falmouth Stakes is currently held on the second day of Newmarket&#x27;s three-day July Festival meeting.

<doc id="727563" wikidata="Q2090994" url="?curid=727563" title="Terenure">
<text>Terenure (), originally called &quot;Roundtown&quot;, is a middle class suburb of Dublin in Ireland. It is located in the city&#x27;s D6 and D6W postal districts. The population of all electoral divisions labelled as Terenure was 17,972 as of the 2022 census.

==Location and transport==
Terenure lies primarily in the administrative area of Dublin City Council but with parts falling in South Dublin. It is located south of Harold&#x27;s Cross and north of Rathfarnham, and also borders the suburbs of Templeogue, Rathgar, Kimmage and Perrystown.

&quot;Terenure Cross&quot; (Vaughan&#x27;s Corner) was at one time a terminus for the Dublin tramways, and is mentioned in James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; (Episode 7, &#x27;Aeolus&#x27;). There were three tram depots in Terenure at one time, the main tram depot for the number 15 Dublin United Transport Company (DUTC) trams on Terenure Road East, another DUTC depot for number 16 trams on Rathfarnham Road, and the terminus of the Dublin and Blessington Steam Tramway on Templeogue Road. The modern tram system — the Luas — does not serve Terenure, but the bus routes serving it still include routes numbered 15, 15a and 16. These bus route numbers were originally allocated based on historic tram route numbers.
==History==

Terenure, Drimnagh and Kimmage, then well to the south of the city of Dublin, were granted to the Barnewell family by King John in 1215. The Barnewells gave some of the land to St John The Baptist Hospital outside Newgate, and Cromwell confiscated the remainder from them. Following this Terenure passed through the hands of various owners, including what is now Terenure College (bought by the Carmelites in 1860). In the seventeenth century, the main landowners were the Deane family, whose most notable member was Joseph Deane, Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer; his estates later passed to the Bourne family. Fortfield House was built around 1785 by a later Chief Baron, Barry Yelverton, 1st Viscount Avonmore. It was later owned by John Hatchell, the Attorney General for Ireland and passed by inheritance to the Perrin family. It was demolished in 1934.

The earliest reference to these areas can be found in a grant (ref &quot;Grant CCA-DCc-ChAnt/C/1206&quot;) stored in the Canterbury Cathedral Archives, by which King Henry II granted the lands Terenure and Kimmage (Cheming) in Rathfarnham to Walter the goldsmith (&#x27;aurifauber&#x27;) in 1175. It has not yet been established how the lands reverted to the crown within 40 years.

On 2 January 1941, during World War II, the German Luftwaffe bombed Terenure, injuring seven people and destroying two houses.

== Education ==
Schools within the Terenure area include St. Joseph&#x27;s BNS, Presentation Primary School, Presentation College (was Presentation secondary school; renamed in 2004), Terenure College and Our Lady&#x27;s Secondary school.

==Religion==
The Catholic parish church of St. Joseph in Terenure is an impressive edifice with a stained glass window by Harry Clarke. St. Joseph&#x27;s school is on the church grounds.
Along with Rathgar and the area around Portobello, Terenure has traditionally been the home of many of Dublin&#x27;s Jewish population. Terenure Synagogue, Dublin&#x27;s main synagogue (Orthodox) is on Rathfarnham Road.

==People==

The author James Joyce, who was born nearby at 41 Brighton Square in Rathgar on 2 February 1882, was baptised at St. Joseph&#x27;s church on 5 February by Rev. John O&#x27;Mulloy. His mother, Mary Jane (May) Murray, was born 90 metres from the church at Terenure Cross in 1859 in the pub owned by her father, John Murray, called The Eagle House.

The village was home to actors, writers and musicians including the artist Mary Perrin, who grew up in Fortfield House, Donal McCann and Máirtín Ó Direáin. Broadcaster Mike Murphy, Derek Daly former Formula One driver, comedian Dave Allen, Olympic boxer Mick Dowling, musicians Republic of Loose, Rob Smith, The Coronas and Grammy-winner Susan McKeown all hail from Terenure.

==Sport==
Terenure is the home of Terenure College RFC, a senior rugby club in Division 1A of the AIB All Ireland League.

Terenure Rangers Football Club provide schoolboy, schoolgirl and adult football for men and women to the surrounding area.

Terenure Sports Club is also in Terenure.

<doc id="727566" wikidata="Q435213" url="?curid=727566" title="Gaius Antonius Hybrida">
<text>Gaius Antonius Hybrida (flourished 1st century BC) was a politician of the Roman Republic. He was the second son of Marcus Antonius and brother of Marcus Antonius Creticus; his mother is unknown. He was also the uncle of the famed triumvir Mark Antony. He had two children, Antonia Hybrida Major and Antonia Hybrida Minor.

Hybrida&#x27;s career began under Lucius Cornelius Sulla, whom he accompanied into Greece as either a military tribune or a legatus. Later, in 63 BC, he was elected to serve as consul of the Roman Republic alongside Marcus Tullius Cicero. The two struck a deal which effectively allowed Cicero to rule as sole consul in exchange for Hybrida receiving the governorship of Macedonia at the end of his term. The same year, Hybrida was involved in suppressing the Catilinarian conspiracy, a plot to overthrow the state led by Lucius Sergius Catilina, or &quot;Catiline&quot;, and which culminated in a battle at Pistoria and the death of Catiline. After his consulship, Hybrida was granted Macedonia as had been promised. Here, Hybrida abused his rule to rob the provincials and led invasions of the neighbouring lands of Moesia. His incursions brought two separate attacks from the natives who successfully forced Hybrida out of their lands without any loot.

In 60 BC, Hybrida was quietly removed from the position of governor of Macedonia and replaced by Gaius Octavius. The next year, he was prosecuted by Julius Caesar and Marcus Licinius Crassus. The outcome of this was that Hybrida was forced to pay a fine and banished to the island Cephalonia. Sometime in 47, Hybrida was recalled from his banishment by Caesar. In 45, he made himself a candidate for the position of censor which ultimately failed. The final mention of Hybrida comes from Cicero in 44 when Mark Antony divorced himself from Hybrida&#x27;s daughter Antonia Hybrida Minor.

== Family ==
Hybrida was the younger of two sons of Marcus Antonius Orator; his brother was Marcus Antonius Creticus. He had also a sister, Antonia. He was also the uncle and father-in-law of Mark Antony. Hybrida had two daughters; Antonia Hybrida Major (&quot;major&quot; meaning &quot;elder&quot;) who married the Roman tribune Lucius Caninius Gallus and Antonia Hybrida Minor (&quot;Minor&quot; Latin for &quot;the younger&quot;) who married her paternal first cousin Mark Antony as his second wife. By his daughters, he had at least two grandchildren; Lucius Caninius Gallus by Antonia Maior and Antonia by Antonia Minor.

==Early career==

=== Mithridatic Wars ===
In 87 BC, Hybrida accompanied Lucius Cornelius Sulla on his campaign against Mithridates VI of Pontus either as a military tribune or as a legate. Two years earlier, the Mithridatic Wars had begun due to a dispute between Mithridates and Nicomedes III of Bithynia over the Roman province of Cappadocia. Mithridates invaded and conquered both Bithynia and Cappadocia before moving on to invade the Roman province of Asia, where he massacred all the Roman citizens he could find. He then sent troops to invade Greece, which in turn spurred some of the city-states to rebel against Rome. At the time Rome was embroiled in internal conflict through the Social War from 91 to 87. Sulla, accompanied by Hybrida, marched on Greece to face the Mithridatic-Greek armies under the command of Archelaus and Aristion. The First Mithridatic War continued from 86 to 83. During this campaign, Sulla drove the Mithridatic-Greek armies back towards Athens and besieged them there. After capturing Athens, Sulla marched north and defeated two large Mithridatic armies at Chaeronea and Orchomenus. He invaded Asia Minor the following year and then successfully forced a peace with Mithridates in 83. Sulla returned to Italy in 83, leaving Lucullus to command forces in Asia and Hybrida to command a small cavalry force in Achaea. In Achaia, Hybrida levied contributions on the province, an offence for which he was prosecuted by the young Julius Caesar in 76. However, he refused to appear and succeeded in escaping punishment after appealing to the plebeian tribunes.

=== Expulsion from, and return to, the Senate ===
Years later, in 70 BC, the censors Gellius and Lentulus expelled Hybrida from the Senate for the criminal offences committed by him while in Greece, for disobeying the summons of a praetor and for the wasteful use of his property. Hybrida is described by the English historian Antony Kamm as &quot;a thoroughly disreputable character&quot; and by author William E. Dunstan as &quot;thuggish&quot;. In spite of this notorious reputation, Hybrida regained his seat in 68 or 66 after being elected as praetor. Hybrida also probably served as a tribune sometime before his expulsion from the Senate and also served as aedile some time between 69 and 66. For the consular elections of 64, Hybrida and another candidate, Catiline, received the support of Caesar and Marcus Licinius Crassus for their bids to become consuls of Rome. Dunstan describes Catiline as an &quot;opportunist&quot; who had gained notoriety for murders during Sulla&#x27;s proscriptions; Kamm expands on this description by including the alleged murder of his own son, violation of a Vestal Virgin and many other &quot;unspeakable profligacies&quot;. A third candidate also existed for the consular elections, Marcus Tullius Cicero, whom Dunstan describes as being a &quot;brilliant orator&quot;, but he came from an undistinguished family. In the end, Cicero and Hybrida were elected consuls for the year 63.

== Consulship ==
Cicero, upon becoming consul, immediately moved to strike a deal with his consular colleague Hybrida, who had supported Catiline and his party, and who might join a rebellion against the state. In exchange for what amounted to the sole consulship for Cicero, Hybrida was to receive the rich consular province of Macedonia. Hybrida himself was heavily in debt and was wasteful of his money, and the wealth of Macedonia could be used by him to restore his lost fortune.

=== Catiliniarian Conspiracy ===
Catiline was once again a candidate for the consulship for the year of 62 BC. As part of his campaign, Catiline promised reforms to reduce and cancel debts, a proposal which brought him the support of bankrupt aristocrats, debtors, and poor farmers whose agricultural ventures had failed. This proposal, however, also pitched the conservatives, moderates and members of the Senate against him. On the day of the elections, Cicero attended wearing a breastplate under his tunic in an attempt to raise the alarm in the Senate and provoke the fear that Catiline might resort to violence as consul. In the end, Lucius Licinius Murena and Decimus Junius Silanus were elected to the position of consul and Catiline&#x27;s bid for the position had once again failed. In response, and having lost hope of having a successful political career, Catiline began to conspire against the Senate. Cicero employed spies to keep tabs on Catiline and began to piece together a case against Catiline to be brought to the Senate. In the midst of these developments, Hybrida first tried to remain on the fence, but was forced to action in the face of the risk of having himself charged as a co-conspirator. On 6 November 63, Cicero learned of a plot to have himself and other members of the Senate assassinated and Rome set on fire and sacked. While this was happening, Catiline and an army of his supporters, under the command of Gaius Manlius, were to march on Rome and take control of the city. In response to these allegations, Cicero called a meeting of the Senate which Catiline himself attended. At this meeting, Cicero launched an attack against Catiline denouncing him &quot;to his face&quot; while providing the details of the plot that he had learned of the night before. After this meeting, Catiline fled the city of Rome to join up with Manlius and an army of approximately 10,000 men at Etruria. The Senate, upon becoming aware of this, issued a &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot; declaring Catiline and his army as enemies of the state. Finally, Cicero arrested five men to be brought to the Senate for an immediate trial, the outcome of which was an order for their executions which was delivered and enacted by the Senate.

Towards the end of 63, Hybrida went to Etruria to assist the praetor Quintus Metellus Celer in preventing Catiline escaping through the Alps and into Gaul. Catiline, hoping that Hybrida might choose to help him, opted to engage him and his consular army rather than the forces under the praetor. Hybrida, however, had given command of the army to his legate, Marcus Petreius, having either suffered a bout of gout or pretended to have. Catiline put up his final resistance in Pistoria, Etruria, with an army of 3,000 men. Here, Petreius and his soldiers massacred the entire army, killed and beheaded Catiline, and then sent his head to Rome. Hybrida, having adhered to the agreement that he had with Cicero and the Senate, was granted the governorship of Macedonia at the end of his consulship.

== Governor of Macedonia ==
Immediately upon receiving the governorship of Macedonia, Hybrida set about robbing and plundering the provincials. An accountant in his court spread a report claiming that Hybrida&#x27;s plundering had yielded as much profit for Cicero as it did for Hybrida himself; however, if he had indeed robbed the provincials on Cicero&#x27;s account he never paid his dues to Cicero. Hybrida then began to move on to the barbarian lands around Macedonia with the same intent to pillage as he had in Macedonia. It was during these incursions that Hybrida suffered two successive defeats: the first came at the hands of the Dardanians after he had encroached upon their land in Lower Moesia, and the second at the Battle of Histria in Upper Moesia. The ancient Roman historian Cassius Dio narrates the events thus:

In both of these instances, a failed retreat by Hybrida and his cavalry led to his unit being absolutely defeated and any plunder accrued during the attack was forfeited back to the natives. This lack of success, rather than the extortion of the provincials, drew the attention of the Senate who threatened to recall and prosecute Hybrida for his mismanagement of the province. In 60 BC, Hybrida was quietly replaced by Gaius Octavius as the Governor of Macedonia and in March of 59, during the consulship of Caesar and Marcus Culpurnius Bibulus, was prosecuted for the mishandling of the governorship by Caesar and Crassus. In the end, Hybrida was tried by Marcus Caelius Rufus for his participation in the Catilinarian conspiracy and by Lucius Caninius Gallus for his crimes in Macedonia. He was defended by Cicero, not out of duty but as a protest against the current state of affairs in Rome. Despite this, Hybrida was found guilty of his crimes, ordered to pay a fine, and banished from Rome to a place of his choosing. Hybrida settled upon Cephallenia as his residence for the duration of his exile.

== Exile and later career ==
During his exile at Cephellenia, Hybrida pretended to act as governor of the island which the people secretly allowed. In 49 BC, his nephew, Mark Antony, was elected to the role of tribune of the people and a legate of Caesar&#x27;s in Italy. Despite this, Hybrida remained in exile until 47 when he returned to Rome at Caesar&#x27;s request. One possible explanation for this is that Mark Antony was indebted to Hybrida; as Hybrida was in exile and had no civil rights, he could not enforce a payment and this suited Mark Antony. Hybrida was a candidate for censorship around 45; his character and support from Mark Antony, however, doomed his candidacy. The final mention of Hybrida during his life comes from Cicero who commented upon Mark Antony&#x27;s divorce from Antonia Hybrida Minor and the insult this conferred upon Hybrida himself.

<doc id="727567" wikidata="Q358528" url="?curid=727567" title="Adly Yakan Pasha">
<text>Adly Yakan Pasha (; 18 January 1864 – 22 October 1933), was from the Yeghen/Yakan Family and a member of the Muhammed Ali Dynasty. He was sometimes referred to as Adly Pasha, was an Egyptian political figure. He served as the 14th prime minister of Egypt between 1921 and 1922, again between 1926 and 1927, and finally in 1929. He held several prominent political posts including foreign minister, interior minister and Speaker of the Egyptian Senate.

==Personal life==

<text>The July Cup is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run on the July Course at Newmarket over a distance of 6 furlongs (1,207 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in July.

It is one of Britain&#x27;s most valuable and prestigious sprint races, and many of its winners have been acknowledged as the champion sprinter in Europe.

==History==
The event was established in 1876, and the first two runnings were won by Springfield, a colt bred by Queen Victoria at the Hampton Court Stud.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the July Cup was initially classed at Group 2 level. It was promoted to Group 1 status in 1978.

The July Cup was part of the Global Sprint Challenge from 2008 to 2017. It was the sixth leg of the series, preceded by the Diamond Jubilee Stakes and followed by the Sprinters Stakes.

The race is currently held on the final day of Newmarket&#x27;s three-day July Festival meeting.

<doc id="727569" wikidata="Q298190" url="?curid=727569" title="Robert Prosinečki">
<text>Robert Prosinečki (; born 12 January 1969) is a professional football manager and former player who played as a midfielder. Born in West Germany, he internationally represented Yugoslavia and later Croatia. He is the current manager of the Montenegro national team.

Early in his career, he was part of the Red Star Belgrade team that won three Yugoslav First League titles and the European Cup in 1991. Prosinečki spent several years in Spain with rivals Real Madrid and Barcelona, as well as Oviedo and Sevilla. Later in his career, he won three Croatian league titles with Dinamo Zagreb, and also played in Belgium, England and Slovenia.

Internationally, Prosinečki was voted best player as Yugoslavia won the 1987 FIFA World Youth Championship, and came runner-up with the under-21 team at the 1990 European Championship. He was also voted Best Young Player at the 1990 FIFA World Cup. He earned 49 caps for Croatia between 1994 and 2002, playing at UEFA Euro 1996 and the World Cups of 1998 and 2002, helping the team to third place in 1998.

After retiring from active football, Prosinečki worked as assistant manager of the Croatia national team between 2006 and 2010, before being appointed manager of Red Star Belgrade in December 2010. He left in 2012 for Turkish club Kayserispor two months later. Internationally, Prosinečki worked as head coach of the Azerbaijan national team from 2014 to 2017 and of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 2018 to 2019. He then once again managed Kayserispor, Denizlispor, Olimpija Ljubljana and Rudeš.

==Early life and career==
Prosinečki was born in Schwenningen, West Germany, into a family of Yugoslav gastarbeiters. His father Đuro Prosinečki (1939-2003) was a Croat, hailing from the Gornji Čemehovec village near Kraljevec na Sutli, and his mother Emilija Đoković is a Serb, originally from the Ježevica village near Čačak.

A few years after his birth, the family moved to Nürtingen near Stuttgart where, by the decision of his passionate football enthusiast father who ran a construction business for a living, five-year-old Robert was signed up for the Stuttgarter Kickers youth system. Closely monitored by his father, who reportedly drove him to and from every practice and watched his every match, the youngster progressed along in the club&#x27;s youth categories. The parents decided to move back to SR Croatia within SFR Yugoslavia in 1979, bringing ten-year-old Robert and his two siblings along. Once in Croatia, just like in West Germany prior, his father Đuro signed up his adolescent son to the youth setup of Dinamo Zagreb and continued monitoring his progress closely.

==Club career==
===Dinamo Zagreb===
After moving up the youth ranks for years, Prosinečki started getting occasional first team appearances during the 1986–87 league season under head coach Miroslav Blažević. On his league debut versus Željezničar on 2 November 1986, the seventeen-year-old managed to score in a 2–1 home win. By the end of the season, he recorded one more league appearance: playing the second half versus Sloboda Tuzla on 12 April 1987, a goalless home draw.

Wanting to secure his son&#x27;s financial future, Prosinečki&#x27;s father Đuro started pushing within the club hierarchy for a professional contract to be given to his eighteen-year-old son. However, coach Miroslav Blažević sent him away, once famously claiming while doing a guest spot on a local radio phone-in sports show that he would &quot;eat his coaching diploma if Prosinečki ever became a proper football player&quot;.

===Red Star Belgrade===
In the summer of 1987, Đuro Prosinečki took 18-year-old Robert over to Belgrade and got the professional contract they were after. Dragan Džajić, Red Star&#x27;s then technical director, remembers how the transfer got initiated: 

Despite evident quality and obvious technical ability, in order to further assess an unproven prospect who hadn&#x27;t been on their radar, Red Star management reportedly also inquired about Prosinečki—as well as about the player-management relations and overall atmosphere within Dinamo—with their own defender Milivoj Bračun who had spent years at Dinamo before moving to Belgrade.

Within weeks, in late June 1987, as the league season ended and the summer transfer window opened, Prosinečki and his father went back to Belgrade where he took part in a few more training sessions with the Red Star Belgrade squad that was temporarily missing some of its marquee players such as Dragan Stojković, Boro Cvetković and newly-signed Refik Šabanadžović, who were in Zagreb competing at 1987 Universiade with the Yugoslavia national team. Furthermore, Prosinečki played a friendly match versus the recently-promoted Second League side FK Rad. Satisfied again with his skills, technical director Džajić wanted to sign the professional contract right away, however, Prosinečki and his father wanted to go back to Zagreb one more time, ostensibly to get more of their personal belongings before coming back to sign. Afraid that young Prosinečki might try to leverage the accolades from his Belgrade tryouts in order to improve his standing back in Dinamo and possibly stay in Zagreb, Džajić insisted on contract being signed immediately, but eventually relented by taking Prosinečki&#x27;s father&#x27;s word that they will indeed come back to Belgrade and sign with Red Star.

After signing, young Prosinečki&#x27;s initial accommodation—a room in Hotel Srbija—was paid for by the club.

====1987-88 season: immediate breakthrough, World Youth champion====
Immediately upon joining his new club, Prosinečki became a first team regular and furthermore, much to Blažević&#x27;s chagrin, also rapidly established himself as one of Yugoslavia&#x27;s most gifted and talented players. Playing under head coach Vasović, the youngster secured a regular spot in Red Star&#x27;s midfield alongside Dragan Stojković, Žarko Đurović and Goran Milojević just a few weeks into the 1987–88 league season, opening his Red Star scoring account in the process during only his second match for the club—a 7–1 home rout of Priština on 9 August 1987. Several weeks later on 6 September 1987 at the Večiti derbi against cross-town rival FK Partizan in front of a packed house of 55,000 spectators at Stadion JNA, playing in the very first big match of his career, Prosinečki made a valuable contribution to his team&#x27;s 2–3 win, memorably setting up teammate Bora Cvetković with a remarkably accurate long-distance through pass that the forward put away for a 1–3 lead early into the second half, putting the highly competitive contest out of Partizan&#x27;s reach.

In October 1987, he was part of the Yugoslav youth squad which won the World Youth Championship in Chile, with Prosinečki winning the Golden Ball award as the tournament&#x27;s best player. Playing in Chile meant that he was away from the club for the entire month of October, and he was already held in such high regard at Red Star, that the club brass attempted to bring him back from South America after the tournament&#x27;s group stages, so that he could play in their 1987–88 UEFA Cup second round tie versus Club Brugge. The Yugoslav team players protested to FIFA, and João Havelange, the organisation&#x27;s chairman at the time, intervened to keep Prosinečki in Chile.

After Prosinečki&#x27;s return from Chile to rejoin Red Star, the club&#x27;s executive board decided to provide him with a two-bedroom apartment where the player moved to from his initial hotel accommodation.

During his four-year spell at the club, Prosinečki helped Red Star win three Yugoslav First League titles and one Yugoslav Cup, as well as participating in the club&#x27;s greatest success in history by winning the 1991 European Cup.

===Real Madrid===
Prosinečki joined Spanish giants Real Madrid during the summer of 1991 for a transfer fee of ₧ 450 million (€15 million). Led by club president Ramón Mendoza and head coach Radomir Antić, the club had huge expectations from their expensive and highly rated signing. Real were coming off a difficult season during which they made two coaching changes before barely managing a UEFA Cup spot by finishing third in La Liga under Antić, their third head coach that season.

However, pretty much immediately, 22-year-old Prosinečki got sidelined with a string of muscular injuries. Administered by team doctors, he underwent a series of tests as well as a strict dietary regime in addition to getting forced into changing many lifestyle-related habits. Still, the first season turned out to be a complete write-off: he appeared in only three league matches with a notable shining moment — scoring a free-kick goal versus Barcelona in El Clásico on 19 October 1991.

Although injury-riddled as well, Prosinečki&#x27;s second season at Real did provide a hint of a breakthrough with 29 league appearances and three goals, however, it was still far off the expectations indicated by his reputation and price tag.

His best season at Real, 1993–94, would incidentally turn out to be his last with the club, with six league goals.

====Loan to Oviedo====
During the 1994 summer transfer window, after three indifferent seasons in Madrid, Real brass decided that Prosinečki&#x27;s physical fragility and injuries were too much to deal with, offloading the twenty-five-year-old to Real Oviedo on a loan deal. Reuniting with Radomir Antić—the same head coach who had brought him to Real three years earlier—Prosinečki ended up playing his best season yet in Spain, even winning a league match against his former club Real Madrid in May 1995. 
He stood out for his good performances as an organizer, he recovered his best level and he felt more satisfied with his physical and psychological state. He also started being a regular in the Croatia national team. In his statements to the press reflected &quot;I&#x27;m enjoying my football&quot; and reaffirmed his intention to leave Real Madrid without fulfilling the fifth year of contract he had left.

===Barcelona===
The summer 1995 arrival of Radomir Antić to Atlético Madrid motivated Atlético to reach an agreement with Real Madrid, whom Prosinečki was still contracted to. However, Barcelona stepped in by presenting Zoran Vekić, the Croatian&#x27;s agent, with a better offer. While the interest of the Colchoneros was made public, the other bid was not leaked to the press. At the end, Prosinečki became a free agent, he rejected Atlético and signed on 20 July 1995 to Barcelona with a contract of €3 million for three seasons, plus two optional. Ramón Mendoza did not want his eternal rival to take the midfielder free, but the bad economic situation of Real Madrid precipitated his departure.

In Barcelona, he suffered muscle injuries again that made him miss the first part of the season. By the time he recovered, coach Johan Cruyff did not trust him and relegated him to the substitution bench, so he only played 19 games in the 1995–96 season.

The following season, 1996–97, new manager Bobby Robson reduced Prosinečki to friendly matches. After this, Prosinečki wanted to leave. On 14 December 1996, he was sold to Sevilla for €1.67 million.

===Sevilla===
Prosinečki spent the rest of the 1996-97 season in Sevilla and was always a first choice pick for the team.

===Croatia Zagreb===
In 1997, he returned home to play for Croatia Zagreb (Dinamo&#x27;s name at the time) for a fee of €2.5 million. His arrival was very well received by the fans and meant the return of the midfielder to the club where he began his professional career.

During his first season, he won the double with the team and reached the UEFA Cup third round, where Prosinečki&#x27;s performances where a key factor to victory against MTK Hungária and Grasshopper.

The next two seasons saw Prosinečki lead as captain one of the best generations of Dinamo Zagreb, winning the league twice and playing in the UEFA Champions League in consecutive seasons. In their European campaign, Dinamo reached their best result in the competition. Prosinečki will be remembered by the fans most notably for his performances against Celtic and Manchester United.

===Hrvatski Dragovoljac and Standard Liège===
On 14 July 2000, Prosinečki signed to Hrvatski Dragovoljac as a free agent. The club president Stjepan Spajić said Prosinečki would sign a two-year contract with a clause that he could leave if a foreign club would make an offer to him.

In January 2001, he moved again to Standard Liège where he played until the end of the season, finishing third in the Belgian First Division.

===Portsmouth===
In summer of 2001, 32-year-old Prosinečki signed for First Division (second-tier of the English football league system) side Portsmouth on a one-year deal. He was signed by the club&#x27;s Yugoslav owner, Milan Mandarić. His goals and assists in the 2001–02 season were instrumental in saving the team from relegation, the highlight of which was scoring a hat-trick against Barnsley in a 4–4 home draw on 2 February 2002. It was the only hat-trick of his career, but he refused the customary match ball at the end of the game, as his team had not won. Prosinečki is still held as a folk hero at Portsmouth for his performances in his sole season with the club. At the end of the 2007–08 season, the readers of &quot;The News&quot; picked Prosinečki as part of an all-time best Portsmouth eleven. He was the only non-British player to be among the selection. After speaking with Prosinečki, fellow Croat Niko Kranjčar made the decision to sign for Portsmouth in the summer of 2006.

===Later career===
Prosinečki then had a one-year stint at Olimpija Ljubljana. With Olimpija Ljubljana Prosinečki won his last trophy, the 2002–03 Slovenian Cup; he even scored a goal in the final.
In the summer of 2003, Prosinečki moved back to his home country to play one more professional season for NK Zagreb. He then ended his playing career with low tier club Savski Marof in the spring of 2005.

==International career==
Prosinečki had 49 caps for Croatia and scored 10 goals for his country. He was also capped 15 times, scoring four goals, for Yugoslavia. In 1987, he was named the tournament&#x27;s best player as Yugoslavia won the World Youth Championship in Chile along with fellow Croatians Zvonimir Boban, Robert Jarni, Davor Šuker and Igor Štimac.

Prosinečki then played for Yugoslavia at the 1990 World Cup, and for Croatia at Euro 1996 and the 1998 and 2002 World Cups. It was at the 1998 World Cup that Prosinečki and the Croatian squad managed a historic third-place finish, with Prosinečki scoring two goals throughout the tournament, including one in Croatia&#x27;s 2–1 victory over the Netherlands in the bronze-medal match; as a result, he is the only player in history to have scored World Cup finals goals for two different national teams.

In 1990, Prosinečki scored one goal for Yugoslavia in a group match against the United Arab Emirates and eight years later, he added two goals for Croatia by scoring in a group match against Jamaica and in the third place match against the Netherlands. He played in a total of nine World Cup matches, three for Yugoslavia in 1990 and six for Croatia in 1998 and 2002.

==Style of play==
Prosinečki, nicknamed &quot;Žuti&quot; (&quot;the Yellow One&quot;) throughout his career due to his blond hair, was considered one of the most creative and technically skilled footballers who emerged from Eastern Europe in the 1980s. His favourite position was that of a pure midfielder, although he often also played as a right winger or as an attacking midfielder, and delayed his relocation to the centre of the pitch in order to elaborate and organize the attacking plays of his teammates with his passing, as the number 10 role best utilized his excellent vision of the game. He used to retain possession due to his dribbling skills and would impose his pace on rivals with his passing and ability to exploit spaces. On a technical level, he stood out for his ability to pass short, dribble, and drive forward with the ball. He also had a strong shot that made him dangerous from set pieces.

His style was criticized at times by some Real Madrid fans, although he was often played out of position during his time in the Spanish capital. Vicente del Bosque, his last coach with the team, recovered him for the playmaker role and defined his performances in the following way:

Prosinečki has stated that out of the coaches he played for his favourite was Johan Cruyff.

His biggest weaknesses as a footballer were his proneness to muscle injuries (which saw him sidelined for almost the entire 1991–92 season), his poor defensive work-rate, his inconsistency, and his motivation. He also reproached himself for his addiction to tobacco.

==Managerial career==
===Early career===
Prosinečki began his managerial career in 2004 as an assistant to Mile Petković at NK Zagreb.

In 2006, he was named the assistant to head coach Slaven Bilić in the Croatia national football team. He went with them to UEFA Euro 2008.

===Red Star Belgrade===
In December 2010, during the 2010–11 Serbian SuperLiga mid-season winter break, Prosinečki was announced as the new manager of Red Star Belgrade, replacing recently released Aleksandar Kristić. Returning to the club of his biggest playing successes, the announcement made major headlines all over the Balkans and also generated plenty of buzz in the rest of Europe. The angle of Prosinečki being the first Croatian to coach in Serbia following the Yugoslav Wars also got a lot of attention. His annual salary was not officially disclosed, however, Serbian press speculated with figures from US$100,000 to $250,000 per year.

At the time of Prosinečki taking over, fifteen matches into the league season, the famous yet recently beleaguered Serbian club was in second place, five points behind league leaders Partizan. Red Star brass led by club president Vladan Lukić (Prosinečki&#x27;s former teammate at Marakana) thus steered clear of stating league title as an explicit requirement for the club legend, still, it was understood that making an outside run at the title remained a priority. Prosinečki announced his intent to mold Red Star into an attacking team that utilizes short-passing game to break down opponents, picking Slobodan Marović and Žarko Đurović (also Red Star colleagues from playing days) to be his assistants. Immediately, however, the issue of Prosinečki&#x27;s pro coaching licence came up when it was discovered that he may not yet meet criteria for one, which according to Serbian SuperLiga rules would preclude him from being physically present on the sidelines during official matches. The things were straightened out by the time league restarted and Prosinečki&#x27;s bench debut, which was scheduled to take place versus Smederevo at Marakana on 26 February 2011.

His side finished in second place, six points off bitter rivals Partizan. The following season, 2011–12, his side again finished in second place and again second to Partizan, this time the margin was doubled from six to twelve points. In August 2012, Prosinečki resigned as manager of Red Star, even though he won the 2011–12 Serbian Cup after beating Borac Čačak in the final 2–0, on 16 May 2012.

===Kayserispor===
On 15 October 2012, it was announced that Prosinečki would replace Shota Arveladze as manager of struggling Kayserispor in the Turkish Super League. He became the new head coach of Kayserispor at the eighth week of the 2012–13 Süper Lig, and he gained 13 wins in 27 league matches and finished the league at fifth position.

The start of the 2013–14 season was not so successful for Prosinečki and his team. After achieving only one victory in eleven rounds, Kayserispor was at the bottom of the league table. In November 2013, Prosinečki resigned but his resignation was not accepted by the club board. A month and a half later, the club record had not improved. Kayserispor was 17th on the Süper Lig table and lost to Tokatspor in the Turkish Cup. In the last days of 2013, Prosinečki definitively resigned as manager of Kayserispor.

===Azerbaijan===
On 3 December 2014, Prosinečki was named the new manager of the Azerbaijan national football team, replacing Berti Vogts with a two-year contract until UEFA Euro 2016. His contract fee was reported around $1.5 million. After three years spent in Azerbaijan, it was announced that he did not extend his contract for two more years with the Azerbaijan Football Association, and left the team shortly after. Prosinečki is considered one of the finest coaches of Azerbaijan national team, along with Berti Vogts.
Under his guidance Azerbaijan played well, having drawn against Croatia 0–0, undefeated against Norway, an away draw against Czech Republic, victory over Qatar 2–0, victory over Malta 2–0, and biggest victory in Azerbaijan history – 5–1 against San Marino. Despite this, he opted to leave Azerbaijan, having failed to guide Azerbaijan to qualify for any major competitions.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
On 4 January 2018, Prosinečki was named the new manager of the Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team.

On 15 November 2018, after a goalless draw against Austria in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League, Bosnia and Herzegovina topped its group and got promoted to the League A of the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League. With that draw, Prosinečki tied Safet Sušić&#x27;s record with a 10-game unbeaten run in all official matches as Bosnia and Herzegovina national team manager. He secured play-offs for Euro 2020 by topping the group.

On 18 November, Prosinečki had a chance to make a new, eleven-game unbeaten run record against Spain in a friendly match, but he did not, as Bosnia and Herzegovina lost 1–0 with a 78th-minute goal from Brais Méndez to secure Spain a win. Even though Bosnia and Herzegovina lost, throughout the whole match they were considered an equal opponent by some and some thought it showed what kind of change Prosinečki had made to the players and to their mentality and style of play.

His biggest win as the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team head coach came on 5 September 2019, in a 5–0 home win against Liechtenstein in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifiers.

On 8 September 2019, three days after the victory over Lichtenstein, Prosinečki resigned from the position of Bosnia and Herzegovina national team head coach after a 2–4 away loss against Armenia, thus losing almost every direct chance of qualifying for the Euros. Two days later, on 10 September, Prosinečki decided to remain as head coach. He stated that after talks with the Bosnia and Herzegovina FA board of directors, they eventually convinced him to withdraw the decision. His campaign during the qualifying had already been depressing, as Bosnia and Herzegovina suffered a shock 0–2 away loss to Finland, a poor 2–2 home draw with Greece and a 1–2 away defeat to Italy before the humiliating 2–4 loss away to Armenia.

Upon his first games following his decision to withdrawal the resignation as coach of the national team, Bosnia and Herzegovina managed to convincingly defeat Finland 4–1 at home soil to keep them on the race for the Euro spot. However, Bosnia and Herzegovina fell 1–2 away to already eliminated Greece, that unofficially eliminated Bosnia and Herzegovina from qualifying directly.

On 27 November 2019, it was announced that Prosinečki and the Bosnia and Herzegovina FA had reached mutual agreement for him to leave his role.

===Return to Kayserispor===
On 29 December 2019, Prosinečki came back to Kayserispor, managing the club for a second time in his managerial career and managing a club for the first time in over six years. On 6 August 2020, he left the club after rejecting a two-year contract extension because of the club&#x27;s transfer policy for the following season, which was conditioned by a transfer limit determined by the Turkish Football Federation.

===Denizlispor===
On 10 August 2020, Prosinečki was named the new manager of Denizlispor. He resigned on 24 November after a disappointing start to the season.

===Olimpija Ljubljana===
On 22 March 2022, Prosinečki signed a two-year contract with Slovenian PrvaLiga side Olimpija Ljubljana, replacing fellow countryman Dino Skender. He left the club on 1 July 2022, together with sporting director Mladen Rudonja, after a dispute with club owner Adam Delius.

===Rudeš===
After a year without a club, Prosinečki became the manager of newly promoted Croatian top division side Rudeš on 7 June 2023, replacing Davor Mladina.

==Minifootball==
Both during and after his career as a professional footballer, Prosinečki has also participated at the Kutija Šibica Minifootball tournaments in Zagreb. He won first place in 1989 with a team called Termotehna Šela, then in 1998 with team Moby Dick Segafredo and in 2002, 2003, 2004 with team Riva Grupa. In 1997, Moby Dick came in second place. In 2003, Prosinečki was awarded best player of the tournament.

Prosinečki even coached a team named Promotionplay in 2006 where they lost 5–0 in the final.

On 26 December 2017, Prosinečki played at a humanitarian tournament Četiri kafića (Four cafés), receiving a standing ovation from the fans in Arena Gripe during his performances while playing.

==Entrepreneurship==
In March 2007, several years following the end of his football playing career, Prosinečki decided to invest some of his earnings into launching a restaurant in Zagreb. Named Prosikito, after the nickname Spanish press gave him during his time in La Liga, the restaurant is located in the Zagreb neighbourhood of Stara Peščenica and is run day-to-day by his younger brother Sven Daniel.

In late February 2016, in partnership with another retired footballer, Janko Janković, Prosinečki opened an 8-court indoor padel commercial facility called Padel.hr at the Zagreb Fair. Prosinečki and Janković became aware of padel — a simplified version of tennis with elements of squash — during their respective professional footballing stints in Spain and decided to try to monetize it back home where it is largely unknown. After struggling to attract patrons initially, the facility has reportedly recorded significant growth since with 7,000 registered players.

==Controversy==
===Relationship with Ćiro Blažević===
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, parallel with Prosinečki&#x27;s rise to football superstardom at Red Star Belgrade, Real Madrid, Barcelona as well as Yugoslav and Croatia national teams, the story of him being chased away from Dinamo Zagreb in 1987 by the famous coach Ćiro Blažević grew in Croatian and Yugoslav media and public. To this day it is often cited and referenced as an example of football mismanagement, poor player selection, and bad work with youth categories. Colourful Blažević, the villain of the piece, rarely talked on the record about the circumstances of Prosinečki&#x27;s departure. However, in 2010, Blažević deflected responsibility for the flap by claiming he actually gave the youngster a four-year contract that was eventually, according to Blažević, annulled by Dinamo president Ante Pavlović on a technicality due to not being processed administratively by the subfederation responsible. On the same occasion, Blažević went on to accuse Prosinečki&#x27;s father Đuro of not negotiating in good faith with Dinamo by saying &quot;he already had his combination with Red Star&quot;. Asked about his famous quote about eating his diploma if Prosinečki ever became a player, Blažević responded that he only used it as a motivation tool.

Blažević and Prosinečki would reignite their simmering feud eleven years later during the 1998 World Cup where they were part of the Croatia national team that made it all the way to the semi-finals. In the semi-final match that Croatia lost 1–2 versus eventual winners France after going ahead 1–0, Blažević decided to leave 29-year-old Prosinečki on the bench (he eventually entered the contest in the 90th minute, coming on for Mario Stanić), which led to a lot of criticism.

===Court case versus Dinamo===
In the summer of 1997, twenty-eight-year-old Prosinečki came back to Zagreb in order to play for the club where he had started his professional career eleven years earlier, Dinamo Zagreb. Now called &quot;Croatia Zagreb&quot;, the club was turned into a state project bankrolled by the Croatian government&#x27;s highest echelons and personally supported by the country&#x27;s president Franjo Tuđman. By 2000, Prosinečki left Croatia Zagreb, but in late 2001, decided to initiate a lawsuit against the club (whose name had been restored back to Dinamo in the meantime due to continuous fan protests) over DM1,550,000 (€750,000) in unpaid wages.

Years later in 2009, the court ruled against Prosinečki, asserting that the lawsuit against Dinamo had no merit since Prosinečki played for Croatia Zagreb, and not Dinamo Zagreb. Commenting on the verdict in late 2009, Prosinečki said he was cheated out of his money.

==Personal life==
In June 1999, Prosinečki married his girlfriend Vlatka. The couple have two daughters.

Prosinečki was an avid cigarette smoker throughout his career playing professional football, which many of his former teammates talked about in form of anecdotes.

In 2019, Bosnia-Herzegovina national team head coach Prosinečki&#x27;s name was in the news in Croatia due to his wife Vlatka&#x27;s purchase of a Range Rover Sport SDV6 HSE vehicle from a local Croatia-based vendor that was found to be part of a Croatian-Slovenian organized crime luxury vehicle import ring, offering vehicles at lower prices by evading value-added tax payments through fraudulent invoices. In addition to Prosinečki&#x27;s wife, his brother Sven Daniel was also interviewed by the Croatian police during their investigation.

<text>Adolphe Yvon (30 January 1817 – 11 September 1893) was a French painter known for his paintings of the Napoleonic Wars. Yvon studied under Paul Delaroche, rose to fame during the Second Empire, then finished his career as a teacher.

==Career==
Adolphe Yvon was born on 30 January 1817 in Eschweiler. Shortly after the end of the Crimean War in September 1855, Yvon was commissioned by the French government to paint a large picture of the capture of the Malakoff at Sevastopol. He sailed for the Crimea on February 19, 1856, where he spent six weeks compiling a portfolio of sketches, as well as visiting the battlefield of Inkerman. In 1857, the finished painting &quot;La Prise de la tour de Malakoff 8 septembre 1855&quot; was shown at the Paris Salon, and two years later came &quot;La Gorge de Malakoff&quot;, and &quot;La courtine de Malakoff&quot;. &quot;La Prise&quot; was a massive piece measuring 6 metres by 9 metres and represented the moment when the fortification was captured around midday.

In the succeeding years, Emperor Napoleon III began to admire his battle scenes. Yvon became an officer of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1867, and painted Napoleon III&#x27;s portrait the following year (unlocated). Yvon was known as the leading teacher of drawing at the École des Beaux-Arts (1863–83). Some of his most notable students include António Soares dos Reis and Henrique Pousão. A few Americans received instruction from him, including Christian Schussele, Alfred Wordsworth Thompson, William Sartain, and J. Alden Weir. The latter took Yvon&#x27;s afternoon life-drawing class starting in the fall of 1874. Yvon provided the subject for compositional sketches for his students, for example, &quot;The Assassination of Julius Caesar&quot;, for which he specified how it should be done: &quot;Caesar covers his head with his toga . . . he was shoved to the base of Pompey&#x27;s statue, which became bathed in his blood.&quot; (Archives of the École des Beaux-Arts, Archives Nationales, AJ52 63). Alexander Stewart, the American collector, commissioned Yvon to paint &quot;The Reconciliation of the North and the South&quot; (lost) in 1870, as well as &quot;The Genius of America&quot; (1858, 1870). His &quot;Portrait of President Carnot&quot; (1888) appeared at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition.

He died on 11 September 1893 in Paris.

<text>The King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run at Ascot over a distance of 1 mile 3 furlongs and 211 yards (2,406 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in July.

It is Britain&#x27;s most prestigious open-age flat race, and its roll of honour features some of the most highly acclaimed horses of the sport&#x27;s recent history. The 1975 running, which involved a hard-fought battle to the finish between Grundy and Bustino, is frequently described as the &quot;race of the century&quot;. Many of its winners subsequently compete in the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe, and a number go on to have a successful career at stud. The race is often informally referred to as the &quot;King George&quot;.

==History==
The event was formed as the result of an amalgamation of two separate races at Ascot which were established in 1946 and 1948. The first of these, named after King George VI, was a 2-mile contest for three-year-olds held in October. The second, in honour of his wife, Queen Elizabeth, was a one and a half-mile event staged in July. The idea was conceived by Major John Crocker Bulteel, the Clerk of the Course at Ascot, who wanted to create an important international race over one and a half miles for horses aged three or older. The inaugural running of the combined race took place on 21 July 1951. In its first year, to commemorate the Festival of Britain, it was titled the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Festival of Britain Stakes.

During the early part of its history the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes was not commercially sponsored. Its first period of sponsorship started in 1972, when it began a long association with the diamond company De Beers. The word &quot;Diamond&quot; was added to the race&#x27;s title when permission for its inclusion was given by Queen Elizabeth II in 1975. It became known as the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes, and De Beers continued to back the event until 2006.

The online betting company Betfair started to sponsor the King George in 2009, and its prize fund was increased from £750,000 to £1,000,000. It is now Britain&#x27;s second richest horse race, with a purse exceeded only by that of The Derby.

The King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes became part of the Breeders&#x27; Cup Challenge series in 2011. The winner now earns an automatic invitation to compete in the same year&#x27;s Breeders&#x27; Cup Turf.

<doc id="727584" wikidata="Q5138561" url="?curid=727584" title="Coat of arms of the Drapers Company">
<text>The [[Worshipful Company of Drapers]], informally known as the Drapers&#x27; Company and formally known as The Master and Wardens and Brethren and Sisters of the Guild or Fraternity of the Blessed Mary the Virgin of the Mystery of Drapers of the City of London, was probably the first corporate body in England to be granted a coat of arms, on 10 March 1438/9 by Sir William Bruges, Garter King of Arms. The patent dated 1439 is the earliest surviving such grant of arms made to a corporate body in England. The arms were modified in 1561, when the crest was added and the lion supporters granted. These grants were superseded in 1613 with minor modifications. The modern blazon is: &quot;Azure, three clouds radiated proper each adorned with a triple crown or&quot;. The triple crown contains a cap (velvet/fabric lining visible through the gold structure) &quot;gules&quot;.

The arms is also used by Bancroft&#x27;s School in London, supported by the Company.

==Original grant==
The Drapers Company received its original grant of arms in 1439, from Sir William Bruges, Garter King of Arms. The &quot;Fraternity&quot; was founded under the protection of &quot;Blessed Mary the Virgin&quot;, which is reflected in the iconography of the arms. The Garter King explained his design of the arms as follows:
:&quot;That is to say in honour of the very glorious Virgin and Mother Mary who is in the shadow of the sun and yet shines with all clearness and purity. I have devised in the blazon three sunbeams issuing from three flaming clouds crowned with three Imperial crowns of gold on a shield of azure&quot;.
The original arms had supporters of two angels.

===Greenway Porch depiction (1517)===
An elaborate pre-Reformation relief stonework sculpture, showing the Drapers Company arms in a relevant context, survives in the &quot;Greenway Porch&quot;, built in 1517 against the south wall of St Peter&#x27;s Church in Tiverton, Devon, by the wealthy merchant John Greenway (d.1529), a member of the Drapers Company and of the Merchant Adventurers Company. It shows Greenway (left, with monogram &quot;JG&quot; in a quatrefoil above) and his wife kneeling on either side of the Virgin Mary who is ascending into Heaven. Below the Virgin is an heraldic escutcheon showing the arms of the Drapers Company (&quot;Azure, three clouds radiated proper each adorned with a triple crown or&quot;), with the very rarely surviving pre-Reformation angel supporters, the Virgin being the patroness of the Drapers Company.

==1561 amendments==
In 1561, two decades after the Reformation, the arms were inspected and confirmed by William Harvey, Clarenceux King of Arms. A new crest was granted of &quot;A golden ram&quot;, and the angel supporters were replaced by &quot;Two lions or pelletée&quot;.

==1613 amendments==
In 1613 the Imperial crowns were modified in shape and a motto was granted, namely: &quot;Unto God only be Honour and Glory&quot;. The
new grant was made on 6 June 1613 by Garter King of Arms Sir William Segar, with blazon as follows:

:&quot;Azure, upon three clouds proper the sunbeams issuing three imperial triple crowns gold&quot; (&quot;On a blue background, three clouds of natural colour from which are shining down sunbeams, each surmounted at the top with an Imperial triple-tiered gold crown&quot;)
The supporters are &quot;Two lions or pelletée&quot; (&quot;Two gold lions covered with black roundels&quot;). The crest is blazoned: &quot;On a wreath of their colours a mount vert thereon a ram jacent fleeced gold armed and unguled sable&quot; (&quot;On a braided wreath of blue and gold cord stands a green hill on top of which lies gold ram with head raised and with black horns and hooves&quot;). The mantle (cloth covering the helmet) is blazoned: &quot;Gules, doubled argent&quot; (&quot;red lined with white&quot;)

==Symbolism==
A number of explanations of the symbolism of the Drapers&#x27; arms have been postulated.
The Company&#x27;s patron is the Virgin Mary, and each of the grants of arms is clear that this is to whom the triple crowns refer. Mary was deemed to be an empress and the symbol for an emperor/empress is a triple crown. An image of The Virgin Mary wearing the same tiara is in the margin of the Letters Patent granting the Arms to the Company. The Drapers were originally a religious fraternity associated with the Church of St Mary Bethlehem Church, Bishopsgate.

However, as the Pope has long used (until 1963) the &quot;Papal Tiara&quot; or triple crown, as a symbol of his temporal and spiritual power, the symbol used in the Drapers&#x27; arms may have become politically tainted at the time of the Reformation when England declared independence from papal authority. This may explain the clarifications which were required in the 16th and 17th century grants.

The symbolism is most likely to represent The Assumption of the Virgin; in the margins of the Letters Patent of the Grant, Mary is being crowned by angels. It has been suggested that the arms demonstrate that from Mary, through the Holy Spirit, comes the divine Son of God: thus the sunbeams represent the brilliance and light of the Virgin Mary, and the cloud which is a frequent symbol for the Holy Spirit. Another suggestion is that the crowned clouds are mistaken renderings of pyx-canopies, that is veils (as would be sold by drapers) hanging from pyxes.

The triple repetition of this main charge follows standard heraldic usage for charges of all kinds, but here also serves to emphasise the Trinity.

==Motto==
The motto is: &quot;Unto God only be Honour and Glory&quot;, from 1 Timothy 1:17.

<text>Yuri II (, also transcribed as &quot;Iuri&quot;), also known as George II of Vladimir or as Georgy II Vsevolodovich (26 November 11884 March 1238), was the fourth Grand Prince of Vladimir (1212–1216, 1218–1238) who presided over the Principality of Vladimir-Suzdal at the time of the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27;.

He was the seventh child and the third and best-loved son of Vsevolod III (Vsevolod the Big Nest) and of Maria Shvarnovna.

He first distinguished himself in the battles against Ryazan in 1208. His father wanted Yuri to inherit Rostov and his elder brother Konstantin to succeed him in Vladimir. The latter, however, declared that he would rule both towns or nothing at all. Thereupon Vsevolod disinherited Konstantin and passed the throne to Yuri, who received the largest portion of his possessions.

Before his death, grand prince Vsevolod divided his territories between his sons; as soon as he died in 1212, the Vladimir-Suzdal war of succession (1212–1216) broke out between them. Konstantin allied himself with Mstislav the Bold and defeated Yuri and his other brothers on the Lipitsa River. Having gained Vladimir, Konstantin sent Yuri to rule Rostov and Yaroslavl. Two years later Konstantin died, and Yuri was allowed to return to Vladimir.

During his reign in Vladimir, Yuri waged several wars against Volga Bulgaria and founded the fortress of Nizhny Novgorod on the Volga River to secure the area from Bulgarian attacks. He installed his younger brother Yaroslav in Novgorod. When the Mongols first approached Russia in 1223, he sent a small unit against them, but it arrived too late to take part in the disastrous Battle of the Kalka River in May 1223.

When the Mongols returned in 1237, Yuri treated their envoys with disdain. Likewise, he did not help Ryazan when Batu Khan laid siege to that city in December 1237. His own capital, however, was the next in line. Yuri&#x27;s sons were soundly defeated near Kolomna, and Yuri himself could barely escape to Yaroslavl. His wife Agatha (Mikhail of Kiev&#x27;s sister) and all his family died in Vladimir when the Assumption Cathedral where they had sought refuge from the fire collapsed in February 1238. Russian historians (, ) believe that this information was deliberately falsified. The purpose was to hide the fact that some members of the princely family were captured. The most likely was the capture of Agatha, her daughter Princess Theodora, or the young Princess Marina, the wife of Yuri&#x27;s son . (Princess Marina was not canonized in the Cathedral of the Vladimir Saints together with the rest of the who died in the Assumption Cathedral).

Yuri himself was killed on 4 March 1238, in the Battle of the Sit River, when vast Mongol hordes defeated the army of Vladimir-Suzdal. The relics of the prince are in the Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir.

<text>The Sussex Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run at Goodwood over a distance of 1 mile (1,609 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late July or early August.

==History==
The first version of the event, a 6-furlong race for two-year-olds, was established in 1841. It continued intermittently for thirty-seven years, but it was uncontested on twenty-five occasions including fourteen walkovers.

The Sussex Stakes became a 1-mile race for three-year-olds in 1878. The previous version had been overshadowed by both the Goodwood Cup and the Stewards&#x27; Cup, but in its modified form it became the most prestigious race at Goodwood.

The event was opened to four-year-olds in 1960, and to horses aged five or older in 1975.

The race is currently held on the second day of the five-day Glorious Goodwood meeting.

The Nassau Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to fillies and mares aged three years or older. It is run at Goodwood over a distance of 1 mile, 1 furlong and 197 yards (1,991 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late July or early August.

==History==
The title of the event acknowledges the friendship between the 5th Duke of Richmond, a former owner of Goodwood Racecourse, and the House of Orange-Nassau. The race was established in 1840, and it was originally restricted to three-year-old fillies. During the early part of its history it was contested over a distance of 1 mile. It was extended to 1½ miles in 1900, and shortened to its present length in 1911.

The Nassau Stakes was opened to fillies and mares aged four or older in 1975. For a period it was classed at Group 2 level, and it was promoted to Group 1 status in 1999.

The race is currently held on the third day of the five-day Glorious Goodwood meeting.

<doc id="727594" wikidata="Q192049" url="?curid=727594" title="Yun Po-sun">
<text>Yun Po-sun (, or ; August 26, 1897 – July 18, 1990) was a South Korean politician and activist who served as the second president of South Korea from 1960 to 1962. He was the only president of the short-lived Second Republic of Korea, and served as little more than a figurehead due to its nature as a parliamentary system.

Having entered politics after World War II, Yun served as Secretary to Korea&#x27;s Chief of Staff in 1947, and was Mayor of Seoul in 1948. He served as Commerce Minister for the newly liberated Korea from 1949 to 1950. In 1955, Yun helped establish the South Korean Democratic Party. He was forced to resign the presidency by Park Chung Hee as a result of the May 16 coup in 1961.

==Early life==
Yun Po-sun was born in Dunpo-myeon, Asan, South Chungcheong Province in 1897. He was a son of Yun Chi-so (윤치소, 尹致昭, 1871–1944) and Lady Yi Beom-suk (이범숙, 李範淑, 1876–1969). Yun Chiso is the second son of Yun Yeong-ryeol (윤영렬;尹英烈). Yun Yeong-ryeol is an 8th generation descendant of the prominent Joseon scholar-official Yun Doo-su (윤두수;尹斗壽). Yun studied in the United Kingdom, graduating with a Master of Arts from the University of Edinburgh in 1930. He returned to Korea in 1932.

==Political career==

Yun entered politics in 1945 following Gwangbokjeol (Liberation Day). The first Doctor of Philosophy from Princeton University in Korea, as well as first President of South Korea, Dr. Syngman Rhee, was his mentor. By 1947, Yun was serving as Secretary to the Korean Chief of Staff. In 1948, Rhee appointed Yun to the position of mayor of Seoul. A year later, he was made Minister of Commerce and Industry. However, Yun soon began to disagree with Rhee&#x27;s authoritarian policies.

While serving as president of the Red Cross Society, he was elected to the National Assembly in 1954. A year later, he co-founded the opposition South Korean Democratic Party. In 1959, he became a representative to the Supreme Council of the Democratic Party.

==Presidency (1960–62)==
Rhee&#x27;s government was ousted by a student-led, pro-democracy uprising in 1960; and Yun was elected president by the newly elected parliament on August 13, with Chang Myon as Prime Minister. In the aftermath of the authoritarian excesses of Rhee&#x27;s regime, South Korea had switched to a parliamentary system; thus, Yun served merely as a ceremonial president.

Following Park Chung Hee&#x27;s coup in 1961, Yun stayed in his post in order to provide some legitimacy to the new regime, but resigned on 22 March 1962. In the following years, Yun received suspended sentences several times for anti-government activities.

<text>The International Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run at York over a distance of 1 mile, 2 furlongs and 56 yards (2,063 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in August.

==History==
The event was devised by Major Leslie Petch, a former Clerk of the Course at York. It was first run in 1972, but by this time Petch had resigned from his position due to ill health. The race was originally sponsored by Benson and Hedges and called the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup. The inaugural running was won by Roberto, that year&#x27;s Derby winner. The second-placed horse was Brigadier Gerard – his only defeat in a career of eighteen races.

The sponsorship of Benson and Hedges continued until 1985, and for the following two years the event was backed by the bloodstock company Matchmaker. Its title during this period was the Matchmaker International. The present sponsor, Juddmonte Farms, started supporting the race in 1989. It is now familiarly known as the Juddmonte International.

The International Stakes is currently held on the opening day of York&#x27;s four-day Ebor Festival meeting. It is the venue&#x27;s richest race of the season and the 2024 renewal was rated the best horse race in the world that year.

The Yorkshire Oaks is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to fillies and mares aged three years or older. It is run at York over a distance of 1 mile 3 furlongs and 188 yards (2,385 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in August.

==History==
The event was established in 1849, and it was originally restricted to fillies aged three. The inaugural running was won by Ellen Middleton, owned by the 2nd Earl of Zetland.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the Yorkshire Oaks was subsequently classed at Group 1 level. It was opened to older fillies and mares in 1991.

The race has been sponsored by Darley Stud since 2006, and it is currently held on the second day of York&#x27;s four-day Ebor Festival meeting.

The Yorkshire Oaks often features horses which ran previously in The Oaks. The first to achieve victory in both races was Brown Duchess in 1861, and the most recent was Snowfall in 2021.

<text>|}




















The Nunthorpe Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged two years or older. It is run at York over a distance of 5 furlongs (1,006 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in August.

==History==
The event is named after Nunthorpe, an area of York. The first version, a low-grade selling race, was established in 1903. The present version began in 1922, and the inaugural running was won by Two Step.

The race was sponsored by William Hill from 1976 to 1989, and during this period it was known as the William Hill Sprint Championship. It has had several different sponsors since then, and the latest is Coolmore Stud, which started supporting the event in 2007.

The Nunthorpe Stakes became part of the Breeders&#x27; Cup Challenge series in 2011. The winner of the race now earns an automatic invitation to compete in the same year&#x27;s Breeders&#x27; Cup Turf Sprint.

The event is one of a limited number of races in which two-year-old horses can compete against their elders. The first juvenile to win was High Treason in 1953, and the most recent was Kingsgate Native in 2007. It is also the only Group 1 race in Great Britain open to two-year-old geldings.

The Nunthorpe Stakes is currently held on the third day of York&#x27;s four-day Ebor Festival meeting and has been a Group 1 race since 1984.
