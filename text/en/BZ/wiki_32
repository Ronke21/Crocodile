<text>The National Cryptologic Museum (NCM) is an American museum of cryptologic history that is affiliated with the National Security Agency (NSA). The first public museum in the U.S. Intelligence Community, NCM is located in the former Colony Seven Motel, just two blocks from the NSA headquarters at Fort George G. Meade in Maryland. The motel was purchased, creating a buffer zone between the high security main buildings of the NSA and an adjacent highway. The museum opened to the public on December 16, 1993, and now hosts about 50,000 visitors annually from all over the world.

The NCM is open Tuesday through Saturday, 10am–4pm (hours are extended Wednesdays to 7pm). It is closed on Sundays, Mondays, and all federal holidays, and operates on NSA&#x27;s emergency/weather closure schedule (i.e. if NSA is closed, the museum is closed as well). The NCM includes a gift store whose operational hours coordinate with the museum&#x27;s operational schedule (i.e., if the museum is closed altogether, opens late, or closes early, the gift shop does likewise) and an unclassified library with weekday-only operating hours that also represent the museum&#x27;s weekday operational schedule. The library includes over a dozen boxes of the files of Herbert Yardley, declassified Enigma messages, technical reports, and books including how to crack the Data Encryption Standard using Deep Crack.

The National Vigilance Park (NVP) was next to the museum, where three reconnaissance aircraft were displayed. A U.S. Army Beechcraft RU-8D Seminole reconnaissance plane represents the Army Airborne Signals Intelligence contribution in the Vietnam War. A Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport, modified to look like a reconnaissance-configured C-130A, memorialized a U.S. Air Force aircraft shot down over Soviet Armenia during the Cold War. Finally, the park also contained a U.S. Navy Douglas EA-3B Skywarrior, commemorating a mission in the Mediterranean on January 25, 1987, in which all seven crew members died.

The NCM is open to the public, and admission is free. Donations to the NCM Foundation are accepted. Photography is allowed inside the museum but flash photography is prohibited due to the age of some of the artifacts. The museum temporarily closed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Later in 2020, new museum director Vince Houghton used the opportunity to have the museum renovated. It reopened on October 8, 2022.

==Collections==

The NCM collection contains thousands of artifacts, including numerous working World War II German Enigma machines (two of them are available for visitors to try out), and a Navy Bombe used to break it. Displays discuss the history of American cryptology and the people, machines, techniques, and locations concerned. Initially housing NSA artifacts for viewing by employees, the museum quickly developed into a collection of U.S. cryptologic history, with some artifacts dating back to pre-American Revolutionary War times.

In addition to exhibits covering equipment used to encrypt, decrypt, and secure information, the museum features exhibits on the people who contributed to cryptography in America, such as George Washington (who integrated military intelligence tactics, including coded messaging, into the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War), the Native American code talkers (who protected U.S. communications during both World Wars by using their native languages to encode message traffic), and the Navy WAVES (who, like the WRENS of the British Royal Navy, operated the Bombe to decrypt German military traffic during WWII).

Collections are divided into four major groupings:

* Early Cryptology, which deals with cryptologic history prior to the formation of NSA, with exhibits dating back to the 16th century (the Renaissance-era book &quot;Polygraphiae&quot;) forward to the early 1950s, focusing on artifacts from the Founding Fathers of the United States, the American Civil War, the United States Army Code talkers, World War I, and World War II.
* Cold War/Information Age, which deals with cryptology and cryptanalysis on both sides of the Cold War, the early years of NSA, and the rise of the modern age of computers, including the development of supercomputers
* Information Assurance, which deals with the rise of satellite technology, secure voice communications, tamper-evident technologies, nuclear command and control, and cyberdefense.
* Memorial Hall, one side of which features the NSA Hall of Honor, and the other side of which features exhibits honoring those who lost their lives in cryptologic missions represented by the aircraft at NVP as well as others who lost their lives in cryptologic service to America (USS &quot;Pueblo&quot;, USS &quot;Liberty&quot;, and a replica of NSA&#x27;s National Cryptologic Memorial)

In addition, there are galleries throughout NCM focusing on the roles of women and African-Americans in cryptologic history, and the variety of languages in use throughout the world.

The NCM includes an unclassified library of books, papers, and other materials relating to the history of cryptography and cryptology as well. The library is open on days when the museum is open. The library is non-circulating (that is, material cannot be borrowed or checked out by the public), but photocopying and photography are allowed. Patrons needing extensive or rare materials for research are encouraged to contact the museum to schedule an appointment with the librarian.

The size of NCM&#x27;s library nearly doubled with the donation of an extensive collection of papers, books, and other artifacts related to codes and ciphers from cryptologic historian and author David Kahn. The donation was formally dedicated by the NCM during a recognition ceremony for Dr. Kahn on October 26, 2010.

==Activities==
The museum offers tours for members of the public, both scheduled and walk-in, that describe cryptology&#x27;s impact on history and jobs in the field. Tours are led by docents who are retired NSA employees. Groups of six persons or more are requested to contact the museum in advance to schedule tours and ensure docent availability.

In addition, the NCM offers educational field trips, tours, talks, and interactive programs for students aged from 9, as well as programs for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of all ages to satisfy various pins, requirements, and electives. Interested educators, scoutmasters, and troop leaders are encouraged to contact the museum for more details.

The NCM was the site of the 2010 activation ceremony for Marine Corps Forces, Cyberspace Command. The ceremony was attended by former CMC General Alfred M. Gray, Jr.
==NSA Hall of Honor==

The NSA Hall of Honor is a memorial honoring individuals with distinguished service to American cryptology. Created in 1999, the standards are high for induction; honored individuals were innovators over their entire careers, whose expertise in various NSA subject matters far surpassed any of their peers, or who made major contributions to the structure and processes of American cryptology.

<text>John Horne Blackmore (March 27, 1890 – May 2, 1971) was a Canadian school teacher and principal and Canadian politician. He was one of the first elected members and leaders of the Social Credit Party of Canada, a political party in Canada that promoted the social credit theories of monetary reform.

==Life and career==
Born in Sublett, Idaho, he immigrated to the Cardston area as a child. He was brought up in a Mormon household.

He attended Calgary Normal School and the University of Alberta.

Blackmore was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1935 election as Member of Parliament representing Lethbridge, Alberta. The Social Credit movement had swept to power in Alberta in the 1935 provincial election just weeks earlier. He was chosen the party&#x27;s parliamentary leader, since its most famous spokesperson, William Aberhart, had just become the premier of Alberta.

He published &quot;Money the Master Key&quot;, a book based on his speeches, in 1939. The book describes &quot;Money Power,&quot; &quot;the Designing Will that pulls hidden strings.&quot;

In 1939, Social Credit merged into William Herridge&#x27;s New Democracy movement, with Herridge acknowledged as the new party&#x27;s leader. However, Herridge himself failed to win a seat in the 1940 federal election. In the subsequent 19th Canadian Parliament, Blackmore acted as leader of the elected New Democracy MPs, all Social Crediters.

Blackmore served as party leader until 1944, when Social Credit held its first national convention and acclaimed as leader Solon Earl Low, the provincial treasurer of Alberta at the time. Blackmore retained his Lethbridge seat until he was defeated in the 1958 election in which Social Credit lost all of its MPs. (The Progressive Conservatives won all seventeen Alberta seats although they got less than 60 percent of the votes cast in Alberta.)

Blackmore was the first Mormon to be elected to the Canadian House of Commons.

He was excommunicated in 1947 for &quot;teaching and advocating the doctrine of plural marriage&quot; at secret meetings in Southern Alberta. At such meetings, men debated whether Mormon leaders were wrong to have renounced Joseph Smith&#x27;s revelation regarding polygamy. Though not a polygamist himself, Blackmore urged Parliament to repeal the anti-polygamy law and succeeded in removing specific references to Mormons in the law. His nephew, Winston Blackmore, is the leader of Canada&#x27;s largest polygamist group and was charged by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with polygamy in 2009. He challenged the law&#x27;s constitutionality.

Blackmore was criticized for his views on Jews, and the &quot;Encyclopaedia Judaica&quot; said he &quot;frequently gave public aid and comfort to anti-Semitism.&quot; In 1953, it was reported that Blackmore was distributing the anti-Semitic &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; from his parliamentary office. However, in a speech he made in the House of Commons on January 31, 1944 (see Hansard records) he advocated for the establishment of “a national homeland for the Jews” in Palestine.

In his last interview in 2009, Arch MacKenzie, a longtime Parliament Hill reporter and Canadian Press bureau chief described Blackmore as the worst Member of Parliament he ever observed in his long career.

Blackmore is a relative of the author Flora Jessop and her sister, Ruby Jessop.

<text>Skids (Sally Blevins) is a mutant character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Louise Simonson and Jackson Guice, the character debuted in &quot;X-Factor&quot; (Vol. 1) #7 (May 1986). Skids has a personal frictionless forcefield which she can project onto herself and other objects.

Skids was initially a ward of X-Factor, progressing to the X-Terminators and New Mutants. She would then join the villainous groups, Mutant Liberation Front and Acolytes, before defecting back to heroics with X-Corporation and S.H.I.E.L.D.

==Publication history==

Created by writer Louise Simonson and artist Jackson Guice, Skids first appeared in &quot;X-Factor&quot; #7 (August 1986), first as one of the sewer-dwelling Morlocks and then as a young ward of X-Factor. She remained as a supporting character through &quot;X-Factor&quot; #33, but during the events of Inferno, she formed the X-Terminators along with peers Boom-Boom, Rusty Collins, and Rictor, as well as younger mutant children Artie Maddicks, Leech, and Wiz Kid, in &quot;X-Terminators&quot; #1-4 (1988). After &quot;Inferno&quot;, Skids (along with the older three X-Terminators) joined the remaining members of the New Mutants in &quot;New Mutants&quot; vol. 1 #76, but leaves the title as a regular after joining the Mutant Liberation Front with Rusty in &quot;New Mutants&quot; vol. 1 #87 (1990). Skids would then leave regular publication but appear semi-regularly as an antagonist to the X-Men and X-Force, originally with the MLF in &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #13-15 (1992) and &quot;X-Force&quot; #24 (1993), but later with the Acolytes: &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #25 (1993), &quot;Cable&quot; #10-11 (1994); &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #315 (1994), and &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #42-44 (1995). Subsequently, Skids left the Acolytes and appeared infrequently in publication, only in isolated stories: as a college student trying to rebuild her life in &quot;X-Force&quot; #78-80, 85 (1998–99), as a member of the X-Corporation in &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; #42-46 (2004), as one of The 198 in &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #183-184 (2006), as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent infiltrating the Morlocks in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #487-491 (2007), and most recently, still with S.H.I.E.L.D. in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #101-104 (2018).

==Fictional character biography==
===Morlocks===
Little has been revealed of Sally Blevins&#x27; past. As a teenager, when she was abused by her stepfather, her mother Matilda was fatally injured in the altercation, and her stepfather fled when her mutant power subsequently manifested to protect her. Sally ended up a runaway, living on, or rather under, the streets with the Morlocks, a group of homeless mutants. Most Morlocks voluntarily (or, in some cases, involuntarily) took on inhuman appearances at the hands of the Morlock facial sculptor, Masque. Sally&#x27;s force field protected her from Masque&#x27;s power, allowing her to maintain her normal appearance, leading to resentment from some Morlocks. At one point, Skids encountered Rusty Collins, while he was being pursued by Freedom Force (government-chartered mutant enforcers composed of former members of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants) and a mob of mutant-hating humans. Rusty had accidentally injured a woman with his pyrokinetic powers and was wanted by the U.S Government. Skids&#x27; force field allowed the two to easily escape, but were eventually overtaken by Freedom Force on the edge of Central Park.

Before the evil mutants could take them in, a mob of humans attacked Freedom Force. In the confusion, Skids and Rusty escaped. Skids tried to get Rusty to the safety of the underground home of the Morlocks, but Freedom Force caught up with them again, this time in the sewers beneath New York. The Force member Blob was pounding Rusty into the sewer wall when the mutant hero team X-Factor arrived. After a brief skirmish, Freedom Force retreated and Skids and Rusty were left in X-Factor&#x27;s hands.

===X-Factor, X-Terminators, and New Mutants===
With X-Factor&#x27;s mentorship, Skids and Rusty began to learn more about their powers, and were the first of several X-Factor trainees. They shared other adventures alongside the rest of X-Factor&#x27;s trainees, at one point calling themselves the X-Terminators.

During the Inferno storyline, the X-Terminators teamed up with the New Mutants to help rescue mutant babies from the demon N&#x27;astirh, who was using them to help keep open a portal to Limbo. Skids aided the New Mutants and Namor the Sub-Mariner against an undersea monster. At the conclusion of Inferno, Skids joined the New Mutants, along with Rusty, Rictor and Boom Boom. Skids and Rusty learned that Freedom Force were taking mutant infants that were abducted during the demonic invasion into government custody for exploitation. Rusty and Skids were separated from the group for some time. Freedom Force surrounded them at the Statue of Liberty island. Skids&#x27; force field blocks their attacks but they simply wait until pure exhaustion drops her. Rusty&#x27;s flames are neutralized by the Freedom Force member Pyro, who can control any flames generated by another source. The pair was captured by Freedom Force.

The other New Mutants were unable to rescue their friends due to their concurrent adventures. Rusty and Skids escaped from their prison cells to stop the criminals Nitro and Vulture. They escaped the federal prison and defeated Nitro, but thanks to the fight Rusty was brought back into the sights of Freedom Force. While attempting to escape, he was severely injured by the Blob and they were recaptured by Freedom Force. While recovering in the hospital, he and Skids were contacted by members of the Mutant Liberation Front. With soldiers opening fire on them, they felt there was no other choice than to join them.

===The Mutant Liberation Front===
Shortly thereafter, Rusty and Skids were brainwashed by Stryfe into following him blindly. Due to this, Rusty and Skids had no qualms about attacking former teammate Cannonball during the X-Cutioner&#x27;s Song storyline. At the end of this story, the Mutant Liberation Front were turned in to the authorities.

Shortly after, Rusty and Skids were kidnapped by the Friends of Humanity. While being transported, X-Force (the team created by the former members of the New Mutants), rescued them. Arriving back at their base, X-Force was soon confronted by Exodus. He was inviting original New Mutants Cannonball and Sunspot to Avalon, a &quot;safe haven&quot; for selected mutants. Cannonball refused to go unless all former New Mutants present (Boom Boom, Rictor, Rusty and Skids) were invited also. While Exodus complained that Rusty and Skids were &quot;damaged&quot; due to their brainwashing, he finally acquiesced.

===Avalon===
Upon arriving at Avalon, the mutants were taken to &quot;the Savior&quot; (in reality Magneto), who used his powers to undo the brainwashing done to Rusty and Skids. When X-Force arrived to save their friends, Rusty and Skids decided they would stay with Magneto, feeling that they owed him. With thus being done, they joined the Acolytes.

Shortly after the Age of Apocalypse storyline, a mutant body (Holocaust) was discovered floating in space near Avalon. It was brought on board. While on guard duty watching over the thought-to-be frozen body, Rusty&#x27;s life force was drained by Holocaust, killing him. Holocaust then destroyed the Avalon space station leaving Skids stranded on a piece of debris plummeting away from the station, struggling to maintain her force field. Skids was rescued by Jean Grey and taken to the X-Men&#x27;s mansion for medical attention.

===College===
Skids had become a college student, studying biological sciences. She was contacted by her friends in X-Force who were on a cross-country road trip, but they were all attacked by the villain Reignfire, who was then leading an incarnation of the Mutant Liberation Front. During the encounter, Skids&#x27; force field disrupted the teleportation abilities of MLF member Locus, causing both of them to be caught in a trans-spatial backlash which deposited them in the Balkan country of Latveria. Skids and Locus were then captured by an age-old sorceress named Pandemonia, the self-styled Queen of Chaos, who sought to recruit mutants into her own personal army, but Skids and X-Force defeated her with the assistance of the young sorceress Jennifer Kale.

===X-Corporation===
Despite her decision to remove herself from mutant-related activity and superheroism, Skids was nonetheless eventually recruited by former New Mutant teammate Sunspot, now a leader of the Los Angeles branch of the X-Corporation (a worldwide network supporting mutant causes), to join his cause. This faction assisted the X-Treme X-Men after the villain Elias Bogan took mental possession of some of their members. Skids was defeated in battle by the possessed Bishop, who attached a generator to her which caused her spin rapidly on the surface of her own slippery force field. Eventually, though, the remaining heroes defeated Bogan.

Shortly afterwards, X-Men founder Charles Xavier (who also founded the X-Corps initially) had the network disbanded when he decided the world had become too dangerous for mutants in the public sector, and Skids presumably returned to a civilian life.

===M-Day and Apocalypse===
When the reality warping-mutant the Scarlet Witch used her powers to negate the abilities of most of the world&#x27;s mutants&#x27; superhuman abilities (an event subsequently referred to as M-Day), Skids found herself surprised and possibly even disappointed to learn that she retained her own powers. In the anti-mutant aftermath that followed, Skids wound up being one of several remaining mutants seeking refuge on Xavier&#x27;s estate, sharing a tent with the mutants Magma and Outlaw. During this time, the ancient X-Men nemesis Apocalypse attacked the estate with his loyal Horsemen. The Horseman Famine sapped the energies of the camping refugees, forcing them to crave sustenance of any kind. When Apocalypse offered his empowered blood to them, it was all that the heroes could do to keep Skids and other desperate mutants from accepting the evil substance. Despite this near-betrayal, Xavier forgave Skids and the others and allowed them to remain on the grounds. Skids eventually departed the camp and was not heard of again for some time.

===S.H.I.E.L.D.===
Skids becomes an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and is assigned to pose as an operative of Masque&#x27;s splinter group of Morlocks, who attempt to carry out the designs of the late Morlock precognitive Qwerty. Simultaneously, she is assigned to infiltrate Masque&#x27;s Morlock rivals, a more pacifistic sect that were nonetheless equally devoted to Qwerty and her book of prophecies. This sect made the underground sanctuary Lindisfarne their home base, which housed their sacred text of Qwerty&#x27;s scripture. In both roles, Skids apparently feigned equal devotion to Qwerty&#x27;s prophecies.

Appearing as a reluctant and listless (and possibly alcoholic) recruit of Masque&#x27;s faction, she purposefully took part in Masque&#x27;s plan to disfigure humans by bombing a subway train with a gene-altering chemical weapon. Her deep cover prevented her from interfering when Masque went on to deform them with his powers. She also did nothing to stop Masque and his cohort Bliss when they decided to abduct and torture Leech, her former friend from when they were X-Factor trainees. The X-Men Storm, Warpath, Hepzibah and ex-Morlock Caliban go after Masque in the tunnels, and find Skids unconscious after she was caught in the crossfire of an attempted raid on Masque&#x27;s crew by other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. They wonder why she is there, and while Caliban defends her character, Storm questions her loyalty due to her complicated history with the X-Men. When a S.H.I.E.L.D. Sentinel attacks the X-Men, thinking them to be Masque loyalists, Skids recovers and takes charge of the investigation. She then fills the X-Men in on her assignment and Qwerty&#x27;s prophecies, and leads them to Lindisfarne and introduces them to Qwerty&#x27;s friend and priestess Delphi.

Later, Skids and the X-Men are captured by Masque&#x27;s crew. Masque wants to initiate a war between humans and remaining mutants via a devastating terrorist attack, and leave his captives&#x27; corpses at the scene to further de-legitimize Xavier&#x27;s vision. The captives escape, and while the X-Men defeat Masque, Skids leaves the scene with Qwerty&#x27;s book.

Skids found Magneto at a local cemetery and gave him the book, informing him that she would get into a lot of trouble if her actions were discovered. She stated that the book said Magneto was still a mutant.

==Powers and abilities ==
Sally Blevins is a mutant with power over a semipermeable personal protective deflection field. It provides nearly total protection from all attacks except those of insufficient force, like gas. Her force field disperses energy assaults, reflects kinetic impact off itself, and negates friction making it impossible to hold on to her. Skids cannot be grabbed or entangled when using her powers. This also makes her immune to Masque&#x27;s powers, as he cannot touch her. Skids can move at speeds which are faster than running, by &quot;skating&quot; the surface of her force field across other surfaces.

Originally, Sally was unable to turn off her force field but learned with practice. By concentrating, she can extend her force field to protect others in her immediate area, at least up to .

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In 10th anniversary of the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;, Skids made a brief appearance. Like many other mutants not deemed worthy enough to serve Apocalypse, Skids&#x27; was one of many inmates in the Breeding Pens that escaped after the fall of Apocalypse. She along with a trail of escaped mutants took residence in the sewers and created once again the Morlocks society. They did not trust any outsiders, not even the X-Men, now mutant hunting officers of the newly restored human government, when they ventured into Morlock territory, inviting them to come and live with them in the surface world. The Morlocks lashed out at them for fear of being locked up and thrown back into cages by them. Due to the experiments she was put through in the Breeding Pens, Skids&#x27; powers have been mastered to such a point that she could shield herself and several others from Storm&#x27;s lightning bolts. Nonetheless, the X-Men would emerge victorious and the Morlocks were brought back to the Xavier Institute where they were detained. Their fates after being remanded into government custody is unknown.

===What If===
In the reality shown in &quot;What if&quot; (vol. 2) #85, Xavier and Magneto set their differences aside peacefully, and Avalon was left undisturbed in Earth’s orbit. However, Magneto’s dream of a peaceful haven for mutants did not come true, for no more than ten years later, his Acolytes were at each other&#x27;s throats. Some of them wanted to move Avalon to another galaxy, thinking that they were still too close to humanity’s influence, whereas the others believed that they should kill humanity and conquer Earth for themselves. Rusty and Skids stayed away from either side and the constant fights, them being busier with themselves, as they were expecting a child. Hank McCoy helped to deliver Avalon’s first baby, and examining the boy, he found something special in his genetic make-up. Apparently the son of Sally and Rusty, Sean Collins, was the next step in human evolution – Homo ultima – capable of choosing and altering his mutation at maturity. As the word spread, the different Acolyte factions put their differences aside, and feeling threatened by the arrival of a new race, they teamed up to attract Rusty and Skids and kill their baby. With Sean dead, Sally and Rusty turned their back on the Acolytes and returned to Earth. The boy was a normal mutant; Magneto had faked the test results, well aware that his Acolytes needed a common enemy to unite against.

==In other media==

Skids made a non-speaking appearance in the &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;No Mutant is an Island&quot; as a mutant recruited by the Purple Man.

<text>John Batman (21 January 18016 May 1839) was an Australian grazier, entrepreneur and explorer, who had a prominent role in the founding of Melbourne. He also was involved in many attacks against Indigenous Australians.

Born and raised in the then-British colony of New South Wales, Batman settled in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (modern-day Tasmania) in the 1820s, where he rose to prominence for hunting bushrangers and leading massacres of Aboriginal people in the Black War.

He later co-founded the Port Phillip Association and led an expedition which explored the Port Phillip area on the Australian mainland with the goal of establishing a new settlement. In 1835, Batman negotiated a treaty with Aboriginal people in Port Phillip by offering them tools, blankets and food in exchange for thousands of hectares of land. However, the treaty was declared void by the government and it has been disputed by Aboriginal descendants. This expedition ultimately resulted in the founding of Melbourne, eventual capital of Victoria and one of Australia&#x27;s largest and most important cities. Batman moved to the colony with his convict wife, Elizabeth Callaghan, and their seven daughters, settling on what is now known as Batman&#x27;s Hill. He died of syphilis shortly afterwards at the age of 38.

Batman&#x27;s treaty stands as the only attempt by a European to engage Australian Aboriginal people in a treaty or transaction rather than simply claiming land outright. However, Batman&#x27;s motives and the validity of the treaty remain of great historical interest and debate.

==Early life==
John Batman was born on 21 January 1801 in Parramatta, Colony of New South Wales. His parents, William and Mary Bat(e)man, arrived at Sydney aboard &quot;Ganges&quot; on 2 June 1797. William was sentenced to fourteen years&#x27; transportation the previous year for receiving stolen saltpetre, while his wife paid her fare to accompany him, bringing along their children Maria and Robert.

William obtained his ticket of leave and started a timber-yard at Parramatta, where his five sons and daughter were raised. His sentence expired in 1810 and William later became a devout Wesleyan; his children were trained as Anglican-Methodists. As Aboriginals were encouraged to come into Parramatta for charity and education, John knew many Aboriginals. John was apprenticed as a blacksmith in Sydney in 1816.

== Move to Tasmania ==
In December 1821, John and his younger brother Henry journeyed to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now known as Tasmania) to settle on land in the north-east, near Ben Lomond, to become a grazier. He acquired &quot;Kingston&quot;, a property said to be &quot;...large in acreage and poor agriculturally...&quot;.

In early 1826 Batman captured the bushranger Matthew Brady, resulting in an additional grant of land by the government.
Brady had been wounded in the leg in a conflict with the authorities, but got away safely. Batman went out unarmed on his own in search of Brady, and found him quite accidentally. He saw a man limping in the bush near a shallow creek, and hastened forward to him. It was Brady. He induced Brady to surrender and return with him. The outlaw was ill and suffering much pain, and did as he was asked. Brady was duly handed over to authorities at Launceston Gaol and later sentenced to death. He was hanged at Hobart.

== Participation in massacres of Aboriginal people and the Black War ==
Batman participated in the many killings of Tasmanian Aboriginal people while in Tasmania. Many such killings are well documented in the Tasmanian State archives and Victorian State library records.

Batman participated in the capture of some Aboriginal people in 1829. He employed mainland Aboriginal people hired in Sydney, New South Wales, for &#x27;roving parties&#x27; hunting Tasmanian Aboriginal peoples. Between 1828 and 1830 Aboriginal people in this region were shot or rounded up by bounty hunters like Batman.

As Tasmanian Colonial Governor, George Arthur, observed, Batman &quot;...had much slaughter to account for&quot;. Closer examination of this quote from Governor Arthur reveals a more complex picture of Batman&#x27;s motives and actions on behalf of the government in these so-called &quot;roving parties&quot;. For example, in September 1829 Batman (aged 28), with the assistance of several &quot;Sydney blacks&quot; he brought to Tasmania, led an attack on an Aboriginal family group together numbering 60 to 70 men, women and children in the Ben Lomond district of north-east Tasmania. Waiting until 11pm that night before attacking, he &quot;...ordered the men to fire upon them...&quot; as their 40-odd dogs raised the alarm and the Aboriginal people ran away into thick scrub. In his report of the incident to the police magistrate at Oatlands, Batman estimated that they killed 15 Aboriginal people. The next morning, he left the place for his farm, with two badly wounded Tasmanian men, a woman and her two-year-old boy, all of whom he captured. However, he &quot;...found it impossible that the two former [the men] could walk, and after trying them by every means in my power, for some time, found I could not get them on I was obliged to shoot them.&quot; The captured woman, named Luggenemenener, was later sent to Campbell Town gaol and separated from her two-year-old son, Rolepana, &quot;...whom she had faced death to protect.&quot; Batman reported afterwards to British Colonial Secretary, John Burnett, in a letter of 7 September 1829, that he kept the child because he wanted &quot;...to rear it...&quot;. Luggenemenener died on 21 March 1837 as an inmate at the Flinders Island settlement.

Later, Rolepana (aged 8 years), traveled with him as part of the founding party of Melbourne in 1835. After Batman&#x27;s death in 1839, Rolepana would have been 12 years old. Boyce notes that Rolepana was employed by colonist George Ware at 12 pounds a year with board on Batman&#x27;s death, &quot;...but what became of him after this is also unknown.&quot; However, Haebich records Rolepana as having died in Melbourne in 1842 (he would have been about 15 years). She also says that:

:Batman openly defied Governor Arthur and [George Augustus] Robinson by refusing to hand over two Aboriginal boys in his employ: Rolepana (or Benny Ben Lomond) and Lurnerminer (John or Jack Allen), captured by Batman in 1828. He claimed the boys were there with the consent of their parents...He also demonstrated a strong proprietorial interest in the boys, when he told Robinson they were &#x27;as much his property as his farm and that he had as much right to keep them as the government&#x27;. Indeed Batman was convinced that the best plan was to leave the children with the colonists, who clothed and fed them at no expense to the government and raised them to become &#x27;useful members of society&#x27;. In a series of letters to Governor Arthur, he &#x27;pleaded hard for the retention of youths educated by settlers and devoted to their service&#x27;.

Batman rose to prominence during the time of the Black War of 1830 (aged 29), during which he participated in the Black Line—the formation of a &quot;human chain&quot; across the island to drive Aboriginal people from their lands into a &#x27;manageable&#x27; area.

In February 1830, Batman wrote to the British Colonial Secretary, John Burnett, about his difficulty in &#x27;coming up&#x27; with [i.e., capturing] the Aboriginal people. In the same letter, he asked in explaining his difficulty in capturing Aboriginal people in the bush, &quot;...if he could follow known [Aboriginal] offenders once they had made it &#x27;to their own ground&#x27;.

The 19th-century artist, John Glover, captioned one of his Tasmanian paintings &quot;Batman&#x27;s Lookout, Benn Lomond&quot; (c. 1840) &quot;...on account of Mr Batman frequenting this spot to entrap the Natives.&quot; Batman&#x27;s neighbour in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, Glover said that he was &quot;a rogue, thief, cheat and liar, a murderer of blacks and the vilest man I have ever known&quot;.

Batman was diagnosed with syphilis in 1833.

By 1835, Batman&#x27;s property, &quot;...Kingston [near Ben Lomond], covered more than , had appropriate animals and buildings, and numerous hands; but it was too rugged to be highly productive.&quot;

== Foundation of Melbourne and Batman&#x27;s Treaty ==
Batman sought land grants in the Western Port area, but the New South Wales colonial authorities rejected this. So, in 1835, as a leading member of the Port Phillip Association he sailed for the mainland in the schooner &quot;Rebecca&quot; and explored much of Port Phillip.

When he found the current site of central Melbourne, he noted in his diary of 8 June 1835, &quot;This will be the place for a village.&quot; and declared the land &quot;Batmania&quot;.
Batman&#x27;s Treaty negotiations with Kulin peoples (Aboriginal peoples of now central Victoria) took place in June 1835 on the banks of the Merri Creek in present-day Northcote (an inner suburb of Melbourne), &quot;...using legal advice from the former Van Diemen&#x27;s Land attorney-general, Joseph Gellibrand, and with the support of his &quot;Sydney Blacks&quot;, which were his Aboriginal employees from New South Wales and Van Diemen&#x27;s Land.&quot; These Aboriginal men, namely John Pigeon (&quot;Warroba&quot;), Johnny Crook (&quot;Jonninbia&quot; or &quot;Yunbai&quot;), Joe the Marine (&quot;Quanmurrer&quot;), Stewart (&quot;Nillang&quot;), Mackey (&quot;Macher&quot;), John Allen (&quot;Lurnerminer&quot;), Bill Bullets, Old Bull, and Joe Bangett, performed a central role in the cross-cultural negotiations and the maintenance of these relations.
However, Batman did not visit the colonial camp that was later set up on the Yarra River (i.e., Melbourne) until November 1835. Debate has continued for more than a century over this moment in the birth of Melbourne. Batman writes in his diary on Monday, 8 June 1835 that &quot;... the boat went up the river I have spoken of, which comes from the east, and I am glad to state, about six miles up found the river all good water and very deep. This will be the place for a village. The natives on shore.&quot; The previous day Batman and his party had returned from their meeting with the Kulin Elders along the hills bordering the northern banks of the Yarra. It remains quite unclear whether the party saw the &#x27;place for a village&#x27; by the &#x27;Falls&#x27;—a long-used homesite for the local peoples, and similarly unclear whether Batman was in the boat that explored the Yarra on the 8th. But the site has already been noted for its virtues by numerous Britons including John Helder Wedge and Batman&#x27;s Parramatta friend Hamilton Hume.&quot;

Batman negotiated a treaty (now known as Batman&#x27;s Treaty but also known as the Dutigulla Treaty, Dutigulla Deed, Melbourne Treaty or Melbourne Deed), with Kulin peoples to rent their land on an annual basis for 40 blankets, 30 axes, 100 knives, 50 scissors, 30 mirrors, 200 handkerchiefs, 100 pounds of flour and 6 shirts. It is unlikely that Kulin people would have understood this as a transfer of land or agreed to it if they had, but, as Percival Serle wrote, &quot;No doubt the blankets, knives, tomahawks, etc., that he gave them were very welcome&quot;. In any case, Governor Bourke deemed such a treaty invalid, as the land was claimed by the Crown, rather than the Kulin people, and other colonists including the rival party of John Pascoe Fawkner arrived to settle Melbourne.

== Later life ==
Batman and his family settled at what became known as Batman&#x27;s Hill at the western end of Collins Street. Having sold his property &quot;Kingston&quot; in Tasmania and brought his wife, former convict Elizabeth Callaghan, and their seven daughters to Melbourne, he built a house at the base of the hill in April 1836. His son, John, was born in November 1837.
However, Batman&#x27;s health quickly declined after 1835 as syphilis had disfigured and crippled him, leaving him in constant pain. By the end of 1837 he was unable to walk and was forced to give up squatting and move into trading and investment, but he greatly overstretched his finances and was left vulnerable by his reliance on delegating work to others. As the disease eroded his nose, forcing him to wear a bandage to conceal his ruined face, he became estranged from his wife. In his last months of his life Batman was cared for by his Aboriginal servants, who carried him around in a wicker perambulator.

Following Batman&#x27;s death on 6 May 1839 his widow and family moved from the house at Batman&#x27;s Hill and the house was requisitioned by the government for administrative offices. Batman&#x27;s will, made in 1837, was out of date at his death as many of the assets bequeathed to his children had already been sold. Years of legal wrangling followed his death, led by Eliza Batman, who had remarried in 1841 to Batman&#x27;s former clerk, William Willoughby, and had only been left £5 in the will by her embittered first husband. The case dragged on, even after Batman&#x27;s heir-at-law, his son John, drowned in the Yarra River in 1845, and its costs absorbed what was left of Batman&#x27;s estate.

==Legacy==

Batman was buried in the Old Melbourne Cemetery but was exhumed and re-buried in the Fawkner Cemetery, a cemetery named after his fellow colonist (and rival), John Pascoe Fawkner. A bluestone obelisk was constructed in 1922 which was later moved to Batman Avenue before being returned to the Queen Victoria Market site in 1992. The obelisk is inscribed with the Latin &quot;circumspice&quot; meaning &quot;look around&quot;, the entire city of Melbourne being his legacy. The obelisk also states that Melbourne was &quot;unoccupied&quot; prior to John Batman&#x27;s arrival in 1835.

Australian sprinter Daniel Batman claimed to be a direct descendant of John Batman, although this claim is dubious, given that Batman&#x27;s only son, John Charles Batman, died aged just 8 or 9 years old by drowning in at Yarra Falls on 11 January 1845.

=== Controversy over massacres ===
Despite his responsibility for many Aboriginal deaths, Batman is widely considered to have been sympathetic towards Aboriginal people. Batman&#x27;s legacy has been challenged in the 21st century, and most criticism has focused on his killings of Indigenous people in Tasmania. In 2016, Darebin Council voted unanimously to change the name of Batman Park in Northcote. It is now called Gumbri Park, after Gumbri (Jessie Hunter), great-niece of Wurundjeri leader William Barak and the last girl born on the Coranderrk Aboriginal Reserve in Healesville.

In 2017, artist Ben Quilty called for Batman&#x27;s statue to be removed from the Melbourne CBD, describing him as a mass murderer who &quot;makes the American Confederates look friendly&quot; and adding that &quot;changing the inscription [on his statue] to &#x27;mass murderer&#x27; might slightly appease my sense of justice.&quot;

The Victorian electoral Division of Batman was abolished in 2018 and renamed the Division of Cooper after Aboriginal political activist William Cooper.

<doc id="734313" wikidata="Q4765583" url="?curid=734313" title="Anita McNaught">
<text>Anita McNaught (born 1965) is a British journalist, television correspondent and former presenter, based in Istanbul in Turkey. Previously, she worked for Al Jazeera English for 5½ years, as a roving Middle East correspondent.

McNaught has worked as a reporter for Television New Zealand (TVNZ), BBC TV and Radio, CNN, Fox News and Al Jazeera English. She was also a regular contributor on Radio New Zealand and, in print journalism, wrote for &quot;The Times&quot;, in the UK.

==Career==
At the age of 22 - after working for a couple of years in print - McNaught joined TVNZ as a producer and then reporter. She went on to become a popular anchor, reporter and interviewer for a number of news and current affairs programmes. In 1995, she moved to the competitor channel TV3 where she was one of the high-profile team of investigative journalists on the current affairs programme &quot;20/20&quot;.
Upon her return to the United Kingdom in 1997, she joined the BBC as a freelance journalist, presenting various programmes on BBC World News such as The World Today and Asia Today, as well as reporting for general news bulletins, until 2004. During her time in the country, she presented BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Open Minds&quot; arts and culture series in 1999, as well as Channel 4 television&#x27;s miscarriage of justice series &quot;Clear My Name&quot; in 1998. Between 2000 and 2003, she also wrote features for The Times newspaper, and was a reporter on several longer foreign features for the BBC series &#x27;Assignment&#x27; and BBC Radio 5 Live&#x27;s &quot;5 Live Report&quot;.

After leaving BBC World, she continued to work on a freelance basis for other BBC departments.

Throughout the years 1997–2006, she continued to report occasionally for both NZ&#x27;s TV3 and TVNZ. She covered the death of Princess Diana for TV3, and for TVNZ the death of the Pope from Poland, the death and funeral of Yasser Arafat from Ramallah and the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war.

McNaught anchored the BBC&#x27;s rolling coverage from the studio of the entry of UN forces into Kosovo and - in 2003 - US forces into Iraq.

In 2006 she made a decisive move away from the UK, working first with CNN in Bangladesh and Lebanon, then for two years (2007-2008) with Fox News in Iraq. She has worked in Gaza on two occasions, in 2006 and 2007.
She joined Al Jazeera English in 2009, first as a freelance reporter, then from 2010 as a staff correspondent based out of Istanbul, Turkey. Her work for AJE has taken her to back to Iraq, Iraqi Kurdistan and Bangladesh, and to Lebanon, Pakistan, Syria, Sudan, Hungary, and as well as all over Turkey. In 2011 she spent months reporting from Libya on the uprising against Col Gaddafi, and in 2012 she filed many reports from inside Syria. In 2013 she has reported from Egypt, Japan and the Syria-Turkey border. Her last reports for AJE were from South Sudan in June and July 2014.

She contributed to the NZ satirical media show &quot;Eating Media Lunch&quot;, and was a founding board member of Women in Film and Television (WIFTNZ) in New Zealand.

==Personal life==
Born in London, McNaught moved to New Zealand at the age of 20. She worked there for 12 years, before returning to the United Kingdom in 1997. She now has United Kingdom and New Zealand dual-nationality.

Anita was married to Olaf Wiig, a cameraman for Fox News but divorced. In 2008 she married Adnan Siddiqi. 

On 14 August 2006 Wiig was taken hostage in the Gaza Strip along with colleague Steve Centanni. Wiig and Centanni were released after 13 days in captivity, on 27 August 2006, having appeared in a videotape saying - at gunpoint - that they had &quot;embraced Islam with the Islamic prophet Muhammad as their leader&quot;. Upon release, Olaf and Steve were reunited with family and friends. Wiig and McNaught were then taken to New York City in Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s (owner of News Corp, Fox&#x27;s parent company) private jet and reunited with Wiig&#x27;s New Zealand family members who had flown to New York.

<doc id="734320" wikidata="Q3144926" url="?curid=734320" title="Subdural hematoma">
<text>A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a type of bleeding in which a collection of blood—usually but not always associated with a traumatic brain injury—gathers between the inner layer of the dura mater and the arachnoid mater of the meninges surrounding the brain. It usually results from rips in bridging veins that cross the subdural space.

Subdural hematomas may cause an increase in the pressure inside the skull, which in turn can cause compression of and damage to delicate brain tissue. Acute subdural hematomas are often life-threatening. Chronic subdural hematomas have a better prognosis if properly managed.

In contrast, epidural hematomas are usually caused by rips in arteries, resulting in a build-up of blood between the dura mater and the skull. The third type of brain hemorrhage, known as a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), causes bleeding into the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. SAH are often seen in trauma settings, or after rupture of intracranial aneurysms.
==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of a subdural hematoma have a slower onset than those of epidural hematomas because the lower-pressure veins involved bleed more slowly than arteries. Signs and symptoms of acute hematomas may appear in minutes, if not immediately, but can also be delayed as much as two weeks. Symptoms of chronic subdural hematomas are usually delayed more than three weeks after injury.

If the bleeds are large enough to put pressure on the brain, signs of increased intracranial pressure or brain damage will be present. Other symptoms of subdural hematoma can include any combination of the following:
* Loss of consciousness or fluctuating levels of consciousness
* Irritability
* Seizures
* Pain
* Numbness
* Headache (either constant or fluctuating)
* Dizziness
* Disorientation
* Amnesia
* Weakness or lethargy
* Nausea or vomiting
* Loss of appetite
* Personality changes
* Inability to speak or slurred speech
* Ataxia, or difficulty walking
* Loss of muscle control
* Altered breathing patterns
* Hearing loss or ringing in the ears (tinnitus)
* Blurred vision
* Deviated gaze, or abnormal movement of the eyes.
==Causes==
Subdural hematomas are most often caused by head injury, in which rapidly changing velocities within the skull may stretch and tear small bridging veins. Much more common than epidural hemorrhages, subdural hemorrhages generally result from shearing injuries due to various rotational or linear forces. There are claims that they can occur in cases of shaken baby syndrome, although there is no scientific evidence for this.

They are also commonly seen in the elderly and in people with an alcohol use disorder who have evidence of cerebral atrophy. Cerebral atrophy increases the length the bridging veins have to traverse between the two meningeal layers, thus increasing the likelihood of shearing forces causing a tear. It is also more common in patients on anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications, such as warfarin and aspirin, respectively. People on these medications can have a subdural hematoma after a relatively minor traumatic event. Another cause can be a reduction in cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which can reduce pressure in the subarachnoid space, pulling the arachnoid away from the dura mater and leading to a rupture of the blood vessels.

===Risk factors===
Factors increasing the risk of a subdural hematoma include very young or very old age. As the brain shrinks with age, the subdural space enlarges and the veins that traverse the space must cover a wider distance, making them more vulnerable to tears. The elderly also have more brittle veins, making chronic subdural bleeds more common. Infants, too, have larger subdural spaces and are more predisposed to subdural bleeds than are young adults. It is often claimed that subdural hematoma is a common finding in shaken baby syndrome, although there is no science to support this. In juveniles, an arachnoid cyst is a risk factor for subdural hematoma.

Other risk factors include taking blood thinners (anticoagulants), long-term excessive alcohol consumption, dementia, and cerebrospinal fluid leaks.

==Pathophysiology==

=== Acute ===
Acute subdural hematoma is usually caused by external trauma that creates tension in the wall of a bridging vein as it passes between the arachnoid and dural layers of the brain&#x27;s lining—i.e., the subdural space. The circumferential arrangement of collagen surrounding the vein makes it susceptible to such tearing.

Intracerebral hemorrhage and ruptured cortical vessels (blood vessels on the surface of the brain) can also cause subdural hematoma. In these cases, blood usually accumulates between the two layers of the dura mater. This can cause ischemic brain damage by two mechanisms: one, pressure on the cortical blood vessels, and two, vasoconstriction due to the substances released from the hematoma, which causes further ischemia by restricting blood flow to the brain. When the brain is denied adequate blood flow, a biochemical cascade known as the ischemic cascade is unleashed, and may ultimately lead to brain cell death.

Subdural hematomas grow continually larger as a result of the pressure they place on the brain: As intracranial pressure rises, blood is squeezed into the dural venous sinuses, raising the dural venous pressure and resulting in more bleeding from the ruptured bridging veins. They stop growing only when the pressure of the hematoma equalizes with the intracranial pressure, as the space for expansion shrinks.

=== Chronic ===

In chronic subdural hematomas, blood accumulates in the dural space as a result of damage to the dural border cells. The resulting inflammation leads to new membrane formation through fibrosis and produces fragile and leaky blood vessels through angiogenesis, permitting the leakage of red blood cells, white blood cells, and plasma into the hematoma cavity. Traumatic tearing of the arachnoid mater also causes leakage of cerebrospinal fluid into the hematoma cavity, increasing the size of the hematoma over time. Excessive fibrinolysis also causes continuous bleeding.

Pro-inflammatory mediators active in the hematoma expansion process include Interleukin 1α (IL1A), Interleukin 6, and Interleukin 8, while the anti-inflammatory mediator is Interleukin 10. Mediators that promote angiogenesis are angiopoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Prostaglandin E2 promotes the expression of VEGF. Matrix metalloproteinases remove surrounding collagen, providing space for new blood vessels to grow.

Craniotomy for unruptured intracranial aneurysm is another risk factor for the development of chronic subdural hematoma. The incision in the arachnoid membrane during the operation causes cerebrospinal fluid to leak into the subdural space, leading to inflammation. This complication usually resolves on its own.

==Diagnosis==
It is important that a person receive medical assessment, including a complete neurological examination, after any head trauma. A CT scan or MRI scan will usually detect significant subdural hematomas.

Subdural hematomas occur most often around the tops and sides of the frontal and parietal lobes. They also occur in the posterior cranial fossa, and near the falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli. Unlike epidural hematomas, which cannot expand past the sutures of the skull, subdural hematomas can expand along the inside of the skull, creating a concave shape that follows the curve of the brain, stopping only at dural reflections like the tentorium cerebelli and falx cerebri.

On a CT scan, subdural hematomas are classically crescent-shaped, with a concave surface away from the skull. However, they can have a convex appearance, especially in the early stages of bleeding. This may cause difficulty in distinguishing between subdural and epidural hemorrhages. A more reliable indicator of subdural hemorrhage is its involvement of a larger portion of the cerebral hemisphere. Subdural blood can also be seen as a layering density along the tentorium cerebelli. This can be a chronic, stable process, since the feeding system is low-pressure. In such cases, subtle signs of bleeding—such as effacement of sulci or medial displacement of the junction between gray matter and white matter—may be apparent.

Fresh subdural bleeding is hyperdense, but becomes more hypodense over time due to dissolution of cellular elements. After 3–14 days, the bleeding becomes isodense with brain tissue and may therefore be missed. Subsequently, it will become more hypodense than brain tissue.

===Classification===
Subdural hematomas are classified as acute, subacute, or chronic, depending on the speed of their onset.

Acute bleeds often develop after high-speed acceleration or deceleration injuries. They are most severe if associated with cerebral contusions. Though much faster than chronic subdural bleeds, acute subdural bleeding is usually venous and therefore slower than the arterial bleeding of an epidural hemorrhage. Acute subdural hematomas due to trauma are the most lethal of all head injuries and have a high mortality rate if they are not rapidly treated with surgical decompression. The mortality rate is higher than that of epidural hematomas and diffuse brain injuries because the force required to cause subdural hematomas tends to cause other severe injuries as well.

Chronic subdural bleeds develop over a period of days to weeks, often after minor head trauma, though a cause is not identifiable in 50% of patients. They may not be discovered until they present clinically months or years after a head injury. The bleeding from a chronic hematoma is slow and usually stops by itself. Because these hematomas progress slowly, they can more often be stopped before they cause significant damage, especially if they are less than a centimeter wide. In one study, only 22% of patients with chronic subdural bleeds had outcomes worse than &quot;good&quot; or &quot;complete recovery&quot;. Chronic subdural hematomas are common in the elderly.

===Differential diagnosis===

==Treatment==
Treatment of a subdural hematoma depends on its size and rate of growth. Some small subdural hematomas can be managed by careful monitoring as the blood clot is eventually resorbed naturally. Others can be treated by inserting a small catheter through a hole drilled through the skull and sucking out the hematoma.

Large or symptomatic hematomas require a craniotomy. A surgeon opens the skull and then the dura mater; removes the clot with suction or irrigation; and identifies and controls sites of bleeding. The injured vessels must be repaired. Postoperative complications can include increased intracranial pressure, brain edema, new or recurrent bleeding, infection, and seizures. In patients with a chronic subdural hematoma but no history of seizures, it is unclear whether anticonvulsants are harmful or beneficial.

Those with chronic subudural haematoma (CSDH) with few or no symptoms or have high risk of complication during surgery may be treated conservatively with medications such as atorvastatin, dexamethasone, and mannitol, although supporting conservative treatment is still weak. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor such as Atorvastatin can reduce the haematoma volume and improving neurological function in eight weeks. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor may also reduce risk of recurrences in CSDH. Dexamethasone, when used together with surgical drainage, may reduce the recurrence rate of subdural haematoma. Even with surgical evacuation of chronic subdural haematoma, the recurrence rate is high, ranging from 7 to 20%.

== Prognosis ==
Acute subdural hematomas have one of the highest mortality rates of all head injuries, with 50 to 90 percent of cases resulting in death, depending on the underlying brain injury. About 20 to 30 percent of patients recover brain function. Higher Glasgow Coma Scale score, younger age and responsive pupils are associated with better outcomes in acute subdural hematomas, while the time between the injury and the surgical evacuation, or the type of surgery, do not have a statistically significant impact on the outcomes. Additionally, chronic subdural hematomas (CSDHs) have a relatively high mortality rate (up to 16.7% in patients over the age of 65); however, they have an even higher rate of recurrence (as mentioned in the previous section). For the aforementioned reasons, researchers have developed predictive grading scales to identify patients at high risk of CSDH recurrence, one of which is the Puerto Rico Recurrence Scale developed by Mignucci-Jiménez et al.

His EMI (Experiments in Musical Intelligence) software has produced works in the style of various composers, some of which have been commercially recorded—ranging from short pieces to full-length operas. 

In 1981, he received a commission to compose an opera, but had a &quot;composer&#x27;s block&quot;, so he began writing EMI (on an Apple desktop computer) to understand and modify his own style, and 8 years after receiving the commission, managed to write the opera in 2 days with the help of EMI. Once it was done, he applied the same method to other composers like Bartok, Brahms, Chopin, Gershwin, Joplin, Mozart, and Prokoviev, resulting in a program that could compose in their styles as well. He then got an album published &quot;Bach By Design&quot; which was played by a Disklavier. The next album, &quot;Classical Music Composed by Computer&quot;, was played by humans.

Douglas Hofstadter developed a touring lecture about EMI, during the middle of which he would play two pieces, one a genuine Chopin piece, and one Chopin-style piece by EMI. The audience would then guess which is which, like in a Turing test. The audience could guess not better than random chance. As of 2001, EMI consisted of 20,000 lines of Lisp code.

His subsequent Emily Howell program models musical creativity based on the types of creativity outlined by Margaret Boden in her book &quot;The Creative Mind: Myths and Mechanisms&quot;.

As a composer, Cope&#x27;s own work has encompassed a variety of styles—from the traditional to the avant-garde—and techniques, such as unconventional manners of playing, experimental musical instrument, and microtonal scales, including a 33-note system of just intonation he developed himself. Most recently, all of his original compositions have been written in collaboration with the computer—based on the input of his earlier works. He seeks synergy between composer creativity and computer algorithm as his principal creative direction.

==Bibliography==
Cope has published a wide range of books, which are often used as textbooks. &quot;New Directions in Music,&quot; first published in 1971, is currently in its 7th edition and is the standard text for contemporary music. In 2009, Cope was interviewed by the media in anticipation of the release of a CD containing music composed collaboratively by Cope and Emily Howell, a computer program.

Cope has also published a series of detective novels under a pseudonym.

In 2022, Cope published the book &quot;Ethics of Computer-Assisted Music&quot;. Cope argues that just as there are differences in the application of ethics and morals among diverse cultures across society, there are similar ethical complexities that exist within the field of computer music.

<text>Josef Meinrad (; 21 April 1913 – 18 February 1996) was an Austrian actor. From 1959 until his death in 1996, Meinrad held the Republic of Austria&#x27;s Iffland-Ring, which passes from actor to actor — each bequeathing the ring to the next holder, judging that actor to be the &quot;most significant and most worthy actor of the German-speaking theatre&quot;.

==Life==
Josef Meinrad was born Josef Moučka in Vienna, as the fourth and youngest child of the tram driver Franz Moučka and his second wife Katharina. For his secondary education, he received a scholarship in a school run by Redemptorists in Katzelsdorf near Wiener Neustadt. At first, he wanted to become a priest, but he left the boarding school in 1929 and began a commercial apprenticeship, while taking acting lessons.

He made his public acting debut during a theatre festival at Korneuburg in 1930, by which time he called himself Josef Meinrad. Nevertheless, he finished his training and worked as a commercial clerk until 1935. From that time on, he performed on various smaller stages, passing his acting exam in 1937. His first brief engagement at the Vienna Burgtheater was in 1939, he then played at the German Theatre in Metz, mainly in front of &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; soldiers.

After the war, Meinrad again performed in Vienna. At the Salzburg Festival in 1947 he appeared in &quot;Jedermann&quot;. Later that year, Meinrad became a full-time permanent member of the Burgtheater company and was part of that ensemble until his 65th birthday in 1978. He played 195 roles on that stage and was famous for his performances in comedies by Johann Nestroy and Ferdinand Raimund. In 1968 he played the title role in the German-language premiere of Dale Wasserman&#x27;s musical &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; at the Theater an der Wien. He also appeared in several Films and TV series, chiefly known for his role as an adjutant in the &quot;Sissi&quot; trilogy starring Romy Schneider.

Meinrad was the keeper of the Iffland-Ring, which for 200 years has been given to the most important actor of the German-speaking theatre; he passed the ring on to Bruno Ganz.

From 1950 until his death he was married to Germaine Renée Clement, who died in 2006. Meinrad died in 1996 from cancer, aged 82, in Großgmain and is buried there.

<text>Robert &quot;Robbie&quot; Baldwin is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by artist Steve Ditko and writer Tom DeFalco, the character first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot; #22 (January 1988) originally known as Speedball, as well as in &quot;Civil War: Front Line&quot; #10 (January 2007) as Penance.

The character&#x27;s origin and early exploits as Speedball were depicted soon after in a solo series. After that series was cancelled, he appeared as a member of the superhero team the New Warriors, in the monthly title of the same name. In the Marvel Comics crossover &quot;Civil War&quot;, the character changes his name and appearance to Penance. Following this change, he is a member of the Thunderbolts. As of the first issue of &quot;Avengers Academy&quot;, he has reverted to Speedball and a modified version of his original costume.

==Creation==
Defalco spoke on the creation of the character stating, &quot;I came up with the original idea for the character and wrote a bible on him which included his origin, his powers, personality, family dynamic, and everything else you needed to know in order to write a story about him. Steve designed the costume and also designed Robbie himself...I originally called him Ricochet and presented him to Jim Shooter for the New Universe and told me we should eventually do him in for the Marvel Universe... I changed the name. I didn&#x27;t like the way Ricochet looked as a logo and thought Speedball was much more descriptive&quot;

==Publication history==

Created by artist Steve Ditko and writer Tom DeFalco, The character first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot; #22 (January 1988), originally known as Speedball

Marvel Comics published ten issues of the monthly comic book series &quot;Speedball&quot; from 1988 to 1989. The series was primarily plotted and penciled by Steve Ditko who also supplied the covers. It was scripted by Roger Stern and inked by several different artists.

After the series&#x27; cancellation, the Speedball character primarily appeared in &quot;New Warriors&quot; and its related comics, written primarily by Fabian Nicieza. Speedball continued to be the most consistent character through the second and third volumes of the &quot;New Warriors&quot;. During his run on &quot;New Warriors&quot;, Fabian Nicieza commented:

The character is featured in Paul Jenkins&#x27;s &quot;Civil War: Front Line&quot;, after it was revealed that he was the only member of the New Warriors to survive the Stamford disaster. The character underwent a drastic change in this series, in which his powers alter and takes the name Penance, joining the Thunderbolts. He would also feature in his own limited series &quot;Penance: Relentless&quot;, also written by Jenkins, which examines the background to these changes. In the &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; comics series, Mike Deodato based Baldwin&#x27;s appearance on actor Edward Norton.

He appears as a supporting character in &quot;Avengers Academy&quot; #1-20 (Aug 2010-Dec 2011), back in his Speedball persona. After recruiting Sam Alexander in &quot;Nova&quot; Vol. 5 #7-9, Speedball became part of the 2014 incarnation of the New Warriors.

==Fictional character biography==
Robbie Baldwin was born in Springdale, Connecticut to mother Madeline, who co-starred in a soap opera with Mary Jane Watson and subsequently became a teacher, and father Justin, a successful district attorney. As a high school student, Robbie gains superpowers after an accident at the Hammond Research Laboratory where he works part-time as a laboratory worker. When Hammond scientists try to tap into a mysterious other-dimensional energy source, the energy bombards Baldwin. Baldwin survives the experience but finds himself surrounded by energy bubbles and clad in an odd costume.

Minutes afterwards, during a battle with some thieves who want to raid the lab, Baldwin discovers that his body now generates a kinetic energy field that protects him from impact and makes him a bouncing dynamo of kinetic energy. Calling himself Speedball, Baldwin becomes a crime-fighter in his hometown of Springdale, Connecticut. Baldwin&#x27;s parents have marital problems while he secretly leads his double life. This situation leads to domestic stress that escalates over time, driven partly by the conflict between Robbie and his father, who as district attorney is expected to uphold Springdale&#x27;s ordinance against costumed superheroes and has an extreme prejudice against these &quot;vigilantes&quot;.

The energy source also affects Niels, a cat belonging to one of the scientists, giving him the same powers. Speedball makes a number of attempts to catch the cat, hoping that study of Niels would give him better control of his powers. He would later learn that a villainous scientist, Clyde, was also after the cat, hoping to gain Speedball-like powers, and had allegedly created most of the supervillains in Springdale to this end. Speedball would later adopt the cat, who under the name of Hairball, would eventually have its own super adventures with the Pet Avengers.

While still an inexperienced crime-fighter, Speedball meets Spider-Man and Daredevil during a turf war between the Kingpin&#x27;s and the High Evolutionary&#x27;s henchmen.

===The New Warriors===
While shopping in New York City with his mother, Robbie Baldwin joins a battle between Terrax and a number of superheroes. The heroes become the founding members of the New Warriors, and Baldwin agrees to join the team. The commute from Connecticut to the team&#x27;s headquarters in New York City is difficult and Baldwin is frequently late for Night Thrasher&#x27;s formal meetings. With the New Warriors, he battles Psionex. He eventually reveals his double identity to the New Warriors, and when Speedball and the New Warriors battle the Force of Nature shortly afterwards, his mother also learns of his superhero identity. His father learns the truth some time later.

After Baldwin&#x27;s mother discovers his secret identity, his parents&#x27; marriage ends and Baldwin moves permanently to New York City. Baldwin finds friendship with all of his fellow New Warriors, but his closest friendships are with Nova and Rage. After Baldwin is transported to the dimension his powers derive from, Darrion Grobe joins the New Warriors as Speedball, although the other members think he is Baldwin. Baldwin returns from the kinetic dimension and begins a brief relationship with Timeslip.

===&quot;Civil War&quot;===

At the beginning of the &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline, the New Warriors attempt to apprehend a group of supervillains in Stamford, Connecticut, for their television reality show. Nitro, one of the criminals, creates an explosive blast that kills 612 civilians, including 60 children, as well as the New Warriors with the exception of Robbie Baldwin. This event triggers the push for superhero registration at the heart of &quot;Civil War&quot;. Baldwin is presumed dead after the incident, but he is found alive after the blast launches him over ; his kinetic field kept him alive, but it &quot;burned out&quot; as a result.

After awakening from a coma, Baldwin is arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D. and placed in federal prison. Furthermore, his own mother disowns him. After he discovers his powers are still functional, Baldwin is taken to the new penitentiary called Negative Zone Prison Alpha. Reed Richards, the facility&#x27;s creator, offers Baldwin the chance to testify before Congress. However, on the Capitol steps, Baldwin is shot by an assailant and taken away in an ambulance. Although bullet fragments remain inoperably lodged near his spine, Baldwin recovers from the wound. Richards determines that Baldwin&#x27;s powers are evolving. Baldwin thwarts an escape from the prison and says that he will comply with the Superhuman Registration Act.

Overcome by guilt and driven insane by his treatment, Baldwin orders a new suit of armor that features 612 internal spikes, in honor of the victims of explosion in Stanford, to trigger his powers. 60 of the spikes are larger than the rest, to represent the children who perished in the blast. Baldwin then rechristens himself &quot;Penance&quot; and is assigned to the Thunderbolts.

The Penance revamp of the character is satirized in &quot;Deadpool/Great Lakes Avengers Summer Fun Spectacular&quot;, in which Squirrel Girl (who has a crush on Speedball and her first kiss) confronts Robbie after learning of his transformation into Penance. Robbie tells Squirrel Girl that he became Penance not out of guilt, but to become &quot;deep&quot; and to escape his comedy-character background. Furthermore, he reveals that he has created a similar costume for his pet cat Niels (who he has renamed &quot;P-Cat, the Penitent Puss&quot;) while banging his head against the wall.

===Thunderbolts===
After the events of &quot;Civil War&quot;, Robbie Baldwin joins Norman Osborn&#x27;s new government-sponsored Thunderbolts team, which mostly comprises supervillains who are being forced to reform. On one of the new team&#x27;s first missions, Osborn sends Bullseye and Penance to deal with a vigilante named Americop. Bullseye forces Baldwin to use his powers to cripple the vigilante. After finding out that Osborn gave the order to Bullseye to do this, Baldwin destroys an expensive, one-of-a-kind eavesdropping device of Osborn&#x27;s, while reminding his boss that unlike many of the Thunderbolts under Osborn&#x27;s leadership, he has no failsafe nanites in him that force his compliance.

During the team&#x27;s mission to capture the Steel Spider, Penance suffers a mental breakdown and slams his head into a brick wall while remarking that he is &quot;not good enough&quot;. Found by teammate Radioactive Man, Penance is eventually brought back to the Thunderbolts Mountain, where he brutally assaults a prisoner who taunted him for his role in the Stamford tragedy. Osborn nearly kills Baldwin, but the team&#x27;s field leader Moonstone persuades Osborn that Baldwin could be manipulated and exploited as a Hulk-level enforcer for Osborn&#x27;s schemes.

Because of Baldwin&#x27;s increasing instability, Doc Samson arrives at Thunderbolts headquarters to provide additional psychiatric assistance. This foils Moonstone&#x27;s plan to be Baldwin&#x27;s therapist and exploit his fragile mental state to her own ends. Samson helps Penance focus his powers back to their original state, which he uses to defeat Moonstone in combat when (under the influence of a group of renegade telepaths) Moonstone tries to kill Samson.

The Thunderbolts fight Baldwin&#x27;s former New Warriors teammate and best friend Nova, who had recently returned to Earth. After the fight, Baldwin urges Nova to register with the Initiative. Seeing Baldwin in this state prompts Nova to return to space.

Ultimately, Baldwin deserts the Thunderbolts, although they pursue him. Baldwin eludes them, and with Wolverine&#x27;s help, he travels to Latveria to retrieve Nitro to stand trial for mass murder. During this adventure, Baldwin steals the ill-gotten fortune of Mendel Stromm, Norman&#x27;s former employee and rival, after stealing information Osborn obtained on Stromm illegally via Osborn&#x27;s position with the Thunderbolts. Baldwin confronts Doctor Doom as part of his quest. Doom eventually concedes the fight and relinquishes Nitro after realizing that defeating Baldwin would force him to tap into Latveria&#x27;s secret nuclear power plants, potentially revealing their existence to the outside world. After secretly donating Stromm&#x27;s fortune to charity for the rebuilding of Stamford, Baldwin arranges for a new Penance suit (with the same appearance but fewer spikes than the previous one) built after locking Nitro in the previous one. Nitro is imprisoned, but Robbie remains in the suit and returns to the Thunderbolts.

During the Secret Invasion, the Thunderbolts are sent to protect Washington from the Skrulls. Shortly after, Moonstone drugs Penance and, in the capacity as a psychiatrist, declares Penance needs to be permanently committed to the nearest corrupt maximum security hospital found.

===Avengers Initiative===
Penance, brainwashed and heavily drugged, is persuaded by Norman Osborn to join his new , at Camp H.A.M.M.E.R., and has psychotherapy sessions with Trauma, the camp therapist, having been ordered by Osborn to keep Penance in his mentally fragile state. Through Trauma&#x27;s &quot;pet therapy&quot; method, Penance is unknowingly reunited with his cat Niels. When the Avengers Resistance, consisting of many of Penance&#x27;s New Warriors teammates, come to Camp H.A.M.M.E.R. seeking to release a captured teammate, Taskmaster orders Penance to attack them. Their fight is interrupted by Nightmare having taken over the body of his son Trauma. Nightmare forces Penance to remember the Stamford incident, causing him to pass out in mental anguish. Tigra revives him, using her powers of empathy to help him see Trauma&#x27;s predicament. With this knowledge, Penance is able to talk Trauma into freeing himself from his father&#x27;s control. Penance then helps the Avengers Resistance escape Osborn&#x27;s forces by rupturing a gas main. He refuses Vance&#x27;s offer to join their team, not wanting his old friends to see how much he had changed.

Penance turns against Camp H.A.M.M.E.R. and helps the Avengers Resistance fight the Hood and those that are with Hood. During the battle, he finally reveals his identity to his other ex-New Warriors teammates.

===&quot;Heroic Age&quot;===
During the &quot;Heroic Age,&quot; Robbie Baldwin returns to using the Speedball identity as part of the Avengers Academy&#x27;s teaching staff.

===Fear Itself===
During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Speedball takes the Avengers Academy students on a field trip to the memorial for the people who died during the Stamford incident. They are attacked by a group called &quot;the Cobalt Men&quot;, named after one of the villains involved in the Stamford incident. Not wanting them to ruin the memorial of the dead, Speedball quickly defeats them using his enhanced Penance powers. Speedball later admits he cuts himself to store up the energy he uses as Penance because this power is more useful in a fight. He acknowledges that he should not have kept this a secret, and Hank Pym offers to help him find a better way to activate those powers. He later confronts Kuurth, Nerkodd, and a hate group founded by Sin called Sisters of Sin. After this, he cheers up a little and regains his sense of humor. After returning to the Avengers Academy, Speedball announces to the students and teachers that he is quitting the faculty, but still offers to help them anytime.

While Speedball is conversing with Justice, a chance sighting of the successor to their former New Warriors teammate Nova leads them to conclude that the time is right to reform the New Warriors. They track down the new Nova and ultimately convince him to join the new team.

===New Warriors: The New Team===
Having taken to the road again, Speedball and Justice find themselves in the town of New Salem, Colorado, where they meet the Salem&#x27;s Seven. They fight, but quickly patch things up after it is clear it was a misunderstanding. While Speedball plays video games with Brutacus, Justice has a little chat with Vertigo, Salem&#x27;s Seven leader, about the town. When the conversation deviates to Justice&#x27;s and Speedball&#x27;s intention of reforming the New Warriors and the difficulties that that will probably bring due to the persisting bad reputation for their involvement in the Civil War events, the Evolutionaries arrive, intent on burning down the town. Justice, Speedball, and Salem&#x27;s Seven drive them off. Their subsequent mission to stop the Evolutionaries leads to their recruiting of two heroes to the cause, Haechi and Sun Girl.

Looking for Nova but seeing he does not answer his phone, Speedball and the others head back to the Salem&#x27;s Seven and through their help and that of New Salem&#x27;s magical inhabitants, they locate the boy. As it turns out, Nova along with Hummingbird, Scarlet Spider and Faira Sar Namora of Atlantis had been kidnapped and were being held as prisoners in Mount Wundagore by the Evolutionaries and the High Evolutionary. Rushing, they arrive as the Evolutionaries are about to execute Nova, following his and the other prisoners&#x27; attempt to break out. Trying to reason with the High Evolutionary fails and Nova reveals his plan of eliminating &quot;mostly everyone&quot;. A chaotic fight ensues, with the prisoners, Sun Girl, Haechi and the New Warriors forming an impromptu team that manages to defeat the small army of Evolutionaries through their diverse and very different powers and abilities. Shortly after, when the High Evolutionary activates his machine to eliminate the super-powered population of Earth, Speedball and the others are brought down to their knees in excruciating pain and almost die, but they are all saved by Sun Girl who, as a non-altered human, is immune to the machine and destroys it. With the enemy fleeing but fearing its return, an invitation is made to everyone to join Speedball, Justice and Nova as New Warriors to face the High Evolutionary should he try to repeat his scheme - an invitation that is immediately declined, save for Hummingbird (who eagerly and joyfully accepts) and Sun Girl (who does so implicitly).

While Justice takes Scarlet Spider and Faira on the task of cleaning the mountain of the High Evolutionary&#x27;s hostile contraptions and robots, Speedball takes Sun Girl, Hummingbird and Haechi to a nearby town - with the excuse that it had been attacked - to have dinner and to take an opportunity to better know his new teammates. When the topic of everyone&#x27;s abilities is discussed and Speedball clarifies his capacity to &quot;bounce&quot;, Hummingbird suddenly starts to inquire about his other powers, if he still cuts himself and the reasons why. Somehow, her strange psychic powers shows her Speedball&#x27;s mental image of himself as clad in the Penance suit instead of his normal appearance - indicating he still struggles internally with his guilt while keeping a carefree facade to everyone else. Speedball attempts to explain himself while telepathically warning Hummingbird in an ominous tone against reading his mind and to tell no one else about this. They decide to return to the base in Wundagore mountain where Justice and the others have encountered a pair of New Men that are willing to help their group. Hummingbird develops an &quot;unfathomable&quot; crush on Speedball.

The New Men - now renamed by themselves as Jack Waffles and Mr. Whiskers - assist the New Warriors to go to New York. However, they do so by using the base&#x27;s advanced technology to teleport the entire Mount Wundagore, provoking a mass panic in the city, but not causing any casualties, as the mountain is &quot;half-phased&quot;, so most of it doesn&#x27;t physically interact with the water or anything passing through it. Still, the Avengers take notice of the event and dispatch Iron Man and Thor. The former takes Speedball and Justice to Avenger&#x27;s tower, where they and Captain America get into a discussion about the problems that reforming the New Warriors will bring and the incident with the mountain. For a moment, as animosity rises, Robbie starts to discreetly charge his Penance powers to use them against the Avengers. But he is touched by Justice&#x27;s passionate defense of the New Warriors&#x27; team name, its members and their actions. They part with the Avengers on amicable terms.

The next day, when Haechi and Sun Girl are forcefully taken to Singapore by Inhuman supremacists led by Lash, Speedball and the rest of the New Warriors go to save them, battling through all the floors of a skyscraper filled with innocent, mind-controlled people. As they do so, Robbie asks Scarlet Spider if Hummingbird has said anything about him and jokingly suggests to not believe anything she says because &quot;she is really weird&quot;. When Scarlet Spider reprimands him for his timing and asks if Robbie can take anything seriously, Speedball discharges his Penance powers on the remaining mind-controlled adversaries and somberly proclaims &quot;Yes. I can&quot;. They battle and defeat Lash&#x27;s henchmen, who teleport away.

During a distraction trip the group takes to a bar in Prague, Hummingbird insists on dancing with Robbie. She reveals to him that she is enjoying herself, as much as possible, since she is certain she will die soon as &quot;Mictlan rises&quot; (an event that portended in her dreams for months).

Some time later, the New Warriors locate the High Evolutionary to stop him from continuing to pursue his plan. With great coordination, they expertly board his ship, defeat his last Evolutionaries and trap him. It is then that the Eternals appear to ensure the High Evolutionary fulfills his agenda and prevent the Celestials from judging and destroying Earth. As the situation turns for the worse, Robbie coldly assess each of his teammates and sees they are fighting a losing battle. Nevertheless, he throws his best against the Eternals and for a moment manages to inspire the others to do the same and gain the upper hand. Hummingbird then uses her telepathy to discover that the leader of the Eternals, Zuras, was lying, and the Celestials weren&#x27;t coming. This was seemingly in vain, as the New Warriors are defeated and used to power up the machine while Zuras manages to silence them or deflect any suspicion of his persona from his peers.

However, Justice, who had been dealt with separately from the rest of the team, returns to the fight and frees his teammates, damaging the High Evolutionary&#x27;s machine in the process. Justice then convinces the rest of the Eternals and the High Evolutionary that Zuras had, indeed, been lying. The leader of the Eternals is forced to admit the Celestials weren&#x27;t coming, albeit blaming the attempted genocide entirely on the High Evolutionary with the excuse &quot;he had been tricked by him too&quot;. The Eternals leave, warned by the New Warriors not to come back.
Robbie is last seen happily walking away with the rest of his teammates from the crashed ship.

During the &quot;Outlawed&quot; storyline, Robbie appears as a member of C.R.A.D.L.E. when a law is passed that forbids superheroes who are below the age of 21.

==Powers and abilities==

===As Speedball===
As a result of the mutagenic effects of irradiation by an unknown form of energy, Robbie Baldwin possesses the superhuman ability to create a kinetic force field of unknown energy, manifested as iridescent bubbles, around himself which absorbs all kinetic energy directed against him and reflects it with even greater force against whatever object with which he is in contact. Hence, if he struck a wall, he would travel at a greater velocity in the opposite direction.

When Speedball uses his superhuman powers, solid force bubbles of residual kinetic field energy appear on his body and, when he bounces, in his wake. While bouncing, he is immune to any kind of harm caused by physical contact. Speedball&#x27;s power activates automatically when any physical contact occurs above a low level that has not yet been precisely determined. When Speedball&#x27;s kinetic field activates, his body increases in height and mass (drawn from an extradimensional source); he reverts to his normal size and mass on deactivating the field. Early in his career, the slightest touch, such as snapping his fingers, would turn on this field, but he eventually gained conscious control over it. The field repelled all energy that struck it, especially kinetic energy. As such, bullets, punches, and all other physical attacks bounced off him. A side effect of this, though, was that he, too, would bounce in the opposite direction. Baldwin often used this to his advantage, such as purposely running into a wall in order to gain momentum and thus hit an opponent with twice the force.

While with the Warriors, Baldwin gained far greater control over his powers via a combination of experience in battle and Night Thrasher&#x27;s mentorship off the battlefield. Whereas previously Baldwin could barely bounce in the direction he wanted, he eventually became more proficient at controlling his leaps and using his powers in various ways, such as to deliver impressive blows, and even to project a stream of kinetic energy from his bubble field at a distance. He eventually learned to mentally &quot;throw&quot; the bubbles that surrounded his field to use as concussive force attacks. He was able to somewhat deflect Siena Blaze&#x27;s electromagnetic attack that &quot;no one short of the Hulk could have withstood&quot;, as well as resist the omnipath Gamesmaster&#x27;s telepathy, one of the few people in the world to do so.

===As Penance===
After the events of Stamford, Baldwin believed his powers to be burned out. However, they still exist, but now only manifest when he experiences extreme stimulation, such as intense pain. While his powers are still kinetically based, they no longer appear to manifest as a &quot;bubble field&quot;; rather, his powers seem far more explosive in nature. In order to stimulate his powers, his Penance suit constantly rakes his flesh. Baldwin tolerates this to a masochistic degree, once stating that he would &quot;wear [the suit] all the time if I could.&quot; By wearing the suit he has developed a natural tolerance to pain. His suit consists of 612 spikes facing inward, each to represent a person who lost their life in Stamford. 60 of the spikes are longer than the rest, one for each of the children.

Penance can achieve a variety of effects with his newfound powers. The most commonly used are explosive energy blasts from his hands, but he is capable of firing them from any part of his body via the conduits on his spikes. He can create storm-like fields of energy around him capable of harming those around him and smashing objects. He can focus the energy on parts of his body; often on his hands to form superpowerful punches. He can also engulf himself in an energy forcefield which gives him a degree of invulnerability and allows him to levitate off the ground.

Baldwin&#x27;s powers are constantly evolving and his original Speedball powers are shown to be returning to him. Robbie no longer needs the Penance suit to activate his powers but chose to wear it for a time to help remedy the guilt he feels, as well as for the benefits to his powers.

He seems loyal to them, but at the end of the second issue he is seen with a group of what would usually be considered &quot;his enemies&quot;. He asks Marty Gibbon about the human version of Speedball, but Marty does not have the heart to tell him about the Stamford incident. He&#x27;s later revealed to be part of a group trying to reveal that the Captain America leading the Ape-vengers is Baron Blood in disguise. After freeing the real Cap from the ice, the group goes out to fight Blood. Lost members of the Marvel 616 universe, the main Marvel universe, take a wounded Baldwin back home with them and get him medical treatment.

Speedball features in an arc of Robert Kirkman&#x27;s &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; (vol. 3), featuring a group of C-list heroes dubbed &quot;The League of Losers&quot;. A group of heroes including Gravity, Darkhawk, Dagger, Araña, X-23, Sleepwalker, and Terror (although Araña dies along the way) go to the future to prevent the villain Chronok from stealing Reed Richards&#x27; time machine, Chronok having come to the present and already having killed all of Marvel&#x27;s major heroes.

It is revealed Chronok is from the same time period as Kirkman&#x27;s Mutant 2099; the group stays with him and his mentor Reed Richards to wait for Chronok. The team defeats Chronok, but at the end of the story, Richards reveals they cannot go back to their present, due to time-travel and alternate timelines. The group decides to stay in the future, satisfied with the impact they made, however unnoticed. Mutant 2099 suggests reforming the Avengers or the &quot;Fantastic Nine&quot;.

Due to the Marvel Universe&#x27;s method for resolving time travel paradoxes, the League of Losers&#x27; actions created an alternate universe. This is the alternate future visited by Squirrel Girl, a superhero with a crush on him, in &quot;Deadpool/GLI Summer Fun&quot; (2007). She tries to convince him to return, suggesting that no-one would mix him up with the Penance from her time, but, before he can decide, the 2099 version of Mr Immortal, Squirrel Girl&#x27;s GLI leader, tells her she needs to return to the present.

<text>James Earl Chaney (May 30, 1943 – June 21, 1964) was an American civil rights activist. He was one of three Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) civil rights workers murdered in Philadelphia, Mississippi, by members of the Ku Klux Klan on June 21, 1964. The others were Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner from New York City.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
James Earl Chaney was born on May 30, 1943, in Meridian, Mississippi, the eldest son of Fannie Lee and Ben Chaney, Sr. His brother Ben was nine years younger, born in 1952. He also had three sisters, Barbara, Janice, and Julia. His parents separated for a time when James was young.

James attended Catholic school for the first nine grades, and was a member of St Joseph Catholic Church in Meridian, Mississippi.

At the age of 15 as a high school student, he and some of his classmates began wearing paper badges reading &quot;NAACP&quot;, to mark their support for the national civil rights organization, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, founded in 1909. They were suspended for a week from the segregated high school, because the principal feared the reaction of the all-white school board.

After high school, Chaney started as a plasterer&#x27;s apprentice in a trade union.

===Civil Rights work===
In 1962, Chaney participated in a Freedom Ride from Tennessee to Greenville, Mississippi, and in another from Greenville to Meridian. He and his younger brother participated in other nonviolent demonstrations, as well. James Chaney started volunteering in late 1963, and joined the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) in Meridian. He organized voter education classes, introduced CORE workers to local church leaders, and helped CORE workers get around the counties,

In 1964, he met with leaders of the Mt. Nebo Baptist Church to gain their support for letting Michael Schwerner, CORE&#x27;s local leader, come to address the church members, to encourage them to use the church for voter education and registration. Chaney also acted as a liaison with other CORE members.

==Murder==


On June 21, 1964, Chaney and fellow civil rights workers Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman were killed near the town of Philadelphia, Mississippi. They were investigating the burning of Mt. Zion Methodist Church, which had been a site for a CORE Freedom School. In the wake of Schwerner and Chaney&#x27;s voter registration rallies, parishioners had been beaten by Ku Klux Klan members. They accused the sheriff&#x27;s deputy, Cecil Price, of stopping their caravan and forcing the deacons to kneel in the headlights of their own cars, while white men beat them with rifle butts. The same klansmen who beat them were also identified as having burned the church.

Price arrested Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner for an alleged traffic violation and took them to the Neshoba County jail. They were released that evening, without being allowed to telephone anyone. On the way back to Meridian, they were stopped by patrol lights and two carloads of Ku Klux Klan members on Highway 19, then taken in Price&#x27;s car to another remote rural road. The men approached then shot and killed Schwerner, then Goodman, both with one shot in the heart and finally Chaney with three shots, after severely beating him. They buried the young men in an earthen dam nearby.

The men&#x27;s bodies remained undiscovered for 44 days. The FBI was brought into the case by John Doar, the Department of Justice representative in Mississippi monitoring the situation during Freedom Summer. The missing civil rights workers became a major national story, especially coming on top of other events as civil rights workers were active across Mississippi in a voter registration drive.

Schwerner&#x27;s widow Rita, who also worked for CORE in Meridian, expressed indignation that the press had ignored previous murders and disappearances of blacks in the area, but had highlighted this case because two white men from New York had gone missing. She said she believed that if only Chaney were missing, the case would not have received nearly as much attention.

==Aftermath for family==
After the funeral of their older son, the Chaneys left Mississippi because of death threats. Helped by the Goodman and Schwerner families, and other supporters, they moved to New York City, where Chaney&#x27;s younger brother Ben attended a private, majority-white high school.

In 1969, Ben joined the Black Panther Party and Black Liberation Army. In 1970, he went to Florida with two friends to buy guns; the two friends killed three white men in South Carolina and Florida, and Chaney was also convicted of murder in Florida. Chaney served 13 years and, after gaining parole, founded the James Earl Chaney Foundation in his brother&#x27;s honor. Starting in 1985, he worked &quot;as a legal clerk for the [late] former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, the lawyer who secured his parole&quot;.

==Federal trial==
In 1967, the US government went to trial, charging ten men with conspiracy to deprive the three murdered men of their civil rights under the Enforcement Act of 1870, the only federal law then applying to the case. The jury convicted seven men, including Deputy Sheriff Price, and three were acquitted, including Edgar Ray Killen, the former Ku Klux Klan organizer who had planned and directed the murders.

==State investigation==
Over the years, activists had called for the state to prosecute the murderers. The journalist Jerry Mitchell, an award-winning investigative reporter for the &quot;Jackson Clarion-Ledger&quot;, had discovered new evidence and written extensively about the case for six years. Mitchell had earned renown for helping secure convictions in several other high-profile Civil Rights Era murder cases, including the assassination of Medgar Evers in Jackson, Mississippi, the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, and the murder of Vernon Dahmer in his Mississippi home. He developed new evidence about the civil rights murders, found new witnesses, and pressured the State to prosecute. It began an investigation in the early years of the 2000s.
In 2004, Barry Bradford, an Illinois high school teacher, and his three students, Allison Nichols, Sarah Siegel, and Brittany Saltiel, joined Mitchell&#x27;s efforts in a special project. They conducted additional research and created a documentary about their work. Their documentary, produced for the National History Day contest, presented important new evidence and compelling reasons for reopening the case. They obtained a taped interview with Edgar Ray Killen, who had been acquitted in the first trial. He had been an outspoken white supremacist nicknamed the &quot;Preacher&quot;. The interview helped convince the State to reopen an investigation into the murders.

In 2005, the state charged Killen in the murders of the three activists; he was the only one of six living suspects to be charged. When the trial opened on January 7, 2005, Killen pleaded &quot;Not guilty&quot;. Evidence was presented that he had supervised the murders. Not sure that Killen intended in advance for the activists to be killed by the Klan, the jury found him guilty of three counts of manslaughter on June 20, 2005, and he was sentenced to 60 years in prison—20 years for each count, to be served consecutively.

Believing there are other men involved in his brother&#x27;s death who should be charged as accomplices to murder, as Killen was, Ben Chaney has said: &quot;I&#x27;m not as sad as I was. But I&#x27;m still angry&quot;.

==Legacy and honors==
* In 1998, Ben Chaney established the James Earl Chaney Foundation in his older brother&#x27;s honor, to promote the work of civil rights and social justice.
* Chaney, along with Goodman and Schwerner, received a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama in 2014.
* James Chaney Drive in Meridian, MS is named in his honor.

==Cultural references==

The murders of James Chaney, Michael Schwerner, and Andrew Goodman outside of Philadelphia, Mississippi, being pivotal to the events of the Freedom Summer and the Civil Rights Movement as a whole, is referred to in Alice Walker’s &quot;Meridian,&quot; which was published in 1976. It is referred to as being a deciding factor for not just the SNICK movement within the state of Mississippi, but for main characters Truman and Lynne to settle on going to Mississippi to further advocate for the movement. It was considered “the worst place in America for black people&quot; (Walker, 136) at this time, and as such required extensive effort to improve. Alice Walker’s Meridian, while following fictional characters, refers to key moments of the Civil Rights protests such as this for context and clarity.

<text>Uusimaa (; , ; both lit. &#x27;new land&#x27;) is a region of Finland. It borders the regions of Southwest Finland, Tavastia Proper (Kanta-Häme), Päijänne Tavastia (Päijät-Häme), and Kymenlaakso. Finland&#x27;s capital and largest city, Helsinki, along with the surrounding metropolitan area, are both contained in the region, and Uusimaa is Finland&#x27;s most populous region. The population of Uusimaa is 1,734,000.

While predominantly Finnish-speaking, Uusimaa has the highest total number of native speakers of Swedish in Finland even at a much lower share than two other regions.

== History ==

From the time of the Vikings in the 8th century, an eastern road ran along the Gulf of Finland. The first inhabitants were nomads. The place name of Nuuksio derives from the Sami word which means &#x27;swan&quot;&#x27;.&quot; Later Finns proper and Tavastians inhabited the area. Some place names have traces of Tavastian village names, like Konala, which likely derives from the older Tavastian village name &quot;Konhola&quot;. Estonians inhabited the region to a smaller extent, specifically for seasonal fishing.

Swedish colonisation of coastal Uusimaa started after the second crusade to Finland in the 13th century. The colonisation was part of converting pagan areas to Catholicism. Eastern Uusimaa had its first Christian Swedish colonialists earlier than the western part, which got its colonialists in one mass transfer of people to Porvoo in the 14th century. The colonisation was supported by the Swedish kingdom and the immigrants were provided with grain seeds and cattle. They also got a four-year tax exemption from the crown. All the Swedish place names of Uusimaa date back to this period.

The names &quot;Uusimaa&quot; and &quot;Nyland&quot;, meaning &#x27;new land&#x27; in English, derived from the Swedish colonisation era. The Swedish-language name &quot;Nyland&quot; appears in documents from the 14th century. The Finnish-language name &quot;Uusimaa&quot; appears for the first time in 1548 as &quot;Wsimaa&quot; in the first translation of the New Testament to Finnish by Mikael Agricola. Much of Uusimaa is literally new – it has risen off the Baltic Sea due to post-glacial rebound.

The Finnish provinces were ceded to Imperial Russia in the War of Finland in 1809. After this, Uusimaa became the Province of Uusimaa in the old system of the newly established Grand Duchy of Finland. From 1997 to 2010, Uusimaa was a part of the Province of Southern Finland. In 1994 it was divided into the regions of Uusimaa and Eastern Uusimaa, but in 2011 the two regions were merged as Uusimaa.

== Heraldry ==
The coat of arms of the province is (a golden boat which is a symbol for the coastal areas, and two silver wavy fesses which are the symbol for rivers.)

Uusimaa received its coat of arms at the end of the 16th century. There is an image of the coat of arms made in 1599. In 1997, the traditional coat of arms became the official coat of arms of the region.

== Languages ==

Uusimaa is a bilingual region, with municipalities both bilingual in Finnish and Swedish, and monolingual in Finnish. Uusimaa&#x27;s coastal areas tend to be Swedish-speaking. The traditional regional dialects of Swedish () are currently mostly spoken in Eastern Uusimaa, while in the rest of the Uusimaa Swedish dialect has become more standardised.

The Finnish-speaking population started to grow when the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland was moved from Turku to Helsinki by the Emperor of Russia Alexander I in 1812, and the region attracted settlers from other parts of Finland. Helsinki&#x27;s slang first evolved in the late 19th century. 7.6% of the population of the region speaks the Swedish language natively.

Due to immigration, many foreign languages are spoken in Uusimaa. 18% speak a foreign language as their mother tongue, the highest proportion in Finland and 58% of all foreign-language speakers in Finland. The figure was 1.1% in 1990, 3.9% in 2000, 8.0% in 2010 and 14.7% in 2020. Meanwhile, the proportion of Finnish and Swedish speakers has decreased from 87.6% and 11.3% in 1990 to 75.9% and 7.5% in 2021 respectively. On a municipal level, the highest shares of foreign speakers are in Vantaa (26.9%), Espoo (23.6%), Helsinki (19.6%) and Kerava (16.2%). The lowest share is in Pukkila (3.4%). 

The most spoken foreign languages are Russian (2.8%), Estonian (1.9%), Arabic (1.4%), Somali (1.2%) and English (1.2%). Other languages include Albanian, Chinese, Persian, Kurdish, Vietnamese, Spanish, Turkish, Thai, Tagalog, German, Nepali, Bengali, French, Romanian, Urdu, Hindi, Portuguese, Ukrainian, Italian, Polish, Tamil, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Swahili, Amharic, Serbo-Croatian, Latvian, Japanese, Dutch, Sinhalese, Tigrinya, Uzbek, Greek, Punjabi, Pashto and Telugu, all with over 1,000 speakers.

<text>The Eunomia or Eunomian family () is a large asteroid family of S-type asteroids named after the asteroid 15 Eunomia. It is the most prominent family in the intermediate asteroid belt and the 6th-largest family with nearly six thousand known members, or approximately 1.4% of all asteroids in the asteroid belt.

== Characteristics ==
By far the largest member is 15 Eunomia, the largest of all the &quot;stony&quot; S-type asteroid, It is about 300 km across along its longest axis, has a 250 km mean radius, and lies close to the barycenter of the family. Eunomia has been estimated to contain about 70–75% of the matter from the original parent body. This had a mean diameter of about 280 km and was disrupted by the catastrophic impact that created the family. It is likely that the parent body was at least partly differentiated, because the surface of Eunomia and spectra of the smaller family members show some variation. This notwithstanding, other studies have indicated that the body that was definitively shattered by the impact that created the family was probably already somewhat fragmented by previous smaller collisions. The impactor was probably a smaller, yet still very substantial asteroid of 50 km diameter (or so) that hit at a speed of about 22,000 km/h.

The other Eunomian asteroids are quite regularly distributed in orbital space around Eunomia. The next largest member identified by the analysis was 258 Tyche of 65 km diameter. However, its orbit lies at the very margin of what can be considered the family region, and it may well be an interloper. The largest clear family members are about 30 km diameter, with several asteroids in this size range.

Spectroscopic studies have shown that the family members span a noticeable range of compositions, although all remain within the S spectral class. As such they are of generally stony (rather than icy) surface composition that includes silicates and some nickel-iron, and are quite bright for their size.

The family contains relatively large numbers of small objects. Since most of these smaller objects are &quot;eroded&quot; away over time due to secondary collisions, gravitational perturbations, and the Yarkovsky effect, this indicates that the Eunomia family was created relatively recently (on an astronomical timescale).

The Cassini-Huygens spacecraft flew by 2685 Masursky, a small family member, in 2000. However, the encounter distance 
of about one million kilometers was too large for surface features to be resolved.

==Location and size==
The Eunomia family is located between the 3:1 and 8:3 resonances with Jupiter, at relatively high inclinations.

A HCM numerical analysis by Zappalà, et al. determined a large group of &#x27;core&#x27; family members, whose proper orbital elements lie in the approximate ranges

At the present epoch, the range of osculating orbital elements of these core members is
The Zappalà 1995 analysis found 439 core members, while a search of a recent proper element database for 96944 minor planets in 2005 yielded 4649 objects lying within the rectangular-shaped region defined by the first table above. By 2014, Nesvorný identified at total of 5,670, or approximately 1.4% of all asteroids, using the Hierarchical Clustering Method.

==Interlopers==

A number of interlopers have been identified, which share the same orbital elements as the true family members, but can not have come from the same breakup because of spectral (hence, compositional) differences. The following have been identified in a spectral survey: 85 Io, 141 Lumen, 546 Herodias.

<doc id="734363" wikidata="Q3341396" url="?curid=734363" title="Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)">
<text>Night Thrasher is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He first appeared in &quot;Thor&quot; #411 (December 1989), and was created by Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz. He is a non-superpowered vigilante, the son of murdered billionaire industrialist parents with ties to the Vietnam War, who uses an advanced suit of body armor, firearms, and a skateboard to battle his foes, and uses the billionaire resources of his family foundation to fund the New Warriors&#x27; battle against crime and corruption.

==Creation==
In a 2017 interview, DeFalco said, &quot;During that period of time, the bulk of Marvel&#x27;s readership was sixteen-year-olds of all ages—meaning those younger who dream of that golden age and those who remembered that age with fondness, aside from New Mutants, Marvel wasn&#x27;t producing any titles that featured teenagers. I wanted to introduce a new team—filled with teens—with the idea that we could eventually spin the more popular members off into their own titles. I consulted with our newsstand distributor and asked him about the magazines that teens were currently buying...He told me their most popular magazines were devoted to skateboarding with names like Thrash and Thrasher. They were even outselling the men&#x27;s magazines...That&#x27;s when I decided that the new team would have a character called Night Thrasher as its leader and Ron and I started talking.&quot;

==Publication history==
In addition to New Warriors runs and multiple mini-series of his own, Night Thrasher has appeared in &quot;The Punisher&quot;, &quot;Civil War II&quot;, &quot;Avengers&quot;, and &quot;X-Factor&quot; issues.

==Summary==
Night Thrasher is the founder and leader of the New Warriors, and head of the Taylor Foundation. Although he possesses no superhuman powers, he has trained himself extensively in many martial arts, and is adept at building technological devices.

In &quot;X-Men&quot; #29 and &quot;X-Force&quot; #32, it is revealed that Night Thrasher has ties to the Hellfire Club, a mysterious group of aristocrats and adversaries of the X-Men.

Night Thrasher had two legal guardians when he debuted in the New Warriors&#x27; origin issue: Andrew Chord and Tai. Chord has not been seen since mid-volume 1, and Tai died in issue #25 after revealing her plans to use the New Warriors to gain immeasurable power. It is assumed that Night Thrasher has simply outgrown his need for a legal guardian (in the letters page for &quot;The New Warriors&quot; #39 it was stated that Dwayne was 19 years old).

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
As a child in New York City, Dwayne Taylor saw his wealthy parents slain before his very eyes. Seeking vengeance, he honed himself into a fighting machine, then became obsessed with the desire to punish all wrongdoers.
He was unable to fully remember the exact circumstances of his parents&#x27; deaths, and he was unable to remember the face of their killer; he assumed that this was due to his mind trying to block the memory. Later in life he discovered that the entire circumstances of his parents&#x27; death and his own rearing by his guardian Chord and an elderly Asian woman named Tai, had in fact all been orchestrated by Tai herself.

The driven, conflicted young man lived a dual existence: during the day he ran the Taylor Foundation, and at night he relentlessly trained himself to human perfection, studying with the best private tutors money could buy. He then began patrolling the streets of New York City as a crimefighter, to provide a test-bed for his skills.

===Early adventures===
Silhouette and Midnight&#x27;s Fire were operating as independent vigilantes in the streets of New York City when they met Dwayne who was doing the same thing but as a solo operative (before he became Night Thrasher). The trio began an organized effort to lessen the influence of New York City street gangs. Silhouette and Midnight&#x27;s Fire were the children of Andrew Chord who was serving at the time as Dwayne&#x27;s guardian.

Their partnership ended when Silhouette was shot and paralyzed from the legs down in a sting operation gone badly. Midnight&#x27;s Fire blamed Dwayne and became a cop killer and a drug lord to lure Dwayne into a physical confrontation he could not possibly win. Later the partially paralyzed Silhouette reunited with Dwayne, distancing herself from her brother&#x27;s evil actions.

Dwayne created a suit of special body armor, partially as a response to the threat of Midnight&#x27;s Fire who was determined to kill him, and also because he felt it was the most effective way to carry out his mission.

===The New Warriors===
Night Thrasher meticulously researched several young solo heroes and selected three as targets for recruitment. He based his group on the Fantastic Four, with himself as the Reed Richards of the group: the leader and brains. Each additional member was slated to reflect roles of each of the FF. The first of his recruits was Richard Rider, the retired and supposedly depowered Nova (filling the role of the Thing). Deducing he could reignite Rider&#x27;s powers with a high-stress incident, Night Thrasher abducted Rider and dropped him off a building. Although Rider was understandably upset at Night Thrasher for risking his life, the fact that the incident allowed him to regain his powers (his greatest desire) made him feel obliged to join the team.

Night Thrasher chose the other teammates: mutants Firestar (filling the Human Torch slot) and Marvel Boy, later known as Justice, (filling the Invisible Woman slot). Soon after assembling, the four young superheroes became involved in an emergency. Terrax, a former herald of Galactus, had re-formed his body and was causing destruction in downtown New York. Arriving at the scene, they found Namorita and Speedball. The six young heroes battled Terrax and neutralized him via the use of ad hoc (but effective) teamwork. In the aftermath, the Avengers arrived and stole the show, leaving some of the young heroes bitter. They agreed to form a new team, the New Warriors, after a label given them by a reporter.

The New Warriors aided Thor in battle against Juggernaut. Night Thrasher&#x27;s former partnership with Midnight&#x27;s Fire and Silhouette was revealed, and he defeated Midnight&#x27;s Fire and was reunited with Silhouette. Night Thrasher first clashed with the Bengal, and fought the Punisher. With the New Warriors and the Fantastic Four, he again battled Terrax. With the New Warriors, he was captured by Gideon.

The Warriors fought crime together fairly successfully for a respectable amount of time, but Dwayne discovered some alarming truths about his life. He learned that his company was involved in shady practices, which led him to unravel lies that he had been fed since childhood. A bizarre mystical conspiracy was revealed involving the Folding Circle, and Tai&#x27;s true role was made clear.

During this time, Dwayne became the legal guardian for Rage, a young boy in a man&#x27;s super-powered body. Rage had lost his grandmother in a revenge scheme targeted at the New Warriors&#x27; friends and family.

===The Folding Circle===
Night Thrasher confronted the crime lord Tatsu&#x27;o in Japan, and quit the New Warriors. He battled and was forcibly inducted into the Folding Circle. During this time, Dwayne pretended to join the Folding Circle in order to infiltrate them, but he neglected to tell the Warriors this. His obsession with justice, still fueled by his parents&#x27; deaths, and his anger issues led to him leaving the team. He traveled with the Folding Circle to Dragon&#x27;s Breadth Temple in Cambodia, and learned of Tai&#x27;s responsibility for his parents&#x27; death. With the New Warriors, Darkhawk, and Folding Circle, he thwarted Tai. He sought to prevent a hostile takeover of the Taylor Foundation and saved Chord&#x27;s life. He fought rematches with Gideon and Bengal, and battled Tantrum.

In the aftermath of his departure, the Warriors were never quite the same. The lineup changed a bit, and Dwayne was an off-again, on-again ally. He suffered setbacks along the way, including losing his girlfriend and teammate Silhouette to his alleged half-brother Donyell (Bandit). Dwayne was also no longer the undisputed leader of the Warriors. Most of the group turned first to Namorita, and then later to Justice for leadership. He later involved himself with Psionex, but eventually returned to the team in the last issues of the volume. He played a prominent role in the final story arc of &quot;The New Warriors&quot;, dealing the death stroke to the Dire Wraith Volxx.

In &quot;Nova&quot; vol. 2 #1 (May 1999), Night Thrasher disbanded the team and decided to travel abroad, training in various martial arts disciplines. Learning of a plot against Iron Fist by the Hand&#x27;s new leader Junzo Muto during that time, Night Thrasher helped a recently reformed New Warriors in order to save Iron Fist&#x27;s life. After the adventure, he left again. In the volume&#x27;s last issue, he returned to the team, so that they could be molded into an effective superhero team again.

===&quot;New Warriors&quot; vol. 3===

Dwayne Taylor eventually &#x27;retired&#x27; from being a hero, but stayed semi-active while running the Taylor Foundation. He wished to use the foundation to make the world a better place, and became heavily involved in cancer research. He gathered a top notch staff of microbiologists, one of whom developed what appeared to be a cure for cancer. Actually, the cure turned out to have been the work of the biologist&#x27;s mutant son, who had used his powers to &#x27;tell&#x27; the cure what to do. This revelation destroyed investor confidence in the Taylor Foundation. The scientist died trying to prove his cancer cure worked by testing it on himself.

Dwayne salvaged the remains of the Taylor Foundation, and adopted Microbe, the mutant son of the dead microbiologist. Dwayne approached a television production company to bankroll and promote a new team, packaging their adventures as a reality TV show. He reassembled a new team of Warriors, plus Microbe, and they traveled the country.

===Civil War===

Night Thrasher was among the four New Warriors involved in the incident that led to the Superhuman Registration Act in the 2006–2007 storyline &quot;Marvel Civil War&quot;. The events of the arc begin when the villain Nitro destroys part of Stamford, Connecticut, killing Night Thrasher and several hundred civilians.

In the aftermath of &quot;Civil War&quot;, a new team called the New Warriors appear. They began recruiting underground, undiscovered, and de-powered heroes who disagree with the Superhuman Registration Act. While most of these New Warriors are new to the team, the leader and recruiter calls himself Night Thrasher, though the true identity of this person is unknown for the first few issues. In &quot;New Warriors&quot; (vol. 4) #6, it is revealed that Night Thrasher is Donyell Taylor, Dwayne&#x27;s illegitimate half-brother, previously the villain known as Bandit.

===Post-Civil War===
The New Warriors subsequently use a time machine in an attempt to save Dwayne, but are accidentally sent to a future timeline in which Iron Man used the Initiative to place the entire world under a tyrannical reign. Donyell confronts Iron Man and finds that it is not Tony Stark who is wearing the armor, but Dwayne resurrected. Overjoyed that his brother is alive, Donyell helps to capture his own teammates, despite his misgivings about Dwayne&#x27;s dictatorship. When this alternate Dwayne kills the captive Tony Stark in cold blood, Donyell turns against him, frees the New Warriors and eventually kills him.

===&quot;Contest of Champions&quot; and return===
During the contest between the Collector and his brother, the Grandmaster, Night Thrasher is pulled out of the timestream seconds before his death so that he may serve as part of the Collector&#x27;s team. After the Maestro usurps the Collector&#x27;s role and takes over the contest, Night Thrasher helps lead an insurrection. The rebellion fails, but Maestro sends Night Thrasher back to present day Earth, reasoning that he was too dangerous to keep around. In the present, Night Thrasher awakens to find that his last memory is of dying in the Stamford explosion.

==Powers and abilities==

Night Thrasher possesses excellent hand-to-hand fighting ability and is trained in various martial arts. He has been able to hold his own against the Punisher and would have beaten him had the Punisher not discharged a submachine gun at point-blank range. He is also an excellent acrobat, a talented designer of battle-suits and small armaments, and a good computer hacker. His strength was enhanced by his Mark II combat armor, but not to a superhuman degree.

According to the villain Genecide, Dwayne has unspecified &quot;advanced DNA&quot;. In issue #10 Emma Frost states he was somehow naturally immune to telepathic probes; this was later revealed to have been caused by Tai, either due to her tampering with his memory or a deliberate effort on Tai&#x27;s part to ensure that no one else could manipulate Dwayne and interfere with her plans for him.

===Equipment===
Night Thrasher wore a special suit of light articulated combat armor composed of Kevlar/borosilicate fiber in a ceramic matrix and 8 mm and 16 mm thick layers of micro-mail titanium nitride. He designed the battle-suit to survive physical combat with Silhouette&#x27;s brother Midnight&#x27;s Fire. The costume cannot be penetrated by conventional bullets or knives and is fireproof. The suit includes a wafer-thin L.E.D. casing that allows the suit to camouflage itself within its surroundings. The helmet contained integral goggles with infrared sighting, telescopic lenses, magnetic resonance scanning, and a camera attachment. It also includes a breathing apparatus, voice scrambler, two-way radio communications device, parabolic sound enhancer, and a cybernetic link to armor systems.

He carried a pair of truncheons, Escrima sticks which he called his &quot;Battle Staves&quot; which attached to special slots in the back of the Mark I armor, and an armored high tech fiberglass skateboard with a retractable razor-sharp blade. The board also hooked onto the back of his armor. The armor was equipped with a titanium spring-lock blade in the right forearm. The left wrist contained a thin adamantium alloy garrote wire. Micro surface-to-surface (STS) missiles were also mounted on the forearms. The Mark I armor also had a hidden compartment in which he had a Micro Uzi submachine pistol stored for emergencies. His skateboard could also be used as a shield or as a weapon and could be modified for use as a snowboard.

The wrist gauntlets on his armor could fire pepper spray, sleeping gas or explosively launch his &quot;Battle Staves&quot; which were holstered alongside his forearms in the Mark II armor. His gauntlets could also deploy pneumatically-fired grapnel lines for traversing rooftops, and contained retractable blades and an extendable computer tap. He also had a utility pack with various shaped explosives, plastique, napalm gel, and cordite packs, magnesium flares, smoke capsules, incendiary packs, caltrops/spur jacks, and ball bearings. The back pack also contained a glider chute. The Mark II armor also had an advanced active camouflage system.

The Night Thrasher armor Dwayne was wearing in Civil War was made from a vibranium mesh.

<text>A scientific enterprise is a science-based project developed by, or in cooperation with, a private entrepreneur. For example, in the Age of Exploration, leaders like Henry the Navigator founded schools of navigation, from which stemmed voyages of exploration.

==Examples of enterprising scientific organizations==
Each organization listed below has the ability to conduct scientific research on an extended basis, involving multiple researchers over an extended time. Generally, the research is funded not only for the science itself, but for some application which shows promise for the enterprise. But the researchers, if left to their own choices, will tend to follow their research interest, which is essential for the long-term health of their chosen field. Note that a successful scientific enterprise is not equivalent to a successful high-tech enterprise or to a successful business enterprise, but that they form an ecology, a &quot;food chain&quot;.
*The Max Planck Institute, which supports fundamental research in the natural, life and social sciences, the arts and humanities
*The RAND Corporation, founded as a &quot;research corporation&quot;. Did groundbreaking work in the field of artificial intelligence
*The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, founded by Theodore von Kármán
*Bell Laboratories, renowned for the quality of its scientific work and for inventing the operating system Unix, and the programming languages C and C++
*Xerox PARC, research organization which has also spawned innovations such as the graphical user interface, laser printing, and Ethernet
*SRI, where the computer mouse was invented, were explicitly founded with a research basis
*IBM Research, notable for inventing the relational database, hard disk drive, and floppy disk
*Hughes Research Laboratories, location of the invention of the first working laser
*The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, non-profit medical research organization

The Moscosos sent their son to New York City where he obtained his early education. Afterward he moved to Ponce and graduated from Ponce High School. After graduation he attended the Philadelphia School of Pharmacy (now the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia) to follow in his father&#x27;s profession. After three years, he transferred to the University of Michigan, where he graduated in 1932. Moscoso returned to Ponce and worked in his father&#x27;s pharmacy. The pharmacies, an island-wide chain, operated from their founding in 1915 until 1995 when they were sold to Farmacias El Amal, another local chain. He married Gloria Sánchez Vilella.

== Entry into civil service ==
Moscoso left the family business and helped win for the Ponce Housing Authority (PHA) an imperiled $2-million grant. In the midst of the Great Depression, the grant aided the construction of nearly 1,000 homes in Ponce. Moscoso&#x27;s success caught the attention of various Puerto Rican government officials. In 1940, Moscoso joined the Popular Democratic Party after meeting Luis Muñoz Marín, and became instrumental in making Luis Muñoz Marín&#x27;s vision of an industrialized Puerto Rico a reality.

== Economic development ==
In 1941, Rexford Guy Tugwell, Governor of Puerto Rico, and Luis Muñoz Marín, president of the Puerto Rican Senate, established a number of government-owned corporations. In 1942, Moscoso became Executive Director of the new agency in charge of Puerto Rico&#x27;s economic development, the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company.

Under Governor Muñoz Marín&#x27;s administration, Moscoso led a project known as Operation Bootstrap. This administration realized that agriculture alone would not be able to provide employment for the burgeoning population, and sought to use the advantages of free access to the American market, plus a ready, inexpensive, and trained labor force, to rapidly industrialize the country. The country experienced rapid economic progress during the decades of 1950–1970. The ambitious project stimulated various industries through federal and local tax exemption as well as through government assistance, to invest in Puerto Rico. Moscoso succeeded in attracting worldwide capital investment to the Commonwealth; this, in turn, helped transform the island into a modern industrial society. &quot;The Economist&quot; later reported: &quot;one century of economic development . . . achieved in a decade.&quot;

The following table shows Puerto Rico&#x27;s change from agricultural to manufacturing society in terms of employment (extracted from Fernando Pico&#x27;s &quot;Historia General de Puerto Rico&quot;).

== Ambassador ==
In May 1961, United States President John F. Kennedy named Moscoso ambassador to Venezuela. One month later Moscoso was kidnaped by leftist students at the Central University of Venezuela, while his car was turned on fire. Some unattended diplomatic documents were taken from the car before it was burned.

Those documents, which contain a series of &quot;recommendations&quot; State Department to Venezuelan government were read on August 8, 1961, by Che Guevara, head of the Cuban delegation at Economic Conference of Punta del Este, Uruguay. On November 11 the president Romulo Betancourt ordered break diplomatic relations with Cuba. Earlier, the Mexican government had agreed to host the hundred Cuban refugees who were at the Venezuelan embassy in Havana, hoping to leave their country. In November Moscoso was named coordinator of Kennedy&#x27;s Alliance for Progress and returned to Washington.

After the Kennedy assassination, Moscoso returned to Puerto Rico. In 1966, Moscoso headed the Commonwealth Oil Refining Co. (&quot;CORCO&quot;). From 1973 to 1976 Moscoso became again the head of &quot;Fomento&quot;.

== Death ==
Teodoro Moscoso died on June 15, 1992.

== Legacy ==

A 2.25-kilometer bridge connecting the Hato Rey/Río Piedras sectors of San Juan, Puerto Rico with the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport bears the name of Teodoro Moscoso. The bridge, over the San José Lagoon, is the longest bridge over a body of water in Puerto Rico. In Ponce he is honored at the Illustrious Ponce Citizens Plaza in Tricentennial Park.

<text>More is a 1969 English-language romantic drama film written and directed by Barbet Schroeder in his directorial debut. Starring Mimsy Farmer and Klaus Grünberg, the film deals with heroin addiction as drug fascination on the island of Ibiza, Spain. Made in the political fallout of the 1960s counterculture, 
it features drug use, &quot;free love&quot;, and other references to contemporary European youth culture.

The screenplay was written by Paul Gégauff and Barbet Schroeder with the original story by Schroeder. It features a soundtrack written and performed by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released as an album the same year. Schroeder&#x27;s inspiration for the film came from the counterculture tradition of the 1960s with themes of drugs, addiction, sexual freedom, and the beauty of life often in New Wave films. Production began in 1968 with a low budget, and the film was partially funded by Jet Films and executive produced by Les Films du Losange.

Upon its release on 4 August 1969, &quot;More&quot; garnered mostly negative reviews from critics. It was selected to be screened in the Cannes Classics section of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. &quot;More&quot; was released on DVD on 5 April 2005 by Home Vision Entertainment.

==Plot==
In West Germany in the late 1960s, Stefan finished his mathematics studies and decided to experience life. He Hitch-hikes to Paris and befriends a petty criminal called Charlie after gambling at a bar. Charlie takes him to a party where he is fascinated by an American girl named Estelle, nicknamed the &quot;pussycat&quot;. Though Charlie warns him that she is a drug user and dangerous, he goes to her hotel room, where she introduces him to marijuana and they make love.

She is leaving for Ibiza and invites Stefan to follow her there. When he arrives, he finds she is involved with a wealthy Spanish ex-Nazi, Dr. Ernesto Wolf, as told by a drug dealer he befriends at a bar. Later, she introduces him to her friends at a hippie party, including her best friend Cathy. Stefan persuades her to join him in an isolated villa and she secretly brings both money and a huge quantity of heroin she has stolen from Wolf. After an idyllic time swimming, sunbathing, and making love, she is itching for the &quot;horse&quot; drug and introduces him to it as well. After asking a visiting Cathy, she tells Stefan what &quot;horse&quot; is: heroin.

Soon the two are on a downward spiral of addiction. Wolf demands the return of the rest of the heroin and money and, as payment for what they have used, Stefan has to work in his bar while Estelle has to share his bed. She disappears from Stefan one night, worrying him for a while. Charlie comes looking for Stefan and urges him to return to Paris. Angered by Stefan being with Estelle despite his warnings, Charlie informs him that she completely &quot;destroyed&quot; two very nice men; he doesn&#x27;t want Stefan to be the third. 

On the night he’s supposed to leave for Paris Stefan demands to know what Estelle did the other night and hits her. After begging for heroin, Estelle reveals to Stefan that she’s been sleeping with Wolf the whole time; she doesn&#x27;t like it but was forced to with the deal she made after her theft. After much abuse from Stefan, Estelle runs away, making him panic. He fruitlessly searches for her and hurts a worried Charlie after he tries convincing him it isn&#x27;t worth it. The next morning, Stefan begs for two packets of heroin from the same dealer he befriended his first day in Ibiza the following morning and overdoses as a suicide, despite the dealer warning him of the drug&#x27;s intensity. He is buried in the open country and Charlie, very upset, watches.

==Cast==

* Mimsy Farmer as Estelle Miller
* Klaus Grünberg as Stefan Brückner
* Heinz Engelmann as Dr. Ernesto Wolf
* Michel Chanderli as Charlie
* Henry Wolf as Henry
* Louise Wink as Cathy

==Production==


===Filming===
Most of the movie was shot on the island of Ibiza. The castle of Ibiza, which dominates the harbour and the town, is the scene for the final act. A tunnel near the castle was also used. In Paris, the movie was shot at Hotel La Louisiane in real room 36.

===Music===

The soundtrack to the film was composed and performed by English rock band Pink Floyd, and consists of instrumental compositions and more conventional songs, such as &quot;The Nile Song&quot;, which (somewhat out of character for Pink Floyd) borders on Stooges-like heavy rock, and a ballad featuring bongos called &quot;Cymbaline&quot;, written by Roger Waters and performed by David Gilmour.

==Release==
===Censorship===
The French film censorship board in 1969 insisted that some of the dialogue be censored around the 81-minute mark before the film could be released. In the film, as the couple mixes up a hallucinogenic concoction in the kitchen, the ingredients &quot;benzedrine&quot; and &quot;banana peel&quot; are deleted from the audio track. On the DVD the words have been re-added as subtitles.

===Critical reception===
Upon its release, &quot;More&quot; garnered mainly negative reviews from critics, and was controversially reviewed by audiences and scholars, who commented on the drug use and impacts. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has 4 reviews, 3 are negative. At AlloCiné, which assigns a weighted mean rating to reviews, the film has a score of 3.7 based on 37 critics.

Concerning the film&#x27;s overall design, Roger Ebert stated, &quot;&quot;More&quot; is a weird, freaky movie about two hedonistic kids who destroy themselves with drugs. More precisely, it&#x27;s about a kinky American girl who destroys her German boyfriend and in the process destroys herself ... The message seems to be: Sure, speed kills, but what a way to go.&quot;

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD by The Criterion Collection under Home Vision Entertainment on 5 April 2005. A Blu-ray as a single disc variant with a single DVD disc version was released on 19 September 2011 by the British Film Institute.

<doc id="734434" wikidata="Q1072885" url="?curid=734434" title="Modern portfolio theory">
<text>Modern portfolio theory (MPT), or mean-variance analysis, is a mathematical framework for assembling a portfolio of assets such that the expected return is maximized for a given level of risk. It is a formalization and extension of diversification in investing, the idea that owning different kinds of financial assets is less risky than owning only one type. Its key insight is that an asset&#x27;s risk and return should not be assessed by itself, but by how it contributes to a portfolio&#x27;s overall risk and return. The variance of return (or its transformation, the standard deviation) is used as a measure of risk, because it is tractable when assets are combined into portfolios. Often, the historical variance and covariance of returns is used as a proxy for the forward-looking versions of these quantities, but other, more sophisticated methods are available.

Economist Harry Markowitz introduced MPT in a 1952 paper, for which he was later awarded a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences; see Markowitz model.

In 1940, Bruno de Finetti published the mean-variance analysis method, in the context of proportional reinsurance, under a stronger assumption. The paper was obscure and only became known to economists of the English-speaking world in 2006.

==Mathematical model==

===Risk and expected return===
MPT assumes that investors are risk averse, meaning that given two portfolios that offer the same expected return, investors will prefer the less risky one. Thus, an investor will take on increased risk only if compensated by higher expected returns. Conversely, an investor who wants higher expected returns must accept more risk. The exact trade-off will not be the same for all investors. Different investors will evaluate the trade-off differently based on individual risk aversion characteristics. The implication is that a rational investor will not invest in a portfolio if a second portfolio exists with a more favorable risk vs expected return profile — i.e., if for that level of risk an alternative portfolio exists that has better expected returns.

Under the model:
*Portfolio return is the proportion-weighted combination of the constituent assets&#x27; returns.
*Portfolio return volatility formula_1 is a function of the correlations &quot;ρ&quot;ij of the component assets, for all asset pairs (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;). The volatility gives insight into the risk which is associated with the investment. The higher the volatility, the higher the risk.
In general:

*Expected return:
:formula_2

:where formula_3 is the return on the portfolio, formula_4 is the return on asset &quot;i&quot; and formula_5 is the weighting of component asset formula_6 (that is, the proportion of asset &quot;i&quot; in the portfolio, so that formula_7).

*Portfolio return variance:
:formula_8,
:where formula_9 is the (sample) standard deviation of the periodic returns on an asset &quot;i&quot;, and formula_10 is the correlation coefficient between the returns on assets &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;. Alternatively the expression can be written as:

:formula_11,
:where formula_12 for formula_13 , or

:formula_14,
:where formula_15 is the (sample) covariance of the periodic returns on the two assets, or alternatively denoted as formula_16, formula_17 or formula_18.

*Portfolio return volatility (standard deviation):
:formula_19

For a two-asset portfolio:
*Portfolio expected return: formula_20
*Portfolio variance: formula_21

For a three-asset portfolio:
*Portfolio expected return: formula_22
*Portfolio variance: formula_23

The algebra can be much simplified by expressing the quantities involved in matrix notation. Arrange the returns of N risky assets in an formula_24 vector formula_25, where the first element is the return of the first asset, the second element of the second asset, and so on. Arrange their expected returns in a column vector formula_26, and their variances and covariances in a covariance matrix formula_27. Consider a portfolio of risky assets whose weights in each of the N risky assets is given by the corresponding element of the weight vector formula_28. Then:

*Portfolio expected return: formula_29
and
*Portfolio variance: formula_30

For the case where there is investment in a riskfree asset with return formula_31, the weights of the weight vector do not sum to 1, and the portfolio expected return becomes formula_32. The expression for the portfolio variance is unchanged.

===Diversification===
An investor can reduce portfolio risk (especially formula_1) simply by holding combinations of instruments that are not perfectly positively correlated (correlation coefficient formula_34). In other words, investors can reduce their exposure to individual asset risk by holding a diversified portfolio of assets. Diversification may allow for the same portfolio expected return with reduced risk. 
*If all the asset pairs have correlations of 0 — they are perfectly uncorrelated — the portfolio&#x27;s return variance is the sum over all assets of the square of the fraction held in the asset times the asset&#x27;s return variance (and the portfolio standard deviation is the square root of this sum).

*If all the asset pairs have correlations of 1 — they are perfectly positively correlated — then the portfolio return&#x27;s standard deviation is the sum of the asset returns&#x27; standard deviations weighted by the fractions held in the portfolio. For given portfolio weights and given standard deviations of asset returns, the case of all correlations being 1 gives the highest possible standard deviation of portfolio return.

===Efficient frontier with no risk-free asset===

The MPT is a mean-variance theory, and it compares the expected (mean) return of a portfolio with the standard deviation of the same portfolio. The image shows expected return on the vertical axis, and the standard deviation on the horizontal axis (volatility). Volatility is described by standard deviation and it serves as a measure of risk. The return - standard deviation space is sometimes called the space of &#x27;expected return vs risk&#x27;. Every possible combination of risky assets, can be plotted in this risk-expected return space, and the collection of all such possible portfolios defines a region in this space. The left boundary of this region is hyperbolic, and the upper part of the hyperbolic boundary is the &quot;efficient frontier&quot; in the absence of a risk-free asset (sometimes called &quot;the Markowitz bullet&quot;). Combinations along this upper edge represent portfolios (including no holdings of the risk-free asset) for which there is lowest risk for a given level of expected return. Equivalently, a portfolio lying on the efficient frontier represents the combination offering the best possible expected return for given risk level. The tangent to the upper part of the hyperbolic boundary is the capital allocation line (CAL).

Matrices are preferred for calculations of the efficient frontier.

In matrix form, for a given &quot;risk tolerance&quot; formula_35, the efficient frontier is found by minimizing the following expression:
:formula_36
where
* formula_37 is a vector of portfolio weights and formula_38 (The weights can be negative);
* formula_39 is the covariance matrix for the returns on the assets in the portfolio;
* formula_40 is a &quot;risk tolerance&quot; factor, where 0 results in the portfolio with minimal risk and formula_41 results in the portfolio infinitely far out on the frontier with both expected return and risk unbounded; and
* formula_42 is a vector of expected returns.
* formula_43 is the variance of portfolio return.
* formula_44 is the expected return on the portfolio.
The above optimization finds the point on the frontier at which the inverse of the slope of the frontier would be &quot;q&quot; if portfolio return variance instead of standard deviation were plotted horizontally. The frontier in its entirety is parametric on &quot;q&quot;.

Harry Markowitz developed a specific procedure for solving the above problem, called the critical line algorithm, that can handle additional linear constraints, upper and lower bounds on assets, and which is proved to work with a semi-positive definite covariance matrix. Examples of implementation of the critical line algorithm exist in Visual Basic for Applications, in JavaScript and in a few other languages.

Also, many software packages, including MATLAB, Microsoft Excel, Mathematica and R, provide generic optimization routines so that using these for solving the above problem is possible, with potential caveats (poor numerical accuracy, requirement of positive definiteness of the covariance matrix...).

An alternative approach to specifying the efficient frontier is to do so parametrically on the expected portfolio return formula_45 This version of the problem requires that we minimize

:formula_46

subject to

:formula_47 

and 

:formula_48

for parameter formula_49. This problem is easily solved using a Lagrange multiplier which leads to the following linear system of equations:

:formula_50

===Two mutual fund theorem===

One key result of the above analysis is the two mutual fund theorem. This theorem states that any portfolio on the efficient frontier can be generated by holding a combination of any two given portfolios on the frontier; the latter two given portfolios are the &quot;mutual funds&quot; in the theorem&#x27;s name. So in the absence of a risk-free asset, an investor can achieve any desired efficient portfolio even if all that is accessible is a pair of efficient mutual funds. If the location of the desired portfolio on the frontier is between the locations of the two mutual funds, both mutual funds will be held in positive quantities. If the desired portfolio is outside the range spanned by the two mutual funds, then one of the mutual funds must be sold short (held in negative quantity) while the size of the investment in the other mutual fund must be greater than the amount available for investment (the excess being funded by the borrowing from the other fund).

===Risk-free asset and the capital allocation line===
The risk-free asset is the (hypothetical) asset that pays a risk-free rate. In practice, short-term government securities (such as US treasury bills) are used as a risk-free asset, because they pay a fixed rate of interest and have exceptionally low default risk. The risk-free asset has zero variance in returns if held to maturity (hence is risk-free); it is also uncorrelated with any other asset (by definition, since its variance is zero). As a result, when it is combined with any other asset or portfolio of assets, the change in return is linearly related to the change in risk as the proportions in the combination vary.

When a risk-free asset is introduced, the half-line shown in the figure is the new efficient frontier. It is tangent to the hyperbola at the pure risky portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio. Its vertical intercept represents a portfolio with 100% of holdings in the risk-free asset; the tangency with the hyperbola represents a portfolio with no risk-free holdings and 100% of assets held in the portfolio occurring at the tangency point; points between those points are portfolios containing positive amounts of both the risky tangency portfolio and the risk-free asset; and points on the half-line beyond the tangency point are portfolios involving negative holdings of the risk-free asset and an amount invested in the tangency portfolio equal to more than 100% of the investor&#x27;s initial capital. This efficient half-line is called the capital allocation line (CAL), and its formula can be shown to be

:formula_51

In this formula &quot;P&quot; is the sub-portfolio of risky assets at the tangency with the Markowitz bullet, &quot;F&quot; is the risk-free asset, and &quot;C&quot; is a combination of portfolios &quot;P&quot; and &quot;F&quot;.

By the diagram, the introduction of the risk-free asset as a possible component of the portfolio has improved the range of risk-expected return combinations available, because everywhere except at the tangency portfolio the half-line gives a higher expected return than the hyperbola does at every possible risk level. The fact that all points on the linear efficient locus can be achieved by a combination of holdings of the risk-free asset and the tangency portfolio is known as the one mutual fund theorem, where the mutual fund referred to is the tangency portfolio.

=== Geometric intuition ===
The efficient frontier can be pictured as a problem in quadratic curves. On the market, we have the assets formula_52. We have some funds, and a portfolio is a way to divide our funds into the assets. Each portfolio can be represented as a vector formula_53, such that formula_7, and we hold the assets according to formula_55.

==== Markowitz bullet ====

Since we wish to maximize expected return while minimizing the standard deviation of the return, we are to solve a quadratic optimization problem:formula_56Portfolios are points in the Euclidean space formula_57. The third equation states that the portfolio should fall on a plane defined by formula_7. The first equation states that the portfolio should fall on a plane defined by formula_59. The second condition states that the portfolio should fall on the contour surface for formula_60 that is as close to the origin as possible. Since the equation is quadratic, each such contour surface is an ellipsoid (assuming that the covariance matrix formula_10 is invertible). Therefore, we can solve the quadratic optimization graphically by drawing ellipsoidal contours on the plane formula_7, then intersect the contours with the plane formula_63. As the ellipsoidal contours shrink, eventually one of them would become exactly tangent to the plane, before the contours become completely disjoint from the plane. The tangent point is the optimal portfolio at this level of expected return.

As we vary formula_49, the tangent point varies as well, but always falling on a single line (this is the two mutual funds theorem).

Let the line be parameterized as formula_65. We find that along the line,formula_66giving a hyperbola in the formula_67 plane. The hyperbola has two branches, symmetric with respect to the formula_49 axis. However, only the branch with formula_69 is meaningful. By symmetry, the two asymptotes of the hyperbola intersect at a point formula_70 on the formula_49 axis. The point formula_72 is the height of the leftmost point of the hyperbola, and can be interpreted as the expected return of the global minimum-variance portfolio (global MVP).

==== Tangency portfolio ====
The tangency portfolio exists if and only if formula_73.

In particular, if the risk-free return is greater or equal to formula_70, then the tangent portfolio &quot;does not exist&quot;. The capital market line (CML) becomes parallel to the upper asymptote line of the hyperbola. Points &quot;on&quot; the CML become impossible to achieve, though they can be &quot;approached&quot; from below.

It is usually assumed that the risk-free return is less than the return of the global MVP, in order that the tangency portfolio exists. However, even in this case, as formula_75 approaches formula_70 from below, the tangency portfolio diverges to a portfolio with infinite return and variance. Since there are only finitely many assets in the market, such a portfolio must be shorting some assets heavily while longing some other assets heavily. In practice, such a tangency portfolio would be impossible to achieve, because one cannot short an asset too much due to short sale constraints, and also because of price impact, that is, longing a large amount of an asset would push up its price, breaking the assumption that the asset prices do not depend on the portfolio.

==== Non-invertible covariance matrix ====
If the covariance matrix is not invertible, then there exists some nonzero vector formula_77, such that formula_78 is a random variable with zero variance—that is, it is not random at all.

Suppose formula_79 and formula_80, then that means one of the assets can be exactly replicated using the other assets at the same price and the same return. Therefore, there is never a reason to buy that asset, and we can remove it from the market.

Suppose formula_79 and formula_82, then that means there is free money, breaking the &quot;no arbitrage&quot; assumption.

Suppose formula_83, then we can scale the vector to formula_84. This means that we have constructed a risk-free asset with return formula_85. We can remove each such asset from the market, constructing one risk-free asset for each such asset removed. By the no arbitrage assumption, all their return rates are equal. For the assets that still remain in the market, their covariance matrix is invertible.

==Asset pricing==
The above analysis describes optimal behavior of an individual investor. Asset pricing theory builds on this analysis, allowing MPT to derive the required expected return for a correctly priced asset in this context.

Intuitively (in a perfect market with rational investors), if a security was expensive relative to others - i.e. too much risk for the price - demand would fall and its price would drop correspondingly; if cheap, demand and price would increase likewise. 
This would continue until all such adjustments had ceased - a state of &quot;market equilibrium&quot;.
In this equilibrium, relative supplies will equal relative demands:
given the relationship of price with supply and demand, since the risk-to-reward ratio is &quot;identical&quot; across all securities, proportions of each security in any fully-diversified portfolio would correspondingly be the same as in the overall market.

More formally, then, since everyone holds the risky assets in identical proportions to each other — namely in the proportions given by the tangency portfolio — in market equilibrium the risky assets&#x27; prices, and therefore their expected returns, will adjust so that the ratios in the tangency portfolio are the same as the ratios in which the risky assets are supplied to the market. 
The result for expected return then follows, as below.

===Systematic risk and specific risk===
Specific risk is the risk associated with individual assets - within a portfolio these risks can be reduced through diversification (specific risks &quot;cancel out&quot;). Specific risk is also called diversifiable, unique, unsystematic, or idiosyncratic risk. Systematic risk (a.k.a. portfolio risk or market risk) refers to the risk common to all securities—except for selling short as noted below, systematic risk cannot be diversified away (within one market). Within the market portfolio, asset specific risk will be diversified away to the extent possible. Systematic risk is therefore equated with the risk (standard deviation) of the market portfolio.

Since a security will be purchased only if it improves the risk-expected return characteristics of the market portfolio, the relevant measure of the risk of a security is the risk it adds to the market portfolio, and not its risk in isolation.
In this context, the volatility of the asset, and its correlation with the market portfolio, are historically observed and are therefore given. (There are several approaches to asset pricing that attempt to price assets by modelling the stochastic properties of the moments of assets&#x27; returns - these are broadly referred to as conditional asset pricing models.)

Systematic risks within one market can be managed through a strategy of using both long and short positions within one portfolio, creating a &quot;market neutral&quot; portfolio. Market neutral portfolios, therefore, will be uncorrelated with broader market indices.

===Capital asset pricing model===

The asset return depends on the amount paid for the asset today. The price paid must ensure that the market portfolio&#x27;s risk / return characteristics improve when the asset is added to it. The CAPM is a model that derives the theoretical required expected return (i.e., discount rate) for an asset in a market, given the risk-free rate available to investors and the risk of the market as a whole. The CAPM is usually expressed:

:formula_86

*β, Beta, is the measure of asset sensitivity to a movement in the overall market; Beta is usually found via regression on historical data. Betas exceeding one signify more than average &quot;riskiness&quot; in the sense of the asset&#x27;s contribution to overall portfolio risk; betas below one indicate a lower than average risk contribution.
*formula_87 is the market premium, the expected excess return of the market portfolio&#x27;s expected return over the risk-free rate.

A derivation 
is as follows: 

(1) The incremental impact on risk and expected return when an additional risky asset, a, is added to the market portfolio, m, follows from the formulae for a two-asset portfolio. These results are used to derive the asset-appropriate discount rate.

*Updated portfolio risk = formula_88
::Hence, risk added to portfolio = formula_89
::but since the weight of the asset will be very low re. the overall market, formula_90
::i.e. additional risk = formula_91

*Updated expected return = formula_92
::Hence additional expected return = formula_93

(2) If an asset, a, is correctly priced, the improvement for an investor in her risk-to-expected return ratio achieved by adding it to the market portfolio, m, will at least (in equilibrium, exactly) match the gains of spending that money on an increased stake in the market portfolio. The assumption is that the investor will purchase the asset with funds borrowed at the risk-free rate, formula_31; this is rational if formula_95.

:Thus: formula_96
:i.e.: formula_97
:i.e.: formula_98 

: formula_99 is the &quot;beta&quot;, formula_100 return mentioned — the covariance between the asset&#x27;s return and the market&#x27;s return divided by the variance of the market return — i.e. the sensitivity of the asset price to movement in the market portfolio&#x27;s value (see also ).
This equation can be estimated statistically using the following regression equation:

:formula_101

where α&quot;i&quot; is called the asset&#x27;s alpha, β&quot;i&quot; is the asset&#x27;s beta coefficient and SCL is the security characteristic line.

Once an asset&#x27;s expected return, formula_102, is calculated using CAPM, the future cash flows of the asset can be discounted to their present value using this rate to establish the correct price for the asset. A riskier stock will have a higher beta and will be discounted at a higher rate; less sensitive stocks will have lower betas and be discounted at a lower rate. In theory, an asset is correctly priced when its observed price is the same as its value calculated using the CAPM derived discount rate. If the observed price is higher than the valuation, then the asset is overvalued; it is undervalued for a too low price.

==Criticisms==
Despite its theoretical importance, critics of MPT question whether it is an ideal investment tool, because its model of financial markets does not match the real world in many ways.

The risk, return, and correlation measures used by MPT are based on expected values, which means that they are statistical statements about the future (the expected value of returns is explicit in the above equations, and implicit in the definitions of variance and covariance). Such measures often cannot capture the true statistical features of the risk and return which often follow highly skewed distributions (e.g. the log-normal distribution) and can give rise to, besides reduced volatility, also inflated growth of return. In practice, investors must substitute predictions based on historical measurements of asset return and volatility for these values in the equations. Very often such expected values fail to take account of new circumstances that did not exist when the historical data was generated. An optimal approach to capturing trends, which differs from Markowitz optimization by utilizing invariance properties, is also derived from physics. Instead of transforming the normalized expectations using the inverse of the correlation matrix, the invariant portfolio employs the inverse of the square root of the correlation matrix. The optimization problem is solved under the assumption that expected values are uncertain and correlated. The Markowitz solution corresponds only to the case where the correlation between expected returns is similar to the correlation between returns.

More fundamentally, investors are stuck with estimating key parameters from past market data because MPT attempts to model risk in terms of the likelihood of losses, but says nothing about why those losses might occur. The risk measurements used are probabilistic in nature, not structural. This is a major difference as compared to many engineering approaches to risk management.

Mathematical risk measurements are also useful only to the degree that they reflect investors&#x27; true concerns—there is no point minimizing a variable that nobody cares about in practice. In particular, variance is a symmetric measure that counts abnormally high returns as just as risky as abnormally low returns. The psychological phenomenon of loss aversion is the idea that investors are more concerned about losses than gains, meaning that our intuitive concept of risk is fundamentally asymmetric in nature. There many other risk measures (like coherent risk measures) might better reflect investors&#x27; true preferences.

Modern portfolio theory has also been criticized because it assumes that returns follow a Gaussian distribution. Already in the 1960s, Benoit Mandelbrot and Eugene Fama showed the inadequacy of this assumption and proposed the use of more general stable distributions instead. Stefan Mittnik and Svetlozar Rachev presented strategies for deriving optimal portfolios in such settings. More recently, Nassim Nicholas Taleb has also criticized modern portfolio theory on this ground, writing:

Contrarian investors and value investors typically do not subscribe to Modern Portfolio Theory. One objection is that the MPT relies on the efficient-market hypothesis and uses fluctuations in share price as a substitute for risk. Sir John Templeton believed in diversification as a concept, but also felt the theoretical foundations of MPT were questionable, and concluded (as described by a biographer): &quot;the notion that building portfolios on the basis of unreliable and irrelevant statistical inputs, such as historical volatility, was doomed to failure.&quot;

A few studies have argued that &quot;naive diversification&quot;, splitting capital equally among available investment options, might have advantages over MPT in some situations.

When applied to certain universes of assets, the Markowitz model has been identified by academics to be inadequate due to its susceptibility to model instability which may arise, for example, among a universe of highly correlated assets.

==Extensions==

Since MPT&#x27;s introduction in 1952, many attempts have been made to improve the model, especially by using more realistic assumptions.

Post-modern portfolio theory extends MPT by adopting non-normally distributed, asymmetric, and fat-tailed measures of risk. This helps with some of these problems, but not others.

Black–Litterman model optimization is an extension of unconstrained Markowitz optimization that incorporates relative and absolute &#x27;views&#x27; on inputs of risk and returns from.

The model is also extended by assuming that expected returns are uncertain, and the correlation matrix in this case can differ from the correlation matrix between returns.

==Connection with rational choice theory==

Modern portfolio theory is inconsistent with main axioms of rational choice theory, most notably with monotonicity axiom, stating that, if investing into portfolio &quot;X&quot; will, with probability one, return more money than investing into portfolio &quot;Y&quot;, then a rational investor should prefer &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;. In contrast, modern portfolio theory is based on a different axiom, called variance aversion,
and may recommend to invest into &quot;Y&quot; on the basis that it has lower variance. Maccheroni et al. described choice theory which is the closest possible to the modern portfolio theory, while satisfying monotonicity axiom. Alternatively, mean-deviation analysis
is a rational choice theory resulting from replacing variance by an appropriate deviation risk measure.

==Other applications==

In the 1970s, concepts from MPT found their way into the field of regional science. In a series of seminal works, Michael Conroy modeled the labor force in the economy using portfolio-theoretic methods to examine growth and variability in the labor force. This was followed by a long literature on the relationship between economic growth and volatility.

More recently, modern portfolio theory has been used to model the self-concept in social psychology. When the self attributes comprising the self-concept constitute a well-diversified portfolio, then psychological outcomes at the level of the individual such as mood and self-esteem should be more stable than when the self-concept is undiversified. This prediction has been confirmed in studies involving human subjects.

Recently, modern portfolio theory has been applied to modelling the uncertainty and correlation between documents in information retrieval. Given a query, the aim is to maximize the overall relevance of a ranked list of documents and at the same time minimize the overall uncertainty of the ranked list.

===Project portfolios and other &quot;non-financial&quot; assets===
Some experts apply MPT to portfolios of projects and other assets besides financial instruments. When MPT is applied outside of traditional financial portfolios, some distinctions between the different types of portfolios must be considered.

# The assets in financial portfolios are, for practical purposes, continuously divisible while portfolios of projects are &quot;lumpy&quot;. For example, while we can compute that the optimal portfolio position for 3 stocks is, say, 44%, 35%, 21%, the optimal position for a project portfolio may not allow us to simply change the amount spent on a project. Projects might be all or nothing or, at least, have logical units that cannot be separated. A portfolio optimization method would have to take the discrete nature of projects into account.
# The assets of financial portfolios are liquid; they can be assessed or re-assessed at any point in time. But opportunities for launching new projects may be limited and may occur in limited windows of time. Projects that have already been initiated cannot be abandoned without the loss of the sunk costs (i.e., there is little or no recovery/salvage value of a half-complete project).

Neither of these necessarily eliminate the possibility of using MPT and such portfolios. They simply indicate the need to run the optimization with an additional set of mathematically expressed constraints that would not normally apply to financial portfolios.

Furthermore, some of the simplest elements of Modern Portfolio Theory are applicable to virtually any kind of portfolio. The concept of capturing the risk tolerance of an investor by documenting how much risk is acceptable for a given return may be applied to a variety of decision analysis problems. MPT uses historical variance as a measure of risk, but portfolios of assets like major projects do not have a well-defined &quot;historical variance&quot;. In this case, the MPT investment boundary can be expressed in more general terms like &quot;chance of an ROI less than cost of capital&quot; or &quot;chance of losing more than half of the investment&quot;. When risk is put in terms of uncertainty about forecasts and possible losses then the concept is transferable to various types of investment.

<doc id="734443" wikidata="Q2289646" url="?curid=734443" title="Isleham">
<text>Isleham is a village and civil parish in the English county of Cambridgeshire. It is part of the Fens. It has three pubs.

==Geography==
Isleham is located in the Fens of south-east Cambridgeshire. The western parish boundary is formed by the Crooked Ditch or Crooked Drain, the eastern boundary largely by the Lea Brook and the north by the River Lark. The village lies on the B1104 from Prickwillow to Chippenham. Isleham is twinned with Nesles in France and Magdala in Germany. 

==Amenities==
The village has a Co-op supermarket and Post Office. There are three public houses - The Griffin, The Merry Monk and the Rising Sun - and three churches: St Andrew&#x27;s Church of England parish church, plfc (Pound Lane Free Church) and the Ark Church.

==Archaeology==

The region between Devil&#x27;s Dyke and the line between Littleport and Shippea Hill shows a remarkable amount of archaeological findings of the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age
. Findings in Isleham include the Isleham Hoard of more than 6500 pieces of bronze, both manufactured articles and fragments of sheet bronze, all dating from the late Bronze Age, and discovered by Bill Houghton and his brother, Arthur.

==Genealogy==
Following a landscaping project, plfc (Pound Lane Free Church) have made listings and photographs of the graveyard headstones available via an on-line library.

==History==
Its name seems to come from Anglo-Saxon &quot;Gísla hám&quot; = &quot;the home of the hostages&quot;. It seems that in Anglo-Saxon societies the position of a hostage from one political group held by another political group, was sometimes more or less voluntary, and the meaning of the word could slip into &quot;representative&quot;.
The Priory of St Margaret of Antioch was founded in the village in 1090. It was always an alien priory run directly from France and, as such, was dissolved in 1414. It was later used as a barn and is now looked after by English Heritage.

St Andrew&#x27;s parish church is a Grade I listed building. It was the burial site for ancestors of the Peyton family. Descendants of Peytons visit the church and obtain rubbings of the brasses decorating the Peyton monuments. The church continues to be restored with the help of donations from Peyton families in the UK and USA. Isleham Hall on West Street is a building associated with the Peyton family, and dating from the 16th century.

On 3 May 1850 Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon was baptised in the river Lark. A stone marks the location.

== Culture ==
In 1975 Mary Chamberlain published the book &quot;Fenwomen&quot;, an account of the lives of women in the village of Gislea - which was a pseudonym for Isleham.

In 2015, English rapper Dirty Dike released his fourth album which included a track entitled &quot;Isleham Swamp&quot;. Dirty Dike has referenced Cambridgeshire and the Fenland in several of his tracks.

<doc id="734449" wikidata="Q7841511" url="?curid=734449" title="Trifocal lenses">
<text>Trifocals are eyeglasses with lenses that have three regions which correct for distance, intermediate (arm&#x27;s length), and near vision. John Isaac Hawkins developed the trifocal lens in 1827.

Trifocals are mostly used by people with advanced presbyopia who have been prescribed 2 diopters or more of reading addition. The intermediate addition is normally half the reading addition. So, for someone with a distance prescription of −4 diopters and a reading addition of +3, the reading portion of their trifocals would have a net power of −1, and the intermediate segment would be −2.5 diopters. 

Trifocal lenses are made in similar styles to bifocals, but with an additional segment for intermediate vision above the reading section. A common style is the 7×28 flat-top or D-shaped segment, 28 mm wide, with a 7 mm high intermediate segment. Larger intermediate segments are available, and are particularly useful for people who spend a lot of time using computers.

Trifocals are becoming rarer as more people choose to wear progressive lenses.

<doc id="734489" wikidata="Q750053" url="?curid=734489" title="Homecoming">
<text>Homecoming is the tradition of welcoming back alumni or other former members of an organization to celebrate the organization&#x27;s existence. It is a tradition in many high schools, colleges, and churches in the United States and Canada.

==United States==
Homecoming is an annual tradition in the United States. People, towns, high schools and colleges come together, usually in late September or early October, to welcome back former members of the community. It is built around a central event, such as a banquet or dance and, most often, a game of American football, or on occasions, basketball, ice hockey or soccer. When celebrated by schools, the activities vary widely. However, they usually consist of a football game played on a school&#x27;s home football field, activities for students and alumni, a parade featuring the school&#x27;s choir, marching band and sports teams, and the coronation of a homecoming queen (and at many schools, a homecoming king). A dance commonly follows the game or takes place the day after the game.

When attached to a football game, homecoming traditionally occurs on the team&#x27;s return from the longest road trip of the season or the first home game of a season that falls after an away game. The game itself, whether it be football or another sport, will typically feature the home team playing a considerably weaker opponent. The game is supposed to be an &quot;easy win&quot; and thus weaker schools will sometimes play lower division schools.

===Origins===
The tradition of homecoming has its origin in alumni football games held at colleges and universities since the 19th century. Many schools including Baylor, Illinois, Missouri and Southwestern have claimed that they began homecoming. &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; give the title to the University of Missouri&#x27;s 1911 football game during which alumni were encouraged to attend. It appears to be the first homecoming event which included both a parade and an intercollegiate football game; such was the response and success that it became an annual event.

In 1891, the Missouri Tigers first faced off against the Kansas Jayhawks in the first installment of the Border War, the oldest college football rivalry west of the Mississippi River. The intense rivalry originally took place at neutral sites, usually in Kansas City, Missouri, until a new conference regulation was announced that required intercollegiate football games to be played on collegiate campuses. To renew excitement in the rivalry, ensure adequate attendance at the new location, and celebrate the first meeting of the two teams on the Mizzou campus in Columbia, Missouri, Mizzou Athletic Director Chester Brewer invited all alumni to &quot;come home&quot; for the game in 1911. Along with the football game, the celebration included a parade and spirit rally with a bonfire. The event was a success, with nearly 10,000 alumni coming home to take part in the celebration and watch the Tigers and Jayhawks play to a 3–3 tie. The Missouri annual homecoming, with its parade and spirit rally centered on a large football game is the model that has gone on to take hold at colleges and high schools across the United States.

At least two colleges claim homecoming intercollegiate football games before the University of Missouri 1911 football game homecoming event: Baylor University, in Waco, Texas and the University of Illinois in Urbana, Illinois.

Baylor&#x27;s homecoming history dates back to November 1909 and included a parade, reunion parties, and an afternoon football game (the final game of the 1909 season), a tradition that continued and celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2009. There was a gap between 1910 and 1915 when there was no homecoming event; however there has been continuity since 1915.

In 1910, University of Illinois held a weeklong homecoming celebration which concluded with an intercollegiate football game. With the exception of the 1918 influenza pandemic year, it has been annual event since then.

Although it did not initially include an intercollegiate football game, Northern Illinois University has one of the longest-celebrated homecoming traditions in the country. The alumni football game played on October 10, 1903, began NIU&#x27;s homecoming tradition.

Although it did not include an intercollegiate football game, Southwestern held its first Homecoming on Wednesday, April 21, 1909, in San Gabriel Park. Former students raised funds, provided homes, prepared and served a barbecue supper, and decorated the town buildings. Members of the senior class waited tables.

===Traditions===

====Homecoming court====

The backings court is a representative group of students that, in a coeducational institution, consists of a king and queen, and possibly prince(s) and princess(es). In a single-sex institution, the homecoming court will usually consist of only a king and a prince (for an all-male school) or a queen and a princess (for an all-female school), although some schools may choose to join with single-sex schools of the other sex to elect the homecoming court jointly.

Generally, the king and queen are students completing their final years of study at their school (also called &quot;seniors&quot;), while the prince and princess are underclassmen often with a prince/princess for each grade. Recently, some high schools have chosen to add categories, such as Duke and Duchess, to extend the representation of students to include a category in which students with special needs are elected. In high school, 17- or 18-year-old students in their final year are represented by a king or queen; in college, students who are completing their final year of study, usually between 21–23 years old.

Local rules determine when the homecoming king and queen are crowned. Sometimes, the big announcement comes at a pep rally, school assembly, or public ceremony one or more days before the football game. Other schools crown their royalty at the homecoming football game, a dance, or other school events.

Often, the previous year&#x27;s king and queen are invited back to crown their successors. If they are absent for whatever reason, someone else—usually, another previous king or queen, a popular teacher, or a royal representative—will perform those duties. Usually, the queen is crowned first, followed by the king. The crowning method also varies by school, however, the crown is typically preserved and passed down to each successor.

Homecoming court members who are not crowned king or queen are often called escorts or royalty. They are often expected to participate in the week&#x27;s activities as well. At some schools, a homecoming prince/princess, duke/duchess, etc. (often underclassmen nominated by their classmates) are crowned along with the king and queen; sometimes, middle school and junior high students may partake in the high school activities.

====Parade====
Many homecoming celebrations include a parade. Students often select the grand marshal based on a history of service and support to the school and community. The parade includes the school&#x27;s marching band and different school organizations’ floats created by the classes and organizations and most of the sports get a chance to be in the parade. Every class prepares a float which corresponds with the homecoming theme or related theme of school spirit as assigned by school administrators. In addition, the homecoming court takes part in the parade, often riding together in one or more convertibles as part of the parade. Community civic organizations and businesses, area fire departments, and alumni groups often participate as well. The parade is often part of a series of activities scheduled for that specific day, which can also include a pep rally, bonfire, snake dance, and other activities for students and alumni.

====Tailgate====
At most major colleges and universities, the football game and preceding tailgate party are the most widely recognized and heavily attended events of the week. Alumni gather from all around the world to return to their alma mater, reconnect with one another, and take part in the festivities. Students, alumni, businesses, and members of the community set up tents in parking lots, fields, and streets near the stadium to cook food, play games, socialize, binge drink, and even enjoy live music in many instances. These celebrations often last straight through the game for those who do not have tickets but still come to take part in the socializing and excitement of the homecoming atmosphere. Most tents even include television or radio feeds of the game for those without tickets.

====Picnic====
Sometimes during the school week, a picnic can occur. The picnic is very similar to the tailgate party, but it occurs after school or during the school&#x27;s lunch period.

====Dress-up days====
Throughout the week, many schools (particularly high schools) engage in special dress-up days, sometimes called &quot;Spirit Week&quot;, where students are allowed to wear clothing suitable to the theme (e.g., 1980s day, toga day, roll out of bed day, cowboy day, nerd day, pirate day, meme day, Rat Pack Day, flannel Friday, What-not-to-wear Wednesday) leading to the homecoming. Students traditionally wear clothing with their school&#x27;s name, or clothing and makeup of their school&#x27;s colors on Friday.

====Pep rallies====
Many schools hold a rally during homecoming week, often one or more nights before the game. The events vary, but may include skits, games, introduction of the homecoming court (and coronation of the king and queen if that is the school&#x27;s tradition), and comments from the football players or coach about the upcoming game.

At some schools, the homecoming rally ends with a bonfire (in which old wood structures, the rival school&#x27;s memorabilia and other items are burned in a controlled fire). Many colleges and high schools no longer hold bonfires because of accidents that have occurred surrounding these events in the past. The most well known accident took place in 1999, when 12 students were killed and 27 others were injured at Texas A&amp;M University when a pile of logs that had been assembled for a bonfire collapsed. However, this incident was not associated with homecoming—A&amp;M is one of the few schools that do not organize a homecoming, although it has many unique traditions. The bonfire was associated with the annual rivalry game between A&amp;M and the University of Texas.

====Alumni band====
The alumni band consists of former college and university band members who return for homecoming to perform with the current marching band (usually made up of recent graduates to members who graduated years or decades before) either during halftime as a full band or a featured section, e.g. the trumpet section or the tubas and drumline squads, as well as performing with the current band during the post-game concert.

====Homecoming dance====

The homecoming dance—usually the culminating event of the week (for high schools)—is a formal or informal event, either at the school or an off-campus location. The venue is decorated, and either a disc jockey or band is hired to play music. In many ways, it is a fall prom. Homecoming dances could be informal as well just like standard school dances. At high schools, the homecoming dances are sometimes held in the high school gymnasium or outside in a large field. Homecoming dance attire is less formal than prom. Females generally wear knee-length dresses with their hair down, and males generally wear a tucked-in dress shirt with pants. At prom, females generally wear a more formal gown that goes to the ground with hair up, and males wear suits and tuxedos.

Since most colleges are too large to facilitate a campus-wide dance, these events are usually handled instead by student organizations such as fraternities, sororities, and residential colleges. Because football and alumni events are the focal points of collegiate homecoming, dances often take place during a different week when schedules are more permitting, or not at all.

===Competitions===
At the high school level, students generally compete by grade level in events such as the spirit days, parade floats, and powder puff football. The competition at the collegiate level is mainly between Greek-letter organizations and, to a lesser degree, residence halls. At most larger schools, fraternities and sororities compete on parade floats, house decorations, skits, talent competitions, and service events such as blood drives or food drives. On coronation night, some schools play games between classes. Such events include the pyramid, three-legged race, pop chug, and tug of war.

===Smaller school homecomings===
While most schools schedule their homecoming activities around football, smaller schools that do not have a football team may plan the annual event at another time of the year. In these instances, basketball, ice hockey or soccer serves as the &quot;big boy game&quot; for students and alumni. Often in smaller towns with smaller populations, the parade is omitted.

At schools without athletic programs, the centerpiece event is usually a banquet, where alumni are recognized. This format is also used for alumni events of high schools that have either closed or consolidated with other high schools; the high school classes continue to meet and celebrate their years at their now-defunct alma mater. In other cases, alumni of closed schools will participate in the consolidated school&#x27;s homecoming, where special recognition is often given for alumni of the once-separate schools.

===Courtwarming===
In some parts of the United States, high school basketball has gained a homecoming celebration of its own. Often referred to as &quot;court warming&quot; or &quot;winter homecoming&quot;, but also regerred &quot;hoopcoming&quot;, &quot;coronation&quot;, &quot;snowcoming&quot;, &quot;Colors Day&quot;, it usually includes rallies, dress-up days, special dinners, king and queen coronations, and other winter-friendly activities typically associated with football homecoming.

==Canada==
Canadian homecoming weekends are less common than in the United States, but do take place in some areas.

In Newfoundland and Labrador, communities have a &quot;Come Home Year&quot; where people who have moved away from their town come back from across Canada. In 2000, there was a provincial &quot;Come Home Year&quot;, where many people came back to visit their various communities.

===High school===
Homecomings are rare in Canada, and typically only take place in high schools situated in the east of the country. Newmarket High School, London South Collegiate Institute, Banting Memorial High School, Earl Haig Secondary School and St. Michael&#x27;s College School are examples of schools in Ontario known to arrange homecomings. Upper Canada College also has a longstanding homecoming tradition, although the event is referred to as &quot;A-Day&quot; (Association Day). St. Thomas More Collegiate in Burnaby, British Columbia hosts a Homecoming Event on the third Saturday of September and New Westminster Secondary School hosts a Homecoming Event on the fourth Saturday of September.

===University===
Some universities in Canada are also known to host Homecomings, although these are rarely as high profile as in the United States. They generally take place in September. Universities such as The University of Guelph, Western University, Concordia University, Queen&#x27;s University, and The University of British Columbia have hosted homecomings in the past.

Unsanctioned street parties in celebration of Homecoming weekend, known colloquially as &quot;hoco&quot;, occur every year at Queen&#x27;s University, Wilfred Laurier University, McMaster University, Dalhousie University, and the University of Western Ontario. When the date of homecoming lands on reading week, an unsanctioned party known as &quot;foco&quot;, or &quot;fake homecoming&quot; will occur instead. 

== Church homecomings ==
The term &quot;homecoming&quot; can also refer to the special services conducted by some religious congregations, particularly by many smaller American Protestant churches, to celebrate church heritage and welcome back former members or pastors. They are often held annually, but are sometimes held as one-time-only events, to celebrate the occasion.

<doc id="734496" wikidata="Q4736567" url="?curid=734496" title="Alternative universe (fan fiction)">
<text>An alternative universe (also known as AU, alternate universe, alternative timeline, alternate timeline, alternative reality, alternate reality, parallel universe, or multiverse) is a setting for a work of fan fiction that departs from the canon of the fictional universe that the fan work is based on. For example, an AU fan fiction might imagine what would have taken place if the plot events of the source material had unfolded differently, or it might transpose the characters from the original work into a different setting to explore their lives and relationships in a different narrative context. Unlike typical fan fiction, which generally remains within the boundaries of the canon set out by the source material, alternative universe fan fiction writers explore the possibilities of pivotal changes made to characters&#x27; history, motivations, or environment, often combining material from multiple sources for inspiration. Characters&#x27; known motivations may vary considerably from their decisions in the canonical universe. The author of an alternative universe story thus can use the same characters, but send them down different paths to achieve a completely different plot.

AU stories are also sometimes used in official, though typically non-canonical, story lines, written by the creators of the original canon material.

==Types==
===Alternative timelines===
Stories with alternative timelines follow the established canon before veering away at a crucial moment, similar in concept to many entries in Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;What If&quot; series and DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Elseworlds&quot; series. Some alternative timeline stories are called &quot;fix-it fiction&quot; because they rewrite the story so that the consequences of certain events are undone, although beginning events are the same. Another example of a sub genre of the alternative timeline story is called a &quot;do-over fiction&quot;, similar to &quot;fix-it fiction&quot; in which consequences of an event are undone, but in do-over fictions particularly the entire story is reset to the beginning, and the author creates an alternate timeline that diverges from the original canon of the work.

===Plot switch===
Plot switch stories take the characters from a series and place them in another time, place, or situation. A subset of this type called &quot;familiar plot switch&quot; takes the characters from a series and places them in a setting more familiar to the author. This type of context shift is one of the main sources of &quot;high school fiction&quot; in which all the characters are written going to high school.

===&quot;Reality&quot; swaps===
In a reality-swap alternative universe the actors in a movie or television show may find themselves in the fictional universe or the fictional characters may find themselves in the &quot;real&quot; universe. This type of AU has appeared in mainstream publications as well. Fiction using real characters and borrowing from the 19th century include &quot;Edison&#x27;s Conquest of Mars&quot; and &quot;Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper&quot;. Among some fans of the 2010s game Undertale, &#x27;UnderSwap&#x27; is the common name for an AU in which all the characters&#x27; personalities are swapped with what the fandom believes to be their opposite.

In &quot;Star Trek&quot; short stories written in the early 1970s, the actors from the Desilu set were swapped with the &quot;real life&quot; Starfleet officers via the transporter (&quot;Visit To A Weird Planet&quot;; &quot;Visit To A Weird Planet, Revisited&quot;). These fan fiction stories were later published in official &quot;Star Trek&quot; books.

This concept was also used in an episode of &quot;Supernatural&quot;, &quot;The French Mistake&quot; (Season 6, Episode 15). In the episode, the main characters Sam and Dean are transported to an alternative universe where they are the actual actors, actors named Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, respectively, on a television show called &quot;Supernatural&quot;.

===Crossovers===
This type of alternative universe places two fictional universes in a situation where they interact, similar to reality swaps (which mix a fictional universe with the real world). Such stories sometimes involve &quot;comparisons or conflict&quot; between the combat prowess of the two universes, often involving the various strengths and weaknesses of the technology/magic of each world. This genre of fan fiction is distinct from plot switch in the fact that it usually involves characters from at least two separate series interacting with one another. Sometimes these stories involve the substitution of characters from one universe for those of another. Examples include &quot;Sherlock Holmes Versus Arsène Lupin&quot;, &quot;Sherlock Holmes vs. Dracula&quot; and &quot;Sherlock Holmes&#x27; War of the Worlds&quot;.

===Predictive fiction===
Alternative universes can arise inadvertently in fan fiction when the source material is released in a serial form (such as a multi-season television series or a book trilogy) so that fan works are written before further canonical information arrives. For instance, much &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fan fiction written in the nearly three years between the publication of &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; was written as &quot;continuation&quot; fan fiction, but became AU as soon as the new canonical material appeared.

== Diversity and Representation ==

=== Importance ===
Representation in media is important because it can shape our perception of ourselves and change how and what we value about ourselves. Because of this, accurate representation of communities in media is important. Alternative Universes in fan fiction can provide a platform for writers to explore different ways of accurately representing their favorite characters. This allows the writers of these fan fictions to deviate from the source material in ways that challenge the existing storylines and highlight underrepresented voices. Because of this, Alternative Universes can play a role in highlighting diversity and representations.

=== Examples ===
The writers of the  What If...? (TV series) show that is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe explore these different representations in multiple ways. In the 1st episode of the series, What If... Captain Carter Were the First Avenger?, the MCU explores female representation by creating a universe where a female character is the First Avenger in place of a man.

<text>Patou, formerly known as Jean Patou or Jean Patou Paris, is a French fashion house. 

== History ==

The company was originally created by Jean Patou in 1914 and was eponymously named. After his premature death in 1936, his sister Madeleine and her husband Raymond Barbas continued running the business.

From 1919 the business designed and produced haute couture, ready-to-wear and perfume. In 1987, the haute couture activity was stopped. The same year, the Jean Patou house launched an accessories line, the artistic direction of which was entrusted to Peggy Huynh Kinh. By 1996 the company had closed.

Patou was acquired by Procter &amp; Gamble in 2001. In 2011 it was bought by Designer Parfums Ltd, a UK-based firm. 

In September 2018, the LVMH group announced a strategic partnership with Designer Parfums Ltd, assimilating majority shares in the Jean Patou portfolio. As soon as the partnership was announced, LVMH relaunched the brand&#x27;s couture activity, renamed &quot;Patou&quot;, and appointed Guillaume Henry as artistic director. The brand&#x27;s flagship fragrance, JOY, known since the 1929 crisis as ‘the most expensive perfume in the world’, disappeared so that the name could be reassigned to a new Dior product. The brand&#x27;s other fragrances were also discontinued.

<doc id="734513" wikidata="Q18691222" url="?curid=734513" title="Eastern Finnish dialects">
<text>Eastern Finnish dialects are chiefly vested in the Savonians (the Savonian dialects) and the Karelians (the southeast Finnish dialects). One of the Finnish language spoken group, the North Karelian, represents the East Finnish dialects, however this distinction is not established in any case. Other dialects, such as the North Finnish dialects, are considered as East or West Finnish dialects. Kalevala, one of the earliest and most significant works of Finnish literature, was written in East Finnish and East Finnish features were used extensively in the Finnish language standardization.

There is less influence from Scandinavian and Finland-Swedish culture and language. The language is distinguished by vowel-diphthong shifts with respect to the standard language, and the use of palatalization. Epenthetic vowels are added after /l/, /h/ and sometimes /n/ in stressed syllable coda preceding a consonant (e.g. – ), but this feature is not distinguishing, being also found commonly in most Western Finnish dialects.

==Subdivisions==
*Savo Finnish (the Savonian dialects) . There are major differences between different Savo dialects. For example, North Savo has different personal pronouns from South Savo.
*Karelian Finnish (the southeast Finnish dialects)
*Some dialects of the Karelian language spoken within the former borders (1920 peace) are sometimes classified as &quot;border Karelian dialects&quot; (&quot;Raja-Karjalan murteet&quot;)

<text>Since the beginning of Dadaism in the Cabaret Voltaire, Zürich in 1916, many artists have experimented with extreme [[performance art]] as a critique of contemporary consumer culture. Some have used bodily fluids such as blood, faeces and urine. Other times they perform self-mutilation. Simulated (artificial) blood has also been used. In the 1960s and 1970s extreme performance was elevated to a movement with the Viennese actionists. In recent times there has been a resurgence in extreme performance as a response to the increasing alienation some artists feel in the face of today&#x27;s technological advances.

==Artists==
Some contemporary artists using extreme performance include:
* Ron Athey
* Abel Azcona
* Franko B
* Bob Flanagan
* Yang Zhichao
* Rocío Boliver
* monochrom, e.g. Eignblunzn, Buried Alive (performance)

<text>Luis Carlos Restrepo Ramírez (born 24 January 1954) is a Colombian psychiatrist and philosopher, who served as the 5th High Commissioner for Peace of Colombia from August 2002 to March 2009.

While in Office, he was in charge of the controversial demobilization and disarmament of 32,000 paramilitaries of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia and 13,000 guerrilla fighters.

For some time, the Government of Colombia considered him a fugitive, after the Supreme Court of Justice of Colombia issued an international arrest warrant after Restrepo left the country on 8 January 2012 on a flight bound to the United States; his current whereabouts remain unknown, but he is presumed to have obtained political asylum in Canada.
Restrepo, who was accused of faking the demobilization of a FARC military unit in 2006, is charged by the Office of the Attorney General of Colombia with conspiracy to commit crime; embezzlement; and arms possession, trafficking, and manufacturing. Restrepo, who was one of the closest allies of the President Álvaro Uribe Vélez, has denied the allegations made against him, and accused the Administration of President Juan Manuel Santos Calderón of mounting a political persecution against him; in this he receives the backing and support of former President Uribe. However, on September 23, 2013, Colombia&#x27;s Prosecutor General dropped the arrest warrant against Restrepo.

From his exile, Restrepo has shown support for the current Peace talks of President Juan Manuel Santos with FARC rebels.

==Personal life==
Luis Carlos was born on 24 January 1954 in Filandia, Caldas Department to Carlos E. Restrepo Ramírez and Soledad Ramírez Ospina.

<doc id="734526" wikidata="Q2148436" url="?curid=734526" title="Capel St Mary">
<text>Capel St Mary – commonly known as Capel – is a village and civil parish in the Babergh district, in the county of Suffolk, England. It is about south-west of Ipswich and from Dedham Vale, which is a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. In 2011 the parish had a population of 2847.

==History==
===Early history===
The village was listed in the Domesday Book as part of the manor of Boynton. An early 13th-century charter from nearby Dodnash Priory was the first to mention it by its current name, derived from the Norman-French and Welsh &quot;capel&quot;, meaning chapel.

Tentative evidence of Bronze Age habitation has recently been unearthed just outside the boundaries of the village, and well-documented human settlement in the area dates from the Roman period. Evidence of a villa was found while building council houses on Windmill Hill at the west end of the village in the 1930s, with remains of a kiln nearby and smaller artefacts such as coins and tiles.

A fortified house was built in nearby Little Wenham between 1260 and 1290. It is believed to be one of the first examples of fortified houses made from English brick.

===Rail===
A railway station was built as part of the Hadleigh branch line in 1847. The station was closed to passengers in 1932 but freight services continued until 1965, when the line was closed as a result of the Beeching Axe.

The village was birthplace in 1859 of Lieutenant-General Sir Edwin Alderson, first commander of the Canadian Expeditionary Force of World War I.

===20th century===

During the second World War, the village was frequented by American airmen from nearby RAF Raydon. Men from the village were involved in two local Auxiliary Units, Wenham and Capel, part of the 202nd battalion of the Home Guard. The Wenham unit was based at a dugout under Jermyn&#x27;s Farm to the north of the village, and a dugout a short distance away housed their supply of explosives. The Capel unit was based in woods near Bentley; the three dugouts at their disposal housed ammunition, a field telephone, and their supplies of gelignite and plastic explosive. The explosives were destroyed in-situ after the end of hostilities because they were deemed too dangerous to move.

In 1960, initial plans were drawn up for significant housing development and mains sewerage in the village – the latter was needed following the introduction of mains water in 1951. These were finalised by 1963, initiating an expansion of the village from some 632 people in 1961 to a peak of 3,176 people in 1991. The new houses were built with an open-plan design: front gardens were not to be enclosed, and grass verges were to separate fences from the pavement. Plans for the village shopping centre were approved in 1974.

==Facilities==
Most facilities are located in the centre of the village, including the Co-Op and independent shops such as a bakery, hairdresser, and a newsagent. There is also a post office and doctors&#x27; surgery with a pharmacy.

Capel&#x27;s one pub, the &quot;White Horse&quot;, with a petrol station, is found at the east end of the village. A second pub, &quot;The Plough&quot;, closed in 1996. Capel also has a bar in the heart of the village near the shops attached to the village hall, providing entertainment such as tribute acts, Bingo and an annual Bar Olympics.

===Recreation===
The large playing field which includes football pitches, tennis courts, a cricket ground and a bowling green. There is also a children&#x27;s playground at the same site. A fireworks display is held here annually on the 5 November. The pitches are home to Capel Plough F.C., which plays in the Suffolk and Ipswich Football League. The village hall and the attached bar are used by many societies. These are maintained by the Capel Community Trust

There is a Scout troop based in the village, with its own HQ and close to 100 members in January 2013.

===Education===
The village has a primary school. Most pupils then go to East Bergholt High School, or to selective or private secondary schools in nearby Ipswich or Colchester.

===Religious sites===
The village is in the Anglican parish of Capel St Mary with Little Wenham and Great Wenham. Construction of the parish church of St Mary, Virgin and Mother, began in the early 13th century, but most of it dates from the 15th century. However, the churchyard was found to contain Roman cremation urns, when digging took place for a northern extension in the late 1990s.

The village has a Methodist church and a Community church. The three churches are active and work closely together. Roman Catholic services were also being conducted in St Mary&#x27;s, but declining numbers of priests meant this ceased to be feasible. The nearest Catholic services are in Ipswich and Brantham.

===Transport===
Capel sits next to the A12 road, which links the village to Ipswich and Colchester. There is a local bus service. 

==Demography==

According to the Office for National Statistics, the United Kingdom Census 2001 found a population of 2,877 in Capel St Mary.

<text>Melbourne Park is a sports venue in the Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Precinct in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Since 1988, Australia&#x27;s bicentenary, Melbourne Park has been home of the Australian Open Grand Slam tennis tournament played annually in January. The park has multiple venues where the Australian Open matches take place. Rod Laver Arena is the largest venue with a capacity of 15,000, while John Cain Arena seats 10,500 and Margaret Court Arena 7,500. The three venues feature retractable roofs, allowing events to be played indoors or outdoors. Other venues include Show Court 3 and 1573 Arena which both have a 3,000 seating capacity, and the new 5,000-seat Kia Arena, which opened in 2022. In total there are 35 outdoor Greenset tennis courts at Melbourne Park.

Melbourne Park is owned by the Victorian Government and managed by the Melbourne &amp; Olympic Parks Trust, which also runs the adjacent Melbourne Rectangular Stadium. The Yarra Park section of the Sports and Entertainment Precinct is run separately.

==History==
The park was originally known as Flinders Park until 1996, when then-premier Jeff Kennett decided to change the name to Melbourne Park, mainly to advertise the name &quot;Melbourne&quot; to a wide international audience during events held there. The decision was met with opposition, and was compared by some to renaming Stade Roland Garros (home to the French Open in Paris) &quot;Paris Park&quot;. However, over the years, the name has become accepted by Melburnians.

Melbourne Park was developed in 1988 beside the Jolimont Yard as a new precinct to host the Australian Open. The previous venue, Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club, had become too small for the burgeoning tournament. Construction of the park was completed in 1988 at a cost of at least $94 million. The unveiling of the new precinct was met with incredibly positive reviews by players and spectators, with some labelling the facilities and amenities the best of the four Grand Slams. Another expansion of the precinct occurred in 1996, when a further $23 million was invested to create two fully seated and larger show courts and eight new courts, as well as a large grassy space, now known as Grand Slam Oval.

The organisation responsible for managing the precinct is the Melbourne &amp; Olympic Parks Trust, which was established in October 1995 in accordance with the provisions of the amended Melbourne &amp; Olympic Parks Act 1985. In April 2018, Tennis Australia revealed it harboured ambitions to take over management rights of the entire precinct, with the hope of maximising its use for other sporting and cultural events outside of the Australian Open.

==Events==
While it is best known for being a tennis venue, Melbourne Park also plays host to a number of other sports and musical events throughout the year. The venue tends to be used by more popular international performers, as it is the largest the city has to offer, excluding the Docklands Stadium in the Docklands and the nearby Melbourne Cricket Ground. All three stadium courts/arenas are multi-purpose, being used for a variety of events, including the Australian Open commitments in January, but the Rod Laver Arena and Margaret Court Arena venues are most commonly used for music concerts. 

Aside from the tennis tournament, which typically attracts crowds in excess of 800,000, the park has facilities that allows other sports to be played regularly at Melbourne Park&#x27;s arenas, such as netball (Super Netball teams, Melbourne Vixens and Collingwood Magpies play home matches at John Cain Arena and Margaret Court Arena) and basketball (National Basketball League team Melbourne United play home matches at John Cain Arena). In the past Melbourne Park has hosted ice skating, track cycling, international swimming and motorsport events.

The Australian Open presented pickleball for the first time at the 2025 Australian Open. From January 24 to the 26th the AO Pickleball Slam tournament was held on Court 3. One hundred thousand dollars in prize money was awarded to some of Australia&#x27;s top professional pickleball players.

==Arenas and facilities==
Melbourne Park is the only Grand Slam tennis venue to have three courts installed with a retractable roof, allowing play to continue in the event of rain or extreme heat. The courts were Plexicushion from 2008 to 2019.

===Rod Laver Arena===
Formerly known as Centre Court, Rod Laver Arena has a capacity of nearly 15,000 and has a retractable roof. The arena was opened in 1988 prior to that year&#x27;s championships and was originally known as the National Tennis Centre at Flinders Park. It was not until January 2000 that the arena was named after one of the greatest Australian tennis players, Rod Laver.

Rod Laver Arena has played host to some of the most memorable tennis matches, such as:
* Rafael Nadal vs. Roger Federer (2009 &amp; 2017 finals) – The Federer-Nadal rivalry includes two finals at the Australian Open, each eight years apart and shared equally between the pair. Both went to five sets and are considered classics. The 2009 final was particularly noteworthy for Federer&#x27;s tears during the post-match presentation.
* Novak Djokovic vs. Rafael Nadal (2012 final) – Considered one of the greatest matches ever, Djokovic clinched his third Australian Open title in a near-six hour epic, defeating Nadal 7–5 in the fifth set. It was the longest final in Grand Slam history, lasting 5 hours 53 minutes and eclipsing the previous record set by Mats Wilander and Ivan Lendl at the 1988 US Open final.
* Lleyton Hewitt vs. Roger Federer (2003 Davis Cup semi-final) – Labelled &quot;one of the greatest comebacks in Australia&#x27;s long Davis Cup history,&quot; Hewitt defeated a still rising Federer, 5–7 2–6 7–6 (7–4) 7–5 6–1 before a raucous Melbourne crowd and booked Australia&#x27;s place in the final.

===John Cain Arena===
The second largest court is John Cain Arena (originally known as the Multi-Purpose Venue, as it was referred to during the 2006 Commonwealth Games, Vodafone Arena, Hisense Arena and Melbourne Arena) which was opened in 2000. It has a capacity of 10,500, and also has a retractable roof. Completed in 2000 for a cost of $65 million, the arena has hosted a wide variety of sporting and other events since its inception including boxing bouts such as Anthony Mundine vs. Lester Ellis, as well as Grand Finals in netball and basketball and concerts performed by Scissor Sisters, B. B. King, Nicki Minaj and One Direction.

During the Australian Open, John Cain Arena hosts numerous day and night matches up to the end of the fourth round. Most notably it is the venue of the longest women&#x27;s singles match in a Grand Slam. Francesca Schiavone defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova 6–4 1–6 16–14 in four hours and forty-four minutes at the fourth round of the 2011 Australian Open. John Cain Arena has been accessible for Australian Open patrons with a ground pass (i.e.: cheapest form of ticketing available) since 2015 and subsequently the arena has developed a reputation for being, like most outdoor courts, an incredibly passionate venue with terrific atmosphere, particularly when Australians are playing on the court.

===Margaret Court Arena===
Formerly known as Show Court 1, Margaret Court Arena was opened in 1988 along with the Melbourne Park precinct. Originally seating 6,000 spectators, the arena underwent a renovation which increased the capacity to 7,500 and added a retractable roof – the fastest of its kind in the world, opening or closing in just five minutes. The redevelopment was completed prior to the 2015 Australian Open. The arena is also used for regular music concerts and is one of the two home courts of Super Netball team the Melbourne Vixens.

Conjecture over the name of the arena has caused significant debate in Australian society. Named in honour of Margaret Court, statistically Australia&#x27;s greatest Grand Slam singles player, Court has sparked controversy over her public views on LGBT issues. As recently as 2017 there were calls from several public figures for the arena&#x27;s name to be changed. Venue management has previously stated that it does not support Court&#x27;s comments and &quot;embrace[s] equality, diversity and inclusion&quot;.

===Show Court Arena===
In April 2019 construction of the Show Court Arena (known commercially as Kia Arena) commenced on the site of the old Eastern Courts 16–23, between Rod Laver and John Cain Arenas. The open-air arena is partially sunken into the ground and has a roof structure capable of protecting most of the spectators from the extremities, however unlike the larger arenas it does not have a retractable roof capable of being shut during inclement weather. Construction of the arena was the signature element of the $271.5 million third stage of redevelopments of Melbourne Park and was completed prior to the 2022 Australian Open. The arena seats 5,000 spectators.

===Show Courts===
Aside from a further 35 match day and practice courts, many of which have temporary standing of up to 2,500 capacity attached to them for the Australian Open, there are two Show Courts at Melbourne Park, Show Court 2 (known for commercial purposes as the 1573 Arena) and Court 3 (formerly known as Show Court 3), each with a permanent seating capacity of approximately 3,000. Like all the other tennis courts at Melbourne Park, these show courts remain as tennis courts throughout the year and are available for use by the general public. The remaining courts at Melbourne Park are outdoor courts located mostly on the western side of the precinct closer to Birrarung Marr. They have seating of anywhere from 50 to 2,500 installed for the Australian Open.

===Centrepiece===
Opened in September 2021, &quot;Centrepiece&quot; replaced the old function and media centre, is located near Garden Square and Rod Laver Arena. The building is capable of hosting large events and banquets of varying capacity inside the grand ballroom, and is also equipped with media and television broadcast facilities, studios and meeting rooms, and a 250-seat auditorium.

==Redevelopment (2010–2022)==

The Melbourne Park Redevelopment was the process by which the precinct underwent three significant stages of redevelopment between 2010 and 2022. The Stage 1 redevelopment included the construction of a new Eastern Plaza to host an elite tennis training facility and a new bridge linking Melbourne Park to the nearby AAMI Park stadium and Olympic Park Oval, as well as an upgrade to Margaret Court Arena. The Eastern Plaza Tennis Training Facility, which was later renamed the National Tennis Centre, features eight indoor and 13 outdoor courts, eight of which are European-style clay courts. It was unveiled in January 2013. Margaret Court Arena had its seating capacity expanded to 7,500 and a retractable roof installed, and was opened ahead of the 2015 Australian Open. The cost of the Stage 1 redevelopment was $366 million.

Stage 2 of the redevelopment began in June 2015, when it was announced that Rod Laver Arena would undergo a redevelopment of its exterior facade and interior features, such as bars and other player and spectator facilities. The broader second stage upgrade included a new footbridge linking Melbourne Park and Birrarung Marr and an Administration and Media Building, to house Tennis Australia and Melbourne &amp; Olympic Parks Trust headquarters. The new footbridge, named Tanderrum Bridge, was unveiled in December 2016 and the Administration and Media Building was completed two months earlier. The Rod Laver Arena refurbishment included a new four-level training, leisure and multi-dining facility for athletes at the Australian Open and the general public at other times; this was completed in December 2018. Rod Laver Arena&#x27;s retractable roof was also upgraded to allow for it to be closed for inclement weather in five minutes, dropping from the 30 minutes it took to close beforehand. The Stage 2 redevelopment cost $338 million and was fully completed in September 2019.

The final phase of redevelopment (Stage 3) was announced in April 2017 by the Victorian Government; a further $271.3 million was invested to complete upgrades for Melbourne Park. Construction of Stage 3 began in April 2019. The signature elements of this phase of redevelopment was the construction of a new 5,000-seat sunken show court arena located between Rod Laver and John Cain arenas, and the construction of a double-storey function and media centre named &quot;Centrepiece&quot;, on the site of the old function centre. The &quot;Centrepiece&quot; building features a Grand Hall capable of seating up to 1400 people at a banquet, a press conference-style auditorium for up to 250 people and several broadcast studios capable of being converted into meeting rooms, boardrooms or cocktail events. Other upgrades to the park as part of this stage was the installation of a central logistics hub which included a kitchen and loading dock, additional grassed public spaces, and two match tennis courts with seating for several hundred spectators. Construction of the &quot;Centrepiece&quot; facility was completed in August 2021. Overall, a total of $972 million was spent on the multi-year redevelopment of the Melbourne Park precinct. Completion of all works at the precinct was achieved in December 2021, shortly prior to the 2022 Australian Open in January.

==Transport and access==
Melbourne Park is adjacent to the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Yarra Park, and there are several pedestrian bridges linking the two across the separating railway lines. The park is five minutes walk from Richmond and Jolimont railway stations, and five minutes from the city centre by tram (route 70) or ten minutes on foot.

<text>Mikołów (, ) is a town in Silesia, in southern Poland, near the city of Katowice. Outer town of the Metropolis GZM, a metropolis with a population of over 2 million, and is within a greater Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area populated by about 5,294,000 people. The population of the town is 40,898 (2019). Located in the Silesian Highlands, on the &quot;Jamna&quot; stream, a tributary of the Kłodnica River and indirectly the Oder.

It is situated in the Silesian Voivodeship since its formation in 1999, previously in Katowice Voivodeship, and before then, of the Silesian Voivodeship.

==History==
With a written mention from 1222, Mikołów is one of the oldest towns in Upper Silesia. This was a document sent by duke Casimir I of Opole (the son of Mieszko II the Fat) to the bishop of Wrocław, Wawrzyniec. In the document was written the name of Andrew (Latin: &quot;comes Andreas, castellanus de Miculow&quot;), the castellan of &quot;Miculow&quot;, showing that Mikołów was already an administrative center. The town&#x27;s name comes from the name &quot;Mikołaj&quot; (&quot;Nicholas&quot;), and is of Polish origin. As a result of the fragmentation of the medieval Kingdom of Poland, Mikołów was part of the Duchy of Opole and Racibórz, still ruled by the Piast dynasty until 1532. During the &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot;, Mikołów significantly grew in population and expanded its infrastructure.

Mikołów became the center of local trading, located on crossroads of trading roads. The Black Death killed 33% of the town&#x27;s inhabitants in 1349–50. In the period 1433–1443, there were several earthquakes in the area. In 1547 Mikołów gained city status. In 1580 the first Protestant pastor came to the town, however, in 1630 the local parish returned to the Catholic Church and its parish priest became Tomasz Aleksander Czarniecki. In 1645 and 1687 few fires burnt tenements near the market place and in connection with that Mikołów achieved the right to expose four fairs a year. In the second half of the 18th century peasants few times opposed the ruler and paying high serfdomes. Additionally in between 1713 and 1715 the city survived a famine bringing epidemics. Following the mid-18th-century Silesian Wars the town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1760 the name &quot;Mikołów&quot; was used first time in the originally form. On 20 May 1794 a huge fire disaster burnt whole houses around the market square, including the town hall and all historical documents stored inside.

In the 19th century, the town became a center of Polish printing in Upper Silesia. In 1845, Tomasz Nowacki founded a Polish printing house, and later on Polish activist and writer Karol Miarka published the Polish magazines &quot;Katolik&quot; and &quot;Monika&quot; in the town. Poles smuggled large amounts of gunpowder through the town to the Russian Partition of Poland during the January Uprising in 1863. In 1871 the town became part of the German Empire, where it was officially known under the Germanized name &quot;Nikolai&quot;. The town&#x27;s predominantly Polish population referred to the town as both &quot;Mikułów&quot; and &quot;Mikołów&quot;. In 1908, the still-existing Polish choir &quot;Harmonia&quot; was founded.

After World War I, in 1918, Poland regained independence, and shortly after the Polish Silesian Uprisings were fought and a plebiscite was held, in which the slight majority of the town opted with 55.2% in favor of remaining within Germany, while the overwhelming majority in the present-day districts (then surrounding villages) of Borowa Wieś, Kamionka, Mokre, Śmiłowice, Bujaków and Paniowy opted to reintegrate with Poland, with the result ranging from 72.2% voting for Poland in Bujaków to 94.4% in Kamionka. The town was eventually reintegrated with Poland in 1922, where it officially became Mikołów. Within interwar Poland, the town was electrified, new schools were opened, a new post office, fire brigade and stadium were built, and a Polish library was founded.

===World War II===

During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, the town was captured by German troops on September 3, 1939. Mikołów was defended against the Germans jointly by the Polish Army and civilians. Due to Polish fortifications, the remainings of some pre-war Polish bunkers can be seen even today.

During the subsequent German occupation, the Polish population was subjected to mass arrests, murder, deportations to concentration camps, expulsions and forced conscriptions to the Wehrmacht. Already in early September 1939, the Germans carried out mass arrests and executions of former Polish insurgents of the Silesian Uprisings and local Polish activists. Among the victims of massacres carried out on 5, 7 and 17 September 1939 were Polish workers, miners, craftsmen, a farmer, a court employee, a policeman, a merchant, and a local official. The Germans also carried out manhunts of Polish insurgents who were hiding in the forest between Mikołów and Tychy, and destroyed the book collection of the pre-war Polish library.

Nevertheless, local Poles quickly organized an underground resistance movement, and Poles from Mikołów also fought in the Polish Armed Forces in the West along the Western Allies. 16 Polish policemen from Mikołów were murdered by the Soviets in Mednoye during the large Katyn massacre in 1940. In 1943, the Germans carried out expulsions of Poles. In January 1945, the Germans murdered 14 members of the Polish resistance movement and 60 prisoners of the Auschwitz concentration camp in Mikołów during a death march, while in the present-day districts of Borowa Wieś and Mokre, they murdered 31 and 13 prisoners respectively.

In 1945–1950, many citizens were either deported to the Soviet Union as forced labour or expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The town itself was restored to Poland. In the years after the war, as the surviving pre-war Polish population, was joined by Poles from East and Central Poland.

===Jewish history===
The first Jews appeared in Mikołów in 1674, establishing an inn. The synagogue in Mikołów was established in 1816. There was about 800 Jews in the town in the second half of the 19th century. Since then the number of Jewish inhabitants little by little has been lowering down to the level of 243 before the Second World War. Just before the liberation by Soviets in January 1945, prisoners from Auschwitz had marched through Mikołów to Germany to work in labour camps. They were totally exhausted and weak, most of them were at the death&#x27;s door. In Mikołów over 60 people died or were murdered and then buried in the Jewish cemetery. Among the prisoners were also some Catholics. In 1972 the communist authority ordered the miners from the coalmine Bolesław Śmiały to detonate the Synagogue.

The Jewish cemetery in Mikołów was established at the end of the 19th century, but the oldest tomb dates back to 1726. Only 100 of 265 tombs are preserved. In the front of the cemetery is the memorial, dedicated to the victims of January 1945. On the memorial there is written: &quot;In this place rest in peace 14 people shot up on 16 January 1945 by Schutzpolizei officers, and 50 prisoners from the concentration camp in Auschwitz, murdered on 19 January 1945 during evacuation of the camp by Germans. Glory to them&quot;

In Mikołów there was also located another-older Jewish cemetery (1682) but during the Second World War it was completely ruined.

<text>Bourke Street is one of the main streets in the Melbourne central business district and a core feature of the Hoddle Grid. It was traditionally the entertainment hub of inner-city Melbourne, and is now also a popular tourist destination and tram thoroughfare.

During the &quot;Marvellous Melbourne&quot; era, Bourke Street was the location of many of the city&#x27;s theatres and cinemas. Today it continues as a major retail shopping precinct with the Bourke Street Mall running between Elizabeth and Swanston Streets, numerous offices to the west end and restaurants to the east. Its liveliness and activity has often been contrasted with the sobering formality of nearby Collins Street. For this reason, &quot;Busier than Bourke Street&quot; is a popular colloquialism denoting a crowded or busy environment.

Bourke Street is named for Irish-born British Army officer Sir Richard Bourke, who served as the Governor of New South Wales from 1831 and 1837 during the drafting of the Hoddle Grid.

==Geography==

Bourke Street runs roughly from east to west and bisects the city centre along its long axis. Bourke Street runs parallel between Little Collins Street to the south and Little Bourke Street to the north.

There are two primary stretches of Bourke Street, split by Southern Cross station: the historic city centre and the modern Docklands precinct. The city centre portion runs from Spring Street in the east (overlooked by Parliament House) to Spencer Street and Southern Cross station. The newer Docklands end continues on the other side of the station (which is only accessible to pedestrians) and finishes at its intersection with Collins Street further west.

==History==

Having been laid out as part of the Hoddle Grid in 1837, Bourke Street was considered &quot;out of town&quot; until the 1840s when the western end saw the opening of St Patrick&#x27;s Hall, the first synagogue and the first public hospital. During the 1850s it gained a reputation as a busy thoroughfare popular as the centre for Saturday nightlife. As retail presence increased with department store Buckley &amp; Nunn opening a succession of buildings in 1851 and rival Myer in 1911, the street was often compared to London&#x27;s Oxford Street.

Melbourne&#x27;s first theatre opened on Bourke Street as the Pavilion (1841), and by the late 1840s the east end was established as Melbourne&#x27;s main entertainment zone. Theatres and public halls were complemented by billiard halls, cigar divans, rifle galleries, bowling alleys and sideshows. While the early evening crowd trod Bourke Street&#x27;s pavements for entertainment or for show, the night-time street was also notorious for public disorder, fights, brothel touts and drinking and drunkenness.

Cheap restaurants appeared from the 1870s, when &quot;Parer&#x27;s Hotel and Crystal Tea Rooms&quot; became a Melbourne institution, while the Café de Paris was a favourite literary and artistic meeting place. Ellis Bird&#x27;s Books opened in 1925 at number 21 and Margaret Bird and her husband built up a haven for the literati for 30 years. Twentieth-century restaurants such as Florentino&#x27;s, Pellegrini&#x27;s and the Society Café have become Melbourne institutions.

The late 20th century onwards has resulted in office block developments, residential skyscrapers, the introduction of several shopping arcades and the Bourke Street Mall.

==Mall==
The Bourke Street Mall is a pedestrian and tram-only strip running between Swanston and Elizabeth Streets. The mall is Bourke Street&#x27;s most famous feature and contains retail hubs like Melbourne&#x27;s GPO, H&amp;M, Zara, Cotton On and the flagship stores of Myer and David Jones.

Concepts for a Bourke Street Mall were drawn up as early as 1964 by Robin Boyd and Frederick Romberg however the ambitious multi-platform design which separated cars from pedestrians was never realised. Plans were eventually scaled down with pedestrians sharing space with a grade level tramline. Vehicular traffic was removed from the section on 13 February 1978. The pedestrian mall was officially opened in 1983 by Charles, Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales.

The mall received a major facelift in preparation for the 2006 Commonwealth Games and elevated tram super-stops were later installed.

In the January 2017 Melbourne car attack, a mentally ill person driving a sedan being pursued by the police deliberately drove the vehicle onto the footpath and ran over innocent bystanders at Bourke Street Mall. The crime claimed the lives of six people, including one baby and one child. Over twenty-five victims were hospitalised with injuries.

The 2018 Melbourne stabbing attack also took place near the Target Centre on Bourke Street. An ISIS inspired male set fire to his ute before exiting the vehicle and stabbing three bystanders. Two victims were hospitalised and one died. Police attended the scene within one minute of the car fire and shot the offender, who later died in hospital.

In September 2023, Zain Khan drove through a tram stop, running over multiple bystanders before crashing into two cars at the Bourke/Russell Street Intersection. A 76-year-old Brunswick man, identified in media reports as the philanthropist John Haasz, was killed and five other people were injured in the alleged rampage. Khan pleading guilty at his trial.

==Arcades==
Many of Melbourne&#x27;s famous arcades and shopping centres connect to Bourke Street, including:
* Melbourne&#x27;s GPO, the former General Post Office, a boutique shopping arcade from 2004 until clothing company H&amp;M took over as key tenant in 2014 
* Royal Arcade, a heritage shopping arcade from 1869
* Strand Arcade
* Midcity Arcade
* Kmart Centre, formally Target Centre 
* The Walk Arcade (presently (2024) being redeveloped and not operating.
* Centrepoint Shopping Centre presently (2024) largely empty in readiness for redevelopment.

==Events==
The inaugural Myer Christmas Window display was in 1956, the year of the 1956 Melbourne Summer Olympics and became an annual tradition. Myer&#x27;s shopfront windows are decorated in a different Christmas-themed display and are visited by around 1,000,000 children and their parents each December.

The Myer Christmas Parade was an annual parade running down Bourke Street from Spring Street to the Myer windows. The parade was last held in 2010.

==Skyscrapers==
Bourke Street is a commercial zone lined by glass-paned skyscrapers, especially at its west end. Prominent skyscrapers include the National Australia Bank headquarters at 395 and 700 Bourke, 385 Bourke Street, Bourke Place, UniSuper, Marland House, National Bank House at 500 Bourke (former headquarters of NAB), AMP Square, Medibank at 720 Bourke, Channel Nine Melbourne and AGL Energy (atop Southern Cross station).

==Transportation==
In August 1887 the Melbourne Tramway &amp; Omnibus Company commenced operating a cable tramway from Spencer Street to Clifton Hill along Bourke Street. It closed in October 1940 with buses introduced. In June 1955 the Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board replaced the buses with electric trams. Today, tram routes 86 and 96 travel the length of Bourke Street and directly through the mall.

Parliament railway station is located at the eastern end of Bourke Street near the corner of Spring Street and is part of the underground City Loop for the suburban rail network.

Southern Cross station bisects Bourke Street at the city centre&#x27;s west end and is a major transport hub for train and bus services throughout Victoria. The station also has shuttle buses to Melbourne and Avalon Airports. A pedestrian bridge at Southern Cross station provides access from Bourke Street to Docklands Stadium and Melbourne Docklands.

== Cinemas ==
Bourke Street has played a historically significant part in Melbourne&#x27;s cinema industry. It was home to the city&#x27;s first permanent cinema (although this was initially established near Princes Bridge), and by 1913 had developed into Melbourne&#x27;s principal cinema precinct. In 1908, Arthur Russell began screening films at St. George&#x27;s Hall, which was rebuilt as Hoyt&#x27;s De Luxe Theatre in 1914, marking the beginning of the Hoyts cinema chain.

Bourke Street remained a centre for cinema-goers until quite recently. In 2005, the Hoyts cinema moved to larger premises at the Melbourne Central Shopping Centre. On 15 February 2006 the Village cinema closed down, leaving Village cinemas at nearby Crown Casino as the main Village branded city cinemas. The Chinatown Cinema, which inhabits the former Hoyts MidCity cinema, is the only cinema left in Bourke Street. On nearby Collins Street, the newly expanded Kino Dendy cinemas continues to be a cinema drawcard. The adjacent Russell Street Greater Union cinemas closed in 2013 and has since been demolished.

<doc id="734542" wikidata="Q1347844" url="?curid=734542" title="Stewart Udall">
<text>Stewart Lee Udall (January 31, 1920 – March 20, 2010) was an American politician and later, a federal government official who belonged to the Democratic Party. After serving three terms as a congressman from Arizona, he served as Secretary of the Interior from 1961 to 1969, under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. A staunch liberal, he is best known for enthusiastically promoting environmentalism while in the cabinet, with success primarily under President Johnson.

==Early life and education==
Stewart Udall was born on January 31, 1920, in Saint Johns, Arizona, to Louisa Lee Udall (1893–1974) and Levi Stewart Udall (1891–1960). He had five siblings: Inez, Elma, Morris (Mo), Eloise, and David Burr. As a young boy Stewart worked on the family farm in St. Johns. He was remembered by his mother as a child with tremendous energy and an unquenchable curiosity.

Udall attended the University of Arizona for two years until World War II. He served four years in the Air Force as an enlisted gunner on a B-24 Liberator, flying fifty missions over Western Europe from Italy with the 736th Bomb Squadron, 454th Bomb Group, for which he received the Air Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters. He returned to the University of Arizona in 1946, where he attended law school and played guard on a championship basketball team. In 1947, Udall, along with his brother Mo, helped integrate the University of Arizona cafeteria. Mo and Stewart were respected student athletes and Mo was student body president. On their way to lunch at the Student Union one day, they saw a group of black students eating lunch outside the building. Black students were allowed to buy food in the cafeteria but had to eat outside. When Mo and Stewart invited Morgan Maxwell Jr., a black freshman, to share their table in the cafeteria, it helped to calm some long-simmering issues surrounding racial segregation at the university.
==Career==
Udall received his law degree and was admitted to the Arizona bar in 1948. He began his law practice in Tucson shortly thereafter. Udall became increasingly active in public service, being elected to the School Board of Amphitheater Public Schools (District 10) in Tucson in June 1951. As a school board member, he participated in desegregating the Amphitheater School District before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education. 
In 1954, Udall was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Arizona&#x27;s Second District. He served with distinction in the House for three terms on the Interior and Education and Labor committees.

From 1961 to 1969 Udall served as Secretary of the Interior under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Under his leadership, the Interior Department aggressively promoted an expansion of federal public lands and assisted with the enactment of major environmental legislation. Among his many accomplishments, Udall oversaw the addition of four national parks, six national monuments, eight national seashores and lakeshores, nine national recreation areas, twenty national historic sites, and fifty-six national wildlife refuges, including Canyonlands National Park in Utah, North Cascades National Park in Washington, Redwood National Park in California, the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge in New Jersey, and the Appalachian National Scenic Trail stretching from Georgia to Maine.

Udall played a key role in the enactment of environmental laws such as the Clear Air, Water Quality and Clean Water Restoration Acts and Amendments, the Wilderness Act of 1964, the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966, the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965, the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965, the National Trail System Act of 1968, and Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968.

In 1961, weeks after becoming the Secretary of Interior Udall told Washington Redskins owner, George Preston Marshall, that he had to integrate the football team as every other franchise in the NFL already had, as a condition of use of the newly built and federally owned District of Columbia Stadium. Marshall integrated the team in 1962. 
On July 27, 1962, Udall sent a letter to the United States Geological Survey&#x27;s board chairman to discuss policy on the use of ethnic slurs on the organization&#x27;s topographical maps product. This led to a wider codified policy by the USGS against use of any ethnic slur in any map name.

In September 1962, Udall was summoned unexpectedly into a meeting with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev while on a tour of the Soviet Union. It was during this meeting that Khrushchev famously hinted at his secret deployment of nuclear missiles to Cuba by telling Udall: &quot;It&#x27;s been a long time since you could spank us like a little boy. Now we can swat your ass.&quot; This was a prelude to the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Udall supported a plan created by the US Army Corps of Engineers to construct the Tocks Island Dam for the purpose of creating a reservoir for the benefit of the New York City water supply. After forcing homeowners out of their homes through buyouts and condemnation, the plan was abandoned. The homes that had not been bulldozed were simply left to deteriorate. Throughout the process, the federal government acted with impunity and a callous disregard for those who were displaced. With the election of President Reagan, the Tocks Island Dam project was shelved.

Udall also helped spark a cultural renaissance in America by setting in motion initiatives that led to the Kennedy Center, Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the revived Ford&#x27;s Theatre. Upon Udall&#x27;s recommendation President Kennedy asked former U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Frost to read an original poem at his inauguration, establishing a tradition for that occasion.
A pioneer of the environmental movement, Udall warned of a conservation crisis in the 1960s with his best-selling book on environmental attitudes in the United States, &quot;The Quiet Crisis&quot; (1963). In the book, he wrote about the dangers of pollution, overuse of natural resources, and dwindling open spaces. Along with Rachel Carson&#x27;s &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, The Quiet Crisis is credited with creating a consciousness in the country that led to the environmental movement. Udall was a staunch supporter of Rachel Carson and her work. Stewart Udall once stated, &quot;Plans to protect air and water, wilderness and wildlife are in fact, plans to protect Man.&quot;

Udall also had the foresight as Secretary of the Interior, to spearhead the use of NASA satellites to produce images of Earth from space for scientific research, leading to development of the Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) center at the U.S. Geological Survey. Over the course of more than forty years, that program mapped the Earth from space, showing the physical changes to the planet.

In 1967, the National Audubon Society awarded Udall its highest honor, the Audubon medal.

===Energy policy===
During the energy crisis in the 1970s, Udall advocated the use of solar energy as one remedy to the crisis. In October 1972, Udall published a seminal article in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, entitled &quot;The Last Traffic Jam&quot;. The article contains arguments for the proposition that &quot;less is more&quot; and foresaw problems with U.S. transportation and energy policy and competition with emerging markets for scarce resources. In 1974, Udall, along with Charles Conconi and David Osterhout, wrote &quot;The Energy Balloon&quot;, discussing the energy policies of the United States.

===Later years===
After leaving government service in 1969, Udall taught for a year at the School of Forestry at Yale University as a visiting professor of environmental humanism. He later devoted his time to writing books and articles about environmental issues and to practicing law. In 1971, he published &quot;America&#x27;s Natural Treasures: National Nature Monuments and Seashores&quot;, which is about America&#x27;s national parks, monuments, and reserves.

In 1979, he left Washington to return to the West. In 1980, Udall was elected to the Central Arizona Water Conservation District Board and commissioned as a member of the Morrison Institute. Udall was presented with the Ansel Adams Award in 1986, the Wilderness Society&#x27;s highest conservation award. He also was awarded the United Nations Gold Medal for Lifetime Achievement. Udall received the Common Cause Public Service Achievement Award for his lifelong protection of the environment and defense of American citizens who were victims of nuclear weapons testing.

In 1987, he published &quot;To the Inland Empire: Coronado and our Spanish Legacy&quot;, which retraces the trails of Spanish explorer Francisco Vásquez de Coronado as he searched for the &quot;golden cities&quot; of Cibola in what now is Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. Udall published &quot;The Quiet Crisis and the Next Generation&quot; in 1988, a revised edition with nine new chapters of &quot;The Quiet Crisis&quot; (1963). &quot;The Quiet Crisis&quot; introduced the Myth of Superabundance. In 1990, he co-authored &quot;Beyond the Mythic West&quot;, which examines effects of change upon the inhabitants and lands of the western United States. In 1998, he published &quot;The Myths of August: A Personal Exploration of Our Tragic Cold War Affairs with the Atom.&quot;

In November 2009, Congress enacted legislation to honor Stewart Udall by renaming the Morris K. Udall Foundation as the Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Foundation, in recognition of the historic Interior Secretary&#x27;s contributions. The Udall Foundation, an independent federal agency, was created initially to honor the legacy of the late Morris Udall, who represented Southern Arizona in the U.S. House of Representatives for thirty years. Stewart Udall, who also represented Southern Arizona in Congress from 1955 to 1961, is Morris Udall&#x27;s older brother. The two worked together on many environmental and Native American initiatives while Stewart Udall was Secretary of the Interior and Morris Udall a member of Congress. Congress recognized that the Udall legacy really was a shared legacy, rooted in the work of the Udall brothers, which dominated environmental reform for three decades.

One of Udall&#x27;s last essays, published in 2008, was his &quot;Letter to My Grandchildren&quot;, written with his wife, Ermalee, which asked for their grandchildren&#x27;s assistance in advocating for protection of the Earth. This letter resulted in Udall being contacted by the VillageTown Stewards who asked that they videotape the thoughts in that letter, since it was more likely that the generation of his grandchildren watch internet videos than read letters. Udall agreed, and the video may be seen on-line at, &quot;Stewart Udall on History: the greatest mistake&quot;. This video was transcribed and adapted to a chapter of a book, &quot;Life Liberty Happiness&quot;. Udall also agreed to serve as Chairman Emeritus of the VillageTown Stewards. The video was filmed coincidentally on the Summer solstice of 2009 and Udall died nine months later on the Spring equinox. His public memorial was held on the Summer solstice of 2010. It is believed this video was the last recording of Udall&#x27;s views.

==Death and legacy==

In the early hours of the Spring Equinox, March 20, 2010, Udall died peacefully at his home in the foothills of Santa Fe, New Mexico, age 90.

After his death, President Obama noted on March 20, 2010, &quot;For the better part of three decades, Stewart Udall served this nation honorably. Whether in the skies above Italy in World War II, in Congress, or as Secretary of the Interior, Stewart Udall left an indelible mark on this nation and inspired countless Americans who will continue his fight for clean air, clean water, and to maintain our many natural treasures.&quot;

On June 8, 2010, President Barack Obama signed legislation to designate the United States Department of the Interior Building as the &quot;Stewart Lee Udall Department of the Interior Building.&quot;

Point Udall, on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, was named for him in 1968, honoring Udall&#x27;s work to support the economy of the island group. Point Udall, USVI is the easternmost point of the United States in the direction of travel. The westernmost point in the direction of travel, Point Udall, Guam, is named for his brother Mo. This means that &quot;America&#x27;s day ... begin(s) and end(s) at a Point Udall.&quot;

==Awards and decorations==
During his USAAF service, Udall earned the following decorations:

In 1967, Udall received the National Audubon Society&#x27;s highest honor, the Audubon Medal.

==Personal life==
Stewart Udall was married to Ermalee Webb (died 2001) with whom he had two daughters, (Lori and Lynn) and four sons, (Denis, Jay, Scott, and Tom). He was the brother of U.S. Representative and 1976 presidential candidate, Mo Udall; he served as Mo&#x27;s campaign manager during the Democratic primary election, which Mo lost to Jimmy Carter. Stewart Udall&#x27;s son Tom Udall and nephew Mark Udall (Mo&#x27;s son), both former members of the U.S. House of Representatives, were elected to the United States Senate from New Mexico and Colorado, respectively, in 2008. Mark lost his seat in 2014, and Tom retired at the end of his second term in 2021.

Udall was interviewed for two Ken Burns documentaries for PBS: &quot;The West&quot;, which features his ancestor John D. Lee&#x27;s role in the Mountain Meadows massacre of 1857, and &quot;The National Parks: America&#x27;s Best Idea&quot;, in his capacity as a former Secretary of the Interior, who oversaw the National Park Service.

Udall was the last surviving original member of Kennedy&#x27;s cabinet. Udall&#x27;s death left W. Willard Wirtz as the last surviving member of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s cabinet. Wirtz died on April 24, 2010.

<text>Amsterdam Ordnance Datum or (NAP) is a vertical datum in use in large parts of Western Europe. Originally created for use in the Netherlands, its height was used by Prussia in 1879 for defining &quot;&quot;, and in 1955 by other European countries. In the 1990s, it was used as the reference level for the United European leveling Network (UELN) which in turn led to the European Vertical Reference System (EVRS).

Mayor Johannes Hudde of Amsterdam is credited with beginning the first works for the creation of this vertical datum after he expanded the sea dike following a flood in Amsterdam in 1675. Between 1683 and 1684, he had daily measurements taken of the water level of the adjacent sea arm, &#x27;, during [[tide|high tide]]. The calculated averaged was called the&#x27; (&quot;Amsterdam level&quot;, AP) and used to calculate the minimum height of the sea dykes, which he set at &quot;9 feet and 5 inches&quot; (2.67 m) above AP.

In 1850, the datum was used at several places in Belgium, and in 1874 the German government adopted the datum for first-order levelling. AP was carried over to other areas in the Netherlands in 1860, to replace locally used levels. In this operation, an error was introduced which was corrected (normalised) between 1885 and 1894, resulting in the &quot;&quot;.

Currently it is physically realised by a brass benchmark on a pile below the Dam square in Amsterdam. The brass benchmark in the Amsterdam Stopera (combined city hall and opera house), which is a tourist attraction, is no longer used as a reference point.

<text>Qudsia Begum (dead 1768) was a wife of Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah and mother of emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur. She was early born an administrator and served as de facto regent from 1748 to 1754.

==Early years==
She had a brother named Man Khan. She was introduced to Muhammad Shah&#x27;s attention by Khadija Khanum, the daughter of Umdat-Ul-Mulk, Amir Khan. The emperor was so fascinated by her, that he raised her to the dignity of an empress. 

She gave birth to Muhammad Shah&#x27;s only surviving son, Ahmad Shah Bahadur on 23 December 1725. Her son was, however, brought up by Muhammad Shah&#x27;s empresses Badshah Begum and Sahiba Mahal.

==Empress dowager==
In April 1748, Muhammad Shah died. Her son, Ahmad Shah Bahadur, who was in camp with Safdar Jang near Panipat to return to Delhi and claim the throne. On Safdar Jang&#x27;s advice, he was enthroned at Panipat and returned to Delhi a few days later. Ahmad Shah Bahadur proved to be an ineffective ruler and was strongly influenced by his mother. A series of defeats and internal struggles led to his downfall. 

She was successively given the titles of Bai-Ju Sahiba, Nawab Qudsiya, Sahiba-uz-Zamani, Sahibjiu Sahiba, Hazrat Qibla-i-Alam, and Mumtaz Mahal. She was known for her generosity. She gave pension to the Begums and the children of the late emperor not only from the government&#x27;s purse but also from her own funds. She, however, behaved ruthlessly with Badshah Begum and Sahiba Mahal.

Imperial officials used to sit down at her porch daily and she would hold discussions with them from behind a screen or through the medium of eunuchs. There, officials passed her petitions of the state in envelopes, and eunuchs read them aloud for the Begum to listen and deliver her approvals and judgments and she would pass orders on them without consulting anyone. At the zenith of her power, she displayed levels of magnanimity and charity unheard of in those times. Any person who could manage to get his or her case heard by her was sure to get some benefit or help. A court historian once lamented, &quot;Oh God! That the affairs of Hindustan should be conducted by a woman as foolish as this!&quot;

She had an affair with the eunuch Javed Khan Nawab Bahadur. He had been an assistant controller of the harem servants and manager of the Begums&#x27; estates during the late reign. Javed Khan was assassinated by Safdar Jang on 27 August 1752. She and her son grieved him deeply. It is said that she put on white robes and discarded her jewels and ornaments like a widow. 

The &quot;mansab&quot; of commanding 50,000 horse was conferred upon her, and her birthday was celebrated with greater pomp than that of the Emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur himself. Her brother, Man Khan, a vagabond haunting the lanes and occasionally following the profession of a male dancer in a supporting role for singing girls, was created a &quot;mansabdar&quot; of 6,000 with the title of Mutaqad-ud-Daulah Bahadur. At a time when the soldiers were mutinying nearly every day due to overdue payments and the Mughal court could not raise even two hundred thousand rupees for this purpose, Qudsia Begum spent two crore rupees in celebrating her birthday on 21 January 1754.

== Defeat and imprisonment ==
On 26 May 1754, Ahmad Shah Bahadur, camped with his army in Sikandrabad was defeated by a Maratha force led by Malhar Rao Holkar and the former Mughal Grand Vizier Imad-ul-Mulk. The emperor fled to Delhi with Qudsia Begum, his son Mahmud Shah Bahadur, his favourite wife Banu Begum Sahiba , and his half-sister Hazrat Begum, leaving behind other wives and a retinue of 8,000 women. 

Imad-ul-Mulk and Maratha chieftain Raghunath Rao followed the emperor to Delhi. Ahmad Shah Bahadur was deposed on 2 June 1754 and arrested with his mother. Imad-ul-Mulk was reinstated himself as the Mughal Grand Vizier and dispatched a Mughal army to capture Bhurtpore, which was then controlled by Suraj Mal. Imad-ul-Mulk intercepted letters from Ahmad Shah Bahadur to Suraj Mal, claiming to encourage the Jats to fight in exchange for aid. Imad-ul-Mulk made peace with Suraj Mal, returned to Delhi, and had Ahmad Shah Bahadur and Qudsia Begum blinded.

== Legacy ==
Qudsia Begum commissioned various public and private works in Delhi. The Sunehri Masjid near the Red Fort was constructed between 1747 and 1751 for Nawab Bahadur Javid Khan. In 1748, emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur commissioned a garden, known as &quot;Qudsia Bagh&quot; for her. It consisted of a stone barahdari and a mosque inside it.

<text>Eobalaenoptera is an extinct genus of baleen whale belonging to Balaenopteroidea.

==Discovery and significance==

&quot;Eobalaenoptera&quot; was first described in June 2004 by researchers at the Virginia Museum of Natural History from a partial skeleton found in 1990 in Caroline County, Virginia, the site of a prehistoric ocean, in the middle Miocene Calvert Formation. The skeleton proved to have similar morphological characteristics to a clade of whales consisting of two modern taxonomic families—Balaenopteridae (the rorquals) and Eschrichtiidae (a family with one surviving species, the gray whale).

The age of the Calvert Formation (14 million years) makes &quot;Eobalaenoptera&quot; the oldest-known member of Balaenopteroidea by three to five million years. It also considerably narrowed the gap between the earliest-known fossil record and estimated time of divergence of this clade from other baleen whales. Molecular clocks have put this divergence for balaenopteroids from other crown mysticetes by 15–20 million years.

In their review of extant and fossil rorquals, Demere et al. (2005) questioned the balaenopteroid placement of &quot;Eobalaenoptera&quot;, noting that the holotype lack substantial cranial material that could reinforce its original classification, preferring to treat the genus as Chaeomysticeti &quot;incertae sedis&quot;.

==Etymology==
The genus name Eobalaenoptera reflects the similarities between this skeleton and species in the genus &quot;Balaenoptera&quot; such as the minke whale; &quot;eo-&quot; is a prefix meaning dawn. The species is named after Carter Harrison, a volunteer worker at the museum.

<text>José de la Torre Ugarte y Alarcón (19 March 1786 – 1 September 1831) was a Peruvian lyricist. He is most notable for writing the lyrics of the National Anthem of Peru.

==Biography==
He was the son of Estanislao de la Torre Ugarte and García Guerrero and Mercedes Alarcón Manrique and Nestares. After completing his school studies at San Luis Gonzaga de Ica, he went to the National University of San Marcos, where he held an Arts degree between 1809 and 1812; already graduated from bachelor in canons (canon law of the legal norms that regulate the organization of a church and the discipline of his parishioners), he was authorized to perform forensic practice in 1810, in the study of Antonio Bedoya, but his final exam was left deferred when he died, despite having other teachers later.

He was one of those summoned by the Cabildo of Lima to decide for the independence of Peru, signing the Act of Independence on July 15, 1821. During the government of José de la Riva Agüero, he was appointed senior officer of the Ministry of War in 1821. He moved to Trujillo in 1823, saving himself from being shot by order of Simón Bolívar, thanks to the intervention of Marshal Antonio Gutiérrez de la Fuente. He was graduated as colonel, and in Trujillo he was a member of the superior court in May 1830.

In 1812, in San Jerónimo de Ica, he married Manuela Valdivieso and Rizo de la Prada, with whom he had three children.

He was the author of the lyrics of the National Anthem, whose music was written by José Bernardo Alcedo. He also wrote the lyrics of the patriotic song &quot;La Chicha&quot;, with music by Alcedo. Late in life he qualified as a lawyer. He also served as war auditor (1827) and member of the Superior Court (1830). He died in Trujillo in 1831.

<text>Manuel Baldomero Ugarte (27 February 1875 – 2 December 1951) was an Argentine writer and leader of the Argentine Socialist Party. He served as an ambassador to Mexico, Nicaragua, and Cuba. He advocated for the unity of Hispanic America, and was a supporter of nationalist anti-imperialism and Hispanicism throughout the Americas and Europe.

==Biography==
Manuel Baldomero Ugarte was born in San José de Flores, now part of the city of Buenos Aires, on 27 February 1875. His father was Floro Ugarte, and his mother was Sabina Rivero. His only brother, Floro Melitón Ugarte, born nine years later than Manuel, was a music composer and director of the famous Colón Theatre in Buenos Aires. His public life began alongside Leopoldo Lugones, Roberto Payró, Alberto Gerchunoff, Manuel Gálvez, and José Ingenieros. He founded &quot;La revista literaria&quot;, which, among others, published the works of Rubén Darío and Ricardo Jaimes Freyre.

Rubén Darío, Miguel de Unamuno, Delmira Agustini, R. Blanco Fombona, Henri Barbusse, Manuel Gálvez, Haya de la Torre, José Vasconscelos, Blanca Luz Brum, and many others, can be considered his friends and correspondents.

=== Political career ===
Manuel represented the Argentine Socialist Party in various congresses of the Second International organization at the beginning of the 20th century. When he abandoned socialism, he became a fervent neutralist during World War I.

General Perón named him ambassador to Mexico in 1946. He later served as ambassador to Nicaragua and Cuba. These nominations, which came close to his death, were the only recognition he received in his country.

=== Death ===
He lived for many years in Paris and Nice in France, and Valparaíso, Chile. He died in Nice, France in December 1951 from gas asphyxiation.

During his life, he visited every single capital city of Latin America to &quot;get to know the region he has committed his life to defend better.&quot; He gave speeches in every country of Ibero-America and in some cities of the United States, Spain, and France.

== Honors ==

<text>George Eugene Uhlenbeck (December 6, 1900 – October 31, 1988) was a Dutch-American theoretical physicist, known for his significant contributions to quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. He is most famous for co-developing the concept of electron spin, alongside Samuel Goudsmit, in 1925. The formalization of Langevin equation for the Brownian motion as a stochastic process, is known as the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, derived in 1930 from his work with Leonard Ornstein.

==Background and education==

George Uhlenbeck was the son of Eugenius and Anne Beeger Uhlenbeck. He attended the Hogere Burgerschool (High School) in The Hague, from which he graduated in 1918.

He subsequently entered Delft University of Technology as a student in chemical engineering. During the next year, he transferred to Leiden University, to study physics and mathematics, and he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1920 (Dutch: &quot;Kandidaatsexamen&quot;). Uhlenbeck was then admitted by Ehrenfest (a student of Boltzmann&#x27;s) to the Wednesday evening physics colloquium in Leiden. Ehrenfest became the most important scientific influence in his life. From 1922 to 1925 Uhlenbeck was the tutor of the younger son of the Dutch ambassador in Rome. While there, he attended lectures by Tullio Levi-Civita and Vito Volterra and met his longtime friend, Enrico Fermi. In 1923, Uhlenbeck received his master&#x27;s degree from Leiden (Dutch: &quot;Doctoraalexamen&quot;).
He returned to Leiden in 1925 to become Ehrenfest&#x27;s assistant. Ehrenfest assigned him to work with his graduate student, Samuel Goudsmit for a quick update on &quot;what was currently happening in physics&quot;. In mid-September 1925, Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit introduced electron spin, which posits intrinsic angular momentum for the electron. In 1927 Uhlenbeck earned his Ph.D. degree under Ehrenfest with his thesis titled: &quot;Over Statistische Methoden in de Theorie der Quanta&quot; (&quot;On Statistical Methods in the Quantum Theory&quot; ).

Uhlenbeck married Else Ophorst in Arnhem, Netherlands in August 1927. He received a doctorate from the Leiden University in the same year.

==Career==

In 1927, Uhlenbeck took a position as an instructor in physics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He stayed there until 1935, when he succeeded H. A. Kramers as a professor of theoretical physics in Utrecht. During his eight years in Ann Arbor, Uhlenbeck organized the noted &quot;Summerschool&quot; in theoretical physics.

In 1938, Uhlenbeck spent half a year as visiting professor at Columbia University in New York City, and then he returned to Ann Arbor as a professor of theoretical physics during the next year. Because of the rise of Nazism in Europe, he and Else decided to leave his position in the Netherlands and return to America.

During part of World War II, from 1943 through 1945, Uhlenbeck led a theory group at the Radiation Laboratory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which was doing radar
research. In 1945, he returned to Ann Arbor, where he was named the Henry Smith Carhart Professor of Physics in 1954. He remained in Ann Arbor until 1960, when he joined the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now the Rockefeller University) in New York City as a professor and member of the institute.

Uhlenbeck developed the physical theory of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process.

==Retirement and death==
He retired in 1971, but remained scientifically active until the early 1980s.

Uhlenbeck died on October 31, 1988, in Boulder, Colorado, at the age of 87.

==Recognition==
Uhlenbeck received five honorary degrees. In addition, he received the Research Corporation award in 1953, the Oersted Medal of the American Association of Physics Teachers in 1955, the Max Planck Medal of the German Physical Society in 1964, the Lorentz Medal of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1970, the National Medal of Science in 1977, along with Goudsmit, and the Wolf Prize in Physics in 1979.

In 1951 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1955, the American Philosophical Society in 1957, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1964.

Uhlenbeck was a friend of many of the great physicists and mathematicians of his era, including Enrico Fermi and Oskar Klein. E.G.D. Cohen, a student of Uhlenbeck&#x27;s, described his teacher:

... [Uhlenbeck] often admonished me that rather than trying to be original, it was much more important to be clear and correct and to summarise critically the present status of a field in the Ehrenfest tradition. He wisely observed that what is often of lasting value is not the first original contribution to a problem, but rather the final clearly and critically written survey. That is certainly what he did in this Brownian motion paper!

Describing Uhlenbeck&#x27;s work, Cohen writes:

Uhlenbeck&#x27;s papers are all relatively short and stand out by their conciseness, precision, and clarity, finely honed to a deeper understanding of a basic problem in statistical physics. They do not contain long formal derivations and are almost all geared to concrete problems. ... they were of a classic nobility, mathematical purity and clarity ... He felt that something really original one did only once – like the electron-spin--the rest of one&#x27;s time one spent on clarifying the basics.

Cohen also comments on the high quality of Uhlenbeck&#x27;s teaching:

He was an inspiring teacher. With superbly organised and extremely clear lectures, he laid bare for everyone to see the beautiful structure of statistical mechanics, based on the principles of the founding fathers, Maxwell, Boltzmann, and Gibbs. Thus he transmitted to a younger generation what he conceived to be the essence of the past and the way to the future. In doing so, he educated several generations of physicists in statistical mechanics in a style rare in this century.

<text>Mohammad Mohammadullah (21 October 1921 – 12 November 1999) was the third president of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh. Mohammadullah became the Acting President on 24 December 1973, was elected president on 24 January 1974, and took oath of office on 27 January 1974. He remained President until 25 January 1975.

==Early life and education==

Mohammadullah was born in Saicha, Raipur, Lakshmipur, on 21 October 1921. His father Munshi Abdul Wahab was a social worker. In 1943, he completed his secondary school certificate from Lakshmipur Adarsha Samad Government High School. Mohammadullah earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree with honours in history from Dhaka University and obtained LLB degree from Ripon College Kolkata and again from Dhaka University in the same year 1948. In 1950, he became a member of the Dhaka Bar. In 1964, he was enrolled in Dhaka High Court as an advocate.

==Political career==
Mohammadullah was an active member of the East Pakistan Awami League from 1950. He had walked into the Awami League office in Nawabpur and told Sheikh Mujibur Rahman he would like to volunteer for Awami League and started working in office management. In 1953, he was elected as office secretary of East Pakistan and held the same position till 1972 after being nominated by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He actively participated in the six point movement in 1966, for which he was jailed for a long time.
Mohammadullah was elected to the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly on the ticket of the Awami League in 1970. He was appointed as the political advisor to the Acting President Syed Nazrul Islam during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971.

On 10 April 1972, he was elected as the Deputy Speaker of the Bangladesh Constituent Assembly (Ganoparishad) and the same year he became the acting Speaker. On 12 November 1972, he was elected Speaker. He was elected to the Member of the Parliament (JS) from the Raipur-Lakshmipur constituency, and was re-elected Speaker of the House again in 1973.

He became the Acting President of the Republic on 24 December 1973 and President on 24 January 1974.
In January 1975, the fourth amendment was passed which removed then President Mohammad Mohammadullah from office and made Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman president for a five-year term.

He was made Minister of Land Administration and Land Reforms in the Cabinet of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on 26 January 1975. He was appointed as the Vice President by collaborators of the Assassination of Sheikh Mujib in August 1975. Mohammadullah joined the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in 1980. He was appointed vice president by President Abdus Sattar in March 1982 but the tenure lasted just a day, because General Hussain Muhammad Ershad took over the reins of administration of the country. Mohammadullah was elected a member of the parliament (JS) once again in 1991 on BNP ticket.

==Death==
Mohammadullah died on 12 November 1999 at the age of 78. He was buried at Banani graveyard near Naval Headquarters.

<text>The Barber Institute of Fine Arts is an art gallery and concert hall in Birmingham, England. It is situated in purpose-built premises on the campus of the University of Birmingham.

The Grade I listed Art Deco building was designed by Robert Atkinson in the 1930s and opened in 1939 by Queen Mary. The first building to be purpose-built for the study of art history in the United Kingdom, it was described by architectural historian Sir John Summerson as representing &quot;better than almost any other building (except, perhaps the RIBA in Portland Place) the spirit of English architecture in the 1930s.&quot; The layout of the museum is centred on a central concert hall which is surrounded by lecture halls, offices and libraries on the ground floor and art galleries on the first floor.

The building also features 2 Heraldic Shields on the exterior of the building, one of the University of Birmingham&#x27;s Shied and one of the Barber Family&#x27;s Shield. Created by the artist Gordon Herickx and produced between 1936-37 through the medium of painted and gilded Darley Dale stone. 

In the 2005 Penguin Books publication &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Museums and Galleries&quot;, the Barber Institute was one of only five galleries outside London to receive five stars for having &quot;Outstanding collections of international significance&quot; (the others were the National Gallery of Scotland, Oxford University&#x27;s Ashmolean Museum, Cambridge University&#x27;s Fitzwilliam Museum and the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool).

The institute is located 5 km southwest of the city centre at the East Gate of the university campus and has one of the outstanding collections of art assembled in Britain in the 20th century, including works by Gwen John, André Derain, Fernand Léger, René Magritte and Egon Schiele. It was set up by Martha Constance Hattie Barber in memory of her husband William Henry Barber, a wealthy property developer who made his fortune expanding Birmingham&#x27;s suburbs. 
Lady Barber was a descendant of the old Worcestershire Onions family of bellows-makers and was an heiress in her own right. By his mid-thirties, the couple had retired but their connections with the city remained strong. In 1924, Henry Barber received a baronetcy for &#x27;Political Services to Birmingham&#x27;.

He died three years later. Lady Barber decided to make a permanent contribution to the city in his memory. On 13 December 1932, the Barber Institute of Fine Arts was founded, and was bequeathed to the university &#x27;for the study and encouragement of art and music&#x27;. Lady Barber died four months later leaving all of her assets to the trustees of the institute. This money was used to acquire works of art for a collection and fund the construction of a new building. In order to ensure that only artworks of the highest quality were bought for the Barber Institute, its founding trust deed stipulated that all purchases should be &#x27;of that standard of quality as required by the National Gallery and the Wallace Collection&#x27;.

The founding director (from 1935 to 1952) was Thomas Bodkin, who acquired the nucleus of the collection described by &quot;The Observer&quot; as &quot;the last great art collection of the twentieth century&quot;. Bodkin&#x27;s successor was Professor Ellis Waterhouse who served from 1952 to 1970. The current director of the Barber is Nicola Kalinsky, previously deputy director and chief curator of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. She joined the Barber in the midst of its 80th anniversary programme as it planned for a major redevelopment of its building.

The building was Grade II listed in 1981 and uprated to Grade I by Historic England in September 2020. The foyer floor, door surrounds and staircase are of travertine marble. The auditorium is panelled in Australian walnut.

On 2 October 2023, the institute temporarily closed for refurbishment; it reopened on 22 June 2024. 
==Collections==
The collection is full of famous works by artists such as Vincent van Gogh, Claude Monet, Auguste Rodin, J. M. W. Turner and Rubens, displayed in spacious and elegant galleries on the first floor of the institute. The Renaissance is represented by masterpieces by Sandro Botticelli, Giovanni Bellini, Veronese and Simone Martini (e.g. his &quot;St John the Evangelist&quot; of 1320), the 17th century by artists including Rubens, Van Dyck, Poussin and Murillo.

The collections of French Impressionism and Post-Impressionism include artworks by Degas, Monet, Renoir, Van Gogh and Gauguin. Among the British artists represented are Aubrey Beardsley, Gainsborough, Reynolds, Rossetti, Whistler and Turner. There is also a fine collection of sculpture (including works by Rodin and Degas), Old Master prints and drawings, portrait miniatures and &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot;. Standing at the entrance is the Equestrian Statue of George I, the oldest public sculpture in Birmingham. In 2013 the gallery acquired an important and commanding late work by Sir Joshua Reynolds: &quot;Maria Marow Gideon (1767–1834) and her Brother William (1775–1805)&quot;, and in 2015 acquired George Bellows&#x27; &quot;Miss Bentham&quot; (1906), its first American painting, and only the second of Bellows&#x27; paintings to enter a public collection in the United Kingdom.

The institute also has one of the world&#x27;s largest coin collections, especially of Roman and Byzantine coins. This outstanding collection was supplemented in 1967 with 15,000 coins, from Phillip Whitting and Geoffrey Haines. Many concerts take place at the Barber throughout the year, as well as a music festival which is held in June.

860 items of the Shaw-Hellier collection are held at the Barber&#x27;s music library.

<doc id="734572" wikidata="Q5765413" url="?curid=734572" title="Victoria Square, Birmingham">
<text>Victoria Square is a pedestrianised public square in Birmingham, England. It is home to both the Town Hall and the Council House, and directly adjacent to Chamberlain Square. It is named in honour of Queen Victoria.

The square is often considered to be the centre of Birmingham, and is the point from where local road sign distances are measured. It is a short walk from St. Philip&#x27;s Cathedral on Colmore Row and is on the main pedestrian route between the Bull Ring and Brindleyplace areas. Three major roads, Colmore Row, New Street and Paradise Street, and others, meet there.

==History==
The square was formerly known as Council House Square, and had a tramway running through it. It was renamed on 10 January 1901, to honour Queen Victoria. She died just 12 days later. A marble statue, donated by Henry Barber and sculpted by Thomas Brock, was erected and unveiled; it was later recast in bronze.

Part of the square was once occupied by Christ Church (built 1805–13), but the church was demolished in 1899. The font, bell and foundation stone were moved to the new St Agatha&#x27;s, Sparkbrook, which was built with the proceeds when the site was sold to developers. The 600 bodies, which included John Baskerville, housed in the catacombs beneath the church were moved to Warstone Lane Cemetery. The site was then used for an office and retail block, Christ Church Buildings, which were themselves demolished in 1970 and replaced with a grassed slope.

During the 1950s, plans were made to widen Colmore Row for it to become part of the Birmingham Inner Ring Road, with a major road junction to be constructed at Victoria Square. These plans were dropped, however a lot of the Inner Ring Road plan was carried through to construction.

==Redevelopment==

During the late 20th century the square was a busy traffic junction. Plans were made to pedestrianise the area and to create a public focal point. An international design competition was held for a central water feature in the square, which was won by Dhruva Mistry. Construction commenced in 1992 and was completed in 1994, when it was officially opened by Diana, Princess of Wales. During the redevelopment of the square, &quot;&quot;, a sculpture by Antony Gormley was installed and unveiled in 1993. A plaque is located on the southwestern side of the square to commemorate the opening.

In June 2018, during work to extend the West Midlands Metro through the square, a cobbled street was uncovered, below the surface of the square.

===Artwork===
Mistry&#x27;s fountain &quot;The River&quot; is the largest sculptural piece in the square Due to the recurring irreparable leaks the fountain was turned off in 2013 in order to save money. From July 2015 to 2022 the fountain was filled with plants and flowers and no longer functioned as a fountain. In 2022 it was repaired and restored ahead of the 2022 Commonwealth Games.
Additionally, there are other pieces not commissioned for the 1992 redevelopment of the square. One of these is Antony Gormley&#x27;s &quot;&quot; which was donated to the city in March 1993 by the Trustee Savings Bank, the headquarters of which was located alongside the square. It is in height, and has been subject to mixed reaction. It was suggested that the statue be moved to the bank&#x27;s headquarters in Bristol when it merged with Lloyds.

There are also statues that existed prior to the redevelopment of the square. Of two statues that were originally located in the square, only one remains. That is the statue of Queen Victoria, which was originally created in 1901 by Thomas Brock, but recast in bronze by William Bloye in 1951. The sceptre capital was missing for some years, but was replaced in 2011, thanks to the research and assistance of the Victorian Society. The plinth was replaced in composite Cornish marble in 1951.

Other statues that no longer stand in the square include a statue of King Edward VII, which was moved to Highgate Park when Victoria Square was remodelled in 1951. Following restoration, it was re-erected, on a new plinth, outside Baskerville House in Centenary Square, in November 2010. There were also statues of Robert Peel, which is now located at the Tally Ho police training centre in Edgbaston; and of Joseph Priestley, which is now in Chamberlain Square. A statue of John Skirrow Wright, unveiled in 1883, was moved to Chamberlain Square in 1913, from there into storage in 1951, and eventually scrapped. A statue of George Dawson was later moved to Edmund Street nearby, but is now in store at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery&#x27;s Museum Collections Centre.

===Buildings===

The square is surrounded by many prominent buildings. On the western side is the Town Hall, on its northern side is the Council House, on its eastern side is 130 Colmore Row and on the south side is Victoria Square House.

==Events==

Every Christmas, Victoria Square forms the centrepiece for the Frankfurt Christmas Market and Craft Fair which also extends into New Street and abuts onto a craft fair in Chamberlain Square, with the city&#x27;s official Christmas tree, donated each year by Sandvik, also standing in the square. The market&#x27;s wooden huts sell items such as jewellery, artwork, ornaments, clothing and German food.

The Birmingham Big Screen is currently standing in the square following its removal from Chamberlain Square, but for some time after assembly in September 2007, it was not used due to a dispute over the planning process for it. After the dispute over the first planning application, which was approved by the council, another was submitted in December 2008. However, the consultation process stalled following an overwhelming number of objections. The dispute over the wide screen has cost million. However, by April 2012 the screen was working.

On 12 July 2012, Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, visited Victoria Square as part of the West Midland Diamond Jubilee Tour. At the Square, they carried out a walk-about and received a gift from the city of Birmingham.

The marathon events in the 2022 Commonwealth Games ended in Victoria Square.

<text>St Kilda Road is a street in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It is part of the locality of Melbourne which has the postcode of 3004, and along with Swanston Street forms a major spine of the city.

St Kilda Road begins at Princes Bridge, which spans the Yarra River and connects the central business district of Melbourne with the suburb of St Kilda, ending at Carlisle Street, St Kilda. The road continues as Brighton Road, which becomes the Nepean Highway, forming a major arterial connecting the bayside suburbs and Mornington Peninsula to the city.

The east side of the road to High Street, Prahran is in the municipality of the City of Melbourne while the west side of the road from Dorcas Street, and the east side south of High Street, is in the municipality of the City of Port Phillip.

The road was the location of many institutions dotted along its length, and was famed for being lined with elegant mansions until the middle of the 20th century. With their replacement by numerous offices from the 1950s- 1980s, it became a commercial centre, and since the 1990s has also become home to many large scale apartment projects.

==History==

In the 1830s the road leading south out of Melbourne towards St Kilda, and on to Brighton, was known variously as the St Kilda Road, the Brighton Road, and Baxter&#x27;s Track, after Melbourne&#x27;s first postmaster, Captain Baxter. The area immediately south of the river was low lying swampy land, which remained mostly vacant crown land for much of the 19th century, with a rise to the east, which the road skirted around, to head south-south east in a straight line towards Brighton. 

The first sale of Crown lands in the seaside locality of St Kilda, connected to St Kilda Road via Fitzroy Street, took place on 7 December 1842. Within a few years, St Kilda became a fashionable area for wealthy settlers, with the high ground above the beach offering a cool fresh breeze during Melbourne&#x27;s hot summer months. The road to the city was impassable by carriage after rain, which turned the road to mud. For the first few years, traffic to the city crossed the Yarra River by privately operated punts. In 1844, a privately built wooden trestle toll bridge was built across the river at Swanston Street.

In 1850, a government-built sandstone bridge, Princes Bridge, replaced the wooden bridge. The bridge was designed by David Lennox, a Scottish-trained engineer who had arrived in Melbourne from New South Wales in 1844. The opening of the bridge was a major occasion, with Superintendent Charles La Trobe and Georgiana McCrae in attendance.

In 1853, the Immigrants&#x27; Aid Society established the Immigrant&#x27;s Home on the east side of St Kilda Road, which accommodated &#x27;neglected&#x27; and orphaned children and also had a reformatory for children. The Home existed until 1902 when it was relocated, and the site became part of the Kings Domain gardens, established in 1854.

Between the city and what is now St Kilda Junction, sites were granted to various institutions, or remained government reserves in the 1850s and 60s. In 1854 the Wesleyan Methodist Church was offered fon the road near the junction, but the foundation stone of Wesley College was not laid until 4 January 1865, and the school was officially opened on 11 January 1866. Much closer to the city, in 1855 the government granted on St Kilda Road to the Anglican Church on which Melbourne Grammar School was built. The foundation stone was laid on 30 July 1856 and the school was officially opened on 7 April 1858.

During the early 1850s, St Kilda Road was the scene of one of the most notorious hold-ups by armed bandits and bushrangers (though this actually took place on what is now known as Brighton Road further south). Victoria Barracks were built between 1856 and 1872. By the 1860s, St Kilda had developed as a desirable seaside suburb, dotted with large houses and grand terraces. St Kilda Road was a main arterial connecting it with Melbourne, and was planned as a wide European-style boulevard to accommodate horse-drawn traffic. The road was properly surfaced for the first time in 1859, and planted with street trees in the 1860s. 

In 1859 lots along the east side were alienated from government land for building lots, opposition was somewhat mollified by the generous 100 ft frontages and the requirement for substantial homes to be built rather than terraces. The land behind became Fawkner Park, created in 1862. In 1875 the west side of the road was subdivided in the same way, and Queens Road was created. By the 1880s the road was lined with large houses, though some were on double or triple lots, and other lots were left vacant. 

In 1865 the government made a grant of land on the corner of St Kilda Road and High Street, just south of Wesley, to the Victorian Deaf and Dumb Institution (now, the Victorian College for the Deaf), which built a blue-stone building which opened in 1866. Two years later, on the north side of Wesley, the Royal Victorian Institute for the Blind opened in buildings very similar in style to the Deaf Institute, designed by the same architects. The Alfred Hospital was established in 1871 on a site fronting Commercial Road, with a boundary to St Kilda Road, later carved off. 

In 1877, Cooper and Bailey&#x27;s Great American International Circus set up on the site of the present Arts Centre. The present Princes Bridge was built in 1888 to replace the 1850 structure, and cable trams commenced running from Swanston Street over the bridge along St Kilda Road to Toorak and St Kilda. At this time, the elm trees were planted along the road. The Prince Henry&#x27;s Hospital (originally called the Melbourne Homoeopathic Hospital) was opened in St Kilda Road in 1885, and existed until 1991.

Until the end of the 19th century, the Yarra River was subject to regular flooding. A new channel for the Yarra River was dug from 1896 to 1900 to straighten and widen the river. The spoil was used to fill the swampy lagoons and brickmakers pits and raise the height of the river bank where Alexandra Gardens now stands. The Gardens were opened in 1901.

In 1901 the Arts Centre site became home to a permanent circus, Olympia, built by the Fitzgerald Brothers&#x27; Circus. In 1904, the area of the site not occupied by Fitzgerald&#x27;s was developed as a fashionable meeting place called Prince&#x27;s Court. This area featured a Japanese Tea House, open-air theatre, miniature train, water chute and a 15-member military band. In 1907, Wirth Brother&#x27;s Circus took over the entire site from Fitzgerald&#x27;s and remained there for the next 50 years. By 1911 they had built a new circus Hippodrome and a roller skating rink, and had leased the original Olympia as a cinema. During World War I some of the buildings were used as nursing homes for soldiers and nurses. During the 1920s a new Green Mill Dance Hall replaced the Jazz Pavilion and Olympia Dancing Palace.

In 1925, electric trams along St Kilda Road and the side streets replaced cable trams, and Princes Bridge was reinforced to take the extra weight of the new trams.

The Melbourne Hebrew Congregation opened a 1300-seat synagogue on the corner of Toorak Road in 1930. During the depression of the 1930s, many of the mansions on St Kilda Road were subdivided into units with extensions to the rear of the buildings, resulting in only a few of them remaining today. The Shrine of Remembrance was completed in September 1934. The Repatriation Commission Outpatient Clinic, the only example of an Art Deco building on St Kilda Road north of Toorak Road, was opened on 15 November 1937.

While large houses continued to be built in the 1900s-1920s, from the 1910s flats also started to emerge, built on former gardens or replacing the earlier houses. Flat development continued in the early the 1950s, such as the high rise Stanhill Flats built on Queens Road, and the elegant Sheridan Close. 

In 1957, the Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Board of Works rezoned the street to allow office development, and in the next two decades most of the remaining houses and even some of the flats were replaced by ever taller office blocks, albeit retaining a substantial garden setback. The area was given the postcode 3004, and was allowed to use the title &quot;Melbourne&quot;, effectively extending the central business district area. The Green Mill Dance Hall closed in 1950 and the remainder of the Wirth buildings on the Arts Centre site were destroyed by fire in 1953. Much of site was used as an outdoor carpark before construction of the National Gallery of Victoria commenced in the early 1960s. The gallery opened in 1968.

In the late 1960s, the Main Roads Board compulsorily acquired much of the land around St Kilda Junction and demolished many of the buildings including the landmark Junction Hotel in order to completely rebuild the junction. Queens Road was connected to Dandenong Road via an underpass.The west side of High Street (from the junction to Carlisle Street) was also acquired and demolished to increase it to the approximate width of St Kilda Road, and renamed St Kilda Road, effectively extending it to Carlisle Street. 

Construction of the Arts Centre began in 1973 following some delays. The complex opened in stages, with Hamer Hall opening in 1982, and the Theatres Building opening in 1984. The redevelopment of the Southbank precinct along the Yarra River commenced in 1990 with the construction of the Southbank Promenade.

In the early 1980s, heritage controls protected the few surviving mansions and notable flats, and a 60m height limit was introduced, bringing uniformity to the street during another boom in office construction.

On 13 February 2017 St Kilda Rd was included on Australia’s National Heritage List. In June 2017, a small number of the elm trees lining St. Kilda Road were cut down for the Melbourne Metro Rail Tunnel project.

==Today==
Today St Kilda Road has been absorbed by the metropolis and the road survives as one of the city&#x27;s major arteries, flanked by a mix of office, residential and mixed use towers.
The street is known for its width and leafiness.
For most of its length, the wide street consists of a wide shared footpath (lined with Elm trees), street side parking, a bicycle lane, two lanes for motor vehicle traffic, median strip reserve (lined with mature London Plane trees), another two lanes for motor vehicle traffic and a tram line on either side.

Melbourne&#x27;s trams travel down the centre of the road along the length of the street.

There have been proposals for a separated bike lane to be installed.

==Landmarks==

<text>Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is a branch of microscopy that forms images of surfaces using a physical probe that scans the specimen. SPM was founded in 1981, with the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope, an instrument for imaging surfaces at the atomic level. The first successful scanning tunneling microscope experiment was done by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer. The key to their success was using a feedback loop to regulate gap distance between the sample and the probe.

Many scanning probe microscopes can image several interactions simultaneously. The manner of using these interactions to obtain an image is generally called a mode.

The resolution varies somewhat from technique to technique, but some probe techniques reach a rather impressive atomic resolution. This is largely because piezoelectric actuators can execute motions with a precision and accuracy at the atomic level or better on electronic command. This family of techniques can be called &quot;piezoelectric techniques&quot;. The other common denominator is that the data are typically obtained as a two-dimensional grid of data points, visualized in false color as a computer image.

==Image formation==
To form images, scanning probe microscopes raster scan the tip over the surface. At discrete points in the raster scan a value is recorded (which value depends on the type of SPM and the mode of operation, see below). These recorded values are displayed as a heat map to produce the final STM images, usually using a black and white or an orange color scale.

===Constant interaction mode===
In constant interaction mode (often referred to as &quot;in feedback&quot;), a feedback loop is used to physically move the probe closer to or further from the surface (in the &quot;z&quot; axis) under study to maintain a constant interaction. This interaction depends on the type of SPM, for scanning tunneling microscopy the interaction is the tunnel current, for contact mode AFM or MFM it is the cantilever deflection, etc. The type of feedback loop used is usually a PI-loop, which is a PID-loop where the differential gain has been set to zero (as it amplifies noise). The &quot;z&quot; position of the tip (scanning plane is the &quot;xy&quot;-plane) is recorded periodically and displayed as a heat map. This is normally referred to as a topography image.

In this mode a second image, known as the ″error signal&quot; or &quot;error image&quot; is also taken, which is a heat map of the interaction which was fed back on. Under perfect operation this image would be a blank at a constant value which was set on the feedback loop. Under real operation the image shows noise and often some indication of the surface structure. The user can use this image to edit the feedback gains to minimise features in the error signal.

If the gains are set incorrectly, many imaging artifacts are possible. If gains are too low features can appear smeared. If the gains are too high the feedback can become unstable and oscillate, producing striped features in the images which are not physical.

===Constant height mode===
In constant height mode the probe is not moved in the &quot;z&quot;-axis during the raster scan. Instead the value of the interaction under study is recorded (i.e. the tunnel current for STM, or the cantilever oscillation amplitude for amplitude modulated non-contact AFM). This recorded information is displayed as a heat map, and is usually referred to as a constant height image.

Constant height imaging is much more difficult than constant interaction imaging as the probe is much more likely to crash into the sample surface. Usually before performing constant height imaging one must image in constant interaction mode to check the surface has no large contaminants in the imaging region, to measure and correct for the sample tilt, and (especially for slow scans) to measure and correct for thermal drift of the sample. Piezoelectric creep can also be a problem, so the microscope often needs time to settle after large movements before constant height imaging can be performed.

Constant height imaging can be advantageous for eliminating the possibility of feedback artifacts.

==Probe tips==
The nature of an SPM probe tip depends entirely on the type of SPM being used. The combination of tip shape and topography of the sample make up a SPM image. However, certain characteristics are common to all, or at least most, SPMs.

Most importantly the probe must have a very sharp apex. The apex of the probe defines the resolution of the microscope, the sharper the probe the better the resolution. For atomic resolution imaging the probe must be terminated by a single atom.

For many cantilever based SPMs (e.g. AFM and MFM), the entire cantilever and integrated probe are fabricated by acid [etching], usually from silicon nitride. Conducting probes, needed for STM and SCM among others, are usually constructed from platinum/iridium wire for ambient operations, or tungsten for UHV operation. Other materials such as gold are sometimes used either for sample specific reasons or if the SPM is to be combined with other experiments such as TERS. Platinum/iridium (and other ambient) probes are normally cut using sharp wire cutters, the optimal method is to cut most of the way through the wire and then pull to snap the last of the wire, increasing the likelihood of a single atom termination. Tungsten wires are usually electrochemically etched, following this the oxide layer normally needs to be removed once the tip is in UHV conditions.

It is not uncommon for SPM probes (both purchased and &quot;home-made&quot;) to not image with the desired resolution. This could be a tip which is too blunt or the probe may have more than one peak, resulting in a doubled or ghost image. For some probes, &quot;in situ&quot; modification of the tip apex is possible, this is usually done by either crashing the tip into the surface or by applying a large electric field. The latter is achieved by applying a bias voltage (of order 10V) between the tip and the sample, as this distance is usually 1-3 Angstroms, a very large field is generated.

The additional attachment of a quantum dot to the tip apex of a conductive probe enables surface potential imaging with high lateral resolution, scanning quantum dot microscopy.

==Advantages==
The resolution of the microscopes is not limited by diffraction, only by the size of the probe-sample interaction volume (i.e., point spread function), which can be as small as a few picometres. Hence the ability to measure small local differences in object height (like that of 135 picometre steps on &lt;100&gt; silicon) is unparalleled. Laterally the probe-sample interaction extends only across the tip atom or atoms involved in the interaction.

The interaction can be used to modify the sample to create small structures (Scanning probe lithography).

Unlike electron microscope methods, specimens do not require a partial vacuum but can be observed in air at standard temperature and pressure or while submerged in a liquid reaction vessel.

==Disadvantages==
The detailed shape of the scanning tip is sometimes difficult to determine. Its effect on the resulting data is particularly noticeable if the specimen varies greatly in height over lateral distances of 10 nm or less.

The scanning techniques are generally slower in acquiring images, due to the scanning process. As a result, efforts are being made to greatly improve the scanning rate. Like all scanning techniques, the embedding of spatial information into a time sequence opens the door to uncertainties in metrology, say of lateral spacings and angles, which arise due to time-domain effects like specimen drift, feedback loop oscillation, and mechanical vibration.

The maximum image size is generally smaller.

Scanning probe microscopy is often not useful for examining buried solid-solid or liquid-liquid interfaces.

== Scanning photo current microscopy (SPCM) ==
SPCM can be considered as a member of the Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) family. The difference between other SPM techniques and SPCM is, it exploits a focused laser beam as the local excitation source instead of a probe tip.

Characterization and analysis of spatially resolved optical behavior of materials is very important in opto-electronic industry. Simply this involves studying how the properties of a material vary across its surface or bulk structure. Techniques that enable spatially resolved optoelectronic measurements provide valuable insights for the enhancement of optical performance. Scanning electron microscopy (SPCM) has emerged as a powerful technique which can investigate spatially resolved optoelectronic properties in semiconductor nano structures.

=== Principle ===
In SPCM, a focused laser beam is used to excite the semiconducting material producing excitons (electro-hole pairs). These excitons undergo different mechanisms and if they can reach the nearby electrodes before the recombination takes place a photocurrent is generated. This photocurrent is position dependent as it, raster scans the device.

=== SPCM analysis ===
Using the position dependent photocurrent map, important photocurrent dynamics can be analyzed.

SPCM provides information such as characteristic length such as minority diffusion length, recombination dynamics, doping concentration, internal electric field  etc.

== Visualization and analysis software ==
In all instances and contrary to optical microscopes, rendering software is necessary to produce images.
Such software is produced and embedded by instrument manufacturers but also available as an accessory from specialized work groups or companies.
The main packages used are freeware: Gwyddion, WSxM (developed by Nanotec) and commercial: SPIP (developed by Image Metrology), FemtoScan Online (developed by Advanced Technologies Center), MountainsMap SPM (developed by Digital Surf), TopoStitch (developed by Image Metrology).

<text>The Transport Museum, Wythall is a transport museum just outside Birmingham, at Chapel Lane, Wythall, Worcestershire, England. The museum was originally run by the charity The Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus Trust (BaMMOT).

BaMMOT was formed in 1977 and the museum site was acquired in February 1978. The museum has three halls, presenting a significant collection of preserved buses and coaches, including Midland Red and Birmingham City Transport vehicles, a collection of battery electric vehicles such as milk floats, and a Tilling-Stevens petrol-electric bus.

In 2016 the Trust became a charitable incorporated organisation called Transport Museum Wythall (TMW), registered number 1167872.

It is also home to the Elmdon Model Engineering Society (EMES) who operate the Wythall miniature railway within the grounds of the transport museum, giving rides to public on miniature steam trains.

<text>The Alfred Jewel is a piece of Anglo-Saxon goldsmithing work made of enamel and quartz enclosed in gold. It was discovered in 1693, in North Petherton, Somerset, England and is now one of the most popular exhibits at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. It has been dated to the late 9th century, in the reign of Alfred the Great, and is inscribed &quot;AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN&quot;, meaning &quot;Alfred ordered me made&quot;. The jewel was once attached to a rod, probably of wood, at its base. After decades of scholarly discussion, it is now &quot;generally accepted&quot; that the jewel&#x27;s function was to be the handle for a pointer stick for following words when reading a book. It is an exceptional and unusual example of Anglo-Saxon jewellery.

== Function and commission ==

Although the function of the Jewel is not absolutely certain, it is believed to have been the handle or terminal for one of the precious &quot;aestels&quot; or staffs that Alfred the Great is recorded as having sent to each bishopric along with a copy of his translation of Pope Gregory the Great&#x27;s book &quot;Pastoral Care&quot;. He wrote in his preface to the book:

And I will send a copy to every bishop&#x27;s see in my kingdom, and in each book there is an aestel of 50 mancusses and I command, in God&#x27;s name, that no man take the staff from the book, nor the book from the church.

&quot;Mancus&quot; was a term used in early medieval Europe to denote either a gold coin, with a weight of gold of 4.25 grams (2.73 dwt; equivalent to the Islamic dinar, and thus lighter than the Byzantine solidus), or a unit of account of thirty silver pence. This made it worth about a month&#x27;s wages for a skilled worker, such as a craftsman or a soldier.

No other context is given in the preface, but in the context of books, the Old English word &quot;aestel&quot; can mean a &quot;guide&quot;, &quot;index&quot;, and also a &quot;handle&quot;; so, it is concluded that it meant a small pointer. Other jewelled objects with a similar form have survived, all with empty sockets, such as a 9th-century example in gold and glass in the British Museum, found in Bowleaze Cove in Dorset (see below), and the &quot;yad&quot; or &quot;Torah pointer&quot; remains in use in Jewish practice. David M. Wilson sounded a note of caution as to the connection with Alfred, noting that &quot;in a period when royal titles meant something, there is no royal title in the inscription&quot;. However the commissioning by Alfred and the function as a pointer handle are taken as firmly established by Leslie Webster in her survey &quot;Anglo-Saxon Art&quot; of 2012, as well as by the Ashmolean. Other functions suggested have been as an ornament for a crown, or as a pendant, though this would display the figure upside down.

== Description ==
The Alfred Jewel is about long and is made of filigreed gold, enclosing a highly polished tear-shaped piece of clear quartz &quot;rock crystal&quot;, beneath which is set a cloisonné enamel plaque, with an image of a man, perhaps Christ, with ecclesiastical symbols. The figure &quot;closely resembles the figure of Sight in the Fuller Brooch, but it is most commonly thought to represent Christ as Wisdom or Christ in Majesty&quot;, according to Wilson, although Webster considers a personification of &quot;Sight&quot; a likely identification, also comparing it to the Fuller Brooch. Around the sides of the crystal there is a rim at the top that holds the rock crystal in place, above an openwork inscription: &quot;AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN&quot; (&quot;Ælfred mec heht ġewyrċan&quot;, ), meaning &quot;Alfred ordered me made&quot;.

An animal head at the base has as its snout a hollow socket, like those found in the other examples, showing that it was intended to hold a thin rod or stick. The back is a flat gold plate engraved with an acanthus-like plant motif, or Tree of Life according to Webster. Like the back of other examples, it is &quot;suitable for sliding smoothly across the surface of a page&quot;. The use of relatively large cells of enamel to create a figurative image is an innovation in Anglo-Saxon art, following Byzantine or Carolingian examples, as is the use of rock crystal as a &quot;see-through&quot; cover. The rock crystal piece may be recycled from a Roman object.

== Later history ==
The jewel was ploughed up in 1693 at Petherton Park, North Petherton in the English county of Somerset, on land owned by Sir Thomas Wroth (–1721). North Petherton is about away from Athelney, where King Alfred founded a monastery. A description of the Alfred Jewel was first published in 1698, in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;. It was bequeathed to Oxford University by Colonel Nathaniel Palmer (–1718), and today is in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. There is a replica of the jewel in the Church of St Mary, North Petherton and also one in the archives at Tamworth Castle. Another replica is on display in the Blake Museum, Bridgwater. In February 2015 the jewel returned to Somerset for the first time in 297 years when it was displayed for a month in the Museum of Somerset, Taunton Castle. In 2018–2019, it was displayed in the British Library, London as part of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms: Art, Word, War&quot; exhibition.

== Similar jewels ==
Since the discovery of the Alfred Jewel, a number of similar objects have been found. All are smaller and less elaborate, but are traceable to the same period and have a socket like that on the Alfred Jewel, suggesting that they were made for the same purpose. Simon Keynes comments that &quot;it is perhaps only a matter of time before another is found in a context that reveals its function&quot;.

*&quot;The Minster Lovell Jewel&quot; – the most similar to the Alfred Jewel, consisting of a round gold disk that contains an enamel plaque of a floral design. It was found in Minster Lovell in Oxfordshire and is held at the Ashmolean Museum.
*&quot;The Warminster Jewel&quot; – consists of filigreed gold strips containing a white rock crystal. A small blue glass stone is held in the middle of the jewel where the gold strips meet. This jewel was discovered in Warminster in Wiltshire and is held in the Salisbury Museum.
*&quot;The Bowleaze Jewel&quot; – made of gold, decorated with beaded wire, granulation, and with a blue glass stone in the middle. It was found at Bowleaze Cove near Weymouth, Dorset and is now in the British Museum.
*&quot;The Yorkshire Aestel&quot; – resembles a golden animal&#x27;s head with blue glass eyes, one of which is missing. It was found in Aughton, Yorkshire, by Tim Pearson and was sold as &quot;lot 312&quot; in Bonhams&#x27; Antiquities auction on 15 October 2008 for £10,800. This is the only privately owned aestel.
*&quot;The Borg Aestel&quot; – decorated with a pattern of spirals of gold wire. It was found in the ruins of a Viking Age Chieftain Hall at Borg in the Lofoten Islands in Norway, and is now in the Lofotr Viking Museum. Alfred is known to have been visited by a powerful trader called Ottar, who was native to the Lofoten Islands, so it is possible that Alfred gave him the jewel as a gift. Alternatively, and perhaps more likely, it was Viking loot, like most Anglo-Saxon finds in Scandinavia.
*&quot;The Bidford Bobble&quot; – the smallest of the jewels. Its round head is made of patterned gold with blue and red enamel pieces. It was found in Bidford-on-Avon in Warwickshire in 1999 and now belongs to the Warwickshire Museum Service.

The above six objects, along with the Alfred Jewel, were exhibited together in Winchester Discovery Centre in 2008, as the centrepiece of an exhibition of relics of Alfred the Great.

*A gilded copper-alloy example, incorporating a pierced Celtic type cross, was found in excavations at Berkeley Castle, Gloucestershire in 2008.
*A gold domed object with a blue glass stone in the middle, probably an aestel, was discovered at Drinkstone, Suffolk in 2014. It is now in the Moyse&#x27;s Hall Museum in Bury St Edmunds.
*A gilt copper-alloy finial in the shape of a cross was found in Whissonsett, Norfolk, also in 2014. However, its function as an aestel is more debatable.
*A fragmentary gilded copper-alloy socketed object was found in Send, Surrey, in 2016. Again, its function as an aestel is debatable.

==Alexander the Great theory==

In a paper published in 2014, Sir John Boardman endorsed the earlier suggestion by David Talbot Rice that the figure on the jewel was intended to represent Alexander the Great. A medieval legend in the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; had Alexander, wishing to see the whole world, first descending into the depths of the ocean in a sort of diving bell, then wanting to see the view from above. To do this he harnessed two large birds, or griffins in other versions, with a seat for him between them. To entice them to keep flying higher he placed meat on two skewers which he held above their heads. This was quite commonly depicted in several medieval cultures, from Europe to Persia, where it may reflect earlier legends or iconographies. Sometimes the beasts are not shown, just the king holding two sticks with flower-like blobs at their ends.

The scene is shown in the famous 12th-century floor mosaic in Otranto Cathedral in southern Italy, with a &quot;titulus&quot; of &quot;ALEXANDER REX&quot;. The scene refers to knowledge coming through sight, and so would be appropriate for an aestel. Boardman detects the same meaning in the figure representing sight on the Anglo-Saxon Fuller Brooch.

== Cultural references ==
The Early English Text Society, a text publication society founded in 1864 to publish Anglo-Saxon and medieval English texts, uses a representation of the enamel plaque of the Jewel (omitting the gold frame) as its emblem.

The Society for Medieval Archaeology, established in 1957, uses a representation of the Jewel as a logo. It was drawn by Eva Sjoegren (wife of David M. Wilson, one of the founders), appeared prominently on the front cover of &quot;Medieval Archaeology&quot;, the society&#x27;s journal, from 1957 to 2010, and continues to appear on the title page.

In the epic poem &quot;The Ballad of the White Horse&quot; by G. K. Chesterton (1911), King Alfred offers the Jewel to the Virgin Mary on the island of Athelney.

A replica of the Jewel is given as a birthday present in chapter six of Nancy Mitford&#x27;s comic novel, &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot; (1945).

In Susan Cooper&#x27;s &quot;The Dark is Rising&quot; (1973), one of the six Signs of the Light, the Sign of Fire, is based on the Jewel. It also is made with gold and bears the inscription &quot;LIHT MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN&quot;, or &quot;The Light ordered me made&quot;.

The Jewel is referred to in Roy Harper&#x27;s 19-minute song &quot;One of Those Days in England (Parts 2–10)&quot; from the album &quot;Bullinamingvase&quot; (1977).

The Inspector Morse episode &quot;The Wolvercote Tongue&quot; (1987) centres on the theft of a fictional Saxon artefact based on the Jewel.

A near identical aestel (with the Christ-like figure wearing a red tunic instead of a green one) appeared in BBC Four&#x27;s &quot;Detectorists&quot; in 2015, first appearing in series two, and playing a more pivotal role in the following Christmas Special.

In an episode of the historical fiction series &quot;The Last Kingdom&quot;, Alfred sends out his nephew Aethelwold as his envoy and hands him the Jewel to use as a sign of Alfred&#x27;s royal authority.

<text>Bo Östen Undén (25 August 1886 – 14 January 1974) was a Swedish academic (J.D.), civil servant and Social Democratic politician who served as acting Prime Minister of Sweden 6–11 October 1946, following the death of Per Albin Hansson (1885-1946).

==Biography==
In 1917, he was appointed professor and head of the department of civil law at Uppsala University, but he came to divide his career between politics and academia, which prompted his resignation from the position as rector magnificus (1929–1932) of that university. He served as the foreign ministry&#x27;s expert on international law, as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden 1924–1926 and 1945–1962, minister without portfolio 1917–1920 and 1932–1936, the government&#x27;s chancellor for universities 1937–1951, and he chaired the parliament&#x27;s committee on foreign relations during World War II.

In 1930–33, as a League of Nations arbiter, Undén ruled in favour of Bulgaria in a dispute with Greece regarding the ownership of 19 forests in the Dospat region of southwestern Bulgaria. In 1936, the summit of Dikchan () in the surrounding Rhodope Mountains was named Unden Peak or Professor Unden Peak after the Swedish arbiter. A bronze memorial plate featuring the Bulgarian and Swedish coats of arms and an inscription regarding the name&#x27;s origin were placed on top of the peak.

Östen Undén was much respected, particularly within the Social Democratic Party, but was never uncontroversial. He belonged, together with Ernst Wigforss (1881–1977) clearly to the left-wing faction of the Social Democrats, and has in retrospect been criticised for a much too rosy view of the Soviet Union that remained for all of his time as Foreign Minister, ending in 1962.

At the same time, Undén must be acknowledged as a chief representative for Sweden&#x27;s covert Cold War adaptation to the United States, as in his view Swedish governmental agencies, including the Defence Forces, were free to conclude any agreements with foreign powers and agencies that did not literally contradict international treaties Sweden was a party of as long as he and his ministry were not formally involved. As an effect, the Swedish government could even, before the founding of NATO, agree to build air bases in eastern Scandinavia suitable for bombing missions against Leningrad. A similar adaptation included integration in the US embargo policy from the Korean War.

In 1961, his &quot;Undén Proposal&quot; argued that states without nuclear weapons should declare that they refused to produce such weapons and refuse to receive and store such weapons. Undén&#x27;s proposal was accepted by the United Nations General Assembly as a UN resolution with 58 votes in favour (Scandinavia, Warsaw pact, third world countries), 10 votes against (NATO members) and 23 votes of abstention (Latin America, former French colonies in Africa).

<text>Oscar Wilder Underwood (May 6, 1862 – January 25, 1929) was an American lawyer and politician from Alabama, and also a candidate for President of the United States in 1912 and 1924. He was the first formally designated floor leader in the United States Senate, and the only individual to serve as the Democratic leader in both the Senate and the United States House of Representatives.

Born in Louisville, Kentucky, Underwood began a legal career in Minnesota after graduating from the University of Virginia. He moved his legal practice to Birmingham, Alabama, in 1884 and won election to the House of Representatives in 1894. Underwood served as House Majority Leader from 1911 to 1915, and was a strong supporter of President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s progressive agenda and a prominent advocate of a reduction in the tariff. He sponsored the Revenue Act of 1913, also known as the Underwood Tariff, which lowered tariff rates and imposed a federal income tax. He won election to the Senate in 1914 and served as Senate Minority Leader from 1920 to 1923. He unsuccessfully opposed federal Prohibition, arguing that state and local governments should regulate alcohol.

Underwood sought the presidential nomination at the 1912 Democratic National Convention, but the convention selected Woodrow Wilson after forty-six ballots. He declined the vice presidential nomination, which instead went to Thomas R. Marshall. Underwood ran for president again in 1924, entering the 1924 Democratic National Convention as a prominent conservative opponent of the Ku Klux Klan. One of the few prominent anti-Klan politicians in the South at the time, Underwood and his supporters narrowly failed to win adoption of a Democratic resolution condemning the Klan. He experienced a boomlet of support on the 101st presidential ballot of the convention, but the Democrats nominated John W. Davis as a compromise candidate. Underwood declined to run for re-election in 1926 and retired to his Woodlawn plantation in Fairfax County, Virginia, where he died in 1929.

==Early and family life==
Underwood was born in Louisville, Kentucky, on May 6, 1862, the eldest of three sons of lawyer and planter Eugene Underwood and his second wife, Frederica Virginia Wilder. Eugene Underwood also had three sons with his first wife before her death in 1857. His paternal grandfather, Joseph R. Underwood, served as U.S. Representative and Senator from Kentucky, as well as on the Kentucky Supreme Court. His maternal grandfather, cotton merchant Jabez Smith, once served as mayor of Petersburg, Virginia.

In 1865, the Underwood family moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, hoping the climate would help Oscar&#x27;s chronic bronchitis, as well as his mother&#x27;s health. After ten years, the family moved back to Louisville, where Oscar graduated from the Rugby University School, an exclusive private school, in 1879. He then attended the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, where he was president of the Jefferson Society, as well as excelled in debate. He also received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Columbia University in 1912 and Harvard University in 1922. He served as president of the University of Virginia Alumni Association in 1913 and 1914.

Oscar Underwood married twice, the first time in Charlottesville on October 8, 1885, to Eugenia Massie, daughter of Dr. Thomas Eugene Massie. They had two sons before she died in 1900: John Lewis Underwood (1888–1973) and Oscar Wilder Underwood Jr. (1890–1962). Underwood remarried on September 10, 1904, to Bertha Woodward (1870–1948), daughter of Union Army veteran Joseph Hershey Woodward (1843–1917) of the Woodward Iron Company and his wife Martha Burt (both of Ohio County in what became West Virginia), who survived him.

==Career==
After graduation, Underwood returned to Minnesota to begin his legal career. However, his older half brother William soon convinced him of better opportunities awaiting in Birmingham, Alabama. There, he moved in September 1884 and established a successful legal practice, working for a decade, including with James J. Garrett.

==Political career==
Alabama earned an additional seat after the census of 1890, and Underwood became chairman of the new 9th District&#x27;s Democratic Committee in 1892. Two years later, voters elected him as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives. However, Truman H. Aldrich successfully challenged that election result, forcing Underwood to resign in the middle of the term, on June 9, 1896.

However, Underwood persisted, and campaigned for tariff reform. He won the seat again in the election at year&#x27;s end, then re-election numerous times, serving nine terms (from 1897 to 1915). Underwood became as the first Democratic House Minority Whip, serving from about 1900 to 1901. He then became House Majority Leader from 1911 to 1915.

He was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1912 and had some strength at the national convention among southern delegates but could not compete with Champ Clark and Woodrow Wilson. At the convention that year in Baltimore, Wilson&#x27;s managers offered Underwood the vice-presidential nomination, which he declined. Following the election, Underwood supported the progressive reforms of Wilson&#x27;s first term, using his position as Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee to manage legislation and maintain party discipline. In return, Wilson granted him considerable control over patronage and appointed Albert S. Burleson Postmaster-General upon Underwood&#x27;s recommendation. The Revenue Act of 1913 is also known as the Underwood Tariff Act or Underwood-Simmons Act in recognition of Underwood&#x27;s role in writing and managing the bill as Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. He stood with a small minority of House members in opposition to the President when he voted to maintain an exemption from Panama Canal tolls for American ships traveling between American ports, despite British protests that the policy violated the Hay–Pauncefote Treaty.

Underwood twice won election to the United States Senate, in 1914 and 1920, and served there from March 4, 1915, to March 3, 1927. He was Senate minority leader from 1920 to 1923. Underwood was part of the four-person American delegation at the 1921-22 Washington Naval Conference. There, he helped negotiate the Five-Power Treaty limiting American, British, Japanese, French, and Italian naval armament.

He opposed federal Prohibition as &quot;an attempt to rob the states of their jurisdiction over police matters&quot; and advocated local control of liquor regulation because &quot;the improved conditions which we may naturally expect to find in the lives of the men and women who practice Temperance are not found to predominate in the state where Prohibition laws have been on the statute books for years as compared to those states where liquor is sold under a license system or where Temperance laws are controlled by the sentiment of the local communities.&quot;

Underwood led the anti-Ku Klux Klan forces at the 1924 Democratic National Convention. He was a longtime opponent of the Klan. In 1924, when the Klan organized a parade in Birmingham during that year&#x27;s Democratic National Convention, Underwood called it an effort &quot;to intimidate me, the Alabama delegation and the Democratic Party...It will not succeed...I maintain that the organization is a national menace...It is either the Ku Klux Klan or the United States of America. Both cannot survive. Between the two, I choose my country.&quot; By 1924 Underwood was one of very few anti-Klan officeholders left in the South.

He blamed the Klan&#x27;s opposition to his candidacy for his loss in the Georgia presidential primary to former Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo. He then determined to embarrass McAdoo by putting the party on record against the Klan. Even before the Convention considered its platform, the speech nominating Underwood called for the condemnation of the Klan and produced a lengthy floor demonstration. The attempt to modify the platform to condemn the Klan by name produced rousing demonstrations and speeches, many, including that of William Jennings Bryan, interrupted by the anti-Klan crowds that filled the galleries. The Convention&#x27;s final vote, though contested, defeated the minority proposal naming the Klan by a vote of 542 3/20 to 541 3/20. The fight proved a polarizing battle that made each of the Convention&#x27;s two major candidates unacceptable to large segments of the party, without enhancing Underwood&#x27;s chances in the least.

The Convention was marked by a deadlock between the supporters of the Irish Catholic New York Governor Al Smith and McAdoo, while the Convention&#x27;s rules required a two-thirds vote to secure the nomination. Several delegations declined to support either of the leading candidates and persisted in voting for their state&#x27;s &quot;favorite son&quot; instead. Like the other favorite son candidates, Underwood resisted efforts to remove the convention&#x27;s two-thirds rule. As the Convention labored through 103 ballots, Alabama, as the first state alphabetically, cast its votes first. The delegation&#x27;s leader, Governor William W. Brandon, reported the state&#x27;s unanimous vote tally each time without variation: &quot;Alabama casts 24 votes for Oscar W. Underwood.&quot; Underwood became a symbol of the Convention&#x27;s deadlock. His vote totals were meager, fewer than 50, until the deadlock broke and on the 101st ballot he won 229.5, but his anti-prohibition, anti-Klan stances made him a most unlikely compromise candidate and the Convention turned to John W. Davis of West Virginia, whose work as a Wall Street lawyer proved less of a political hurdle for the delegates.

Underwood declined to run for reelection to the Senate in 1926. His anti-Klan stance had upset some in his own party and as well as from the Klan, and Hugo Black was a formidable candidate.

In 1927, Underwood was appointed to an international peace commission. In 1928, Underwood supported New York Governor Al Smith for president.

==Later life==
In retirement, he and his second wife lived at Woodlawn plantation, a historic house associated with George Washington near Alexandria, Virginia. There, Underwood wrote his only published book, an analysis of the transformation of American government in the 20th century, &quot;Drifting Sands of Party Politics&quot;, which appeared in 1928. He decried federal legislation aimed at regulating morality, government by commissions, and excessive American engagement in foreign affairs.

==Death and legacy==
Underwood suffered two disabling strokes in the winter of 1928–29. He died on January 25, 1929, at Woodlawn plantation. Pursuant to his wishes, his corpse was returned to Alabama, and buried beside his first wife in Birmingham&#x27;s Elmwood Cemetery. His second wife was later buried with him, as was his son John Lewis Underwood (1888–1973). His son Oscar Wilder Underwood Jr. (1890–1962), who served with distinction as a U.S. Army Captain in World War I, later became a law professor at the University of Virginia.

Most of Underwood&#x27;s papers are held by the Alabama Department of Archives and History, with some made available free online. Some of the family&#x27;s papers are also held by his alma mater, the University of Virginia.

Future President John F. Kennedy mentioned Underwood as one of his &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; for his stand against the Klan. Underwood&#x27;s former home in Washington, D.C., the Oscar W. Underwood House, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. Woodlawn plantation was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, and designated a national landmark in 1998. In 1990, Underwood was inducted into the Alabama Men&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

<text>Osman Zeki Üngör (; 1880 – 28 February 1958) was a Turkish composer, violin virtuoso and lyricist, who served as the first conductor of the Presidential Symphony Orchestra of Turkey.

Üngör helped establish the State Conservatory of Turkey and served as its first headmaster, involving himself actively in the creation of laws whereby the education of students with special artistic talent would be wholly sponsored by the government.

Notable works include the symphonic arrangement of the original 1921 score for the Turkish National Anthem, İlim Marşı, Azm-ü Ümit Marşı, Töre Marşı, Türk Çocukları, and Cumhuriyet Marşı.

==Biography==
Üngör was born in Üsküdar, Istanbul in 1880 as the son of a sugar merchant and the grandson of Santuri Hilmi Bey who himself is a musician in the Ottoman Imperial Court and the founder of the Fasl-ı Cedid body of the Muzika-i Hümayun (&quot;The New Fasıl Division&quot; of the Ottoman Imperial Orchestra).
After completing his education at the middle school of the Beşiktaş Military Academy, he was admitted into the Musical Academy of the Ottoman Imperial Orchestra in 1891 at the age of 11, where he garnered the attention of his instructors as well as that of Sultan Abdul Hamid II with his talent, who soon placed him under the instruction of Chief Violinist Vondra Bey and d’Aradna Pasha. Formally becoming a concert violinist following the completion of his musical education, Üngör continued to ascend the ranks of the Ottoman Imperial Orchestra, soon becoming first violinist, and ultimately, conductor in 1917.

He was a driving force in transforming the Muzika-i Hümayun from an orchestra that primarily performed military marches into a symphonic orchestra in the true Western sense.

Üngör complemented his orchestra duties with musical instruction, offering music classes at the Imperial Orchestra and the Istanbul Erkek Lisesi, as well as offering weekly public concerts at the Union Française. He additionally conducted performance in Vienna, Berlin, Dresden, Munich, Budapest and Sofia.

Üngör wrote symphonic arrangement for the Turkish National Anthem in 1922, composed to the lyrics written by the poet Mehmet Akif Ersoy. He subsequently became the first conductor of the newly established Presidential Symphony Orchestra of the Republic of Turkey, relocating to Ankara around 1924 in the process.

He was a key figure in the establishment of the Musik-i Muallim Cemiyeti, currently the State Conservatory at Hacettepe University, and served as its headmaster between the years 1924-1934. During this time, he was actively involved in the creation of laws regarding the government sponsorship and training abroad of especially talented young artists.

Following his retirement in 1934, Üngör spent his remaining days in his home at the Maçka Palas in Istanbul, dying on February 28, 1958, at the age of 78. His last wish of having the Istiklal Marsi performed at his ceremony was honored by the Government, making him the second person in the history of the Republic after Ersoy to have the national anthem performed at his funeral. His current resting place is at the Karacaahmet Cemetery in Üsküdar, Istanbul.

He had one son, Ekrem Zeki, who followed in Üngör’s footsteps to become a violinist and music instructor.

<text>Rodney Terence Argent (born 14 June 1945) is an English musician. In a career spanning more than 50 years, Argent came to prominence in the mid-1960s as the keyboardist, founder and leader of the rock band the Zombies, and went on to form the band Argent after the first break-up of the Zombies.

Argent is one of the main composers of the Zombies&#x27; music and made major lyrical contributions to the band&#x27;s songs. As the band&#x27;s keyboardist he used a variety of instruments, including Hohner Pianet, Mellotron, harpsichord, and organ.

In addition to his work with the Zombies and Argent, Argent has made music for television series, been a session musician, produced albums by other artists, and had a solo career which has included three studio albums: &quot;Moving Home&quot;, &quot;Red House&quot;, and &quot;Classically Speaking&quot;. Argent was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Zombies in Brooklyn in March 2019.

==Early years==
Argent was born in St Albans, Hertfordshire, into a working-class family. His father, Les Argent, was an aeronautical engineer who machined parts at the De Havilland aircraft factory; he had also been the leader of two semi-professional dance bands, the Les Argent Quartet and Les Argent and his Rhythm Kings. Although his father did not teach Argent music, he was raised hearing him playing the upright piano in the family home. Argent&#x27;s mother was one of eight children, and Argent grew up with &quot;a substantial network of cousins, uncles and aunts&quot; living in the town.

He decided to become a musician &quot;aged eight or nine&quot;, and as a child, he sang as a chorister in the St Albans Cathedral Choir. While at St Albans School, he met Paul Atkinson and Hugh Grundy. Argent, Atkinson, and Grundy first played together at a jam on Easter 1961 in St Albans.

Argent wanted to form a band and initially asked his cousin Jim Rodford to join as a bass guitarist. Rodford was playing in local band called the Bluetones at the time, so declined. Colin Blunstone and Paul Arnold joined the new band in early 1961, while all five members were still at school. Arnold left not long after and was replaced by Chris White. After the band won a local contest, they recorded a demo as their prize. Argent&#x27;s song &quot;She&#x27;s Not There&quot; got them a recording contract with Decca.

==Career==
===The Zombies===
In addition to playing the piano and keyboards in the Zombies, Argent was (with White) one of the group&#x27;s two main songwriters, penning the hits &quot;She&#x27;s Not There&quot;, &quot;Tell Her No&quot;, and &quot;Time of the Season&quot;, amongst others. Argent was initially the group&#x27;s lead singer, with Blunstone on guitar. When Argent&#x27;s keyboard talents became apparent, he became the group&#x27;s full-time keyboard player, conceding the role of lead singer to Blunstone. The group continued to record through the 1960s, but disbanded in December 1967, reportedly over management disagreements.

===Argent===
After the band broke up, Argent went on to form the band Argent, which had a hit album in 1972 with &quot;All Together Now&quot;, which contained the single &quot;Hold Your Head Up&quot;. His Hammond B3 solo on that track was cited by Rick Wakeman as the &quot;greatest organ solo ever&quot;. The band also recorded the original version of the rock anthem &quot;God Gave Rock and Roll to You&quot;, written by lead singer Russ Ballard, which was later covered by other artists including Petra and Kiss. Argent&#x27;s first album included the song &quot;Liar&quot; (also composed by Ballard), which became a hit for Three Dog Night. In 1976, the band broke up.

===Solo career===
In 1978, Argent released his debut solo album &quot;Moving Home&quot; with many well-known musicians, including Gary Moore, Genesis drummer Phil Collins, and Weather Report bass guitarist Alphonso Johnson. In 1980, he wrote a musical titled &quot;Masquerade&quot; which premiered in London in 1982. In 1988, he issued another solo album, &quot;Red House&quot;.

Argent went on to play keyboards with a number of musicians, including piano on the title track of The Who&#x27;s album &quot;Who Are You&quot;, and on &quot;Variations&quot; with Gary Moore, Julian Lloyd Webber, and Andrew Lloyd Webber. In the 1980s he began writing for television. In 1986, he composed the theme music for ITV&#x27;s coverage of the 1986 FIFA World Cup, &quot;Aztec Gold&quot;, which he released as a single under the name of &quot;Silsoe&quot;. Also in 1986, he composed the theme music for ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Two of Us&quot; and for 1987&#x27;s LWT series Bust. Two years later, the Argent/Van Hooke composition &quot;Goal Crazy&quot; was used by ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Match&quot; from 1988 until 1992; and the duo also composed the now-familiar theme music for ITV&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;ll Be Alright On The Night&quot;, first used in series 6 in 1990 and then until 2008. Argent also composed the theme music to the ITV (LWT) sitcom &quot;The Piglet Files&quot;, which aired from 1990 to 1992.

In 1987, Argent formed a production company with ex-Van Morrison drummer Peter Van Hooke which produced a number of artists. In 1995, Argent produced Soraya&#x27;s debut album &quot;On Nights Like This&quot; and her second album &quot;Wall Of Smiles&quot;. Other albums the business partners produced included Tanita Tikaram&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Heart&quot; (1988), Nanci Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Late Night Grande Hotel&quot; (1991), Joshua Kadison&#x27;s &quot;Painted Desert Serenade&quot; (1993), and Jules Shear&#x27;s &quot;Healing Bones&quot; (1994).

In 1999, Argent recorded a solo piano album, &quot;Rod Argent Classically Speaking&quot;, in which he played Chopin études and music by Ravel, Bach, and Grieg, as well as three of his own compositions. In 2006, Argent joined Hamish Stuart, Richard Marx, Billy Squier, Edgar Winter and Sheila E. to tour with Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band.

===The Zombies reunion===

In 2004, Argent and Colin Blunstone recorded a new album, &quot;As Far as I Can See...&quot;, in the style of The Zombies. A subsequent album and DVD &quot;Colin Blunstone &amp; Rod Argent of the Zombies Live at the Bloomsbury Theatre&quot; received favourable reviews, as did their 2007 US tour. One critic noted, &quot;The Zombies, still led by original keyboard wizard Rod Argent and featuring the smoked-silk vocals of Colin Blunstone, is the best 60s band still touring which doesn&#x27;t have Mick Jagger as a front man&quot;.

Argent continued to tour with Colin Blunstone as The Zombies, and in March 2008 the original surviving members of the band played three reunion concerts at the Shepherd’s Bush Empire, performing the album &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot;. The band were introduced by Al Kooper, who had discovered the album in a record shop in Carnaby Street in London after the band had broken up. He promoted it on radio stations in the US, leading to &quot;Time of the Season&quot; becoming a Top 3 hit in the singles charts. The sold out concerts (attended by several DJs and musical celebrities) led to a band reunion. In a 2015 interview with &quot;PopMatters&quot; journalist J.C. Maçek III about the Zombies&#x27; latest album &quot;Still Got That Hunger&quot;, Argent said &quot;&quot;Still Got That Hunger&quot; is the first album that has really recaptured some of the resonance of feeling of a group. We&#x27;re so tight as a group together now. And the whole process has become so organic that we&#x27;re 100% happy with the Zombies name and rediscovering and playing all the old stuff and at the same time carving a new path forward which is also very, very important to us.&quot;

In 2012, Argent participated in the unveiling of a Blue Plaque at The Blacksmith&#x27;s Arms, a pub in St Albans where the Zombies met for their first rehearsal.

==Personal life==
Argent and his wife Cathy met at a party in 1967, and they married in 1972. They have two children, Elesa and Mark. In July 2024, Argent, at 79 years old, suffered a stroke, and on 11 July 2024 he announced his retirement from touring.

<text>In mathematics, the Lucas sequences formula_1 and formula_2 are certain constant-recursive integer sequences that satisfy the recurrence relation

: formula_3

where formula_4 and formula_5 are fixed integers. Any sequence satisfying this recurrence relation can be represented as a linear combination of the Lucas sequences formula_6 and formula_7

More generally, Lucas sequences formula_6 and formula_2 represent sequences of polynomials in formula_4 and formula_5 with integer coefficients.

Famous examples of Lucas sequences include the Fibonacci numbers, Mersenne numbers, Pell numbers, Lucas numbers, Jacobsthal numbers, and a superset of Fermat numbers (see below). Lucas sequences are named after the French mathematician Édouard Lucas.

== Recurrence relations ==

Given two integer parameters formula_4 and formula_5, the Lucas sequences of the first kind formula_1 and of the second kind formula_15 are defined by the recurrence relations:

:formula_16

and

:formula_17

It is not hard to show that for formula_18,

:formula_19

The above relations can be stated in matrix form as follows:
: formula_20
&lt;br&gt;
: formula_21
&lt;br&gt;
: formula_22

== Examples ==

Initial terms of Lucas sequences formula_1 and formula_15 are given in the table:
:formula_25

== Explicit expressions ==

The characteristic equation of the recurrence relation for Lucas sequences formula_1 and formula_15 is:
:formula_28

It has the discriminant formula_29 and the roots:
:formula_30

Thus:
:formula_31
:formula_32
:formula_33

Note that the sequence formula_34 and the sequence formula_35 also satisfy the recurrence relation. However these might not be integer sequences.

=== Distinct roots ===
When formula_36, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are distinct and one quickly verifies that

:formula_37

:formula_38

It follows that the terms of Lucas sequences can be expressed in terms of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; as follows

:formula_39

:formula_40
=== Repeated root ===

The case formula_41 occurs exactly when formula_42 for some integer &quot;S&quot; so that formula_43. In this case one easily finds that

:formula_44

:formula_45

== Properties ==

=== Generating functions ===

The ordinary generating functions are
:formula_46
:formula_47

=== Pell equations ===

When formula_48, the Lucas sequences formula_6 and formula_2 satisfy certain Pell equations:
:formula_51
:formula_52

=== Relations between sequences with different parameters ===

*For any number &quot;c&quot;, the sequences formula_53 and formula_54 with
::formula_55
::formula_56
:have the same discriminant as formula_6 and formula_2: 
:: formula_59

*For any number &quot;c&quot;, we also have
:: formula_60
:: formula_61

=== Other relations ===

The terms of Lucas sequences satisfy relations that are generalizations of those between Fibonacci numbers formula_62 and Lucas numbers formula_63. For example:
:formula_64

=== Divisibility properties ===

Among the consequences is that formula_65 is a multiple of formula_66, i.e., the sequence formula_67
is a divisibility sequence. This implies, in particular, that formula_1 can be prime only when &quot;n&quot; is prime.
Another consequence is an analog of exponentiation by squaring that allows fast computation of formula_1 for large values of &quot;n&quot;. 
Moreover, if formula_70, then formula_67 is a strong divisibility sequence.

Other divisibility properties are as follows:
* If &quot;n&quot; is an odd multiple of &quot;m&quot;, then formula_72 divides formula_73.
* Let &quot;N&quot; be an integer relatively prime to 2&quot;Q&quot;. If the smallest positive integer &quot;r&quot; for which &quot;N&quot; divides formula_74 exists, then the set of &quot;n&quot; for which &quot;N&quot; divides formula_75 is exactly the set of multiples of &quot;r&quot;.
* If &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; are even, then formula_76 are always even except formula_77.
* If &quot;P&quot; is odd and &quot;Q&quot; is even, then formula_76 are always odd for every formula_79.
* If &quot;P&quot; is even and &quot;Q&quot; is odd, then the parity of formula_75 is the same as &quot;n&quot; and formula_73 is always even.
* If &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; are odd, then formula_76 are even if and only if &quot;n&quot; is a multiple of 3.
* If &quot;p&quot; is an odd prime, then formula_83 (see Legendre symbol).
* If &quot;p&quot; is an odd prime which divides &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;, then &quot;p&quot; divides formula_75 for every formula_85.
* If &quot;p&quot; is an odd prime which divides &quot;P&quot; but not &quot;Q&quot;, then &quot;p&quot; divides formula_75 if and only if &quot;n&quot; is even.
* If &quot;p&quot; is an odd prime which divides &quot;Q&quot; but not &quot;P&quot;, then &quot;p&quot; never divides formula_75 for any formula_79.
* If &quot;p&quot; is an odd prime which divides &quot;D&quot; but not &quot;PQ&quot;, then &quot;p&quot; divides formula_75 if and only if &quot;p&quot; divides &quot;n&quot;.
* If &quot;p&quot; is an odd prime which does not divide &quot;PQD&quot;, then &quot;p&quot; divides formula_90, where formula_91.

The last fact generalizes Fermat&#x27;s little theorem. These facts are used in the Lucas–Lehmer primality test.
Like Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, the converse of the last fact holds often, but not always; there exist composite numbers &quot;n&quot; relatively prime to &quot;D&quot; and dividing formula_90, where formula_93. Such composite numbers are called Lucas pseudoprimes.

A prime factor of a term in a Lucas sequence which does not divide any earlier term in the sequence is called primitive.
Carmichael&#x27;s theorem states that all but finitely many of the terms in a Lucas sequence have a primitive prime factor. Indeed, Carmichael (1913) showed that if &quot;D&quot; is positive and &quot;n&quot; is not 1, 2 or 6, then formula_75 has a primitive prime factor. In the case &quot;D&quot; is negative, a deep result of Bilu, Hanrot, Voutier and Mignotte shows that if &quot;n&quot; &gt; 30, then formula_75 has a primitive prime factor and determines all cases formula_75 has no primitive prime factor.

== Specific names ==

The Lucas sequences for some values of &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; have specific names:

: : Fibonacci numbers
: : Lucas numbers
: : Pell numbers
: : Pell–Lucas numbers (companion Pell numbers)
: : Jacobsthal numbers
: : Jacobsthal–Lucas numbers
: : Mersenne numbers 2&quot;n&quot; − 1
: : Numbers of the form 2&quot;n&quot; + 1, which include the Fermat numbers
: : The square roots of the square triangular numbers.
: : Fibonacci polynomials
: : Lucas polynomials
: : Chebyshev polynomials of second kind
: : Chebyshev polynomials of first kind multiplied by 2
: : Repunits in base &quot;x&quot;
: : &quot;xn&quot; + 1

Some Lucas sequences have entries in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences:

==Applications==
* Lucas sequences are used in probabilistic Lucas pseudoprime tests, which are part of the commonly used Baillie–PSW primality test.
* Lucas sequences are used in some primality proof methods, including the Lucas–Lehmer–Riesel test, and the N+1 and hybrid N−1/N+1 methods such as those in Brillhart-Lehmer-Selfridge 1975.
* LUC is a public-key cryptosystem based on Lucas sequences that implements the analogs of ElGamal (LUCELG), Diffie–Hellman (LUCDIF), and RSA (LUCRSA). The encryption of the message in LUC is computed as a term of certain Lucas sequence, instead of using modular exponentiation as in RSA or Diffie–Hellman. However, a paper by Bleichenbacher et al. shows that many of the supposed security advantages of LUC over cryptosystems based on modular exponentiation are either not present, or not as substantial as claimed.

== Software ==
Sagemath implements formula_75 and formula_73 as codice_1 and codice_2, respectively.

<text>This is a list of [[axiom]]s as that term is understood in mathematics. In epistemology, the word &quot;axiom&quot; is understood differently; see axiom and self-evidence. Individual axioms are almost always part of a larger axiomatic system.

==ZF (the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms without the axiom of choice)==
&quot;Together with the axiom of choice (see below), these are the&quot; de facto &quot;standard axioms for contemporary mathematics or set theory. They can be easily adapted to analogous theories, such as mereology.&quot;

* Axiom of extensionality
* Axiom of empty set
* Axiom of pairing
* Axiom of union
* Axiom of infinity
* Axiom schema of replacement
* Axiom of power set
* Axiom of regularity
* Axiom schema of specification

See also Zermelo set theory.

==Axiom of choice==
&quot;With the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms above, this makes up the system ZFC in which most mathematics is potentially formalisable.&quot;

===Equivalents of AC===
*Hausdorff maximality theorem
*Well-ordering theorem
*Zorn&#x27;s lemma

===Stronger than AC===
*Axiom of global choice

===Weaker than AC===
*Axiom of countable choice
*Axiom of dependent choice
*Boolean prime ideal theorem
*Axiom of uniformization

===Alternates incompatible with AC===
*Axiom of real determinacy

==Other axioms of mathematical logic==

*Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel axioms
*Continuum hypothesis and its generalization
*Freiling&#x27;s axiom of symmetry
*Axiom of determinacy
*Axiom of projective determinacy
*Martin&#x27;s axiom
*Axiom of constructibility
*Rank-into-rank
*Kripke–Platek axioms
*Diamond principle

==Geometry==

*Parallel postulate
*Birkhoff&#x27;s axioms (4 axioms)
*Hilbert&#x27;s axioms (20 axioms)
*Tarski&#x27;s axioms (10 axioms and 1 schema)

==Other axioms==

*Axiom of Archimedes (real number)
*Axiom of countability (topology)
*Dirac–von Neumann axioms
*Fundamental axiom of analysis (real analysis)
*Gluing axiom (sheaf theory)
*Haag–Kastler axioms (quantum field theory)
*Huzita&#x27;s axioms (origami)
*Kuratowski closure axioms (topology)
*Peano&#x27;s axioms (natural numbers)
*Probability axioms
*Separation axiom (topology)
*Wightman axioms (quantum field theory)

<doc id="734649" wikidata="Q368039" url="?curid=734649" title="Al Unser">
<text>Alfred Unser (May 29, 1939 – December 9, 2021) was an American automobile racing driver, the younger brother of fellow racing drivers Jerry and Bobby Unser, and father of Al Unser Jr. He was the second of four men (A. J. Foyt, himself, Rick Mears and Hélio Castroneves) to have won the Indianapolis 500 four times (1970, 1971, 1978, 1987), the fourth of six to have won the race in consecutive years, and the winner of the National Championship in 1970, 1983, and 1985. The Unser family has won the Indy 500 a record nine times. He was the only person to have both a sibling (Bobby) and child (Al Jr.) as fellow Indy 500 winners. Al&#x27;s nephews Johnny and Robby Unser have also competed in that race. In 1971, he became the only driver to date to win the race on his birthday (his 32nd).

After his son Al Unser Jr. joined the national championship circuit in 1983, Unser was generally known professionally by the retronym &quot;Al Unser Sr.&quot; He was also nicknamed &quot;Big Al&quot;, and Al Unser Jr. was likewise nicknamed &quot;Little Al&quot;.

==Personal life==

Unser was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the youngest of four sons of Mary Catherine (Craven) and Jerome Henry &quot;Jerry&quot; Unser. His father and two uncles, Louis and Joe, were also drivers. Beginning in 1926 they competed in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb, an annual road race held in Colorado. Joe Unser became the first member of the Unser family to lose his life to the sport, killed while test-driving an FWD Coleman Special on the Denver highway in 1929.

Al&#x27;s oldest brother Jerry became the first Unser to drive at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He qualifying 23rd and finishing 31st in the 1958 Indianapolis 500. However, tragedy struck the next year when he was killed by injuries sustained in a fiery crash during a practice session.

Middle brother Bobby drove in his first Indianapolis 500 in 1963. In 1968, he became the first family member to win. He went on to win the race a total of three times. Son Al Unser Jr. drove in his first Indy 500 in 1983, winning twice. His mother Mary &quot;Mom&quot; Unser became a popular a fixture at the track. Each year she treated the participants to a chili cookout in the garage area. She died on December 18, 1975.

Al Unser married Wanda Jesperson in 1958 and they had three children- Alfred Jr., Mary, and Deborah. Deborah was killed in a dune buggy accident in 1982. Al and Wanda divorced in 1971. Al married Karen Sue Barnes on November 22, 1977. Karen and Al divorced in 1988.

Al Unser, with his family, owned and operated the Unser Racing Museum in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

==Racing career and Indianapolis 500==

===USAC and Indycar===

He began racing in 1957, at age 18, initially competing primarily in modified roadsters, sprint cars and midgets. In 1965 he raced in the Indianapolis 500 for the first time and finished ninth. His breakout year in IndyCar&#x27;s was in 1970 when he joined Vel&#x27;s Parnelli Jones Racing, where he would drive for the next seven years.

He won the Indianapolis 500 in 1970, two years after his brother, Bobby. During the race, he led for all but ten of the 200 laps and averaged . His quick pit stops were a factor in the victory, as well as the fact that VPJ had an insurmountable advantage over the field that year. That season, he won a record ten times on oval, road and dirt tracks to capture the United States Auto Club national championship. Unser competed in USAC&#x27;s Stock Car division in 1967, and was the series Rookie of the Year.

In 1971, with Vel&#x27;s Parnelli Jones, he won the Indianapolis 500 again, starting from the fifth position with an average speed of , and holding off Peter Revson&#x27;s McLaren for the victory. Unser&#x27;s bid to become the first three-time consecutive Indy 500 champion was thwarted when he finished second to Mark Donohue in the 1972 Indianapolis 500. Unser would continue driving for the team up until 1977. During a few of those years, VPJ lost their competitive edge after changing their chassis, as well as their failed F1 bid. By 1977, the team regained competitive form, although Unser would announce his departure for Jim Hall Racing at year&#x27;s end. Unser would later say, in a 2020 interview, that his departure from VPJ stemmed from disagreements with Jones and his partners over the direction of the team, although Unser maintained a friendship with Jones.

Despite starting the 1978 Indianapolis 500 from the fifth position in a First National City Travelers Checks Chaparral Lola, Unser&#x27;s car was considered before the race to be a second-tier entry at best, if not an outright long shot to win. Moving to the front of the field for the first time on lap 75, he and opponent Danny Ongais engaged in an on-again off-again duel for 75 more laps, before an engine failure on Ongais&#x27; car on lap 150 allowed Unser to assume a commanding 35 second lead. Although suffering right front-wing misalignment due to impacting a tire on his final pit stop, a situation that led to the lead shrinking steadily over the race&#x27;s final 20 laps, it nevertheless proved wide enough for victory by nine seconds to spare at the checkered flag. Unser&#x27;s race average speed of ranked as the then-second fastest ever run (one mile per hour less than the then-1972 record), and would not itself be topped for second for four more years.

In 1979, Unser departed Jim Hall&#x27;s team for the Longhorn Racing Team owned by Bobby Hillin Sr.. Although Unser went winless for three seasons, he would later say that driving for the Hillin family was his most joyful experience as a driver before his successful Penske years. The team folded operations after three years, putting Unser out of a ride.

In the 1983 season, Unser joined Team Penske and drove for four years in a Penske-owned car. Unser controlled the late stages of the 1983 Indianapolis 500, leading 61 laps. With less than 20 laps to go, Unser got challenges from Tom Sneva who led the most laps. With help from his son - who was several laps down - Unser began pulling away from Sneva. However Sneva got by Al Jr., and set sail for Unser Sr.. Sneva caught up to Unser within one lap of passing Al Jr., and passed him to retake the lead with nine laps to go. Sneva then easily pulled away to win the race by 11 seconds, avenging his firing from the team in 1978. After the race, Unser Jr. was penalized two laps for his actions as well as having passed two cars under caution on lap 170.
Unser won the IndyCar championships in 1983 and 1985 by winning one race and then having several top-five finishes. In 1986, Penske decided to focus the team&#x27;s attention on teammate Rick Mears when he healed from serious injuries. As a result, Unser cut down his schedule to only a few IndyCar races a year, which he would do going forward.

===NASCAR and IROC===
Outside of his open-wheel career, Unser was a semi-regular competitor in IROC, winning three races and the 1977-1978 championship. His final IROC start was an 11th-place finish at the 1993 Michigan race after winning the pole.

Unser also started five races in NASCAR, three in the late 1960s and two in 1986. His best finishes were a pair of 4th-place results, one at the 1968 Daytona 500 and the other at the 1969 Motor Trend 500 at Riverside International Raceway. He fared less well in two 1986 starts, finishing 29th at Watkins Glen and 20th at Riverside.

==Fourth Indianapolis 500 victory==

In 1987, Penske&#x27;s slate of drivers included Rick Mears, Danny Sullivan, and Danny Ongais. Al Unser Sr. was dropped from the team, and entered the month of May without a ride. During the first week of practice, Al Sr. spent much of the week shopping for a ride, and a few offers were made by owners. Al Sr., however, refused the offers, as he insisted on landing a ride in a competitive, well-funded car only. Unser planned on staying through the week, and if he did not have a ride by the end of the first week of time trials, he was planning to return home. Coincidentally, his son Al Unser Jr. (driving for Shierson Racing) was having difficulty with his car&#x27;s handling. At the end of the first weekend of time trials, Al Jr. surprisingly had not yet qualified. Al Sr. agreed to stay through the week in order to help his son get his car up to speed.

Danny Ongais crashed into the wall during the first week of practice, suffering a serious concussion, and was declared unfit to drive. Meanwhile, the Penske team&#x27;s new Penske PC-16 chassis had been uncompetitive during practice. By the end of the first week of practice, Penske parked the PC-16s and elected to qualify back-up cars for the race. Mears and Sullivan were provided 1986 March-Ilmor Chevrolet machines, while a third car, a 1986 March-Cosworth, was planned for third driver.

Midway through the second week of practice, Roger Penske consummated a deal with Al Sr. to drive the third car. Penske promised Unser a well-funded effort, and a brand new Cosworth engine, the same chassis/engine combination that had won the previous four Indy 500s. The year-old March was removed from a Penske Racing display at a Sheraton hotel in the team&#x27;s hometown of Reading, Pennsylvania, and hurriedly prepared for a return to active competition. Unser easily put the car in the field on the third day of time trials.

At the start Unser was in the 20th position. On a day when heavy attrition felled most of the field&#x27;s front-runners, including the overwhelmingly dominant Newman-Haas entry of Mario Andretti, Unser worked his way steadily forward and took the lead on the 183rd lap, after Roberto Guerrero&#x27;s car stalled on his final pit stop. Averaging , Unser bested a charging Guerrero by 4.5 seconds to win his fourth Indy 500, only five days before his 48th birthday. In doing so he tied Foyt as the winningest Indy 500 driver and broke brother Bobby&#x27;s record as the oldest Indy winner.

Unser rode the wave of his fourth Indy victory to secure a ride at Penske for the Michigan 500, Pocono 500, and Marlboro Challenge for 1987. Near the end of the year, Unser had two other starts. He drove as a substitute for Roberto Guerrero at Nazareth, and had a competitive run until crashing a few laps short of the finish. He was then hired to drive the brand new Porsche Indy car at Laguna Seca. The team was still in its infancy, and the car dropped out. Unser left the team after only one race.

In 1988 and 1989, Unser returned to Penske to secure a ride at the three 500-miles races (Indianapolis, Michigan, Pocono). Unser appeared headed for a third Pocono 500 victory during the 1988 Pocono 500 until he suffered ignition failure while leading with 28 laps remaining. Unser had led a race-high 79 laps.

==Retirement==
After reorganization at Team Penske in 1990, Unser was finally crowded out of his part-time ride. With competitive rides filling up, and his career winding down, he joined the sub-par Patrick Racing Alfa Romeo team for 1990. After finishing 13th at Indy, Unser returned to the team for the Michigan 500. A broken right-front push-rod after only six practice laps led to a severe crash. The 51 year-old Unser suffered a broken right femur, right collarbone, and three upper right ribs. He quit the team after the crash.

He spent most of the month of May 1991 shopping around for a competitive ride. The restrictions on the number of leases to the Chevy Ilmor engine kept him out of a ride during the first week of practice. A last-minute deal with the UNO/Granatelli team (where he would be Arie Luyendyk&#x27;s teammate) fell through when there was not enough time to prepare the car. Instead of jumping into another car &quot;just to make the show,&quot; Unser sat out the 1991 race and watched from the sidelines for the first time since 1969.

In 1992, Unser entered the month of May for the second year in a row without a ride. During the first week of practice, Nelson Piquet was involved in a serious crash, and was unable to drive. Unser was hired by Team Menard to fill the position vacated by Piquet. Unser drove to a 3rd-place finish, while his son Al Unser Jr. won the race. It was Team Menard&#x27;s best Indy 500 finish, the best finish for the Buick Indy engine, and the first time the Buick engine had gone the entire . Later in the year, Unser was selected to drive as a substitute for the injured Rick Mears at Nazareth. It was Unser&#x27;s first start for Penske since 1989, and his final start in a CART series event. He finished 12th, earning 1 championship point.

In 1993, driving for King Racing, he led 15 laps at the Indianapolis 500 to extend his career laps-led record. He finished 12th, one lap down.

A month shy of his 55th birthday, Unser entered the 1994 race with Arizona Motorsports, hoping to qualify for what would be his 28th Indy 500. The team was very underfunded, and Unser had considerable trouble getting the car up to speed. On the first weekend of qualifying, he waved off after a poor qualifying lap. After some minimal practice the following day, he quit the team. He announced his retirement on May 17, 1994. His son Al Unser Jr. won the Indianapolis 500 on his father&#x27;s 55th birthday.

===Health and death===
Unser suffered from hereditary haemochromatosis, which contributed to him being diagnosed with liver cancer in 2004 and having a tumor and half of his liver removed in 2005. Unser continued to suffer from cancer for the next 17 years before dying from the disease aged 82 on December 9, 2021, in his home in Chama, New Mexico.

Unser has led the second most laps of any driver in the history of the Indianapolis 500, at 644. Unser tied Ralph DePalma&#x27;s long standing record of 612 laps led on the last lap of his 4th victory.

Unser holds the record of being the oldest driver to ever win the 500 at 47 years old (1987), breaking the previous record set by his brother Bobby.

Unser won two 500-mile races at Pocono (in 1976 and 1978) and two more at Ontario (in 1977 and 1978) bringing his total of 500-mile race wins (including four Indianapolis 500s) to eight.

Unser was the 1978 IROC champion. He also competed in the 1968 Daytona 500 and four other NASCAR Winston Cup &amp; Grand National races, all held on road courses with a best finish of fourth (twice).

<text>BBC North West Tonight (known as BBC North West Today during daytime) is the BBC&#x27;s regional television news programme covering North West England and the Isle of Man. Produced by BBC North West, the programme broadcasts from the BBC&#x27;s MediaCityUK studios at Salford Quays, with district newsrooms based in Liverpool, Blackburn and Chester.

==BBC North West region==
The BBC North West region covers Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Merseyside, northwestern Derbyshire, northern Staffordshire, southern Cumbria, western North Yorkshire, and the Isle of Man.

The programme can be watched in any part of the United Kingdom (and Europe) from Astra 1N on Freesat channel 955 and Sky channel 958. The latest edition of &quot;BBC North West Tonight&quot; is also available to watch on BBC iPlayer for 24 hours, like the BBC&#x27;s other television news bulletins.

Most of Cumbria is served by &quot;Look North&quot; that broadcast Newcastle. Southern parts of the county such as Barrow-in-Furness and South Lakeland are still served by &quot;North West Tonight&quot;. Western North Yorkshire (Settle), northern Staffordshire (Biddulph and Kidsgrove) and northwest of Derbyshire (Buxton, Glossop, New Miils and Chapel-en-le-Frith) get their signals from the Winter Hill TV transmitter that broadcast &quot;North West Tonight&quot; rather than the neighbouring regions of &quot;Look North&quot;, &quot;Midlands Today&quot; and &quot;East Midlands Today&quot;.

==History==
BBC television news from Manchester began on 30 September 1957, with a nightly bulletin entitled &quot;News from the North&quot;, broadcast to the whole of Northern England from the Holme Moss and Pontop Pike transmitters.

The rival ITV station, Granada Television, had already begun providing regional news coverage when it began broadcasting in May 1956, at first covering the North West only before extending to Yorkshire six months later.

For the first two years, the short weeknight bulletins were produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Dickenson Road television studio at Rusholme in south Manchester.

The TV news service was refocused to cover the North West and Yorkshire areas, when separate bulletins for the North East and Cumbria were introduced in 1959.

At this point, production moved to a small studio at Broadcasting House, situated above a bank at Piccadilly Gardens and shared with the BBC&#x27;s radio and newsgathering facilities in Manchester.

By 1962, the nightly bulletins had been extended to 20 minutes and evolved into the magazine programme &quot;North at Six&quot;, later renamed as &quot;Look North&quot;.

On 25 March 1968, the Manchester edition of &quot;Look North&quot; was again refocused to cover the North West area, following the launch of a third &quot;Look North&quot; programme from Leeds. The programme was renamed in 1980 as &quot;Look North West&quot;, with &quot;News North West&quot; introduced for shorter bulletins.

On 18 May 1981, &quot;Look North West&quot; moved from Piccadilly Gardens to New Broadcasting House on nearby Oxford Road. &quot;BBC North West Tonight&quot; was introduced on 3 September 1984 to coincide with the launch of the &quot;BBC Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot;.

Between 1986 and 1989, the programme also covered parts of Cumbria previously served by the Newcastle edition of &quot;Look North&quot; and provided a news opt-out for the area at lunchtime. Later, Cumbrian news coverage was switched back to the Newcastle edition of &quot;Look North&quot;.

The last edition of the programme from Studio B at New Broadcasting House on Oxford Road aired on 27 November 2011 and was also the last broadcast from the studios after 36 years of operation. The programme&#x27;s first broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Salford Quays studios took place the following day, during the BBC Breakfast programme. &quot;BBC North West Tonight&quot; and &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; shared the same studio until 2023.

==Broadcast times==

===&quot;BBC North West Today&quot;===
On weekdays, breakfast bulletins air as part of &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; at 25 and 55 minutes past the hour, between 6:25am and 9:00am. A 10-minute lunchtime bulletin airs at around 1:35pm, within the &quot;BBC News at One&quot; (which, since extending its airtime to 60 minutes in 2024, also presents from MediaCityUK).

===&quot;BBC North West Tonight&quot;===
The main edition of &quot;BBC North West Tonight&quot; is broadcast every weeknight between 6.30pm and 7.00pm. A late-night 15-minute edition of the programme is broadcast Monday to Friday at 10.30pm, following the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot;.

<text>Iconic memory is the visual sensory memory register pertaining to the visual domain and a fast-decaying store of visual information. It is a component of the visual memory system which also includes visual short-term memory (VSTM) and long-term memory (LTM). Iconic memory is described as a very brief (&lt;1 second), pre-categorical, high capacity memory store. It contributes to VSTM by providing a coherent representation of our entire visual perception for a very brief period of time. Iconic memory assists in accounting for phenomena such as change blindness and continuity of experience during saccades. Iconic memory is no longer thought of as a single entity but instead, is composed of at least two distinctive components. Classic experiments including Sperling&#x27;s partial report paradigm as well as modern techniques continue to provide insight into the nature of this SM store.

== Overview ==

The occurrence of a sustained physiological image of an object after its physical offset has been observed by many individuals throughout history. One of the earliest documented accounts of the phenomenon was by Aristotle who proposed that afterimages were involved in the experience of a dream. Natural observation of the light trail produced by glowing ember at the end of a quickly moving stick sparked the interest of researchers in the 1700s and 1800s. They became the first to begin empirical studies on this phenomenon which later became known as visible persistence. In the 1900s, the role of visible persistence in memory gained considerable attention due to its hypothesized role as a pre-categorical representation of visual information in visual short-term memory (VSTM). In 1960, George Sperling began his classic partial-report experiments to confirm the existence of visual sensory memory and some of its characteristics including capacity and duration. It was not until 1967 that Ulric Neisser termed this quickly decaying memory store &quot;iconic memory&quot;. Approximately 20 years after Sperling&#x27;s original experiments, two separate components of visual sensory memory began to emerge: visual persistence and informational persistence. Sperling&#x27;s experiments mainly tested the information pertaining to a stimulus, whereas others such as Coltheart performed directs tests of visual persistence. In 1978, Di Lollo proposed a two-state model of visual sensory memory. Although it has been debated throughout history, current understanding of iconic memory makes a clear distinction between visual and informational persistence which are tested differently and have fundamentally different properties. Informational persistence which is the basis behind iconic memory is thought to be the key contributor to visual short-term memory as the precategorical sensory store.
A similar storage area serves as a temporary warehouse for sounds.

== Components ==
The two main components of iconic memory are &quot;visible persistence&quot; and &quot;informational persistence&quot;. The first is a relatively brief (150 ms) pre-categorical visual representation of the physical image created by the sensory system. This would be the &quot;snapshot&quot; of what the individual is looking at and perceiving. The second component is a longer-lasting memory store which represents a coded version of the visual image into post-categorical information. This would be the &quot;raw data&quot; that is taken in and processed by the brain. A third component may also be considered which is &quot;neural persistence&quot;: the physical activity and recordings of the visual system. Neural persistence is generally represented by neuroscientific techniques such as EEG and fMRI.

===Visible persistence===
Visible persistence is the phenomenal impression that a visual image remains present after its physical offset. This can be considered a by-product of neural persistence. Visible persistence is more sensitive to the physical parameters of the stimulus than informational persistence which is reflected in its two key properties.: 
#The duration of visible persistence is inversely related to stimulus duration. This means that the longer the physical stimulus is presented for, the faster the visual image decays in memory.
#The duration of visible persistence is inversely related to stimulus luminance. When the luminance, or brightness of a stimulus is increased, the duration of visible persistence decreases. Due to the involvement of the neural system, visible persistence is highly dependent on the physiology of the photoreceptors and activation of different cell types in the visual cortex. This visible representation is subject to masking effects whereby the presentation of interfering stimulus during, or immediately after stimulus offset interferes with one&#x27;s ability to remember the stimulus.
Different techniques have been used to attempt to identify the duration of visible persistence. The Duration of Stimulus Technique is one in which a probe stimulus (auditory &quot;click&quot;) is presented simultaneously with the onset, and on a separate trial, with the offset of a visual display. The difference represents the duration of the visible store which was found to be approximately 100-200 ms. Alternatively, the Phenomenal Continuity and Moving Slit Technique estimated visible persistence to be 300 ms. In the first paradigm, an image is presented discontinuously with blank periods in between presentations. If the duration is short enough, the participant will perceive a continuous image. Similarly, the Moving Slit Technique is also based on the participant observing a continuous image. Only instead of flashing the entire stimulus on and off, only a very narrow portion or &quot;slit&quot; of the image is displayed. When the slit is oscillated at the correct speed, a complete image is viewed.

====Neural basis====
Underlying visible persistence is neural persistence of the visual sensory pathway. A prolonged visual representation begins with activation of photoreceptors in the retina. Although activation in both rods and cones has been found to persist beyond the physical offset of a stimulus, the rod system persists longer than cones. Other cells involved in a sustained visible image include M and P retinal ganglion cells. M cells (transient cells), are active only during stimulus onset and stimulus offset. P cells (sustained cells), show continuous activity during stimulus onset, duration, and offset. Cortical persistence of the visual image has been found in the primary visual cortex (V1) in the occipital lobe which is responsible for processing visual information.

===Informational persistence===
Information persistence represents the &quot;information&quot; about a stimulus that persists after its physical offset. It is &quot;&quot; in nature, but not &quot;.&quot; Sperling&#x27;s experiments were a test of informational persistence. Stimulus duration is the key contributing factor to the duration of informational persistence. As stimulus duration increases, so does the duration of the visual code. The non-visual components represented by informational persistence include the abstract characteristics of the image, as well as its spatial location. Due to the nature of informational persistence, unlike visible persistence, it is immune to masking effects. The characteristics of this component of iconic memory suggest that it plays the key role in representing a post-categorical memory store for which VSTM can access information for consolidation. 

====Neural basis====
Although less research exists regarding the neural representation of informational persistence compared to visible persistence, new electrophysiological techniques have begun to reveal cortical areas involved. Unlike visible persistence, informational persistence is thought to rely on higher-level visual areas beyond the visual cortex. The anterior superior temporal sulcus (STS), a part of the ventral stream, was found to be active in macaques during iconic memory tasks. This brain region is associated with object recognition and object identity. Iconic memory&#x27;s role in change detection has been related to activation in the middle occipital gyrus (MOG). MOG activation was found to persist for approximately 2000ms suggesting a possibility that iconic memory has a longer duration than what was currently thought. Iconic memory is also influenced by genetics and proteins produced in the brain. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a part of the neurotrophin family of nerve growth factors. Individuals with mutations to the BDNF gene which codes for BDNF have been shown to have shortened, less stable informational persistence.

== Role ==
Iconic memory provides a smooth stream of visual information to the brain which can be extracted over an extended period of time by VSTM for consolidation into more stable forms. One of iconic memory&#x27;s key roles is involved with change detection of our visual environment which assists in the perception of motion.

===Temporal integration===
Iconic memory enables integrating visual information along a continuous stream of images, for example when watching a movie. In the primary visual cortex new stimuli do not erase information about previous stimuli. Instead the responses to the most recent stimulus contain about equal amounts of information about both this and the preceding stimulus. This one-back memory may be the main substrate for both the integration processes in iconic memory and masking effects. The particular outcome depends on whether the two subsequent component images (i.e., the &quot;icons&quot;) are meaningful only when isolated (masking) or only when superimposed (integration).

===Change blindness===
The brief representation in iconic memory is thought to play a key role in the ability to detect change in a visual scene. The phenomenon of change blindness has provided insight into the nature of the iconic memory store and its role in vision. Change blindness refers to an inability to detect differences in two successive scenes separated by a very brief blank interval, or interstimulus interval (ISI). As such change blindness can be defined as being a slight lapse in iconic memory. When scenes are presented without an ISI, the change is easily detectable. It is thought that the detailed memory store of the scene in iconic memory is erased by each ISI, which renders the memory inaccessible. This reduces the ability to make comparisons between successive scenes.

=== Saccadic eye movement ===
It has been suggested that iconic memory plays a role in providing continuity of experience during saccadic eye movements. These rapid eye movements occur in approximately 30 ms and each fixation lasts for approximately 300 ms. Research suggests however, that memory for information between saccades is largely dependent on VSTM and not iconic memory. Instead of contributing to trans-saccadic memory, information stored in iconic memory is thought to actually be erased during saccades. A similar phenomenon occurs during eye-blinks whereby both automatic and intentional blinking disrupts the information stored in iconic memory.

== Development ==
The development of iconic memory begins at birth and continues as development of the primary and secondary visual system occurs. By 6 months of age, infants&#x27; iconic memory capacity approaches adults&#x27;. By 5 years of age, children have developed the same unlimited capacity of iconic memory that adults possess. The duration of informational persistence however increases from approximately 200 ms at age 5, to an asymptotic level of 1000 ms as an adult (&gt;11 years). A small decrease in visual persistence occurs with age. A decrease of approximately 20 ms has been observed when comparing individuals in their early 20s to those in their late 60s. Throughout one&#x27;s lifetime, mild cognitive impairments (MCIs) may develop such as errors in episodic memory (autobiographical memory about people, places, and their contex), and working memory (the active processing component of STM) due to damage in hippocampal and association cortical areas. Episodic memories are autobiographical events that a person can discuss. Individuals with MCIs have been found to show decreased iconic memory capacity and duration. Iconic memory impairment in those with MCIs may be used as a predictor for the development of more severe deficits such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and dementia later in life. Previous studies have shown that glucocorticoids have been closely linked to impact higher cognitive functioning. Glucocorticoid exposure causes severe memory retrieval impairment, explicitly advancing iconic memory decay. It reduces the active maintenance and storage of sensory information by altering transient neural responses during the initial stimulus processing stages. Elevated cortisol levels have also been associated with faster iconic memory decay and top-down processing impairment, putting individuals at a higher risk of developing Dementia and AD. 

Iconic memory formation has been previously described as attention-free and fleeting, however newer studies have shown that in fact it does require attention. IM is shown to decay at a faster rate if attention focus is not appropriately met to the attention load. This allows for the information that is being transported into working memory to be retained more precisely. Iconic memory decay has been found to occur at a rapid speed after the visual stimulus is no longer present. Without active retrieval, iconic memory averages to disappear within half a second. The theory of gradual decay in visual working memory claims that the accuracy at which the stimulus is remembered in iconic memory deteriorates over time. However, information stored in sensory memory is considered to facilitate exponential decay. 

== Sperling&#x27;s partial report procedure ==
In 1960, George Sperling became the first to use a partial report paradigm to investigate the bipartite model of VSTM. In Sperling&#x27;s initial experiments in 1960, observers were presented with a tachistoscopic visual stimulus for a brief period of time (50 ms) consisting of either a 3x3 or 3x4 array of alphanumeric characters such as: 
:P Y F G
:V J S A
:D H B U

Recall was based on a cue which followed the offset of the stimulus and directed the subject to recall a specific line of letters from the initial display. Memory performance was compared under two conditions: whole report and partial report.

=== Whole report ===

The whole report condition required participants to recall as many elements from the original display in their proper spatial locations as possible. Participants were typically able to recall three to five characters from the twelve character display (~35%). This suggests that whole report is limited by a memory system with a capacity of four-to-five items.

=== Partial report ===
The partial report condition required participants to identify a subset of the characters from the visual display using cued recall. The cue was a tone which sounded at various time intervals (~50 ms) following the offset of the stimulus. The frequency of the tone (high, medium, or low) indicated which set of characters within the display were to be reported. Due to the fact that participants did not know which row would be cued for recall, performance in the partial report condition can be regarded as a random sample of an observer&#x27;s memory for the entire display. This type of sampling revealed that immediately after stimulus offset, participants could recall a given row (from a 3x3 grid of 9 letters) on 75% of trials, suggesting that 75% of the entire visual display (75% of 9-letters) was accessible to memory. This is a dramatic increase in the hypothesized capacity of iconic memory derived from full-report trials.

== Variations of the partial report procedure ==
=== Visual bar cue ===
A small variation in Sperling&#x27;s partial report procedure which yielded similar results was the use of a visual bar marker instead of an auditory tone as the retrieval cue. In this modification, participants were presented with a visual display of 2 rows of 8 letters for 50 ms. The probe was a visual bar placed above or below a letter&#x27;s position simultaneously with array offset. Participants had an average accuracy of 65% when asked to recall the designated letter.

=== Temporal variations ===
Varying the time between the offset of the display and the auditory cue allowed Sperling to estimate the time course of sensory memory. Sperling deviated from the original procedure by varying tone presentation from immediately after stimulus offset, to 150, 500, or 1000 ms. Using this technique, the initial memory for a stimulus display was found to decay rapidly after display offset. At approximately 1000 ms after stimulus offset, there was no difference in recall between the partial-report and whole report conditions. Overall, experiments using partial report provided evidence for a rapidly decaying sensory trace lasting approximately 1000 ms after the offset of a display

==== Circle cue and masking ====
The effects of masking were identified by the use of a circle presented around a letter as the cue for recall. When the circle was presented before the visual stimulus onset or simultaneously with stimulus offset, recall matched that found when using a bar or tone. However, if a circle was used as a cue 100 ms &quot;after&quot; stimulus offset, there was decreased accuracy in recall. As the delay of circle presentation increased, accuracy once again improved. This phenomenon was an example of metacontrast masking. Masking was also observed when images such as random lines were presented immediately after stimulus offset.

<doc id="734679" wikidata="Q382603" url="?curid=734679" title="Uhlan">
<text>Uhlan (; ; ; ; ) is a type of light cavalry, primarily armed with a lance. The uhlans started as Lithuanian irregular cavalry, that were later also adopted by other countries during the 18th century, including Poland, France, Russia, Prussia, Saxony, and Austria. The term &quot;lancer&quot; was often used interchangeably with &quot;uhlan&quot;; the lancer regiments later formed for the British Army were directly inspired by the uhlans of other armies (even though they were never known by that name). 

Uhlans traditionally wore a double-breasted short-tailed jacket with a coloured &quot;plastron&quot; panel at the front, a coloured sash, and a square-topped Polish lancer cap (, also called ). This cap or cavalry helmet was derived from a traditional Polish cap design, formalised and stylised for military use. Their lances were traditionally topped with a small, swallow-tailed flag (&quot;pennon&quot;) just below the spearhead.

==Etymology==
There are several suggested etymologies for the word &quot;uhlan&quot;. In the Turkic languages, &quot;oğlan&quot; means &#x27;young man&#x27; or &#x27;boy&#x27;. It is probable that this entered Polish via Tatar and was styled as &quot;ułan&quot;. The Polish spelling was then adopted by German, French, and other European languages.

==History==
===Origins===
In the late 14th century, Golden Horde Tatar (sometimes spelled &quot;Tartar&quot;) families settled in Lithuania and so were required to serve the Grand Duke of Lithuania militarily and later the Polish king. The Poles started incorporating much of their military vocabulary and traditions, along with their strategy and tactics. Lithuanian Tatars served as part of the Royal armies during various battles of the late Middle Ages. Their tasks were to conduct reconnaissance in advance of the heavier cavalry banners (knights). With the end of armoured knights during the 16th century, the Lithuanian Tatars were organized in light (Tatar) banners – armed with a light lance, bow, sabre, and, on occasion, a battle axe or horseman&#x27;s pick, serving as companions () and retainers () – while equally lightly armed hussars were converted into heavy companies of winged hussars. Tatar companions serving within their own Tatar companies (banners) lasted until the 1770s, when major cavalry reforms were carried out within the Polish–Lithuanian army and were included in the reformed cavalry regiments. The last Polish king, Stanisław August Poniatowski, had an uhlan guard regiment simply known as the Royal Uhlans. It was disbanded in 1794 or 1795.

Uhlans frequently adopted the practice of the original Lithuanian lancers of attaching pennons to lances to look more awe-inspiring.
===18th century===
Uhlan units started emerging in Western European armies during the War of Austrian Succession, starting with an uhlan squadron, known as the , formed by Frederick the Great in 1740. The next year, the squadron was expanded to an uhlan regiment, finally being transformed into Natzmer&#x27;s 4th Hussar Regiment in 1742.

Simultaneously, in 1743, Maurice de Saxe formed a mixed uhlan-dragoon regiment, the Volontaires de Saxe, for Louis XV&#x27;s French Royal Army. It was composed of six companies, each of eighty dragoons and eighty uhlans, and included Lithuanian, Polish and Tatar soldiers. The regiment was known for its bravery, fighting spirit, and alcoholism.

The first uhlan regiments were created in the early 18th century, during the 1720s, in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

As developments in battlefield tactics and firearms had combined with the increasing sizes of early modern armies to make heavy armour obsolescent (though retained by the cuirassier regiments), lighter units became the core of the cavalry, distinguished only by the sizes of their men and mounts and by the tasks that they performed (&quot;i.e.&quot;, reconnaissance, skirmishing, or direct charges).

During the period preceding the Partitions of Poland, uhlan formations consisting of Poles or Lithuanian Tatars were created in most surrounding states simply because the Polish Crown did not have the resources or political will to maintain a numerous army. Speed and mobility were the keys to the effectiveness of light cavalry armed with lances.

King Stanisław August Poniatowski of Poland formed a regiment of royal guards equipped with lances, szablas, and pistols, each guardsman uniformed in and . This unit became the prototype for many other units of the Polish cavalry, who started to arm themselves with equipment modelled after uhlan regiments and medieval Tatars.

In the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the uhlans inherited the status and traditions of the winged Polish hussars in 1776, thus becoming National cavalry. The Austrian empire also formed an &quot;Uhlan Regiment&quot; in 1784, composed primarily of Poles. Uhlan regiments recruited from Austrian cavalrymen were raised in 1791.

===19th century===
During the Napoleonic Wars, the Duchy of Warsaw raised uhlan formations. Polish lancers serving with the French Army included the Legion of the Vistula and the 1st Polish Light Cavalry Regiment of the Imperial Guard. The Imperial Guard lancers were armed with lances, sabres and pistols. The lancers of the Polish expeditionary corps, which fought alongside the French in Spain and Germany, spread the popularity of the Polish model of light cavalry. After the Battle of Somosierra, Napoleon said that one Polish cavalryman was worth ten French soldiers. The chevaux-légers, French light cavalry units from the 16th century till 1815, were remodelled after the uhlans. Following the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807, lancer regiments designated as uhlans were reintroduced in the Prussian service. Initially, they were only three. After the War of the Sixth Coalition, uhlan regiments were formed from Lützow Free Corps, Schill Free Corps, Bremen Volunteers and Hellwig&#x27;s Streifkorps.

During and after the Napoleonic Wars, cavalry regiments armed with lances were formed in many states throughout Europe, including the armies of Italy, Spain, Portugal, Sweden and Russia. While cavalry carrying this weapon was usually specifically designated as lancers or uhlans, in some instances, the front rank troopers of hussar or dragoon regiments were also armed with lances.

In one notable action during the Waterloo Campaign as the French lancers advanced out of a defile — created by the bridge over the Dyle and the village of Genappe — although they were stationary as they formed up, they lowered their lances to receive a charge by the sabre wielding British 7th Hussars (light cavalry) who were then unable to press home their charge. However, once the lancers advanced in slight disorder (up the valley slope of the Dyle), they were overridden by the British 1st Life Guards (heavy cavalry armed with sabres) who drove them back through Genappe and onto the bridge.

During the Battle of Albuera, the 1st Vistulan Lancers Regiment in French service virtually annihilated three of four of the British infantry regiments comprising Colborne&#x27;s 1st Brigade. In 1816, the British Army established its own lancer regiments, converting four light dragoon regiments for the purpose and practically adopting the whole uniform of Napoleon&#x27;s famous Polish Lancers, including the czapska.The traditions of the Polish uhlans were preserved during the Kingdom of Poland. They fought both in the November uprising of 1830 and in the January uprising of 1863. Uhlans were deployed in the Franco-Prussian War by the Prussian Army in a variety of traditional light cavalry roles. During the siege of Paris, uhlans were tasked with shadowing passenger balloons launched from the city: their capacity for rapid movement made uhlans the only troops able to keep pace with the balloons, either to seize them on landing or at least report trajectory and destination.

===World War I===
At the start of the First World War, many European armies had lance-armed cavalry regiments. Belgium had five lancer regiments. Italy possessed 10 lancer regiments. The British army had six lancer regiments, with an additional 15 in the British Indian Army.

====German uhlans====

In 1914, the Imperial German Army included 26 uhlan regiments, three of which were Guard regiments, 21 line (16 Prussian, two Württemberg and three Saxon) and two from the autonomous Royal Bavarian Army. All German uhlan regiments wore Polish style czapkas and tunics with plastron fronts, both in coloured parade uniforms and the field grey service dress introduced in 1910. Because German hussar, dragoon and cuirassier regiments also carried lances in 1914, there was a tendency among their French and British opponents to describe all German cavalry as &quot;uhlans&quot;.

The lance carried by the uhlans (and after 1889 the entire German cavalry branch) was known as the Stahlrohrlanze which consisted of a long tube made of rolled steel-plate, weighing . The lance carried below its head a small pennant in different colours according to the province or state from which the regiment was recruited. The quadrangular spear point was long and made of tempered steel. The butt end of the shaft was also pointed so that (in theory) the lance could be wielded as a double-ended weapon.

After seeing mounted action during the first few weeks of World War I, the uhlan regiments were either dismounted to serve as &quot;cavalry rifles&quot; in the trenches of the Western Front or they were transferred to the Eastern Front where the more primitive battle conditions made it possible for horse cavalry to fulfill their intended role. All 26 German uhlan regiments were disbanded in 1918–1919.

====Austrian uhlans====
There were 11 regiments of uhlans (spelt &quot;Ulan&quot;) in the Austro-Hungarian cavalry, largely recruited in the Polish-speaking parts of the Empire. They wore czapkas in regimental colours but otherwise were, after 1867, dressed in the light blue tunics and red breeches of the Austro-Hungarian dragoons, without Polish features. Their lances were similar in design to those of the German cavalry but had wooden shafts (of ash). In 1884 the lance was replaced by the sabre in the Austro-Hungarian cavalry, although the regiments retained their traditional titles and lancer caps until World War I.
As with other armies, the Austro-Hungarian uhlans were forced into a largely dismounted role by the realities of trench warfare by the end of 1914. Consequently, the blue and red peacetime uniforms were replaced by field grey during 1915. There was, however, one last opportunity for traditional glory when on 21 August 1914, the uhlans and dragoons of the Austro-Hungarian clashed with their counterparts of the Imperial Russian 10th Cavalry Division in classic cavalry style at the Battle of Jaroslavice.

====Polish uhlans====
Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s Polish Legions (an independent formation serving with the Austro-Hungarian Army) had a small uhlan detachment. Commanded by Władysław Belina-Prażmowski, they were modelled after the uhlans of the Napoleonic period. This unit was the first element of the Central Powers to enter Polish lands during World War I. After Poland&#x27;s independence in 1918, all parts of the country raised uhlan formations. They fought with distinction in the Greater Poland Uprising, the Polish-Ukrainian War and the Polish-Bolshevik War. Although equipped with modern horse-drawn artillery and trained in infantry tactics, the uhlan formations kept their sabres, their lances and their ability to charge the enemy. Among other battles, the uhlan units took part in the Battle of Komarów of 1920 against the invading Soviet Konarmia, the last pure cavalry battle in history.

====Russian uhlans====

The Imperial Russian Army had converted its 17 line uhlan regiments to dragoons in 1881 as part of the general modernization of the Russian cavalry. Only the two Russian Imperial Guard uhlan regiments retained their special distinctions. In 1910, however, the historic line regiments of uhlans had their lances, traditional titles, and distinctive ceremonial uniforms returned to them. From 1910 to 1918, the designation of &quot;uhlan&quot; had, however, become simply a historical distinction in the Russian cavalry (many of whom carried lances), without tactical significance.

===Interwar===
In the period between the World Wars, the Polish cavalry was reformed, with some units retaining their uhlan traditions. However, in contrast with its traditional role, the cavalry was no longer seen as a unit capable of breaking through enemy lines. Instead, it was used as a mobile reserve and employed infantry tactics: the soldiers dismounted before the battle and fought as infantry (dragoon), yet retained the high mobility of cavalry. Thus, technically speaking, in 1939, Poland had 11 brigades of mounted infantry and no cavalry units.

As noted above, the uhlans of the Imperial German Army were disbanded at the end of World War I. However, lances continued to be carried by certain cavalry regiments of the new German Army () permitted by the Treaty of Versailles. As late as 1925, Major General von Seeckt, Commander of the Reichsheer, rejected a General Staff proposal that lances be abandoned as unsuited for a modern army.

===World War II===
While the Polish cavalrymen retained their sabres, the lance was no longer a standard issue after 1934 (or 1937). However, the lance was retained only for training purposes and flying squadron pennants. Instead, the cavalry units were equipped with 75mm field guns, light tanks, 37mm anti-tank guns, 40mm anti-aircraft guns, as well as anti-tank rifles and other modern weapons. Although there were cavalry charges during World War II, very few were successful.

A popular myth is that Polish cavalry armed with lances charged (and were annihilated by) German tanks during the September 1939 campaign. This arose from the misreporting (both intentional and unintentional) of the Charge at Krojanty on 1 September, when the 18th Pomeranian Uhlan Regiment&#x27;s two squadrons armed with sabres, scattered German infantry before being caught in the open by German armoured cars.

When the remnants of the Polish cavalry forces were reconstituted in exile in 1943 as the 1st Armoured Division the 24th Uhlans (24 Pułk Ułanów) were equipped as an armoured regiment with Sherman tanks. The regiment was disbanded in 1947.

<text>The Sistine Chapel ceiling (), painted in fresco by Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512, is a cornerstone work of High Renaissance art.

The Sistine Chapel is the large papal chapel built within the Vatican between 1477 and 1480 by Pope Sixtus IV, for whom the chapel is named. The ceiling was painted at the commission of Pope Julius II.

The ceiling&#x27;s various painted elements form part of a larger scheme of decoration within the chapel. Prior to Michelangelo&#x27;s contribution, the walls were painted by several leading artists of the late 15th century including Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, and Pietro Perugino. After the ceiling was painted, Raphael created a set of large tapestries (1515–1516) to cover the lower portion of the wall. Michelangelo returned to the chapel to create &quot;The Last Judgment&quot;, a large wall fresco situated behind the altar. The chapel&#x27;s decoration illustrates much of the doctrine of the Catholic Church, serving as the location for papal conclaves and many other important services.

Central to the ceiling decoration are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis, including &quot;The Creation of Adam&quot;. The complex design includes several sets of figures, some clothed and some nude, allowing Michelangelo to demonstrate his skill in depicting the human figure in a variety of poses. The ceiling was immediately well-received and imitated by other artists, continuing to the present. It has been restored several times, most recently from 1980 to 1994.

== Context and creation ==

The walls of the Sistine Chapel had been decorated 20 years before Michelangelo&#x27;s work on the ceiling. Following this, Raphael designed a set of tapestries (1515–1516) to cover the lowest of three levels; the surviving tapestries are still hung on special occasions. The middle level contains a complex scheme of frescoes illustrating the &quot;Life of Christ&quot; on the right side and the &quot;Life of Moses&quot; on the left side. It was carried out by some of the most renowned Renaissance painters: Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Pietro Perugino, Pinturicchio, Luca Signorelli, and Cosimo Rosselli. The upper level of the walls contains the windows, between which are painted pairs of illusionistic niches with representations of the first 32 popes.

The original ceiling painting was by Pier Matteo d&#x27;Amelia, and had depicted stars over a blue background like the ceiling of the Arena Chapel decorated by Giotto at Padua. For six months in 1504, a diagonal crack in the chapel&#x27;s vault had made the chapel unusable, and Pope Julius II (Giuliano della Rovere) had the damaged painting removed by Piero Roselli, a friend of Michelangelo.
Julius II was a &quot;warrior pope&quot; who in his papacy undertook an aggressive campaign for political control to unite and empower Italy under the leadership of the Catholic Church. He invested in symbolism to display his temporal power, such as his procession, in which he (in the Classical manner) rode a chariot through a triumphal arch after one of his many military victories. Julius II&#x27;s project to rebuild St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica would distinguish it as the most potent symbol of the source of papal power; he ultimately demolished and replaced the original basilica with a grander one intended to house his own tomb. The pope summoned Michelangelo to Rome in early 1505 and commissioned him to design his tomb, forcing the artist to leave Florence with his planned &quot;Battle of Cascina&quot; painting unfinished. By this time, Michelangelo was established as an artist; both he and Julius II had hot tempers and soon argued. On 17 April 1506, Michelangelo left Rome in secret for Florence, remaining there until the Florentine government pressed him to return to the pope.


In 1506, the same year the foundation stone was laid for the new St. Peter&#x27;s, Julius II conceived a programme to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. It is probable that, because the chapel was the site of regular meetings and Masses of an elite body of officials known as the Papal Chapel (who would observe the decorations and interpret their theological and temporal significance), it was Julius II&#x27;s intention and expectation that the iconography of the ceiling was to be read with many layers of meaning.
The scheme proposed by the pope was for twelve large figures of the Apostles to occupy the pendentives. Michelangelo negotiated for a grander, much more complex scheme and was finally permitted, in his own words, &quot;to do as I liked&quot;. It has been suggested that Augustinian friar and cardinal Giles of Viterbo could have influenced the ceiling&#x27;s theological layout. Many writers consider that Michelangelo had the intellect, the biblical knowledge, and the powers of invention to have devised the scheme himself. This is supported by Michelangelo&#x27;s biographer Ascanio Condivi&#x27;s statement that the artist read and reread the Old Testament while he was painting the ceiling, drawing his inspiration from the words of the scripture, rather than from the established traditions of sacral art.

On 10 May 1506, Piero Roselli wrote to Michelangelo on behalf of the pope. In this letter, Roselli mentions that papal court architect Donato Bramante doubted that Michelangelo could take on such a large fresco project, as he had limited experience in the medium. According to Bramante, Michelangelo stated his refusal. In November 1506 Michelangelo went to Bologna, where he received a commission from the pope to construct a colossal bronze statue of him conquering the Bolognese. After he completed this in early 1508, Michelangelo returned to Rome expecting to resume work on the papal tomb, but this had been quietly set aside.
Michelangelo was instead commissioned for a cycle of frescoes on the vault and upper walls of the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo, who was not primarily a painter but a sculptor, was reluctant to take on the work; he suggested that his young rival Raphael take it on instead. The pope was persistent; according to Giorgio Vasari, he was provoked by Bramante to insist that Michelangelo take on the project, leaving him little choice but to accept. The contract was signed on 8 May 1508, with a promised fee of 3,000 ducats (approximately US$600,000 in gold in 2021). At the pope&#x27;s behest, Bramante built the initial scaffolding, hung via ropes from holes in the ceiling. This method displeased Michelangelo as it would force him to paint around the holes, and he had freestanding scaffolding constructed instead. This was built by Piero Roselli, who subsequently roughcasted the ceiling. Michelangelo initially sought to engage assistants who were more well-versed in fresco-painting, but he was unable to find suitable candidates and determined to paint the whole ceiling alone. Among the Florentine artists whom Michelangelo brought to Rome in the hope of assisting in the fresco, Vasari names Francesco Granacci, Giuliano Bugiardini, Jacopo di Sandro, l&#x27;Indaco the Elder, Agnolo di Domenico, and Aristotile.

Michelangelo soon began his work, starting at the west end with the &quot;Drunkenness of Noah&quot; and the &quot;Prophet Zechariah&quot; and working backwards through the narrative to the &quot;Creation of Eve&quot;, in the vault&#x27;s fifth bay, finished in September 1510. The first half of the ceiling was unveiled with a preliminary showing on 14 August 1511 and an official viewing the next day. A long hiatus in painting occurred as new scaffolding was made ready. The second half of the ceiling&#x27;s frescoes were done swiftly, and the finished work was revealed on 31 October 1512, All Hallows&#x27; Eve, being shown to the public by the next day, All Saints&#x27; Day. Michelangelo&#x27;s final scheme for the ceiling includes over 300 figures.
Vasari states that &quot;When the chapel was uncovered, people from everywhere [rushed] to see it, and the sight of it alone was sufficient to leave them amazed and speechless.&quot; At the age of 37, Michelangelo&#x27;s reputation rose such that he was called &quot;il divino&quot;, and he was henceforth regarded as the greatest artist of his time, who had elevated the status of the arts themselves, a recognition that lasted the rest of his long life. The ceiling was immediately considered one of the greatest masterpieces of all time, a distinction which continues to endure.

=== Method ===

Michelangelo probably began working on the plans and sketches for the design from April 1508. The preparatory work on the ceiling was complete in late July the same year and on 4 February 1510, Francesco Albertini recorded that Michelangelo had &quot;decorated the upper, arched part with very beautiful pictures and gold&quot;. The main design was largely finished in August 1510, as Michelangelo&#x27;s texts suggest. From September 1510 until February, June, or September 1511, Michelangelo did no work on the ceiling on account of a dispute over payments for work done; in August 1510 the pope left Rome for the Papal States&#x27; campaign to reconquer Bologna and despite two visits there by Michelangelo, resolution only came months after the pope&#x27;s return to Rome in June 1511. On 14 August 1511, Julius held a papal mass in the chapel and saw the progress of the work so far for the first time. This was the vigil for Assumption Day on 15 August, the Sistine Chapel&#x27;s patronal feast. The whole design was revealed to visitors on 31 October 1512 with a formal papal mass the following day, the feast of All Saints. Clerical use of the chapel continued throughout, exempting when the work on the scaffolding necessitated its closure, and disruption to the rites was minimized by beginning the work at the west end, furthest from the liturgical centre around the altar at the east wall. Debate exists on what sequence the parts of the ceiling were painted in and over how the scaffold that allowed the artists to reach the ceiling was arranged. There are two main proposals.

The majority theory is that the ceiling&#x27;s main frescoes were applied and painted in phases, with the scaffolding each time dismantled and moved to another part of the room, beginning at the chapel&#x27;s west end. The first phase, including the central life of Noah, was completed in September 1509 and the scaffolding removed; only then were the scenes visible from the floor level. The next phase, in the middle of the chapel, completed the &quot;Creation of Eve&quot; and the &quot;Fall and Expulsion from Paradise&quot;. The &quot;Cumaean Sibyl&quot; and &quot;Ezekiel&quot; were also painted in this phase. Michelangelo painted the figures at a larger scale than in the previous section; this is attributed to the artist&#x27;s ability to effectively judge the foreshortening and composition from ground level for the first time. The figures of the third phase, at the east end, were at still grander scale than the second; &quot;The Creation of Adam&quot; and the other &quot;Creation&quot; panels were finished at this stage, which took place in 1511. The lunettes above the windows were painted last, using a small movable scaffold. In this scheme, proposed by Johannes Wilde, the vault&#x27;s first and second registers, above and below the fictive architectural cornice, were painted together in stages as the scaffolding moved eastwards, with a stylistic and chronological break westwards and eastwards of the &quot;Creation of Eve&quot;. After the central vault the main scaffold was replaced by a smaller contraption that allowed the painting of the lunettes, window vaults, and pendentives. This view supplanted an older view that the central vault formed the first part of the work and was completed before work began on the other parts of Michelangelo&#x27;s plan.

Another theory is that the scaffolding must have spanned the entire chapel for years at a time. To remove the existing decoration of the ceiling, the entire area had to be accessible for workmen to chisel away the starry-sky fresco before any new work was done. On 10 June 1508, the cardinals complained of the intolerable dust and noise generated by the work; by 27 July 1508, the process was complete and the corner spandrels of the chapel had been converted into the doubled-spandrel triangular pendentives of the finished design. Then the frame of the new designs had to be marked out on the surface when frescoeing began; this too demanded access to the whole ceiling. This thesis is supported by the discovery during the modern restoration of the exact numbers of the &quot;giornate&quot; employed in the frescoes; if the ceiling was painted in two stages, the first spanning two years and extending to the &quot;Creation of Eve&quot; and the second lasting just one year, then Michelangelo would have to have painted 270 &quot;giornate&quot; in the yearlong second phase, compared with 300 painted in the first two years, which is scarcely possible. By contrast, if the ceiling&#x27;s first registerwith the nine scenes on rectangular fields, the medallions, and the &quot;ignudi&quot;was painted in the first two years, and in the second phase, Michelangelo painted only their border in the second register with the &quot;Prophets&quot; and &quot;Sibyls&quot;, then the &quot;giornate&quot; finished in each year are divided almost equally. Ulrich Pfisterer, advancing this theory, interprets Albertini&#x27;s remark on &quot;the upper, arched part with very beautiful pictures and gold&quot; in February 1510 as referring only to the upper part of the vaultthe first register with its nine picture fields, its &quot;gnudi,&quot; and its medallions embellished with goldand not to the vault as a whole since the fictive architectural attic with its prophets and prophetesses were yet to be started.

The scaffolding needed to protect the chapel&#x27;s existing wall frescoes and other decorations from falling debris and allow the religious services to continue below, but also to allow in air and some light from the windows below. The chapel&#x27;s cornice, running around the room below the lunettes at the springing of the window arches themselves, supported the structure&#x27;s oblique beams, while the carrying beams were set into the wall above the cornice using putlog holes. This open structure supported catwalks and the movable working platform itself, whose likely stepped design followed the contour of the vault. Beneath was a false ceiling that protected the chapel. Though some sunlight would have entered the workspace between the ceiling and the scaffolding, artificial light would have been required for painting, candlelight possibly influencing the appearance of the vivid colors used.

Restoration overseer Fabrizio Mancinelli speculates that Michelangelo may have only installed scaffolding platforms in one half of the room at a time to cut the cost of timber and to allow light to pass through the uncovered windows. The areas of the wall covered by the scaffolding still appear as unpainted areas at the base of the lunettes.

The entire ceiling is a fresco, which is an ancient method for painting murals that relies upon a chemical reaction between damp lime plaster and water-based pigments to permanently fuse the work into the wall. Michelangelo had been an apprentice in the workshop of Domenico Ghirlandaio, one of the most competent and prolific of Florentine fresco painters, at the time that the latter was employed on a fresco cycle at Santa Maria Novella and whose work was represented on the walls of the Sistine Chapel. At the outset, the plaster, , began to grow mildew or mould because it was too wet. When Michelangelo despaired of continuing, the pope sent Giuliano da Sangallo, who explained how to remove the fungus.
Because Michelangelo was painting &quot;alfresco&quot;, the plaster was laid in a new section every day, called a &quot;giornata&quot;. At the beginning of each session, the edges would be scraped away and a new area laid down.

The work commenced at the end of the building furthest from the altar with the last chronological part of the narrative and progressed towards the altar with the scenes of the Creation. The first three scenes, from &quot;The Drunkenness of Noah&quot;, contain crowded compositions of smaller figures than other panels, evidently, because Michelangelo misjudged the ceiling&#x27;s size. Also painted in the early stages was the &quot;Slaying of Goliath&quot;. After painting the &quot;Creation of Eve&quot; adjacent to the marble screen which divided the chapel, Michelangelo paused in his work to move the scaffolding to the other side. After having seen his completed work so far, he returned to work with the &quot;Temptation and Fall&quot;, followed by the &quot;Creation of Adam&quot;. As the scale of the work got larger, Michelangelo&#x27;s style became broader; the final narrative scene of God in the act of creation was painted in a single day.

According to Vasari, the ceiling was unveiled before it could be reworked with &quot;a secco&quot; and gold to give it &quot;a finer appearance&quot; as had been done with the chapel&#x27;s wall frescoes. Both Michelangelo and Pope Julius II wanted these details to be added, but this never took place, in part because Michelangelo did not want to rebuild the scaffolding; he also argued that &quot;in those days men did not wear gold, and those who are painted ... were holy men who despised wealth.&quot; Julius II died only months after the ceiling&#x27;s completion, in February 1513.

According to Vasari and Condivi, Michelangelo painted in a standing position, not lying on his back, as another biographer, Paolo Giovio, imagined. Vasari wrote: &quot;These frescos were done with the greatest discomfort, for he had to stand there working with his head tilted backwards.&quot; Michelangelo may have described his physical discomfort in a poem, accompanied by a sketch in the margin, which was probably addressed to the humanist academician Giovanni di Benedetto da Pistoia, a friend with whom Michelangelo corresponded. Leonard Barkan compared the posture of Michelangelo&#x27;s marginalia self-portrait to the Roman sculptures of &quot;Marsyas Bound&quot; in the Uffizi Gallery; Barkan further connects the flayed Marsyas with Michelangelo&#x27;s purported self-portrait decades later on the flayed skin of St Bartholomew in his &quot;Last Judgment&quot; but cautions that there is no certainty the sketch represents the process of painting the chapel ceiling. Michelangelo wrote the poem describing the arduous conditions under which he worked. Michelangelo&#x27;s illustrated poem reads:


Jelbert has suggested that the physical pain described in this poem, and the pose of Michelangelo in his illustration for it, resonate with the agonised postures of the Vatican&#x27;s &#x27;Laocoön Group&#x27;. In the illustration, suggests Jelbert, Michelangelo appears to have drawn himself as the dying son on the right-hand side of the group (his arm sheered at the wrist), and the figure he is painting has the raised knees, wild eyes and broken right arm of Laocoön himself. Michelangelo&#x27;s reference to the &#x27;Laocoön Group&#x27; in the &#x27;Brazen Serpent&#x27; has been noted above, but the artist also alluded to this sculpture in other areas of the Sistine ceiling, including the &#x27;Punishment of Haman&#x27;, and a pair of ignudi between the &#x27;Sacrifice of Noah&#x27; and the &#x27;Prophet Isiah&#x27;.

== Content ==


Michelangelo&#x27;s frescoes form the backstory to the 15th-century narrative cycles of the lives of Moses and Jesus Christ by Perugino and Botticelli on the chapel&#x27;s walls. While the main central scenes depict incidents in the Book of Genesis, the first book of the Bible, much debate exists on the multitudes of figures&#x27; exact interpretation. The Sistine Chapel&#x27;s ceiling is a shallow barrel vault around 35 metres (118 feet) long and around 14 m (46 ft) broad. The chapel&#x27;s windows cut into the vault&#x27;s curve, producing a row of lunettes alternating with spandrels.

Though Michelangelo claimed he eventually had a free hand in the artistic scheme, this claim was also made by Lorenzo Ghiberti about his monumental bronze doors for the Florence Baptistery, for which it is known Ghiberti was constrained by stipulations on how the Old Testament scenes should appear and was able to decide merely the forms and number of the picture fields. It is likely that Michelangelo was free to choose forms and presentation of the design, but that the subjects and themes themselves were decided by the patron.

The central, almost flat field of the ceiling is delineated by a fictive architectural cornice and divided into four large rectangles and five smaller ones by five pairs of painted ribs which cut laterally across the central rectangular field. Michelangelo painted these rectangles, which appear open to the sky, with scenes from the Old Testament.

The narrative begins at the chapel&#x27;s east end, with the first scene above the altar, focus of the Eucharistic ceremonies performed by the clergy. The small rectangular field directly above the altar depicts the &quot;Primal Act of Creation&quot;. The last of the nine central fields, at the west end, shows the &quot;Drunkenness of Noah&quot;; below this scene is the door used by the laity. Furthest from the altar, the &quot;Drunkenness of Noah&quot; represents the sinful nature of man.

Above the cornice, at the four corners of each of the five smaller central fields, are nude male youths, called &quot;ignudi&quot;, whose precise significance is unknown. Close to the sacred scenes in the uppermost register and unlike the figures of the lower register shown in perspective, they are not foreshortened. They probably represent the Florentine Neoplatonists&#x27; view of humanity&#x27;s ideal Platonic form, without the mar of Original Sin, to which the lower figures are all subject. Kenneth Clark wrote that &quot;their physical beauty is an image of divine perfection; their alert and vigorous movements an expression of divine energy&quot;.

Below the painted cornice around the central rectangular area is a lower register depicting a continuation of the chapel&#x27;s walls as a trompe-l&#x27;œil architectural framework against which figures press, with powerful modelling. The figures are drastically foreshortened and are at larger scale than the figures in the central scenes, which according to Harold Osborne and Hugh Brigstocke creates &quot;a sense of spatial disequilibrium&quot;.

The ceiling at the chapel&#x27;s four corners forms a doubled spandrel painted with salvific scenes from the Old Testament: &quot;The Brazen Serpent&quot;, &quot;The Crucifixion of Haman&quot;, &quot;Judith and Holofernes&quot;, and &quot;David and Goliath&quot;. On the crescent-shaped areas, or lunettes, above each of the chapel&#x27;s windows are tablets listing the ancestors of Christ and accompanying figures. Above them, in the triangular spandrels, a further eight groups of figures are shown, but these have not been identified with specific biblical characters. The scheme is completed by four large corner pendentives, each illustrating a dramatic biblical story.

Each of the chapel&#x27;s window arches cuts into the curved vault, creating above each a triangular area of vaulting. The arch of each window is separated from the next by these triangular spandrels, in each of which are enthroned &quot;Prophets&quot; alternating with the &quot;Sibyls&quot;. These figures, seven Old Testament prophets and five of the Graeco-Roman sibyls, were notable in Christian tradition for their prophesies of the Messiah or the Nativity of Jesus. The lunettes above the windows are themselves painted with scenes of the &quot;purely human&quot; &quot;Ancestors of Christ&quot;, as are the spaces either side of each window. Their position is both the lowest in the vault and the darkest, in contrast with the airy upper vault.

=== Interpretation ===
The overt subject matter of the ceiling is the Christian doctrine of humanity&#x27;s need for salvation as offered by God through Jesus. It is a visual metaphor of humankind&#x27;s need for a covenant with God. The Old Covenant of the Children of Israel through Moses and the New Covenant through Christ had already been represented around the walls of the chapel. Some experts, including Benjamin Blech and Vatican art historian Enrico Bruschini, have also noted less overt subject matter, which they describe as being &quot;concealed&quot; and &quot;forbidden.&quot;

The main scheme of the ceiling illustrates God creating the perfect world prior to creating humanity, which causes its own fall into disgrace and is punished by being made mortal; humanity then sinks further into sin and disgrace, and is punished by the Great Flood. The ceiling&#x27;s creation narrative ends with Noah&#x27;s drunkenness, which Jesuit theologian John W. O&#x27;Malley says could be interpreted as focusing on the separation of Gentiles from Jews as the chosen people. Then, through a lineage of ancestorsfrom Abraham to JosephGod sends the saviour of humanity, Jesus, whose coming is claimed in the New Testament to have been prophesied by prophets of Israel (to whom Michelangelo adds sibyls of the Classical world) and whose second coming the same artist returned to paint on the altar wall in his &quot;Last Judgment&quot;. The prophet Jonah, recognizable over the altar by the great fish beside him, is cited by Jesus in the gospels as being related to his own coming death and resurrection, which Staale Sinding-Larsen says &quot;activates the Passion motif&quot;. In the Gospel of John, moreover, Jesus compares his being raised (i.e. his crucifixion) to Moses lifting the Brazen Serpent to heal Israelites from fiery serpent bites; the latter is painted on the pendentive above the altar to the left, opposite the &quot;Punishment of Haman&quot;, depicted as a crucifixion instead of a hanging.

Of the three Twelve Minor Prophets depicted on the ceiling, O&#x27;Malley discusses Jonah and Zechariah as carrying a particular significance. In addition to Jonah&#x27;s connection to Jesus, O&#x27;Malley points out that he is a spokesman to the Gentiles. Zechariah prophesied that the Messiah would arrive on a donkey. His place in the chapel is directly above the doorway across from the altar, through which the pope is carried in procession on Palm Sunday, the day on which Jesus rode a donkey into Jerusalem.

Much of the symbolism of the ceiling dates from the early church, but the ceiling also has elements that express the specifically Renaissance thinking that sought to reconcile Christian theology with the philosophy of Renaissance humanism. During the 15th century in Italy, and in Florence in particular, there was a strong interest in Classical literature and the philosophies of Plato, Aristotle and other Classical writers. Michelangelo, as a young man, had spent time at the Platonic Academy established by the Medici family in Florence. He was familiar with early humanist-inspired sculptural works such as Donatello&#x27;s bronze &quot;David&quot; and had himself responded by carving the enormous nude marble &quot;David&quot;, which was placed in the Piazza della Signoria near the Palazzo Vecchio, the home of Florence&#x27;s council. The humanist view of spirituality was that it is rooted in human nature and independent from intermediaries such as the Church, which emphasized humanity as essentially sinful and flawed. A synthesis, with man dignified and created in God&#x27;s image, was epitomized by Giovanni Pico Della Mirandola&#x27;s &quot;Oration on the Dignity of Man&quot;, which was referenced in sermons given at the papal court.

The iconography of the ceiling has had various interpretations in the past, some elements of which have been contradicted by modern scholarship. Others, such as the identity of the figures in the lunettes and spandrels poppets, continue to defy interpretation. Modern scholars have sought, as yet unsuccessfully, to determine a written source of the theological program of the ceiling and have questioned whether or not it was entirely devised by Michelangelo, who was both an avid reader of the Bible and is considered to be a genius. Art historian Anthony Bertram argues that the artist expressed his inner turmoil in the work, saying: &quot;The principal opposed forces in this conflict were his passionate admiration for classical beauty and his profound, almost mystical Catholicism, his [presumed] homosexuality, and his horror of carnal sin combined with a lofty Platonic concept of love.&quot;

Edgar Wind postulated that the ten medallions represented violations of the Ten Commandments, with the obscured one above the Persian Sibyl standing for adultery. O&#x27;Malley points out that, if this is the case, the infractions of the commandments are arranged out of order.

== Architectural scheme ==
The Sistine Chapel is about 35 m (118 ft) long and wide, with the ceiling rising to about above the main floor. The vault is of quite a complex design and it is unlikely that it was originally intended to have such elaborate decoration.

The chapel walls have three horizontal tiers with six windows in the upper tier down each side. There were also two windows at each end, but these have been closed up above the altar when Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Last Judgment&quot; was painted, obliterating two lunettes. Between the windows are large pendentives which support the vault. Between the pendentives are triangularly shaped arches or spandrels cut into the vault above each window. Above the height of the pendentives, the ceiling slopes gently without much deviation from the horizontal.

The first element in the scheme of painted architecture is a definition of the &quot;real&quot; architectural elements by accentuating the lines where spandrels and pendentives intersect with the curving vault. Michelangelo painted these as decorative courses that look like sculpted stone mouldings. These have two repeating motifs: the acorn and the scallop shell. The acorn is the symbol of the family of both Pope Sixtus IV, who built the chapel, and Julius II, who commissioned Michelangelo&#x27;s work. The scallop shell is one of the symbols of the Madonna, to whose Assumption the chapel was dedicated in 1483. The crown of the wall then rises above the spandrels, to a strongly projecting painted cornice that runs right around the ceiling, separating the pictorial areas of the biblical scenes from the figures of prophets, sibyls, and ancestors, who literally and figuratively support the narratives. Ten broad painted cross-ribs of travertine cross the ceiling and divide it into alternately wide and narrow pictorial spaces, a grid that gives all the figures their defined place.

A great number of small figures are integrated with the painted architecture, their purpose apparently purely decorative. These include pilasters with capitals supported by pairs of infant &quot;telamones,&quot; rams&#x27; skulls are placed at the apex of each spandrel like &quot;bucrania&quot;; bronze nude figures in varying poses, hiding in the shadows, propped between the spandrels and the ribs like animated bookends; and more &quot;putti&quot;, both clothed and unclothed, strike a variety of poses as they support the nameplates of the &quot;Prophets and Sibyls&quot;. Above the cornice and to either side of the smaller scenes are an array of medallions, or round shields. They are framed by a total of 20 more figures, the so-called &quot;ignudi&quot;, which are not part of the architecture but sit on plinths, their feet planted convincingly on the fictive cornice. Pictorially, the &quot;ignudi&quot; appear to occupy a space between the narrative spaces and the space of the chapel itself.

== Pictorial scheme ==
Like many Renaissance patrons, Pope Julius wanted the ceiling to follow a design he specified, and in early 1508 Michelangelo was presented with a scheme, which has not survived. The ceiling was to be divided into &quot;an interlocking geometric pattern of squares and circles&quot;, and images were to include the Twelve Apostles on the pendentives. Other commissions by Julius in the same year, for ceilings in Santa Maria del Popolo and the Stanza della Segnatura in the Vatican Palace, also had geometric frameworks, all probably influenced by the Imperian Roman remains of Hadrian&#x27;s Villa, Tivoli.

Michelangelo worked on drawings following the Pope&#x27;s scheme, but eventually decided that it did not allow for sufficient numbers of human figures, his main interest in the commission. At a meeting later in the year, Julius allowed Michelangelo to change the design; according to Michelangelo&#x27;s later account &quot;he gave me a new commission, to do what I liked&quot;, a claim many art historians suspect is rather overstated.

The artist almost certainly worked with one or more specialist theologians, perhaps including Egidio da Viterbo, and perhaps the aristocratic papal diplomat Cardinal Francesco Alidosi, who Michelangelo used to help him dealing with Julius.

=== Nine scenes from the Book of Genesis ===
Along the central section of the ceiling, Michelangelo depicted nine scenes from the Book of Genesis, organized into three groups of three related scenes. The scenes alternate between smaller and larger pictures, with the former framed by two pairs of &quot;ignudi&quot; flanking a medallion.
The first group depicts God creating the Heavens and the Earth. The second group shows God creating the first man and woman, Adam and Eve, and their disobedience of God and consequent expulsion from the Garden of Eden. The third group shows the plight of humanity and in particular the family of Noah.

The pictures within the three groups link to one another, in the same way as was usual in Mediaeval paintings and stained glass. The nine scenes are oriented to be viewed while facing the altar, chronologically unfolding towards the chapel entrance (except for the second and third scenes, and the seventh and eighth, which are each transposed). John T. Paoletti and Gary M. Radke suggest that this reversed progression symbolises a return to a state of grace.
The scenes, from the altar towards the main door, are as follows:

# &quot;The Separation of Light from Darkness&quot;
# &quot;The Creation of the Sun, Moon and Plants&quot;
# &quot;The Separation of Land and Water&quot;
# &quot;The Creation of Adam&quot;
# &quot;The Creation of Eve&quot;
# &quot;The Fall and Expulsion&quot;
# &quot;The Sacrifice of Noah&quot;
# &quot;The Great Flood&quot;
# &quot;The Drunkenness of Noah&quot;

==== Creation ====
The three creation pictures show scenes from the first chapter of Genesis, which relates that God created the Earth and its inhabitants in six days, resting on the seventh day. In the first scene, the &quot;First Day of Creation&quot;, God creates light and separates light from darkness. Chronologically, the next scene takes place in the third panel, in which, on the &quot;Second Day&quot;, God divides the waters from the heavens. In the central scene, the largest of the three, there are two representations of God: on the &quot;Third Day&quot;, God creates the Earth and makes it sprout plants; on the &quot;Fourth Day&quot;, God puts the Sun and the Moon in place to govern the night and the day, the time and the seasons of the year.

These three scenes, completed in the third stage of painting, are the most broadly conceived, the most broadly painted and the most dynamic of all the pictures. Of the first scene Vasari says, &quot;Michelangelo depicted God dividing the light from the darkness ... where He is seen in all His majesty as He sustains Himself alone with open arms in a demonstration of love and creative energy.&quot;

==== Adam and Eve ====

For the central section of the ceiling, Michelangelo took four episodes from the story of Adam and Eve as told in the first, second and third chapters of Genesis. In this sequence of three, two of the panels are large and one small.

In the first of the pictures, one of the most widely recognized images in the history of painting, Michelangelo shows God reaching out to touch Adam. Vasari describes Adam as &quot;a figure whose beauty, pose, and contours are of such a quality that he seems newly created by his Supreme and First Creator rather than by the brush and design of a mere mortal.&quot; From beneath the sheltering arm of God, Eve looks out somewhat apprehensively. Correspondingly, Adam reaches out to the creator, who Walter Pater states &quot;comes with the forms of things to be, woman and her progeny, in the fold of his garment&quot;. Pater wrote of the depiction of Adam in the &quot;Creation&quot;:

The central scene, of God creating Eve from the side of the sleeping Adam has been taken in its composition directly from another creation sequence, the relief panels that surround the door of the Basilica of San Petronio, Bologna, by Jacopo della Quercia, whose work Michelangelo had studied in his youth.
In the final panel of this sequence, Michelangelo combines two contrasting scenes into one panel, that of Adam and Eve taking fruit from the forbidden tree (a fig and not an apple tree as commonly depicted in Western Christian art), Eve trustingly taking it from the hand of the Serpent (depicted as Lilith) and Adam eagerly picking it for himself, as well as their banishment from the Garden of Eden, where they have lived in the company of God, to the world outside where they have to fend for themselves and experience death.

==== Noah ====
As with the first sequence of pictures, the three panels concerning Noah, taken from the sixth to ninth chapters of Genesis are thematic rather than chronological. In the first scene is shown the sacrifice of a sheep. Both Vasari and Condivi mistake this scene for the sacrifices by Cain and Abel, in which Abel&#x27;s sacrifice was acceptable to God and Cain&#x27;s was not. What this image almost certainly depicts is the sacrifice made by the family of Noah, after their safe deliverance from the Great Flood which destroyed the rest of humanity.

The central, larger, scene shows the Great Flood. The Ark in which Noah&#x27;s family escaped floats at the rear of the picture while the rest of humanity tries frantically to scramble to some point of safety. A lightning bolt, which according to Condivi illustrated God&#x27;s wrath, was smitten from the ceiling when the chapel was damaged in 1797.

The final scene is the story of Noah&#x27;s drunkenness. After the Flood, Noah tills the soil and grows vines. He is shown doing so in the background of the picture. He becomes drunk and inadvertently exposes himself. His youngest son, Ham, brings his two brothers Shem and Japheth to see the sight but they discreetly cover their father with a cloak. Ham is later cursed by Noah and told that the descendants of Ham&#x27;s son Canaan will serve Shem and Japheth&#x27;s descendants forever.

Since Michelangelo executed the nine biblical scenes in reverse chronological order, some analyses of the frescoes of the vault commence with the &quot;Drunkenness of Noah&quot;. Charles de Tolnay&#x27;s neoplatonic interpretation sees the story of Noah at the beginning and the act of creation by God as the conclusion of the process of &quot;deificatio&quot; and the return from physical to spiritual being.

==== Medallions ====
Adjacent to the smaller biblical scenes in the first register and supported by the paired &quot;ignudi&quot; are ten medallions. In four of the five most highly finished, the space is crowded with figures in violent action, similar to Michelangelo&#x27;s cartoon for the &quot;Battle of Cascina&quot;. The subjects depicted are somewhat ambiguous, with Vasari merely saying they are taken from the Book of Kings. According to Ulrich Pfisterer, Michelangelo adapted the medallions from woodcut illustrations in the 1490 Malermi Bible, the first Italian-language Bible, named after its translator, Nicolò Malermi. The medallions have been interpreted as depicting:

* Abraham about to sacrifice his son Isaac
* The Destruction of the Statue of Baal
* The worshippers of Baal being brutally slaughtered
* Uriah being beaten to death
* Nathan the priest condemning King David for murder and adultery
* King David&#x27;s traitorous son Absalom caught by his hair in a tree while trying to escape and beheaded by David&#x27;s troops
* Joab sneaking up on Abner to murder him
* Joram being hurled from a chariot onto his head
* Elijah being carried up to Heaven
* A subject which was either obliterated or left incomplete


=== Twelve prophetic figures ===

On the five pendentives along each side and the two at either end, Michelangelo painted the largest figures on the ceiling: twelve people who prophesied a Messiah. These twelve are seven male prophets of Israel and five &quot;Sibyls,&quot; prophetesses of classical mythology. &quot;Jonah&quot; is placed above the altar and &quot;Zechariah&quot; at the opposite end. The other five &quot;Prophets&quot; and &quot;Sibyls&quot; alternate down each long side, each being identified by an inscription on a painted marble tablet supported by a &quot;putto&quot;.
* Jonah () – above the altar
* Jeremiah ()
* Persian Sibyl ()
* Ezekiel ()
* Erythraean Sibyl ()
* Joel ()
* Zechariah () – above the main door of the chapel
* Delphic Sibyl ()
* Isaiah ()
* Cumaean Sibyl ()
* Daniel ()
* Libyan Sibyl ()

==== Prophets ====
Seven prophets of Israel are depicted on the ceiling, including the four so-called major prophetsIsaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Danieland three of the Twelve Minor Prophets: Joel, Zechariah, and Jonah.
The Book of Joel prophesies the triumph of Judah over its enemies, and includes the words, &quot;Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams [and] your young men shall see visions.&quot; Zechariah was the first &quot;Prophet&quot; to be painted.

Condivi praises &quot;Jonah&quot;, including its foreshortening. In Vasari&#x27;s description of the &quot;Prophets and Sibyls&quot; he is particularly high in his praise of &quot;Isaiah&quot;, saying, &quot;anyone who examines this figure will see details taken from Nature herself, the true mother of the art of painting, and will see a figure that with close study can in broad terms teach all the precepts of good painting.&quot;

==== Sibyls ====
The Sibyls were prophetic women who were resident at shrines or temples throughout the Classical world. These women were similar to Christian prophets in the sense that they were &quot;spokeswomen for the divine oracles&quot; and served as an &quot;mouthpiece of the gods&quot;. Furthermore, the Sibyls embodied feminine figures that received messages from the gods and prophesized said messages to the ancient Greeks and Romans who heavily regarded their divinatory practices. Their prophecies predate those of the Christian prophets and were contextually paganistic due to the commonly known beliefs at that time.

Authors from antiquity utilized the Greco-Roman Sibyls to legitimize Christianity. The papal court generally regarded antiquity as setting the stage for Christianity. The text &quot;Divine Institutes&quot; by Lactanitus, a Christian author that was an advisor to Emperor Constantine in 280, was one of the first texts composed to legitimize Christianity and convert pagans and gentiles to the religion. In &quot;Divine Institutions,&quot; Lactantius states “Another Sibyl ... conveyed the word of God to man and said ‘I am the only god and there is no other.’”, validating monotheism from the written account of a pagan Sibyl. Additionally, the Cumaean Sibyl is quoted by 1st-century BC Roman poet Virgil in his Fourth &quot;Eclogue&quot; as declaring that &quot;a new progeny of Heaven&quot; would bring about a return of the &quot;Golden Age&quot;. Many people during the Renaissance interpreted this as foretelling the birth of Jesus.

This association of the Sibyls with Christianity also progresses into Christian worship in the Middle Ages, as they appeared in the Dies Irae Latin hymn produced by either the Franciscan or Dominican monastic order. The hymn utilizes the pagan Sybil as a witness to David&#x27;s lineage to Christ and uses these figures from Greco-Roman antiquity to support the Christian beliefs of the coming of Christ from an era before the prophets. There was an increasing interest in the remains of Rome&#x27;s pagan past within the Catholic Church; scholars had turned from reading Mediaeval ecclesiastical Latin texts to classical Latin and the philosophies of the Classical world were studied along with the writings of St Augustine. Thus, the presence of five pagan prophets in the Sistine Chapel is not surprising. Furthermore, this is not the first appearance of Sibyls within a Christian church. Michelangelo&#x27;s mentor Domenico Ghirlandaio painted Sibyls on the ceiling of Santa Trinita&#x27;s Sassetti Chapel approximately 20 years prior to the start of the Sistine Chapel ceiling.

It is not known why Michelangelo selected the five particular Sibyls that were depicted, given that there were ten possibilities. O&#x27;Malley suggests that the four besides the Cumaean Sibyl were selected for a wide geographic coverage, as they come from Africa, Asia, Greece and Ionia.

Vasari says of the &quot;Erythraean Sibyl&quot;: &quot;This figure is extraordinarily beautiful owing to the expression of its face, the arrangement of its hair, and the style of its garments, not to mention its bare arms, which are as beautiful as the rest of the body.&quot;

=== Pendentives ===
In each corner of the chapel is a triangular pendentive filling the space between the walls and the arch of the vault and forming a doubled spandrel above the windows nearest the corners. On these curving shapes Michelangelo has painted four scenes from biblical stories that are associated with the salvation of Israel by four great male and female heroes of the Jews: Moses, Esther, David and Judith. The first two stories were both seen in Mediaeval and Renaissance theology as prefiguring the Crucifixion of Jesus. The other two stories, those of David and Judith, were often linked in Renaissance art, particularly by Florentine artists as they demonstrated the overthrow of tyrants, a popular subject in the Republic.
* The Punishment of Haman – seen to the left when facing east, towards the altar
* The Brazen Serpent – seen to the right when facing east, towards the altar
* Judith and Holofernes – seen to the left when facing west, towards the rear
* David and Goliath – seen to the right when facing west, towards the rear

In the Book of Esther, it is related that Haman, a public servant, plots to get Esther&#x27;s husband, the king of Persia, to slay all the Jewish people in his land. The king, who is going over his books during a sleepless night, realizes something is amiss. Esther, discovering the plot, denounces Haman, and her husband orders his execution on a scaffold he has built. The king&#x27;s eunuchs promptly carry this out. Michelangelo shows Haman crucified (instead of hanged as in the original story) with Esther looking at him from a doorway and the king giving orders in the background. The composition shows Haman at the table with Esther, as well as being crucified. Mordechai sits on the steps, linking the scenes.

In the story of the Brazen Serpent, the people of Israel become dissatisfied and grumble at God. As punishment, they receive a plague of venomous snakes. God offers the people relief by instructing Moses to make a snake of brass and set it up on a pole, the sight of which gives miraculous healing. The composition is crowded with figures and separate incidents as the various individuals who have been attacked by snakes struggle and die or turn toward the icon that will save them. This is the most Mannerist of Michelangelo&#x27;s earlier compositions at the chapel.

Writing in the 19th century, English art critic John Ruskin compares &quot;The Brazen Serpent&quot; favourably to the canonical classical statue group &quot;Laocoön and His Sons&quot;, which Michelangelo saw upon its discovery in 1506. Both works are crowded compositions of figures attacked by supernatural reptiles: the &quot;fiery serpents&quot; of the book of Numbers and the sea monsters of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Ruskin states that he prefers the sublimity expressed by Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;gigantic intellect&quot; in &quot;the grandeur of the plague itself, in its multitudinous grasp, and its mystical salvation&quot; and his &quot;awfulness and quietness&quot; to the &quot;meagre lines and contemptible tortures of the Laocoön&quot; and argued that &quot;the grandeur of this treatment results, not merely from choice, but from a greater knowledge and more faithful rendering of truth&quot;. Attacking the sculpture&#x27;s unnaturalistic snakes as &quot;pieces of tape with heads to them&quot; and criticizing the unrealistic struggle, he praises the painting

&quot;Judith and Holofernes&quot; depicts the episode in the &quot;Book of Judith&quot;. As Judith loads the enemy&#x27;s head onto a basket carried by her maid and covers it with a cloth, she looks towards the tent, apparently distracted by the limbs of the decapitated corpse flailing about. The composition is vertically split, not unlike the &quot;Punishment of Haman&quot; at the opposite corner of the chapel.

In &quot;David and Goliath&quot;, the shepherd boy, David, has brought down the towering Goliath with his sling, but the giant is alive and is trying to rise as David forces his head down to chop it off.
&quot;David and Goliath&quot; is a relatively simple composition, with the two protagonists centrally placed and the only other figures being background observers.

=== Ancestors of Christ ===

Either side of the chapel has six windows, as well as two closed windows at the rear, and two above the altar which were covered by &quot;The Last Judgment&quot;. Above each window is an arched shape, referred to as a lunette. Above each of the eight most central side lunettes is a triangular spandrel (topped by symmetrical pairs of bronze nudes); the other six lunettes are below the corner pendentives.
These regions link the walls and the ceiling; the figures painted on them are intermediate in size (approximately 2 m tall), between the very large prophets on the ceiling and the much smaller papal portraits which had been painted on either side of each window in the 15th century. Michelangelo chose the ancestors of Christ as the subject of these images, thus juxtaposing Jesus&#x27; physical lineage with the popes, his spiritual successors according to the Church.

Centrally placed above each window is a &quot;faux&quot; marble tablet with a decorative frame. On each is painted the names of the male line by which Jesus, through his earthly father, Joseph, is descended from Abraham, according to the Gospel of Matthew. However, the genealogy is now incomplete, since the two lunettes of the windows in the altar wall were destroyed by Michelangelo when he returned to the chapel in 1537 to paint &quot;The Last Judgment&quot;. Only engravings, based on a drawing that has since been lost, remain of them. The sequence of tablets seems somewhat erratic as one plaque has four names, most have three or two, and two plaques have only one. Moreover, the progression moves from one side of the building to the other, but not consistently, and the figures the lunettes contain do not coincide closely with the listed names. These figures vaguely suggest various family relationships; most lunettes contain one or more infants, and many depict a man and a woman, often sitting on opposing sides of the painted plaque that separates them. O&#x27;Malley describes them as &quot;simply representative figures, almost ciphers&quot;.

The figures in the lunettes appear to be families, but in every case they are families that are divided. The figures in them are physically divided by the name tablet but they are also divided by a range of human emotions that turn them outward or in on themselves and sometimes towards their partner with jealousy, suspicion, rage or simply boredom. In them Michelangelo has portrayed the anger and unhappiness of the human condition, painting, in Andrew Graham-Dixon&#x27;s words, &quot;the daily round of merely domestic life as if it were a curse&quot;. In their constraining niches, Gabriele Bartz and Eberhard König say, the ancestors &quot;sit, squat and wait&quot;. Of the 14 lunettes, the two that were probably painted first, the families of Eleazar and Mathan and of Jacob and his son Joseph, are the most detailed. They become progressively broader towards the altar end, as Michelangelo painted faster and more furiously.

Because of the constraints of the triangular shape, in each spandrel the figures are seated on the ground. Six include groups of figures, mostly adults with a child. Of the two remaining, one shows a woman with shears trimming the neck of a garment she is making while her toddler looks on. The biblical woman who is recorded as making a new garment for her child is Hannah, the mother of Samuel, whose child went to live in the temple; the male figure in the background is wearing a distinctive hat that might suggest that of a priest. Another female figure sits staring out of the picture.

In the restoration process, the figure of Amminadab was shown to be wearing a contemporary Jewish badge, the wearing of which was being rigorously enforced at the time. Depictions normally occur in a pejorative context, and seem to link this figure from the Jewish past to the Renaissance present. In this case, it appears to place Amminadab as permanently exiled from salvation.

Prior to restoration, of all the paintings in the chapel, the lunettes and spandrels were the dirtiest. Added to this, there has always been a problem of poor daytime visibility of the panels nearest the windows because of &quot;halination&quot;, the effect of bright areas blurring over less bright ones.

=== &quot;Ignudi&quot; ===

The &quot;ignudi&quot; are the 20 athletic, nude males that Michelangelo painted as supporting figures at each corner of the five smaller creation scenes on the ceiling, each pair enclosing a medallion supported by ribands above the &quot;Prophets&quot; and &quot;Sibyls&quot;. The figures hold, are draped with, or lean on items like ribbons, pillows, and large garlands of acorns,
in widely varying postures. Mostly decorative, they provided Michelangelo a prime opportunity to express himself. The poses were copied by other Renaissance artists, including Bartolommeo Bandinelli and the workshop of Raphael (for &quot;The Baptism of Constantine&quot;).

Some have suggested that the &quot;ignudi&quot; could represent angels, similar to cherubs. O&#x27;Malley compares them to sculptures of Atlas or Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Slaves&quot; from Julius II&#x27;s tomb. In their reflection of classical antiquity they resonate with Pope Julius&#x27;s aspirations to lead Italy towards a new &#x27;age of gold&#x27;; at the same time, they staked Michelangelo&#x27;s claim to greatness. Contrarily, a number of critics were angered by their presence and nudity, including Pope Adrian VI.

== Stylistic analysis and artistic legacy ==
Michelangelo was the artistic heir to the great 15th-century sculptors and painters of Florence. He learned his trade first under the direction of a masterly fresco painter, Domenico Ghirlandaio, known for two great fresco cycles in the Sassetti Chapel and Tornabuoni Chapel, and for his contribution to the cycle of paintings on the walls of the Sistine Chapel. As a student Michelangelo studied and drew from the works of some of the most renowned Florentine fresco painters of the early Renaissance, including Giotto and perhaps Masaccio. Masaccio&#x27;s figures of Adam and Eve being expelled from the Garden of Eden had a profound effect on the depiction of the nude in general, and in particular on its use to convey human feeling. Helen Gardner says that in the hands of Michelangelo, &quot;the body is simply the manifestation of the soul, or of a state of mind and character.&quot;

Michelangelo was also almost certainly influenced by the paintings of Luca Signorelli, whose paintings, particularly the &quot;Death and Resurrection Cycle&quot; in Orvieto Cathedral, contain a great number of nudes and inventive figurative compositions. In Bologna, Michelangelo saw the relief sculptures of Jacopo della Quercia around the &quot;Porta Magna&quot; of the minor basilica. In Michelangelo&#x27;s depiction of the &quot;Creation of Eve&quot; the whole composition, the form of the figures and the relatively conservative concept of the relationship between Eve and her Creator adheres closely to Jacopo&#x27;s design. Other panels on the ceiling, most particularly the iconic &quot;Creation of Adam&quot; show what Bartz and König call &quot;unprecedented invention&quot;; the pair call the ceiling in general &quot;an artistic vision without precedent&quot;.

Older depictions of the creation scenes had depicted God as mostly immobile, a static, enthroned image whose activity was indicated by a gesture of the hand, as in the creation scenes of the mediaeval Byzantine-style mosaics of Monreale Cathedral. Michelangelo, influenced by the &quot;Paradiso&quot; of Dante Alighieri, shows God in full-bodied movement, an innovation Giovanni di Paolo had made in his &quot;Creation and Expulsion from Paradise.&quot; Paolo Uccello also had shown some movement in his scene of the creation of Adam and Eve in the cloister of Santa Maria Novella. In di Paolo&#x27;s painting, as in Michelangelo&#x27;s fresco, God is accompanied and apparently carried aloft by attendant &quot;putti&quot;. Raphael employed movement somewhat more in his contemporary &quot;The Prime Mover&quot;, next door to the Sistine Chapel in the s&quot;tanza della segnatura&quot; and painted 1509–11; Perugino&#x27;s slightly earlier &quot;Creator&quot; in fresco&quot;,&quot; in the room named for Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Incendio del Borgo&quot;, shows a seated, static divinity.

The Sistine Chapel ceiling was to have a profound effect upon other artists, even before it was completed. Vasari, in his &quot;Life of Raphael&quot;, tells us that Bramante, who had the keys to the chapel, let Raphael in to examine the paintings in Michelangelo&#x27;s absence; on seeing Michelangelo&#x27;s prophets, Raphael went back to the picture of Isaiah that he was painting on a column in the Church of Sant&#x27;Agostino and, although it was finished, he scraped it off the wall and repainted it in a much more powerful manner in imitation of Michelangelo. O&#x27;Malley points out that even earlier than the &quot;Isaiah&quot; is Raphael&#x27;s inclusion of the figure of Heraclitus in the &quot;School of Athens&quot;, a brooding figure similar to Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Jeremiah&quot;, but with the countenance of Michelangelo himself, and leaning on a block of marble.
Bartz and König state of the &quot;ignudi&quot;, &quot;There is no image that has had a more lasting effect on following generations than this. Henceforth similar figures disported themselves in innumerable decorative works, be they painted, formed in stucco or even sculpted.&quot;

In January 2007, it was claimed that as many as 10,000 visitors passed through the Vatican Museums in a day, double the quantity of the previous decade.

== Damage and restoration ==
The ceiling had suffered a degree of damage as early as the mid-16th century. In 1797, a gunpowder explosion in the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo damaged part of the &quot;Flood&quot; fresco and one of the &quot;ignudi&quot; (the latter being preserved by a drawing by a pupil of Michelangelo).

Over the centuries after the ceiling&#x27;s painting, it became so aged by candle smoke and layers of varnish as to significantly mute the original colours. Some restorations took place in the early and mid-20th century. After preliminary tests taking place in 1979, the ceiling was restored between 1980 and 1992.
The first stage of restoration, the work upon Michelangelo&#x27;s lunettes, was performed between June 1980 and October 1984. The work then proceeded to the ceiling, completed on 31 December 1989, and from there to &quot;The Last Judgment&quot;. The restoration was unveiled by Pope John Paul II on 8 April 1994.

The restoration of the ceiling was directed by Fabrizio Mancinelli and performed by Gianluigi Colalucci, Maurizio Rossi, Pier Giorgio Bonetti, and Bruno Baratti.
The restoration has removed the filter of grime to reveal colours closer to the paintings at the time of their completion. The ceiling now appears to depict daytime scenes and a springlike atmosphere with bright saturated colours. The restoration was met with both praise and criticism. Critics assert that much original work by Michelangelo – in particular pentimenti, highlights and shadows, and other detailing painted &quot;a secco&quot; – was lost in the removal of various accretions.

In 2007, the Vatican, anxious at the possibility that the newly restored frescoes would suffer damage, announced plans to reduce visiting hours and raise the price in an attempt to discourage visitors.

== Quotations ==


The art critic and television producer Waldemar Januszczak wrote that when the Sistine Chapel ceiling was recently cleaned, he &quot;was able to persuade the man at the Vatican who was in charge of Japanese TV access to let me climb the scaffold while the cleaning was in progress.&quot;

I sneaked up there a few times. And under the bright, unforgiving lights of television, I was able to encounter the real Michelangelo. I was so close to him I could see the bristles from his brushes caught in the paint; and the mucky thumbprints he&#x27;d left along his margins. The first thing that impressed me was his speed. Michelangelo worked at Schumacher pace. ... I also enjoyed his sense of humour, which, from close up, turned out to be refreshingly puerile. If you look closely at the angels who attend the scary prophetess on the Sistine ceiling known as the Cumaean Sibyl, you will see that one of them has stuck his thumb between his fingers in that mysteriously obscene gesture that visiting fans are still treated to today at Italian football matches.

<text>The Colombian Communist Party (, PCC) is a legal communist party in Colombia. It was founded in 1930 as the Communist Party of Colombia, at which point it was the Colombian section of the Comintern. The party is led by Jaime Caycedo and publishes a weekly newspaper named &quot;Voz&quot;.

The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) was founded as the armed wing of the PCC in 1964, but the two organisations separated in 1993.

==History==

The Communist Party of Colombia was established in 1930 as the Colombian branch of the Comintern. The party pushed for improved conditions for Colombian laborers and an expansion of rights for the lower classes in Colombian society. Through the PCC, groups of laborers organized to combat the regulations and actions of the government and empowered corporations. These groups, known as &quot;peasant leagues&quot;, established an interconnected network that coordinated protests and labor strikes, countered state-sanctioned violence, and sought to protect local populations. The state opposed the actions of these groups through military violence in attempt to repress the influence of the PCC. The PCC continued growing in membership and support, even as the Colombian Conservative Party returned to power in 1946 with Conservative Mariano Ospina Perez winning the presidency. In the mid-1960s the U.S. State Department estimated the party membership to be approximately 13,000, with further support from over 25,000 Colombian citizens.

During the events of &quot;La Violencia&quot; and after the development of &quot;La Frente Nacional&quot; (The National Front), the Colombian government continued its repression of communist groups and takeover of land. The PCC became involved with guerrilla groups and local communist militias who continued rebelling against the national government. While many such guerrilla groups disbanded and demobilized during the ceasefire proclaimed by General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla in the early 1950s, various entities continued their mobilization efforts. PCC leadership, joined by guerilla leaders, established las &quot;Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia—Ejército del Pueblo&quot; or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The PCC would be involved with FARC until 1993.

Three members of the PCC were known to have undergone training with the East German Ministry of State Security (MfS); such courses, provided by the &quot;Task Force of the Minister, Responsibility Special Issues&quot; (&quot;Arbeitsgruppe des Ministers, Aufgabenbereich Sonderfragen&quot;- AGM/S) and additionally accompanied by KGB officers, encompassed a wide range of paramilitary infiltration and sabotage techniques, but no additional details are known.

The PCC was a founding member of the Social and Political Front (FSP) party coalition, which later merged into the Alternative Democratic Pole (PDA) alliance. The PCC was expelled from the PDA in August 2012 because of its affiliation to Patriotic March, another political alliance.

President-elect Gustavo Petro announced on 6 August 2022 that PCC member Gloria Inés Ramírez would become Colombia&#x27;s new Minister of Labor. This marked the first time that a member of the PCC had obtained a ministerial position in the Colombian government.

==Relationship with FARC==

===Early years===
During and following the &quot;La Violencia&quot; civil war that erupted in Colombia from the late 1940s to the mid-1950s, the communists developed organic links to several liberal guerrilla and irregular rural forces, most of whom nominally depended on the official Colombian Liberal Party and eventually demobilized by the end of that period. Those groups with more direct relations with the PCC tended to not demobilize, keeping their weapons and organizational structures mostly intact. In 1947, a short-lived Communist Labour Party was formed by former members of the PCC.

Later, in 1964, a section of these guerrillas would develop into the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC-EP), which initially was considered as the official armed wing of the Communist party. The PCC leadership mostly operated in the cities during the 1960s and 1970s, but it supported the operations of the FARC, regularly holding solidarity and donation rallies for FARC members and units, as well as occasionally providing other forms of aid (supplies, equipment, intelligence, political cadres or ideological literature).

The PCC justified the operations of the guerrillas as the armed component of the fight against capitalism and imperialism in Colombia, while at the same time it continued to participate in legal electoral activities independently. Both activities were considered to have their own place within the so-called &quot;combination of all forms of struggle&quot;, a concept often employed by PCC and FARC.

===Moving apart===
Gradually the PCC and FARC-EP grew apart politically, in particular during the later 1980s. Both organizations had their share of internal debates, for example as to which entity would have greater influence and control over the Unión Patriótica (in the end the PCC accepted FARC supremacy in this regard) during its formation, and later on the issue of continuing to participate in elections as the UP suffered violent suppression (the FARC began to separate itself from legal UP activities starting in 1987).

Other disagreements would include that the PCC may have allegedly tended to follow the changes that developed within the official Soviet line during the Cold War, which the FARC-EP did not consider as strictly binding. After the Berlin Wall fell, confusion among the two sides increased. The principle of the &quot;combination of all forms of struggle&quot; was also brought into question at the time by some members of the PCC and UP leadership. The PCC officially broke with the FARC in 1993.

As a result, a separate Clandestine Colombian Communist Party was officially formed in 2000, though some sort of separate FARC-based internal party structure had been in &quot;de facto&quot; existence during most of the 1990s. Both organizations have remained completely distinct in their activities, though individual members of both parties may have continued to maintain working relationships on occasion.

==Persecution==
During most of its history, the PCC has been the subject of repression and persecution both by private individuals, active and retired government agents and others. The PCC was severely weakened by paramilitary massacres and assassinations from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s.

A leading PCC figure, Arturo Díaz García, was assassinated on 21 December 2005 in the corregimiento of Toche in the municipality of Ibagué, Tolima. Supporters of David Ravelo, a member of the PCC&#x27;s central committee who is serving an 18-year sentence for plotting to murder a municipal official, contend that he is a political prisoner who was prosecuted illegitimately.

Nearly 7,000 communist militants have been killed since the 1980s.

<text>Education in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was a socialist education system and was compulsory from age 6 until age 16. State-run schools included crèches, kindergartens, polytechnic schools, extended secondary schools, vocational training, and universities.

== Crèches ==

The majority of East German parents (85%) worked outside of the home which resulted in a significant need for childcare services throughout the country. Children up to the age of three attended state run crèches (&quot;Kinderkrippen&quot;) which were often situated next to kindergarten buildings. Throughout the history of East Germany, young women would serve or volunteer in crèches in order to have more of an influence in raising their children.

Many crèches and polytechnic schools had a number of specialists on site, such as their own doctors and dentists.

A considerable number of crèches were built and developed during the post-Second World War construction period. The crèches were often situated within walking distance of residential blocks or on site at factories and collective farms.

Crèches were able to support approximately 80% of young East German children with rates as high as 99% in several urban centres. It cost 27.50 East German marks per child per month for full day care at the crèches.

In the 1950s, a six-day week was in force, and the young socialist republic needed women at work, so the GDR created weekly nurseries. Anyone could drop their child off at one of these facilities starting at 5 a.m. on Monday morning and leave them there until 6 p.m. on Friday. At least one hundred thousand children were accommodated in these weekly childcare centers between 1950 and the end of the GDR. Today, few mothers are willing to talk openly about the choice to hand their children off to the state at such a young age.

== Kindergartens ==
Unlike West Germany, East Germany accomplished large-scale education reform and introduced a dense network of high-standard education facilities, especially kindergartens. A unique characteristic of East German kindergartens was the strong educational background of these institutions. Children from age three to six learned to interact with other children, got used to a stable daily routine and were introduced to the idea of learning. The children stayed together in the same group with the same group educator during the three years. The groups were called the little group (&quot;kleine Gruppe&quot;) for the young children of the age of three, the middle group (&quot;mittlere Gruppe&quot;) for the children of the age of four and the big group (&quot;große Gruppe&quot;) for children of the age of five.

The Ministry for National Education ensured the curriculum aligned with socialist principles. Two times a day there were lesson-like pre-school activities (&quot;Beschäftigungen&quot;) that all children had to participate in. These activities were planned by the group educator and lasted 20 minutes in the little group, 25 minutes in the middle group and 30 minutes in the big group. The contents of the activities were regulated nationwide by a uniform teaching plan and included German language and speech, children&#x27;s literature, mathematics, introduction to the socialist life (visiting factories, traffic education, cultural life, introduction to professions deemed important), introduction to natural and scientific phenomena (weather, seasons, sky, stars, rocks etc.), music, sports, artistic and constructive handicrafts and esteeming pieces of art.

There was no teaching of reading, writing or arithmetic, but the fundamental concepts were taught to develop intellectual and motor skills. For instance, introduction to set theory within the numbers up to 10, counting up to 20, handling of quantities, crafts and motor skills exercises to prepare the hand to writing, the handling of pencils, scissors, fabrics and glue.

Children were also encouraged to take an active role in the running of their kindergartens. Children often had to serve each other meals and help keep the kindergarten clean and tidy.

There were no fees charged for the full-day care in kindergartens and there were enough places for 94% to 99% of East German children. By 1970, 65% of children in this age group were enrolled in kindergartens.

==Polytechnic schools==

The polytechnic secondary school, abbreviation POS for &quot;Polytechnische Oberschule&quot;, was developed from 1957 to 1958 and established in 1959. The POS focused strongly on German language, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, physical geography, sports, history, political education and of course, technology-related theoretical and practical work, including gardening, woodwork, metal work. Religion was not taught in school, but could be learned in the respective religious community outside of school. Instead of a comprehensive school with primary education followed by secondary education, the POS restructured the classic education process completely by establishing a systemic curriculum which expanded the concepts of secondary education into the lower classes. For instance in mathematics, handling of variables, math text problems with a multi-level solution, a fully developed embedded course in geometry, the introduction to vectors, the handling and solving of simple equations etc. were taught from the beginning of the first grade. But nevertheless other subjects like arts, music and so forth were not neglected but emphasised to be important for an all-around, gapless general education.
One lesson would last 45 minutes and students went to school six days a week. On Saturdays, there were approximately four or five lessons. The Ministry of Education determined a table of lessons (&quot;Stundentafel&quot;) which expressed the ideas of the curriculum by naming the subjects that were believed to be crucial for a modern general education together with the number of weekly lessons for every single subject. The table of lessons fragmented in two parts, the compulsory teaching (&quot;obligatorischer Unterricht&quot;) and the elective teaching (&quot;fakultativer Unterricht&quot;). Later a third component was introduced, the optionally compulsory teaching (&quot;wahlweise obligatorischer Unterricht&quot;).

Together, with the introduction of the POS grading at schools was reorganized as well.

School started early, usually between 7 am or 8 am.

The POS was designed as a reliable all-day school (&quot;verläßliche Tagesschule&quot;), which means the compulsory lessons took place in the morning and the timetable for each class was organised in a way that there should not be any free periods while classes should end at the same time every day. Therefore, by allocating sufficient resources to the education system, East Germany employed a high number of teachers and educators, so the average number of students per class lessened from 26 in the fifties to 19 and less in the seventies, the high number of compulsory lessons were evenly spread throughout the six schooldays of the week, there was de facto no loss of class time because of ill teachers or shortage of teachers, the compulsory teaching was finished around noon and the afternoon was free for a variety of optional activities like elective teaching, study groups, project groups, children&#x27;s sports and organised afternoon care for students in the lower classes.

The beginning of the school year was September 1 unless that day was a Thursday, Friday or Saturday, then school started the following Monday. The school year always had 38 weeks of classes with 30 weeks covered by the nationwide unified curriculum.

Since 1951, the learning of the Russian language as the foreign language was obligatory, because of the leading role of the Soviet Union in the Eastern bloc. It was also available in English and French, but only as additional elective foreign languages (Universities required two foreign languages). The Russian lessons focused on the Cyrillic script, the writing, the reading and the grammar of the Russian language. To be able to have a substantial conversation was not an aim, but to be able to use professional and technical Russian literature. The speaking skills should reach a level of sufficient fluency to have a small conversation with a local. There were only few opportunities for student exchanges. Appreciated by parents were the so-called head marks (&quot;Kopfnoten&quot;) which assessed behavior, industriousness, order, and cooperation. These were combined with a short teacher&#x27;s essay about the student&#x27;s character, success or progress, advice for future improvements - here and there from a socialistic point of view.

From the seventh year onwards, students visited a factory, power station or farm one day per week for 4 hours, depending on their location. At some of these places, the student would work alongside regular employees.

There were annual championships on various subjects with the winners receiving prizes. The Russian language and mathematics championships were seen and promoted as very prestigious and competitive as well as regular championships in sport, called Spartakiade (from the word Spartacus).

== Vocational training ==

If a student did not enter into the EOS to take the &quot;Abitur&quot; (similar to the A-level in England) after the 8th year of POS, they applied for vocational training after the 9th year. The result of the 9th year was therefore often more important than the final exam. The contract was then signed during the tenth year, so that after the tenth year of polytechnical school, a student went on to 2 or 3 years (depending on subject) of vocational training. Vocational training was offered for every subject that was not taught at university, such as masonry, farming, accountancy, kindergarten teacher, nurse, mechanics, electricians, carpentry, butchery, etc.

Vocational training was split in practical work and theoretical learning which focused both on the studied subject of career, and ended with a certificate and a formal title.

In the latter part of the apprenticeship the student was integrated into the team where they would work after the apprenticeship. The vocational training could take place in the students home town, but often occurred in another city. Students lived there in an Internat (boarding school). In most cases that was the first time in the young persons life they lived &quot;independent&quot; from their parents&#x27; home for one or two years. The students were allowed to visit home on the weekends.

With a completed apprenticeship the worker/farmer was qualified to have additional training for supervisor (Meister), or technological school (Ingenieurschule). To go to university, Abitur was necessary.

Big companies often trained more apprentices than they could absorb. Because after apprenticeship people went to national service, moved town, went to universities, changed jobs to work closer to home, etc. Hence companies had all age levels from 16-year-olds to seniors, who then trained up the juniors before retiring.

==Universities==

Entrance to East German Universities was very limited. To attend University education in East Germany, one had to attend the &quot;erweiterte Oberschule&quot;. Access to these schools was restricted to the 2-3 best students per POS class. Entry to the EOS was after grade 8 for 4 years. At 18 years of age, every youth either had finished EOS or vocational training. A special form was vocational training with Abitur, which lasted three years after leaving the POS.

East German universities were closely linked to both schools and to industry. The universities selected their own students from the applicants. As the school system was centralized, all school certificates were comparable. No university entry exam was necessary.

Mostly focused on technical education, these universities were highly regarded all over the world to be of a very high standard.

There were two ways to get into a university: either via EOS or via apprenticeship plus abitur. For those who found their calling later in life, there were &quot;Volkshochschulen&quot; (People&#x27;s Colleges) for night classes and a special university preparation course in a boarding school lasting 1 year in an ABF (&quot;Arbeiter- und Bauern Fakultät&quot;; Workers and Farmers College). While everyone could visit the VHS, access to the ABF was restricted to workers and farmers with at least five years of working experience. This was usually organized by the HR department of the company where they worked.

National service was 18 months for males between the age of 18 and 26. Often prospective students were intimidated into serving three years as NCO in order to begin university early.

For popular subjects, such as information technology, or prestigious subjects, such as law or medicine, there were more applicants to university than places. Several criteria were taken into account: school exams, national service time, patriotism, ideology, religious affiliation (better to be atheist than religious), communist party membership, etc. In the mid-1980s, there was an important change: those who wanted to study informatics could have their national service halved to nine months.

== Legacy ==
The state-run education system in the GDR was deeply intertwined with the ideological and political goals of the GDR&#x27;s socialist regime. The system, specifically the crèches and kindergartens for younger children, had two primarily functions. First, they were designed to free mothers from traditional childcare responsibilities during the day, which allowed them to join the workforce and contribute to the state’s economic development. Second, they indoctrinated children with socialist principles. The curriculum emphasized collectivism, discipline, and loyalty to the state, aiming to produce citizens aligned with Marxist-Leninist ideals. The dual purpose of economic productivity and ideological conformity was a cornerstone of the GDR’s vision for a socialist society.

In the long run, the childcare system left a mixed legacy. Scientific studies have found no significant correlation between prolonged separation from family and mental health issues in adulthood. This finding, or lack thereof, suggests that the system did not fundamentally disrupt early development. However, some individuals who grew up in these collectives have reported emotional detachment, weaker family bonds, and a diminished sense of individuality and creativity. These critiques highlight the potential drawbacks of prioritizing ideological and economic goals over personal and familial development. Despite these challenges, the GDR&#x27;s approach to childcare demonstrated the potential for state-supported systems to address gender inequalities in the workforce and in society at-large.

Then fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent reunification of Germany marked many dramatic shifts in public policy, including the dissolution of the childcare collectives. The decade following the fall of the Berlin Wall saw a decline in birth rates and widened disparities in childcare access, particularly for low-income families, as the transition to a capitalist economy reduced the availability of affordable care. In response, twenty-first-century reforms, such as the “Good Day Care Act,” sought to expand and equalize childcare services across Germany. These reforms aimed to balance quality, accessibility, and affordability, building on the GDR’s legacy of comprehensive care. By focusing on equitable support for families, modern policies reflect an evolving understanding of the importance of collective childcare to foster social and economic progress.

<doc id="734706" wikidata="Q572486" url="?curid=734706" title="Kenosis">
<text>In Christian theology, kenosis () is the &quot;self-emptying&quot; of Jesus. The word () is used in the Epistle to the Philippians: &quot; made himself nothing&quot; (NIV), or &quot;[he] emptied himself&quot; (NRSV) (Philippians 2:7), using the verb form (), meaning &quot;to empty&quot;.

The exact meaning varies among theologians. The less controversial meaning is that Jesus emptied his own desires, becoming entirely receptive to God&#x27;s divine will, obedient to the point of death—even death on a cross, and that it encourages Christians to be similarly willing to submit to divine will, even if it comes at great personal cost. The phrase is interpreted by some to explain the human side of Jesus: that Jesus, to truly live as a mortal, had to have voluntarily bound use of his divine powers in some way, emptying himself, and that it says that &quot;though [Jesus] was in the form of God, [he] did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited,&quot; suggesting that Jesus was not &quot;abusing&quot; his divine status to avoid the implications of a mortal life. This interpretation is contested by others, who consider this to overly downplay the divine power of Jesus, for example.

==Etymology and definition==
The term &quot;kenosis&quot; comes from the Greek (), meaning &quot;to empty out&quot;. The Liddell–Scott Greek–English Lexicon gives the following definition simplified for the noun:
# emptying, depletion, emptiness (of life) (Vettius Valens)
# depletion, low diet, as opposed to , fullness (Hippocrates)
# waning (of the moon) (Epicurus)

==New Testament usage==
The New Testament does not use the noun form , but the verb form occurs five times (Romans 4:14; 1 Corinthians 1:17, 9:15; 2 Corinthians 9:3; Philippians 2:7) and the future form once. Of these five times, Philippians 2:7 is generally considered the most significant for the Christian idea of kenosis:
==Christology==
===Kenotic Christology===
Philippians 2 is sometimes used to explain the human side of Jesus&#x27;s existence. In early Christianity, some groups propounded beliefs of a fully human Jesus who was especially honored and raised up by God (adoptionism), while other groups argued for a fully divine Jesus that was more like a spiritual apparition (docetism). The Chalcedonian doctrine that prevailed was that Jesus had a dual nature, and was both fully human and fully God. Kenotic Christology essentially states that in order to truly live a human experience, Jesus, despite being a preexisting divine being, voluntarily humbled himself. He could still perform miracles, heal the sick, and dispense reliable moral doctrine, but was not using divine might to resolve all of his problems as a mortal, and struggled through all the usual human problems. Thus, Jesus needed to sleep and eat; was tempted by the Devil in the wilderness; could become frustrated at fig trees not being in season; stated that no one knows the day or hour of the end of the world; and so on.

Gottfried Thomasius is the first theologian to discuss and expound upon kenotic Christology by name. Other theologians associated with kenotic Christology include P. T. Forsyth, H. R. Mackintosh, Charles Gore, Fisher Humphreys, Donald G. Dawe, and Roger E. Olson.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
Orthodox theology emphasises following the example of Christ. &quot;Kenosis&quot; is only possible through humility and presupposes that one seeks union with God. The Poustinia tradition of the Russian Orthodox Church is one major expression of this search.

&quot;Kenosis&quot; is not only a Christological issue in Orthodox theology, but also relates to Pneumatology, matters of the Holy Spirit. &quot;Kenosis&quot;, relative to the human nature, denotes the continual epiklesis and self-denial of one&#x27;s own human will and desire. With regard to Christ, there is a &quot;kenosis&quot; of the Son of God, a condescension and self-sacrifice for the redemption and salvation of all humanity. Humanity can also participate in God&#x27;s saving work through theosis; becoming holy by grace.

In Eastern Orthodoxy, &quot;kenosis&quot; does not concern becoming like God in essence or being, which is pantheism; instead, it concerns becoming united to God by grace, through his &quot;Energies&quot;. Orthodox theology distinguishes between divine Essence and Energies. &quot;Kenosis&quot; therefore is a paradox and a mystery since &quot;emptying oneself&quot; in fact fills the person with divine grace and results in union with God. &quot;Kenosis&quot; in Orthodox theology is the transcending or detaching of oneself from the world or the passions, it is a component of dispassionation. Much of the earliest debates between the Arian and Orthodox Christians were over &quot;kenosis&quot;. The need for clarification about the human and divine nature of the Christ (see the hypostatic union) were fought over the meaning and example that Christ set, as an example of &quot;kenosis&quot; or &quot;ekkenosis&quot;.

===Catholicism===
Pope Pius XII, in his 1951 , condemned a particular interpretation of Philippians in regards to the &quot;kenosis&quot;:

In John of the Cross&#x27;s thinking, &quot;kenosis&quot; is the concept of the &#x27;self-emptying&#x27; of one&#x27;s own will and becoming entirely receptive to God and the divine will. It is used both as an explanation of the Incarnation, and an indication of the nature of God&#x27;s activity and will. Mystical theologian John of the Cross&#x27; work &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot; is a particularly lucid explanation of God&#x27;s process of transforming the believer into the icon or &quot;likeness of Christ&quot;.

===Unitarianism===
Since some forms of Unitarianism do not accept the personal pre-existence of Christ, their interpretations of Philippians 2:7, and the concept of &quot;kenosis&quot;—Christ &quot;emptying&quot; himself—take as a starting point that his &quot;emptying&quot; occurred in life, and not before birth. However, as Thomas Belsham put it, there are varying views on when in life this emptying occurred. Belsham took this to be at the crucifixion, whereas Joseph Priestley took this to be in the Garden of Gethsemane when Christ did not resist arrest. The Christadelphian Tom Barling considered that the &quot;emptying&quot; of Christ was a continual process which started in the earliest references to Christ&#x27;s character, Luke 2:40,52, and continued through the temptations of Christ and his ministry.

===Gnosticism===
The equivalent to &quot;kenosis&quot; in Gnostic literature is Christ&#x27;s withdrawal of his own luminosity into himself, so as to cease dazzling his own disciples. In the &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;, at the request of his disciples, &quot;Jesus drew to himself the glory of his light&quot;.

==Kenotic ethic==
The kenotic ethic is an interpretation of Philippians 2:7 that takes the passage, where Jesus is described as having &quot;emptied himself&quot;, as not primarily as Paul putting forth a theory about God in this passage, but as using God&#x27;s humility exhibited in the incarnation as a call for Christians to be similarly subservient to others.

<doc id="734707" wikidata="Q7543035" url="?curid=734707" title="Small craft advisory">
<text>A small craft advisory is a type of wind warning issued by the National Weather Service in the United States. In Canada a similar warning is issued by Environment Canada. It is issued when winds have reached, or are expected to reach within 12 hours, a speed marginally less than gale force. A Small Craft Advisory may also be issued when sea or lake ice exists that could be hazardous to small boats.

The insignia that denotes a small craft advisory is one red, triangular flag (two such flags, one placed above the other, signify a gale warning).

Inland, this advisory is known as a wind advisory. A lake wind advisory is issued for winds just below this range, because unobstructed winds across the open waters of a lake are normally faster than across land.

The wind speed that triggers the advisory has changed over time. Until the late 1960s, the threshold was 32 to 38 miles per hour (or 28 to 33 knots). At some point, the lower limit was reduced to 23 miles per hour (20 knots). Today, however, most places have standardized on 25 to 38 miles per hour (22 to 33 knots), encompassing the combined ranges of forces 6 and 7 on the Beaufort scale. Winds strong enough to trigger a small craft advisory may be referred to as being &quot;advisory-force&quot;. Conversely, winds just above this intensity (39–57 miles per hour) are called &quot;gale-force&quot;, and have a separate associated warning.

Occasionally an informal lesser advisory, known as &quot;small craft exercise caution&quot;, is issued for wind speeds lighter than those that call for a small craft advisory. Criteria for this vary in different localities: sometimes a range of 19 to 24 miles per hour (17 to 21 knots) is observed, or in some places 17 to 23 miles per hour (15 to 19 knots) may be used.

The National Weather Service does not specifically identify what constitutes a &quot;small craft&quot;. The size of the boat is only part of what a person should consider when venturing out under such a warning. Weight, displacement and hull design are also important factors and an even more important consideration is not only the craft, but the experience of the captain.

The next step above these advisories is a gale warning, known as a high wind warning when issued for inland locations. If the winds are associated with a tropical cyclone, then the next level above a small craft or wind advisory is a tropical storm warning. Occasionally, such bulletins may also be issued for areas above a particular elevation, as wind speeds tend to increase with altitude in the mountains.

==Coastal Warning Display program==
As of 15 February 1989, the National Weather Service retired its Coastal Warning Display network nationwide.

For over 100 years, display stations were established at yacht clubs, marinas, and Coast Guard stations to hoist flags, pennants and colored lights to warn mariners of storms at sea. The display stations were individually notified by the National Weather Service to raise the signals and again to lower them when the hazards passed. The National Weather Service paid for the visual signals; however, the display stations were operated by other agencies or volunteers. Although the Coastal Warning Display program has been formally discontinued, U.S. Coast Guard and other stations may continue to display warning signals without the direct participation of the National Weather Service.

Beginning 1 June 2007, U.S. Coast Guard formally re-established a Coastal Warning Display program at selected small boat stations which will hoist display flags to warn of small craft advisories, gale warnings, tropical storm warnings, storm warnings, hurricane warnings, and hurricane-force wind warnings.

The Coastal Warning Display program was de-emphasized in favor of frequently updated telephone recordings and NOAA Weather Radio. The latter covers the coastal areas of continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and the Mariana Islands with continuous weather broadcasts. The major shortcomings of the Coastal Warning Display program were that the displays reached only the small portion of the marine public within sight of them; it cannot convey specific information on movement, intensity, and duration; and the time required to notify the sites by individual telephone calls takes the forecaster away from critical tasks associated with the weather. Further, when users perceive them to be a full substitute for NOAA Weather Radio, other radio broadcasts, and the telephone recordings, they are actually being a disservice.

==Canada==
A similar warning, known as a &quot;Strong Wind Warning&quot;, is issued by Environment Canada&#x27;s Meteorological Service of Canada from its different offices for the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic waters. These warnings are coordinated for the Great Lakes region with American neighboring offices.

&quot;Strong Wind Warning&quot; was previously referred to as &quot;Small Craft Warning&quot; and is still (2012) referred to as such in many publications. A Strong Wind Warning is issued for winds in the range 20–33 knots and wave heights 2–3 metres.

<doc id="734708" wikidata="Q6494210" url="?curid=734708" title="Last Chance Saloon">
<text>Last Chance Saloon was a popular name of a type of bar in the United States that began to appear in the 19th century as an early expression of border economics. Saloons situated near areas where alcohol was not easily obtainable frequently took the name as a literal indication to customers that this was their final opportunity to imbibe before progressing to an area where obtaining, selling or drinking alcoholic drinks was prohibited. The phrase &quot;last chance saloon&quot; also has common British metaphorical use, based upon this historical context.

==A lot of &quot;last chances&quot;==
While the term refers to actual places that existed, it does not refer to a &quot;singular&quot; place. Many saloons on the border of dry areas incorporated the phrase &quot;last chance&quot; into their name. Of the many saloons so named, two have found particular notoriety, to the extent that they may be sometimes be referred to today with a definite article, as in &quot;&quot;The&quot; Last Chance Saloon&quot;.

The first is one in Caldwell, Kansas. Dating from 1869, it was the last place travellers could legally buy liquor before moving into Indian territory, where alcohol was banned. It gained prominence during an incident in 1874, when a posse from Caldwell burned down the building, after erroneously believing that the objects of their search were inside. Because of this fire, it does not exist today, but the building&#x27;s site is currently marked by the State of Kansas as a place of historical interest.

The second is the &quot;Heinold&#x27;s First and Last Chance&quot; in Oakland, California. It was opened in 1883. Located on the docks of Oakland, it would have been the last chance for drinkers to imbibe before falling under the jurisdiction of their boat&#x27;s captain. While it was not a &quot;legally&quot; dry area, a boat could often be &quot;practically&quot; dry. Even if a captain chose to allow alcohol, it would have been relatively scarce and usually tightly regulated—if the boat&#x27;s hold had space for it at all. Thus, Heinold&#x27;s saloon served precisely the same practical function as the Caldwell example. It was made arguably more famous because noted American author Jack London was an irregular patron. When in Oakland, London drank there often, gleaning insight from the tales of world-traveling sailors. Not only is the saloon commemorated by name in London&#x27;s works, it is recognized by the California State historical marker program, the National Literary Landmark scheme, and the National Register of Historic Places. Nevertheless, it continues as a working business, maintained privately for the benefit of locals and tourists.

Technically, both of these businesses were also signed as &quot;First Chance&quot; saloons, as the proprietors wanted to market their business for travellers, irrespective of their customers&#x27; direction of travel.

The name persists in the naming of modern bars, though it is not always associated with the original meaning. Bars nowhere close to a dry county are sometimes named &quot;Last Chance Saloon&quot; as an homage to the earlier establishments. There are (First and) Last Chance Saloons in the phone books of almost every American state.

==As a metaphor==

In everyday speech, by speakers of British English, the term has been adopted to describe a situation beyond which hope or good fortune will greatly diminish.

Because of its infrequent use in relation to alcohol or bars, &quot;last chance saloon&quot; is usually employed as a paralogical metaphor.

The expression often lends itself to newspaper headlines, as it describes a complex situation in a relatively scant number of letters. Home Office minister David Mellor in a December 1989 television interview asserted: &quot;I do believe the press – the popular press – is drinking in the Last Chance Saloon&quot;. The ethics of the British press were then being scrutinized by the Calcutt Committee and the phrase caught on. In another example, John Major&#x27;s 1995 attempt to stave off critics by calling for a Conservative Party leadership election was famously headlined in &quot;The Independent&quot; as &quot;John Major&#x27;s Last Chance Saloon&quot;—but there are many others.

===British automotive journalism===
A subset of the general use for the term is its use among British automotive journalists. Because saloon has a uniquely British automotive meaning, applying the phrase &quot;last chance saloon&quot; to a story about cars is to use a pun. Thus, it is common to see the phrase applied to the automotive industry. For example, the launch of the Rover 75 was humorously described by the then BMW owners as &quot;Rover&#x27;s Last Chance Saloon&quot;, and Cerberus&#x27; 2007 acquisition of Chrysler has been called &quot;that&quot; car manufacturer&#x27;s &quot;last chance saloon&quot;.

===British sports journalism===
The phrase has a specialized use in British sport. In youth sport, it specifically defines a qualifying round of competition—the &quot;Last Chance Saloon Round&quot; — comprising students from schools who don&#x27;t have a mechanism in place to determine a winner at the local level. Because a Last Chance Saloon Round does not connote anything substandard about a participants&#x27; skills, but merely the way in which their school participates in regional tournaments, this usage is slightly different from how it is used in Britain to describe professional sport. Sports commentators and fans will often use the phrase in conjunction with professional or Olympic athletics to speak of a waning team or player&#x27;s last opportunity to make good on their talents.

==In popular culture==
===Literature===
*Irish author Marian Keyes released a novel called &quot;Last Chance Saloon&quot;, which saw its first US printing in 2001. Set in London, it was the story of several thirty-somethings who reach a point of decision in their personal lives. The novel was well-received, earning a place on Amazon.com&#x27;s &quot;Best of 2001&quot; list.

===Music===
*The Bluetones released an album in 1998 entitled &quot;Return to the Last Chance Saloon&quot;.
*Climax Blues Band song named &quot;The Last Chance Saloon&quot; from their album, &quot;Lucky for Some&quot;

===Television and film===
*In &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the fictitious Last Chance Saloon in Tombstone, Arizona was the focus of the First Doctor serial, &quot;The Gunfighters&quot; (1966). It is there that the Clanton brothers hang out for most of the story, ready to shoot either The Doctor (mistaken for Doc Holliday) or Steven or Dodo. &quot;The Ballad of the Last Chance Saloon&quot; is the musical piece that is heard at various places through the serial, underscoring the threat and humour of the story. However, the sale of alcohol wasn&#x27;t restricted anywhere close to Tombstone, and indeed the area&#x27;s booming mining economy at the time of &quot;The Gunfighters&quot;, made saloons a vital part of the economy. Two of the first saloons in Tombstone were the Crystal Palace and the Oriental, and they provide an interesting template on which to judge the accuracy of the &quot;Gunfighters&quot; saloon. In the serial, music is shown as being provided by a stand-up piano and a single, female singer of dubious repute. In reality, the Oriental and Crystal Palace (along with the approximately 50 &quot;other&quot; saloons in business at the time of &quot;Gunfighters&quot;) were styled after more staid British saloons, providing patrons with classical music, rendered by the city&#x27;s brass band or visiting chamber artists. Saloons in prosperous Tombstone were further more or less restricted to men only, and were also casinos. Thus, as with other historical details surrounding &quot;The Gunfighters&quot;, writer Donald Cotton was far off the historical mark with his &quot;Last Chance Saloon&quot;.
*In &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, the Last Chance Saloon was the saloon in Kryten&#x27;s subconscious when he was battling the Armageddon virus in the series 6 episode &quot;Gunmen of the Apocalypse&quot;.
*In &quot;Xiaolin Showdown&quot;, the Last Chance Saloon is where the monks fight a live painting of a cowboy.
