==History==
Habitation in the area around Prešov dates as far back as the Paleolithic period. The oldest discovered tools and mammoth bones are 28,000 years old. Continuous settlement dates back to the 8th century.

After the Mongol invasion in 1241, King Béla IV of Hungary invited German colonists to fill the gaps in population. Prešov became a German-speaking settlement, related to the Zipser German and Carpathian German areas, and was elevated to the rank of a royal free town in 1347 by Louis the Great.

In 1412, Prešov helped to create the Pentapolitana, the league of five towns, a trading group. The first record of a school dates from 1429. After the collapse of the old Kingdom of Hungary after the Ottoman invasion of 1526, Prešov became a border city and changed hands several times between two usually rivalrous domains, Habsburg Royal Hungary and Hungarian states normally backed by the Ottomans: the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom, the Principality of Transylvania, and the Principality of Upper Hungary.

Still, Prešov went through an economic boom thanks to trade with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In the 16th century it brought in grape vines from the nearby Tokaj wine region, and was home to German-Hungarian, Polish and Greek wine merchants. Some of the first books on Tokaj wine were written in German in Prešov.

In 1572, salt mining began in Solivar (at that time a nearby town, now a part of Prešov).

Antun Vrančić, a Croatian prelate, writer, diplomat and Archbishop of Esztergom, died in Prešov in 1573.

Prešov was prominent in the Protestant Reformation. It was at the front line in the 1604–1606 Bocskai uprising, when Imperial Army commander Giorgio Basta retreated to the town after failing to take Košice from the Protestant rebels.

In 1647 the Habsburgs designated it the capital of Sáros county. In late January 1657, Transylvanian Prince George II Rákóczi, a Protestant, invaded Poland with army of some 25,000 which crossed the Carpathians on the road from Prešov to Krosno.

Wolfgang Schustel, a Lutheran reformer during the Reformation, who adopted an uncompromising position on public piety worked in Prešov and other towns. In 1667, the important Evangelical Lutheran College of Eperjes was established by Lutherans in the town.

Imre Thököly, the Protestant Hungarian rebel and Ottoman ally studied at the Protestant college here. In 1685 he was defeated here by the Habsburg at the Battle of Eperjes. In 1687 twenty-four prominent citizens and noblemen were executed, under a tribunal instituted by the Austrian general Antonio Caraffa, for supporting the uprising of Imre Thököly:

At the beginning of the 18th century, the population was decimated by the Bubonic plague and fires and was reduced to a mere 2,000 inhabitants. By the second half of the century, however, the town had recovered; crafts and trade improved, and new factories were built. In 1752 the salt mine in Solivar was flooded. Since then salt has been extracted from salt brine through boiling.

The English author John Paget visited Prešov and describes it in his 1839 book &quot;Hungary and Transylvania&quot;. In 1870 the first railway line was built, connecting the town to Košice. At the end of the 19th century, the town introduced electricity, telephone, telegraph and sewage systems. In 1887, fire destroyed a large part of the town.

In 1918, Czechoslovak troops began occupying eastern Slovakia, along with Prešov. On 16 June 1919, Hungarian troops entered the city and the very brief Slovak Soviet Republic was declared here with the support of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. The short-lived republic collapsed in 7 July 1919 and Czechoslovak troops re-entered Prešov. In 1920, after the Treaty of Trianon, Prešov definitively became part of the newly created Czechoslovakia. During World War II, the nearby town of Košice again became part of the Kingdom of Hungary as a result of the First Vienna Award. As a result, many institutions moved from Košice to Prešov, thus increasing the town&#x27;s importance. In 1944, a professional Slovak Theatre was established in Prešov. The city is a site in the Holocaust:

About two thousand Jews were deported from Prešov to the Dęblin–Irena Ghetto in May 1942. Only a few dozen survived.

On 19 January 1945 Prešov was taken by Soviet troops of the 1st Guards Army. After 1948, during the Communist era in Czechoslovakia, Prešov became an industrial center. Due to World War II, Prešov lost the majority of its Jewish population. Nonetheless, population of the city increased rapidly from 28,000 in 1950 to 52,000 in 1970 and 89,000 in 1990.

=== The highest representatives of the city ===
By granting city privileges in 1299, the people of Prešov gained the right to elect their vogt. Such a vogt embodied the highest executive and judicial power in the city. He was elected among the esteemed burghers, usually for one year. The first vogt in the city of Prešov, whose name has been preserved, was Hanus called Ogh, who is mentioned in historical sources as early as 1314. However, historians have not been able to complete the complete list of all the vogts of Prešov until from 1497. For the first time, a woman became the highest representative of Prešov in 2014, when Andrea Turčanová became the winner of the election. In the elections of 2018, she strengthened her position and won the elections to the mayor of Prešov.

== Military ==
Prešov already had an important geographical position in the Middle Ages, because it was located at the crossroads of trade routes and also belonged to the important defense system of the emerging Hungarian state. The beginnings of the army in Prešov date back to this area, as Hungarian tribes and their allies, which were military-guard groups of Asian ethnic groups, came to these areas to establish guard settlements and fortresses to defend the emerging Kingdom of Hungary from enemy attacks. To this day, the names of the nearby hills Veľká and Lysá stráž have been preserved.

The city had its own garrison probably since 1374, when it was given the right to build defensive walls with bastions and towers by King Louis I. The importance of the military garrison certainly increased because the city of Prešov became a free royal town in the 14th century. At the end of the 16th century, during the 15-year war with Turkey, the city had to sustain a large imperial army. From 1604, when the first of a number of anti-Habsburg uprisings of the Hungarian estates broke out, until 1710, when the city capitulated to a strong Habsburg army, Prešov was besieged many times by various insurgent troops, even by imperial troops. For example: Bocskai uprising, General Bast&#x27;s troops, George I Rákóczi&#x27;s insurgents, Veshelini&#x27;s conspiracy, Kuruk&#x27;s insurgents, Tököli&#x27;s uprising, General Caraffa&#x27;s Prešov slaughterhouses and the insurgents led by Francis II Rákóczi. Prešov then flourished until 1848, because it did not experience any war.

The revolutionary years of 1848–49 pulled not only the free royal city of Prešov, but the whole country into the whirlwind of events. Due to its strategic location, Prešov experienced several changes of military forces during this period. For example, General Schlick&#x27;s imperial army was replaced by Görgey&#x27;s Hungarian army, which was soon replaced by Austrian and Slovak volunteer units, which in turn were replaced by imperial soldiers together with the Russian army. The fact that the military importance of Prešov continued to grow is also evidenced by the data from the census of 1900, when out of 14,447 inhabitants of Prešov there were up to 1,349 soldiers. The local military garrison consisted of several units of the joint army and militia, the largest of which was the 67th Imperial and Royal Infantry Regiment. The hardships of World War I and especially its end tragically affected the life of Prešov, because on 1 November 1918, under the influence of the revolution in Budapest, soldiers of the 67th Regiment and some other smaller units in Prešov refused to obey their commanders and looted some shops in Prešov. After the arrival of military reinforcements, the insurgents were arrested and despite the fact that there were no casualties during the riots, the statistical court sentenced the participants in the uprising to death. On the same day, 1 November 1918, 41 soldiers and 2 civilians were executed in the square. This event is also known as the Prešov Uprising (&quot;Prešovská vzbura&quot;). The bombing of the city on 20 December 1944, was also devastating for the city of Prešov.

From 4 July 1945, shortly after the end of World War II, military units in the territory of Czechoslovakia were reorganized according to the model of the Red Army. Since then, the following military headquarters have been located in the city of Prešov: infantry regiment headquarters, rifle division headquarters, tank division headquarters, motorized rifle division headquarters, mechanized division headquarters, army corps headquarters, and mechanized brigade headquarters.

From 1918 to 2019, these soldiers, who were born in Prešov, brigadier general František Bartko, major general Vojtech Gejza Danielovič, lieutenant general Alexander Mucha, brigadier general Ing. Karol Navrátil, brigadier general Ing. Ivan Pach, major general Emil Perko, major general Jozef Zadžora.

Before World War II Prešov was home for a large Jewish population of 4,300 and housed a major Jewish museum. During 1939 and 1940 the Jewish community absorbed a flow of Jewish refugees from German Nazi-occupied Poland, and in 1941 additional deportees from Bratislava. In 1942 a series of deportations of Prešov&#x27;s Jews to the German Nazi death camps in Poland began. Plaques in the town hall and a memorial in the surviving synagogue record that 6,400 Jews were deported from the town under the Tiso government of the First Slovak Republic.

=== Music ===
Thanks to the lively musical life and the success of Prešov&#x27;s music production, the city of Prešov has earned the nickname &quot;Slovak Seattle&quot; or &quot;City of Music&quot; long ago, mainly through the media. However, many musicians from Prešov work not only within their hometown or region, but also reap success in the whole of Slovakia, neighboring countries or even Europe.

However, not only the number of mainstream successful musicians contributed to the musical life of the city, in the past and today, but also more or less (un)known groups and musical subcultures, steadily operating in the city foothills (genres: metal, punk, alternative, hip-hop, R&amp;B, gospel, rock, pop-rock, folk, jazz, country, and possibly others), concert rooms and clubs (Véčko, Bizarre, Christiania, City Club, Stromoradie, Za siedmimi oknami, Wave, Ester rock club, Netopier, Staré Mexiko, Insomnia, Ponorka, ENCORE), rock shows of bands with a long tradition (Rocková liga, vyše 20. ročníkov, Prešovský študentský Liverpool, 6. ročníkov, Rebrík) but also festivals (Sigortus, Dobrý festival, (t)urbanfest, ImROCK FEST, East Side Music Festival, Festival zlej hudby, Farfest, Jazz Prešov).

Important events include the Dni mesta Prešov (&quot;Days of the City of Prešov&quot;), which are held annually on the occasion of the celebrations of the first written mention of the city (as of 2021, 774th anniversary). The celebrations usually include open-air concerts right in the center on Hlavná street, whereas several guests from the domestic and European alternative scene took turns throughout the years. That includes: Deti Picasso (Russia), Myster Möbius (France/Hungary), Masfél (Hungary), Prague Selection II.; Laura a její tygři (Czech Republic), Srečna Mladina (Slovenia), Squartet (Italy), but also Slovak groups Heľenine Oči, Chiki liki tu-a, Arzén, Mango Molas, Alter Ego, Kapátske chrbáty a Komajota.

Part of the city&#x27;s celebrations are also side stages, where young bands can also try their luck.

In 2009, the first Prešov film festival, Bastion film festival, was established. The festival takes place on the historic wall behind the Franciscan Church. The organizers are PKO Prešov and Prešov composer and guitarist David Kollar.

After many years, the constant influx and modification of music groups, which are often enforced throughout Slovakia, required documentation, which took place through the internet database of Prešov bands and performers under the name Frenky&#x27;s Music Encyclopedia. Historically and currently, the ever-growing database of Prešov musicians is run by Michal Frank, a journalist and editor-in-chief of the Prešov Korzár.

==== History of public transport ====
The history of public transport in Prešov began in 1949, when Local Transport was established, a municipal enterprise of the city of Prešov as the operator of regular public transport in the territory of Prešov. After the end of World War II, it was not possible to start public transport with a new vehicle fleet, so an offer was accepted for the purchase of older Tatra vehicles from public transport facilities in Prague, Plzeň and Bratislava. The vehicles were initially parked in the courtyard of the old prison on Konštantínova street, where the company was also located.

On 4 September 1949, the traffic on the first lines was ceremoniously opened. Already in the first year of operation, the Prešov public transport buses went beyond the city limits to the municipalities of Šarišské Lúky, Nižná Šebastová, Haniska and Solivar. The following year, the development of public transport continued with the introduction of additional bus lines. The state hospital, Záhrady, Sídlisko II, Budovateľská and Čapajevova street were all gradually connected to the public transport network in the 1950s, as well as other municipalities: the town of Veľký Šariš and its part Kanaš, Malý Šariš, Ľubotice, Fintice, Teriakovce and Záborské.

In 1959, the first night line began operating and the company was located on its own premises on Petrovanská street, where it moved in 1951. In 1958, when the construction of the trolleybus network in the city was approved, brought a new stage in the development of urban transport. All high-capacity intra-city lines were to be electrified, while bus transport was to remain ancillary. Line 1 was the first to be electrified, which led from Nižná Šebastová through Šarišské Lúky to Solivar. Although its construction was delayed by several technical problems, on 13 May 1962, passengers got to experience trolleybuses. A new depot for trolleybuses and buses was completed in Šarišské Lúky, where the entire vehicle fleet as well as the company&#x27;s administration moved. Work on other sections soon began, so in 1966 trolleybuses were already running on Košická, Sabinovská and Budovateľská streets. and Gottwald today 17 Novembra Street.

In the first half of the 1970s, the track along Sabinovská street was extended to Dúbrava and trolleybuses also began to serve industrial Širpo. Other projects of lines to Sídlisko III, Šváby, Haniska and Delňa could no longer be carried out. Under the influence of cheap oil, buses also began to gain ground in Prešov. Bus transport recorded a quantitative development, when buses also started to run to Táborisko, Šidlovec, Cemjata, Pod Kamennou baňou street and Sídlisko III. In terms of quality, however, this mode of transport has struggled with constant difficulties such as the lack of vehicles, their low capacity and breakdown. These shortcomings were not gradually overcome until the late 1970s. Nevertheless, due to the non-construction of the trolleybus line to Sídlisko III, the service of which was crucial at that time, the buses fully prevailed.

The period of the turn of the 1970s and 1980s, when the possibilities of public transport were significantly limited by the lack of fuel, pointed to the suitability of trolleybus transport. Following a review at government level, the electrification program was re-launched. Sídlisko III was the first to be connected to the trolleybus transport network in 1985. Trolleybuses achieved a majority share in public transport in the city of Prešov after 1992, when trolleybus transport was introduced to the largest housing estate Sekčov. The issue of the tariff in Prešov has always been characterized by an ever-changing number of tariff bands, on the basis of which the rates for individual journeys were set. In 1949, there were three fare zones, and it was possible to change to another vehicle on one ticket. In 1969, single-ticket transfers were canceled and the number of bands was reduced to two. Since 1984, the government&#x27;s acreage has simplified the tariff and there has been no division of the network into bands.

Different fares for travel to neighboring municipalities were reintroduced in 1993 and existed until 1996. Special rates also applied in 1997 – 99 and again in 2000. Tickets were originally bought from the guide directly in the vehicle, later sold by the driver, respectively a ticketing machine was installed in the vehicle. In 1977, the sale of tickets outside the vehicle was introduced. Since 1995, it is again possible to buy a ticket from the driver, but at an increased price. Public transport is improved by the gradual renewal of the vehicle fleet, focused on low-floor vehicles, the introduction of computer technology into traffic management as well as the reconstruction of track sections of the trolleybus track and overhauls of vehicles. In the future, it is planned to expand ecological trolleybus transport to the Šváby housing estate and the second connection of the city center and the Sekčov housing estate along Rusínská Street.

<text>Gillette is an American brand of safety razors and other personal care products including shaving supplies, owned by the multi-national corporation Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G). Based in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, it was owned by The Gillette Company, a supplier of products under various brands until that company merged into P&amp;G in 2005. The Gillette Company was founded by King C. Gillette in 1901 as a safety razor manufacturer.

Under the leadership of Colman M. Mockler Jr. as CEO from 1975 to 1991, the company was the target of multiple takeover attempts from Ronald Perelman and Coniston Partners. In January 2005, Procter &amp; Gamble announced plans to merge with the Gillette Company.

The Gillette Company&#x27;s assets were incorporated into a P&amp;G unit known internally as &quot;Global Gillette&quot;. In July 2007, Global Gillette was dissolved and incorporated into Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s other two main divisions, Procter &amp; Gamble Beauty and Procter &amp; Gamble Household Care. Gillette&#x27;s brands and products were divided between the two accordingly. The Gillette R&amp;D center in Boston, Massachusetts, and the Gillette South Boston Manufacturing Center (known as &quot;Gillette World Shaving Headquarters&quot;), still exist as functional working locations under the Procter &amp; Gamble-owned Gillette brand name. Gillette&#x27;s subsidiaries Braun and Oral-B, among others, have also been retained by P&amp;G.

== History ==
=== Inception and early years ===
The Gillette company and brand originate from the late 19th century when salesman and inventor King Camp Gillette came up with the idea of a safety razor that used disposable blades. Safety razors at the time were essentially short pieces of a straight razor clamped to a holder. The blade had to be stropped before each shave and after a time needed to be honed by a cutler. Gillette&#x27;s invention was inspired by his mentor at Crown Cork &amp; Seal Company, William Painter, who had invented the Crown cork. Painter encouraged Gillette to come up with something that, like the Crown cork, could be thrown away once used.

While Gillette came up with the idea in 1895, developing the concept into a working model and drawings that could be submitted to the Patent Office took six years. Gillette had trouble finding anyone capable of developing a method to manufacture blades from thin sheet steel, but finally found William Emery Nickerson, an MIT graduate with a degree in chemistry. Gillette and other members of the project founded The American Safety Razor Company on September 28, 1901. The company had issues getting funding until Gillette&#x27;s old friend John Joyce invested the necessary amount for the company to begin manufacturing. Production began slowly in 1903, but the following year Nickerson succeeded in building a new blade grinding machine to relieve bottlenecked production. During its first year of operation, the company had sold 51 razors and 168 blades, but the second year saw sales rise to 90,884 razors and 123,648 blades. The company was renamed to the Gillette Safety Razor Company in 1904 and it quickly began to expand outside the United States. In 1905 the company opened a sales office in London and a blade manufacturing plant in Paris, and by 1906 Gillette had a blade plant in Canada, a sales operation in Mexico, and a European distribution network that sold in many nations, including Russia.

=== First World War and the 1920s ===

Due to its premium pricing strategy, the Gillette Safety Razor Company&#x27;s razor and blade unit sales grew at a modest pace from 1908 to 1916. Disposable razor blades still were not a true mass-market product, and and self-shaving with a straight razor were still popular methods of grooming. Among the general U.S. population, a two-day stubble was not uncommon. This changed once the United States declared war on the Central Powers in 1917; military regulations required every soldier to provide their own shaving kit, and Gillette&#x27;s compact kit with disposable blades outsold competitors whose razors required stropping. Gillette marketed their razor by designing a military-only case decorated with U.S. Army and Navy insignia and in 1917 the company sold 1.1 million razors.
In 1918, the U.S. military began issuing Gillette shaving kits to every U.S. serviceman. Gillette&#x27;s sales rose to 3.5 million razors and 32 million blades. As a consequence, millions of servicemen got accustomed to daily shaving using Gillette&#x27;s razor. After the war, Gillette utilized this in their domestic marketing and used advertising to reinforce the habit acquired during the war.

Gillette&#x27;s original razor patent was due to expire in November 1921 and to stay ahead of an upcoming competition, the company introduced the New Improved Gillette Safety Razor in spring 1921 and switched to the razor and blades pricing structure the company is known for today. While the New Improved razor was sold for $5 () – the selling price of the previous razor – the original razor was renamed to the Old Type and sold in inexpensive packaging as &quot;Brownies&quot; for $1 (). While some Old Type models were still sold in various kinds of packaging for an average price of $3.50, the Brownie razors made a Gillette much more affordable for the average person and expanded the company&#x27;s blade market significantly. From 1917 to 1925, Gillette&#x27;s unit sales increased tenfold. The company also expanded its overseas operations right after the war by opening a manufacturing plant in Slough, near London, to build New Improved razors, and setting up dozens of offices and subsidiaries in Europe and other parts of the world.

Gillette experienced a setback at the end of the 1920s as its competitor AutoStrop sued for patent infringement. The case was settled out of court with Gillette agreeing to buy out AutoStrop for 310,000 non-voting shares. However, before the deal went through, it was revealed in an audit that Gillette had been overstating its sales and profits by $12 million over a five-year period and giving bonuses to its executives based on these numbers. AutoStrop still agreed to the buyout but instead demanded a large amount of preferred stock with voting rights. The merger was announced on October 16, 1930, and gave AutoStrop&#x27;s owner Henry Gaisman controlling interest in Gillette.

=== 1930s and the Second World War ===

The Great Depression weakened Gillette&#x27;s position in the market significantly. The company had fallen behind its competitors in blade manufacturing technology in the 1920s and had let quality control slip while over-stretching its production equipment in order to hurry a new Kroman razor and stainless steel blade to market in 1930. In 1932, Gillette apologized for the reduction in blade quality, withdrew the Kroman blade, and introduced the Blue Blade (initially called the Blue Super Blade) as its replacement. Other Gillette introductions during the Depression years were the Brushless Shaving Cream and an electric shaver that was soon discontinued due to modest sales.

In 1938 Gillette introduced the Thin Blade, which was cheaper and about half the weight of the Blue Blade, even though it cost almost as much to manufacture. The Thin Blade became more popular than the Blue Blade for several years during the Second World War due to high demand of low-cost products and the shortage of carbon steel. Beginning in 1939, Gillette began investing significant amounts on advertising in sports events after its advertising in the World Series increased sales more than double the company had expected. It eventually sponsored a radio program, the &quot;Gillette Cavalcade of Sports&quot;, which would move to television as well as that medium expanded in the late 1940s. While the &quot;Cavalcade&quot; aired many of the notable sporting events of the time (the Kentucky Derby, college football bowl games, and baseball, amongst others) it became most famous for its professional boxing broadcasts.

Though competition hit Gillette hard in the domestic market during the Great Depression, overseas operations helped keep the company afloat. In 1935 more than half of Gillette&#x27;s earnings came from foreign operations and in 1938 – the worst of the Depression years for Gillette, with a mere 18 percent market share – nearly all of the company&#x27;s $2.9 million earnings came from outside the United States. AutoStrop&#x27;s Brazilian factory allowed Gillette to start expanding into the Latin America. In England the Gillette and AutoStrop operations were combined under the Gillette name, where the company built a new blade manufacturing plant in London. In 1937, Gillette&#x27;s Berlin factory produced 40 percent of Germany&#x27;s 900 million blades and retained a 65 to 75 percent share of the German blade market.

The Second World War reduced Gillette&#x27;s blade production both domestically and internationally. As a result of the war, many markets were closed off, German and Japanese forces expropriated the company&#x27;s plants and property, and Gillette&#x27;s plants in Boston and London were partially converted for weapons production. In 1942, the War Production Board ordered Gillette to dedicate its entire razor production and most blade production to the U.S. military. By the end of the war, servicemen had been issued 12.5 million razors and 1.5 billion blades. Gillette also assisted the U.S. Army in military intelligence by producing copies of German razor blades for secret agents venturing behind German lines so that their identities wouldn&#x27;t be compromised by their shaving equipment. The company also manufactured razors that concealed money and escape maps in their handles, and magnetic double-edge blades that prisoners of war could use as a compass.

=== Recovery from the war and diversification ===

During the post-war years, Gillette began to quickly ramp up production by modernizing its major manufacturing plants in the United States and England, expanding the capacity of several foreign plants, and re-opening plants closed during the war. The company opened a new plant in Switzerland and began manufacturing blades in Mexico City. Sales rose to $50 million in 1946 and in 1947 Gillette sold a billion blades. By 1950, Gillette&#x27;s share of the U.S. blade market had climbed to 50 percent. During the 1950s, the company updated and in some cases moved some of its older European factories: the Paris factory, for example, was moved to Annecy.

In 1947 Gillette introduced the Gillette Super Speed razor and along with it the Speed-pak blade dispenser the company had developed during the war. The dispenser allowed the blade to be slid out of the dispenser into the razor without danger of touching the sharp edge. It also had a compartment for holding used blades.

In 1948 Gillette bought the home permanent kit manufacturer The Toni Company and later expanded into other feminine products such as shampoos and hair sprays. In 1955 the company bought the ballpoint pen manufacturer Paper Mate and in 1960 they introduced Right Guard aerosol deodorant. Gillette bought the disposable hospital supplies manufacturer Sterilon Corporation in 1962.

Television advertising played a big part in Gillette&#x27;s post-war growth in the United States. The company began TV advertising in 1944 and in 1950 it spent $6 million to acquire exclusive sponsorship rights to the World Series for six years. By the mid-1950s, 85 percent of Gillette&#x27;s advertising budget was used for television advertising. The company also advertised the Toni product line by sponsoring the TV show Arthur Godfrey and His Friends and the 1958 Miss America contest and its winner.

Although Gillette&#x27;s immediate priority after the war was satisfying U.S. demand and later diversifying its domestic business, the company pursued expansion in foreign markets that showed potential for growth, such as Latin America and Asia. However, the Cold War restricted Gillette&#x27;s operations in many parts of the world and closed entire markets the company would have otherwise entered in Russia, China, Eastern Europe, Near East, Cuba, and parts of Asia. More and more countries demanded local ownership for foreign enterprise in exchange for continued operation or entry into their markets. Outside the U.S. and European markets, Gillette spent time and money building manufacturing facilities and distribution networks in anticipation that the markets would eventually be opened up and nationalistic restrictions lifted. Some of Gillette&#x27;s joint ventures included a 40 percent Gillette 60 percent Malaysian mini-plant operation that began production in 1970, and an Iranian manufacturing plant with 51 percent government ownership. The Iran plant was one of Gillette&#x27;s largest and most modern factories until the Iranian Revolution of 1979 when Ayatollah Khomeini rose into power and American businesses were targeted as enemies of the new government, forcing Gillette to abandon the operation and withdraw from the country.

=== Super Blue and the Wilkinson shock ===

In 1960, Gillette introduced the Super Blue blade, the company&#x27;s first coated blade, and the first significantly improved razor blade since the Blue Blade of the 1930s. The new blade was coated with silicone and in Gillette&#x27;s laboratory testing produced much more comfortable and close shaves by reducing the blade&#x27;s adhesion to whiskers. Super Blue was a success and sold more than the Blue Blade and Thin Blade combined. By the end of 1961, Gillette&#x27;s double edge blade market share had risen to 90 percent and the company held a total razor blade market share of 70 percent.

In 1962, roughly two years after the introduction of the Super Blue blade, Wilkinson Sword introduced a coated razor blade made from stainless steel. According to users, the blade stayed sharp about three times longer than the best carbon steel blades – including Gillette&#x27;s. Wilkinson&#x27;s introduction took Gillette by surprise and the company struggled to respond as its smaller rivals, Schick and the American Safety Razor Company, came out with their own stainless steel blade. However, during the development of the silicon coating for the Super Blue blade, Gillette had also discovered the method of producing coated stainless steel blades that Wilkinson Sword was using and managed to patent it before Wilkinson did. The English company ended up having to pay royalties to Gillette for the stainless steel blades it brought to market.

Gillette hesitated in bringing its own stainless steel blades to market as Super Blue had been a huge success and replacing it with a longer-lasting blade would have reduced profits. The company had originally planned to enjoy high profits from the Super Blue while developing a better stainless steel alloy. Gillette eventually brought the Gillette Stainless blade to market in August 1963, about a year after Wilkinson&#x27;s stainless blades. As a result of the affair, Gillette&#x27;s share of the double-edge blade market dropped from 90 percent to about 70 percent.

Two years after the introduction of the Gillette Stainless blades, the company brought out the Super Stainless blades – known in Europe as Super Silver – that were made from an improved steel alloy. Gillette also introduced the Techmatic, a new type of razor that used a continuous spool of stainless blade housed in a plastic cartridge.

The success of the coated Super Blue blades marked the start of a period when chemistry became as important as metallurgy in Gillette&#x27;s blade manufacturing. The Super Blue&#x27;s coating was a result of teamwork between the Gillette&#x27;s British and American scientists. As a result of the Wilkinson ordeal, Gillette&#x27;s then-chairman Carl Gilbert increased the company&#x27;s spending on research and development facilities in the U.S., championed the building of a research facility in Rockville, Maryland, and encouraged further expansion of R&amp;D activities in England.

=== Trac II: The move to cartridge razors ===

The development of Gillette&#x27;s first twin-blade razor began in early 1964 in the company&#x27;s Reading laboratories in England when a new employee, Norman C. Welsh, experimented with tandem blades and discovered what he called the &quot;hysteresis effect&quot;; a blade pulling the whisker out of the hair follicle before cutting it, and enabling a second blade to cut the whisker even shorter before it retracted back into the follicle. For six years afterwards, Welsh and his colleagues worked on a means of utilizing the hysteresis effect, almost exclusively concentrating on what would later be known as the Atra twin-blade system. The Atra razor featured two blades set in a plastic cartridge with edges that faced each other. Using the razor required the user to move it in an up-and-down scrubbing motion, and whiskers were cut on both the up and down strokes. Another twin-blade system with blades set in tandem, codenamed &quot;Rex&quot;, also existed, but it had too many technical problems and was behind Atra in development.

In consumer tests, the Atra razor had outperformed existing razor systems, but Gillette&#x27;s marketing executives feared the razor would meet resistance among shavers due to the unfamiliar scrubbing motion required to use it. Even though the Atra project was so far along in mid-1970 that packaging and production machinery was nearly ready for a full market introduction, Gillette decided to start a development drive to finish Rex instead as it did not require learning a new way to shave. The project succeeded, Atra was abandoned, and Gillette announced the first twin-blade razor – now renamed to Trac II – in the fall of 1971. The Trac II captured the premium shaving market and came out in time to counter Wilkinson Sword&#x27;s Bonded Blade system that utilized single-blade cartridges.

=== The challenge of disposables ===

In 1974, the French Société Bic introduced the world&#x27;s first disposable razor. The razor was first brought to the market in Greece, where it sold well, after which it was introduced to Italy and many other European countries. Gillette hurried to develop their own disposable before Bic could bring their razor to the United States. Gillette designed a single-blade razor similar to Bic&#x27;s but soon abandoned the concept in favor of a razor that was essentially a Trac II cartridge molded into a blue plastic handle. Gillette introduced this disposable as the Good News in 1976, about a year before Bic&#x27;s razor reached the United States, and managed to establish market leadership once Bic and other competitors came to market. Good News was released under various names in Europe and was equally and sometimes even more successful than Bic&#x27;s razor. Gillette quickly brought its razor to markets Bic hadn&#x27;t yet reached, such as Latin America where the razor was known as Prestobarba.

In Latin America, Gillette used a so-called cannibalization strategy by selling the razor in several market segments: along with the heavily advertised Prestobarba, the razor was also sold under different names – such as Permasharp II in Mexico and Probak II in Brazil – and sold for at least 10 to 15 percent less. The less expensive variants were differentiated from the blue Prestobarba by manufacturing them from yellow plastic with handle less ergonomically comfortable, and in addition, they were not advertised or eventually had negative marketing aimed at promoting the sale of the most profitable products in Gillette&#x27;s razors line. The strategy was successful and later market arrivals were unable to gain a major foothold. Once the approach proved to be a successful one, Gillette&#x27;s subsidiaries in Russia, Poland, and multiple Asian and Near Eastern markets began utilizing the same strategy.

While Gillette managed to retain market leadership against Bic and other competitors, the popularity of disposable razors, their higher production cost compared to cartridges, and price competition eroded the company&#x27;s profits. Gillette had at first hoped that disposables would take no more than 10 percent of the total razor and blades market, but by 1980, disposables accounted for more than 27 percent of the world shaving market in terms of unit sales, and 22 percent of total revenue. John W. Symons began steering Gillette into a different direction after becoming the director of Gillette&#x27;s European Sales Group in 1979. Despite Gillette&#x27;s strong sales and a large share of the European razor and blades market – 70 percent, which was higher than in the United States – cash flow was declining. In Symons&#x27;s view, the issue was Gillette&#x27;s attempt to compete with Bic in the disposables market, which was eating into the sales of its more profitable cartridge razors. Symons reduced the marketing budget of disposables in Europe and hired the advertising agency BBDO&#x27;s London branch to create an ad campaign to make Gillette&#x27;s blade and razor systems – such as Contour – more desirable in the eyes of men. The new marketing strategy, combined with cutting costs and centralizing production increased profits. In 1985, Gillette&#x27;s profits in the European market were $96 million, while two years previously they were $77 million.
In 1980, Gillette introduced Atra – known in Europe as Contour – a twin-blade razor with a pivoting head. The razor became a best-seller in the United States during its first year and eventually became a market leader in Europe.

=== Acquisitions and takeover attempts ===

In 1984, Gillette agreed to acquire Oral-B Laboratories from dental care company Cooper Laboratories for $188.5 million in cash. Revlon Group&#x27;s Ronald Perelman offered to purchase 86.1 percent of Gillette for $3.8 billion in 1986, valuing the company at $4.1 billion. Gillette also bought back Revlon&#x27;s stake in the company for $558 million. Revlon made two additional unsolicited requests to purchase Gillette for $4.66 billion and $5.4 billion in June and August 1987, respectively, both of which were rejected by Gillette&#x27;s board of directors.

In 1988, Coniston Partners acquired approximately 6 percent of Gillette. Hoping to acquire four directors&#x27; seats and pressure Gillette to sell, Coniston forced a proxy vote in April. The companies filed suits against one another, resulting in a settlement in August. Gillette repurchased approximately 16 million shares for $720 million and Coniston agreed not to purchase many Gillette shares, participate in proxy contests, or otherwise seek control of the company for three years.

In 1989, Warren Buffett&#x27;s Berkshire Hathaway purchased $600 million worth of Gillette convertible preferred shares. Buffett filled a vacant seat on the company&#x27;s board and agreed not to sell his stake &quot;except in a change of control or if insurance regulators force a sale of the stock in the event Gillette&#x27;s financial condition falters&quot;, reducing the chances of a takeover. During late 1989 and early 1990, Gillette launched the new product Sensor with a $175 million marketing campaign in 19 countries in North America and Western Europe.

===Early to mid-1990s===
In 1990, Gillette attempted to purchase Wilkinson Sword&#x27;s U.S. and non-European operations. The Department of Justice prevented the sale of Wilkinson&#x27;s U.S. assets to prevent a significant reduction in competition by eliminating one of the top four blade suppliers when Gillette already controlled approximately half of the nation&#x27;s razor market. Gillette launched the Series line of men&#x27;s grooming products, including scented shaving gels, deodorants, and skin-care items, in 1992. The company&#x27;s SensorExcel launched in Europe and Canada in 1993, followed by the United Kingdom and United States in 1994. In 1996, Gillette launched several new products for women and teenage boys, including the SensorExcel for Women, a moisturizer, a shaving gel, and a body spray.

===Beginning of the Razor Wars===
The company launched the new shaving system Gillette Mach3 in 1998, challenging the twin-blade system which dominated the market by introducing a third blade. Gillette promoted the product, which took five years to develop and was protected by 35 patents, with a $300 million marketing campaign. The Mach3 and replacement cartridges cost 35 percent more than the SensorExcel razor. By 1999, Gillette was worth US$43 billion, and the brand value of Gillette was estimated to be worth US$16 billion. This equated to 37% of the company&#x27;s value. In 2000, Gillette&#x27;s board fired CEO Michael Hawley; he was replaced by former Nabisco CEO James M. Kilts in early 2001. In 2003, Schick-Wilkinson Sword introduced the Quattro, a four-blade shaving system, increasing the company&#x27;s market share to 17 percent. Gillette claimed the Quattro infringed on the Mach3 patents. Gillette&#x27;s efforts were unsuccessful, but the company maintained approximately two-thirds of the global wet-razor market as of mid-2005.

===Procter &amp; Gamble acquisition to present===
In 2005, Procter &amp; Gamble announced plans to acquire Gillette for more than $50 billion, which would position P&amp;G as the world&#x27;s largest consumer products company. The deal was approved by the Federal Trade Commission. Gillette introduced the world&#x27;s first 5-blade razor, called the Fusion, during 2005–2006, marking the company&#x27;s first launch after the P&amp;G acquisition. By 2010, the Fusion was the world&#x27;s highest selling blade and razor brand, reaching $1 billion in annual sales faster than any prior P&amp;G product. Gillette&#x27;s Fusion ProSeries skincare line, launched in 2010, included a thermal facial scrub, a face wash, a lotion, and a moisturizer with sunscreen. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for facial hair grooming was introduced in 2012, with André 3000, Gael García Bernal, and Adrien Brody serving as brand ambassadors.

In 2015, the company launched a subscription service called Gillette Shave Club and later filed a lawsuit against Dollar Shave Club for patent infringement. The Dollar Shave Club lawsuit was criticized for revealing flaws in Gillette&#x27;s own patents and as a perceived attempt to drive away an upstart competitor; the lawsuit was dropped two months later after Dollar Shave Club filed a countersuit.

In 2019, the company partnered with TerraCycle to create a U.S. recycling program for blades, razors, and packaging for any brand. In 2020, Gillette announced a commitment to reduce the use of virgin (unrecycled) plastics by 50 percent by 2030 and maintain zero waste to landfill status across all plants.

== Product history ==
=== Double-edged safety razors ===

The first safety razor using the new disposable blade went on sale in 1903. Gillette maintained a limited range of models of this new type razor until 1921 when the original Gillette patent expired. In anticipation of the event, Gillette introduced a redesigned razor and offered it at a variety of prices in different cases and finishes, including the long-running &quot;aristocrat&quot;. Gillette continued to sell the original razor but instead of pricing it at $5, it was priced at $1, making a Gillette razor truly affordable to every man regardless of economic class. In 1932 the Gillette Blue Blade, so-named because it was dipped in blue lacquer, was introduced. It became one of the most recognizable blades in the world. In 1934 the &quot;twist to open&quot; (TTO) design was instituted, which featured butterfly-like doors that made blade changing much easier than it had been, wherein the razor head had to be detached from the handle.

Razor handles continued to advance to allow consumers to achieve a closer shave. In 1947, the new (TTO) model, the &quot;Super Speed&quot;, was introduced. This was updated in 1955, with different versions being produced to shave more closely – the degree of closeness being marked by the color of the handle tip.

In 1955, the first &quot;adjustable&quot; razor was produced. This allowed for an adjustment of the blade to increase the closeness of the shave. The model, in various versions, remained in production until 1988.

The Super Speed razor was again redesigned in 1966 and given a black resin coated metal handle. It remained in production until 1988. A companion model the, &quot;Knack&quot;, with a longer plastic handle, was produced from 1966 to 1975. In Europe, the Knack was sold as &quot;Slim Twist&quot; and &quot;G2000&quot; from 1978 to 1988, a later version known as &quot;G1000&quot; was made in England and available until 1998. A modern version of the Tech, with a plastic thin handle, is still produced and sold in several countries under the names 7 O&#x27;clock, Gillette, Nacet, Minora, Rubie, and Economica.

== Criticism and controversy ==

The desire to release ever more expensive products, each claiming to be the &quot;best ever&quot;, has led Gillette to make disputed claims for its products. In 2005, an injunction was brought by rival Wilkinson Sword which was granted by the Connecticut District Court which determined that Gillette&#x27;s claims were both &quot;unsubstantiated and inaccurate&quot; and that the product demonstrations in Gillette&#x27;s advertising were &quot;greatly exaggerated&quot; and &quot;literally false&quot;. While advertising in the United States had to be rewritten, the court&#x27;s ruling does not apply in other countries.

Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) shaving products have been under investigation by the UK Office of Fair Trading as part of an inquiry into alleged collusion between manufacturers and retailers in setting prices.

Gillette was fined by Autorité de la concurrence in France in 2016 for price fixing on personal hygiene products.

In January 2019, Gillette began a new marketing campaign, &quot;The Best Men Can Be&quot;, to mark the 30th anniversary of the &quot;Best a Man Can Get&quot; slogan. The campaign was introduced with a long-form commercial entitled &quot;We Believe&quot;, and aims to promote positive values among men – condemning acts of bullying, sexism, sexual assault, and toxic masculinity. While the campaign received praise for its acknowledgement of current social movements and for promoting positive values of masculinity, it also faced a negative response – including from right-wing critics – being called left-wing propaganda, accusatory towards its customers, and misandrist and there were calls for boycotts of Gillette.

In June 2019, P&amp;G wrote-down Gillette business by $8 billion, a move which company executives attributed to currency exchange, new competitors in the market, and increased popularity of growing beards. Share prices increased following the write-down.

==Marketing==
Gillette first introduced its long-time slogan, &quot;The Best a Man Can Get&quot;, during a commercial first aired during Super Bowl XXIII in 1989. In 2024, singer Tom Grennan sang the song for a UK advert, and released it as a single.

The company has sponsored Major League Baseball (MLB), the 2010 Gillette Fusion ProGlide 500, and the Olympic Games, and has naming rights to Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, home venue for the National Football League&#x27;s New England Patriots and Major League Soccer&#x27;s New England Revolution. Athletes such as Roger Federer, Tiger Woods, Shoaib Malik, Derek Jeter, Thierry Henry, Kenan Sofuoğlu, Park Ji-sung, Rahul Dravid, Raheem Sterling, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Michael Clarke have been sponsored by the company, as well as video gaming personality Dr Disrespect.

In November 2009, Gillette became the subject of a proposed boycott in Ireland due to its endorsement by French soccer player Thierry Henry; his undetected handball foul during a FIFA World Cup qualifying match contributed to a game-winning goal by France, eliminating Ireland from contention. The following month, expanding upon the controversy, media outlets observed a &quot;curse&quot; associated with top athletes who endorse Gillette, also citing Tiger Woods (who became the subject of an infidelity scandal in late 2009), and Roger Federer losing in an upset to Nikolay Davydenko during the 2009 ATP World Tour Finals.

Since its opening in 2002, Gillette has held naming rights to Gillette Stadium in nearby Foxborough, home of the New England Patriots of the National Football League and the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer. The original agreement lasted through 2017; in 2010, P&amp;G negotiated a 15-year extension, lasting through 2031.

Since the 1990s, the company has used a marketing list to send a free sample of a Gillette razor in promotional packages to men in celebration of their 18th birthday. The campaign has occasionally resulted in the samples accidentally being sent to recipients outside of the demographic, such as a 50-year-old woman (exacerbated by the package containing the slogan &quot;Welcome to Manhood&quot;).

In 2019, Gillette and Twitch partnered to form the esports group Gillette Gaming Alliance, as well as the Bits for Blades campaign which gave Twitch Bits (the site&#x27;s digital currency) to those who purchased Gillette products online. The 2019 team had eleven streamers, each representing a different country, and the 2020 team had five streamers including DrLupo. During 2020–2021, Gillette enlisted NFL players Saquon Barkley, Ashtyn Davis, Jalen Hurts, Cole Kmet, and Tua Tagovailoa as brand ambassadors.

Gillette became the jersey sponsor of the New England Revolution in 2025.

== In science ==
In laser research and development, Gillette razor blades are used as a non-standard measurement as a rough estimate of a particular laser beam&#x27;s penetrative ability; a &quot;four-Gillette laser&quot;, for example, can burn through four blades.

== In music ==
A Gillette razorblade was used as a tool to achieve a certain sound by the English rock band The Kinks. Kinks member Dave Davies became &quot;really bored with this guitar sound – or lack of an interesting sound&quot; so he purchased &quot;a little green amplifier...an Elpico&quot; from a radio spares shop in Muswell Hill, and &quot;twiddled around with it&quot;, including &quot;taking the wires going to the speaker and putting a jack plug on there and plugging it straight into my AC30&quot; (a larger amplifier), but did not get the sound he wanted until he got frustrated and &quot;got a single-sided Gillette razorblade and cut round the cone [from the center to the edge]... so it was all shredded but still on there, still intact. I played and I thought it was amazing.&quot; The sound was replicated in the studio by having the Elpico plugged into the Vox AC30. It was this sound, courtesy of a Gillette razor blade that became a mainstay on many of The Kinks early recordings, including &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; and &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot;.

== Operations in Canada ==
In late 1988, Gillette announced plans to eliminate manufacturing operations in Montreal and Toronto. The Canadian unit&#x27;s executive offices remained in Montreal, with administrative, distribution, marketing, and sales operations continuing in both cities. Approximately 600 employees in Canada were laid off as part of the global restructuring, which followed a $720 million share repurchase and sought to &quot;rationalize worldwide production&quot;. As of 2005, Gillette was not producing products in Canada and employed approximately 200 people in Edmonton, Mississauga, and Montreal.

Scheduled freight services were discontinued from 1984, and small parcel services from 1985. With the dissolution and privatization of the JNR on April 1, 1987, the station came under the operational control of the East Japan Railway Company. The north exit bus terminal was greatly expanded in 1996 and 1998. Automated turnstiles using the Suica IC Card system came into operation on November 18, 2001. The station building was reconstructed in 2006 to include a multi-story department store.

<doc id="735651" wikidata="Q156620" url="?curid=735651" title="70 Panopaea">
<text>70 Panopaea is a large main belt asteroid. Its orbit is close to those of the Eunomia asteroid family; however, Panopaea is a dark, primitive carbonaceous C-type asteroid in contrast to the S-type asteroids of the Eunomian asteroids. The spectra of the asteroid displays evidence of aqueous alteration. Photometric studies give a rotation period of 15.797 hours and an amplitude of in magnitude. Previous studies that suggested the rotation period may be twice this amount were rejected based upon further observation.

Panopaea was discovered by Hermann Goldschmidt on 5 May 1861. It was his fourteenth and last asteroid discovery. It is named after Panopea, a nymph in Greek mythology; the name was chosen by Robert Main, President of the Royal Astronomical Society. In 1862, Swedish astronomer Nils Christoffer Dunér gave a doctoral thesis on the orbital elements of this asteroid.

The orbit of 70 Panopaea places it in a mean motion resonance with the planets Jupiter and Saturn. The computed Lyapunov time for this asteroid is 24,000 years, indicating that it occupies a chaotic orbit that will change randomly over time because of gravitational perturbations of the planets.

The asteroid frequently makes close approaches with 16 Psyche, such as on 12 June 2040 when it will make a close approach of 0.00602 AU (2.34 Lunar distances, or approx. 770,000 km, 478,455 mi) to the asteroid, and on 2 June 2095 when it will come only 0.003372 AU (1.31 LD) to the asteroid.

<text>Ōfuna Station (, ) is a railway station in Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan, operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) and Shonan Monorail.

==Lines==
Ōfuna Station is served by the Tokaido Main Line, Shōnan-Shinjuku Line, Negishi Line (Keihin-Tōhoku Line), Yokosuka Line, as well as the Shonan Monorail. It is 46.5 km from the terminus of the Tōkaidō Main Line at Tokyo Station.

==Station layout==
Ōfuna Station is an elevated station with five island platforms serving a total of 11 tracks. The adjacent Shonan Monorail station has a single bay platform.

There are above-track station buildings at both ends of the platforms, toward Fujisawa and toward Totsuka, offering passage between lines inside the ticket gates. The Kashio River, which runs between the two current station buildings, is a city boundary, meaning that the end of the station near Fujisawa is in Kamakura, while the end toward Totsuka is in Sakae-ku, Yokohama. However, the station master&#x27;s office is, as was before the station&#x27;s rebuilding, on the Kamakura side, so the station is treated as a Kamakura station, and not considered to be within the city of Yokohama.

The Fujisawa-side station building has the southern ticket gates and connects to East and West exits. The station building is connected by a passageway beside the building to the Shonan Monorail station. There is also a &quot;Midori no Madoguchi&quot; staffed ticket office and a View Plaza travel agency.

In the Totsuka-side station building is the northern ticket gate, connected to the Kasama Entrance.

===Platforms===





== History ==

Ōfuna Station opened on November 1, 1888, as a station on the Tōkaidō Main Line. The Yokosuka Line between Ōfuna and Yokosuka opened on June 16, 1889. Freight operations began in 1894.

In May 1966, the Yokohama Dreamland Monorail began operations from Ōfuna to Yokohama Dreamland, an amusement park built some 7 km north of the station. However, the monorail stopped running in September 1967 after cracks were found in the guideway. The monorail station was eventually decommissioned in 1992 and its former site is now an apartment block.

On March 7, 1970, another monorail began operations from Ōfuna to the south. This Shonan Monorail eventually connected the station to Enoshima.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2013, the JR East station was used by an average of 97,118 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the 42nd-busiest station operated by JR East. A total of 4,817,536 passengers used the Shōnan Monorail station in fiscal 2012. The daily average passenger figures (boarding passengers only) for JR East in previous years are as shown below.

Throughout its length west of Austin, US 290 cuts across mountainous hills comprising the Texas Hill Country and the Edwards Plateau; between Austin and Houston, the highway then travels through gradually hilly grasslands and pine forests comprising the Gulf Coastal Plains.

In its original designation in 1926, US 290 originally traveled from US 80 in Reeves County to terminate in San Antonio; though the highway still retains its designation from southeast of Segovia to Fredericksburg, I-10 and US 87 replaced much of the old routing in 1935. US 290 also received several minor re-routings east of Austin in 1951 that moved it further north, eliminating the old SH 20; the old routings were replaced by SH 71 and SH 21. While US 290 does not directly connect to its parent route of U.S. Route 90, ramps at its eastern terminus lead to US 90 and I-10.

==Route description==
US 290 begins from I-10 roughly southeast of Segovia. It begins to travel due east through rural farmlands in the Texas Hill Country before reaching Harper, where it is the main west–east road in the town. Afterwards, US 290 begins making slight curves as it crosses several creeks and tributaries until it joins US 87 and runs as Main Street through Fredericksburg. The two highways travel together for eleven blocks in downtown Fredericksburg before US 87 splits south of US 290 at an intersection directly south of the National Museum of the Pacific War. Traveling due south, US 290 returns to an eastward path after crossing the Pedernales River, where it serves as a major artery for Fredericksburg&#x27;s agricultural district, including Wildseed Farms. The highway then runs parallel to the Pedernales River, and after passing Stonewall, serves the south side of LBJ Ranch. As the Pedernales River arcs further north, US 290 continues east through several wineries before approaching Johnson City and bordering the north side of the LBJ Johnson City Unit. US 290 runs along Main Street throughout downtown Johnson City as it joins US 281 and heads south.

After traveling through additional hilly terrain, US 290 splits east from US 281 and twists through slopes in the Edwards Plateau, where an intersection with RM 3232 in the unincorporated community of Henly provides access to Pedernales Falls State Park. US 290 then curves south to serve downtown Dripping Springs, and then serves various residential areas as it crosses into southwest Austin. The highway then begins a concurrency with SH 71 at a series of traffic lights and travels through Austin&#x27;s Oak Hill district before becoming a five-to-six-lane freeway. In the community of Sunset Valley, US 290 has interchanges with Loop 1 (MoPac Expressway) and Loop 360 (Capital of Texas Highway) providing access to the Barton Creek Greenbelt, and is then designated as Ben White Boulevard while it travels through south-central Austin, crossing the UPRR Austin Subdivision railroad in the process. Shortly afterward, US 290 splits north from SH 71 in a stack interchange to run concurrent with I-35.
Upon beginning its concurrency with I-35, US 290 travels through the suburban Riverside and Travis Heights districts while also serving St. Edward&#x27;s University. After crossing the Colorado River, I-35 and US 290 cut between downtown Austin and the East Cesar Chavez district, being the only major highways to serve the Austin Convention Center and the Texas State Capitol. Just prior to bordering the east side of the main University of Texas at Austin campus, I-35 and US 290 split into two decks for about , resurfacing close to the former Mueller Airport. US 290 then splits due east from I-35 southeast of the former Highland Mall as a four-lane freeway. Not long after, US 290 has an interchange with US 183 and promptly becomes a tolled freeway designated as the Manor Expressway. It then travels through much of industrial East Austin and Daffan before reverting to a four-lane divided highway after an interchange with SH 130, less than a mile shy of Manor. US 290 then makes its way through rolling meadows dotted with suburban areas in northeast Travis County, then travels through southern Elgin where it forms a brief concurrency with SH 95. Passing through the town of McDade, US 290 cuts through piney woods north of the Lost Pines Forest and has an interchange with SH 21 west of Paige. US 290 continues east, running parallel to the Austin and Northwestern Railroad east branch until approaching Giddings, where the highway travels along Austin Street, intersecting US 77 near the town&#x27;s center.
US 290 travels southeast to Ledbetter, where it then travels through additional grassland before bounding northeast to Burton. The highway then enters Brenham, where it briefly joins SH 36 to serve Blinn College and bypass the city as a four-lane freeway. After exiting Brenham, US 290 runs parallel to the old Washington County Railroad and goes through Chappell Hill to serve every historic landmark there, then crosses the Brazos River to move through a rural auto-industrial area. SH 6 joins US 290 north of Hempstead, where the two highways become a four-lane freeway notable for its role as a hurricane evacuation route. Running parallel to the Houston and Texas Central Railway from the north, US 290 finally comes right next to it roughly prior to intersecting SH 99. The highway is then designated as Northwest Freeway (legally as the Ronald Reagan Memorial Highway) as it travels through the suburb of Cypress, later splitting off SH 6 to the south in the suburb of Jersey Village. Following an interchange with the Sam Houston Tollway, US 290 serves several businesses and neighborhoods in northwest Houston before terminating at an interchange with I-610 west of the Lazybrook/Timbergrove district.

==History==
===Texas State Highways 20 and 20A (1917–1951)===

On June 21, 1917, the department&#x27;s Office of State Highway Engineer issued a proposal for the state highway system. The proposal included SH 20 originally planned as the Austin-Houston Highway between Austin and Houston by way of Bastrop, Giddings, Brenham, and Hempstead. On July 17, 1917, the planned route was extended from Austin to Brady by way of Burnet, Llano, and Mason. On December 17, 1918, SH 20 was rerouted away from Bastrop, with the section from Austin to Bastrop transferred to SH 3A. The section of SH 20 from Hempstead to Houston was cancelled as it was already part of the Gulf Division Branch of SH 2.
On November 19, 1917, an intercounty highway from Austin through Johnson City to Fredericksburg was designated. On January 20, 1919, this was changed to an auxiliary route of Highway 20, Highway 20A. The highway routes remained unchanged in a 1922 proposal that rated both routes as &quot;second class&quot; under a three-tier system.

On August 21, 1923, SH 20 in the new highway system was routed over the previously proposed Highway 20A from Fredericksburg to Austin and then over the proposed Highway 20 to Hempstead as a second class highway. The old route to Leander was cancelled, and northwest of there became part of SH 43 when it was extended southwest. In 1924, the state highway department assumed responsibility to maintain all state highways which were previously maintained by the counties. The following year, state lawmakers vest the department with the authority to acquire right of way, survey, plan, and build highways. On August 10, 1925, SH 20 was given a third class extension to Kerrville. On February 20, 1928, SH 20 was given an auxiliary route SH 20A from Fredericksburg to a point on the highway between Kerrville and Junction. All of the highway from Fredericksburg to Hempstead was classified as a &quot;secondary federal highway&quot;. The portion between Fredericksburg and Kerrville along with the new auxiliary route were classified as &quot;state highways&quot; eligible for state aid only.

On March 19, 1930, the SH 20 designation was dropped over the Fredericksburg to Kerrville highway (replaced by an extended SH 81) and extended instead over the auxiliary route SH 20A. In 1933 the road was described between Fredericksburg and Hempstead as paved except for the portion in Hays County around Dripping Springs and a short portion west of Elgin that were described as surfaced. The portion west of Fredericksburg toward Junction was graded earth. In 1935, US 290 was routed over SH 20 except for the portion between Austin and Paige where US 290 was routed further south through Bastrop. By 1936, the formerly surfaced portion west of Elgin had been paved, but the Hays County portion remained merely surfaced. West of Fredericksburg, the Gillespie County portion had been surfaced while the Kimble County portion remained as an improved earth road. On September 26, 1939, the SH 20 designation was dropped along all portions of the route running along US 290 as a result of that day&#x27;s general redescription of the state highway system, leaving SH 20 as a greatly shortened route running from Austin to US 290 near Paige. On May 23, 1951, US 290 was relocated away from Bastrop northward along SH 20 which was then decommissioned.

===Other original routings===
In its original designation in the late 1920s, US 290 traveled from an intersection with US 80 in western Reeves County to an eastern terminus in San Antonio. On March 1, 1935, US 290 was re-routed further north to terminate in Houston, and the previous alignment from Fredericksburg to San Antonio was redesignated as US 87. Following the 1935 re-routing, US 290 traveled through much of its present-day routing, with the exception of a designation traveling through Austin and Bastrop before following the Old San Antonio Road to Paige. On May 23, 1951, US 290 was rerouted further north to Elgin, while the original routing was transferred to SH 71 from Austin to Bastrop, and SH 21 from Bastrop to Paige.

Through Austin, US 290 originally followed Lamar Boulevard and Cesar Chavez Street to I-35 (then US 81). On May 30, 1951, US 290 and SH 71 were both rerouted onto their present-day designations on Ben White Boulevard, and the old designations were transferred to Loop 343.

On November 21, 1991, the US 290 designation was deleted between the old US 80 junction and its current western terminus southeast of Segovia due to being supplanted by I-10. Much of the old route near Sheffield became SH 290. Other former alignments that are part of the state highway system include the Fort Stockton and Balmorhea business routes of Interstate 10, RM 1312 between Ozona and Sonora, RM 3130 between Sonora and Roosevelt, and RM 1674 between Roosevelt and Junction.

===Freeway upgrades===
====Austin====
In Austin, US 290 initially received two different freeway upgrades; the first took place circa the 1970s from the north interchange with I-35 near Highland Mall to US 183 east of the Coronado Hills district, while the second took place in the late 1990s and early 2000s from the Williamson Creek crossing in the Oak Hill district to the south interchange with I-35 near St. Edward&#x27;s University. In 2012, the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority began constructing a third freeway upgrade from the existing interchange with US 183 to the crossing at Gilleland Creek west of Manor; this designation, known as the Manor Expressway, was completed on May 17, 2014.

====Houston====
Prior to construction of the Northwest Freeway, US 290 through Houston followed Hempstead Highway, which runs parallel to the freeway approximately one-half mile to the southwest. The eastern terminus of US 290 was also approximately one mile to the southeast at the intersection of Hempstead Highway, Washington Avenue and Old Katy Road.

The interchange with I-610 and first part of frontage roads opened in 1963. The first freeway section opened in 1975. In 1982, freeway main lanes completed to just inside Beltway 8. In 1990, the stack interchange with Beltway 8 were completed. From 1984 to 2005, the main lanes outside Beltway 8 were completed.

The freeway was constructed to only three lanes in each direction, but a major investment study in 2002 requested expansion to five lanes in each direction inside Beltway 8 and four lanes in each direction from Beltway 8 to the then-proposed SH 99.

==Future==
In 2011, two members of the U.S. House of Representatives, John Culberson and Michael T. McCaul, asked TxDOT to advocate for the relabeling of US 290 as an interstate highway.

Due to heavy congestion on US 290 in Austin&#x27;s Oak Hill district, in 2022 CTRMA began upgrading US 290 to a freeway between the east intersection of Circle Drive and the existing end of the current freeway at Old Fredericksburg Road; this expansion is known as the Oak Hill Parkway.

In Houston, the Harris County Toll Road Authority is planning to construct toll managed lanes along and adjacent to the US 290 right-of-way, to be called the Hempstead Tollway.

==Major intersections==
The entire route is in Texas. 












































==Business routes==
US 290 currently has three business routes and one former loop.

===Dripping Springs===

Loop 64 is a former business loop of US 290 through the town of Dripping Springs. The highway was designated in 1958 along the former route of US 290 through the town along Mercer Street when the main highway was re-routed two blocks to the south. Loop 64 was removed from the state highway system in 2003 and returned to the city of Dripping Springs for maintenance.

The Loop 64 designation was previously used for a highway in Henderson County. This Loop 64 was designated in 1939, running from SH 31 southeast to a point on the St. Louis Southwestern Railroad in Trinidad. The highway was cancelled and combined with FM 764 in 1948.
===Brenham===

Business U.S. Highway 290-F (Bus. US 290) is the original routing of US 290 through the town of Brenham. The route is in length. The route was designated as Loop 318 throughout its entire length on January 18, 1960. On February 28, 1973, the section from then-SH 90 westward became part of SH 105. It was established in 1990 when the mainline of US 290 was rerouted along with SH 36 around the western and southern sides of Brenham. The routing begins to the west of town at an intersection with SH 36. The business route continues east into downtown on Main Street. Before reaching downtown, the route splits into two parallel one-way streets: Main Street carrying westbound traffic and Alamo Street carrying eastbound traffic. It passes through downtown, meeting the business routing of State Highway 36 and the western terminus of SH 105. At this intersection, the business route turns south on Market Street, and continues out of Brenham, rejoining the mainline US 290 near an intersection with FM 577.
===Hempstead–Hockley===

Business U.S. Highway 290-H (Bus. US 290) is the original routing of US 290 through the towns of Hempstead, Waller, and Hockley. This route was designated between 1995 and 1998 in stages as a limited-access bypass route was constructed to the north of these towns. It begins at the interchange with US 290 and SH 6 and travels south into Hempstead along 10th Street. At an intersection with SH 159, the business route turns east onto Austin Street and subsequently runs parallel to the adjacent railroad after leaving Hempstead city limits. It intersects several amenities in Prairie View before serving downtown Waller while designated as Hempstead Road. After passing through several industrial facilities and serving downtown Hockley, the business route becomes US 290&#x27;s southbound frontage road just prior to the interchange with Badtke Road.
===Cypress===

Business U.S. Highway 290-L (Bus. US 290) is the original routing of US 290 through the town of Cypress. The route was designated in 1993 as a limited-access bypass was built to the northeast of the original routing. At roughly , it is US 290&#x27;s shortest designated business route, serving the south side of Cypress&#x27;s shopping area near the Fry Road and Spring Cypress Road interchanges.

<text>The Totsuka Station (, ) is an interchange passenger railway station located in Totsuka-ku, Yokohama, Japan, operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) and the Yokohama City Transportation Bureau.

==Lines==
JR Totsuka Station is served by the Tōkaidō Main Line, Yokosuka Line and Shōnan-Shinjuku Line and is 40.9 kilometers from . The underground Blue Line station is 7.4 kilometers from the terminus of the subway line at .

==Station layout==
JR Totsuka Station is a ground level station with two island platforms serving four tracks, with an additional set of freight tracks on the west side. The platforms are connected to the station&#x27;s two gates upstairs (over the tracks) and downstairs (underground). The station has a &quot;Midori no Madoguchi&quot; staffed ticket office. The Yokohama Subway station, connected with the JR underground concourse, has one underground island platform.

===JR East platforms===



===Yokohama Municipal Subway platforms===


==History==
===JR East===
Totsuka Station was opened on July 11, 1887, as a station on the Japanese Government Railways (JGR), the predecessor to the post-war Japanese National Railways (JNR). The station building was originally on the west side of the station. The east gate was added in 1937. The current building over the tracks was completed on March 26, 1969.

On March 15, 1930, when Yokosuka Line trains were replaced by electric multiple units, all Tokaido Line trains ceased to stop at Totsuka Station.
Before the Tokaido Line and Yokosuka Line were separated and the station became a junction of the two lines on October 1, 1980, the two lines used the same tracks, but only Yokosuka Line trains stopped at Totsuka Station. The current platforms 1 and 2 did not exist, and the platform 1 (now platform 3) served the Tokyo-bound Yokosuka Line, while line 2 (now line 4) served the away-from-Tokyo direction. Additionally, the current freight lines did not exist, with the old freight lines located where the current platforms 1 and 2 are. From March 1973 when one island platform was added, there were two island platforms, with platform 2 serving the Tokyo-bound trains, and platform 3 serving the other direction. The lines on platforms 1 and 4 were built, but were not used until 1980.

Originally, the station handled both passengers and freight. In 1923, a separate freight yard was completed as a part of the station to the north of the passenger platforms across the crossing with Tōkaidō Highway. All freight operations were discontinued from May 1970. As the addition of the new freight lines claimed the land of the bus terminal in front of the station&#x27;s west gate, the bus terminal was relocated to the site of the former freight yard in July 1971. The bus terminal is now called the Second Bus Center and is distinguished from the larger Bus Center beside the Totsukana building on the same side of the station.

With the privatization of the JNR on April 1, 1987, the station came under the operational control of JR East. Shōnan-Shinjuku Line trains and &quot;Narita Express&quot; limited express services began stopping at Totsuka Station from December 1, 2001.

The timetable was revised on March 18, 2007, so that Tokaido Line &quot;Acty&quot; rapid trains all stopped at this station. This resolved the confusing situation that existed before, when the Shonan-Shinjuku Line rapid and special rapid trains stopped at the station, but Tokaido Line &quot;Acty&quot; services did not. Before the change, it was also the only station for changing trains at which the &quot;Acty&quot; did not stop. As before, the Tokaido Line commuter rapid still do not stop at this station.

===Yokohama Municipal Subway===
The Blue Line of the Yokohama Subway connected to Totsuka Station on 24 May 1987 with temporary facilities. The permanent subway station was opened on 27 August 1989.

==Accidents==
At 05:42 on December 15, 1923, local passenger train No. 21 to collided with the locomotive and a wagon of freight train No. 603, which was blocking the main line. Two locomotives and two wagons were overturned. As a result, the driver of train No. 603 was killed instantly and three passengers were slightly injured. The cause of the accident was a signalman&#x27;s carelessness according to the official record of the railway.

At 09:52 on July 27, 1939, about 500 workers of a nearby Nippon Kōgaku factory entered the track near the station to see off a colleague. The semi-express train No. 221 to hit some of them, killing eight and injuring seven.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2019, the station was used by an average of 112,598 passengers daily (boarding passengers only). In fiscal 2019, the Yokohama Municipal Subway station was used by an average of 44,137 passengers per day (boarding passengers only), making it the second busiest station on the Blue Line (after Yokohama)

The daily passenger figures (boarding passengers only) for previous years are as shown below.

<doc id="735661" wikidata="Q1949683" url="?curid=735661" title="Deterrence theory">
<text>Deterrence theory refers to the scholarship and practice of how threats of using force by one party can convince another party to refrain from initiating some other course of action. The topic gained increased prominence as a military strategy during the Cold War with regard to the use of nuclear weapons and is related to but distinct from the concept of mutual assured destruction, according to which a full-scale nuclear attack on a power with second-strike capability would devastate both parties. The central problem of deterrence revolves around how to credibly threaten military action or nuclear punishment on the adversary despite its costs to the deterrer. Deterrence in an international relations context is the application of deterrence theory to avoid conflict.

Deterrence is widely defined as any use of threats (implicit or explicit) or limited force intended to dissuade an actor from taking an action (i.e. maintain the status quo). Deterrence is unlike compellence, which is the attempt to get an actor (such as a state) to take an action (i.e. alter the status quo). Both are forms of coercion. Compellence has been characterized as harder to successfully implement than deterrence. Deterrence also tends to be distinguished from defense or the use of full force in wartime.

Deterrence is most likely to be successful when a prospective attacker believes that the probability of success is low and the costs of attack are high. Central problems of deterrence include the credible communication of threats and assurance. Deterrence does not necessarily require military superiority.

&quot;General deterrence&quot; is considered successful when an actor who &quot;might&quot; otherwise take an action refrains from doing so due to the consequences that the deterrer is perceived likely to take. &quot;Immediate deterrence&quot; is considered successful when an actor seriously contemplating &quot;immediate&quot; military force or action refrains from doing so. Scholars distinguish between &quot;extended deterrence&quot; (the protection of allies) and &quot;direct deterrence&quot; (protection of oneself). Rational deterrence theory holds that an attacker will be deterred if they believe that:(Probability of deterrer carrying out deterrent threat × Costs if threat carried out) &gt; (Probability of the attacker accomplishing the action × Benefits of the action)This model is frequently simplified in game-theoretic terms as:Costs × P(Costs) &gt; Benefits × P(Benefits)

==History==
While the concept of deterrence precedes the Cold War, it was during the Cold War that the concept evolved into a clearly articulated objective in strategic planning and diplomacy, with considerable analysis by scholars.

By November 1945 general Curtis LeMay, who led American air raids on Japan during World War II, was thinking about how the next war would be fought. He said in a speech that month to the Ohio Society of New York that since &quot;No air attack, once it is launched, can be completely stopped&quot;, his country needed an air force that could immediately retaliate: &quot;If we are prepared it may never come. It is not immediately conceivable that any nation will dare to attack us if we are prepared&quot;.

Most of the innovative work on deterrence theory occurred from the late 1940s to mid-1960s. Historically, scholarship on deterrence has tended to focus on nuclear deterrence. Since the end of the Cold War, there has been an extension of deterrence scholarship to areas that are not specifically about nuclear weapons.

NATO was founded in 1949 with deterring aggression as one of its goals.

A distinction is sometimes made between nuclear deterrence and &quot;conventional deterrence.&quot;

The two most prominent deterrent strategies are &quot;denial&quot; (denying the attacker the benefits of attack) and &quot;punishment&quot; (inflicting costs on the attacker).

Lesson of Munich, where appeasement failed, contributes to deterrence theory. In the words of scholars Frederik Logevall and Kenneth Osgood, &quot;Munich and appeasement have become among the dirtiest words in American politics, synonymous with naivete and weakness, and signifying a craven willingness to barter away the nation&#x27;s vital interests for empty promises.&quot; They claimed that the success of US foreign policy often depends upon a president withstanding &quot;the inevitable charges of appeasement that accompany any decision to negotiate with hostile powers.

==Concept==

The concept of deterrence can be defined as the use of threats in limited force by one party to convince another party to refrain from initiating some course of action. In &quot;Arms and Influence&quot; (1966), Schelling offers a broader definition of deterrence, as he defines it as &quot;to prevent from action by fear of consequences.&quot; Glenn Snyder also offers a broad definition of deterrence, as he argues that deterrence involves both the threat of sanction and the promise of reward.

A threat serves as a deterrent to the extent that it convinces its target not to carry out the intended action because of the costs and losses that target would incur. In international security, a policy of deterrence generally refers to threats of military retaliation directed by the leaders of one state to the leaders of another in an attempt to prevent the other state from resorting to the use of military force in pursuit of its foreign policy goals.

As outlined by Huth, a policy of deterrence can fit into two broad categories: preventing an armed attack against a state&#x27;s own territory (known as direct deterrence) or preventing an armed attack against another state (known as extended deterrence). Situations of direct deterrence often occur if there is a territorial dispute between neighboring states in which major powers like the United States do not directly intervene. On the other hand, situations of extended deterrence often occur when a great power becomes involved. The latter case has generated most interest in academic literature. Building on the two broad categories, Huth goes on to outline that deterrence policies may be implemented in response to a pressing short-term threat (known as immediate deterrence) or as strategy to prevent a military conflict or short-term threat from arising (known as general deterrence).

A successful deterrence policy must be considered in military terms but also political terms: International relations, foreign policy and diplomacy. In military terms, deterrence success refers to preventing state leaders from issuing military threats and actions that escalate peacetime diplomatic and military co-operation into a crisis or militarized confrontation that threatens armed conflict and possibly war. The prevention of crises of wars, however, is not the only aim of deterrence. In addition, defending states must be able to resist the political and the military demands of a potential attacking nation. If armed conflict is avoided at the price of diplomatic concessions to the maximum demands of the potential attacking nation under the threat of war, it cannot be claimed that deterrence has succeeded.

Furthermore, as Jentleson &quot;et al.&quot; argue, two key sets of factors for successful deterrence are important: a defending state strategy that balances credible coercion and deft diplomacy consistent with the three criteria of proportionality, reciprocity, and coercive credibility and minimizes international and domestic constraints and the extent of an attacking state&#x27;s vulnerability as shaped by its domestic political and economic conditions. In broad terms, a state wishing to implement a strategy of deterrence is most likely to succeed if the costs of noncompliance that it can impose on and the benefits of compliance it can offer to another state are greater than the benefits of noncompliance and the costs of compliance.

Deterrence theory holds that nuclear weapons are intended to deter other states from attacking with their nuclear weapons, through the promise of retaliation and possibly mutually assured destruction. Nuclear deterrence can also be applied to an attack by conventional forces. For example, the doctrine of massive retaliation threatened to launch US nuclear weapons in response to Soviet attacks.

A successful nuclear deterrent requires a country to preserve its ability to retaliate by responding before its own weapons are destroyed or ensuring a second-strike capability. A nuclear deterrent is sometimes composed of a nuclear triad, as in the case of the nuclear weapons owned by the United States, Russia, China and India. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and France, have only sea-based and air-based nuclear weapons.

===Proportionality===
Jentleson &quot;et al.&quot; provides further detail in relation to those factors. Proportionality refers to the relationship between the defending state&#x27;s scope and nature of the objectives being pursued and the instruments available for use to pursue them. The more the defending state demands of another state, the higher that state&#x27;s costs of compliance and the greater need for the defending state&#x27;s strategy to increase the costs of noncompliance and the benefits of compliance. That is a challenge, as deterrence is by definition a strategy of limited means. George (1991) goes on to explain that deterrence sometimes goes beyond threats to the actual use of military force, but if force is actually used, it must be limited and fall short of full-scale use to succeed.

The main source of disproportionality is an objective that goes beyond policy change to regime change, which has been seen in Libya, Iraq, and North Korea. There, defending states have sought to change the leadership of a state and to policy changes relating primarily to their nuclear weapons programs.

===Reciprocity===
Secondly, Jentleson &quot;et al.&quot; outlines that reciprocity involves an explicit understanding of linkage between the defending state&#x27;s carrots and the attacking state&#x27;s concessions. The balance lies in not offering too little, too late or for too much in return and not offering too much, too soon, or for too little return.

===Coercive credibility===
Finally, coercive credibility requires that in addition to calculations about costs and benefits of co-operation, the defending state convincingly conveys to the attacking state that failure to co-operate has consequences. Threats, uses of force, and other coercive instruments such as economic sanctions must be sufficiently credible to raise the attacking state&#x27;s perceived costs of noncompliance. A defending state having a superior military capability or economic strength in itself is not enough to ensure credibility. Indeed, all three elements of a balanced deterrence strategy are more likely to be achieved if other major international actors like the UN or NATO are supportive, and opposition within the defending state&#x27;s domestic politics is limited.

The other important considerations outlined by Jentleson &quot;et al.&quot; that must be taken into consideration is the domestic political and economic conditions in the attacking state affecting its vulnerability to deterrence policies and the attacking state&#x27;s ability to compensate unfavourable power balances. The first factor is whether internal political support and regime security are better served by defiance, or there are domestic political gains to be made from improving relations with the defending state. The second factor is an economic calculation of the costs that military force, sanctions, and other coercive instruments can impose and the benefits that trade and other economic incentives may carry. That is partly a function of the strength and flexibility of the attacking state&#x27;s domestic economy and its capacity to absorb or counter the costs being imposed. The third factor is the role of elites and other key domestic political figures within the attacking state. To the extent that such actors&#x27; interests are threatened with the defending state&#x27;s demands, they act to prevent or block the defending state&#x27;s demands.

==Rational deterrence theory==
One approach to theorizing about deterrence has entailed the use of rational choice and game-theoretic models of decision making (see game theory). Rational deterrence theory entails:

# Rationality: actors are rational
# Unitary actor assumption: actors are understood as unitary
# Dyads: interactions tend to be between dyads (or triads) of states
# Strategic interactions: actors consider the choices of other actors
# Cost-benefit calculations: outcomes reflect actors&#x27; cost-benefit calculations

Deterrence theorists have consistently argued that deterrence success is more likely if a defending state&#x27;s deterrent threat is credible to an attacking state. Huth outlines that a threat is considered credible if the defending state possesses both the military capabilities to inflict substantial costs on an attacking state in an armed conflict, and the attacking state believes that the defending state is resolved to use its available military forces. Huth goes on to explain the four key factors for consideration under rational deterrence theory: the military balance, signaling and bargaining power, reputations for resolve, interests at stake.

The American economist Thomas Schelling brought his background in game theory to the subject of studying international deterrence. Schelling&#x27;s (1966) classic work on deterrence presents the concept that military strategy can no longer be defined as the science of military victory. Instead, it is argued that military strategy was now equally, if not more, the art of coercion, intimidation and deterrence. Schelling says the capacity to harm another state is now used as a motivating factor for other states to avoid it and influence another state&#x27;s behavior. To be coercive or deter another state, violence must be anticipated and avoidable by accommodation. It can therefore be summarized that the use of the power to hurt as bargaining power is the foundation of deterrence theory and is most successful when it is held in reserve.

In an article celebrating Schelling&#x27;s Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics, Michael Kinsley, &quot;Washington Post&quot; op‑ed columnist and one of Schelling&#x27;s former students, anecdotally summarizes Schelling&#x27;s reorientation of game theory thus: &quot;[Y]ou&#x27;re standing at the edge of a cliff, chained by the ankle to someone else. You&#x27;ll be released, and one of you will get a large prize, as soon as the other gives in. How do you persuade the other guy to give in, when the only method at your disposal—threatening to push him off the cliff—would doom you both? Answer: You start dancing, closer and closer to the edge. That way, you don&#x27;t have to convince him that you would do something totally irrational: plunge him and yourself off the cliff. You just have to convince him that you are prepared to take a higher risk than he is of accidentally falling off the cliff. If you can do that, you win.&quot;

===Military balance===
Deterrence is often directed against state leaders who have specific territorial goals that they seek to attain either by seizing disputed territory in a limited military attack or by occupying disputed territory after the decisive defeat of the adversary&#x27;s armed forces. In either case, the strategic orientation of potential attacking states generally is for the short term and is driven by concerns about military cost and effectiveness. For successful deterrence, defending states need the military capacity to respond quickly and strongly to a range of contingencies. Deterrence often fails if either a defending state or an attacking state underestimates or overestimates the other&#x27;s ability to undertake a particular course of action.

===Signaling and bargaining power===
The central problem for a state that seeks to communicate a credible deterrent threat by diplomatic or military actions is that all defending states have an incentive to act as if they are determined to resist an attack in the hope that the attacking state will back away from military conflict with a seemingly resolved adversary. If all defending states have such incentives, potential attacking states may discount statements made by defending states along with any movement of military forces as merely bluffs. In that regard, rational deterrence theorists have argued that costly signals are required to communicate the credibility of a defending state&#x27;s resolve. Those are actions and statements that clearly increase the risk of a military conflict and also increase the costs of backing down from a deterrent threat. States that bluff are unwilling to cross a certain threshold of threat and military action for fear of committing themselves to an armed conflict.

===Reputations for resolve===
There are three different arguments that have been developed in relation to the role of reputations in influencing deterrence outcomes. The first argument focuses on a defending state&#x27;s past behavior in international disputes and crises, which creates strong beliefs in a potential attacking state about the defending state&#x27;s expected behaviour in future conflicts. The credibilities of a defending state&#x27;s policies are arguably linked over time, and reputations for resolve have a powerful causal impact on an attacking state&#x27;s decision whether to challenge either general or immediate deterrence. The second approach argues that reputations have a limited impact on deterrence outcomes because the credibility of deterrence is heavily determined by the specific configuration of military capabilities, interests at stake, and political constraints faced by a defending state in a given situation of attempted deterrence. The argument of that school of thought is that potential attacking states are not likely to draw strong inferences about a defending states resolve from prior conflicts because potential attacking states do not believe that a defending state&#x27;s past behaviour is a reliable predictor of future behavior. The third approach is a middle ground between the first two approaches and argues that potential attacking states are likely to draw reputational inferences about resolve from the past behaviour of defending states only under certain conditions. The insight is the expectation that decisionmakers use only certain types of information when drawing inferences about reputations, and an attacking state updates and revises its beliefs when a defending state&#x27;s unanticipated behavior cannot be explained by case-specific variables.

An example shows that the problem extends to the perception of the third parties as well as main adversaries and underlies the way in which attempts at deterrence can fail and even backfire if the assumptions about the others&#x27; perceptions are incorrect.

===Interests at stake===
Although costly signaling and bargaining power are more well established arguments in rational deterrence theory, the interests of defending states are not as well known. Attacking states may look beyond the short-term bargaining tactics of a defending state and seek to determine what interests are at stake for the defending state that would justify the risks of a military conflict. The argument is that defending states that have greater interests at stake in a dispute are more resolved to use force and more willing to endure military losses to secure those interests. Even less well-established arguments are the specific interests that are more salient to state leaders such as military interests and economic interests.

Furthermore, Huth argues that both supporters and critics of rational deterrence theory agree that an unfavorable assessment of the domestic and international status quo by state leaders can undermine or severely test the success of deterrence. In a rational choice approach, if the expected utility of not using force is reduced by a declining status quo position, deterrence failure is more likely since the alternative option of using force becomes relatively more attractive.

=== Tripwires ===
International relations scholars Dan Reiter and Paul Poast have argued that so-called &quot;tripwires&quot; do not deter aggression. Tripwires entail that small forces are deployed abroad with the assumption that an attack on them will trigger a greater deployment of forces. Dan Altman has argued that tripwires do work to deter aggression, citing the Western deployment of forces to Berlin in 1948–1949 to deter Soviet aggression as a successful example.

A 2022 study by Brian Blankenship and Erik Lin-Greenberg found that high-resolve, low-capability signals (such as tripwires) were not viewed as more reassuring to allies than low-resolve, high-capability alternatives (such as forces stationed offshore). Their study cast doubt on the reassuring value of tripwires.

==Nuclear deterrence theory==
In 1966, Schelling is prescriptive in outlining the impact of the development of nuclear weapons in the analysis of military power and deterrence. In his analysis, before the widespread use of assured second strike capability, or immediate reprisal, in the form of SSBN submarines, Schelling argues that nuclear weapons give nations the potential to destroy their enemies but also the rest of humanity without drawing immediate reprisal because of the lack of a conceivable defense system and the speed with which nuclear weapons can be deployed. A nation&#x27;s credible threat of such severe damage empowers their deterrence policies and fuels political coercion and military deadlock, which can produce proxy warfare.

According to Kenneth Waltz, there are three requirements for successful nuclear deterrence:

# Part of a state&#x27;s nuclear arsenal must appear to be able to survive an attack by the adversary and be used for a retaliatory second strike
# The state must not respond to false alarms of a strike by the adversary
# The state must maintain command and control

The stability–instability paradox is a key concept in rational deterrence theory. It states that when two countries each have nuclear weapons, the probability of a direct war between them greatly decreases, but the probability of minor or indirect conflicts between them increases. This occurs because rational actors want to avoid nuclear wars, and thus they neither start major conflicts nor allow minor conflicts to escalate into major conflicts—thus making it safe to engage in minor conflicts. For instance, during the Cold War the United States and the Soviet Union never engaged each other in warfare, but fought proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, Angola, the Middle East, Nicaragua and Afghanistan and spent substantial amounts of money and manpower on gaining relative influence over the third world.

Bernard Brodie wrote in 1959 that a credible nuclear deterrent must be always ready. An extended nuclear deterrence guarantee is also called a nuclear umbrella.

Scholars have debated whether having a superior nuclear arsenal provides a deterrent against other nuclear-armed states with smaller arsenals. Matthew Kroenig has argued that states with nuclear superiority are more likely to win nuclear crises, whereas Todd Sechser, Matthew Fuhrmann and David C. Logan have challenged this assertion. A 2023 study found that a state with nuclear weapons is less likely to be targeted by non-nuclear states, but that a state with nuclear weapons is not less likely to target other nuclear states in low-level conflict. A 2022 study by Kyungwon Suh suggests that nuclear superiority may not reduce the likelihood that nuclear opponents will initiate nuclear crises.

Proponents of nuclear deterrence theory argue that newly nuclear-armed states may pose a short- or medium-term risk, but that &quot;nuclear learning&quot; occurs over time as states learn to live with new nuclear-armed states. Mark S. Bell and Nicholas L. Miller have however argued that there is a weak theoretical and empirical basis for notions of &quot;nuclear learning.&quot;

===Stages of US policy of deterrence===
The US policy of deterrence during the Cold War underwent significant variations.

==== Containment ====
The early stages of the Cold War were generally characterized by the containment of communism, an aggressive stance on behalf of the US especially on developing nations under its sphere of influence. The period was characterized by numerous proxy wars throughout most of the globe, particularly Africa, Asia, Central America, and South America. One notable conflict was the Korean War. George F. Kennan, who is taken to be the founder of this policy in his Long Telegram, asserted that he never advocated military intervention, merely economic support, and that his ideas were misinterpreted as espoused by the general public.

==== Détente ====
With the US drawdown from Vietnam, the normalization of US relations with China, and the Sino-Soviet Split, the policy of containment was abandoned and a new policy of détente was established, with peaceful co-existence was sought between the United States and the Soviet Union. Although all of those factors contributed to this shift, the most important factor was probably the rough parity achieved in stockpiling nuclear weapons with the clear capability of mutual assured destruction (MAD). Therefore, the period of détente was characterized by a general reduction in the tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and a thawing of the Cold War, which lasted from the late 1960s until the start of the 1980s. The doctrine of mutual nuclear deterrence then characterized relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and relations with Russia until the onset of the New Cold War in the early 2010s. Since then, relations have been less clear.

==== Reagan era ====
A third shift occurred with US President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s arms build-up during the 1980s. Reagan attempted to justify the policy by concerns of growing Soviet influence in Latin America and the post-1979 revolutionary government of Iran. Similar to the old policy of containment, the US funded several proxy wars, including support for Saddam Hussein of Iraq during the Iran–Iraq War, support for the mujahideen in Afghanistan, who were fighting for independence from the Soviet Union, and several anticommunist movements in Latin America such as the overthrow of the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The funding of the Contras in Nicaragua led to the Iran-Contra Affair, while overt support led to a ruling from the International Court of Justice against the United States in &quot;Nicaragua v. United States&quot;.

The final expression of the full impact of deterrence during the cold war can be seen in the agreement between Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985. They &quot;agreed that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Recognizing that any conflict between the USSR and the U.S. could have catastrophic consequences, they emphasized the importance of preventing any war between them, whether nuclear or conventional. They will not seek to achieve military superiority.&quot;.

While the army was dealing with the breakup of the Soviet Union and the spread of nuclear technology to other nations beyond the United States and Russia, the concept of deterrence took on a broader multinational dimension. The US policy on deterrence after the Cold War was outlined in 1995 in the document called &quot;Essentials of Post–Cold War Deterrence&quot;. It explains that while relations with Russia continue to follow the traditional characteristics of MAD, but the US policy of deterrence towards nations with minor nuclear capabilities should ensure by threats of immense retaliation (or even pre-emptive action) not to threaten the United States, its interests, or allies. The document explains that such threats must also be used to ensure that nations without nuclear technology refrain from developing nuclear weapons and that a universal ban precludes any nation from maintaining chemical or biological weapons. The current tensions with Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs are caused partly by the continuation of the policy of deterrence.

=== Post-Cold War period ===
By the beginning of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, many western hawks expressed the view that deterrence worked in that war but only in one way – in favor of Russia. Former US security advisor, John Bolton, said: Deterrence is working in the Ukraine crisis, just not for the right side. The United States and its allies failed to deter Russia from invading. The purpose of deterrence strategy is to prevent the conflict entirely, and there Washington failed badly. On the other hand, Russian deterrence is enjoying spectacular success. Russia has convinced the West that even a whisper of NATO military action in Ukraine would bring disastrous consequences. Putin threatens, blusters, uses the word “nuclear,” and the West wilts.

When Elon Musk prevented Ukraine from carrying drone attacks on the Russian Black Sea fleet by denying to enable needed Starlink communications in Crimea, Anne Applebaum argued Musk had been deterred by Russia after the country&#x27;s ambassador warned him an attack on Crimea would be met with a nuclear response. Later Ukrainian attacks on the same fleet using a different communications system also caused deterrence, this time to the Russian Navy.

Timo S. Koster who served at NATO as Director of Defence Policy &amp; Capabilities similarly argued: A massacre is taking place in Europe and the strongest military alliance in the world is staying out of it. We are deterred and Russia is not. Philip Breedlove, a retired four-star U.S. Air Force general and a former SACEUR, said that Western fears about nuclear weapons and World War III have left it &quot;fully deterred&quot; and Putin &quot;completely undeterred.&quot; The West have &quot;ceded the initiative to the enemy.&quot; No attempt was made by NATO to deter Moscow with the threat of military force, wondered another expert. To the contrary, it was Russia’s deterrence that proved to be successful.

==Cyber deterrence==
Since the early 2000s, there has been an increased focus on cyber deterrence. Cyber deterrence has two meanings:

# The use of cyber actions to deter other states
# The deterrence of an adversary&#x27;s cyber operations

Scholars have debated how cyber capabilities alter traditional understandings of deterrence, given that it may be harder to attribute responsibility for cyber attacks, the barriers to entry may be lower, the risks and costs may be lower for actors who conduct cyber attacks, it may be harder to signal and interpret intentions, the advantage of offense over defense, and weak actors and non-state actors can develop considerable cyber capabilities. Scholars have also debated the feasibility of launching highly damaging cyber attacks and engaging in destructive cyber warfare, with most scholars expressing skepticism that cyber capabilities have enhanced the ability of states to launch highly destructive attacks. The most prominent cyber attack to date is the Stuxnet attack on Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. By 2019, the only publicly acknowledged case of a cyber attack causing a power outage was the 2015 Ukraine power grid hack.

There are various ways to engage in cyber deterrence:

* Denial: preventing adversaries from achieving military objectives by defending against them
* Punishment: the imposition of costs on the adversary
* Norms: the establishment and maintenance of norms that establish appropriate standards of behavior
* Escalation: raising the probability that costs will be imposed on the adversary
* Entanglement and interdependence: interdependence between actors can have a deterrent effect

There is a risk of unintended escalation in cyberspace due to difficulties in discerning the intent of attackers, and complexities in state-hacker relationships. According to political scientists Joseph Brown and Tanisha Fazal, states frequently neither confirm nor deny responsibility for cyber operations so that they can avoid the escalatory risks (that come with public credit) while also signaling that they have cyber capabilities and resolve (which can be achieved if intelligence agencies and governments believe they were responsible).

According to Lennart Maschmeyer, cyber weapons have limited coercive effectiveness due to a trilemma &quot;whereby speed, intensity, and control are negatively correlated. These constraints pose a trilemma for actors because a gain in one variable tends to produce losses across the other two variables.&quot;

==Intrawar deterrence==
Intrawar deterrence is deterrence within a war context. It means that war has broken out but actors still seek to deter certain forms of behavior. In the words of Caitlin Talmadge, &quot;intra-war deterrence failures... can be thought of as causing wars to get worse in some way.&quot; Examples of intrawar deterrence include deterring adversaries from resorting to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons attacks or attacking civilian populations indiscriminately. Broadly, it involves any prevention of escalation.

==Criticism==
===Deterrence failures===

Deterrence theory has been criticized by numerous scholars for various reasons, the most basic being skepticism that decision makers are rational. A prominent strain of criticism argues that rational deterrence theory is contradicted by frequent deterrence failures, which may be attributed to misperceptions. Here it&#x27;s argued that misestimations of perceived costs and benefits by analysts contribute to deterrence failures, as exemplified in case of Russian invasion of Ukraine. Frozen conflicts can be seen as rewarding aggression.

===Misprediction of behavior===
Scholars have also argued that leaders do not behave in ways that are consistent with the predictions of nuclear deterrence theory. Scholars have also argued that rational deterrence theory does not grapple sufficiently with emotions and psychological biases that make accidents, loss of self-control, and loss of control over others likely. Frank C. Zagare has argued that deterrence theory is logically inconsistent and empirically inaccurate. In place of classical deterrence, rational choice scholars have argued for &quot;perfect deterrence&quot;, which assumes that states may vary in their internal characteristics and especially in the credibility of their threats of retaliation.

===Suicide attacks===
Advocates for nuclear disarmament, such as Global Zero, have criticized nuclear deterrence theory. Sam Nunn, William Perry, Henry Kissinger, and George Shultz have all called upon governments to embrace the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, and created the Nuclear Security Project to advance that agenda. In 2010, the four were featured in a documentary film entitled &quot;Nuclear Tipping Point&quot; where proposed steps to achieve nuclear disarmament. Kissinger has argued, &quot;The classical notion of deterrence was that there was some consequences before which aggressors and evildoers would recoil. In a world of suicide bombers, that calculation doesn&#x27;t operate in any comparable way.&quot; Shultz said, &quot;If you think of the people who are doing suicide attacks, and people like that get a nuclear weapon, they are almost by definition not deterrable.&quot;

===Stronger deterrent===
Paul Nitze argued in 1994 that nuclear weapons were obsolete in the &quot;new world disorder&quot; after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and he advocated reliance on precision guided munitions to secure a permanent military advantage over future adversaries.

===Minimum deterrence===
As opposed to the extreme mutually assured destruction form of deterrence, the concept of minimum deterrence in which a state possesses no more nuclear weapons than is necessary to deter an adversary from attacking is presently the most common form of deterrence practiced by nuclear weapon states, such as China, India, Pakistan, Britain, and France. Pursuing minimal deterrence during arms negotiations between the United States and Russia allows each state to make nuclear stockpile reductions without the state becoming vulnerable, but it has been noted that there comes a point that further reductions may be undesirable, once minimal deterrence is reached, as further reductions beyond that point increase a state&#x27;s vulnerability and provide an incentive for an adversary to expand its nuclear arsenal secretly.

France has developed and maintained its own nuclear deterrent under the belief that the United States will refuse to risk its own cities by assisting Western Europe in a nuclear war.

===Ethical objections===
In the post cold war era, philosophical objections to the reliance upon deterrence theories in general have also been raised on purely ethical grounds. Scholars such as Robert L. Holmes have noted that the implementation of such theories is inconsistent with a fundamental deontological presumption which prohibits the killing of innocent life. Consequently, such theories are prima facie immoral in nature. In addition, he observes that deterrence theories serve to perpetuate a state of mutual assured destruction between nations over time. Holmes further argues that it is therefore both irrational and immoral to utilize a methodology for perpetuating international peace which relies exclusively upon the continuous development of new iterations of the very weapons which it is designed to prohibit.

== History ==

=== First station ===

On 7 May 1872 (12 June in Gregorian calendar), Yokohama Station (original station, now Sakuragichō Station) opened as one of the first railway stations in Japan.

On 11 July 1887, the railway was extended from Yokohama to Kōzu Station. Through trains between Shimbashi Station and Kōzu Station required a switchback at Yokohama Station.
On 1 August 1898, a line bypassing Yokohama Station was opened to avoid the switchback. Through trains stopped at Kanagawa Station or Hodogaya Station instead of Yokohama Station, and shuttle trains connected Yokohama and Hodogaya until Hiranuma Station opened near present-day Hiranumabashi Station on 10 October 1901. Hiranuma Station had no connection to public transport such as trams, so that major part of the passengers for the city continued to use trains that stopped at Yokohama Station.

=== Second station ===

On 15 August 1915, the second Yokohama Station opened close to the present day Takashimachō Station to allow Tōkaidō Main Line trains to call at Yokohama Station. The original Yokohama Station was renamed Sakuragichō Station. JR East uses this date as the opening date of the current Yokohama Station.
The terminal of the Keihin Line (present-day Keihin-Tōhoku Line) had been in Takashimachō since 1914 and was merged with the new station. The government-run electric line was later that year extended to Sakuragichō.

On 1 September 1923, the station was destroyed by a fire in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.
Six days later, the station reopened with a temporary building.
The city of Yokohama and the Ministry of Railways agreed in February 1924 that the station would be relocated.

On 18 May 1928, the Tokyo Yokohama Railway (now the Tokyu Toyoko Line) was extended from its former terminal at Kanagawa Station to the station. The extension line passed through the construction site of the new Yokohama Station of the government railways.

=== Third station ===
On 15 October 1928, the third (current) Yokohama Station opened on the north side of the second station. The Tōkaidō Main Line also moved to its current route, which was the route of the bypass line opened in 1898. The government railways and the Toyoko Line shared the station from the beginning.
On 5 February 1930, the Keihin Electric Railway (now the Keikyu Main Line) was connected to the station.
On 27 December 1933, the Jinchū Railway (now the Sotetsu Main Line) was connected to the station. On 9 December 1957, the north side underground entrance opened. On 1 December 1965, the MARS on-line ticket reservation system was introduced at the station. On 4 September 1976, the Yokohama City Subway Line No. 3 was connected to Yokohama Station. On 7 November 1980, the new east station building and east-west passage opened. On 31 January 2004, The Tōkyū Tōyoko Line platform reopened underground, and on 1 February 2004, the Minatomirai Line opened.

=== 2020 ===
On 26 August 2010, JR East announced the development of a new station building to replace the current West Entrance, tentatively named the . It opened in 2020 before the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics. The development includes a 26-story retail and office building, , on the site of the current West Entrance and a nine-story building to the north-east, , which includes parking and childcare facilities.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2013, the JR East station was used by an average of 406,594 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the busiest JR East station in Kanagawa Prefecture and the fourth-busiest on the JR East network as a whole.

The JR East passenger figures for previous years are as shown below.

Shizuoka Station has four platforms serving six tracks. Two island platforms with Tracks 1–4 serve the Tōkaidō Main Line trains, and long distance night trains. These platforms are connected with the station concourse via an underpass and are also connected at the same level to the Tōkaidō Shinkansen platforms. The Shinkansen station consists of two opposing side platforms serving two tracks, with two central tracks for non-stop trains. The station building has automated ticket machines, TOICA automated turnstiles, and a crewed &quot;Green Window&quot; service counter.

=== Platforms ===



== Adjacent stations ==




==History==

Shizuoka station first opened on February 1, 1889, when the section of the Tōkaidō Main Line connecting Shizuoka with Kōzu was completed. A grand opening ceremony had been planned, but on this day a huge fire destroyed over 1,000 buildings in downtown Shizuoka. Railroad Minister Inoue Masaru cancelled his planned visit, and later the same day, the town around Gotemba Station, also in Shizuoka Prefecture, burned down. The initial Shizuoka Station building was rebuilt in 1907 and again in 1935. The Tōkaidō Shinkansen platforms were opened in 1964. In 1967, freight operations were relocated from Shizuoka Station to Higashi-Shizuoka Station (the present-day Shizuoka Freight Terminal). The station underwent a massive rebuilding program from the late 1970s, with the Tōkaidō Main Line tracks elevated in 1979 to the same level as the Tōkaidō Shinkansen tracks, and the Parche shopping centre/new station building completed in 1981. From 2006 to 2008, major renovations took place inside and around the station, including the underground walkways to and from the station, and the Asty shopping and dining complexes adjoined to the station.

Station numbering was introduced to the section of the Tōkaidō Line operated JR Central in March 2018; Shizuoka Station was assigned station number CA17.

<doc id="735672" wikidata="Q535695" url="?curid=735672" title="Cellular network">
<text>A cellular network or mobile network is a telecommunications network where the link to and from end nodes is wireless and the network is distributed over land areas called cells, each served by at least one fixed-location transceiver (such as a base station). These base stations provide the cell with the network coverage which can be used for transmission of voice, data, and other types of content via radio waves. Each cell&#x27;s coverage area is determined by factors such as the power of the transceiver, the terrain, and the frequency band being used. A cell typically uses a different set of frequencies from neighboring cells, to avoid interference and provide guaranteed service quality within each cell.

When joined together, these cells provide radio coverage over a wide geographic area. This enables numerous devices, including mobile phones, tablets, laptops equipped with mobile broadband modems, and wearable devices such as smartwatches, to communicate with each other and with fixed transceivers and telephones anywhere in the network, via base stations, even if some of the devices are moving through more than one cell during transmission. The design of cellular networks allows for seamless handover, enabling uninterrupted communication when a device moves from one cell to another.

Modern cellular networks utilize advanced technologies such as Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO), beamforming, and small cells to enhance network capacity and efficiency.

Cellular networks offer a number of desirable features:
* More capacity than a single large transmitter, since the same frequency can be used for multiple links as long as they are in different cells
* Mobile devices use less power than a single transmitter or satellite since the cell towers are closer
* Larger coverage area than a single terrestrial transmitter, since additional cell towers can be added indefinitely and are not limited by the horizon
* Capability of utilizing higher frequency signals (and thus more available bandwidth / faster data rates) that are not able to propagate at long distances
* With data compression and multiplexing, several video (including digital video) and audio channels may travel through a higher frequency signal on a single wideband carrier
Major telecommunications providers have deployed voice and data cellular networks over most of the inhabited land area of Earth. This allows mobile phones and other devices to be connected to the public switched telephone network and public Internet access. In addition to traditional voice and data services, cellular networks now support Internet of Things (IoT) applications, connecting devices such as smart meters, vehicles, and industrial sensors.

The evolution of cellular networks from 1G to 5G has progressively introduced faster speeds, lower latency, and support for a larger number of devices, enabling advanced applications in fields such as healthcare, transportation, and smart cities.

Private cellular networks can be used for research or for large organizations and fleets, such as dispatch for local public safety agencies or a taxicab company, as well as for local wireless communications in enterprise and industrial settings such as factories, warehouses, mines, power plants, substations, oil and gas facilities and ports.

== Concept ==
In a cellular radio system, a land area to be supplied with radio service is divided into cells in a pattern dependent on terrain and reception characteristics. These cell patterns roughly take the form of regular shapes, such as hexagons, squares, or circles although hexagonal cells are conventional. Each of these cells is assigned with multiple frequencies (&quot;f&quot;1 – &quot;f&quot;6) which have corresponding radio base stations. The group of frequencies can be reused in other cells, provided that the same frequencies are not reused in adjacent cells, which would cause co-channel interference.

The increased capacity in a cellular network, compared with a network with a single transmitter, comes from the mobile communication switching system developed by Amos Joel of Bell Labs that permitted multiple callers in a given area to use the same frequency by switching calls to the nearest available cellular tower having that frequency available. This strategy is viable because a given radio frequency can be reused in a different area for an unrelated transmission. In contrast, a single transmitter can only handle one transmission for a given frequency. Inevitably, there is some level of interference from the signal from the other cells which use the same frequency. Consequently, there must be at least one cell gap between cells which reuse the same frequency in a standard frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) system.

Consider the case of a taxi company, where each radio has a manually operated channel selector knob to tune to different frequencies. As drivers move around, they change from channel to channel. The drivers are aware of which frequency approximately covers some area. When they do not receive a signal from the transmitter, they try other channels until finding one that works. The taxi drivers only speak one at a time when invited by the base station operator. This is a form of time-division multiple access (TDMA).

== History ==

The idea to establish a standard cellular phone network was first proposed on December 11, 1947. This proposal was put forward by Douglas H. Ring, a Bell Labs engineer, in an internal memo suggesting the development of a cellular telephone system by AT&amp;T.

The first commercial cellular network, the 1G generation, was launched in Japan by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) in 1979, initially in the metropolitan area of Tokyo. However, NTT did not initially commercialize the system; the early launch was motivated by an effort to understand a practical cellular system rather than by an interest to profit from it. In 1981, the Nordic Mobile Telephone system was created as the first network to cover an entire country. The network was released in 1981 in Sweden and Norway, then in early 1982 in Finland and Denmark. Televerket, a state-owned corporation responsible for telecommunications in Sweden, launched the system.

In September 1981, Jan Stenbeck, a financier and businessman, launched Comvik, a new Swedish telecommunications company. Comvik was the first European telecommunications firm to challenge the state&#x27;s telephone monopoly on the industry. According to some sources, Comvik was the first to launch a commercial automatic cellular system before Televerket launched its own in October 1981. However, at the time of the new network’s release, the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority threatened to shut down the system after claiming that the company had used an unlicensed automatic gear that could interfere with its own networks. In December 1981, Sweden awarded Comvik with a license to operate its own automatic cellular network in the spirit of market competition.

The Bell System had developed cellular technology since 1947, and had cellular networks in operation in Chicago, Illinois, and Dallas, Texas, prior to 1979; however, regulatory battles delayed AT&amp;T&#x27;s deployment of cellular service to 1983, when its Regional Holding Company Illinois Bell first provided cellular service.

First-generation cellular network technology continued to expand its reach to the rest of the world. In 1990, Millicom Inc., a telecommunications service provider, strategically partnered with Comvik’s international cellular operations to become Millicom International Cellular SA. The company went on to establish a 1G systems foothold in Ghana, Africa under the brand name Mobitel. In 2006, the company’s Ghana operations were renamed to Tigo.

The wireless revolution began in the early 1990s, leading to the transition from analog to digital networks. The MOSFET invented at Bell Labs between 1955 and 1960, was adapted for cellular networks by the early 1990s, with the wide adoption of power MOSFET, LDMOS (RF amplifier), and RF CMOS (RF circuit) devices leading to the development and proliferation of digital wireless mobile networks.

The first commercial digital cellular network, the 2G generation, was launched in 1991. This sparked competition in the sector as the new operators challenged the incumbent 1G analog network operators.

== Cell signal encoding ==
To distinguish signals from several different transmitters, a number of channel access methods have been developed, including frequency-division multiple access (FDMA, used by analog and D-AMPS systems), time-division multiple access (TDMA, used by GSM) and code-division multiple access (CDMA, first used for PCS, and the basis of 3G).

With FDMA, the transmitting and receiving frequencies used by different users in each cell are different from each other. Each cellular call was assigned a pair of frequencies (one for base to mobile, the other for mobile to base) to provide full-duplex operation. The original AMPS systems had 666 channel pairs, 333 each for the CLEC &quot;A&quot; system and ILEC &quot;B&quot; system. The number of channels was expanded to 416 pairs per carrier, but ultimately the number of RF channels limits the number of calls that a cell site could handle. FDMA is a familiar technology to telephone companies, which used frequency-division multiplexing to add channels to their point-to-point wireline plants before time-division multiplexing rendered FDM obsolete.

With TDMA, the transmitting and receiving time slots used by different users in each cell are different from each other. TDMA typically uses digital signaling to store and forward bursts of voice data that are fit into time slices for transmission, and expanded at the receiving end to produce a somewhat normal-sounding voice at the receiver. TDMA must introduce latency (time delay) into the audio signal. As long as the latency time is short enough that the delayed audio is not heard as an echo, it is not problematic. TDMA is a familiar technology for telephone companies, which used time-division multiplexing to add channels to their point-to-point wireline plants before packet switching rendered FDM obsolete.

The principle of CDMA is based on spread spectrum technology developed for military use during World War II and improved during the Cold War into direct-sequence spread spectrum that was used for early CDMA cellular systems and Wi-Fi. DSSS allows multiple simultaneous phone conversations to take place on a single wideband RF channel, without needing to channelize them in time or frequency. Although more sophisticated than older multiple access schemes (and unfamiliar to legacy telephone companies because it was not developed by Bell Labs), CDMA has scaled well to become the basis for 3G cellular radio systems.

Other available methods of multiplexing such as MIMO, a more sophisticated version of antenna diversity, combined with active beamforming provides much greater spatial multiplexing ability compared to original AMPS cells, that typically only addressed one to three unique spaces. Massive MIMO deployment allows much greater channel reuse, thus increasing the number of subscribers per cell site, greater data throughput per user, or some combination thereof. Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) modems offer an increasing number of bits per symbol, allowing more users per megahertz of bandwidth (and decibels of SNR), greater data throughput per user, or some combination thereof.

== Frequency reuse ==
The key characteristic of a cellular network is the ability to reuse frequencies to increase both coverage and capacity. As described above, adjacent cells must use different frequencies, however, there is no problem with two cells sufficiently far apart operating on the same frequency, provided the masts and cellular network users&#x27; equipment do not transmit with too much power.

The elements that determine frequency reuse are the reuse distance and the reuse factor. The reuse distance, &quot;D&quot; is calculated as

:formula_1,

where &quot;R&quot; is the cell radius and &quot;N&quot; is the number of cells per cluster. Cells may vary in radius from . The boundaries of the cells can also overlap between adjacent cells and large cells can be divided into smaller cells.

The frequency reuse factor is the rate at which the same frequency can be used in the network. It is &quot;1/K&quot; (or &quot;K&quot; according to some books) where &quot;K&quot; is the number of cells which cannot use the same frequencies for transmission. Common values for the frequency reuse factor are 1/3, 1/4, 1/7, 1/9 and 1/12 (or 3, 4, 7, 9 and 12, depending on notation).

In case of &quot;N&quot; sector antennas on the same base station site, each with different direction, the base station site can serve N different sectors. &quot;N&quot; is typically 3. A reuse pattern of &quot;N/K&quot; denotes a further division in frequency among &quot;N&quot; sector antennas per site. Some current and historical reuse patterns are 3/7 (North American AMPS), 6/4 (Motorola NAMPS), and 3/4 (GSM).

If the total available bandwidth is &quot;B&quot;, each cell can only use a number of frequency channels corresponding to a bandwidth of &quot;B/K&quot;, and each sector can use a bandwidth of &quot;B/NK&quot;.

Code-division multiple access-based systems use a wider frequency band to achieve the same rate of transmission as FDMA, but this is compensated for by the ability to use a frequency reuse factor of 1, for example using a reuse pattern of 1/1. In other words, adjacent base station sites use the same frequencies, and the different base stations and users are separated by codes rather than frequencies. While &quot;N&quot; is shown as 1 in this example, that does not mean the CDMA cell has only one sector, but rather that the entire cell bandwidth is also available to each sector individually.

Recently also orthogonal frequency-division multiple access based systems such as LTE are being deployed with a frequency reuse of 1. Since such systems do not spread the signal across the frequency band, 
inter-cell radio resource management is important to coordinate resource allocation between different cell sites and to limit the inter-cell interference. There are various means of inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) already defined in the standard. Coordinated scheduling, multi-site MIMO or multi-site beamforming are other examples for inter-cell radio resource management that might be standardized in the future.

== Directional antennas ==
Cell towers frequently use a directional signal to improve reception in higher-traffic areas. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) limits omnidirectional cell tower signals to 100 watts of power. If the tower has directional antennas, the FCC allows the cell operator to emit up to 500 watts of effective radiated power (ERP).

Although the original cell towers created an even, omnidirectional signal, were at the centers of the cells and were omnidirectional, a cellular map can be redrawn with the cellular telephone towers located at the corners of the hexagons where three cells converge. Each tower has three sets of directional antennas aimed in three different directions with 120 degrees for each cell (totaling 360 degrees) and receiving/transmitting into three different cells at different frequencies. This provides a minimum of three channels, and three towers for each cell and greatly increases the chances of receiving a usable signal from at least one direction.

The numbers in the illustration are channel numbers, which repeat every 3 cells. Large cells can be subdivided into smaller cells for high volume areas.

Cell phone companies also use this directional signal to improve reception along highways and inside buildings like stadiums and arenas.

== Broadcast messages and paging ==
Practically every cellular system has some kind of broadcast mechanism. This can be used directly for distributing information to multiple mobiles. Commonly, for example in mobile telephony systems, the most important use of broadcast information is to set up channels for one-to-one communication between the mobile transceiver and the base station. This is called &quot;paging&quot;. The three different paging procedures generally adopted are sequential, parallel and selective paging.

The details of the process of paging vary somewhat from network to network, but normally we know a limited number of cells where the phone is located (this group of cells is called a Location Area in the GSM or UMTS system, or Routing Area if a data packet session is involved; in LTE, cells are grouped into Tracking Areas). Paging takes place by sending the broadcast message to all of those cells. Paging messages can be used for information transfer. This happens in pagers, in CDMA systems for sending SMS messages, and in the UMTS system where it allows for low downlink latency in packet-based connections.

In LTE/4G, the Paging procedure is initiated by the MME when data packets need to be delivered to the UE.

Paging types supported by the MME are:

* Basic.
* SGs_CS and SGs_PS.
* QCI_1 through QCI_9.

== Movement from cell to cell and handing over ==
In a primitive taxi system, when the taxi moved away from a first tower and closer to a second tower, the taxi driver manually switched from one frequency to another as needed. If communication was interrupted due to a loss of a signal, the taxi driver asked the base station operator to repeat the message on a different frequency.

In a cellular system, as the distributed mobile transceivers move from cell to cell during an ongoing continuous communication, switching from one cell frequency to a different cell frequency is done electronically without interruption and without a base station operator or manual switching. This is called the handover or handoff. Typically, a new channel is automatically selected for the mobile unit on the new base station which will serve it. The mobile unit then automatically switches from the current channel to the new channel and communication continues.

The exact details of the mobile system&#x27;s move from one base station to the other vary considerably from system to system (see the example below for how a mobile phone network manages handover).

== Mobile phone network ==

The most common example of a cellular network is a mobile phone (cell phone) network. A mobile phone is a portable telephone which receives or makes calls through a cell site (base station) or transmitting tower. Radio waves are used to transfer signals to and from the cell phone.

Modern mobile phone networks use cells because radio frequencies are a limited, shared resource. Cell-sites and handsets change frequency under computer control and use low power transmitters so that the usually limited number of radio frequencies can be simultaneously used by many callers with less interference.

A cellular network is used by the mobile phone operator to achieve both coverage and capacity for their subscribers. Large geographic areas are split into smaller cells to avoid line-of-sight signal loss and to support a large number of active phones in that area. All of the cell sites are connected to telephone exchanges (or switches), which in turn connect to the public telephone network.

In cities, each cell site may have a range of up to approximately , while in rural areas, the range could be as much as . It is possible that in clear open areas, a user may receive signals from a cell site away. In rural areas with low-band coverage and tall towers, basic voice and messaging service may reach , with limitations on bandwidth and number of simultaneous calls. 
Since almost all mobile phones use cellular technology, including GSM, CDMA, and AMPS (analog), the term &quot;cell phone&quot; is in some regions, notably the US, used interchangeably with &quot;mobile phone&quot;. However, satellite phones are mobile phones that do not communicate directly with a ground-based cellular tower but may do so indirectly by way of a satellite.

There are a number of different digital cellular technologies, including: Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), cdmaOne, CDMA2000, Evolution-Data Optimized (EV-DO), Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT), Digital AMPS (IS-136/TDMA), and Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN). The transition from existing analog to the digital standard followed a very different path in Europe and the US. As a consequence, multiple digital standards surfaced in the US, while Europe and many countries converged towards the GSM standard.

=== Structure of the mobile phone cellular network ===
A simple view of the cellular mobile-radio network consists of the following:

* A network of radio base stations forming the base station subsystem.
* The core circuit switched network for handling voice calls and text
* A packet switched network for handling mobile data
* The public switched telephone network to connect subscribers to the wider telephony network

This network is the foundation of the GSM system network. There are many functions that are performed by this network in order to make sure customers get the desired service including mobility management, registration, call set-up, and handover.

Any phone connects to the network via an RBS (Radio Base Station) at a corner of the corresponding cell which in turn connects to the Mobile switching center (MSC). The MSC provides a connection to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The link from a phone to the RBS is called an &quot;uplink&quot; while the other way is termed &quot;downlink&quot;.

Radio channels effectively use the transmission medium through the use of the following multiplexing and access schemes: frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), time-division multiple access (TDMA), code-division multiple access (CDMA), and space-division multiple access (SDMA).

=== Small cells ===

Small cells, which have a smaller coverage area than base stations, are categorised as follows:
* Microcell -&gt; less than 2 kilometres,
* Picocell -&gt; less than 200 metres,
* Femtocell -&gt; around 10 metres,
* Attocell -&gt; 1–4 metres

=== Cellular handover in mobile phone networks ===

As the phone user moves from one cell area to another cell while a call is in progress, the mobile station will search for a new channel to attach to in order not to drop the call. Once a new channel is found, the network will command the mobile unit to switch to the new channel and at the same time switch the call onto the new channel.

With CDMA, multiple CDMA handsets share a specific radio channel. The signals are separated by using a pseudonoise code (PN code) that is specific to each phone. As the user moves from one cell to another, the handset sets up radio links with multiple cell sites (or sectors of the same site) simultaneously. This is known as &quot;soft handoff&quot; because, unlike with traditional cellular technology, there is no one defined point where the phone switches to the new cell.

In IS-95 inter-frequency handovers and older analog systems such as NMT it will typically be impossible to test the target channel directly while communicating. In this case, other techniques have to be used such as pilot beacons in IS-95. This means that there is almost always a brief break in the communication while searching for the new channel followed by the risk of an unexpected return to the old channel.

If there is no ongoing communication or the communication can be interrupted, it is possible for the mobile unit to spontaneously move from one cell to another and then notify the base station with the strongest signal.

=== Cellular frequency choice in mobile phone networks ===

The effect of frequency on cell coverage means that different frequencies serve better for different uses. Low frequencies, such as 450  MHz NMT, serve very well for countryside coverage. GSM 900 (900 MHz) is suitable for light urban coverage. GSM 1800 (1.8 GHz) starts to be limited by structural walls. UMTS, at 2.1 GHz is quite similar in coverage to GSM 1800.

Higher frequencies are a disadvantage when it comes to coverage, but it is a decided advantage when it comes to capacity. Picocells, covering e.g. one floor of a building, become possible, and the same frequency can be used for cells which are practically neighbors.

Cell service area may also vary due to interference from transmitting systems, both within and around that cell. This is true especially in CDMA based systems. The receiver requires a certain signal-to-noise ratio, and the transmitter should not send with too high transmission power in view to not cause interference with other transmitters. As the receiver moves away from the transmitter, the power received decreases, so the power control algorithm of the transmitter increases the power it transmits to restore the level of received power. As the interference (noise) rises above the received power from the transmitter, and the power of the transmitter cannot be increased anymore, the signal becomes corrupted and eventually unusable. In CDMA-based systems, the effect of interference from other mobile transmitters in the same cell on coverage area is very marked and has a special name, &quot;cell breathing&quot;.

One can see examples of cell coverage by studying some of the coverage maps provided by real operators on their web sites or by looking at independently crowdsourced maps such as Opensignal or CellMapper. In certain cases they may mark the site of the transmitter; in others, it can be calculated by working out the point of strongest coverage.

A cellular repeater is used to extend cell coverage into larger areas. They range from wideband repeaters for consumer use in homes and offices to smart or digital repeaters for industrial needs.

<doc id="735675" wikidata="Q801437" url="?curid=735675" title="Shin-Yokohama Station">
<text>is a major interchange railway station in Yokohama, Japan, jointly operated by Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), East Japan Railway Company (JR East), Yokohama City Transportation Bureau, Sagami Railway (Sotetsu), and Tokyu Railways (Tokyu).

==Lines==
Shin-Yokohama Station is served by the Tōkaidō Shinkansen, Yokohama Line, Yokohama Municipal Subway Blue Line, Sōtetsu Shin-yokohama Line, and Tōkyū Shin-yokohama Line.

==Station layout==
The JR station consists of an island platform at ground level serving the Yokohama Line, with two elevated island platforms for the shinkansen tracks overhead. The shinkansen platforms 2 and 3 have safety fences, as some trains passed non-stop through the station prior to 2008. The JR Central portion of the station includes a &quot;Midori no Madoguchi&quot; staffed ticket office. Additionally, the JR East portion of the station includes reserved seat ticket vending machines.

The Municipal Subway, Tōkyū Railways and Sagami Railway (Sōtetsu) share an underground integral concourse, which forms a cross shape. The Municipal Subway owns the northwest to southeast corridor, which provides three separate sets of ticket gates, with the northwest (so-called the &quot;Nissan Stadium ticket gate&quot;) and central paid areas providing elevators for barrier-free access to the subway Blue Line platform level which is one story below the underground concourse. The Sōtetsu-Tōkyū parts of the concourse lie directly below and align with the . The northeast concourse is managed by Tōkyū, while the southwest is managed by Sōtetsu. The platform level of Sōtetsu–Tōkyū Link Line is three stories below the integral concourse. Only the southwest concourse managed by Sōtetsu has elevators for the Sōtetsu–Tōkyū platform level. Exits 1 and 5A on the southern side of the concourse are closer to the JR concourse.

===Sōtetsu–Tōkyū Link Line platforms===
Platforms 2 and 3 share the same track which is primarily for southbound trains which terminate at this station or emergency docking. On weekdays only, 1 midnight train departs from platform no.1 for .

==History==

Real estate agents purchased the private property in the area by telling residents and local government officials that the land was needed to build a Nissan/Ford motor vehicle factory which would provide increased employment. Actually, however, the agents were in league with JNR and national politicians from the LDP party to acquire the land for the proposed station, which was not disclosed to the public at this time. The subterfuge was subsequently exposed in a novel and popular film called . The police opened several investigations, but the suspected agents, JNR employees, and political staffers fled the country until the statute of limitations on the alleged crimes expired.

Shin-Yokohama Station opened on 1 October 1964, with the opening of the Tokaido Shinkansen. At the time, the surrounding area was completely rural, and the site was selected as it was the intersection of the Tōkaidō Shinkansen tracks with the existing Yokohama Line. The station was connected to the Yokohama Municipal Subway system on 14 March 1985. With the privatization of JNR on 1 April 1987, the JNR portion of the station came under the operational control of JR East. The station building was remodeled in 1998.

Station numbering was introduced to the Yokohama Line platforms 20 August 2016 with Shin-Yokohama being assigned station number JH16.

===Sōtetsu–Tōkyū Link Line===
The Sōtetsu–Tōkyū jointly operated Shin-yokohama Station opened on 18 March 2023 is one of the major infrastructures of the Eastern Kanagawa Rail Link project to improve the regional access to the Shin-Yokohama Shinkansen station by rail, which was previously only accessible via the JR Yokohama Line and Municipal Subway Blue Line. As a response to the new railways, JR Tokai started a new limited Nozomi service departs from Shin-Yokohama for and on the same day as the opening of the Sōtetsu–Tōkyū Link Line.

Because the Sōtetsu–Tōkyū platform level is directly 2-story underneath the Municipal Subway Blue Line platform, the subway platforms were underpinned to fortify the foundation. The operation of the subway Blue Line was not obstructed during the construction of the new station. All the involved construction parties were commended by the Japan Society of Civil Engineers in 2020 for commencing such a difficult task.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2012, the JR East station was used by an average of 57,439 passengers daily (boarding passengers only). The JR East passenger figures for previous years are as shown below.

==Surrounding area==
The Nissan Stadium (formerly International Stadium Yokohama), the largest stadium in Japan with a capacity of 72,327 seats, was host to the 2002 FIFA World Cup final match and is the home of the Yokohama F Marinos soccer team. The Nissan Stadium, Yokohama Arena, and Yokohama Rosai Hospital are each about a 10-minute walk from the station. The Shin-Yokohama Raumen Museum is about a 5-minute walk from the station.

<text>The Wilson River, about long, flows from the Northern Oregon Coast Range to Tillamook Bay in the U.S. state of Oregon. Formed by the confluence of its Devil&#x27;s Lake Fork and its South Fork, it runs generally west through the Tillamook State Forest to its mouth near the city of Tillamook. It is one of five rivers—the Tillamook, the Trask, the Wilson, the Kilchis, and the Miami—that flow into the bay.

== Course ==
The river rises in the Tillamook State Forest in the mountains of northeastern Tillamook County. The river&#x27;s North Fork rises in northern Tillamook County and flows south. Its South Fork rises in eastern Tillamook County and western Washington County and flows west to merge with Devils Lake Fork. Further downstream, the Wilson River receives the North Fork near Lees Camp. It then flows southwest to Tillamook, entering the southeast end of Tillamook Bay about northwest of the city. The mouth of the river is about north of the mouth of the Trask River and slightly south of the mouth of the Kilchis River. Oregon Route 6, also known as the Wilson River Highway, runs parallel to the river and links the Tualatin Valley and the Portland metropolitan area with the Oregon Coast.

===Discharge===
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) monitors the flow of the Wilson River at a stream gauge from the mouth of the river. The average flow at this gauge is . This is from a drainage area of , about 83 percent of the total Wilson River watershed. The maximum flow recorded there was on November 6, 2006, and the minimum flow was on September 5, 1973, although it might have been less for a short while after a landslide on January 31, 1965.

===Floods===
The Wilson River was part of the Willamette Valley flood of 1996 when it rose to 19.51 inches on February 8, damaging roads and farms and houses in Tillamook. Since then it has risen to its highest recorded reading of 22.84 inches on November 7, 2006.

== Fishing ==

According to &quot;Fishing Oregon: An Angler&#x27;s Guide to Oregon&quot;, the Wilson River is &quot;one of the state&#x27;s best steelhead and Chinook salmon fisheries&quot;. Spring Chinook average about , fall Chinook from , and Steelhead from . County-owned boat launches on the lower reaches and public access via Route 6 through the Tillamook State Forest make the river easily accessible to anglers. State regulations govern the seasons and methods of fishing.

<doc id="735680" wikidata="Q375061" url="?curid=735680" title="Mishima Station">
<text>is a railway station in the city of Mishima, Shizuoka, Japan, operated by the Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central). It is also a union station with the Izuhakone Railway. The station was also a freight terminal of the Japan Freight Railway Company (JR Freight), although freight operations are now only on an occasional basis.

Japanese writer Yukio Mishima was given his pen name from this station, since his editors were passing through on the way to a meeting with him. (&#x27;Yukio&#x27; came from the Japanese word for &#x27;snow&#x27;, which the editors saw on Mount Fuji from the train.)

==Lines==
Mishima Station is served by the JR Central Tōkaidō Shinkansen and Tōkaidō Main Line and is 120.7 kilometers from Tokyo Station. The station is also the northern terminal station of the Izuhakone Railway Sunzu Line.

==Station layout==
JR Mishima Station has two island platforms serving tracks 1 to 4. Track 2 and Track 3 are the primary tracks for the Tōkaidō Main Line, with Tracks 1 and 4 used for through passage of express trains. The Tōkaidō Shinkansen uses Tracks 5 and 6, which are served by a separate island platform. The adjacent Izuhakone Railway has one side platform and two bay platforms serving Tracks 7, 8 and 9. All platforms are connected by an underpass to a central concourse leading to the station building. The station building has automated ticket machines, TOICA automated turnstiles and a staffed ticket office.

===Platforms===


==History==

The original Mishima Station was opened on 15 June 1896 in the town of Nagaizumi. However, with the completion of the Tanna Tunnel between Atami and Numazu, this station was renamed Shimo-Togari Station, and a new Mishima Station was opened at its present location on December 1, 1934. The terminus of the Izuhakone Railway was also relocated to Mishima Station at this time. On April 25, 1969, Tōkaidō Shinkansen services began serving Mishima Station. Regularly scheduled freight service was discontinued in 1974, however, private freight services to the Toray Industries Mishima plant continued on a spur line until 2007. In 2008, Mishima Station was extensively remodeled, and an ASTY shopping complex was opened at the station.

Station numbering was introduced to the section of the Tōkaidō Line operated JR Central in March 2018; Mishima Station was assigned station number CA02.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2017, the JR portion of the station was used by an average of 30,859 passengers daily (boarding passengers only) and the Izuhakone portion of the station was used by 8,599 passengers daily (boarding passengers only).

==Accidents==

On 27 December 1995, the first and so far only fatality caused by the Tōkaidō Shinkansen occurred at Mishima Station when Yusuke Kawarazaki, a 17-year-old high school student, got caught in a car door, and was dragged down the platform by the leaving train.

<doc id="735681" wikidata="Q2717858" url="?curid=735681" title="SMA connector">
<text>SMA (&quot;SubMiniature version A&quot;) connectors are semi-precision coaxial RF connectors developed in the 1960s as a minimal connector interface for coaxial cable with a screw-type coupling mechanism. The connector has a 50 Ω impedance. SMA was originally designed for use from DC (0 Hz) to 12 GHz, however this has been extended over time and variants are available to 18 GHz and 26.5 GHz. There are also mechanically compatible connectors such as the K-connector which operate up to 40 GHz. The SMA connector is most commonly used in microwave systems, hand-held radio and mobile telephone antennas and, more recently, with WiFi antenna systems and USB software-defined radio dongles. It is also commonly used in radio astronomy, particularly at higher frequencies (5 GHz+).

==Connector design==
The interface dimensions for SMA connectors are listed in MIL-STD-348. The SMA connector employs a  inch diameter, 36-thread-per-inch threaded barrel. The male is equipped with a hex nut measuring  inch (0.3125 inch / 7.9 mm) across opposite flats, thus taking the same wrench as a #6 SAE hex nut.

A &quot;standard-polarity&quot; SMA male connector has a 0.9mm diameter center pin surrounded by barrel with inside threads, and the standard SMA female connector has a center sleeve surrounded by a barrel with outside threads. The centre pin is the same diameter as the centre of RG402 Coax so that connections can be made with no discontinuity, forming the pin from the coax itself. As with most other connectors, the gender assignment corresponds to the innermost electrical component. There are also &quot;reverse-polarity&quot; (&quot;RP&quot;) SMA connectors in which the pin and sleeve are swapped so that the &quot;male&quot; RP-SMA has a center sleeve surrounded by an inside-threaded barrel, and the &quot;female&quot; RP-SMA has a center pin and an outside-threaded barrel. See below for a fuller description.
The SMA connector uses a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) dielectric that contacts along the mating plane. Variability in the construction and the mating of the connectors limits the repeatability of the connector impedance. For that reason and that they are just rated for a limited number of connection cycles, an SMA connector is not usually a good choice for metrological applications.

SMA connectors are rated for up to 500 mating cycles, but to achieve this it is necessary to properly torque the connector when making the connection. A  inch torque wrench is required for this, set to 3–5 in·lbf (0.3 to 0.6 N·m) for brass, and 7–10 in·lbf (0.8 to 1.1 N·m) for stainless steel connectors. Flats are sometimes also provided on the cable side of the connector assembly so that a second wrench can be used to prevent it from rotating and damaging the joint to the cable. It is also advisable to inspect and clean out loose debris from the internal surfaces with compressed air or a gas duster can before mating.

SMA connectors must not be confused with the standard household 75-ohm type F coax connector (diameters: male  inch (11 mm) circular or hex; female  inch (9.5 mm) external threads), as there is only about a 2 mm difference overall in the specifications. Type F cannot be mated with SMA connectors without the use of an adapter.

==Variations==
The SMA connector is typically rated for mode-free operation from DC to 18 GHz, though some proprietary versions are rated to 26.5 GHz. For performance above this, other SMA-like connectors are used. These include the 3.5 mm connector, rated to 34 GHz, and the 2.92 mm (also known as 2.9 mm, K type, or SMK), good up to 46 GHz. These connectors keep the same outside thread as the SMA, so they can potentially be cross-mated, but the precision connector can be easily damaged when mating with low-grade SMA connectors. The precision versions use an air dielectric with appropriately scaled center conductors.

Beyond 46 GHz, the 2.4 mm, 1.85 mm (also known as V type) and 1.0 mm (also known as W type) connectors exist. These are similar to the SMA connector, but with the geometries incompatibly scaled, and a metric thread to prevent accidental intermating. (But 2.4 mm and 1.85 mm connectors are compatible to each other.) These offer mode-free operation to 50, 65, and 110 GHz respectively.

==Reverse polarity==

Reverse-polarity SMA (RP-SMA or RSMA) is a variation of the SMA connector specification that reverses the gender of the interface, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The term &quot;reverse polarity&quot; here refers only to the gender of the connector&#x27;s contact pin, not in any way to the signal polarity.

The female RP-SMA connector has the same external housing as a standard or conventional female SMA connector, which consists of an outer shell with the threads on the outside; however, the center receptacle is replaced by a male pin.

Similarly, the RP-SMA male has threads on the inside like a conventional male, but has a center receptacle instead of the male pin in the middle. Normal SMA connectors are incompatible with RP-SMA connectors.
Occasionally, the opposite convention is used to designate the gender of an RP connector: In this situation the female connector has a socket (or sleeve) contact and threads on the outside. Users should take care to check drawings and specifications carefully.

Wi-Fi equipment manufacturers have widely used RP-SMA connectors to comply with specific national regulations, such as those from the FCC, which are designed to prevent consumers from connecting antennas that provide additional gain and therefore breach Part 15 compliance. However, by 2000, the FCC regarded the connectors as readily available, though delaying its ruling indefinitely. As of 2018, leading manufacturers such as Netgear and Linksys are still using RP-SMA connectors on their Wi-Fi equipment.

<doc id="735703" wikidata="Q7270572" url="?curid=735703" title="Queen of All Saints Basilica">
<text>Queen of All Saints [[Basilica]] is a historic church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago located at 6280 North Sauganash Avenue in Chicago&#x27;s upper middle-class Sauganash neighborhood. Along with St. Hyacinth and Our Lady of Sorrows it is one of three minor basilicas in Chicago, Illinois.

==History==

In 1929 the Calvert Club, a Catholic area fraternal organization, pushed to establish a church in the Sauganash area. Its members petitioned the Archbishop of Chicago, Cardinal George Mundelein, who granted the request and appointed Father Francis A. Ryan to be pastor of the new parish dedicated to Queen of All Saints. The initial church structure was a portable wood-frame church that had previously served as St. Giles Church in nearby Oak Park. It was relocated to the northwest corner of Peterson and Knox Avenues and dedicated in June 1929 as Queen of All Saints Church. The area filled with residential developments after World War II, and first attracted Irish and German immigrants and their descendants. The Queen of All Saints School was founded in 1932 and like the church, has an enrollment largely of Irish and Germanic descent. On March 26, 1962, Pope John XXIII elevated the church to the dignity of a basilica.

==Architecture==
The church, designed in a Neo-Gothic style by Meyer and Cook, was completed in 1960. The large window over the choir loft features eight different shrines of the Virgin Mary: Our Lady of Czestochowa, Our Lady of Knock, Our Lady of Einsiedeln, Our Lady of the Snows, Our Lady of La Salette, Our Lady of Guadalupe, Our Lady of Lourdes and Our Lady of Fatima. This display alludes to the theme of the universality of the Catholic Church by highlighting that although these shrines are particular to a certain country or culture, the Cult of the Virgin Mary bridges over all these barriers, bringing together the different ethnic groups living in Sauganash area of Forest Glen. The original circa 1930s organ was replaced in 2006 due to its poor condition from age and an act of vandalism in the 1970s. The new instrument is a three-manual, 60-rank opus by Berghaus Pipe Organ Builders of Bellwood, Illinois.

==History==
Toyohashi Station opened 1 September 1888. The privately owned Toyokawa Railway began operations to Toyohashi on 15 July 15 1897, but renamed its terminus in 1899 to differentiate itself from the government railway system. The station building was rebuilt in 1916 and again in 1927. The Aichi Electric Railway&#x27;s Toyohashi Line began operations to the Yoshida Station side of the facility on 1 June 1927. This line became part of Meitetsu on 1 August 1935, and is now the Nagoya Main Line. The Toyokawa Railway was nationalized on 1 August 1943, becoming the Iida Line, and the usage of ‘Yoshida Station’ was dropped. The station was destroyed in the Toyohashi Air Raid of 20 June 1945, during World War II.

After the war, the JGR became the Japanese National Railways (JNR), and a new station was completed in 1950. The Tokaido Shinkansen opened on 1 October 1964. A new station building was completed in 1970.

With the privatization and dissolution of JNR on 1 April 1987, the station came under the control of JR Central. A shopping center and a hotel were added to the station building complex in 1997.

Station numbering was introduced to the section of the Tōkaidō Line operated JR Central as well as the Iida Line in March 2018; Toyohashi Station was assigned station number CA42 for the Tōkaidō Line and CD00 for the Iida Line.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2017, the JR portion of the station was used by an average of 29,045 passengers daily (arriving passengers only) and the Meitetsu portion by 17,479.

== Station history==
When the Tokaido Shinkansen opened, the distance between Toyohashi Station and Nagoya Station was the second-longest on the route of the line. In 1969, the mayors of Okazaki, Toyota, Anjō, Gamagōri, Nishio, Hekinan, Isshiki, Kira, Kōta, Hazu, Nukata, and Otowa submitted the petition of establishing in Kota.

These cities and towns formed the &quot;Alliance for Mikawa Station&quot;. Kōta town subsequently recommended Ashinoya near Kōda Station. Okazaki city recommended Shōna-chō, Okazaki, Anjō city recommended Furui-chō near Hekikai Furui Station, and Nihongi-chō where the Tōkaidō Shinkansen and Tōkaidō Main Line intersect as possible candidate locations. The alliance entrusted the decision to the Aichi prefectural government. On January 5, 1984, the prefectural government decided to build the station in Nihongi, Anjō. Construction work started on July 29, 1985, and the station was opened on March 13, 1988.

Station numbering was introduced to the section of the Tōkaidō Line operated JR Central in March 2018; Mikawa-Anjō Station was assigned station number CA55.

<text>Abdel Aziz Issa Abdul-Mohsin Al-Muqrin (; ; also &quot;Abd al-Aziz al-Moqrin&quot; and other transliterations), alias Abu Hajr (ابو هاجر) and Abu Hazim, (1972 – 18 June 2004), was the leader of the militant Jihadist group al-Qaeda in Saudi Arabia. He succeeded Khaled Ali Hajj, when the latter was killed by Saudi security forces in March 2004. Al-Muqrin had trained with Osama bin Laden&#x27;s Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.

Al-Muqrin lived in Riyadh&#x27;s Al-Suwaidi District, home to many Saudi extremists.

==Life==
Al-Muqrin was born to middle-class parents in Riyadh and was a high school dropout. He married at the age of 19 and had one daughter. He left his wife in about 1988 to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan and later fought in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the 1990s he ran guns from Spain to Algeria. Most of his training occurred in jihadist camps in Afghanistan. He was reported to have fought against Ethiopian forces in the Ogaden.

In 1995 he was arrested in Ethiopia and accused of taking part in a botched assassination attempt on Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak. He was extradited to Saudi Arabia where he served a two-year prison term in Jeddah. His prison sentence was reduced after he memorized the Qur&#x27;an.
He was a skilled propagandist, using the Internet to recruit and deliver his message. Al-Muqrin told an Arabic website in 2003 that, &quot;I have taken it upon myself and I have sworn to purge the Arabian Peninsula of the polytheists. We will fight the Crusaders and Jews in this country. They will not have any security until we evict them from the land of the Two Holy Places and until we evict them from the land of Palestine and the land of the Muslims, which they pillage and usurp from the east to the west.&quot;

Mohsen Al-Awaji, an expert in extremism, said in media interviews in 2004 that Al-Muqrin was &quot;shallow, very simple-minded,&quot; adding that he &quot;has no political brain. He&#x27;s got the weapon and no mind to control the weapon.&quot; By contrast, Michael Scheuer, a former CIA intelligence officer, has described Muqrin as a strategist who wrote about insurgency doctrine. Muqrin wrote a book on military strategy called &quot;A Practical Course for Guerrilla War&quot;, which has been compared with Abu Bakr Naji&#x27;s Management of Savagery as a book that has influenced Al Qaeda&#x27;s thinking on guerrilla warfare.

Al-Muqrin was No. 1 on Saudi Arabia&#x27;s second official list of most wanted terrorists, which was published in December 2003. In 2004 his faction claimed responsibility for a series of attacks against Westerners in Saudi Arabia including the June 2004 shooting that seriously wounded BBC correspondent Frank Gardner and killed cameraman Simon Cumbers, and the kidnapping and beheading of American contractor Paul Johnson. On the same day of the murder of Johnson, Saudi police commandos killed Al-Muqrin in a gun battle at a gas station in downtown Riyadh along with several associates including:
*Faisal Abdul-Rahman Abdullah al-Dakhil (who was also on the list),
*Turki bin Fuheid al-Muteiry, and
*Ibrahim bin Abdullah al-Dreiham.

Al-Muqrin was responsible for the May 29 attacks at Al-Khobar that left more than 20 people dead and several other operations.

The online magazine Al-Khansaa claims to have been founded by al-Muqrin shortly before his death. In 2004, plans were discovered posted online under al-Muqrin&#x27;s name containing the itinerary, routes of travel, and security personnel of Prince Nayef bin Abdel Aziz, and plans to assassinate him with RPGs.

<text>Jorge Wilstermann Camacho (; 23 April 1910 – 17 January 1936) was the first Bolivian commercial pilot. The son of a mechanic who worked for Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano, Wilstermann took an interest in aviation, and became Bolivia&#x27;s first civilian aviator. Jorge Wilstermann died in 1936, after an aeroplane accident when flying the Cochabamba–Oruro route on his Junkers airplane. Wilstermann&#x27;s pioneerism inspired homages in Bolivia. His friend and the then boss of Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano, Wálter Lemm, requested that the name of the local airport in Cochabamba and the local football team&#x27;s name (which was started by people involved in aviation, workers for Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano) be changed to Jorge Wilstermann in his honour.

<text>SMB (&quot;SubMiniature version B&quot;) connectors are coaxial RF connectors developed in the 1960s. SMB connectors are smaller than SMA connectors.

They feature a snap-on coupling and are available in either 50 Ω or 75 Ω impedance. They offer excellent electrical performance from DC to 4 GHz.

An SMB jack has a male center pin, while an SMB plug has a female basket.

Connectors are available for two SMB cable sizes: 
# Cable 2.6/50+75 S (3 mm outer / 1.7 mm inner diameter) and 
# Cable 2/50 S (2.2 mm outer / 1 mm inner diameter)

<text>The Kilchis River is a stream, about long, near the coast of northwest Oregon in the United States. It drains a mountainous timbered region of about in the Northern Oregon Coast Range west of Portland.

The Kilchis River begins at the confluence of its North Fork and South Fork in northern Tillamook County in the Tillamook State Forest northeast of Bay City. It flows southwest, entering the southeast end of Tillamook Bay approximately northwest of the city of Tillamook. The mouth of the river is about north of the mouth of the Wilson River and about north of the mouth of the Trask River. It is one of five rivers—the Tillamook, the Trask, the Wilson, the Kilchis, and the Miami—that flow into the bay.

The river has good runs of steelhead and fall Chinook salmon. Because much of the land along the lower stretches is private, fishing is often done by drift boat launched from boat ramps at Kilchis County Park, County Park, and Mapes Creek. Anglers may also fish from stream banks on public land in the Tillamook State Forest.

The Kilchis River was named for the 19th century Tillamook leader Chief Kilchis, whose Tillamook name was [gə́lšəs] or [gə́lčəs].

==Course==
Starting at the confluence of the North Fork Kilchis River and the South Fork Kilchis River, the river flows generally southwest through the Tillamook State Forest near Kilchis River Road. Sharp Creek enters from the at about from the mouth and just upstream of Kilchis River County Park, which is on the right. Shortly thereafter, School Creek and Washout Creek enters from the right and Little South Fork Kilchis River from the . Below this, the river receives Clear Creek from the left at about river mile (RM) 6 or river kilometer (RK) 9.7. Thereafter, Myrtle Creek and Murphy Creek enter from the right, and the river passes under U.S. Route 101 before entering Tillamook Bay near Idaville.

==Reserve==
The Tillamook County Pioneer Museum owns Kilchis Point Reserve, about of land along Tillamook Bay. The reserve has about of interpretive trails related to the site&#x27;s Native American and pioneer heritage as well as its flora and fauna. The largest Native American village on the North Oregon Coast was located here as was the home of the first white settler, Joe Champion, who arrived in 1851.

<text>Kenneth Sweigard (September 21, 1919 – July 11, 2005) was a Pentecostal evangelist from Grande Prairie, Alberta, and politician who led the Social Credit Party of Canada from 1983 to 1986.

In the 1980 election, Social Credit&#x27;s five remaining Members of Parliament (all from Quebec) were defeated. The party had not had any MPs from its old base of Alberta and British Columbia since 1968.

Sweigard first ran as a Social Credit candidate in the 1980 federal election. Standing in Peace River, Alberta, he came in fifth place with 462 votes. He placed behind the three major parties and the candidate for the Rhinoceros Party of Canada candidate, Allan Cavanagh.

Sweigard first sought the party&#x27;s leadership in 1982, when he lost to Martin Hattersley. Sweigard attended the party&#x27;s leadership convention dressed as U.S. president Abraham Lincoln, wearing a top hat and carrying a walking stick. His entourage, dressed in 1860s style, held placards reading &quot;Free the Slaves&quot; and chanted &quot;Free the economic slaves&quot;, a reference to the social credit theory of monetary reform and opposition to the charging of interest on borrowed money.

Hattersley resigned as leader in June 1983 when the party would not expel three outspoken party members from Alberta, including Jim Keegstra who had been accused of anti-Semitism.

Sweigard, who described Keegstra as a &quot;fine Christian gentleman&quot;, was elected interim leader by means of a telephone conference call of 17 party members, with 9 votes to 5 votes for party vice-president Richard Lawrence and three for Adrien Lambert.

As leader, he ran in the 1984 election in Timiskaming, placing last with 151 votes. Nationally, under his leadership, the party suffered what was, at the time, its worst performance to date receiving only 16,659 votes nationwide.

Sweigard attempted to win the leadership on a permanent basis at the party&#x27;s national convention in 1986 but fared poorly, despite telling delegates that he had been visited by an angel who had endorsed his candidacy. Sweigard received only 9 of 114 votes, finishing well behind winning candidate Harvey Lainson and runner-up Jim Keegstra.

After losing the leadership, he ran again in the 1988 election in Peace River, where he came in last in a field of six candidates with 354 votes. He died at Grande Prairie in 2005.

RENAMO was initially led by André Matsangaissa, a former senior official in FRELIMO&#x27;s armed wing, and was composed of several anti-communist dissident groups which appeared immediately prior to, and shortly following, Mozambican independence. Matsangaissa, who died in 1979, was succeeded by Afonso Dhlakama, who led the organization until he died in 2018. He was succeeded by Ossufo Momade.

Critics of RENAMO frequently described the movement as a proxy of Rhodesia and South Africa&#x27;s apartheid government. It has been theorised that RENAMO was formed for the sole purpose of countering FRELIMO support for the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). On the other hand, RENAMO was also reflective of FRELIMO&#x27;s own splintering support base and dwindling popularity in the immediate post-independence era. Its political programme centered around the abandonment of FRELIMO&#x27;s socialist policies, the adoption of a free market economy, and more traditionalist concerns such as the reinstatement of tribal leaders to positions of authority. RENAMO&#x27;s ranks included a number of Mozambican political exiles who genuinely opposed FRELIMO on principle, including FRELIMO defectors disillusioned with its Marxist–Leninist ideology, but also large numbers of recruits conscripted by force.

With Rhodesian support, RENAMO commenced an insurgency against the FRELIMO government in 1977, sparking the Mozambican Civil War. The war was characterised by severe human rights violations on both sides and crippled the already debilitated Mozambican economy. RENAMO and FRELIMO acceded to the Rome General Peace Accords in October 1992, which ended FRELIMO&#x27;s one-party state and introduced multi-party democratic elections. In return, RENAMO pledged to abandon its armed struggle and conduct its future activities by political means within the framework of the new electoral system. Following the end of the war, RENAMO was responsible for promoting constitutional reforms as well as the promotion of a strong domestic private sector.

Renewed clashes broke out between RENAMO&#x27;s militant forces and the FRELIMO government in 2013. RENAMO resumed its insurgency, citing state corruption and electoral fraud perpetuated by FRELIMO officials. A second peace agreement was reached between RENAMO and FRELIMO in August 2019, resulting in the virtual end of the insurgency. A RENAMO splinter group known as the RENAMO Military Junta (RMJ) was quickly formed from party dissidents opposed to the peace process; the RMJ continued to carry out minor guerrilla operations until December 2021, when the last of its members surrendered to Mozambican security forces.

== History ==
===Independence and formation===

From the early 1960s to the mid-1970s, Portugal fought a series of bitter counter-insurgency conflicts against independence movements in its three primary African colonies—Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau. In Mozambique, the armed struggle against colonial rule was spearheaded by the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO), which was initially formed in exile in neighbouring Tanzania. FRELIMO recruited from Mozambican migrant workers and intellectuals living abroad, where they had been exposed to the emerging popularity of anti-colonial and nationalist causes overseas. Its political programme was anti-colonial, but also anti-traditionalist; FRELIMO leaders planned to wrest social and political power from the Portuguese administration, as well as on the grassroots level from local tribal authorities. The party also envisioned a radical restructuring of post-colonial Mozambican society in accordance with the principles of scientific socialism. In September 1964, FRELIMO initiated an armed insurgency. Its decision to take up arms was influenced by a number of internal and external factors, namely the recent successes of indigenous anti-colonial guerrilla movements in French Indochina and French Algeria, as well as encouragement from contemporary African statesmen such as Ahmed Ben Bella, Gamal Abdel Nasser, and Julius Nyerere. FRELIMO insurgents initially received training primarily in North Africa and the Middle East in countries such as Algeria, with the Soviet Union and People&#x27;s Republic of China providing military equipment. FRELIMO established a permanent foothold in underdeveloped northern Mozambique and began expanding its operations southwards, reaching the central provinces by 1973. Portugal responded with increasingly large scale search and destroy operations and strengthening military and intelligence ties to the neighbouring states of Rhodesia and South Africa, then ruled by white minority governments sympathetic to the colonial regime. FRELIMO, in turn, forged an informal alliance with a Rhodesian insurgent movement, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). ZANLA insurgents were permitted to infiltrate Rhodesian territory from FRELIMO-held areas of Mozambique, inexorably linking the Mozambican conflict to the Rhodesian Bush War.

The 1974 Carnation Revolution and the collapse of Portugal&#x27;s right-wing &quot;Estado Novo&quot; government plunged Lisbon into turmoil and brought to power a military junta known as the Armed Forces Movement. The Portuguese junta was committed to divesting itself of the colonies and ending the increasingly costly African wars. The resulting confusion among the metropole&#x27;s military forces in Mozambique allowed FRELIMO to wrest control of large sections of the territory from the Portuguese. In the absence of Portuguese repression, a number of new Mozambican political parties, including some formed by FRELIMO splinter factions, appeared and began campaigning for support. Portugal announced it would initiate a political transition in Mozambique simultaneously with multi-party elections prior to independence, but FRELIMO condemned the proposal. The party&#x27;s leadership, headed by Samora Machel, countered that it was the sole legitimate representative of the Mozambican people, and demanded it be permitted to take power directly, without multi-party elections. In early September 1974, Portugal announced it would comply with FRELIMO&#x27;s request. Portuguese officials promised that after nine months, the positions of local government would be handed to FRELIMO appointees, and no elections would be held.

The decision to effect a direct transfer of power to FRELIMO, without a local referendum or elections, was greeted with trepidation by South Africa and Rhodesia. It also resulted in an exodus of Portuguese settlers, FRELIMO dissidents, and indigenous troops who had served with Portuguese auxiliary units, including the elite Flechas, fearing retribution under the new regime. Many of the new exiles fled to Rhodesia, where they were recruited as assets by the Rhodesian Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO). The most prominent anti-FRELIMO exile in Rhodesia was Orlando Cristina, a former member of the colonial security services in Mozambique who had served as a regional liaison with the Rhodesian government. Cristina set up a Portuguese-language radio broadcasting station, known as &quot;Voz da Africa Livre&quot;, which broadcast anti-communist and anti-FRELIMO messages into Mozambique. Cristina&#x27;s broadcasts called attention to human rights violations committed by FRELIMO, including the detention of party dissidents, and accused FRELIMO of betraying Mozambican nationalism by pandering to the Marxist ideology of the Soviet Union. The CIO hoped to use &quot;Voz da Africa Livre&quot; to recruit disaffected Mozambicans for an anti-FRELIMO paramilitary force. One such recruit was André Matsangaissa, a former FRELIMO official who had been imprisoned by the party in a re-education camp following the transfer of power; Matsangaissa had subsequently escaped to Rhodesia and was familiar with Cristina&#x27;s broadcasts. Matsangaissa met with Cristina and argued that hostile radio messages alone could not change the political situation in Mozambique; armed struggle was necessary. Shortly thereafter, the CIO recruited Matsangaissa as the leader for its new anti-FRELIMO force. The militants received guerrilla training from the CIO and were infiltrated back into Mozambique, where they conducted surveillance of ZANLA movements at the Rhodesians&#x27; behest. In February 1977, the unit demonstrated its ability to carry out autonomous operations when it stormed a FRELIMO re-education camp in Sofala Province, freeing the detainees there. During a meeting at Cristina&#x27;s home in May 1977, the unit&#x27;s leadership formally adopted the title &quot;Resistência Nacional Moçambicana&quot; (RENAMO).

===Later activity===
RENAMO unified with another rebel group, the Revolutionary Party of Mozambique (PRM) in 1982. As a result of this merger, the rebel group was able to expand its operations in northern Mozambique, particularly in Zambezia Province. In 1984 the South African and Mozambican governments signed the Nkomati Accord, in which the South African National Party minority regime promised to stop sponsoring RENAMO operations if the Mozambican government expelled exiled members of the African National Congress (ANC) residing there. This was consistent with the Total National Strategy pursued by the National Party regime, utilizing threats of military reprisals to force Mozambique into subjugation under the Afrikaner nationalists hegemonial ambitions in the region. In 1988, RENAMO experienced its only major split during the civil war, when former PRM commander Gimo Phiri broke off and founded an independent insurgent group known as Mozambican National Union (UNAMO).

While the Mozambican government did shut down the local ANC offices and its operations in accordance with the Nkomati Accord, the National Party government of South Africa continued funnelling financial and military resources to RENAMO. A permanent peace accord was reached only in 1992, monitored by the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (UNOMOZ) until its finalisation in 1994. This process went on simultaneously to the negotiations between the National Party minority government and the ANC about the termination of Apartheid policies and the transformation to a democratic dispensation in South Africa. The South African National Intelligence Service initiated the Operation Bush Talk, which was designed to phase out the National Party&#x27;s longstanding substantial support to RENAMO and allow their proxy to accommodate to the new regional realities.

The peace accord led to the disarmament of RENAMO, the integration of some of its fighters into the Mozambican army, and its transformation into a regular political party. It is now the main opposition party in Mozambique. At the legislative elections on 1 and 2 December 2004, the party was the main part of the Renamo-UE electoral alliance, which won 29.7% of the popular vote and 90 out of 250 seats. The presidential candidate of this alliance, Afonso Dhlakama, won 31.7% of the popular vote.

Raul Domingos, negotiator at the Rome General Peace Accords and RENAMO&#x27;s leader in parliament from 1994 to 1999, was expelled from the party in 2000, and in 2003, founded the Party for Peace, Democracy, and Development.

=== Activities in Zimbabwe ===
RENAMO forces attacked an army base in Zimbabwe near Mukosa on 17 June 1987, killing seven soldiers and wounding 19. RENAMO attacked the Katiyo Tea Estate, destroying valuable property, in July and killed three men in Rushinga in August. On 30 November, RENAMO militants burned down 13 houses.

Between December 1987 and 21 January 1988, RENAMO performed 101 attacks near the Mozambique-Zimbabwe border. Following the end of the Mozambican Civil War, RENAMO remained linked to a Zimbabwean militant group, Chimwenje.

=== International dimension and Human Rights record ===
Apart from their primary supporters, initially the Rhodesian Central Intelligence Organisation until 1979 and afterwards, the South African Directorate of Special Tasks (DST), RENAMO also enjoyed some level of international recognition, support and funding. Chester Crocker, then the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs in the US State Department, viewed RENAMO as &quot;African Khmer Rouge&quot;. While RENAMO styled itself as &quot;anti-communist&quot;, its brutal conduct and lack of political legitimacy made the organisation unsuitable as a partner, since it jeopardised the State Department attempts to gain rapport with the FRELIMO government and the Mozambican population, in order to increase the Western Bloc&#x27;s influence on the region. Contrary to that stance stood the active engagement of the far-right Heritage Foundation for the cause of RENAMO.

West German academic Andre Thomashausen and his mentor Werner Kaltefleiter served as vital links between West German right-wing conservative, anti-socialist political circles and RENAMO. Thomashausen is alleged to have had close links to both the West German and apartheid South African intelligence services, while being officially employed as a professor at the University of South Africa and in various managerial positions (in particular for West German corporations engaged in the apartheid economy) since 1982, when he moved to South Africa and immediately was granted citizenship by the National Party minority government. Thomashausen acted as a confidante and an advisor to the RENAMO leadership. A related network of West German RENAMO lobbyists evolved around Bavarian Prime Minister and leader of the conservative CSU party Franz Josef Strauss. The provincial leader engaged in his own far right foreign policy in support of apartheid and anti-socialist paramilitary forces in Southern Africa, thereby undermining the official Détente foreign policy of the West German federal government.

RENAMO conduct has frequently been described by western authors as amounting to terrorism, especially since it usually involved attacks against defenseless civilians. The forcible recruitment of kidnapped villagers, including underage children, formed RENAMO&#x27;s main modus operandi to increase its membership. This often included the murder of close relatives of the kidnapped persons, so that they had no way of returning to their communities.The organisation also engaged in brutal publicly staged ritual killings of perceived traitors and dissidents.

== Renewed clashes ==
In October 2012, RENAMO&#x27;s headquarters were relocated near Casa Banana (also named Sathunjira, RENAMO&#x27;s former guerrilla base in the 1980s) in Gorongosa, where a training camp was set up for around 800 partially armed followers. Previously, the headquarters had been moved from Maputo to Nampula in 2009. RENAMO leader Afonso Dhlakama threatened to &quot;destroy the country&quot; if his political demands were not met.

On 4 April 2013, one woman and four police officers were killed, with ten policemen more injured in a RENAMO attack on a police station in the town of Muxengue. The leader of the attackers was also killed. RENAMO&#x27;s security chief stated that the action was a response to previous police raids on RENAMO gatherings. Around 300 RENAMO members had remained armed since the 1992 peace deal, despite efforts to integrate them into the army or police.

On 6 April 2013, two or three civilians were killed and two women were injured when alleged RENAMO militiamen attacked a truck and a bus in Chibabava District. RENAMO denied being involved in the attack.

On 21 June, suspected RENAMO guerrillas attacked a bus in Machanga, Sofala Province, injuring an elderly woman. The incident happened two days after RENAMO threatened to paralyse key roads and the only coal export train to force the FRELIMO government to renegotiate peace terms.

On 17 October, suspected RENAMO guerrillas ambushed a military patrol near Gorongosa, RENAMO&#x27;s stronghold, killing seven soldiers, according to local media. On 18 October, another clash between Mozambican Armed Forces (FADM) and RENAMO militiamen took place in Mucodza, seven kilometres away from Gorongosa. National director of defence policy in the Ministry of Defence, Colonel Cristovao Chume, claimed that the soldiers suffered no losses and that a RENAMO fighter was injured and captured by their forces. RENAMO leader Dhlakama claimed that no RENAMO fighters were killed on the attack, which, according to him, was started by the Army, and that the casualties had been suffered by the FADM. However, reporters confirmed that the bodies of two RENAMO fighters were in the local morgue of Gorongosa.

On 21 October, FADM forces captured Sathunjira base after several days of combat. RENAMO spokesman Fernando Mazanga claimed that the government forces had shelled the base with heavy weapons (artillery), and that Afonso Dhlakama had fled the base. A RENAMO statement said that the capture of the base puts an end to the 1992 peace deal. RENAMO announced that MP Armindo Milaco was killed in the government raid. On 22 October, gunmen attacked a police station in Maringué District in apparent retaliation, with no casualties reported.

On 26 October, alleged RENAMO fighters attacked civilian vehicles in the main north–south highway near Beira, killing one and injuring 10 people. RENAMO denied its implication in the attack.

=== 2014 peace process ===
On 5 September 2014 Dhlakama and president Guebuza signed a peace deal in an effort to end the two-year period of instability. The deal included integration of RENAMO forces into the army and a reform of the election oversight commission. However, after RENAMO&#x27;s refusal to accept the 2014 presidential elections, problems in the implementation of the peace deal and after continued efforts by government forces to disarm RENAMO met resistance, Dhlakama broke off the peace process in August 2015. Since then there have been renewed clashes between government and RENAMO forces. Dhlakama claims there have been two attempts by the government to assassinate him.

=== 2017 truce ===
In May 2017, RENAMO agreed to extend their truce indefinitely.

== Death of Dhlakama and its impact ==
On 3 May 2018, Afonso Dhlakama, who led RENAMO since 1979, died in Gorongosa after suffering a heart attack. An unnamed official in RENAMO acknowledged this and also stated that Dhlakma had been ill prior to his death. Regarding the future of RENAMO following Dhlakma&#x27;s death, Ed Hobey Hamsher, an analyst with Maplecroft, stated that &quot;no potential successor has Dhlakama&#x27;s stature&quot; and that anybody who succeeds him &quot;will struggle to unify Renamo&#x27;s factions.&quot; At the time of Dhlakma&#x27;s death, the RENAMO Congress was unable to fix a date to vote on a successor. The next month on 14 June 2018, Ossufo Momade, who was picked to serve as the interim leader of RENAMO until the organization&#x27;s Congress could vote on a permanent successor to Dhlakma, went into hiding.

==Peace deal reached between RENAMO and Mozambique government==
On 1 August 2019, Mozambique President Filipe Nyusi and RENAMO leader Ossufo Momade signed a peace agreement bringing an end to the six-year period of armed clashes. They also shook hands and embraced each other as well. The signing of the peace took place at RENAMO&#x27;s remote military base in the Gorongosa mountains. After the agreement was signed, the last remaining RENAMO fighters surrendered their weapons. Momade told the Associated Press &quot;We will no longer commit the mistakes of the past.&quot; He also stated &quot;We are for a humanized and dignified reintegration and we want the international community to help make that a reality.&quot; During another signing which took in Maputo&#x27;s peace square, Momade declared the group would focus to &quot;maintain peace and national reconciliation.&quot;

<text>Propaganda is a German synth-pop band formed in Düsseldorf in 1982. They signed a recording contract with ZTT Records as early as 1983 and released their first single &quot;Dr Mabuse&quot; in 1984. Followed by their debut studio album, the critically acclaimed &quot;A Secret Wish&quot;, in 1985. Two of the album&#x27;s singles, &quot;Dr. Mabuse&quot; and &quot;Duel&quot;, were UK Top 30 hits. A second studio album, &quot;1234&quot; (1990), was recorded with a markedly different line-up and released by Virgin Records to less success. There have been several partial reformations of the group in the 21st century, with the original vocalists currently active as xPropaganda, and the remaining members releasing an album in 2024 with a guest vocalist Thunder Bae.

== History ==
=== 1982–1984: Early history ===
Propaganda was formed in Düsseldorf, West Germany, in 1982, by Ralf Dörper (a member of the pioneering German industrial band Die Krupps). As a trio, with artist Andreas Thein and vocalist Susanne Freytag, the group made initial recordings in Germany which were destined for future release in the UK, where Ralf Dörper&#x27;s early experimental recordings had received critical acclaim by radio DJ John Peel and journalist Chris Bohn (aka Biba Kopf). With the inclusion of classically trained musician and composer, Michael Mertens and singer Claudia Brücken (who had been in an all female band, The Topolinos, with Freytag), music journalist Paul Morley signed the band to Trevor Horn&#x27;s newly formed ZTT label in 1983.

The group relocated to the United Kingdom and released the single &quot;Dr. Mabuse&quot;, named after the fictional character made famous by filmmaker Fritz Lang. The single reached the Top 30 in the UK Singles Chart, and the Top 10 in Germany. The group appeared on various TV shows in the UK, including Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Tube&quot;. Here, as well as performing &quot;Dr. Mabuse&quot;, the group also gave one of its few performances of a cover version of Throbbing Gristle&#x27;s song &quot;Discipline&quot;.

Before the year was out, Thein was asked to leave the band due to musical differences. With Mertens now filling the gap left by his departure, the band forged ahead with recording its follow-up single and debut album. However both of these were to be delayed as a result of the unexpectedly huge success of ZTT&#x27;s most famous signing, Frankie Goes to Hollywood. As the label was still in its infancy, ZTT was forced to spend all its limited resources on promoting and marketing Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and this also meant that Trevor Horn was not available to produce Propaganda&#x27;s album. Stephen Lipson, one of Horn&#x27;s established studio engineers, took his place along with Andy Richards playing keyboards, but the delay meant that Propaganda&#x27;s second single, the more pop-oriented &quot;Duel&quot;, did not surface until April 1985. Perhaps the band&#x27;s most recognisable release, it was also their highest-charting single in the UK, reaching number 21. The band made its single appearance on the flagship BBC music programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in June of that year.

In May 1985, with Frankie Goes to Hollywood becoming tax exiles in Ireland, the band effectively headlined &quot;The Value of Entertainment&quot;, a series of showcase gigs of ZTT signings, held at the Ambassadors Theatre in London. The shows also featured Art of Noise, Anne Pigalle, Andrew Poppy and Instinct. Propaganda were joined on stage by former Simple Minds bassist Derek Forbes and ex-Japan drummer Steve Jansen.

=== 1985: &quot;A Secret Wish&quot; ===
The first week of July 1985 finally saw the release of the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;A Secret Wish&quot;. which was written by Mertens and Dörper. After receiving considerable critical acclaim and some commercial success, it reached number 16 on the UK Albums Chart. The album was followed by another single, &quot;&quot;, in August 1985, which only reached number 50 in the UK, but becoming a bigger hit in Italy, France, the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland and even being used in the hit US TV Show &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (1986 episode: &quot;The Fix&quot;). The 12-inch version of this release caused controversy (even within the group) as Paul Morley thought it was a good idea to have the sleeve feature a quote by writer J. G. Ballard, praising the activities of the German extremist group Red Army Faction. Ariola, who distributed ZTT&#x27;s releases in Germany, refused to carry the 12&quot; as a result, so the quote was changed on the German release to another by Ballard, on the aesthetic perfection of German suburbs.

The group spent the rest of the year on their &quot;Outside World&quot; tour, taking in Europe and America. They were joined once again by Derek Forbes on bass, with his fellow ex-Simple Minds colleagues Brian McGee on drums, and Kevin Armstrong on guitar, with backing tapes used for most of the keyboard parts. In the meantime a remix album, &quot;Wishful Thinking&quot;, was released in November 1985. Originally intended for the American club market, the album was also released in Europe, but against the wishes of the group themselves. The album peaked at number 82 in the UK. A remixed version of &quot;p:Machinery&quot; was also re-released as a single, only four months after its original release. In the UK, it too failed to make an impact and peaked at number 83, but was, again, more successful in France and Germany.

=== 1986–1987: Split ===
The year 1986 started positively—the single &quot;p:Machinery&quot; gained the number 1 chart position in Spain (for one week) and entered the Top 10 in France—but ended in disaster.
In late 1985, its management had introduced the band to the London-based music lawyer Brian Carr of Compton Carr, who had helped to win the case between John Lydon (Sex Pistols/Public Image Ltd) and his management. Carr explained to the group members that under their current contracts with ZTT, they could go on making records for the rest of their lives and never make any money from them. Based on this information the band asked ZTT to renegotiate the contracts, which the company declined. Soon afterwards Claudia Brücken (who was married to ZTT&#x27;s Paul Morley) left Propaganda to pursue a solo career, remaining signed to ZTT. After a protracted legal battle, which saw the remaining members of Propaganda under an injunction by ZTT for fourteen months, they were finally released from their contract to ZTT in a hurried out-of-court settlement in the summer of 1987. ZTT signed the duo Act of Brücken and Thomas Leer in 1988, which did not match the commercial success of Propaganda despite the production of Stephen Lipson.

=== 1988–1992: New record deal and line-up ===
In 1988, the band (initially still including Ralf Dörper and Susanne Freytag) signed to Virgin, and began recording new material. Alongside Michael Mertens was the new line-up of American vocalist Betsi Miller, with bassist Derek Forbes and drummer Brian McGee (both ex-Simple Minds) who had both actually joined the band following their split with ZTT in 1986. The result was a new album, released in 1990 called &quot;1234&quot;, produced by former Tears for Fears&#x27; associates Ian Stanley and Chris Hughes, Miller&#x27;s future husband. Dörper&#x27;s lyrics were used on the singles &quot;Only One Word&quot;, &quot;Wound in My Heart&quot;, and &quot;Vicious Circle&quot;, the album track Freytag guested on. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd played guitar on second single, &quot;Only One Word&quot;.

The first single from the album, &quot;Heaven Give Me Words&quot;, was co-written with 1980s synth-pop star Howard Jones and reached the UK Top 40. The album was not as successful as &quot;A Secret Wish&quot;, only peaking at number 46 in the UK. A second single, &quot;Only One Word&quot;, stalled at number 71 in the UK.

=== 1998–2004: Part-reunion and second split ===
In 1998, Mertens, Brücken, and Freytag reunited, signed an options deal with East West, and began working on new material. Several tracks were completed, including one produced by Tim Simenon and featuring Depeche Mode&#x27;s Martin Gore on guitar. A video for one song, &quot;No Return&quot;, was produced in Morocco and directed by &#x27;Keyser Soze&#x27; in December 1998. Two minute clips of it, along with photos of the shoot, were released via the band&#x27;s official website in early 2000. However, no album materialized and, in January 2002, Brücken announced, &quot;The reunion was worth a try, but did not work out.&quot; Tracks of these recording sessions were leaked to the internet in 2002.

However a real reunion of the four original band members took place in November 2004, when Brücken, Dörper, Freytag and Mertens—but without Thein—performed &quot;Dr. Mabuse&quot; at a concert for the Prince&#x27;s Trust which took place at Wembley Arena, celebrating 25 years of Trevor Horn&#x27;s career as a successful producer.

A few years later the band also appeared exclusively on a German TV show celebrating the best songs of the 1980s.

=== 2005–2015: Further activities ===
In early 2005, Propaganda, now comprising Susanne Freytag and Michael Mertens, started to release new material on the German independent label Amontillado Music. The limited edition 12&quot; vinyl release &quot;Valley of the Machine Gods&quot; was sold out within two weeks.

In July 2010, a two-disc Deluxe Edition of &quot;A Secret Wish&quot;, containing the varying tracks released on both the original vinyl album, cassette and CD versions, was released to mark the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary. This edition also included unreleased 12-inch remixes and previously unheard demos. The booklet accompanying the release noted that &quot;at the time of writing, spring 2010, Mertens, Brücken, Freytag and Dörper are back on terms and for the second time since 2000 they are considering working together&quot;.

On 2 March 2011, Claudia Brücken performed at Scala in London and was joined by Ralf Dörper and Susanne Freytag for some of the tracks. Thomas Leer was also expected to perform but was unable to do so because of a throat operation. The gig was recorded for later DVD release and also featured Glenn Gregory and Martyn Ware of Heaven 17 and Andy Bell of Erasure. However, in an interview around the same time, Brücken said that Mertens was unwilling to work with her any longer.

Andreas Thein died on 31 May 2013 from cancer.

Propaganda is credited for remixing Holly Johnson&#x27;s single &quot;Dancing with No Fear&quot; (released 2015), on which Michael Mertens and Ralf Dörper also played a synthesizer.

=== 2018: xPropaganda ===
The duo of Brücken and Freytag appeared on some retro festivals across Europe and did some shows performing &quot;A Secret Wish&quot; in Germany using the name &#x27;Duel&#x27;, whereas in the UK the name &#x27;xPropaganda&#x27; was used. Here they supported Heaven 17 in late November and early December 2018 to mark the 35th anniversary of the &quot;Luxury Gap&quot; album. The duo of Brücken and Freytag were backed by the former Onetwo band. A live recording of one of xPropaganda&#x27;s London shows was released as the album &quot;A Secret Place&quot; in 2018.

On 20 May 2022, the xPropaganda album titled &quot;The Heart Is Strange&quot; by Brücken, Freytag and Lipson was released in various formats by Universal Music on the ZTT imprint. The album peaked at no. 11 in the UK, higher than any of Propaganda&#x27;s previous releases. Music journalist Daryl Easlea of &quot;Louder&quot; praised the album as &quot;a compelling listen&quot;, remarking as well that its style sounded &quot;exactly like it could have followed their old group&#x27;s debut&quot;. The album was a result of Brücken and Freytag approaching Stephen Lipson to ask him to write new songs with them that they could include in their live show. These were written and recorded during the COVID-19 lockdown and resulted in enough tracks to make an album. Their manager approached Universal with the album and gained a two-album deal. Michael Mertens had been approached to be involved in the songwriting but declined.

=== 2024–present: new, self-titled album ===
On 17 May 2024, Propaganda now comprising only members Mertens and Dörper, released a new track, &quot;Purveyor of Pleasure&quot;, featuring Thunder Bae on vocals. A new eight-track self-titled album was released on 11 October 2024 on the record label Bureau B. The album features vocalist Thunder Bae, and composer, pianist, and former rapper Hauschka. Mertens and Dörper recorded the album in Düsseldorf.

<text>SMC (&quot;SubMiniature version C&quot;) connectors are coaxial RF connectors developed in the 1960s. The interface specifications for the SMC and many other connectors are referenced in MIL-STD-348. They use a #10-32 UNF threaded interface (a screw type). They offer electrical performance from direct current (DC) to 4 GHz. Some extended performance versions are rated to 10 GHz. The normally free part (a.k.a. plug) of a SMC connector that has a socket for the centre contact are the female connectors. The normally fixed part (a.k.a. jack) SMC connectors that has a pin for the centre contact are the male connectors. This is the reverse of most RF connectors. SMC jack connectors have an external thread while SMC plug connectors have the mating hex nut. The contact dimensions are identical to the snap-fit SMB. Available in 50 ohm and 75 ohm characteristic impedance, they provide an interconnect means for small form factor coaxial cables (e.g. 50 ohm RG-174, 75 ohm RG-179) and printed circuit boards where small footprint is important.

The term Subvis connector appears to be a European usage; the connectors appear to be electrically and mechanically equivalent to SMC.

<doc id="735779" wikidata="Q750585" url="?curid=735779" title="Svenska Cupen">
<text>Svenska cupen (, ) is a knockout cup competition in Swedish football and the main Swedish football cup. &quot;Svenska cupen&quot; usually refers to the men&#x27;s tournament, although a women&#x27;s tournament is also held. Each year 96 teams compete, comprising the 16 teams from Allsvenskan and the 16 teams of Superettan together with 64 teams from lower tiers of the league system. The winners qualify for the qualifying stages of the UEFA Europa League. The winner is awarded the Gustaf VI Adolf cup.

Compared to cups in many other countries, Svenska cupen attracts considerably less public interest and even the cup final is rarely sold out. Consequently, the Swedish Football Association has experimented with the format in order to raise the profile of the cup. The final has been staged at a neutral venue, at the national stadium as well as being played as a two-leg match.

Svenska cupen was first held in 1941. The current holders of the cup are Malmö FF who beat Djurgårdens IF in the 2024 final. Malmö FF are the most successful club of the competition having won 16 titles, the latest in 2024.

==Rounds and teams==

The winner of Svenska Cupen qualifies for the first qualification round of the UEFA Europa League. The qualification spot is awarded to the fourth positioned team in Allsvenskan if the winner is already qualified for the UEFA Europa League or the UEFA Champions League.

==How district teams qualify==
There are a number of districts in the Swedish football organization, and each of them receives a number of spots in Svenska Cupen, due to how many eleven-player teams and nine-player teams the district has in the leagues. The only three associations of the Swedish District Football Associations that has a qualifying round to 2015–16 Svenska Cupen are Dalarnas FF and Örebro Läns FF, the other district decides their teams by &quot;Distriktsmästerskap&quot; (District Championships) or by club ranking 2014. Only teams in Division 1 or lower are included, because teams in Allsvenskan and Superettan are automatically qualified for Round 2.

===Ranking===

This is the number of places each of the districts will have in the first round of the 2015–16 Svenska Cupen. Updated as of 31 May 2015.

<doc id="735781" wikidata="Q954875" url="?curid=735781" title="Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann">
<text>Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann (28 August 1879 – 15 November 1933), (sometimes called Jacques-Émile Ruhlmann), was a French furniture designer and interior decorator, who was one of the most important figures in the Art Deco movement. His furniture featured sleek designs, expensive and exotic materials and extremely fine craftsmanship, and became a symbol of the luxury and modernity of Art Deco. It also produced a reaction from other designers and architects, such as Le Corbusier, who called for simpler, functional furniture.

==Biography== 

He was born in Paris, where his father, originally from Alsace, had created successful business constructing, painting and wallpapering the interiors of houses and apartments. He learned the business in his youth, working alongside the painters and paper hangers. When his father died in 1907, he took over the family business and soon, with designer Pierre Laurent he opened a second office, called Ruhlmann &amp; Laurent, designing and making fine furniture. The original construction business was located at 10 rue de Maleville, while the furniture was designed and displayed in showrooms at 27 rue de Lisbonne. The profits from the construction enabled Ruhlmann to buy expensive materials and hire the best craftsmen for his furniture making.

Ruhlmann&#x27;s first experience in furniture design occurred in 1910 when he designed furniture for his wife and his first apartment. During this same year, Ruhlmann made his designs accessible to the public. By 1919, Ruhlmann co-founded an interior design company with Pierre Laurent. The company specialized in various interior specialties including wallpaper and furniture.

His early designs reflected influences from the Art Nouveau and Arts &amp; Crafts Movements popular around this time in Europe. His later work could be traced to heavy influence from Venetian design during World War I. Although his early work seemed to be influenced by the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement, he was very vocal of his disdain for the movement itself. He stated style and design trends started and were completely steered by the rich, as they were the ones who could afford such expensive trending items. His later designs seemed to cater to this affluent clientele including materials such as ebony, rosewood, and burl, all sourced from across the globe.

For his furniture, Ruhlmann used rare and expensive woods such as ebony and rosewood, coverings of sharkskin, and handles and inlays of ivory. The forms were very simple, without ostentation. It could take as much as eight months to make a single piece of furniture. Although Ruhlmann&#x27;s pieces were extremely expensive, they cost more to make than what Ruhlmann charged for them. He stated his faith in the future was what inspired him to continue making furniture, even as it was bringing him debt. In his early years he had the work done by different Paris furniture workshops, but in 1923 he opened his own workshop, on Rue Ouessant in the 15th arrondissement, where his own craftsmen made the pieces.
Ruhlmann&#x27;s work received international attention at the Paris International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in 1925, the event which gave &quot;Art Deco&quot; its name. He had his own pavilion, the &quot;Hôtel du collectionneur&quot; (House of a Collector), with full-scale displays of his furniture in palatal settings.

His pavilion at the 1925 Exposition brought him a number of famous clients, including the Rothschild and Worms banking families, Eugène Schueller, the owner of L&#x27;Oreal, the aircraft and automobile constructor Gabriel Voisin, the fashion designer Jeanne Paquin, the writer Colette and the playwright Paul Géraldy, who asked him to design stage sets for his plays.

He made a particularly original desk for the office of André Tardieu, the President of the French state council. This monumental piece was painted in black lacquer. He decided to make a copy of the desk for himself, of ebony from Macassar, featuring a pivoting lamp and supports for a telephone.

He made another specially-designed piece for Georges-Marie Haardt, the director of the Citroen automobile company, who led several celebrated voyages of exploration. This was a rolling table for presenting drawings, which he produced in several versions, made of lacquered rosewood, oak, mahogany and linden.

With the coming of the Great Depression in 1929, and arrival of more modernist styles, Ruhlmann made a few concessions to the new, more geometric style. In 1932 he designed a number of pieces for the Manik Bagh palace of Maharaja Yashwant Rao Holkar II of Indore State.

In 1933, he learned that he had a fatal illness. Before dying, he designed his own funeral monument, and decreed that his company would be dissolved and closed after his death. He died 15 November 1933.

==Method==
Ruhlmann&#x27;s bureau in the 1920s employed twenty-five architects and designers. All furniture designs originated with Ruhlmann, who carried a sketchbook at all times and was always observing and drawing. Each individual piece began with a drawing at a scale at one-hundredth of the finished size, which was then refined to a more finished drawing one tenth of the finished size, and finally a full-scale drawing which was used to make the piece of furniture. The artists were required to copy precisely the original ideas of the master.

<doc id="735785" wikidata="Q623785" url="?curid=735785" title="California State Route 111">
<text>State Route 111 (SR 111) is a state highway in the southeastern part of U.S. state of California. It is a north-south route serving the Imperial Valley, the eastern shore of the Salton Sea, and the Coachella Valley. Its southern terminus is at Imperial Avenue and 1st Street in Calexico, at the former entrance to the Calexico West Port of Entry (the state has not yet officially rerouted the highway to the current entrance to the Mexican border at 2nd Street and Cesar Chavez Boulevard since its opening in 2018). SR 111&#x27;s northern terminus is at Interstate 10 at the northwestern corner of the Palm Springs city limits, near the unincorporated community of Whitewater.

==Route description==

The highway begins near the Calexico West Port of Entry, where Calexico connects with the Mexican city Mexicali. Prior to the port of entry&#x27;s 2018 realignment, SR 111 directly connected to the border crossing, with northbound traffic entering from Mexican side of the border via Avenida Cristóbal Colón, and southbound traffic exiting onto Mexican Federal Highway 5. Since then, traffic heading to the border diverts from SR 111 onto westbound East Second Street to the port of entry&#x27;s new facilities at Cesar Chavez Boulevard. The segment of the highway from East Second Street south to the site of the former border crossing at East First Street remains under state control, pending any relinquishment by Caltrans.

SR 111 then intersects with SR 98 in Calexico before heading north to SR 86 in Heber. As SR 111 continues further north through Imperial County, it enters El Centro. There, it intersects with Interstate 8 (I-8), which runs east to Yuma and west to San Diego, before passing through the agricultural communities of Holtville, Brawley, Calipatria and Niland.

A nearly length of the highway dotted with date and citrus groves follows both the old Southern Pacific &quot;Sunset Route&quot; (now the main Union Pacific line between Los Angeles and Yuma, Arizona) and the eastern shore of the Salton Sea. Though some small settlements and a California state park line the shore, the area is eerily empty due to the sea&#x27;s rapidly declining water quality. The small town of North Shore is all but abandoned as a tourist destination, though more than 3,400 residents were counted at the 2010 census.

SR 111 enters the southeast corner of the Coachella Valley as a two-lane highway. It used to run concurrently with SR 86 in Coachella, but SR 86 has since been moved to a newer expressway alignment. SR 111 continues northwest as a major arterial road, four lanes or wider, through Indio, La Quinta, Indian Wells, Palm Desert, Rancho Mirage, and Cathedral City. As it approaches this area, the northbound traffic is on Indian Canyon Drive, and the southbound is on Palm Canyon Drive. An alternate route runs on Gene Autry Trail while mainline SR 111 continues west on Vista Chino. Continuing west from Cathedral City, the highway enters Palm Springs, then swings north and then west to bypass downtown, while SR 111 Business passes through the congested downtown area. The highway transitions from an arterial road to a divided expressway as it exits Palm Springs just northwest of San Rafael Drive. It ends at an interchange with I-10 near the foot of San Jacinto Peak, just east of the San Gorgonio Pass.

SR 111 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and the portions south of SR 78, and in the city of Indio are part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 111 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation.

==History==

SR 111 was first proposed in the early 1930s due to the area&#x27;s growth bought on by the Southern Pacific Railroad.

A 1993 rerouting of the highway takes drivers away from the historic center of Palm Springs, but meets with its original alignment as Business Route 111 a few miles further south.

The northern terminus was so busy in the 1950s before the construction of the freeway that visitors returning home to Los Angeles might have waited as long as two hours to make the left turn on the two-lane road that was once multiplexed as US Highways 60, 70 and 99. 

In 1995, Caltrans was allowed to relinquish any portion of Route 111 through a city for that city to maintain. The legislature opted to make the act an &quot;urgency statute&quot;, effective immediately, so that the local governments could improve traffic bottlenecks along the route as soon as possible. The legislative definition of the route was amended in 1996 to exclude the portions in Rancho Mirage and Cathedral City, which had both been relinquished. Cathedral City completed a pedestrian-friendly redesign in 1998. The stretch through Rancho Mirage, which the city still calls &quot;Highway 111&quot; regardless of the relinquishment, has the Coachella Valley&#x27;s only synchronized traffic lights; they are set to 45 mph (70 km/h).

A 2003 law did not change the route, but clarified that the former highway through those cities could not be taken back by the state, and repealed the section added in 1995 allowing relinquishment to any city. Subsequently, in 2005, the legislature allowed relinquishment within Indian Wells, Indio, and Palm Desert, subject to the same conditions, and to the condition that the cities must maintain signs for the route. La Quinta was added to the list of eligible cities in 2007. As of late 2007, none of these four cities have taken over maintenance of Route 111.

In November 2005, signs on Verbenia Avenue at the highway&#x27;s northern terminus and along Interstate 10 were replaced to reflect the street&#x27;s name change to &quot;Haugen-Lehmann Way&quot;, honoring two Riverside County sheriff&#x27;s deputies gunned down by a sniper on that street in 1997.

In a similar move in December 2005, the stretch of SR 111 through La Quinta was named the &quot;Deputy Bruce Lee Memorial Highway&quot;. Lee was a Riverside County deputy sheriff in the city for many years and was killed in 2003 during an altercation with a mentally disturbed suspect. The suspect was able to take Lee&#x27;s baton during the altercation and used it to bludgeon the officer.

In September 2019 Caltrans began a three-phase $19-21.5 million mitigation project to protect SR-111 from a moving mud pot called the Niland Geyser, southeast of the Salton Sea near the junction with Davis and Gillespie Roads. The plans included using steel walls to divert water into a gravel wash, digging drainage under the road to direct subsurface water to a wash west of the road, and building a five-mile temporary road 50 feet to the west to divert around the geyser, with the original road being rebuilt once the geyser had passed. Work continued into 2021.

After being Imperial Avenue in Calexico, the road is known as the Imperial Pioneers Expressway and the Victor Veysey Expressway in Imperial County. Several parts of the route are at or under sea level, similar to SR 86 outside of Brawley.

== Major intersections ==











==Related route==

State Route 111 Business (SR 111 Bus.) is a business route of SR 111 in Palm Springs. It follows the original routing of SR 111 through Palm Springs. The route is almost unsigned. There are only two business route signs on the southern and northern termini.
Like many other business routes, it follows the original routing of the parent route. In 1993, SR 111 was rerouted out of Palm Springs and onto the current alignment.

<text>Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH () is a multinational company that coordinates the design, production and upgrade of the Eurofighter Typhoon military jet. 

Founded in 1986, it has its head office in Hallbergmoos, Germany. The company is owned by the major aerospace companies of the four Eurofighter partner nations:

* 46%: Airbus Defence and Space (then known as EADS) (France, Germany and Spain)
* 33%: BAE Systems Military Air &amp; Information (United Kingdom)
* 21%: Leonardo (Italy)
The Typhoon’s engine is designed and manufactured by EuroJet Turbo GmbH, another consortium of European companies. 

Eurofighter&#x27;s customer is the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency (NETMA), operating on behalf of the partner nations. The production and management model closely follows that of the earlier Tornado fighter jet programme. In that case, the Panavia Aircraft partnership was responsible for delivering the aircraft, and the Turbo-Union consortium was responsible for the propulsion system.

==History==
The first production contract was signed on 30 January 1998 between Eurofighter GmbH, Eurojet and NETMA. The procurement totals were as follows: the UK 232, Germany 180, Italy 121, and Spain 87. Production was again allotted according to procurement: BAe (37.42%), DASA (29.03%), Aeritalia (19.52%), and CASA (14.03%). However, during 1995, concerns over workshare, which was based on the number of units intended to be ordered by each contributing nation, were voiced, as all nations involved has opted to reduce their orders following the end of the Cold War and the enactment of the Peace Dividend. The UK cut its orders from 250 to 232, Germany from 250 to 140, Italy from 165 to 121 and Spain from 100 to 87. According to these order levels the workshare split should have been 39/24/22/15 UK/Germany/Italy/Spain, however Germany was unwilling to give up such a large amount of work. In January 1996, after much negotiation between German and UK partners, a compromise was reached whereby Germany would purchase another 40 aircraft. The workshare split was 43% for EADS MAS in Germany and Spain; 37.5% BAE Systems in the UK; and 19.5% for Alenia in Italy.

The maiden flight of the Eurofighter prototype took place in Bavaria on 27 March 1994, flown by DASA chief test pilot Peter Weger. On 9December 2004, Eurofighter Typhoon IPA4 began three months of Cold Environmental Trials (CET) at the Vidsel Air Base in Sweden, the purpose of which was to verify the operational behaviour of the aircraft and its systems in temperatures between −25 and 31 °C. The maiden flight of Instrumented Production Aircraft7 (IPA7), the first fully equipped Tranche2 aircraft, took place from EADS&#x27; Manching airfield on 16 January 2008.

In September 1998, contracts were signed for production of 148 Tranche1 aircraft and procurement of long lead-time items for Tranche2 aircraft. In March 2008, the final aircraft out of Tranche1 was delivered to the German Air Force, with all successive deliveries being at the Tranche2 standard. On 21 October 2008, the first two of 91 Tranche2 aircraft, ordered four years before, were delivered to RAF Coningsby.
In October 2008, the Eurofighter nations were considering splitting the 236-fighter Tranche3 into two parts. In June 2009, RAF Air Chief Marshal Sir Glenn Torpy suggested that the RAF fleet could be 123 jets, instead of the 232 previously planned. In spite of this reduced requirement, on 14 May 2009 British Prime Minister Gordon Brown confirmed the UK would move ahead with the third batch purchase. A contract for the first part, Tranche 3A, was signed during July 2009 for 112 aircraft split across the four partner nations, including 40 aircraft for the UK, 31 for Germany, 21 for Italy and 20 for Spain. These 40 aircraft were said to have fully covered the UK&#x27;s obligations in the project due to cost overruns. In February 2019, Germany ordered 33 further Typhoons to replace ageing Tranche1 aircraft.

The Eurofighter Typhoon is unique in modern combat aircraft in that there are four separate assembly lines. Each partner company assembles its own national aircraft, but builds the same parts for all aircraft (including exports); Premium AEROTEC (main centre fuselage), EADS CASA (right wing, leading edge slats), BAE Systems (front fuselage (including foreplanes), canopy, dorsal spine, tail fin, inboard flaperons, rear fuselage section) and Leonardo (left wing, outboard flaperons, rear fuselage sections).

Production is divided into three tranches (see table below). Tranches are a production/funding distinction, and do not imply an incremental increase in capability with each tranche. Tranche3 are based on late Tranche2 aircraft with improvements added. Tranche3 was split into A and B parts. Tranches were further divided up into production standard/capability blocks and funding/procurement batches, though these did not coincide, and are not the same thing; e.g., the Eurofighter designated &quot;FGR4&quot; by the RAF is a Tranche 1, block 5. Batch1 covered block 1, but batch2 covered blocks 2, 2B and 5. On 25 May 2011 the 100th production aircraft, ZK315, rolled off the production line at BAE Systems&#x27; site at Warton.

<doc id="735794" wikidata="Q11728865" url="?curid=735794" title="Judiciary Act of 1789">
<text>The Judiciary Act of 1789 (ch. 20, ) was a United States federal statute enacted on September 24, 1789, during the first session of the First United States Congress. It established the federal judiciary of the United States. Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution prescribed that the &quot;judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and such inferior Courts&quot; as Congress saw fit to establish. It made no provision for the composition or procedures of any of the courts, leaving this to Congress to decide.

The existence of a separate federal judiciary had been controversial during the debates over the ratification of the Constitution. Anti-Federalists had denounced the judicial power as a potential instrument of national tyranny. Indeed, of the ten amendments that eventually became the Bill of Rights, five (the fourth through the eighth) dealt primarily with judicial proceedings. Even after ratification, some opponents of a strong judiciary urged that the federal court system be limited to a Supreme Court and perhaps local admiralty judges. Congress, however, decided to establish a system of federal trial courts with broader jurisdiction, thereby creating an arm for enforcement of national laws within each state.

==Legislative history==
Senator Richard Henry Lee (AA-Virginia) reported the judiciary bill out of committee on June 12, 1789; Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut, who would go on to serve as the third Chief Justice of the United States, was its chief author. The bill passed the Senate 14–6 on July 17, 1789, and the House of Representatives then debated the bill in July and August 1789. The House passed an amended bill 37–16 on September 17, 1789. The Senate struck four of the House amendments and approved the remaining provisions on September 19, 1789. The House passed the Senate&#x27;s final version of the bill on September 21, 1789. U.S. President George Washington signed the Act into law on September 24, 1789.

==Provisions of the Act==
The Act set the number of Supreme Court justices at six: one Chief Justice and five Associate Justices. The Supreme Court was given exclusive original jurisdiction over all civil actions between states, or between a state and the United States, as well as over all suits and proceedings brought against ambassadors and other diplomatic personnel; and original, but not exclusive, jurisdiction over all other cases in which a state was a party and any cases brought by an ambassador. The Court was given appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the federal circuit courts as well as decisions by state courts holding invalid any statute or treaty of the United States; or holding valid any state law or practice that was challenged as being inconsistent with the federal constitution, treaties, or laws; or rejecting any claim made by a party under a provision of the federal constitution, treaties, or laws.


The Act also created 13 judicial districts within the 11 states that had then ratified the Constitution (North Carolina and Rhode Island were added as judicial districts in 1790, and other states as they were admitted to the Union). Each state comprised one district, except for Virginia and Massachusetts, each of which comprised two. Massachusetts was divided into the District of Maine (which was then part of Massachusetts) and the District of Massachusetts (which covered modern-day Massachusetts). Virginia was divided into the District of Kentucky (which was then part of Virginia) and the District of Virginia (which covered modern-day West Virginia and Virginia).

This Act established a circuit court and district court in each judicial district (except in Maine and Kentucky, where the district courts exercised much of the jurisdiction of the circuit courts). The circuit courts, which comprised a district judge and (initially) two Supreme Court justices &quot;riding circuit&quot;, had original jurisdiction over serious crimes and civil cases of at least $500 involving diversity jurisdiction or the United States as plaintiff in common law and equity. The circuit courts also had appellate jurisdiction over the district courts. The single-judge district courts had jurisdiction primarily over admiralty cases, petty crimes, and suits by the United States for at least $100. Notably, at this time, Congress did not grant original federal question jurisdiction to the federal courts, which is why diversity has been described as the &quot;original&quot; and &quot;ancient&quot; jurisdiction of the federal courts.

Congress authorized persons who were sued by citizens of another state, in the courts of the plaintiff&#x27;s home state, to remove the lawsuit to the federal circuit court. According to Edward A. Purcell Jr., removal was the &quot;most significant innovation&quot; of the Act. The Constitution says nothing about removal jurisdiction, which &quot;was a powerful device to assert the primacy of the national judicial power over that of the states.&quot; 

The Act created the Office of Attorney General, whose primary responsibility was to represent the United States before the Supreme Court. The Act also created a United States Attorney and a United States Marshal for each judicial district.

The Judiciary Act of 1789 included the Alien Tort Statute, now codified as , which provides jurisdiction in the district courts over lawsuits by aliens for torts in violation of the law of nations or treaties of the United States.

==Implementation==

Immediately after signing the Judiciary Act into law, President Washington submitted his nominations to fill the offices created by the Act. Among the nominees were John Jay for Chief Justice of the United States; John Rutledge, William Cushing, Robert H. Harrison, James Wilson, and John Blair Jr. as Associate Justices; Edmund Randolph for Attorney General; and myriad district judges, United States Attorneys, and United States Marshals for Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Virginia. All six of Washington&#x27;s Supreme Court nominees were confirmed by the Senate. Harrison, however, declined to serve. In his place, Washington later nominated James Iredell, who joined the Court in 1790, thereby bringing the Court to its &quot;full strength&quot; complement of six members.

The first six persons to serve on the United States Supreme Court (ordered by seniority) were:
The seniority of the associate justices was set by § 1 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which assigned seniority by the dates borne on the judicial commissions each justice received from President Washington prior to taking office. This rule setting seniority of the justices is today codified at Title .

==Judicial review==

A clause in Section 13 of the Judiciary Act, which granted the Supreme Court the power to issue writs of mandamus under its original jurisdiction, was later declared unconstitutional. In &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;, one of the seminal cases in American law, the Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional because it purported to enlarge the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court beyond that permitted by the Constitution. The case was the first that clearly established that the judiciary can and must interpret what the Constitution permits and declare any laws which are contrary to the Constitution as unenforceable. Thus, the Judiciary Act of 1789 was the first act of Congress to be partially invalidated by the Supreme Court.

<doc id="735803" wikidata="Q961201" url="?curid=735803" title="Lobi people">
<text>The Lobi belong to an ethnic group that originated in what is today Ghana. Starting around 1770, many Lobi peoples migrated into southern Burkina Faso and later into Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. The group consists of a little over a 1,000,000 people. They make up about 2.4 percent of the Burkina Faso population. The exact percentage of Lobis in Ghana and Ivory Coast is hard to quantify since they are often counted as part of larger groups like the Mole-Dagon of Ghana. Estimates however point to around 250,000 Lobis in both of these countries. [The Lobi people speak two main languages, which are the Miiwo and Birifor. Miiwo is widely spoken in Burkina Faso and Cote d&#x27;Ivoire while a majority of Lobis in Ghana speak Birifor. Oftentimes, people use the language Birifor interchangeably with Lobi, especially in Ghana.

== Background ==

Lobi is a blanket term that refers to several closely related ethnic groups that comprise roughly 7% of the Burkinabe population, including the main Lobi proper, Birfor, Dagara, Dorossy, Dyan (aka Jãa), Gan and Tenbo/Loron (aka Lorhon, Teese, Teguessie and Thuuna). It is important to recognize that among them, only the Gan belong to a politically centralized, and royal, society. Other groups are commonly referred to as &quot;acephalous,&quot; which is misleading, but is meant to signal the absence of centralized political authority. Traditions vary among the groups, but some share a common sense of identity through participation in an initiation ceremony called (or , which takes place every seven years. In terms of kinship, descent is bilineal. Many Lobi houses also share an architectural style, which consists of an earthen compound with walls made from horizontal courses. Most are single-story, and rarely include more than a few small, strategically placed holes to allow light in and to allow inhabitants to view the exterior surrounds. Historically, Lobi warriors used poisoned arrows to fend off attackers (including French colonists). Largely through the use of village and personal shrines, they also share animist beliefs in order to maintain a productive relationship with the spiritual world. They achieve this specifically through regular interaction with spirits called , which inhabit a wide range of natural areas and man-made objects, such as , or anthropomorphic shrine figures that are now also well recognized in the art world. are ambivalent beings that require regular offerings—via sacrifice—in exchange for a wide range of protective and benevolent actions. They are intermediaries with Thangba Yu, the remote Creator God.

The name Lobi originates from two Lobiri words: &quot;lou&quot; (forest) and &quot;bi&quot; (children), meaning literally, &quot;children of the forest&quot;. The Mouhoun River (also known as the Black Volta) is important to Lobi peoples for many reasons. In terms of migration history, it marks an escape from slave raiders in present-day Ghana. In myth, it symbolizes a dividing line between this world and the next. The Lobi crossed the Mounhoun centuries ago from east to west and settled in the lands and brought with them deep animist beliefs and superstition. According to Lobi legend, the spirits of the deceased must return across the river to rejoin their honorable ancestors in the ancient world.

== Lobi country ==

The Lobi inhabit parts of southern Burkina Faso. According to the director of the museum in Gaoua which is considered to be the capital of the Lobi, &quot;The Lobi is a farmer, a hunter and a herder, but above all he is a warrior&quot;. Victims of slave raids, rival clans and civil disputes, they are among the fiercest and proudest inhabitants of Burkina Faso and were constantly under attack from the Gwiriko and Kenedougou empires during the 19th century. Bakary Ouattara, brother of the founder of the Guiriko empire led an offensive against the Lobi in 1815, and despite setting fire to several villages he was eventually killed by a poisoned arrow. He was succeeded by Karakara who continued with the raids leading up to the devastating attack in 1850 where they suffered heavily and lost a great deal but were never completely defeated.

In June 1898, the French and the British made an agreement that the Lobi country would go under French jurisdiction. Attempts at controlling the peoples was difficult and the Lobi became known for their resistance using poisoned arrows in attempting to thwart the French colonial invasion.

== Animism ==
The Lobi are well documented for their animist beliefs, which involves regular interaction with ancestral and other types of spirits such as and . Interaction with these spirits commonly takes place in a (domestic shrine room), (village shrine), and at other places in nature inhabited by spirits. Christian missionaries working in southern Burkina Faso have reported that an elderly man in a Lobi village once renounced the spirits in favor of Christianity by discarding his fetishes in a nearby lake. As he turned his back on the traditions, the fetishes leapt out of the lake onto his back again to reclaim him. Lobi people who convert to Christianity or Islam now usually burn their fetishes. Or, they may sell them on the market.

In Lobi animism, Thangba Yu is the creator of all living things. Lobi peoples have no direct contact with Him, but are dependent on nature spirits known as , invisible intermediaries that can harness their supernatural powers towards good or evil. They set rules, , which dictate how a Lobi should behave in important aspects of life. Similar to Greek or Roman gods, themselves are subject to mortal virtues and vices. In Lobi society, there is often a (village diviner) that may also act as a (village priest; each village has only one) that interprets for the local community. A particularly intuitive and receptive is capable of interpreting as many as fifty or more spirits at a time.

== Architecture ==
Lobi dwellings are characterized as large rectangular or polygonal compounds known as . They are spaced well from each other and are composed of a single vast mud banco wall and a small entrance. An entrance to a Lobi house is a relatively recent development. At many houses, there is a ladder made from a large, Y-shaped tree trunk with notched steps, which lead up to the roof where inhabitants may access an interior granary and their own rooms below. Access to individual sleeping quarters is also available inside. Only the (or head of the household; there is no &quot;chief&quot; in Lobi society) can give permission to enter the house. The roof is broad and flat and forms a terrace which provides a lookout point but can also be used for sleeping in the dry season. Domestic animals have their own space, and water is gathered from a well or the river. The rooms inside a Lobi house are very dark, and the size varies in relation to function. Each wife has a room for herself and her children where meals are prepared. Large earthenware jars used to hold water or other personal belongings are often stacked up against the kitchen walls and are a testament to the owner&#x27;s economic status.

== Lobi art and marriage poles ==

Since the 1970s, Lobi art has become increasingly known in the West. Various researchers investigated Lobi art in the countries of origin. At the same time, collectors, enthusiasts, ethnologists and art historians in Europe and the USA began to look at objects from this culture in their collections. As a result, this ethnic group, which had previously received little attention in museums and among private collectors, received greater attention, the highlight of which was the reconstruction of the shrine of Tyohepte Pale in the Musée du quai Branly in Paris and the special exhibition &quot;The Discovery of the Individual&quot;, which opened in Lutherstadt Wittenberg in 2016. A special feature of Lobi art is the identifiability of individual carvers and workshops. This special feature, which distinguishes the Lobi from many other ethnic groups in Africa, was the focus of these two exhibitions and was explicitly expressed in the title of the Wittenberg exhibition &quot;The Discovery of the Individual&quot;. The individualism significant to Lobi sculptures has its origins in their akephalic social order.

Another type of creation by the Lobi is marriage poles. Marriage poles are made from Shea trees, which have significance in the Lobi every day. These poles also have black bands made from a dye that is then connected by a vertical strip. These bands are dyed into the poles and the bark of the tree is striped leaving contrasting bands down the length of the pole. Marriage poles are made by friends of the soon to be husband and are about three meters in height. The top of the marriage pole has a fork that a piece of cloth will be tied to after the new bride has arrived. The color of the cloth be white or red show the status of the bride and her attachment. These poles are placed along the pathways to a compound (&quot;soukhala&quot;) about ten meters apart. Some poles about halfway down have a tied bundle of leaves made from Shea like the pole itself and this is called &quot;kha&quot;.  The dye and the leaves are gifts from the bridegroom&#x27;s father. The dye is to encourage the bride to stay put and the leaves are a medicine to bring rain therefore it brings prosperity. However, when these leaves dry it can bring harm to others who touch it spiritually. The poles are placed in red clay and small clay figures can be found at the base of some marriage poles that are half buried in a small mound and huddled together. These are just one of the various types of “art” that exist in the Lobi culture.

<text>Naresuan (1555/1556 – 25 April 1605), commonly known as Naresuan the Great, or Sanphet II was the 18th king of the Ayutthaya Kingdom and 2nd monarch of the Sukhothai dynasty. He was the king of the Ayutthaya Kingdom from 1590 and overlord of Lan Na from 1602 until his death in 1605. Naresuan is one of Thailand&#x27;s most revered monarchs as he is known for his campaigns to free Ayutthaya from the vassalage of the Taungoo Empire. During his reign, numerous wars were fought against Taungoo Burma. Naresuan also welcomed the Dutch.

==Early life==
Prince Naret () was born in Phitsanulok in 1555–56. He was the son of King Mahathammarachathirat of Phitsanulok and his queen consort, Wisutkasat. His mother was a daughter of Maha Chakkraphat and queen consort Suriyothai. His father was a Sukhothai noble who had defeated Worawongsathirat in 1548 and put Maha Chakkraphat on the throne. Prince Naret, also known as the &quot;Black Prince&quot; (), had a younger brother Ekathotsarot, known as the &quot;White Prince&quot;, and an elder sister, Suphankanlaya.

During the siege of Ayutthaya during the Burmese–Siamese War (1563–64), King Bayinnaung of the Toungoo dynasty of Bago, Burma (formerly known in Burmese as &quot;Hanthawaddy&quot; () and in Thai as &quot;Hongsawadi&quot; ()) led a massive army, invading the country and laying siege to Phitsanulok. Maha Thammarachathirat came to believe that the city would not be able to withstand a long siege due to a scarcity of food and a smallpox outbreak, so he surrendered the city. King Bayinnaung took Phitsanulok and Ayutthaya, and made Thailand a Burmese tributary state. He required Maha Thammarachathirat to send his son—the Black Prince—to Bago as a royal hostage to ensure the king&#x27;s fidelity.

==At Bago==
The War of the first fall was ended by Bayinnaung, who installed Maha Thammaracha as a vassal king of Ayutthaya. After six years in Pegu, 1570, Prince Naret and his brother the White Prince returned to Ayutthaya. While in Burma, &quot;he followed the best of Burmese military training,&quot; studying alongside the &quot;elite of Burmese youth, sons of princes and nobles.&quot; &quot;Besides being gifted in military prowess, Naresuan who was highly intelligent, gained a great deal of general knowledge of the times.&quot;

==Viceroy==

Maha Thammaracha made Naret the &quot;Uparaja&quot; (&quot;crown prince&quot;) of Phitsanulok as Naresuan at the age of 15.

Naresuan joined his father and the King of Bago in an expedition to conquer Vientiane, the capital of the restored Lan Xang, but he contracted smallpox and had to return. He built Chankasem Palace in Ayutthaya as a residence when he visited his parents.

=== Cambodian attacks on Ayutthaya ===
In 1570, after seeing the fall of Ayutthaya to the Burmese, Baraminreachea, the Khmer King, took the opportunity to retake the lands lost to the Siamese. He amassed an army of 20,000 men and captured Nakhon Nayok. He continued to march to Ayutthaya and set up camp at Ban Krathum sub-district. After setting up camp, he also planned to attack the city. The Cambodian navy of 50 ships soon arrived at Bangkok and besieged it. King Maha Thammarachathirat issued a command to defend Ayutthaya. The Cambodian besieged Ayutthaya for 3 days, but the city stood strong. The Cambodian army was forced to retreat back to Cambodia and took a large number of prisoners with them.

In 1574, when the Ayutthayan Army under the command of King Maha Thammarachathirat and King Naresuan was assisting Bayinnaung in his campaign to attack Lanxang, Baraminreachea took the opportunity to attack Ayutthaya again. Luckily, King Naresuan contracted smallpox and was forced to return to Ayutthaya to recover. When he got back to Ayutthaya, the Cambodian Navy was present and besieging Nai Kai fortress. The fortress fell to the Cambodian forces. King Naresuan lured the Cambodian navy up the river where they met the Siamese artillery. After heavy bombardment, the Cambodian navy was forced to retreat. 

In 1578, Phraya Chin Chantu, a Chinese noble serving under Cambodia attacked the city of Phetchaburi. The attack failed and Phraya Chin Chantu was too afraid to go back to Cambodia. He was allowed to take refuge in Ayutthaya by Maha Thammaracha. Shortly thereafter, he boarded a junk and fled. At that time, King Naresuan was 24 years old and was aware that Phraya Chin Chantu was a Cambodian agent who took refuge in Ayutthaya under false pretenses to gather information on the Siamese court. He ordered Siamese boats to chase Phraya Chin Chantu&#x27;s junk. Since Chinese junks are much bigger than Siamese junks and were more suited for sailing out to sea, Phraya Chin Chantu was able to escape. 

In 1580, Baraminreachea still believed Siam was weak and ordered Thotsa Racha and Surin Racha to invade Siam with a force of 5,000, including elephants and cavalry. The plan was to raid cities around Ayutthaya such as Saraburi and capture loot and people. Naresuan led a force of 3,000 men out of Ayutthaya to engage the Khmer army. The Khmer army was destroyed and forced to retreat back to Cambodia. This battle made King Naresuan revered among the Siamese and Burmese courts. As a result of this, the Khmers did not dare to attack Thailand again.

=== Wars with the Taungoo Dynasty ===
In 1581, Bayinnaung died, and was succeeded by his son Nanda Bayin. Nanda&#x27;s uncle Viceroy Thado Minsaw of Ava then rebelled in 1583, forcing Nanda Bayin to call upon the viceroys of Prome, Taungoo, Chiang Mai, Vientiane, and Ayutthaya for assistance in suppressing the rebellion. On 2 February 1584, Naresuan left with his troops to Bago as ordered, and arrived at the border only in April. According to Damrong, this raised Nanda&#x27;s suspicions, who ordered his son, the Maha Uparaja Mingyi Swa, to remain in the capital and kill Naresuan. The Burmese chronicles say that Nanda made the decision to have Mingyi Swa guard Pegu prior to his march to Ava on 25 March 1584.

According to Damrong, Naresuan reached Kraeng the border town, where he learned that Phraya Ram and Phraya Kiet had been sent by the Maha Uparat to attack Naresuan from the rear while Maha Uparat attacked from the front. Naresuan called a council, which included priests, Phraya Kiat, Phraya Ram, and other Mons. Naresuan then &quot;poured water on the earth from a gold goblet to proclaim to the &quot;devatas&quot; in the presence of the persons assembled, that from that day forth Siam had severed friendship with Hongsawadi and was no longer in amity as of yore.&quot;

According to Damrong, Naresuan then levied the Mons to join his campaign and marched onto Bago, intending to free the Siamese families held captive there. However, Nanda Bayin had already defeated the viceroy of Inwa and was returning to his capital. Naresuan then retreated after freeing about 10,000 families. Mingyi Swa pursued with Surakamma in the advance element. The Burmese caught up with the Siamese at the Satong River. There Surakamma was killed by &quot;the royal gun used by Somdet Phra Naresuan while crossing the Satong river&quot;. This sent the Maha Uparat&#x27;s troops into a panicked retreat, prompting him to return to the capital.

Naresuan then held the &quot;ceremony of swearing allegiance&quot; with the people of Sukhothai, drinking water from the sacred pond of Puay Si. His forces then took Sawankhalok. In 1584 Naresuan brought down all of the men from the northern provinces to the Siamese capital of Ayutthaya in preparation for the attack of the Bago army.

In the same year Nanda Bayin sent two separate armies, one under his uncle the viceroy of Pathein, and another from Chiang Mai under his younger brother Noratra Mangsosri. Both were defeated in separate engagements before they could unite, and were driven back in retreat. Then in 1586, Naresuan defeated the Viceroy of Chiang Mai near Pa Mok and Bang Kaeo, capturing his encampment at Ban Saket with 10,000 soldiers, 120 elephants, 100 horses, 400 boats plus arms, ammunition, and provisions.

In October 1586, Nanda Bayin himself led the Burmese armies to Ayutthaya and begin the third invasion of Ayutthaya. Nanda Bayin armies laid siege to the city for five months, but failed to take the city due to an aggressive defense by Naresuan. He retreated.

In 1590, Maha Thammarachathirat died. In July 1590, Naresuan was crowned King of Ayutthaya as Sanphet II.

The Burmese army led by Phra Maha Uparat attacked Siam again, but Naresuan defeated it near Ban Khoi. The Burmese army retreated back to Bago, losing many men, elephants, horses, arms, and ammunition.

==Reign as King of Ayutthaya==

===The elephant battle===

King Naresuan is known in Thailand for his 1593 elephant duel with Crown Prince Mingyi Swa. However, most other accounts of the era mention an elephant battle but not a formal duel.

====Ayutthaya chronicle narrative====
In November 1592, Nanda Bayin ordered his son to attack Ayutthaya again. Mingyi Swa, Natshinnaung the son of the viceroy of Taungoo, and the viceroy of Prome formed three divisions. Mingyi Swa went through Three Pagodas Pass while the other two divisions came via Mae Lamao. The chief of Chiang Mai sent a boat force. Naresuan had been planning to attack Cambodia because of its border incursions, but then adjusted to the Burmese threat. Naresuan marched towards Suphan Buri and encamped his armies at Nong Sarai near the Thakhoi River. Naresuan formed a battle plan which involved a retreat, allowing the Burmese to follow, and then attack the disordered advance with his main army.

During the battle, in January 1593, the war elephants of Naresuan, &quot;Chaophraya Chaiyanuphap&quot;, and Ekathotsarot, &quot;Chaophraya Prap Traichak&quot;, were &quot;in musth&quot; and charged into the midst of the Burmese, with only a handful to Siamese being able to follow them in. According to Damrong&#x27;s reconstruction, Naresuan, seeing Mingyi Swa on an elephant under a tree, shouted, &quot;My brother, why do you stay on your elephant under the shade of a tree? Why not come out and engage in single combat to be an honour to us? There will be no kings in future who will engage in single combat like us.&quot;

The personal battle between Naresuan and Mingyi Swa was a highly romanticized historical scene known as the &quot;Elephant Battle&quot; ( .)

After a prolonged duel and narrowly missing Naresuan but cutting his helmet, Naresuan was able to cut Mingyi Swa with his ngao (glaive). Prince Somdet Phra Ekathotsarot was also able to kill the governor of Muang Chacharo. The main Siamese army then arrived and the Burmese were routed and scattered. The King of Bago then ordered the other two divisions to retreat.

Naresuan&#x27;s ngao, &quot;Chao Phraya Prap Hongsawadi&quot; or &quot;Chao Phraya which defeated Bago&quot;, and helmet, &quot;Chao Phraya Sen Phonlaphai&quot; or &quot;Chao Phraya which defeated a hundred thousand soldiers&quot;, still exist today. Naresuan built a pagoda on the site of the elephant battle as a victory monument.

Naresuan brought before a council of judges those commanders he thought had disobeyed him or were negligent in their duties; they had been unable to follow him into the middle of the Burmese. The punishment was death. However, Somdet Phra Phanarat, a bhikkhu from Wat Yai Chai Mongkhon, calmed Naresuan enough to have the punishment rescinded. Instead, the guilty commanders were ordered to take Dawei and Tanintharyi for redemption.

====Other accounts====
The Burmese chronicles, however, do not mention a duel at all. They say that the two armies engage in a battle on , and Swa was felled by a shot from a Siamese firearm. According to Terwiel, there are ten different accounts of the battle by indigenous, European and Persian authors: (four Siamese, one Burmese, four late 16th and early 17th century European accounts and late 17th century one Persian account). Only one Siamese account says there was a formal elephant duel between Naresuan and Swa. However, Jeremias van Vliet&#x27;s account of Siam in early 1630s includes interviews with Siamese subjects who were contemporaries of King Naresuan and who insisted that the elephant combat, which resulted in the death of the Burmese crown prince at the hands of Naresuan (whom the Siamese called &quot;the black prince&quot;), did indeed happen. According to Van Vliet&#x27;s Description of the Siamese Kingdom:

In Terwiel&#x27;s analysis of the other accounts, however, the Burmese crown prince and Naresuan both fought on their war elephant in the battle, although no formal duel probably ever took place. Per Terwiel, it is highly unlikely that Swa would have agreed to a formal duel since agreeing to do so would have &quot;jeopardized the costly invasion that had thus far progressed without a hitch.&quot; During the battle, Naresuan&#x27;s elephant got surrounded by the Burmese forces. During that crucial moment, a Burmese war elephant went musth, and attacked Swa&#x27;s elephant. Seeing that Swa was in difficulty, Naresuan &quot;closed in, and he (or one of the warriors riding with him, maybe a Portuguese) fired a gun which mortally wounded the crown prince&quot; Swa. Naresuan was &quot;lucky to escape from a very dangerous situation&quot; but also quick to take advantage of it. According to Terwiel, the &quot;Burmese and European accounts stayed closer to what actually may have happened&quot;, and &quot;Naresuan&#x27;s much repeated challenge to hold a duel, even though it looms large in many Thai history books, should be relegated to a legendary tale.&quot;

===Dawei and Tanintharyi===
In 1593, Naresuan sent Chao Phraya Chakri and Phraya Phra Khlang to attack Tanintharyi and Dawei, a Mon city, which fell after 15 and 20 day sieges respectfully. Nanda Bayin launched a Burmese fleet to defend those cities, but arrived too late and was defeated by a combined Thai fleet. Additionally, Burmese troops marching from Mottama were ambushed by the combined Chakri and Khlang force, resulting in the capture of 11 Burmese commanders, many elephants, horses, men, arms, and ammunition.

===Capture of Longvek===

In 1593, Naresuan then launched a successful campaign to subjugate Cambodia. He was said to have executed its king Nakphra Sattha, but this account is unlikely to be true since there is no evidence to support this claim, and historical accounts in Cambodia as well as from Spanish and Portuguese explorers say that Nakphra Sattha escaped to Vientiane where he remained until he died. 

Naresuan then brought Khmer families to populate his northern provinces.

===Capture of Mottama===
As Burmese control over the tributaries had weakened, the Mons took this opportunity to free themselves. The Mon governor of Mawlamyine rebelled against Bago and requested Siamese support. Naresuan sent troops to help and the Burmese abandoned their garrison at Martaban. Nanda Bayin then sent the viceroy of Taungoo to suppress the uprising, but his force was defeated. The Mon provinces then became subject to the Siamese Kingdom.

===Invasion of Bago===
Naresuan then decided to attack Bago in 1595. He laid siege on the city for three months before retreating when the viceroys of Prome, Taungoo, and Ava sent relief forces. Naresuan did take back many prisoners of war, lessening the fighting strength of the Burmese.

The Lord of Prome staged a rebellion against Nanda Bayin in 1595, followed by Taungoo, Rakhine, Lan Na, and Lan Xang. King Nokeo Koumane of Lan Xang prepared to march through Lan Na to Bago to rescue the people of Lan Xang held captive. The Viceroy of Lan Na Chiang Mai then submitted his territory to Siamese control and Naresuan sent Siamese forces to prevent Laotian forces from entering Lan Na.

After these series of upheavals in the Burmese Empire, Naresuan decided to attack Bago again in 1599, using Arakan and Taungoo as allies. However, before Naresuan arrived at the city, the forces of Arakan and Taungoo had already invested the city. The Viceroy of Taungoo ended up taking the populace back to Taungoo, abandoning the city to the forces of Arakan to loot what property was left behind, and then setting flames to the palace and monasteries.

===Invasion of Taungoo and Lan Na===
Naresuan occupied Bago while Minye Thihathu II, Viceroy of Taungoo, had already taken Nanda Bayin to Taungoo. Naresuan requested Minye Thihathu send Nanda Bayin back to him but Minye Thihathu refused, stating he was unwell. After that Naresuan laid siege to Taungoo for two months but retreated due to lack of food.

==Death==

Natshinnaung killed Nanda Bayin while he was held captive in Toungoo. Nyaungyan Min then crowned himself as the King of Ava to counter the Viceroys of Toungoo and Prome. Siam was then free of a Burmese threat for four years until the King of Ava went on a campaign to subjugate the Shans. When he advanced as far as Theinni, Naresuan raised an army of 200,000 men to counter the threat to his kingdom. He advanced as far as the Fang District of Chiang Mai Province before falling ill and then died after three days on 25 April 1605. His brother King Ekathotsarot became his successor as king.

Recent studies of Burmese records by historians of Silpakorn University showed that he returned to Wiang Haeng, where he died of disease, probably smallpox.

Many Shan believe King Naresuan was cremated and his ashes interred in a stupa in Mongton, in the Daen Lao Range, in the southern part of the Shan State.

==Legacy==
According to Damrong Rajanubhab, &quot;Naresuan was recorded as a brave and glorious king. Therefore his glory is evident up to the present day. The kingdom of Siam at that period was widest in extent, opulent and redounding in glory.&quot;

<text>The Auto-ID Labs network is a research group in the field of networked radio-frequency identification (RFID) and emerging sensing technologies. The labs consist of seven research universities located on four different continents. These institutions were chosen by the former Auto-ID Center to design the architecture for the Internet of Things together with EPCglobal. The federation was established in 1999; the network they have developed is at the heart of a proposal sponsored by EPCglobal and supported by GS1, GS1 US, Wal-Mart, Hewlett-Packard, and others to use RFID and the Electronic Product Code (EPC) in the identification of items in the supply chain for companies. The areas of expertise range from hardware to software to business research related to RFID.

==History==

The Auto-ID Labs is the research-oriented successor to the MIT Auto-ID Center, founded by Kevin Ashton, David Brock, Dr. Daniel Engels, Sanjay Sarma, and Sunny Siu with funding from Procter &amp; Gamble, Gillette, the Uniform Code Council, and a number of other global consumer products manufacturers. The MIT Auto-ID Center was created to develop the Electronic Product Code, a global RFID-based item identification system intended to replace the UPC bar code. In October 2003, the Auto-ID Center was replaced by the newly founded research network, the Auto-ID Labs and EPCGlobal, an organization charged with managing the new EPC Network. Auto-ID Labs is responsible for managing and funding the continued development of EPC technology.

==Research topics==
The research topics of the labs have gone beyond RFID-only research and now also includes sensor networks and new emerging sensing technology. Basically, the research can be grouped into three main areas: hardware, software and business layer. On the autoidlabs.org website, the Auto-ID Labs continuously publish their research results and provide an archive with over 150 white papers and academic publications. The following parts outline how the research is organized.

===Software and network===

*Focus group: Keio University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, KAIST

<doc id="735823" wikidata="Q55910" url="?curid=735823" title="Jerzy Buzek">
<text>Jerzy Karol Buzek (; born 3 July 1940) is a Polish politician and former Member of the European Parliament from Poland. He has served as Prime Minister of Poland from 1997 to 2001, since being elected to the European Parliament in 2004, he served as President of the European Parliament between 2009 and 2012. He is married to Ludgarda Buzek and is the father of Polish actress Agata Buzek.

== Early years ==
Jerzy Karol Buzek was born to a Lutheran family on 3 July 1940 in Smilovice, Czechoslovakia (at the time part of Nazi Germany and called &quot;Smilowitz&quot;). He was born into the prominent Buzek family, which participated in Polish politics in the Second Polish Republic during the interbellum. The family was part of the Polish community in the Trans-Olza region. Buzek&#x27;s father was an engineer. After the Second World War, his family moved to Chorzów. He is a Lutheran.

== Professional career ==
In 1963 Jerzy Buzek graduated from the Mechanics-and-Energy Division of the Silesian University of Technology, specialising in chemical engineering. He became a scientist in the Chemical Engineering Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Since 1997 he has been a professor of technical science. He is also an honorary doctor of the universities in Seoul and Dortmund among others.

From 1997 to 2001, Buzek was a coalition Prime Minister of Poland.

In 1998 he became the first laureate of the Grzegorz Palka Award and was nominated &quot;European of the Year&quot; by the European Union Business Chambers Forum.

In 1998 he was named &#x27;Person of the Year&#x27; by the influential Polish political weekly &quot;Wprost&quot;. He won the award for the second time in 2009. On receiving the award again, as President of the European Parliament, he stressed that he was the first winner to be honoured for his work beyond the borders of Poland.

He was the first Prime Minister of the 3rd Republic of Poland to serve a full term.Jerzy Buzek was the first Lutheran Prime Minister in the history of Poland.

After losing the parliamentary elections in 2001, he stepped back from political life and focused more on his scientific work, becoming the prorector of Akademia Polonijna in Częstochowa and professor in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering of the Opole University of Technology in Opole.

His return to political life in 2004 saw him gain the largest popular vote in Poland as the member for Katowice to the European Parliament standing for the Civic Platform.

Whilst President of the European Parliament, on 30 March 2011, he was awarded an honorary fellowship of the Institution of Chemical Engineers at a meeting of the European Federation of Chemical Engineering (EFCE) in Brussels, Belgium.

== Political career ==

In the 1980s, Buzek was an activist of the anti-communist movements, including the legal (1980–1981 and since 1989) and underground (1981–1989) Solidarity trade union and political movement in communist Poland. He was an active organiser of the trade union&#x27;s regional and national underground authorities. He was also the chairman of the four national general meetings (1st, 4th, 5th, and 6th) when the Solidarity movement was allowed to participate in the political process again.

Jerzy Buzek was a member of the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS) and co-author of the AWS&#x27;s economic program. After the 1997 elections he was elected to the Sejm, the lower house of the Polish Parliament, and was soon appointed Prime Minister of Poland. In 1999 he became the chairman of the AWS Social Movement (Ruch Społeczny AWS) and in 2001 he became the Chairman of the Solidarity Electoral Action coalition.

=== Jerzy Buzek&#x27;s government ===
Between the years 1997–2001 he was the Prime Minister of Poland, first of the centre-right AWS–Freedom Union coalition government until 2001, and then of the right-wing AWS minority government. His cabinet&#x27;s major achievements were four significant political and economic reforms: a new local government and administration division of Poland, reform of the pension system, reform of the educational system, and reform of the medical care system. AWS was defeated in the 2001 Polish parliamentary election. Buzek resigned as the chairman of AWS Social Movement and was replaced by Mieczysław Janowski.

=== Polish Member of the European Parliament ===
On 13 June 2004, in the European Parliament election, 2004, Jerzy Buzek was elected a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from the Silesian Voivodeship, basing his candidacy only on the popularity of his name and on direct contact with the voters. He received a record number of votes, 173,389 (22.14% of the total votes in the region). His current party affiliation is with the Civic Platform, which is a member of the European People&#x27;s Party.

In the 2004–2009 European Parliament, he was a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, an alternate member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, a member of the Delegation to the EU–Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, and an alternate delegate for the delegation for relations with the countries of Central America. He served as rapporteur on the EU&#x27;s 7th Framework Programme for Research and Development, a multibillion-euro spending program for the years 2007–2013.

On 7 June 2009, in the European Parliament election, 2009, Buzek was re-elected as a Member of the European Parliament from the Silesian Voivodeship constituency. Just as in the previous election, Buzek received a record number of votes in Poland: 393,117 (over 42% of the total votes in the district). On 12 September 2018, he voted in favor of approving the controversial Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market.

In the 2014–2019 European Parliament he was the Chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, responsible for industrial policy, EU research and innovation policy, space policy, energy policy and the application of new technologies. In the 2014–2019 European Parliament he remained a regular member of the Committee.

=== President of the European Parliament === 

On 14 July 2009, Buzek was elected President of the European Parliament with 555 votes of the 644 votes cast, the largest majority ever, becoming the first person from the former Eastern Bloc and the first former Prime Minister since Pierre Pflimlin to gain that position. He succeeded the German Christian Democrat MEP, Hans-Gert Pöttering. He pledged to make human rights and the promotion of the Eastern partnership two of his priorities during his term of office, which would last two and a half years, due to a political deal, Social Democrat MEP Martin Schulz who take over after that.

In his inaugural address in Strasbourg, Buzek stated that among the greatest challenges faced by the European parliament were the economic crisis, European solidarity, human rights, and reform within the Parliament itself. Buzek also stated he would be committed to reform of the European economy, tackling rising unemployment, energy security, and climate change, strengthening European solidarity and integration and promoting equal opportunities for women. However, Buzek noted that the Lisbon Treaty would be a prerequisite to any change &quot;(so that the Union can be) well-organised and effective&quot;.

On 8 December 2009 Buzek was awarded by the Ministerpräsident of North Rhine-Westphalia, Dr. Jürgen Rüttgers, the annual &quot;Staatspreis award&quot;. The prize was awarded in honor of his lifetime achievements and highlighted the European Parliament as a &quot;motor of integration.&quot; Affirming his commitment to the Eastern Partnership and &quot;those who do not have the possibility to participate in our European integration project&quot;, Buzek announced that the prize money would be donated to the European Humanities University (EHU), A Belarusian university in exile in Vilnius.

The Lisbon Treaty, which came into force on 1 December 2009 shortly after Buzek assumed office, brought a conclusion to nearly a decade of internal discussions and greatly boosted the democratic powers of the European Parliament. From very early on Buzek has been a vocal supporter of the treaty as part of a wider push for greater political integration in Europe. The rise in legislative powers under the treaty in fact represents almost a doubling in power. Since its introduction Parliament has equal rights with the Council of Ministers over 40 new fields within the &quot;co-decision&quot; procedure, such as agriculture, energy security, immigration, justice and home affairs, health and structural funds.

In late 2011 Buzek&#x27;s presidency also endorsed the &#x27;Sixpack&#x27; legislation on economic governance to tackle the growing Eurozone crisis. This was a follow-up on the earlier Stability and Growth Pact and the Euro Plus Pact intended as a means of optimising macroeconomic surveillance in Europe and avoiding crises in the eurozone in the future. Welcoming the parliament&#x27;s adoption of the legislation on 28 October 2011, Buzek stated: &quot;The adoption of the six-pack by the whole European Parliament is good news for the European Union. We have a new economic rule-book. We have developed a powerful and resistant armour against any future crises. With the adoption of the six-pack, the EU significantly strengthens its budget discipline and moves towards true economic governance. We can not turn the clock back, but the package will ensure that Member States budgets will be credible.&quot;

One of Buzek&#x27;s major challenges as EP president was dealing with the allegations of corruption, illegal lobbying and mismanagement of public funds of which several members of the European Parliament have been accused in the wake of a cash-for-amendments scandal. On 7 July 2011, the Conference of Presidents approved the first-ever code of conduct for MEPs and it was officially endorsed by the parliament on 1 December 2011. The code sets out rules and principles that MEPs should follow in their dealings with outside parties in order to avoid conflicts of interest. &quot;Increased powers of the European Parliament must be accompanied by an increased transparency and accountability on behalf of its members&quot; Buzek has said of the code. According to the code, MEPs have to provide clear declarations of their paid activities outside parliament, as well as the salary they receive. They also have to declare all other activities which might constitute a conflict of interest. The code contains an explicit ban on MEPs receiving payments or other rewards in exchange for influencing parliamentary decisions. It also sets out clear rules on the acceptance of gifts and on the issue of former MEPs working as lobbyists.

<text>Alexander Sergeyevich Morozevich (; born July 18, 1977) is a Russian chess player. He was awarded the title of Grandmaster by FIDE in 1994. Morozevich is a two-time World Championship candidate (2005, 2007), two-time Russian champion and has represented Russia in seven Chess Olympiads, winning numerous team and board medals.

He has won both the Melody Amber (alone 2002, shared 2004, 2006, 2008) and Biel (2003, 2004, 2006) tournaments several times.

Morozevich is known for his aggressive and unusual playing style. His peak ranking was second in the world in July 2008.

==Career==
His first win in an international tournament was in 1994, when at the age of 17 he won the Lloyds Bank tournament in London with a score of 9½ points out of 10. In 1994 he also won the Pamplona tournament, a victory he repeated in 1998.

In 1997 Morozevich was the top seed at the World Junior Chess Championship, but lost to the eventual champion, American Tal Shaked, in a bishop and knight checkmate. That same year, Morozevich participated in the FIDE World Championship, where he eliminated former world champion Vassily Smyslov in the first round. He was knocked out in the second round by Lembit Oll. The next year Morozevich won the Russian Championship.

In 1999 he played in his first super-tournament in Sarajevo and finished in fourth scoring 5½ points of 9. In beginning of 2000 Morozevich participated at the Corus chess tournament in Wijk aan Zee and finished fifth out of 14 players. The event was won by Garry Kasparov ahead of Vladimir Kramnik, Viswanathan Anand and Peter Leko.

In the same year he participated in the FIDE World Championship played in New Delhi. Due to his rating he was seeded directly into the second round, in which he eliminated Gilberto Milos with the score of 2–0, then he proceeded to beat Evgeny Vladimirov 1½–½ in the third round before finally being eliminated in the fourth by Vladislav Tkachiev.

In Wijk aan Zee 2001 Morozevich became the first player to defeat World Champion Vladimir Kramnik after beating him with black. He shared fifth together with Alexei Shirov, behind Kasparov, Anand, Vassily Ivanchuk and Kramnik. In the 2001 FIDE World Championship, Morozevich beat Nugzar Zeliakov, Krishnan Sasikiran and Mikhail Gurevich before losing in tie-breaks in the fourth round against the eventual winner of the event Ruslan Ponomariov. In September 2005, Morozevich played in the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005 in San Luis, Argentina, taking fourth place behind Veselin Topalov, Anand and Peter Svidler.

In December 2006, he won the strong Pamplona tournament with a score of 6 points out of 7 and an Elo performance of 2951. He shared second place with Magnus Carlsen, behind Anand, at the 2007 Linares tournament.

His San Luis result earned him direct entry to the World Chess Championship 2007. In that tournament he scored 6 out of 14, placing sixth out of eight players. He was the only player who managed to defeat the reigning world champion Vladimir Kramnik (which was also Kramnik&#x27;s only defeat in 2007).

In December 2007 Morozevich won the Russian Championship for the second time, winning the last six rounds. In June 2008 Morozevich won the Bosna tournament in Sarajevo with a margin of 1½ points ahead of second place. Two months later he shared second place in the Tal Memorial after leading the tournament in early rounds. While officially being fourth in the world, Morozevich unofficially climbed to the top spot of the world rating list, but fell back to fourth by the end of the tournament.

In June 2011 he won the Russian Championship Higher League in Taganrog with 8/11, earning a spot in the Superfinal, in which he came second behind the eventual winner Peter Svidler. In October Morozevich won the Saratov Governor&#x27;s Cup in Russia with a score 8½/11, one and a half points ahead of the field, and a performance of 2917.

In February 2012 Morozevich came first in the Vladimir Petrov Memorial, a rapidplay tournament with the time control of 15 minutes plus 6 seconds per move. In 2014 he won the 15th Karpov International tournament in Poikovsky. Morozevich won the &quot;Magistral Ciutat de Barcelona&quot; tournament in 2015 on tiebreak over Axel Bachmann, having played more games with the black pieces.

===Team competitions ===
Morozevich had great successes in team competitions: in the Chess Olympiad he won the gold medal with the Russian team three times (1998, 2000, 2002), one silver medal (2004) and a bronze medal (1994).

He also won the gold medal in the World Team Championships in 2005 in which he beat the member of the Chinese team in the last round in a must win situation. He also won two gold medals in the European Team Championships (2003 and 2007).

==Playing style==
Morozevich is known to be an aggressive player with an unorthodox opening repertoire. He has on occasion played the Chigorin Defense (1.d4 d5 2.c4 Nc6) and the Albin Countergambit (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e5). He is also well known for preferring complicated positions. Due to his risky and spectacular style which produces relatively few draws, Morozevich is popular among chess fans.

In 2007, Morozevich published, along with co-author Vladimir Barsky, a book about the Chigorin Defense, called &quot;The Chigorin Defence According to Morozevich&quot;.

==Blindfold chess ==
Morozevich is considered to be one of the best blindfold chess players in the world. He has confirmed that status in blindfold sections of Melody Amber tournaments:

2002 first 9/11, 2003 shared second 7/11, 2004 first 8½/11, 2005 shared second 6/11, 2006 first 9½/11, 2007 shared second 7/11, 2008 shared first 6/11 and in 2009 shared fourth with Anand 6½/11.

==Go==
While in recent years, Morozevich has not been very active in chess competition, he has taken up Go. He has a Go ranking of 1 dan as of 2018. In July 2016, he beat Tiger Hillarp Persson in a 4-game mixed chess and go match.

<text>USS &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; (SSBN-735) is a nuclear-powered, United States Navy ballistic missile submarine that has been in commission since 1989. She is the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 29 November 1982 and her keel was laid down there on 10 January 1984. She was launched on 23 April 1988, sponsored by Mrs. Marilyn Garrett, and commissioned on 9 September 1989.

==Service history==
On 29 September 1989, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; ran aground as she entered the channel during her first visit to Port Canaveral, Florida. Tugboats freed her in about two hours. A US Navy investigation determined that &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was properly positioned in the channel, but the channel had been silted by the recent passing of Hurricane Hugo. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; had been rerouted to Port Canaveral shortly after another submarine had struck a buoy that had repositioned in the entrance channel of Kings Bay. Still, it was thought that the channel to Port Canaveral had been unaffected. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; received no damage. This was a rare occasion of a warship running aground and the commanding officer not being disciplined. Shortly after that, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; departed on her first strategic deterrent patrol, which lasted 82 days.

In 2001, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the United States Atlantic Fleet.

In 2009, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was featured in an episode of the British television documentary series &quot;Big, Bigger, Biggest&quot;.

In 2012, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; completed a mid-life -year Engineered Refueling Overhaul (ERO) at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, where her reactor was refueled for an estimated 25 more years of service.

On 14 June 2014, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; completed a record-setting 140-day strategic deterrent patrol. This is the longest strategic deterrent patrol completed since the beginning of the Poseidon C3 missile program in the 1970s.

<text>The Miami River is a stream, approximately long, on the coast of northwest Oregon in the United States. It drains a mountainous timbered region of the Northern Oregon Coast Range west of Portland, into Pacific Ocean.

The river rises in northern Tillamook County in the Tillamook State Forest and flows generally southwest, entering the north end of Tillamook Bay near Garibaldi. Descending swiftly from to near sea level, the Miami does not pass through any communities. It is one of five rivers—the Tillamook, the Trask, the Wilson, the Kilchis, and the Miami—that flow into the bay.

The river&#x27;s name is based on the Chinook Jargon phrase &quot;Mi-me Chuck&quot;, meaning a tributary or downriver stream. Over time the expressive became corrupted into &quot;Miami&quot;, the familiar place name used in Ohio, Florida, and elsewhere.

==Course==
Flowing generally southwest through the forest, the Miami River receives Prouty Creek from the about from the mouth. Further downstream, Peterson Creek and Minich Creek enter from the right before the river receives Moss Creek from the slightly more than from the mouth. Illingsworth Creek enters from the left and Struby Creek and Hobson Creek from the right just before the river passes under U.S. Route 101. Electric Creek enters from the left as the river enters Miami Cove on Tillamook Bay. At this point, Garibaldi is to the river&#x27;s right. Miami Road runs along the lower stretches of the river.

<doc id="735842" wikidata="Q2003423" url="?curid=735842" title="Now and Then, Here and There">
<text>is a Japanese anime television series conceived and directed by Akitaro Daichi, with a screenplay by Hideyuki Kurata. It premiered in Japan on the WOWOW television station on October 14, 1999 and ran until January 20, 2000. It was licensed for Region 1 DVD English language release by Central Park Media under their US Manga Corps label. Following the 2009 bankruptcy and liquidation of Central Park Media, ADV Films rescued the series for a boxset re-release on July 7, 2009. However, the ADV re-release is now out of print. The series is available for purchase through iTunes, YouTube and Google Play.

&quot;Now and Then, Here and There&quot; follows a young boy named Shuzo &quot;Shu&quot; Matsutani who, in an attempt to save an unknown girl, is transported to another world which may be the Earth in the far future. The world is desolate and militarized, survival is a daily struggle for displaced refugees, and water is a scarce commodity.

==Plot==
While walking home from school, &quot;Shu&quot;, the main protagonist and a boy who loves kendo, intercedes to protect a girl, Lala-Ru, who is attacked by abductors piloting dragon-like mechas and is accidentally transported to the attackers&#x27; world as a result—a wasteland devoid of water and dominated by a red giant star. Lala-Ru possesses a pendant containing a vast reservoir of water, and she has the ability to control it.

Shu is trapped in this new, harsh reality, and he is beaten and interrogated repeatedly inside the warship commanded by the ruthless, manic dictator, Hamdo. While locked in a cell he meets an abducted girl who introduces herself as Sara Ringwalt of America. Sara&#x27;s reason for her capture was being mistaken for Lala-Ru by Hamdo&#x27;s minions. Sara is forced into the quarters of exceptional soldiers to be impregnated and is traumatized by her repeated rape. After an assault by an unknown enemy landship, Shu is forced to join an army of child soldiers; children trained for the looting of villages, in which they kidnap female villagers for breeding, and conscript orphaned male children into the ever dwindling ranks of Hamdo&#x27;s army.

It is a haunting story of a dystopian world, and of Shu, who has to endure torture, hunger, and the horrors of war in order to save the lonely girl he found sitting atop a smokestack. Much of the series deals with serious moral issues relating to war and famine, the consequences of war, slavery, rape, and the exploitation of children.

==Characters==
* is a student of kendo and carries a shinai, though he fights primarily with a wooden stick, which also is a motif for his non-lethal combat style. After being thrust into a new world and brutally interrogated, he is forced to join the child army of Hellywood. Shu&#x27;s character is strong-willed, uncompromising, obstinate, and believes that good can come from all situations. His devotion to protect Lala-Ru is one of the main aspects of the story. His experiences and interactions with Lala-Ru, Hamdo, and Nabuca open his eyes to the new world. Despite overwhelming odds, he retains his principles of not killing and of believing that good will still come while one is alive. After saving the world by convincing Lala-Ru that people are good, Shu is sent back home by a reformed Abelia. 
* possesses the power to manipulate water using a pendant containing a now nearly-depleted water reservoir, which is directly tied to her physical strength and health. She is quiet and non-violent (often failing to resist violence against her) and appears to be a child, although her age is unknown (she claims to be thousands of years old). Due to her long and disillusioned experience with humans, she feels little to no emotions with them. Her relationship with Shu changes her to be more protective and open with Shu and Sis; Shu for risking his life despite being in a foreign land as well as knowing nothing about her, and Sis for treating her like a daughter despite not knowing her very long. After using her power to flood Hellywood and parts of the world with water she soon vanished from existence right next to Shu after seeing the sunset for the last time. 
* , the military leader of a kingdom called Hellywood, he is a shrewd but has the mentality of a spoiled ten-year-old child, paranoid megalomaniac. He feels a sense of entitlement to water, an essential resource in his plans to rule the Earth, that leads to an obsession with the mysterious Lala-Ru and the suppression of any who stand in his way. Water is also required to launch his flying fortress, which is powered by water. In a quest to secure water and other resources needed for his ultimate goal, Hamdo&#x27;s army abducts children and other villagers to use as human capital in his endeavor. Hamdo suffers from uncontrollable bursts of rage. In a gruesome display of his blind emotion, he kills a cat, only to throw it on the ground and step on it later while interrogating Shu. Later in the series, Hamdo&#x27;s lust for water and power begets paranoia and he begins to doubt the loyalty of his adviser. He died at the end of the series when he drowned in the transport chamber (all the while suffering a complete mental breakdown, screaming and shrieking like a frightened child), his lifeless corpse dragged away by the current. 
* is the devoted commanding officer of Hamdo&#x27;s army. She is a capable military strategist, though Hamdo does not always heed her advice. Abelia thanklessly yields to the whim of her senior. By the series&#x27; end, she&#x27;d given up on supporting Hamdo&#x27;s ambitions and leaves him to die amidst the chaos of his eroding empire. She then joins the free world to establish a peaceful future alongside them. 
* is the leader of the child army unit Shu is forced to join. He resents Shu and sees him as a troublemaker. He feels ashamed for Shu having saved his life during a fight. Nabuca, just a child himself, devotes himself entirely to the army in the hopes that he will someday be allowed to return to his home. He repeatedly tells himself that what he does is the only thing that will enable him to return home, and this thought is the only thing keeping him going. Once Boo dies trying to protect him, he eventually comes to realize all too late the nature of his actions and has a sudden change of heart. In the last episode, he is betrayed and mortally wounded by Tabool, one of the boys in his unit and the only other survivor from their village. After painfully making his way to the jail cell where Shu is being kept with other prisoners from Zari-Bars, he tells Shu to go back to where he came from and that it is where he belongs. He dies immediately after in the arms of Shu who holds him through the prison cell bars. 
* is the youngest soldier in Nabuca&#x27;s unit and his closest companion. He is naïve, and like Nabuca, believes he will be sent home after the war until then end where he loses hope of regaining a sense of normalcy and cannot go on. Boo dies during the invasion of Zari-Bars in episode 12 where he takes a bullet for Nabuca. 
* is an American girl who is mistaken for Lala-Ru and is kidnapped on her way to pick up her father from work. She is taken to Hellywood where she is regularly raped by the Hellywood soldiers, one of whom she kills in self-defense. After escaping from Hellywood, she is rescued from the desert sands by Sis who brings her to Zari-Bars. Sara resents Lala-Ru and blames her solely for the predicament she is in. Unable to cope with the pain of being raped and carrying a child as a result of her ordeal, she attempts to commit suicide and abort the baby by pounding a rock into her abdomen. Shu, however, intervenes, taking the blows of the rock on his hand which he uses to cover her abdomen. Sis&#x27; dying request that she not hate the faultless baby changes Sara&#x27;s mind and she decides to stay in the desert world with her baby, Sis&#x27; orphans, and ex-Hellywood child soldiers to start a new life. 
* is a boy soldier in Nabuca&#x27;s unit who came from the same village as Nabuca. He appears captivated with the actions of Hamdo and his war and is uninterested in returning home. He is attracted to the strength of the military, and bullies others in the unit. In the final episode, he shoots and mortally wounds Nabuca, and not long after, he dies while trying to survive Hellywood&#x27;s destruction by Lala-Ru&#x27;s flood, being drowned in the water and his lifeless body sucked away by the current. 
* is a tough and respected member of the city-state Zari-Bars. She acts as a caretaker and stand-in mother for the children who were orphaned as result of the war state. She advocates non-violence. When Sis tries to stop Elamba from taking Lala-Ru hostage, she is shot in the leg and dies in the final episode from the bleeding. 
* is the leader of the radical faction at Zari-Bars. His entire family was murdered by Hellywood&#x27;s soldiers. Periodically, he sends assassins into Hellywood to try to kill King Hamdo. Ironically, Elamba&#x27;s ruthless methods resemble those of the man he hates. He seizes Lala-Ru and tries unsuccessfully to use her to negotiate with Hellywood. This ends with him being sprayed by bullets and falling to his death. 
* is a quiet young girl living with Sis and the orphans in Zari-Bars. She spends many days separated from the other children her age in hopes that her father may one day return. Little does she know that her father was one of Elamba&#x27;s assassins that died at the hands of Nabuca and the other Hellywood soldiers. In the meanwhile, she begins to open up to both Shu and Lala-Ru, requesting that they stay even when the radicals of the village turn against them. When she overhears Nabuca admit to killing the assassins, Soon attempts to kill Nabuca with a rifle but fails to do so due to Boo&#x27;s self-sacrifice. Nabuca, horrified and almost reflexively shoots her to death in return.

===Anime episode list===
===Soundtrack===
Released 1999, the &quot;Now and Then, Here and There&quot; contains seventeen tracks, including the opening and ending sequences. Most of the tracks are performed by Taku Iwasaki (credited as Takumi Iwasaki) with one track performed by Toshio Masuda and one performed by Masuda and Reiko Yasuhara.

==Reception==
The show was very well received by critics and also received comparisons to &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot;. AnimeOnDVD.com stated &quot;Now and Then, Here and There&quot; is &quot;a wonderfully scripted show, where each line of dialog seems to be said with some larger purpose behind it.&quot; Of the events of war, the show continues a &quot;devastating and brutal feel throughout.&quot;. Commenting on the realism of the show, reviewer Chris Beveridge stated &quot;The story doesn&#x27;t flinch from putting people into the situations and resolving them in a way that they’d likely play out in real life.&quot; SciFi.com stated the show was &quot;a cruel series with a kindhearted message&quot; that contrasted brutality with a greater message. The review further mentioned:

Never before in anime have I seen a dead cat used as a motif and a metaphor. But like so many aspects of &quot;Now and Then, Here and There&quot;, this unusual artistic decision is a startling, effective and chilling one.

J!-ENT.com&#x27;s Dennis A. Amith stated that the series &quot;shows a perspective of war through the eyes of a young teen. The savagery, the brutality, and how even through darkness, hope can go a long way. A riveting anime series that is worth watching and even worth owning!&quot; Anime News Network reviewer Theron Martin called the series &quot;one of the best-written and most emotionally powerful anime series ever made.&quot;

<doc id="735852" wikidata="Q6412694" url="?curid=735852" title="Kingdom theology">
<text>Kingdom theology is a system of Christian thought that elaborates on inaugurated eschatology, which is a way of understanding the various teachings on the kingdom of God found throughout the New Testament. Its emphasis is that the purpose of both individual Christians and the church as a whole is to manifest the kingdom of God on the earth, incorporating personal evangelism, social action, and foreign missions.

==Theology==
Kingdom theology distinguishes between the current world ruled by Satan, the one we live in, and the world ruled by God, his kingdom. Kingdom theology holds the importance of the kingdom of God as a core value and teaches that the kingdom currently exists in the world, but not yet in its fullness. The theology maintains that the kingdom of God will come in fullness with Christ&#x27;s second coming. In the future fulfilment, evil and Satan will be destroyed and God&#x27;s complete rule on Earth established. Theologian and director of the Vineyard Bible Institute Derek Morphew argued that the kingdom of God encompassed both signs and wonders and social justice. Although kingdom theology presents history as a struggle between God and Satan, there is an eschatological expectation that God will triumph over Satan, which is why suffering for the sake of the kingdom is accepted.

In more Charismatic circles, kingdom theology attempts to be able to explain both spiritual victory and continued spiritual warfare, and why some people are seen to be healed by the Holy Spirit and some are not. These kingdom theologians have argued that, because of this, a tension will exist between the apparent successes and failures of prayer. Theologian Don Williams argued that to pray means to ask the future kingdom to break into the present world, rather than being to call down perfection from heaven. Kingdom theology proposes values based on the spiritual world, often different from what Harold Bender and Robert Friedman term the &quot;secular values&quot; of Jesus, such as when Jesus urges his listeners, &quot;Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven, For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust&quot; (Mt. 5:44-45) in the Sermon on the Mount.

===Eschatology===
George Eldon Ladd believed that the Bible taught of two ages: &#x27;This Age&#x27; and &#x27;The Age to Come&#x27;. In &#x27;This Age&#x27;, there will be hostility to Christianity but in the &#x27;Age to Come&#x27; those who have followed Jesus will be free from oppression and given eternal life. He believed that &#x27;The Age to Come&#x27; would be inaugurated by the second coming of Jesus and the resurrection of the dead. Ladd argued that there is an overlap between the two ages; he suggested that, although the &#x27;Age to Come&#x27; is in the future, it can still be &quot;tasted&quot; now, and its power can penetrate &#x27;This Age&#x27;. The Vineyard movement&#x27;s statement of faith relating to the last book of the bible, Revelation, states that God&#x27;s kingdom came through Jesus and continues to come through the Holy Spirit. It suggests that, when Jesus comes again, Satan will be defeated, the dead will be raised, the final judgement will happen, and God&#x27;s kingdom will be fully established.

== History and influence ==
This theological concept of &quot;already&quot; and &quot;not yet&quot; was proposed by Princeton theologian Gerhardus Vos early in the 20th century, who believed that we live in the present age, the &#x27;now&#x27;, and await the &#x27;age to come&#x27;. Kingdom theology was more fully examined in the 1950s by George Eldon Ladd, then a professor of biblical theology at Fuller Theological Seminary. He argued that there are two true meanings to the kingdom of God: Firstly, he proposed that the kingdom of God is God&#x27;s authority and right to rule. Secondly, he argued that it also refers to the realm in which God exercises his authority, which is described in scripture both as a kingdom that is presently entered into and as one which will be entered in the future. He concluded that the kingdom of God is both present and future.

Doctrine of the kingdom of God caused controversy with Protestantism, regarding whether Christians should work to achieve the coming of the kingdom, or whether it is a divine gift from God. The evangelical movement regarded the extension of the kingdom of God as achieved through evangelism and missionary work. The philosophers Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Schleiermacher and Albrecht Ritschl believed that the kingdom of God referred to a world of ideal human relations and envisaged a perfect Christian society. This interpretation influenced the secularisation of the doctrine and the development of liberal theology in the 1930s, and the Social Gospel movement in the US.

John Wimber, the founder of the Vineyard movement, taught a particular application of kingdom theology, emphasizing signs and wonders as the coming of the kingdom of God, as well as Gordon Fee. The theology has been influential among the more Charismatic elements of evangelical Christianity, for whom it provides a theological framework for believing in the present-day activity of the Holy Spirit. It is officially embraced by the Vineyard Churches, and underpins many of its teachings.

<doc id="735854" wikidata="Q3315586" url="?curid=735854" title="Model minority">
<text>The term model minority refers to a minority group, defined by factors such as ethnicity, race, or religion, whose members are perceived to be achieving a higher socioeconomic status in comparison to the overall population average. Consequently, these groups are often regarded as a role model or reference group for comparison to external groups (outgroups). This success is typically assessed through metrics including educational attainment, representation within managerial and professional occupations, household income, and various other socioeconomic indicators such as criminal activity and strong family and marital stability. The prominent association of the model minority concept is with Asian Americans within the United States. Additionally, analogous concepts of classism have been observed in numerous European countries, leading to the stereotyping of specific ethnic groups.

The concept of the model minority has generated controversy due to its historical application to suggest that economic intervention by governments is unnecessary to address socioeconomic disparities among particular racial groups. Primarily evident in the American context, this argument has been employed to draw contrasts between Asian Americans (particularly those of East and some South Asian origins) and Jewish Americans in comparison to African Americans and Indigenous peoples. Consequently, this perpetuates the propagation of a &#x27;model minority myth&#x27;, asserting that Asian and Jewish Americans are exemplary law-abiding and productive citizens or immigrants, while concurrently reinforcing the stereotype that Indigenous and African American communities are predisposed to criminal behavior and dependent on welfare.

==Issues==
The concept of a model minority is heavily associated with U.S. culture, due to the term&#x27;s origins in American sociologist William Petersen&#x27;s 1966 article. Many European countries have concepts of classism that stereotype ethnic groups in a manner which is similar to the stereotype of the model minority. Generalized statistics, such as higher education attainment rate, high representation in white-collar professional and managerial occupations, and a higher household income than other racial groups in the United States are often cited in support of model-minority status.

A common misconception is that the affected communities typically take pride in being labeled as a model minority. However, the model minority stereotype is considered detrimental to relevant minority communities because it is used to justify the exclusion of such groups in the distribution of (public and private) assistance programs, and it is also used to understate or slight the achievements of individuals within that minority.

There are a wide variety of theories categorizing types of prejudices, and different types of prejudices are believed to be more at play towards different particular groups, one such model being the stereotype content model. Generally speaking, within the American and European social context, groups such as those with Asian heritage or Jewish heritage are believed to score high on perceived competence but low on perceived warmth and thus are thought to fall into the category of the &#x27;envied outgroup&#x27; within the context of this stereotype. Additional studies have shown that when describing a group with the term &#x27;model minority&#x27; and associated attributes, responses towards the out-group were significantly more negative than those using other positive attributes. Other scholars have discussed the potential for the stereotype to be the &#x27;positive spin&#x27; on the money-mad, stealing and/or greedy Jew or Asian. Recent additional studies have delved into the role of jealous prejudice in instigating certain historical mass casualty events, such as the Holocaust, noting that the theory of the venting of frustrations on an innocent but weak target is a notion that is part of popular &quot;folk psychology&quot; and should be re-examined, arguing instead that envious prejudice plays a relevant role in scapegoating in some social contexts.

The concept of the model minority has generated controversy due to its historical application to suggest that economic intervention by governments is unnecessary to address socioeconomic disparities among particular racial groups.

Furthermore, the notion of the model minority pits minority groups against one another through the implication that non-model groups are at fault for falling short of the model minority level of achievement. The concept has been criticized by outlets such as NPR and EU Scream for potentially homogenizing the experiences of Asian communities on one side and Hispanics and African Americans on the other, despite the fact that individual groups experience racism in different ways. Critics also argue that the idea perpetuates the belief that any minority has the capability to economically rise without assistance because it ignores the differences between the history of Asian Americans and the history of African Americans, as well as the history of Hispanics, in the United States. It has also been pointed out that the concept, which also has been criticized for over generalizing the success of some community members, has been used to invalidate and render less visible the racism faced by model minorities. Additionally, over generalizing based on a measure success for some members to make the point that racism is over and anyone stating otherwise is &quot;making excuses&quot; is not exclusive to those groups who have been called model minorities, and became a problem for some members of the African American community after Barack Obama&#x27;s Presidential election.

==United States==
One of the earliest uses of the term &quot;model minority&quot; was in the 9 January 1966 edition of &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; by sociologist William Petersen to describe Asian Americans as ethnic minorities which, despite their marginalization, have achieved success in the United States. In his essay titled &quot;Success Story: Japanese American Style&quot;, he wrote that the Japanese cultures have strong work ethics and family values which, consequently, lift them above &quot;problem minorities&quot;. Petersen believed that the success of Asian Americans paralleled the success of Jewish Americans. A similar article about Chinese Americans was published in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in December 1966.

=== Asian Americans ===
Although the term was first coined to describe the socioeconomic success of Japanese Americans, &quot;model minority&quot; eventually evolved to become associated with American Jews and Asian Americans in general, more specifically with East Asians (Japanese, Chinese, and Korean Americans) as well as Indian Americans and other South Asian Americans. By the 1980s, almost all major U.S. magazines and newspapers printed success stories of Asian Americans. Racial attacks against Asian Americans were reported since the early 1980s.

Some scholars have described the creation of the model minority theory as a partial response to the emergence of the civil rights movement, in which African Americans fought for equal rights and the discontinuation of racial segregation in the United States. In reaction to the success of the movement, white America, citing the accomplishments of Asian Americans, argued that African Americans could raise their communities up by focusing on education and accepting and conforming to the racial segregation, institutional racism and discrimination which were all being practiced at that time. At that time however, Asian Americans were also marginalized and racially segregated, which meant that they also represented lower economic levels and faced the same social issues which other racial and ethnic minorities faced.

A few years after &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; article about Asian Americans being the model minority was published, Asian Americans formed their own movement, in which they fought for their own equal rights and the resolution of their own specific social issues. It would be modeled after the Civil Rights Movement, thus, it would effectively challenge White America and the social construct of racial discrimination.

Those who resisted the emergent stereotype in the 1960s–1980s could not gain enough support to combat it due to its so-called &quot;positive&quot; connotations. At the time, this led many, even within the Asian American community, to either view it as a welcomed label in contrast to years of negative stereotypes, or view it as a euphemistic stereotype that was no more than a mere annoyance. Many believe that the stereotype comes with more positives than negatives. In contrast, many critics believe that there are just as many negatives as there are positives, or they believe that stereotypes should never be regarded as &quot;good,&quot; no matter how &quot;positive&quot; they are intended to be. Scientific studies have revealed that both socially and psychologically, positive stereotypes have many negative and damaging consequences. According to Marita Etcubañez, a director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Los Angeles, misconceptions about Asian Americans have an effect on government policy, as &quot;politicians won&#x27;t talk about our community&#x27;s needs if they assume people don&#x27;t require assistance.&quot; According to Yanan Wang writing for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, since the 1960s, &quot;the idea that Asian Americans are distinct among minority groups and therefore immune to the challenges which are faced by other people of color is a particularly sensitive issue in the community, which has recently fought to reclaim its place in social justice conversations with movements like #ModelMinorityMutiny.&quot; In his paper, &quot;Education and the Socialization of Asian Americans: A Revisionist Analysis of the &#x27;Model Minority Thesis&#x27;&quot;, B. Suzuki, a researcher of multicultural and Asian American studies at University of Massachusetts Amherst, disagrees with how the media has portrayed Asian Americans. Explaining the sociohistorical background of the contemporary social system, Suzuki argues that the model minority stereotype is a myth.

Since the creation of the model minority stereotype, Asian Americans have exceeded White Americans in terms of their level of education, as well as many other racial and ethnic groups in American society. , Asian Americans as a whole are considered as having obtained the highest educational attainment level and the highest median household income of any racial and ethnic demographic in the country, a position which African immigrants, and their first generation descendants, have just started to outperform them in. These statistics vary among the Asian American population. Historically, achieving economic and educational success was, and at times still is, seen as a gateway by different groups into greater social acceptance. This notion was shattered at different times for some people within American communities, for example within the Muslim American community dramatically in the wake of 9/11.

====Statistics====
There has been a significant change in the perceptions of Asian Americans. In as little as 100 years of American history, stereotypes of East Asian Americans have changed from them being viewed as poor uneducated laborers to being portrayed as a hard-working, well-educated, and upper-middle-class minority. Proponents of the model minority model erroneously assumed that Asian Americans&#x27; perseverance, strong work ethic, and general determination to succeed were extensions of their supposedly quiet natures, rather than common characteristics among most immigrants. Among Indian Americans, an example of the model minority stereotype are phenomena such as the high rates of educational attainment and above average household incomes in the Indian American community. Pointing to generalized data, another argument for the model minority stereotype is generalized data such as from the United States Census Bureau, where the median household income of Asian Americans is , higher than that of the total population ($50,221). Although some Asian American subgroups including East Asians and South Asians are economically successful, other Asian American subgroups such as Southeast Asian Americans which include Hmong, Laotians, Cambodians, and Vietnamese, are less socioeconomically successful. Asian Americans have developed the greatest income inequality gap in comparison to major racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. The economic gap in the standard of living between higher- and lower-income Asians nearly doubled; the ratio of income earned by Asians at the 90th percentile to income earned by Asians at the 10th percentile increased from 6.1 to 10.7 between 1970 and 2016, respectively.

The model minority model also points to the percentage of Asian Americans at elite universities. Model minority proponents claim that while Asian Americans are only 5% of the U.S. population, they are over-represented at all these schools. Additionally, Asian Americans go on to win a high proportion of Nobel Prizes. Of the 20 American physicists to win a Nobel Prize in the 21st century, East Asian Americans, who represent less than 4% of the U.S. population, have won 15% of prizes. Additionally, three science Nobel prizes have been won by Indian-Americans. Asian American students are concentrated in a very small percentage of institutions, in only eight states (and half concentrated in California, New York and Texas). Moreover, as more Asian Americans become Americanized and assimilated, more Asian American students are beginning to attend two-year community colleges (363,798 in 2000) than four-year public universities (354,564 in 2000), and this trend of attending community college is accelerating. West Coast academic institutions are amongst those that have the highest concentrations of Asian Americans.

The most highly educated group of Asian immigrants are Taiwanese. Education rates of Southeast Asians are low, but these numbers can be considered misleading, as a large percent comes from adult immigrants who came to the United States without any college education due to war. For ages 25 to 34, 45% of Vietnamese Americans have a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher compared to 39% of Non-Hispanic Whites.

Due to the impacts of the model minority stereotype, unlike other minority-serving institutions, Asian American Pacific Islander-serving institutions (AAPISI) did not receive federal recognition until 2007, with the passage of the &quot;College Cost Reduction and Access Act&quot;, which federally recognized the existence of AAPISIs, making them eligible for federal funding and designation as minority serving institutions. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s 2003 report &quot;Crime in the United States&quot;, Asian Americans have the lowest total arrest rates despite a younger average age, and high family stability.

====Indian and South Asian Americans====
The model minority label also includes Indian Americans, because of their high aggregate socioeconomic success. According to the census report on Asian Americans issued in 2004 by the U.S. Census Bureau, 64% of Indian Americans had a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, the second highest for all national origin groups. In the same census, 60% of Indian Americans had management or professional jobs, compared with a national average of 33%. Indian Americans also earn the highest median household income out of all national origin/ethnic groups and the second highest personal income, after Taiwanese Americans. This has resulted in several stereotypes such as that of the &quot;Indian Doctor&quot;.

It should however be noted that there are still pockets of poverty within the community, with around 8% classified as living in poverty.

==== Southeast Asian Americans ====
Arguably, the model minority stereotype masks the socioeconomic under performance of other Asian American subgroups and the experiences of Southeast Asian American populations in the U.S. serve to refute the model minority stereotype. For context, Southeast Asian Americans consist of several ethnic groups, including Burmese, Vietnamese, Hmong, Laotian, and Cambodian.

Despite high household incomes, many Southeast Asian Americans and other Asian groups such as Filipinos, Vietnamese, Indonesians, Thais, Laotians, Cambodians as well as South Asian groups such as Nepalese and Pakistani have lower per capita incomes then East Asians.
An empirical literature review shows that most of the existing data used to justify the model minority image regarding Asian American academic achievement is aggregated. As a result, this data ignores important differences among individual Asian ethnic groups. Although many Asian Americans have succeeded academically and socioeconomically, survey research shows that recent immigrant groups, such as Southeast Asians, have been unable to replicate such success.

According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the overall percentage of people 25 years and older with less than a high school education in the U.S. population is 15%, whereas Asian Americans, as an aggregate, are close at 11.1%. However, disparities exist when comparing South Asian Americans and East Asian Americans with Southeast Asian Americans. For example, only 13.6% of Chinese Americans, 4.0% Japanese Americans, and 6.0% of South Asian Americans ages 25 years or older have less than a high school education. In contrast, Southeast Asian Americans more than double the South Asian American and East Asian American percentages with 38.5% of Cambodian Americans, 39.6% of Hmong Americans, 34.3% of Lao Americans, and 51.1% of Vietnamese Americans ages 25 and over holding less than a high school education.

According to some studies only 39% of Filipino American men (ages 25–34) had attained a Bachelor&#x27;s degree, in comparison to 87% of Asian Indian American men, 69% of Chinese American men, 63% of Japanese American men, 62% of Korean American men, and 42 percent of Vietnamese American men. The same study showed that Filipino, Korean and Cambodian men with Bachelor&#x27;s degrees have lower median wages of $30 an hour compared to Chinese and Indian immigrant men who had median wages of $40 an hour. (Sanchez-Lopez et al ., 2017).

The 2010 U.S. Census shows that 52% of Asian Americans ages 25 and over hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, which is higher than the national American average of 29.9%. In contrast, the percentage of individuals aged 25 and over holding a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher amongst Southeast Asian American groups is much lower with only 44.4% of Filipino Americans and 21.2% of Vietnamese Americans falling within the aforementioned educational bounds. With the exception of Vietnamese Americans, Southeast Asian American representation in higher education is lower than other racial minorities, including African Americans (14.2%) and Latino Americans (10.3%). As cited in an empirical literature review, research that lacks differentiation between the varying Asian ethnic groups may mask under-performing groups as the higher performing groups raise the average. As a result, Southeast Asian American students are often overlooked due to the overwhelming success of their East and South Asian American peers.

As cited in a case study, many deficits of Southeast Asian American students&#x27; academic achievement can be attributed to the structural barriers of living in an immigrant household. Many Southeast Asian American students are children of refugees from countries at war. While the parents of Southeast Asian American students may have escaped death and persecution from their homelands, they often arrive in the US with fragmented families. As a result, refugees often lack resources, which causes them to not only rely on government assistance, but to also be placed in low-income communities near poorly funded schools. Additionally, families frequently have little to no understanding of the U.S. school system. Thus, Southeast Asian students are at a disadvantage as they have to quickly adjust to the new school system, while also keeping up with native-born students.

However, certain Southeast Asian ethnic groups have shown greater progress than others within the regional group and resemble the success of other more established Asian Americans. As cited in a case study, Vietnamese American students are beginning to show comparable rates of academic success to East Asian American students. Furthermore, among Southeast Asian American students, Vietnamese American students are recognized as having the highest academic performance, whereas Cambodian American students have the poorest performance. Although Cambodian and Vietnamese refugees endured similar immigration hardships, the aforementioned differences in academic success is attributed to structural and cultural factors. Another factor which may have an influence on Vietnamese American success is that the majority of 21st century Vietnamese immigrants to the United States are from non-refugee backgrounds, dissimilar from earlier migration patterns.

Despite this progress amongst Southeast Asian American students, the subgroup still struggles economically. Similar to data on academic achievement, information regarding Asian American&#x27;s economic prospects is frequently aggregated and thus hides the diversity of economic struggles amongst subgroups like Southeast Asian Americans. The high poverty rate amongst Hmong Americans places the group in one of the highest poverty brackets within the United States. Hmong Americans, more so men than women, have also been disproportionately racialized and criminalized via gangster stereotyping.

Additionally, median income levels differ amongst Asian American subgroups in which Southeast Asian Americans represent a disproportionate amount of low annual median incomes. This is illustrated by research in which Hmong Americans and Cambodian Americans have a per capita income of $10,366 in comparison to Indian Americans who have a per capita income of around $27,514 and Japanese Americans who have a per capita income of $30,075. By analyzing the individual economic data of Asian American subgroups, it becomes evident that the model minority stereotype, which puts forth the notion of Asian Americans achieving higher levels socioeconomic success, may be misleading. It is also written in Racial Wealth Snapshot by NCRC that Asian Americans disproportionately live in metropolitan areas where cost of living is high and that it is important to factor in household size and cost of living when talking about Asian Americans.

====Media portrayal====
Media coverage of the increasing success of Asian Americans as a group began in the 1960s, reporting high average test scores and marks in school, winning national spelling bees, and high levels of university attendance.

In 1988, the writer Philip K. Chiu identified the prevalence of the model minority stereotype in American media reports on Chinese Americans, and noted the contrast between that stereotype and what he observed as the reality of the Chinese-American population, which was much more varied than the model minority stereotype in the media typically presented.
==== Effects of the stereotype ====

According to Gordon H. Chang, the reference to Asian Americans as model minorities has to do with the work ethic, respect for elders, and high valuation of education, family and elders present in their cultures. The model minority stereotype also comes with an underlying notion of their apoliticality. Such a label one-dimensionalizes Asian Americans as having only traits based around stereotypes and no other human qualities, such as vocal leadership, negative emotions (e.g. anger or sadness), sociopolitical activeness, risk taking, ability to learn from mistakes, desire for creative expression, intolerance towards oppression or being overlooked of their acknowledgements and successes. Asian Americans are labeled as model minorities because they have not been as much of a &quot;threat&quot; to the U.S. political establishment as blacks, due to a smaller population and less political advocacy. This label seeks to suppress potential political activism through euphemistic stereotyping.

Another effect of the stereotype is that American society may tend to ignore the racism and discrimination Asian Americans still face. Complaints are dismissed with the claim that the racism which occurs to Asian Americans is less important than or not as bad as the racism faced by other minority races, thus establishing a systematic racial hierarchy. Believing that due to their success and that they possess so-called &quot;positive&quot; stereotypes, many assume they face no forms of racial discrimination or social issues in the greater American society, and that their community is fine, having &quot;gained&quot; social and economic equality.

Racial discrimination can take subtle forms such as through microaggression. The stereotyping of Asian Americans as a model minority and perfidious foreigner influences people&#x27;s perceptions and attitudes towards Asians and also negatively affects students&#x27; academic outcomes, relationships with others, and psychological adjustments. For instance, discrimination and model minority stereotyping are linked to Asian American students&#x27; lower valuing of school, lower self-esteem, and higher depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the psychological distress of failing to meet the model minority image, such as feelings of inadequacy, self-doubt, shame, and embarrassment, is exacerbated due to the differential treatment associated with being stereotyped as a model minority and perpetual foreigner.

Furthermore, the model minority image can be a threat to underachieving Asian American students&#x27; academic experience and educational advancement. It promotes invisibility and disguises the academic barriers and psychological problems students may encounter. This is problematic because it creates a barrier for educators to better understand and assist struggling students&#x27; educational and mental health needs in order to optimize students&#x27; academic experience and social emotional development.

Asian Americans may also be commonly stereotyped by the general public as being studious, intelligent, successful, elitist, brand name conscious, yet paradoxically passive. As a result, Asian Americans have felt as though they have higher and unreasonable expectations due to their race. Also due to the model minority image, Asian American students are viewed as &quot;problem-free&quot; and academically competent students who can succeed with little support and without special services. This emphasis that Asian Americans are being denial by their racial reality because of the assumption that &quot;Asians are the new Whites&quot;; therefore, they are being dismissed by their intelligence and experiences. Thus, educators may overlook the instructional needs and psychological concerns of underachieving Asian American students. The model minority stereotype can also contribute to teachers&#x27; having a &quot;blaming the victims&quot; perspective. This means that teachers blame students, their culture, or their families for students&#x27; poor performance or misbehavior in school. This is problematic because it shifts responsibility away from schools and teachers and misdirects attention away from finding a solution to improve students&#x27; learning experience and alleviate the situation. Furthermore, the model minority stereotype has a negative impact on the home environment. Parents&#x27; expectations place high pressure on students to achieve, creating a stressful, school-like home environment. Parents&#x27; expressed worry and frustration can also place emotional burdens and psychological stress on students.

Another result of Asian American&#x27;s regarded as a model minority is limiting the amount of accepted applicants to certain colleges.

Some educators hold Asian students to a higher standard. This deprives those students with learning disabilities from being given attention that they need. The connotations of being a model minority mean Asian students are often labeled with the unpopular &quot;nerd&quot; or &quot;geek&quot; image. Asians have been the target of harassment, bullying, and racism from other races due to the racially divisive model minority stereotype. The higher expectations placed on East Asians as a result of the model minority stereotype carries over from academics to the workplace.

The model minority stereotype is emotionally damaging to many Asian Americans, since there are unjustified expectations to live up to stereotypes of high achievement. The pressures from their families to achieve and live up to the model minority image have taken a tremendous mental and psychological toll on young Asian Americans. The model minority stereotype also influences Asian American students&#x27; psychological outcomes and academic experience. The model minority image can lead underachieving Asian American students to minimize their own difficulties and experience anxiety or psychological distress about their academic difficulties. Asian American students also have more negative attitudes toward seeking academic or psychological help due to fear of shattering the high expectations of teachers, parents, and classmates.

Overall, the model minority stereotype has negative effects on underachieving Asian students in both their home and school settings. It is a threat to Asian American students&#x27; academic experience and can disguise students&#x27; educational and mental health needs. Psychological distress from model minority stereotyping is related to the stressors associated with the pressure to succeed, differential treatment, and embarrassment or shame to seek help. With this information, a recommendation for schools is to promote a more inclusive and less competitive learning environment, so students will not be ashamed and afraid to ask for help. Administrators can also improve school climate by monitoring incidents of racial harassment and discrimination. Additionally, to better address struggling students&#x27; educational and mental health needs, educators can regularly check in with students and engage in culturally responsive teaching, aimed to understand students&#x27; unique circumstances and educational needs.

====Possible causes of model minority status====
=====Selective immigration=====
One possible cause of the higher performance of Asian Americans as a group is that they represent a small population in America so those who are chosen to move to America often come from a selective group of Asians. The relative difficulty of emigrating and immigrating into the United States has created a selective nature of the process with the U.S. often choosing the wealthier and more highly educated out of those with less resources, motivation or ability to immigrate.

Asian Americans are the nation&#x27;s fastest growing ethnic group due to their high rate of immigration. 59% of all Asian Americans are foreign born. The majority of Asian Americans are either 1st or 2nd generation immigrants, with the Asian-American population increasing from only 980,000 in 1960 to 22.4 million in 2019. Due to their high rate of immigration, the Asian American population nearly doubled from 11.9 to 22.4 million in the period between 2000 and 2019 – an 88% increase. For reference, the Black population grew by 20% during this span, while there was virtually no change in the White population.

Asia is a much larger pool of skilled workers as the continent has 4.2 billion people, 60% of the world population. This far outnumbers the next two most populous continents of Africa (15% total world population) and Europe (10%). 82% of Asian American workers in STEM fields were foreign born, as well as 81% of the entirety of the Asian workforce.

In 2016, Indian and Chinese nationals accounted for 82% of all issued H1-B Visas, a work permit that allows skilled foreign workers to go to the United States and work for American companies.

As of May 2016, 77% of the 1.2 million international students enrolled in the United States hailed from Asia.

=====Cultural differences=====
Cultural factors are thought to be part of the reason why East Asian Americans are successful in the United States. East Asian societies often place more resources and emphasis on education. For example, Confucian tenets and Chinese culture places great value on work ethic and the pursuit of knowledge. In traditional Chinese social stratification, scholars were ranked at the top—well above businessmen and landowners. This view of knowledge is evident in the modern lifestyle of many East Asian American families, where the whole family puts emphasis on education and parents will make it their priority to push their children to study and achieve high marks. Similar cultural tendencies and values are found in South Asian American families, whose children similarly face extra pressure by parents to succeed in school and to achieve high-ranked jobs. Although pressure is often perceived as a way to help East Asian American descendants achieve greater success, it can be used as a way to provide better income and living status for families. In other words, much of the East Asian American success in the United States can be due to the stereotypical yet favorable characteristics that their background holds. In most cases, East Asians such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese Americans hold a high position in terms of successful educational goals.

Others counter this notion of culture as a driving force, as it ignores immigration policies. In the mid-1800s, Asian immigrants were recruited in the United States as laborers for agriculture and to aid in the building of the first transcontinental railroad. Many worked for low wages in the harshest conditions. Confucian values were not seen as a key to success. It was only until the &quot;Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965&quot; changed the way Asians were seen, as Asians with higher education backgrounds were selectively chosen from a larger pool of the Asian population.

Further, it has also been argued the myth of the Confucian emphasis on education is counterfactual. It also implies Asians are a monolithic group, and ignores the fact that the most educated group of Asian immigrants in the U.S. are Indians, for whom Confucius is virtually non-existent in their upbringing. It has also been argued that self-selecting immigrants do not represent the actual Asian American population as a whole, nor the populations of their home countries. While 50% of Chinese immigrants in the U.S. have a bachelor&#x27;s degree, only 5% of the population does in their native China. Lastly, if Confucian culture played a vital part of Asian culture, Chinese immigrant children would perform consistently around the world, yet second-generation Chinese immigrants in Spain are the lowest academic achievers among immigrant groups in the country, and less than half are expected to graduate from middle school.

=====Asian American status in affirmative action=====
In the 1980s, one Ivy League school found evidence it had limited admissions of Asian American students. Because of their high degree of success as a group and over-representation in many areas such as college admissions, most Asian Americans are not granted preferential treatment by affirmative action policies as are other minority groups.

Some schools choose lower-scoring applicants from other racial groups over Asian Americans in an attempt to promote racial diversity and to maintain some proportion to the society&#x27;s racial demographics. In 2014, American business schools began a process to sort candidates based on their country of origin and region of the world they come from.

=== African Americans ===
Often overlooked is the direct contrast of model minorities with African Americans. It is the opinion of some that model minority stereotypes have historically been utilized to discredit African American racial equality movements, such as the civil rights movement, as they highlighted an alternative route to racial reform. African Americans were pushed to follow the lead of the idea of Asian Americans as the model minority, which was used to highlight that success as a minority was possible through hard work and support of the government. Since the success of Asian Americans was frequently attributed to distinctive cultural elements, researchers and policymakers argued that the struggles faced by African Americans was the result of a &quot;culture of poverty&quot;. Thus, politicians such as Assistant Secretary of Labor Daniel Patrick Moynihan suggested that fostering cultural change amongst African Americans was essential to address the overall issue of racial inequality. This is illustrated through Moynihan&#x27;s paper, &quot;The Negro Family: The Case for National Action&quot;, which argues for the need to intervene in African American families in order to establish familial values similar to those of Asian Americans. Other examples where people have been concerned about the potential political weaponization of this idea included Florida governor since 2019 Ron DeSantis proposed mandate for Asian American studies which was criticized by many in the Asian American community for proposing the mandate while simultaneously banning courses on institutionalized racism, one of the fears being the use of Asian American history to promote discrimination against other minorities through an &quot;untruthful representation&quot;.

While scholars of the civil rights era relied on cultural values to describe the varying successes of Asian Americans and African Americans, contemporary scholars have begun to examine the effects of the different types of racism the two ethnic groups experience. Essentially, racism in itself is not monolithic. Instead, it is perpetrated in different ways and different avenues of life in which anti-Black rhetoric often proves to be more harmful to Black personhood than situations involving anti-Asian discrimination. Such generalizations regarding Black peoples&#x27; inability to thrive in the United States fail to explain the high levels of success seen by Black African and Caribbean immigrants to America which surpasses the averages of all native-born American ethnic groups. Additionally, Black African immigrant women make up the highest paid group of women in country.

=== African immigrants as the invisible model minority ===
African immigrants and Americans born to African immigrants have been described as an &quot;Invisible Model Minority,&quot; primarily as a result of a high degree of success in the United States. Due to misconceptions and stereotypes, their success has not been acknowledged by the greater American society, as well as other Western societies, hence the label of &quot;invisible&quot;. The invisibility of the success of Africans was touched upon by Dr. Kefa M. Otiso, an academic professor from Bowling Green State University, who stated that, &quot;because these immigrants come from a continent that is often cast in an unfavorable light in the U.S. media, there is a tendency for many Americans to miss the vital contribution of these immigrants to meeting critical U.S. domestic labor needs, enhancing American global economic and technological competitiveness.&quot;

====Education====
In the 2000 U.S. census, it was revealed that African immigrants were the most educated immigrant group in the United States even when compared to Asian immigrants. Some 48.9% of all African immigrants hold a college diploma. This is more than double the rate of native-born white Americans, and nearly four times the rate of native-born African Americans. According to the 2000 Census, the rate of college diploma acquisition is highest among Egyptian Americans at 59.7%, followed closely by Nigerian Americans at 58.6%.

In 1997, 19.4% of all adult African immigrants in the United States held a graduate degree, compared to 8.1% of adult white Americans and 3.8% of adult Black Americans in the United States. According to the 2000 Census, the percentage of Africans with a graduate degree is highest among Nigerian Americans at 28.3%, followed by Egyptian Americans at 23.8%.

Of the African-born population in the United States age 25 and older, 87.9% reported having a high school degree or higher, compared with 78.8% of Asian-born immigrants and 76.8% of European-born immigrants, respectively. This success comes in spite of facts such as that more than 75% of the African foreign-born in the United States have only arrived since the 1990s and that African immigrants make up a disproportionately small percentage of immigrants coming to the United States such as in 2007 alone African immigrants made up only 3.7% of all immigrants in coming to the United States and again in 2009 they made up only 3.9% of all immigrants making this group a fairly recent to the United States diversity.

Of the 8% of students at Ivy League schools that are Black, a majority, about 50–66%, was made up of Black African immigrants, Caribbean immigrants, and American born to those immigrants. Many top universities report that a disproportionate of the Black student population consists of recent immigrants, their children, or were mixed race.

====Socioeconomics====
The overrepresentation of the highly skilled can be seen in the relatively high share of Black African immigrants with at least a four-year college degree. In 2007, 27 percent of the U.S. population aged 25 and older had a four-year degree or more; 10% had a master&#x27;s, doctorate, or professional degree. Immigrants from several Anglophone African countries were among the best educated: a majority of Black Immigrants from Nigeria, Cameroon, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe had at least a four-year degree. Immigrants from Egypt, where the official language is Arabic, were also among the best educated. The overrepresentation of the highly skilled among U.S. immigrants is particularly striking for several of
Africa&#x27;s largest source countries. The United States was the destination for 59% of Nigeria&#x27;s highly skilled immigrants along with 47% of those from Ghana and 29% from Kenya.

The average annual personal income of African immigrants is about $26,000, nearly $2,000 more than that of workers born in the U.S. This might be because 71% of the Africans 16 years and older are working, compared to 64% of Americans. This is believed to be due larger percentage of African immigrants have higher educational qualifications than Americans, which results in higher per capita incomes for African immigrants and Americans born to African immigrants.

Outside of educational success, specific groups have found economic success and have made many contributions to American society. For example, recent statistics indicate that Ugandan Americans have become one of the country&#x27;s biggest contributors to the economy, their contribution, amounting to US$1 billion in annual remittances which are disproportionately large contributions despite a community and population of less than 13,000. African immigrants like many other immigrant groups are likely to establish and find success in small businesses. Many Africans that have seen the social and economic stability that comes from ethnic enclaves such as Chinatowns have recently been establishing ethnic enclaves of their own at much higher rates to reap the benefits of such communities. Examples of such ethnic enclaves include Little Ethiopia in Los Angeles and Le Petit Senegal in New York City.

Demographically, African Immigrants and Americans born of African immigrants tend to typically congregate in urban areas, moving to suburban areas over the next few generations as they try to acquire economic and social stability. They are also one of America&#x27;s least likely groups to live in racially segregated areas. African Immigrants and Americans born of African immigrants have been reported as having some of the lowest crime rates in the United States and being one of the unlikeliest groups to go into or commit crime. African immigrants have even been reported to have lowered crime rates in neighborhoods in which they have moved into.

Black immigrants from Black majority countries are, upon their arrival, revealed to be much healthier than Black people from countries that are not majority Black and where they constitute a minority. Thus, African immigrants are, after arriving, often much healthier than American-born Black people and Black immigrants from Europe, though there is some evidence that as they settle, their health declines to the levels of their native counterparts, suggesting racial discrimination may be a factor in poor health for these communities.

====Cultural factors====
Cultural factors have been proposed as an explanation for the success of African immigrants. For example, it is claimed they often integrate into American society more successfully and at higher rates than other immigrants groups due to social factors. One being that many African immigrants have strong English skills even before entering the U.S., many African nations, particularly former Commonwealth nations, use English as a lingua franca. Because of this, many African immigrants to the U.S. are bilingual. Overall, 70% of Black African immigrants either speak English as their primary language or speak another language but are also fluent in English. Compare this to 48% &quot;proficiency&quot; in English for other immigrant groups.

Kefa M. Otiso has proposed another reason for the success of African immigrants, saying that they have a &quot;high work ethic, focus and a drive to succeed that is honed and crafted by the fact that there are limited socioeconomic opportunities in their native African countries,&quot; says Otiso.

====Selective immigration====
Another possible cause of the higher performance of African immigrants as a group is that they represent a small population in America so those who are chosen to come here often come from a selective group of African people. The relative difficulty of emigrating and immigrating into the United States has created a selective nature of the process with the U.S. often choosing the wealthier and more educated out of those with less resources, motivation or ability to immigrate.

====Americans born to African immigrants====

This pushing of second generation African immigrants by their parents has proven to be the key factor in their success, and a combination of family support and the emphasis of family unit has given these citizens social and psychological stability which makes them strive even further for success in many aspects of their daily life and society.

Many of these American groups have thus transplanted high cultural emphasis on education and work ethic into their cultures which can be seen in the cultures of Algerian Americans, Kenyan Americans, Sierra Leonean Americans, Ghanaian Americans, Malawian Americans, Congolese Americans, Tanzanian Americans, and especially Nigerian Americans and Egyptian Americans. Though this fails to explain why poverty, corruption, violence, ethnic conflict, and generally poor socioeconomic conditions continue to plague African nations such as Nigeria.

=== Caribbean Americans ===
In 2017, there were approximately 4.4 million Caribbean immigrants in the US. Overall, there are over 8 million people of Caribbean heritage. Cubans, Dominicans, Jamaicans, Haitians, Trinidadians and Tobagonians are the largest groups. Caribbeans are likely to be employed at the same rate as the general immigrant population and at a higher rate than native born Americans. According to a report in the &quot;International Business Times&quot;, Caribbean immigrants perform better than the general immigrant population in terms of high school graduation rates and some socio-economic indicators. In comparison to other immigrant groups, Caribbeans are far more likely to be naturalised American citizens, display a better standard of English and have higher rates of health insurance cover. Studies by Harvard sociologist Robert Sampson suggest Caribbean immigrants are associated with low crime rates. According to a report drawn from Immigration Studies (CIS), various Caribbean communities are among the top immigrant homeowners in America. The non-Hispanic Caribbean community tend to earn more than the American average. In 2018, their median household income was $57, 339 compared to the American average of $54, 689. In 2019, the figure was $60, 997 compared to the American average of $57, 761 (US Census Bureau 2018 and 2019). Caribbeans make up the majority of America&#x27;s Black immigrant population (46%). Black immigrants significantly contribute to the U.S. economy, with a spending power of $98 billion in 2018. Black immigrants earned approximately $133.6 billion and paid $36 billion in US taxes. These successes are primarily why some Caribbean Americans have been described as a model minority.

===Cuban success story===

The Cuban success story is a popular myth that Cuban Americans are all political exiles who have become wealthy in the United States. This story is often used to prove the accessibility of the American dream.

== Commonwealth countries ==

=== Africans ===
African immigrants have experienced success in numerous countries especially Commonwealth countries such as Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, which have attracted many educated and highly skilled African immigrants with enough resources for them to start a new life in these countries.

In the United Kingdom, one report has revealed that African immigrants have high rates of employment and that African immigrants are doing better economically than some other immigrant groups. Africans have obtained much success as entrepreneurs, many owning and starting many successful businesses across the country. Of the African immigrants, certain groups have become and are highly integrated into the country especially groups which have strong English language skills such as Zimbabweans or Nigerians, and they often come from highly educated and highly qualified backgrounds. Many African immigrants have low levels of unemployment, and some groups are known for their high rates of self-employment, as can be seen in the case of Nigerian immigrants. Certain groups outside of having strong English skills have found success mostly because many who immigrated to the UK are already highly educated and highly skilled professionals who come with jobs and positions such as business people, academics, traders, doctors and lawyers as is the case with Sudanese immigrants.

As of 2013, Nigerian immigrants were among the nine immigrant populations that were above average academically in the UK. Euromonitor International for the British Council suggests that the high academic achievement by Nigerian students is mainly from most of the pupils already having learned English in their home country. Additionally, many of them hail from the wealthier segments of Nigerian society, which can afford to pursue studies abroad. A notable example of the highly educated nature of British Nigerians is the case of Paula and Peter Imafidon, nine-year-old twins who are the youngest students ever to be admitted to high school in England. Nicknamed the &#x27;Wonder Twins&#x27;, the twins and other members of their family have accomplished incredible rare feats, passing advanced examinations and being accepted into institutions with students twice their age.

=== Asians ===
In Canada, Asian Canadians are viewed as a model minority, which whether seen as a &#x27;positive&#x27; or &#x27;negative&#x27; supports the stereotype of Asian Canadians as solely driven by professional and economic success, dehumanizing them in comparison to other groups. The majority of this is aimed toward the East Asian and South Asian communities.

In New Zealand, Asian New Zealanders are viewed as a model minority due to attaining above average socioeconomic indicators than the New Zealand average, though the phenomenon remains small, underground, and not as widespread compared with their American counterparts. In a study of a popular New Zealand newspaper, articles &quot;never portrayed the Chinese as a model minority that silently achieves&quot; and this was &quot;not in line with overseas research, suggesting that this stereotype merits further analysis&quot;.

== Egypt ==
=== Egyptian Copts ===
In Egypt, Copts have relatively higher educational attainment, relatively higher wealth index, and a stronger representation in white collar job types, but limited representation in security agencies. The majority of demographic, socioeconomic and health indicators are similar among Copts and Muslims. Historically; many Copts were accountants, and in 1961 Coptic Christians owned 51% of the Egyptian banks. A Pew Center study about religion and education around the world in 2016, found that around 36% of Egyptian Christians obtain a university degree in institutions of higher education.

According to the scholar Andrea Rugh Copts tend to belong to the educated middle and upper-middle class, and according to scholar Lois Farag &quot;The Copts still played the major role in managing Egypt&#x27;s state finances. They held 20% of total state capital, 45% of government employment, and 45% of government salarie&quot;. According to scholar J. D. Pennington 45% of the medical doctors, 60% of the pharmacists of Egypt were Christians.

A number of Coptic business and land-owning families became very wealthy and influential such as the Egyptian Coptic Christian Sawiris family that owns the Orascom conglomerate, spanning telecommunications, construction, tourism, industries and technology. In 2008, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated the family&#x27;s net worth at $36 billion. According to scholars Maristella Botticini and Zvi Eckstein argue that Copts have relatively higher educational attainment and relatively higher wealth index, due to Coptic Christianity emphasis on literacy and that Coptic Christianity encouraged the accumulation of human capital.

==France==
===French Vietnamese===
The Vietnamese in France are the most well-established overseas Vietnamese community outside eastern Asia, as well as Asian ethnic group in France, with roughly 139,000 Vietnamese immigrants living in France. While the level of integration among immigrants and their place in French society have become prominent issues in France in the past decade, French media and politicians generally view the Vietnamese community as a model minority. This is in part because they are represented as having a high degree of integration within French society, in addition to their economic and academic success. A survey in 1988 asking French citizens which immigrant ethnic group they believe to be the most integrated in French society saw the Vietnamese ranked fourth, behind only the Italian, Spanish and Portuguese communities.

The educational attainment rate of the Vietnamese population in France is the highest among overseas Vietnamese populations, a legacy that dates back to the colonial era of Vietnam, when privileged families and those with connections to the colonial government often sent their children to France to study. In addition to high achievement in education, the Vietnamese population in France is also largely successful economically. When the first major wave of Vietnamese migrants arrived in France during World War I, a number of migrants already held professional occupations in their new country shortly after their arrival. More recently, refugees who arrived in France after the Fall of Saigon are often more financially stable than their counterparts who settled in North America, Australia and the rest of Europe, due to better linguistic and cultural knowledge of the host country, which allowed them to enter the education system and/or higher paying professions with little trouble. Within a single generation, the median income for French-born Vietnamese has risen above the French median income.

===French Laotians===
Similarly to the Vietnamese, the Laotian community in France is one of the most well-integrated into the country and is the most established overseas Laotian populace. Unlike their counterparts in North America and Australia, Laotians in France have a high rate of educational success and are well-represented in the academic and professional sectors, especially among the generations of French-born Lao. Due to better linguistic and cultural knowledge of the host country, Laotian immigrants to France, who largely came as refugees after the end of the Laotian Civil War, were able to assimilate at a high rate.

===Criticism===
According to the French antiracist activist Grace Ly, the model minority myth is associated with the South-East Asian community in France.
Ly denounces the positive stereotypes associated with the Asian community in France in her book &quot;Model Young Girl&quot; (&quot;Jeune fille modèle&quot;). Notably in France, however, the persistent official policy of &quot;color blindness&quot; makes the concept of minorities, and policies to counter racism, different in modern French culture from America and the UK. This however, is and should be considered as distinct from actual expressions of prejudice in France, regardless of official policy.

==Germany==

In Germany the academic success of people of Vietnamese origin has been called &quot;Das vietnamesische Wunder&quot;(&quot;The Vietnamese Miracle&quot;). A study revealed that in the Berlin districts of Lichtenberg and Marzahn, both in former East Berlin and possessing a relatively small percentage of immigrants, Vietnamese account for only 2% of the general population, but make up 17% of the prep school population. Another note of Vietnamese Germans&#x27; academic success is that even though they can grow up in poverty in places like East Germany, they usually outperform their peers by a wide margin.

Another group in Germany that is extremely academically successful and is comparable to that of a model minority are Korean Germans, 70% of whom attended a Gymnasium (which is comparable to a prep school in American society), compared to Vietnamese Germans with only 50% attending a Gymnasium. Also, over 70% of second-generation Korean Germans hold at least an &quot;Abitur&quot; or higher educational qualification, more than twice the ratio of the rest of Germany.

== Israel ==
In Israel, Christian Arabs are one of the most educated groups. Maariv has described the Christian Arab sectors as &quot;the most successful in education system,&quot; since Christian Arabs fared the best in terms of education in comparison to any other group receiving an education in Israel and they have attained a bachelor&#x27;s degree and academic degree more than the median Israeli population.

=== Education ===

According to the study &quot;Are Christian Arabs the New Israeli Jews? Reflections on the Educational Level of Arab Christians in Israel&quot; by Hanna David from the University of Tel Aviv, one of the factors why Israeli Arab Christians are the most educated segment of Israel&#x27;s population is the high level of the Christian educational institutions. Christian schools in Israel are among the best schools in the country, and while those schools represent only 4% of the Arab schooling sector, about 34% of Arab university students come from Christian schools, and about 87% of the Israeli Arabs in the high tech sector have been educated in Christian schools. A 2011 Maariv article described the Christian Arab sector as &quot;the most successful in the education system,&quot; an opinion supported by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics and others who point out that Christian Arabs fared best in terms of education in comparison to any other group receiving an education in Israel.

===High school and matriculation exams===
The Israel Central Bureau of Statistics noted that when taking into account the data recorded over the years, Christian Arabs fared the best in terms of education in comparison to any other group receiving an education in Israel. In 2016 Christian Arabs had the highest rates of success at matriculation examinations, namely 73.9%, both in comparison to Muslim and Druze Israelis (41% and 51.9% respectively), and to the students from the different branches of the Hebrew (majority Jewish) education system considered as one group (55.1%).

===Higher education===
Arab Christians are one of the most educated groups in Israel. Statistically, Arab Christians in Israel have the highest rates of educational attainment among all religious communities, according to a data by Israel Central Bureau of Statistics in 2010, 63% of Israeli Arab Christians have had college or postgraduate education, the highest of any religious and ethno-religious group. Despite the fact that Arab Christians only represent 2.1% of the total Israeli population, in 2014 they accounted for 17.0% of the country&#x27;s university students, and for 14.4% of its college students. There are more Christians who have attained a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher academic degrees than the median Israeli population.

The rate of students studying in the field of medicine was higher among Arab Christian students than that of all other sectors. and the percentage of Arab Christian women who are receiving higher education is also higher than that of other groups.

In 2013, Arab Christian students were also the vanguard in terms of eligibility for higher education, as the Christian Arab students had the highest rates of receiving Psychometric Entrance Test scores which eligible them to be accepted into universities, data from the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics show that 61% of Christian Arabs were eligible for university studies, compared to 50% of Jewish, 45% of Druze, and 35% of Muslim students.

=== Socio-economic ===
In terms of their socio-economic situation, Arab Christians are more similar to the Jewish population than to the Muslim Arab population. They have the lowest incidence of poverty and the lowest percentage of unemployment which is 4.9% compared to 6.5% among Jewish men and women. They have also the highest median household income among Arab citizens of Israel and second highest median household income among the Israeli ethno-religious groups. Also Arab Christians have a high presentation in science and in the white-collar professions. In Israel Arab Christians are portrayed as a hard working and upper middle class educated ethno-religious minority.

==Mexico==
Due to their business success and cultural assimilation, German Mexicans and Lebanese Mexicans are seen as model minorities in Mexico. More recently, Haitians in Tijuana have been seen favorably by Tijuanenses as model immigrants due to their work ethic and integration into Tijuana society, and have been contrasted with Central American migrants.

In the 19th and early 20th century, German immigration was encouraged due to the perceived industriousness of Germans. German Mexicans were instrumental in the development of the cheese and brewing industries in Mexico. Germans in the Soconusco were successful in the coffee industry.

Although Lebanese Mexicans made up less than 5% of the total immigrant population in Mexico during the 1930s, they constituted half of the immigrant economic activity. Carlos Slim, one of the richest individuals in the world, is the topmost example of Lebanese Mexican success.

==Netherlands==
===Background===

At the end of the colonial era of the Dutch East Indies (now: Indonesia), a community of about 300,000 Indo-Europeans (people of mixed Indonesian and European heritage) was registered as Dutch citizens. Indos formed the vast majority of the European legal class in the colony. When in the second half of the 20th century the independent Republic of Indonesia was established, the majority of Europeans, including the Indo-Europeans, were expelled from the newly established country.

===Repatriation===
From 1945 to 1949 the Indonesian National Revolution turned the former Dutch East Indies into an increasingly hostile environment for Indo-Europeans. Violence aimed towards Indo-Europeans during its early Bersiap period (1945–1946) accumulated in almost 20,000 deaths. The Indo diaspora continued up to 1964 and resulted in the emigration of practically all Indo-Europeans from a turbulent young Indonesian nation. Even though most Indos had never set foot in the Netherlands before, this emigration was named &quot;repatriation&quot;.

Notwithstanding the fact that Indos in the former colony of the Dutch East Indies were officially part of the European legal class and were formally considered to be Dutch nationals, the Dutch government practiced an official policy of discouragement with regard to the post-WWII repatriation of Indos to the Netherlands. While Dutch policy was in fact aimed at stimulating Indos to give up Dutch citizenship and opt for Indonesian citizenship, simultaneously the young Indonesian Republic implemented policies increasingly intolerant towards anything remotely reminiscent of Dutch influence. Even though actual aggression against Indos decreased after the extreme violence of the Bersiap period, all Dutch (language) institutions, schools and businesses were gradually eliminated and public discrimination and racism against Indos in the Indonesian job market continued. In the end 98% of the original Indo community repatriated to their distant fatherland in Europe.

===Integration===
In the 1990s and early 21st century the Netherlands was confronted with ethnic tension in a now multi-cultural society. Ethnic tensions, rooted in the perceived lack of social integration and rise of crime rates of several ethnic minorities, climaxed with the murders of politician Pim Fortuyn in 2002 and film director Theo van Gogh in 2004. In 2006 statistics show that in Rotterdam, the second largest city in the country, close to 50% of the inhabitants were of foreign descent. The Indo community however is considered the best integrated ethnic and cultural minority in the Netherlands. Statistical data compiled by the CBS shows that Indos belong to the group with the lowest crime rates in the country.

A CBS study of 1999 reveals that of all foreign born groups living in the Netherlands, only the Indos have an average income similar to that of citizens born in the Netherlands. Job participation in government, education and health care is similar as well. Another recent CBS study, among foreign born citizens and their children living in the Netherlands in 2005, shows that on average, Indos own the largest number of independent enterprises. A 2007 CBS study shows that already over 50% of first-generation Indos have married a native born Dutch person. A percentage that increased to 80% for the second generation. One of the first and oldest Indo organisations that supported the integration of Indo repatriates into the Netherlands is the &quot;Pelita foundation&quot;.

Although Indo repatriates, being born overseas, are officially registered as Dutch citizens of foreign descent, their Eurasian background puts them in the Western sub-class instead of the Non-Western (Asian) sub-class.

Two factors are usually attributed to the essence of their apparently seamless assimilation into Dutch society: Dutch citizenship and the amount of &#x27;Dutch cultural capital&#x27;, in the form of school attainments and familiarity with the Dutch language and culture, that Indos already possessed before migrating to the Netherlands.

===New generations===
Although third- and fourth-generation Indos are part of a fairly large minority community in the Netherlands, the path of assimilation ventured by their parents and grandparents has left them with little knowledge of their actual roots and history, even to the point that they find it hard to recognise their own cultural features. Some Indos find it hard to grasp the concept of their Eurasian identity and either tend to disregard their Indonesian roots or on the contrary attempt to profile themselves as Indonesian. In recent years however the reinvigorated search for roots and identity has also produced several academic studies.

<doc id="735855" wikidata="Q2838061" url="?curid=735855" title="Democratic Left Alliance – Labour Union">
<text>Democratic Left Alliance-Labour Union (Polish: Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej-Unia Pracy, SLD-UP) was an electoral committee and a coalition of two Polish centre-left political parties: Democratic Left Alliance and Labour Union. At the national level, the alliance arose at the time of the 2001 parliamentary elections and continued through the 2004 elections to the European Parliament. The alliance came together again for the 2009 and 2014 European parliamentary elections.

The SLD-UP won a stunning victory at the 2001 parliamentary elections, gaining 41% of the vote, and formed the government with the Polish People&#x27;s Party. During the 2001–2005 term, there occurred a splintering of the alliance and there came into being four left-wing political caucuses in the Polish parliament:

* Democratic Left Alliance (SLD)
* Labour Union (UP)
* Social Democracy of Poland (SDPL)
* People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PLD)

The SLD-UP maintained their alliance for the European parliamentary elections of 2004, and won five seats with 9.3% of the vote, a sharp decline from the national elections in 2001.

In the 2005 parliamentary elections, SDPL, Labour Union and Greens 2004 formed a joint electoral committee, under the leadership of the SDPL, and most of the PLD members joined Self-Defense of the Republic of Poland.

Following the relatively poor performance of the SDPL-UP-Greens at the 2005 parliamentary elections (they polled 3.9% and failed to break the 5% parliamentary threshold), and the overwhelming success of right-wing parties, the SDPL and UP sought to reapproach the SLD, and seek a new understanding. A new alliance was born in 2006-07, the Left and Democrats, which consisted of the three left-wing parties, SLD, SDPL and UP as well as the centrist Democratic Party (PD). Left and Democrats contested the 2007 parliamentary elections and polled 13.2% of the vote. SLD, SDPL and PD saw several of their representatives elected to the Sejm, but the UP failed to elect any members. In 2008, following a rift between the constituent parties of the Left and Democrats, the alliance came to an end with PD and SDPL leaving the alliance in April. These two went on to form the Agreement for the Future, together with the Greens 2004, for the 2009 European elections. The Labour Union, however, chose to maintain its alliance with SLD, and at the elections SLD-UP polled 12.3%, electing seven representatives to the European Parliament.

The SLD-UP coalition was reactivated for the 2014 European Parliament elections. It received 9.4% of the votes and won five seats.

SLD and UP also participated together in a broader left-wing coalition SLD Left Together that contested the 2014 and 2018 local elections.

<doc id="735858" wikidata="Q733724" url="?curid=735858" title="Bob Miller (Nevada politician)">
<text>Robert Joseph Miller (born March 30, 1945) is an American former attorney and politician who served as the 26th governor of Nevada from 1989 to 1999. A member of the Democratic Party, he is Nevada&#x27;s longest-serving governor. As of 2023, he is the most recent Nevada governor to have a lieutenant governor from the opposing party, having served with Republicans Sue Wagner and Lonnie Hammargren. Before ascending to the governorship, Miller was the 29th lieutenant governor of Nevada from 1987 to 1989.

==Early life and politics==
Miller was born in Chicago, Illinois, and moved with his family to Las Vegas, Nevada as a child. His father, Ross Miller, was a bookmaker, who, according to his son&#x27;s 2013 autobiography, &quot;Son of a Gambling Man&quot;, had operated on both sides of the law on some of the meaner streets of industrial Chicago.

Bob Miller attended Roman Catholic schools. He graduated from Bishop Gorman High School in 1963 with honors, and from Santa Clara University in 1967, earning a degree in political science. He received his J.D. degree from Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, California.

Miller served in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1967 to 1973, and later in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. He served as Clark County Deputy District Attorney from 1971 to 1973. In 1978, Miller was elected Clark County District Attorney, and in 1982 became the first holder of that office to win re-election. He was president of the National District Attorneys Association in 1984. Miller was elected the 29th Lieutenant Governor of Nevada in 1986 and was sworn in for a four-year term on January 5, 1987. 

==Governor of Nevada (1989–1999)==
On January 3, 1989, incumbent governor Richard Bryan resigned to take a seat in the U.S. Senate. Miller, as lieutenant governor, subsequently became governor under the Nevada succession law. After becoming governor, Miller addressed his staff, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m looking forward for us to spend several years together. How many together depends on how well we do&quot;.

Miller ran in the 1990 Nevada gubernatorial election to keep his job. He easily won the Democratic nomination and defeated Republican Jim Gallaway in a landslide. He was reelected in the 1994 Nevada gubernatorial election, defeating Republican air force officer member (and future governor) Jim Gibbons. Miller chaired the National Governors Association from 1996 until 1997. His decade in office made him Nevada&#x27;s longest-serving governor. Lifetime term limits prevented him from seeking re-election in the 1998 Nevada gubernatorial election. He was succeeded for governor by Republican Kenny Guinn. 

After Miller&#x27;s departure from office in January 1999, no Nevada Democrats were elected governor until Steve Sisolak in the 2018 Nevada gubernatorial election. Miller has a middle school in Henderson, Nevada named after him, which opened in 1999.

== After politics (1999–present) ==
Miller presently serves on the board of directors of Wynn Resorts and International Game Technology. He is the Principal of Robert J. Miller Consulting, which provides business-to-government and business-to-business advice and assistance. He is also a senior advisor with Dutko Worldwide, a bipartisan government relations company headquartered in Washington, D.C.

==Family==

Miller and his wife, Sandy, have three children, including Ross Miller, who served as Secretary of State of Nevada from 2007 to 2015. He and his wife currently live in Henderson, Nevada.

<doc id="735861" wikidata="Q970573" url="?curid=735861" title="Allahu Akbar (anthem)">
<text>&quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; () is an Egyptian pro-military patriotic song composed by songwriter Abdalla Shams El-Din in 1954 and written by poet Mahmoud El-Sherif in 1955. It was first used by the Egyptian Armed Forces as a marching song during the Suez Crisis in 1956. The song was also used as the national anthem of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi from 1969 to 2011.

==History==
===Egyptian origins===
&quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; was originally an Egyptian military marching song which became popular in Egypt and Syria during the Suez Crisis. The lyrics were written by Mahmoud El-Sherif, and the music was composed by Abdalla Shams El-Din. The song continues to be popular among the Arab world.

===Use in Libya===
&quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; was adopted as the official national anthem of the Libyan Arab Republic on 1 September 1969, by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, showing his hopes of uniting the Arab world. &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; replaced the previous national anthem &quot;Libya, Libya, Libya&quot;, which had been used by the Kingdom of Libya since its independence in 1951.

When the Libyan Arab Republic became the Socialist People&#x27;s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya on 2 March 1977, &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; remained the national anthem of Libya. However, when Libya and Egypt broke off diplomatic relations following the latter&#x27;s 1979 peace treaty with Israel, the Egyptian origins of the national anthem were no longer mentioned by official government sources.

In 2011, the National Transitional Council again adopted &quot;Libya, Libya, Libya&quot; as the national anthem of Libya, following the civil war and killing of Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi loyalists continued to use the anthem.

<text>Gimme a Break! is an American television sitcom created by Mort Lachman and Sy Rosen that aired on NBC for six seasons from October 29, 1981, to May 12, 1987. The series starred Nell Carter as the housekeeper for a widowed police chief (Dolph Sweet) and his three daughters.

==Premise==
In Glenlawn, a fictional suburb in California, Nellie Ruth &quot;Nell&quot; Harper (Nell Carter) agrees to look after the Kanisky household as a special favor to her dying friend Margaret Huffman Kanisky (played in flashback by Sharon Spelman), the wife of police chief Carl Kanisky (Dolph Sweet). More than a mere housekeeper and cook, Nell serves as a parental figure to the chief&#x27;s three teenaged daughters, Katie (Kari Michaelsen), Julie (Lauri Hendler), and Samantha (Lara Jill Miller). A foster son, Joey (Joey Lawrence), joins the Kanisky household in season three.

Five episodes into the sixth and final season, the show changed locales from Glenlawn to New York City, when Nell, concerned for Joey&#x27;s welfare after he moved there with his absentee father, traveled there to check on him. She subsequently assumed guardianship of Joey and his younger brother Matthew (played by Joey Lawrence&#x27;s real-life brother Matthew Lawrence) at their father&#x27;s request, and was forced to permanently relocate there after Chief Kanisky&#x27;s father Stanley (John Hoyt) sold the family&#x27;s Glenlawn home.

Over the six-year run, celebrities often appeared on the show, including singers Whitney Houston, Andy Gibb, Sammy Davis Jr., Ray Parker Jr., and The Pointer Sisters. More often than not, the guest singers would perform a song with Nell on the episodes. During the third season, Pat Sajak guest-starred as himself when Nell and her friend Addy (Telma Hopkins) were contestants on &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. Other notable guest stars included Milton Berle, Danny Glover, Rue McClanahan, Tony Randall, Helen Hunt, Don Rickles, Gwen Verdon, Dennis Haysbert, Ernie Hudson, Gary Collins, and Elizabeth Berkley.

The episode &quot;Cat Story&quot; was performed and broadcast live on February 23, 1985, as a promotional gimmick, which the cast performed without major incident. An earlier episode (from the 1984–85 season), &quot;Baby of the Family&quot;, ranked number 38 on TV Land&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Most Unexpected TV Moments&quot;; it depicted Joey dressing and performing in blackface at Nell&#x27;s church benefit, a plan hatched by Samantha to retaliate for Nell forbidding her to go on an unchaperoned camping trip.

==Cast==

===Main characters===
*Nell Carter as Nellie Ruth &quot;Nell&quot; Harper was a talented singer from Tuscaloosa County, Alabama, who ran away from home when she was 18. She met and became friends with Margaret Kanisky and promised to look after her family after she had died from cancer. In keeping her promise, Nell took on the role of housekeeper and mother to the kids and remained in the series for the entire 6-year run. She later became a foster mother to Joey Donovan in season three. Nell moved to Greenwich Village in New York City in season six with Joey and Addy, and worked as an assistant editor for a publishing company.
*Dolph Sweet as Police Chief Carl &quot;Chief&quot; Kanisky (seasons 1–4), known simply as &quot;the Chief&quot;, was a widower with three teenaged daughters. After Dolph Sweet&#x27;s death on May 8, 1985, his character was written out of the series as also having died, and the show continued with Nell taking over as head of the household.
*Kari Michaelsen as Kathleen &quot;Katie&quot; Kanisky (seasons 1–5) is the Chief&#x27;s eldest daughter. She decided not to go to college and opened a boutique called Katie&#x27;s Corner. After her boutique went out of business, she was written out of the series in the final season as having obtained a job in San Francisco. Her last appearance was the first episode of season six, in which she was now brunette. 
*Lauri Hendler as Julie Kanisky Maxwell (seasons 1–5) is the Chief&#x27;s middle daughter, portrayed as being very intelligent. She married Jonathan Maxwell at the end of season four and became pregnant in season five. In the season-six premiere, after Nell Maxwell had been born, the new three-member Maxwell family moved to San Jose and was therefore written out of the series.
*Lara Jill Miller as Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Kanisky (seasons 1–5, recurring in season 6) is the Chief&#x27;s youngest daughter, portrayed as a typical tomboy in her preteen years, but developed into a boy-crazy teenager. She moved to Warren County, New Jersey, to go to Littlefield College, and had a recurring role in season six.
*John Hoyt as Stanley &quot;Grandpa&quot; Kanisky (seasons 2–6, previously recurring) is the Chief&#x27;s grumpy, but lovable Polish immigrant father. He moves in with his son and granddaughters following his wife&#x27;s death in season three. In season six, he moves to New York City, into the same building as Nell, after selling the Kanisky house.
*Joey Lawrence as Joey Donovan (seasons 3–6) eventually becomes Nell&#x27;s foster son; he starts out working as a con artist to raise money to join his uncle in Chicago. Later, Joey becomes a key cast member. His father Tim Donovan appeared on the show in New Orleans and in New York City. Joey meets his younger brother and moves in with Tim at the beginning of season 6, but is reunited with Nell soon afterwards and moves in with her and Addy in New York City. 
*Howard Morton as Officer Ralph Waldo Simpson (seasons 3–5, previously recurring) is a not very bright, but lovable police officer who was a subordinate of the Chief&#x27;s.
*Telma Hopkins as Dr. Adelaide &quot;Addy&quot; Wilson (seasons 4–6, previously recurring) is Nell&#x27;s childhood friend, holder of a Ph.D., and a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Addy was chief educational curriculum supervisor for postgraduate students studying for doctorates in history, English, and economic geography in the California university system. She later moved to New York City, where Nell eventually joined her. Although Nell and Addy were friends, they also constantly clashed.
*Jonathan Silverman as Jonathan Maxwell (season 5, previously recurring) is Julie&#x27;s boyfriend and later husband, pizzaman, and archeology student. Jonathan went to Mexico on a three-month dig. Jonathan, Julie, and their new baby left for San Jose after season five.
*Rosetta LeNoire as &quot;Mama&quot; Maybelle Harper (season 6, previously recurring) is Nell&#x27;s stern, bitter, and critical mother, who was introduced in season four (&quot;Alabamy Bound: Part 1&quot;). Previously, in season one&#x27;s &quot;Nell Goes Home&quot; and season three&#x27;s &quot;A Kanisky Christmas&quot;, the character&#x27;s name was Emma, was played by Hilda Haynes, and was soft-spoken. 
*Matthew Lawrence as Matthew Donovan (season 6) is Joey&#x27;s younger brother, who also lived with Nell and Addy in New York City.
*Rosie O&#x27;Donnell as Maggie O&#x27;Brien (season 6) is Nell&#x27;s not-so-bright dental hygienist neighbor in New York City.
*Paul Sand as Marty (season 6) is the landlord of the building where Nell, Addy, Joey, and Matthew lived. He also owned the adjacent restaurant La Gazpacho, where he went by &quot;Esteban&quot;.

===Recurring characters===

*Alvernette Jimenez as Angie McDaniel is Nell&#x27;s tall, skinny, and dim-witted friend, the typical airhead with a little girl&#x27;s voice. The character was eventually written out of the show, but appeared in several episodes between seasons one and four.
*Jane Dulo as Mildred Kanisky (née Wuchetzky) is Stanley Kanisky&#x27;s wife and Carl&#x27;s mother; she was also played by Elvia Allman in &quot;Katie the Cheat&quot; and Elizabeth Kerr in &quot;Grandma Fools Around&quot;. Dulo played the role in season two. The character died, leaving Stanley a widower in season three.
*Pete Schrum as Ed Kanisky is Carl&#x27;s brother, an overweight mortician who loves to play practical jokes. Ed was a recurring character in seasons one and two, then got married and was written out of the series.
*Patrick Collins as Tim Donovan is Joey and Matthew&#x27;s father, a merchant seaman. Joey reunited with Tim in New Orleans in season four (when Tim was played by Fred McCarren). Joey went to live with Tim and Matthew in the beginning of season six, when Tim decided to get a job in New York City. After realizing he could not handle a 9-to-5 job, Tim decided he wanted to go back to sea and Joey returned to Nell and Addy along with Matthew.
*Jack Fletcher as Erwin J. Swackhammer was a man who would annoy the Kanisky household in various ways, the most notable of which occurred when he was the manager of the telephone company and had Nell arrested and jailed. After five episodes, Swackhammer disappeared with no explanation.
*Harrison Page as Hamilton Storm is a news reporter who appeared occasionally during seasons one and two; he appeared more concerned with his appearance than giving the news.

==Broadcast history==
==Episodes==
==Production==
The show was produced by Alan Landsburg Productions (renamed as Reeves Entertainment Group in 1985). The US syndication rights are held by NBCUniversal Television Distribution, the successor company to original syndicator MCA TV. FremantleMedia owns the international rights, as they own Thames Television, which acquired Reeves Entertainment Group in 1990. The creators of the show were Mort Lachman and Sy Rosen. The series was taped at Metromedia Square in Hollywood before a studio audience.

Over its run, the series used two different theme songs. The first was composed by Bob Christianson with lyrics by Bob Garrett and Marley Sims; two versions of this song were used, one for the first season and a new recording for the second. A new theme, with music by Jay Graydon and lyrics by Richard Page, was introduced in the third season and used for the remainder of the show&#x27;s run. The new theme has similarities to the first but with a more positive attitude. Carter performed both themes.

Carter distanced herself from the show following its run. “I don&#x27;t want to go to my grave being known as the girl from &#x27;Gimme a Break,’” she told The New York Times in 1988. “That wasn&#x27;t me; it was just a job.”

==Reception==
The show received mixed reviews from critics when it premiered. Writing for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Tom Shales wrote an especially scathing review of the pilot episode. “I wish I could sue NBC for the grievous consternation, intestinal distress and aggravated low moaning I have suffered as a result of ‘Gimme a Break,’” Shales wrote, going on to criticize the show’s sex jokes and what he found to be the racial stereotypes embodied by Carter’s character. “If I thought television could get substantially worse than this, I am not sure I would have the courage or desire ever to turn the set on again,” Shales concluded.

By contrast, the &quot;New York Times&quot; found the show promising, praising the performances of Carter and Sweet and the way the show balanced wisecracks with bits of seriousness. “The abrupt changes in tone are handled adroitly,” John J. O’Connor wrote. “Given some supportive scripts, Miss Carter and Mr. Sweet could insure a good run for this series.”

==Syndication==
The show has been in syndication since 1985. Reruns have also aired nationally on WWOR EMI Service and USA. U.S. distribution rights are owned by NBCUniversal Syndication Studios, successor in interest to previous syndicator MCA TV. Reruns of the series are a mainstay of many of Sinclair Broadcast Group&#x27;s The CW, MeTV and MyNetworkTV stations, especially in low-traffic time periods, due to the low-cost barter setup of the now defunct The Program Exchange.

Antenna TV aired the show from January 2, 2018, until December 31, 2021. Cozi TV started airing the show from January 3, 2022, to December 2023.

<text>A Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) is a large pressurized container that was used on Space Shuttle missions to transfer cargo to and from the International Space Station (ISS). Two MPLMs made a dozen trips in the Shuttle cargo bay and initially berthed to the &quot;Unity&quot; and later the &quot;Harmony&quot; module on the ISS. Once attached, supplies were offloaded, and finished experiments and waste were reloaded. The MPLM was then transferred back into the Shuttle’s cargo bay for return to Earth. Three modules were built by Alenia Aeronautica for the Italian Space Agency (ASI). They were named &quot;Leonardo&quot;, &quot;Raffaello&quot;, and &quot;Donatello&quot;.

The &quot;Leonardo&quot; module was modified in 2010 to turn it into the Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) and was permanently attached to the ISS during the STS-133 mission in March 2011. In July 2011, the &quot;Raffaello&quot; module was the primary payload on the final Space Shuttle mission. It returned with the Shuttle and was stored at the Kennedy Space Center. The &quot;Donatello&quot; module never launched. MPLMs were flown on 12 of the 37 Space Shuttle missions to the ISS.

The basic design of the MPLM was later used as the basis for two cargo spacecraft, the European Automated Transfer Vehicle and the American Cygnus. 

==History==
The modules were provided to NASA under contract by the Italian Space Agency (ASI). Three MPLMs were built and delivered to NASA and have names chosen by the ASI to denote some of the great talents in Italian history: Leonardo da Vinci, Raffaello and Donatello. Although built by ASI, the modules are owned by NASA. In exchange for building the MPLMs, ASI receives access to U.S. research time on the ISS.

The MPLMs have a heritage that goes back to Spacelab. In addition, ESA&#x27;s &quot;Columbus&quot; module, the &quot;Harmony&quot; and &quot;Tranquility&quot; ISS modules and the ATV and Cygnus resupply craft all trace their origins to the MPLMs. The MPLM concept was originally created for Space Station Freedom. Initially, they were to be built by Boeing, but in 1992, the Italians announced that they would build a &quot;Mini-Pressurized Logistics Module&quot;, able to carry of cargo. After the 1993 redesign of Freedom, the length was doubled and it was renamed the &quot;Multi-Purpose Logistics Module&quot;. Each empty MPLM is approximately long, in diameter, weighs , and can deliver up to nine metric tons of cargo to the ISS.

&quot;Donatello&quot; was a more capable module than its two siblings, as it was designed to carry payloads that required continuous power from construction through to installation on the ISS. However, &quot;Donatello&quot; was never used and some of its parts were cannibalized to convert &quot;Leonardo&quot; into the PMM.

With the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, the &quot;Raffaello&quot; and &quot;Leonardo&quot; modules were flown a combined total of 12 times.

==Design==
An MPLM is a large cylinder equipped with a common berthing mechanism at one end, and grapple fixtures to allow the Canadarm-2 to move it from the shuttle bay to a berthing port on the US Orbital Segment of the ISS.

===Power during launch===
In order to provide power to equipment and experiments inside the MPLM during launch, the MPLM could be connected to the Shuttle&#x27;s power supply by means of the Remotely Operated Electrical Umbilical (ROEU). The umbilical was mounted on the starboard side payload bay sidewall longeron, and was a folding arm umbilical that connected to the MPLM while it was in the payload bay. The arm was disconnected and retracted prior to the MPLM being removed for placement on the ISS and then reconnected once the MPLM was placed back inside the payload bay.

==Program logo==
Since the module names are also the names of three of the four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the NASA MPLM Group approached Mirage Studios artist A.C. Farley to design a logo featuring Raphael in an astronaut flight suit. There were cloisonné pins produced, as well as stickers and embroidered patches. Because the Ninja Turtles were created by Mirage Studios and owned by them at the time (now owned by Paramount Global, formerly ViacomCBS, via Nickelodeon), NASA gave Mirage the copyright to the logo in exchange for the use of the studio&#x27;s character on it.

==Missions==


== Specifications ==
The following are the specifications of the MPLM:
*Length – 6.6 m (cylindrical part 4.8 m)
*Width – 4.57 m
*Mass – 4,082 kg empty; 13,154 kg fully loaded
*Habitable volume – 31 m3
*Material – stainless steel

== Future use ==
The &quot;Donatello MPLM&quot; has been converted by Lockheed Martin into a Habitat Ground Test Article (HGTA) Lunar habitat prototype which is located at NASA KSC. &quot;Leonardo&quot; is permanently attached to the ISS as PMM and should reenter in the atmosphere with it. &quot;Raffaello&quot; is located at an Axiom Space facility near Houston, in preparation to undergo work to become an element for the Axiom Commercial Space Station.

<doc id="735874" wikidata="Q7552690" url="?curid=735874" title="Society of Writers to His Majesty's Signet">
<text>The Society of Writers to His Majesty&#x27;s Signet is a private society of Scottish solicitors, dating back to 1594 and part of the College of Justice. Writers to the Signet originally had special privileges in relation to the drawing up of documents required to be signeted, but these have since disappeared and the society is now an independent, non-regulatory association of solicitors. The society maintains the Category A listed Signet Library, part of the Parliament House complex in Edinburgh, and members of the society are entitled to the postnominal letters WS.

==History==
Solicitors in Scotland were previously known as &quot;writers&quot;; Writers to the Signet were the solicitors entitled to supervise use of the King&#x27;s Signet, the private seal of the early Kings of Scots. Records of that use date back to 1369. In 1532, the Writers to the Signet were included as members in the newly established College of Justice, along with the Faculty of Advocates and the clerks of the Court of Session. The society was established in 1594, when the King&#x27;s Secretary, as Keeper of the Signet, gave commissions to a Deputy Keeper and 18 other writers.

Writers to the Signet began as clerks to the Keeper of the Signet, and were afforded the privileges of freedom from taxation by the Burgh of Edinburgh, exemption from military duty, and rights of audience before the bar of the College of Justice. Writers were involved in drawing up summonses to the Court of Session. Writers were, however, &quot;de jure&quot; prohibited from acting as procurators but &quot;de facto&quot; this was often ignored.

In 1599 it was proposed that the Faculty of Advocates and the Society of Writers be merged into a single organisation, but the writers were against it. Such an idea was again proposed in 1633, but the Writers again opposed it.

In civil actions in the Court of Session a pursuer is required to have his writ stamped with the Signet to give him authority from the monarch to serve the writ on the defender. That conferral, called &quot;passing the Signet,&quot; was previously carried out by the Signet Office, the administration of which was one of the society&#x27;s responsibilities. In 1976 the Signet Office was merged into the General Department of the Court of Session and the society was relieved of any responsibility for it. Nevertheless, the requirement of &quot;passing the Signet&quot; survives.

==The Signet Library==

The Signet Library was designed by Robert Reid with interiors by William Stark. It was finished in 1822 in time for the visit to Edinburgh of George IV. William Henry Playfair and William Burn were also involved in working on the building. The building is a classical masterpiece and is a category A listed building.

==Today==
The society has become an independent professional body of solicitors. Its stated purpose is &quot;promoting the highest standards in legal services&quot; through the provision of education services including the Professional Competence Course (PCC) and courses in continuing professional development (CPD).

==Keeper of the Signet==

The Keeper of the Signet is one of the Great Officers of State of Scotland, and is one of the offices held by the Lord Clerk Register under the Public Offices (Scotland) Act 1817 (57 Geo. 3. c. 64), s 5. The current Keeper of the Signet is Lady Elish Angiolini, former Lord Advocate of Scotland.

The office is now a purely ceremonial one, as the Keeper of the Signet grants a commission to the Principal Clerk of Session to allow the Signet to be used. The Keeper of the Signet is the senior officer of the Society of Writers to the Signet and issues commissions to new members. Although the society is a private body, the Register of Commissions forms part of the records of the Court of Session, held by the National Archives of Scotland. The Keeper does not exercise administrative functions over the society, these being delegated to the Deputy Keeper. The present Deputy Keeper is Amanda Laurie WS.

==Associate membership==
Jurists, advocates and foreign lawyers may be granted associate membership of the society. Associate members are entitled to use the designation: &quot;Associate Writer to the Signet&quot; with the postnominal letters, AWS. Prominent associate members include Harvey McGregor KC and the late former President of Poland, Lech Kaczyński.

<doc id="735876" wikidata="Q1301261" url="?curid=735876" title="Tillamook Bay">
<text>Tillamook Bay is a small inlet of the Pacific Ocean, approximately 6 mi (10 km) long and 2 mi (3 km) wide, on the northwest coast of the U.S. state of Oregon. It is located just north of Cape Meares in western Tillamook County approximately 75 mi (120 km) west of Portland.

==Description and history==
The bay is protected from the open ocean by shoals and a 3 mi (5 km) sandbar called the Bayocean Peninsula. It is surrounded closely by the Coastal Range except at its southeast end, where the town of Tillamook sits near the mouths of the Kilchis, Wilson, Trask and Tillamook rivers, which flow quickly down from the surrounding timber-producing regions of the Coastal Range to converge at the bay. The short Miami River enters the north end of the bay. The small fishing village of Garibaldi sits near the cliffs opening of the bay in the ocean. The rivers that feed the bay are known for their prolific steelhead and salmon runs. The mixing of freshwater from the rivers with the ocean&#x27;s saltwater makes the bay an estuary.

The name &quot;Tillamook&quot; is Coast Salish word meaning &quot;Land of Many Waters&quot;, probably referring to the rivers that enter the bay. At the time of the arrival of Europeans, the area along the coast was inhabited by the Tillamook and other related Coast Salish tribes. Historians believe they entered the area around the year 1400 and Lewis and Clark estimated the population south of the Columbia River along the coast at approximately 2,200.

The first American at Tillamook Bay was Captain Robert Gray who in August, 1788 arrived and explored the surrounding area. He was the first known American to set foot on Oregon shore. Gray at first thought he had landed at the Columbia River, but after discovering his mistake and a hostile encounter with the local natives, where one of Gray&#x27;s crew and several natives were killed, he left the area after one week&#x27;s stay.

The bay was settled in 1848 by Elbridge Trask, who journeyed overland to the bay, and subsequent trials of early settlement were described in the 1960 historical novel &quot;Trask&quot; by Don Berry. The novel and two sequels are collectively known as the &quot;Trask novels&quot;.

In 1911 an Oregon Municipal corporation called the Port of Bayocean was formed by a special election to manage land at the entrance to the bay. During World War II, the United States Navy operated blimp patrol station near the bay at Naval Air Station Tillamook. The station was decommissioned in 1948. In 1953 the Port of Bayocean acquired the former station and began operating it as the Port of Tillamook Bay. A 5.5 mi (9 km) railroad spur, originally built by the Navy, connects the coastal communities along the bay to the Southern Pacific Railroad at Tillamook. In 2003, an employee of the Port of Tillamook Bay started a heritage railroad to display the coastal beauty. This railroad was named the Oregon Coast Scenic Railroad which operates passenger trains on the 13 miles between Garibaldi, OR and Wheeler, OR. In 2017, a touring company called Oregon Coast Railriders makes use of 6 miles of The Port of Tillamook Bay Rail Road (originally known as the Pacific Railway), where visitors peddle a multi-person cycle-transport that runs on the rails. The bay is within easy driving distance of Portland and is one of the most popular gateways to the Oregon Coast. Planning and slow and steady progress are underway with The Salmonberry Trail, which intends to eventually connect four coastal towns, with passage through the Coastal Mountain Range to Banks, OR; hiking, biking, and horseriding would be possible on this route. The town of Tillamook is the location of the famous Tillamook Cheese Factory.
The stone breakwater at the mouth of Tillamook Bay is only 400 meters wide.
During heavy weather the waves off the harbor entrance can be high, making entering the harbor dangerous. During the July 4th weekend of 1980 Richard Dixon, the United States Coast Guard coxswain of a 44-foot Motor Lifeboat, led two daring rescues off the Tillamook Bay breakwater, for which he was awarded two Coast Guard Medals.

<text>The Real Politics Union (, UPR) is a national conservative and economically liberal political party in Poland. In the past it was right-libertarian and classical liberal.

==Popular support and funding==
UPR was founded in 1987 as the classic liberal Real Politics Movement by Janusz Korwin-Mikke, who later became its long-term leader.

In the 1990s and 2000s, UPR consistently had the support of 1–2% of voters in general elections, too low to receive public funding under Polish electoral law. As a consequence, it has faced prolonged financial difficulties since its inception. In the 1991 legislative election, the party won 3 seats.

In the parliamentary election in 2001, the UPR candidates started from lists of Civic Platform to Sejm. To the Senate both parties joined centre-right coalition Senate 2001 with other post-Solidarity parties.

UPRs candidates commenced their political campaign from its short-lived satellite party &quot;Janusz Korwin-Mikke&#x27;s Platform&quot; (&quot;Platforma Janusza Korwin-Mikke&quot;). The PJKM also did not manage to cross the required 5% threshold in the 2005 parliamentary elections (it got only 1.57%).

In the parliamentary election in 2007, the UPR candidates campaigned in cooperation with the League of Polish Families but did not enter into a formal coalition. The list on which both the UPR and the League appeared saw the UPR get 1.5% votes. This was insufficient to get any of their candidates into the lower house (&quot;Sejm&quot;) and therefore the UPR remains unable to obtain public funding.

In October 2009, Janusz Korwin-Mikke left the party and its another former chairman, Stanisław Michalkiewicz, resigned from his honorary membership. In the following years, party became more nationalist.

In the 2011 elections, Stanisław Żółtek (along with pro Korwin-Mikke faction) took part in the foundation of Congress of the New Right, which was led by the former chairman of the UPR Janusz Korwin-Mikke.

In the 2012, UPR (along with the All-Polish Youth and National Radical Camp) formed far-right political alliance National Movement, which merged into the political party in the 2014.

UPR cooperated with National Movement in the European Parliament election in 2014, Polish local elections in 2014 and the presidential election in 2015. In the Polish parliamentary election in 2015, the whole National Movement stand for the Sejm from the lists of Kukiz&#x27;15.

At the end of 2015, UPR leader Bartosz Józwiak left National Movement which ended the partnership between these parties.

In the 2019 election, UPR left Kukiz&#x27;15, because it did not want to join the coalition with Polish People&#x27;s Party. It created its own parliamentary group which consisted of four members that existed till the end of the 8th Sejm. Some of UPR associated members were candidates of Law and Justice party in 2019 election.

On 21 February 2020, UPR joined European Christian Political Movement. In March, UPR declared willingness to cooperate with Agreement party. In the second round of 2020 presidential election, UPR supported Andrzej Duda,;the party did not support any of the candidates before the first round.

<doc id="735882" wikidata="Q6835179" url="?curid=735882" title="Michael Walker (jockey)">
<text>Michael Walker (born 1984) is a New Zealand-born former jockey of Māori ancestry who won the New Zealand premiership and also competed in Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore.

==Early life==
Michael Walker was born in Rotorua, New Zealand, in the central districts of the North Island, although his family later moved to Waitara. At the age of 11, Walker approached noted Thoroughbred trainer Allan Sharrock, asking for work with his horses. Sharrock gave him regular work after school before eventually indenturing him as an apprentice. He arranged a special dispensation for Walker to start riding in races at age 15 instead of the usual starting age of 16.

In his first year as an apprentice (the 1999–2000 racing year), Walker had an astonishing 131 wins to not only win the apprentices’ championship but the jockeys’ premiership as well (his first of three). While apprenticed to Sharrock, Walker won 653 races, most in New Zealand (a record 631 wins), but also in Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Japan, Singapore, and Macau.

==Senior jockey==
In April 2004, at age 20, he became a fully fledged jockey. Walker celebrated the next day by riding five winners at the Woodville-Pahiatua Racing Club&#x27;s meeting in southern Hawke&#x27;s Bay. Despite not riding in New Zealand for three-quarters of the season, Walker finished with 107 wins, only seven behind Matamata jockey Leith Innes, who won the 2003–2004 premiership. However, he was awarded the apprentice of the year title for the season.

==Overseas move==
Wanting to further his career, Walker announced in May 2004 that he was moving to Melbourne, Australia, following in the footsteps of other champion New Zealand jockeys, such as Midge Didham, Greg Childs, Brent Thomson, Shane Dye, and the Cassidy brothers, who made their names overseas.

Walker left with the blessing of Sharrock and the New Zealand racing fraternity. He made an immediate impression a few days after moving to Victoria, when he rode a 30-1 shot Monde Special to win the Warrnambool Cup. A couple of weeks later, he rode Chloe With Class to win at Moonee Valley to record his first metropolitan win, and followed that with a treble at Bendigo on 20 May 2004 on Lord Orb, Swift Rule, and Scopari.

His ride on &quot;Danestorm&quot; to win the Brisbane Cup in June 2004 was hailed by the media. However, he then went through a period of poor form, and wins were few and far between. 

In 2005, Michael returned to New Zealand and became a stable rider for leading Matamata trainer Mark Walker. With that deal, the winning feeling returned, and in March 2006, he produced a perfectly timed ride on Pentane to win New Zealand&#x27;s richest handicap, the Auckland Cup.

==Hunting accident==
On 20 May 2008, Walker was seriously injured while pig hunting in Taranaki when he fell down a 10-metre-high bank. He was taken to Taranaki Base Hospital and then transferred to Auckland City Hospital with serious head injuries. He scored a win in only his second ride after his accident at Matamata on 4 December 2008.

==Injury and retirement==

In August 2022, Michael Walker suffered a fall at a jumpout trial meeting at Pakenham, Victoria, and was hospitalised in intensive care and placed in an induced coma to stabilise him. This fall left Walker suffering from a brain injury, and in February 2023, he retired from raceday riding.

At the time of his retirement, it was reported that Walker had won 1144 races in New Zealand and more than 2000, including his victories in Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. This included 25 Group I races.

==Notable victories==

The following are some of the major races Michael has won in New Zealand and Australia.

<doc id="735899" wikidata="Q680517" url="?curid=735899" title="Walser German">
<text>Walser German () and Walliser German (, locally ) are a group of Highest Alemannic dialects spoken in parts of Switzerland (Valais, Ticino, Grisons), Italy (Piedmont, Aosta Valley), Liechtenstein (Triesenberg, Planken), and Austria (Vorarlberg).

Usage of the terms Walser and Walliser has come to reflect a difference of geography, rather than language. The term &quot;Walser&quot; refers to those speakers whose ancestors migrated into other Alpine valleys in medieval times, whereas &quot;Walliser&quot; refers only to a speaker from Upper Valais – that is, the upper Rhone valley. In a series of migrations during the Late Middle Ages, people migrated out of the Upper Valais, across the higher valleys of the Alps.

==History==

The Alemannic immigration to the Rhone valley started in the 8th century. There were presumably two different immigration routes, from what is now the Bernese Oberland, that led to two main groups of Walliser dialects. 
In the 12th or 13th century, the Walliser began to settle other parts of the Alps. These new settlements are known as Walser migration. In many of these settlements, people still speak Walser.

Because the people who speak Walser German live in the isolated valleys of the high mountains, Walser German has preserved certain archaisms retained from Old High German which were lost in other variants of German. The dialect of the Lötschental, for instance, preserved three distinct classes of weak verbs until the beginning of the 20th century.

Walser German dialects are considered endangered, and language shift to the majority language (French, Italian, Standard German) has taken place in the course of the later 20th century.

==Classification==

Walser German is part of the Highest Alemannic group, most closely related to dialects spoken in the Bernese Oberland and in Central Switzerland (Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Glarus).

There is limited mutual intelligibility with High Alemannic forms of Swiss German (whose speakers are called &quot;&quot; &quot;outer Swiss&quot; by the Walliser), and barely any mutual intelligibility with Standard German.

== Usage in Italy ==
In Italy, Walser German is almost never spoken between children of Walser people and is rarely spoken by their parents and most commonly by the grandparents. Often, older people will speak to younger people in Walser German, with the younger people responding in Italian. Walser German is most commonly but not exclusively used in private and familial settings when no non-speakers are present.

==Distribution and dialects==
The total number of speakers in the world estimated at 22,000 speakers (as of 2004), of whom about 10,000 are in Switzerland.
Because the dialect group is quite spread out, there is rarely any contact between the dialects. Therefore, the dialects that compose Walser German are very different from each other as well. 
Specific Walser dialects can be traced to eastern or western dialects of the Upper Valais. Conservative Walser dialects are more similar to the respective groups of Wallis dialects than to neighboring Walser dialects.

*Valais: Simplon, Gondo (Zwischbergen)
*valleys in the Monte Rosa massif:
**Aosta Valley: Gressoney-La-Trinité, Gressoney-Saint-Jean, Issime, historically in upper Ayas Valley and in Champdepraz.
** province of Vercelli: Alagna Valsesia, Alto Sermenza, Rimella, Riva Valdobbia
** province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola: Formazza, Macugnaga, Ornavasso, Agaro and Salecchio ( of Premia), Ausone, Campello Monti (frazione of Valstrona)
*Bernese Oberland: Lauterbrunnen, Mürren, Planalp
*Canton of Grisons: Rheinwald, Obersaxen, Vals GR, Signina (Gemeinde Riein, Safiental, Tenna, Valendas, Versam, Tschappina, Avers, Mutten, Schanfigg, upper Landwassertal, Davos, Prättigau
*Liechtenstein (probably settled from Prättigau): Triesenberg, Planken
*Canton of Ticino: Bosco/Gurin
*Canton of St. Gall: Calfeisental, Taminatal
*Vorarlberg and Tirol: Großes Walsertal, Kleines Walsertal; Tannberg, Schröcken, Lech and Warth, parts of Steeg in Tirol, Galtür and Ischgl in the Paznauntal, Brand, Bürserberg, Dünserberg, Ebnit, Laternsertal, Damüls, Silbertal
*Allgäu: Kleinwalsertal

== Phonology ==
Because the dialects of Walser German are different from each other, it is difficult to make generalizations about the language that apply to all the dialects. This section will be about the Walser German dialect of Formazza, or Pomattertitsch. Pomattertitsch is part of the Highest Alemannic German () dialect group, which is made up of dialects that share similar features. The Highest Alemannic German group contains German dialects of Valais; Walser German dialects in Italy and Ticino; and eastern Walser German dialects in Grisons, Vorarlberg, and Liechtenstein. The first feature that is shared by this group is the palatalization of Middle High German (MHG) &quot;-s-&quot; to &quot;-sch-&quot;. This is very typical of Walser German dialects in general. For Pomattertitsch, however, this does not apply to every word that contains -&quot;s&quot;-: &#x27;son&quot;&#x27;,&quot; &#x27;sun&#x27;, and &#x27;to be&#x27;. The second feature is a change from &quot;-nk-&quot; to &quot;-ch-&quot; or &quot;-h-:&quot; German to Pomattertitsch &#x27;think&#x27;, German to Pomattertitsch &#x27;drink&#x27;. The final feature is the lack of diphthongs where they are present in German words: German to Pomattertitsch &#x27;build&#x27;, German to Pomattertitsch &#x27;snow&#x27;.

== Morphology ==
Again, this section will be about the Walser German dialect Pomattertitsch.

=== Nouns ===
Pomattertitsch marks number (singular and plural) and gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) on nouns, like most dialects of German. It also marks case (nominative/accusative, genitive, dative) on nouns, although it has been reduced over time. It also distinguishes between strong and weak nouns.

Table 1 Nouns:

Pomattertitsch has definite (English &#x27;the&#x27;) and indefinite (English &#x27;a&#x27;) articles that agree in case, number, and gender with the noun:

Table 2 Definite Articles:

Table 3 Indefinite Articles:

Adjectives also agree in number, and gender with the noun it is modifying in Pomattertitsch. For adjectives in the attributive position, there is also agreement in strong versus weak nouns, and in case.

Table 4 Strong Attributive &#x27;tired&#x27;:

Table 5 Weak Attributive &#x27;tired&#x27;:

Table 6 Predicative &#x27;tired&#x27;:

In Pomattertitsch, there is a distinction between impersonal and personal pronouns. The impersonal pronoun is , which is third person singular. The personal pronouns agree in number and case, with third person agreeing in gender as well for singular pronouns only.

Table 7 Personal Pronouns:
=== Verbs ===
The verbs in Pomattertitsch can be categorized into one of four classes depending on their past participle and infinitive endings:
# Strong verbs: infinitive ending in &quot;-ä&quot;, past participle ending in &quot;-ä&quot;. Examples: &#x27;close&#x27;, &#x27;throw&#x27;, &#x27;milk&#x27;.
# Weak verbs, Old High German &quot;-jan&quot;, &quot;-en&quot;: infinitive ending in &quot;-ä&quot;, past participle ending in &quot;-t&quot;. Examples: &#x27;speak&#x27;, &#x27;live&#x27;.
# Weak verbs, Old High German &quot;-on&quot;: infinitive ending in &quot;-u&quot;, past participle ending in &quot;-(u)t&quot;. Examples: &#x27;make&#x27;, &#x27;listen&#x27;, &#x27;paint&#x27;.
# Weak verbs derived from Italian: infinitive ending in &quot;-ire&quot;, past participle ending in &quot;-irt&quot;. Examples: &#x27;think&#x27;, &#x27;study&#x27;.
The two classes that are most productive are three and four. The third class is most productive in deriving verbs from nouns, and the fourth class is most productive in deriving loan-words from Italian.

Table 8 Verb Conjugations in Present Indicative of &#x27;Normal Verbs&#x27;:

Table 9 Verb Conjugations in Present Indicative of &#x27;Special Verbs&#x27;:

In Pomattertitsch, a &#x27;dummy&#x27; auxiliary &#x27;do&#x27; followed by the infinitive form of a verb is common for the present indicative, subjunctive, and imperative. This insertion has the same meaning as if the verb was to be conjugated normally: &#x27;I do speak/I speak&#x27;.

There is not a preterite form in Pomattertitsch. Instead, past tense is expressed using the present perfect, which is formed with auxiliaries &#x27;to be&#x27; and &#x27;to have&#x27; followed by the past participle. On the other hand, the future tense is expressed morphologically by adding the particle at the end of an inflected verb and after enclitic pronouns, if there are any in the sentence.

The passive is expressed in Pomattertitsch by using the auxiliary &#x27;come&#x27; followed by the past participle of the verb, which agrees in gender and number with the subject of the sentence: &#x27;salami is eaten raw&#x27;. The causative is expressed using &#x27;do&#x27; followed by the agent of the caused event, then the preposition &quot;z&quot; (separate word, not morpheme), and then the infinitive: &#x27;and he makes the girl eat&#x27;. The imperative is expressed most commonly by using &#x27;do&#x27; plus the infinitive, as stated above: &#x27;do ask, ask!&#x27;. Another way is the bare indicative stem for the singular form, and the same present indicative form for the plural: &#x27;speak German, you!&#x27; and &#x27;come (pl) here!&#x27;.

There are two different subjunctive forms used in Pomattertitsch. The first form is used mainly in reported speech and in subordinate clauses that follow &#x27;say&#x27; or &#x27;think&#x27;. It also occurs in complement clauses that follow &#x27;that&#x27;. The second form is used for the conditional mood, where the conjunction &#x27;if&#x27; can be omitted without changing the meaning of the sentence.

Table 10 Subjunctive 1:

Table 11 Subjunctive 2:
== Syntax ==
The Walser German dialect group has the same word order as German, for the most part. For some dialects, however, there is a change occurring in the word order of verbal brace constructions. In German, the finite verb occurs in the second position, and the non-finite verb occurs in the final position:

Peter has just now the ball into the goal thrown

&#x27;Peter threw the ball into the goal just now&#x27;

In some dialects, specifically Gressoney, Formazza, and Rimella, the finite and non-finite verbs occur right next to each other, with the complements and adverbials at the end of the sentence. An example of this in Rimella is given below:

the father and the mother have made the cross to the child

&#x27;The father and mother made a cross for the child&#x27;

This is a change from SOV (subject, object, verb) to SVO word order. This change is due to the increasing influence of Italian on Walser German. However, the SOV word order is still used when there is negation and when there is an inverted subject.

Some southern dialects of Walser German are starting to omit the subject pronoun of sentences, just having the inflection on the verb to indicate what the subject is. This phenomenon is known as pro-dropping, and is common among languages. Italian is a pro-drop language, and German is not, which means that Italian is influencing some southern dialects of Walser German.

== Example ==

*An example of &quot;&quot; from Issime - Éischeme, Aosta Valley, Italy:

:English rough translation:

&quot;My grandfather came from Gaby, my grandmother from Issime, from hamlet Praz. Stévenin was the father, the grandmother came from the Chémonal family. [...] The pasture [in the Bourines Valley] probably belonged to my grandfather. I don&#x27;t know whether he was from my father&#x27;s side. It belonged to my family, they had a beautiful house in Gaby. Victor, my father, was from his lineage, his father, my grandfather, came from over there... Victor le gabençois. Later he had a son, to whom he gave his name, so that my father&#x27;s name was Victor too. He then got married when he was 56, and he had four sisters, two of them got married and two did not. They always worked and lived with him. Later one of them died.&quot;

<doc id="735925" wikidata="Q844449" url="?curid=735925" title="Panic of 1907">
<text>The Panic of 1907, also known as the 1907 Bankers&#x27; Panic or Knickerbocker Crisis, was a financial crisis that took place in the United States over a three-week period starting in mid-October, when the New York Stock Exchange suddenly fell almost 50% from its peak the previous year. The panic occurred during a time of economic recession, and there were numerous runs affecting banks and trust companies. The 1907 panic eventually spread throughout the nation when many state and local banks and businesses entered bankruptcy. The primary causes of the run included a retraction of market liquidity by a number of New York City banks and a loss of confidence among depositors, exacerbated by unregulated side bets at bucket shops.

The panic was triggered by the failed attempt in October 1907 to corner the market on stock of the United Copper Company. When the bid failed, banks that had lent money to the cornering scheme suffered runs that later spread to affiliated banks and trusts, leading a week later to the downfall of the Knickerbocker Trust Company, New York City&#x27;s third-largest trust. The collapse of the Knickerbocker spread fear throughout the city&#x27;s trusts as regional banks withdrew reserves from New York City banks. The panic then extended across the nation as vast numbers of people withdrew deposits from their regional banks, causing the 8th-largest decline in U.S. stock market history.

The panic might have deepened if not for the intervention of financier J. P. Morgan, who pledged large sums of his own money and convinced other New York bankers to do the same to shore up the banking system. That highlighted the limitations of the US Independent Treasury system, which managed the nation&#x27;s money supply but was unable to inject sufficient liquidity back into the market. By November, the financial contagion had largely ended, only to be replaced by a further crisis due to the heavy borrowing of a large brokerage firm using the stock of Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company (TC&amp;I) as collateral. Collapse of TC&amp;I&#x27;s stock price was averted by an emergency takeover by Morgan&#x27;s U.S. Steel Corporation, a move approved by the trust-busting President Theodore Roosevelt. The following year, Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, a leading Republican, established and chaired a commission to investigate the crisis and propose future solutions, which led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System.

== Economic conditions ==

When United States President Andrew Jackson allowed the charter of the Second Bank of the United States to expire in 1836, the U.S. was without any sort of central bank, and the money supply in New York City fluctuated with the country&#x27;s annual agricultural cycle. Each autumn money flowed out of the city as harvests were purchased and—in an effort to attract money back—interest rates were raised. Foreign investors then sent their money to New York to take advantage of the higher rates. From the January 1906 Dow Jones Industrial Average high of 103, the market began a modest correction that would continue throughout the year. The April 1906 earthquake that devastated San Francisco contributed to the market instability, prompting an even greater flood of money from New York to San Francisco to aid reconstruction. A further stress on the money supply occurred in late 1906, when the Bank of England raised its interest rates, partly in response to UK insurance companies paying out so much to US policyholders, and more funds remained in London than expected. From their peak in January, stock prices declined 18% by July 1906. By late September, stocks had recovered about half of their losses.

The Hepburn Act, which gave the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) the power to set maximum railroad rates, became law in July 1906. This depreciated the value of railroad securities. Between September 1906 and March 1907, the stock market slid, losing 7.7% of its capitalization. Between March 9 and 26, stocks fell a further 9.8%. (This March collapse is sometimes referred to as a &quot;rich man&#x27;s panic&quot;.) The economy remained volatile through the summer. A number of shocks hit the system: the stock of Union Pacific—among the most common stocks used as collateral—fell 50 points; that June an offering of New York City bonds failed; in July the copper market collapsed; in August the Standard Oil Company was fined $29 million for antitrust violations. In the first nine months of 1907, stocks were lower by 24.4%.

On July 27, &quot;The Commercial &amp; Financial Chronicle&quot; noted that &quot;the market keeps unstable ... no sooner are these signs of new life in evidence than something like a suggestion of a new outflow of gold to Paris sends a tremble all through the list, and the gain in values and hope is gone&quot;. Several bank runs occurred outside the US in 1907: in Egypt in April and May; in Japan in May and June; in Germany and Chile in early October. The fall season was always a vulnerable time for the banking system—combined with the roiled stock market, even a small shock could have grave repercussions.

== The panic ==

=== Cornering United Copper ===
The 1907 panic began with a stock manipulation scheme to corner the market in F. Augustus Heinze&#x27;s United Copper Company. Heinze had made a fortune as a copper magnate in Butte, Montana. In 1906 he moved to New York City, where he formed a close relationship with notorious Wall Street banker Charles W. Morse. Morse had once successfully cornered New York City&#x27;s ice market, and together with Heinze gained control of many banks—the pair served on the boards of at least six national banks, ten state banks, five trust companies and four insurance firms.
Augustus&#x27; brother, Otto, devised the scheme to corner United Copper, believing that the Heinze family already controlled a majority of the company. He also believed that a significant number of the Heinzes&#x27; shares had been borrowed, and sold short, by speculators betting that the stock price would drop, and that they could thus repurchase the borrowed shares cheaply, pocketing the difference. Otto proposed a short squeeze, in which the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price, and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.

To finance the scheme, Otto, Augustus and Charles Morse met with Charles T. Barney, president of the city&#x27;s third-largest trust, the Knickerbocker Trust Company. Barney had provided financing for previous Morse schemes. Morse, however, cautioned Otto that in order to attempt the squeeze, Otto needed much more money than Barney had, and Barney declined to provide funding. Otto decided to attempt the corner anyway. On Monday, October 14, he began aggressively purchasing shares of United Copper, which rose in one day from $39 to $52 per share. On Tuesday (Oct. 15), he issued the call for short sellers to return the borrowed stock. The share price rose to nearly $60, but the short sellers were able to find plenty of United Copper shares from sources other than the Heinzes. Otto had misread the market, and the share price of United Copper began to collapse.

The stock closed at $30 on Tuesday and fell to $10 by Wednesday (Oct. 16). Otto Heinze was ruined. The stock of United Copper was traded outside the hall of the New York Stock Exchange, literally an outdoor market &quot;on the curb&quot; (this curb market would later become the American Stock Exchange). After the crash, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported, &quot;Never has there been such wild scenes on the Curb, so say the oldest veterans of the outside market&quot;.

=== Contagion ===
The failure of the corner left Otto unable to meet his obligations and sent his brokerage house, Gross &amp; Kleeberg, into bankruptcy. On Thursday, October 17, the New York Stock Exchange suspended Otto&#x27;s trading privileges. As a result of United Copper&#x27;s collapse, the State Savings Bank of Butte Montana (owned by F. Augustus Heinze) announced its insolvency. The Montana bank had held United Copper stock as collateral against some of its lending and had been a correspondent bank for the Mercantile National Bank in New York City, of which F. Augustus Heinze was then president.

F. Augustus Heinze&#x27;s association with the corner and the insolvent State Savings Bank proved too much for the board of the Mercantile to accept. Although they forced him to resign before lunch time, by then it was too late. As news of the collapse spread, depositors rushed &quot;en masse&quot; to withdraw money from the Mercantile National Bank. The Mercantile had enough capital to withstand a few days of withdrawals, but depositors began to pull cash from the banks of the Heinzes&#x27; associate Charles W. Morse. Runs occurred at Morse&#x27;s National Bank of North America and the New Amsterdam National. Afraid of the impact the tainted reputations of Augustus Heinze and Morse could have on the banking system, the New York Clearing House (a consortium of the city&#x27;s banks) forced Morse and Heinze to resign all banking interests. By the weekend after the failed corner, there was not yet systemic panic. Funds were withdrawn from Heinze-associated banks, only to be deposited with other banks in the city.

A week later many regional stock exchanges throughout the nation were closing or limiting trading. For example, the Pittsburgh city&#x27;s stock exchange closed for three months starting on October 23, 1907.

=== Panic hits the trusts ===
In the early 1900s, trust companies were booming; in the decade before 1907, their assets had grown by 244%. During the same period, national bank assets grew by 97%, while state banks in New York increased by 82%. The leaders of the high-flying trusts were mainly prominent members of New York&#x27;s financial and social circles. One of the most respected was Charles T. Barney, whose late father-in-law William Collins Whitney was a famous financier. Barney&#x27;s Knickerbocker Trust Company was the third-largest trust in New York.

Because of past association with Charles W. Morse and F. Augustus Heinze, on Monday, October 21, the board of the Knickerbocker asked that Barney resign (depositors may have first begun to pull deposits from the Knickerbocker on October 18, prompting the concern). That day, the National Bank of Commerce where J.P. Morgan was a dominant factor, announced it would not serve as clearing house for the Knickerbocker. On October 22, the Knickerbocker faced a classic bank run. From the bank&#x27;s opening, the crowd grew. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;as fast as a depositor went out of the place ten people and more came asking for their money [and the police] were asked to send some men to keep order&quot;. Two van loads of notes were quickly unloaded, yet even this failed to calm the panic stricken depositors. Directors and other officials of the Trust forced their way through the crowd, assuring them that everyone would be paid. In less than three hours, $8 million was withdrawn from the Knickerbocker. Shortly after noon it was forced to suspend operations.

As news spread, other banks and trust companies were reluctant to lend any money. The interest rates on loans to brokers at the stock exchange soared to 70% and, with brokers unable to get money, stock prices fell to a low not seen since December 1900. The panic quickly spread to two other large trusts, Trust Company of America and Lincoln Trust Company. By Thursday, October 24, a chain of failures littered the street: Twelfth Ward Bank, Empire City Savings Bank, Hamilton Bank of New York, First National Bank of Brooklyn, International Trust Company of New York, Williamsburg Trust Company of Brooklyn, Borough Bank of Brooklyn, Jenkins Trust Company of Brooklyn and the Union Trust Company of Providence.

=== J. P. Morgan ===
When the chaos began to shake the confidence of New York&#x27;s banks, the city&#x27;s most famous banker was out of town. J. P. Morgan, the eponymous president of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., was attending a church convention in Richmond, Virginia. Morgan was not only the city&#x27;s wealthiest and most well-connected banker, but he had experience with other similar financial crises—he had helped rescue the U.S. Treasury during the Panic of 1893. As news of the crisis gathered, Morgan returned to Wall Street from his convention late on the night of Saturday, October 19. The following morning, the library of Morgan&#x27;s brownstone at Madison Avenue and 36th St. had become a revolving door of New York City bank and trust company presidents arriving to share information about (and seek help surviving) the impending crisis.

Morgan and his associates examined the books of the Knickerbocker Trust and decided it was insolvent, so they did not intervene to stop the run. Its failure, however, triggered runs on even healthy trusts, prompting Morgan to take charge of the rescue operation. On the afternoon of Tuesday, October 22, the president of the Trust Company of America asked Morgan for assistance. That evening Morgan conferred with George F. Baker, the president of First National Bank, James Stillman of the National City Bank of New York (the ancestor of Citibank), and the United States Secretary of the Treasury, George B. Cortelyou. Cortelyou said that he was ready to deposit government money in the banks to help shore up their deposits. After an overnight audit of the Trust Company of America showed the institution to be sound, on Wednesday afternoon Morgan declared, &quot;This is the place to stop the trouble, then.&quot;

As a run began on the Trust Company of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to liquidate the company&#x27;s assets to allow the bank to pay depositors. The bank survived to the close of business, but Morgan knew that additional money would be needed to keep it solvent through the following day. That night he assembled the presidents of the other trust companies and held them in a meeting until midnight, when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the Trust Company of America to stay open the next day. On Thursday morning Cortelyou deposited around $25 million into a number of New York banks. John D. Rockefeller, the wealthiest man in the United States, deposited a further $10 million in Stillman&#x27;s National City Bank. Rockefeller&#x27;s massive deposit left the National City Bank with the deepest reserves of any bank in the city. To instill public confidence, Rockefeller phoned Melville Stone, the manager of the Associated Press, and told him that he would pledge half of his wealth to maintain U.S. credit.

=== Stock exchange nears collapse ===
Despite the infusion of cash, the banks of New York were reluctant to make the short-term loans they typically provided to facilitate daily stock trades. Prices on the exchange began to crash, owing to the lack of funds to finance purchases. At 1:30 p.m. Thursday, October 24, Ransom Thomas, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, rushed to Morgan&#x27;s offices to tell him that he would have to close the exchange early. Morgan was emphatic that an early close of the exchange would be catastrophic.

Morgan summoned the presidents of the city&#x27;s banks to his office. They started to arrive at 2 p.m.; Morgan informed them that as many as 50 stock exchange houses would fail unless $25 million was raised in 10 minutes. By 2:16 p.m., 14 bank presidents had pledged $23.6 million to keep the stock exchange afloat. The money reached the market at 2:30 p.m., in time to finish the day&#x27;s trading, and by the 3 o&#x27;clock market close, $19 million had been loaned out. Disaster was averted. Morgan usually eschewed the press, but as he left his offices that night he made a statement to reporters: &quot;If people will keep their money in the banks, everything will be all right&quot;.

Friday, however, saw more panic on the exchange. Morgan again approached the bank presidents, but this time was only able to convince them to pledge $9.7 million. In order for this money to keep the exchange open, Morgan decided the money could not be used for margin sales. The volume of trading on Friday was 2/3 that of Thursday. The markets again narrowly made it to the closing bell.
===Crisis of confidence===

Morgan, Stillman, Baker and the other city bankers were unable to pool money indefinitely. Even the U.S. Treasury was low on funds. Public confidence needed to be restored, and on Friday evening the bankers formed two committees—one to persuade the clergy to calm their congregations on Sunday, and a second to explain to the press the various aspects of the financial rescue package. Europe&#x27;s most famous banker, Lord Rothschild, sent word of his &quot;admiration and respect&quot; for Morgan. In an attempt to gather confidence, the Treasury Secretary Cortelyou agreed that if he returned to Washington it would send a signal to Wall Street that the worst had passed.

To ensure a free flow of funds on Monday, the New York Clearing House issued $100 million in loan certificates to be traded between banks to settle balances, allowing them to retain cash reserves for depositors. Reassured both by the clergy and the newspapers, and with bank balance sheets flush with cash, a sense of order returned to New York that Monday.

Unbeknownst to Wall Street, a new crisis was being averted in the background. On Sunday, Morgan&#x27;s associate, George Perkins, was informed that the City of New York required at least $20 million by November 1 or it would go bankrupt. The city tried to raise money through a standard bond issue, but failed to gather enough financing. On Monday and again on Tuesday, New York Mayor George McClellan approached Morgan for assistance. In an effort to avoid the disastrous signal that a New York City bankruptcy would send, Morgan contracted to purchase $30 million worth of city bonds.

=== Drama at the library ===
Although calm was largely restored in New York by Saturday, November 2, yet another crisis loomed. One of the exchange&#x27;s largest brokerage firms, Moore &amp; Schley, was heavily in debt and in danger of collapse. The firm had borrowed heavily, using shares of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company (TC&amp;I) as collateral. With the value of the thinly traded stock under downward pressure (meaning the price was declining), many banks would likely call the loans of Moore &amp; Schley on Monday and force an &quot;en masse&quot; liquidation of the firm&#x27;s stock. If that occurred it would send TC&amp;I shares plummeting, devastating Moore and Schley and triggering further panic in the market.

To avert the collapse of Moore &amp; Schley, Morgan called an emergency conference at his library Saturday morning. A proposal was made that the U.S. Steel Corporation, a company Morgan had helped form through the merger of the steel companies of Andrew Carnegie and Elbert Gary, would acquire TC&amp;I. This would effectively save Moore &amp; Schley and avert the crisis. The executives and board of U.S. Steel studied the situation and offered to either loan Moore &amp; Schley $5 million, or buy TC&amp;I for $90 a share. By 7 p.m. an agreement had not been reached and the meeting adjourned.

By then, Morgan was drawn into another situation. There was deep concern that the Trust Company of America and the Lincoln Trust might fail to open on Monday due to continuing runs by depositors. On Saturday evening 40–50 bankers gathered at the library to discuss the crisis, with the clearing-house bank presidents in the East room and the trust company executives in the West room. Morgan and those dealing with the Moore &amp; Schley situation moved to the librarian&#x27;s office. There Morgan told his counselors that he would agree to help shore up Moore &amp; Schley only if the trust companies would work together to bail out their weakest brethren. The discussion among the bankers continued late into Saturday night but without much progress. Around midnight, J. P. Morgan informed a leader of the trust company presidents that keeping Moore &amp; Schley afloat would require $25 million, and he would not commit those funds unless the problems with the trust companies could also be resolved. The trust company executives understood they would not receive further help from Morgan; they would have to finance any bailout of the two struggling trust companies.

At 3 a.m. about 120 bank and trust company officials assembled to hear a full report on the status of the failing trust companies. While the Trust Company of America was barely solvent, the Lincoln Trust Company was probably $1 million short of what it needed to cover depositor accounts. As discussion ensued, the bankers realized that Morgan had locked them in the library and pocketed the key to force a solution, the sort of strong-arm tactic he had been known to use in the past. Morgan then entered the talks and advised the trust companies that they must provide a loan of $25 million to save the weaker institutions. The trust presidents were still reluctant to act, but Morgan informed them that if they did not it would lead to a complete collapse of the banking system. Through his considerable influence, at about 4:45 a.m. he persuaded the unofficial leader of the trust companies to sign the agreement, and the remainder of the bankers followed. Having received these commitments, Morgan allowed the bankers to go home.
On Sunday afternoon and into the evening, Morgan, Perkins, Baker and Stillman, along with U.S. Steel&#x27;s Gary and Henry Clay Frick, worked at the library to finalize the deal for U.S. Steel to buy TC&amp;I and by Sunday night had a plan for acquisition. But one obstacle remained: the anti-trust crusading President Theodore Roosevelt, who had made breaking up monopolies a focus of his presidency.

Frick and Gary traveled overnight by train to the White House to implore Roosevelt to set aside the application of the Sherman Antitrust Act and allow—before the market opened—a company that already held a 60% share of the steel market to make a large acquisition. Roosevelt&#x27;s secretary refused to see them, but Frick and Gary convinced James Rudolph Garfield, the Secretary of the Interior, to bypass the secretary and arrange a meeting with the president. With less than an hour before the Stock Exchange opened, Roosevelt and Secretary of State Elihu Root began to review the proposed takeover and appreciate the crash likely to ensue if the merger was not approved. Roosevelt relented; he later recalled of the meeting, &quot;It was necessary for me to decide on the instant before the Stock Exchange opened, for the situation in New York was such that any hour might be vital. I do not believe that anyone could justly criticize me for saying that I would not feel like objecting to the purchase under those circumstances&quot;. When news reached New York, confidence soared. The &quot;Commercial &amp; Financial Chronicle&quot; reported that &quot;the relief furnished by this transaction was instant and far-reaching&quot;. The final crisis of the panic had been averted.

== Aftermath ==
The panic of 1907 occurred during a lengthy economic contraction, measured by the National Bureau of Economic Research as occurring between May 1907 and June 1908. The interrelated contraction, bank panic, and falling stock market resulted in significant economic disruption. Industrial production dropped further than after any previous bank run, and 1907 saw the second-highest volume of bankruptcies to that date. Production fell by 11% and imports by 26%, while unemployment rose to 8% from under 3%. Immigration dropped to 750,000 people in 1909, from 1.2 million two years earlier.

Since the end of the Civil War, the United States had experienced panics of varying severity. Economists Charles Calomiris and Gary Gorton rate the worst panics as those leading to widespread bank suspensions: the panics of 1873, 1893, and 1907, and a suspension in 1914. Widespread suspensions were forestalled through coordinated actions during the 1884 and 1890 panics. A bank crisis in 1896, in which there was a perceived need for coordination, is also sometimes classified as a panic.

The frequency of crises and the severity of the 1907 panic added to concern about the outsized role of J.P. Morgan and renewed impetus toward a national debate on reform. In May 1908, Congress passed the Aldrich–Vreeland Act, which established the National Monetary Commission to investigate the panic and to propose legislation to regulate banking. 

=== Central bank ===
A significant difference between the European and U.S. banking systems was the absence of a central bank in the United States. European states were able to extend the supply of money during periods of low cash reserves. The belief that the U.S. economy was vulnerable without a central bank was not new. Early in 1907, banker Jacob Schiff of Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co. warned in a speech to the New York Chamber of Commerce that &quot;unless we have a central bank with adequate control of credit resources, this country is going to undergo the most severe and far reaching money panic in its history&quot;.

In 1908: Frank A. Vanderlip led a U.S. business delegation to Japan to meet with Japanese financial leaders including Taka Kawada, Shibusawa Eiichi and his son Shibusawa Masao, also founding members of Mitsui &amp; Co., Takuma Dan &amp; Takamine Mitsui with the goal allying with Japan to resolve the Panic of 1907 and the unstable U.S. stock market.

Aldrich convened a secret conference with a number of the nation&#x27;s leading financiers at the Jekyll Island Club, off the coast of Georgia, to discuss monetary policy and the banking system in November 1910. Aldrich and A. P. Andrew (Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Department), Paul Warburg (representing Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.), Frank A. Vanderlip (James Stillman&#x27;s successor as president of the National City Bank of New York), Henry P. Davison (senior partner of J. P. Morgan Company), Charles D. Norton (president of the Morgan-dominated First National Bank of New York), and Benjamin Strong (representing J. P. Morgan), produced a design for a &quot;National Reserve Bank&quot;.

The final report of the National Monetary Commission was published on January 11, 1911. For nearly two years legislators debated the proposal, and it was not until December 23, 1913, that Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act. President Woodrow Wilson signed the legislation immediately, and the legislation was enacted on the same day, creating the Federal Reserve System. Charles Hamlin became the Fed&#x27;s first chairman, and none other than Morgan&#x27;s deputy Benjamin Strong became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the most important regional bank, with a permanent seat on the Federal Open Market Committee.

=== Pujo Committee ===

Although Morgan was briefly seen as a hero, widespread fears concerning plutocracy and concentrated wealth soon eroded this view. Morgan&#x27;s bank had survived, but the trust companies that were a growing rival to traditional banks were badly damaged. Some analysts believed that the panic had been engineered to damage confidence in trust companies so that banks would benefit. Others believed Morgan took advantage of the panic to allow his U.S. Steel company to acquire TC&amp;I. Although Morgan lost $21 million in the panic, and the significance of the role he played in staving off worse disaster is undisputed, he also became the focus of intense scrutiny and criticism.

The chair of the House Committee on Banking and Currency, Representative Arsène Pujo (D–La. 7th), convened a special committee to investigate a &quot;money trust&quot;, the &quot;de facto&quot; monopoly of Morgan and New York&#x27;s other most powerful bankers. The committee issued a scathing report on the banking trade and found that the officers of J. P. Morgan &amp; Co. also sat on the boards of directors of 112 corporations with a market capitalization of $22.5 billion (the total capitalization of the New York Stock Exchange was then estimated at $26.5 billion).

Although suffering ill health, J. P. Morgan testified before the Pujo Committee and faced several days of questioning from Samuel Untermyer. Untermyer and Morgan&#x27;s famous exchange on the fundamentally psychological nature of banking—that it is an industry built on trust—is often quoted in business articles:
&lt;poem&gt;
:Untermyer: Is not commercial credit based primarily upon money or property?
:Morgan: No, sir. The first thing is character.
:Untermyer: Before money or property?
:Morgan: Before money or anything else. Money cannot buy it … a man I do not trust could not get money from me on all the bonds in Christendom.
&lt;/poem&gt;
Associates of Morgan blamed his continued physical decline on the hearings. He became ill in February and died on March 31, 1913, nine months before the Federal Reserve officially replaced the &quot;money trust&quot; as lender of last resort.

<text>The United States attorney for the Southern District of New York is the chief federal law enforcement officer in eight contiguous New York counties: the counties (coextensive boroughs of New York City) of New York (Manhattan) and Bronx, and the counties of Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Dutchess, and Sullivan. Established by the Judiciary Act of 1789, the office represents the United States government in criminal and civil cases across the country. The SDNY handles a broad array of cases, including but not limited to those involving white collar crime, domestic terrorism, cybercrime, public corruption, organized crime, and civil rights disputes.

The Southern District has earned itself the moniker the &quot;Sovereign District of New York&quot;. Its resources, culture, and accompanying FBI field office have given the SDNY a reputation for being exceptionally aggressive in its pursuit of criminals. Due to its jurisdiction over the New York City borough of Manhattan, the preeminent financial center of the United States of America, the office&#x27;s incumbent is often nicknamed the &quot;Sheriff of Wall Street&quot;.

==Organization==
The office is organized into two divisions handling civil and criminal matters. The Southern District of New York also has two offices: in Manhattan and White Plains. The office employs approximately 220 assistant U.S. attorneys.

==List of U.S. attorneys==
In 1814, the District of New York was divided into the Northern and the Southern District.

<text>A humectant is a hygroscopic (water-absorbing) substance used to keep things moist. They are used in many products, including food, cosmetics, medicines and pesticides. When used as a food additive, a humectant has the effect of keeping moisture in the food. Humectants are sometimes used as a component of antistatic coatings for plastics.

A humectant attracts and retains the moisture in the air nearby via absorption, drawing the water vapor into or beneath the organism&#x27;s or object&#x27;s surface. This is the opposite use of a hygroscopic material where it is used as a desiccant used to draw moisture away.

In pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, humectants can be used in topical dosage forms to increase the solubility of a chemical compound&#x27;s active ingredients, increasing the active ingredients&#x27; ability to penetrate skin, or its activity time. This hydrating property can also be needed to counteract a dehydrating active ingredient (e.g., soaps, corticoids, and some alcohols), which is why humectants are common ingredients in a wide range of cosmetic and personal care products that make moisturization claims (e.g., hair conditioners, body lotions, face or body cleansers, lip balms, and eye creams).

==Chemistry==
A humectant is often a molecule with several hydrophilic groups, most often hydroxyl groups; however, amines and carboxyl groups, sometimes esterified, can be encountered as well (its affinity to form hydrogen bonds with molecules of water is the crucial trait).

==Examples==
Examples of some humectants include:

* Propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, and butylene glycol
* Aloe vera gel
* Alpha hydroxy acids such as lactic acid
* Egg yolk and egg white
* Glyceryl triacetate
* Honey
* Lithium chloride
* Molasses
* Polymeric polyols such as polydextrose
* Quillaia
* Sodium hexametaphosphate E452i
* Sugar alcohols (sugar polyols) such as glycerol, sorbitol, xylitol, maltitol
* Urea
* Castor oil
==Uses==
A humectant is a substance that is used to keep products moisturized and affects the preservation of items, which can be used in cosmetic products, food and tobacco. A
humectant-rich formulation contains simple alcoholic sugar that can increase skin hydration and helps to remove and reduce thickness of skin.

===Food additives===
Some common humectants used in food are honey and glucose syrup both for their water absorption and sweet flavor. Glucose syrup also helps to retain the shape of the product better than other alternatives, for a longer period of time. In addition, some humectants are recognized in different countries as good food additives because of the increase in nutritional value that they provide, such as sodium hexametaphosphate.

In order to gauge a compound&#x27;s humectancy, scientists will put it through a series of tests, often involving water absorption. In tests involving toothpaste, the process is also coupled with a sweetness test and a crystallization test. When humectancy is being assessed in different products, testers will compare the results to other humectants that are already used in those products, in order to evaluate efficiency.

Some of these humectants are seen in non-ionic polyols like sucrose, glycerin or glycerol and its triester (triacetin). These humectant food additives are used for the purpose of controlling viscosity and texture. Humectants also add bulk, retain moisture, reduce water activity, and improve softness. A main advantage of humectant food additives is that, since they are non-ionic, they are not expected to influence any variation of the pH aqueous systems.

Glycerol or glycerin humectants undergo a pretreatment process using saponification, bleaching, ion exchange exclusion, both cationic and ionic ion exchanges, vacuum flash evaporation, thin film distillation, and heating to produce a 100% pure glycerol.

Humectants are used in stabilization of food products and lengthening shelf life through food and moisture control. The available moisture determines microbial activity, physical properties, sensory properties and the rate of chemical changes, that if not controlled, are the cause of reduced shelf life. Examples are dry cereal with semi-moist raisins, ice cream in a cone, chocolate, hard candy with liquid centers and cheese. Humectants are used to stabilize the moisture content of foodstuffs and are incorporated as food additives. Humectants are also used in military technology for the use of MREs and other military rations.
A number of food items always need to be moist. The use of humectants reduces the available water, thus reducing bacterial activity. They are used for safety issues, for quality, and to have a longer shelf-life in food products.

An example of where humectants are used to keep food moist is in products like toothpaste as well as certain kinds of cookies. Regional kinds of cookies often use humectants as a binding agent in order to keep moisture locked into the center of the cookie rather than have it evaporate out. Humectants are favored in food products because of their ability to keep consumable goods moist and increase shelf-life.

===Cosmetics===
Humectants are frequently used in cosmetics as a way of increasing and maintaining moisture in the skin and hair, in products including shampoo, conditioner, frizz serum, lotions, creams, lip treatments, cleansers, after-sun lotion, and some soaps or body lotions. As hygroscopic moisturizers, humectants work by attracting water to the upper layer of the skin (stratum corneum). All humectants have common hydroxyl groups which allow them to participate in hydrogen bonding and attract water. This process attracts moisture from the outer layer of the skin or, in high humidity, from the atmosphere. The moisture is then trapped against the epidermis or the shaft of the hair, depending on where the humectant is applied. Various humectants have different ways of behaving because they differ in water binding capacity at different humidities.

Humectants used in cosmetics include triethylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, propylene glycol, and PPGs. Other popular humectants in cosmetics include glycerin, sorbitol (sugar alcohol), hexylene and butylene glycol, urea, and collagen. Glycerin is one of the most popular humectants used because it produces the desired result fairly frequently and is low in cost. A category of humectants called nanolipidgels allow skin to retain moisture, but also possess antifungal properties. Scientists are also working to discover different types of humectants; a study published in 2011 concluded that extracts from wine cakes have the potential to be used as a humectant in cosmetics.

Humectants have been added to skin moisturizing products to treat xerosis. Some moisturizers tend to weaken the skin barrier function, but studies on xerosis have proven that moisturizers containing humectants increase desired moisturizing effects on the affected area without damage to the skin barrier function. In this xerosis treatments study, some &quot;smarting and stinging&quot; was also reported from the use of humectant-rich treatment products.

When the humectant glycerol was added to soaps for the cleansing of wounds, similar effects were found. There was an increase in moisture in the areas that the soap was applied, however, &quot;further consideration of conditioning the use of glycerol to improve the absorption of exudates from wounds for an advanced wound healing is needed.&quot; The healing properties of humectants are therefore uncertain.

Humectants are also added to toothpaste (dentifrice) to stop the product drying out and cracking in the tube. Sorbitol is commonly used as this also contributes a sweet flavour to the toothpaste without contributing to tooth decay.

===Tobacco products===

Humectants are used in the manufacturing of some tobacco products, such as cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and self-rolled tobacco. They are used to control and maintain the moisture content of the cut tobacco filler and add flavor. Humectants are vital to the creation of cigarettes. In an examination of waterpipe smoking, researchers worked to identify substances such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein in the smoke of a waterpipe, discovering that the value of formaldehyde detected in one smoking session was five times higher than that of a regular cigarette. This data demonstrated that increasing amounts of humectants in the unburned tobacco lowered the temperature in the waterpipe head during smoking, so that considerable amounts of toxic substances were present. Further, e-cigarettes produce aerosol by heating a humectant containing nicotine without burning tobacco. Those &quot;vaping&quot; then inhale the aerosol and receive nicotine.

The main health concern regarding e-cigarettes is that their production is not regulated, and there is immense uncertainty of quality control during manufacturing. Self-rolled tobacco contains more humectants, which are added to tobacco to improve taste and keep from drying out. As the humectants burn, they release chemicals such as acrolein. Humectants are found in most cigarettes and are considered one of the most dangerous chemicals found in tobacco.

However, there have been conflicting claims about the degree to which these products warrant a health concern. In a literary study of e-cigarette health risks, 388 different symptoms were reported; mouth and throat concerns generated more negative symptoms than any other group. There are not enough studies or sufficient evidence to suggest that products, particularly the contaminants of the aerosol in e-cigarettes, produce health risks at a concerning level. More research is currently being conducted to find the true dangers of the use of humectants in cigarettes.

<text>Avellaneda (, ) is a port city in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, and the seat of the Avellaneda Partido, whose population was 342,677 as per the . Avellaneda is located within the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area, and is connected to neighboring Buenos Aires by several bridges over the Riachuelo River.

==Overview==
Located on land granted to Adelantado Juan Torres de Vera y Aragón by Captain Juan de Garay in 1620, a port settlement known as &quot;Puerto del Riachuelo&quot; first emerged here in 1731. Established as &quot;Barracas al Sur&quot; on April 7, 1852, by Quilmes Justice of the Peace Martín José de la Serna, the town grew to become a major rail center during the late 19th century. It was renamed on January 11, 1904, after former President Nicolás Avellaneda. It was declared a city on October 23, 1895, and its population has been stable since around 1960. 
Avellaneda is one of the foremost wholesale and industrial centers of Argentina. The city&#x27;s largest employers are textile mills, meat-packing and grain-processing plants, oil refineries, metallurgical works, extensive docking facilities, and markets for farm and ranch products; some of the most prominent firms whose main facilities are in Avellaneda are food processor Molinos Río de la Plata, beverage maker Cepas Argentinas, bathroom fixtures maker Ferrum, and América 24 cable news. The National University of Avellaneda was established here in 2009.

The Central Produce Market (&quot;Mercado Central de Frutos&quot;) also operated in Avellaneda. Located on the banks of the Riachuelo, it was developed by Irish Argentine businessman Eduardo Casey and inaugurated in 1889; served by a Buenos Aires Western Railway rail link, the brick structure was at the time the largest warehouse in the world. The decentralization of warehousing and wholesaling during the 20th century, as well as its nationalization in 1946 as part of the IAPI state export agency, resulted in its decline, however, and the Central Produce Market closed in 1963. It was ultimately demolished in 1966 to make way for the New Pueyrredón Bridge that connects Avellaneda to the Frondizi Expressway in Buenos Aires proper.

==Religion==
The Diocese of Avellaneda and Lanús was formally established in 1961. Its cathedral, &quot;Iglesia Catedral de la Asunción&quot;, had been consecrated a century earlier. The construction of numerous high rises around Alsina Square during the 1950s and &#x27;60s led to irreparable structural damage to the cathedral, however, and in 1967 it was closed to the public. Demolished in 1971, the Renaissance Revival cathedral was replaced in 1984 by a modern structure.

==Sports==

Two of the most important Argentine football clubs, Independiente and Racing, are located in Avellaneda. The city became the third in the world (after Milan and Montevideo) to be home to two world championship teams when Independiente won the 1973 Intercontinental Cup.

<text>Harlequin was a technology company based in Cambridge, UK and Cambridge, Massachusetts. It specialized in application software for printing, graphics, law enforcement, artificial intelligence, and in implementations of programming languages. Harlequin employees sometimes referred to themselves as &quot;The &#x27;Late Binding&#x27; company&quot; and the firm eventually evolved into a think tank for advanced technologies.

After Global Graphics purchased Harlequin, they spun off the application groups for Lisp, artificial intelligence (AI), and law enforcement as Xanalys, and they spun off the Harlequin Dylan team as Functional Objects. Global Graphics acquired Harlequin mainly for the PostScript technologies, and it still continues to develop and market them under the Harlequin name.

==Think tank products==
Harlequin had two main lines of business:
* Digital prepress (mainly ScriptWorks, a PostScript language compatible raster image processor (RIP), now selling under the name Harlequin RIP)
* Modern language development environments: compilers and integrated development environments (IDEs) for Lisp (LispWorks), ML (MLWorks), and Dylan (DylanWorks)

Other products included data analysis tools created using LispWorks, the Lisp IDE.

The think tank structure of Harlequin can also be recognized via the development of a flexible and modular memory management system, the Memory Pool System (MPS). MPS was designed to support:
* A wide range of requirements from high-speed manual memory management, to complex garbage collection with many different types of reference
* Two products: ScriptWorks PostScript RIP, and the Harlequin Dylan compiler and IDE for the Dylan language

==Think tank spin-offs==
In January 2005 employees founded the independently owned LispWorks Limited to focus on the Lisp business.

Several of Harlequin&#x27;s other assets and technologies have also been acquired and open sourced by companies founded by former Harlequin employees.
* Functional Objects Inc., was founded in 1999 to continue developing and producing the Dylan IDE. In 2004, all code was open sourced to The Gwydion Maintainers. They renamed the IDE to Open Dylan.
* Ravenbrook Limited acquired the Memory Management Reference, a public resource on memory management and garbage collection, the Memory Pool System, a flexible memory manager and garbage collector (now open sourced), and MLWorks, a Standard ML compiler and integrated development environment (also open sourced).

==History==

Harlequin Limited was founded in 1987 by Jo Marks in Cambridge, England, and the first offices were located in the founder&#x27;s home in Cambridge. The firm later moved to an office on Station Road, Cambridge, then in 1989 relocated to Barrington Hall, in the village of Barrington, Cambridgeshire, near Cambridge, which became the permanent company headquarters.

Expansion followed, and Harlequin Limited became The Harlequin Group Limited, with wholly owned subsidiaries in the United Kingdom (UK) (Harlequin Limited), the United States (Harlequin, Inc. - office opened in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1993) and Australia (Harlequin Australia Pty Limited).
The firm acquired in February 1995 the rights to the Lisp-related technology Lucid Common Lisp of Lucid Inc., that went out of business in summer 1994 due to financial hardships. Many of the newly hired American Lisp staff had formerly worked for two other Lisp companies which had failed previously: Lucid Inc. and Symbolics. In 1997, the group company became Harlequin Group plc.

At its peak in 1997–1998 the firm had over 300 staff, with offices in: Cambridge, England (including Barrington Hall and Longstanton); Edinburgh; Manchester; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Menlo Park, California, and several other places.

Due to failed expansion plans, the firm was declared bankrupt in summer 1999 and went into administration. It was acquired by Global Graphics, primarily for the PostScript technologies, which Global Graphics continues to develop and market under the Harlequin name (in 2006). Global Graphics created a subsidiary Xanalys for the data analysis and LispWorks businesses. In November 2006, Global moved from Barrington Hall to Cambourne Business Park.

In September 2005, CompuDyne Corporation acquired Xanalys, which operated for several years as part of Tiburon, Inc. the Public Safety and Justice division of CompuDyne. In January 2009 Xanalys was acquired by the UK staff based in Manchester and Cambridge. The firm continues to sell investigation and analysis tools developed by Harlequin originally (such as Link Explorer and Powercase) to a worldwide market.

<doc id="735944" wikidata="Q939340" url="?curid=735944" title="Freewinds">
<text>MV &quot;Freewinds is a former [[cruise ship]] operated by [[International Shipping Partners]] and owned by San Donato Properties, a company affiliated with the [[Church of Scientology]]. She was built in 1968 by [[Wärtsilä]] [[Crichton-Vulcan|Turku Shipyard]] in [[Turku]], [[Finland]], for [[Wallenius Lines]] asMS &quot;Bohème for service with Commodore Cruise Line. She was the first cruise ship built in Finland. Her ownership passed to a Church of Scientology-controlled company in 1985.

==Concept and construction==
The ship that eventually became known as the &quot;Freewinds&quot; was originally ordered by the Sweden-based Lion Ferry as the second in a pair of two car/passenger ferries for use on their new Bremerhaven (West Germany)–Harwich (United Kingdom) service, with provisions made for cruise service during the northern hemisphere winter season. The ships shared the same design as and , that were under construction for Finnlines at Wärtsilä Helsinki Shipyard at the time. The ships ordered by Lion Ferry were built at Wärtsilä&#x27;s Turku Shipyard, and the first of them, , was delivered to her owners on 14 May 1966. However, the passenger demand on the Bremerhaven–Harwich route proved to be insufficient for two ships, and Lion Ferry cancelled the order for a second ship, which was to be named &quot;Prins Albert&quot;.

Meanwhile, the newly founded Commodore Cruise Line was looking for ships to operate on cruises around the Caribbean. An agreement was reached where the build contract of the half-complete ship was sold to the Sweden-based Wallenius Lines, which would have the ship completed as a cruise ship and, following completion, she would be chartered to Commodore Cruise Lines. Following their tradition of naming ships after operas, Wallenius decided to name the ship &quot;Bohème&quot;, after La bohème. Cabins were added in place of the car decks on the ship (although bow or stern doors were never fitted on her), and her superstructure was redesigned to better accommodate the need for sundeck space in the warmer climates. &quot;Bohème&quot; was delivered to Wallenius Bremen, Wallenius Lines&#x27; West Germany-based subsidiary, on 12 November 1968. She was registered in West Germany, with Bremerhaven as her home port.

==Service history==

===1968–1981: Wallenius Lines ownership===
Following delivery the &quot;Bohème&quot; sailed to Stockholm, the location of Wallenius Lines&#x27; headquarters, for a presentation to invited guests. On departing Stockholm for Miami she carried her first paying passengers on board. Her maiden voyage was cut short however, as she hit an underwater cliff outside Dalarö in the Stockholm Archipelago. The cliff breached the ship&#x27;s hull and fuel tanks. Lifeboats were used to evacuate all passengers from the listing ship, and three days later she was refloated and towed to the Finnboda shipyard in Nacka for week-long repairs. After the repairs she again left for Miami, this time without passengers.

On 7 December 1968, the &quot;Bohème&quot; left on her first cruise from Miami to Saint Thomas. During her first year in service, the ship experienced notable air conditioning problems due to its shipyard&#x27;s inexperience with ships destined for the warm Caribbean climate. As a result, she returned to Europe in 1980, sailing to the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg, West Germany where the air conditioning system was rebuilt, and an additional screw compressor as well as two freshwater generators were installed. Following the rebuild, the &quot;Bohème&quot; re-entered service with a Miami–Puerto Plata–Saint Thomas–San Juan–Cap-Haïtien–Miami itinerary. She followed the same itinerary all year long, becoming the first ship to offer year-round seven-night cruises from Miami. She was also the first cruise ship to call at Puerto Plata and the first to offer regular sailings to Cap Haitien.

===1981–1986: Rederi Ab Sally ownership===
In March 1981, Commodore Cruise Line, as well as the &quot;Bohème&quot;, were sold to the Finland-based Rederi Ab Sally. The new owners re-registered the &quot;Bohème&quot; in Panama, leading to the resignation of most of the German officers due to worsened working conditions. The resigning officers were replaced with Scandinavians. The following year, the German deck and engine crews were replaced by Filipinos. Originally, the new crew members were meant for , a former ocean liner (ex Gripsholm 1957) Sally had purchased for conversion into service with Commodore Cruise Line. However, after the &quot;Navarino&quot; was severely damaged following the capsizing of its dry dock, the conversion plans were abandoned. The crew already hired for the &quot;Navarino&quot; was transferred to the &quot;Bohème&quot;.

Between November 1982 and August 1983, the &quot;Bohème&quot; was chartered to Brazilia-based Saitecin Cruises for cruises around South America. She also made one cruise from Miami under this charter. Following this charter, the ship again returned to West Germany to be rebuilt, this time in Bremerhaven, where two new diesel generators were installed and much of the interior decorations replaced. While in Bremerhaven, she also received a new external livery. On returning to service in 1984, the &quot;Bohème&quot; was placed on a new Miami–Port-au-Prince–Port Antonio–Grand Cayman–Cozumel–Miami itinerary. The schedule proved to be too tight to maintain, especially in poor weather conditions. With engine problems causing further issues, this itinerary only lasted until November 1984, when the ship was chartered to SeaEscape for its Miami–Freeport ferry service.

In February 1985, the &quot;Bohème&quot; returned to Commodore Cruise Line service. Her port of departure was changed to Saint Petersburg, Florida, to better cater to the needs of Commodore&#x27;s main clientele, retired people living on Florida&#x27;s west coast. The ship&#x27;s new seven-day itinerary was Saint Petersburg–Key West–Port Antonio–Cozumel–Saint Petersburg. The new route proved to be short-lived, as the &quot;Bohème&quot; was sold to San Donato Properties Corporation in September 1986 for US$10 million (), to be converted for use with the Church of Scientology.

===1986 onwards: Scientology acquisition and ownership===
In 1984, the Church of Scientology&#x27;s parent body, the Church of Scientology International (CSI), decided to acquire a ship on which to deliver high-level Scientology courses. According to a statement by the Church:

The Flag Ship Trust (FST) entity was formed in December 1985 with the aid of a US$5 million donation from the International Association of Scientologists. In September 1986, the FST purchased &quot;Bohème&quot;, renamed her &quot;Freewinds&quot;, and refitted her to enable use for Scientology purposes. Lawrence Woodcraft, a licensed British architect in the Sea Org, was chosen by FST to be the &quot;Chief Architect&quot; of the ship. Upon arrival, Woodcraft discovered that he was not doing any design work but only producing working drawings of renderings and sketches by the &quot;LRH Architects&quot; Barry and Carol Stein (whom Woodcraft later found out were not licensed architects). The designs were full of functional defects, such as moving the dining room two decks up without the kitchen and replacing the existing dining room with a course room (causing disturbances from the noise from the kitchen). When Woodcraft pointed out such defects, he was overruled, and in the case of the restaurant, senior managers ordered an elevator to be installed, which required cutting through steel floors, threatening the ship&#x27;s structural integrity. Woodcraft and the chief of the renovations, Steve Kozaki, were unsure about the composition of the walls. Kozaki slammed a hammer into a wall, releasing a powdery substance that Woodcraft immediately identified as asbestos. He later confirmed it when he found the original Finnish blueprints, which clearly labeled &quot;asbestos&quot; insulation all over the ship. Woodcraft confronted the Chief Engineer, Wack Alcock, who immediately denied having asbestos and claimed it was just &quot;insulation.&quot; Woodcraft informed multiple people, who all disregarded his warnings, except Bitty Miscavige, the sister-in-law of Scientology head David Miscavige, who supervised the project. Bitty immediately became concerned and tried to resolve the issue, but decided not to after Alcock could not find anything about asbestos in L Ron Hubbard&#x27;s literature and reminded Bitty of Scientology doctrine, which held that cancer was caused by &quot;sexual misconduct,&quot; not asbestos. Further damage was caused when one of Hubbard&#x27;s writings was found to criticize fiberglass, as a consequence of which Sea Org ordered the removal of all the fiberglass protecting the ship from the Caribbean sun.

Once construction started, Woodcraft witnessed how Sea Org members without experience in maritime engineering or interior design were brought without pay, carelessly ripping into the interiors, ventilation, and plumbing, releasing asbestos all over the ship. Many Sea Org members were covered head-to-toe with asbestos, with one individual, after being warned about it by Woodcraft, dismissing his concern and biting into the asbestos. The ship&#x27;s construction fell vastly behind schedule and over budget, so Scientology management contracted &quot;CCL,&quot; a professional ship refitting company based out of Southampton working primarily in Miami. Upon arrival, CCL Engineers were shocked and outraged by the ship&#x27;s condition and the asbestos contamination, threatening to report them to the authorities. Scientology management allegedly paid CCL extra money, fearing a significant public relations issue. They compromised to have Sea Org members spray contaminated areas with water in a useless attempt to prevent the asbestos from becoming airborne. Eventually, relations with CCL broke down, and they left without performing any work. It was then decided to recruit non-Sea Org Scientologists with the necessary skills to complete the construction. The vessel was placed back into service in June 1988.

The ownership and management of the vessel was organized through a complicated web of Scientology-run corporations and entities, most of which are owned by the FST. It is owned by San Donato Properties, a Panamanian corporation of which FST is the sole shareholder. Another FST-owned Panamanian corporation, Transcorp Services, owns the mortgage on the &quot;Freewinds&quot;. FSS Organization was a Netherlands Antilles corporation responsible for paying certain taxes on the vessel to the Netherlands Antilles authorities. Scientology courses are delivered aboard the vessel by the Flag Ship Service Organization (FSSO), in effect a floating branch of the Church of Scientology. Majestic Cruise Lines is a Panamanian corporation which operates the &quot;Freewinds&quot;, receiving payment from FSSO for the use of the ship. MCL Services is a corporation in the Netherlands Antilles that provides shore support and liaison services for Majestic Cruise Lines and FSSO from the home port of the &quot;Freewinds&quot;, Curaçao.

Following the Church of Scientology&#x27;s tax exemption agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in 1993, these arrangements were simplified. The responsibilities of the Majestic Cruise Lines were to be transferred to FSSO, with Majestic itself being dissolved, and FSS Organization being dissolved as it was no longer required for tax reporting purposes in the Netherlands Antilles. However, as of 1999 the Majestic company was continuing to bill visitors to the &quot;Freewinds&quot;.

&quot;Freewinds&quot; is the fifth ship to be owned by the Church of Scientology. The other four were (later &quot;Apollo&quot;), &quot;Enchanter&quot; (later &quot;Diana&quot;), &quot;Avon River&quot; (later &quot;Athena&quot;), and &quot;Nekambi&quot;, all of which have apparently been scrapped. However, the nameplate of &quot;Diana&quot; has been preserved and is on display aboard &quot;Freewinds&quot;. The church also operated two World War II surplus ships from the late 1960s until the early 1970s. These were &quot;Bolivar&quot;, a subchaser, and T.S.M.Y. &quot;Excalibur&quot;. Both of these vessels were docked at San Pedro, California, and were used for training new Sea Org members.

==Scientology use==
&quot;Freewinds&quot; is the exclusive training center for OT VIII (Operating Thetan Level 8), the highest level of Scientology and the last of the published OT levels. Members of the Church of Scientology who have reached the highest levels must receive their training on the &quot;Freewinds&quot;.

Besides the OT VIII training, &quot;Freewinds&quot; is used for delivering lower-level classes, auditing services, and recreational activities for Scientologists. The ship hosts a &quot;Freewinds Maiden Voyage&quot; each June as an &quot;OT Summit&quot; for high-ranking Scientologists at which Scientology accomplishments and plans for the future are celebrated.

A significant portion of the ship is given over to its use as a religious retreat for Scientologists. In addition to various course rooms and a library of L. Ron Hubbard books, &quot;Freewinds&quot; has areas given over to the Religious Technology Center, Sea Org and International Association of Scientologists. As is common practice in other Scientology organizations, the ship also has an &quot;LRH Office&quot; symbolically set aside for L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s use (Hubbard died in January 1986, approximately nine months before the vessel was purchased).

==Allegations of abuse onboard==
In 2011, former Sea Org member Valeska Paris reported that she had been imprisoned onboard &quot;Freewinds&quot; to prevent her from leaving Scientology, after joining at age 14. Once she was taken to the ship, expecting to be onboard two weeks, Paris said her passport was taken from her, after which she was held against her will, forced into manual labor for 12 years, and unable to leave the ship without an escort for six years.

Her story was corroborated by a former Sea Org member who said &quot;[Valeska] made it very clear she did not want to be there. She had been sent to the ship so as not to be in contact with one of her parents and that&#x27;s not what she wanted, she was very, very distressed.&quot; The Church of Scientology has denied the claims.

In 2022, Valeska Paris, along with Gawain Baxter and his wife Laura Baxter, filed a related lawsuit against the Church of the Scientology. On April 3, six weeks after the magistrate ruled Miscavige as served, US District Judge Tom Barber ruled that the plaintiffs must seek relief from Church arbitration and not the courts. Some of the plaintiffs&#x27; arguments were dismissed because ruling on them would require the courts to interpret religious doctrine, which is inconsistent with the First Amendment, said Barber.

==Environmental issues==
In April 2008, the &quot;Freewinds&quot; was shut down after blue asbestos was discovered by government health inspectors during maintenance by the Curaçao Drydock Company. Blue asbestos is the most dangerous form of asbestos, and the ship was reported to be &quot;extensively contaminated&quot;. According to InsuranceNewsNet, &quot;Decontamination, if it is even possible, is likely to cost tens of millions of dollars and would result in the ship being in dry dock for many months.&quot;

The discovery confirmed a 2001 allegation made by former Scientologist Lawrence Woodcraft, who had overseen the original renovation of the &quot;Freewinds&quot; in 1987. The Captain also admitted that during previous maintenance performed by his personnel, asbestos was released into the ventilation system but not reported.

The Church of Scientology denied that there is an asbestos problem, commenting in May 2008 that &quot;there is not now and never has been a situation of asbestos exposure on the Freewinds.&quot; Karin Pouw, spokesperson for the Church of Scientology, told &quot;Radar Magazine&quot; that the air quality on the ship was regularly tested and &quot;always meets or exceeds US standards&quot;. The Church contracted Nordica Engineering to perform renovations on the &quot;Freewinds&quot; and denied the presence of blue asbestos during talks. To remove material from the ship, Nordica brought in 240 Polish workers, who lived on the &quot;Freewinds&quot; for a month and a half. When workers told Nordica there was blue asbestos on the ship, they stopped renovations and workers returned to Poland. Witold Maliński stated that Nordica was looking to demand compensation on behalf of its workers.

The &quot;Freewinds&quot; has been noted in Bonaire for the amount of waste water it dumps into the island&#x27;s inland waste pit.

==2019 measles quarantine==
In May 2019, the &quot;Freewinds&quot; was placed in quarantine by the island of Saint Lucia during a visit, after a confirmed case of measles on board. Dr. Merlene Fredericks-James, Saint Lucia&#x27;s chief medical officer, said in a statement: &quot;Because of the risk of potential infection, not just from the confirmed measles case but from other persons who may be on the boat at the time, we thought it prudent to make a decision not to allow anyone to disembark.&quot;

The ship left Saint Lucia on 2 May en route to its home port of Curaçao. The measles case was identified as a female crew member.

==Design==

===Exterior design===
The exterior design of the &quot;Bohème/Freewinds&quot; is very similar to the &quot;Finnhansa&quot;-class ships built as ferries. She has a moderately raked and slightly rounded bow, rounded forward superstructure, terraced rear superstructure and two slim side-by-side funnels. She differs from her sisters with the superstructure expanding further on promenade deck (on the other ships it only extends as far as the bridge), swimming pool added to the rear of promenade deck, and the observation lounge missing from the topmost deck; this was replaced by an open sunbathing area.

As built the &quot;Bohème&quot; was painted in Wallenius Lines livery, with an all-white hull and superstructure, yellow radar mast and yellow funnels with a wide horizontal green stripe painted on them and the letters OW (for Olof Wallenius) painted on the stripe. The ship only kept this livery until her first visit to Miami, where she was repainted in the Commodore Cruise Line livery, with white funnels and radar mast. A dark blue decorative stripe was later painted on the hull. During the 1983 refit the livery of the &quot;Bohème&quot; was more radically altered, when blue stripes were painted along the windows on main and promenade decks, as well as the bridge windows. The funnels were re-painted with a spray-shaped design in blue, red and yellow.

Following acquisition by the Church of Scientology the ship&#x27;s external appearance was changed slightly from the final Commodore livery; the &quot;Freewinds&quot; received dark blue funnels with the Majestic Cruise Lines logo on them, while an intricate combination of Scientology-related symbols was painted on both sides of the hull (pictured on the right). Additionally three decorative ribands were painted on the side of the hull towards the rear.

===Interior design===
Members of the Wallenius family were heavily involved in the interior design of the &quot;Bohème&quot;. Margareta Wallenius in particular involved herself in the ship&#x27;s interior design, having her say in the materials used and works of art brought in from promising artists in Paris. Reflecting the company tradition of naming ships after operas, all public rooms on board were originally named after themes related to Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot;, the opera that had given the ship its name.

Her sister ships were built for ferry service, and cabins were built on &quot;Bohème&quot;&#x27;s planned car-decks on B- and C-decks. The car decks had in fact been originally planned to accommodate temporary cabin modules during the winter when Lion Ferry, the company that had originally ordered the &quot;Bohème&quot;, planned to use her for cruising to the Canary Isles. Additionally, a small gymnasium and cinema were added in place of the cargo hold on D-deck. All stairways and public rooms were panelled in light Nordic woods, while the deluxe cabins received dark oak panelings. During the 1983 refit, much of the original panelling was replaced by colourful paintings or mirrors to give an increased sense of space. Similarly, much of the upholstery and carpets were replaced with more cheerfully colored ones.
