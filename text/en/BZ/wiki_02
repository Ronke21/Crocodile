<text>Lowell Fulson (March 31, 1921March 7, 1999) was an American blues guitarist and songwriter, in the West Coast blues tradition. He also recorded for contractual reasons as Lowell Fullsom and Lowell Fulsom. After T-Bone Walker, he was the most important figure in West Coast blues in the 1940s and 1950s.

==Early life==
Fulson was born on a Choctaw reservation in Atoka, Oklahoma, to Mamie and Martin Fulson. He stated that he was of Cherokee ancestry through his father but also claimed Choctaw ancestry. His father was killed when Lowell was a child, and a few years later, he moved with his mother and brothers to live in Clarita and attended school at Coalgate.

==Career==
At the age of eighteen, he moved to Ada, Oklahoma, and joined Alger &quot;Texas&quot; Alexander for a few months in 1940, but later moved to California, where he formed a band which soon included a young Ray Charles and the tenor saxophone player Stanley Turrentine. Fulson was drafted in 1943 and served in the U.S. Navy until 1945.

Fulson recorded for Swing Time Records in the 1940s, Chess Records (on the Checker label) in the 1950s, Kent Records in the 1960s, and Rounder Records (on Bullseye Blues) in the 1980s/1990s. He wrote &quot;3 O&#x27;Clock Blues&quot; (B.B. King&#x27;s first hit), &quot;Reconsider Baby&quot; (a blues standard), and &quot;Tramp&quot; (co-written with Jimmy McCracklin and recorded by several artists). His 1965 song &quot;Black Nights&quot; was his first hit in a decade, and &quot;Tramp&quot; did even better, restoring him to R&amp;B stardom. In 1966 his brother Robert Fulson married former member of The Raelettes Margie Hendrix and they both started performing live with Lowell before they divorced in 1968.

A show entitled &quot;California Blues: Swingtime Tribute&quot; opened in 1993 at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, California, with Fulson, Johnny Otis, Charles Brown, Jay McShann, Jimmy Witherspoon, Jimmy McCracklin and Earl Brown. Fulson&#x27;s last recording was a duet of &quot;Every Day I Have the Blues&quot; with Jimmy Rogers on the latter&#x27;s 1999 Atlantic Records release, &quot;The Jimmy Rogers All-Stars: Blues, Blues, Blues&quot;.

==Death==
Fulson died in Long Beach, California, on March 7, 1999, at the age of 77. His companion, Tina Mayfield said that the causes of death were complications from kidney disease, diabetes, and congestive heart failure. He was the father of four and grandfather of thirteen. Fulson was interred in Inglewood Park Cemetery, in Inglewood, California.

<doc id="725067" wikidata="Q384295" url="?curid=725067" title="Gemfibrozil">
<text>Gemfibrozil, sold under the brand name Lopid among others, is a medication used to treat abnormal blood lipid levels. It is generally less preferred than statins. Use is recommended together with dietary changes and exercise. It is unclear if it changes the risk of heart disease. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include headache, dizziness, feeling tired, and intestinal upset. Serious side effects may include angioedema, gallstones, liver problems, and muscle breakdown. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It belongs to the fibrates group of medications and works by decreasing the breakdown of lipids in fat cells.
Gemfibrozil was patented in 1968, and came into medical use in 1982. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 231st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==
*Hyperlipidemia (Type III)
*Hypertriglyceridemia (Type IV): Gemfibrozil, though not as effective as niacin (nicotinic acid, a form of Vitamin B3), is better tolerated.
*Reduce triglyceride levels 
*Reduce very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels
*Modest reduction of low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels
*Moderate increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels

== Side effects ==
*GI distress
*Musculoskeletal pain
*Increased incidence of gallstone
*Hypokalemia (low blood potassium)
*Increased risk of cancer

== Contraindications ==
*Gemfibrozil should not be given to these patients:
**Hepatic dysfunction
*Gemfibrozil should be used with caution in these higher risk categories:
**Biliary tract disease
**Renal dysfunction
**Pregnant women
**Obese patients

== Drug interactions ==
*Anticoagulants: Gemfibrozil potentiates the action of warfarin and indanedione anticoagulants.
*Statin drugs: Concomitant administration of fibrates (including gemfibrozil) with statin drugs increases the risk of muscle cramping, myopathy, and rhabdomyolysis.
*Gemfibrozil inhibits the activation of the liver&#x27;s Cytochrome P450 system and CYP2C8, reducing hepatic metabolism of many drugs, and prolonging their half lives and duration of action.
** Drugs metabolized by the Cytochrome P450 system include:
*** Many antidepressants
*** Many antipsychotics
*** Many antiepileptics
*** Theophylline and other methylxanthine drugs
*** Several anesthetic agents
*** Oral contraceptive pills
*** Statins
*** Warfarin
*** Selexipag

== Mechanism of actions ==
The exact mechanism of action of gemfibrozil is unknown; however, several theories exist regarding the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) effect; it can inhibit lipolysis and decrease subsequent hepatic fatty acid uptake as well as inhibit hepatic secretion of VLDL; together these actions decrease serum VLDL levels and increase HDL-cholesterol; the mechanism behind HDL elevation is currently unknown.

Gemfibrozil increases the activity of extrahepatic lipoprotein lipase (LL), thereby increasing lipoprotein triglyceride lipolysis. It does so by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) &#x27;transcription factor ligand&#x27;, a receptor that is involved in metabolism of carbohydrates and fats, as well as adipose tissue differentiation. This increase in the synthesis of lipoprotein lipase thereby increases the clearance of triglycerides. Chylomicrons are degraded, VLDLs are converted to LDLs, and LDLs are converted to HDL. This is accompanied by a slight increase in secretion of lipids into the bile and ultimately the intestine. Gemfibrozil also inhibits the synthesis and increases the clearance of apolipoprotein B, a carrier molecule for VLDL.

== History ==
Gemfibrozil was selected from a series of related compounds synthesized in the laboratories of the American company Parke-Davis in the late 1970s. It came from research for compounds that lower plasma lipid levels in humans and in animals.

==Environmental data==
Gemfibrozil has been detected in biosolids (the solids remaining after sewage treatment) at concentrations up to 2650 ng/g wet weight. This indicates that it survives the wastewater treatment process. It is also detected as environmental persistent micropollutant in aquifers and in groundwaters in karstic areas.

<doc id="725069" wikidata="Q411159" url="?curid=725069" title="Famotidine">
<text>Famotidine, sold under the brand name Pepcid among others, is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist medication that decreases stomach acid production. It is used to treat peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. It is taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. It begins working within an hour.
Common side effects include headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include pneumonia and seizures. Use in pregnancy appears safe but has not been well studied, while use during breastfeeding is not recommended.
Famotidine was patented in 1979 and came into medical use in 1985. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 49th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==
*Heartburn, acid indigestion, and sour stomach
* Treatment for gastric and duodenal ulcers
* Treatment for pathologic gastrointestinal hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger–Ellison syndrome and multiple endocrine adenomas
* Treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
* Treatment for esophagitis
* Part of a multidrug regimen for &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; eradication, although omeprazole may be somewhat more effective.
* Prevention of NSAID-induced peptic ulcers.
* Given to surgery patients before operations to reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Famotidine has a delayed onset of action, beginning after 90 minutes. However, famotidine has a duration of effect of at least . At its peak effect, after administration, famotidine reduces acid secretion by 7.3 mmol per 30 minutes.

== Side effects ==
The most common side effects associated with famotidine use include headache, dizziness, and constipation or diarrhea.

Famotidine may contribute to QT prolongation, particularly when used with other QT-elongating drugs, or in people with poor kidney function.

==Mechanism of action==
Activation of H2 receptors located on parietal cells stimulates proton pumps to secrete acid into the stomach lumen. Famotidine, an H2 antagonist, blocks the action of histamine on the parietal cells, ultimately reducing acid secretion into the stomach.

== Interactions ==

Unlike cimetidine, the first H2 antagonist, famotidine has a minimal effect on the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and does not appear to interact with as many drugs as other medications in its class. Some exceptions include antiretrovirals such as atazanavir, chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin, and antifungal medications such as itraconazole. 

== History ==
Famotidine was developed by Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. It was licensed in the mid-1980s by Merck &amp; Co. and is marketed by a joint venture between Merck and Johnson &amp; Johnson. The imidazole ring of cimetidine was replaced with a 2-guanidinothiazole ring. Famotidine proved to be nine times more potent than ranitidine, and thirty-two times more potent than cimetidine.

It was first marketed in 1981. Pepcid RPD orally disintegrating tablets were released in 1999. Generic preparations became available in 2001, e.g. Fluxid (Schwarz) or Quamatel (Gedeon Richter Ltd.).

In the United States and Canada, a product called Pepcid Complete, which combines famotidine with an antacid in a chewable tablet to relieve the symptoms of excess stomach acid quickly, is available. In the UK, this product was known as PepcidTwo until its discontinuation in April 2015.

Famotidine has poor bioavailibility (50%) due to its low solubility in the high pH of the intestines. Researchers are developing formulations that use gastroretentive drug delivery systems such as floating tablets to increase bioavailability by promoting local delivery (directly into the stomach wall) of these drugs to receptors in the parietal cell membrane.

== Society and culture ==
Certain preparations of famotidine are available over-the-counter (OTC) in various countries. In the United States and Canada, 10 mg and 20 mg tablets, sometimes in combination with an antacid, are available OTC. Larger doses still require a prescription.

Formulations of famotidine in combination with ibuprofen were marketed by Horizon Pharma under the trade name Duexis.
== Research ==
===COVID-19===
At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, some doctors observed that anecdotally some hospitalized patients in China may have had better outcomes on famotidine than other patients who were not taking famotidine. This led to hypotheses about use of famotidine in treatment of COVID-19. Famotidine was considered a possible treatment for COVID-19 due to its potential anti-inflammatory effects. It was thought that famotidine could modify lung inflammation caused by coronaviruses. However, studies have shown that famotidine is not effective in reducing mortality or improving recovery in COVID-19 patients. Famotidine primarily works by blocking the effects of histamine and has some potential mechanisms of action that may contribute to its anti-inflammatory properties, including the inhibition of the production of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6. Another hypothesis was that famotidine might activate the vagus nerve inflammatory reflex to attenuate cytokine storm. Yet another hypothesis was that famotidine can reduce the activation of mast cells and the subsequent release of inflammatory mediators, therefore acting as a mast cell stabilizer. However, while famotidine may have some anti-inflammatory effects, there is currently insufficient evidence to support its use for treating inflammation associated with COVID-19. Therefore, it is not recommended for this purpose.

===Other===
Small-scale studies have shown inconsistent and inconclusive evidence of efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

== Veterinary uses ==
Famotidine is given to dogs and cats with acid reflux.

<text>In linguistics, word order (also known as linear order) is the order of the syntactic constituents of a language. Word order typology studies it from a cross-linguistic perspective, and examines how languages employ different orders. Correlations between orders found in different syntactic sub-domains are also of interest. The primary word orders that are of interest are

* the &quot;constituent order&quot; of a clause, namely the relative order of subject, object, and verb;
* the order of modifiers (adjectives, numerals, demonstratives, possessives, and adjuncts) in a noun phrase;
* the order of adverbials.

Some languages use relatively fixed word order, often relying on the order of constituents to convey grammatical information. Other languages—often those that convey grammatical information through inflection—allow more flexible word order, which can be used to encode pragmatic information, such as topicalisation or focus. However, even languages with flexible word order have a preferred or basic word order, with other word orders considered &quot;marked&quot;.

Constituent word order is defined in terms of a finite verb (V) in combination with two arguments, namely the subject (S), and object (O). Subject and object are here understood to be &quot;nouns&quot;, since pronouns often tend to display different word order properties. Thus, a transitive sentence has six logically possible basic word orders:

* about 45% of the world&#x27;s languages deploy subject–object–verb order (SOV);
* about 42% of the world&#x27;s languages deploy subject–verb–object order (SVO);
* a smaller fraction of languages deploy verb–subject–object (VSO) order;
* the remaining three arrangements are rarer: verb–object–subject (VOS) is slightly more common than object–verb–subject (OVS), and object–subject–verb (OSV) is the rarest by a significant margin.

==Constituent word orders==
These are all possible word orders for the subject, object, and verb in the order of most common to rarest (the examples use &quot;she&quot; as the subject, &quot;loves&quot; as the verb, and &quot;him&quot; as the object):
*SOV is the order used by the largest number of distinct languages; languages using it include Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Turkish, the Indo-Aryan languages and the Dravidian languages. Some, like Persian, Latin and Quechua, have SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) normal word order but conform less to the general tendencies of other such languages. A sentence glossing as &quot;She him loves&quot; would be grammatically correct in these languages.
*SVO languages include Arabic (dialects), English, Spanish, Portuguese, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbo-Croatian, the Chinese languages and Swahili, among others. &quot;She loves him.&quot;
*VSO languages include Ancient Egyptian, Biblical Hebrew, Classical Arabic, the Insular Celtic languages, Mayan, and the Philippine languages. &quot;Loves she him.&quot;
*VOS languages include Fijian and Malagasy. &quot;Loves him she.&quot;
*OVS languages include Hixkaryana. &quot;Him loves she.&quot;
*OSV languages include Xavante and Warao. &quot;Him she loves.&quot;

Sometimes patterns are more complex: some Germanic languages have SOV (Subject-Object-verb) in subordinate clauses, but V2 word order in main clauses, SVO word order being the most common. Using the guidelines above, the unmarked word order is then SVO.

Many synthetic languages such as Arabic, Latin, Greek, Persian, Romanian, Assyrian, Assamese, Russian, Turkish, Korean, Japanese, Finnish, and Basque have no strict word order; rather, the sentence structure is highly flexible and reflects the pragmatics of the utterance. However, also in languages of this kind there is usually a pragmatically neutral constituent order that is most commonly encountered in each language.

Topic-prominent languages organize sentences to emphasize their topic–comment structure. Nonetheless, there is often a preferred order; in Latin and Turkish, SOV is the most frequent outside of poetry, and in Finnish SVO is both the most frequent and obligatory when case marking fails to disambiguate argument roles. Just as languages may have different word orders in different contexts, so may they have both fixed and free word orders. For example, Russian has a relatively fixed SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) word order in transitive clauses, but a much freer SV / VS order in intransitive clauses. Cases like this can be addressed by encoding transitive and intransitive clauses separately, with the symbol &quot;S&quot; being restricted to the argument of an intransitive clause, and &quot;A&quot; for the actor/agent of a transitive clause. (&quot;O&quot; for object may be replaced with &quot;P&quot; for &quot;patient&quot; as well.) Thus, Russian is fixed AVO (Absolutive-Verb-Object) but flexible SV/VS. In such an approach, the description of word order extends more easily to languages that do not meet the criteria in the preceding section. For example, Mayan languages have been described with the rather uncommon VOS word order. However, they are ergative–absolutive languages, and the more specific word order is intransitive VS, transitive VOA (Verb-Object-Absolutive), where the S and O arguments both trigger the same type of agreement on the verb. Indeed, many languages that some thought had a VOS (Verb-Object-Subject) word order turn out to be ergative like Mayan.

== Distribution of word order types ==
Every language falls under one of the six word order types; the unfixed type is somewhat disputed in the community, as the languages where it occurs have one of the dominant word orders but every word order type is grammatically correct.

The table below displays the word order surveyed by Dryer. The 2005 study surveyed 1228 languages, and the updated 2013 study investigated 1377 languages. Percentage was not reported in his studies.
Hammarström (2016) calculated the constituent orders of 5252 languages in two ways. His first method, counting languages directly, yielded results similar to Dryer&#x27;s studies, indicating both SOV and SVO have almost equal distribution. However, when stratified by language families, the distribution showed that the majority of the families had SOV structure, meaning that a small number of families contain SVO structure.

== Functions of constituent word order ==
Fixed word order is one out of many ways to ease the processing of sentence semantics and reducing ambiguity. One method of making the speech stream less open to ambiguity (complete removal of ambiguity is probably impossible) is a fixed order of arguments and other sentence constituents. This works because speech is inherently linear. Another method is to label the constituents in some way, for example with case marking, agreement, or another marker. Fixed word order reduces expressiveness but added marking increases information load in the speech stream, and for these reasons strict word order seldom occurs together with strict morphological marking, one counter-example being Persian.

Observing discourse patterns, it is found that previously given information (topic) tends to precede new information (comment). Furthermore, acting participants (especially humans) are more likely to be talked about (to be topic) than things simply undergoing actions (like oranges being eaten). If acting participants are often topical, and topic tends to be expressed early in the sentence, this entails that acting participants have a tendency to be expressed early in the sentence. This tendency can then grammaticalize to a privileged position in the sentence, the subject.

The mentioned functions of word order can be seen to affect the frequencies of the various word order patterns: The vast majority of languages have an order in which S precedes O and V. Whether V precedes O or O precedes V, however, has been shown to be a very telling difference with wide consequences on phrasal word orders.

== Semantics of word order ==

In many languages, standard word order can be subverted in order to form questions or as a means of emphasis. In languages such as O&#x27;odham and Hungarian, which are discussed below, almost all possible permutations of a sentence are grammatical, but not all of them are used. In languages such as English and German, word order is used as a means of turning declarative into interrogative sentences:

A: &#x27;Wen liebt Kate?&#x27; / &#x27;Kate liebt &quot;wen&quot;?&#x27; [Whom does Kate love? / Kate loves &quot;whom&quot;?] (OVS/SVO)

B: &#x27;Sie liebt Mark&#x27; / &#x27;Mark ist der, den sie liebt&#x27; [She loves Mark / It is &quot;Mark&quot; whom she loves.] (SVO/OSV)

C: &#x27;Liebt Kate Mark?&#x27; [Does Kate love Mark?] (VSO)

In (A), the first sentence shows the word order used for wh-questions in English and German. The second sentence is an echo question; it would be uttered only after receiving an unsatisfactory or confusing answer to a question. One could replace the word &quot;wen&quot; [whom] (which indicates that this sentence is a question) with an identifier such as &quot;Mark&quot;: &#x27;Kate liebt &quot;Mark&quot;?&#x27; [Kate loves &quot;Mark&quot;?]. In that case, since no change in word order occurs, it is only by means of stress and tone that we are able to identify the sentence as a question.

In (B), the first sentence is declarative and provides an answer to the first question in (A). The second sentence emphasizes that Kate does indeed love &quot;Mark&quot;, and not whomever else we might have assumed her to love. However, a sentence this verbose is unlikely to occur in everyday speech (or even in written language), be it in English or in German. Instead, one would most likely answer the echo question in (A) simply by restating: &quot;Mark!&quot;. This is the same for both languages.

In yes–no questions such as (C), English and German use subject-verb inversion. But, whereas English relies on do-support to form questions from verbs other than auxiliaries, German has no such restriction and uses inversion to form questions, even from lexical verbs.

Despite this, English, as opposed to German, has very strict word order. In German, word order can be used as a means to emphasize a constituent in an independent clause by moving it to the beginning of the sentence. This is a defining characteristic of German as a V2 (verb-second) language, where, in independent clauses, the finite verb always comes second and is preceded by one and only one constituent. In closed questions, V1 (verb-first) word order is used. And lastly, dependent clauses use verb-final word order. However, German cannot be called an SVO language since no actual constraints are imposed on the placement of the subject and object(s), even though a preference for a certain word-order over others can be observed (such as putting the subject after the finite verb in independent clauses unless it already precedes the verb).

==Phrase word orders and branching==
The order of constituents in a phrase can vary as much as the order of constituents in a clause. Normally, the noun phrase and the adpositional phrase are investigated. Within the noun phrase, one investigates whether the following modifiers occur before and/or after the head noun.

* adjective (&quot;red house&quot; vs &quot;house red&quot;)
* determiner (&quot;this house&quot; vs &quot;house this&quot;)
* numeral (&quot;two houses&quot; vs &quot;houses two&quot;)
* possessor (&quot;my house&quot; vs &quot;house my&quot;)
* relative clause (&quot;the by me built house&quot; vs &quot;the house built by me&quot;)

Within the adpositional clause, one investigates whether the languages makes use of prepositions (&quot;in London&quot;), postpositions (&quot;London in&quot;), or both (normally with different adpositions at both sides) either separately (&quot;For whom?&quot; or &quot;Whom for?&quot;) or at the same time (&quot;from her away&quot;; Dutch example: &quot;met hem mee&quot; meaning &quot;together with him&quot;).

There are several common correlations between sentence-level word order and phrase-level constituent order. For example, SOV languages generally put modifiers before heads and use postpositions. VSO languages tend to place modifiers after their heads, and use prepositions. For SVO languages, either order is common.

For example, French (SVO) uses prepositions &quot;(dans la voiture, à gauche),&quot; and places adjectives after &quot;(une voiture spacieuse).&quot; However, a small class of adjectives generally go before their heads &quot;(une grande voiture)&quot;. On the other hand, in English (also SVO) adjectives almost always go before nouns &quot;(a big car),&quot; and adverbs can go either way, but initially is more common &quot;(greatly improved).&quot; (English has a very small number of adjectives that go after the heads, such as &quot;&quot;, which kept its position when borrowed from French.) Russian places numerals after nouns to express approximation (шесть домов=&quot;six houses&quot;, домов шесть=&quot;circa six houses&quot;).

==Pragmatic word order==
Some languages do not have a fixed word order and often use a significant amount of morphological marking to disambiguate the roles of the arguments. However, the degree of marking alone does not indicate whether a language uses a fixed or free word order: some languages may use a fixed order even when they provide a high degree of marking, while others (such as some varieties of Datooga) may combine a free order with a lack of morphological distinction between arguments.

Typologically, there is a trend that high-animacy actors are more likely to be topical than low-animacy undergoers; this trend can come through even in languages with free word order, giving a statistical bias for SO order (or OS order in ergative systems; however, ergative systems do not always extend to the highest levels of animacy, sometimes giving way to an accusative system (see split ergativity).

Most languages with a high degree of morphological marking have rather flexible word orders, such as Polish, Hungarian, Spanish, Latin, Albanian, and O&#x27;odham. In some languages, a general word order can be identified, but this is much harder in others. When the word order is free, different choices of word order can be used to help identify the theme and the rheme.

===Hungarian===
Word order in Hungarian sentences can change according to the speaker&#x27;s communicative intentions. Hungarian word order is not free in the sense that it must reflect the information structure of the sentence, distinguishing the emphatic part that carries new information (rheme) from the rest of the sentence that carries little or no new information (theme).

The position of focus in a Hungarian sentence is immediately before the verb, that is, nothing can separate the emphatic part of the sentence from the verb.

For &quot;Kate ate &quot;a piece of cake&quot;&quot;, the possibilities are:

# &quot;Kati megevett &quot;egy szelet tortát&quot;.&quot; (same word order as English) [&quot;Kate ate &quot;a piece of cake.&quot;]
# &quot;Egy szelet tortát&quot; Kati evett meg.&quot; (emphasis on agent [Kate]) [&quot;&quot;A piece of cake&quot; Kate ate.&quot;] (&quot;One of the pieces of cake was eaten by Kate.&quot;)
# &quot;Kati evett meg &quot;egy szelet tortát&quot;.&quot; (also emphasis on agent [Kate]) [&quot;Kate ate &quot;a piece of cake.&quot;&quot;] (&quot;Kate was the one eating one piece of cake.&quot;)
# &quot;Kati &quot;egy szelet tortát&quot; evett meg.&quot; (emphasis on object [cake]) [&quot;Kate &quot;a piece of cake&quot; ate.&quot;] (&quot;Kate ate a piece of cake &quot; – cf. not a piece of bread.)
# &quot;&quot;Egy szelet tortát&quot; evett meg Kati.&quot; (emphasis on number [a piece, i.e. only one piece]) [&quot;&quot;A piece of cake&quot; ate Kate.&quot;] (&quot;Only one piece of cake was eaten by Kate.&quot;)
# &quot;Megevett &quot;egy szelet tortát&quot; Kati.&quot; (emphasis on completeness of action) [&quot;Ate &quot;a piece of cake&quot; Kate.&quot;] (&quot;A piece of cake had been finished by Kate.&quot;)
# &quot;Megevett Kati &quot;egy szelet tortát&quot;.&quot; (emphasis on completeness of action) [&quot;Ate Kate &quot;a piece of cake.&quot;&quot;] (&quot;Kate finished with a piece of cake.&quot;)

The only freedom in Hungarian word order is that the order of parts outside the focus position and the verb may be freely changed without any change to the communicative focus of the sentence, as seen in sentences 2 and 3 as well as in sentences 6 and 7 above. These pairs of sentences have the same information structure, expressing the same communicative intention of the speaker, because the part immediately preceding the verb is left unchanged.

The emphasis can be on the action (verb) itself, as seen in sentences 1, 6 and 7, or it can be on parts other than the action (verb), as seen in sentences 2, 3, 4 and 5. If the emphasis is not on the verb, and the verb has a co-verb (in the above example &#x27;meg&#x27;), then the co-verb is separated from the verb, and always follows the verb. Also the enclitic &quot;-t&quot; marks the direct object: &#x27;torta&#x27; (cake) + &#x27;-t&#x27; -&gt; &#x27;tortát&#x27;.

=== Hindi-Urdu ===

Hindi-Urdu (Hindustani) is essentially a verb-final (SOV) language, with relatively free word order since in most cases postpositions explicitly mark the relationships of noun phrases to the other sentence constituents. Word order in Hindustani does not usually encode grammatical functions. Constituents can be scrambled to express different information structural configurations, or for stylistic reasons. The first syntactic constituent in a sentence is usually the topic, which may under certain conditions be marked by the particle &quot;to&quot; (तो / تو), similar in some respects to Japanese topic marker は &quot;(wa).&quot; Some rules governing the position of words in a sentence are as follows:

* An adjective comes before the noun it modifies in its unmarked position. However, the possessive and reflexive pronominal adjectives can occur either to the left or to the right of the noun it describes.
* Negation must come either to the left or to the right of the verb it negates. For compound verbs or verbal construction using auxiliaries the negation can occur either to the left of the first verb, in-between the verbs or to the right of the second verb (the default position being to the left of the main verb when used with auxiliary and in-between the primary and the secondary verb when forming a compound verb).
* Adverbs usually precede the adjectives they qualify in their unmarked position, but when adverbs are constructed using the instrumental case postposition se (से /سے) (which qualifies verbs), their position in the sentence becomes free. However, since both the instrumental and the ablative case are marked by the same postposition &quot;se&quot; (से /سے), when both are present in a sentence then the quantity they modify cannot appear adjacent to each other.
* &quot;kyā &quot; (क्या / کیا) &quot;what&quot; as the yes–no question marker occurs at the beginning or the end of a clause as its unmarked positions but it can be put anywhere in the sentence except the preverbal position, where instead it is interpreted as interrogative &quot;what&quot;.
Some of all the possible word order permutations of the sentence &quot;The girl received a gift from the boy &quot;on her birthday&quot;.&quot; are shown below. 
=== Portuguese ===
In Portuguese, clitic pronouns and commas allow many different orders:

* &quot;Eu vou entregar a você amanhã.&quot; [&quot;I will deliver to you tomorrow.&quot;] (same word order as English)
*&quot;&quot;&quot;Entregarei a você amanhã.&quot; [&quot;{I} will deliver to you tomorrow.&quot;]
* &quot;Eu lhe entregarei amanhã.&quot; [&quot;I to you will deliver tomorrow.&quot;]
* &quot;Entregar-lhe-ei amanhã.&quot; [&quot;Deliver to you {I} will tomorrow.&quot;] (mesoclisis)
* &quot;A ti, eu entregarei amanhã.&quot; [&quot;To you I will deliver tomorrow.&quot;]
* &quot;A ti, entregarei amanhã.&quot; [&quot;To you {I} deliver will tomorrow.&quot;]
* &quot;Amanhã, entregar-te-ei&quot; [&quot;Tomorrow {I} will deliver to you&quot;]
* &quot;Poderia entregar, eu, a você amanhã?&quot; [&quot;Could deliver I to you tomorrow?]

Braces (&quot;{ }&quot;) are used above to indicate omitted subject pronouns, which may be implicit in Portuguese. Because of conjugation, the grammatical person is recovered.

=== Latin ===

In Classical Latin, the endings of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and pronouns allow for extremely flexible order in most situations. Latin lacks articles.

The subject, verb, and object can come in any order in a Latin sentence, although most often (especially in subordinate clauses) the verb comes last. Pragmatic factors, such as topic and focus, play a large part in determining the order. Thus the following sentences each answer a different question:

*&quot;Romulus Romam condidit.&quot; [&quot;Romulus founded Rome&quot;] (What did Romulus do?)
*&quot;Hanc urbem condidit Romulus.&quot; [&quot;Romulus founded this city&quot;] (Who founded this city?)
*&quot;Condidit Romam Romulus.&quot; [&quot;Romulus founded Rome&quot;] (What happened?)

Latin prose often follows the word order &quot;Subject, Direct Object, Indirect Object, Adverb, Verb&quot;, but this is more of a guideline than a rule. Adjectives in most cases go before the noun they modify, but some categories, such as those that determine or specify (e.g. &quot;Via Appia&quot; &quot;Appian Way&quot;), usually follow the noun. In Classical Latin poetry, lyricists followed word order very loosely to achieve a desired scansion.

=== Albanian ===
Due to the presence of grammatical cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, and in some cases or dialects vocative and locative) applied to nouns, pronouns and adjectives, Albanian permits a large variety of word order combinations. In the spoken language, an alternative word order to the most common S-V-O helps the speaker to emphasise a word and hence make a nuanced change to the meaning. For example:
* &quot;&quot; [&quot;Mark (me) gave a present to me.&quot;] (neutral narrating sentence.)
* &quot;&quot; [&quot;Mark to me (me) gave a present.&quot;] (emphasis on the indirect object, probably to compare the result of the verb on different persons.)
* &quot;&quot; [&quot;Mark a present (me) gave to me&quot;] (meaning that Mark gave her only a present, and not something else or more presents.)
* &quot;&quot; [&quot;Mark a present to me (me) gave&quot;] (meaning that Mark gave a present only to her.)
* &quot;&quot; [&quot;Gave Mark to me a present.&quot;] (neutral sentence, but puts less emphasis on the subject.)
* &quot;&quot; [&quot;Gave a present to me Mark.&quot;] (probably is the cause of an event being introduced later.)
* &quot;&quot; [&quot;Gave to me Mark a present.&quot;] (same as above.)
* &quot;&quot; [&quot;(Me) gave a present to me Mark.&quot;] (puts emphasis on the fact that the receiver is her and not someone else.)
* &quot;&quot; [&quot;A present gave Mark to me.&quot;] (meaning it was a present and not something else.)
* &quot;&quot; [&quot;A present Mark gave to me.&quot;] (puts emphasis on the fact that she got the present and someone else got something different.)
* &quot;&quot; [&quot;A present to me gave Mark.&quot;] (no particular emphasis, but can be used to list different actions from different subjects.)
* &quot;&quot; [&quot;A present to me Mark (me) gave&quot;] (remembers that at least a present was given to her by Mark.)
* &quot;&quot; [&quot;To me (me) gave Mark a present.&quot; (is used when Mark gave something else to others.)
* &quot;&quot; [&quot;To me a present (me) gave Mark.&quot;] (emphasis on &quot;to me&quot; and the fact that it was a present, only one present or it was something different from usual.)
* &quot;&quot; [&quot;To me Mark a present (me) gave.&quot;] (Mark gave her only one present.)
* &quot;&quot; [&quot;To me Mark (me) gave a present.&quot;] (puts emphasis on Mark. Probably the others did not give her present, they gave something else or the present was not expected at all.)

In these examples, &quot; can be omitted when not in first position, causing a perceivable change in emphasis; the latter being of different intensity. &quot; is always followed by the verb. Thus, a sentence consisting of a subject, a verb and two objects (a direct and an indirect one), can be
expressed in six ways without &quot;, and in twenty-four ways with &quot;, adding up to thirty possible combinations.

=== O&#x27;odham (Papago-Pima) ===

O&#x27;odham is a language that is spoken in southern Arizona and Northern Sonora, Mexico. It has free word order, with only the auxiliary bound to one spot. Here is an example in literal translation:

* &quot;Wakial &#x27;o g wipsilo ha-cecposid.&quot; [Cowboy is the calves them branding.] (The cowboy is branding the calves.)
*&quot;Wipsilo &#x27;o ha-cecposid g wakial.&quot; [Calves is them branding the cowboy.] 
*&quot;Ha-cecposid &#x27;o g wakial g wipsilo.&quot; [Them branding is the cowboy the calves.] 
*&quot;Wipsilo &#x27;o g wakial ha-cecposid.&quot; [Calves is the cowboy them branding.] 
*&quot;Ha-cecposid &#x27;o g wipsilo g wakial.&quot; [Them branding is the calves the cowboy.] 
*&quot;Wakial &#x27;o ha-cecposid g wipsilo.&quot; [Cowboy is them branding the calves.]

Those examples are all grammatically valid variations on the sentence &quot;The cowboy is branding the calves,&quot; but some are rarely found in natural speech, as is discussed in Grammaticality.

== Other issues with word order ==

=== Language change ===
Languages change over time. When language change involves a shift in a language&#x27;s syntax, this is called syntactic change. An example of this is found in Old English, which at one point had flexible word order, before losing it over the course of its evolution. In Old English, both of the following sentences would be considered grammatically correct:

* &quot;Martianus hæfde his sunu ær befæst&quot; [Martianus had his son earlier established] (Martianus had earlier established his son.)
* &quot;gif heo þæt bysmor forberan wolde&quot; [if she that disgrace tolerate would] (if she would tolerate that disgrace.)

This flexibility continues into early Middle English, where it seems to drop out of usage. Shakespeare&#x27;s plays use OV word order frequently, as can be seen from this example:

* &quot;It was our selfe thou didst abuse.&quot;

A modern speaker of English would possibly recognise this as a grammatically comprehensible sentence, but nonetheless archaic. There are some verbs, however, that are entirely acceptable in this format:

* &quot;Are they good?&quot;

This is acceptable to a modern English speaker and is not considered archaic. This is due to the verb &quot;to be&quot;, which acts as both auxiliary and main verb. Similarly, other auxiliary and modal verbs allow for VSO word order (&quot;Must he perish?&quot;). Non-auxiliary and non-modal verbs require insertion of an auxiliary to conform to modern usage (&quot;Did he buy the book?&quot;). Shakespeare&#x27;s usage of word order is not indicative of English at the time, which had dropped OV order at least a century before.

This variation between archaic and modern can also be shown in the change between VSO to SVO in Coptic, the language of the Christian Church in Egypt.

=== Dialectal variation ===
There are some languages which have different preferred word orders in different dialects. One such case is Andean Spanish, spoken in Peru. While Spanish is classified as an SVO language, Peruvian Spanish has been influenced by Quechua and Aymara, both SOV languages. This has led to some first-language (L1) Spanish speakers using OV word order in more sentences than would be expected. L2 speakers in Peru also use this word order.

=== Poetry ===
Poetry and stories can use different word orders to emphasize certain aspects of the sentence. In English, this is called anastrophe. Here is an example:

&quot;Kate loves Mark.&quot;

&quot;Mark Kate loves.&quot;

Here SVO is changed to OSV to emphasize the object.

=== Translation ===
Differences in word order complicate translation and language education – in addition to changing individual words, the order must be changed. The area of linguistics that is concerned with translation and education is language acquisition. The reordering of words can cause problems when transcribing stories. Rhyme schemes can change, as well as the meaning behind the words. This can be especially problematic when translating poetry.

<doc id="725082" wikidata="Q278158" url="?curid=725082" title="Diverticulosis">
<text>Diverticulosis is the condition of having multiple pouches (diverticula) in the colon that are not inflamed. These are outpockets of the colonic mucosa and submucosa through weaknesses of muscle layers in the colon wall. Diverticula do not cause symptoms in most people. Diverticular disease occurs when diverticula become clinically inflamed, a condition known as diverticulitis.
Diverticula typically occur in the sigmoid colon, which is commonplace for increased pressure. The left side of the colon is more commonly affected in the United States while the right side is more commonly affected in Asia. Diagnosis is often during routine colonoscopy or as an incidental finding during CT scan.
It is common in Western countries with about half of those over the age of 60 affected in Canada and the United States. Diverticula are uncommon before the age of 40, and increase in incidence beyond that age. Rates are lower in Africa; the reasons for this remain unclear but may involve the greater prevalence of a high fiber diet in contrast with the lower-fiber diet characteristic of many Western populations.

==Signs and symptoms==

Some people with diverticulosis complain of symptoms such as cramping, bloating, flatulence, and irregular defecation. However, it is unclear if these symptoms are attributable to the underlying diverticulosis or to coexistent irritable bowel syndrome.

Diverticular disease was found associated with a higher risk of left sided colon cancer.

===Bleeding===
Diverticular disease can present with painless rectal bleeding as bright red blood per rectum. Diverticular bleeding is the most common cause of acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding. However, it is estimated that 80% of these cases are self-limiting and require no specific therapy.

===Diverticulitis===

Infection of a diverticulum can result in diverticulitis. A 2013 study found that it happens only about 4% of the time. That contradicts the prevailing thinking that 10% to 25% of people with diverticulosis go on to develop diverticulitis. Tears in the colon leading to bleeding or perforations may occur; intestinal obstruction may occur (constipation or diarrhea does not rule this possibility out); and peritonitis, abscess formation, retroperitoneal fibrosis, sepsis, and fistula formation are also possible occurrences. Rarely, an enterolith may form. Infection of a diverticulum often occurs as a result of stool collecting in a diverticulum.

Diverticulitis is defined as diverticular disease with signs and symptoms of diverticular inflammation. Clinical features of acute diverticulitis include constant abdominal pain, localized abdominal tenderness in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, fever and leukocytosis.

Most people with colonic diverticulosis are unaware of this structural change. When symptoms do appear in a person over 40 years of age it is important to obtain medical advice and exclude more dangerous conditions such as cancer of the colon or rectum.

===Segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis===

Segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis (SCAD) is a condition characterized by localized inflammation of the colon between diverticula (interdiverticular mucosa) while sparing the diverticular orifices. SCAD may lead to abdominal pain, especially in the left lower quadrant, intermittent rectal bleeding, and chronic diarrhea.

==Causes==
===Diet===
The U.S. National Institutes of Health notes that, although the low-fiber theory of the cause of diverticulosis is the leading theory, it has not yet been proven.

===Genetics===
The predisposition to diverticulosis for specific individuals is likely explained by a genetic component, a theory that is supported by studies examining the rates of diverticulosis among twins. The heritability of diverticulosis is estimated to be approximately 40%.

===Intestinal motility===
Another theory suggests the degeneration of glial neurons in the myenteric plexus and the interstitial cells of Cajal lead to slowed intestinal movement and consequently fecal content exerts increased pressure on the colon wall resulting in the formation of diverticula.

===Risk factors===
# Advanced age
# constipation
# a diet that is low in dietary fiber (although this claim is controversial)
# connective tissue disorders (such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome) that may cause weakness in the colon wall
# hereditary or genetic predisposition,
# extreme weight loss
# heavy meat consumption

==Pathophysiology==

The precise mechanisms by which diverticula are formed are unknown. Multiple theories have been proposed including genetic susceptibility, diet, intestinal motility, changes in the microbiome, and inflammation. One leading theory suggests that diverticula form in weakened areas of the colon wall that are subjected to increased pressure. The strength of the colon wall is known to decrease with age. Previous theories proposed that impacted fecal matter and certain foods would get stuck in diverticula (thereby causing trauma), which caused poor blood flow, death of the affected intestinal wall cells, and intestinal perforation. Newer theories have called this paradigm into question.

==Diagnosis==

Diverticulosis is defined by the presence of multiple pouches (diverticula) in the colon. In people without symptoms, these are usually found incidentally during other investigations.

While a good history is often sufficient to form a diagnosis of diverticulosis or diverticulitis, it is important to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathology (notably colorectal cancer) and complications.

===Imaging===
* Barium enema is inferior to colonoscopy in terms of image quality and is usually only performed if the patient has strictures or an excessively tortuous sigmoid colon where colonoscopy is difficult or dangerous.
* Colonoscopy will show the diverticulum and rule out malignancy. A colonoscopy should be performed 4–6 weeks after an acute episode.
* Contrast CT is the investigation of choice in acute episodes of diverticulitis and where complications exist.
* MRI provides a clear picture of the soft tissue of the abdomen, however, its expense often outweighs the benefits when compared to contrast CT or colonoscopy.
* Plain abdominal X-ray may show signs of a thickened wall, ileus, constipation, small bowel obstruction or free air in the case of perforation. Plain X-rays are insufficient to diagnose diverticular disease.
* There is no blood test for diverticulosis.

It is important to note that both barium enema and colonoscopy are contraindicated during acute episodes of diverticulitis, as the barium may leak out into the abdominal cavity, and colonoscopy can cause perforations of the bowel wall.

==Management==
Many people with diverticulosis have minimal to no symptoms and do not require any specific treatment. Colonic stimulants should be avoided. Treatments, like some colon cleansers, that cause hard stools, constipation, and straining, are not recommended.

===Diet===
A high-fiber diet and fiber supplements are advisable to prevent constipation. The American Dietetic Association recommends 20–35 grams each day. Wheat bran has been shown to reduce intra colonic pressure.

The US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) says foods such as nuts, popcorn hulls, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, caraway seeds, and sesame seeds have traditionally been labeled as problem foods for people with this condition; however, no scientific data exists to prove this hypothesis. The seeds in tomatoes, zucchini, cucumbers, strawberries, raspberries, and poppy seeds, are not considered harmful by the NIDDK.

One study found that nuts and popcorn do not contribute positively or negatively to patients with diverticulosis or diverticular complications.

===Complications===
Complicated diverticulosis requires treatment of the complication. These complications are often grouped under a single diagnosis of diverticulitis and require skilled medical care of the infection, bleeding and perforation which may include intensive antibiotic treatment, intravenous fluids, and surgery. Complications are more common in patients who are taking NSAIDs or aspirin. As diverticulosis occurs in an older population such complications are serious events.

== Epidemiology ==
The prevalence of diverticulosis progressively increases with age. Approximately 50% of people over the age of 60 and 70% of people over the age of 80 have diverticulosis. This disease is common in the U.S., Britain, Australia, Canada, and is uncommon in Asia and Africa. Large-mouth diverticula are associated with scleroderma. Diverticular disease is more common in collagen disorders such as Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.

==History==
The modern emphasis on the value of fiber in the diet began with Thomas L. Cleave. A strong case was made by Neil Painter and Adam Smith that a deficiency of dietary fiber is the cause of diverticular disease. They argued that the colonic muscles needed to contract strongly in order to transmit and expel the small stool associated with a fiber deficient diet. The increased pressure within the segmented section of the bowel over years gave rise to herniation at the vulnerable point where blood vessels enter the colonic wall.

==Society and culture==
===Economics===
&quot;The complications of diverticulosis cause considerable morbidity in the United States; health care expenditures for this disorder are estimated to be $2.5 billion per year.&quot;

<text>This is a list of ambassadors of Canada to the United States, formally titled as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the United States of America for His [Her] Majesty&#x27;s Government in Canada. Originally, Canada&#x27;s top diplomatic representative to the U.S. had the rank of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. The title was promoted to the rank of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary in 1943, during the period when Leighton McCarthy had the post.

Before November 25, 1926, Canada was represented in Washington D.C. by the British ambassador to the United States. 

Most Canadian ambassadors to the United States have been political appointees to the position. A few (Chrétien, Pearson, Charles Ritchie, Edgar Ritchie, Kirsten Hillman, and Wrong) were career diplomats or spent most of their career at the Department of External Affairs (or its successors).

<doc id="725089" wikidata="Q7005720" url="?curid=725089" title="New Britain Party">
<text>New Britain was a minor British right-wing political party founded by Dennis Delderfield in 1976. The party was de-registered in November 2008.

==Founding==
It was led from its creation by Dennis Delderfield, a former Common Councilman of the City of London and editor of the &quot;City of London &amp; Dockland Times&quot;. In 1980, the party absorbed the anti-immigration United Country Party, which had been chaired by TV astronomer Patrick Moore. Around this time it also absorbed a small anti-devolution group called the Keep Britain United Party. This party had contested a single seat (Carmarthen) in the 1979 general election.

==Positions==
New Britain was described as an &quot;avowedly racist party&quot; by &quot;The Observer&quot;. It campaigned for the return of capital punishment, and was supported by the Christian Affirmation Campaign, a right-wing traditionalist movement opposed to what it saw as the World Council of Churches&#x27; support for Communist regimes in Africa. Delderfield signed a letter in 2000 that argued that &quot;suburb after suburb and town after town across the land have been taken over by Asians, Africans and Afro-Caribbeans... In the not too distant future they will have direct control in many areas.&quot;

==Electoral history==
The party became active participants in by-elections, contesting those held in City of London and Westminster, Beaconsfield, Penrith and the Border and Bermondsey, as well as putting up two candidates in the general elections of 1979 and 1983. Its best performance was at the Bournemouth East by-election of November 1977, but the party&#x27;s candidate in the Ilford North by-election of March 1978 was revealed to be a convicted child abuser after nominations had closed, and his endorsement was withdrawn.

In the 1994 European Parliament election, the last to be held under first-past-the-post, it achieved moderate success, saving its deposit in one seat and nearly doing so in another.

In the 2010 general election, former chairman Dennis Delderfield stood as an independent candidate in the Cities of London and Westminster Parliamentary constituency, from the contact address listed on the New Britain website.
==Membership==
Some former members later joined the United Kingdom Independence Party, including Mike Nattrass, later a Member of the European Parliament for UKIP, who stood as New Britain candidate in the Dudley West by-election of 1994, gaining 146 votes. His fellow UKIP MEP Jeffrey Titford was also a briefly a member after the Referendum Party folded. Another UKIP candidate, Brian Smalley, joined in 1994 and was a member of the national committee.

<text>Seth Shostak (born July 20, 1943) is an American astronomer and author, and is currently the senior astronomer for the SETI Institute.

Shostak hosts SETI&#x27;s weekly radio show/podcast &quot;Big Picture Science&quot;, has played himself numerous times in TV and internet film dramas, and has acted in several science fiction films.

==Early life and education==
Seth Shostak was born in a Jewish family in Arlington County, Virginia, the son of Arthur and Bertha Shostak (née Gortenburg); his father was an electrical engineer. He earned his BS in physics from Princeton University and a PhD in astrophysics from the California Institute of Technology.

== Professional work==
Shostak used radio telescopes in the US and the Netherlands, searching for clues to the ultimate fate of the universe by analyzing galaxy motion. In 1999, he produced twelve 30-minute lectures on audio-tape and video titled &quot;The Search for Intelligent Life in Space&quot; for The Teaching Company. An updated overview about the search for extraterrestrial life was presented in 2019.

=== SETI Institute===
Since 2001, he has been the senior astronomer at the SETI Institute, a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to &quot;explore, understand and explain the origin, nature and prevalence of life in the universe&quot;. SETI Institute, located in Mountain View, California, employs over 50 researchers that study all aspects of the search for life, its origins, the environment in which life develops, and its ultimate fate.

He was the chair of the International Academy of Astronautics SETI Permanent Committee from 2003-2012.

== Public outreach==

Shostak is an active participant in the Institute&#x27;s observation programs and has been hosting SETI&#x27;s weekly radio show &quot;Big Picture Science&quot; since 2002. Each week, Shostak interviews guests about the latest scientific research on a variety of topics: cosmology, physics, genetics, paleontology, evolutionary biology and astrobiology. &quot;Big Picture Science&quot; is distributed on the Public Radio Satellite System and the Public Radio Exchange and is available for download at the SETI Institute&#x27;s website and through podcasts.

Shostak also hosts the monthly &quot;Skeptic Check&quot; episodes of Big Picture Science, focused on debunking pseudoscience, UFOs and practices such as astrology and dowsing.

He has published four books, nearly 300 popular articles on astronomy, technology, film and television and gives frequent talks to both young and adult audiences.

==Filmography==
===Television / web series===
==Recognition==
Shostak was the 2004 winner of the Klumpke-Roberts Award of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the public understanding and appreciation of astronomy.

In January 2010 he was elected as a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), and in October 2019 was a featured speaker at the organization&#x27;s annual conference, CSICon.

He has been an observer for Project Phoenix (SETI) as well as an active participant in various international forums for SETI research. He served as chair of the International Academy of Astronautics SETI Permanent Study Group from 2002 to 2012.

Shostak has been nominated by the SETI Institute to be one of the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s Nifty Fifty Speakers, who will speak about his work and career to middle and high school students in October 2010.

==Personal life==
Seth became interested in electronics and amateur radio as a young student.

Shostak&#x27;s hobbies include film making, railroading, and computer animation. While working at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, he founded DIGIMA, a computer animation company. He is a brother of Robert Shostak, developer of the Paradox relational database.

In the spring of 1988 Seth left Groningen to help his brother, who was then working on image database software in Silicon Valley.

According to his C.V., Shostak has a considerable body of creative writing, mostly for corporate clients. He was also &quot;idea man&quot; behind a plan to build a large space and technology theme park in The Netherlands and also the Air and Space Exhibit at the California Science Center, where he also serves on the board.

<text>The TMS9918 is a video display controller (VDC) manufactured by Texas Instruments, in manuals referenced as &quot;Video Display Processor&quot; (VDP) and introduced in 1979. The TMS9918 and its variants were used in the ColecoVision, CreatiVision, Memotech MTX, MSX, NABU Personal Computer, SG-1000/SC-3000, Spectravideo SV-318, SV-328, Sord M5, Tatung Einstein, TI-99/4, Casio PV-2000, Coleco Adam, Hanimex Pencil II, PECOS and Tomy Tutor.

The TMS9918 generates both grid-based character graphics (used to display text or background images) and sprites used for moving foreground objects.

The key features of this chip are, as highlighted in a 1980 presentation by Karl Guttag (one of the designers):

*256 by 192 full color pixels per screen
*15 different colors and/or shades
*Non-interlaced color composite video output
*Direct wiring to RAS/CAS type dynamic RAMs
*Automatic refresh of dynamic RAMs
*General 8-bit memory mapped type CPU interface
*CPU accesses RAM via VDP (no need for DMA)
*32 dynamic characters per screen
*Thirty-two 8×8 patterns per row, 24 rows per screen
*Text mode with forty 6×8 patterns per row
*Multicolor mode with 64 by 48 memory mappable color squares
*External video input and control
*Single supply +5 volt operation
*Standard N-Channel silicon gate technology

==Product family==
All of the ICs in this family are usually referred to by the TMS9918 name, sometimes with an &#x27;A&#x27; postfix. The &#x27;A&#x27; indicates a second version of the chip which added new features, most prominently the addition of a bitmap mode (Graphic II).

===TMS9918===
The TMS9918 was only used in the TI-99/4; the TI-99/4A and the other computers had the A version VDC.

=== TMS9918A, TMS9928A and TMS9929A ===

The TMS9918A and TMS9928A output a 60 Hz video signal, while the TMS9929A outputs 50 Hz. The difference between &#x27;1&#x27; and the &#x27;2&#x27; in &#x27;TMS9918A&#x27; and &#x27;TMS9928A&#x27; is that the &#x27;1&#x27; version outputs composite NTSC video, while the &#x27;2&#x27; versions (including the TMS9929A) outputs analog Y luminance and R-Y and B-Y colour difference signals. The need for the latter was predominant in the 50 Hz world, including Europe, due to the different video signal standards PAL and SECAM. It was more cost-effective to output Y, R-Y and B-Y and encode them into PAL or SECAM in the RF modulator, than to try to have a different console for every different color standard. The &#x27;1&#x27; version also features an external composite video input which made it a handy chip to use in video &quot;titlers&quot; that could overlay text or graphics on video, while the &#x27;2&#x27; version does not.

The original variants of the TMS9918 were depletion load NMOS and manufactured on a 4.5 μm process; it was one of the first depletion load NMOS chips Texas Instruments manufactured in contrast to the TMS9900 microprocessor which used the older enhancement load NMOS process that required three supply voltages. Due to the large die size and relatively high internal speed, the TMS9918 ran warm enough to necessitate a heat sink; some devices such as the Taiwanese DINA console (a hybrid Colecovision/SG-1000) neglected to install sinks and suffered from malfunctions of the chip. By 1983 Texas Instruments had shrunk the die size to 3 μm which ran cooler and no longer required a sink; MSX machines and the Sega SG-1000 used the newer 3 μm TMS9918 while most Colecovisions had the original 4.5 μm variant (the final run of the consoles produced in 1985 had the newer model TMS9918).

===TMS9118, TMS9128 and TMS9129===

A later variant of the TMS9918 series chips, the TMS9118, TMS9128, and TMS9129, were released in the mid-late 1980s, but were never very popular. The function of one pin is changed, and the mapping of the video memory allows two 16K×4-bit chips to be used instead of the eight 16K×1-bit chips the TMS99xx needs. Otherwise the chips are completely identical to the TMS9918A, TMS9928A and TMS9929A respectively.

==External interfaces==

===Video RAM===
The VDP has 16K × 8 bits of external video memory. This memory is outside the address space of the CPU. Having a separate address space means that the CPU has to do more work to write or read this memory, but it also means that the VDC doesn&#x27;t slow the CPU down when it periodically reads this memory to generate the display. Additionally, it leaves more address space available to the CPU for other memory and memory-mapped hardware.

Depending on the screen mode being used, not all of the video memory may be needed to generate the display. In these cases, the CPU may use the extra video memory for other purposes. For example, one use is as a scratch-pad for uncompressing graphics or sound data stored in cartridge ROM into. Another popular use is to create a second copy of some or all of the display data to eliminate flickering and tearing, a technique known as double buffering.

===CPU===
The CPU communicates with the VDP through an 8-bit bus. A pin controlled by the CPU separates this bus into two &quot;ports&quot;, a control port and a data port. To write or read a byte of video memory, the CPU first has to write two bytes on the VDP&#x27;s control port to the VDC&#x27;s internal address register. Next, the CPU performs the actual write or read on the VDP&#x27;s data port. As a data byte is written or read, the TMS9918 automatically increments the internal address register. This auto-increment feature accelerates writes and reads of blocks of data. The control port is also used to access various internal registers.

==Graphics==
The TMS9918 has two separate and distinct graphics types: characters and sprites.

===Characters===
Characters are typically used to create text or background images. They appear behind sprites.

====Screen modes====
The TMS9918 has a number of screen modes that control the characteristics of the characters.

=====Documented=====
There are four documented screen modes available in the TMS9918A (as mentioned before, the TMS9918 lacks mode Graphic 2):
* Mode 0 (Text): 240×192 pixels total, as 40×24 characters, pulled from 1 character set of 256 6×8 pixel characters. The entire character set has a 2-color limitation. This mode doesn&#x27;t support sprites.
* Mode 1 (Graphic 1): 256×192 pixels total, as 32×24 characters, pulled from 1 character set of 256 8×8 pixel characters. Each group of 8 characters in the character set has a 2-color limitation. For example, the characters &quot;0&quot; through &quot;7&quot; will all have the same color attributes.
* Mode 2 (Graphic 2): 256×192 pixels total, as 32×24 characters, pulled from 3 character sets of 256 8×8 pixel characters. Each 8-pixel-wide line of a character in the character sets has a 2-color limitation. This mode provides a unique character for every character location on screen, allowing for the display of bitmapped images.
* Mode 3 (Multicolor): 256×192 pixels total, 64×48 changeable virtual pixels, as 32×24 &quot;semi-graphics&quot; characters. These semi-graphics are defined in a special character set of 256 characters defined by 2×2 &quot;fat-pixels&quot;. There are 4×4 pixels in each fat-pixel, but the pixels within a fat-pixel cannot be individually defined, although each fat-pixel can have its own color, hence the name of this mode (Multicolor). This mode is very blocky, and rarely used.

====== Screen Mode 2 details ======
Technically, mode 2 is a character mode with a colorful character set. The screen is horizontally divided into three 256×64 pixel areas, each of which gets its own character set. By sequentially printing the characters 0 through 255 in all three areas, the program can simulate a graphics mode where each pixel can be set individually. However, the resulting framebuffer is non-linear.

The program can also use three identical character sets, and then deal with the screen like a text mode with a colorful character set. Background patterns and sprites then consist of colorful characters. This was commonly used in games, because only 32×24 bytes would have to be moved to fill and scroll the entire screen.

The challenge of using TMS9918 mode 2 was that every 8×1 pixel area could have only two colors, foreground and background. They could be freely picked out of the 16 color palette, but for each 8×1 area, only two colors could exist. When manipulating the screen in BASIC with the codice_1 command, one easily could exceed the maximum 2 colors per 8×1 area and end up with &quot;color spill&quot;.

=====Undocumented=====
Texas Instruments originally only documented the four modes listed above. However the bit that enables mode 2 is more interesting than initially let on. It is best described as a modifier bit for the other modes. Enabling it does three things:

# Expands the color table size.
# Divides the screen horizontally into thirds.
# Changes two address bits of the pattern and color tables into mask bits, which controls whether each third of the screen has its own pattern and color table or not.

With this in mind, three additional modes are possible. Note that although genuine TMS9918A chips support these modes, clones and emulators may not.
* Mode 0 (Text) + Mode 2 (Graphic 2): Known as &quot;Bitmap Text Mode&quot;. This mode allows for two-color bitmap images, with no color table. This saves memory, at the expense of a slightly reduced horizontal resolution (text mode has a horizontal resolution of 240 pixels instead of 256 pixels like the graphic modes do).
* Mode 1 (Graphic 1) + Mode 2 (Graphic 2): Known as &quot;Half-Bitmap Mode&quot;. Texas Instruments actually documented this &quot;undocumented&quot; screen mode in their manual titled &quot;Video Display Processors Programmers Guide SPPU004&quot;. In section 8.4.2, &quot;Playing Games with VRAM Addressing&quot;, they discuss how this mode combines the memory savings of mode 1 with the color detail of mode 2. However, as they go on to say this mode limits the number of sprites that can be displayed to 8 instead of 32. Therefore, the term &quot;undocumented&quot; used to describe this mode is a misnomer. However, because this manual was not widely known, this mode is generally considered to be one of the undocumented modes. Generally, the only reason to use this mode over Mode 2 is to reduce memory consumption.
* Mode 3 (Multicolor) + Mode 2 (Graphic 2): Known as Bitmap Multicolor Mode. This mode is more of a novelty, as it offers nothing beyond what the standard Multicolor mode can already do.

====Scrolling====
The TMS9918 does not have any scroll registers, so scrolling must be done by software. Furthermore, scrolling can only be done on character boundaries, not pixel by pixel.

===Sprites===
Sprites are typically used to create moving foreground objects. They appear in front of characters (tiles).

Modes 1, 2, and 3 can render sprites. There can be up to 32 monochrome sprites of either 8×8 or 16×16 pixels on screen, each sprite with its own, single color. The illusion of multicolor sprites can be created by stacking multiple sprites on top of each other.

There can be no more than 4 sprites on a single scanline; any additional sprites&#x27; horizontal pixels are dropped. Sprites with a higher priority are drawn first. The VDP reports in a status register the number of the first dropped sprite. The CPU can get around this limitation by rotating sprite priorities so that a different set of sprites is drawn on every frame; instead of disappearing entirely, the sprites will flicker. This technique is known as sprite multiplexing.

Automatic sprite movement is not handled by the VDP. Instead, in practice, the CPU will pick up on the VDP&#x27;s vertical interrupt - a standard VDP output, which is triggered automatically once every 50th or 60th of a second (depending on chip variant), at the start of the VBI (vertical blanking interval). The CPU then jumps to a sprite-handling routine in the software, which in turn tells the VDP where to reposition the sprites.

The sprite collision flag is set when non-zero pattern bits of two sprites coincide, even if either sprite has transparent colour. This is useful for triggering more advanced collision detection routines inside the software which can then determine the exact location of the collision and act upon it, as the VDP is itself incapable of reporting which two sprites have collided.

===Colors===
The TMS9918 family chips used a composite video palette. Colors were generated based on a combination of luminance and chrominance values for the TMS9918A and Y, R-Y and B-Y values are for the TMS9928A/9929A .

====Datasheet values====
The TMS9918 has a fixed 16-color palette, composed of 15 displayed colors and a &quot;transparent&quot; color.
* When &quot;transparent&quot; is used for sprites, it will show the graphics plane.
* When &quot;transparent&quot; is used for the text/graphics plane, it will show the backdrop.
* When &quot;transparent&quot; is used for the backdrop, it will show the external video signal (if enabled) otherwise black.

According to &quot;Table 2.3 - Color Assignments&quot; on the datasheet outputs levels are the following:

&quot;Notes: Colors are merely illustrative, and were converted from the YPrPb values (MS9928A/9929A) to sRGB taking into account Gamma correction. SMPTE C colorimetry was not taken into account - see the next section for alternate color conversions.&quot;

====CRT display====
Converting Y, R-Y and B-Y to RGB requires considering how Y originated:
 Y = R * 0.30 + G * 0.59 + B * 0.11

This leads to the following formulas:
 R = R-Y + Y
 B = B-Y + Y
 G = (Y - 0.30 * R - 0.11 * B) / 0.59

But for all colors that have no chrominance - thus black, gray and white - R-Y and B-Y are not 0% but all have an offset of 47%. So this offset has to be subtracted from all R-Y and B-Y values at first. Due to the fact that in practice this one step will never be done alone, it&#x27;s no problem that some results will be negative:

Next comes the conversion to RGB. All results must be in the range from 0% to 100%:

The erroneous value of 113% for R of color &quot;light red&quot; might seem to come from a typo within the datasheet and there R-Y must not be greater than 80%. But measuring the output signals of the chip with an oscilloscope shows that all values in the table are correct. So the error is inside the chip and drives the red signal into saturation. For this reason this value is to be corrected to 100%.

Up to that time only cathode ray tubes had been available for computer monitors as well as for televisions, and that these CRTs had a gamma. The TMS9918 series chips had been designed to work with televisions and their CRTs had a gamma of 1.6 (remark: CRTs of Macintosh monitors had 1.8 and the CRTs of PC monitors had 2.2). Flat screens do not have gamma. For this reason the colors of the TMS9918 look somewhat pale here as in the first table above. The below table uses the gamma-corrected values, which are (written in hexadecimal):

The used steps are: Round all values to two decimal places, then raise to the power of 1.6 for gamma correction and finally transform the range of values from 0...100 to 0...255.

==Specifications==
* Video RAM: direct wiring to 4, 8, or 16 KB
* Text modes: 40 × 24 and 32 × 24
* Resolution: 256 × 192
* Colours: 15 colours + transparent
* Sprites: 32, 1 colour, max 4 per horizontal line

==Legacy==

Texas Instruments&#x27; TMS9918A was succeeded by Yamaha&#x27;s V9938, which added additional bitmap modes, more colorful sprites, a vertical full-screen scroll register, vertical and horizontal offset registers, a hardware blitter and a customizable palette. The V9938 was designed for the MSX2 standard of computers, and later used in a third-party upgrade to the TI-99/4A: the Geneve 9640 &quot;computer-on-a-card&quot;. 

The V9938, in turn, was succeeded by the V9958, which added some additional high-colour modes and a horizontal two-page scroll register, these chips were used in the MSX2+/turboR systems.

Toshiba made a clone called the T6950 and does not support the undocumented pattern / color table masking feature in graphics 2 mode. Later, Toshiba released the T7937A MSX-Engine with a built-in VDP and fixed the masking features. Both VDPs by Toshiba feature a slightly different palette than the Texas VDPs, with more vivid colors.

The TMS9918 was the basis for the VDP chips in the Master System, Game Gear, and Mega Drive (Genesis). They use additional display modes and registers, and added hardware scrolling capabilities and other advanced features. The Ricoh PPU chip in the Nintendo Entertainment System (Famicom) is also based on the TMS9918.

<doc id="725103" wikidata="Q1145732" url="?curid=725103" title="Sleepers (film)">
<text>Sleepers is a 1996 American legal crime drama film written, produced and directed by Barry Levinson, and based on Lorenzo Carcaterra&#x27;s 1995 book of the same name. The film stars Kevin Bacon, Jason Patric, Brad Pitt, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Minnie Driver, Vittorio Gassman, Brad Renfro, Ron Eldard, Jeffrey Donovan, Terry Kinney, Joe Perrino, Geoffrey Wigdor, Jonathan Tucker, Bruno Kirby and Billy Crudup. The title is a slang term for juvenile delinquents who serve sentences longer than nine months.

&quot;Sleepers&quot; was theatrically released in the United States October 18, 1996, and was a box-office hit, grossing $165.6 million against a $44 million budget.

==Plot==
Lorenzo &quot;Shakes&quot; Carcaterra, Tommy Marcano, Michael Sullivan, and John Reilly are childhood friends living in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen in the 1960s. Father &quot;Bobby&quot; Carillo, their parish priest, tries to teach them right from wrong. The boys play pranks and start running small errands for local gangster King Benny.

In summer 1967, the four young teens steal a hot-dog cart. They accidentally roll the cart down a set of subway stairs, severely injuring a man. The boys are all sentenced to serve time at a juvenile detention center called Wilkinson Home for Boys in Upstate New York; Shakes is given six-to-twelve months, while the others are given 12-to-18 months. During their stay, they are repeatedly subjected to sexual abuse and torture by head guards Sean Nokes, Henry Addison, Ralph Ferguson and Adam Styler.

While at the facility, they participate in Wilkinson&#x27;s annual football game between the guards and inmates. Michael convinces inmate Rizzo Robinson to help win the game. Humiliated, the guards move the boys to solitary confinement for weeks, where they are systematically beaten. Rizzo does not survive, and his family is told he had died of pneumonia.

In spring 1968, shortly before Shakes&#x27;s release from Wilkinson, he suggests the boys publicly report the abuse. The others refuse, with Michael asserting that no one would believe them or care, and they vow to never speak of it again. The night before young Lorenzo is released, Nokes and the other guards arrange a &quot;farewell party&quot; in which the four boys are brutally raped.

In 1981, John and Tommy, now career criminals working with the Irish Mob, unexpectedly encounter Sean Nokes in a Hell&#x27;s Kitchen pub. When John and Tommy confront him, he dismisses the abuse he put them through. John and Tommy then fatally shoot Nokes in the presence of witnesses. Michael, now an assistant district attorney, gets himself assigned to the case; he secretly intends to botch the prosecution to expose the abuse committed by the guards at Wilkinson&#x27;s. With Shakes, now a timetable clerk for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he forms a plan to free John and Tommy to get revenge on the other Wilkinson abusers. With the help of King Benny and Carol, the boys&#x27; childhood friend, they carry out their plan using information compiled by Michael on the backgrounds of the guards. They are helped by Danny Snyder, an alcoholic lawyer who defends John and Tommy.

Michael secretly drafts scripted questions for Snyder in advance. As a result, Snyder casts significant doubt on the testimony of a woman who witnessed the murder, and two other witnesses are intimidated into silence. For his plan to fully succeed, however, Michael decides that he must damage Nokes&#x27;s reputation and convincingly place John and Tommy at another location at the time of the shooting. When called as a witness, Ferguson (now a social worker) admits that Nokes and the other guards systematically abused the boys. But to clinch the case, a key witness is still needed for John and Tommy&#x27;s alibi. Shakes has a long talk with Father Bobby; after learning the truth about the abuse the boys suffered, he reluctantly agrees to perjure himself. Father Bobby testifies at trial that John and Tommy were with him at a New York Knicks game at the time of the shooting, producing three ticket stubs to prove it. As a result, John and Tommy are acquitted.

The remaining guards are also punished for their crimes. Addison, who became a politician and continued to molest children, is abducted and killed near the local airport. The killers are gangsters led by Rizzo&#x27;s older brother, Eddie &quot;Little Caesar&quot; Robinson, who heard the truth about Rizzo&#x27;s death from King Benny. Styler, now a corrupt police officer, is imprisoned for taking bribes and murdering a drug dealer.

After the acquittal, Michael, Shakes, John and Tommy meet with Carol at a local bar to celebrate. It is the final time the four men are together. Shakes remains in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen. Michael quits the DA&#x27;s office, moves to the English countryside, becomes a carpenter and remains unpartnered. John and Tommy both die before age 30; John succumbs to alcohol poisoning, while Tommy is ambushed and murdered by rival criminals. Carol remains in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen as a social worker; she has a son, naming him John Thomas Michael Martinez and nicknaming him &quot;Shakes&quot;.

==Production==
Lorenzo Carcaterra first submitted a manuscript of his book &quot;Sleepers&quot;, to Ballantine Books, which immediately attracted interest from multiple film companies. Ultimately, Propaganda Films managed to obtain the movie rights for $2.1 million at an auction in February 1995. Barry Levinson was attached as director mere days afterward, and opted to write the screenplay himself.

The first words spoken in the film are: &quot;This is a true story about friendship that runs deeper than blood&quot;. However, the truthfulness and factual accuracy of the film — and the book on which it is based — were challenged by the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church and School in Manhattan (the school attended by Carcaterra), and by the Manhattan District Attorney&#x27;s office, among others. Carcaterra has acknowledged that most details in the book were fictionalized, but maintained that the events described in the book actually occurred. Brad Pitt was cast alongside Robert De Niro in July 1995, and filming began the following month. In response to the fast pace of the production process, Ballantine scheduled the book to be released around the same time that De Niro and Pitt were cast.

Emilio Estevez was cast as John Riley, but was already involved in three movies that year; Sandra Bullock was cast as Carol, but was already involved in the movie &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;, and was thus replaced by Minnie Driver.

As they had previously worked together on &quot;Diner&quot;, Kevin Bacon was approached by Levinson to play the role of Nokes, but did not read the book until after he accepted the role. Due to the logistics of filming, Bacon did not meet De Niro or Dustin Hoffman until the film&#x27;s premiere in Venice.

==Release==
===Box office===
In its opening weekend, the film grossed $12.3 million from 1,915 theaters in the United States and Canada, debuting atop of the box office. &quot;Sleepers&quot; grossed $53.3 million domestically and $112.3 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $165.6 million.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 73%, based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 6.60/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Old friendships are awakened by the need for revenge, making &quot;Sleepers&quot; a haunting nightmare burdened by voiceover yet terrifically captured by Barry Levinson.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A–&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

Critics praised the performances of De Niro, Hoffman, Bacon and the young cast, as well as the cinematography and production design. However, multiple critics said the film loses focus in its second half. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Sleepers&quot; wants to do something impossible — merge the mournful, drenched-in-shame emotions of child abuse with the huckster gamesmanship of a contraption like &quot;The Sting&quot;.&quot;

David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; criticized Levinson&#x27;s script, and reasoned the adult characters of Shakes, Michael, John and Tommy were not fully fleshed out.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film three stars of four, but said it did not engage enough in the moral issues it purported to be about.

Steve Davis of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; wrote: &quot;What a more interesting film this would have been had Levinson found a way to integrate the past and the present so that one informed the other.&quot;

When the film was released, there was controversy about how much of the novel claimed to be a true story, and how much had been invented by its author.

===Accolades===
==Home media==
The film was released on VHS and DVD on April 1, 1997, and on Blu-ray on August 2, 2011.

<doc id="725111" wikidata="Q1512266" url="?curid=725111" title="Disdyakis triacontahedron">
<text>In geometry, a disdyakis triacontahedron, hexakis icosahedron, decakis dodecahedron, kisrhombic triacontahedron or d120 is a Catalan solid with 120 faces and the dual to the Archimedean truncated icosidodecahedron. As such it is face-uniform but with irregular face polygons. It slightly resembles an inflated rhombic triacontahedron: if one replaces each face of the rhombic triacontahedron with a single vertex and four triangles in a regular fashion, one ends up with a disdyakis triacontahedron. That is, the disdyakis triacontahedron is the Kleetope of the rhombic triacontahedron. It is also the barycentric subdivision of the regular dodecahedron and icosahedron. It has the most faces among the Archimedean and Catalan solids, with the snub dodecahedron, with 92 faces, in second place. 

If the bipyramids, the gyroelongated bipyramids, and the trapezohedra are excluded, the disdyakis triacontahedron has the most faces of any other strictly convex polyhedron where every face of the polyhedron has the same shape.

Projected into a sphere, the edges of a disdyakis triacontahedron define 15 great circles. Buckminster Fuller used these 15 great circles, along with 10 and 6 others in two other polyhedra to define his 31 great circles of the spherical icosahedron.

== Geometry ==
Being a Catalan solid with triangular faces, the disdyakis triacontahedron&#x27;s three face angles formula_1 and common dihedral angle formula_2 must obey the following constraints analogous to other Catalan solids:

:formula_3
:formula_4
:formula_5
:formula_6

The above four equations are solved simultaneously to get the following face angles and dihedral angle:

:formula_7
:formula_8
:formula_9
:formula_10

where formula_11 is the golden ratio.

As with all Catalan solids, the dihedral angles at all edges are the same, even though the edges may be of different lengths.

== Cartesian coordinates ==


The 62 vertices of a disdyakis triacontahedron are given by:

* Twelve vertices formula_12 and their cyclic permutations,

* Eight vertices formula_13,

* Twelve vertices formula_14 and their cyclic permutations,

* Six vertices formula_15 and their cyclic permutations.

* Twenty-four vertices formula_16 and their cyclic permutations,

where
:formula_17,
:formula_18, and
:formula_19 is the golden ratio.

In the above coordinates, the first 12 vertices form a regular icosahedron, the next 20 vertices (those with &quot;R&quot;) form a regular dodecahedron, and the last 30 vertices (those with &quot;S&quot;) form an icosidodecahedron.

Normalizing all vertices to the unit sphere gives a &quot;spherical&quot; disdyakis triacontahedron, shown in the adjacent figure. This figure also depicts the 120 transformations associated with the full icosahedral group &quot;Ih&quot;.

==Symmetry==
The edges of the polyhedron projected onto a sphere form 15 great circles, and represent all 15 mirror planes of reflective &quot;Ih&quot; icosahedral symmetry. Combining pairs of light and dark triangles define the fundamental domains of the nonreflective (&quot;I&quot;) icosahedral symmetry. The edges of a compound of five octahedra also represent the 10 mirror planes of icosahedral symmetry.



==Orthogonal projections==
The disdyakis triacontahedron has three types of vertices which can be centered in orthogonally projection:
== Uses==

The &quot;disdyakis triacontahedron&quot;, as a regular dodecahedron with pentagons divided into 10 triangles each, is considered the &quot;holy grail&quot; for combination puzzles like the Rubik&#x27;s cube. Such a puzzle currently has no satisfactory mechanism. It is the most significant unsolved problem in mechanical puzzles, often called the &quot;big chop&quot; problem.

This shape was used to make 120-sided dice using 3D printing.

Since 2016, the Dice Lab has used the disdyakis triacontahedron to mass-market an injection-moulded 120-sided die. It is claimed that 120 is the largest possible number of faces on a fair die, aside from infinite families (such as right regular prisms, bipyramids, and trapezohedra) that would be impractical in reality due to the tendency to roll for a long time.

A disdyakis triacontahedron projected onto a sphere is used as the logo for Brilliant, a website containing series of lessons on STEM-related topics.

== Related polyhedra and tilings ==

It is topologically related to a polyhedra sequence defined by the face configuration &quot;V4.6.2n&quot;. This group is special for having all even number of edges per vertex and form bisecting planes through the polyhedra and infinite lines in the plane, and continuing into the hyperbolic plane for any &quot;n&quot; ≥ 7.

With an even number of faces at every vertex, these polyhedra and tilings can be shown by alternating two colors so all adjacent faces have different colors.

Each face on these domains also corresponds to the fundamental domain of a symmetry group with order 2,3,&quot;n&quot; mirrors at each triangle face vertex. This is *&quot;n&quot;32 in orbifold notation, and [&quot;n&quot;,3] in Coxeter notation.

<doc id="725116" wikidata="Q678885" url="?curid=725116" title="Santa Leopoldina">
<text>Santa Leopoldina is a municipality in central Espírito Santo, Brazil. Its population was 12,885 (2015) and its area is 718.1 km². It is 16 meters above sea level, and is located 44 km from the state capital of Vitória.

==History==
Santa Leopoldina was founded in 1856 by around 60 Swiss immigrants who came up the Santa Maria River, closely followed in 1857 by roughly 200 immigrants from Germany and Luxembourg. The old extended version of the name, &quot;Cachoeiro de Santa Leopoldina&quot;, was given in 1860 by the emperor Pedro II, in honour of his mother Maria Leopoldina, Archduchess of Austria.

During the 19th century the town was, for a period, the biggest commercial centre of the state, but its influence declined after the arrival of roads which took traffic away from the river, which was then the town&#x27;s biggest advantage. Santa Maria River was navigable right through to the Atlantic from this point.

The first highway (&quot;rodovia&quot;) in the state was built between Santa Leopoldina and Santa Teresa and was completed in 1918, which was extended to Vitória in 1924. Cachoeiro de Santa Leopoldina first became a municipality in 1887 and dropped &quot;Cachoeiro de&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;waterfall of&quot;) from its name in 1943.

In 1890 Santa Teresa separated from Santa Leopoldina, and in 1988 Santa Maria de Jetibá also separated, leaving a much smaller area under its power.

<text>Wiley Post Airport is a city-owned public-use airport located seven nautical miles (13 km) northwest of the central business district of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States. The facility covers 1,143 acres (463 ha) and has three runways.

It was named after Wiley Post, the first pilot to fly solo around the world, who died in the same 1935 crash as the namesake of the city&#x27;s other major airport, Will Rogers World Airport.

It is the FAA-designated reliever airport for Will Rogers World Airport and serves business and corporate air travelers and functions as a center for general aviation. In addition, the northwest Oklahoma City airport provides an environment for aviation-related industry.

In the year ending July 7, 2021, Wiley Post logged 55,293 flight operations. This figure accounts for only those operations logged by the air traffic control tower, which is open daily from 7 A.M. until 10 P.M.

The airport provides a base for over 300 aircraft in its leased hangars. These range from single and twin engine planes to turboprop and jet aircraft.

==Accidents==
*On March 4, 2008, a Cessna Citation I operated by &quot;Interstate Helicopters&quot; impacted terrain 4.1 miles SW of Wiley Post Airport after takeoff because of wing structure damage caused by impact with one or more large birds (American white pelicans). All 5 occupants (2 crew, 3 passengers) were killed.

<text>, officially , is the largest of the Okinawa Islands and the Ryukyu (&quot;Nansei&quot;) Islands of Japan in the Kyushu region. It is the smallest and least populated of the five main islands of Japan. The island is approximately long, an average wide, and has an area of . It is roughly south of the main island of Kyushu and the rest of Japan. It is northeast of Taiwan. The total population of Okinawa Island is 1,384,762. The greater Naha area has roughly 800,000 residents, while the city itself has about 320,000 people. Naha is the seat of Okinawa Prefecture on the southwestern part of Okinawa Island. Okinawa has a humid subtropical climate.

Okinawa has been a strategic location for the United States Armed Forces since the Battle of Okinawa and the end of World War II. The island was formally controlled by the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands until 1972, with around 26,000 U.S. military personnel stationed on Okinawa today, comprising about half of the total complement of the United States Forces Japan, spread among 31 areas, across 13 bases and 48 training sites. United States military installations cover approximately 25% of the island.

== History ==
=== Shell mound eras ===
Early Okinawan history is defined by midden or shell heap culture and is divided into Early, Middle, and Late Shell Mound periods. The Early Shell Mound period was a hunter-gatherer society, with the wave-like opening Jōmon pottery. In the latter part of this period, archaeological sites moved near the seashore, suggesting the engagement of people in fishing. On Okinawa, rice was not cultivated until the Middle Shell Mound period. Shell rings for arms made of shells obtained in the Sakishima Islands, namely Miyakojima and Yaeyama islands, were imported by Japan. In these islands, the presence of shell axes from 2,500 years ago suggests the influence of a southeastern-Pacific culture.
After the late Shell Mound period, agriculture started about the 12th century, and the population center moved from the seashore to higher places. This period is called the Gusuku period. &quot;Gusuku&quot; is a term used for the distinctive Ryukyuan form of castles or fortresses. Many &quot;gusuku&quot; and related cultural remains in the Ryukyu Islands have been listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. There are three perspectives regarding the nature of &quot;gusuku&quot;: that they were holy places, dwellings encircled by stones, and castles of the rulers. In this period, porcelain trade between Okinawa and other countries became commonplace, and Okinawa was an important relay point in eastern-Asian trade. Ryukyuan kings, such as Shunten and Eiso, were important rulers. An attempted Mongolian invasion in 1291 during the Eiso Dynasty failed. Hiragana was imported from Japan by Ganjin in 1265. &quot;Noro&quot;, village priestesses of the Ryukyuan religion, appeared.

=== Sanzan era and Ryūkyū Kingdom ===
The Sanzan period began in 1314 when the kingdoms of Hokuzan and Nanzan declared independence from Chūzan. The three kingdoms competed with one another for recognition and trade with Ming China. King Satto, leading Chūzan, was very successful, establishing relations with Korea and Southeast Asia as well as China. The Hongwu Emperor sent 36 families from Fujian in 1392 at the request of the Ryukyuan king. Their job was to manage maritime dealings in the kingdom. They assisted the Ryukyuans in developing their technology and diplomatic relations. In 1407, however, a man named Hashi overthrew Satto&#x27;s descendant, King Bunei, and installed his father, Shishō, as king of Chūzan.
In 1429, King Shō Hashi completed the unification of the three kingdoms and founded the Ryūkyū Kingdom with its capital at Shuri Castle. His descendants conquered the Amami Islands. In 1469, King Shō Taikyū died, so the royal government chose a man named Kanemaru as the new king, who chose the name Shō En and established the Second Shō Dynasty. His son Shō Shin conquered the Sakishima Islands and centralized the royal government, the military, and the &quot;noro&quot; priestesses.

=== Satsuma Domain ===
In 1609, the Japanese Satsuma Domain launched the invasion of Ryukyu, ultimately capturing the king and his capital after a long struggle. Ryukyu was forced to cede the Amami Islands and become a vassal of Satsuma. The kingdom became both a tributary of China and a tributary of Japan. Because China would not make a formal trade agreement unless a country was a tributary state, the kingdom was a convenient loophole for Japanese trade with China. When Japan officially closed off trade with European nations except for the Dutch, Nagasaki, Tsushima, and Kagoshima became the only Japanese trading ports offering connections with the outside world.

At some time, karate came into existence as a type of systematized martial arts.

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
Several Europeans visited Ryukyu starting in the late 18th century. The most important visits to Okinawa were from Captain Basil Hall in 1816 and Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1852. A Christian missionary, Bernard Jean Bettelheim, lived in the Gokoku-ji temple in Naha from 1846 to 1854.

In 1879, Japan annexed the entire Ryukyu archipelago. The Meiji government then established Okinawa Prefecture. The monarchy in Shuri was abolished, and the deposed King Shō Tai was forced to relocate to Tokyo.

=== Pacific War ===
Okinawa Island had the bloodiest ground battle of the Pacific War from 1 April to 22 June 1945. During this 82-day-long battle, about 95,000 Imperial Japanese Army troops and 20,195 Americans were killed. The Cornerstone of Peace at the Peace Memorial Park in Itoman lists 149,193 persons from Okinawa – approximately one quarter of the civilian population – were either killed or committed suicide during the Battle of Okinawa and the Pacific War. Very few Japanese ended up in POW camps. This may have been because of Japanese soldiers&#x27; reluctance to surrender. The total number of casualties shocked American military strategists. This made them apprehensive to invade the other main islands of Japan, because it would result in very high casualties.

=== American occupation ===
Japan became a pacifist country with the 1947 constitution, so America was obligated to protect Japan against foreign threats. During the American military occupation of Japan (1945–1952), which followed the Imperial Japanese surrender on 2 September 1945, in Tokyo Bay, the United States controlled Okinawa Island and the rest of the Ryukyu Islands. The Amami Islands were returned to Japanese control in 1953. The remaining Ryukyu Islands were returned to Japan on 17 June 1971. America kept numerous U.S. military bases on the islands. There are 32 United States military bases on Okinawa Island by the U.S.-Japan alliance since 1951. U.S. bases on Okinawa played critical roles in the Korean War, Vietnam War, Laotian Civil War, Cambodian campaign, War in Afghanistan, and Iraq War. Okinawa served as a prime staging post for the aforementioned wars. Its ports and airports were used to transport supplies. The base at Camp Chinen, Nanjo City was used by the CIA for covert operations. In 1965, Admiral Ulysses S. Grant Sharp stated that &quot;Without Okinawa, we couldn&#x27;t continue fighting the Vietnam war.&quot;

Intense use of the island by the U.S. military caused damage to the environment and residents. There were oil and fuel spills. Exposure to toxic substances caused illness of service members such as a nerve agent leak in 1969. Aircraft crashes, hit-and runs and murders killed residents. The perpetrators were often unpunished, since they could not be prosecuted in Okinawa Courts. The 1970s and 1980s also had severe pollution of waterways and wells with PFAS: toxic chemicals in foam used by fire fighting training at U.S. facilities such as Kadena Air Base.

=== 1970s narcotics trade ===
In the early 1970s, according to a U.S. government report, Okinawa was a key conduit for smuggling drugs such as heroin from Thailand via Okinawa to the United States. It was called &quot;The Okinawa System&quot; in the global drug trade. A testimony by a head of the Department of Defense said that drug abuse was &quot;quite extensive.&quot; It began in the second half of 1968; marijuana was smuggled from Thailand to Okinawa and grown near an unidentified U.S. Marine Corps training area in northern Okinawa. A package of marijuana fell from an aircraft, and another was discovered at a military post office. From the mid-1970s onwards, LSD and heroin became more prevalent. Deserters worked as &quot;passport civilians&quot; and smuggled the drugs into Okinawa. A lack of customs inspections made smuggling easy. There were well organized Ryukyuan smuggling rings who brought heroin, LSD, and marijuana to Okinawa, and produced LSD on the island.

=== 21st century ===
In 2013, following escalating tensions following competing claims to the uninhabited Senkaku Islands, the People&#x27;s Republic of China began questioning Japan&#x27;s sovereignty to the island of Okinawa, citing its past as the independent tributary state of Ryukyu. On 31 October 2019, the main courtyard structures of Shurijo were destroyed in a fire. It marked the fifth time that Shurijo was destroyed following previous incidents in 1453, 1660, 1709 and 1945. The 2019 fire burned down sections of Shuri Castle: &quot;Six castle buildings occupying some in total were gutted.&quot; Rebuilding efforts were underway as of 10 February 2020.

==Demographics==
As of September 2009, the Japanese government estimates the population at 1,384,762, which includes American military personnel and their families. The Okinawan language, called &quot;Uchināguchi&quot;, is spoken by adults only, but several local groups promote the use of the Okinawan language by younger people.

Whereas the northern half of Okinawa Island is sparsely populated, the south-central and southern parts of the island are markedly urbanized—particularly the city of Naha and the urban corridor stretching north from there to Okinawa City. The population distribution is approximately 120,000 in northern Okinawa, 590,000 in central Okinawa and 540,000 in southern Okinawa. It has a high population density of 1,014.93/km2.

During the Meiji Period, Okinawan ethnic identity, tradition, culture and language were suppressed by the Meiji government, which sought to assimilate the Okinawans as Japanese (Yamato). Many ethnic Japanese have since migrated to Okinawa. The modern inhabitants of Okinawa are mainly ethnic Okinawan, Japanese, half Japanese and mixed.

Okinawans are known for their longevity. This particular island is a so-called Blue Zone, an area where the people live longer than most others elsewhere in the world. Five times as many Okinawans reach 100 years old compared to the rest of Japan. there were 34.7 centenarians for every 100,000 inhabitants, which is the highest ratio worldwide. Possible explanations are diet, low-stress lifestyle, caring community, activity, and spirituality of the inhabitants of the island. The Okinawan diet consists of low-fat, low-salt foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables, legumes, tofu, and seaweed.

==Geography==
Okinawa is the fifth largest island of Japan. The island has an area of . The coastline is long. The straight-line distance is about from north to south. Okinawa is in the northeastern end of Okinawa Prefecture. Since 1972 over of land has been added via reclamation.

It is roughly south of the main island of Kyushu. Okinawa is connected to nearby islands near a land bridge: Katsuren Peninsula is connected via the Mid-Sea Road to Henza Island, Miyagi Island, Ikei Island, and Hamahiga Island. Similarly, from the Motobu Peninsula on the northwestern side, all of Sesoko-jima plus Yagaji Island and Kōri-jima are connected by bridges. Okinawa Island has several beaches such as Manza Beach, Emerald Beach, Okuma Beach, Zanpa Beach, Moon Beach and Sunset Beach (Chatan-cho). Mount Omoto, at , is the highest mountain in Okinawa, with Mount Yonaha being the second highest.

The Motobu Peninsula in the north has limestone layers and karst development. In the center and south is mainly a Ryukyu limestone layer and mudstone. The topography is flat, there are few hills over with very few rivers. The subtropical rains accelerate erosion requiring many drainages and uvala. The southern end of the island consists of uplifted coral reef, whereas the northern half has proportionally more igneous rock. The easily eroded limestone of the south has many caves, the most famous of which is Gyokusendō in Nanjō. The northernmost Cape Hedo is only away from Yoronjima. Cape Arasaki is the southernmost location of Okinawa island. It is sometimes confused with Cape Kiyanmisaki.

===Flora and fauna===
The northern half of Okinawa has one of the largest tracts of subtropical rainforest in Asia called the Yanbaru. There are many endemic species of flora and fauna. There are a small number of endemic Yanbaru kuina (also known as the Okinawa rail), a small flightless bird that is close to extinction. The critically endangered Okinawa woodpecker is also endemic to the island. The Indian mongoose was introduced to the island to prevent the native habu pit viper from attacking the birds. It did not succeed in eliminating the habu but instead preyed on birds, increasing the threat to the Okinawa rail.

The coconut crab is the largest terrestrial hermit crab of Okinawa and the Ryukyu Islands. It is an endangered species due to over-hunting, which has made them scarce on Okinawa island. In 2021, coconut crabs were found to live in a small cave system on the islet Nagashima off the Henoko district.

A small population of endangered dugongs lives around Okinawa. The estimates are between 3 and 50 survivors.

===Climate===
The island has a humid subtropical climate bordering on a tropical rainforest climate. The climate supports a dense Subtropical forest in the northern Yanbaru National Park. A rainy season occurs in the late spring.

==Cuisine==
There are many local pubs (&quot;izakaya&quot;) and cafes that serve Okinawan cuisine and dishes, such as &quot;gōyā chanpurū&quot; (bitter melon stir fry), &quot;fu chanpurū&quot; (wheat gluten chanpurū), and &quot;tonkatsu&quot; (tenderized, breaded, fried pork cutlet). Okinawan soba is the signature dish and consists of wheat noodles served hot in a soup, usually with pork (rib or pork belly). This contrasts with the mainland soba, which is buckwheat noodles. Rafute, which is braised pork belly, is another popular Okinawan dish. American presence on the island has also led to some creative dishes such as taco rice, which is now a common meal served in bentos, and the common use of spam.

==Economy==

Among the prefectures of Japan, Okinawa has the youngest and fastest-growing population but has the lowest employment rate and average income. The island economy is primarily driven by tourism and the U.S. military presence, with efforts in recent years to diversify into other sectors.

The Motobu Peninsula has a large-scale quarry and cement factory, taking advantage of the limestone in the area. There is also agriculture with tropical fruit such as &quot;Malpighia emarginata&quot;.

===Tourism===
Tourist attractions include Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium (at one time the world&#x27;s largest aquarium), Century Beach, Pineapple Park, the Orion Beer Factory and Hiji Falls. In recent years, Okinawa has become an increasingly popular destination for tourists from China and Southeast Asia. In 2018, Okinawa attracted 9,842,400 tourists, a positive growth of 4.7% from 9,396,200 in the previous year.

===Military bases===
The U.S. military bases account for 4 to 5% of the island economy. There is also a smaller contingent of Japanese military bases on the island. Several former U.S. military facilities on Okinawa have been re-developed as commercial areas, most notably the American Village in Chatan, which opened in 1998, and the Aeon Mall Okinawa Rycom in Kitanakagusuku, which opened in 2015.

==U.S. military in Okinawa==


The United States maintains American military bases in Japan as part of the U.S.-Japan alliance since 1951. Most U.S. military is in Okinawa Prefecture. In 2013, there were approximately 50,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in Japan with 40,000 dependents and 5,500 American civilians employed by the United States Department of Defense. About 26,000 U.S. military personnel are on Okinawa Island.

There are 13 United States military bases on Okinawa Island. Approximately 62% of all United States bases in Japan are on Okinawa. They cover 25% of Okinawa island. The major bases are Futenma, Kadena, Hansen, Torii, Schwab, Foster, and Kinser. There are 28 U.S. military facilities on Okinawa. They are mainly concentrated in the central area. At one point, Okinawa hosted approximately 1,200 nuclear warheads. There were several nuclear weapons incidents on Okinawa and in the sea near the islands.

In 1997, the peculiar inhabitant population of this island [both Americans and Japanese living together since 1945] was used to prove a curious conjecture. By that time nine subtypes of JC virus had been found, each from a different segment of the old world. Virtually every individual of this world is infected with one or the other JCV subtype, by the time he/she reaches 10 years of age. This virus is isolated from urine, and another conjecture is that most children are infected from parents, and that too, through living at close quarters for years together. According to this conjecture, even if two different populations, say Americans and Japanese, were living together in the same area, but not within the same family, the individuals would not cross-infect one another. Okinawa island proved an ideal place to test this conjecture. No evidence was found that Japanese children were infected with American type JCV, although they had been living at the same island as the Americans. Since it is assumed now that JCV subtypes are virtually unique to each world area, it is now used to determine human migration patterns.

In 2020, tests around Kadena Air Base showed severe contamination of the wells and waterways of Dakujaku River and Hija river with toxic chemicals PFAS. This affects the drinking water of 450,000 residents. PFAS was used in foam at fire fighting training sites on U.S. facilities during the 1970s and 1980s.

=== Moving the bases ===
The 1971 Okinawa Reversion Agreement officially ended the U.S. military occupation on Okinawa. The bases primarily exist to serve Japanese and American strategic interests, despite recent efforts to move the bases out of core areas following incidents involving military personnel and resultant protests (including the 1995 Okinawa rape incident).

In 2012, an agreement was struck between the United States and Japan to reduce the number of U.S. military personnel on the island, moving 9,000 personnel to other locations and moving bases out of heavily populated Greater Naha, but 10,000 Marines will remain on the island, along with other U.S. military units. Attempts to completely close bases on the southern third of the island, where 90% of the population lives (all but about 120,000 people) have been impeded by both the American desire that alternative locations be found where bases subject to closure could move to (e.g. Henoko Peninsula, mid-island), as well as by local Okinawan opposition to any suggested locations on the island (who demand no U.S. troops at all anywhere on the island). Tokyo says the U.S. bases are important for national security. Locals complain that despite being home to less than 1% of Japan&#x27;s population and area, Okinawa hosts the majority of the U.S. military presence in Japan. In late December 2013, Governor Hirokazu Nakaima gave permission for land reclamation to begin for a new U.S. military base at Henoko, reneging on previous promises and furthering the effort to consolidate the American troop presence on the island, though away from urban Naha.

In December 2016 the U.S. returned of the Northern Training Area on Okinawa to Japan. This reduced the footprint of the U.S. forces by 20% on the island. It was the biggest land return since 1972.

<text>In geometry, a pentagonal icositetrahedron or pentagonal icosikaitetrahedron is a Catalan solid which is the dual of the snub cube. In crystallography it is also called a gyroid.

It has two distinct forms, which are mirror images (or &quot;enantiomorphs&quot;) of each other.

== Construction ==
The pentagonal icositetrahedron can be constructed from a snub cube without taking the dual. Square pyramids are added to the six square faces of the snub cube, and triangular pyramids are added to the eight triangular faces that do not share an edge with a square. The pyramid heights are adjusted to make them coplanar with the other 24 triangular faces of the snub cube. The result is the pentagonal icositetrahedron.

== Cartesian coordinates ==

Denote the tribonacci constant by formula_1. (See snub cube for a geometric explanation of the tribonacci constant.) Then Cartesian coordinates for the 38 vertices of a pentagonal icositetrahedron centered at the origin, are as follows:
*the 12 even permutations of with an even number of minus signs
*the 12 odd permutations of with an odd number of minus signs
*the 6 points , and 
*the 8 points 

The convex hulls for these vertices scaled by formula_2 result in a unit circumradius octahedron centered at the origin, a unit cube centered at the origin scaled to formula_3, and an irregular chiral snub cube scaled to formula_4, as visualized in the figure below:

== Geometry==
The pentagonal faces have four angles of formula_5 and one angle of formula_6. The pentagon has three short edges of unit length each, and two long edges of length formula_7. The acute angle is between the two long edges. The dihedral angle equals formula_8.

If its dual snub cube has unit edge length, its surface area and volume are:
:formula_9

==Orthogonal projections==
The &quot;pentagonal icositetrahedron&quot; has three symmetry positions, two centered on vertices, and one on midedge.

=== Variations===
Isohedral variations with the same chiral octahedral symmetry can be constructed with pentagonal faces having 3 edge lengths.

This variation shown can be constructed by adding pyramids to 6 square faces and 8 triangular faces of a snub cube such that the new triangular faces with 3 coplanar triangles merged into identical pentagon faces.
==Related polyhedra and tilings==

This polyhedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of polyhedra and tilings of pentagons with face configurations (V3.3.3.3.&quot;n&quot;). (The sequence progresses into tilings the hyperbolic plane to any &quot;n&quot;.) These face-transitive figures have (n32) rotational symmetry.
The &quot;pentagonal icositetrahedron &quot; is second in a series of dual snub polyhedra and tilings with face configuration V3.3.4.3.&quot;n&quot;.
The pentagonal icositetrahedron is one of a family of duals to the uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.

<doc id="725135" wikidata="Q242756" url="?curid=725135" title="Gonggong">
<text>Gonggong () is a Chinese water god who is depicted in Chinese mythology and folktales as having a copper human head with an iron forehead, red hair, and the body of a serpent, or sometimes the head and torso are human, with the tail of a serpent. He is destructive and is blamed for various cosmic catastrophes. In all accounts, Gonggong ends up being killed or sent into exile, usually after losing a struggle with another major deity such as the fire god Zhurong.

In astronomy, the dwarf planet 225088 Gonggong is named after Gonggong.

==Name==
In English, the two syllables of the name are the same. But in Mandarin, they differ in tone ( &quot;Gònggōng&quot;), and in other Chinese languages they differ in their vowel and the initial consonant as well (cf. Middle Chinese , also Japanese &quot;kyōkō&quot;). The most common variant of the name, , is identical to the first in English, but in Mandarin differs in tone (&quot;Gōnggōng&quot;), and in other Chinese languages in consonant and vowel as well (cf. Middle Chinese ). 

Gonggong&#x27;s personal name is said to be Kanghui (pronounced either in English, or as Mandarin &quot;Kānghuí&quot; ).

==Legend==
Gonggong is known from the late Warring States period (before 221 BC). Gonggong appears in the ancient &quot;Heavenly Questions&quot; (&quot;Tianwen&quot;) poem of the &quot;Chu Ci&quot;, where he is blamed for knocking the Earth&#x27;s axis off center, causing it to tilt to the southeast and the sky to tilt to the northwest. This axial tilt is used to explain why the rivers of China generally flow to the southeast, especially the Yangzi River and the Yellow River, and why the Sun, Moon, and stars move towards the northwest. Literature from the Han dynasty becomes much more detailed regarding Gonggong.

Gonggong was credited in various mythological contexts as being responsible for great floods, often in concert with his minister Xiangliu (a.k.a. Xiangyao), who has nine heads and the body of a snake.

Gonggong was ashamed that he lost the fight with Zhurong, the Chinese god of fire, to claim the throne of Heaven. In a fit of rage, he smashed his head against Buzhou Mountain, one of eight pillars holding up the sky, greatly damaging it and causing the sky to tilt towards the northwest and the Earth to shift to the southeast, which caused great floods and suffering. In one account of the myth, Gonggong kills himself in the process and fire comes out of the shattered mountain alongside floods.

The goddess Nüwa cut off the legs of the giant turtle Ao and used them in place of the fallen pillar, ending the floods and suffering; she was, however, unable to fully correct the tilted sky and Earth and alter their effects on the Sun, Moon, stars, and rivers in China.

<doc id="725136" wikidata="Q15980672" url="?curid=725136" title="National Labour Party (UK, 1957)">
<text>The National Labour Party (NLP) was a British neo-Nazi political party founded in 1957 by John Bean. The party campaigned on a platform of white nationalism, anti-Semitism, and opposition to non-white immigration.

==Formation==
Bean had been a leading figure within the League of Empire Loyalists (LEL), although he had become disillusioned with its emphasis on publicity stunts and lack of political action. The problem came to a head in 1957 after A.K. Chesterton sent Bean and Phil Burbidge to the home of Malcolm Muggeridge in order to throw soot on the commentator after he criticised Queen Elizabeth II on a TV show. Although the action was not carried out, for Bean it was a prime example of the pointless and childish activism with which the LEL had become synonymous and he soon wrote to Chesterton, bemoaning the weak campaigning of the LEL, its refusal to contest elections, its attachment to a narrow British nationalism and its strong links to the Conservative Party.

Soon after, Bean left the LEL along with John Tyndall to set up the new party, deliberately picking the name to appeal to Labour supporters who were put off by immigration. The nominal party President was to be Andrew Fountaine, although Bean&#x27;s role as policy director gave him effective control. Producing a journal named &quot;Combat&quot;, the NLP used its pages to campaign for a reduction in the sentences of those convicted over the 1958 Notting Hill race riots.

==Electoral activity==
A very small party, the NLP secured some decent results in the London council election, although the Labour Party objected to the NLP&#x27;s use of its name. At the time, however, ballot papers listed only the names of the candidates, not the names of the parties, so it was probably less likely than it would be today that Labour voters might vote for the NLP by mistake. Buoyed by its minor success, the party organised a &quot;Stop the Coloured Invasion&quot; rally in Trafalgar Square with banners displayed proclaiming &quot;Keep Britain White&quot; in May 1959 which drew a crowd of 3,000 to hear speeches by Bean, Fountaine and White Defence League leader Colin Jordan. The monitors at the rally wore white armbands emblazoned with a black sun wheel, the symbol of the Aryan race.

The party was even briefly linked to the London gangster Albert Dimes, who hoped to use NLP members against his rival, Jack Como (alias Jack Spot), a Jewish gangster who was involved in funding the 43 Group, an anti-fascist group set up by Jewish ex-servicemen. Other 43 Group funders included the boxing promoter Jack Solomons, the businessman Sir Charles Clore and Bud Flanagan, the music hall entertainer, who sent a £30 cheque every month.

The party stood a single candidate in the 1959 general election with former boxer Bill Webster running in St Pancras North. The decision to run a candidate was largely driven by the realities of racial tension in the area, as exposed by the previous year&#x27;s riots. During the campaign, a number of NLP supporters attacked a meeting at the local Town Hall where Kenneth Robinson was a featured speaker. A number of arrests were made over the incident, which made national news and thus served to publicise the name of the NLP. In the election, the party received 4.1% of the vote in St Pancras North, and lost its deposit.

==Election results==
===House of Commons===
==Decline==
The aftermath of the event, however, was the decline of the NLP. Bean served 30 days in jail for his part in the riot and whilst he was incarcerated Webster left to join the Union Movement and Tyndall also resigned from the party. With the NLP demoralised and closer links to Colin Jordan having been developed, the party merged with the White Defence League on 24 February 1960. Although the name Racial Nationalist Party was initially considered it was ultimately decided to name the new entity the British National Party.

==Return of the name==
In 1981, National Front activist John King, the candidate for Rochester and Chatham in the 1979 election, broke from that group and formed his own minor party also using the name National Labour Party. This version, which was not connected to Bean&#x27;s, took a Powellite line on immigration although it was significantly less economically neo-liberal than Powell. This group contested two elections, the 1983 Bermondsey by-election and the Ashford constituency in the 1983 general election, without making any impact.

<text>The White Defence League (WDL) was a British neo-Nazi political party. Using the provocative marching techniques popularised by Oswald Mosley, its members included John Tyndall.

==Formation==
The WDL had its roots in Colin Jordan&#x27;s decision to split from the League of Empire Loyalists in 1957. Jordan had wanted a ban on Jews and non-white members enshrined in the League but this had been rejected by League chief A. K. Chesterton, due to the group&#x27;s links to the Conservative Party. Jordan further called for the building of a mass party but this too was rejected due to the Tory links. At the time Jordan was also close to the Britons Publishing Society and both groups ran out of Arnold Leese House, the name given to 74 Princedale Road, the Notting Hill home of the late Imperial Fascist League leader which Leese&#x27;s widow Mary allowed Jordan to use as his base of operations. Mary Leese also provided most of the group&#x27;s funding. Because of this shared space with the Britons the WDL was able to publish its own magazine, &quot;Black and White News&quot;, as soon the group was founded, and it reached a circulation of around 800 with a focus on anti-immigration rhetoric. A further WDL paper, &quot;The Nationalist&quot;, appeared in 1959, focusing more on antisemitism and the desire for racial purity.

==Ideology==
Unlike the LEL, which stressed British identity and patriotism, the WDL was fairly open in its admiration for Adolf Hitler and Nazism. Seeking to distance itself from LEL conservatism and to build links with like-minded groups in continental Europe, the party&#x27;s journals became notorious for their rabid racial hatred. By personal conviction Jordan&#x27;s main belief was in antisemitism but, whilst the WDL did stress the Jews as an enemy &quot;out-group&quot;, the League also emphasised anti-immigration rhetoric. However the WDL has been contrasted with the Union Movement, a contemporary group led by Oswald Mosley as, whilst the Union Movement had a coherent ideology that sought to remodel pre-Second World War fascism, the WDL was more crudely racist and had a much less developed political programme. Hans-Georg Betz has characterised the WDL as part of a tendency within British fascist extremism to place a &quot;&quot;recidivist&quot; or &quot;radical&quot; neo-nazism&quot; as the ideological core rather than the populism of Scandinavian protest parties or the &quot;&quot;hybrid&quot; appeal&quot; that fuses elements of fascism to populism typified by the likes the Front National (italics are after Betz).

==Activities==
The WDL gained notoriety after members of the group were widely reported in the press as having taken part in the 1958 Notting Hill race riots. Indeed, during that summer the WDL held rallies through immigrant neighbourhoods on a nightly basis. Towards the end of the riots Antiguan immigrant Kelso Cochrane was murdered and local black opinion often suggested that the WDL was responsible although ultimately no one was arrested for the killing. Like the Union Movement, which was also active in the local area, the WDL co-operated with gangs of racist Teddy boys who harassed and launched attacks on blacks in the area. Indeed, in the run-up to the riots followers of the Union Movement and the WDL had come into immigrant neighbourhoods in the area to indulge in what they called &quot;nigger hunts&quot;.

In 1959 the WDL began to co-operate with the National Labour Party, a group led by another former LEL dissident John Bean which was also active in Notting Hill. The WDL helped Bean&#x27;s group with their election campaigns and the two groups held a joint rally called &quot;Stop the Coloured Invasion&quot; in Trafalgar Square in May 1959 with banners that read &quot;Keep Britain White&quot;. Some marchers wore armbands containing the WDL logo; a white sun wheel within a red circle on a dark blue background. Jordan, who had developed a network of international contacts through &quot;The Nationalist&quot;, impressed both Bean and Andrew Fountaine and in February 1960 the two groups fused to form the British National Party, which was also to be based at Arnold Leese House.

<text>Awjila (also &quot;Aujila&quot;, &quot;Augila&quot;, &quot;Aoudjila&quot;, &quot;Awgila&quot;, &quot;Awdjila&quot;; own name: Jlan n Awilen; in other Berber varieties Tawjilit) is a severely endangered (considered &quot;moribund&quot; by &quot;Ethnologue&quot;) Eastern Berber language spoken in Cyrenaica, Libya, in the Awjila oasis. Due to the political situation in Libya, immediate data on the language has been inaccessible. However, Facebook postings by speakers and younger semi-speakers have provided some recent supplementary data.

==General information==

Awjila is a member of the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic language family, of the Eastern Berber subgroup. It is closely related to the extinct Sokna language of Libya and is considerably endangered, with an estimated 2,000–3,000 native speakers remaining. UNESCO considers Awjila to be seriously endangered as the youngest speakers have reached or passed middle age.

The Berber languages of Libya faced severe oppression during the period of Muammar Gaddafi, which has likely been the cause of the demise of some varieties such as Sokna and the endangerment of others, including Awjila and Ghadames. The usage of Berber/Amazigh languages was effectively prohibited, and Gaddafi completely denied the existence of the Imazighen people, reportedly saying, &quot;call yourselves whatever you want inside your homes – Berbers, children of Satan, whatever – but you are only Libyans when you leave your homes&quot;. He denied the existence of Berbers as a separate ethnicity, and called Berbers a &quot;product of colonialism&quot; created by the West to divide Libya. He repeatedly targeted Amazigh rights activists (including linguists from abroad), to which can be attributed the lack of current and updated information on the Libyan Berber languages and the relatively limited content available, even in Arabic, on the Internet (as opposed to the more extensive resources found on Moroccan and Algerian Amazigh varieties). The language is, however, used on Facebook by some Awjili members.

==History of scholarship==

Because of the political issues in Libya, field work on Awjila has been limited. The earliest studies of the language were carried out by Müller in 1827, however, his work is difficult to analyze because there were no standard conventions such as the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) for transcribing it at that time and because he failed to make distinctions for various sounds in Awjila (such the difference between as emphatic, pharyngeal consonants and their non-emphatic counterparts). Moritz von Beurmann also contributed a short word list but some forms contradict information found in later sources. The latest field work was done by Umberto Paradisi in 1960, whose data (in the form of texts) have become the basis for all future studies of the language, particularly that of contemporary scholar Marijn van Putten who has taken up the study of Awjila and other Eastern Berber varieties. Van Putten, who has published extensively on the language, relies heavily on the work of Paradisi and has used it to compile a dictionary and a grammar within his 2014 book &quot;A Grammar of Awjila Berber&quot;.

==Writing system==

Although historically Libyco-Berber languages were written with the Tifinagh alphabet between second century BCE and third century CE, Aujila and other Amazigh languages have remained oral for most of their modern existence. In recent times most Amazigh languages are written in either Latin or Arabic script, although attempts to revive the Amazigh languages and cultures have led to the reintroduction of a &quot;neo-Tifinagh&quot; script in several domains. Nevertheless, Gaddafi had banned the script during the 42-years of his regime and therefore it is unlikely that the few Awjila speakers make any significant use of it.

==Phonology==

Awjila has several interesting phonological features that set it apart from most other varieties of Berber. A few notable distinctions are listed below: (Van Putten)

# Retention of Proto-Berber as the rather than being lost as in most other modern varieties.
# Loss of the pharyngealized voiced dental stop and entirely replaced it with the voiceless variant. Example: Awjila &quot;avəṭ&quot; vs. Tachelhit: &quot;iḍ&quot; meaning night.
# Retention of velar stop where most Berber varieties have replaced it with palatal approximant . Example: Awjila: &quot;təkəmmušt&quot; vs. Tachelhit: &quot;taymmust&quot; meaning bundle
# Palatalization of and to (written as š) and (written as ž) 
# Dominance of the vowel and seeming shift from the vowel of other varieties to i

==Morphology and syntax==

Awjila also has several distinguishing features in the domains of morphology and syntax:

# Lacks overt case-marking that has been retained in other Berber varieties.
# Lacks clitic-fronting
# Clitic –a is used with the present to express a resultative state, a feature shared only by the easternmost Berber variety, Siwa

==Status==

Due to the already dwindled population of Awjila speakers and the continued political strife in post-Arab Spring Libya, the future of this language seems grim. Although researchers at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) and the president of the Congrès Mondial Amazigh have confirmed that speakers of the language still remain, all of the known speakers have been advanced in age, suggesting that younger generations are not learning Awjila.

<text>Sokna (also &quot;Sawknah&quot;, &quot;Sukna&quot;; native name: Tasuknit) is a presumably extinct Eastern Berber language which was spoken in the town of Sokna (&quot;Isuknan&quot;) and the village of Fuqaha in northeastern Fezzan in Libya. According to Václav Blažek (1999), Sokna was also spoken in the oasis of Tmassa.

The most extensive and recent materials on it are Sarnelli (1924) for Sokna and Paradisi (1963) for El-Fogaha. Both articles report that the language was spoken only by a handful of old people at the time, so it is generally presumed to be extinct.

Aikhenvald &amp; Militarev (1984) and Blench (2006) consider Sokna and Fezzan to be separate languages. Blench lists Tmessa and Al-Foqaha as dialects of Fezzan.

<text>John Edward Bean (27 June 1927 – 9 November 2021) was a British political activist and writer, who was a long-standing participant in far-right politics in the United Kingdom, and a number of its movements.

==Early life==
Born in Carshalton, Surrey, at the age of 13 he suffered the trauma of being bombed out with his family living in Blackfen, Sidcup, February 1941. Bean said that he briefly flirted with communism whilst at school, calling for support for the Soviet Union. His initial fervour soon faded and by the time he began his National service in 1945, Bean was largely apolitical. Initially he was a trainee navigator in the RAF Volunteer Reserve and later as a sailor in the Royal Navy. Bean became a radar mechanic and was placed on HMS Bulawayo, a fleet supply ship which made several visits to Trinidad until the end of his naval service in June 1948. He briefly lived in India during 1950, working as a chemist in a paint factory, although he failed to settle and returned to Britain six months later.

==Politics==
===Union Movement===
Upon his return, Bean began to attend meetings of the Union Movement, being attracted by the Europe a Nation policy and by the time Oswald Mosley had spent in prison for his beliefs. Bean initially served as a member of the Special Propaganda Service, the main duty of which was to sell copies of the party&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Union&quot;. Soon however he became a leading figure active on behalf of the UM in the East End of London, before being appointed to head a branch in Putney in 1952. Despite these advancements, Bean grew disillusioned of the UM&#x27;s chances of making any real headway and he left them altogether in February 1953. A brief stopover in the local Conservative Party in Barnes followed but lasted only two months.

===National Labour Party and BNP===
After a spell on the sidelines he then linked up with Andrew Fountaine, who had been attempting to form his own party, the National Front, and began to produce a journal, &quot;National Unity&quot;. His work attracted the attention of A.K. Chesterton and, with the National Front idea failing to get off the ground, he decided to join the League of Empire Loyalists, serving as its Northern Organiser and then in the HQ in London. Continuing to produce his paper, now called &quot;The Loyalist&quot;, Bean soon became frustrated at both the lack of political activity and the links to the Conservative Party that were the hallmarks of the LEL, and so left in 1957 to set up the National Labour Party with Fountaine. Fountaine, a Norfolk landowner from a rural landowning family, was officially President of the new group, but was largely a figurehead: control actually lay with Bean.

The NLP gained a few minor results in elections, but was always destined to be a small fringe movement, and as a result Bean decided to merge his party with another LEL splinter group, the White Defence League, in 1960 to form the British National Party. Bean was made leader of the party upon its foundation. Early in the group&#x27;s life, both Bean and former White Defence League leader Colin Jordan were approached by Oswald Mosley, who offered them roles in his Union Movement if they agreed to its subsuming the BNP, but both men rejected the offer.

Initially gaining some support in London, the party soon ran into trouble when it became clear that Colin Jordan was emerging as its spokesman. A journalist commented in 1962 that Jordan was becoming the British Adolf Hitler. Bean jokingly responded to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; reporter that that made him &quot;the British Joseph Goebbels&quot;. Despite this, Bean soon clashed with Jordan over his extremism and before long Jordan had left to form the National Socialist Movement, taking emerging figures John Tyndall and Denis Pirie with him. Matters had come to a head at the party&#x27;s national council meeting in 1962 when Bean proposed a motion to condemn Jordan&#x27;s open support for Nazism. It was passed 7 to 5, but the party immediately split as a result, albeit with around 80% of the membership remaining within the BNP. Bean had blamed the associations with Nazism that Jordan and Tyndall brought for the party&#x27;s marginal position in British politics.

At the 1964 general election Bean stood as BNP candidate in Southall and obtained 3,410 votes (9.3%), the highest post-war vote for a minority party at that time. Another BNP candidate picked up nearly 2,000 votes in Deptford. In 1966 he again stood in Southall but his vote fell to 2,600. With BNP membership only marginally increasing, Bean felt the need to try to create a nationalist front with like groups and arranged, with the help of Ted Budden, a private meeting with his old mentor A.K. Chesterton and a spokesman of the Racial Preservation Society. The result of the meeting was the founding of the National Front in 1967.

===NF and political retirement===
Bean became something of a peripheral figure in the NF, as the BNP element was somewhat sidelined. He held the post of Deputy Chairman of the Executive Directorate, a body which was largely subordinate to the Policy Directorate, and stood as second candidate for the Ealing constituency in the 1967 Greater London Council elections until resigning in 1968. Still an NF member, he was recalled to positions of minor influence from time to time until 1972 when he largely ceased active involvement. Retreating into political retirement, his membership lapsed in 1977 and he emerged only briefly to lend some support to his old friend Andrew Fountaine&#x27;s Constitutional Movement and to take part in the Countryside Alliance march of 1 March 1998.

During this period he wrote two books. &quot;Ten Miles From Anywhere&quot; (Hedgerow Publishing 1995), looked at the changes in a Suffolk village from the beginning of the 20th century. &quot;Many Shades of Black&quot;, (New Millennium 1999), was Bean&#x27;s political memoires up to that date. He subsequently wrote a novel &quot;Blood in the Square&quot; which fictionalized some of his political experiences in the 1960s. In August 2016 his historical novel &quot;Trail of the Viking Finger&quot; was published by Troubador Publications.

===Bean in the BNP and BDP===
Bean eventually ended his retirement after the political fall of John Tyndall and joined the British National Party under the leadership of Nick Griffin. He became an active official of the BNP (mostly in administration) and was a candidate for the party in the 2004 European elections, where he was seventh on a list of seven candidates for the Scotland constituency. He formerly ran his own website, but then wrote a regular column for the main BNP website, and served as editor of BNP magazine &quot;Identity&quot; until March 2010.

Due to dissatisfaction with his leadership, Bean demanded that Griffin resign as National Chairman and focus more on the North West region.

In May 2011, Bean endorsed Andrew Brons (the BNP MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber). He made significant contributions to the Brons team web site, including articles on &quot;Genetics and Inheritance&quot; and &quot; Nationalism and a European Confederation&quot;. He subsequently became involved in Brons&#x27;s party the British Democratic Party, established in February 2013.

==Personal life==
Bean lived in North Yorkshire in later years. He died on 9 November 2021, at the age of 94. An obituary on the white nationalist website &quot;Counter-Currents&quot; stated that he was survived by his wife of 72 years, Marion, as well as his son and daughter.

<doc id="725172" wikidata="Q297457" url="?curid=725172" title="Ruy López de Segura">
<text>Rodrigo &quot;Ruy&quot; López de Segura ( – c. 1580) was a Spanish chess player, author, and Catholic priest whose 1561 treatise &quot;Libro de la invención liberal y Arte del juego del Axedrez&quot; was one of the first books about modern chess in Europe. He made great contributions to chess opening theory, including in the King&#x27;s Gambit and the Ruy López (or Spanish) opening that bears his name. López was also the strongest player in Spain for about 20 years.

== Life ==
López was a native of Segura de León, a town in Extremadura, Spain. In 1559, while living in Zafra, López was called to Rome by Pope Pius IV on ecclesiastical business. During his stay in Rome, López played chess with the locals. He apparently acquitted himself well, although the only account of these games is given in a single sentence by López himself. One of those players was &quot;Il Puttino&quot;, an epithet for a young Leonardo di Bona. 
López also learned the term &quot;gambit&quot; from the Italian players.

In Italy López encountered Pedro Damiano&#x27;s treatise on chess, &quot;Questo libro e da imparare giocare a scachi et de li partiti&quot;, but did not find much value in it. This may have inspired López to write his own book, &quot;Libro de la Invencion liberal y Arte del juego del Axedrez&quot;, which was published in 1561.

López was the strongest player in Spain for nearly twenty years; his nearest rivals were Alfonso Ceron (of Granada) and Medrano. López and Ceron played before King Philip II of Spain, impressing him enough for López to earn a benefice and a golden chain displaying a rook. López was also esteemed for his ability at blindfold chess.

Alessandro Salvio writes that López travelled to Rome again in 1572. It is more probable, however, that López visited Rome only once (in 1559) and that Salvio&#x27;s chronology is incorrect. 

Around the year 1574, López was still at the royal court in Spain when di Bona, then Paolo Boi, arrived on their tours of Europe. Their meetings – which also included Ceron – are sometimes considered the first international chess tournament. Boi and a much-improved di Bona defeated López and Ceron in Madrid, in the presence of Philip II. López was again able to best Ceron.

The years of López&#x27;s birth and death can be estimated only very approximately; a lifespan of ca. 1530–1580 is commonly given without evidence. He was likely born before 1534, and lived until at least the 1574 contest.

== Legacy ==
Ruy López&#x27;s contribution to chess was mainly to its opening theory; Peter J. Monté has described him as the &quot;father of opening theory&quot;. His analysis of the King&#x27;s Gambit in particular went well beyond earlier writing such as Damiano&#x27;s. He also was the strongest player in Spain, and possibly Italy, for about twenty years. As Andrew Soltis describes: &quot;At that time, the best players of modern-rules chess lived in Italy and Iberia. López is believed to have easily beaten the most skilled Italians. He may deserve the title of world champion, but that title did not exist until the late nineteenth century.&quot;

López&#x27;s reputation suffered from the writings of the Modenese Masters. Ponziani described López as unfruitful, unmethodical, and having made little advance on Damiano. H.J.R Murray argues, however, that the Masters&#x27; criticism of López is unfair and likely stems from his play&#x27;s resemblance to Philidor&#x27;s, who was their school&#x27;s great rival:

=== &quot;Libro de la Invencion liberal y Arte del juego del Axedrez&quot; ===

Ruy López&#x27;s surviving treatise, which is fully titled &quot;Libro de la Invencion liberal y Arte del juego del Axedrez, por Ruy-López de Sigura, clerigo, vezino de la villago Cafra. Digirida al muy Illustre Señor Don Garcia de Toledo, ayo y mayordomo del serenissimo principe Don Carlos nuestro Señor.&quot;, was published in 1561.

López divided his book into four parts (&quot;books&quot;). He first presents several mythological origins of the game, and discusses its benefits, rules, and strategies while interspersing a number of quotes (in Latin) from classical authors. The second part focuses on openings and is López&#x27;s legacy as &quot;the father of opening theory.&quot; Third comes a hostile appraisal of Damiano&#x27;s opening analysis. López&#x27;s final chapters are devoted to odds chess, where he again criticizes Damiano&#x27;s approaches to these games.

In this work López presents sixty-six games, of which twenty-four were taken from Damiano&#x27;s 1512 book. According to J.H. Sarartt, López&#x27;s games are of a lower quality than those in Damiano&#x27;s work. He admits that they might nevertheless be more instructive, since López gives a larger number of variations. Other authors have given varying opinions about the quality of López&#x27;s analysis.

López only rarely presented variations that ended in checkmate. Instead he concluded lines with comments such as how black must lose his queen, or that white has a very good game.

=== Example games ===

Not many games can be confidently attributed to López, and those that can are incomplete. One such game was recorded by Polerio, and was played during the contests between Italians and Spaniards before King Philip II:

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.c3 Qe7 5.b4 Bb6 6.a4 a6 7.Ba3 d6 8.Qe2 Bg4 9.d3 Nf6 10.Nbd2

Among the analysis Ruy López gives in his treatise is an example of the opening that bears his name. López contends that the following line proves black should avoid the &quot;Ruy López&quot; by playing 2... d6 instead of 2... Nc6.

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Bc5 4.c3 d6 5.d4 exd4 6.cxd4 Bb4+ 7.Nc3 Bd7 8.Bf4 Nf6 9.Qd3 Bxc3+ 10.bxc3

López also gives a number of variations of the King&#x27;s Gambit, such as:

1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.e5 Qe7 5.Qe2 Nh5 6.Nc3 c6 7.Ne4

<text>Richard Coad (13 February 1825 – 1 November 1900) was a 19th-century Cornish architect.

Born in Liskeard, Cornwall, he was articled to Henry Rice of Liskeard and subsequently worked as assistant to Sir George Gilbert Scott from 1847 to 1864. He was clerk of works on the Albert Memorial in London, and worked under Scott&#x27;s supervision on improvements to Lanhydrock House near Bodmin in 1857.

He returned to Liskeard in 1864 to open his own independent practice, and opened a London office in 1868.

When the building at Lanhydrock was severely damaged by fire in 1881, Coad returned to the site to rebuild the house to accommodate the 2nd Baron Robartes&#x27;s large family.

From 1884 to 1887, Coad worked in association with James Marjoribanks MacLaren, who had been his assistant for some years. The pair worked on an extension to Ledbury Park in Herefordshire, an important work in the development of the Arts and Crafts architectural style in England.

He died in Battersea, London in 1900, and was buried in West Norwood Cemetery.

<text>The League of Resident Theatres (LORT) is a collective bargaining association with over 70 non-profit theatre members in the U.S. LORT members. LORT serves as a way for member resident theaters, also called regional theaters, to bargain collectively on behalf of theater management with Actors&#x27; Equity Association, the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society, and United Scenic Artists.

LORT was formed by the largest of regional theatres to combat unions. Membership is restricted to US theatres considered as &quot;non-profit&quot; by the Internal Revenue Service

==History==
The League of Resident Theatres was formally established on 18 March 1966 by Peter Zeisler, managing director of the Minnesota Theatre Company (a.k.a. the Guthrie Theater), Thomas Fichandler, general manager of Arena Stage, and Morris Kaplan, an attorney. Peter Zeisler was appointed the first president, with Thomas Finchandler as vice president and William Bushnell, manager of Baltimore&#x27;s Center Stage, as secretary. There were 26 member theaters at the organization&#x27;s founding. Until then resident theater troupes negotiated individual contracts with Equity; most of them used modifications of commercial theater contracts. In some instances the theaters operated under the terms of Equity&#x27;s new stock contract, however, resident theater managers have long felt burdened by what they call Equity&#x27;s &quot;one production&quot; type of contract used on Broadway.

<doc id="725182" wikidata="Q599151" url="?curid=725182" title="Official">
<text>An official is someone who holds an office (function or mandate, regardless of whether it carries an actual working space with it) in an organization or government and participates in the exercise of authority (either their own or that of their superior or employer, public or legally private). An elected official is a person who is an official by virtue of an election. Officials may also be appointed &quot;ex officio&quot; (by virtue of another office, often in a specified capacity, such as presiding, advisory, secretary). Some official positions may be inherited. A person who currently holds an office is referred to as an incumbent. Something &quot;official&quot; refers to something endowed with governmental or other authoritative recognition or mandate, as in official language, official gazette, or official scorer.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;official&quot; as a noun has been recorded since the Middle English period, first seen in 1314. It comes from the Old French &#x27; (12th century), from the Latin &#x27; (&quot;attendant to a magistrate, government official&quot;), the noun use of the original adjective &#x27; (&quot;of or belonging to duty, service, or office&quot;) from &#x27; (&quot;office&quot;). The meaning &quot;person in charge of some public work or duty&quot; was first recorded in 1555. The adjective is first attested in English in 1533 via the Old French &quot;&quot;. The informal term &quot;officialese&quot;, the jargon of &quot;officialdom&quot;, was first recorded in 1884.

==Roman antiquity==
An &#x27; (plural &#x27;) was the official term (somewhat comparable to a modern civil servant) for any member of the (staff) of a high dignitary such as a governor.

==Ecclesiastical judiciary==

In canon law, the word or its Latin original is used absolutely as the legal title of a diocesan bishop&#x27;s judicial vicar who shares the bishop&#x27;s ordinary judicial power over the diocese and presides over the diocesan ecclesiastical court.

The 1983 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot; gives precedence to the title judicial vicar, rather than that of (canon 1420). The &quot;Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches&quot; uses only the title judicial vicar (canon 191).

In German, the related noun &quot;&quot; was also used for an official bureau in a diocese that did much of its administration, comprising the vicariate-general, an adjoined secretariat, a registry office and a chancery.

In Catholicism, the vicar-general was originally called the &quot;official&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

The title of official principal, together with that of vicar-general, has in Anglicanism been merged in that of diocesan chancellor of a diocese.

==Sports==
In sports, the term official is used to describe a person enforcing playing rules in the capacity of an assistant referee, referee and umpire; also specified by the discipline, e.g. American football official, ice hockey official. An official competition is created or recognized as valid by the competent body, is agreed to or arranged by people in positions of authority. It is synonymous, among others, with approved, certified, recognized, endorsed, and legitimate.

==Other==
The term &quot;officer&quot; is close to being a synonym (but has more military connotations). A functionary is someone who carries out a particular role within an organization; this again is quite a close synonym for official, as a noun, but with connotations closer to bureaucrat. Any such person acts in their official capacity, in carrying out the duties of their office; they are also said to officiate, for example, in a ceremony. A public official is an official of central or local government.

==Max Weber on bureaucratic officials==

Max Weber gave as definition of a bureaucratic official:
*they are personally free and appointed to their position on the basis of conduct
*he exercises the authority delegated to them in accordance with impersonal rules, and their loyalty is enlisted on behalf of the faithful execution of their official duties
*their appointment and job placement are dependent upon their technical qualifications
*their administrative work is a full-time occupation
*their work is rewarded by a regular salary and prospects of advancement in a lifetime career.

An official must exercise their judgment and their skills, but their duty is to place these at the service of a higher authority; ultimately they are responsible only for the impartial execution of assigned tasks and must sacrifice their personal judgment if it runs counter to their official duties.

==Adjective==
As an adjective, &quot;official&quot; often, but not always, means pertaining to the government, as state employee or having state recognition, or analogous to governance or to a formal (especially legally regulated) proceeding as opposed to informal business. In summary, that has authenticity emanates from an authority. Some examples:

*An &quot;official holiday&quot; is a public holiday, having national (or regional) recognition. 
*An official language is a language recognised by a government, for its own use in administration, or for delivering services to its citizens (for example, on signposts). 
*An &quot;official spokesperson&quot; is an individual empowered to speak for the government, or some part of it such as a ministry, on a range of issues and on the record for the media. 
*An &quot;official statement&quot; is an issued by an organisation as an expression of its corporate position or opinion; an &quot;official apology&quot; is an apology similarly issued by an organisation (as opposed to an apology by an individual). 
*&quot;Official policy&quot; is policy publicly acknowledged and defended by an organisation. In these cases &quot;unofficial&quot; is an antonym, and variously may mean informal, unrecognised, personal or unacknowledged. 
*An &quot;official strike&quot; is a strike organised and recognised by a labour union, as opposed to an &quot;unofficial strike&quot; at grassroots level.
*An &quot;official school&quot; is a school administered by the government or by a local authority, as opposite to a private school or religious school.
*An &quot;official history&quot;, for example of an institution or business, or particularly of a war or military unit, is a history written as a commission, with the assumption of co-operation with access to records and archives; but without necessarily full editorial independence.
*An &quot;official biography&quot; is usually on the same lines, written with access to private papers and the support of the family of the subject.

<text>An official history is a work of history which is sponsored, authorised or endorsed by its subject. The term is most commonly used for histories which are produced for a government. The term also applies to commissions from non-state bodies including histories of commercial companies. An official biography (one written with the permission, cooperation and sometimes the participation of its subject or heirs) is an authorised biography.

Official histories frequently have the advantage that the author has had access to archives, been allowed to interview subjects and use other primary sources closed to independent historians. Because of the close relationship between author and subject, such works may be (or be perceived to be) partisan in tone and to lack historical objectivity. Such bias varies and some official histories have been called exercises in propaganda; in other cases the authors have retained a measure of independence.

==Early official histories==

There is a tradition of history written or published under official patronage; Polydore Vergil wrote the (drafted by 1513 and published in 1534), a history of England, at the request of King Henry VII (); William Camden&#x27;s (1615–1627), recounts the history of the reign of Elizabeth I of England (1558–1603). In early-modern Europe, royal courts appointed official historians, including the (Historiographer Royal) in the kingdom of Denmark–Norway from 1594, the in Sweden from 1618, the Historiographer Royal in England from 1660 and the Historiographer Royal in Scotland from 1681.

Each book in the &quot;Twenty-Four Histories&quot; records the official history of a Chinese dynasty. Sixteen of the histories were written between the 7th and 15th centuries. The first is &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, authored by Sima Qian (– BCE) in the Han dynasty and the last is &quot;History of Ming&quot; (completed in the 1730s). From the Tang dynasty (618–907) a government office for historiography compiled official histories. They were revised and expanded by the compilers during the dynasty and the succeeding dynasty published a final edition.

==Modern official histories==

The modern form of official history began in the mid-nineteenth century in reports written as military guides for later officers. The histories were detailed descriptions of events, not easy reading for a lay audience and left judgements to the discretion of a mainly professional readership. After the First World War, the New Zealand government decided that after a total war, its official histories should be written for a public who had fought in the war or supported the war effort. After the Second World War, the low academic standard of military education, especially in historical analysis, led to a view that professionally trained historians should write official histories, applying their academic training to explain why as well as describe what. Since many of the academics had participated in the war, they could be expected to have experience of military service and knowledge of the war to inform their writing. A contemporary view is that official history should incorporate the three points of view, containing the detailed description needed for works of military instruction but also to be suitable for a general readership and to show how participants tried to solve problems, drawing lessons from their successes and failures. None of the points of view to be served by the production of official history is immune to error, because work by a military historian might be fraudulent for personal or political reasons, distorting the record. Populist history can dilute the story to the point of worthlessness and civilian academics can be prone to select facts and interpretations according to ideals, ideology and preconceived ideas.

Military histories written as textbooks might be thought to have a basis in truth, necessary to teach useful lessons to students. The British &quot;Report of the Committee on the Lessons of the Great War&quot; (Kirk Report, 1931) drew on the published volumes of the British official history and the conclusions were incorporated into a new edition of &quot;Field Service Regulations&quot;. That operations might be conducted in Iraq and Iran, led to official history volumes being produced against the objections of the Foreign Office. Military histories concentrated on the doings of national contingents, with only rare references to those of allied and opposing armies, since they had their own histories. Comparative analysis can be absent and national bias from ulterior motives, like mythologising and apologetics can also be found. The Australian &quot;Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918&quot; edited by Charles Bean contains exaggerations of the significance of the Australian contribution, the prowess of Australian soldiers and disparagement of soldiers from Britain and its allies. Australian failures and casualties are sometimes blamed on British higher commanders, when high-ranking Australian officers could justly be criticised. The post-war Royal Air Force (RAF) was at risk of abolition and to justify its existence needed a function that could not be replicated by the army or navy. The parts of &quot;The War in the Air&quot; (six text volumes and an appendix volume, 1922–1937) written by Walter Raleigh and Henry Jones, gave undue emphasis to strategic bombing, which unbalanced the work.

Embarrassing events can be disguised by underwriting as happened in , where the French Army Mutinies of 1917 occurred in of the French Army, yet were passed over in a few paragraphs in . Many of the historians, editors and contributors to the &quot;History of the Great War&quot; (1915–1949) had been senior officers during the war, which had the advantage first-hand knowledge of events and experience of military art for the work but this risked allowing a desire to protect reputations to intrude, leading to unfair blame, particularly on outsiders. Volume III of the Royal Navy history &quot;Naval Operations&quot; (1923) had the narrative of the Battle of Jutland (1916) and the draft text was revised at the request of some serving officers present at the battle, to remove critical remarks about them. When a revised edition was published in 1940, many of the officers were retired or dead but the excised passages were not restored. The British Army &quot;Military Operations...&quot; volumes have been criticised for dishonesty in not blaming General Headquarters (GHQ) for the extent of British casualties and for exculpating Sir Douglas Haig (commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) from December 1915 to the Armistice). That the history is a description of events, rather than an analytical work with criticism and conclusions, means that Haig and other commanders may escape blame, yet it leaves the reader free to form conclusions.

<text>Major-General William Phillips ( – 13 May 1781) was a British Army officer who served in the Royal Artillery during the American War of Independence.

== Early career ==

Phillips entered the academy at Woolwich and eventually joined the Royal Artillery. His service at the Battle of Minden led to a reputation as an excellent officer. By the outbreak of the American War of Independence he had risen to the rank of colonel in the British Army. He served as the Commander of Artillery at Woolwich and Lieutenant Governor of Windsor Castle, and was eventually elected as MP for Boroughbridge.

== American War of Independence ==

Phillips was promoted to the rank of Major-General and sent to Quebec in 1776, along with his friends General Henry Clinton and General John Burgoyne, to be the commander of all artillery in the province. Governor Sir Guy Carleton put him in charge of the shipyard at St. John&#x27;s where, along with Captain Sir Charles Douglas, he supervised the building of the small fleet of ships that fought the Americans under Benedict Arnold at the Battle of Valcour Island. He later took part in the recapture of Fort Ticonderoga, where he stated, &quot;Where a goat can go, a man can go. And where a man can go, he can drag a gun.&quot;
As part of Burgoyne&#x27;s army, he was captured at Saratoga in 1777. He is depicted in the painting of the &quot;Surrender of General Burgoyne&quot; by John Trumbull.
He was then a part of the Convention Army until he was exchanged for American General Benjamin Lincoln in 1780. While a prisoner in Virginia, he was one of the British officers who was entertained at the home of Thomas Jefferson. After the exchange he was able to fight once again, and was sent by Clinton from New York to meet up with Brigadier General Benedict Arnold (who was now on the British side) in Virginia.

While on his way to link up with General Cornwallis, he contracted either typhus or malaria, and became so ill that Arnold had to lead his men. He died on 13 May 1781 at Petersburg, Virginia, five months before Yorktown, and is buried there near Blandford Church.

As he lay gravely ill, in the home belonging to the Bolling family known as Bollingbrook, British forces in Petersburg were being shelled by the Marquis de Lafayette&#x27;s cannons positioned in the heights north of the river, today known as Colonial Heights, Virginia. His final words — uttered after a shell struck the home and killed an African-American servant named Molly — are reputed to have been &quot;Won&#x27;t that boy let me die in peace?&quot; He and Molly were said to have been buried together, to prevent identification. Thomas Jefferson described him as &quot;the proudest man of the proudest nation on earth&quot;.

<text>Drapers is a business-to-business magazine and website covering the fashion retail sector. It was founded on 6 August 1887 to cover the women&#x27;s clothing retail trade, but today spans the whole fashion retail sector, including wider retail issues such as digital transformation, technological advances and the management of supply chains.

Drapers also hosts a series of conferences, events and awards ceremonies throughout the year to recognize the best-performing businesses and to share learnings.

The publication is owned by Metropolis.

== History ==

&quot;Drapers&quot; was founded on 6 August 1887. Former editors of the magazine and website have included Freddie Offley, Sally Bain, Josephine Collins, Lauretta Roberts, Jessica Brown, Caroline Nodder, Eric Musgrave and Keely Stocker. The current editor is Kirsty McGregor.

In 1961, &quot;Drapers Record&quot; was bought along with the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;, &quot;Men&#x27;s Wear&quot; and &quot;Tatler&quot; by the Thomson Corporation and formed into the new Thomson Publications business. Thomson sold &quot;Drapers Record&quot; in 1985, along with the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;, &quot;Family Circle&quot;, &quot;Living&quot;, and &quot;Construction News&quot;. From 1988 to 1992, it was known as &quot;DR The Fashion Business&quot;, but from 1992 it returned to its original name &quot;Drapers Record&quot;. EMAP acquired the magazine in 1993.

In 2002, &quot;Drapers Record&quot; merged with sister title &quot;Men&#x27;s Wear&quot;, which had been launched in 1902, to become simply &quot;Drapers&quot;. In November 2006, Emap started making a version of the magazine available digitally every week. The website was relaunched in 2009.

The &quot;Drapers&quot; website was refreshed and re-launched in 2014. The magazine has undergone regular redesigns over the years, with the most recent in January 2017.

Often referred to as the &quot;fashion industry bible&quot;, &quot;Drapers&quot; has broken many of the biggest stories impacting the sector and has interviewed many of the key players including Tommy Hilfiger, David Reiss, Alex Baldock, Michael Ward, managing director of Harrods, and Topshop managing director Mary Homer.

It was one of 13 titles acquired from Ascential by Metropolis International in a £23.5m cash deal, announced on 1 June 2017.

== Awards ceremonies, conferences and events ==

*Celebrating the best in fashion retailing, the Drapers Awards recognise the top performing and most innovative businesses. The Awards are now in their 28th year, and attract more than 800 leading fashion business professionals to a black tie gala dinner held annually in November.
*Also in their 28th year, the Drapers Independents Awards in September highlight and celebrate the best of independent fashion retailing across the UK and Ireland.
*The Drapers Fashion Forum puts the new business development ideas at the heart of industry leaders’ debate, navigating opportunities that exist within and between brands and retailers, and looking at how these will develop in the future. 
*The Drapers Digital Festival, held for the first time in April 2017, merges the Drapers Digital Forum and Drapers Digital Awards in one venue, on one day. The event brings the fashion digital and ecommerce community together to learn, celebrate, innovate and shape the future. 
*The Drapers Footwear Awards celebrate the best-performing businesses across the footwear sector, with a gala dinner, awards ceremony and evening entertainment.

<doc id="725215" wikidata="Q2600361" url="?curid=725215" title="Metal Gear Solid (2000 video game)">
<text>Metal Gear Solid, released in Japan as is a 2000 action-adventure stealth video game developed and published by Konami for the Game Boy Color. The game began development after Konami Computer Entertainment Japan were commissioned by Konami&#x27;s European branch to develop a portable adaptation of their 1998 PlayStation game of the same title. However, the Game Boy Color version is not a port of the original PlayStation version, nor does it adapt the same story, but instead takes place in an alternative continuity set seven years after the events of the original &quot;Metal Gear&quot; (1987). Tose assisted on the development.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Ghost Babel&quot; follows the overhead 2D format used in the 1990 MSX2 game &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot; while adding a few new elements introduced in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;. As with previous games in the series, the objective is to infiltrate the enemy&#x27;s stronghold while avoiding detection from guards or surveillance systems. The player can acquire numerous items and weapons to help them fulfill their mission. One difference from the MSX2 games is that the screen now scrolls when Snake moves throughout a single area instead of using flip-screens. Moreover, all the characters in the game now move in eight directions, allowing both the player and the enemies to move diagonally in addition to the four cardinal directions.

Snake now has the ability to flatten himself into walls like he does in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;. By flattening himself, Snake can move across the wall (allowing him access to tight passages that are not accessible by walking), scroll the camera behind his position to scout the area ahead, or knock the wall to lure nearby enemy soldiers. Depending on the difficulty, the number of punches required to defeat an enemy soldier differs and in the higher difficulty levels, the enemy soldiers will be knocked unconscious for a while after the first series of punches instead of simply being defeated. Crawling is now assigned to the Start button (instead of pressing two buttons simultaneously) and the changing of weapons and equipment is done on the main game screen rather than on separate sub-screens. Like in previous installments, the player communicates with various allies via a wireless communication device (the Codec), which is also used to save the player&#x27;s progress.

Unlike the preceding installments, &quot;Ghost Babel&quot; uses a stage-based structure, with a total of 13 stages. After completing a stage, the player&#x27;s performance is graded from &quot;Terrible&quot; to &quot;Excellent&quot;. Much like in the original &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, the player&#x27;s overall performance is graded with a codename after completing all 13 stages, with the codenames varying depending on the difficulty level chosen at the start of the game.

===Game modes===
In addition to the main story mode, &quot;Ghost Babel&quot; offers the following alternate game modes.
;Stage Select
:Allows the player to replay previously cleared stages in order to achieve a higher ranking. After the Story mode is completed, &quot;Special&quot; versions of the stages become available where the player must achieve new objectives (such as collecting FOXHOUND emblems or reach the goal without being seen). In this Special training mode, the player controls an unknown agent who goes through a VR recreation of Snake&#x27;s mission in Galuade, while being supervised by a mysterious entity named &quot;No.4.&quot; As the player clears more of these stages, No.4 will disclose details of the game&#x27;s story not revealed in the main campaign.
;VR Training
:180 training missions spread across three main categories (sneaking, weapon and advanced) and various sub-categories within each. Most of the missions are recreations of the ones featured in &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Integral&quot;
;Vs. Battle
:A competitive 2-player mode that requires a Game Link Cable, along with an additional Game Boy Color unit and a second copy of the game cartridge. The objective in this mode is to destroy three target drones called WISPs in order to obtain the data disks they carry and access the goal before the other player does. One player controls Snake in his standard sneaking suit, while the other Snake wears a red sneaking suit. The two Snakes are invisible to each other, unless one of them enters the field of vision of the other.

==Plot==
Seven years after the Outer Heaven uprising, a new Metal Gear prototype (codenamed Gander) has been stolen by a separatist guerrilla group in the region of Gindra in Central Africa. The Gindra Liberation Front (or GLF), led by the mercenary Augustine Eguabon, plans on using the prototype as a means of achieving victory in an ongoing civil war. Solid Snake, the FOXHOUND operative responsible for the destruction of the original Metal Gear seven years before, is brought back from his retirement in Alaska. His mission is to infiltrate the group&#x27;s headquarters Galuade, the fortress that was formerly Outer Heaven. 

During the course of his mission, Snake teams up with Sgt. Christine Jenner, a surviving member of the Delta Force that was sent before him to retrieve Gander. The GLF are assisted by four surviving members of Black Chamber, a defunct special forces unit whose members are given animal-themed codenames similar to FOXHOUND. They are led by Black Arts Viper, a boobytrap specialist who wields a prosthetic left arm. Joining him are Slasher Hawk, an Australian Aborigine armed with two giant boomerangs who is accompanied in battle by a hawk; Marionette Owl, a former serial killer endowed with owl-like nocturnal vision and attacks with his two bunraku puppets; and Pyro Bison, a pyromaniac armed with a specially prepared flamethrower and fuel pack. As Snake goes deeper into Galuade and confronts each member of Black Chamber, he uncovers a conspiracy involving the GLF and US Government.

===&quot;IdeaSpy 2.5&quot;===
IdeaSpy 2.5 is a bonus 13-part story written by Shuyo Murata featured in the Japanese and European versions of &quot;Ghost Babel&quot;. The player has access to this story by going to the CODEC screen during the second play-through and onward by contacting frequency 140.07 on each stage. The story is written like a satirical radio play:

&quot;New York. Here in the city where dreams come true and desires rule, Something is being bought, sold, and thrown away, even as we speak. But behind the scenes of business as usual. the nefarious J.E (Junker Expensive) Corporation lines it already bloated coffers With profits from worthless products. As J.E swindles yet another innocent into purchasing High-priced junk, The FBI mobilizes a top-secret task force to put a stop to the menace. Now, the city&#x27;s best-kept secret spy is out there, Briefed; and ready to protect the people from J.E., the catalogue of conspiracy... Just call him 2.5 (Two-Point-Five)

In 2006, &quot;Idea Spy 2.5&quot; was adapted into an actual radio drama streamed on Hideo Kojima&#x27;s Japanese podcast, with Kojima himself playing the title role. Shuyo Murata also plays one of the boss characters. The full drama was released on CD in Japan on February 14, 2007.

==Development==
The game was produced under the request of Konami&#x27;s European division to release a Game Boy Color version of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;. The game&#x27;s director, Shinta Nojiri, would later go on to direct &quot;Metal Gear Acid&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Metal Gear Acid 2&quot;, both released for the PlayStation Portable, while character designer Ikuya Nakamura went on to direct the &quot;Boktai&quot; series on Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS.

==Reception==
The game received overall critical acclaim. It has an average rating of 95.61% at GameRankings, making it the best-rated game for the Game Boy Color on the site.

Japanese video game magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; awarded &quot;Metal Gear: Ghost Babel&quot; a score of 31 out of 40.

===Legacy===
&quot;Nintendo Power&quot; listed it as the 11th best Game Boy/Game Boy Color video game, praising it for successfully bringing over elements from the three dimensional games. Ben Reeves from &quot;Game Informer&quot; called it the eighth best Game Boy game and considered it a good throwback to the MSX2. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; listed &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; for Game Boy Color as one of the titles they would like to see on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console.

<text>Guanche is an extinct language or dialect continuum that was spoken by the Guanches of the Canary Islands until the 16th or 17th century. It died out after the conquest of the Canary Islands as the Guanche ethnic group was assimilated into the dominant Spanish culture. The Guanche language is known today through sentences and individual words that were recorded by early geographers, as well as through several place-names and some Guanche words that were retained in the Canary Islanders&#x27; Spanish.

==Classification==
Guanche has not been classified with any certainty. Many linguists propose that Guanche was likely a Berber language, or at least genealogically related to the Berber languages to some extent as an Afroasiatic language. However, recognizable Berber words are primarily agricultural or livestock vocabulary, whereas no Berber grammatical inflections have been identified, and there is a large stock of vocabulary that does not bear any resemblance to Berber whatsoever. It may be that Guanche had a stratum of Berber vocabulary but was otherwise unrelated to Berber. Other strong similarities to the Berber languages are reflected in their counting system, while some authors suggest the Canarian branch would be a sister branch to the surviving continental Berber languages, splitting off during the early development of the language family and before the &quot;terminus post quem&quot; for the origin of Proto-Berber.

==History==
The name &quot;Guanche&quot; originally referred to a &quot;man from Tenerife&quot;, and only later did it come to refer to all native inhabitants of the Canary Islands. Different dialects of the language were spoken across the archipelago. Archaeological finds on the Canaries include both Libyco-Berber and Punic inscriptions in rock carvings, although early accounts stated the Guanches themselves did not possess a system of writing.

The first reliable account of the Guanche language was provided by the Genovese explorer Nicoloso da Recco in 1341, with a list of the numbers 1–19, possibly from Fuerteventura. Recco&#x27;s account reveals a base-10 counting system with strong similarities to Berber numbers.

Silbo, originally a whistled form of Guanche speech used for communicating over long distances, was used on La Gomera, El Hierro, Tenerife, and Gran Canaria. As the Guanche language became extinct, a Spanish version of Silbo was adopted by some inhabitants of the Canary Islands.

==Numerals==
Guanche numerals are attested from several sources, not always in good agreement (Barrios 1997). Some of the discrepancies may be due to copy errors, some to gender distinctions, and others to Arabic borrowings in later elicitations. Recco&#x27;s early 1341 record notably uses Italian-influenced spelling.
* Also ,&#x27; an apparent copy error. Similarly with for expected *.

Later attestations of 11–19 were formed by linking the digit and ten with &quot;-ir&quot;: etc. 20–90 were similar, but contracted: etc. 100 was , apparently 10 with the Berber plural &quot;-en&quot;. Recco only recorded 1–16; the combining forms for 11–16, which did not have this &quot;-ir-&quot;, are included as the hyphenated forms in the table above.

Spanish does not distinguish and , so &quot;been&quot; is consistent with *veen. The Berber feminine ends in &quot;-t&quot;, as in Shilha 1: &quot;yan&quot; (m), &quot;yat&quot; (f); 2: &quot;sin&quot; (m), &quot;snat&quot; (f), and this may explain discrepancies such as &quot;been&quot; and &quot;vait&quot; for &#x27;one&#x27;.

Cairasco is a misparsed counting song, . &quot;Ses&quot; &#x27;6&#x27; may have got lost in the middle of ( ← *).

Starting with Cedeño, new roots for &#x27;2&#x27; and &#x27;9&#x27; appear (&#x27;9&#x27; perhaps the old root for &#x27;4&#x27;), new roots for &#x27;4&#x27; and &#x27;5&#x27; (&quot;arba, kansa&quot;) appear to be Arabic borrowings, and old &#x27;5&#x27;, &#x27;6&#x27;, &#x27;7&#x27; offset to &#x27;6&#x27;, &#x27;7&#x27;, &#x27;8&#x27;.

==Vocabulary==
Below are selected Guanche vocabulary items from a 16th-century list by Alonso de Espinosa, as edited and translated by Clements Robert Markham (1907):

Below are some additional basic vocabulary words in various Guanche dialects, from Wölfel (1965):

<text>Robert Caskin Prince III, known professionally as Bobby Prince, is an American video game composer and sound designer. He has worked as an independent contractor for several gaming companies, most notably id Software and 3D Realms. Some of his most notable works include &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Doom II: Hell on Earth&quot;, &quot;Duke Nukem II&quot;, and &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Bobby Prince was a founding member of R&amp;B band the Jesters. He was a 1LT platoon leader in Vietnam 1969–70.

Prince is a lawyer who passed the bar in 1980.

==Career==
Prince has created music and sound effects for &quot;Commander Keen 4–6&quot;, &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Cosmic Adventure&quot;, &quot;Pickle Wars&quot;, &quot;Catacomb 3D&quot;, &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot;, &quot;Blake Stone&quot;, &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot;, &quot;Duke Nukem II&quot;, &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;, &quot;Abuse&quot;, &quot;Demonstar&quot;, and many other games.

Among his most notable and most enduring works is the soundtrack to the video game &quot;Doom&quot;. The &quot;Doom&quot; soundtrack grew very popular among gamers, with fans doing various cover versions and remix projects more than 20 years after the game&#x27;s release. According to John Romero, a co-developer of Doom, several tracks from the game are copies of songs from popular heavy metal bands, such as Pantera and Alice in Chains.

<text>Les Paradis Artificiels (English: Artificial Paradises) is a book by French poet Charles Baudelaire, first published in 1860, about the state of being under the influence of opium and hashish. Baudelaire describes the effects of the drugs and discusses the way in which they could theoretically aid mankind in reaching an &quot;ideal&quot; world. The text was influenced by Thomas De Quincey&#x27;s &quot;Confessions of an English Opium-Eater&quot; and &quot;Suspiria de Profundis&quot;.

Baudelaire analyzes the motivation of the addict, and the individual psychedelic experience of the user. His descriptions have foreshadowed other such work that emerged later in the 1960s regarding LSD.

<text>In science and philosophy, an &quot;ad hoc&quot; hypothesis is a hypothesis added to a theory in order to save it from being falsified.

For example, a person that wants to believe in leprechauns can avoid ever being proven wrong by using &quot;ad hoc&quot; hypotheses (e.g., by adding &quot;they are invisible&quot;, then &quot;their motives are complex&quot;, and so on).

Often, &quot;ad hoc&quot; hypothesizing is employed to compensate for anomalies not anticipated by the theory in its unmodified form.

==In the scientific community==
Scientists are often skeptical of theories that rely on frequent, unsupported adjustments to sustain them. This is because, if a theorist so chooses, there is no limit to the number of &quot;ad hoc&quot; hypotheses that they could add. Thus the theory becomes more and more complex, but is never falsified. This is often at a cost to the theory&#x27;s predictive power, however. &quot;Ad hoc&quot; hypotheses are often characteristic of pseudoscientific subjects.

Albert Einstein&#x27;s addition of the cosmological constant to general relativity in order to allow a static universe was &quot;ad hoc&quot;. Although he later referred to it as his &quot;greatest blunder&quot;, it may correspond to theories of dark energy.

<text>Sergei Alexandrovich Yesenin (, ; 1895 – 28 December 1925), sometimes spelled as Esenin, was a Russian lyric poet. He is one of the most popular and well-known Russian poets of the 20th century. One of his narratives was &quot;lyrical evocations of and nostalgia for the village life of his childhoodno idyll, presented in all its rawness, with an implied curse on urbanisation and industrialisation&quot;.

==Biography==

===Life and work===

Sergei Yesenin was born in village of Konstantinovo in Ryazan County, Ryazan Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Rybnovsky District, Ryazan Oblast) to a peasant family. His father was Alexander Nikitich Yesenin (1873–1931), his mother&#x27;s name was Tatyana Fyodorovna Yesenina, née Titova, (1875–1955).

Both his parents spent most of their time looking for work, father in Moscow, mother in Ryazan, so at age two Sergei was moved to the nearby village Matovo, to join Fyodor Alexeyevich Titov and Natalya Yevtikhiyevna Titova, his relatively well-off maternal grandparents, who essentially raised him.

The Titovs had three grown-up sons, and it was they who were Yesenin&#x27;s early years&#x27; companions. &quot;My uncles taught me horse-riding and swimming, one of them... even employed me as hound-dog, when going out to the ponds hunting ducks,&quot; he later remembered. He started to read aged five, and at nine began to write poetry, inspired originally by chastushkas and folklore, provided mostly by the grandmother whom he also remembered as a highly religious woman who used to take him to every single monastery she chose to visit. He had two younger sisters, Yekaterina (1905–1977), and Alexandra (1911–1981).

In 1904 Yesenin joined the Konstantinovo zemstvo school. In 1909 he graduated from it with an honorary certificate, and went on to study in the local secondary parochial school in Spas-Klepiki. From 1910 onwards, he started to write poetry systematically; eight poems dated that year were later included in his 1925 Collected Works. In all, Yesenin wrote around thirty poems during his school years. He compiled them into what was supposed to be his first book which he titled &quot;Bolnye Dumy&quot; (Free Thoughts) and tried to publish it in 1912 in Ryazan, but failed.

In 1912, with a teacher’s diploma, Yesenin moved to Moscow, where he supported himself working as a proofreader&#x27;s assistant at Sytin&#x27;s printing company. The following year he enrolled in Shanyavsky Moscow City People&#x27;s University to study history and philology as an external student (вольнослушатель), but had to leave it after eighteen months due to lack of funds. In the University he became friends with several aspiring poets, among them Dmitry Semyonovsky, Vasily Nasedkin, Nikolai Kolokolov and Ivan Filipchenko. Yesenin’s first marriage (which lasted three years) was in 1913 to Anna Izryadnova, a co-worker from the publishing house, with whom he had a son, Yuri. 

1913 saw Yesenin becoming increasingly interested in Christianity, biblical motives became frequent in his poems. &quot;Grisha, what I am reading at the moment is the Gospel and find a lot of things which for me are new,&quot; he wrote to his close childhood friend G. Panfilov. That was also the year when he became involved with the Moscow revolutionary circles: for several months his flat was under secret police surveillance and in September 1913 it was raided and searched.

January 1914, Yesenin&#x27;s first published poem &quot;Beryoza&quot; (The Birch Tree) appeared in the children&#x27;s magazine &quot;Mirok&quot; (Small World). More appearances followed in minor magazines such as &quot;Protalinka&quot; and &quot;Mlechny Put&quot;. In December 1914 Yesenin quit work &quot;and gave himself to poetry, writing continually,&quot; according to his wife. Around this time he became a member of the Surikov Literary and Music circle.

In 1915, exasperated with the lack of interest in Moscow, Yesenin moved to Petrograd. He arrived to Petrograd on 8 March and the next day met Alexander Blok at his home, to read him poetry. He was quickly acquainted with fellow-poets Sergey Gorodetsky, Nikolai Klyuev and Andrei Bely who were well known. Blok was especially helpful in promoting Yesenin&#x27;s early literary career, describing him as &quot;a gem of a peasant poet&quot; and his verse as &quot;fresh, pure and resounding&quot;, even if &quot;wordy&quot;. 

The same year he joined the Krasa (Beauty) group of peasant poets which included Klyuyev, Gorodetsky, Sergey Klychkov and Alexander Shiryayevets, among others. In his 1925 autobiography Yesenin said that Bely gave him the meaning of form while Blok and Klyuev taught him lyricism. It was Klyuyev who introduced Yesenin to the publisher Averyanov, who in early 1916 released his debut poetry collection &quot;Radunitsa&quot; which featured many of his early spiritual-themed verse. &quot;I would have eagerly relinquished some of my religious poems, large and small, but they make sense as an illustration of poets&#x27; progress towards the revolution,&quot; he would later write. Yesenin and Klyuyev maintained close and intimate friendship which lasted several years, and indeed it is likely they became lovers.

Later in 1915, Yesenin became a co-founder of the Krasa literary group and published numerous poems in the Petrograd magazines &quot;Russkaya Mysl&quot;, &quot;Ezhemesyachny Zhurnal&quot;, &quot;Novy Zhurnal Dlya Vsekh&quot;, &quot;Golos Zhizni&quot; and &quot;Niva&quot;. Among the authors he met later in the year were Maxim Gorky, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Nikolai Gumilyov and Anna Akhmatova; he also visited painter Ilya Repin in his Penaty. Yesenin&#x27;s rise to fame was meteoric; by the end of the year he became the star of St Petersburg&#x27;s literary circles and salons. &quot;The city took to him with the delight a gourmet reserves for strawberries in winter. A barrage of praise hit him, excessive and often insincere,&quot; Maxim Gorky wrote to Romain Rolland.
On 25 March 1916, Yesenin was drafted for military duty and in April joined a medical train based in Tsarskoye Selo, under the command of colonel D.N. Loman. On 22 July 1916, at a special concert attended by the Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna (the train&#x27;s patron) and her daughters, Yesenin recited his poems &quot;Rus&quot; and &quot;In Scarlet Fireglow&quot;. &quot;The Empress told me my poems were beautiful, but sad. I replied, the same could be said about Russia as a whole,&quot; he recalled later. His relationships with Loman soon deteriorated. In October, Yesenin declined the colonel&#x27;s offer to write (with Klyuyev) and have published a book of pro-monarchist verses, and spent twenty days under arrest as a consequence.

In March 1917, Yesenin was sent to the Warrant Officers School but soon deserted Kerensky&#x27;s army. In August 1917 (having divorced Izryadnova a year earlier) Yesenin married for a second time, to Zinaida Raikh (later an actress and the wife of Vsevolod Meyerhold). They had two children, a daughter Tatyana and a son Konstantin. The parents subsequently quarreled and lived separately for some time prior to their divorce in 1921. Tatyana became a writer and journalist and Konstantin Yesenin would become a well-known soccer statistician.

Yesenin supported the February Revolution. &quot;If not for [it], I might have withered away on useless religious symbolism,&quot; he wrote later. He greeted the rise of the Bolsheviks too. &quot;In the Revolution I was all on the side of the October, even if perceiving everything in my own peculiar way, from a peasant&#x27;s standpoint,&quot; he remembered in his 1925 autobiography. Later he criticized the Bolshevik rule, in such poems as &quot;The Stern October Has Deceived Me&quot;. &quot;I feel very sad now, for we are going through such a period in [our] history when human individuality is being destroyed, and the approaching socialism is totally different from the one I was dreaming of,&quot; he wrote in an August 1920 letter to his friend Yevgeniya Livshits. &quot;I never joined the RKP, being further to the left than them,&quot; he maintained in his 1922 autobiography.
Artistically, the revolutionary years were exciting time for Yesenin. Among the important poems he wrote in 1917–1918 were &quot;Prishestviye&quot; (The Advent), &quot;Preobrazheniye&quot; (Transformation, which gave the title to the 1918 collection), and &quot;Inoniya&quot;. In February 1918, after the Sovnarkom issued the &quot;Socialist Homeland is in Danger!&quot; decree-appeal, he joined the esers&#x27; military unit. He actively participated in the magazine &quot;Nash Put&quot; (Our Way), as well as the almanacs Skify (Скифы) and Krasny Zvon (in February his large poem &quot;Marfa Posadnitsa&quot; appeared in one of the latter). In September 1918 Yesenin co-founded (with Andrey Bely, Pyotr Oreshin, Lev Povitsky and Sergey Klychkov) the publishing house Трудовая Артель Художников Слова (the Labor Artel of the Artists of the Word) which reissued (in six books) all that he had written by this time.

In September 1918, Yesenin became friends with Anatoly Marienhof, with whom he founded the Russian literary movement of imaginism. Describing their group&#x27;s general appeal, he wrote in 1922: &quot;Prostitutes and bandits are our fans. With them, we are pals. Bolsheviks do not like us due to some kind of misunderstanding.&quot; In January 1919, Yesenin signed the Imaginists&#x27; Manifest. In February he, Marienhof and Vadim Shershenevich, founded the Imaginists&#x27; publishing house. Before that, Yesenin became a member of the Moscow Union of Professional Writers and several months later was elected a member of the All-Russian Union of Poets. Two of his books, &quot;Kobyliyu Korabli&quot; (Mare&#x27;s Ships) and &quot;Klyuchi Marii&quot; (The Keys of Mary) came out later that year.
In July–August 1920, Yesenin toured the Russian South, starting in Rostov-on-Don and ending in Tiflis, Georgia. In November 1920, he met Galina Benislavskaya, his future secretary and close friend. Following an anonymous report, he and two of his Imaginist friends, brothers Alexander and Ruben Kusikovs, were arrested by the Cheka in October but released a week later on the solicitation of his friend Yakov Blumkin. In the course of that year, the publication of three of Yesenin&#x27;s books were refused by publishing house Goslitizdat. His &quot;Triptych&quot; collection came out through the Skify Publishers in Berlin. Next year saw the collections &quot;Confessions of a Hooligan&quot; (January) and &quot;Treryaditsa&quot; (February) published. The drama in verse &quot;Pygachov&quot; came out in December 1921, to much acclaim.

In May 1921, he visited a friend, the poet Alexander Shiryaevets, in Tashkent, giving poetry readings and making a short trip to Samarkand. In the fall of 1921, while visiting the studio of painter Georgi Yakulov, Yesenin met the Paris-based American dancer Isadora Duncan, a woman 18 years his senior. She knew only a dozen words in Russian, and he spoke no foreign languages. Nevertheless, they married on 2 May 1922. Yesenin accompanied his celebrity wife on a tour of Europe and the United States. His marriage to Duncan was brief and in May 1923, he returned to Moscow. 

In his 1922 autobiography, Yesenin wrote: &quot;Russia&#x27;s recent nomadic past does not appeal to me, and I am all for civilization. But I dislike America intensely. America is a stinking place where not just art is being murdered, but with it, all the loftiest aspirations of humankind. If it&#x27;s America that we are looking up to, as [a model for our] future, then I&#x27;d rather stay under our greyish skies... We do not have those skyscrapers that&#x27;s managed to produce up to date nothing but Rockefeller and McCormick, but here Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Pushkin and Lermontov were born.&quot;

In 1923, Yesenin became romantically involved with the actress Augusta Miklashevskaya to whom he dedicated several poems, among them those of the &quot;Hooligan&#x27;s Love&quot; cycle. In the same year, he had a son by the poet Nadezhda Volpina. Alexander Esenin-Volpin grew up to become a poet and a prominent activist in the Soviet dissident movement of the 1960s. Since 1972, till his death in 2016, he lived in the United States as a famous mathematician and teacher.

As Yesenin&#x27;s popularity grew, stories began to circulate about his heavy drinking and consequent public outbursts. In autumn 1923, he was arrested in Moscow twice and underwent a series of enquiries from the OGPU secret police. Other accusations against Yesenin and three of his close friends, fellow poets, Sergey Klytchkov, Alexei Ganin and Pyotr Oreshin, were made by Lev Sosnovsky, a journalist and close Trotsky associate. The foursome retorted with an open letter in &quot;Pravda&quot; and, in December, were cleared by the Writers&#x27; Union burlaw court. It was later suggested, though, that Yesenin&#x27;s departure to the Caucasus in the summer of 1924 might have been a direct result of the harassment by the NKVD. Earlier that year, fourteen writers and poets, including his friend Ganin, were arrested as the alleged members of the (apparently fictitious) Order of the Russian Fascists, then tortured and executed in March without trial.

In January–April 1924, Yesenin was arrested and interrogated four times. In February, he entered the Sheremetev hospital, then was moved into the Kremlin clinic in March. Nevertheless, he continued to make public recitals and released several books in the course of the year, including &quot;Moskva Kabatskaya&quot;. In August 1924 Yesenin and fellow poet Ivan Gruzinov published a letter in &quot;Pravda&quot;, announcing the end of the Imaginists.

In 1924-1925, Yesenin visited Azerbaijan, and stayed in the village of Mardakan, where he published a collection of poems, in the &quot;Krasny Vostok&quot; printing house, and was published in a local publishing house. There is a version that here, in May 1925, the poetic “Message to the Evangelist Demyan” was written. Still nowadays, there is a street and a museum house in the memory of the poet in the Mardakan, Azerbaijan.

In early 1925, Yesenin met and married Countess Sophia Andreyevna Tolstaya (1900–1957), a granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy. In May, what proved to be his final large poem &quot;Anna Snegina&quot; came out. During the year, he compiled and edited The Works by Yesenin in three volumes which was published by Gosizdat posthumously.

===Death===
On 28 December 1925, 30-year-old Yesenin was found dead in his room in the Hotel Angleterre in Leningrad. According to Wolf Ehrlich, Yesenin&#x27;s final poem, &quot;Goodbye my friend, goodbye&quot; (&quot;До свиданья, друг мой, до свиданья&quot;), was written by him the day before he died. Yesenin complained that there was no ink in the room, and he was forced to write with his own blood.


According to his biographers, the poet was in a state of depression and committed suicide by hanging.

After the funeral in Leningrad, Yesenin&#x27;s body was transported by train to Moscow, where a farewell for relatives and friends of the deceased was also arranged. He was buried on 31 December 1925, in Moscow&#x27;s Vagankovskoye Cemetery. His grave is marked by a white marble sculpture.

There is a theory that Yesenin&#x27;s death was actually a murder by OGPU agents who had staged it to look like a suicide. The novel &quot;Yesenin: Story of a Murder&quot; by Vitali Bezrukov, is devoted to that version of Yesenin&#x27;s death. In 2005, a TV serial simply titled &quot;Yesenin&quot;, based on the novel, was shown on Channel One Russia, with Sergey Bezrukov playing Yesenin. Facts tending to support the assassination hypothesis were cited by Stanislav Kunyaev and Sergey Kunyaev in the final chapter of their biography of Yesenin.

Enraged by his death, Mayakovsky composed a poem called &quot;To Sergei Yesenin&quot;, where the resigned ending of Yesenin&#x27;s death poem is countered by these verses: &quot;in this life it is not hard to die, / to mold life is more difficult.&quot; In a later lecture on Yesenin, he said that the revolution demanded &quot;that we glorify life.&quot; However, Mayakovsky himself would commit suicide on 14 April 1930 at the age of 36.

===Cultural impact===
Yesenin&#x27;s suicide triggered an epidemic of copycat suicides by his mostly female fans. For example, Galina Benislavskaya, his ex-girlfriend, killed herself by his graveside in December 1926. Although he was one of Russia&#x27;s most popular poets and had been given an elaborate state funeral, some of his writings were banned by the Kremlin during the reigns of Joseph Stalin and Nikita Khrushchev. Nikolai Bukharin&#x27;s criticism of Yesenin contributed significantly to the banning. 

Only in 1966 were most of his works republished. Today Yesenin&#x27;s poems are taught to Russian schoolchildren; many have been set to music and recorded as popular songs. His early death, coupled with unsympathetic views by some of the literary elite, adoration by ordinary people, and sensational behavior, all contributed to the enduring and near mythical popular image of the Russian poet.

Ukrainian composer Tamara Maliukova Sidorenko (1919-2005) set several of Yesenin’s poems to music.

German composer Bernd Alois Zimmermann included Yesenin&#x27;s poetry in his &quot;Requiem für einen jungen Dichter&quot; (&quot;Requiem for a Young Poet&quot;), completed in 1969.

The Ryazan State University is named in Yesenin&#x27;s honor.

<doc id="725241" wikidata="Q3780434" url="?curid=725241" title="List of birds of Portugal">
<text>This is a list of the bird species recorded in Portugal. The avifauna of mainland Portugal, the Azores, and Madeira islands included a total of 632 species as of October 2024 according to Avibase. Of them, 16 have been introduced by humans. 3 are endemic to islands, one is extinct.

This list&#x27;s taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (English and scientific names) are those of &quot;The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World&quot;, 2022 edition.

The following tags have been used to highlight some categories of occurrence. The notes such as &quot;Azores only&quot; and the notes of population status such as &quot;endangered&quot; are from &quot;Bird Checklists of the World&quot;. The latter notes apply to the worldwide population, not just that in Portugal.

*(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in mainland Portugal, the Azores, or Madeiras
*(I) Introduced - a species introduced to mainland Portugal, the Azores, or Madeiras as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions

<text>The David Dunlap Observatory (DDO) is an astronomical observatory site in Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada. Established in 1935, it was owned and operated by the University of Toronto until 2008. It was then acquired by the city of Richmond Hill, which provides a combination of heritage preservation, unique recreation opportunities and a celebration of the astronomical history of the site. Its primary instrument is a reflector telescope, at one time the second-largest telescope in the world, and still the largest in Canada. Several other telescopes are also located at the site, which formerly also included a small radio telescope. The telescope was driven by the vision of astronomer Clarence Chant, shared by businessman David Alexander Dunlapwhose family provided financial support after Dunlap&#x27;s death in 1924. The scientific legacy of the David Dunlap Observatory continues in the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, a research institute at the University of Toronto established in 2008.

The DDO is the site of a number of important scientific studies, including pioneering measurements of the distance to globular clusters, providing the first direct evidence that Cygnus X-1 was a black hole, and the discovery that Polaris was stabilizing and appeared to be &quot;falling out&quot; of the Cepheid variable category. Located on a hill, yet still relatively close to sea level at altitude, and now surrounded by urban settlement, its optical astronomy ability has been reduced as compared to other remote observatory sites around the world. On 31 July 2019, the DDO was accepted by the National Historic Board as a National Historic Site of Canada.

==History==

===Genesis===

The DDO owes its existence almost entirely to the efforts Clarence Chant. Chant had not shown an early interest in astronomy, but while attending University College, University of Toronto, he became interested in mathematics and physics, eventually joining the university as a lecturer in physics in 1892. Over the next several years he worked as a schoolteacher and civil servant. During a later leave of absence he earned his PhD from Harvard University and did postdoctoral work in Germany.

Chant joined the Astronomical and Physical Society of Toronto in December 1892; it was renamed the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada in 1902. Chant became president of the Society, serving between 1904 and 1907. Throughout the 1890s, Chant was concerned about how little the university did for astronomy, and in 1904 he proposed adding several undergraduate courses for fourth-year students, and six such courses were added to the 1905 calendar.

With courses now officially on the books, Chant started looking for a proper telescope. Previously the university had hosted the Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory, which had been run by the Meteorological Office of the Ministry of Marine and Fisheries. The observatory, built in 1840, had contained the high-quality Cooke Refractor, but the Observatory was now surrounded by new university buildings, rendering it useless for astronomy. The Meteorological Office had already decided to abandon the site and turn the building over to the university, but they were taking the telescope to their new location at 315 Bloor Street West. Even if the university had been able to secure time on the instrument, which was highly likely, it was at this time quite a small instrument in comparison to those being built around the world.

The same problem of encroachment that had led to the observatory falling into disuse led Chant to conclude that there was no suitable location on the university grounds for a new observatory, and he started looking for off-campus sites. While looking, he started getting quotes for a new instrument from Warner &amp; Swasey in Cleveland, Ohio, who had provided the mount for the recently opened Dominion Observatory in Ottawa. In 1910 Chant finally found a suitable location, a plot of land near what is today Bathurst Street and St. Clair Avenue. The land had originally been set aside by the city for the Isolation Hospital, but this was never constructed and it now lay empty. Chant convinced the city to become involved in the Royal Astronomical Observatory, but the outbreak of World War I put the project on hold, and in 1919 it was cancelled outright.

===Dunlap involvement===
Chant then turned to the local business community to fund the project. Similar collaborations had been very successful in the United States, but Chant found an entirely different reception in Canada and nothing seemed forthcoming. His fortunes changed in 1921 when Chant delivered a public lecture on Comet 7P/Pons-Winnecke, which had recently been visible in Canada. One of the attendees was Hollinger Mines co-founder, lawyer David Dunlap (1863–1924), who became interested in astronomy as a result of the lecture, and expressed an interest in Chant&#x27;s efforts to build a large observatory. Before making any financial commitment, however, Dunlap died in October 1924 at age 61 &quot;(also see )&quot;. Chant approached his widow, Jessie Dunlap, in late 1926 with the idea of erecting an observatory as a monument to her husband. Mrs. Dunlap promised to &quot;keep it in [her] heart for consideration, for it appeals to me tremendously&quot;.

By this point the chosen site was within the rapidly-growing city&#x27;s lit areas, and no longer suitable for astronomy. A site much further from the city was needed, to ensure it too would not be crowded out. The first site studied was outside Aurora, Ontario, but it was decided that it was too far from the university for casual travel. Another site near Hogg&#x27;s Hollow was also studied, but was not easily accessible. The eventual site was selected while Chant was studying topographical maps with fellow astronomer Reynold K. Young, finding a suitable spot north of the city. The site was a short distance east of Yonge Street, and the Canadian Northern Ontario Railway line ran along the western end of the site. It was on lot 42 on what was Alexander Marsh farm and orchard. In 1930, when Chant took Dunlap to see the site for the first time, she stated &quot;this is the place!&quot; and authorized its purchase for ().

===Construction===

Chant immediately started ordering a telescope, selecting a instrument from Grubb, Parsons and Company in England. This would make it the second-largest telescope in the world, second only to the instrument at Mount Wilson Observatory. It was, however, only slightly larger than the one that had recently gone into service for the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in British Columbia, at . The observatory building itself started construction, and the eighty-ton sixty-one-foot (18.6 m) copper dome was built by Grubb and Parsons in 1932 and arrived in 1933. The administration building, a few hundred feet from the main observatory, also started construction and designed by Mathers &amp; Haldenby Architects. The mirror blank (the two outermost inches (5 cm) of the mirror are not used) was supplied by Corning Incorporated and cast in Pyrex from a batch of glass that Corning also used to produce the mirror for Palomar Observatory. Chant and Mrs. Dunlap attended the pouring of the mirror at the factory in Corning, New York in June 1933. The mirror was annealed, then shipped to Grubb-Parsons in England for polishing. The telescope was completed in time for the finished mirror&#x27;s return in May 1935.

The official opening was on 31 May 1935, Chant&#x27;s 70th birthday. The opening ceremony was attended by notables including Sir Frank Dyson, former Astronomer Royal, and former Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, who praised the Observatory as &quot;a gift to science all over the world&quot;. Reynold K. Young was named the first director of the DDO. Chant retired the same day and moved into Observatory House, the original pre-Confederation farmhouse (built in 1864 for Alexander Marsh and known also as Elms Lea Alexander Marsh) just to the south of the administration buildings, where he spent his remaining years. In May 1939, the train carrying King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother on their cross-Canada tour paused on the railway below the observatory, the largest telescope in the commonwealth.

Grubb-Parsons built four more 1.88-metre telescopes with similarities to the instrument in Richmond Hill: for Radcliffe Observatory near Pretoria, Mount Stromlo Observatory in Australia, Helwan Observatory in Egypt, and an observatory in Okayama Prefecture in Japan. The South African instrument was disassembled and moved to Sutherland, Northern Cape in the 1970s because of light pollution. The original telescope mirror at Helwan was replaced by Zeiss in 1997, and the telescope at Mount Stromlo was destroyed by fire in 2003. A 1.93-metre Grubb-Parsons telescope at Haute-Provence Observatory with a higher-resolution spectrograph was used to discover an extrasolar planet orbiting the star 51 Pegasi in 1995.

The three smaller domes at the top of the DDO administration building are used for smaller instruments. Soon after the observatory opened in 1935, a Cassegrain reflector telescope was installed in the southern dome. A large vacuum tank was constructed, then used to aluminize the 74-inch mirror in 1941. The Cooke Refractor had been out of use since the Meteorological Office had given it to Hart House, but it was little used and was moved into the northern dome in 1951 to be used by undergraduates. In 1965, a similar Cassegrain was added to the central dome.

===Operations===
From 1946 to 1951 the observatory director was Frank Scott Hogg, who was joined at the DDO by his wife Helen Sawyer Hogg. After her husband&#x27;s death, Helen continued at the observatory, surveying globular clusters to gauge their distance, publishing a major catalog of variable stars in clusters. Her weekly &#x27;With the Stars&#x27; column in the Toronto Star was published from 1951 to 1981. In 1959 and 1966 staff astronomer Sidney van den Bergh composed a database of dwarf galaxies known as the David Dunlap Observatory Catalogue.

In collaboration with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Donald MacRae established a radio astronomy observatory on the observatory grounds in 1956. The DDO work led to the 1963 measurement of the absolute flux density of Cassiopeia A at 320 MHz, a radiometric standard. The DDO also built an radio telescope in Algonquin Park in northern Ontario, co-locating it at the site of the larger Algonquin Radio Observatory. This instrument was actively used until 1991, when budget cuts led to it being abandoned. It was later used by a private group as part of a SETI project, Project TARGET, and has reported moved to a site outside Shelburne, Ontario.

In 1960 observatory operations formed the narrative framework of the National Film Board (NFB) short film &quot;Universe&quot;. The film was nominated for the 33rd Academy Awards in the category of best documentary, short subject in 1961. &quot;Universe&quot; was shown at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair where it was seen by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, who were starting work on the film that eventually became &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. &quot;Universe&quot; featured future DDO director Donald MacRae and was narrated by Stanley Jackson.

Tom Bolton was hired as a postdoctoral fellow at the DDO in 1970. In 1971 he used data from the Uhuru X-ray observatory, and Naval Research Laboratory sounding rockets launched from White Sands Missile Range to find the optical companion star to the X-ray source Cygnus X-1. Those X-ray telescopes had a certain degree of accuracy, but follow-up optical-wavelength studies of possible companions were required to eliminate a shortlist of many stars in the same area of sky. Bolton observed the star HDE 226868 independently of the work by Louise Webster and Paul Murdin, at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, who could not prove that star was Cygnus X-1&#x27;s optical companion. The high dispersion of the telescope&#x27;s spectrograph, combined with the aperture was adequate to prove the star was the source of the X-ray emissions and that its behaviour was inconsistent with a normal eclipsing star.

===Shifting locations===

With the rapid growth of university funding in the 1960s more offices were being built in the downtown campus, and with the opening of the McLennan Labs more and more of the department moved into the new facilities. The Administration Building at the DDO headquartered the Astronomy Department until the 1960s, although the weekly department meetings continued to be held there until 1978. The main library was shifted downtown in 1983. The Cooke Refractor, now almost unused, was later donated to the Canada Science and Technology Museum in 1984.

The main reflector at the DDO remained a major instrument into the 1960s, but in the end even the &quot;remote&quot; location Chant had selected was being encroached on by urban sprawl. Although some consideration was given to moving the telescope to a new site, in the end it was decided the funds would be better spent on a smaller instrument in a much better location. This led to the building of a instrument at Las Campanas in Chile in 1971, creating the University of Toronto Southern Observatory (UTSO). It was at this location that University of Toronto telescope operator Ian Shelton discovered Supernova 1987A, the first supernova visible to the naked eye in more than 350 years. The UTSO was closed in 1997 to re-allocate funds to a share of the Gemini Observatory, and the telescope was moved to El Leoncito in Argentina, where the university has a 25% share in observation time. While University operations continued at the DDO, international observers used about 50% of observing time there.

===Closure, sale, redevelopment and reopening===

By the mid-1990s, the observatory remained the largest single-mirror site in Canada, but it was considered small by modern standards. The cutting edge of Canadian university astronomy studies was involved in some of the world&#x27;s largest observatories: the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array and the Gemini Observatory. None of these telescopes are located in Canada. After the UTSO was closed, in 1998 the Canadian Astronomical Society, a society of university astronomers, published a long range plan emphasizing the study of the origins of structure in the universe, a task well-suited to cutting-edge telescopes but ill-suited to the DDO. The long-range plan suggested the future of observatories such as the DDO lay in public outreach programs and training. In 2005 Canadian universities joined a partnership to build the Thirty Meter Telescope, expected to cost more than $1 billion.

In September 2007, the university stated it planned to sell the DDO property owing to light pollution.

The university&#x27;s governing council voted on the issue during the week of 1 November 2007, and agreed to sell the site to the highest bidder. The of land in the midst of a very large subdivision area was expected to fetch $100 million, some of which the university planned to use to found a Dunlap Institute to continue astronomical research. For the purposes of the sale, the land was partitioned into a Parcel A and a Parcel B (also known as the &#x27;panhandle&#x27;), upon which sits the Elvis Stojko Arena and a park with a 200-metre-wide solar system art piece. The land upon which the arena was built was leased to the Town until the Town purchased the &#x27;panhandle&#x27; lands in 2012.

At the end of June 2008, the university completed the sale of both parcels of the property to Corsica Development Inc., a subsidiary of Metrus Development Inc. for $70 million, a lower price than expected. Observatory staff were laid off and faculty reassigned to the downtown St. George campus. The Town of Richmond Hill planned a hearing with the Conservation Review Board of Ontario to argue for protection of the western 48% of the property including the observatory buildings under the Ontario Heritage Act; at the hearing, the Richmond Hill Naturalists argued for 100% designation of the property, all the buildings and their contents, and the Observatory Hill Homeowners Association argued for the protection of the heritage woodlots and arboretums. Corsica Development Inc. was also represented before the CRB. Preliminary hearings took place on 3 September and 15 October 2008. Corsica Development Inc. is administered by Metrus in conjunction with The Conservatory Group and Marel Contracting. At the same time, the RASC-TC were selected over the DDOD to manage and operate the observatory.

The Conservation Review Board hearing to determine the extent of the Cultural Heritage Landscape designation to be afforded to the Dunlap site took place in Richmond Hill between 15 and 23 January 2009, and the Board recommendation was published on 4 June. The Board recommended preservation of the observatory buildings and up to 80% of the property as a cultural heritage landscape. On 29 September 2009, Richmond Hill Town Council voted unanimously in favour of the designating by-law. The Town proceeded with a number of public meetings and reports in late 2009 to craft guidelines for the conservation, planning and design of the property. Corsica Development Inc. undertook an archaeological survey of the property. On 15 April 2010, stemming from an incident on the property in November 2009, Corsica Development Inc. pleaded guilty in York Region court to 17 counts of cutting a tree without a permit and was issued a fine of $44,880. The company also planted 100 new trees on the property as part of the judgment.

In January 2009, Corsica published the website observatoryhill.ca describing the property, stating, &quot;[We] are in the process of looking for an astronomy club to occupy the observatory and welcome proposals for consideration.&quot; On 22 April 2009, Corsica and the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada announced an agreement allowing the RASC to provide public education and outreach programs at the observatory, and to operate the 1.88m telescope. On 14 June, the RASC Toronto Centre published the website www.theddo.ca, to make tickets available for public astronomy nights at the observatory starting on 18 July. Astronomy events at the observatory continued, such as Perseid meteor shower events that drew high attendance and media coverage. These new operations continued through 2016, combined with opportunities such as use of the observatory for location shoots of the Syfy (formerly Sci-Fi Channel) series &quot;Warehouse 13&quot; and the NBC television series &quot;Hannibal&quot;.

In May 2013, after continued debate and appeals for mediation between the town of Richmond Hill and Metrus/Corsica, the Ontario Municipal Board handed down a decision to support official plan amendment 270, the mediated settlement that set aside 56 percent of the site&#x27;s land to residents for a future public park. Corsica would be allowed to build 530 homes on the eastern portion of the site. Combined with the previous purchase by the Town of Richmond Hill of the Elvis Stojko Arena and surrounding land for $19.5 million, a total of 11 acres of the original 189-acre property is owned by the town. A further legal appeal by the Richmond Hill Naturalists to preserve the entire site from development was launched in August 2013 and was ultimately unsuccessful. The group was eventually ordered to pay some of the developers&#x27; court costs in September 2015.

In November 2014, the David Dunlap Observatory Defenders group chairperson and founder Karen Cilevitz resigned from her position after being elected to be local councillor for the region&#x27;s Ward (Ward 5). The organization then formed a new group, the Friends of the David Dunlap Observatory Park, to function as the public stakeholder entity for site advocacy, public engagement and community outreach. In response, in December 2014 both the RASC-TC and the DDOD published editorial letters in the Richmond Hill Liberal, both claiming to be the &quot;true&quot; parties responsible for upkeep and operation of the Observatory.

In April 2015, Corsica (having changed their name to DG Group) announced plans to transfer ownership of the observatory buildings to the RASC. Despite RASC-TC&#x27;s status as a registered charitable corporation, some parties to the 2012 five-party OMB settlement argued that the donation placed the future of the observatory in doubt, because RASC was not a government agency. In March 2016, the dispute was resolved through transfer of ownership of the property to the town of Richmond Hill.

On 20 July 2016, the RASC-TC declined to continue negotiations to lease the property for exclusive use and to continue to provide outreach programs at the heritage site. This led to the Town inviting proposals from 35 organizations to continue programming and maintenance of the site. Five applicants submitted proposals, including the York Region Astronomical Association (members of the RASC-TC who had been using, maintaining and programming the site), the RASC-TC, and the DDOD.

In October 2016, the Town of Richmond Hill approved a master plan to turn of the Observatory lands into a &quot;destination park&quot;, for astronomical outreach programs, while adding recreational amenities such as walking paths, 4 tennis courts, an amphitheatre and a low-light level &quot;Star Path&quot; self-illuminating pathway. A feasibility study for a planetarium on the site was also intended. The project is expected to cost $54 million over 15–20 years.

In October 2017, the Town announced it would pursue a joint partnership with the RASC-TC and the DDOD to continue to provide educational and public outreach programming, ending the interim programming provided by the YRAA.

==Contemporaries==
The DDO main instrument was the second-largest telescope in the world when it began operation in 1935. 
Some of the largest telescopes in 1935 were:
Later in the 1930s, an 82-inch telescope was completed at McDonald Observatory in Texas. By the end of the next decade Dunlap&#x27;s was still the fourth largest, due to the opening of the Hale Telescope in 1948. However, the telescope has remained the largest telescope in Canada until 1992, when the somewhat unique UBC-Laval LMT 2.65 m (104 in) came online. However, the LMT is a zenith telescope that only points up, using a liquid metal mirror.

==In popular culture==
The Observatory is featured multiple times in the NBC television series &quot;Hannibal&quot;. The administration building resembles the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. The Observatory is also featured on the Netflix production of &quot;The Umbrella Academy&quot;. Additionally, it is featured in the Showtime show &quot;Lost Girl&quot;. It has been used multiple times for the Syfy show &quot;Warehouse 13&quot;.

<text>The Architecture of Lahore reflects the history of Lahore and is remarkable for its variety and uniqueness. There are buildings left from the centuries of rule of the Mughal Empire, the Sikh Empire, as well as from the era of the British Raj, whose style is a mixture of Victorian and Islamic architecture often referred to as Indo-Saracenic. In addition, there are newer buildings which are very modern in their design. Unlike the emphasis on functional architecture in the west, much of Lahore&#x27;s architecture has always been about making a statement as much as anything else.

The old city houses a number of examples of architecture of Lahore, which have a strong influence of the Mughal style. Department of archaeology has excavated many architectural remains of the buildings that were built during the rule of Rama of Ayodhya. Thus it can be said that though many buildings of Lahore carry Muslim heritage, they also have the influence of other religions such as Sikhism, Hinduism, Jainism and Zoroastrianism.

Lahori architecture also includes the thirteen gates, through which one can enter the city from various directions. Some of the gates are known as Raushnai Gate, Masti Gate, Yakki Gate, Kashmiri Gate, Khizri Gate, Shah Burj Gate, Akbari Gate and Lahori Gate. Some of the other significant buildings of Lahore built during the Mughal rule are Jahangir&#x27;s Quadrangle, Maktab Khana, Khilwat Khana, Picture Wall, Kala Burj and Hathi Paer.

Lahore architecture consists of a few mosques as well. An atypical style of all the major buildings was that they were surrounded by beautiful gardens.

==Walled city==
The walled city of Lahore is situated next to the river Ravi, which helped the city develop economically, demographically and culturally. Trade, food and communication, were all made possible due to the strategic location of the city. The old city is the reminiscent of the past glory of Lahore and the new city gives a prospectus of its bright and prosperous future. The city is built in the shape of a parallelogram and the area within the walls is about . It is slightly elevated hence protecting it from destruction and any outside invasion. Mughal emperor Akbar during his stay in Lahore built a brick wall around the city to protect it. Since the walls had decayed over time, founder of Sikh Empire, Ranjit Singh rebuilt these walls and added a deep broad ditch around. This ditch was further filled with fine gardens, and encircled the city on every side except the north. Access to the city was possible through the thirteen gateways.




=== Surviving gates ===
==Mughal architecture==

The Mughals ruled a population dominated by non-Muslims, mostly Hindus. Indigenous religions and traditions were tolerated and respected by the Mughal rulers. They were also incorporated into the arts, literature, music and architecture of the Mughal dynasty. During the 300-year rule of the Mughals, their attitudes towards indigenous cultures varied. With Akbar&#x27;s arrival, there was a fusion of Hindu and Muslim styles and they are depicted in the various architectural innovations that he undertook.

Mughal architecture was the product of Indian, Islamic, Timurid and even European styles. The Mughal artists used these borrowed forms, in terms of symbolism and style, to fit in their own distinct style of architecture. According to Abul Fazl, the court chronicler, the Mughal forts and palaces were much more than imperial residences, they served as emblems of power and wealth, designed to dazzle the native rajas who attended their emperor&#x27;s courts. Mughal emperors often demolished earlier structures to make space for new ones. Although they were proud of their heritage, each sought to mould the court in their own manner, and give his own reign a unique character. Apart from the forts and palaces, the two other most important types of Mughal buildings were the mosques and tombs. Both were used to provide a place of worship for Muslims.

Grand Islamic tombs had become popular at the time of the Mughals. These tombs commonly had entrances without doors, so that the interior was open to the outside air, and it had been suggested that this arrangement was devised to satisfy the law while evading its real meaning. Such attempts to reconcile artistic talent with religious tradition portray Islam as being devoid of artistic aspirations.

By an architectural point of view, therefore, Lahore is essentially a Mughal city, its golden period being by and large the period of Mughal rule. The Emperors added much to the city of Lahore, making it a beautiful and cultured city.

==Sikh architecture==
The Samadhi of Ranjit Singh is the mausoleum of the Sikh ruler Maharaja Ranjit Singh. It is located near the Lahore Fort and Badshahi Mosque in Lahore, Pakistan. Construction was started by his son, Kharak Singh on the spot where he was cremated, and was completed by his youngest son, Duleep Singh in 1848. The tomb exemplifies Sikh architecture, it is gilded fluted domes and cupolas and an ornate balustrade round the top. Ranjit Singh&#x27;s ashes are contained in a marble urn in the shape of a lotus, sheltered under a marble pavilion inlaid with pietra dura, in the centre of the tomb. Two small monuments to the west of the main mausoleum commemorate Ranjit Singh&#x27;s son Kharak Singh and grandson Nau Nihal Singh, and their wives. The religious structure is the gurdwara, a place where the Guru dwells. A gurdwara is not only the all-important building of the Faith, as masjid or mosque of the Islamic faith and mandir or temple of the Hindu religion, but it is also, like its Islamic and Hindu counterparts, the keynote of Sikh architecture.

==British architecture==
Under British rule (1849–1947), colonial architecture in Lahore combined Mughal, Gothic and Victorian styles. Under British rule, Sir Ganga Ram designed and built the General Post Office, Lahore Museum, Aitchison College, Mayo School of Arts (now the NCA), Ganga Ram Hospital, Lady Mclagan Girls High School, the Chemistry department of the Government College University, the Albert Victor wing of Mayo Hospital, Sir Ganga Ram High School (now Lahore College for Women) the Hailey College of Commerce, Ravi Road House for the Disabled, the Ganga Ram Trust Building on Shahrah-e-Quaid-e-Azam, and the Lady Maynard Industrial School. He also constructed Model Town, a suburb that has recently developed into a cultural center for Lahore&#x27;s growing socioeconomic elite.

The General Post Office and YMCA buildings in Lahore commemorated the golden jubilee of Queen Victoria, an event marked by the construction of clock towers and monuments all over British India. Other important British buildings included the High Court, the Government College University, the museums, St. Anthony&#x27;s College, the National College of Arts, Montgomery Hall, Tollinton Market, the University of the Punjab (Old Campus) and the Provincial Assembly. Even today, Mall Road retains a variety of Gothic and Victorian style buildings built during the British Raj. At one end of The Mall stands the university, one of the most prestigious universities of Pakistan. The British also launched the city&#x27;s first horse-racing club in 1924, starting a tradition that continues today at the Lahore Race Club. Other renowned buildings are Punjab Assembly Hall, Lahore High Court, General Post Office (GPO), Lahore Museum, Punjab University, Tollinton Market and the Lahore Railway Station.

==Popular forms of architecture==

===Mosques===
Religion throughout history has influenced the fabric of Muslim society and we find its imprint on art and culture as well. The city of Lahore which has been the seat of learning could not escape the impact of Islam. This impact we find in several architectural monuments specifically the Mosques built during the supremacy of Muslims over this area. Some of these Mosques were built by women and courtiers for the purpose of spreading knowledge. The most famous Mosque built during the Moghul period has been the Badshahi Mosque. Others include the Masjid Sara-I-Shahjahani, built by Emperor Shah Jahan and situated next to Emperor Jahangir&#x27;s tomb; Taxali Gate Mosque; Mosque of Mullah Mohammad Saleh Kamboh, situated near the Mochi Gate; Sunehri Mosque, built during the last phase of Mughal rule; Masjid Sardar Jahan, the earliest mosque of Jahangir&#x27;s period and situated inside the Lahori Gate; and the Zenana Masjid in the Fort built near the Ladies Quadrangle and was meant exclusively for the ladies living nearby.

===Gardens===
Since the beginning Lahore has been famous for its beautiful gardens and parks. Its ideal location on the banks of the Ravi provided an opportunity to the rulers and lovers of beauty to plan gardens to satisfy their aesthetic taste. During the Moghul period, most of the gardens were planned around mausoleums of rulers or saints or were laid by the royal courtiers. The gardens in some cases were used as farm houses or summer resorts. Many Emperors would camp in these gardens while on their visit to Lahore or when they were in transit. We are not certain whether these gardens were also used by the public at that time or not. Some of the gardens laid down during the Mughal period include-the Dilkusha garden, the Shalimar Gardens, the Chaubujri Garden, the Hazuri Bagh and the Gulabi Garden.

===Tombs===

Lahore is the city where mortal remains of the most romantic and artistic of all the Emperors of this sub continent exist. It is the city where the prettiest and most intelligent of all the Mughal queens, Nur Jahan lies in eternal sleep in a city which she loved the most. Here too lies the romantic legendary figure, Anarkali. Besides royalty there are a number of great people who have left an imprint on the pages of history and are now a proud heritage of Lahore. Among the administrators we can name Asaf Khan, brother of Nur Jahan, and also a famous architect of his times, Ali Mardan Khan. Lahore is equally proud of religious leaders and saints. Their tombs are daily visited by thousands of their disciples and the living influence of their teachings is still being felt today.

==Modern architecture==
In modern Lahore, the traditions of architecture in Lahore have been changing. The dome, minaret, the arch, the intricate mirror work and the extravagant use of ornaments which were features of the Mughal style, have now gone out of fashion. Furthermore, the changing patterns of economy, industrialisation and increase in population have contributed a great deal in revolutionising the entire basis of architectural forms. Due to changing lifestyles and trends, there has been an ever-increasing tendency to adopt Western and American forms of architecture. However, there is no parallel between the classical Mughal architecture and that of modern structures. Mughal architecture by far surpasses contemporary architectural designs. In modern days, parts of Bahria Town Housing Scheme in Lahore are themed on ancient Egyptian culture. There are many other architectural notables, including themes for different locales that make Bahria a very interesting and well conceived scheme to visit and live in. Lahore Alhamra Arts Council is also a piece of Architecture in Lahore, it gives modern and old all traditions of Pakistan. It is the work of Aga Khan in Lahore.

<text>A disaster in the English towns of Southport and St Anne&#x27;s-on-the-Sea  occurred on the evening of the 9th December 1886, when 27 lifeboat men lost their lives trying to save the crew of the German barque &quot;Mexico&quot;.

14 of the 16 crew members aboard the Southport Lifeboat &quot;Eliza Fernley&quot; drowned along with all 13 of the St Anne&#x27;s Lifeboat &quot;Laura Janet&quot;. The 12 crew of the &quot;Mexico&quot; were eventually rescued by the Lytham Lifeboat &quot;Charles Biggs&quot;.

==Disaster==

On 9 December 1886, &quot;Mexico&quot;, a Hamburg-registered barque bound for Guayaquil from Liverpool went aground near Southport, in a full west north westerly gale.
A lifeboat, &quot;Eliza Fernley&quot;, was launched from Southport in response to distress signals from &quot;Mexico&quot;. When the craft reached &quot;Mexico&quot;, she was struck by heavy seas and capsized. Two hours later, she was found approximately three miles from Southport at Birkdale. Fourteen of her sixteen crew had perished.

The two survivors, Henry Robinson and John Jackson, were trapped under the boat after she capsized and only survived by freeing themselves, swimming out and clinging onto the keel of the boat, then walking miles back to their homes and raising the alarm. One of them had tried and failed to rescue other comrades who were still trapped under the boat. Amazingly, four other men from the Southport boat initially survived the disaster but subsequently could not be saved.

Between fifteen and twenty minutes after the Southport boat launched, the neighbouring St Annes lifeboat—&quot;Laura Janet&quot;—was also called out. Her crew rowed her out to five hundred yards, and then hoisted sail, proceeding to two miles off Southport. In the words of Patrick Howarth, author of &quot;Lifeboat: In Danger&#x27;s hour&quot;: &quot;What happened there has never been clearly established. Two red lights were seen at Southport, which may have been signals from the life–boat. All that is known is that at quarter past eleven the next morning the life–boat was found ashore, bottom up, with three dead bodies hanging on the thwarts with their heads downwards. Every man in the crew was lost&quot;.
Additionally, a third lifeboat, from Lytham, reached &quot;Mexico&quot;. By that time, &quot;Mexico&quot; had settled on her beam ends, and the crew had lashed themselves to the rigging. The lifeboat, on her &quot;maiden rescue&quot;, rowed for a mile and a half through the River Ribble, and then rowed to &quot;Mexico&quot;, rescuing all twelve members of the barque&#x27;s crew. In the process, the crew shattered three of her oars, and the small craft was filled numerous times with water.

The bodies of the unfortunate lifeboatmen (who were fishermen by trade) were removed from the beaches and laid out in the coaching house of the nearby Birkdale Palace Hotel. The coach house was later converted to a public house, being named &quot;The Fishermen&#x27;s Rest,&quot; and is reputed to be haunted by the spirits of the dead men.

The disaster is the worst in the history of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), with 27 lifeboat crew lost.

A public fund for relief of the sixteen widows and fifty orphans was opened with the RNLI contributing £2,000, the queen and the emperor of Germany also contributing. £30,000 was raised in total. A memorial statue of a lifeboatman looking out to sea was placed on the Promenade at St. Anne&#x27;s. At Southport, a memorial was erected in the Cemetery and a permanent exhibition can be seen in The Atkinson Museum on Lord Street, Southport. A further memorial was placed in the churchyard of St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church, Lytham.

In 1925, the RNLI withdrew its service in Southport and left the town with no lifeboat. However, in the late 1980s, after a series of unfortunate tragedies, local families from Southport started to raise funds and eventually bought a new lifeboat for the town stationed at the old RNLI boathouse. The Southport Offshore Rescue Trust is completely independent of the RNLI and like the RNLI it depends entirely on charitable funding.

==Aftermath==

Sixteen women were left widows, and fifty children lost their fathers. Queen Victoria and the Kaiser sent their condolences to the families of the lifeboatmen. An appeal was launched to raise money to provide a memorial to those killed, and the organisation by Sir Charles Macara of the first street collections in Manchester in 1891 led to the first flag days. The disaster has a permanent memorial in Lytham St. Annes lifeboat house. An appeal has been launched by the Lytham St. Annes Civic Society for the restoration of four of the memorials.

==Memorials==

Memorials to the tragedy were erected on the Promenade at St. Annes, in the lifeboat house at Lytham St. Annes, in St. Annes parish church, in St Cuthbert&#x27;s Churchyard, Lytham and at Layton Cemetery. A further memorial was erected at Duke Street Cemetery, Southport.

==Further history==
&quot;Mexico&quot; was refloated on 11 March 1887. She was sold for £45, becoming a temporary tourist attraction at Lytham St Annes. She was eventually lost in Scottish waters in 1890.

==Television==
The story of the wreck of the &quot;Mexico&quot; was featured in an episode of the BBC TV programme &quot;Coast&quot;, appearing in the fifth episode of the first series, first broadcast on 3 July 2005.

<text>Broadway theatre, or Broadway, is a theater genre that consists of the theatrical performances presented in 41 professional theaters, each with 500 or more seats, in the Theater District and Lincoln Center along Broadway, in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Broadway and London&#x27;s West End together represent the highest commercial level of live theater in the English-speaking world.

While the Broadway thoroughfare is eponymous with the district, it is closely identified with Times Square. Only three theaters are located on Broadway itself: the Broadway Theatre, Palace Theatre, and Winter Garden Theatre. The rest are located on the numbered cross streets, extending from the Nederlander Theatre one block south of Times Square on West 41st Street, north along either side of Broadway to 53rd Street, and Vivian Beaumont Theater, at Lincoln Center on West 65th Street. While exceptions exist, the term &quot;Broadway theatre&quot; is used predominantly to describe venues with seating capacities of at least 500 people. Smaller theaters in New York City are referred to as off-Broadway, regardless of location, while very small venues with fewer than 101 seats are called off-off-Broadway, a term that can also apply to non-commercial, avant-garde, or productions held outside of traditional theater venues.

The Theater District is an internationally prominent tourist attraction in New York City. According to The Broadway League, shows on Broadway sold approximately US$1.54 billion worth of tickets in both the 2022–2023 and the 2023–2024 seasons. Both seasons featured theater attendance of approximately 12.3 million each.

Most Broadway shows are musicals. Historian Martin Shefter argues that &quot;Broadway musicals, culminating in the productions of Rodgers and Hammerstein, became enormously influential forms of American popular culture&quot; and contributed to making New York City the cultural capital of the world.

==History==
===Early theatre in New York===

New York City&#x27;s first significant theatre was established in the mid-18th century, around 1750, when actor-managers Walter Murray and Thomas Kean established a resident theatre company at the Theatre on Nassau Street in Lower Manhattan, which held about 280 people. They presented William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and ballad operas such as &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;. In 1752, William Hallam sent a company of twelve actors from Britain to the colonies with his brother Lewis as their manager. They established a theatre in Williamsburg, Virginia, and opened with &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; and &quot;The Anatomist&quot;. The company moved to New York in 1753, performing ballad operas and ballad-farces like &quot;Damon and Phillida&quot;.

During the Revolutionary War, theatre was suspended in New York City. But after the war&#x27;s end, theatre resumed in 1798, when the 2,000-seat Park Theatre was built on Chatham Street on present-day Park Row. A second major theatre, Bowery Theatre, opened in 1826, followed by others.

By the 1840s, P.T. Barnum was operating an entertainment complex in Lower Manhattan. In 1829, at Broadway and Prince Street, Niblo&#x27;s Garden opened and soon became one of New York&#x27;s premier nightspots. The 3,000-seat theatre presented all sorts of musical and non-musical entertainments. In 1844, Palmo&#x27;s Opera House opened and presented opera for only four seasons before bankruptcy led to its rebranding as a venue for plays under the name Burton&#x27;s Theatre. The Astor Opera House opened in 1847. A riot broke out in 1849 when the lower-class patrons of the Bowery Theatre objected to what they perceived as snobbery by the upper-class audiences at Astor Place: &quot;After the Astor Place Riot of 1849, entertainment in New York City was divided along class lines: opera was chiefly for the upper-middle and upper classes, minstrel shows and melodramas for the middle-class, variety shows in concert saloons for men of the working class and the slumming middle-class.&quot;

The plays of William Shakespeare were frequently performed on the Broadway stage during the period, most notably by American actor Edwin Booth who was internationally known for his performance as Hamlet. Booth played the role for a famous 100 consecutive performances at the Winter Garden Theatre in 1865 (with the run ending just a few months before Booth&#x27;s brother John Wilkes Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln), and would later revive the role at his own Booth&#x27;s Theatre (which was managed for a time by his brother Junius Brutus Booth Jr.). Other renowned Shakespeareans who appeared in New York in this era were Henry Irving, Tommaso Salvini, Fanny Davenport, and Charles Fechter.

===Birth of the musical and post-Civil War===
Theatre in New York moved from Downtown gradually to Midtown Manhattan, beginning around 1850, seeking less expensive real estate. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the area that now comprises the Theater District was owned by a handful of families and comprised a few farms. In 1836, Mayor Cornelius Lawrence opened 42nd Street and invited Manhattanites to &quot;enjoy the pure clean air.&quot; Close to 60 years later, theatrical entrepreneur Oscar Hammerstein I built the iconic Victoria Theater on West 42nd Street.

Broadway&#x27;s first &quot;long-run&quot; musical was a 50-performance hit called &quot;The Elves&quot; in 1857. In 1870, the heart of Broadway was in Union Square, and by the end of the century, many theatres were near Madison Square. Theatres arrived in the Times Square area in the early 1900s, and the Broadway theatres consolidated there after a large number were built around the square in the 1920s and 1930s. New York runs continued to lag far behind those in London, but Laura Keene&#x27;s &quot;musical burletta&quot; &quot;The Seven Sisters&quot; (1860) shattered previous New York records with a run of 253 performances.
The first theatre piece that conforms to the modern conception of a musical, adding dance and original music that helped to tell the story, is considered to be &quot;The Black Crook&quot;, which premiered in New York on September 12, 1866. The production was five-and-a-half hours long, but despite its length, it ran for a record-breaking 474 performances. The same year, &quot;The Black Domino/Between You, Me and the Post&quot; was the first show to call itself a &quot;musical comedy&quot;.

Tony Pastor opened the first vaudeville theatre one block east of Union Square in 1881, where Lillian Russell performed. Comedians Edward Harrigan and Tony Hart produced and starred in musicals on Broadway between 1878 (&quot;The Mulligan Guard Picnic&quot;) and 1890, with book and lyrics by Harrigan and music by his father-in-law David Braham. These musical comedies featured characters and situations taken from the everyday life of New York&#x27;s lower classes and represented a significant step forward from vaudeville and burlesque, towards a more literate form. They starred high-quality professional singers (Lillian Russell, Vivienne Segal, and Fay Templeton), instead of the amateurs, often sex workers, who had starred in earlier musical forms.

As transportation improved, poverty in New York diminished, and street lighting made for safer travel at night, the number of potential patrons for the growing number of theatres increased enormously. Plays could run longer and still draw in the audiences, leading to better profits and improved production values. As in England, during the latter half of the century, the theatre began to be cleaned up, with less prostitution hindering the attendance of the theatre by women. Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s family-friendly comic opera hits, beginning with &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; in 1878, were imported to New York (by the authors and also in numerous unlicensed productions). They were imitated in New York by American productions such as Reginald Dekoven&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1891) and John Philip Sousa&#x27;s &quot;El Capitan&quot; (1896), along with operas, ballets, and other British and European hits.
Charles H. Hoyt&#x27;s &quot;A Trip to Chinatown&quot; (1891) became Broadway&#x27;s long-run champion when it surpassed &quot;Adonis&quot; and its 603 total performances in 1893, holding the stage for 657 performances. &quot;Chinatown&quot; itself was surpassed by the musical &quot;Irene&quot; (1919) in 1921 as the longest-running Broadway musical, and even earlier, in March 1920, by &quot;Lightnin&#x27;&quot; (1918) as the longest-running Broadway show. In 1896, theatre owners Marc Klaw and A. L. Erlanger formed the Theatrical Syndicate, which controlled almost every legitimate theatre in the U.S. for the next sixteen years. However, smaller vaudeville and variety houses proliferated, and Off-Broadway was well established by the end of the nineteenth century.

&quot;A Trip to Coontown&quot; (1898) was the first musical comedy entirely produced and performed by African Americans in a Broadway theatre (inspired largely by the routines of the minstrel shows), followed by the ragtime-tinged &quot;&quot; (1898), and the highly successful &quot;In Dahomey&quot; (1902). Hundreds of musical comedies were staged on Broadway in the 1890s and early 1900s made up of songs written in New York&#x27;s Tin Pan Alley involving composers such as Gus Edwards, John Walter Bratton, and George M. Cohan (&quot;Little Johnny Jones&quot; (1904), &quot;45 Minutes From Broadway&quot; (1906), and &quot;George Washington Jr.&quot; (1906)). Still, New York runs continued to be relatively short, with a few exceptions, compared with London runs, until World War I.
A few very successful British musicals continued to achieve great success in New York, including &quot;Florodora&quot; in 1900–01.

===Early 20th century===

In the early years of the twentieth century, translations of popular late-nineteenth century continental operettas were joined by the &quot;Princess Theatre&quot; shows of the 1910s, by writers such as P. G. Wodehouse, Guy Bolton, and Harry B. Smith. Victor Herbert, whose work included some intimate musical plays with modern settings as well as his string of famous operettas (&quot;The Fortune Teller&quot; (1898), &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; (1903), &quot;Mlle. Modiste&quot; (1905), &quot;The Red Mill&quot; (1906), and &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot; (1910)).

Beginning with &quot;The Red Mill&quot;, Broadway shows installed electric signs outside the theatres. Since colored bulbs burned out too quickly, white lights were used, and Broadway was nicknamed &quot;The Great White Way&quot;. In August 1919, the Actors&#x27; Equity Association demanded a standard contract for all professional productions. After a strike shut down all the theatres, the producers were forced to agree. By the 1920s, the Shubert Brothers had risen to take over the majority of the theatres from the Erlanger syndicate.

During this time, the play &quot;Lightnin&#x27;&quot; by Winchell Smith and Frank Bacon became the first Broadway show to reach 700 performances. From then, it would go on to become the first show to reach 1,000 performances. &quot;Lightnin&quot;&#x27; was the longest-running Broadway show until being overtaken in performance totals by &quot;Abie&#x27;s Irish Rose&quot; in 1925.

===Competing with motion pictures===
The motion picture mounted a challenge to the stage. At first, films were silent and presented only limited competition. By the end of the 1920s, films like &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; were presented with synchronized sound, and critics wondered if cinema would replace live theatre altogether. While live vaudeville could not compete with these inexpensive films that featured vaudeville stars and major comedians of the day, other theatres survived. The musicals of the Roaring Twenties, borrowing from vaudeville, music hall, and other light entertainment, tended to ignore plot in favor of emphasizing star actors and actresses, big dance routines, and popular songs.

Florenz Ziegfeld produced annual spectacular song-and-dance revues on Broadway featuring extravagant sets and elaborate costumes, but there was little to tie the various numbers together. Typical of the 1920s were lighthearted productions such as &quot;Sally&quot;; &quot;Lady Be Good&quot;; &quot;Sunny&quot;; &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;; &quot;Harlem&quot;; &quot;Oh, Kay!&quot;; and &quot;Funny Face&quot;. Their books may have been forgettable, but they produced enduring standards from George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, Vincent Youmans, and Rodgers and Hart, among others, and Noël Coward, Sigmund Romberg, and Rudolf Friml continued in the vein of Victor Herbert. Live theatre has survived the invention of cinema.

===Between the wars===
Leaving these comparatively frivolous entertainments behind and taking the drama a step forward, &quot;Show Boat&quot; premiered on December 27, 1927, at the Ziegfeld Theatre. It represented a complete integration of book and score, with dramatic themes, as told through the music, dialogue, setting, and movement, woven together more seamlessly than in previous musicals. It ran for 572 performances.The 1920s also spawned a new age of American playwright with the emergence of Eugene O&#x27;Neill, whose plays &quot;Beyond the Horizon&quot;, &quot;Anna Christie&quot;, &quot;The Hairy Ape&quot;, &quot;Strange Interlude&quot;, and &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; proved that there was an audience for serious drama on Broadway, and O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s success paved the way for major dramatists like Elmer Rice, Maxwell Anderson, Robert E. Sherwood, Clifford Odets, Tennessee Williams, and Arthur Miller, as well as writers of comedy like George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. Classical revivals also proved popular with Broadway theatre-goers, notably John Barrymore in &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Richard III, &quot;John Gielgud in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; and &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, Walter Hampden and José Ferrer in &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, Paul Robeson and Ferrer in &quot;Othello&quot;, Maurice Evans in &quot;Richard II&quot; and the plays of George Bernard Shaw, and Katharine Cornell in such plays as &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, and &quot;Candida&quot;.

In 1930, Theatre Guild&#x27;s production of &quot;Roar, China!&quot; was Broadway&#x27;s first play with a majority Asian cast.

As World War II approached, a dozen Broadway dramas addressed the rise of Nazism in Europe and the issue of American non-intervention. The most successful was Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot;, which opened in April 1941.

===Postwar era===
After the lean years of the Great Depression, Broadway theatre had entered a golden age with the blockbuster hit &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, in 1943, which ran for 2,212 performances. According to John Kenrick&#x27;s writings on Broadway musicals, &quot;Every season saw new stage musicals send songs to the top of the charts. Public demand, a booming economy and abundant creative talent kept Broadway hopping. To this day, the shows of the 1950s form the core of the musical theatre repertory.&quot;

===Decline in late 1960s===
Kenrick notes that &quot;the late 1960s marked a time of cultural upheaval. All those changes would prove painful for many, including those behind the scenes, as well as those in the audience.&quot; Of the 1970s, Kenrick writes: &quot;Just when it seemed that traditional book musicals were back in style, the decade ended with critics and audiences giving mixed signals.&quot;

Ken Bloom observed that &quot;The 1960s and 1970s saw a worsening of the area [Times Square] and a drop in the number of legitimate shows produced on Broadway.&quot; By way of comparison, in the 1950 to 1951 season (May to May), 94 productions opened on Broadway; in the 1969 to 1970 season (June to May), there were 59 productions (fifteen were revivals). In the 1920s, there were 70–80 theaters; however, by 1969, there were 36 left.

During this time, many Broadway productions struggled due to low attendance rates, which resulted in perceived mediocrity among such plays. For this reason, the Theatre Development Fund was created with the purpose of assisting productions with high cultural value that likely would struggle without subsidization, by offering tickets to those plays to consumers at reduced prices.

===Resurgence in early 1980s===
In early 1982, Joe Papp, the theatrical producer and director who established The Public Theater, led the &quot;Save the Theatres&quot; campaign. It was a not-for-profit group supported by the Actors Equity union to save the theater buildings in the neighborhood from demolition by monied Manhattan development interests. Papp provided resources, recruited a publicist and celebrated actors, and provided audio, lighting, and technical crews for the effort.

At Papp&#x27;s behest, in July 1982, a bill was introduced in the 97th Congress, entitled &quot;H.R.6885, A bill to designate the Broadway/Times Square Theatre District in the City of New York as a national historic site&quot;. The legislation would have provided certain U.S. government resources and assistance to help the city preserve the district. Faced with strong opposition and lobbying by Mayor Ed Koch&#x27;s Administration and corporate Manhattan development interests, the bill was not passed. The Save the Theatres campaign then turned their efforts to supporting the establishment of the Theater District as a registered historic district. In December 1983, Save the Theatres prepared &quot;The Broadway Theater District, a Preservation Development and Management Plan&quot;, and demanded that each theater in the district receive landmark designation. Mayor Ed Koch ultimately reacted by creating a Theater Advisory Council, which included Papp.

===COVID-19 impact===
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, Broadway theaters closed on March 12, 2020, shuttering 16 shows that were playing or were in the process of opening. The Broadway League shutdown was extended first to April, then to May, then June, then September 2020 and January 2021, and later to June 1, 2021. Then-governor Andrew Cuomo announced that most sectors of New York would have their restrictions lifted on May 19, 2021, but he stated that Broadway theatres would not be able to immediately resume performances on this date due to logistical reasons. In May 2021, Cuomo announced that Broadway theaters would be allowed to reopen on September 14, and the League confirmed that performances would begin to resume in the fall season.

&quot;Springsteen on Broadway&quot; became the first full-length show to resume performances, opening on June 26, 2021, to 1,721 vaccinated patrons at the St. James Theatre. &quot;Pass Over&quot; then had its first preview on August 4, and opened on August 22, 2021, becoming the first new play to open. &quot;Hadestown&quot; and &quot;Waitress&quot; were the first musicals to resume performances on September 2, 2021. The 74th Tony Awards were also postponed; the Tony nominations were announced on October 15, 2020, and took place on September 26, 2021. On July 30, 2021, it was announced that all Broadway theaters required attendees to provide proof of full COVID-19 vaccination. The rule applied to guests ages 12+. Those under age 12 were required to provide a negative COVID-19 test (PCR within 72 hours or antigen within six hours of the performance start time). Beginning November 8, those ages 5–11 also had the option to provide proof of at least one vaccination shot. Effective December 14, in accordance with NYC&#x27;s vaccination mandate, guests ages 5–11 were required to have at least one vaccination shot until January 29, 2022, where they had to be fully vaccinated. The vaccine mandate lasted until April 30, and attendees were also required to wear face masks until July 1.

During the COVID-19 shutdown, the Shubert Organization, the Nederlander Organization, and Jujamcyn had pledged to increase racial and cultural diversity in their theaters, including naming at least one theater for a Black theatrical personality. The August Wilson Theatre, owned by Jujamcyn, had been renamed after Black playwright August Wilson in 2005. The Shuberts announced in March 2022 that the Cort Theatre, which was under renovation at the time, would be renamed after actor James Earl Jones. In June 2022, the Nederlanders announced that the Brooks Atkinson Theatre would be renamed after Lena Horne, The James Earl Jones Theatre was rededicated in September 2022, while the Lena Horne Theatre was rededicated that November.

==Description==
===Schedule===
Although there are some exceptions, shows with open-ended runs generally have evening performances Tuesday through Saturday, with a 7:00 p.m. or 8:00 p.m. &quot;curtain&quot;. The afternoon &quot;&quot; performances are at 2:00 p.m. on Wednesdays and Saturdays and at 3:00 p.m. on Sundays. This makes for an eight-performance week. On this schedule, most shows do not play on Monday and the shows and theatres are said to be &quot;dark&quot; on that day. The actors and the crew in these shows tend to regard Sunday evening through Monday evening as their weekend. The Tony award presentation ceremony is usually held on a Sunday evening in June to fit this schedule.

In recent years, some shows have moved their Tuesday show time an hour earlier to 7:00 pm. The rationale for this move was that since fewer tourists take in shows midweek, Tuesday attendance depends more on local patrons. The earlier curtain makes it possible for suburban patrons to get home by a reasonable hour after the show. Some shows, especially those Disney produces, change their performance schedules fairly frequently depending on the season. This is done in order to maximize access to their target audience.

===Producers and theatre owners===
Most Broadway producers and theatre owners are members of The Broadway League (formerly &quot;The League of American Theatres and Producers&quot;), a trade organization that promotes Broadway theatre as a whole, negotiates contracts with the various theatrical unions and agreements with the guilds, and co-administers the Tony Awards with the American Theatre Wing, a service organization. While the League and the theatrical unions are sometimes at loggerheads during those periods when new contracts are being negotiated, they also cooperate on many projects and events designed to promote professional theatre in New York.

Of the four non-profit theatre companies with Broadway theatres, all four (Lincoln Center Theater, Manhattan Theatre Club, Roundabout Theatre Company, and Second Stage Theatre) belong to the League of Resident Theatres and have contracts with the theatrical unions which are negotiated separately from the other Broadway theatre and producers. (Disney also negotiates apart from the League, as did Livent before it closed down its operations.)

The majority of Broadway theatres are owned or managed by three organizations: the Shubert Organization, a for-profit arm of the non-profit Shubert Foundation, which owns seventeen theatres; the Nederlander Organization, which controls nine theatres; and ATG Entertainment, which owns seven Broadway houses.

===Personnel===
Both musicals and straight plays on Broadway often rely on casting well-known performers in leading roles to draw larger audiences or bring in new audience members to the theatre. Actors from film and television are frequently cast for the revivals of Broadway shows or are used to replace actors leaving a cast. There are still, however, performers who are primarily stage actors, spending most of their time &quot;on the boards&quot;, and appearing in screen roles only secondarily. As Patrick Healy of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted:

Broadway once had many homegrown stars who committed to working on a show for a year, as Nathan Lane has for &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. In 2010, some theater heavyweights like Mr. Lane were not even nominated; instead, several Tony Awards were given for productions that were always intended to be short-timers on Broadway, given that many of their film-star performers had to move on to other commitments.

According to Mark Shenton, &quot;One of the biggest changes to the commercial theatrical landscape—on both sides of the Atlantic—over the past decade or so is that sightings of big star names turning out to do plays has [sic] gone up; but the runs they are prepared to commit to has gone down. Time was that a producer would require a minimum commitment from his star of six months, and perhaps a year; now, the 13-week run is the norm.&quot;

The minimum size of the Broadway orchestra is governed by an agreement with the musicians&#x27; union (Local 802, American Federation of Musicians) and The Broadway League. For example, the agreement specifies the minimum size of the orchestra at the Minskoff Theatre to be eighteen, while at the Music Box Theatre it is nine.

===Runs===
Most Broadway shows are commercial productions intended to make a profit for the producers and investors (&quot;backers&quot; or &quot;angels&quot;), and therefore have open-ended runs (duration that the production plays), meaning that the length of their presentation is not set beforehand, but depends on critical response, word of mouth, and the effectiveness of the show&#x27;s advertising, all of which determine ticket sales. Investing in a commercial production carries a varied degree of financial risk. Shows need not make a profit immediately; should they make their &quot;nut&quot; (weekly operating expenses), or lose money at a rate acceptable to the producers, they may continue to run in the expectation that, eventually, they will pay back their initial costs and become profitable. In some borderline situations, producers may ask that royalties be temporarily reduced or waived, or even that performers—with the permission of their unions—take reduced salaries, to prevent a show from closing. Theatre owners, who are not generally profit participants in most productions, may waive or reduce rents, or even lend money to a show to keep it running.

Some Broadway shows are produced by non-commercial organizations as part of a regular subscription season—Lincoln Center Theatre, Roundabout Theatre Company, Manhattan Theatre Club, and Second Stage Theater are the four non-profit theatre companies that currently have permanent Broadway venues. Some other productions are produced on Broadway with &quot;limited engagement runs&quot; for several reasons, including financial issues, prior engagements of the performers, or temporary availability of a theatre between the end of one production and the beginning of another. However, some shows with planned limited engagement runs may, after critical acclaim or box office success, extend their engagements or convert to open-ended runs. This was the case with 2007&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, 2009&#x27;s &quot;God of Carnage&quot;, 2012&#x27;s &quot;Newsies&quot;, and 2022&#x27;s &quot;Take Me Out&quot;.

Historically, musicals on Broadway tend to have longer runs than &quot;straight&quot; (i.e., non-musical) plays. On January 9, 2006, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; at the Majestic Theatre became the longest-running Broadway musical, with 7,486 performances, overtaking &quot;Cats&quot;. &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; closed on Broadway on April 16, 2023, soon after celebrating its 35th anniversary, after a total of 13,981 performances.

===Audience===
Attending a Broadway show is a common tourist activity in New York. The TKTS booths sell same-day tickets (and in certain cases, next-day matinee tickets) for many Broadway and Off-Broadway shows at a discount of 20 to 50%. The TKTS booths are located in Times Square, in Lower Manhattan, and at Lincoln Center. This service is run by Theatre Development Fund. Many Broadway theatres also offer special student rates, same-day &quot;rush&quot; or &quot;lottery&quot; tickets, or standing-room tickets to help ensure that their theatres are as full—and their grosses as high—as possible.

According to The Broadway League, total Broadway attendance was 14.77 million in 2018–2019, compared to 13.79 million in 2017–2018. The average age of the Broadway audience in the 2017–18 theater season was 40, the lowest it had been in nearly two decades. By 2018, about 20% of Broadway tickets were sold to international visitors, although many visitors reported not being able to use their tickets. In 2022–2023, the first full season since the COVID-19 pandemic, Broadway theaters sold 12.3 million tickets, of which 35% were to local residents and 17% to international visitors. At the time, the average age of theatergoers was 40.4; nearly two-thirds of the audience were women; and 29% identified as a racial minority.

===Off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway===
The classification of theatres is governed by language in Actors&#x27; Equity Association contracts. To be eligible for a Tony, a production must be in a house with 500 seats or more and in the Theater District, which are the criteria that define Broadway theatre. Off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway shows often provide a more experimental, challenging, and intimate performance than is possible in the larger Broadway theatres. Some Broadway shows, however, such as the musicals &quot;Hair&quot;, &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, &quot;Spring Awakening&quot;, &quot;Next to Normal&quot;, &quot;Rent&quot;, &quot;Avenue Q&quot;, &quot;In the Heights&quot;, &quot;Fun Home&quot;, &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;, &quot;Dear Evan Hansen&quot;, and &quot;Hamilton&quot;, began their runs Off-Broadway and later transferred to Broadway, seeking to replicate their intimate experience in a larger theatre. Other productions are first developed through workshops and then out-of-town tryouts before transferring to Broadway. &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; famously skipped an out-of-town tryout and attempted to do an in-town tryout—actually preview performances—on Broadway before its official opening, with disastrous results.

===Broadway national tours===
After, or even during, successful runs in Broadway theatres, producers often remount their productions with new casts and crew for the Broadway national tour, which travels to theatres in major cities across the country. Sometimes when a show closes on Broadway, the entire production, with most if not all of the original cast intact, is relaunched as a touring company, hence the name &quot;Broadway national tour&quot;. Some shows may even have several touring companies out at a time, whether the show is still running in New York or not, with many companies &quot;sitting down&quot; in other major cities for their own extended runs. For Broadway national tours of top-tier cities, the entire Broadway production is transplanted almost entirely intact and may run for many months (or years) at each stop. For example, the first U.S. tour of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; required 26 53-foot-long (16.1 m) semi-trailers to transport all its sets, equipment, and costumes, and it took almost 10 days to properly unload all those trucks and install everything into a theater.

Second-tier and smaller cities can also attract national tours, but these are more likely to be &quot;bus and truck&quot; tours. These are scaled-down versions of the larger, national touring productions, historically acquiring their name because the casts generally traveled by bus instead of by air, while the sets and equipment traveled by truck. Tours of this type often run for weeks rather than months, and frequently feature a reduced physical production to accommodate smaller venues and tighter schedules, and to fit into fewer trucks. A typical second-tier city can usually sell only up to about eight shows (one week) of tickets. For cities smaller than that, a touring production might move twice a week (&quot;split weeks&quot;) or every day (&quot;one-nighters&quot;). For &quot;bus and truck&quot; tours, the production values are usually less lavish than the typical Broadway national tour or national touring production, and the actors, while still members of the actors&#x27; union, are compensated under a different, less lucrative union contract. The Touring Broadway Awards, presented by The Broadway League, honored excellence in touring Broadway.

===Awards===
Broadway productions and artists are honored by the annual Antoinette Perry Awards (commonly called the &quot;Tony Awards&quot;, or &quot;Tonys&quot;), given by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League, and that were first presented in 1947. The Tony is Broadway&#x27;s most prestigious award, comparable to the Academy Awards for Hollywood film productions. Their importance has increased since 1967 when the awards presentation show began to be broadcast on national television. In a strategy to improve the television ratings, celebrities are often chosen to host the show, some with scant connection to the theatre. The most recent Tony Awards ceremony was held on June 16, 2024. Other awards given to Broadway productions include the Drama Desk Award, presented since 1955, the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Awards, first given in 1936, and the Outer Critics Circle Award, initially presented in 1950.

<doc id="725256" wikidata="Q2082064" url="?curid=725256" title="Consommé">
<text>In cooking, a consommé is a type of clear soup made from richly flavoured stock or broth that has been clarified, a process that uses egg whites to remove fat and sediment.

Consommé has three English pronunciations: traditionally in the UK, the stress is on the middle syllable; in modern UK English, the stress is on the first; and in the US the stress is on the last.

A large amount of meat only yields a small amount of consommé; in some recipes, as much as of meat can go into a single serving. This low yield is part of what has traditionally given consommé its refined reputation as an expensive dish.

==History==
Clarified broths called consommés have been in use since the Middle Ages, taking many forms from simple soups, to soups made from the meat of a wide variety of less-common animals. The clarification process also historically utilised blood rather than egg whites.

A special type of consommé that was boiled solely with tendons and cartilage without the addition of salt was sweetened, flavoured with fruits and served as dessert. These sweetened consommé creations are essentially the forerunners of present-day gelatin desserts.

==Cooking==

A consommé is made by adding a mixture of ground meats, together with mirepoix (a combination of carrots, celery, and onion), tomatoes, and egg whites into either bouillon or stock.

Cartilage and tendons should be left on the meat because of the gelatin they contain, which enhances the mouthfeel of the soup. If beef or veal is used, shin meat is ideal because it is very low in fat and very high in gristle, and although it is undesirable for most other purposes, it is near essential for the flavour of the consommé. The meat is best if it is ground very fine, as if for a mousseline.

The key to making a high-quality consommé is simmering; the act of simmering, combined with frequent stirring, brings impurities to the surface of the liquid, which are further drawn out due to the presence of acid from the tomatoes. Eventually, the solids begin to congeal at the surface of the liquid, forming a &#x27;raft&#x27;, which is caused by the proteins in the egg whites. Once the &#x27;raft&#x27; begins to form, the heat is reduced, and the consommé is simmered at a lower heat until it reaches the desired flavour, which usually takes anywhere from 45 minutes to over an hour. The resulting concoction is a clear liquid that has either a rich amber colour (for beef or veal consommé) or a very pale yellow colour (for poultry consommé).

The liquid is then carefully drawn from the pot and passed again through a filter to ensure its purity, and is then put through a lengthy process where all of the visible fat is skimmed from the surface. To ensure total purification, the consommé can be refrigerated, which draws out remaining fat, which can easily be skimmed off with a cheesecloth. Alternatively, the consommé can be placed in a wide, shallow container such as a sauté pan or large bowl and wide strips of parchment paper can be dragged along the surface; the tiny amounts of remaining fat adhere to the parchment, leaving the consommé perfectly de-greased.

==Serving==
Consommés are usually served piping hot because they tend to cool down more quickly than other soups and form a gel. They are most often served with garnishes, which vary in complexity from a simple splash of sherry or egg yolk, to cut vegetables, to shaped savoury custards called &#x27;royales&#x27;.

Some types of consommé such as tomato are traditionally served chilled, which keeps their clearness.

==Varieties==
Double consommé is made to double strength. There are at least three methods of producing one, the first of which is doubling the quantity of meat used in the recipe, the second of which is producing one of normal strength and reducing it to half its volume, and the third of which is producing one with all water in the recipe replaced with equal quantities of an already-prepared consommé. It is often found in other cold-cuisine items, especially those that use aspic, or natural gelatin.

Another common variation is chilled or jellied consommé. They are served cold and thickened naturally by the gelatin extracted from the bones when the original stock is made. The gelatin gives them a gelatinous texture when set to cool. Additional gelatin may be added during the last part of the clarification process to ensure that it sets properly.

&quot;Consommé madrilène&quot; is a clear soup that is pure and clean-tasting, typically flavored with tomato, and served chilled.

==Gelatin-filtered &quot;consommé&quot;==
In a 2007 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, Harold McGee popularized an alternative method for clarifying broths, originating among chefs of the molecular gastronomy movement: gelatin filtration. Gelatin-filtration is a novel method of clarification, relying on some of the properties of a super- solution of gelatin, created by freezing, to remove macroscopic particles that cause cloudiness from a water-based stock. This method is distinct from traditional consommé both in technique and in final product, as gelatin filtration results in a gelatin-free broth, while traditional consommé gives a final product rich in gelatin, with a correspondingly rich mouthfeel. Also traditional consommé gels when chilled, while a gelatin-filtered consommé does not.

Freezing a water-based solution converts all bulk water into ice crystals, but water associated with solutes—in the case of a soup stock, gelatin, fat, and flavor compounds—remains unfrozen to much lower temperatures; in practice, the freezing temperature of this associated water is well below the reach of conventional freezers. Thus, gelatin filtration works by freezing a gelatin-containing, water-based solution and then allowing it to thaw in a mesh strainer at just above the freezing temperature of water. The gelatin and other solutes concentrate in the unfrozen, associated water, and the gelatin forms a stable network through cross-linking, just as it would in a standard gel. This stable network acts as a filter, trapping large particles of fat or protein, while allowing water and smaller, flavor-active compounds to pass. As the bulk water melts, it passes first through the gelatin network and then through the mesh strainer, into a receiving vessel. Because the temperature is kept just above the freezing point, the bulk water melts slowly and, as it is strained into a separate vessel, it is never in contact with the gelatin for long enough to begin dissolving the gelatin network. After all of the bulk water melts, the gelatin network remains in the strainer with the trapped macroscopic particles, and the clarified stock (the bulk water and flavor compounds) is collected in the receiving vessel.

Because gelatin-filtered consommés do not require a creation of an egg-white raft as in traditional consommés, they are less wasteful. The technique is also applicable to a wider range of &quot;stocks&quot;: since no heating is required, heat-sensitive materials, such as fruit juices, can be clarified by first adding a small amount of gelatin, then applying gelatin filtration. A number of non-traditional consommés, not based on stock, have been created using this method, including &quot;pretzel&quot;, &quot;Doritos, &quot;brown butter&quot;, and &quot;spiced pumpkin&quot;.

<text>The Nestor Film Company, originally known as the Nestor Motion Picture Company, was an American motion picture production company. It was founded in 1909 as the West Coast production unit of the Centaur Film Company located in Bayonne, New Jersey. While not the first movie studio in Los Angeles, Nestor made great strides on October 27, 1911, by establishing the first permanent motion picture studio in Hollywood, California, and producing the first Hollywood films. The company later merged with its distributor, the Universal Film Manufacturing Company, on May 20, 1912. Nestor remained a recognizable brand name for Universal until at least the middle of 1917.

==History==
The Nestor Film Company was founded in 1909 as the West Coast production unit of the Centaur Film Company located in Bayonne, New Jersey, owned and operated by David Horsley and his brother, William Horsley.

On October 27, 1911, Nestor opened the first movie studio actually located in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles. It was at the Blondeau Tavern building on the northwest corner of Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street. The first motion picture stage in Hollywood was built behind the tavern.

Other East Coast studios had moved production to Los Angeles, prior to Nestor&#x27;s move west. The California weather allowed for year-round filming and the ambitious studio operated three principal divisions under its Canadian-born general manager, Al Christie. Christie moved permanently to Southern California from the East, where he had been working with the Horsleys creating the popular silent-era &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; comedy shorts.

One division at the Hollywood location, under director Milton H. Fahrney, made a one-reel Western picture every week, while at the same time the second division, under director Tom Ricketts, turned out a one-reel drama. In addition to running the operation, Christie oversaw a weekly production of a one-reel &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; episode.

The Horsley brothers remained in New Jersey, where their laboratory and offices handled the Hollywood studio&#x27;s film processing and distribution. 

Other filmmakers began opening studios in the Hollywood area. 

On May 20, 1912, the Nestor Film Company merged with the Universal Film Manufacturing Company, headed by Carl Laemmle. Several other motion picture companies, including Laemmle&#x27;s Independent Moving Pictures (IMP), merged with Universal, which had been founded in April 1912. Nestor became a brand name that Universal used until at least mid-1917.

<text>David Horsley (March 11, 1873 – February 23, 1933) was an English-American pioneer of the film industry. He founded the Centaur Film Company and its West Coast branch, the Nestor Film Company, which established the first film studio in Hollywood in 1911.

==Biography==
Horsley was born in Stanley, County Durham in northern England.

In 1884, the family moved to Bayonne, New Jersey where as a young man he built a bicycle business and ran a pool hall. It was then that he met a former employee of Biograph Studios, Charles Gorman, and along with his brother William Horsley (1870–1956), they formed the Centaur Film Company. By 1910 their operation was producing three films a week, including the &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; comedies.

David and William Horsley, along with other film independents, succeeded in defeating the monopolistic hold on the industry of Thomas Edison&#x27;s Motion Picture Patents Company. However, weather conditions on the East Coast made filming an uncertain proposition because camera technology at the time relied on sunshine. Frustrated, and realizing that California afforded the opportunity to make films year round, David Horsley moved his operations to the West Coast.

Among the first motion pictures ever filmed in Hollywood was taken on October 26, 1911 in the orchards of H J Whitley&#x27;s estate (D.W. Griffith filmed &quot;Love Among the Roses&quot; at the studio of famed French floral painter, Paul de Longpre at his home and studio in Hollywood in 1909). Although the movie never really had a name it is a true piece of Hollywood history. In the fall of 1911, the Nestor Motion Picture Company opened the first motion picture studio in Hollywood in the Blondeau Tavern building at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street. With Horsley was Al Christie who served as general manager in charge of Christie Comedies plus Charles Rosher who lent his expertise as the studio&#x27;s full-time cameraman. Other East Coast film companies recognized Horsley&#x27;s advantage and quickly followed his lead.

In April 1912, the Universal Film Manufacturing Company was formed and David Horsley and other small studios merged, each accepting shares in Universal as payment for their business. Horsley received $175,000 in preferred stock and $204,000 in common stock in the new Universal Film Company and was also appointed the company&#x27;s treasurer. However, the peaceful merger soon turned sour and in 1913 Horsley sold his interest to Carl Laemmle. A wealthy man, David Horsley travelled to his birthplace and around Europe.

After returning to California, and investing in a failed exotic animal show, David Horsley went back into the motion picture business with David Horsley Studios and using the animals from the failed show, established the Bostock Jungle Films Company. By the spring of 1917, he had outfitted his new operations in Los Angeles at Main and Washington streets however a series of setbacks cost Horsley his entire fortune and left him in debt.

David Horsley died in Los Angeles. He is interred in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Hollywood.

His son David Stanley Horsley (1906–1976) trained as a cinematographer and became an expert in special effects photography, working in the film industry for nearly thirty years.

<text>Sir Robert Taylor (1714 – 27 September 1788) was an English architect and sculptor who worked in London and the south of England.

==Early life==
Born at Woodford, Essex, Taylor followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and started working as a stonemason and sculptor, spending time as a pupil of Sir Henry Cheere. Despite some important commissions, including a bust of London merchant Christopher Emmott (died 1745) today held in the church of St Bartholomew, Colne, Lancashire, and another of William Phipps (died 1748), now in the parish church of Westbury, Wiltshire, he enjoyed little success and turned instead to architecture.

==Career==
Among Taylor&#x27;s earliest projects was Asgill House (known then as Richmond Place), built for a wealthy banker, Sir Charles Asgill, in Richmond upon Thames (c. 1760), and nearby Oak House. Through such connections, he came to be appointed as architect to the Bank of England until his death, when he was succeeded by Sir John Soane. In 1769 he succeeded Sir William Chambers as Architect of the King&#x27;s Works. His pupils included John Nash, Samuel Pepys Cockerell, George Byfield and William Pilkington.

He served as a magistrate, and in 1783 served as a Sheriff of London and was knighted the same year.

Sir Robert served as a vice president on the board of the Foundling Hospital, a prominent charity dedicated to the welfare of London&#x27;s abandoned children.

==Personal life==
Taylor and his wife Elizabeth (d. 1803) had a son, Michael Angelo Taylor (1757–1834), who, as MP for Poole, became a Whig politician during the 1830s. His death was caused by catching a chill at his friend Asgill&#x27;s funeral in September 1788. Father and son were buried in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square, London. Taylor is commemorated, with a marble plaque dedicated to him, on the wall of the south transept of Westminster Abbey.
==Legacy==
The Taylor Institution, Oxford University&#x27;s centre for the study of medieval and modern European languages and literature, takes its name from a bequest from Taylor for the purpose of &quot;establishing a foundation for the teaching and improving the European languages&quot;. The money was initially invested and interest left to accrue to cover building costs.

The Sir Robert Taylor Society is an organisation which seeks to bring together modern language teachers in schools and university lecturers from the Faculty of Medieval and Modern Languages, University of Oxford. A meeting is held once a year, shortly before the start of the Michaelmas term, at which talks are given on the literature and culture of the language communities represented in the Oxford faculty, and university admissions trends in the various languages are discussed.

<doc id="725272" wikidata="Q1957365" url="?curid=725272" title="Differential structure">
<text>In mathematics, an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional differential structure (or differentiable structure) on a set &quot;M&quot; makes &quot;M&quot; into an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional differential manifold, which is a topological manifold with some additional structure that allows for differential calculus on the manifold. If &quot;M&quot; is already a topological manifold, it is required that the new topology be identical to the existing one.

==Definition==
For a natural number &quot;n&quot; and some &quot;k&quot; which may be a non-negative integer or infinity, an n&quot;-dimensional &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot; differential structure is defined using a C&quot;&quot;k&quot;-atlas, which is a set of bijections called charts between subsets of &quot;M&quot; (whose union is the whole of &quot;M&quot;) and open subsets of formula_1:

:formula_2

which are &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot;-compatible (in the sense defined below):

Each chart allows a subset of the manifold to be viewed as an open subset of formula_1, but the usefulness of this depends on how much the charts agree when their domains overlap.

Consider two charts:

:formula_4
:formula_5

The intersection of their domains is

:formula_6

whose images under the two charts are 

:formula_7
:formula_8

The transition map between the two charts translates between their images on their shared domain:

:formula_9
:formula_10

Two charts formula_11 are &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot;-compatible if

:formula_12

are open, and the transition maps

:formula_13

have continuous partial derivatives of order &quot;k&quot;. If &quot;k&quot; = 0, we only require that the transition maps are continuous, consequently a &quot;C&quot;0-atlas is simply another way to define a topological manifold. If &quot;k&quot; = ∞, derivatives of all orders must be continuous. A family of &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot;-compatible charts covering the whole manifold is a &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot;-atlas defining a &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot; differential manifold. Two atlases are C&quot;&quot;k&quot;-equivalent if the union of their sets of charts forms a &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot;-atlas. In particular, a &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot;-atlas that is &quot;C&quot;0-compatible with a &quot;C&quot;0-atlas that defines a topological manifold is said to determine a C&quot;&quot;k&quot; differential structure on the topological manifold. The &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot; equivalence classes of such atlases are the distinct &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot; differential structures of the manifold. Each distinct differential structure is determined by a unique maximal atlas, which is simply the union of all atlases in the equivalence class.

For simplification of language, without any loss of precision, one might just call a maximal &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot;−atlas on a given set a &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot;−manifold. This maximal atlas then uniquely determines both the topology and the underlying set, the latter being the union of the domains of all charts, and the former having the set of all these domains as a basis.

==Existence and uniqueness theorems==
For any integer &quot;k&quot; &gt; 0 and any &quot;n&quot;−dimensional &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot;−manifold, the maximal atlas contains a &quot;C&quot;∞−atlas on the same underlying set by a theorem due to Hassler Whitney. It has also been shown that any maximal &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot;−atlas contains some number of &quot;distinct&quot; maximal &quot;C&quot;∞−atlases whenever &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0, although for any pair of these &quot;distinct&quot; &quot;C&quot;∞−atlases there exists a &quot;C&quot;∞−diffeomorphism identifying the two. It follows that there is only one class of smooth structures (modulo pairwise smooth diffeomorphism) over any topological manifold which admits a differentiable structure, i.e. The &quot;C&quot;∞−, structures in a &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot;−manifold. A bit loosely, one might express this by saying that the smooth structure is (essentially) unique. The case for &quot;k&quot; = 0 is different. Namely, there exist topological manifolds which admit no &quot;C&quot;1−structure, a result proved by , and later explained in the context of Donaldson&#x27;s theorem (compare Hilbert&#x27;s fifth problem).

Smooth structures on an orientable manifold are usually counted modulo orientation-preserving smooth homeomorphisms. There then arises the question whether orientation-reversing diffeomorphisms exist. There is an &quot;essentially unique&quot; smooth structure for any topological manifold of dimension smaller than 4. For compact manifolds of dimension greater than 4, there is a finite number of &quot;smooth types&quot;, i.e. equivalence classes of pairwise smoothly diffeomorphic smooth structures. In the case of R&quot;n&quot; with &quot;n&quot; ≠ 4, the number of these types is one, whereas for &quot;n&quot; = 4, there are uncountably many such types. One refers to these by exotic R4.

==Differential structures on spheres of dimension 1 to 20==

The following table lists the number of smooth types of the topological &quot;m&quot;−sphere &quot;S&quot;&quot;m&quot; for the values of the dimension &quot;m&quot; from 1 up to 20. Spheres with a smooth, i.e. &quot;C&quot;∞−differential structure not smoothly diffeomorphic to the usual one are known as exotic spheres.

It is not currently known how many smooth types the topological 4-sphere &quot;S&quot;4 has, except that there is at least one. There may be one, a finite number, or an infinite number. The claim that there is just one is known as the &quot;smooth&quot; Poincaré conjecture (see &quot;Generalized Poincaré conjecture&quot;). Most mathematicians believe that this conjecture is false, i.e. that &quot;S&quot;4 has more than one smooth type. The problem is connected with the existence of more than one smooth type of the topological 4-disk (or 4-ball).

==Differential structures on topological manifolds==
As mentioned above, in dimensions smaller than 4, there is only one differential structure for each topological manifold. That was proved by Tibor Radó for dimension 1 and 2, and by Edwin E. Moise in dimension 3. By using obstruction theory, Robion Kirby and Laurent C. Siebenmann were able to show that the number of PL structures for compact topological manifolds of dimension greater than 4 is finite. John Milnor, Michel Kervaire, and Morris Hirsch proved that the number of smooth structures on a compact PL manifold is finite and agrees with the number of differential structures on the sphere for the same dimension (see the book Asselmeyer-Maluga, Brans chapter 7) . By combining these results, the number of smooth structures on a compact topological manifold of dimension not equal to 4 is finite. 

Dimension 4 is more complicated. For compact manifolds, results depend on the complexity of the manifold as measured by the second Betti number &quot;b&quot;2. For large Betti numbers &quot;b&quot;2 &gt; 18 in a simply connected 4-manifold, one can use a surgery along a knot or link to produce a new differential structure. With the help of this procedure one can produce countably infinite many differential structures. But even for simple spaces such as formula_14 one doesn&#x27;t know the construction of other differential structures. For non-compact 4-manifolds there are many examples like formula_15 having uncountably many differential structures.

<text>Kenneth Stanley&quot;Bud&quot;Adams Jr. (January 3, 1923 – October 21, 2013) was an American businessman who was the founder and owner of the Houston Oilers of the American Football League (AFL), of which he was also a co-founder. The franchise eventually was moved to Nashville, where it was renamed the Tennessee Titans, a National Football League (NFL) franchise. A member of the Cherokee Nation who originally made his fortune in the petroleum business, Adams was chairman and CEO of Adams Resources &amp; Energy Inc., a wholesale supplier of oil and natural gas. He was instrumental in the founding and establishment of the former American Football League (AFL).

Adams became a charter AFL owner with the establishment of the Oilers (now the &quot;Titans&quot;). He was the senior owner (by duration) with his team, now in the National Football League, a few months ahead of Buffalo Bills&#x27; owner Ralph Wilson. Adams also was one of the owners of the Houston Mavericks of the American Basketball Association (ABA) and the owner of the second Nashville Kats franchise of the Arena Football League (AFL). He was elected to the American Football League Hall of Fame, an online site, but as of 2025 is not a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, despite several nominations and an ongoing effort to make him such.

Adams had many other business interests in the Houston area, including owning several Lincoln-Mercury automobile franchises.

==Early life==
Born in Bartlesville, Oklahoma on January 3, 1923, Adams was the son of K. S. &quot;Boots&quot; Adams and Blanch Keeler Adams. He was an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation by virtue of his maternal line. Two of his great-grandmothers were Cherokee women who married European-American men: Nelson Carr and George B. Keeler, who played roles in trade and oil in early Oklahoma. Keeler drilled the first commercial oil well, near the Caney River.

Adams&#x27;s father succeeded the founder Frank Phillips as president of Phillips Petroleum Company in 1939. Adams&#x27;s uncle William Wayne Keeler, CEO of Phillips Petroleum Company for years, was appointed Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation by U.S. President Harry S. Truman in 1949 and served through 1971, when the Cherokee were allowed to hold their own elections. Keeler was then democratically elected and served until 1975. Adams&#x27;s ancestors include other prominent Cherokee leaders.

Adams graduated from Culver Military Academy in 1940 after lettering in three sports. After a brief stint at Menlo College, he transferred to the University of Kansas (KU), where he played briefly on the varsity football team as he completed an engineering degree. In his lone season on the Jayhawk football team, he was a teammate of politician Bob Dole.

==Sports career in Houston==
===Early career in the American Football League===
Adams soon became interested in owning an NFL team.

===The Houston Oilers and the Astrodome===
Adams and the other AFL owners received a tremendous boost in credibility and net worth in 1966 with the merger of the AFL with and into the NFL. It was effective with the 1970 season. In 1968 Adams moved his team into the Astrodome, which since 1965 had been the home of the Houston Astros of baseball&#x27;s National League (incidentally, Adams was one of the original part-owners of the team for the 1962 season).
====Houston vs. Adams====
By the mid-1990s, several NFL teams had new stadiums built largely or entirely with public funding, and several more deals had been agreed to. These new venues featured amenities such as &quot;club seating&quot; and other potential revenue streams that were not part of the NFL&#x27;s default revenue-sharing arrangements. Due to this, Adams began to lobby Mayor Bob Lanier for a new stadium. However, Lanier turned down the request almost out of hand. Lanier knew that Houstonians were not willing to spend money for a brand-new stadium less than a decade after helping pay for heavily renovating the Astrodome. Following this, Adams began negotiations with the city of Nashville, Tennessee, and after the city approved plans to build what eventually became Nissan Stadium, he announced the Oilers would move to Nashville by 1998. The backlash was swift and immediate in Houston, as fan interest quickly dried up, to the point radio broadcasts would fall from being broadcast statewide to only flagship station KTRH and some stations in Tennessee (and even then, KTRH would drop games midway through in favor of pregame shows for Houston Rockets &quot;preseason&quot; games), and attendance would completely implode to the point on-field discussions between coaches and players could be heard from the stands, with the nadir coming in the final home game on December 15, 1996, a 21–13 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals that saw a disastrous attendance of just 15,131, a total that wouldn&#x27;t even sell out a Rockets game at The Summit. Following this ordeal, the city, unwilling to endure this quagmire for another year, agreed to let Adams out of his lease a season early, and the team was officially gone from Houston.

==Sports career in Tennessee==
===Tennessee Oilers===
The move up of the relocation would prove a blessing and a curse for the vagabond Oilers, as the team now needed a temporary home until the Nashville stadium was completed in 1999. With little options in Tennessee proper to temporarily hold the team (an idea to use Neyland Stadium was quickly mooted as the colossal 104,000 seats would make sellouts near-impossible, and Adams refused to use Vanderbilt Stadium because it lacked both skyboxes and alcohol licenses and seated just over 41,000, not enough to meet NFL stadium standards), Adams thus decided to use Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis for the following 2 seasons. Despite his intentions, the Memphis stay was an utter disaster for the team, as Memphis fans, spurned by previous failed efforts to gain a football team, refused a temporary option, especially for a team that would then leave to their biggest rival city, and Nashville fans balked at having to travel over 200 miles to see &quot;their&quot; team. As such, the team never came close to selling out any home games, barely able to crack 30,000 in the best of times.

Despite the problems, Adams initially intended to stick it out. However, only one game, the finale against the Pittsburgh Steelers, attracted a larger crowd than could have been accommodated at Vanderbilt. Although 50,677 people showed up, the crowd appeared to be composed of at least half, and as many as three-fourths, Steeler fans, leading Adams to begrudingly move the franchise to Vanderbilt Stadium for 1998.

The Oilers had had a proud history in Houston, winning the first two AFL Championships, which were the city&#x27;s first major league titles, and featuring American Football League Hall of Fame enshrinees and all-stars such as George Blanda, Charlie Hennigan, and Billy Cannon. Whatever the reasons, his wrenching of the storied franchise from Houston cost him the disdain not only of Houston supporters, but of AFL fans across the U. S.

Adams fell further from their favor by taking legal action that prevents any Major League Professional Football team from ever using the nickname &quot;Oilers&quot;. The NFL was an accessory to that action, which it interestingly supported, while it allowed the city of Cleveland to keep the nickname of the Cleveland Browns after that franchise was moved to Baltimore. Although Adams was already a member of the American Football League Hall of Fame, his moving of the Oilers and invalidating their nickname caused AFL historian Angelo F. Coniglio to also place him in the &quot;AFL Hall of Infamy&quot;.

===Tennessee Titans===
On November 15, 2009, Adams was caught on video displaying an obscene gesture towards the Buffalo bench after the Titans routed the Bills 41–14. Commissioner Roger Goodell, who happened to be attending the game, fined him $250,000. Afterwards, Adams remarked &quot;Oh, I knew I was going to get in trouble for that. I was just so happy we won.&quot;

==Personal life==
Adams was an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation. He had served on the executive committee of the Cherokee National Historical Society.

He attended River Oaks Baptist Church in Houston. He and his wife Nancy Neville Adams were married for 62 years, until her death in February 2009 at the age of 84. They had two daughters, Susan and Amy, and a son, Kenneth S. Adams III, each of whom (and their children) are registered Cherokee. Kenneth III, who was married and had two children, died in June 1987 at the age of 29 from apparent suicide.

===Death===
Adams died of natural causes at his home in Houston at age 90 in 2013. His body was found in his River Oaks home after police were called for a welfare check.

At the time of his death, Adams&#x27;s 409 wins were the most of any current NFL owner. He gained his 400th career victory in the 2011 season finale when his Titans defeated the team which replaced his Oilers in Houston, the Texans. His franchise made 21 playoff appearances in 53 seasons, eighth among NFL teams since 1960. In championship game appearances, his team reached the AFL Championship four times (1960–1962, 1967) and the AFC Championship Game four times (1978, 1979, 1999, 2002) with just one Super Bowl appearance (1999).

<doc id="725275" wikidata="Q911725" url="?curid=725275" title="Durak">
<text>Durak (; ) is a traditional 
Russian card game that is popular in many post-Soviet states. It is Russia&#x27;s most popular card game, having displaced Preferans. It has since become known in other parts of the world. The objective of the game is to shed all one&#x27;s cards when there are no more cards left in the deck. At the end of the game, the last player with cards in their hand is the &quot;durak&quot; or &#x27;fool&#x27;.

The game is attributed to have appeared in late 18th-century Russian Empire and was popularized by Imperial Army conscripts during the 1812 Russo-French war. Initially a social pastime of uneducated peasants and industrial workers, after the October Revolution Durak has spread to numerous social levels by mid-20th century to soon become the most popular Soviet card game.

== Setup ==
The game is typically played with two to five people, with six players if desired, using a deck of 36 cards, for example a standard 52-card deck from which the numerical cards 2 through 5 have been removed. In theory, the limit for a game with one deck of 36 cards is six players, but this extends a considerable advantage to the player who attacks first, and a considerable disadvantage to the player who defends first. Variants exist that use more than one deck.

The deck is shuffled, and each player is dealt six cards. The bottom card of the stock is turned and placed face up on the table, its suit determining the trump suit for the current deal. For example, if it is the 7 of diamonds, then diamonds rank higher than all plain-suit cards. The rest of the pack is then placed over the turn-up at right angles to it so that it remains visible. These cards form the &quot;prikup&quot; or talon. The turn-up remains part of the talon and is drawn as the last card. Cards discarded due to successful defences are placed in a discard pile next to the talon.

== Playing ==
The player who has the lowest trump card will be the first attacker (note that there is no obligation to play that lowest trump card as the first card). The player to the attacker&#x27;s left is always the defender. After each round of attack play proceeds clockwise. If the attack succeeds (see below), the defender loses their turn and the attack passes to the player on the defender&#x27;s left. If the attack fails, the defender becomes the next attacker.

=== First attack ===
Cards are ranked (ascending order, ace high). A trump card of any rank beats all cards in the other three suits. For example, a 6 of trumps beats an ace of any other suit.

The attacker opens their turn by playing a card face up on the table as an attacking card. The player to the attacker&#x27;s left is the defender. They respond to the attack with a defending card.

=== Defending ===
The defender attempts to beat the attack card by playing a higher-ranking defending card from their hand. For example, if the attacker plays a the defender must play a higher spade such as the or a card from the trump suit to defend successfully. The defender must play a higher card of the same suit as the attack card or play a card of the trump suit (there is no obligation to play the card of the same suit; you can use trump cards to beat off the attack anytime). The defending cards are placed on top of the attack card overlapping it, so both cards are visible and it is clear which cards are attacking and defending cards.

After the first attack, if the defender is successful, the attacker may launch a new attack. If they cannot or if they pass, then the player to the left of the defender may start a new attack or pass the chance to attack to the next non-defender going clockwise around the table. For each new attack which is defended successfully by the defender, the player who led that attack (played the last attack card) may start a new attack. After the original attack, attacks can only be made if the new attack card matches the rank of any card which has already been played during that round. If the player who led the last attack chooses not to attack again (and all future attacks during the round of attacks) then the original attacker may make a new attack, if they pass on making an attack then players to the defenders left may attack or pass and so on going clockwise around the table. There cannot be more than six attacks in each round. Each new attack card is placed to the left of the last attack card and the defender plays their defending card on top of the new attack card creating a row of attack and defence cards. The defender must respond to the new attack in the same fashion as the first attack by playing a card of the same suit of the new attack card with a higher rank or a trump card. All other players may make a new attack if the defender has successfully defended the last attack. The original attacker has priority for making an attack, then the player to defender&#x27;s left has priority and so forth going clockwise. Some variants only allow cards to be added to the attack once the first defending card has been played.

At any point during a round of attacks, if a defender is unwilling or unable to beat the most recent attack card, they may give up their defence and must pick up all the cards played during that round of attack (both defending and attacking). At this point, the other players may choose to shed cards matching ranks of any cards that have already been played during this round, with priority going to the last attacker and continuing clockwise to each non-defender, up to a maximum of 6 attacking cards, which the defender must also pick up. In this case the round of attacks ends and the player to the defender&#x27;s left starts a new round of attacks.

If, however, the defender has beaten all attacking cards and no other players are willing to make another attack or if the defender beats the sixth attack card, the defender has won the round of attacks. In this case all cards from that round of attack are placed in the discard pile and the defender starts a new round of attacks as the attacker and the player to his or her left becomes the new defender.

No players may examine the discard pile at any point.

=== End of turn ===
At the end of each round of attacks against a defender, whether or not the defence was successful, each player draws new cards from the deck until they have six cards in their hand unless the deck has been exhausted. The main attacker draws as many cards as necessary first, followed by any other attackers in clockwise order, and finally the defender. The defender&#x27;s final card must beat the last attack card, otherwise they must pick up all the cards played during that round of attacks. If the talon is exhausted, and a player has played all their cards, they are eliminated from the game.

=== Winning and losing ===
The last person left with cards in their hand is the loser (the fool or &quot;durak&quot;). In some variants, this player becomes the dealer for the next round. The player to the fool&#x27;s right may become the first attacker for the next round.

Some variants declare the winner of the round to be the first player to empty their hand and leave the game. In others, there are no winners, only the loser.

=== Team play ===
Four players can play as two pairs. Six can play as three teams of two, or two teams of three. The members of each team sit opposite one another (with two players on each team), or alternating (with three). In some variants, the team with the lowest trump starts the first round, but in subsequent rounds the winning team from the previous round begins.

When playing in teams, players may not add to attacks on their teammates.

=== Fool with epaulettes ===
If the last card played by an attacker is a six, and the defender loses, the defender is cheerfully pronounced &quot;durak s galstukom&quot; (), and the six card may be symbolically placed on their chest. This is worse than declaring the loser simply as a &quot;durak&quot;, because of the handicap of having a low-value Six through the final part of the game. If the attacker plays two sixes, the loser is even called a &quot;durak&quot; with &quot;epaulettes on both shoulders&quot; in Russian &quot;durak s pogonami&quot;. 

Some variants use the ties as scoring points. If someone has a six as a tie, the opponents must next score against them using a seven, and so on until someone receives an ace as a tie. To score, the winning individual or team must not only end with the correct tie value, but must include at least one non-trump card in the final attack. As it goes with two sixes either. That being said, not all variants use the &quot;fool with epaulette&quot; rule, some simply ignore the defender who lost to a six and simply call them the &quot;durak&quot;.

==Variants ==

In a common variation called &quot;&quot; (&quot;transferrable&quot; or &quot;reversible&quot;) durak, a defender may pass to the next player if they have a card of the same rank. The defender adds this card to the pile and the next player becomes the defender. The defender now becomes the new attacker, and the player to their left becomes the new defender and must beat all cards played by the attacker. Passing is not allowed if the new defender has fewer cards in their hand than would be in the passed attack. In games involving four or fewer players, it is possible for the attack to pass all the way around the table, so that the original attacker ends up defending against their own attack.

One variation of passing called &#x27; (&quot;drive-by&quot;) or &#x27; (&quot;showing&quot;) allows a defender who holds the trump of the same rank to simply show the card to pass the attack on and become the new attacker. The holder of the trump card of the same rank may play it at any time during the attack. If playing with fewer than 4 players, it is possible for the attack to be passed all the way around and come back to the holder of the trump card again. In this case the holder cannot show or play the same card again in order to pass the attack a second time.

<text>Fernhill Cemetery, known as the Rural Cemetery when it opened in 1848, is located at 200 Westmorland Road in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. Renamed Fernhill in 1899, the 125 acre (0.5 km2) cemetery has a special section for veterans of both World War I and World War II and is the burial site of one of only a few Canadians to ever receive the United States&#x27; highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor.

When the cemetery opened, the Church of England was the established church, and as such, there is a designated area for Church of England members. In the cemetery&#x27;s Jewishsection, a stone chapel was built in 1950 with the help of the Hollywood mogul Louis B. Mayer, who grew up in Saint John and whose mother is interred here.

The cemetery contains the war graves of 103 Commonwealth service personnel, 67 of World War I and 36 of World War II.

Fernhill has operated a crematorium onsite since 1939, when it was the first crematorium east of Montreal.

<text>Camp Hill Cemetery is a cemetery within Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is located on Camp Hill, adjacent to Robie Street.

==History==
The city&#x27;s first cemetery, the Old Burying Ground was established in 1749, growing for nearly a century until Camp Hill succeeded it in 1844. Originally run by a private company, the cemetery is now owned and administered by the Halifax Regional Municipality.

As a cemetery in the provincial capital, Camp Hill became the final resting place for many of Nova Scotia&#x27;s elite. Officials allowed for the burial of Black Canadians in a segregated section of the cemetery. Initially, the resting places of African-Canadian veterans of World War I, unlike other white Canadian veterans, were marked with only flat white stones. This situation has been rectified by the federal department of Veterans Affairs.

The Commonwealth War Graves Commission maintains the war graves of 10 service personnel of World War I and over 80 of World War II.

There are also 17 graves of Norwegian sailors, soldiers and merchant seamen in Camp Hill Cemetery who died in Nova Scotia during World War II. These men were at sea when Germany invaded Norway in 1940. The King and government of Norway ordered the more than 1,000 ships at sea to go to Allied ports.

For many years the cemetery contained a traffic light. The traffic light for the intersection of Robie Street and Jubilee Road was located in the northwest corner of the cemetery, creating a popular boast that Halifax was the only city in the world with a traffic light in a cemetery. However, in 2008 the traffic light was moved outside the cemetery fence.

<text>Answer That and Stay Fashionable is the debut studio album by American punk rock band AFI. It was released on July 4, 1995, through Wingnut Records and rereleased on April 22, 1997, through Nitro Records.

==Background==
&quot;Answer That and Stay Fashionable&quot; was recorded in Hayward, California, at Art of Ears, the studio of Andy Ernst, in 1995. The album was produced by AFI, along with Doug Sangalang, Tim Armstrong and Brett Reed. It was recorded in under a week.

All of the tracks except &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; are copyrighted to Anthems for Insubordinates.

The album originally included a hidden track, a cover of The Police&#x27;s &quot;Man in a Suitcase&quot;, which is absent on the rerelease. In its place is a cover of The Circus Tents&#x27; &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;, originally released with an alternate mix on the &quot;Fly in the Ointment&quot; EP in 1995.

Many audio samples are included throughout the album, such as a clip from &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992), whose theatrical release poster the cover artwork parodies. Also featured is a clip from &quot;The Comic Strip&quot; episode &quot;Bad News Tour&quot;, from which the album derives its name, and &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s European Vacation&quot; (1985).

The tracks &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; and &quot;Yürf Rendenmein&quot; were later re-recorded for AFI&#x27;s second album &quot;Very Proud of Ya&quot;.

<text>A gag character is usually a character that is rarely used, and typically exhibits little or no personality except to serve as the conduit for a joke in comic strips and TV shows. 

==Narrative function==
Gag characters usually appear in single panel cartoons that do not follow any main or centralized character (although they might follow similar types of jokes). Some examples include The Far Side, Bizarro, and Speed Bump. Because of this, gag characters are not given a broad depth of characterization, as to complement the lack of narrative continuity present in their format.

Gag characters also appear on television. However, a gag character on a syndicated or serialized show usually makes one appearance during the series&#x27; run. Any subsequent appearances make the character into a secondary character within the work.

Often, a gag character&#x27;s usage is centered around humor rooted in the character&#x27;s behavior or appearance. However, there are cases where a gag character may also be the main characters of a particular narrative or even series. In such cases, the narrative frequently utilizes one or more recurring jokes throughout the series unique to that main character. Examples include Arale Norimaki from the manga Dr. Slump, or Marvel Comics&#x27; Squirrel Girl, among other examples. Due to being protagonists of their own respective show, such characters tend to be given more characterization and be put in a variety of scenarios, typically in parallel or in contrast to potentially much more serious characters.

<text>Christie Marie Blatchford (May 20, 1951 – February 12, 2020) was a Canadian newspaper columnist, journalist and broadcaster. She published four non-fiction books.

Blatchford was Canada&#x27;s first female sports columnist, reporting on sports between 1975 and 1977. In her 48-year career she worked for all four Toronto-based newspapers, winning the 1999 National Newspaper Award for column writing. She was inducted into the Canadian News Hall of Fame in 2019. Her book &quot;Fifteen Days: Stories of Bravery, Friendship, Life and Death from Inside the New Canadian Army&quot; also won the 2008 Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award in Non-fiction.

==Early years and family==
Blatchford was born in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, the daughter of Kathleen and Ross Blatchford. Her father, who was in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II, managed a hockey arena in Noranda. When Blatchford was in grade 11, the family moved to Toronto when her father became manager of the North Toronto Memorial Arena. She attended North Toronto Collegiate Institute, graduating in 1970. She then studied journalism at Ryerson University, and worked for the student paper &quot;The Ryersonian&quot;. Her nephew is sports reporter Andy Blatchford.

Blatchford had a number of journalists in her family. Her grandfather, Andy Lytle was a sports writer and editor for the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; in the 1920s and again in the 1950s and a sports editor at the &quot;Toronto Daily Star&quot; in the 1930s and 1940s. Her uncle, Tommy Lytle, was a &quot;Toronto Star&quot; editor until his retirement in 1974.

==Career==

Blatchford began working part-time for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; in 1972, while still studying journalism at Ryerson, where she graduated at the top of her class. She was hired full-time by the &quot;Globe&quot; in 1973, working as a general assignment reporter and then as a sports columnist at the paper from 1975 until 1977; she was billed as Canada&#x27;s first female sports columnist and was at the time one of only six female sports reporters in North America. Blatchford&#x27;s first column &quot;focused on Bobby Hull’s refusal to play in a World Hockey Association game&quot;. In it, she said: &quot;It&#x27;s the only game in the world we play as good as anyone else. But if we aren&#x27;t careful, the people who make the decisions are going to take the guts and hardness out of hockey and they will do it because they think it is what we want.&quot;

Displeased when a &quot;Globe&quot; column was edited against her wishes, Blatchford then abruptly jumped to the competing &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, where she worked as a feature writer from 1977 to 1982, and began covering criminal trials in 1978, a beat she would return to throughout her career.

Looking to transition from a news reporter to a columnist, Blatchford proposed a light humour column to the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; in 1982, chronicling her new relationship with a younger boyfriend, as well as her interactions with other friends and family. The &quot;Sun&quot; agreed to the proposal, although at a pay cut from her rate at the Star. Her column was originally in the paper&#x27;s lifestyle section but moved to the high-profile page 5 feature column space previously occupied by Paul Rimstead, following his death in 1987. Blatchford remained at the &quot;Sun&quot; for 16 years, eventually transitioning back into news reporting and harder news features, by the late 1990s, notably covering high-profile trials such as those of Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka.

In 1998, Blatchford moved to the newly launched &quot;National Post&quot;. In 1999, she received the National Newspaper Award for column writing. She left the &quot;Post&quot; to return to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; in 2003, working as a columnist there for eight years.

During four trips to Afghanistan in 2006–07, Blatchford reported on the experiences of Canadian soldiers. Based on these experiences, she wrote the book &quot;Fifteen Days: Stories of Bravery, Friendship, Life and Death from Inside the New Canadian Army&quot;. The book went on to garner the 2008 Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award in Non-fiction.

Blatchford returned once again to the &quot;National Post&quot; in 2011 and would remain there for the rest of her career. She was also a frequent panelist, commentator, contributor and guest on CFRB radio for several decades.

Blatchford&#x27;s book &quot;Helpless: Caledonia&#x27;s Nightmare of Fear and Anarchy, and How the Law Failed All of Us&quot;, concerning the Grand River land dispute, led to some controversy, including several members of the student body of the University of Waterloo protesting her speaking engagement and leading to its being cancelled on grounds of security.

In an article in the &quot;National Post&quot; online on August 22, 2011, Blatchford criticized the outpouring of support resulting from the death of federal NDP Leader and the Parliament of Canada&#x27;s Leader of the Opposition Jack Layton, calling it &quot;a public spectacle&quot;, and referring to Layton&#x27;s &quot;canonization&quot;. This caused an outcry toward Blatchford herself. Blatchford&#x27;s commentary on the 2013 suicide of Rehtaeh Parsons also led to Parsons&#x27; father accusing Blatchford of victim blaming.

In June 2018, Blatchford said of a press subsidy: &quot;God forbid Ottawa should start to subsidize newspapers too. As a journalist, the thought gives me the shudders.&quot;

==Illness and death==
After having to cut short her assignment covering the 2019 federal election campaign due to nagging muscle pain, Blatchford was diagnosed in November 2019 with lung cancer which was found to have metastasized to bones in the spine and hip by the time it was detected. Blatchford was inducted into the Canadian News Hall of Fame the same month, but was unable to attend the ceremony.

Blatchford took leave from writing her column and sought treatment at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, where she underwent several months of surgeries, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. She died in Toronto on February 12, 2020.

<doc id="725323" wikidata="Q7959109" url="?curid=725323" title="Wade Rathke">
<text>Stephen Wade Rathke (born 1948) is a community and labor activist who founded the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) in 1970 and Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 100 in 1980 (now United Labor Unions Local 100). He was ACORN&#x27;s chief organizer from its founding in 1970 until June 2, 2008, and continues to be chief organizer of ACORN International and United Labor Unions Local 100. He is the publisher and editor-in-chief of &quot;Social Policy,&quot; a quarterly magazine for scholars and activists. The magazine&#x27;s publishing arm has published four of his books. He is also a radio station manager of KABF (Little Rock) and WAMF (New Orleans).

==Early life and education==
Rathke was born in Laramie, Wyoming, to Edmann J. Rathke and Cornelia Ratliff Rathke. He and his younger brother Dale were raised in Colorado and New Orleans, Louisiana, where they attended local schools and graduated from Benjamin Franklin High School.

Rathke attended Williams College, a private liberal arts college in Williamstown, Massachusetts, from 1966 to 1971. While there, Wade organized draft resistance for Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and later organized welfare recipients in Springfield and Boston, Massachusetts for the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO).

==ACORN==
===Founding===
Rathke began his career as an organizer for the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO) in Springfield, Massachusetts. After working with the NWRO, he left for Little Rock, Arkansas to found a new organization designed to unite poor and working-class families around a common agenda. As founder and chief organizer of ACORN, Rathke first hired Gary Delgado, among many notable community and labor organizers over the years. They developed a replicable model of &quot;forming membership organizations and developing leaders in low-income neighborhoods -- relying substantially on young middle-class staff working for subsistence wages.&quot;

This community organizing initiative in Arkansas eventually developed as the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), the largest organization of lower income and working families in the United States, with almost 500,000 dues-paying families spread across about one-hundred staffed offices in American cities. The Institute for Social Justice has been developed to serve as ACORN&#x27;s training arm.

===Departure===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on July 9, 2008, that Dale Rathke, the brother of ACORN&#x27;s founder Wade Rathke, was found to have embezzled $948,607.50 from the group and affiliated charitable organizations in 1999 and 2000. Wade learned of the problem when an employee of Citizens Consulting, the accounting firm for ACORN, told him an investigation uncovered inappropriate charges that led to his brother. &quot;Clearly, this was an uncomfortable, conflicting and humiliating situation as far as my family and I were concerned,&quot; Wade said, &quot;and so the real decisions on how to handle it had to be made by others.&quot; ACORN executives decided to handle it as an internal matter, and did not inform some of the board members, staff or law enforcement. They signed an enforceable restitution agreement with the Rathke family to repay the amount of the embezzlement. After the Rathke family had repaid $210,000, in $30,000 installments, a friend of Wade Rathke, Drummond Pike, purchased the promissory note thereby repaying the remaining debt for Dale Rathke. According to the &quot;Times&quot;, Wade Rathke &quot;said the decision to keep the matter secret was not made to protect his brother but because word of the embezzlement would have put a &#x27;weapon&#x27; into the hands of enemies of Acorn, a liberal group that is a frequent target of conservatives who object to ACORN&#x27;s often strident advocacy on behalf of low- and moderate-income families and workers.&quot; A whistleblower revealed the embezzlement in 2008. On June 2, 2008, Dale Rathke was dismissed, and Wade resigned that same day as ACORN&#x27;s chief organizer. He continues as chief organizer for ACORN International, Inc.

==SEIU Local 100==
Rathke is also founder and Chief Organizer of Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 100, which is headquartered in New Orleans and also has chapters in Texas and Arkansas. Founded in 1980 in New Orleans as an independent union of Hyatt employees, the union became part of SEIU in 1984. SEIU Local 100 organizes public sector public workers, including school employees, Head Start, and health care workers, as well as lower-wage private sector workers in the hospitality, janitorial, and other service industries.

Rathke&#x27;s work in the labor movement includes three terms as Secretary-Treasurer of the Greater New Orleans AFL-CIO. Rathke was the president and co-founder of the SEIU Southern Conference; a member of the International Executive Board of SEIU (1996–2004); and Chief Organizer of the Hotel and Restaurant Organizing Committee (HOTROC) a multi-union organizing project for hospitality workers in New Orleans sponsored by the AFL-CIO and its president, John Sweeney, and from 2004–2008 chief organizer of a multi-pronged effort to organize Walmart workers, including the Walmart workers in Florida and California. In 2009, Local 100 left SEIU and once again became United Labor Unions Local 100.

Rathke and Local 100 were most prominently in the news in the fall of 2017 when they filed charges with the NLRB to prevent Dallas Cowboys’ owner and general manager, Jerry Jones, from threatening his players if they refused to stand for the national anthem. The union withdrew its charge after the NFL said it would not discipline players and Jones.

==Other projects==
In 2000, Rathke created the Organizers&#x27; Forum, which brings together senior organizers in labor and community organizations in dialogues about challenges faced by constituency-based organizations, such as tactical development, organizing new immigrants, using technology, using capital strategies and corporate campaign techniques, or understanding the effects and organizing challenges of globalization. 

==Radio==
Since 2013, Rathke has returned to the 100,000-watt radio station KABF-FM 88.3 as its station manager.

== Documentary ==
In 2017, the documentary film about Rathke titled &quot;The Organizer&quot; was released. It was directed by Nick Taylor and distributed by Grasshopper Film.

<text>The West Branch Susquehanna River is one of the two principal branches, along with the North Branch, of the Susquehanna River in the Northeastern United States. The North Branch, which rises in upstate New York, is generally regarded as the extension of the main branch, with the shorter West Branch being its principal tributary.

The West Branch, which is long, is entirely within the state of Pennsylvania, draining a large mountainous area within the Allegheny Plateau in the western part of the state. Along most of its course it meanders past mountain ridges and through water gaps, forming a large zigzag arc through central Pennsylvania around the north end of the Allegheny Mountains. In colonial times, the river valley provided an important route to the Ohio River valley. In the 19th century, its lower valley became a significant industrial heartland of Pennsylvania. In the 20th century, the upper reaches of the West Branch turned a yellow/orange color due to sulfurous drainage from nearby and abandoned deep bituminous coal mines.

==Course==
The West Branch rises on the west side of the Alleghenies in northwestern Cambria County, just outside the borough of Carrolltown. It flows generally north, crossing the eastern corner of Indiana County at Cherry Tree, then into southern Clearfield County. Near Mahaffey it turns generally northeast and flows past Curwensville and Clearfield. In northern Clinton County it turns to the southeast to Lock Haven. At Lock Haven, it turns east, flowing through the West Branch Susquehanna Valley along the foot of Bald Eagle Mountain ridge past Williamsport, the largest city on the river, then turns south at the end of the ridge. From there it winds around Muncy, emerging from a water gap between Montour Ridge and Shamokin Mountain and joining the north (main) branch of the Susquehanna from the northwest approximately north of Sunbury.

===Tributaries===
From its upper reaches to its lower reaches, it receives:
*Chest Creek from the south at Mahaffey
*Anderson Creek from the west in Curwensville
*Clearfield Creek from the south east of Clearfield
*Moshannon Creek from the south south of Karthaus
*Sinnemahoning Creek from the northwest at Keating
*Fish Dam Run from the south southwest of Renovo, Pennsylvania
*Bald Eagle Creek from the southwest at Lock Haven
*Pine Creek and Larrys Creek from the north near Jersey Shore
*Lycoming Creek from the north at Williamsport
*Loyalsock Creek from the northeast at Montoursville
*Muncy Creek from the northeast at Muncy
*White Deer Hole Creek from the south at Allenwood.
*White Deer Creek from the west at White Deer next to the Watsontown River Bridge.
*Buffalo Creek from the west at Lewisburg.
*Chillisquaque Creek from the northeast at West Chillisquaque Township 5.01 miles (8.06 km) upriver of its mouth.

==History==

Up through the early 19th century the river provided the principal canoe route across the Alleghenies connecting the Susquehanna and Ohio valleys, with a portage at Cherry Tree to Blacklick Creek, a tributary of the Conemaugh River. In the late 18th century, Cherry Tree marked the frontier between the Pennsylvania Colony and the Shawnee and Lenape lands to the west as specified by treaty.

The lands along the West Branch were vital hunting grounds and agricultural lands for Native Americans. During Pennsylvania&#x27;s great lumbering era, the most significant log drive was conveyed on the West Branch of the Susquehanna River. The Susquehanna&#x27;s West Branch Canal Division further shaped the corridor, linking towns and villages and providing vital opportunities for commerce. Finally, railroads in the corridor fused the links between communities and commerce within the corridor.

===Early inhabitants===
The first recorded inhabitants of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannocks. Their name meant &quot;people of the muddy river&quot;, from the Lenape name of the Susquehanna River, &quot;Siskuwihane&quot; (&quot;sisku&quot; &quot;mud&quot;, &quot;hane&quot; &quot;river&quot;). Decimated by diseases and warfare, they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes by the early 18th century. The lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley were then chiefly occupied by the Munsee phratry of the Lenape (or Delaware) people and were under the nominal control of the Five (later Six) Nations of the Iroquois.

===Colonial settlement===
Madame Montour&#x27;s village of Otstonwakin or Ostuagy was a vitally important location during the settlement of what is now Lycoming County. Her village at the mouth of Loyalsock Creek on the West Branch Susquehanna River was an important stopping point for the Moravian missionaries who were spreading the gospel throughout the wilderness of Pennsylvania during the 1740s. Count Zinzendorf, a missionary being guided by Conrad Weiser with the permission of Shikellamy, came to Ostuagy in 1742.

The British purchased land from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768, opening what is now Lycoming County to settlement. However, the Line of Property (or Purchase Line) border defined by &quot;Tiadaghton Creek&quot; dividing colonial and Native American lands was disputed. The colonists claimed this was Pine Creek, the Iroquois and other tribes Lycoming Creek. The area between Pine and Lycoming creeks was disputed territory. The illegal settlers there were part of the &quot;Fair Play Men&quot; system of self-government, with their own Declaration of Independence from Britain on July 4, 1776.

In the American Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the &quot;Big Runaway&quot; occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to Muncy, then further south to Sunbury. The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the &quot;Little Runaway&quot;. The Sullivan Expedition helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war. In 1790, Timothy Matlack, Samuel Maclay and John Adlum were commissioned by the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to survey the headwaters of the Susquehanna and explore a route for a passageway to connect the West Branch with the waters of the Allegheny River.

The Fair Play Men were illegal settlers (squatters) who established their own system of self-rule from 1773 to 1785 in the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley of Pennsylvania. Because they settled in territory claimed by Native Americans, they had no recourse to the Pennsylvania colonial government. Accordingly, they established what was known as the Fair Play System, with three elected commissioners who ruled on land claims and other issues for the group. In a remarkable coincidence, the Fair Play Men made their own declaration of independence from Britain on July 4, 1776, beneath the &quot;Tiadaghton Elm&quot; on the banks of Pine Creek.

Fort Antes was a stockade surrounding the home of Colonel John Henry Antes, built &quot;circa&quot; 1778 in Revolutionary Pennsylvania in the United States. The fort was built under the direction of Colonel Antes, who was a member of the Pennsylvania militia. It was on the east side of Antes Creek, overlooking and on the left bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River on a plateau in Nippenose Township south of modern-day Jersey Shore in western Lycoming County. The local militia held the fort for a short period of time until it was ordered by Colonel Samuel Hunter to abandon Fort Antes during the Big Runaway. Despite being abandoned and attempts by the attacking British forces to burn it down, Fort Antes was one of only two structures in the valley to survive the Big Runaway.

===Log boom===
The Susquehanna Boom was a system of cribs in the West Branch Susquehanna River designed to hold timber in the river until it could be processed at one of the nearly 60 sawmills along the river between Lycoming and Loyalsock creeks in Lycoming County. The boom was constructed in 1846 under the supervision of James H. Perkins.

A boom is a chain or line of connected floating timbers extended across a river, lake, or harbor, so as to obstruct passage or catch floating objects. The Susquehanna Boom extended upstream from Duboistown to the village of Linden in Woodward Township. The boom was constructed by creating a series of man-made islands known as &quot;cribs&quot;. These cribs built of local mountain stone and sunken timber were stretched diagonally across the river, beginning on the south side near Duboistown and ending on the north side near Linden. The boom was made of 352 separate cribs that were high. The boom was opened and closed at the upper end by a device known as a &quot;sheer boom&quot;. It was long and was controlled with a hand-powered windlass. The sheer boom gathered the logs into the main boom that was capable of holding up to 300 million board feet (700,000 m3) of logs. The lower end of the boom was where the logs were sorted. The mills in Williamsport, South Williamsport, and Duboistown each had their own distinctive brand burnt into the logs. The men working at the end of the boom would sort the logs according to their corresponding brand and float them into the correct holding pond along the bank of the river.

During the height of the lumber industry in Lycoming County, 1861–1891, the various mills produced 5.5 billion board feet (13 million m3) of lumber. Williamsport became one of the most prosperous cities in Pennsylvania and in the United States. Men like James H. Perkins, Peter Herdic, and Mahlon Fisher became millionaires while many of the men who actually worked in the river struggled to survive on the wages paid to them by the lumber barons.

<text>Bellefontaine Cemetery is a nonprofit, non-denominational cemetery and arboretum in St. Louis, Missouri. Founded in 1849 as a rural cemetery, Bellefontaine has several architecturally significant monuments and mausoleums such as the Louis Sullivan-designed Wainwright Tomb, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The cemetery contains of land and over 87,000 graves, including those of William Clark, Adolphus Busch, Thomas Hart Benton, Rush Limbaugh, and William S. Burroughs. It has many Union and Confederate soldiers from the American Civil War, and local and state politicians. It has the largest collection of private and family mausoleums and sarcophagi in Missouri.

==Overview==
The cemetery contains the graves of many prominent American pioneers, businesspeople, politicians, and generals who are significant figures in the history of St. Louis and the United States. Its oldest graves are from 1816, located on pioneer Edward Hempstead&#x27;s family lot. Many of the wealthiest families at Bellefontaine have ornate mausoleums which overlook the Mississippi River and have Classical, Romanesque, Gothic, and Egyptian architectural styles. Mausoleums include the Wainwright Tomb, designed for Charlotte Dickson Wainwright by the famed Chicago school architect Louis Sullivan in 1892; the Busch Mausoleum, designed for Adolphus Busch and Lilly Anheuser by Barnett, Haynes &amp; Barnett in 1915; and the Brown Brothers Mausoleums, designed in 1910 by Isaac Taylor and in 1928 by Mauran, Russell and Crowell. Many of the several large family plots are marked by tall obelisk monuments with elaborate bases. Guided tours of the cemetery&#x27;s main historical and architectural highlights are open to the public. Visitors can also obtain self-guided tour brochures at the cemetery office.

==History==
===19th century===
On March 7, 1849, banker William McPherson and lawyer John Fletcher Darby assembled a group of some of St. Louis&#x27;s most prominent citizens to found the Rural Cemetery Association of St. Louis. This association sought to respond to the needs of the rapidly growing city by establishing a new cemetery several miles outside city limits. St. Louis was experiencing huge population growth during this time and city leaders thought that the existing graveyards, which were mostly concentrated along Jefferson Avenue near the city center, were an impediment to urban development. Many were also convinced that city cemeteries represented a public health hazard, as with miasma theory. These problems were compounded during mid-1849, when a cholera pandemic killed more than 4,000 people in the city. With existing cemeteries running out of space, and with many residents fearing that fumes from nearby cemeteries could cause them to fall ill, the drive to create a new cemetery gained pace.

In 1849, the Rural Cemetery Association purchased the former Hempstead family farm five miles northwest of the city, with the intent to turn it into a large rural cemetery, modeled after Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris and Mount Auburn Cemetery in Massachusetts. The association initially called it Rural Cemetery, but because the Hempstead farm was along the road to Fort Belle Fontaine, ultimately named it after the fort.

Within a few months, the Association had hired landscape architect Almerin Hotchkiss, who helped design Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, to begin drafting and implementing a master plan for Bellefontaine. Hotchkiss became superintendent of the cemetery for the next 46 years, designed most of Bellefontaine&#x27;s roadways and landscaping, and oversaw maintenance of the grounds. 

The first burial at Bellefontaine Cemetery was on April 27, 1850, and the official dedication was several weeks later. Older graves within St. Louis were reinterred to Bellefontaine, including some from the cemetery by the Old Cathedral near the Mississippi River. Bellefontaine had graves of several victims of the 1855 Gasconade Bridge train disaster, the worst railroad disaster in Missouri history. Several brewing families are interred, including the Anheusers, Buschs, Lemps, and Griesediecks.

The cemetery steadily acquired more land for growth and, by 1865, had reached its permanent size of .

===20th century===
In 1909, the St. Louis architectural firm Eames and Young was commissioned to design a new chapel.

===21st century===
The Hotchkiss Chapel, named for the cemetery&#x27;s first architect, was renovated in 2009, and an indoor columbarium was added on the back. The chapel is used for weddings and memorial services. A new lakeside garden and columbarium were completed in 2010. Two new outdoor columbaria have opened for inurnments, and a green burial natural interment section is planned. With more than of open, unused land, the cemetery has room for traditional casketed and vaulted ground burial for 200 years at current rates of usage. Some of this extra land has been converted into prairie and woodland.

As of 2012, Bellefontaine Cemetery contained more than 87,000 graves, with about 100 added each year. It contains over of paved roads and has more than 180 species of trees and shrubs in an accredited arboretum.

The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.

<doc id="725331" wikidata="Q4944923" url="?curid=725331" title="Borel–Weil–Bott theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Borel–Weil–Bott theorem is a basic result in the representation theory of Lie groups, showing how a family of representations can be obtained from holomorphic sections of certain complex vector bundles, and, more generally, from higher sheaf cohomology groups associated to such bundles. It is built on the earlier Borel–Weil theorem of Armand Borel and André Weil, dealing just with the space of sections (the zeroth cohomology group), the extension to higher cohomology groups being provided by Raoul Bott. One can equivalently, through Serre&#x27;s GAGA, view this as a result in complex algebraic geometry in the Zariski topology.

==Formulation==
Let be a semisimple Lie group or algebraic group over formula_1, and fix a maximal torus along with a Borel subgroup which contains . Let be an integral weight of ; defines in a natural way a one-dimensional representation of , by pulling back the representation on , where is the unipotent radical of . Since we can think of the projection map as a principal -bundle, for each we get an associated fiber bundle on (note the sign), which is obviously a line bundle. Identifying with its sheaf of holomorphic sections, we consider the sheaf cohomology groups formula_2. Since acts on the total space of the bundle formula_3 by bundle automorphisms, this action naturally gives a -module structure on these groups; and the Borel–Weil–Bott theorem gives an explicit description of these groups as -modules.

We first need to describe the Weyl group action centered at formula_4. For any integral weight and in the Weyl group , we set formula_5, where denotes the half-sum of positive roots of . It is straightforward to check that this defines a group action, although this action is &quot;not&quot; linear, unlike the usual Weyl group action. Also, a weight is said to be &quot;dominant&quot; if formula_6 for all simple roots . Let denote the length function on .

Given an integral weight , one of two cases occur:
# There is no formula_7 such that formula_8 is dominant, equivalently, there exists a nonidentity formula_7 such that formula_10; or
# There is a &quot;unique&quot; formula_7 such that formula_12 is dominant.
The theorem states that in the first case, we have

:formula_13 for all ;

and in the second case, we have

:formula_13 for all formula_15, while

:formula_16 is the dual of the irreducible highest-weight representation of with highest weight formula_17.

Case (1) above occurs if and only if formula_18 for some positive root . Also, we obtain the classical Borel–Weil theorem as a special case of this theorem by taking to be dominant and to be the identity element formula_19.

==Example==
For example, consider , for which is the Riemann sphere, an integral weight is specified simply by an integer , and . The line bundle is formula_20, whose sections are the homogeneous polynomials of degree (i.e. the &quot;binary forms&quot;). As a representation of , the sections can be written as , and is canonically isomorphic to . 

This gives us at a stroke the representation theory of formula_21: formula_22 is the standard representation, and formula_23 is its th symmetric power. We even have a unified description of the action of the Lie algebra, derived from its realization as vector fields on the Riemann sphere: if , , are the standard generators of formula_21, then 

: formula_25

==Positive characteristic==
One also has a weaker form of this theorem in positive characteristic. Namely, let be a semisimple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic formula_26. Then it remains true that formula_13 for all if is a weight such that formula_8 is non-dominant for all formula_7 as long as is &quot;close to zero&quot;. This is known as the Kempf vanishing theorem. However, the other statements of the theorem do not remain valid in this setting.

More explicitly, let be a dominant integral weight; then it is still true that formula_13 for all formula_31, but it is no longer true that this -module is simple in general, although it does contain the unique highest weight module of highest weight as a -submodule. If is an arbitrary integral weight, it is in fact a large unsolved problem in representation theory to describe the cohomology modules formula_2 in general. Unlike over formula_33, Mumford gave an example showing that it need not be the case for a fixed that these modules are all zero except in a single degree .

==Borel–Weil theorem==
The Borel–Weil theorem provides a concrete model for irreducible representations of compact Lie groups and irreducible holomorphic representations of complex semisimple Lie groups. These representations are realized in the spaces of global sections of holomorphic line bundles on the flag manifold of the group. The Borel–Weil–Bott theorem is its generalization to higher cohomology spaces. The theorem dates back to the early 1950s and can be found in and .

=== Statement of the theorem ===
The theorem can be stated either for a complex semisimple Lie group or for its compact form . Let be a connected complex semisimple Lie group, a Borel subgroup of , and the flag variety. In this scenario, is a complex manifold and a nonsingular algebraic . The flag variety can also be described as a compact homogeneous space , where is a (compact) Cartan subgroup of . An integral weight determines a holomorphic line bundle on and the group acts on its space of global sections,

:formula_34

The Borel–Weil theorem states that if is a &quot;dominant&quot; integral weight then this representation is a &quot;holomorphic&quot; irreducible highest weight representation of with highest weight . Its restriction to is an irreducible unitary representation of with highest weight , and each irreducible unitary representation of is obtained in this way for a unique value of . (A holomorphic representation of a complex Lie group is one for which the corresponding Lie algebra representation is &quot;complex&quot; linear.)

=== Concrete description ===
The weight gives rise to a character (one-dimensional representation) of the Borel subgroup , which is denoted . Holomorphic sections of the holomorphic line bundle over may be described more concretely as holomorphic maps

:formula_35

for all and .

The action of on these sections is given by 
: formula_36

for .

=== Example ===
Let be the complex special linear group , with a Borel subgroup consisting of upper triangular matrices with determinant one. Integral weights for may be identified with integers, with dominant weights corresponding to nonnegative integers, and the corresponding characters of have the form

: formula_37

The flag variety may be identified with the complex projective line with homogeneous coordinates and the space of the global sections of the line bundle is identified with the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree on . For , this space has dimension and forms an irreducible representation under the standard action of on the polynomial algebra . Weight vectors are given by monomials

: formula_38

of weights , and the highest weight vector has weight .

<text>Roger Williams Straus Jr. (January 3, 1917 – May 25, 2004) was co-founder and chairman of Farrar, Straus and Giroux, a New York book publishing company, and member of the Guggenheim family.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Straus was born in New York City and was raised in a wealthy and influential Jewish family. His mother was Gladys Guggenheim Straus (1895–1980), heir to one of the largest fortunes in America. His father, Roger Williams Straus Sr. (1891–1957), grew up in the family that owned Macy’s and was chairman of the American Smelting and Refining Co., which was owned by his wife&#x27;s family. Straus&#x27; paternal grandfather, Oscar Straus, served as Secretary of Commerce and Labor under President Theodore Roosevelt and was the first Jewish member of a U.S. Cabinet; his paternal grandmother was philanthropist Sarah Lavanburg Straus. Two of his great-uncles perished on the &quot;Titanic&quot;, Isidor Straus and Benjamin Guggenheim.

While Straus Sr. focused on metal, Straus Jr. had his mind on paper. A summer job as copyboy and occasional writer for the White Plains Daily Reporter got him interested in journalism. He dropped out of St. George&#x27;s School, but was accepted to Hamilton College in 1935. In 1937 he transferred to the University of Missouri and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism in 1939 (He would gain honorary Doctor of Literature degrees from U.M. in 1976 and Hofstra University 1989.)

On June 27, 1938, Straus married childhood friend Dorothea Liebmann, great granddaughter of the founder of Rheingold Brewing, Samuel Liebmann and granddaughter of its president Charles Liebmann.

Straus worked a variety of jobs after graduation. He was a reporter for the Columbia Missourian, publisher and editor of a literary magazine called &quot;Asterisk&quot;, and an editorial staff member of &quot;Current History&quot; magazine. He edited a series of history books for G. P. Putnam and also did reporting for the &quot;White Plains Daily Reporter&quot;.

With the onset of World War II, he joined the Navy but a spinal infection prevented him from seeing action. He was put to work in the Magazine and Book Section of the Navy Office of Public Relations in New York, with his friend James Van Alen. Lieutenant Straus was discharged in 1945.

===Publisher===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; editorial page editor Charles Merz, a friend of his father, introduced Straus to John C. Farrar of Farrar &amp; Rinehart (1929–1946). Straus borrowed $30,000 against his inheritance, $70,000 from his Navy co-worker Van Alen, and another $50,000 from others including Julius Fleischmann, whose family was famous for yeast and gin. The two began the firm of Farrar Straus &amp; Co. on November 21, 1945. It was located in the naval office where Straus had served. They earned $200,000 in sales in their first year. Their first blockbuster was Gayelord Hauser&#x27;s &quot;Look Younger, Live Longer&quot;, which was published in 1950 and eventually sold 600,000 copies.

From 1948 to 1971, Farrar Straus acquired seven competitors including Hendricks House, Pellegrini &amp; Cudahy, Noonday Press, and Hill &amp; Wang. In 1950, stockholder Stanley Young was recognized when the company was renamed Farrar, Straus &amp; Young. It was Farrar, Straus &amp; Cudahy in 1953. In 1955, the company hired Editor-in-chief Robert Giroux away from rival Harcourt, Brace. He brought along no fewer than 15 authors including T. S. Eliot and Flannery O&#x27;Connor. The company became known as Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux in 1964 with Giroux’s appointment as chairman of the board.

Straus was regarded as one of the last old-fashioned publishers, faithful to his company and tight with his money, but emphasizing quality over commercial success. His dedication to the publishing business earned him several Nobel Prize-winning authors, including Isaac Bashevis Singer, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Joseph Brodsky, Nadine Gordimer, Czesław Miłosz and T. S. Eliot, and Pulitzer Prize authors such as Robert Lowell, John McPhee, Philip Roth, and Bernard Malamud. The FSG brand became so renowned that author Scott Turow turned down a $350,000 advance from a rival publisher for his first novel, &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot;, so that he could work with Straus, who offered him $200,000.

John McPhee speaking at Straus&#x27;s memorial service said of him, &quot;He was there in my thirties, forties, fifties and sixties, and was still leading me up the street on a leash when I entered my seventies.&quot;

In 1994, twenty years after his partner Farrar had died, Straus ceded control of the company to a German publishing conglomerate, Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group, the type of company he had long disdained and spoken out against. He reportedly made more than $30 million on the sale. Still, he continued to occupy a corner office at company headquarters until pneumonia put him in the hospital and ultimately caused his death in 2004.

<text>Ernő Gerő (; born Ernő Singer; 8 July 1898 – 12 March 1980) was a Hungarian Communist leader in the period after World War II and briefly in 1956 the most powerful man in Hungary as the leader of its ruling communist party.

==Early career==
Gerő was born in Terbegec, Hont County of the Kingdom of Hungary (now Trebušovce, Slovakia) to Jewish parents, although he later repudiated religion. A member of the Hungarian Communist Party from its foundation (November 1918), he abandoned his studies when the Hungarian Soviet Republic was proclaimed and became a permanent member of the Young Communists. When the revolution was crushed, Singer emigrated to Vienna. He returned illegally to Hungary in September 1921 and was arrested after twelve months. Sentenced to 14 years in prison, he was released with a group of Communists after two years following a prisoner exchange agreement between Moscow and Budapest.

Already speaking seven languages, he was hired by the Comintern apparatus in 1925, which immediately sent him to a factory for six months to learn Russian. During his two decades living in the USSR, Gerő was an active NKVD agent. Through that association, Gerő was involved in the Comintern—the international organization of communists—in France, and also fought in the Spanish Civil War, during which he performed purges against Trotskyist groups in the International Brigades.

The outbreak of the Second World War in Europe found him in Moscow again, and he remained for the duration of the war. After the dissolution of the Communist International in 1943, he was in charge of propaganda directed at enemy forces and prisoners of war. Gerő was among the first communist functionaries to return to Hungary in early November 1944. He was a member of Hungary&#x27;s High National Council (provisional government) between 26 January and 11 May 1945. 

In the November 1945 election, the Hungarian Communist Party, under Gerő and Mátyás Rákosi, got 17% of the vote, compared to 57% for the Smallholders&#x27; Party, but the Soviet commander in Hungary, Marshal Kliment Voroshilov, installed a coalition government with communists in key posts. The communists held an election and took full control in 1949, with Rákosi as party leader. Gerő and Mihály Farkas were Rákosi&#x27;s right-hand men.

Rákosi took over the premiership as well in 1952. However, his authority was shaken a year later by the death of Stalin, when Imre Nagy took over as prime minister. Gerő was retained as a counterweight to the reformers. Rákosi, having managed to regain control, was then undermined by Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s secret speech in early 1956 denouncing Stalinism and forced to leave office on 18 July 1956 by Anastas Mikoyan. He retained enough influence that the MDP designates Gerő to succeed him as party leader.

==Gerő interregnum==
Gerő led the country for a brief period, known as the &#x27;Gerő Interregnum&#x27;, from 18 July 1956 to 24 October 1956, just over three months. He had been Rákosi&#x27;s close associate since 1948, and was involved in party expulsions, the industrialization and collectivization of Hungary.

==Later life and death==
On 23 October 1956, students marched through Budapest intending to present a petition to the government. The procession swelled as several people poured onto the streets. Gerő replied with a harsh speech that angered the people, and police opened fire. It proved to be the start of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.

As the revolution spread throughout the country, the central committee met on 25 October and agreed that János Kádár should be made party leader and Imre Nagy be made prime minister, marking the end of the Gerő interregnum. Gerő went to the Soviet Union, but after the revolution was crushed, the Communist government of Kádár initially refused to let him return to Hungary. He was finally allowed to return from exile in 1960, but was promptly expelled from the Communist Party. He worked as an occasional translator in Budapest during his retirement. His character plays a central role in Vilmos Kondor&#x27;s 2012 novel, &quot;Budapest Noir&quot;, and the whole series. He died in Budapest in 1980 at the age of 81.

<text>Catherine Dalling Taylor Stihler (née Taylor; born 30 July 1973) is a Scottish former politician who was chief executive officer (CEO) of Creative Commons from 2020 to 2023. A member of the Scottish Labour Party, she was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Scotland from 1999 to 2019. 

After leaving the European Parliament, she was CEO of non-profit organisation Open Knowledge Foundation and from August 2020 to January 2024 CEO of Creative Commons, followed by Anna Tumadóttir.

In October 2014, she was elected as the 52nd rector of the University of St Andrews, the second woman to hold that post.

==Early and personal life==

Stihler was educated at Coltness High School, later going on to the University of St Andrews where she gained an MA with joint honours in International Relations and Geography and a postgraduate MLitt in International Security Studies. In 2018 she received an honorary Doctorate (D. Litt) from the University of St. Andrews.

Stihler was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours.

In 2022, she was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. 

==Political career==
Whilst a student at St Andrews, she was elected president of the Students&#x27; Association, from 1994–95. She also was on the Scottish Executive Committee of the Labour Party from 1993–95 and was the Young Labour delegate to the National Executive Committee from 1995–97. Whilst a postgraduate student, she stood at the Angus constituency at the 1997 general election. She was not elected however, and finished in third place, behind Sebastian A.A. Leslie of the Conservatives and Andrew Welsh of the Scottish National Party.

Stihler worked for Anne Begg, Member of Parliament for Aberdeen South, as a researcher. She was placed at third on the Labour Party list for Scotland in the 1999 European Parliament election, and therefore took the third Labour Party seat under the d&#x27;Hondt electoral system becoming the UK&#x27;s youngest MEP at the age of 25.

Stihler was re-elected as an MEP for Scotland in 2004 and 2009. She was the unsuccessful Labour candidate in the 2006 Dunfermline and West Fife by-election, coming second with 30.6% of the vote. She served as the Deputy Leader of the EPLP and held positions as Labour&#x27;s Euro spokesperson on health and fisheries. Stihler was Labour&#x27;s Euro-Spokesperson on Consumer Rights and was the only Scottish MEP on the economic and monetary affairs committee.

She supported Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election.

She resigned as an MEP on 31 January 2019, to take up a new role. Her seat was left vacant and not filled by the Scottish Labour Party due to the UK&#x27;s [then] impending exit from The EU on 29 March 2019.

==Later career==
In November 2018, Stihler was appointed as the new Chief Executive Officer of Open Knowledge Foundation. She stood down as an MEP on 31 January 2019 to take up the role in February 2019. On 9 July 2020, Creative Commons announced she would be the new CEO with a starting date of 17 August 2020.

<doc id="725424" wikidata="Q1340111" url="?curid=725424" title="Struan Stevenson">
<text>Struan John Stirton Stevenson (born 4 April 1948) is a Scottish politician. He was the Conservative Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Scotland from 1999 to 2014 and chair and Vice Chair of the Committee on Fisheries, and was also a member of the Executive of the Scottish Conservative party. He was President of the European Parliament&#x27;s Delegation for Relations with Iraq and President of the Friends of Free Iran Intergroup (FoFI).

Stevenson is President of the European Iraqi Freedom Association (EIFA) and Coordinator of the Campaign for Iran Change. He is a columnist with &quot;The Herald&quot; and an international lecturer on human rights. He is CEO of Scottish Business UK (SBUK), a pro-Union business group. He was educated at the independent Strathallan School and the West of Scotland Agricultural College.

== Political career ==
Stevenson attended the West of Scotland Agricultural College and initially managed his family farm before entering politics. His political career began in local councillor for 22 years, sitting on South Ayrshire Council and its predecessor body the Kyle and Carrick District Council. He stood for election to Parliament at the 1987 election, the 1992 election and 1997 election. He was then elected to the European Parliament in 1999, and retained his seat in 2004 and 2009. He retired from the European Parliament at the elections in 2014.

=== Semipalatinsk radiation victims ===

As an MEP, Stevenson led an international campaign to raise awareness and secure aid for the victims of radiation in the Semipalatinsk region of Kazakhstan, where the Soviet Union government tested 607 nuclear devices from 1949 to 1990, leaving an appalling legacy of pollution, deprivation, illness and death. He was awarded with an honorary doctorate in Science from the Semey State Medical Academy, State Medical Academy in Semipalatinsk in recognition of his efforts and on his third visit to Kazakhstan in 2003, he was made an honorary citizen of Semipalatinsk.

In September 2004 Stevenson won a $50,000 prize in an international essay competition sponsored by the US-based John Templeton Foundation for an essay entitled &quot;Crying Forever&quot; describing the suffering of the people of Semipalatinsk. Stevenson donated the entire $50,000 to Mercy Corps Scotland to assist with their work in Semipalatinsk.

In 2006 he published a book, also entitled &quot;Crying Forever&quot;, detailing his experiences in Kazakhstan. The book was launched at the UN Headquarters in New York and all proceeds from its sale were presented by Stevenson to the Children&#x27;s Hospital in Semipalatinsk, totalling over $20,000. In January 2007 Stevenson was decorated by the President of Kazakhstan with the &quot;Shapagat&quot; (&quot;Mercy&quot;) award for his humanitarian work in Semipalatinsk.

=== Ban of cat and dog fur ===

Stevenson also led a successful campaign for eight years in the European Parliament to impose an EU-wide ban on the import, export and trade in cat and dog fur. It was estimated that up to two million cats and dogs were being slaughtered each year in China alone, simply to meet demand for fur products in Europe. Working with Humane Society International, Stevenson&#x27;s campaign generated more than a million emails and signatures on petitions, finally culminating in a draft regulation being prepared by the European Commission and voted through the European Parliament. The regulation was enacted into European Union law across all 27 Member States in 2008.

=== Climate change ===

Stevenson was president of the European Parliament&#x27;s Climate Change, Biodiversity &amp; Sustainable Development Intergroup. He has been an outspoken critic of off-shore wind farms. Stevenson has recently cited the loss of ocean carbon sinks due to offshore wind turbines as a possible reason not to build them, and outlined the pros and cons of wind turbines in his book, &quot;So Much Wind: The Myth of Green Energy&quot;.

=== Iraq ===

Stevenson was chairman of European Parliament&#x27;s Delegation for Relations with Iraq (2009–2014). Since the foundation of the European Iraqi Freedom Association (EIFA), a non-governmental and non-profit organisation based in Brussels 4 April 2014, he has acted as its president.

== Personal life ==
Stevenson&#x27;s wife Pat is a former editor of BBC Radio Scotland. They have two sons and three grandsons. Stevenson comes from a family with historical ties, including a connection to Robert Louis Stevenson, the author of &quot;Treasure Island&quot;.

<doc id="725426" wikidata="Q450298" url="?curid=725426" title="Alyn Smith">
<text>Alyn Edward Smith (born 15 September 1973) is a Scottish politician. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Stirling from 2019 until 2024 when he unsuccessfully stood for the Stirling and Strathallan seat. He also served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Scotland from 2004 to 2019. He has been serving as SNP Spokesperson for Europe and EU Accession since December 2022.

==Early life and education==
Smith was born in Glasgow on 15 September 1973 to Jane and Edward Smith. He grew up between Scotland and Saudi Arabia.

After returning to the UK in 1986, he studied law and European law at the University of Leeds, receiving his LLB (Hons) degree in 1994. He spent a year studying on the Erasmus Programme at the University of Heidelberg in Germany. He gained a master&#x27;s degree in European studies from the College of Europe in Natolin, Warsaw in 1995. The following year, he graduated from Nottingham Law School at Nottingham Trent University, and received a Diploma in Legal Practice. For a year he taught English in India and worked with Scotland Europa in Brussels.

Smith later moved to London, where he qualified as a lawyer with commercial solicitors law firm Clifford Chance, working with them from 1997 to 1999. He was with another solicitors firm, Anderson Strathern, from 2000 to 2002. Smith was a director of Turning Point Scotland from 2011 to 2015, and a trustee of LGBT Youth Scotland from 2012 to 2017. He is Honorary Vice President of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA).

== Political career ==

===European Parliament===
Smith was elected for the first time – as Scotland&#x27;s youngest MEP – in the 2004 European Parliament election. He was re-elected three times at the 2009, 2014 and 2019 European Parliament elections. He sat as a member of the currently seven-strong European Free Alliance Group in the Parliament, which retains its own identity within the joint Green-European Free Alliance Group.

He was a member of the SNP&#x27;s National Executive Committee until he was voted out in November 2020.

In his first two terms in the European Parliament, Smith served as a full member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development winning the coveted &quot;Scottish Farmer Magazine&quot; award for &quot;Outstanding Contribution to Scottish Agriculture&quot; at the Highland Show in 2009.

Following his re-election in 2014, Smith served as a full member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, remaining a voice in agriculture as alternate member of the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee. He was also a full member of both the Delegation for relations with the Arabian Peninsula, and the Delegation for relations with Iraq.

On 27 March 2019, Smith gave a speech to the European Parliament where he argued that Brexit was causing Scotland to be removed from the EU against the will of the Scottish people and claimed that Scottish independence could provide a means for Scotland to rejoin the EU. Many newspaper headlines cited his closing line: &quot;I&#x27;m asking you to leave a light on so we can find our way home.&quot;

On Sky News in May 2019, Smith claimed that the Brexit Party was &quot;a shell company that&#x27;s a money laundering front&quot;. After the party&#x27;s chairman threatened legal action, Smith apologised unreservedly and admitted that he had no evidence for his allegation, made a major contribution to the party chairman&#x27;s legal costs and made a donation to charity. It is alleged that Smith&#x27;s donation was paid by the SNP out of member&#x27;s party donations.

All new EU accession states must commit to joining the euro as a condition of membership and in May 2019 Smith said that Scotland should be &quot;open&quot; to joining the euro if the country becomes independent. In 2021 Smith said an independent Scotland should hold a referendum on the issue. &quot;We would want to participate an economic &amp; monetary union for the macroeconomic stability,&quot; Smith told &quot;La Repubblica&quot;. &quot;The adoption of the euro should be put to the people in a referendum.&quot; He also accepted that the SNP&#x27;s proposals would mean a hard border with England: &quot;The border of Carlisle will be an external border of the European Union, customs union and single market. We&#x27;ve got obligations of policing that, of course.&quot;

Following the election, Smith became President of the European Free Alliance group in the European Parliament, and by holding that office, First Vice-president of the Greens/EFA Group.

===House of Commons===
He contested Edinburgh West for the SNP at the 2001 general election, coming fourth. At the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, he contested the same seat, again coming fourth. Smith was Group Advisor for Justice, Business and Europe for the SNP Group in the Scottish Parliament from 2002 to 2004.

On 12 December 2019, Smith was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Stirling, unseating the previous Conservative Party incumbent Stephen Kerr with a majority of 9,254 votes or 17.6%. Following his election, Smith ceased to be an MEP, as an individual cannot simultaneously be a member of a member state&#x27;s legislature and of the European Parliament.

In July 2022 Smith rejected Labour calls for a general election on the grounds that &quot;I... just enjoy what&#x27;s going on in the UK Government right now because it&#x27;s actually strengthening our case that Westminster doesn&#x27;t work.&quot;

Smith faced a selection challenge for the SNP candidacy of the Stirling and Strathallan seat from the husband of the constituency MSP Evelyn Tweed. It was reported that Smith &quot;easily&quot; saw off the challenge. However, he subsequently lost the seat in the 2024 general election.

==Personal life==
On 30 July 2023, Smith married his long-time partner Jonathon Ramsay at Bannockburn House.

<text>John Robert Purvis, CBE (6 July 1938 – 20 March 2022) was a Conservative MEP for Mid Scotland and Fife (1979–1984) and for Scotland from 1999 to 2009 was one of Scotland&#x27;s seven MEPs.

==Biography==
Purvis was married with three children and ten grandchildren. He had farming and property interests in North East Fife and had extensive knowledge of the international financial services industry, having worked in the sector for several decades and having later contributed his expertise on relevant committees in the European Parliament.

Purvis served as a second lieutenant in the Scots Guards (1956–1958) and graduated MA (Hons) from the University of St Andrews (1962). He worked for First National City Bank in London, New York and Milan (1962–1969) and was Treasurer of merchant bank Noble Grossart Ltd in Edinburgh (1969–1973). He was Managing Director and Chairman of Gilmerton Management Services Ltd St Andrews (1973–1986) and Chairman of the Economic Affairs Committee of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party (1986–1997). He received the CBE in 1990.

In his first term he was appointed to the new Internal Market subcommittee of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. In this capacity he worked with fellow UK MEP Basil de Ferranti and others to propose harmonised standards across a wide range of goods. Their final proposals would form the basis of the Single European Act in 1985.

During his second term as an MEP, Purvis was elected Vice Chairman of the European Parliament&#x27;s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in 2002, and then re-elected to this position during his third term in 2005 and 2007 (2002–2009). He was also a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (1999–2009). He also served on EU delegations to the Gulf States and to Middle Eastern countries and served on the EU Committee of Inquiry into the Equitable Life Assurance Society crisis. During his 15 years as an MEP, Purvis produced a number of major reports which helped to shape EU policy – notably on biotechnology (supporting GM foods), telecommunications and financial regulation.

In 2001, Purvis spoke out against the legality of actions by Customs and Excise officers who were confiscating alcohol and tobacco bought for personal use from travellers returning from the European Union saying such actions were illegal.
In 2002, Purvis stated that he supported the building of a new airport in central Scotland as an alternative to upgrading the airports at Edinburgh or Glasgow.

In 2008, it was alleged that Purvis may have breached rules regarding parliamentary expenses and the payment of staff through a company. Purvis said at the time that he sought clarification from the relevant authorities and such clarification was not forthcoming. He was cleared of any wrongdoing.

Since standing down in 2009, Purvis continued to serve in Europe as Chairman of Financial Future Forum which provides a means of dialogue between the financial services industries of Europe and the EU&#x27;s legislators. He was also Chairman of Belgrave Capital Management in London, and was for many years a Director of Kingdom FM Radio Ltd., Fife, and Advisor to the Board of Elmwood College in Cupar (2012).

He died following a battle with cancer on 20 March 2022, at the age of 83.

<doc id="725431" wikidata="Q132462" url="?curid=725431" title="David Martin (Scottish politician)">
<text>David Martin (born 26 August 1954) is a Scottish politician who has served as co-convener of the Citizens&#x27; Assembly of Scotland since 2019. A member of the Scottish Labour Party, he was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1984 to 2019, having first represented the Lothians constituency until 1999 and then for the Scotland constituency. He was the United Kingdom&#x27;s longest serving MEP and the second longest serving MEP in the whole European Parliament.

==Early life==

David Martin was born and educated in Edinburgh, where he attended Liberton High School then Heriot-Watt University. Prior to entering politics, he worked as a stockbroker&#x27;s assistant, and also as an animal rights campaigner.

==Political career==

Martin was first elected as a councillor in 1982.

===European Parliament===
Martin won the Lothians seat in the 1984 European Parliament election. He retained his seat, and following a reform of the electoral system, was in 1999 elected to represent the whole of Scotland along with other members.

He was elected in 1987 as the youngest ever leader of the British Labour delegation of MEPs. He was Vice-President of the European Parliament from 1989 to 2004, the longest period anyone has served in that position. In 2002 he was the defeated Socialist candidate for President of the Parliament.

He was the European Parliament&#x27;s rapporteur on the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties.

Martin supported Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election.

Martin was first on the Scottish Labour party list for the 2019 European Parliament election. The result for Scotland was declared on 17 May 2019. Scottish Labour lost both its seats, receiving 9.3% of the vote. He did not attend the declaration, leaving Edinburgh City Chambers the night before.

====Trade Committee====
Martin was a co-ordinator and spokesperson for the Socialists and Democrats Group on the International Trade (INTA) committee. As well as this role, he was the rapporteur for the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement and standing rapporteur for the ASEAN-5 countries.

Martin stepped in as the rapporteur for the ACTA treaty after the original rapporteur, Kader Arif, resigned in protest. In April 2012, Martin recommended that the European Parliament reject ACTA, on the grounds that civil liberties were not adequately protected. His recommendation was adopted by the Parliament in the biggest ever defeat of a legislative proposal from the European Commission – 478 MEPs voted against ACTA, 39 in favour, and 165 abstained.

In 2013, Martin was voted MEP of the year in the international trade category by &quot;The Parliament Magazine&quot;.

Martin was the rapporteur for the UN Arms Trade Treaty, encouraging member states to ratify the treaty and pushing for the EU to lead strict global implementation of new rules for greater transparency and responsibility in the arms industry.

====Animal Welfare====
Martin is Honorary Vice-President of the Animal Welfare Intergroup, a cross-party group of MEPs striving for animal rights.

He was instrumental in the 2009 Seal Regulation, which bans the sale of seal products in the European Union. It has been estimated by the Humane Society International that in Canada around 250,000 seals have been saved per year as a result of this ruling. This was reinforced by a landmark WTO ruling following a challenge to the EU legislation by the Norwegian and Canadian governments.

===Scottish politics===
Following the Brexit vote of 23 June 2016, Martin was invited to join the First Minister&#x27;s Standing Council on Europe, a cross-party body which offers advice to the Scottish government on how best to protect Scotland&#x27;s relationship with the European Union. In contrast to England and Wales, Scotland voted firmly in favour of EU membership by 62% to 38%.

In a video he explained, &quot;she [First Minister Nicola Sturgeon] assured me this would be an all-party and no-party, a pro-independence and an anti-independence grouping, that there would be no bias one way or the other. Our job is simply to look at what would be best for Scotland in the new situation that we face&quot;.

In January 2024, Martin became President of the European Movement in Scotland. 

=== Citizens&#x27; Assembly ===
Since losing his seat in 2019, Martin has been appointed as co-convener of the Citizens&#x27; Assembly of Scotland. He took office on 6 August 2019 with co-convener Kate Wimpress.

In July 2019, Joanna Cherry, Member of Parliament for Edinburgh South West, suggested the Assembly would be used to promote Scottish nationalism. Martin, a unionist, refused to endorse a boycott of the Assembly encouraged by Scotland in Union, the Scottish Conservatives and the Scottish Liberal Democrats. He insisted the running of the Assembly would be impartial and expressed his disappointment at the going ahead of the boycott.

==Personal life==
Martin is married to Lorraine Davidson, with two children; he also has two children from a previous marriage to his first wife Margaret.

<text>The Atwood machine (or Atwood&#x27;s machine) was invented in 1784 by the English mathematician George Atwood as a laboratory experiment to verify the mechanical laws of motion with constant acceleration. Atwood&#x27;s machine is a common classroom demonstration used to illustrate principles of classical mechanics.

The ideal Atwood machine consists of two objects of mass and , connected by an inextensible massless string over an ideal massless pulley.

Both masses experience uniform acceleration. When , the machine is in neutral equilibrium regardless of the position of the weights.

== Equation for constant acceleration ==
An equation for the acceleration can be derived by analyzing forces.
Assuming a massless, inextensible string and an ideal massless pulley, the only forces to consider are: tension force (), and the weight of the two masses ( and ). To find an acceleration, consider the forces affecting each individual mass. 
Using Newton&#x27;s second law (with a sign convention of derive a system of equations for the acceleration ().

As a sign convention, assume that &quot;a&quot; is positive when downward for formula_1 and upward for formula_2. Weight of formula_1 and formula_2 is simply formula_5 and formula_6 respectively.

Forces affecting m1: formula_7
Forces affecting m2: formula_8
and adding the two previous equations yields formula_9
and the concluding formula for acceleration formula_10

The Atwood machine is sometimes used to illustrate the Lagrangian method of deriving equations of motion.

<text>Elspeth Attwooll (born 1 February 1943) is a Scottish retired Liberal Democrat politician. She is a former Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Scotland.

She stood for parliament in Glasgow Maryhill in every general election from October 1974 to 1997 as a Liberal before 1988 and a Liberal Democrat after 1988. She was part of the Liberal Democrat delegation to the Scottish Constitutional Convention.

She was first elected to the European Parliament in 1999, the first Liberal Democrat ever to be elected to the European Parliament from Scotland, and retained her seat in 2004. While an MEP, she served on the Fisheries and Regional Development Committees, being elected a vice-chair of the former. She stood down as MEP at the 2009 European Parliamentary elections, and was succeeded by fellow Liberal Democrat George Lyon, a farmer and former MSP for Argyll and Bute.

Her work in the European Parliament was highly respected, and she drafted many influential reports, including one on Community action in relation to whaling which stressed the need for the European Union to use its influence to secure the International Whaling Commission and agreement between the pro- and anti- whaling lobbies within it. She was and is a passionate advocate of radical decentralisation of the Common Fisheries Policy.

Previously, Attwooll taught jurisprudence and legal theory at the School of Law of the University of Glasgow, where she was a senior lecturer.

<doc id="725452" wikidata="Q4176102" url="?curid=725452" title="Geremi González">
<text>Geremi Segundo González Acosta (January 8, 1975 – May 25, 2008) was a Venezuelan right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Chicago Cubs (–), Tampa Bay Devil Rays (–), Boston Red Sox (), New York Mets () and Milwaukee Brewers (2006). In his rookie season he led the Cubs with 11 wins, but he was unable to continue that success in later seasons. He was known as Jeremi González until he was traded to the Brewers in 2006, at which time he informed the team of the proper spelling.

==Professional career==
González was born in Maracaibo, Zulia State. The Cubs signed him as a non-draft amateur free agent in , and he was a highly touted young arm in the Cubs system. He made his debut in 1997, posting a record of 11–9 and finishing ninth in voting for the National League&#x27;s Rookie of the Year Award. He also pitched for the Cubs in 1998, then pitched in the minor leagues for nearly five years between three surgeries and a variety of injuries.

In 2003, he was rewarded by Tampa Bay with the &quot;Out of Nowhere Award&quot;. González ended up being the Rays&#x27; most consistent pitcher, despite his 6–11 record. He allowed three runs or fewer in 17 starts, but received the lowest run support of any AL East starter (3.91 runs per game). He finished with a 3.91 earned run average and 97 strikeouts in 156 innings. González was the pitcher on June 3, 2003, when Sammy Sosa was caught using a corked bat.

Early in the 2005 season, González started three games for the Boston Red Sox, going 1–1 with a 6.65 ERA. Boston optioned him to the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox in late May 2005, then recalled him to the major league club in early July to try to fill a hole in the back end of their bullpen. He appeared in Game 1 of the AL Division Series, a 14–2 loss to the Chicago White Sox, and allowed four runs in 2⅓ innings, including a three-run home run by Scott Podsednik.

In 2006, González started three games for the Mets but performed poorly. During the season, he was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for pitcher Mike Adams. González started five games for the Toronto Blue Jays Triple-A affiliate, the Syracuse Chiefs, in , before being released.

In a six-season majors career, González posted a 30–35 record with 354 strikeouts and a 4.93 ERA in 131 appearances, including 83 starts, four complete games, two shutouts, and 572 ⅔ innings pitched.

González is one of 583 pitchers to have faced Barry Bonds six or more times in his career and the only one of that group never to have allowed him to reach base.

On May 9, , the Yomiuri Giants of Japan&#x27;s Central League signed González. He became the fifth Venezuelan player to play in the JCL during the 2007 season, joining fellow countrymen Alex Cabrera, Darwin Cubillán, Luis González and Alex Ramírez.

==Death==
González died after being struck by lightning in Maracaibo, Zulia on May 25, 2008.

<doc id="725455" wikidata="Q3499853" url="?curid=725455" title="Jim Allister">
<text>James Hugh Allister (born 2 April 1953) is a Northern Irish politician and barrister who has served as Member of Parliament (MP) for North Antrim since the 2024 general election. He founded the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) in 2007 and has led the party since its formation. Prior to his election to Westminster, Allister was a member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for North Antrim, having been first elected in the 2011 Assembly election.

Allister had been a member of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) since its foundation in 1971, and for which he successfully stood for election in the 2004 European Parliament election for Northern Ireland, succeeding Ian Paisley. He continued as a member of the European Parliament (MEP) following his resignation from the DUP and establishment of the TUV, serving until 2009.

==Early life and education==
Jim Allister was born on 2 April 1953 in Listooder, near Crossgar in County Down, where he lived until he was nine, when his family moved to Craigantlet, just outside Newtownards. His parents, Robert Allister and Mary Jane Allister (), were Protestants from County Monaghan; Robert (1911–1998) was from the townland of Leagh, just south of Monaghan. They had moved northeast to County Down from County Monaghan in 1949 or 1950.

Allister was a pupil at Barnamaghery Primary School and later Dundonald Primary School when he moved house. After attending Regent House Grammar School in Newtownards, Allister graduated from Queen&#x27;s University Belfast with a Bachelor of Laws degree with honours in constitutional law. In 1974, he unsuccessfully stood for the post of president of Queen&#x27;s University Belfast Students&#x27; Union.

==Student activist==
Allister quit the Official Unionist Party (OUP) to join the DUP at its founding in 1971. In June 1972, as chairman of the Queen&#x27;s University Democratic Unionist Party Association, Allister wrote a letter published in the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; arguing that Ian Paisley was closely aligned with Enoch Powell&#x27;s &quot;integrationist&quot; stance that Northern Ireland should be closer to the rest of the United Kingdom, and that other unionist leaders were in favour of devolution. In March 1973 Allister was elected to the post of publicity officer for the Queen&#x27;s DUP Association. He was involved in the 1974 Ulster Workers&#x27; Council strike against the Sunningdale Agreement, which had been signed the previous December. A senior loyalist politician recalled walking into the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council HQ on Hawthornden Road in Belfast to find Allister and Peter Robinson &quot;giggling&quot; while phoning Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) headquarters claiming to be Catholics in distress in a loyalist area afflicted by the strike and asking the SDLP to send a car to rescue them. He served as a European Parliament assistant to Ian Paisley from 1980 to 1982.

==Elected politician==
In 1982 he was elected as a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont for North Antrim and served as the DUP assembly chief whip. In 1983 Allister stated that if the DUP were faced with a choice between no devolved government and a power-sharing government with the SDLP or other nationalist representatives, his party would opt for not having a devolved government. He was also the vice-chairman of Scrutiny Committee of Department of Finance and Personnel from October 1982 to June 1986. Outside the Stormont Assembly, he was a member of Newtownabbey Borough Council from 1985 to 1987. In 1983, he stood as a DUP candidate in the Westminster election for East Antrim. However, he narrowly lost to Roy Beggs following a bitter campaign in which he denounced Beggs as a &quot;political gypsy&quot; for leaving the DUP and joining the OUP; Beggs had resigned from the DUP after leading a Larne council delegation to Dún Laoghaire in the Republic of Ireland.

In July 1984, Allister gave a speech at the unveiling of a loyalist mural in a housing estate in the Ballykeel area of Ballymena, County Antrim. Speaking to a crowd of assembled loyalists in Orkney Drive, Allister said; &quot;There are those in this estate who do not like the red, white and blue. To those people and to everyone else who would betray us, the Ulster Loyalists say: &#x27;No surrender&#x27;.&quot; Later, a crowd gathered outside the home of a Catholic family who lived in Orkney Drive, a married couple with six children, and pelted the house with stones, smashing windows and damaging the family car. The father, Ivan Smith, was also reportedly punched and kicked. The Smith family, who had lived in the area for thirteen years, fled shortly afterwards and were later rehoused.

In August 1985, Allister attended the first major meeting of the United Ulster Loyalist Front (UULF) in Portadown. The UULF had originally formed as a committee earlier that year to oppose police plans to reroute traditional Orange Order parades away from nationalist areas of Portadown. The UULF was supported by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) with South Belfast Brigade chief and UDA deputy leader John McMichael being appointed to the coordinating committee. Unionists blamed the Irish government for loyalist parades being rerouted from predominantly Catholic areas and the UULF&#x27;s stated purpose was to oppose further perceived interference from Dublin, although the group&#x27;s secretary told the press ahead of the meeting that &quot;[he] would not expect paramilitary action to be decided tonight&quot;.

==Politics after Anglo-Irish Agreement==
Following the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in November 1985 by the Thatcher and FitzGerald governments, he was a high-profile opponent of the treaty. He was a member of the Joint Unionist Working Party, a body set up by his party and the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) to oversee the unionist campaign against the agreement. During the one-day loyalist strike against the agreement in March 1986 it was reportedly difficult for journalists to move around the &quot;loyalist stronghold&quot; of Larne without the permission of Allister. He was also very vocal in his criticism of Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) chief constable John Hermon; the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; wrote in June 1986 that most of the statements sent by Allister with regards to the chief constable could not be printed &quot;having regards to the law of defamation and libel&quot;. In May 1986 Allister led thirteen other DUP politicians in an occupation of the telephone exchange at Parliament Buildings at Stormont and blocked calls from going through to government departments. The siege ended after the RUC used a sledgehammer to breach the barricaded door. Allister and then DUP deputy leader Peter Robinson held a press conference in September that year threatening to declare Northern Ireland independent from the United Kingdom if the Anglo-Irish Agreement wasn&#x27;t withdrawn. In November 1986 the SDLP called for Allister and other unionist politicians to be prosecuted for incitement following a &quot;violent&quot; speech at a DUP demonstration in Carrickfergus, afterwards the crowd had attacked Catholic property resulting in the death of an elderly Catholic woman.

That same month Allister organised a rally inaugurating the Ballymena battalion of a new loyalist paramilitary group, Ulster Resistance. Allister, DUP deputy leader Peter Robinson, and Ulster Clubs chairman Alan Wright led hundreds of loyalists, many wearing paramilitary uniforms and some wearing masks, parading in a show of strength that culminated at Ballymena Town Hall, where DUP leader Ian Paisley was waiting. Inside Paisley donned a red Ulster Resistance beret on stage, daring the RUC to arrest him while Allister pledged his &quot;personal support&quot; to Ulster Resistance.

Allister claimed that the RUC had erected a &quot;ring of steel&quot; around the town in an attempt to prevent them from marching to the site of the meeting; he was cheered when he informed the gathered crowd that the colour party had instead entered the town through adjoining fields. The RUC denied any undue holdups and stated no arrests were made. When questioned by the press Allister declined to say how many were in attendance but claimed that Ulster Resistance rallies seemed to grow in size every night, declaring:

His departure from active politics in June 1987 followed a reported disagreement with Paisley over a voting pact with James Molyneaux&#x27;s UUP. The situation resembled fellow unionist politician and barrister Robert McCartney&#x27;s in the North Down constituency. McCartney was expelled from the UUP around the same time for not accepting the policy of the leadership.

==Legal career==
Allister was called to the Bar of Northern Ireland as a barrister in 1976, specialising in criminal law. In 2001, he was called to the Inner Bar as Queen&#x27;s Counsel.

In 2003, he represented Loyalist Volunteer Force member Clifford McKeown in court in a case regarding the 1996 murder of Catholic taxi driver Michael McGoldrick. McKeown was found guilty of the murder by the court. Allister said that McKeown would be appealing against the conviction.

==Member of the European Parliament==
Allister returned to the DUP in 2004 and successfully ran as the party&#x27;s candidate in Northern Ireland at the 2004 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom, topping the poll with 175,000 first-preference votes, 32 per cent of the total.

It is reported that he participated in more parliamentary debates and asked more questions than his fellow Northern Irish MEPs Bairbre de Brún of Sinn Féin and Jim Nicholson of the Ulster Unionist Party. Allister was also active as a member of the European Parliament Fisheries Committee and was ranked by the pressure group TaxPayers&#x27; Alliance as the most &quot;hard-working, transparent and pro-taxpayer&quot; of the 75 United Kingdom MEPs during the 2004–2009 European Parliament.

On 27 March 2007, Allister resigned from the DUP because of the party&#x27;s decision to enter into government with Sinn Féin. It was the second occasion on which he had resigned from the party.

In late 2007, there was speculation that Allister might found a new unionist political party. It was also claimed, on 10 October 2007, that he had been approached by the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), but he in fact proceeded to found the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) on 7 December 2007.

In the 2009 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom, this time standing as a TUV candidate, Allister polled 13.5 per cent of the first-preference votes cast but was not re-elected.

==Leader of the TUV==
Jim Allister stood as a TUV candidate in the 2010 Westminster parliamentary election in the North Antrim constituency. Having polled well in the previous year&#x27;s European election, Allister stood a chance of winning the seat. This would have been a tremendous loss to the DUP, as it has historically been the party&#x27;s safest seat and the seat of DUP founder and former party leader Ian Paisley. He came second in the poll with 7,114 votes to the DUP&#x27;s Ian Paisley Jr who polled 19,672 votes.

Allister is a vocal critic of the A5 Western Transport Corridor, and claimed in 2010 a proposed bypass around Dungiven on the A6 would destroy some Protestant-owned farms and suggested this was planned &quot;in order to avoid the more direct route which would disrupt the GAA facilities&quot;.

Allister returned to the Northern Ireland Assembly at the 2011 election, being the last candidate elected in North Antrim.

In 2012, the year after his return to the Assembly, Allister established at Parliament Buildings in Belfast an annual event to mark the European Day of Remembrance of Victims of Terrorism – each year on the anniversary of the Madrid bombings of 11 March 2004, the European Union remembers the victims of terrorist attacks across the world.

In August 2012, Allister called the Parades Commission &quot;little Hitlers&quot; when they placed restrictions on a loyalist parade.

In June 2013, a private member&#x27;s bill proposed by Allister - the Civil Service (Special Advisers) Bill – was voted into law by the Northern Ireland Assembly. The bill&#x27;s aim was to tighten the rules governing appointment of special advisers (SPADS) by ministers of the Northern Ireland government. Amongst other things, the new law debarred anyone convicted of an offence carrying a jail sentence of five years or more from appointment as a SPAD. Allister said that he was inspired to introduce the bill by the example of Ann Travers who had protested against the appointment, in 2011, of former IRA member Mary McArdle to the position of special adviser by the then Sinn Féin minister for culture and arts. McArdle had been convicted for her part in the 1972 murder of Mary Travers and the serious wounding of her father, Tom Travers, a Belfast magistrate. Some years later, Allister recalled: &quot;I labelled it &#x27;Ann&#x27;s Law&#x27; because that&#x27;s a proper tribute to the driving force behind it. That&#x27;s probably my proudest moment as a politician … to have left on the statute book the first victory in years for innocent victims.&quot;

Allister holds conservative views on social policy, and is a supporter of the evangelical creationist lobby group, the Caleb Foundation.

He ran again for Northern Ireland at the 2014 European Parliament election, receiving 75,806 first-preference votes (12.1%), a decrease of 1.6%.

At the 2016 Assembly election, Allister topped the poll in North Antrim, and was elected on the seventh count.

In November 2016, Allister opposed a motion pardoning gay men convicted for formerly illegal homosexual acts.

In February 2021, the Functioning of Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was passed by a vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly. Introduced as a private member&#x27;s bill by Jim Allister, the bill&#x27;s primary aim was to correct dysfunctional behaviour by ministers, special advisers and civil servants who ran the government of Northern Ireland. The Coghlin Report (March 2020) into the Renewable Heating Incentive scheme scandal had proposed 44 recommendations for improvement in the functioning of the Northern Ireland government and its civil service. The NI Executive and Assembly had responded to this report by creating a new code of conduct to address these failures. But Allister was of the opinion that this was insufficient and that law, rather than guidance, was necessary to remedy the problems identified in the report. The bill he proposed was complex, detailed and led to much debate in the Northern Ireland Assembly but most of its content was eventually approved, with only one of the parties in the assembly objecting to all of its content. As a result of the new law, written records of all governmental meetings were to be taken by civil servants, confidential government business was no longer to be discussed via private email accounts, sharing of confidential information which could be used for private financial gain was to be a criminal offence, ministers and special advisers were to sign a registry of interests which would show whether their personal financial interest overlapped with their elected responsibilities, and the appointment of so-called &#x27;super-spads&#x27; by a political party rather than via the normal civil service appointment procedures was prohibited. Finally, the first minister and deputy first minister were to produce a report, every two years, regarding the functional performance of the government, its departments and attached civil service personnel.

An August 2021, opinion poll by the polling company LucidTalk found a large rise in support for Allister&#x27;s party the TUV to 14% of first preference vote intentions in the upcoming May 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly elections. At the same time, the poll found that 51 per cent of those who responded rated Allister&#x27;s performance as &quot;bad or awful&quot;, compared with &quot;bad or awful&quot; ratings for Paul Givan, Jeffrey Donaldson and Michelle O&#x27;Neill of 48, 47 and 45 per cent, respectively. TUV failed to win any new seats in the election, despite increasing their 
overall vote by 5.0%. Allister was re-elected in North Antrim on the fifth count, polling 8,282 first-preferences (16.4%). Expressing his disappointment during the count, he said: “We have 7.6 percent of the vote, a massive increase, but that is not reflected in the number of seats. It is very disappointing when you collect 4-5,000 votes or more in many other constituencies that it doesn’t translate into seats because of the vagaries of the system.”

==Member of Parliament==
In March 2024, the TUV formed an electoral alliance with the right-wing populist party Reform UK, under which they would stand agreed candidates in Northern Ireland at the 2024 United Kingdom general election. Allister later confirmed that he would be contesting the North Antrim constituency for the TUV–Reform alliance. North Antrim had long been regarded as one of the safest DUP constituencies, having been held by Ian Paisley Jr since the 2010 United Kingdom general election and previously his father Ian Paisley since the 1970 United Kingdom general election. Allister defeated Ian Paisley Jr by 450 votes and gave the TUV its first victory in a Westminster election.

Following his election, there was speculation as to whether Allister would sit as a Reform UK MP, alongside their five MPs in the commons. While announcing the former deputy mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Timothy Gaston, as his successor in the Assembly, Allister confirmed that he would not be formally taking the Reform whip, but would do so when supporting the party on &#x27;agreed issues&#x27;. 

In September 2024, Allister came seventh out of twenty successful MPs in the Private Members&#x27; Bill Ballot, entitling him to put forward a bill in the commons.

==Personal life==
Allister married Ruth McCullagh in 1978. They have two sons and a daughter. He is a member of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster.

<doc id="725458" wikidata="Q140140" url="?curid=725458" title="1500 Jyväskylä">
<text>1500 Jyväskylä (), provisional designation , is a stony Florian asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 7 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 16 October 1938, by Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä at the Turku Observatory in Southwest Finland. It was named for the Finnish town Jyväskylä.

== Classification and orbit ==

&quot;Jyväskylä&quot; is a member of the Flora family, a large collisional group of stony asteroids. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.8–2.7 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,227 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.19 and an inclination of 7° with respect to the ecliptic. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins at Turku, 3 weeks prior to its official discovery observation.

== Physical characteristics ==

In 2016, a modeled lightcurve was derived from data contained in the Lowell photometric database. Light-curve analysis gave it a rotation period of 8.8275 hours and a spin axis of (123°, −75.0°) in ecliptic coordinates ().

According to the survey carried out by NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid measures between 7.39 and 8.095 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo between 0.161 and 0.31. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes an albedo of 0.24 – derived from 8 Flora, the largest member and namesake of this family – and calculates a diameter of 6.63 kilometers, using an absolute magnitude of 13.06.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named for the Finnish town Jyväskylä. It is the largest city in the region of Central Finland and on the Finnish Lakeland. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 20 February 1976 ().
