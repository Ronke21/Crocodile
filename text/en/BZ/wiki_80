<text>The VISTA (Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy) is a wide-field reflecting telescope with a 4.1 metre mirror, located at the Paranal Observatory in Chile. It is operated by the European Southern Observatory and started science operations in December 2009. VISTA was conceived and developed by a consortium of universities in the United Kingdom led by Queen Mary University of London and became an in-kind contribution to ESO as part of the UK&#x27;s accession agreement, with the subscription paid by the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).

VISTA is a survey telescope working at infrared wavelengths, and is by far the largest telescope in the world dedicated to surveying the sky at near-infrared wavelengths. The telescope has only one instrument: VIRCAM, the Vista InfraRed CAMera. This is a 3-tonne camera containing 16 special detectors sensitive to infrared light, with a combined total of 67 million pixels.

A second-generation instrument called 4MOST, a 2400-object fibre-fed multi-object spectrograph, is under development to start operations at the telescope in 2025.

Observing at wavelengths longer than those visible to the human eye allows VISTA to study objects that may be almost impossible to see in visible light because they are cool, obscured by dust clouds or because their light has been stretched towards redder wavelengths by the expansion of space during the light&#x27;s long journey from the early Universe.

== The project ==

VISTA is carrying out surveys of the southern sky at near infrared wavelengths. Such surveys should both return direct scientific results and help select objects for further studies with larger telescopes. There are two related projects: the Wide Field Camera (WFCAM) on the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope in Hawaii carries out infrared surveys of the northern sky, and the VLT Survey Telescope in Chile carries out surveys of the southern sky in visible light.



The project was initiated in 1999 by the VISTA Consortium of 18 universities in the United Kingdom (UK), which obtained funding from a joint infrastructure fund of the UK government and further funding from the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council. The project is valued at €46M (£36M).

After considering several sites in Chile, the consortium chose the Paranal Observatory of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), namely a secondary peak 1,500 m from the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The consortium selected the UK Astronomy Technology Centre to take technical responsibility for design and construction of the telescope. Two years later – in 2002 – the UK joined ESO, and VISTA became an in-kind component of the joining fee. The consortium then completed the construction and commissioning of the telescope, and the Science and Technology Facilities Council – on behalf of the UK – handed over the telescope to ESO, for the benefit of astronomers in all its member countries.

==VISTA Surveys==

The scientific goals of the VISTA surveys, which started in 2010, include many of the most exciting problems in astrophysics today, ranging from the nature of dark energy to the threat of near-Earth asteroids.

There are six large public surveys being conducted by VISTA: UltraVISTA, VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (VIKING), VISTA Magellanic Survey (VMC), VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV), VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS), VISTA Deep Extragalactic Observations Survey (VIDEO). These will take up the majority of the observing time in the telescope&#x27;s first five years of operations. The surveys cover different areas of sky to different depths to attack a wide range of scientific questions. More information about each of the VISTA surveys can be found on the ESO — VISTA Surveys website and in the ESO — Public Surveys Projects webpage.

==Science with VISTA==
Because VISTA is a large telescope that also has a large field of view it can both detect faint sources and also cover wide areas of sky quickly. Each VISTA image captures a section of sky covering about ten times the area of the full Moon and it will be able to detect and catalogue objects over the whole southern sky with a sensitivity that is forty times greater than that achieved with earlier infrared sky surveys such as the highly successful Two Micron All-Sky Survey. This jump in observational power—comparable to the step in sensitivity from the unaided eye to Galileo&#x27;s first telescope—will reveal vast numbers of new objects and allow the creation of far more complete inventories of rare and exotic objects in the southern sky.

VISTA observations will support research in many astronomical areas. Within our galaxy, VISTA is expected to find many new brown dwarf stars and be able to test ideas about the nature of dark matter. One VISTA survey is designed to find and study huge numbers of variable stars in our galaxy by taking images of the same areas of sky at different times. Using VISTA data astronomers will be able to map the structure of our galaxy in much more detail than ever before. Another VISTA survey will study our neighbouring small galaxies, the Magellanic Clouds, and their surroundings. VISTA data will also be used to create a 3D map of about 5% of the entire observable Universe. Further out, VISTA will be a powerful tool for discovering remote quasars and studying the evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. It will help to probe the nature of dark energy by finding very distant galaxy clusters. Infrared measurements from the VVV astronomical survey have been employed to bolster the cosmic distance ladder, namely by providing reliable distances to star clusters and Cepheid variable stars.

==Selection of VISTA Images==

The first released image (left) shows the Flame Nebula (NGC 2024), a spectacular star-forming cloud of gas and dust in the familiar constellation of Orion (the Hunter) and its surroundings. In visible light the core of the object is hidden behind thick clouds of dust, but the VISTA image, taken at infrared wavelengths, can penetrate the murk and reveal the cluster of hot young stars hidden within. The wide field of view of the VISTA camera also captures the glow of NGC 2023 and the ghostly form of the famous Horsehead Nebula.

Other stunning nebula images include the VISTA views of the Orion Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula. The picture on the right is a wide-field view of the Orion Nebula (Messier 42), lying about 1350 light-years from Earth, taken with the VISTA infrared survey telescope at ESO&#x27;s Paranal Observatory in Chile. The telescope&#x27;s huge field of view allows the whole nebula and its surroundings to be imaged in a single picture and its infrared vision also means that it can peer deep into the normally hidden dusty regions and reveal the curious antics of the very active young stars buried there. An image of the &quot;Blue Lagoon&quot; is seen on the left (below the Flame Nebula picture) — it is an infrared image taken as part of the VVV survey. It shows the stellar nursery called the Lagoon Nebula (also known as Messier 8), which lies about 4000–5000 light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius (the Archer).


VISTA can also stare far beyond our galaxy. In the example on the left (below the image of the Orion Nebula) the telescope took a family photograph of a cluster of galaxies in the constellation of Fornax (the Chemical Furnace). The wide field allows many galaxies to be captured in a single image including the striking barred-spiral NGC 1365 and the big elliptical galaxy NGC 1399. The image was constructed from images taken through Z, J and Ks filters in the near-infrared part of the spectrum and has captured many of the cluster members in a single image. At the lower-right is the elegant barred-spiral galaxy NGC 1365 and to the left the big elliptical NGC 1399, surrounded by a swarm of faint globular clusters. The image is about 1 degree by 1.5 degrees in extent and the total exposure time was 25 minutes.

== Technical details ==
=== Telescope design===
The objective to repeatedly image large areas of sky at seeing-limited resolution led to a unique optical design. The primary mirror is a concave hyperboloid with 4.1 m diameter and about f/1 focal ratio. The mirror has a meniscus shape of 17 cm thickness with a central 1.2 m hole to accommodate the camera at the Cassegrain focus. It was cast from Zerodur by Schott in Germany and subsequently polished and figured by LZOS, Moscow. It is the largest mirror of this shape and of such short focal ratio; polishing it took 2 years, which was longer than anticipated. The mirror is supported by a number of actuators (81 on the back and 24 around the edge), which allow its shape to be controlled by computers.

The secondary mirror is a convex hyperboloid of 1.24 m diameter. The combination of the two hyperbolic mirrors makes this a quasi-Ritchey-Chrétien design. The combined focal ratio is about f/3, but the image quality of the two mirrors alone would be poor. The secondary mirror is mounted on a hexapod support so that its position, tip, and tilt are also computer-controlled.

The infrared camera was built by a consortium composed of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, the UK Astronomy Technology Centre, and Durham University, and is the world&#x27;s largest at almost three tonnes. Telescope and camera form a single optical design, as the three field correction lenses in the camera are essential for the projection of a focussed image of the sky on the detectors.

For an infrared camera, it is also vital to block heat radiation from the telescope and dome. This is accomplished by a sequence of cooled baffles in front of the field corrector lenses. Also, the secondary mirror is undersized to avoid edge detectors viewing warm structure outside the edge of the primary; this means the aperture seen by any point in the image plane is 3.7 m. This design requires the camera&#x27;s vacuum cryostat – which cools the detectors as well as the baffles – to be more than 2 m long, with a front window of 95  cm diameter. A filter wheel just in front of the detectors allows the selection of a particular infrared wavelength range.

Over an area corresponding to 1.65° diameter on the sky, the image plane has 16 arrays of infrared detectors, each array with 2048x2048 pixels of 20 μm size, corresponding on average to 0.34&quot; on the sky. The focal length of 12.1 m combines with the baffled aperture of 3.7 m to a focal ratio of 3.26. The arrays are separated by 90% of their width in one direction and by just under 50% their width in the other direction. A single exposure therefore corresponds to a patchy &quot;paw print&quot; on the sky. To fill the gaps and obtain a conventional image at least six shifted paw prints have to be combined into a &quot;tile&quot;, which then is 1.5° by 1.0°. The image plane of the camera also has wave front detectors used to control the shape of the primary mirror and the position and tip/tilt of the secondary mirror (active optics). This compensates for flexure and ensures a focused image at all altitudes.

The hilltop where VISTA is located was flattened to erect the enclosure building and an auxiliary building. The auxiliary building includes facilities to wash, strip, and coat the primary mirror. The coating can be in aluminium, or normally in protected silver for better infrared performance. The fixed base of the enclosure supports the rotating steel dome. Two sliding doors form the dome slit. Further dome panels can be opened to increase ventilation, and a wind shield can be deployed to close parts of the slit. During the day, the dome is kept at night-time temperature.

=== Operation and data flow ===
On completion, the telescope was handed over to ESO, which has selected six public surveys for VISTA, taking up 75% of the available observing time. Proprietary surveys to occupy the remaining time are proposed to ESO, which will schedule approved proposals for observation. The observations are carried out by operators at the Paranal Observatory, remotely from the VLT control building.

The combination of the large detector array and the short and frequent exposures necessary at infrared wavelengths results in a high data rate of 200–300 GB per night. A quick-look reduction at the Paranal Observatory will be used for daily quality control, but the principal data flow is to transfer the raw data to ESO headquarters in Garching near Munich, Germany, for ingestion into the data archive. Users can extract paw prints (see above) and pass them through a calibration pipeline to remove instrumental artefacts and calibrate the astrometry and photometry. The archive data will also be copied to the VISTA Data Flow System in the UK, where the paw prints will be combined into tiles (see above) and where source catalogues will be prepared from these.

<doc id="749812" wikidata="Q7090872" url="?curid=749812" title="OnTrack">
<text>OnTrack was a suburban rail line that operated in Syracuse, New York, from 1994 to 2008. The line ran from the Carousel Center (today&#x27;s Destiny USA) on the city&#x27;s north side via Armory Square and Syracuse University to Colvin Street, with summer weekend service south to Jamesville, mainly using 1950s-era diesel railcars.

The line was the result of a public-private partnership between the state of New York, Onondaga County and the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway (NYSW), a Class II regional freight carrier. The NYSW received tax breaks and grants in exchange for operating passenger service on the Syracuse line. Although OnTrack was initially successful, ridership declined and was ultimately discontinued due to inadequate rush hour service, poor publicity and failure to connect to Syracuse&#x27;s Amtrak and intercity bus routes. 

In recent years, there have been proposals to complete the line and restart passenger service, potentially as a light rail system.

==History==
Starting in the late 19th century, an extensive series of electric interurban railways served the Syracuse region, but by the 1930s local rail service ceased, and was replaced by buses and automobiles. In the 1990s, Syracuse University graduate Robert Colucci proposed converting for passenger service a roughly segment of the old Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad&#x27;s Syracuse–Binghamton line between Carousel Center (now Destiny USA) in the north and Jamesville in the south. At the time, the little-used right of way was owned by Conrail which considered it a financial burden, so it was sold for $1 to the Onondaga County Industrial Development Agency (IDA). The Onondaga IDA leased the track to the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway (NYSW) at a bargain rate, and allowed the NYSW to use it for freight service on the condition that a passenger rail service be run at least 250 days per year with 1,250 round trips. In addition, the NYSW received a $400,000 tax break from the state of New York in order to cover operating costs.
Since the rail infrastructure was already in place, the state of New York provided a $4.5 million grant to purchase rolling stock (four 1950 Budd Rail Diesel Cars) and construct passenger stations along the former freight line. OnTrack was incorporated on September 24, 1994 and the primary service (known as the &quot;City Express&quot;) began in October between Syracuse University and Carousel Center, ten times a day and seven days a week. OnTrack initially exceeded expectations, carrying 45,757 passengers in its first three months of service. However, the line never turned a profit, and relied on state subsidies and volunteers to keep it running.

With the initial success of the line, NYSW proposed expansions to the service, including a 2002 proposal for intercity service from Syracuse to Binghamton, stopping at several OnTrack stations as well as Cortland. However, the schedule was not optimized for commuter usage. Rather, the train was meant to bring visitors to popular destinations such as downtown museums and restaurants, weekend excursion trips to Jamesville Beach Park, the &quot;Santa Train&quot;, and the &quot;Orange Express&quot; special service for Carrier Dome events. 

A high priority project was a connection to the William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center, where it could link directly to Amtrak and local/intercity buses, and the adjacent new Alliance Bank Stadium (now known as NBT Bank Stadium) and CNY Regional Market, which would make the line much more useful for commuters. This would require the construction of a new bridge over Park Street (State Route 370), so that local trains would not interfere with operations on the CSX (formerly New York Central) main line. Centro, Syracuse&#x27;s local transportation agency, began construction on the bridge in 1998, and also prepared a platform at the Walsh Transportation Center to allow direct transfer between OnTrack and Amtrak trains. Congressman Jim Walsh approved a $3 million grant for the project. However, CSX objected due to concerns that construction might destabilize the adjacent freight rail bridge across Park Avenue. The bridge project never came to fruition, and more than 300 tons of steel budgeted for construction were scrapped. 

By the mid-2000s, ridership had dropped greatly due to the lack of continued publicity. Services were reduced, which led to further decrease in patronage. By 2003 the train ran only four days a week. It was found that NYSW had used large amounts of state grants and tax breaks to fund freight service and repair track on its other lines, rather than for OnTrack as the money had been intended. Another reason for the lack of growth in ridership was the lack of stations in residential areas, limiting the line&#x27;s use by commuters. In 2007 service had been cut to weekends only and ridership had declined to 50 passengers per day, far short of the 500 per day required to be profitable. NYSWR chairman Walter Rich, one of OnTrack&#x27;s major proponents, died in 2007, and the railroad&#x27;s interest in continuing OnTrack service diminished. Regular service was terminated indefinitely in July 2007. The Orange Express ran its last train in March 2008. The line continues to be used, infrequently, by freight trains.

==Route==

The OnTrack route starts at Destiny USA in the north, and runs along the south shore of Onondaga Lake and under I-690 before turning southeast through the Westside neighborhoods of Syracuse, roughly paralleling Erie Boulevard. It passes directly through downtown Syracuse near Armory Square, turning south along Onondaga Creek, then through the Southside and under I-81 where it skirts the west side of the Syracuse University campus and Oakwood Cemetery to Colvin Street. The line then turns east through rolling countryside along I-481, leaving the city of Syracuse, and then south again towards Jamesville and along the western shore of Jamesville Reservoir to Jamesville Beach Park. Within Syracuse, the line passes through a mix of residential, commercial, retail and light industrial areas; south of Brighton Avenue and the city limits it traverses mostly undeveloped rural land.

The entire line north of Jamesville is grade-separated, and in downtown Syracuse most of the line is elevated. The line is single-tracked with passing sidings at Armory Square (old Downtown station) and Jamesville. The section south of Syracuse University was only used by special excursion trains, although in 1999 when parts of Interstate 81 were temporarily closed for construction, the federal government briefly subsidized free commuter service between Jamesville and downtown. Only four of the stations (Carousel Center, Armory Square, Syracuse University and the unfinished station at Alliance Bank Stadium) had covered platforms. The regular fare was $1.50, and the fare for the Orange Express was $4 (from Armory Square) or $5 (from Carousel Center).

===List of stations===
==Rolling stock==

OnTrack was operated with four Budd Rail Diesel Cars (RDC-1) &quot;Buddliners&quot; built in the 1950s. All OnTrack cars were owned by the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway and returned to NYSW upon the demise of the commuter rail service. By 2008, the RDCs were either sold or out of service. The Orange Express required longer trains and used retired Metra passenger cars, pulled by various NYSW locomotives.

*M-5: Budd RDC-1 built for New Haven Railroad (NHRR) #23 built in 1952; later served with Penn Central Transportation Company (PC) as #68; Metro-North Railroad (MNR) as # 18, Amtrak as # 18; sold to Conway Scenic Railroad of New Hampshire in May 2008
*M-6: Budd RDC-1 built in 1953 for NHRR as # 37; later served with PC (#37); MNR (#11); Amtrak (#11); still owned by NYSWR 
*M-7: Budd RDC-1 built in 1953 for NHRR as # 43; later served with PC (#43); MNR (#43) and now with Southern Railroad of New Jersey since 2008. This specific car has been sitting abandoned in a lot owned by SRNJ since 2009.
*M-8: Budd RDC-1 built in 1953 for New York Central Railroad as # 465; later served with PC (#65) and MNR (#65)

==Closure==
The rolling stock has been scrapped or sold to other companies. Most stations are sitting abandoned. Many people agree that the only reason that OnTrack was not profitable was due to lack of service hours during rush hour, as well as there being no physical connection between the William J. Walsh Transportation Center and the rest of the line. 

Although a connection was planned and was under construction, plans halted soon after construction began, as Conrail claimed that the construction to the bridge was weakening their bridge next to it. The metal to build the bridge was scrapped and sold in 2013, long after the rail lines&#x27; demise.

==Future==
Local authorities have discussed the possibility of renewed OnTrack service, perhaps as a light rail system. Eric Ennis, an economic development specialist for the city of Syracuse, has cited new development in the University Hill neighborhood, a residential boom in downtown, and the expansion of Destiny USA as potential sources of increased ridership. New stations in the low-income neighborhoods the line passes through would increase mobility for carless residents. The Syracuse Regional Airport Authority, which operates Syracuse Hancock International Airport, has also considered the potential benefits of restarting OnTrack service with an extension to the airport.

In June of 2023, the tax break for NYSW ended. Onondaga County sent NYSW a bill of $290,000. There is a pending legal battle about the assessment of the property.

<doc id="749813" wikidata="Q2995405" url="?curid=749813" title="Contact Theatre">
<text>Contact is an arts organisation based in Manchester, England. Established in 1972, as a center for young artists to create and learn, the theatre remains in its original building and is a part of the Arts Council England, the University of Manchester, the Manchester City Council, and the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities..

==History==
Contact was founded in 1972 by Barry Sheppard (General Manager of what was then Manchester University Theatre) and Hugh Hunt (Professor of Drama), as Manchester Young People&#x27;s Theatre as part of the University of Manchester. 

In 1999, following a £5 million investment from Arts Council England, Contact was redesigned and opened as an arts venue for young people. It is funded by Arts Council England, the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities, Manchester City Council, and the University of Manchester, but it is independently managed. 

Apart from traditional theatre, it features dance, music, poetry, spoken word, hip-hop and art. Its program includes touring work along with in-house productions, which are developed through partnerships featuring young artists.

Contact is a registered charity.

=== Programs ===
In 2002, Contact began hosting a series named &quot;Contacting The World.&quot; This is a biannual international project allows young people from around the world to create new theatre projects, and culminates in a Festival Week in July.

Contacting The World has featured companies from Malaysia, Trinidad, Nigeria, Rwanda, Palestine, Brazil, Poland, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Jordan, Bangladesh, Syria, Iran, South Africa, New Zealand, The Philippines, Nepal, Zambia, Germany, Turkey, the UK and USA.

==Architecture==
Contact&#x27;s distinctive building was designed by architect Alan Short and Associates as part of the venue&#x27;s 1999 redesign. Arts Council England contributed £4.5 million toward the building, with matched funding from English Partnerships and land donated by the University of Manchester. In 2022, the theatre was renovated by Sheppard Robson, to improve energy efficiency and update the grounds while preserving the original design. 

It is located on Devas Street, Chorlton-on-Medlock, near the university&#x27;s School of Education and Department of Drama. The main 320-seat auditorium (Space 1) was refitted and an 80-seat studio (Space 2) was added in the newly built turret.

<text>Sevas Hanum (; 8 September 1931 - 18 May 1990) was a Greek singer. Her real name was Sevasti Papadopoulou () and she became popular in the 1950s and 1960s by singing oriental songs.
She was engaged to Stelios Kazantzidis, with whom she worked.

In 1983, Sevas Hanum gave an interview to Giorgios Chronas, that was used for a theater play about her life. The play was directed by Konstantinos Rigos and performed by Konstantina Mihail and Jason Chronis.

<doc id="749817" wikidata="Q7261318" url="?curid=749817" title="Purley Way">
<text>Purley Way is a section of the A23 trunk road in the London Borough of Croydon, in the areas of Purley, Waddon and Broad Green, and has given its name to the out-of-town shopping area alongside it with a catchment area covering most of South London.

It was designed as a bypass for Croydon, and opened in April 1925. It was formed from improvements to pre existing local roads: from north to south, Waddon Marsh Lane, Waddon Court Road and Coldharbour Lane. (Thornton Road, the northern section of the bypass, was not renamed.) In 1932, Purley Way became the first road in the United Kingdom to be lit with sodium lights.

==Industrial history==
The opening of Purley Way attracted industry to the area and it became the main industrial area of Croydon. Industry attracted to the area included Redwing Aircraft Ltd, Trojan Ltd (car manufacturers) and Tizer Ltd. There were also several metal companies including Standard Steel Co, Croydon Foundry Ltd, Metal Propellers Ltd and Southern Foundries Ltd.

Croydon &quot;B&quot; Power Station, with architecture designed by Robert Atkinson, was built in the end of the 1940s and opened in 1950. It shut down in 1984, was demolished in 1991, and an IKEA was opened on its site. Its immediate surroundings were developed as the Valley Park Retail and Leisure Complex. The large chimneys of the power station were retained as a local landmark, which can be seen from Central Croydon&#x27;s Centrale Shopping Centre.

Croydon &quot;A&quot; power station and the Croydon Gas Works were also on the Purley Way. The cooling towers of the gas works were huge, and featured in films including Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985).

Croydon Airport (operational 1928–1959) was also located on Purley Way.

==Retail history==
In the early 1980s, retail warehouses began to appear on the Purley Way. The first opened on the Thornton Road Industrial Estate: the Queensway furniture store in 1980, MFI Furniture in 1981, Payless DIY in 1983, and Do It All in 1986. In March 1981, Sainsbury&#x27;s opened the first Homebase on Purley Way. In November 1991, Vision Technology Group Ltd opened the first PC World on Purley Way.

Several distinct retail parks are now found along the length of the Purley Way, including Valley Park Retail and Leisure Complex, Croydon Fiveways and Colonnades Leisure Park. The development of the area for retail purposes was not the result of local planning guidance, but occurred as part of a national trend towards out of town shopping. The retail parks were not formally recognised by Croydon Council until the publication of its 1997 Unitary Development Plan.

===IKEA Croydon===
The IKEA in Croydon is a 23,000 m2 furniture store which opened in 1992, on the site of Croydon &quot;B&quot; Power Station. The old power station chimneys, with the addition of illuminated bands in the store&#x27;s blue and yellow colours, were retained as a prominent advertisement. The store was revamped during 2006, to make it the largest IKEA in Britain: it was re launched in May 2006, at a ceremony attended by Mayor Maggie Mansell, and the ambassador of Sweden, Stefan Karlsson.

IKEA is now the fifth biggest single employer in Croydon. The landmark chimneys have been a continuing point of contention with local residents. In September 2003, IKEA briefly considered demolishing them, stating that they cost over £70,000 a year to maintain, but decided against it. Ideas that have been aired for their use have included incorporating a museum of the site&#x27;s history, and constructing a revolving restaurant at the top.

Tony Blair and Gordon Brown visited IKEA on 5 May 2005, during the General Election campaign.

==Other information==
Purley Way Lido operated from 1935 to 1979; the diving board remains in the middle of a garden centre (which is now closed). The Croydon Water Palace, an indoor water park complex, operated nearby from 1990 to 1996. The site of the Water Palace is now occupied by Colonnades Leisure Park. In the past, there has been a depository for the Science Museum in the Retail Park area, and Tramlink passes Purley Way.

<text>Alytus () is a city with municipal rights in southern Lithuania. It is also the capital of Alytus County. Being the historical centre of the Dzūkija region, it is connected to several major roads, linking it with the cities of Vilnius; Kaunas; Lazdijai, which is on the border with Poland; and Grodno, Belarus. In July 2024, its total population was counted as 50,996 people. The city lies on the banks of the Nemunas river.

For centuries, the city was divided into two separate entities. Even today, it consists of two parts still frequently referred to as &quot;Alytus I&quot; and &quot;Alytus II&quot;. The &quot;Alytus I&quot; half is smaller, and less developed than the &quot;Alytus II&quot; half, which forms the city centre with parks, microdistricts and industrial areas.

==Name==
The name of the city is believed to be derived from the Lithuanian hydronym &quot;Alytupis&quot; (meaning river). Its name in other languages includes the Polish &quot;Olita&quot;, the German &quot;Aliten&quot;, the Russian&quot;Olita&quot;, the Belarusian &quot;Alita&quot;, and the Yiddish &quot;Alite&quot;.

==History==

The first historical record of Alytus dates back to 1377, when it was mentioned in the Chronicles of Wigand of Marburg under the name of &quot;Aliten&quot;. According to the chronicle the spot was occupied by a small, wooden fortress guarding the Lithuanian frontier with the Teutonic Order. The fort and the surrounding village gradually grew, despite being frequently a target of raids of both the Lithuanians and the Teutons. The Treaty of Lake Melno left the town on the Teutonic side of the border, but it was retaken soon afterwards. On 15 June 1581 Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland Stefan Batory granted the town the city rights based on the Magdeburg Law. The event is celebrated as the &quot;Alytus Day&quot;.

Until the Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth the town was a part of the Trakai Voivodeship of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and a notable center of commerce on the Nemunas river, serving as the main route for export goods from Lithuania proper. The town was also important as the place where one of the royal economic offices was located. In the third partition of Poland and Lithuania, in 1795, the town was divided between the Russian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia. During the Napoleonic Wars, following the Treaty of Tilsit, the western part was ceded to the Duchy of Warsaw. After the Congress of Vienna it became part of the duchy&#x27;s successor state, the Kingdom of Poland. Although the state was tied with a personal union with Russia, both parts of the town remained completely separate until the January Uprising of 1863. After that date, the autonomy of Poland was liquidated, but both parts of the town remained governed separately.

In the late 19th century the town was incorporated into a chain of Russian fortified garrisons along the border with East Prussia. It was tied with the rest of the world by a railway and a new road. In addition, the tsarist authorities constructed several barracks and an Eastern Orthodox church (in modern times converted to a Catholic church). However, despite the fortification effort by the Russians, during World War I the Central Powers managed to capture the town intact, without any major skirmish. In 1915 the town was incorporated into the so-called Ober Ost and both parts were once again united into a single administrative entity for the first time since 1795.

Following the end of World War I the area remained contested by newly independent Poland and Lithuania, with the actual control held by the German army stationed in the area. When the Germans withdrew in early 1919, the town was seized by the Red Army. On 12 February 1919, the town became a battlefield for the first skirmish between the Russians and the Lithuanian forces, which eventually took control over it. Since then the town has been a part of the Republic of Lithuania.

Following the invasion of Poland a large prisoner of war camp for Polish soldiers was established in the city. During World War II, Alytus was under German occupation from 22 June 1941 until 15 July 1944. Following the German occupation of the city in 1941, the camp was converted into a prison camp for Soviet soldiers (Stalag 343). The 1965 Soviet-era book &quot;Masinės žudynės Lietuvoje, 1941–1944&quot; lists two major mass graves in Alytus: Vidzgiris forest, then at the southeastern suburbs on the left bank of the river, estimated 60,000 people, most likely Jews from the eastern Soviet Union, and the Alytus forest, then at the eastern suburbs, estimated 35,000 people, most probably Soviet prisoners of war. Historian Gintaras Lučinskas argues that these numbers were politicized and grossly inflated, and the actual number of victims is in single digits of thousands.

In 2015, a HVDC back-to-back station for the realization of a power interconnection between Poland and Lithuania (LitPol) was inaugurated west of Alytus. The facility built by ABB has a transmission capacity of 500 MW at a voltage of ±70 kV.

The coat of arms features a white rose, one of two coat of arms in the country that features roses. &quot;The bridge of White Rose&quot; is the country&#x27;s largest pedestrian bridge, whose name was chosen by the citizens. The bridge was built on the remains of a railway bridge, which was blown up by the Russians when they were retreating back in 1915.

==Climate==
Alytus has a humid continental climate with quite large seasonal differences.

==Culture==

Alytus hosted the Art Strike Biennial between 18 and 24 August 2009 in response to Vilnius becoming European Capital of Culture for 2009. This included a demonstration and a three sided football match. The universal indoor Alytus Arena hosted the Eurobasket 2011 Group C matches in Alytus. In 2010, Alytus was awarded the Honourable Plate of the European Council.

Alytus has a museum dedicated to veterans of both the Afghan wars.

In Alytus, several Bonsai exhibitions were held with participants from European and other countries, such as Japan and the United States.

Alytus has hosted an annual Tomato tasting since 2007. Participants offer a wide variety of tomatoes and discuss the various factors which help produce a rich crop of the fruit. Alytus has an industrial company named Snaigė, which manufactures refrigerators.

<doc id="749824" wikidata="Q1292717" url="?curid=749824" title="Edward Johnston">
<text>Edward Johnston, CBE (San José de Mayo, Uruguay 11 February 1872 – 26 November 1944) was a British craftsman who is regarded, with Rudolf Koch, as the father of modern calligraphy, in the particular form of the broad-edged pen as a writing tool.

He is best known as the designer of Johnston, a sans-serif typeface that was used throughout the London Underground system until the 1980s. He also redesigned the famous roundel symbol used throughout the system.

==Early life==
Johnston was born in San José de Mayo, Uruguay. His father, Fowell Buxton Johnston (born 1839), was an officer in the 3rd Dragoon Guards, and the younger son of Scottish MP Andrew Johnston and his second wife, abolitionist Priscilla Buxton, daughter of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, 1st Baronet. Johnston&#x27;s uncle (his father&#x27;s elder brother), also Andrew Johnston, became an MP in Essex in the 1860s.

The family returned to England in 1875. With his father seeking work, and his mother ill, Johnston was raised by an aunt. He was educated at home, and enjoyed mathematics, technology, and creating illuminated manuscripts. His mother died in 1891, and he began to work for an uncle. He spent some time studying medicine at Edinburgh University but did not complete the course.

After his mother&#x27;s death, his father was remarried, to a sister of Robert Chalmers, 1st Baron Chalmers. Johnston&#x27;s half-brother, Andrew Johnston (1897–1917), was killed when his aeroplane crashed while serving in the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War.

==Career==
After studying published copies of manuscripts by architect William Harrison Cowlishaw, and a handbook by Edward F. Strange, he was introduced to Cowlishaw in 1898 and then to William Lethaby, principal of the Central School of Arts and Crafts. Lethaby advised him to study manuscripts at the British Museum, which encouraged Johnston to make his letters using a broad edged pen.

Lethaby also engaged Johnston to teach lettering, and he started teaching at the Central School in Southampton Row, London, in September 1899, where he influenced the typeface designer and sculptor Eric Gill. From 1901 he also taught a class at the Royal College of Art and many students were inspired by his teachings.

He published a handbook, &quot;Writing &amp; Illuminating, &amp; Lettering&quot; in 1906. He started a second book in the 1920s but it was unfinished at his death.

In 1913, Frank Pick commissioned him to design a typeface for London Underground, and the simple and clear sans-serif Johnston typeface was the result.

In 1913, Johnston was one of the editors of &quot;The Imprint&quot;, a periodical for the printing industry. For this paper, Monotype made a complete new font: Imprint, series 101, exclusively for use in &quot;The Imprint&quot;. Actually this was the first revival character font Monotype made. In the 9 issues of &quot;The Imprint&quot;, many articles about calligraphy were included.

He has also been credited for reviving the art of modern penmanship and lettering single-handedly through his books and teachings. Johnston also devised the simply crafted round calligraphic handwriting style, written with a broad pen, known today as the foundational hand (what Johnston originally called a slanted pen hand, which was developed from Roman and half-uncial forms).

He influenced a generation of British typographers and calligraphers, including Graily Hewitt, Irene Wellington, Harold Curwen and Stanley Morison, Alfred Fairbank, Florence Kingsford Cockerell, Eric Gill and Percy Delf Smith. He also influenced the transition from Gothic to Roman letters in Germany, and Anna Simons was a student. He also lectured in Dresden in 1912. In 1921, students of Johnston founded the Society of Scribes &amp; Illuminators (SSI), probably the world&#x27;s foremost calligraphy society.

Not all his students were happy with his decision to create a sans-serif design for the Underground, in a style thought of as modernist and industrial. His pupil Graily Hewitt privately wrote to a friend:In Johnston I have lost confidence. Despite all he did for us...he has undone too much by forsaking his standard of the Roman alphabet, giving the world, without safeguard or explanation, his block letters which disfigure our modern life. His prestige has obscured their vulgarity and commercialism.

Johnston also created a blackletter-influenced design for a 1929 German edition of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

==Personal life==
He met Greta Grieg, a Scottish schoolmistress, in 1900, and they were married in 1903. They had three daughters. They lived in London until moving, in 1912, to Ditchling, Sussex, where Eric Gill had settled in 1907. His wife died in 1936. He was appointed a CBE in 1939. He died at home in Ditchling, and is buried in St Margaret&#x27;s churchyard.

==Edward Johnston Memorial in Farringdon Station==
A memorial to Johnston was unveiled in 2019 at Farringdon Station. Designed by Fraser Muggeridge, it is dedicated to both Johnston and his underground alphabet. Compared to both signage and sculpture, the memorial is huge wood type mounted on the wall of the underground station.

<doc id="749827" wikidata="Q435910" url="?curid=749827" title="Polarization mode dispersion">
<text>Polarization mode dispersion (PMD) is a form of modal dispersion where two different polarizations of light in a waveguide, which normally travel at the same speed, travel at different speeds due to random imperfections and asymmetries, causing random spreading of optical pulses. Unless it is compensated, which is difficult, this ultimately limits the rate at which data can be transmitted over a fiber.

==Overview==

In an ideal optical fiber, the core has a perfectly circular cross-section. In this case, the fundamental mode has two orthogonal polarizations (orientations of the electric field) that travel at the same speed. The signal that is transmitted over the fiber is randomly polarized, i.e. a random superposition of these two polarizations, but that would not matter in an ideal fiber because the two polarizations would propagate identically (are degenerate).

In a realistic fiber, however, there are random imperfections that break the circular symmetry, causing the two polarizations to propagate with different speeds. In this case, the two polarization components of a signal will slowly separate, e.g. causing pulses to spread and overlap. Because the imperfections are random, the pulse spreading effects correspond to a random walk, and thus have a mean polarization-dependent time-differential (also called the differential group delay, or DGD) proportional to the square root of propagation distance :

formula_1

 is the &quot;PMD parameter&quot; of the fiber, typically measured in ps/, a measure of the strength and frequency of the imperfections.

The symmetry-breaking random imperfections fall into several categories. First, there is geometric asymmetry, e.g. slightly elliptical cores. Second, there are stress-induced material birefringences, in which the refractive index itself depends on the polarization. Both of these effects can stem from either imperfection in manufacturing (which is never perfect or stress-free) or from thermal and mechanical stresses imposed on the fiber in the field — moreover, the latter stresses generally vary over time.

==Compensating for PMD==

A PMD compensation system is a device which uses a polarization controller to compensate for PMD in fibers. Essentially, one splits the output of the fiber into two principal polarizations (usually those with , i.e. no first-order variation of time-delay with frequency), and applies a differential delay to re-synchronize them. Because the PMD effects are random and time-dependent, this requires an active device that responds to feedback over time. Such systems are therefore expensive and complex; combined with the fact that PMD is not yet the limiting factor in the lower data rates still in common use, this means that PMD-compensation systems have seen limited deployment in large-scale telecommunications systems.

Another alternative would be to use a polarization maintaining fiber (PM fiber), a fiber whose symmetry is so strongly broken (e.g. a highly elliptical core) that an input polarization along a principal axis is maintained all the way to the output. Since the second polarization is never excited, PMD does not occur. Such fibers currently have practical problems, however, such as higher losses than ordinary optical fiber and higher cost. An extension of this idea is a single-polarization fiber in which only a single polarization state is allowed to propagate along the fiber (the other polarization is not guided and escapes).

==Related phenomena==

A related effect is polarization-dependent loss (PDL), in which two polarizations suffer different rates of loss in the fiber due, again, to asymmetries. PDL similarly degrades signal quality.

Strictly speaking, a circular core is not required in order to have two degenerate polarization states. Rather, one requires a core whose symmetry group admits a two-dimensional irreducible representation. For example, a square or equilateral-triangle core would also have two equal-speed polarization solutions for the fundamental mode; such general shapes also arise in photonic-crystal fibers. Again, any random imperfections that break the symmetry would lead to PMD in such a waveguide.

<text>The Raschig process for the production of hydroxylamine is one of three chemical processes developed by German chemist Friedrich Raschig. The main step in this process, patented by Raschig in 1887, is the reduction of nitrite with bisulfite towards hydroxylamine disulfonate, which is hydrolysed to hydroxylammonium sulfate. Most of the hydroxylamine produced is used in the manufacture of caprolactam, the precursor to the polymer Nylon 6.

The commercially used Raschig process consists of the following steps:
*ammonium carbonate solution is prepared by reacting ammonia, carbon dioxide and water
*an alkaline solution of ammonium nitrite is formed by reacting ammonium carbonate solution with nitrogen oxides
*ammonium nitrite is converted to hydroxylamine disulfonate with sulfur dioxide
*hydroxylamine disulfonate is hydrolysed to hydroxylammonium sulfate

<text>The brothers Bernhard Abel and Arnold Abel were sculptors and Florian Abel a painter in the middle of the 16th century. 

In 1561, Bernhard and Arnold worked for the Imperial Court in Vienna. On 28 April, they signed a contract on the completion of the unfinished tomb of Emperor Maximilian I in the court chapel of Innsbruck. 

Florian, residing in Prague, provided the sketches for the reliefs. Bernhard travelled to Salzburg to purchase marble, Arnold to Italy with the same purpose and to study the old masters. In December, the two sculptors reunited in Innsbruck, but did not further their work, even though they were provided with all that was necessary from the government and had received the drafts from Florian.

In 1562, they had only accomplished &quot;the fourth part of a history&quot;. Due to their excessive lifestyles, they fell critically ill. They were provided with helpers, sent by sculptor Marx Müller from Antwerp: Franz Willems, Hans Ernhofer and Michael von der Vecken. Bernhard died at the end of December 1563 or beginning of January 1564. Arnold followed in February. 

Their work was finished by Alexander Collin, a sculptor from Mechelen in the province of Antwerp. According to his report, the two brothers had only begun with three of the reliefs, but finished none. Collin continued to work after the sketches from Florian Abel.

<doc id="749839" wikidata="Q113339" url="?curid=749839" title="Tizer">
<text>Tizer is a red-coloured, citrus-flavoured soft drink bottled and sold in the UK. The name originally comes from the original name, &quot;Pickup&#x27;s Appetiser&quot;. It was launched in 1924 by Fred and Tom Pickup of Birtle, Bury when it was known as &quot;Pickup&#x27;s Appetiser&quot;.

==History==
After the death of the Pickup brothers it was owned by the Armour Trust before being sold to the Scottish drinks company A.G. Barr plc for £2.5 million in 1972. As is the case with Barr&#x27;s other famous drink Irn-Bru, Tizer&#x27;s exact recipe has not been made public, although a list of ingredients and nutritional data is given on the product&#x27;s packaging. In 2003, Tizer decided to sell other-flavoured versions of Tizer, such as &quot;Purple&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; versions. There was also a brief &quot;fruitz&quot; variation of Tizer in 2004. From 1996 to 2007, Tizer was stylised as T!zer.

In 2007, the company stopped using the &quot;Ed the Head&quot; mascot. Tizer was re-branded with the slogan &quot;Original Great Taste&quot; and a classic recipe with fewer additives and no E numbers. It was also given classic 1976 style packaging. However, despite the relaunch&#x27;s focus of the addition of real fruit juice and the absence of artificial flavourings, colourings and sweeteners, in 2009 the recipe was returned to the original to remove the real fruit juice and reintroduce artificial flavourings, artificial colours and sweeteners (Acesulfame-K). Tizer was rebranded in 2011 with a new logo and the slogan &quot;The Great British Pop&quot;.

== Tizer Ice ==
Tizer Ice was launched in the late 1990s. The drink included menthol, giving it the sensation of tasting cold, even at room temperature. Later branded &quot;Ice by Tizer&quot;, the product did not sell well and was removed from sale. Whilst known as Tizer Ice, the mascot of the drink was a variation of Ed the Tizer Head. Its sole video advertisement which was shown in cinemas featured a character known as the &quot;Iceman&quot;.

A 1999 print advertisement which showed children with their faces pressed against a glass surface with the slogan &quot;How many kids can you get in your fridge?&quot; was criticised as &quot;inappropriate&quot; by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, which had recorded deaths of children trapped inside refrigerators.

== Tizer Diet ==
Tizer Diet was a short-lived low-calorie alternative to Tizer, originally sold in the late 1980s when known as Sugar Free Tizer, and again from 1997 to 2001 as Tizer Diet. Its 2001 advertising campaign included a bus shelter advertisement in the form of a funhouse mirror bearing the Tizer Diet logo, designed to make the viewer appear thinner.

== Promotion==
===Branding and packaging===
In 1996, Tizer was rebranded, and the cans and bottles were redesigned to feature a new logo and a mascot, known as &quot;Tizer Head&quot; and later &quot;Ed the Head&quot;. Ed appeared as a red-coloured human head, the top of which was opened so that Tizer could be poured in. Ed was played by actor Roger Moore&#x27;s son.

A campaign for Tizer from 2001 saw the brand package four bottles of the drink in blue lunchboxes. This was inspired by the Tango lunchbox in 2000.

As part of a rebranding process in 2003, the cans were changed to red and Ed the Head&#x27;s expression was changed to a smile. The ads featured a chef battling a lobster, a troop of gorillas and monkeys drawn in the style of the Gorillaz artwork. In 2004, Tizer aired a campaign depicting a red chameleon remaining the same colour despite a number of different coloured backgrounds—the campaign&#x27;s slogan was &quot;No, we&#x27;re not changing colour.&quot;

===Fan club===
A Tizer fan club for United Kingdom based consumers was launched in July 1991. The fan club was advertised in teenage magazines such as &quot;Smash Hits&quot; and cost £3.00 to join. In return the fan club member received a membership card and Tizer merchandise including a folder, stickers and Tizer branded wraparound sunglasses. The fan club was discontinued around 1993.

===Sponsorship===

In 1997, Tizer sponsored the rave event Rezerection/Rez, on the basis that the reverse of the name is &quot;Rez It&quot; (&quot;Tizer&quot; backwards). It was the main soft drink available at the events. In the same year, Tizer took over the sponsorship of &quot;The Chart Show&quot; which was a Saturday morning music chart show on the ITV network in the UK.

From 23 January 1999, Tizer was the sponsor of the newly rebranded &quot;&quot; which was the replacement for &quot;The Chart Show&quot; back in 1998.

Tizer sponsored a roller coaster in Southport called the &quot;Traumatizer&quot;. The ride was closed with the park in 2006 and relocated to Blackpool Pleasure Beach, where it became known as &quot;Infusion&quot;.

===In store and incentives===

Tizer are known for their distribution of drink fridges, both full-sized ones for restaurants, shops and cafés, and smaller &quot;mini-fridges&quot; for public sale. Their full-sized, illuminated drink fridges from 1997 to 2003 were blue, whilst 2003–2007 fridges were red. They also distribute mobile can coolers, normally for usage in shops, and vending machines.

Tizer was sold at the discontinued pizza restaurant chain, Pizzaland. In 1995, cans of Tizer offered that the specific can was &quot;worth £1 at Pizzaland&quot; when £4 or more was spent. That same year, Tizer were responsible for the &quot;£150,000 worth of hi-tech prizes&quot; competition, one of the biggest soft drink competitions at the time.

<doc id="749852" wikidata="Q749893" url="?curid=749852" title="Continuation-passing style">
<text>In functional programming, continuation-passing style (CPS) is a style of programming in which control is passed explicitly in the form of a continuation. This is contrasted with direct style, which is the usual style of programming. Gerald Jay Sussman and Guy L. Steele, Jr. coined the phrase in AI Memo 349 (1975), which sets out the first version of the Scheme programming language.
John C. Reynolds gives a detailed account of the numerous discoveries of continuations.

A function written in continuation-passing style takes an extra argument: an explicit &quot;continuation&quot;; &quot;i.e.&quot;, a function of one argument. When the CPS function has computed its result value, it &quot;returns&quot; it by calling the continuation function with this value as the argument. That means that when invoking a CPS function, the calling function is required to supply a procedure to be invoked with the subroutine&#x27;s &quot;return&quot; value. Expressing code in this form makes a number of things explicit which are implicit in direct style. These include: procedure returns, which become apparent as calls to a continuation; intermediate values, which are all given names; order of argument evaluation, which is made explicit; and tail calls, which simply call a procedure with the same continuation, unmodified, that was passed to the caller.

Programs can be automatically transformed from direct style to CPS. Functional and logic compilers often use CPS as an intermediate representation where a compiler for an imperative or procedural programming language would use static single assignment form (SSA). SSA is formally equivalent to a subset of CPS (excluding non-local control flow, which does not occur when CPS is used as intermediate representation). Functional compilers can also use A-normal form (ANF) (but only for languages requiring eager evaluation), rather than with &#x27;thunks&#x27; (described in the examples below) in CPS. CPS is used more frequently by compilers than by programmers as a local or global style.

==Examples==

In CPS, each procedure takes an extra argument representing what should be done with the result the function is calculating. This, along with a restrictive style prohibiting a variety of constructs usually available, is used to expose the semantics of programs, making them easier to analyze. This style also makes it easy to express unusual control structures, like catch/throw or other non-local transfers of control.

The key to CPS is to remember that (a) &quot;every&quot; function takes an extra argument known as its continuation, and (b) every argument in a function call must be either a variable or a lambda expression (not a more complex expression). This has the effect of turning expressions &quot;inside-out&quot; because the innermost parts of the expression must be evaluated first, thus CPS makes explicit the order of evaluation as well as the control flow. Some examples of code in direct style and the corresponding CPS appear below. These examples are written in the Scheme programming language; by convention the continuation function is represented as a parameter named &quot;codice_1&quot;:
Note that in the CPS versions, the primitives used, like codice_2 and codice_3 are themselves CPS, not direct style, so to make the above examples work in a Scheme system we would need to write these CPS versions of primitives, with for instance codice_3 defined by:

(define (*&amp; x y k)
 (k (* x y)))
 To do this in general, we might write a conversion routine:

(define (cps-prim f)
 (lambda args
 (let ((r (reverse args)))
 ((car r) (apply f
 (reverse (cdr r)))))))
(define *&amp; (cps-prim *))
(define +&amp; (cps-prim +))

In order to call a procedure written in CPS from a procedure written in direct style, it is necessary to provide a continuation that will receive the result computed by the CPS procedure. In the example above (assuming that CPS primitives have been provided), we might call codice_5.

There is some variety between compilers in the way primitive functions are provided in CPS. Above we have used the simplest convention, however sometimes Boolean primitives are provided that take two thunks to be called in the two possible cases, so the codice_6 call inside codice_7 definition above would be written instead as codice_8. Similarly, sometimes the codice_9 primitive itself is not included in CPS, and instead a function codice_10 is provided which takes three arguments: a Boolean condition and the two thunks corresponding to the two arms of the conditional.

The translations shown above show that CPS is a global transformation. The direct-style &quot;factorial&quot; takes, as might be expected, a single argument; the CPS &quot;factorial&amp;&quot; takes two: the argument and a continuation. Any function calling a CPS-ed function must either provide a new continuation or pass its own; any calls from a CPS-ed function to a non-CPS function will use implicit continuations. Thus, to ensure the total absence of a function stack, the entire program must be in CPS.

===CPS in Haskell===
In this section we will write a function codice_11 that calculates the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem. A traditional implementation of the codice_11 function looks like this:

pow2 :: Float -&gt; Float
pow2 x = x ** 2

add :: Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float
add x y = x + y

pyth :: Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float
pyth x y = sqrt (add (pow2 x) (pow2 y))
To transform the traditional function to CPS, we need to change its signature. The function will get another argument of function type, and its return type depends on that function:

pow2&#x27; :: Float -&gt; (Float -&gt; a) -&gt; a
pow2&#x27; x cont = cont (x ** 2)

add&#x27; :: Float -&gt; Float -&gt; (Float -&gt; a) -&gt; a
add&#x27; x y cont = cont (x + y)

-- Types a -&gt; (b -&gt; c) and a -&gt; b -&gt; c are equivalent, so CPS function
-- may be viewed as a higher order function
sqrt&#x27; :: Float -&gt; ((Float -&gt; a) -&gt; a)
sqrt&#x27; x = \cont -&gt; cont (sqrt x)

pyth&#x27; :: Float -&gt; Float -&gt; (Float -&gt; a) -&gt; a
pyth&#x27; x y cont = pow2&#x27; x (\x2 -&gt; pow2&#x27; y (\y2 -&gt; add&#x27; x2 y2 (\anb -&gt; sqrt&#x27; anb cont)))
First we calculate the square of &quot;a&quot; in codice_13 function and pass a lambda function as a continuation which will accept a square of &quot;a&quot; as a first argument. And so on until we reach the result of our calculations. To get the result of this function we can pass codice_14 function as a final argument which returns the value that was passed to it unchanged: codice_15.

The mtl library, which is shipped with GHC, has the module codice_16. This module provides the Cont type, which implements Monad and some other useful functions. The following snippet shows the codice_13 function using Cont:

pow2_m :: Float -&gt; Cont a Float
pow2_m a = return (a ** 2)

pyth_m :: Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Cont a Float
pyth_m a b = do
 a2 &lt;- pow2_m a
 b2 &lt;- pow2_m b
 anb &lt;- cont (add&#x27; a2 b2)
 r &lt;- cont (sqrt&#x27; anb)
 return r
Not only has the syntax become cleaner, but this type allows us to use a function codice_18 with type codice_19. This function has one argument of a function type; that function argument accepts the function too, which discards all computations going after its call. For example, let&#x27;s break the execution of the codice_11 function if at least one of its arguments is negative returning zero:

pyth_m :: Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Cont a Float
pyth_m a b = callCC $ \exitF -&gt; do -- $ sign helps to avoid parentheses: a $ b + c == a (b + c)
 when (b &lt; 0 || a &lt; 0) (exitF 0.0) -- when :: Applicative f =&gt; Bool -&gt; f () -&gt; f ()
 a2 &lt;- pow2_m a
 b2 &lt;- pow2_m b
 anb &lt;- cont (add&#x27; a2 b2)
 r &lt;- cont (sqrt&#x27; anb)
 return r
===Continuations as objects===
Programming with continuations can also be useful when a caller does not want to wait until the callee completes. For example, in user-interface (UI) programming, a routine can set up dialog box fields and pass these, along with a continuation function, to the UI framework. This call returns right away, allowing the application code to continue while the user interacts with the dialog box. Once the user presses the &quot;OK&quot; button, the framework calls the continuation function with the updated fields. Although this style of coding uses continuations, it is not full CPS.
function confirmName() {
 fields.name = name;
 framework.Show_dialog_box(fields, confirmNameContinuation);

function confirmNameContinuation(fields) {
 name = fields.name;

A similar idea can be used when the function must run in a different thread or on a different processor. The framework can execute the called function in a worker thread, then call the continuation function in the original thread with the worker&#x27;s results. This is in Java 8 using the Swing UI framework:
void buttonHandler() {
 // This is executing in the Swing UI thread.
 // We can access UI widgets here to get query parameters.
 int parameter = getField();

 new Thread(() -&gt; {
 // This code runs in a separate thread.
 // We can do things like access a database or a 
 // blocking resource like the network to get data.
 int result = lookup(parameter);

 javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -&gt; {
 // This code runs in the UI thread and can use
 // the fetched data to fill in UI widgets.
 setField(result);
 }).start();


==Tail calls==
Every call in CPS is a tail call, and the continuation is explicitly passed. Using CPS without tail call optimization (TCO) will cause not only the constructed continuation to potentially grow during recursion, but also the call stack. This is usually undesirable, but has been used in interesting ways—see the Chicken Scheme compiler. As CPS and TCO eliminate the concept of an implicit function return, their combined use can eliminate the need for a run-time stack. Several compilers and interpreters for functional programming languages use this ability in novel ways.

==Use and implementation==
Continuation passing style can be used to implement continuations and control flow operators in a functional language that does not feature first-class continuations but does have first-class functions and tail-call optimization. Without tail-call optimization, techniques such as trampolining, i.e. using a loop that iteratively invokes thunk-returning functions, can be used; without first-class functions, it is even possible to convert tail calls into just gotos in such a loop.

Writing code in CPS, while not impossible, is often error-prone. There are various translations, usually defined as one- or two-pass conversions of pure lambda calculus, which convert direct style expressions into CPS expressions. Writing in trampolined style, however, is extremely difficult; when used, it is usually the target of some sort of transformation, such as compilation.

Functions using more than one continuation can be defined to capture various control flow paradigms, for example (in Scheme):

(define (/&amp; x y ok err)
 (=&amp; y 0.0 (lambda (b)
 (if b
 (err (list &quot;div by zero!&quot; x y))
 (ok (/ x y))))))
It is of note that CPS transform is conceptually a Yoneda embedding. It is also similar to the embedding of lambda calculus in π-calculus.

==Use in other fields==
Outside of computer science, CPS is of more general interest as an alternative to the conventional method of composing simple expressions into complex expressions. For example, within linguistic semantics, Chris Barker and his collaborators have suggested that specifying the denotations of sentences using CPS might explain certain phenomena in natural language.

In mathematics, the Curry–Howard isomorphism between computer programs and mathematical proofs relates continuation-passing style translation to a variation of double-negation embeddings of classical logic into intuitionistic (constructive) logic. Unlike the regular double-negation translation, which maps atomic propositions &quot;p&quot; to ((&quot;p&quot; → ⊥) → ⊥), the continuation passing style replaces ⊥ by the type of the final expression. Accordingly, the result is obtained by passing the identity function as a continuation to the CPS expression, as in the above example.

Classical logic itself relates to manipulating the continuation of programs directly, as in Scheme&#x27;s call-with-current-continuation control operator, an observation due to Tim Griffin (using the closely related C control operator).

<text>The fovea centralis is a small, central pit composed of closely packed cones in the eye. It is located in the center of the &quot;macula lutea&quot; of the retina.

The &quot;fovea&quot; is responsible for sharp central vision (also called foveal vision), which is necessary in humans for activities for which visual detail is of primary importance, such as reading and driving. The fovea is surrounded by the &quot;parafovea&quot; belt and the &quot;perifovea&quot; outer region.

The &quot;parafovea&quot; is the intermediate belt, where the ganglion cell layer is composed of more than five layers of cells, as well as the highest density of cones; the &quot;perifovea&quot; is the outermost region where the ganglion cell layer contains two to four layers of cells, and is where visual acuity is below the optimum. The &quot;perifovea&quot; contains an even more diminished density of cones, having 12 per 100 micrometres versus 50 per 100 micrometres in the most central &quot;fovea&quot;. That, in turn, is surrounded by a larger peripheral area, which delivers highly compressed information of low resolution following the pattern of compression in foveated imaging.

Approximately half the nerve fibers in the optic nerve carry information from the &quot;fovea&quot;, while the remaining half carry information from the rest of the retina. The &quot;parafovea&quot; extends to a radius of 1.25 mm from the central fovea, and the &quot;perifovea&quot; is found at a 2.75 mm radius from the &quot;fovea centralis&quot;.

The term &quot;fovea&quot; comes .

The &quot;fovea centralis&quot; was named by German histologist Carl Bergmann.

==Structure==
The fovea is a depression in the inner retinal surface, about 1.5 mm wide, the photoreceptor layer of which is entirely cones and which is specialized for maximum visual acuity. Within the fovea is a region of 0.5mm diameter called the foveal avascular zone (an area without any blood vessels). This allows the light to be sensed without any dispersion or loss. This anatomy is responsible for the depression in the center of the fovea. The foveal pit is surrounded by the foveal rim that contains the neurons displaced from the pit. This is the thickest part of the retina.

The fovea is located in a small avascular zone and receives most of its oxygen from the vessels in the choroid, which is across the retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch&#x27;s membrane. The high spatial density of cones along with the absence of blood vessels at the fovea accounts for the high visual acuity capability at the fovea.

The center of the fovea is the foveola – about 0.35 mm in diameter – or central pit where only cone photoreceptors are present and there are virtually no rods. The central fovea consists of very compact cones, thinner and more rod-like in appearance than cones elsewhere. These cones are very densely packed (in a hexagonal pattern). Starting at the outskirts of the fovea, however, rods gradually appear, and the absolute density of cone receptors progressively decreases.

In 2018, the anatomy of the foveola was reinvestigated, and it was discovered that outer segments from the central foveolar cones of monkeys are not straight and twice as long as those from the parafovea.

===Size===
The size of the fovea is relatively small with regard to the rest of the retina. However, it is the only area in the retina where 20/20 vision is attainable, and is the area where fine detail and colour can be distinguished.

==Function==

In the primate fovea (including humans) the ratios of ganglion cells to photoreceptors is about 2.5; almost every ganglion cell receives data from a single cone, and each cone feeds onto between one and 3 ganglion cells. Therefore, the acuity of foveal vision is limited only by the density of the cone mosaic, and the fovea is the area of the eye with the highest sensitivity to fine details. Cones in the central fovea express opsins that are sensitive to green and red light. These cones are the &#x27;midget&#x27; pathways that also underpin high acuity functions of the fovea.

The fovea is employed for accurate vision in the direction where it is pointed. It comprises less than 1% of retinal size but takes up over 50% of the visual cortex in the brain. The fovea sees only the central two degrees of the visual field, (approximately twice the width of your thumbnail at arm&#x27;s length). If an object is large and thus covers a large angle, the eyes must constantly shift their gaze to subsequently bring different portions of the image into the fovea (as in reading). Foveal fixation is also considered as a overt form of attention which allows to focus sensory processing resources on the most relevant sources of information. Also, foveated vision may allow speeding up learning of specific visual tasks by disregarding not relevant context and focusing on the relevant information only with lower dimensionality.
Since the fovea does not have rods, it is not sensitive to dim lighting. Hence, in order to observe dim stars, astronomers use averted vision, looking out of the side of their eyes where the density of rods is greater, and hence dim objects are more easily visible.

The fovea has a high concentration of the yellow carotenoid pigments lutein and zeaxanthin. They are concentrated in the &quot;Henle fiber layer&quot; (photoreceptor axons that go radially outward from the fovea) and to a lesser extent in the cones. They are believed to play a protective role against the effects of high intensities of blue light which can damage the sensitive cones. The pigments also enhance the acuity of the fovea by reducing the sensitivity of the fovea to short wavelengths and counteracting the effect of chromatic aberration. This is also accompanied by a lower density of blue cones at the center of the fovea. The maximum density of blue cones occurs in a ring about the fovea. Consequently, the maximum acuity for blue light is lower than that of other colours and occurs approximately 1° off center.

===Angular size of foveal cones===
On average, each square millimeter (mm) of the fovea contains approximately 147,000 cone cells, or cones per millimeter. The average focal length of the eye, i.e. the distance between the lens and fovea, is 17.1 mm. From these values, one can calculate the average angle of view of a single sensor (cone cell), which is approximately arc seconds.

The following is a table of pixel densities required at various distances so that there is one pixel per 31.5 arc seconds:
Peak cone density varies highly between individuals, such that peak values below 100,000 cones/mm and above 324,000 cones/mm are not uncommon. Assuming average focal lengths, this suggests that individuals with both high cone densities and perfect optics may resolve pixels with an angular size of arc seconds, requiring PPI values at least times those shown above in order for images not to appear pixelated.

It is worth noting that individuals with 20/20 (6/6 m) vision, defined as the ability to discern a 5x5 pixel letter that has an angular size of 5 arc minutes, cannot see pixels smaller than 60 arc seconds. In order to resolve a pixel the size of 31.5 and 21.2 arc seconds, an individual would need 20/10.5 (6/3.1 m) and 20/7.1 (6/2.1 m) vision, respectively. To find the PPI values discernible at 20/20, simply divide the values in the above table by the visual acuity ratio (e.g. 96 PPI / (20/10.5 vision) = 50.4 PPI for 20/20 vision).

===Entoptic effects in the fovea===
The presence of the pigment in the radially arranged axons of the Henle fiber layer causes it to be dichroic and birefringent to blue light. This effect is visible through the Haidinger&#x27;s brush when the fovea is pointed to a polarized light source.

The combined effects of the macular pigment and the distribution of short wavelength cones results in the fovea having a lower sensitivity to blue light (blue light scotoma). Though this is not visible under normal circumstances due to &quot;filling in&quot; of information by the brain, under certain patterns of blue light illumination, a dark spot is visible at the point of focus. Also, if mixture of red and blue light is viewed (by viewing white light through a dichroic filter), the point of foveal focus will have a central red spot surrounded by a few red fringes. This is called the Maxwell&#x27;s spot after James Clerk Maxwell who discovered it.

===Bifoveal fixation===
In binocular vision, the two eyes converge to enable bifoveal fixation, which is necessary for achieving high stereoacuity.

In contrast, in a condition known as anomalous retinal correspondence, the brain associates the fovea of one eye with an extrafoveal area of the other eye.

==Other animals==
The fovea is also a pit in the surface of the retinas of many types of fish, reptiles, and birds. Among mammals, it is found in its most developed form only in Haplorhine primates, although a more rudimentary fovea-like structure exists in some diurnal lemurs. The retinal fovea takes slightly different forms in different types of animals. For example, in primates, cone photoreceptors line the base of the foveal pit, the cells that elsewhere in the retina form more superficial layers having been displaced away from the foveal region during late fetal and early postnatal life. Other foveae may show only a reduced thickness in the inner cell layers, rather than an almost complete absence.

Most birds have a single fovea, but hawks, swallows, and hummingbirds have a double fovea. The second is called the temporal fovea, which enables them to track slow movements. The density of cones in a typical bird&#x27;s fovea has 400,000 cones per square millimeter, but some birds can reach a density of 1,000,000 cones per square millimeter (e.g., Common Buzzard).

<doc id="749860" wikidata="Q161334" url="?curid=749860" title="Klaipėda Region">
<text>The Klaipėda Region () or Memel Territory ( or &quot;Memelgebiet&quot;) was defined by the 1919 Treaty of Versailles in 1920 and refers to the northernmost part of the German province of East Prussia, when, as Memelland, it was put under the administration of the Entente&#x27;s Council of Ambassadors. The Memel Territory, together with other areas severed from Germany (the Saar and Danzig), was to remain under the control of the League of Nations until a future date, when the people of these regions would be allowed to vote on whether the land would return to Germany or not. Today, the former Memel Territory is controlled by Lithuania as part of Klaipėda and Tauragė counties.

==Historical overview==
In 1226, Duke Konrad I of Masovia requested assistance against the Prussians and other Baltic tribes, including the Skalvians who lived along the Neman (Memel) River. In March 1226, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II issued the Golden Bull of Rimini, which provided that the Teutonic Knights would possess lands taken beyond the Masovian border in exchange for securing Masovia. After uprisings of the Baltic Prussian tribes in 1242 through 1274 failed, the Order conquered many remaining western Balts in Lithuania Minor, including the Skalvians, Nadruvians, and Yotvingians. In 1252, the Order constructed Memel Castle where the Dangė river flows into the Neman, at the north end of the Curonian Spit. In 1422, after centuries of conflict, the Order and the Polish–Lithuanian union signed the Treaty of Melno which defined a border between Prussia and Lithuania. Although Grand Duke Vytautas of Lithuania wanted the border to be coextensive with the Neman River, the treaty border started north of Memelberg and ran southeasterly to the Neman. This border remained until 1918. After the Treaty of Melno was signed, many Lithuanians returned to northeastern Prussia, which became known as Lithuania Minor in the 16th century.

After World War I ended in 1918, the Klaipėda Region was defined as a roughly triangular wedge, with the northern border being the Treaty of Melno border, the southern border following the Neman River, and on the west abutting the Baltic Sea. In 1923, fearing that the western powers would create a free state, Lithuanians took control of the region and, as part of larger regional negotiations, incorporated the region into the State of Lithuania. In March 1939, Lithuania acquiesced to Nazi demands and transferred the Klaipėda Region to Germany. As World War II came to an end in 1945, the Soviet Union incorporated the region into the Lithuanian SSR. Since 1990, the area of the Klaipėda Region has formed part of the independent Republic of Lithuania, as part of Klaipėda and Tauragė counties. The southern border established by the Treaty of Versailles defines the current international boundary between Lithuania and the Kaliningrad Oblast of the Russian Federation.

==Timeline==

==Treaty of Versailles==

The eastern boundaries of Prussia (from 1871, part of the German Empire), having remained unchanged since the Treaty of Melno in 1422, became a matter of discussion following World War I as the newly independent states of Poland and Lithuania emerged. The separatist Act of Tilsit was signed by a few pro-Lithuanian-oriented Prussian Lithuanians in 1918, demanding the unification of Prussian Lithuania with Lithuania proper. It is traditionally viewed by Lithuanians as expressing the desire of Lithuania Minor to unite with Lithuania, but the majority of Prussian Lithuanians did not want to join with Lithuania, and the Prussian Lithuanians, at 26.6% of the population, did not make up a majority of the region.

The division of Prussia was also promoted by Poland&#x27;s Roman Dmowski in Versailles who acted on the orders of Józef Piłsudski. The purpose was to give the lower part of the Neman River and its delta, which was located in Germany and called the Memel River, to Lithuania, as this would provide her access to the Baltic Sea, while Lithuania itself should be part of Poland. These ideas were supported by the French prime minister, Georges Clemenceau.

In 1920, according to the Treaty of Versailles, the German area north of the Memel river was given the status of &quot;Territoire de Memel&quot; under the administration of the Council of Ambassadors, and French troops were sent for protection. The German delegation at the Paris Peace Conference, under the leadership of Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau immediately protested this decision, stating on 9 May 1919:
 [Memellanders] including those whose mother-tongue is Lithuanian, have never desired a separation from Germany;...they have always proved themselves a loyal constituent part of the German community...moreover, Memel is an entirely German town...which has never in its whole history belonged to Lithuania or to Poland.

To this claim, the Allied Powers responded the following:
The Allied and associated Powers reject the suggestion that the cession of the district of Memel conflicts with the principles of nationality. The district in question has always been Lithuanian; the majority of the populace is Lithuanian in origin and in speech and that fact the city of Memel itself is in large parts German is no justification for maintaining the district under German sovereignty, particularly from the view of the fact that the port of Memel is the only sea outlet for Lithuania

Following the evacuation of German troops from Memel, the French took over the temporary military administration of the region on 15 February 1920, under the leadership of General Dominique Odry. This was supplemented by a civilian one headed by Gabriel Jean Petisné in 1921. The French Administration proved problematic, as they were accused by the Lithuanian population of siding too closely with the pro-German Landes Directorium and then subsequently accused of siding with Polish civilian and military representatives. As a result of this backlash, Odry left his post shortly after coming to Memel and handed the responsibility of the administration over to High Commissioner Gabriel Jean Petisné. During the period of French administration, the idea of an independent state of Memelland grew in popularity among local inhabitants. The organisation &quot;Deutsch-Litauischer Heimatbund&quot; (German-Lithuanian homeland federation) promoted the idea of a &quot;Freistaat Memelland&quot;, which later should return to Germany. It had 30,000 members, both ethnic Germans and Lithuanians, or about 21% of the total population.

==Lithuanian takeover==

On 9 January 1923, three years after the Versailles Treaty had become effective, Lithuania occupied the territory during the Klaipėda Revolt, mainly by militias that had entered the region from Lithuania. At the same time, France had started the Occupation of the Ruhr in Germany, and the French administration in Memel did not take any significant counteractive measures against the rebels. On 19 January, the territory was annexed by Lithuania, and the &quot;fait accompli&quot; was eventually confirmed by the Council of Ambassadors in 1924.

==Autonomous region within Lithuania==
In the Klaipėda Convention, signed by the Council of Ambassadors and Lithuania, the area was granted a separate parliament, two official languages, the capacity to raise its own taxes, charge custom duties, and manage its cultural and religious affairs, and was allowed a separate judicial system, separate citizenship, internal control of agriculture and forestry, as well as a separate social security system. The Council of Ambassadors accepted the resulting arrangement and confirmed the autonomy of the region within the Republic of Lithuania. On 8 May 1924, a further Convention on the Klaipėda region confirmed the annexation, and a resulting autonomy agreement was signed in Paris. In the Lithuanian-German Arbitration and Settlement Agreement () of 29 January 1928, the Republic of Lithuania and the Weimar Republic agreed &quot;as a sign of the friendly nature of their relations&quot; to conclude, among other items, a border settlement agreement that included the status of the Memel Territory.

Importantly, the annexation gave Lithuania control of a year-round, ice-free Baltic port. Lithuania made full use of Klaipėda&#x27;s port, modernizing and adapting it largely for its agricultural exports. The port reconstruction was certainly one of the larger long-term investment projects enacted by the government of Lithuania in the interwar period.

The inhabitants of the area were not given a choice on the ballot as to whether they wanted to be part of the Lithuanian state or part of Germany. Since the pro-German political parties had an overall majority of more than 80% in all elections to the local parliament (see election statistics below) in the interwar period, there can be little doubt that such a referendum would have been in favour of Germany. In fact, the area had been annexed from Lithuanian kingdom to the monastic state since the 13th century, and even many Lithuanian-speakers, regarding themselves as East Prussians, declared themselves &quot;Memellanders/Klaipėdiškiai&quot; in the official census (see below for demographic information) and did not want to belong to a Lithuanian national state due to strong Germanisation in the late 1800s. According to the Lithuanian point of view, Memellanders were viewed as Germanized Lithuanians who should be re-Lithuanized.

There was also a strong denominational difference since about 95% of the inhabitants of Lithuania Minor were Lutherans while more than 90% of Greater Lithuanians were Catholics. Following the &quot;Agreement concerning the Evangelical Church of the Klaipėda Region&quot; () of 23 July 1925, concluded between the Directorate of the Klaipėda Region and the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union, a church of united administration of Lutheran and Reformed congregations, the mostly Lutheran congregations (and a single Reformed one in Klaipėda) in the Klaipėda Region were disentangled from the old-Prussian &quot;Ecclesiastical Province of East Prussia&quot; and formed the Regional Synodal Federation of the Memel Territory (Landessynodalverband Memelgebiet) since, being ranked an old-Prussian ecclesiastical province of its own. An own consistory in Klaipėda was established in 1927, led by a general superintendent (at first F. Gregor, elected in 1927, succeeded by O. Obereiniger, elected by the regional synod in 1933). The Catholic parishes in the Klaipėda Region used to belong to the Bishopric of Ermland until 1926 and were then disentangled, forming the new Territorial Prelature of Klaipėda under Prelate Justinas Staugaitis.

The government of Lithuania faced considerable opposition from the region&#x27;s autonomous institutions, among them the Parliament of the Klaipėda Region. As the years passed, claims were becoming more and more vocal about a re-integration into a resurgent Germany. It was only during the latter period that Lithuania then instituted a policy of &quot;Lithuanization&quot;. This was met by even more opposition, as religious and regional differences slowly became insurmountable.

After the December 1926 coup d&#x27;état, Antanas Smetona came to power. As the status of the Memel Territory was regulated by international treaties, the Memel Territory became an oasis of democracy in Lithuania. Lithuanian intelligentsia often held marriages in Memel/Klaipėda, since Memel Territory was the only place in Lithuania where civil marriage was in use, in the rest of Lithuania only church marriages were legitimized. Thus, Lithuanian opposition to Smetona&#x27;s regime was also based in Memel Territory.

At the start of the 1930s, certain leaders and members of pro-Nazi organizations in the region were put on trial by Lithuania &quot;for crimes of terrorism&quot;. The 1934–5 trial of Neumann and Sass in Kaunas can be presented as the first anti-Nazi trial in Europe. Three members of the organizations were sentenced to death, and their leaders imprisoned. Following political and economic pressure from Germany, most were later released.

===Election results for the local parliament===
The local parliament had 29 seats, one for every 5,000 inhabitants. Men and women over the age of 23 had the right to vote.

==Demographics==

A Lithuanian census carried out in the region in 1925 found its total population was 141,000. Declared language was used to classify the inhabitants, and on this basis 43.5 percent were German, 27.6 percent were Lithuanian, and 25.2 percent were &quot;Klaipėdan&quot; (&quot;Memeländisch&quot;). Other sources give the interwar ethnic composition as 41.9 percent German, 27.1 percent Memeländisch, and 26.6 percent Lithuanian.

Overall, Prussian Lithuanians were more rural than Germans; the number of Lithuanian speakers in the city of Klaipėda itself increased over time due to urbanization and migration from villages into cities and later also from remaining Lithuania (in the city of Klaipėda, Lithuanian-speaking people made up 21.5% in 1912, 32.6% in 1925, and 38.7% in 1932*). Foreign citizens might include some Germans who opted for German citizenship instead of Lithuanian (although at the time the German government pressured local Germans to take Lithuanian citizenship so that German presence would remain). There were more Lithuanian speakers in the north of the region (Klaipėdos apskritis and Šilutės apskritis) than in the south (Pagėgių apskritis). Other locals included people of other nationalities who had citizenship in Lithuania, such as Jews.

In the 1930s, a novel by local author Ieva Simonaitytė based on family history illustrated the centuries-old German–Lithuanian relations in the region.
The authoritarian regime of Smetona enforced a policy of discrimination and Lithuanisation: it sent administrators from Lithuania, and German teachers, officials, and priests were fired from jobs. Local inhabitants—both Germans and Prussian Lithuanians—were not accepted for state service in Memel Territory. People were sent from Kaunas instead.

Until 1938, no governor was appointed from local Prussian Lithuanians. This policy led the Prussian Lithuanian intelligentsia and some local Germans to organise a society in 1934 to oppose Lithuanian rule. This group was soon dismantled.

Election results in Memel Territory were irritating for the authoritarian Smetona regime, and it attempted to &quot;colonise&quot; Memel Territory with Lithuanians. The Lithuanian settlements Jakai and Smeltė were built. The number of newcomers increased: in 1926 the number was 5,000, in 1939–30,000.

Lithuania introduced a hard-line Lithuanisation campaign that led to even deeper antagonism between local Prussian Lithuanians, Memellanders, Germans and newcomers.

==German ultimatum==
By late 1938, Lithuania had lost control of the situation in the Territory. In the early hours of 23 March 1939, after an oral ultimatum had caused a Lithuanian delegation to travel to Berlin, the Lithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Juozas Urbšys and his German counterpart Joachim von Ribbentrop signed the &quot;Treaty of the Cession of the Memel Territory to Germany&quot; in exchange for a Lithuanian Free Zone for 99 years in the port of Memel, using the facilities erected in previous years.

Hitler had anticipated this aboard a Kriegsmarine naval ship and at dawn sailed into Memel to celebrate the return &quot;heim ins Reich&quot; of the Memelland. This proved to be the last of a series of bloodless annexations of territories separated from the German or Austrian Empire by the Treaty of Versailles, which had been perceived by many Germans as a humiliation. German forces seized the territory even before the official Lithuanian ratification. The United Kingdom and France, as after the revolt of 1923, took no action. It was under these conditions that the Seimas was forced to approve the treaty, hoping that Germany would not press any other territorial demands upon Lithuania.

Still, the reunion with Germany was welcomed by the majority of the population, both by Germans and by Memelanders.

According to the treaty, the citizens of the Memel Territory were allowed to choose their citizenship: either German or Lithuanian. 303 people or, counting family members, 585, asked for Lithuanian citizenship but only 20 requests were granted. Another term stated that persons who had settled in the Memel Territory during the occupation period from 1923 to 1939 should emigrate. About 8,900 Lithuanians did so. At the same time, Germany expelled about 1,300 local Memel and Lithuanian Jews and about 40 Prussian Lithuanians.

==World War II and after==

After Nazi Germany took over the area in 1939, many Lithuanians and their organizations began leaving Memel and the surrounding area. Memel was quickly turned into a fortified naval base by the Germans. After the failure of the German invasion of the USSR the fate of East Prussia and Memel was sealed. By October 1944, the inhabitants of the area, without ethnic distinction, had to make a decision whether to stay or leave. Nearly all of the population was evacuated from the approaching Red Army, but the city itself was defended by the German army during the Battle of Memel until 28 January 1945. After its capture, only six people were found in the city.

At the end of the war, the majority of the inhabitants had fled to the West to settle in Germany. Still, in 1945–46 there were around 35,000 local inhabitants, both Prussian Lithuanians and Germans. The government of the Lithuanian SSR sent agitators into the displaced persons camps to make promises to former inhabitants that they could return and their property would be restored. In the period of 1945–50 about 8,000 persons were repatriated. Bilingual Lithuanian-German returners were viewed as Germans.

The few remaining ethnic Germans were then forcibly expelled, with most opting to flee to what would become West Germany. People who remained in the former Memel territory were dismissed from their jobs. Families of notable local Lithuanians, who had opposed German parties before the war, were deported to Siberia. In 1951, the Lithuanian SSR expelled 3,500 people from the former Memel Territory to East Germany. In 1958, when emigration was allowed, the majority of the surviving population, both Germans and Prussian Lithuanians, emigrated to West Germany; this event was called a repatriation of Germans by the Lithuanian SSR. Today these formerly Lutheran territories are mostly inhabited by Lithuanians who are Catholic and by Orthodox Russians. However, the minority Prussian Lithuanian Protestants historically were concentrated in these regions, and some remain to this day. Only a few thousand are left. Their continued emigration is facilitated by the fact they are considered German citizens by the Federal Republic of Germany. No property restoration was performed by the Republic of Lithuania for owners prior to 1945.

Although maintaining that the Memel Territory in 1939 was re-annexed by Germany and acknowledging that Lithuania itself was occupied in 1940 by the Soviets, Lithuania, after regaining independence on 11 March 1990, did not restore autonomy to the Memel Territory.

<text>In archaeology, a celt is a long, thin, prehistoric, stone or bronze tool similar to an adze, hoe, or axe.

A shoe-last celt was a polished stone tool used during the early European Neolithic for felling trees and woodworking.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;celt&quot; seems to have come about from a copyist&#x27;s error in many medieval manuscript copies of Job 19:24 in the Latin Vulgate Bible, which became enshrined in the authoritative Sixto-Clementine printed edition of 1592. Where all earlier versions (the Codex Amiatinus, for example) have &quot;vel certe&quot; (the Latin for &#x27;but surely&#x27;), the Sixto-Clementine has &quot;vel celte&quot;. The Hebrew has לעד (&quot;lā‘aḏ&quot;) at this point, which means &#x27;forever&#x27;. The editors of the Oxford English Dictionary &quot;[incline] to the belief that &quot;celtis&quot; was a phantom word&quot;, simply a misspelling of &quot;certe&quot;. However, some scholars over the years have treated &quot;celtis&quot; as a real Latin word.

From the context of Job 19:24 (&quot;Oh, that my words were inscribed with an iron tool on lead, or engraved in rock forever!&quot;), the Latin word &quot;celte&quot; was assumed to be some kind of ancient chisel. Eighteenth-century antiquarians, such as , adopted the word for the stone and bronze tools they were finding at prehistoric sites; the &quot;OED&quot; suggests that a &quot;fancied etymological connexion&quot; with the prehistoric Celts assisted its passage into common use.

<text>Vimto is a British mixed fruit soft drink containing the juice of grapes, raspberries and blackcurrants, flavoured with herbs and spices. Originating in Manchester, northern England, it was first manufactured as a health tonic in cordial form then decades later as a carbonated drink, and the recipe was invented in 1908 by John Noel Nichols of Blackburn. Produced domestically by Nichols plc, it is available in cans and bottles in carbonated, still, cordial (squash), and energy forms and it has also been made into a sweet, ice lolly and other items. Vimto is traditionally most popular in the north of England and is also sold globally under license, and enjoys high popularity in the Persian Gulf countries and in The Gambia and Senegal.

==History==
Vimto was created in 1908 in Manchester by John Noel Nichols (1883–1966), a wholesaler of herbs, spices and medicines. He saw the market opening for soft drinks due to the temperance movement and the passage of the Licensing Act 1904. It was originally sold under the name Vim Tonic, which Nichols shortened to &#x27;Vimto&#x27; in 1912. Vimto was originally registered as a health tonic or medicine, which was then re-registered in 1913 as a cordial. 

In 1910, production moved to a warehouse at Chapel Street, Salford, then to Old Trafford in 1927, and in 1971, to a state-of-the-art plant in Wythenshawe, Manchester. In 1999, the company&#x27;s head office moved to Newton-le-Willows in St Helens, Merseyside.

From the 1990s to 2003, Vimto print advertisements used the cartoon character Purple Ronnie, along with slightly rude poems by Giles Andreae, the creator of Purple Ronnie. In 2003, Purple Ronnie was dropped, and a new creative direction was adopted, revolving around the benefits of &#x27;Shlurpling the Purple&#x27;. This, in turn, led to the launch in 2006 of Billy and his Dad&#x27;s Pants–a modern-day morality story in which, despite turning up at the swimming pool with his Dad&#x27;s pants in the middle of his rolled-up towel, Billy wins out with ingenuity and humour. The theme tune &#x27;Dad&#x27;s Pants&#x27; become something of a cult classic, and was based on the Loudon Wainwright III song &quot;Dead Skunk&quot;.

An oak sculpture entitled &quot;A Monument to Vimto&quot; was created by Kerry Morrison and installed on Granby Row–the location of the original Vimto premises–in central Manchester in 1992. The statue was restored and repainted in 2011.

In 2021 Vimto introduced a new logo design across the range.

==Manufacture==
Vimto is currently produced by Refresco (formerly Cott Corporation) in both Leicestershire and Lancashire on behalf of Vimto Soft Drinks, a division of Nichols plc. Nichols moved out of manufacturing in 2003 when it closed its final production site in Golborne. 

Vimto is also manufactured under licence in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, The Gambia, and Ghana. A &quot;Sunday Times&quot; article in 2007 claimed it to be the most popular drink during the holy month of Ramadan in some Arab countries.

The drink was also made under licence in the United Kingdom by A.G. Barr in 1996.

In 2014, the recipe for Fizzy Vimto was changed to include artificial sweeteners, Acesulfame K and Sucralose.

Ellis Wilkinson Mineral Water facilitated the production of drinks for Vimto in their early days of trading.

===Company===
A subsidiary of Nichols plc, Cabana is the distribution arm of the company, and operates via a UK-wide network of distributors that are, in the main, independent. In Scotland and Sussex, the distributor is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cabana (Scotland–Cariel, and Sussex–Beacon Drinks now closed). 

Vimto is currently available in 65 countries and the number of countries in which it is on sale is growing.

== Variations (UK market) ==
Both a still, dilutable version (&quot;Vimto Cordial&quot;) and a carbonated premixed version (&quot;Fizzy Vimto&quot;) are available in the UK. While Vimto has its origins in Northern England, it can now be found both nationally and internationally. The cordial version is more widely sold and is available in concentrate and ready-to-drink varieties. The cordial version was widely known for being suitable for vegans until Vimto decided to add vitamin D derived from sheep&#x27;s wool in April 2021.

Vimto is also available in a slush variety alongside many other different Vimto confectionery products, such as Vimto bars, lollipops, Rip Rolls, candy sprays, and Jelly Babies.

Vimto is also available in the form of an energy drink, Vimto Energy, made with natural caffeine and real fruit juice.

Vimto is also available in a summer flavour, containing ingredients such as orange and apple, both of which are cordial products. Vimto was the UK&#x27;s fastest-growing soft drinks brand by value in 2006 (as measured by Nielsen Corporation).

An alcoholic cocktail known as the Cheeky Vimto or &quot;Crazy Vimto&quot; is also drunk in the UK. However, Vimto is not an ingredient of this beverage, and the name comes from its resemblance to the original product; instead, it contains port and Blue WKD. There is also a variant of this cocktail called &quot;Dirty Vimto&quot; that replaces the port with Buckfast Tonic Wine.

Vimto is also often made as a hot beverage by simply adding boiling water to the concentrate, and is popular in this form throughout the north of England. Vimto is often made with hot water, especially during the winter months. It is also taken to sporting events in vacuum flasks by spectators as a warming drink to fend off the winter chill.

Various alternate-flavoured variants of Vimto were introduced over the years; cherry- and strawberry-flavoured variants, known as &quot;Cherry Vimto&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Vimto&quot;, have become part of the range. In 2016, a new variant, &quot;Vimto Remix&quot;, was introduced. This range consists of various alternate flavour mixes that were introduced each year – mango, strawberry and pineapple in 2016, raspberry, orange, and passionfruit in 2017, watermelon, strawberry, and peach in 2018 and strawberry, orange and lime in 2019. The &quot;Remix&quot; name was eventually dropped after the drink was rebranded in 2021, while new flavour mixes continue to be introduced.

Homemade variations include a Vimto Milkshake made by adding milk instead of water to the cordial, and a Vimto Milkshake Special involving the same with vanilla ice-cream added.

In June 2023, Vimto launched an energy drink, called Vimto Energy. It is currently available as a normal version with sugar and a sugar free (zero) version.

==Foreign markets==

In the Arabian Peninsula, Vimto has had over 80 years of dominance as the beverage of choice for the iftar or sunset feast during the Islamic holy fasting month of Ramadan. As of 2013, Aujan, the local bottler in Saudi Arabia, has been producing over 20 million bottles per year for the GCC market.
An article in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; mentioned some 15 million bottles were sold during the one-month season in 2007.In Saudi Arabia, Vimto is manufactured under licence by the Aujan Industrial Company and has a 90% market share in the cordial concentrated drinks market. Every year, the company launches aggressive marketing campaigns on Arab satellite TV channels that in recent years have become very popular, and achieved cult status with viral marketing videos exchanged on the Internet.

Vimto was introduced in India in 1924 during the colonial period. Vimto was introduced to The Gambia and Senegal in the 1980s, where it remains popular.

In 2011, Vimto once again became widely available throughout the Republic of Ireland, through Tesco and the local version of Iceland shops.

In Pakistan, Vimto is produced under licence by Mehran Bottlers.

In Nepal, Vimto is manufactured under licence by Himganga Beverage Pvt Ltd.

In Cyprus, Vimto is manufactured under license by Kean. 

In Ghana, Vimto is manufactured under licence by Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Ghana Ltd.

== Logos ==

== 2024 product recall ==
On 5 April 2024, Nichols plc recalled 500ml bottles of Vimto due to a packaging error.

The bottle stated there was no added sugar, but the bottle contains sugar.

<text>Santa Maria della Salute (; ), commonly known simply as La Salute (), is a Roman Catholic church and minor basilica located at the Punta della Dogana in the Dorsoduro sestiere of the city of Venice, Italy.

It stands on the narrow finger of Punta della Dogana, between the Grand Canal and the Giudecca Canal, at the Bacino di San Marco, making the church visible when entering the Piazza San Marco from the water. The Salute is part of the parish of the Gesuati and is the most recent of the so-called plague churches.

In 1630, Venice experienced an unusually devastating outbreak of the plague. As a votive offering for the city&#x27;s deliverance from the pestilence, the Republic of Venice vowed to build and dedicate a church to Our Lady of Health. The church was designed in the then fashionable Baroque style by Baldassare Longhena, who studied under the architect Vincenzo Scamozzi. Construction began in 1631. Most of the objects of art housed in the church bear references to the Black Death.

The dome of the &quot;Salute&quot; was an important addition to the Venice skyline and soon became emblematic of the city, appearing in artworks both by locals, such as Canaletto and Francesco Guardi, and visitors, such as J. M. W. Turner and John Singer Sargent.

==History==

Beginning in the summer of 1630, a wave of the plague assaulted Venice, and until 1631 killed nearly a third of the population. In the city, 46,000 people died whilst in the lagoons the number was far higher, some 94,000. Repeated displays of the sacrament, as well as prayers and processions to churches dedicated to San Rocco and San Lorenzo Giustiniani had failed to stem the epidemic. Echoing the architectural response to a prior assault of the plague (1575–76), when Palladio was asked to design the Redentore church, the Venetian Senate on October 22, 1630, decreed that a new church would be built. It was not to be dedicated to a mere &quot;plague&quot; or patron saint, but to the Virgin Mary, who for many reasons was thought to be a protector of the Republic.
The end of the 1630 plague was attributed to the intercession of an icon of the Virgin Mary that was brought to Venice in 1670 by sea captain Francesco Morosini as a trophy following the peace terms obtained with the Turks in the war of Candia (present-day Crete). The icon was placed in its current position inside the basilica on 21 November, the patronal feast day.


It was also decided that the Senate would visit the church each year. On November 21 the Feast of the Presentation of the Virgin, known as the &quot;Festa della Madonna della Salute&quot;, the city&#x27;s officials parade from San Marco to the Salute for a service in gratitude for deliverance from the plague is celebrated. This involved crossing the Grand Canal on a specially constructed pontoon bridge and is still a major event in Venice.

The desire to create a suitable monument at a place that allows for easy processional access from Piazza San Marco led senators to select the present site from among eight potential locations. The location was chosen partially due to its relationship to San Giorgio, San Marco, and Il Redentore, with which it forms an arc. The &quot;Salute&quot;, emblematic of the city&#x27;s piety, stands adjacent to the rusticated single story customs house or Dogana da Mar, the emblem of its maritime commerce, and near the civic center of the city. A dispute with the patriarch, owner of the church and seminary at the site, was resolved, and razing of some of the buildings began by 1631. Likely, the diplomat Paolo Sarpi and Doge Nicolo Contarini shared the intent to link the church to an order less closely associated with the patriarchate, and ultimately the Somascan Fathers, an order founded near Bergamo by a Venetian nobleman Jerome Emiliani, were invited to administer the church.

A competition was held to design the building. Of the eleven submissions (including designs by Alessandro Varotari, Matteo Ignoli, and Berteo Belli), only two were chosen for the final round. The architect Baldassare Longhena was selected to design the new church. It was finally completed in 1681 the year before Longhena&#x27;s death. The other design to make it to the final round was by Antonio Smeraldi (&quot;il Fracao&quot;) and Zambattista Rubertini. Of the proposals still extant, Belli&#x27;s and Smeraldi&#x27;s original plans were conventional counter-reformation linear churches, resembling Palladio&#x27;s Redentore and San Giorgio Maggiore, while Varotari&#x27;s was a sketchy geometrical abstraction. Longhena&#x27;s proposal was a concrete architectural plan, detailing the structure and costs. He wrote:
Later in a memorandum, he wrote: &quot;Firstly, it is a virgin work, never before seen, curious, worthy and beautiful, made in the form of a round monument that has never been seen, nor ever before invented, neither altogether, nor in part, in other churches in this most serene city, just as my competitor (&quot;il Fracao&quot;) has done for his own advantage, being poor in invention.&quot;

The Salute, while novel in many ways, still shows the influence of Palladian classicism and the domes of Venice. The Venetian Senate voted 66 in favor, 29 against with 2 abstentions to authorize the designs of the 26-year-old Longhena. While Longhena saw the structure as crown-like, the decorative circular building makes it seem more like a reliquary, a ciborium, and embroidered inverted chalice that shelters the city&#x27;s piety.

==Exterior==

The &quot;Salute&quot; is a vast, octagonal building with two domes and a pair of picturesque bell-towers at the back. Built on a platform made of 1,000,000 wooden piles, it is constructed of Istrian stone and &quot;marmorino&quot; (brick covered with marble dust). At the apex of the pediment stands a statue of the Virgin Mary who presides over the church which was erected in her honour. The façade is decorated with figures of Saint George, Saint Theodore, the Evangelists, the Prophets, Judith with the head of Holofernes.

=== Facade ===
The main facade is richly decorated by statues of the four evangelists recently attributed to Tommaso Rues:

==Interior==

While its external decoration and location capture the eye, the internal design itself is quite remarkable. The octagonal church, while ringed by a classic vocabulary, hearkens to Byzantine designs such as the Basilica of San Vitale. The interior has its architectural elements demarcated by the coloration of the material, and the central nave with its ring of saints atop a balustrade is a novel design. It is full of Marian symbolism – the great dome represents her crown, the cavernous interior her womb, the eight sides the eight points on her symbolic star.

The interior is octagonal with eight radiating chapels on the outer row. The three altars to the right of the main entrance are decorated with scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, patroness of the church, by Luca Giordano: &quot;The Presentation of Our Lady in the Temple&quot;, &quot;Assumption of Our Lady&quot;, and &quot;Nativity of Our Lady&quot;. The third altar to the left of the entrance hosts a painting by Titian titled &quot;The Descent of the Holy Ghost&quot;.
The Baroque high altar arrangement, designed by Longhena himself, shelters an iconic Byzantine &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; of the 12th or 13th century, known as &quot;Panagia Mesopantitissa&quot; in Greek (&quot;Madonna the mediator&quot; or &quot;Madonna the negotiator&quot;) and came from Candia in 1669 after the fall of the city to the Ottomans. The statuary group at the high altar, depicting &quot;The Queen of Heaven expelling the Plague&quot; (1670) is a theatrical Baroque masterpiece by the Flemish sculptor Josse de Corte. It originally held Alessandro Varotari&#x27;s painting of the Virgin holding a church that the painter submitted with his architectural proposal.

Tintoretto painted , displayed in the great sacristy, which includes a self-portrait. The most represented artist included in the church is Titian, who painted &quot;St. Mark Enthroned with Saints Cosmas, Damian, Sebastian and Roch&quot;, the altarpiece of the sacristy, as well as ceiling paintings of &quot;David and Goliath&quot;, &quot;Abraham and Isaac&quot; and &quot;Cain and Abel&quot;, and eight tondi of the eight Doctors of the Church and the Evangelists, all in the great sacristy, and &quot;Pentecost&quot; in the nave.
==Influence==
The dome of the &quot;Salute&quot; was an important addition to the Venetian skyline and soon became emblematic of the city, inspiring painters like Canaletto, J. M. W. Turner, Claude Monet, John Singer Sargent, Francesco Guardi, and the Serbian poet Laza Kostić to write a poem of the same title.

The church had a large influence on contemporary architects immediately after its completion. The structures modeled after the church include the shrine in Gostyń, built by Jerzy Catenazzi, Jan Catenazzi, and Pompeo Ferrari between 1675 and 1728, perhaps according to the original design by Baldassarre Longhena.

In 1959, the church was the subject of a design by John Piper, later adapted as a textile design by Arthur Sanderson &amp; Sons Ltd.

The plans of the Rotunda of Xewkija in Gozo, Malta were based on Santa Maria della Salute, but on a larger scale.

<doc id="749885" wikidata="Q7766717" url="?curid=749885" title="The Story Makers">
<text>The Story Makers is an educational children&#x27;s television programme that was broadcast on the BBC&#x27;s pre-school digital television network, CBeebies as well as being one of the launch programmes for the channel. &quot;The Story Makers&quot; is set in a children&#x27;s library, and encourages literacy and creativity. 

==Programme==
The programme starts as the library closes at 5pm. At the stroke of midnight, Jackson and Jelly (pink and green puppets who live in the library and hide in the daytime) come out and are joined by a presenter (one of the members of the Wordsworth family) who recites &quot;The sun is down, the stars are bright, Story Makers come out at night.” as they appear. The Wordsworths together with Jelly and Jackson are the Story Makers.

Objects found in the library or appear by magic are put into the top of the story machine (transformed from a desktop computer); Jelly, Jackson and the story maker then recite &quot;Imagine, imagine, imagine a story!&quot; and the story machine makes a book containing a story based on the object. The story in the book is then &quot;read out&quot; (although this is replaced on screen by live action or an animation). The stories that appear are a Playbook (live action segments with young children) and the remaining stories are animated (traditional animation, stop-motion animation or puppets). The characters in the stories are fairly consistent, including Sniff and Wag (two puppet dogs), Blue Cow (a cartoon cow, created by Blue Zoo Animation) and Kevin the Spaceman and his dog, Spanner (puppets). There is always a Blue Cow story and a Playbook – the other story varies between each episode.

As dawn begins and the sun rises, the Story Maker takes his or her leave and recites &quot;Dawn is upon us, the morning is nigh, we&#x27;ve made our stories and we bid you goodbye.&quot; and disappears. Jelly and Jackson hide and the story machine turns back into a computer, but the books produced overnight remain for the librarian and children to find when the library opens at 9am. From Series 2 to 4, Jelly and Jackson sometimes look at what the kids or the librarian are doing during the credits and hide to make it look like they are invisible to the humans (this never happened in Series 1).

==Characters==
===Wordsworth Family Members===
The main live action presenters are the Wordsworths:
*Milton Wordsworth – Played by Danny John-Jules (appears in every series except Series 2).
*Byron Wordsworth – Played by Michael Offei (appears in Series 2–4).
*Shelley Wordsworth – Played by Lauretta Nkwocha (appears in Series 2–4).
*Rossetti Wordsworth – Played by Dystin Johnson (appears in Series 2–4).
*Webster Wordsworth – Played by Joe Vera (appears in Series 2–4).
*Blake Wordsworth – Played by Paul J. Medford (only appears in Series 4).

In Series 1, Milton Wordsworth was the only live action presenter.

===Others===
* The Librarian (appears at the beginning and end of the programme, sometimes female, sometimes male).
* Children in the library (appear at the beginning and end of the programme except Series 1).
* Playbook children (appears in every series).
* Blue Cow – Appears in all of the episodes where she is always curious about the world outside her farm.

===Puppets===
The show also featured two puppets:
* Jackson (voiced by Nick Mercer) – A pink horse who is the adoptive big brother to Jelly. He is six years old and wears pink velcros.
* Jelly (voiced by Aliex Yuill) – A green porcupine with long quills, who is Jackson&#x27;s adopted younger sister. She is three years old.

The puppets have also appeared on &quot;CBeebies Springwatch&quot; and &quot;CBeebies Autumnwatch&quot;. Jelly was also a recurring character in &quot;Green Balloon Club&quot; (another show that aired on CBeebies).

In December 2007, Jelly &amp; Jackson appeared as contestants on a puppet special of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; hosted by Anne Robinson which was originally broadcast on Friday 28 December 2007 at 18:00pm GMT on BBC One, they were voted off after Round 6.

<text>Kevin Matthew Gilbert (also known as Matthew Delgado and Kai Gilbert; November 20, 1966 – May 18, 1996) was an American singer, songwriter, musician, composer and producer. He was best known for his solo progressive rock projects, Toy Matinee and his contributions to &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot; (1993), the debut studio album by Sheryl Crow.

== Early life ==
Kevin Matthew Gilbert was born in Sacramento, California, on November 20, 1966, later living in Scotch Plains, New Jersey and San Mateo, California, where he attended Abbott Middle School and Junipero Serra High School.

== Career ==

=== 1982–1989: Early years ===
Kevin Gilbert was an accomplished composer, singer, producer and instrumentalist who played keyboards, guitar, bass guitar, cello, and drums. In 1982, he and Jason Hubbard formed N.R.G. and in 1984 released the eponymous &quot;No Reasons Given&quot; album. Between 1984 and 1987, he self-released four albums as Kai Gilbert.

He toured with Eddie Money on his &quot;Can&#x27;t Hold Back&quot; tour in 1986-87 before entering the 1988 Yamaha International Rock Music Competition with his progressive rock group Giraffe. Although Giraffe placed second (the winner was the Australian rock band Janz), Kevin was considered the popular winner of the night. Producer Pat Leonard was impressed with Gilbert&#x27;s performance at the competition and invited him to join him and Guy Pratt in forming a new band which became Toy Matinee. During this time, Gilbert worked on the projects of several established pop musicians, including acting as producer on &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; by Madonna and &quot;Changing States&quot; by Keith Emerson, and assisting in the studio on &quot;Dangerous&quot; by Michael Jackson.

=== 1990: &quot;Toy Matinee&quot; ===
The lone Toy Matinee album was recorded throughout 1989 and released in 1990, which allowed Gilbert to find his voice as a lyricist. The band received no initial promotion or support from the record label, and did not tour due to prior commitments of most band members. Pratt joined Pink Floyd as bassist on the &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; Tour, while Leonard produced and recorded Roger Waters&#x27; &quot;Amused to Death&quot; album in London. With the other band members, guitarist Tim Pierce and drummer Brian MacLeod, already being in demand for session work, this left Gilbert as the only original Toy Matinee member who was able or willing to tour to boost album sales and make up for the debt.

Consequently, four months after the album&#x27;s release with virtually no sales, Gilbert convinced the label&#x27;s promotion department to allow him to take the album on the road. Initially he and guitarist Marc Bonilla (whom Gilbert would work extensively with in the early 1990s) toured local Los Angeles area radio stations in November of 1990, where they also established a great relationship with radio legends Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps of The Mark &amp; Brian Show. The growing resonance sparked the demand for a band to play live shows, for which they attracted bassist Spencer Campbell, drummer Toss Panos, and his soon-to-be-girlfriend keyboardist Sheryl Crow. Leonard expressed no interest in being part of an ensemble that involved replacing so many of the original members. 

The first live performance of this touring incarnation was the annual Mark and Brian Christmas Show on December 17, 1990. They then did a western U.S. concert tour in the spring of 1991. In later years, three albums featuring this band have been released: &quot;Kevin Gilbert Performs Toy Matinee Live&quot; (2010) recorded at The Roxy on May 1, 1991, and &quot;Toy Matinee Acoustic&quot; (2010) consisting of a compilation of rehearsals in 1990 and three songs recorded at the Ventura Theatre on April 21, 1991. In 2024, the latter concert was released in its entirety as &quot;Troy Manitee: Men Without Pat&quot;. The promotional tour ended because of a legal action taken by band co-founder Pat Leonard. Gilbert&#x27;s efforts resulted in the release of two successful singles, &quot;The Ballad of Jenny Ledge&quot; and &quot;Last Plane Out.&quot;

=== 1994: &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot; ===

Gilbert was invited to join the songwriting collective &quot;The Tuesday Music Club&quot; that met at producer Bill Bottrell&#x27;s studio in Pasadena, California, and which also included Toy Matinee bandmate Brian MacLeod. Gilbert had previously worked alongside Bottrell in the studio for among others Madonna and Michael Jackson. Gilbert introduced his then-girlfriend Sheryl Crow to Bottrell and his fellow Club musicians, and the sessions allowed Crow to workshop new material, leading to the recording of her breakthrough debut album, &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot;. Gilbert co-wrote many of the songs on that album, including 1995 Grammy Record of the Year &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot;. Crow later acrimoniously split with most of the musicians in the collective and only producer Bottrell and drummer MacLeod were involved in her follow-up album. Meanwhile, the remainder of the collective worked with singer-songwriters Susanna Hoffs and Linda Perry on two more albums.

=== 1995: &quot;Thud&quot; and reforming Giraffe ===

Gilbert continued to work in television and movie soundtracks (under the name Matthew Delgado), studio sessions, and production, and eventually released his first solo album, &quot;Thud&quot; (1995), as well as partially reforming Giraffe to perform the Genesis double album &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; at Progfest &#x27;94. Gilbert&#x27;s manager sent a copy of the recording to Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford, who were searching for a new frontman to replace Phil Collins. According to Dave Kerzner in a 2020 interview (who now has a relationship with Banks and was also a member of Gilbert&#x27;s band Thud and his &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; performance), the band said they were &quot;amused&quot; by the performance, but it did not progress anywhere beyond that.

===1996: Final years===
Throughout 1996, Gilbert continued recording his &quot;The Shaming of the True&quot; album (which would be completed and released in 2000 by friend and bandmate Nick D&#x27;Virgilio and producer/engineer John Cuniberti). He also began a new project with former Toy Matinee bandmate, drummer Brian MacLeod. This project was known as Kaviar. It consisted of numerous collaborators, and was notably a sonic departure from Gilbert&#x27;s previous work, consisting of darker lyrical topics and heavier musicianship. This band&#x27;s recordings were released posthumously in the form of the album entitled &quot;The Kaviar Sessions&quot; in 2002, then released again on vinyl and CD in 2022 with the new title &quot;Kaviar&quot; (which also included some bonus tracks and remastering).

On May 18, 1996, Gilbert was found dead at his home just outside of Los Angeles. The coroner listed the cause of death as &quot;asphyxia due to partial suspension hanging&quot; and concluded the death was accidental and not a suicide. This manner of death is known as autoerotic asphyxiation, and the Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s Office reports four or five such deaths a year.

===1999–2014: Posthumous releases===
Several albums of Gilbert&#x27;s music have been released posthumously, beginning in 1999 with the live album &quot;Welcome to Joytown – Thud: Live at The Troubadour&quot; (consisting primarily of songs from &quot;Thud&quot;) and a compilation of Giraffe material that he had been working on.

Gilbert&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;The Shaming of the True&quot; (2000), was also released posthumously. The album was largely incomplete, but Gilbert&#x27;s estate asked Nick D&#x27;Virgilio (a former member of Thud, the Giraffe Progfest &#x27;94 gig, Spock&#x27;s Beard drummer and close friend of Gilbert&#x27;s) and producer/engineer John Cuniberti to complete it, based upon the extant tapes and the album planning notes left by Gilbert. Following this, an &quot;industrial&quot; album of music performed by Gilbert&#x27;s group Kaviar was released in 2002. Nick D&#x27;Virgilio performed the entire &quot;The Shaming of the True&quot; album in concert twice, first at the ProgWest festival in 2002 and again at Whittier College in 2012.

In October 2009, three new works were released: &quot;Nuts&quot; and &quot;Bolts&quot; (collectively a body of mostly unreleased songs and mixes, released as two individual CD albums) and &quot;Welcome to Joytown – Thud: Live at The Troubadour&quot;, a DVD/CD which expanded on the original 1999 release. A live performance from Gilbert&#x27;s promotional group for &quot;Toy Matinee&quot; was made available in March 2010, and late 2011 saw a deluxe expanded release of &quot;The Shaming of the True&quot; with additional orchestration and engineering by Mark Hornsby. In 2012, the two Giraffe albums and 1984&#x27;s &quot;No Reasons Given&quot; were re-issued with complete re-mastering from the original analog tapes. Late 2014 saw a similar expanded release of &quot;Thud&quot; and a one-time vinyl pressing.

===Since 2021: &quot;Call Me Kai&quot;, vinyl releases, and the KMG Archive Series===
A box set of the Giraffe albums and a DVD with video footage of the band and their performances was released in early 2021, and also a vinyl release of &quot;The Shaming of the True&quot;. A 4-CD box set of Gilbert&#x27;s earlier work, &quot;Call Me Kai&quot;, was released later in the same year, along with a CD collection of cover songs Gilbert had recorded over the years.

In early 2022, &quot;The Shaming of the True&quot; received a final remastering by John Cuniberti for release on vinyl for the first time, and as CD digipak. In addition, &quot;The Best of Everything&quot; was released as a CD single, featuring the song in three versions. The album &quot;The Kaviar Sessions&quot; by Kaviar was first released on vinyl in early 2023, simply titled &quot;Kaviar&quot; and featuring new cover art consisting of only the logo, along with a similarly styled reissue as CD digipak. Original vinyl pressings of &quot;No Reasons Given&quot; by N.R.G. were also made available in 2023.

In 2022, the estate announced the KMG Archive Series, a series of twelve CD digipaks released in pairs, with a run of 300 units per title. These are aimed at fans interested in additional materials sourced from the archives that are deemed unfit to serve as official releases, such as demos, unreleased tracks, alternate mixes, live soundboard recordings, and studio rehearsal sessions. The audio recordings span all eras and most formations of Gilbert&#x27;s career.

<doc id="749888" wikidata="Q1354637" url="?curid=749888" title="Erin go bragh">
<text>Erin go Bragh ( ), sometimes Erin go Braugh, is the anglicisation of an Irish language phrase, , and is used to express allegiance to Ireland. It is most often translated as &quot;Ireland Forever.&quot;

== Origin ==
&quot;Erin go Bragh&quot; is an anglicisation of the phrase in the Irish language.

The standard version in Irish is , which is pronounced . Some uses of the phrase will use , which survives as the dative form in the modern standard form of Irish and is the source of the poetic form, &quot;Erin&quot;. 

The term is equivalent to &quot;eternity&quot; or &quot;end of time&quot;, meaning the phrase may be translated literally as &quot;Ireland until eternity&quot; or &quot;Ireland to the end (of time)&quot;. (or ) is also used in Irish and means the same thing. is a preposition, translatable as &quot;to&quot;, &quot;till/until&quot;, &quot;up to&quot;.

== Usage ==
=== United Irishmen ===
The phrase was used by the United Irishmen organisation in the 1790s.

=== Emigrant nationalism ===
In 1847, a group of Irish volunteers, including U.S. Army deserters, joined the Mexican side in the Mexican–American War. These soldiers, known as or Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion, flew as their standard a green flag with a harp and the motto &quot;Erin Go Bragh&quot;. Similar flag designs have been used at different times to express Irish nationalism.

In 1862, when a large number of families on the estate of Lord Digby, near Tullamore, County Offaly, were given notice to quit, a local priest, Father Paddy Dunne, arranged passage for 400 people to Australia. A ship was chartered from the Black Ball Line and named the &quot;Erin-go-Bragh&quot;. The voyage of the &quot;Erin-go-Bragh&quot;, a &quot;crazy, leaky tub&quot;, took 196 days, the longest recorded passage to Australia. A passenger nicknamed the ship the &quot;Erin-go-Slow&quot;, but eventually it landed in Moreton Bay near Brisbane.

A pub in Sydney, Australia, in the 19th century that catered to Irish immigrants was called &quot;The Erin-Go-Bragh&quot;.

=== Unionism ===
At the height of decades of negotiation regarding home rule in Ireland, in the late 19th century the Irish Unionist Party used the slogan on a banner at one of their conventions, expressing their pride in Irish identity.

=== Sport ===
In the late 19th century, the Edinburgh football club Hibernian F.C. adopted &quot;Erin Go Bragh&quot; as their motto and it adorned their shirts accordingly. Founded in 1875 by Edinburgh Irishmen and the local Catholic Church, St Patrick&#x27;s, the club&#x27;s shirts included a gold harp set on a green background. The flag can still be seen at a lot of Hibernian matches to this day.

In 1887, a gaelic games club was set up in Clonsilla, Dublin under the name Erin go Bragh GAA. There is also an &quot;Erin go Bragh GAA&quot; club in Warwickshire, England.

In 1906, three Irishmen went to Athens, Greece to compete in the 1906 Intercalated Olympics as an Irish team independent of Britain. They had distinct uniforms and intended to compete for the first time as representatives of their own country. Once in Athens, the Irishmen became aware that the British committee had decided that they would instead compete under the British flag. Peter O&#x27;Connor won the silver medal for the long jump. As he was about to receive his medal he rushed towards the flag pole, climbed the pole, and flew the Erin Go Bragh flag, as the Tricolour had not yet received widespread acceptance. The other Irish athletes and a number of Irish-American athletes fended off security for a few minutes while the flag was flown. It was the first time an Irish flag had been flown at a sporting event.

<text>Goldfrapp were an English electronic music duo from London, formed in 1999. The duo consisted of Alison Goldfrapp (vocals, synthesiser) and Will Gregory (synthesiser).

Despite favourable reviews and a short-listing for the Mercury Prize, their 2000 début studio album &quot;Felt Mountain&quot; did not chart highly. Goldfrapp&#x27;s second album &quot;Black Cherry&quot;, which incorporated glam rock and synth-pop sounds into their music, was released in 2003. The album&#x27;s dance-oriented sound was carried over to their third album, &quot;Supernature&quot;. &quot;Supernature&quot; took Goldfrapp&#x27;s work further into dance music, and enjoyed international chart success. The album produced three number-one US dance singles, and was nominated for Best Electronic/Dance Album at the 49th Grammy Awards.

Their fourth album &quot;Seventh Tree&quot; placed a greater emphasis on ambient and downtempo music, drawing inspiration from nature and paganism, while their fifth album, &quot;Head First&quot;, found the group exploring 1980s-influenced synth-pop. &quot;Head First&quot; also earned the duo their second Grammy Award nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album in 2010. Goldfrapp released their critically acclaimed sixth studio album, the folktronica-influenced &quot;Tales of Us&quot;, in September 2013. Goldfrapp released their seventh studio album, &quot;Silver Eye&quot;, in March 2017, which debuted at number six on the UK Albums Chart. The same position was achieved by Alison Goldfrapp&#x27;s May 2023 debut solo album &quot;The Love Invention&quot;.

The duo has been on indefinite hiatus since 2022.

==History==
===1999: Formation===
Alison Goldfrapp began her musical career performing with Dance Company Catherine Massin throughout the Netherlands during her early twenties. Afterwards, she attended Middlesex University, where she studied fine art and started creating live performance pieces. In the early 1990s, Goldfrapp served as a guest vocalist with the electronic band Orbital and trip hop artist Tricky. In 1999, she was introduced to composer Will Gregory after he listened to an early version of the song &quot;Human&quot;. Gregory and Goldfrapp felt a mutual connection and wrote the track &quot;Lovely Head&quot;. Following several months of phone calls, they decided to form a band and began performing under the name Goldfrapp.

In August 1999, Goldfrapp signed a recording contract with London-based record label Mute Records. They recorded their debut album over six months, beginning in September 1999, in a rented bungalow in the Wiltshire countryside. The recording process was difficult, as they were disturbed by the mice and insects in the bungalow.

===2000–2002: &quot;Felt Mountain&quot;===
Goldfrapp&#x27;s début album &quot;Felt Mountain&quot; was released in September 2000 and produced the singles &quot;Lovely Head&quot;, &quot;Utopia&quot;, &quot;Pilots (On a Star)&quot; and &quot;Human&quot;. It featured Alison Goldfrapp&#x27;s vocals over cinematic soundscapes and is influenced by a variety of music styles including cabaret, folk and electronic music. The album was well received by music critics, including Pitchfork Media who described its sound as &quot;simultaneously smarmy and seductive, yet elegant and graceful&quot;. It reached number 57 on the UK Albums Chart, and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry. In 2001, &quot;Felt Mountain&quot; was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize, an annual music prize awarded for the best British or Irish album from the previous year.

The lyrics on &quot;Felt Mountain&quot; were written by Alison Goldfrapp and are abstract obsessional tales inspired by films and her childhood. The song &quot;Oompa Radar&quot; was inspired by Roman Polanski&#x27;s film &quot;Cul-de-sac&quot;, while &quot;Pilots&quot; describes travellers floating in the atmosphere above the earth.

To promote &quot;Felt Mountain&quot;, Goldfrapp toured the U.K., Europe and North America, supporting the alternative music bands Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and Doves. The band found it difficult to perform songs from the album live because of their complex arrangements which required up to forty musicians. They eventually settled on performing with violinist Davide Rossi, drummer Rowan Oliver and keyboardist Andy Davies.

===2003–2004: &quot;Black Cherry&quot;===

Goldfrapp&#x27;s second album &quot;Black Cherry&quot; was released in April 2003. The band recorded the album in a darkened studio in Bath, England. The album focused more heavily on dance music and glam rock-inspired synths than its predecessor. Alison Goldfrapp commented that the album differed from &quot;Felt Mountain&quot; because the band &quot;felt that we really didn&#x27;t want to repeat what we had done...we kind of wanted to do something that felt equally as fresh to us as the first one felt fresh to us, and we wanted to put more kind of &quot;oomph&quot; in it.&quot; The album received positive reviews from critics. &quot;The Guardian&quot; found it to be an &quot;unexpected delight&quot; and About.com called it a &quot;rare electronica album of warmth and depth...the ultimate chillout pleasure&quot;. &quot;Black Cherry&quot; peaked at number 19 on the UK Albums Chart and number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Electronic Albums chart in the United States. It sold well, reaching platinum status in the UK and selling 52,000 copies in the U.S. as of August 2006.

The first single released from the album was &quot;Train&quot;, which reached number 23 on the UK Singles Chart. The song&#x27;s lyrics discuss obsession and overindulgence and were inspired by Goldfrapp&#x27;s visit to Los Angeles while touring in support of &quot;Felt Mountain&quot;. &quot;Strict Machine&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single. The song proved successful on several formats, and reached number one on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. In 2004, &quot;Strict Machine&quot; won an Ivor Novello Award for &quot;Best Dance Single&quot;. The third single released from &quot;Black Cherry&quot; was &quot;Twist&quot;, a song inspired by a fantasy that Goldfrapp had about a boy who worked in a fairground. The title track was released as the album&#x27;s fourth single and reached number 28 in the UK.

In 2003, Alison Goldfrapp modified her image, from a sophisticated Marlene Dietrich inspired look to that of a new wave diva. The reinvented image included false eyelashes, customised T-shirts, military uniforms and fishnet stockings. Starting in March 2003, the band toured the album, with a concert series entitled Black Cherry Tour. In 2004, the band further toured Australia, Japan, Europe and North America and embarked on the Wonderful Electric Tour. Sections of the stage show featured Goldfrapp in a white dress wearing a horse tail and dancers with deer heads, and were inspired by Goldfrapp&#x27;s interest in animals and mythology.

===2005–2006: &quot;Supernature&quot;===

&quot;Supernature&quot;, Goldfrapp&#x27;s third album, was released in August 2005. The album comprises pop and electronic dance music prominently featured on &quot;Black Cherry&quot;, but focuses more on subtle hooks instead of the large choruses that made up its predecessor. The band never intended to create dance music, however, previous releases were popular across nightclubs in North America and as a result, they decided to write a more dance-oriented album. &quot;Supernature&quot; débuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart and was certified platinum in the UK. As of February 2008, it had sold one million copies worldwide. The album received a Grammy Award nomination in 2007 for Best Electronic/Dance Album and &quot;Ooh La La&quot; was nominated for Best Dance Recording. The song was used for the iPhone 5S&#x27;s commercial in 2013.

&quot;Ooh La La&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single, became Goldfrapp&#x27;s first UK top five single. The song was chosen as the lead single &quot;because it was up and in your face and carried on the theme of the glammy, discoey beat from the last album&quot;. &quot;Ooh La La&quot; became the first song performed by the band to feature the electric guitar and was cited as a highlight of the album by Allmusic. &quot;Number 1&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single. Constructed around a synthesiser and bass arrangement, it was written about the importance of relationships. The album&#x27;s third single &quot;Ride a White Horse&quot; was inspired by the disco era and reached number 15 in the UK. &quot;Fly Me Away&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fourth single, but did not perform as well as its predecessors.

In 2006, Goldfrapp released &quot;We Are Glitter&quot;, a North American-only compilation of remixes from &quot;Supernature&quot;. It included a Flaming Lips remix of &quot;Satin Chic&quot;, the band&#x27;s favourite song from the album.

===2006–2008: &quot;Seventh Tree&quot;===

Goldfrapp began writing and recording their fourth album, &quot;Seventh Tree&quot;, at the end of 2006 in Bath, England; released in February 2008, it débuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart. The album is a departure from the pop and electronic-dance music featured on &quot;Supernature&quot;, and features ambient and downtempo music. The band were inspired by an acoustic radio session they had performed, which led the duo to incorporate acoustic guitars into their music to create &quot;warm&quot; and &quot;delicate&quot; sounds.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;A&amp;E&quot;, reached number ten in the UK. The single received positive reviews from critics: &quot;musicOMH&quot; found it to be &quot;a beautifully paced ballad&quot; and Digital Spy called it &quot;lush, folky and organic&quot;. &quot;Happiness&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single, reached number 25 in the UK. The third single, &quot;Caravan Girl&quot;, which describes the story of a girl that suffers from amnesia, reached number 54 in the UK.

In 2008, Alison Goldfrapp took inspiration from the character of Pierrot and English Folk. The artwork for &quot;Seventh Tree&quot; featured her dressed as a clown because it is an &quot;iconic image&quot; with &quot;so many different connotations&quot;. Goldfrapp chose to tone down her overtly sexual image because she felt that it was taking over the music. Her new image, inspired by Paganism, featured her dressed in white or natural-coloured flowing gowns with loose, curly blond hair.

===2009–2012: &quot;Head First&quot; and &quot;The Singles&quot;===
Goldfrapp&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Head First&quot;, was released in March 2010. Recorded over a six-month period, it was a return to the dance oriented sound on previous albums. The album took inspiration from 1980s pop music and bands such as Van Halen and The Pointer Sisters. Alison Goldfrapp described its sound as &quot;optimistic and vibrant.&quot; The album received positive reviews from critics, with Allmusic describing it as &quot;a love letter to the frothy, fleeting, but very vital joys of pop music.&quot; &quot;Head First&quot; peaked at number six on the UK Albums Chart and number 45 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album earned Goldfrapp a Grammy Award nomination in 2011 for Best Electronic/Dance Album and &quot;Rocket&quot; was nominated for Best Dance Recording.
The album&#x27;s first single was &quot;Rocket&quot;, a song about an unfaithful lover. Musically, &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;Spin&quot; have compared the song to &quot;Jump&quot; by American rock band Van Halen. In the US, &quot;Rocket&quot; peaked at number one on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. &quot;Alive&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single. The song&#x27;s music video featured Alison Goldfrapp as a 1980s inspired aerobics instructor who leads a group of black metal fans and vampires through a fitness routine. The album&#x27;s third single &quot;Believer&quot; featured remixes by Vince Clarke and Davide Rossi.

In February 2012, Goldfrapp released the compilation album &quot;The Singles&quot;. The album contained previously released material as well as two newly recorded songs.

===2013–2014: &quot;Tales of Us&quot;===
In mid-June, Goldfrapp announced their forthcoming sixth album, &quot;Tales of Us&quot;, to be released 9 September 2013. The album features ten tracks. All the track titles, with the exception of &quot;Stranger&quot;, are given people&#x27;s names. Goldfrapp confirmed via Twitter that the sound of the album focuses on their softer sounds similar to that of their début piece &quot;Felt Mountain&quot; as well as their 2008 release &quot;Seventh Tree&quot;. Accompanying this announcement was the re-launch of the duo&#x27;s website which features a trailer video directed by Lisa Gunning with the first dates announced for their Tales of Us Tour. &quot;Drew&quot;, the first single from the album, was released on 2 September 2013 with an accompanying film directed by Gunning, the first of five films subsequently released to promote the album. Preceding the album&#x27;s release, Goldfrapp performed the album in its entirety with a 24-piece orchestra and choir over two nights at the Manchester International Festival. &quot;Tales of Us&quot; was nominally successful upon release, charting in the top 20 in over 15 countries. In March 2014, the Tales of Us worldwide cinema event took place, featuring the full Tales of Us film and a live performance from Air Studios in London. Further singles from the album included &quot;Annabel&quot; and &quot;Stranger&quot;.

===2015–2018: &quot;Silver Eye&quot;===
In July 2015, Alison Goldfrapp announced on Twitter that the group had returned to the studio to work on music for the forthcoming seventh album, but as far as a release date she could only state it would be &quot;sometime in 2017&quot;. in December 2016 Goldfrapp posted on their Instagram page the covers of their first six studio albums. On 23 December 2016 Goldfrapp posted an image of two topless figures holding each other&#x27;s heads, with bleached blonde hair covering their faces, and a black substance slicked across their forearms, along with the hashtag #goldfrapp7. The social media upload was initially assumed to be the seventh album&#x27;s cover art. This turned out not to be the case. The title of the album was confirmed as &quot;Silver Eye&quot;. The first track to be played from the album, titled &quot;Anymore&quot;, was premiered on Lauren Laverne&#x27;s BBC 6 Music show on 23 January 2017. &quot;Silver Eye&quot; was eventually released on 31 March 2017. &quot;Silver Eye: Deluxe Edition&quot; was released on 6 July 2018. This was the original &quot;Silver Eye&quot; album with an additional eight remixes, including a collaboration with Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode on the track &quot;Ocean&quot;.

===2019–present: &quot;Felt Mountain: The 20th Year Tour&quot; and hiatus===
In November 2019, a run of six concert dates was announced for 2020 by Alison Goldfrapp on the group&#x27;s official website, in celebration of the approaching 20th anniversary of the release of the group&#x27;s debut album &quot;Felt Mountain&quot;. Goldfrapp commented that the album &quot;represents a very special period in my life. It is the first album Will and I recorded as Goldfrapp, launching us in a new musical direction, and the moment for me, after 13 years or so in music, that I found a creative direction that I was truly excited about. Being nominated for a Mercury Prize was incredible and unexpected, and an affirmation that were embarking on an important journey.&quot;

Initially scheduled to begin on 25 March 2020 at Manchester&#x27;s Albert Hall and conclude on 1 April at the De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhill-on-Sea, the tour was pushed back to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The rescheduled tour began at Oxford&#x27;s O2 Academy on 31 March 2022 and ended at the Royal Festival Hall in London on 15 April.

In September 2021, Goldfrapp were awarded the Ivor Novello inspiration award, which celebrates &quot;peer recognition for the excellence of Goldfrapp songwriting catalogue and in particular how it has inspired the creative talent of other creators&quot;.

Since 2022, the group has remained on an indefinite hiatus, with both Goldfrapp and Gregory embarking on solo projects. Regarding the group&#x27;s future, Alison Goldfrapp has stated &quot;never say never&quot; to a reunion and that &quot;we&#x27;ve had a pretty good stint together, ... Will has always had other projects in between, going off and doing his thing, and I&#x27;ve always wanted to do my thing for a long time. Everything is great, it&#x27;s all good between us, ... but neither of us has plans to make any new music together.&quot;

==Musical style==
Although Goldfrapp&#x27;s musical style has changed over time, they are considered to be an electronic music act. Goldfrapp has explored a range of musical styles in their songs, although many songs are characterised by Alison Goldfrapp&#x27;s distinctive breathy, soft soprano vocals and Will Gregory&#x27;s multi-layered synthesiser / string arrangements. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described Goldfrapp&#x27;s voice as &quot;a cross between Kylie Minogue and PJ Harvey, between Annie [Lennox] and Siouxsie Sioux, between Rachel Stevens and Beth Gibbons&quot;.

===Album style and genre progression===
The band&#x27;s sound has progressed from electronic in &quot;Felt Mountain&quot;, through synth-pop in &quot;Black Cherry&quot; to a more glam rock-influenced sound in &quot;Supernature&quot;, and to a blend of ambient, folk, and electronic sounds in &quot;Seventh Tree&quot; and a 1980s synth-pop influence in &quot;Head First&quot;. However, they have experimented with other genres of music, such as cabaret (&quot;Cologne Cerrone Houdini&quot;, &quot;Human&quot;, &quot;Oompa Radar&quot;), operatic pop (&quot;Utopia&quot; and &quot;Pilots&quot;), folktronica (&quot;A&amp;E&quot;), and trip hop (&quot;Little Bird&quot; and &quot;Lovely Head&quot;).

===Musical, cinematic, and other inspiration===
Alison Goldfrapp listened to Kate Bush, Prince, T. Rex, Donna Summer, and Iggy Pop and The Stooges as a teenager. In the early 1990s, while working in Belgium and travelling Europe, she discovered Serge Gainsbourg, 1970s Polish disco music, and Weimar cabaret. Gregory&#x27;s musical background was in classical music and he has cited Ennio Morricone as his main influence. Other media, including film, have influenced Goldfrapp; Alison Goldfrapp cites Roman Polanski&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;Cul-de-sac&quot; and the cult film &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; as influences. 
They also draw inspiration from surrealism and nature, both of which are reflected in the band&#x27;s album artwork, which Goldfrapp designs in collaboration with Big Active.

=== Collaboration and composition technique ===
All the band&#x27;s songs are composed jointly by Goldfrapp and Gregory, although they have collaborated with Nick Batt on several tracks. They have called their writing relationship a &quot;democracy&quot;, playing off one another while in the recording studio. While writing, Goldfrapp uses her vocals to create melodies and drumbeats. Gregory composes on vintage keyboards. The band believe that &quot;music is a visual experience&quot; and often visualise their songs before writing them.

<text>The Further and Higher Education Act 1992 made changes in the funding and administration of further education and higher education within England and Wales, with consequential effects on associated matters in Scotland which had previously been governed by the same legislation as England and Wales. It was introduced during the First Major ministry.

The most visible result was to allow thirty-five polytechnics to become universities (often referred to as the &quot;new universities&quot; or &quot;post-1992 universities&quot;). A goal of the act was to end the distinction – known as the &quot;binary divide&quot; – between colleges and universities.

In addition, the act created bodies to fund higher education in England—HEFCE—and further education—FEFC. Universities in Scotland and Wales which had previously been funded by the UK-wide Universities Funding Council were the subject of other acts that created higher education funding councils in each country. The act also removed colleges of further education from local government control, and created quality assessment arrangements.

<doc id="749901" wikidata="Q6695499" url="?curid=749901" title="Lubombo Transfrontier Conservation Area">
<text>The Lubombo Transfrontier Conservation Area was born out of the Peace Park Foundation’s vision to establish a network of transfrontier conservation areas in southern Africa. It straddles the border between South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal province, southern Mozambique, and Eswatini.

==Overview==
The Lubombo Transfrontier Conservation Area covers , of which (66%) is in Mozambique, (26%) is in South Africa, and (8%) is in Eswatini. It is situated on a low-lying coastal plain between the Lebombo Mountains in the west and the Indian Ocean in the east. The area offers a unique combination of big-game country, extensive wetlands, and beautiful undeveloped coastal areas. It links the Maputo Elephant Reserve in Mozambique through the Futi Corridor and the Lubombo Conservancy in Eswatini to the Tembe Elephant Park in South Africa, creating the first major elephant stronghold along Africa&#x27;s eastern coastline.

==Maputo Elephant Reserve==
Now known as Maputo Special Reserve (or Reserva Especial de Maputo in Portuguese), this reserve is situated in the southernmost part of Mozambique, 79 km south of Maputo, in the province of Maputo. It is bounded on the east by the Indian Ocean, and on the west by the Rio Maputo.

In 1975 before the Mozambique civil war, vast numbers of wildlife including 65 White Rhinoceros were relocated from Umfolozi Game Reserve in Kwazulu Natal, South Africa. Sadly no rhinoceros and only some 200 elephant survived the 14-year war.

The elephant reserve is now threatened by industrial development 

On 18 July 2012 Macauhub News Agency reported that a public tender will be issued for selection of the company that will carry out the studies of the economic feasibility of building a deep water port an Techobanine.

The Mozambique Transport and Communications Minister, Paulo Zucula, said the master plan for the project had recently been completed, and that the proposal was due to be presented soon to the Council of Ministers. The port complex is expected to cover an area of 30,000 hectares, and will have an additional area of 11,000 hectares for industrial development, as well as capacity to process 200 million tons of cargo. 

The Techobanine region is 70km from Maputo and 20km north of Ponta do Ouro.

==Tembe Elephant Park==

Tembe Elephant Park is situated in Maputaland, in the north-eastern region of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa adjoining the Mozambique border. It is home to the province&#x27;s biggest African elephant herd and its only indigenous elephants. Tembe&#x27;s comprises a variety of unique sand forest, woodland, grassland and swampland habitats.

==The Greater St. Lucia Wetland Park==
The Greater St Lucia Wetland Park in the Ponta do Ouro-Kosi Bay Transfrontier Conservation Area (TFCA) was proclaimed a UNESCO World Heritage Site in November 1999. The site is the largest estuarine system in Africa and includes the southernmost extension of coral reefs on the continent. Efforts are ongoing to extend the existing World Heritage Site northwards to encompass the Mozambican section of the TFCA, which includes a marine protected area.

==Lubombo Conservancy==
Situated in the north eastern part of Eswatini in the Lubombo Region. This protected area includes the Hlane Royal National Park, the Mlawula Nature Reserve, the Shewula Community Nature Reserve, the Mbuluzi Game Reserve the Nkhalashane Siza Ranch and the Inyoni Yami Swaziland Irrigation Scheme, (also known as the IYSIS).

<text>Niomi Arleen McLean-Daley (born 26 April 1981), better known as Ms. Dynamite, is a British singer and rapper. She is the recipient of the Mercury Music Prize, two Brit Awards and three MOBO Awards.

== Early years ==
She was born Niomi Arleen McLean-Daley in Crawley, West Sussex, and raised in Kentish Town, North London, to a Jamaican father and a Scottish mother. She is the older sister of the rapper Akala.

== Career ==
=== 2001–2004: &quot;A Little Deeper&quot; ===
Ms. Dynamite (originally Lady Dynamite) was first known for her vocals on the UK garage underground track &quot;Booo!&quot;, which was regularly played on London pirate radio stations and was later released as a single. While working at the radio station RAW FM, Ms. Dynamite was discovered by Richard Forbes (&quot;DJ Sticky&quot;) at a West End club. Interest grew from all major British labels and eventually she was signed via her management Bigga Beats to Polydor Records, where she met producer Salaam Remi, who cultivated her talent.

She released her debut album, &quot;A Little Deeper&quot;, in 2002, which featured hit songs &quot;It Takes More&quot; and &quot;Dy-Na-Mi-Tee&quot;. In 2003, the album was released in the United States to critical acclaim. In 2002, Dynamite won the prestigious Mercury Music Prize, for &quot;A Little Deeper&quot;. She donated the £20,000 prize to the NSPCC.

On 8 March 2003, Ms. Dynamite was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live, hosted by Queen Latifah.

Also in 2003, Ms. Dynamite signed a deal to promote Pepsi, reported to be worth £1m 

She performed at the closing ceremony of the 2002 Commonwealth Games at the City of Manchester Stadium. On 2 July 2005, she performed at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park, London. Among the songs performed was &quot;Redemption Song&quot; written by Bob Marley, which she performed alongside her brother, Akala.

=== 2005–2006: &quot;Judgement Days&quot; ===

On 11 September 2005, she returned to the limelight (having taken time off to have her son, Shavaar) with a new album titled &quot;Judgement Days&quot;. Featuring more social commentary, in songs such as the first double A-side single, &quot;Judgement Day&quot;/&quot;Father&quot; and the Tony Blair critique, &quot;Mr Prime Minister,&quot; reviews of the album were not as favourable as those of her debut. However, &quot;Judgement Day&quot; reached No. 25 in the UK Singles Chart.

In 2006, she was convicted of assaulting a police officer and was sentenced to 60 hours community service.

=== 2007–present: Hiatus and career wind-down ===
After a break from music, Dynamite guest-hosted BBC Radio 1Xtra, and said she would be releasing a third album, &quot;Democracy&quot;, in 2009, with the first single from the new album being &quot;Bad Gyal&quot;. However, this was deferred as she concentrated on other projects and motherhood. Meanwhile, she appeared on &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; on ITV1 in 2009, finishing fourth, and later as an expert adviser on &quot;Goldie&#x27;s Band: By Royal Appointment&quot; on BBC Two.

Since then, she has appeared on several collaborations, notably Katy B&#x27;s second single, &quot;Lights On&quot;, which peaked at number 4 in the UK Singles Chart in 2010, and the Magnetic Man track &quot;Fire&quot;, which appeared on their debut album.

A single, &quot;Neva Soft&quot; (produced by Labrinth), was released in 2011, although a promised associated album did not appear. Since then she has been the featured vocalist on the DJ Fresh Versus Jay Fray track &quot;Dibby Dibby Sound&quot; (February 2013) and a David Guetta and Showtek song for the former&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;Listen&quot;, &quot;No Money No Love&quot; along with Elliphant.

In 2020 Ms. Dynamite appeared on a CLIPZ (Redlight (musician)), single &quot;Again&quot; which also featured Ms Banks and JayKae.

<text>Salford Quays is an area of Salford, Greater Manchester, England, near the end of the Manchester Ship Canal. Previously the site of Manchester Docks, it faces Trafford across the canal.

==History==

Built by the Manchester Ship Canal Company, Salford Docks was the larger of two that made up Manchester Docks, the other being Pomona Docks to the east, which opened in 1903. They were opened in 1894 by Queen Victoria and spanned of water and of land. At their height, the Manchester Docks was the third-busiest port in Britain, but after containerisation and the limit placed on vessel size on the Manchester Ship Canal, the docks declined in the 1970s. They closed in 1982, resulting in the loss of 3,000 jobs.

In 1983, Salford City Council acquired parts of the docks covering from the Manchester Ship Canal Company with the aid of a derelict land grant. The area was rebranded as Salford Quays and redevelopment by Urban Waterside began in 1985 under the Salford Quays Development Plan. Faced with major pollution issues from the quality of the water in the ship canal, dams were built to isolate the docks, after which water quality was improved by aerating it using a compressed air mixing system. Within two years the quality was sufficient to introduce 12,000 coarse fish, which have thrived in the environment. Water quality is monitored fortnightly by scientists from APEM, the Manchester University Aquatic Pollution and Environmental Monitoring Unit, and the improved habitat has been recognised by the Angling Foundation and the Institute of Fisheries Management.

Between 1986 and 1990, the infrastructure of the docks was modified to create an internal waterway network. Roads and bridges were built and a promenade along the waterfront constructed and landscaped. Moorings and watersports facilities were provided and a railway swing bridge moved to cross Dock 9. A hotel, cinema, housing, offices were built on Piers 5 and 6 followed by more developments on Pier 7. Public funding and private investment totalled around £280 million by the early 1990s.

==Landmarks==

===The Lowry===

Early in the planning stages for redevelopment of Salford Quays in 1988, potential was recognised for a landmark arts venue, the Salford Quays Centre for the Performing Arts, which became known as the Lowry Project in 1994. It had secured £64 million in funding by 22 February 1996.

The Lowry stands at the end of Pier 8, largely surrounded by the waters of the Manchester Ship Canal. Designed by James Stirling and Michael Wilford, it opened on 28 April 2000 and houses the 1,730 seat Lyric theatre, the 466 seat Quays theatre, studio spaces and of gallery space. There are cafes, bars and a restaurant at the south-western end of the building. The centre is associated with L. S. Lowry, and houses a collection of his work.

===Imperial War Museum North===

The Imperial War Museum North (IWM North), on Trafford Wharf Road in Trafford Park, overlooks the Manchester Ship Canal on the opposite bank to the Lowry and MediaCityUK. The area was heavily bombed during the Manchester Blitz in December 1940. The museum, designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, opened in July 2002. Its structure was designed to be a metaphor for a world shattered by war with sloping walls and ceilings. Three areas, the Air, Earth and Water Shards house exhibition and gallery space, public areas and restaurants.

The museum has an extensive collection of historical artefacts, primarily from the wars occurring during the 20th century, the museum also has an exhibition house with theme changes on a regular basis. As of 2021, the exhibition is dedicated to aid workers throughout the world, predominantly the Middle East and North Africa. The museum also has a large section of twisted and rusted steelwork from the collapsed World Trade Center.

===MediaCityUK===
MediaCityUK is a mixed-use property development on Pier 9 of the Quays with a focus on creative industries. It was developed by the Peel Group. Its principal tenants are media organisations including the BBC. The brownfield site occupied by the development was part of the Port of Manchester.


==Businesses==

The Quayside Mall contains outlet stores of well-known high-street businesses, including Cadbury, Marks &amp; Spencer and Gap. The mall contains coffee shops and convenience food chains, and a multi-screen cinema operated by Vue. Outside the mall, a bar and several restaurants overlook the Lowry plaza.

The head office of the UK arm of Communicorp is situated in Laser House on Salford Quays, with the company&#x27;s flagship stations 100.4 Smooth Radio and XS Manchester broadcasting from studios there. Standing at the head of Erie Basin (Dock 9), &quot;Anchorage&quot; is a complex of buildings, which will shortly begin a partial redevelopment in to a residential complex alongside the existing office accommodation. To the north side of Erie Basin stand the Victoria and Alexandra buildings home to Haelo (Salford&#x27;s Innovation and Improvement Science Centre).

To the south east, the former Colgate-Palmolive factory underwent a £25m renovation project known as Soapworks and is now the home of TalkTalk.

Quays Reach has which is located between the Langworthy and MediaCityUK tram stops, houses numerous businesses such NSPCC and Datacentreplus. The Salford City College FutureSkills building is also situated on the same road.

==Residential==
Some of the first developments in Salford Quays were residential, initial builds consisting of traditional low-rise flats and town houses in Grain Wharf and Merchants Quay. As the area prospered, more high-rise buildings were constructed to increase housing density on the limited pier space. Because of the premium on space, flats have been constructed on the opposite side of Trafford Road to the Quays.

===Low rise===
====Merchants Quay====
Merchants Quay was one of the area&#x27;s earliest residential developments, constructed in the mid-to-late 1980s. It consists of 100 residential units including terraced houses, mews properties, and four low rise apartment blocks. It is situated on East Wharf South, between South Bay (Dock 6) to the south and the St Francis, St Louis, and St Peter basins (Dock 7) to the north. Properties on the western edge of the pier overlook the Imperial War Museum North and Lowry Bridge over the Quays turning circle; the largest expanse of water at Salford Quays. The development is linked to Pier 7, the business-orientated Waterfront Quay on the north side of the basins on East Wharf North. Many of the paths are derelict and have litter problems because neither the local councils (Salford, or Trafford on the opposite side of the water) nor the private owners or businesses accept responsibility for maintenance.
====Grain Wharf==== 
Located at the centre of the Quays, it consists of three matching developments: Winnipeg Quay and Vancouver Quay to the west of Mariners Canal, and St. Lawrence Quay to the east. Its name derives from the land&#x27;s previous use, when imported grain was delivered by ship and transferred to the railway network that ran the length of Pier 8 (Central Wharf). Built between 1985 and 1995, Grain Wharf consists of a combination of two and three bedroom town houses and apartments, none exceeding four storeys in height. Many properties have views over Huron and Erie Basin (Dock 9) and Mariners Canal, with a number of town houses in Winnipeg and Vancouver Quay facing a landscaped garden square. The development is noted for its distinctly symmetrical layout. Mariners Canal was added to link the cleaned water of Ontario Basin to the south and Erie Basin to the north for water sports; the watersports centre is opposite Vancouver Quay. Vancouver and St. Lawrence Quays are linked by a footbridge over the canal, and by the Quays road.
====Labrador Quay====
These five three-storey apartment blocks at the far end of Erie Basin were completed in 2003. Accessed via the St. Lawrence Quay cul-de-sac, the buildings are inconspicuous due to the waterside tree planting and their location behind both The Lighthouse offices and Anchorage buildings. Two buildings face directly onto the water of Erie Basin, while the others are angled around communal gardens.

===High rise===

====Imperial Point====
This was the first of the high-rise residential buildings on the Quays: a 16-storey tower built alongside the Quayside Mall on Pier 8 (Central Wharf) in 2001. Finished in sand-coloured cladding with grey and steel finishes to the roof, service cores and balconies, the lower levels are integrated into the mall.
====Sovereign Point====
This sister building of Imperial Point is located towards the rear of the Quayside Mall. Completed in 2005, its 20 storeys are residential, except for some commercial units at ground level, including Sovereign Food and Wine, the Quays&#x27; first grocery store. The tower&#x27;s design was controversial and regarded as having a poor aesthetic on all but the water-facing elevation and is in stark relief to the neighbouring low-rise Winnipeg Quay.
====The NV Buildings==== 
Designed by Broadway Maylan and completed between 2004 and 2005, the development consists of three 18-storey residential towers, each in height. Costing £36 million, they stand in a line overlooking Huron Basin from the waterside of Pier 9 (North Wharf), their curved frontages are designed to represent sails. At night, the buildings are illuminated by green lights atop curved poles, and green flood light to either side. The Type 3 apartment in the NV Buildings won gold for &quot;Best Apartment&quot; in 2004 &quot;What House?&quot; awards.
====City Lofts==== 
Construction began in 2005 and completed in late 2007. The development consists of two linked towers: one 9 storeys, the other 19 storeys. They are on land adjacent to the bund carrying the Quays road, which separates the Manchester Ship Canal from the cleaned water of the Salford Quays basins. The apartments&#x27; interior design was by Conran &amp; Partners. Interest in the development was limited, due to the slump in the housing market, and in July 2008, City Lofts was forced to place all its unsold apartments, including many at Salford Quays, into receivership.

====MediaCityUK==== 
Completed in 2010, The Heart and NumberOne are both 22-storey blocks.

====X1 Media City====
X1 Media City is the tallest development on the Quays. As of 2023, Towers A, B and D are completed, Tower C is yet to start construction. Once complete, the development will be the largest residential scheme in the north west, comprising 1,100 apartments.

==Leisure uses==

===Sport===
In 2003, Salford Quays was the venue for the first International Triathlon Union World Cup event to be held in the UK. It has since become an annual event held at the end of July each year, although the 2008 event was cancelled because of a clash with the Beijing Olympics. In September 2010 and May 2011, the site hosted the Great Salford Swim, a mass participation open water swim event. The event has been re-branded as the Great Manchester Swim since 2012.

Salford Watersports Centre opened in 2001, in Ontario Basin, a closed off area created for it providing a range of watersports and outdoor activities including Royal Yachting Association recognised training in sailing and British Canoe Union recognised training in kayaking and canoeing. Agecroft Rowing Club currently operates from Salford Quays.

In 2012 the Salford Quays were rejuvenated for the London Olympic Games, in which they were used for swimming and diving. Six gold medallists swam at the Quays.

In 2013, the triathlon returned on 18 August.

In 2015, East Cheshire Sub Aqua Club installed a 2-metre x 3 metre scuba diving training platform in St Peter&#x27;s basin further extending the use of the Salford Quays for watersports, allowing scuba divers to safely conduct training, away from the silt in the basin.

===Tourism===
Salford Quays is part of a joint tourism initiative between Salford and Trafford councils supported by private sector partners including the Lowry, the Imperial War Museum North, Manchester United F.C., Lancashire County Cricket Club, the Quayside Mall and the Golden Tulip and Copthorne Hotels; working in partnership with Marketing Manchester. Salford Quays forms one part of the area known as the Quays, which also includes Trafford Wharf and Old Trafford, on the Trafford side of the ship canal.

==Transport==
Salford Quays is connected to Manchester city centre by the Eccles Line of the Manchester Metrolink. This connection opened in 1999 and was extended onward to Eccles in 2000. The section of the Eccles Line from to MediaCityUK serves the Salford Quays area. Trams operate every 6 minutes throughout the day (except MediaCityUK tram stop which is every 12 minutes) and every 12 minutes on Sundays. MediaCityUK Metrolink tram stop opened in summer 2010 to serve the MediaCityUK complex.

The Metrolink Trafford Park Line opened in March 2020. It includes two stations close to Salford Quays: Wharfside and Imperial War Museum.

Frequent bus services are provided from the Quays by Go North West&#x27;s Orbits 53 providing links to Oxford Road, Etihad Campus, Salford Shopping Centre and Cheetham Hill and Stagecoach Manchester&#x27;s 50 linking MediaCityUK to East Didsbury, Manchester Piccadilly bus station, Salford Central and Salford Crescent railway stations, the University of Salford and Salford Shopping Centre. A number of lower frequency routes are operated by Diamond Bus North West linking 
Boothstown, Worsley and Stretford with the area.

Salford Quays and the Trafford Wharf area are accessible from the M602 motorway and major arterial routes from the Trafford Centre, Manchester city centre, Salford and Old Trafford. Many main routes around the Quays are high-quality dual carriageway routes, built after the closure of Salford Docks.

<text>Lancashire Cricket Club represents the historic county of Lancashire in English cricket. The club has held first-class status since it was founded in 1864. Lancashire&#x27;s home is Old Trafford Cricket Ground, although the team also play matches at other grounds around the county. Lancashire was a founder member of the County Championship in 1890 and has won the competition nine times. Lancashire has won 26 major honours in its history. The club&#x27;s limited overs team is called Lancashire Lightning.

Lancashire was widely recognised as the Champion County four times between 1879 and 1889. It won its first two County Championship titles in the 1897 and 1904 seasons. Between 1926 and 1934, it won the championship five times. Throughout most of the inter-war period, Lancashire and its neighbours Yorkshire had the best two teams in England and the Roses Matches between them were usually the highlight of the domestic season. In 1950, Lancashire shared the title with Surrey. The County Championship was restructured in 2000 with Lancashire in the first division. They won the 2011 County Championship, a gap of 77 years since the club&#x27;s last outright title in 1934.

In 1895, Archie MacLaren scored 424 in an innings for Lancashire, which remains the highest score by an Englishman in first-class cricket. Johnny Briggs, whose career lasted from 1879 to 1900, was the first player to score 10,000 runs and take 1,000 wickets for Lancashire. Ernest Tyldesley, younger brother of Johnny Tyldesley, is the club&#x27;s leading run-scorer with 34,222 runs in 573 matches for Lancashire between 1909 and 1936. Fast bowler Brian Statham took a club record 1,816 wickets in 430 first-class matches between 1950 and 1968. England batsman Cyril Washbrook became Lancashire&#x27;s first professional captain in 1954.

The Lancashire side of the late 1960s and early 1970s, captained by Jack Bond and featuring the West Indian batsman Clive Lloyd, was successful in limited overs cricket, winning the Sunday League in 1969 and 1970 and the Gillette Cup four times between 1970 and 1975. Lancashire won the Benson and Hedges Cup in 1984, three times between 1990 and 1996, and the Sunday League in 1989, 1998 and 1999. They won the Twenty20 Cup for the first time in 2015.

==Earliest cricket in Lancashire==

Cricket may not have reached Lancashire until the 18th century. As advised by the Association of Cricket Statisticians (ACS), the earliest known reference to the sport being played in the county has been found in the &quot;Manchester Journal&quot; dated Saturday, 1 September 1781. It concerned an eleven-a-side match played the previous Monday, 27 August, at Brinnington Moor between a team of printers and one representing the villages of Haughton and Bredbury, who were the winners. As Bredbury was then in Cheshire, the match is the earliest reference for that county too.

In 1816, the Manchester Cricket Club was founded and soon became the main north country rivals of Nottingham Cricket Club and Sheffield Cricket Club. On 23–25 July 1849, the Sheffield and Manchester clubs played each other at Hyde Park in Sheffield but the fixture was styled Yorkshire v Lancashire. It was the first match to involve a team using Lancashire as its name and is sometimes reckoned to have been the first Roses Match. Yorkshire won by five wickets. Teams called Yorkshire, though based on the Sheffield club, had been active since 1833. The Roses Match is one of cricket&#x27;s oldest and most famous rivalries. In 1857, the Manchester club moved to Old Trafford, which has been the home of Lancashire cricket ever since.

==History of the county club==
===Origin===

On 12 January 1864, Manchester Cricket Club organised a meeting at the Queen&#x27;s Hotel in Manchester for the purpose of forming a club to represent the county. Thirteen local clubs were represented: Broughton, Longsight, Manchester and Western from the Manchester area; Huyton, Liverpool and Northern from Merseyside; Accrington, Ashton, Blackburn, Oldham, Whalley and Wigan from other towns. Lancashire County Cricket Club was founded with the object of, it was said, &quot;spreading a thorough knowledge and appreciation of the game throughout Lancashire&quot;. It was intended to stage home matches alternately at Old Trafford, Aigburth, Preston, Blackburn and at &quot;other places to help introduce good cricket throughout the county&quot;.

The new county club played its first-ever official game at Warrington against Birkenhead Park on Wednesday, 15 June 1864 but that was not a first-class match. The first inter-county match, which was first-class, was played in 1865 at Old Trafford against Middlesex; Lancashire won the match by 62 runs, although Middlesex&#x27;s V. E. Walker took all ten wickets in Lancashire&#x27;s second innings.

===Early successes===
The early Lancashire side was reliant upon amateurs, which led to problems; although they were happy to play at Old Trafford, they were less willing to travel to away fixtures. During the early 1870s, the team was dominated by A. N. Hornby’s batting. The team&#x27;s standard of cricket improved with the arrival of two professional players, Dick Barlow and Alex Watson. The impact of Barlow and Hornby was such that their batting partnership was immortalised in the poem &quot;At Lord’s &quot; by Francis Thompson. The team was further enhanced by A. G. Steel, an amateur sometimes considered second only to W. G. Grace as the country&#x27;s best all rounder; Johnny Briggs, a professional from Sutton-in-Ashfield and the only player to score 10,000 runs and take 1,000 wickets for Lancashire; and wicket-keeper Dick Pilling, who in 1891 was rated by &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; as the second-best wicket-keeper in the world behind Jack Blackham. As Lancashire&#x27;s consistency improved, so did their support: in 1878, 28,000 over three days watched Lancashire play Gloucestershire.

The club&#x27;s first success came in 1879, when the majority of the cricket press – except for Wisden – agreed that Lancashire and Nottinghamshire were joint champions. Lancashire was the champion county in 1881 and again shared the title with Nottinghamshire in 1882.

Dick Barlow carried his bat for just 5 not out in Lancashire&#x27;s total of 69 in two and a half hours against Nottinghamshire on a treacherous, rain-affected Trent Bridge pitch in July 1882. Barlow and his longtime opening partner Hornby are the opening batsmen immortalised in the famous poem by Francis Thompson. In 1884, Old Trafford became the second ground, after The Oval, to stage a Test match in England. Though it rained on the first day, 12,000 spectators attended on the second; the match between England and Australia resulted in a draw.

Controversy emerged during the 1880s; Kent and Nottinghamshire objected to the bowling actions of John Crossland and George Nash. Nottinghamshire even went as far as refusing to play against Lancashire. Although the 1880s was a period of controversy and modest results for the club, it was also a time in which some club records were established. In 1885 George Kemp (later 1st Baron Rochdale) scored Lancashire&#x27;s first century in a Roses Match. In that same year Johnny Briggs and Dick Pilling set a first-class record partnership for the tenth wicket of 173 that stood until 1899 and has not been bettered by Lancashire. The club shared the title of champions with Surrey in 1889.
The County Championship was founded in 1890, and champions were decided by points rather than the press as had happened previously. Lancashire was one of the eight founding teams of the championship along with Gloucestershire, Kent, Middlesex, Nottinghamshire, Surrey, Sussex and Yorkshire. The team was runner up in 1890 and 1891. Archie MacLaren was appointed captain in 1894, four years after making his debut whilst still captain of Harrow. In 1895 MacLaren made his record-breaking innings of 424 against Somerset at Taunton; his innings remained the highest first-class score for an Englishman, was the first first-class quadruple century, and was the highest score in first-class cricket until Bill Ponsford scored 429 in February 1923. Again, Lancashire was runner up in 1895, despite Arthur Mold taking 192 wickets in the season, a feat bettered only twice for the club. The current pavilion was constructed in 1895 and cost £10,000 (£ in 2025); it replaced the earlier pavilion, dating from 1857 when Old Trafford was originally built.

Lancashire won its first county championship in 1897, a productive bowling attack made up of Johnny Briggs, Willis Cuttell, Albert Hallam, and Arthur Mold took 420 wickets between them. In 1898 Lancashire bought the ground and some adjoining land from the de Traffords for £24,732 (£ in 2025). In 1902, amateur and professional players began walking onto the field side by side in a break with tradition. Lancashire won its second championship title in 1904, going undefeated throughout the season; Wisden described the season as “the brightest in the history of Lancashire cricket”. That season, James Hallows completed the feat of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in the season. During the late 1900s and early 1910s, players such as Walter Brearley, Harry Dean, and Bill Huddleston were the mainstays of Lancashire bowling. The club began to experience financial problems during this same period; the increased popularity of other sports was blamed for the dip in attendances. In 1914, Lancashire sank to its lowest position of eleventh, whilst during World War I the pavilion was used by the Red Cross and 1,800 patients were treated there.

===The golden era===
After the war Lancashire developed a very strong batting side, including Ernest Tyldesley and Johnny Tyldesley, both Test batsmen. In 1920, Lancashire finished runner up and bowlers Harry Dean and Lawrence Cook took 274 wickets between them. During 1921, interest in cricket reached an all-time high, with over 250,000 people attending Old Trafford and over 4,500 members. 1922 was a year of contradictions, a strong team winning seven out of fifteen matches by an innings, but still managing to lose seven and finish 5th; that season Cec Parkin and Lawrence Cook mustered 308 wickets between them and Ernest Tyldesley scored over 2,000 runs. Lancashire&#x27;s steady progress was capped by a hat trick of championship titles between 1926 and 1928 under the captaincy of Leonard Green. In the 1926 victory, Ernest Tyldesley and Harry Makepeace each scored over 2,000 runs. In 1927, Charlie Hallows scored six centuries and the bowling attack was led by Dick Tyldesley and Ted McDonald with support from Frank Sibbles. In 1928, Frank Watson and Ernest Tyldesley scored over 2,000 runs each and George Duckworth claimed 107 victims and earned recognition as one of Wisden&#x27;s five Cricketers of the Year. At the end of the season Leonard Green decided to retire with a record of three successive championships and 42 wins against just three defeats.

Under the captaincy of Peter Eckersley, Lancashire finished second in the championship in 1929 and reclaimed the title in 1930, with ten victories and no defeats that season. After four titles in five seasons, the early 1930s saw a number of retirements including McDonald and Dick Tyldesley in 1931 and Ernest Tyldesley in 1935: no Lancashire batsman has matched Tyldesley&#x27;s 100 centuries in first-class cricket. Lancashire won the championship outright for the last time in 1934, the same year that Len Hopwood performed the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets (a feat he repeated in 1935) and Cyril Washbrook began to work his way into the team. The captain, Peter Eckersley, retired in 1935 to become an MP. The later half of the 1930s was a period of rebuilding up until the war, with the opening partnership of Cyril Washbrook and Eddie Paynter the highlight. Paynter scored 322 in five hours for Lancashire against Sussex in 1937 having come down on the sleeper train from the victorious Old Trafford Test against New Zealand. He put on 268 in 155 minutes with Cyril Washbrook and celebrated his innings that evening at Brighton&#x27;s Ice Palace.

===Post-war===
When play began in 1946, after World War II, things started badly for Lancashire when the captain and veteran player, Jack Iddon, was killed in a car accident just before the start of the season. Jack Fallows stood in as captain for the season. His successor, Ken Cranston, was an unusual choice as he had no prior first-class experience; despite this his captaincy was not unsuccessful as Lancashire finished third and fifth during his two years in charge. In 1947 Cyril Washbrook and Winston Place both scored over 2,500 runs and scored 19 centuries between them. Washbrook&#x27;s benefit took place in August 1948 and was watched by 50,000 people; he received £14,000 (£ in 2025), beating the previous record by over £10,000. Despite finishing 11th in 1949, in 1950 – under the captaincy of Nigel Howard – Lancashire shared the county championship with Surrey, winning 16 matches; Roy Tattersall and Malcolm Hilton claimed nearly 300 wickets between them. The 1950 season marked the emergence of Brian Statham. In the following three seasons, Lancashire finished third each time.

With the retirement of Nigel Howard in 1954, Lancashire appointed its first professional captain, Cyril Washbrook, who would captain the club for the next six years. In 1954 Geoff Pullar, Ken Grieves and Alan Wharton all scored over 2,000 runs, whilst Brian Statham, Ken Higgs and Tommy Greenhough all took over 100 wickets; despite this, Lancashire managed to finish only 5th. Lancashire came close to reclaiming the county championship in 1960 under a new captain, Bob Barber. Five batsmen scored more than 1,000 runs in the season, and Statham, Higgs and Greenhough all took over 100 wickets; Lancashire finished runner up due to a poor run of form towards the end of the season: losing four and drawing two of the last six matches after topping the table in August. The following year, however, Lancashire dropped to 13th, due in part to Barber&#x27;s inexperience and Statham&#x27;s and Geoff Pullar&#x27;s England commitments. Things declined further in 1962, under the leadership of Joe Blackledge, who had had no previous first-class experience, as Lancashire dropped to second last, winning only two matches. After a period of unrest, Brian Statham was appointed captain between 1965 and 1967 and Lancashire&#x27;s results improved. Statham retired in 1968 with 1,816 first-class wickets, a record for the club.

===Limited-overs success===
Jack Bond became Lancashire captain in 1968 and remained in the position until 1972. During his tenure, Lancashire performed well in the championship, finishing third in 1970 and 1971. His biggest triumph as captain was the five one day trophies he secured during his five-year captaincy. Farokh Engineer joined Lancashire in 1968, and Clive Lloyd joined in 1969; together Lloyd and Engineer helped establish Lancashire as one of the best one day sides in England. The silverware included a hat-trick of Gillette Cups (1970–72) and the Sunday League twice in successive seasons (1969–1970). Mainstays of the successful one day side included Clive Lloyd, David Lloyd, Barry Wood, Harry Pilling, Frank Hayes, Peter Lever, Ken Shuttleworth, David Hughes and Jack Simmons. In the Gillette Cup semi-final against Gloucestershire in 1971, David Hughes walked to the crease at 8.45pm and hit 24 from an over in near darkness to win the match. David Lloyd was captain from 1973 to 1977 and secured Lancashire&#x27;s fourth Gillette Cup in 1975, and coming runners up in 1974 and 1976. However, in the late 1970s, the team that had been so dominant in the one day format began to break up. Despite boasting international players such as Lloyd and Engineer, Lancashire&#x27;s first-class performances never matched the success of the limited overs team.

It wasn&#x27;t until 1984, under the captaincy of John Abrahams, that the club won more silverware, this time in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup. Despite a resurgence in limited overs matches, Lancashire finished in the bottom six of the county championship. After suffering defeat in the final of the 1986 Nat West Trophy, David Hughes was appointed captain. Towards the end of the 1980s, Lancashire&#x27;s side began to develop, with Graeme Fowler and Gehan Mendis building a productive opening partnership, while David Hughes and Neil Fairbrother provided support in the middle order. The bowlers were led by Patrick Patterson and Paul Allott with support from David Hughes, Mike Watkinson and Jack Simmons. In 1987 after eleven successive years in the bottom six, Lancashire finished second in the championship, their highest position in 27 years. Mike Atherton made his Lancashire debut in 1987 – scoring 600 runs in the second half of the season – and Wasim Akram first played for the team in 1988. Lancashire defeated Worcestershire in the final of the Refuge Cup in 1988. The following year the club won the Sunday League on the last day of the season in 1989 and finished fourth in the championship. At the age of 48, in 1989 Jack Simmons retired after having taken 985 first-class wickets for the county.

In 1990, Lancashire won both the Nat West Trophy and Benson &amp; Hedges Cup finals at Lord&#x27;s. This was the first time any county had won both competitions in the same year; Lancashire narrowly missed out on a treble, finishing runners-up in the Sunday League. Lancashire&#x27;s consistency continued, and the team finished second in the Sunday League and B&amp;H Cup. Paul Allott and Graeme Fowler were released at the end of the 1992 season. The team lost the B&amp;H final to Derbyshire in 1993. In 1994, young bowlers Peter Martin and Glen Chapple took 50 wickets each. The batting too looked promising, with John Crawley scoring two double centuries and Jason Gallian steadily improving. In 1995, Lancashire again won the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup. In 1996, Lancashire again won the double of the NatWest Trophy and Benson &amp; Hedges Cup. In 1998, with Wasim Akram as captain, Lancashire won the NatWest Trophy and Axa League, and finished second in the championship despite losing only five games in all competitions throughout the season. Apart from the National League second division title in 2003, this was the last time Lancashire won a trophy. 1999 was an eventful year for Lancashire with the debut of Muttiah Muralitharan, the departure of coach Dav Whatmore after just two years with the club and again the team finished second in the championship and won the National League.

===New century===
The team that had been so successful in the 1990s began to break up at the start of the 2000s. Since winning their last trophy in 1998, the team has lost eight semi-finals and two finals. In 2008 Lancashire managed to finish second in the County Championship. The competition was divided into two divisions for the 2000 season, with Lancashire in the first division. Lancashire&#x27;s one day form began to fluctuate in 2000, losing to Gloucestershire in the semi-finals of both the B&amp;H Cup and the NatWest Trophy, and being relegated in the National League. In 2001, Lancashire avoided relegation by just 5 points and were not promoted in the National League. The end of the season saw the retirement of Ian Austin from first-class cricket and of Mike Atherton from all forms of cricket. John Crawley left the club in the winter after not being retained as captain. Between 2001 and 2002 saw the squad change significantly, with players recruited from Essex, Northamptonshire, Worcestershire, and Yorkshire; the most notable additions to the squad were Stuart Law and David Byas – the Yorkshire captain of the previous season. After a quiet 2001 season – finishing mid-table in the county championship and again failing to secure promotion in the National League – 2002 was far more encouraging. Mike Watkinson was appointed cricket manager, and Stuart Law and Alec Swann both scored over 1,000 first-class runs and Peter Martin and Glen Chapple both took more than 50 wickets; the find of the season was that of James Anderson, who burst onto the scene with 50 wickets in the second half of the season, earning him a promotion to the England side. At the end of the season, Lancashire stalwarts Neil Fairbrother and Graham Lloyd retired.

2003 was a promising year, and Lancashire were genuine contenders for the county championship. Mark Chilton, Carl Hooper and Mal Loye all scored over 1,000 runs and Stuart Law was player of the year with 1,820 runs. Altogether, 28 championship centuries were scored for Lancashire, the second highest total in a season for the club. Gary Keedy was lead wicket taker with 60 wickets, supported by Martin and Chapple who took 41 and 49 respectively. They were promoted from the second division of the National League, lost in the semi-final of the C&amp;G Trophy, and finished second in the county championship.

In 2004, Lancashire were relegated to the second division of the County Championship for the first time since the competition was restructured into two divisions. This was despite starting the season as the bookmarkers&#x27; favourite to win the competition. At one point in the season, the team was without eight bowlers, with James Anderson, Andrew Flintoff, and Sajid Mahmood on international duty, while Glen Chapple, Dominic Cork, Kyle Hogg, Peter Martin, and all-rounder Carl Hooper were all injured. Their problems were not blamed solely on the injuries, Watkinson said &quot;quite simply the opposition have done the basics better than us. In addition we&#x27;ve one or two who are out of form on top of the injury list which ripped us to pieces&quot;. Despite being relegated in the County Championship, the team managed finish as runners up in the National League and were expected to be promoted back to the first division of first-class cricket in the 2005 season. While Watkinson expected backlash from the fans, he said that &quot;they were tremendously understanding about the injury situation&quot;. The squad underwent changes, with six players leaving – including Martin and Chris Schofield – and six joining, as well as a change of captain from wicket-keeper Warren Hegg to batsman Mark Chilton; Chilton was the club&#x27;s first Yorkshire-born captain. Between 1864 and 2004, Lancashire played 2,790 matches, winning 1,034, losing 583, drawing 1,170, with three tied matches. In this period, no other team had drawn more matches. The team&#x27;s percentage of wins was 37.06%, third behind Yorkshire (44.05%) and Surrey (39.74%).
Lancashire were promoted back to the first division of the county championship in 2005, winning the second division title in the process. They stayed up in the National League, progressed to the finals&#x27; day of the Twenty20 Cup and were knocked out in the semi-final of the C&amp;G Trophy. Despite winning the second division title, there were concerns that the squad may have been getting too old and that there were limited opportunities for the younger players. Of Lancashire&#x27;s performance over the season, Watkinson said &quot;I was not happy about our batting and, although we have achieved what we set out to do – get promoted – our performance left a lot to be desired&quot;. Lancashire are one of three teams, along with Middlesex and Surrey, never to have finished bottom in the County Championship. On their return to the first division in the 2006 season, Lancashire finished second in the Championship. They also finished as runners-up in the NatWest Trophy.

In 2007, although they led the table before the final round of matches, Lancashire were again runners-up in the County Championship. After being knocked out of the Twenty20 competition in the group states and performing poorly in the other one-day competitions early in the season, supporters started to become discontented with the captain and coach. Sussex ended up winning the title as Lancashire lost their final match of the competition against Surrey. Chris Adams, the Sussex captain, said &quot;you played well, you had a hard season, there&#x27;s no shame in your performance and you nearly did it&quot;. After the match against Surrey, Chilton was in tears and said &quot;I&#x27;m extremely proud of what our guys have achieved though. As captain I&#x27;m privileged to have seen the efforts they have put in. To get close to our target was a phenomenal effort but the lads are just broken. Our players have risen to an almighty challenge and to come so close is an enormous effort&quot;. After three years as captain, Mark Chilton stepped down in October 2007 and was replaced by Stuart Law who is the most successful captain in Australian domestic cricket. However his captaincy lasted for just one season, and Lancashire again failed to claim any silverware. At the end of the season Law and veteran player Cork were released, with Chapple replacing Law as captain. In December 2008, Watkinson&#x27;s job as cricket manager was changed to that of director of cricket – a job which would focus solely on aspects of cricket, rather than the traditional all-encompassing job of general team management. The move was explained by the club chairman as an effort to modernise.

In February 2009, it was announced that Peter Moores – who had been sacked as England coach the previous month – would be Lancashire&#x27;s new coach and had a three-year contract. In 2011 Chapple and Moores took Lancashire to their first outright first-class county championship title since 1934, although they had shared the title with Surrey in 1950. Despite being reigning champions in 2012, Lancashire had a poor season and were relegated to the Second Division. In 2013 they bounced straight back to Division 1 by winning the second division championship with a game to spare. They were once again relegated to Division 2 on the last day of the 2014 season after failing to win a tightly fought game against Middlesex. Ashley Giles (formerly of Warwickshire and England) was appointed as Director of Cricket and Head Coach after Mike Watkinson stepped down from the role in October 2014.

Lancashire gained immediate promotion in 2015, finishing as Division Two runners-up behind Surrey, and enjoyed the bonus of winning the T20 Cup for the first time. They were well served that season by overseas players Kyle Jarvis and Ashwell Prince. They finished seventh in 2016 and then improved to finish second in 2017, though they were a long way behind the runaway winners Essex. The team struggled in 2018 and were relegated. In 2019, the team went unbeaten in Division 2 to comfortably win promotion back up to Division 1.

On 30 March 2020, the chairman of the club David Hodgkiss died at the age of 71 due to coronavirus disease 2019 complications during the coronavirus pandemic. am

On 10 May 2024, it was announced that The King, as Duke of Lancaster, had agreed to become the club&#x27;s patron, taking over from the previous Duke, Queen Elizabeth II.

==Ground==
Since its formation, Lancashire has played home matches at Old Trafford Cricket Ground, west of Manchester city centre. Old Trafford has played host to international matches since 1884.

Lancashire also play matches at Blackpool Cricket Club, Liverpool Cricket Club, Southport and an annual fixture at Sedbergh School.

==Finances==
Lancashire Cricket Club has a record of strong finances which has been attributed to several factors including its diverse facilities and having the largest membership in the country. The Old Trafford Lodge is a hotel which is part of the ground and the ground has been used for conference facilities and has staged music concerts. Another source of income is opening the ground&#x27;s car park during Manchester United F.C.&#x27;s home matches. Between 2004 and 2006, the club made record profits, each year getting progressively better and in 2006 recorded a profit of £747,370. While in 2009 more than half of the 18 counties were in profit, 15 in 2010 experienced financial losses, Lancashire included. The total losses of the 18 counties amounted to over £9 million. Lancashire suffered losses of £2.1 million for 2010, primarily because of the club&#x27;s investment in rebuilding Old Trafford, particularly the construction of The Point. The absence of Test cricket and legal action related to the ground&#x27;s redevelopment also contributed to the financial loss.

<text>Marais Viljoen, (2 December 1915 – 4 January 2007) was the last ceremonial State President of South Africa from 4 June 1979 until 3 September 1984. Viljoen became the last of the ceremonial presidents of South Africa when he was succeeded in 1984 by Prime Minister P. W. Botha, who combined the offices into an executive state presidency.

==Early life==

Viljoen was the youngest of six children of Magdalena Debora &quot;Lenie&quot; (de Villiers) and Gabriel Francois Viljoen. He was married on 20 April 1940 to Dorothea Maria Brink (17 September 1917 – 5 October 2005), with whom he had one daughter Elizabeth Magdalena (Elna) Viljoen.

After finishing school at Jan van Riebeeck High School in Cape Town, he went to work in the Post Office, and thereafter at the Afrikaans language newspaper, &quot;Die Transvaler&quot;, edited by Hendrik Verwoerd, who later became prime minister.

==Early political career==

Viljoen was elected to the House of Assembly as MP for Alberton, near Johannesburg, as President of the Senate, and as acting State President from 21 August 1978 to 10 October 1978, when B.J. Vorster was briefly elected to the position. Viljoen was seen as a relatively-moderate member of the National Party, which instituted apartheid.

==State Presidency==

After Vorster&#x27;s resignation as a result of the Muldergate Scandal in 1979, Viljoen held the post of non-executive State President from 4 June 1979 until 3 September 1984. The State Presidency during this time was a ceremonial post, like that of the Governor-General, which it replaced in 1961.

Under the 1983 Constitution, the last under apartheid, the position of the State President was changed to a more powerful executive position. Viljoen retired and was replaced by P. W. Botha, who until 1984 had been the executive Prime Minister. After Viljoen had retired from public life, he continued to maintain an interest in politics.

==Depiction on a coin==

He is depicted on the obverse of the 1985 1 Rand coin.

==Death==

Viljoen died on 4 January 2007 of heart failure. He received a state funeral on 13 January 2007.

<text>The &quot;Portland&quot; class of heavy cruisers was a class of ships designed and constructed by the United States Navy in 1930. The two ships of the class, and , saw extensive service during the Pacific War in World War II.

Designed as a modification over the previous , the &quot;Portland&quot; class displaced just under and featured heavier armor and armament than previous cruisers. Featuring 8&quot;/55 caliber guns and designed to function as fleet flagships, the &quot;Portland&quot; class were intended to fix problems with armament and armor that had been a weakness of preceding U.S. cruisers. These designs were carried over to the following , to which six intended &quot;Portland&quot; cruisers were converted, three of which were already mid-construction.

&quot;Portland&quot; served in many engagements including the Battle of Coral Sea, the Battle of Midway and the Guadalcanal Campaign, where she was severely damaged but nonetheless able to return to service. She later fought in the Battle of Leyte Gulf and the Battle of Okinawa. &quot;Indianapolis&quot; served as a fleet flagship for much of the war and fought in the Battle of Philippine Sea and the Battle of Iwo Jima. On 30 July 1945, after transporting components for the nuclear weapons Little Boy and Fat Man from the United States, she was torpedoed by the . Due to a series of errors and miscommunications her loss was not discovered for several days, and only 316 of her 1,195 crew survived – the greatest single loss of life at sea, from a single ship, in the history of the U.S. Navy.

== Background ==
The &quot;Portland&quot; class was the third class of heavy cruiser to be constructed by the United States Navy following the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. The first &quot;treaty cruisers&quot; were the two of the ordered in 1926, which emphasized armament and speed at the expense of protection. These ships were followed by the six vessels of the &quot;Northampton&quot; class ordered in 1927 with slightly better armor, and introduced the configuration of three triple turrets which would become standard on U.S. Navy heavy cruisers. The &quot;Portland&quot; class was a modification of both the &quot;Pensacola&quot; and &quot;Northampton&quot; designs.

&quot;Portland&quot; was the first ship constructed under the provision of the 13 February 1929 &quot;Cruiser Act&quot; of the United States Congress, which authorized one aircraft carrier and 15 &quot;light cruisers&quot; to be built. had been assigned the first hull number in this group, but was eventually laid down later.

Ordered for the U.S. Navy in fiscal year 1930, the &quot;Portland&quot; class was originally designated as a light cruiser, and given the hull classification symbol CL, being re-designated a heavy cruiser with the symbol CA on 1 July 1931, due to their armament, in accordance with the London Naval Treaty. Originally, eight cruisers were envisioned as modified &quot;Northampton&quot;-class vessels, but eventually two of these became the &quot;Portland&quot; class, with the remaining six eventually being further modified into the succeeding . The first three &quot;New Orleans&quot;-class cruisers, &quot;New Orleans&quot;, &quot;Astoria&quot;, and &quot;Minneapolis&quot;, were initially ordered as &quot;Portland&quot;-class vessels, but were reordered to the design of .

== Design ==
As built, the &quot;Portland&quot;-class cruisers were to be in length overall, long at the waterline, abeam, and with a draft of , and maximum. They were designed for a standard displacement of , and a full-load displacement of . However, neither completed ship reached this weight, displacing and , respectively. The ships featured two distinctive raked funnels, a tripod foremast, and a small tower and pole mast aft. In 1943, light tripods were added forward of the second funnel on each ship, and a prominent Naval director was installed aft.
The ships were equipped with four propeller shafts and four Parsons GT geared turbines and eight Yarrow boilers. The power plant of the ships generated and the ships had a design speed of The ships were designed for a range of at . Both completed ships rolled badly until fitted with bilge keels.

The cruisers were armed with a main battery of nine Mark 9 8&quot;/55 caliber guns arrayed in three triple mounts, a superfiring pair fore and one aft. For anti-aircraft defense, they were armed with eight 5&quot;/25 caliber guns as well as two QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss guns. By 1945, the anti-aircraft defenses of both ships had repeatedly been upgraded, with each eventually receiving twenty four Bofors 40 mm guns. On these were arranged in four quad mounts and four twin mounts, and on they were arrayed in six quad mounts. Both ships were also upgraded with twelve Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. No torpedo tubes were fitted on either ship of the class. The ships were outfitted with Mk. 8 rangekeepers and Mk. 27 directors which also housed auxiliary Mk. VII rangekeepers.

The &quot;Portland&quot; class was originally designed with of deck protection and of side protection, but during construction they were substantially up-armored. The ships were completed with belt armor thick over the magazines and elsewhere. Armored bulkheads were between and , deck armor was , the barbettes were , the gunhouses were , and the conning tower was .

Additionally, the &quot;Portland&quot;-class cruisers were designed with space to be outfitted as fleet flagships, with space for a flag officer and his staff to operate. The class also featured an aircraft catapult amidships. They could carry four aircraft. The total crew complement varied, with a regular designed crew complement of 807, a wartime complement of 952, which could increase to 1,229 when the cruiser was operating as a fleet flagship.

=== Comparison with previous cruiser designs ===
The &quot;Portland&quot; class was generally longer than the &quot;Northampton&quot; class by about and featured a revised bow shape. They were otherwise generally similar to the &quot;Northampton&quot; class, with an extended forecastle to improve sea-keeping abilities. Their masts were reduced as compared to the &quot;Northampton&quot; class in order to reduce top weight.

When completed, the &quot;Pensacola&quot; class displaced less than expected, at , which was less than expected, and were found to be greatly deficient in their protection. For the following &quot;Northampton&quot; class, the armor protection was increased to with of armor along the main belt. Still, these ships only displaced between and While the &quot;Portland&quot;-class cruisers were more heavily armored than the preceding classes, this problem was found to be so significant that in fiscal year 1929, an entirely different design was formulated for a new class of cruisers, the &quot;New Orleans&quot; class. Several of the &quot;Portland&quot; hulls were then converted to &quot;New Orleans&quot; hulls during construction.

The &quot;Portland&quot; class were also designed with more advanced armament in mind. Their main guns were the first to be specially designed to fire long-point projectiles with a streamlined shape, which increased the guns&#x27; range when compared with older cruiser guns. Such projectiles were in use by ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, which until that point out-ranged U.S. cruisers with their firepower. The &quot;New Orleans&quot; class was designed with these lessons in mind, intended to create a better balance between protection, armament and speed.

== Construction ==
Five ships were ordered in fiscal year 1930, to be constructed by three builders. In 1931, CA-32, CA-34, and CA-36, all ordered with Westinghouse machinery, were converted to the &quot;New Orleans&quot; class. &quot;Portland&quot; was laid down by Bethlehem Steel at Quincy Shipyard on 17 February 1930, and &quot;Indianapolis&quot; was laid down by New York Shipbuilding Corporation on 31 March 1930. The hull and machinery of both ships was provided by their respective builders. &quot;Indianapolis&quot; was launched first, on 7 November 1931 and commissioned on 15 November 1932. &quot;Portland&quot; was launched on 21 May 1932 and commissioned on 23 February 1933.

== Ships in class ==
=== USS &quot;Portland&quot; (CA-33) ===

&quot;Portland&quot; was the first ship on the scene when the airship went down in 1933, and coordinated efforts to retrieve survivors. She conducted a number of fleet maneuvers and goodwill missions throughout the Pacific Ocean. After the start of World War II, &quot;Portland&quot; took part in the Battle of Coral Sea, there rescuing 722 survivors from the sunk aircraft carrier . She then fought at the Battle of Midway, the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, and in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, where she was hit by three dud air-launched torpedoes. She then supported U.S. Marine landings during the Battle of Guadalcanal. During the naval battle there in late 1942, she was struck and severely damaged by a torpedo from a Japanese destroyer, a hit which required interim repairs in Australia followed by extensive repairs at Mare Island Navy Yard. In spite of this damage, she was still able to inflict damage on the .

Returning to the war, she bombarded Kiska as part of the Aleutian Islands campaign, played a supporting role in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, covered landings during the New Guinea campaign, and Pelelieu. She then participated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, covered landings in the Philippines, and supported the Battle of Okinawa. At the end of the war she was decommissioned and remained in the United States Reserve Fleet until 1959, when she was broken up for scrap.

=== USS &quot;Indianapolis&quot; (CA-35) ===
&quot;Indianapolis&quot; served as flagship of Scouting Force 1 during World War II, and saw action in a number of campaigns in the Pacific theater. She supported the Gilbert and Marshall island campaigns as well as operations off the Caroline Islands. Later in the war she fought in the Battle of Philippine Sea and later the Battle of Iwo Jima and participating in the Battle of Okinawa.

In mid-1945, she sailed from the United States to Tinian Island carrying components of Little Boy and Fat Man, the two nuclear weapons which would later be used to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Sailing for Leyte unescorted under Captain Charles B. McVay III, she was sunk by on 30 July 1945, sinking in just 12 minutes. Many sailors were killed by sharks after the wreck. An estimated 900 of her 1,197 crew survived the initial sinking, but her SOS signal was not heard, and due to a series of errors and misunderstandings, her loss was not discovered until 2 August when her crew was spotted by reconnaissance plane. Only 320 men were recovered following the sinking, of whom 316 survived. McVay survived and faced a court martial and reprimand but retired in 1949 as rear-admiral, committing suicide in 1968. Following years of efforts by some survivors and others to clear his name, McVay was posthumously exonerated by the 106th United States Congress and President Bill Clinton on 30 October 2000.

<text>Asian Dub Foundation (ADF) is an English electronic music band that combines musical styles including rap rock, dub, dancehall, ragga, ReggaeEDM, and South Asian music. The group also includes traditional rock instruments such as electric bass and guitar, which acknowledges a punk rock influence. Their music is known for its dub-inspired basslines, guitar parts inspired by the traditional Indian instrument the sitar, and fast rapping.

==History==
Asian Dub Foundation (ADF) was formed in summer 1993 from an education workshop run by Aniruddha Das (bass, programming) and assisted by John Pandit (mixing) which was attended by rapper Deeder Zaman. This early line-up released the sound-system based &quot;Conscious&quot; EP in late 1993 on Nation Records. Guitarist/programmer Steve Chandra Savale was invited to join in early 1994 and ADF became more of a band format. Sanjay Tailor joined the band as live midi/programmer and DJ soon after. This completed the full live line-up of the band and their debut album &quot;Facts and Fictions&quot; was released in late 1995, following the single &quot;Rebel Warrior&quot;.

Initially not widely known in a UK music scene focused on Britpop, the band toured in mainland Europe and gained a substantial following, particularly in France where their French-only release &quot;R.A.F.I.&quot; sold 100,000 copies. In early 1997 the band was signed by London Records. Their British profile was upped considerably by the support of Primal Scream with whom the band began to tour regularly. Their second album &quot;Rafi&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1998) combined punk energy with a jungle/reggae core and was nominated for a Mercury Prize. The single &quot;Naxalite&quot; was an ode to the militant Naxalite movement in India. Tours to the United States (with the Beastie Boys) and Japan followed.

Their following album, &quot;Community Music&quot;, developed their sound further and received a 10/10 review in &quot;NME&quot;. In 2000, ADF played a slot on Glastonbury Festival&#x27;s Pyramid stage. At the end of 2000, Deeder Zaman announced his plans to go solo, his last gig being at Alexandra Palace alongside Primal Scream and Ian Brown.

Their first project of 2001 was an attempt to create a live re-score of Mathieu Kassovitz&#x27;s film &quot;La Haine&quot; at the Barbican Centre&#x27;s &quot;Only Connect&quot; festival in London. The gig was sold out and received critical praise, particularly from Max Bell and Steven Wells. They did the piece again by invitation of David Bowie at his South Bank Meltdown Festival in 2002; in attendance was Kassovitz. The band went to Brazil to collaborate with community activist Afro-Reggae with new band members MC Aktarv8tr, Spex MC, Rocky Singh (drums), and Prithpal Rajput (dhol).

In 2002, Pandit G was awarded the MBE for &quot;services to the music industry&quot; in relation to his work with &quot;Community Music&quot;. He declined the award, however, stating:

In 2003, they released &quot;Enemy of the Enemy&quot;, which became their best-selling album and contained the track &quot;Fortress Europe&quot;, an attack on European immigration policy, along with &quot;1000 Mirrors&quot;, a collaboration with Sinéad O&#x27;Connor about a woman serving life for killing an abusive husband. In 2003, they played their biggest gig in front of 100,000 people in France at a celebration of José Bové, a radical campaigning farmer. For 2005&#x27;s &quot;Tank&quot;, they were joined by On-U Sound collaborator Ghetto Priest on vocals, with the help of Adrian Sherwood.

The band continued performing their &quot;La Haine&quot; soundtrack around the world for the next five years. They developed this approach in 2004 with another improvised soundtrack to the film &quot;The Battle of Algiers&quot;, first performing the piece at the Brighton Dome.

In 2005, they won &quot;Best Underground&quot; at the UK Asian Music Awards.

Bassist Dr Das announced his intention to retire in May 2006 to resume teaching and produce his own music. He was replaced by Martin Savale, who also plays bass with British-Asian electro/grunge/hip-hop band Swami.

In September 2006, the dub/punk opera &quot;Gaddafi: A Living Myth&quot;, with music by ADF, opened at the London Coliseum. In Spring 2007, Asian Dub Foundation announced the release of a best of compilation &quot;Time Freeze: The Best of Asian Dub Foundation&quot; which included a bonus disc of rare remixes and live tracks, including a live recording of a Public Enemy song featuring Chuck D. The album also featured a new track recorded with former vocalist Deeder Zaman. In May 2007 ADF performed a radio session and interview on the Bobby and Nihal show on BBC Radio 1 where they performed three new tracks: &quot;Climb On&quot;, &quot;Superpower&quot; and &quot;S.O.C.A.&quot;. In June 2007, they were the only Western act to perform at the Festival of Gnawa music in Essaouira, Morocco playing to a crowd of 60,000 people and collaborating with traditional Gnawa musicians.

In August 2007, Asian Dub Foundation started playing with two new vocalists, Al Rumjen (previously and subsequently with King Prawn) and Aktarv8r, who returned after MC Spex was asked to leave the band due to personal issues. In November/December 2007, Asian Dub Foundation recorded a new album, &quot;Punkara&quot;. It was released in March 2008 and followed by a tour of Europe and Japan.

In 2009, ADF contributed to the Indigenous Resistance project after having met up with the Atenco movement in Mexico. Asian Dub Foundation started work on their new album, provisionally entitled &quot;A New London Eye&quot;, which would feature Ministry of Dhol, Nathan &quot;Flutebox&quot; Lee, Chi 2 and Skrein. The album eventually came out as &quot;The History of Now&quot; and the band toured extensively to promote it. The cover contained many fantasy iPhone &quot;Apps&quot; intended to parody the contemporary age.

In May 2012, the band was asked by immersive pop-up subversives Secret Cinema to revive their live soundtrack to &quot;La Haine&quot; at Broadwater Farm and also performed the piece in Paris the night of the French elections. Later that year ADF were rejoined by Dr. Das, Ghetto Priest and Rocky Singh. They recorded a new album, &quot;The Signal and the Noise&quot;, and headlined a series of festivals including &quot;Bearded Theory&quot; and &quot;Asigiri Jam&quot; in Japan. In 2013, &quot;The Signal and the Noise&quot; was released only in Japan.

In 2014, the band debuted their live soundtrack to &quot;THX 1138&quot;, George Lucas&#x27;s first feature-length film. George Lucas and his collaborator Walter Murch gave their blessing to the project and it was performed at the Brooklyn Festival in Prospect Park which led to an Arts Council Sponsored Tour of the UK in 2015.

In 2015, ADF released &quot;More Signal More Noise&quot; jointly between Believe Records their own ADF Communications imprint. The album was a re-recorded version of the 2013 Japan only release. They were joined in early 2015 by ex-The Prodigy drummer Brian Fairbairn and toured Italy with a revived version of their &quot;La Haine&quot; soundtrack.

They recorded a BBC Radio 6 session for Tom Robinson in 2015 and played headline slots at WOMAD and Boomtown festivals in 2016.

In June 2017, it was announced that the band is working on an upcoming album, titled &quot;Access Denied.&quot;

In May 2019, the band released Youth Quake Pt 1, pairing electronica and breakbeats with a speech that teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg gave to the United Nations conference on climate change in 2018, in support of Extinction Rebellion and the urgent struggle for Climate Justice. The band reissued the album &quot;Rafi&#x27;s Revenge&quot; the same year.

In April 2020, the band released the video for &quot;Stealing the Future&quot;. The track was from the album &quot;Access Denied&quot; that was released in September of the same year. Collaborators on the album include comedian Stewart Lee, Palestinian refugee band 47Soul, Ana Tijoux and Dub FX.

===Campaign for UK singles chart number one===

In September 2020, the band released their song with Stewart Lee called &quot;Comin’ Over Here&quot;. This track was based on a sketch from the BBC programme Stewart Lee&#x27;s Comedy Vehicle, which was a routine about the UKIP politician (and later, party leader) Paul Nuttall. In December 2020, a video for the song was released, which was part of an internet campaign to get the record to number one in time for the chart published by the Official Charts Company on 31 December 2020, thereby making it the &#x27;Brexit Day Number One&#x27;. The song debuted at number 65 on the UK Singles Chart and made it to number 1 on the UK Singles Sales Chart.

<doc id="749940" wikidata="Q1159082" url="?curid=749940" title="Dan Hill">
<text>Daniel Grafton Hill IV (born 3 June 1954) is a Canadian pop singer and songwriter. He had two major international hits with his songs &quot;Sometimes When We Touch&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t We Try&quot;, a duet with Vonda Shepard, as well as a number of other charting singles in Canada and the United States. He also established himself as a songwriter who produced hit songs for artists such as George Benson and Celine Dion.

==Early life==
Hill was born in Toronto, the son of social scientist and public servant Daniel G. Hill and social activist Donna Mae Hill (née Bender, 1928–2018), and older brother of the author Lawrence Hill and the late novelist Karen Hill. His musical talent was apparent from a young age, and he received his first guitar shortly after his tenth birthday. While in high school, he was singing and performing at concerts and coffee houses. At one point Hill was working for the Ontario provincial government sorting mail and delivering supplies, while performing at the Riverboat at night. Before finishing high school, he recorded a demo tape with the assistance of his boyhood friend Matt McCauley, later a well-known composer and arranger. In 1972, he signed a contract with RCA, who released a single the following year but did little to advance his career.

==Career==
Continuing to record with McCauley, he succeeded in breaking the RCA contract and signing with GRT Records, an independent Canadian label. In 1975, they released his first Canadian hit single,&quot;You Make Me Want to Be,&quot; which was followed by his first album, &quot;Dan Hill.&quot;

In 1977, Hill recorded the ballad &quot;Sometimes When We Touch&quot;. He also wrote the lyrics and was assisted in the music by Barry Mann for the album from the same year, &quot;Longer Fuse&quot;, and it was released as a single. It was Hill&#x27;s biggest hit, peaking at No. 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Canadian RPM Singles chart, and leading to Hill&#x27;s appearances on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; and &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;. Tina Turner covered the song in 1978 on her album &quot;Rough&quot;.

Another one of his hit songs was &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Road&quot;, which he recorded for the 1982 action movie &quot;First Blood&quot;. In 1985, he was one of the many Canadian performers to appear on the benefit single &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot; by Northern Lights. Although he had many hits in his native Canada, further singles did not fare as well in the United States, where, after &quot;Let the Song Last Forever&quot; in late 1978, he went almost a decade without cracking any of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s singles charts.

In 1987, Hill returned to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with the Top 40 hit &quot;Can&#x27;t We Try&quot;, a duet with the then-unknown Vonda Shepard (her last name was incorrectly spelled &quot;Sheppard&quot; on the label). It peaked at No. 6 on the Hot 100. He also had a near Top 40 hit with &quot;Never Thought (That I Could Love)&quot;. Both records reached No. 2 on the Adult Contemporary chart and set the stage for Hill to have three more top 10 U.S. AC hits through to 1991&#x27;s &quot;I Fall All Over Again&quot;, though he did not make the Hot 100 again after &quot;Never Thought&quot;.

In 1996, Hill received a Grammy for his role as co-producer on Celine Dion&#x27;s album &quot;Falling Into You&quot;. In 2021, he was to be inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame.

As one of the new Canadian singers and songwriters, such as Bruce Cockburn and Murray McLauchlan, who emerged from the coffeehouses and other small venues during the 1970s, Hill belongs to the generation who achieved a prominent place in Canadian popular culture. In addition to his Grammy for his work on Celine Dion&#x27;s &quot;Falling into You&quot;, he received five Juno Awards and other prestigious awards. A road trip to a Hill concert was the subject of the 1994 Canadian comedy film, &quot;South of Wawa&quot;. Although he has performed less frequently in recent decades, in 2007, he toured with the CBC Radio program &quot;The Vinyl Cafe&quot;.

Hill was a lifelong friend of writer Paul Quarrington, and the two also occasionally performed together as a folk music duo, billed as Quarrington/Hill. The pair&#x27;s final collaboration, a song about death called &quot;Are You Ready&quot;, was completed just ten days before Quarrington&#x27;s death in early 2010, which would be featured in a television documentary, &quot;Paul Quarrington: Life in Music&quot;.

Hill befriended Manny Pacquiao after the boxer sang a version of &quot;Sometimes When We Touch&quot; on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; in 2009. Hill later helped Pacquiao record a version of the song at Capitol Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles.

A summary of his career, published in 2021, added some specifics: &quot;throughout the 1990s, he focused on penning lyrics for some of the most prominent singers of the era, including Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys and Reba McEntire ... he returned to his singer-songwriter roots with the 2020 single &quot;What About Black Lives?&quot; part of the yet-to-be-released studio album &quot;On the Other Side of Here&quot;.
The Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame (CSHF) announced the induction of Dan Hill on February 10, 2021.

==Personal life==
Dan Hill is divorced from Beverly Chapin and is with a new partner. He has one son, David, with his ex-wife. Some sources have incorrectly stated that he was married to American country singer Faith Hill, whose surname comes from her first marriage to an unrelated Nashville record executive also named Daniel Hill.

In early 2009, Hill published &quot;I Am My Father&#x27;s Son: A Memoir of Love and Forgiveness&quot; () which recounts his childhood and his relationship with his prominent father. Like his father, Hill was diagnosed as a diabetic. Hill learned from a doctor before a concert that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.

Hill wrote an article in the 14 February 2008 edition of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; entitled &quot;Every Parent&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;, about the terror he experienced from friends his son brought home. On 14 March 2008, CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;The National&quot; aired an in-depth interview with Hill discussing his son&#x27;s involvement with Toronto gangs.

Hill is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.

<doc id="749942" wikidata="Q372798" url="?curid=749942" title="Polus">
<text>Polus (Greek: Πῶλος, &quot;colt&quot;; fl. c. 5th century BCE) was an ancient Greek philosophical figure best remembered for his depiction in the writing of Plato. He was a pupil of the famous orator Gorgias, and teacher of oratory from the city of Acragas, Sicily.

==Views==
Almost everything that is known about Polus comes from the Socratic dialogues of Plato. He features heavily in the &quot;Gorgias&quot;, a dialogue on the nature of rhetoric. Polus also appears in the &quot;Phaedrus&quot; and the &quot;Theages&quot;. Outside of Plato&#x27;s work, he is also mentioned in Book 1 of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics&quot;.

Much of what is known about Polus comes from Plato&#x27;s &quot;Gorgias&quot;. What we get from this text is a look into Polus&#x27; beliefs about rhetoric. Polus advertises rhetoric as the quick route to the life of a tyrant who can run over others and escape punishment for his crimes. Polus saw rhetoric as the highest of all human arts and thinks that rhetoric is the only knowledge one needs to live well. Polus also saw rhetorical knowledge as a matter of experience rather than an art. Polus believed that experience makes our life to proceed in accordance with art whereas inexperience causes it to proceed in accordance with chance. Digging deeper into the &quot;Gorgias&quot; shows that Polus and Socrates often clash, and that Socrates purposely criticized rhetoric in order to trigger Polus&#x27; shameless defense of rhetoric. Polus is also seen as calling attention to rhetoric for its capacity for injustice. Polus had many philosophical views that did not directly agree with Socrates views. Polus sees rhetorical knowledge as something that comes from experience and sees rhetoric as something that is used for evil and serves a tyrannical desire in one&#x27;s life.

<text>Iziaslav Yaroslavich (; 1024 – 3 October 1078; baptized as &quot;Demetrius&quot;) was Prince of Turov and Grand Prince of Kiev (1054–1068; 1069–1073; 1077–1078).

Iziaslav&#x27;s children Yaropolk and Sviatopolk would rule the Turov Principality. Their authority was mainly challenged by the descendents of Rostislav Vsevolodovich.

==Biography==
Iziaslav was the oldest son of Yaroslav I the Wise by his second wife Ingigerd Olafsdottir. Iziaslav succeeded his father, after Yaroslav&#x27;s oldest child, Vladimir (the only child by Yaroslav&#x27;s first wife), had predeceased his father. Iziaslav was one of the authors of the &quot;Pravda of Yaroslav&#x27;s Descendants&quot; – a part of the first legal code of the &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot;.

He is also credited with the foundation of the Kiev Pechersk Monastery. Prince Iziaslav I of Kiev ceded the whole mountain to Antonite monks who founded a monastery built by architects from Constantinople. According to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, in the early 11th century, Antony, a Greek Orthodox monk from Esphigmenon monastery on Mount Athos, originally from Liubech in the Principality of Chernigov, returned to Rus&#x27; and settled in Kiev as a missionary of the monastic tradition to Kievan Rus&#x27;. He chose a cave at the Berestov Mount that overlooked the Dnieper River and a community of disciples soon grew.

In 1043, his father Yaroslav made an agreement with King Casimir I of Poland that recognized Cherven as part of Kiev. The agreement was sealed with a double marriage: Casimir to Dobronega, Yaroslav&#x27;s sister; and Iziaslav to Gertrude, Casimir&#x27;s sister. From this marriage were born three children: Yaropolk, Mstislav and Sviatopolk. From 1045–1052, Iziaslav reigned as Prince of Turov.

=== First reign (1054–1068) ===
Upon the death of Yaroslav the Wise in 1054, his realm was divided between three of his older sons (Vladimir of Novgorod died before that), Iziaslav, Sviatoslav, and Vsevolod, creating the Yaroslavichi triumvirate that ruled the country for the next 20 years.

In 1060, the triumvirate campaigned together in the steppes against the Oghuz.

=== Rebellion of Vseslav of Polotsk (1065–1069) ===
In 1065, their cousin Vseslav, who was the prince of Polotsk, besieged Pskov, but was defeated. In the winter of 1066–1067, he also attacked Novgorod. The prince of Novgorod at the time was Iziaslav&#x27;s son Mstislav, who fled for Kiev. In response, the triumvirate marched up to take out Vseslav. Their first stop was the town of Minsk, whose people reportedly shut themselves into the town. However, the triumvirate managed to take Minsk and met Vseslav at the Nemiga river. On 3 March 1067, the two armies faced off at the Battle on the Nemiga River. Ultimately, the triumvirate was victorious and Vseslav fled. On 10 June, there was a formal truce between the two parties and Iziaslav invited Vseslav to his camp, but it was a trap. Vseslav and his two sons were arrested and brought to Kiev.

In 1068, the Cumans defeated the triumvirate at the Alta river, which dangerously exposed some major cities, including Kiev. Sviatoslav went to Chernigov, while Iziaslav and Vsevolod went to Kiev. On September 15, a veche met in Kiev that encouraged Iziaslav to fight the invaders, but he refused to even negotiate. The Kievans decided that if he wasn&#x27;t going to send them, maybe another prince would, and started a popular uprising against him. Part of that uprising was that they freed Vseslav from his captivity and acclaimed him as their new prince. Iziaslav fled to Poland to get aid from Boleslaw II and marched back to reclaim the city. However, Vseslav didn&#x27;t want to rule Kiev, so he fled in the night, leaving the people of the city with no leader to face Iziaslav and his Polish allies. Sviatoslav and Vsevolod asked him to show restraint, so he sent his son Mstislav, former prince of Novgorod, to blind and kill the important people. Iziaslav was received back in Kiev by 2 May 1069.

=== Second reign (1069–1073) ===
His brother Sviatoslav had gained more power from the whole affair. He was the one who defeated the Cumans in autumn of the previous year and even captured their leader while Iziaslav was off in Poland. During that time, Sviatoslav even installed his own son, Gleb, as the new prince of Novgorod. Iziaslav&#x27;s son Mstislav got Polotsk instead, though after his death in 1069 it went to his brother Sviatopolk. Unfortunately for Iziaslav, Sviatopolk was expelled from the city by Vseslav in 1071 who returned to ruling it, leaving Iziaslav&#x27;s family with nothing to show for losing Novgorod.

In 1072, the triumvirate presided over the celebration of the sanctity of Boris and Gleb, which involved the transfer of their relics to a new church in Vyshgorod.

=== Exile in Poland (1073–1076) ===
By 1073, Iziaslav had alienated so many people that Sviatoslav and Vsevolod drove him out of Kiev on 22 March in a seemingly bloodless coup. He once again went to Poland, but this time Boleslaw took his bribes and didn&#x27;t give him any aid. In January of 1075, he showed up at the court of King Henry IV of Germany in Mainz to ask for help, but Henry didn&#x27;t immediately provide aid, instead sending an emissary to Kiev for more information. At the same time, Iziaslav sent his son Yaropolk to Rome to ask for the support of Pope Gregory VII.

=== Third reign (1077–1078) ===
Luckily for Iziaslav, Sviatoslav died in 1076 and he was able to return to Kiev on 15 July 1077 to once again rule. A conflict broke out after Sviatoslav&#x27;s death about the rightful succession to Chernigov. Iziaslav and Vsevolod drove out Sviatoslav&#x27;s son Oleg in April 1078. That summer, Oleg&#x27;s brother Gleb, who was still ruling Novgorod, was driven out, killed, and replaced with Iziaslav&#x27;s son Sviatopolk. But around the same time, Oleg got support from the Cumans and his cousin Boris, and came back to claim Chernigov. Oleg and Boris defeated Vsevolod in August and Vsevolod came to Kiev to ask Iziaslav for support. He agreed, but died in battle against Oleg on 3 October 1078. He was the only incumbent Grand Prince of Kiev to be killed in battle.

== Children ==
Iziaslav had the following children with Gertrude:
* Yaropolk
* Mstislav (?–1069), was a Prince of Novgorod (1054–1067) which he lost to Vseslav of Polotsk. He had a son Rostislav Mstislavich that died in 1093.
* Eupraxia, may have been married to Mieszko Bolesławowic, son of Bolesław II the Bold in 1088.
* Sviatopolk ΙΙ grand prince of Kiev.

<text>Henry Wise (bapt. 4 September 1653 – 15 December 1738) was an English gardener, designer, and nurseryman. He was apprenticed to George London, working at Brompton Nursery, on the present site of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. The two later worked as partners on parterre gardens at Hampton Court, Chelsea Hospital, Longleat, Chatsworth, Melbourne Hall, Wimpole Hall and Castle Howard, drawing inspiration from engravings of contemporary garden designs in France and the Netherlands.

Wise and London translated into English two well-known French texts on gardening. The resulting work was titled &quot;The Retir&#x27;d Gard&#x27;ner, in Two Volumes: the Whole Revis&#x27;d, with Several Alterations and Additions, Which Render It Proper for Our English Culture.&quot; The book was printed in London in 1706 and went through several printings thanks to its popularity.

Kensington Gardens were laid out by Henry Wise and Charles Bridgeman with fashionable features including the Round Pond, formal avenues and a sunken Dutch garden.

Queen Anne and King George I both appointed him to the post of Royal Gardener. Although the Brompton nursery passed into other hands, Wise retained the house, Brompton Park. His will, in 1734, directed his heir to remove all the pictures remaining at Brompton to his house at Warwick.

Wise became wealthy through his gardening endeavours and purchased the manor of The Priory, Warwick. He purchased the estate and the mansion and retired there as a country squire in 1727. Henry Wise died at The Priory on 15 Dec 1738, said to be worth some £200,000 – far more, probably, than some of his clients.

The writer and garden designer Stephen Switzer trained with London and Wise.

<text>Henry Alexander Wise (December 3, 1806 – September 12, 1876) was an American attorney, diplomat, politician and slave owner from Virginia. As the 33rd Governor of Virginia, Wise served as a significant figure on the path to the American Civil War, becoming heavily involved in the 1859 trial of abolitionist John Brown. After leaving office in 1860, Wise also led the move toward Virginia&#x27;s secession from the Union in reaction to the election of Abraham Lincoln and the Battle of Fort Sumter.

In addition to serving as governor, Wise represented Virginia in the United States House of Representatives from 1833 to 1844 and was the United States Minister to Brazil during the presidencies of John Tyler and James K. Polk. During the American Civil War, he was a general in the Confederate States Army. In politics, Wise was consecutively a Jacksonian Democrat, a Whig supporter of the National Bank, a dissident Whig supportive of President Tyler, a Democratic secessionist, and a Republican supporter of President Ulysses S. Grant during Reconstruction. His sons Richard Alsop Wise and John Sergeant Wise both also served in the Confederate Army and the post-war United States House as Republicans. After the Civil War ended, Wise accepted that slavery had been abolished and advocated a peaceful national reunification.

==Early life==
Wise was born in Drummondtown in Accomack County, Virginia, to Major John Wise and his second wife Sarah Corbin Cropper; their families had long been settled there. Wise was of English and Scottish descent. He was privately tutored until his twelfth year, when he entered Margaret Academy, near Pungoteague in Accomack County. He graduated from Washington College (now Washington &amp; Jefferson College) in 1825. He was a member of the Union Literary Society at Washington College.

After attending Henry St. George Tucker&#x27;s Winchester Law School, Wise was admitted to the bar in 1828. He settled in Nashville, Tennessee, in the same year to start a practice, but returned to Accomack County in 1830.

==Marriage and family==
Wise was considered a dependable family man. He was married three times. He was first married in 1828 to Anne Jennings, the daughter of Rev. Obadiah Jennings and Ann Wilson of Washington, Pennsylvania. In 1837, Anne and one of their children died in a fire, leaving Henry with four children: two sons and two daughters.

Wise married a second time in November 1840 to Sarah Sergeant, the daughter of U.S. Representative John Sergeant (Whig-Pennsylvania) and Margaretta Watmough of Philadelphia. Sarah gave birth to at least five children. She died of complications, along with her last child, soon after its birth on October 14, 1850. Sarah&#x27;s sister Margaretta married George G. Meade, who was a major general for the Union in the American Civil War.

In the nineteen years of marriage to his first two wives, Wise fathered fourteen children; seven survived to adulthood.

Henry married a third time to Mary Elizabeth Lyons in 1853. After serving as governor, Wise settled with Mary and his younger children in 1860 at Rolleston, an plantation which he bought from his brother John Cropper Wise, who also continued to live there. It was located on the Eastern Branch Elizabeth River near Norfolk, Virginia. The property was first owned and developed by William and Susannah Moseley, English immigrants who settled there in 1649. Their descendants owned the property into the 19th century.

After Wise entered Confederate service, he and his family abandoned Rolleston in 1862 as U.S. Army soldiers took over Norfolk. Wise arranged for his family to reside in Rocky Mount, Franklin County, Virginia. After the Civil War, Henry and Mary Wise lived in Richmond, where he resumed his legal career.

Henry A. Wise served as a U.S. Representative from 1833 to 1844. He was elected Representative in 1832 as a Jackson Democrat. To settle this election, Wise successfully fought a duel with his opponent. Wise was re-elected in 1834, but then broke with the Jackson administration over the rechartering of the Bank of the United States. He became a Whig but was sustained by his constituents. Wise was re-elected as a Whig in 1836, 1838, and 1840.

While in Congress, Wise was the &quot;faithful&quot; opponent of John Quincy Adams in the latter&#x27;s attempt to end the gag rule and force Congress to respond to the many petitions asking it to end slavery in the District of Columbia. Adams described Wise in his diary as &quot;loud, vociferous, declamatory, furibund, he raved about the hell-hound of abolition&quot;.

On February 24, 1838, Wise served as the second to William J. Graves of Kentucky during the latter&#x27;s duel with Jonathan Cilley of Maine at the Bladensburg Dueling Grounds, in which Cilley was mortally wounded. He later wrote an account of the event that was published by his son John in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; in 1906.

In 1840 Wise was active in securing the nomination and election of John Tyler as Vice President on the Whig ticket. Tyler succeeded to the presidency and then broke with the Whigs. Wise was one of a small group of Congress members, known derisively as the &quot;Corporal&#x27;s Guard,&quot; who supported Tyler during his struggles with the Whigs and was re-elected as a Tyler Democrat in 1842. Tyler nominated Wise three times as U.S. Minister to France, but the Senate did not confirm the nomination.
===U.S. Minister to Brazil===
In 1844, Tyler appointed Wise as U.S. Minister (ambassador) to Brazil. Wise resigned as Representative to take up this office. He served from 1844 to 1847. Two of his children were born in Rio de Janeiro. In Brazil, Wise worked on issues related to trade and tariffs, Brazilian concerns about the US annexation of Texas, and establishing diplomatic relations with Paraguay. (Wise supported the annexation of Texas by the United States. Wise County, Texas, was named in his honor.)

===Return to Virginia and slavery===
Wise returned to Virginia after leaving his minister post in Brazil. While in Brazil, Wise condemned the slave trade between the U.S. and Brazil. He thought it was the work of &quot;hypocritical Yankees&quot; and against American law. With such harsh criticism, he had given up his usefulness as a U.S. minister and was withdrawn. The Brazilian government practically kicked him out of office.

After Wise returned to Virginia, he planned to sell the people he enslaved. In 1849, Wise bought 19 people, one shy of planter status, and considered them his &quot;children&quot; and &quot;responsibility&quot;. He knew that farming was not profitable in soil-depleted Virginia. Nevertheless, rather than emancipation, Wise intended to profit from selling the people he enslaved to California after gold had been discovered there in 1849. An enslaved person in Virginia was worth $1,000, but in California, an enslaved person would be worth $3,000 to $5,000 digging gold. Wise&#x27;s plan, however, was thwarted when California joined the United States as a free state in the Compromise of 1850.

Wise&#x27;s plantation comprised 400 acres, and only about half were productive. Wise grew corn, oats, and sweet potatoes. Wise also raised livestock and maintained peach and pear orchards. His farm most likely profited $500 a year.

===Governor of Virginia===
Wise returned to the United States in 1847 and resumed legal practice. He identified with the Jacksonian Democratic Party and was active in politics. A delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850, Wise opposed any reforms, insisting that the protection of slavery came first. In the statewide election of 1855, Wise was elected Governor of Virginia as a Democrat, defeating Know-Nothing candidate Thomas S. Flournoy. He was the 33rd governor of Virginia, serving from 1856 to 1860, and the last Eastern Shore governor until Ralph Northam was elected in 2017. Wise County, Virginia, was named after him when it was established in 1856.

Although he was visibly and unapologetically a defender of slavery, he opposed the imposition of the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution on Kansas Territory, as residents of Kansas had not approved it: &quot;And why impose this Constitution of a minority on a majority? &quot;Cui bono?&quot; [&quot;Who would that benefit?&quot;] Does any Southern man imagine that this is a practicable or sufferable way of making a slave State?&quot; This stance played a large role in scuttling his preparations for a bid to challenge incumbent Robert M.T. Hunter in the Senate election in 1858, as Hunter was a supporter of the Lecompton Constitution.

Under the Virginia Constitution, governors cannot serve successive terms, so he was not a candidate for reelection in 1860.

===John Brown===

Wise was intensely interested in the case of John Brown, who briefly assaulted the town of Harpers Ferry. Wise refers several times to the need to &quot;avenge the insulted honor of the state&quot;. He said he found it humiliating that Brown&#x27;s ragtag group could take Harpers Ferry, Virginia, and hold it for even one hour. He traveled from Richmond to Harpers Ferry immediately and interviewed him at length. After returning to Richmond, in a widely reported speech, he praised Brown, but he also called Brown and his men &quot;murderers, traitors, robbers, insurrectionists,&quot; and &quot;wanton, malicious, unprovoked felons.&quot;

However, Governor Wise did many things to augment rather than reduce tensions: by insisting he was tried in Virginia and turning Charles Town into an armed camp full of state militia units. &quot;At every juncture he chose to escalate rather than pacify sectional animosity.&quot;

Some sources say that Wise signed John Brown&#x27;s death warrant, but this is incorrect; under Virginia law, the governor did not need to sign such a document, as Wise pointed out. After Brown was sentenced to death, Wise could have commutated his sentence to life imprisonment, as was recommended to him by many people. The efforts to pressure Wise became so intense that, according to the &quot;Richmond Enquirer&quot;, he was offered the presidency in exchange for a pardon. An unsigned letter from &quot;a Green Mountain Boy&quot; threatened Wise with assassination if Brown was executed, and there was an unfunded project to kidnap Wise and sequester him at sea, on a boat, until Brown was released.

One option Wise considered was to find Brown insane, which would have avoided the death penalty and sent him to an insane asylum. He had been given 19 affidavits from relatives and friends about the alleged madness of Brown and several of his relatives. This would have de-escalated the crisis, not turning Brown into abolition&#x27;s martyr and hero, as he immediately became. However, after his interview with Brown in the engine house, Wise had said publicly that Brown was not insane at all. Before the trial, Brown had insisted that he did not want an insanity defense.

The prevailing political sentiment in Virginia was against de-escalation and strongly in favor of executing Brown. Wise was emerging as a national figure and had presidential ambitions. To take any action that would have prevented Brown&#x27;s execution would have damaged Wise politically more than it could have helped him. On the contrary, the popularity Wise gained in the South for executing Brown, and the other captured members of his party led to Southern support for him as a presidential candidate in 1860. Advertisements promoting Wise as a presidential candidate started to appear immediately after Brown&#x27;s execution.

John Brown&#x27;s body had to pass through Philadelphia on the way to his burial site at the John Brown Farm, near Lake Placid, New York. As this provoked indignation among the many Southern medical students studying there, Wise sent them a telegram, assuring them of a hearty welcome if they came to Richmond or other Southern cities to complete their education. So many accepted that there was a special train to take two hundred of them from Philadelphia to Richmond, where they were addressed by Wise and enjoyed an elegant banquet.

===Secession crisis===
In 1857, during the incoming Presidency of James Buchanan, Wise served as one of Buchanan&#x27;s chief Southern advisors. Other Southern advisors to Buchanan included Senator John Slidell of Louisiana and Robert Tyler of Virginia. Tyler was the son of President John Tyler. Buchanan, although a Pennsylvania Democrat, held Southern sympathies, was a strict constructionist and detested abolitionists and &quot;Black Republicans&quot;. 

During the secession crisis of 1860–61, Wise was a fervent advocate of immediate secession by Virginia. He was a member of the Virginia secession convention of 1861. Frustrated with the convention&#x27;s inaction through mid-April, Wise helped plan actions by Virginia state militia to seize the Federal Arsenal at Harpers Ferry and the Gosport Navy Yard in Norfolk. These actions were not authorized by the incumbent Governor Letcher or the militia&#x27;s commanders.

These plans were pre-empted by the bombardment of Fort Sumter on April 12–14 and Lincoln&#x27;s call on April 15 for troops to suppress the rebellion. After a further day and a half of the debate, the convention voted for secession 85 representatives in favor and 55 against. On April 17, during the latter stage of the debate, Wise irrupted into the debate a gun in hand, declared Virginia was now at war with the United States, and that he would kill anyone who would try to shoot him for treason.

===Electoral history===
* 1843: Wise was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives with 57.24% of the vote, defeating Whig Hill
* 1850: Wise was elected delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1850
* 1855: Wise was elected governor of Virginia with 53.25% of the vote, defeating Thomas Stanhope Flournoy.
* 1861: Wise was elected delegate to the Secession Convention of 1861

==Civil War==

After Virginia declared secession, Wise joined the Confederate States Army (CSA). Because of his political prominence and secessionist reputation, he was commissioned as a brigadier general, despite having no formal military training. He was assigned to the western Virginia region, where his political support would be helpful. Brigadier General John B. Floyd, another former governor of Virginia, was also sent there. In the summer of 1861, Wise and Floyd feuded over who was the superior officer. At the height of the feud, General Floyd blamed Wise for the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Carnifex Ferry, stating that Wise refused to come to his aid. The feud was not resolved until Virginia Delegate Mason Mathews, whose son Alexander F. Mathews was Wise&#x27;s aide-de-camp, spent several days in the camps of both Wise and Floyd. Afterward, he wrote to President Jefferson Davis urging that both men be removed. Davis subsequently removed Wise from his command in western Virginia.

In early 1862, Wise was assigned to command the District of Roanoke Island, threatened by U.S. Navy forces. He fell ill with pleurisy and was not present for the Battle of Roanoke Island when U.S. Army soldiers stormed the island. He was blamed for the loss, but for his part, complained bitterly about inadequate forces to defend the island.

He commanded a brigade in the division of Maj. Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes on the New Market Road during the Seven Days Battles. For the rest of 1862 and 1863, he held various commands in North Carolina and Virginia.

In 1864, Wise commanded a brigade in the Department of North Carolina &amp; Southern Virginia. His brigade defended Petersburg and was credited with saving the city at the First Battle of Petersburg and to an extent at the Second Battle of Petersburg. From June 17 until November 1864, Wise commanded the Military District of the City of Petersburg. He resumed command of his brigade in November and led it during the final stages of the Siege of Petersburg.

He was with Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House, where he fought bravely but urged Lee to surrender. With other Confederate officials, he was taken prisoner after the surrender.

==Postwar political statements==
Stating he was &quot;a prisoner on parole&quot;, Wise summarized his view of slavery thus:

The Confederate Constitution adopted on March 11, 1861, banned the international slave trade. However, the Constitution prohibited passing laws that would make illegal &quot;the right of property in negro slaves&quot; so far as the legislature was concerned (Article 1).

==Postbellum activities==

After the war, Wise resumed his law practice in Richmond and settled there for the rest of his life. In 1865 he tried to reclaim Rolleston, his plantation outside Norfolk, but was turned down by General Grant, considering that he did not make the Ironclad Oath. He was told that he had abandoned that residence when he moved his family to another plantation at Rocky Mount, Virginia. The U.S. commander in Norfolk, Maj. Gen. Alfred H. Terry, appropriated it and other plantations for the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau to establish schools for formerly enslaved people and their children. Two hundred freedmen were said to be taking classes at Rolleston. A picture of John Brown had been placed in the parlor. &quot;The officers who confiscated the place found in the house among numerous other papers a plan of secession drawn up by Wise in 1857, and approved by Jeff Davis and several other prominent men In the South.&quot; &quot;It is said that ex-Governor Wise chafes a good deal and even foams at the mouth, because his house is used by old John Brown&#x27;s daughter as a school-house for teaching little niggers.&quot; Another report says that Brown&#x27;s &quot;daughters&quot; were teachers in the school; another says that no daughter was, although one of them was teaching contrabands near Norfolk and visited the mansion.

Wise became a Republican and strong supporter of President Ulysses S. Grant. Unlike many other politicians, he did not emphasize his Confederate service or ever seek a pardon.

While working in his law career, Wise wrote a book based on his public service, entitled &quot;Seven Decades of the Union&quot; (1872).

==Death and legacy==

Wise died in 1876 and was buried at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond.

His son Capt. Obediah Jennings Wise died in 1862 under his father&#x27;s command at Roanoke Island. Another son, Richard, after service in the Confederate Army, studied medicine and taught chemistry. He also became a Virginia legislator and US Representative. A third son, John, served in the Confederate Army as a VMI cadet; he also later became an attorney and was elected as a US Representative. Both Richard Wise and John Wise were Republicans like their father. Another son, Henry A. Wise, Jr. (1834–1869), entered the ministry and assisted family friend Rev. Joshua Peterkin at St. James Episcopal Church in Richmond before resigning in 1859, a decade before his death.

Henry A. Wise&#x27;s grandson Barton Haxall Wise wrote a biography of the former governor, entitled &quot;The Life of Henry A. Wise of Virginia&quot; (New York, 1899). Another grandson, the lawyer and soldier Jennings Cropper Wise (1881–1968, son of John Sergeant Wise), wrote &quot;The Early History of the Eastern Shore of Virginia&quot; and dedicated it to his grandfather. He quoted Governor Wise: &quot;I have met the Black Knight with his visor down, and his shield and lance are broken.&quot;

Counties were named in his honor in Virginia (Wise County, Virginia) and Texas (Wise County, Texas).

==Archival material==
The Wise family papers, 1836-1928 (350 items, available on microfilm), and the Henry A. Wise papers, 1850-1869 (90 items), are held by the Library of Congress. The numerous documents from his service as Governor are in the Library of Virginia.

<text>Stephen Samuel Wise (March 17, 1874 – April 19, 1949) was an early 20th-century American Reform rabbi and Zionist leader in the Progressive Era. Born in Budapest, he was an infant when his family immigrated to New York. He followed his father and grandfather in becoming a rabbi, serving in New York and in Portland, Oregon. Wise was also a founding member of the NAACP.

== Early life ==
Wise was born on March 17, 1874, in Budapest in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the son and grandson of rabbis and their wives. His grandfather, Joseph Hirsch Weiss, was rabbi of Erlau, today known as Eger, and a highly conservative &quot;haredi&quot; scholar. Wise&#x27;s father, Aaron Wise, earned a PhD and ordination in Europe. Wise&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Móric Fischer de Farkasházy, created the Herend Porcelain Company. When Wise&#x27;s father sought to unionize the company, Moric gave the family one-way tickets to New York. In the U.S., Aaron Wise eventually became chief rabbi of the Congregation Rodeph Sholom in New York City, moving from his own father&#x27;s Orthodoxy toward Reform Judaism.

=== Education ===
Stephen Wise attended local public schools. He received his higher education at the College of the City of New York, Columbia College (B.A. 1892, &quot;Cum laude&quot;), and Columbia University (PhD 1902). Later he pursued rabbinical studies under rabbis Richard J. H. Gottheil, Alexander Kohut, Gersoni, Joffe, and Margolis. He was ordained as rabbi by Rabbi Adolph Jellinek of Vienna in 1893. In 1933, Wise received an honorary L.H.D. from Bates College.

== Career ==
In 1893, Wise was appointed assistant rabbi of Congregation B&#x27;nai Jeshurun, Manhattan; its senior rabbi was Henry S. Jacobs. Later in the same year, Wise became the senior rabbi of the same congregation.

In 1900, he was called as rabbi to Congregation Beth Israel in Portland, Oregon. Typical of the activists of the Progressive Era, he attacked &quot;many of the social and political ills of contemporary America.&quot; In 1906, concerning another rabbinical appointment, Wise made a major break from the established Reform movement over the &quot;question whether the pulpit shall be free or whether the pulpit shall not be free, and, by reason of its loss of freedom, reft of its power for good&quot;; in 1907 he established his Free Synagogue, starting the &quot;free Synagogue&quot; movement.

Wise was an early supporter of Zionism. His support for, and commitment to Political Zionism was atypical of Reform Judaism, which had been historically non-Zionist since it adopted the Pittsburgh Platform in 1885. He was a founder of the New York Federation of Zionist Societies in 1897, which led in the formation of the national Federation of American Zionists (FAZ), a forerunner of the Zionist Organization of America. At the Second Zionist Congress (Basel, 1898), Wise was a delegate and secretary for the English language. Wise served as honorary secretary of FAZ, in close cooperation with Theodor Herzl, until the latter&#x27;s death in 1904.

In 1915, Wise was one of the founding members of the American Committee on Armenian Atrocities, which later became Near East Relief. Historian Claire Mouradian states that his activities over thirty years (from the Hamidian massacres to the creation of the Republic of Turkey) &quot;reveal a constant concern for raising awareness in favor of the Armenians, whose fate seemed to be a premonition of what might be awaiting Jews in Europe&quot;.

Joining U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, Felix Frankfurter, and others, Wise laid the groundwork for a democratically elected, nationwide organization of &#x27;ardently Zionist&#x27; Jews, &#x27;to represent Jews as a group and not as individuals&#x27;. In 1917 he participated in the effort to convince President Woodrow Wilson to approve the Balfour declaration in support of Jewish settlement in Mandate Palestine. In 1918, following national elections, this Jewish community convened the first American Jewish Congress in Philadelphia&#x27;s historic Independence Hall.

In December 1925, Wise delivered a sermon about Jesus the Jew, making the case that Jews should view Jesus &quot;as a great moral and ethical teacher, a Jew of whom they might be proud because of his teachings.&quot; This sermon caused an uproar among some Jewish institutions, culminating in an edict of condemnation against him by the Agudath Harabonim, the Union of Orthodox Rabbis. Because of the outcry, Wise resigned from his position as Chairman of the United Palestine Appeal. But he referred to the Orthodox condemnation as &quot;un-Jewish,&quot; and in a statement to the Jewish Telegraph Agency, he protested, &quot;What a mournful commentary upon the infinite hurt which the Jew has suffered at the hands of Christendom, that a Jewish teacher cannot even at this time speak of Jesus... without being hailed as a convert to Christianity or misunderstood by some of his fellow Jews...&quot;

In 1938, as president of the American Jewish Congress, Wise said that adoption of the Alaska proposal in the Slattery Report would deliver &quot;a wrong and hurtful impression ... that Jews are taking over some part of the country for settlement.&quot;

===Friendship with Einstein===
Albert Einstein found Wise&#x27;s mixture of enlightened views and committed Zionism most agreeable, and they became friends when Einstein moved to the US. In a tribute to Wise on his 60th birthday, Einstein said, &quot;Above all, what I admire in him is his bold activity toward building the self-respect of the Jewish people, combined with profound tolerance and penetrating understanding of everything human.&quot;

===Views on Jerome Davis===
During the trial of the sociologist Jerome Davis, Wise stated, based on more than 30 years of acquaintance, that Davis had &quot;never, never&quot; been sympathetic to communism.

=== Public and charitable offices ===
In 1902 Wise officiated as first vice-president of the Oregon State Conference of Charities and Correction. In 1903 he was appointed Commissioner of Child Labor for the State of Oregon, and founded the Peoples&#x27; Forum of Oregon. These activities initiated a lifelong commitment to social justice, stemming from his embrace of a Jewish equivalent of the Social Gospel movement in Christianity.

In &quot;A History of Jews in America&quot; historian Howard Sachar wrote, &quot;In 1914, Professor Emeritus Joel Spingarn of Columbia University became chairman of the NAACP and recruited for its board such Jewish leaders as Jacob Schiff, Jacob Billikopf, and Rabbi Stephen Wise.&quot; 


In 1922 Wise founded the Jewish Institute of Religion, an educational center in New York City to train rabbis in Reform Judaism. It was merged into the Hebrew Union College a year after his death. In 1922 Wise was one of the founding trustees of the Palestine Endowment Funds, Inc., along with Julian Mack.

When the Federation of American Zionists (FAZ) was originally established, Wise was appointed the position secretary. After the organization transformed into the Zionist Organization of America, Rabbi Wise fulfilled positions as both president and vice president during his lifetime.

Wise was a close friend of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who turned to Wise for advice on issues concerning the Jewish community in the United States. In addition, Wise had also acted a liaison to previous President Wilson.

At the 1924 Democratic National Convention, he was a delegate from New York; at the opening of the sixth session on June 28, 1924, he offered the invocation. During the 1928 campaign, Wise was a prominent supporter of Democrat Al Smith.

In 1925 Wise became chairman of Keren Hayesod, while continuing efforts to bring the Reform movement around to a pro-Zionist stance. With the rise to power of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s regime, Wise took the position that public opinion in the United States and elsewhere should be rallied against the Nazis. He used his influence with President Roosevelt both in this area as well as on the Zionist question.

In 1933 while acting as honorary president of the American Jewish Congress, Wise led efforts for a Jewish Boycott of Germany. He stated &quot;The time for prudence and caution is past. We must speak up like men. How can we ask our Christian friends to lift their voices in protest against the wrongs suffered by Jews if we keep silent? What is happening in Germany today may happen tomorrow in any other land on earth unless it is challenged and rebuked. It is not the German Jews who are being attacked. It is the Jews&quot;. Urged by Wise to protest to the German government, U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull issued a mild statement to the American ambassador to Berlin complaining that &quot;unfortunate incidents have indeed occurred and the whole world joins in regretting them.&quot;

Wise, along with Leo Motzkin and Nahum Goldmann, encouraged the creation in August 1936 of the World Jewish Congress in order to create a broader representative body to fight Nazism. Wise served as founding president of the World Jewish Congress president until his death in 1949. He was succeeded by his friend Nahum Goldmann.

=== Holocaust awareness ===
Given his position as an influential and highly visible leader of the American Jewish community, Wise was inevitably caught up in the dilemmas facing American policy-makers and Jewish activists when awareness began to grow of the systematic efforts by the Nazi regime to exterminate European Jewry.

Wise&#x27;s steady nine-year campaign to publicly expose Nazi atrocities against Jews had borne little practical fruit. Roosevelt was reluctant to spend political capital on behalf of foreign refugees, and access to visas and other paths of escape were effectively blocked by the assistant Secretary of State Breckenridge Long, an admirer of Hitler and Mussolini.

As early information of the full scale of the Nazi slaughter began to emerge from Europe, Jews in the U.S. and other countries were cast into an agonizing debate about how, and whether, to press governments to take steps to save them.

On August 8, 1942, Gerhart M Riegner, then representative of the World Jewish Congress in Geneva, sent a cable (now known as the Riegner Telegram) to British and American diplomatic contacts, informing the Allies for the first time about the full official Nazi plans.

Riegner asked that Stephen Wise be made aware of the cable&#x27;s contents. But U.S. State Department officials did not pass it along. Wise was not informed about the telegram until Riegner sent him another cable directly, almost three weeks later, on August 29. &quot;Received alarming report,&quot; the cable read, &quot;that in Fuhrers headquarters plan discussed and under consideration all Jews in countries occupied or controlled Germany number 3-1/2 to 4 million should after deportation and concentration in east should at one blow exterminated to resolve once for all Jewish question in Europe.&quot; This was precisely the plan that the Nazi regime was putting into motion.

Wise, innocent of the State Department&#x27;s earlier receipt of the same news, passed this warning along to his government contacts. And, as was his general policy, refrained from speaking out about the reports of mass slaughter until they had been fully vetted by the State Department.

It was almost four months before U.S. Under-secretary of State Sumner Welles confirmed to Wise that the Riegner Telegram&#x27;s information was accurate. Wise then held a press conference in Washington, D.C. On November 24, 1942, and announced that the Nazis had a plan for the extermination of all European Jews, and that the number of Jews murdered had already reached 2 million.

During the war years, Wise was elected co-chair of the American Zionist Emergency Council, a forerunner of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.

Wise was an ardent opponent of the post-war efforts by Isaac Nachman Steinberg, co-founder of the Freeland League, to create a community for Jewish refugees in Suriname. In a letter to Keren Hayesod emissary Ida Silverman he wrote, &quot;I personally believe, that Steinberg needs to be lynched or hanged and quartered, if that would make his lamented demise more certain.&quot;

== Works ==
Wise translated &quot;The Improvement of the Moral Qualities&quot;, an ethical treatise of the eleventh century by Solomon ibn Gabirol (New York, 1902) from the original Arabic, and wrote &quot;The Beth Israel Pulpit&quot;, among other works. He was invited to deliver the annual Charles P. Steinmetz Memorial Lecture at Union College in 1944.

== Criticism ==
Wise&#x27;s liberal Judaism conflicted with the view of Orthodox and Conservative Jews of the time, a dispute that continues through the present. They felt he worked too closely with his government and was too cautious in accepting and publicizing the early reports of the Holocaust.

Holocaust scholar Dr. David Kranzler, author of &quot;Orthodoxy&#x27;s Finest Hour,&quot; wrote in 2002 that Wise had a &quot;penchant for protecting his close friend and confidant US President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) regardless of the cost to the Jews of Europe.&quot; Kranzler accused Wise of failing to recognize the existential threat to European Jewry prior to American entry into World War II, dismissing early reports of the Final Solution as propaganda, and obstructing rescue efforts.

Kranzler also suggested that Wise did not voluntarily publicize the Holocaust after the Riegner cable, but rather that he was pressured into going public by the American Orthodox Jewish community, who confronted him after receiving what is known as the Sternbuch Report on September 2, 1942. Kranzler wrote that Wise declined to publicize these reports until after the U.S. State Department had formally confirmed their accuracy, almost three months later. Kranzler complained that &quot;Every time a unified committee for rescue was organized which was not entirely under Wise’s control, he would force the committee to dissolve.&quot;

1940s screenwriter and Jewish activist Ben Hecht had been recruited to the inner circle of the Zionist movement known as the Bergson Group. This was a committee led by Zionist Hillel Kook, who in his interactions with Americans favored the less alien-sounding alias Peter Bergson. Bergson and his team were members of the Irgun, a radical faction of Zionists who favored direct action over slow diplomatic negotiation. Bergson&#x27;s original mission in the U.S. was to seek American help in creating an armed Jewish force to fight in the war. In 1942, after Bergson read the news stories of Stephen Wise&#x27;s November 24 press conference, he pivoted into a full-bore fight to combat the slaughter of European Jews.

The Bergson Group&#x27;s stance on European Jewry was opposed to Wise&#x27;s: they believed their actions would save more Jews from the Nazi Holocaust. Most American Jewish institutions sided with Wise; Bergson and Wise jockeyed for influence over U.S. policy.

As part of his collaboration with Bergson, Hecht created a giant pageant publicizing the Holocaust called &quot;We Will Never Die&quot; which debuted at Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1943. Hecht recruited show-business friends like Kurt Weill and Moss Hart to write and stage his pageant, and to raise public awareness of the Nazis&#x27; mass murder of Jews as stridently as possible. As plans for the show accelerated, a disgruntled Hecht wrote that he was abruptly contacted by Wise:

Wise was successful in preventing some performances, but not the national broadcast, of &quot;We Will Never Die&quot;.

In the 2002 book &quot;A Race Against Death: Peter Bergson, America, and the Holocaust&quot;, David Wyman and Rafael Medoff argued that Wise hindered the Holocaust rescue attempts of the Bergson Group and others.

Well after the war Hillel Kook was interviewed in Manhattan by David Kranzler and said that he was considered by Wise to be a betrayer of Zionism since he was willing to save Jews by finding safety for them anywhere in the world, not only in Palestine. That was seen as competition with Zionism. Wise&#x27;s position was that the Zionist cause is foremost. He stated in the Sol Blum led fall 1943 Congressional hearing investigating Hillel Kook that Jews should be saved (only) &quot;by opening the gates to Palestine&quot;, which doomed multitudes to a terrible fate, including being murdered. This ideology was shared by the then dominant Zionist leadership.

Historian Saul Friedländer said that Wise prevented the shipment of food packages from American Jews to German-occupied Poland for fear that the Allies would interpret the aid as being sent to the enemy. Unlike Wise, Friedländer believed that the Nazis were distributing aid packages to the concentration camps and ghetto Jews. In the spring of 1941, Rabbi Wise contacted the World Jewish Congress representatives in Europe to halt forthwith any shipment of packages to the ghettos. &quot;All these operations with and through Poland must cease at once,&quot; Wise cabled to Congress delegates in London and Geneva, &quot;and at once in English means AT ONCE, not in the future.&quot;&quot; 

Nachum Goldman, a high level executive of the World Jewish Congress and close to Wise, went to the US State Department and according to the protocol, a copy of which is in &quot;A Race Against Death: Peter Bergson, America, and the Holocaust&quot;, pleaded for deporting Kook or drafting him into the army for the war, which may well have led to his demise.
In spite of the above, there is a street named for Wise in Jerusalem at a very prestigious location - right by the Israel Museum, the National Library and very near the Knesset. There is also a plaque installed by the Jerusalem municipality and the World Jewish Congress at the house where Goldman sometimes resided (Ahad Ha Am street) and he was given the highest Zionist and Jewish leadership position after the war at the World Jewish Congress, World Zionist Organization, Jewish Agency.

== Personal life ==
Wise married Louise Waterman. The couple had two children: writer James Wise (1901–1983); and Judge Justine Wise Polier (1903–1987).

Wise died on April 19, 1949, in New York City, aged 75. He is interred in an unmarked mausoleum in Westchester Hills Cemetery located in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.

The Stephen Wise Free Synagogue, which he founded in 1907 and served as Rabbi until his death, is named after him, as is Stephen S. Wise Temple in Los Angeles, which was founded by Rabbi Isaiah Zeldin in 1964. A street is named after him in Jerusalem next to the Israel Museum, and others in Haifa, Rishon LeZion and Petah Tikvah.

<doc id="749956" wikidata="Q318362" url="?curid=749956" title="Johan de Witt">
<text>Johan de Witt (24 September 1625  – 20 August 1672) was a Dutch statesman who was a major political figure during the First Stadtholderless Period, when flourishing global trade in a period of rapid European colonial expansion made the Dutch a leading trading and seafaring power in Europe, commonly referred to as the Dutch Golden Age. De Witt was elected Grand Pensionary of Holland, and together with his uncle Cornelis de Graeff, he controlled the Dutch political system from around 1650 until the (Disaster Year) of 1672. This progressive cooperation between the two statesmen, and the consequent support of Amsterdam under the rule of De Graeff, was an important political axis that organized the political system within the republic.

As a leading republican of the Dutch States Party, De Witt opposed the House of Orange-Nassau and the Orangists and preferred a shift of power from the central government to the &quot;regenten&quot;. However, the Dutch Republic suffered numerous early defeats in the Rampjaar, due to an alliance of England, France and several German states which planned on invading the Dutch Republic. In the hysteria that followed, he and his brother Cornelis de Witt were blamed and lynched in The Hague, with their corpses at least partially eaten by the rioters. These cannibals were never prosecuted, and some historians claim William of Orange may have incited them.

==Family and early life==
Johan de Witt was a member of the old Dutch De Witt family. His father was Jacob de Witt, an influential regent from the patrician class in the city of Dordrecht, which in the 17th century was one of the most important cities of the dominating province of Holland. De Witt&#x27;s mother was Anna van den Corput (1599–1645), niece of Johannes Corputius, an influential Dutch military leader and cartographer. Johan had an older brother, Cornelis de Witt, who had a steep career in the shadow of Johan de Witt. His uncle Andries de Witt held the position of Grand Pensionary of Holland between 1619 and 1621. Through the marriage of one of his other uncles to Margaretha of Nassau, daughter of Anna Johanna of Nassau-Siegen, De Witt was a distant relative of William of Orange-Nassau. Another relationship connected him to the Tromps, Maarten and his son Cornelis Tromp, both admirals of the Netherlands.

Johan and his older brother Cornelis grew up in a privileged environment in terms of education, his father having as good acquaintances important scholars and scientists, such as Isaac Beeckman, Jacob Cats, Gerardus Vossius, and Andreas Colvius. Johan and Cornelis both attended the Latin school in Dordrecht, which imbued them with the values of the Roman Republic. After attending the Latin school in Dordrecht, Johan de Witt studied at the Leiden University, where he excelled at mathematics and law. He received his doctorate from the University of Angers in 1645. He practised law in The Hague as an associate with the firm of Frans van Schooten.

==Marriage and children==

In 1655 Johan de Witt married Wendela Bicker, daughter of Johan Bicker and Agneta de Graeff van Polsbroek, who belonged to the inner circle of the powerful Amsterdam oligarchy. Through his marriage, De Witt became a relative of the ruling patrician families Bicker, De Graeff, Hooft, Witsen, Boelens Loen, and Reynst among others. His brothers-in-law also included Amsterdam patrician Pieter de Graeff (who was also his full cousin), high official Gerard Bicker (I) van Swieten, arms dealer Jacob Trip and banker and financier Jean Deutz, all important and loyal political allies of De Witt. Frans Banninck Cocq (captain of Rembrandt&#x27;s famous painting &quot;The Night Watch&quot;) became his uncle-in-law and Joachim Irgens von Westervick (between 1666 and 1675 owner of the private Irgens Estate, which was a huge part of Northern Norway) his cousin-in-law as well. Johan and Wendela had four children, three daughters and one son:
# Anna de Witt (1655–1725), married to Herman van den Honert 
# Agnes de Witt (1658–1688), married to Simon Teresteyn van Halewijn
# Maria de Witt (1660–1689), married to Willem Hooft
# Johan de Witt Jr. (1662–1701), secretary of the city of Dordrecht; married to Wilhelmina de Witt, the daughter of his uncle Cornelis de Witt

After De Witt&#x27;s death, Pieter de Graeff, husband of his wife Wendela&#x27;s younger sister Jacoba Bicker, became the guardian of his children.

==Politics==
In 1650 (the year that stadtholder William II, Prince of Orange died) he was appointed leader of the deputation of Dordrecht to the States of Holland and West Friesland. In December 1650, De Witt became the pensionary of Dordrecht as the successor of Nicolaas Ruys. In 1652, at the age of 27, De Witt was faced with a mob of angry demonstrators of sailors and fishermen in the city of Vlissingen. He held this position until July 1653 and was succeeded by Govert van Slingelandt, a distant relative of his.

===Elected Grand Pensionary===

In July 1653, the States of Holland elected De Witt Grand Pensionary. In making the appointment, De Witt relied on the express consent of Amsterdam headed by burgomaster and regent Cornelis de Graeff. The States of Holland chose him with the express intercession of his later uncle De Graeff. Since Holland was the Republic&#x27;s most powerful province, he was effectively the political leader of the United Provinces as a whole, especially during periods when no stadholder had been elected by the States of most Provinces. The &quot;raadpensionaris&quot; of Holland was often referred to as the Grand Pensionary by foreigners as he represented the preponderant province in the Union of the Dutch Republic. He led the States of the province by his experience, tenure, familiarity with the issues, and use of the staff at his disposal. He was in no manner equivalent to a modern Prime Minister.

Representing the province of Holland, De Witt tended to identify with the economic interests of the shipping and trading interests in the United Provinces. These interests were largely concentrated in the province of Holland, and to a lesser degree in the province of Zeeland.

====Political goals====
As leader of the state-oriented party, Johan de Witt pursued the interests of the Dutch patricians and merchants. He had his most important goals formulated in 1662 by his like-minded Pieter de la Court in the book &quot;The Interest of Holland&quot;. They were:
# Peaceful foreign policy, since every war weighed on the economy. De la Court went so far as to suggest replacing the lion in the Dutch coat of arms with a cat.
# Greatest possible autonomy for Holland and distance from the other six provinces, since these were a burden on rich Holland. De la Court suggested digging a huge ditch to mark the separation, but this was meant to be satirical.
# Permanent disempowerment of the Princes of Orange, since their dynastic ambitions ran counter to the sober interests of the merchants.

====Relationship with Cornelis de Graeff====

At the height of the Dutch Golden Age, the First Stadtholderless Period from 1650 to 1672, political power within Holland rested primarily with two pro-state minded, republican, families. At Amsterdam, this lay with the brothers Cornelis and Andries de Graeff, and at The Hague with the brothers Johan and Cornelis de Witt, leaders of the pro-state (republican) faction of Holland, reinforced by their close collaboration and mutual kinship.

Domestically, Johan de Witt relied on political cooperation with the Dutch cities, and above all with Amsterdam. In doing so, De Witt recognized the political power of his uncle burgomaster Cornelis de Graeff, and did his best to accommodate Amsterdam&#x27;s wishes. De Witt needed his political advice, the support of the Amsterdam government under De Graeff and his clientele, but he also enjoyed his clear mind and humane frankness. De Graeff combined a clear mind, extensive education and the ability to give and take. In one respect, however, he differed from his uncle, for although De Witt was a supporter of liberty like him, in contrast to him he clung to the extreme, which was to prove to be a fatal error in the &quot;Rampjaar&quot; 1672. The relationship between these two distinct characters was a combination of close kinship and mutual respect. De Graeff was a political equal to De Witt like no other. From then on, De Graeff was at his side as an experienced and trusted councilman. De Witt&#x27;s letters to De Graeff testify to the great trust that the nephew had in his uncle in political and family matters (a short exchange of letters from the year 1660 bears witness to this). That did not rule out a fight between the two. Nevertheless, the relationship remained excellent. De Witt understood the remark of Cornelis de Vlaming van Oudshoorn, another Amsterdam burgomaster, &quot;dat zonder den heer van Zuidpolsbroek&quot; [De Graeff] &quot;in niets iets te doen was&quot; (that without the Lord of Zuid-Polsbroek nothing could be done anywhere).

===Leading statesman===

De Witt&#x27;s power base was the wealthy merchant and patrician class into which he was born. This class broadly coincided politically with the &quot;States faction&quot;, stressing Protestant religious moderation and pragmatic foreign policy defending commercial interests. The &quot;Orange faction&quot;, consisting of the middle class, preferred a strong leader from the Dutch House of Orange as a counterweight against the rich upper-classes in economic and religious matters. Although leaders that did emerge from the House of Orange rarely were strict Calvinists themselves, they tended to identify with Calvinism, which was popular among the middle classes in the United Provinces during this time. William II of Orange was a prime example of this tendency among the leaders of the House of Orange to support Calvinism. William II was elected stadholder in 1647 and continued to serve until his death in November 1650. Eight days after his death, William II&#x27;s wife delivered a male heir, William of Orange. Many citizens of the United Provinces urged the election of the infant William III as a stadholder under a regency until he came of age. However, the Provinces, under the dominance of the province of Holland did not fill the office of stadholder.

When Johan de Witt became de facto leader of the Dutch Republic in 1653, the state was at war with England. The superior English navy blockaded Dutch ports, which triggered a severe economic crisis. De Witt&#x27;s priority was therefore a speedy peace agreement with England. The Lord Protector of England, Oliver Cromwell, demanded as a condition that the House of Orange should be permanently excluded from power in the Dutch Republic. Cromwell&#x27;s motive was that the house supported his opponents, the House of Stuart. De Witt knew that the other six Dutch provinces would not agree to such a dictate. But that changed the exemplary collaboration between De Witt and his influential later uncle Cornelis de Graeff, which was an important factor in the success of De Witt&#x27;s policies and the revival of economic progress after the First Anglo-Dutch War. Together with his De Graeff, De Witt brought about peace with England with the Treaty of Westminster in May 1654. As a result of the positive course of the war for the Netherlands, the Dutch leadership around De Witt, De Graeff, the army commander Johann Wolfart van Brederode and Lieutenant Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam urged the Dutch States General to position themselves as a whole behind the secret Act of Seclusion, which would exclude the young William III from the office of stadtholder. This resolution was drafted by De Graeff in collaboration with De Witt and diplomat Hieronymus van Beverningh.
In the period following the Treaty of Westminster, the Republic grew in wealth and influence under De Witt&#x27;s leadership. In the years that followed, he consistently pursued the commercial interests of his country. In 1658/59 he sent large naval forces to the Baltic Sea to support Denmark against Sweden in the Second Northern War and to ensure free passage for Dutch merchant ships through the Øresund. De Witt created a strong Dutch States Navy, appointing one of his political allies, Lieutenant Admiral Van Wassenaer Obdam, as supreme commander of the Confederate fleet. In these turbulent times of the first governorless period, his trusted councilman, Coenraad van Beuningen, had been a great support to him. One of his brothers-in-law, Jean Deutz, was a trusted advisor on economic matters and financed the wars of the republic under his brother-in-law De Witt.

Despite all these quick political successes, De Witt always presented himself to the outside world as a humble civil servant who walked the streets of The Hague without an escort and with only one servant. According to the English ambassador Sir William Temple, he was outwardly &quot;indistinguishable from the common man&quot;. He himself always emphasized that he had &quot;no decisive vote, authority or power&quot; in the Assembly of States of Holland. But the French ambassador reported to Paris that power in the Netherlands rested with &quot;Monsieur de Witt&quot;.

In 1657, De Witt and De Graeff mediated the &quot;Treaty of Raalte&quot;, in which William III passed the stadholdership of Overijssel.

On 25 September 1660, the States of Holland under the prime movers of De Witt, De Graeff, his younger brother Andries de Graeff, along with Gillis Valckenier, resolved to take charge of William&#x27;s education to ensure he would acquire the skills to serve in a future – although undetermined – state function. Influenced by the values of the Roman republic, De Witt did his utmost anyway to prevent any member of the House of Orange from gaining power, convincing many provinces to abolish the stadtholderate entirely. He bolstered his policy by publicly endorsing the theory of republicanism. He allegedly contributed personally to the &quot;Interest of Holland&quot;, a radical republican textbook published in 1662, by his supporter Pieter de la Court. As a result, De Witt attracted the hatred of all supporters of the Oranges, who were mainly found among the common people.

====War with England, conflict with France====
After the death of Oliver Cromwell in 1658, the English monarchy was restored in 1660 as Charles II of England returned to power. This further deteriorated Anglo-Dutch relations, and five years later the Second Anglo-Dutch War broke out. De Witt reformed the Dutch naval forces by building larger and more heavily armed warships modelled after the English navy. After an initial defeat at the Battle of Lowestoft, he temporarily took command of the Dutch fleet himself. As a remedy for his seasickness, Christiaan Huygens, the inventor of the pendulum clock, developed a special hammock that did not rock. At the end of 1665 Michiel de Ruyter took over command of the Dutch navy at De Witt&#x27;s instigation. Further fighting in 1666 and a massive plague and devastating fire in London caused severe economic difficulties in England. By 1667, the English were unable to put a new fleet to sea, De Witt took advantage of this by having the Dutch navy sail up the River Medway under the command of his brother Cornelis de Witt. At Chatham, Kent, the Dutch burnt several English warships anchored there. Dutch cannon fire was heard in London, causing panic to break out there. England then became ready for peace negotiations, in which De Witt was involved. The peace between the two states was sealed in 1667 with the Peace of Breda.

In 1667, with the support of Gaspar Fagel, Gillis Valckenier and his uncle Andries de Graeff, De Witt issued the Perpetual Edict, which abolished the governorship and thus the final overthrow of the House of Orange. and the incompatibility of a stadtholdership with the Captain Generalship of the Republic of the United Netherlands.

As part of efforts by the States General to contest commercial superiority with England, the Dutch States Army was greatly neglected. This was not without danger because French politics at that time was characterized by unbridled expansionism, which was reinforced by the formidable economic competition of the Dutch Republic. Johan de Witt tried to guarantee the safety of the Republic with a pro-French policy but did not want to agree with King Louis XIV&#x27;s plan to divide the Spanish Netherlands. He preferred a Spanish-administered buffer zone on the southern border of the Republic to a border with powerful France.

The Triple Alliance was concluded on 23 January 1668 with England and Sweden. It stipulated that the three countries would support each other militarily if France attacked one of them. De Witt nevertheless did not want a break with Louis XIV. It was therefore agreed to urge Spain to cede a number of cities in the Spanish Netherlands to him. Only if Louis XIV rejected this and prolonged the War of Devolution to take control of the whole area would the three countries take military force against France. Especially at De Witt&#x27;s request, that last appointment was included in a secret clause because he did not want to offend the French. What De Witt did not know was that Charles II had only entered into the treaty to sever all Dutch-French ties for good. A month after its conclusion, he divulged the details of the secret clause to Louis XIV, who, eager for revenge, concluded the secret Treaty of Dover with England, stipulating that the Dutch Republic would be attacked jointly.

==Death==
During 1672, which the Dutch refer to as the &quot;Rampjaar&quot;, France and England declared war on the Dutch Republic in the Franco-Dutch War. De Witt was severely wounded by a knife-wielding assassin on 21 June. He resigned as Grand Pensionary on 4 August, but this was not enough for his enemies. His brother Cornelis (who was deputy-in-the-field for de Ruyter at the Raid on the Medway), particularly hated by the Orangists, was arrested on trumped-up charges of treason. He was tortured (as was usual under Roman-Dutch law, which required a confession before a conviction was possible) but refused to confess. Nevertheless, he was sentenced to exile. When his brother went over to the jail (which was only a few steps from his house) to help him get started on his journey, both were attacked by members of The Hague&#x27;s civic militia. The brothers were shot and then left to the mob. Their naked, mutilated bodies were strung up on the nearby public gibbet, while the Orangist mob ate their roasted livers in a cannibalistic frenzy. Throughout it all, a remarkable discipline was maintained by the mob, according to contemporary observers, lending doubt as to the spontaneity of the event.

De Witt had in effect ruled the Republic for almost 20 years. His regime outlasted him for only a few more days. Though no more people were killed, the lynching of the De Witts lent renewed impetus to the mob attacks, and to help restore public order the States of Holland empowered William on 27 August to purge the city councils in any way he would see fit to restore public order. The following purges in the early days of September were accompanied by large, but peaceful, Orangist demonstrations, that had a remarkable political character. The demonstrations delivered petitions that demanded certain additional reforms with a, in a sense, &quot;reactionary&quot; flavour: the &quot;ancient&quot; privileges of the guilds and civic militiaswho were traditionally seen as mouthpieces of the citizenry as a wholeto curb the regent&#x27;s powers were to be recognised again (as in pre-Burgundian times). The demonstrators also demanded more influence of the Calvinist preachers on the content of government policies and a roll-back of the toleration of Catholics and other dissenting denominations. The purges of the city governments were not everywhere equally thoroughgoing (and, of course, there was little mention of popular influence later on, as the new regents shared the abhorrence of the old ones of real democratic reforms). But as a whole, the new Orangist regime of the Stadtholder was well-entrenched during his following reign.

Whether William had a hand in the murder of the de Witt brothers remains unanswered, like his exact role in the later Massacre of Glencoe. That he ordered the withdrawal of a federal cavalry detachment that otherwise might have prevented the lynching has always raised eyebrows. He did not prosecute the well-known ringleaders like Johan van Banchem, Cornelis Tromp, and Johan Kievit, even advancing their careers. In any case, the political turmoil did not give the allies an opportunity to finish the Republic off. The French were effectively stymied by the water defences. Only when the inundations froze over in the following winter was there, briefly, a chance for Marshal Luxembourg, who had taken over command of the invading army from Louis, to make an incursion with 10,000 troops on skates. This almost ended in disaster, when they were ambushed. Meanwhile, the States General managed to conclude alliances with the German emperor and Brandenburg, which helped relieve the French pressure in the East.

==Mathematics==

The kinematic description of ellipses dates from Archimedes and Proclus, as well as the contemporary Claude Mydorge. Johan de Witt describes the hyperbola with a rotating line and a sliding angle, and a parabola by means of a rotating angle and sliding line. In 1661, de Witt&#x27;s work appeared in the second volume of von Schooten&#x27;s Latin translation of &quot;La Géométrie&quot;. &quot;Elementa Curvarum Linearum&quot; has been described as the first textbook in analytic geometry.

De Witt contributed to financial mathematics: &quot;The Worth of Life Annuities Compared to Redemption Bonds&quot;. This work combined his roles as a statesman and as a mathematician and was discussed in the correspondence between Leibniz and Bernoulli concerning the use of probabilities. Ever since the Middle Ages, a life annuity was a way to obtain a regular income from a reliable source. The state, for instance, could provide a widow with a regular income until her death, in exchange for a &#x27;lump sum&#x27; up front. There were also redemption bonds that were more like regular state loans. De Witt showed that for the same principal, a bond paying 4% interest would result in the same profit as a life annuity of 6% (1 in 17). But the &#x27;Staten&#x27; at the time were paying over 7% (1 in 14). The publication about life annuities is &quot;one of the first applications of probability in economics.&quot;

<text>The HAL Tejas () is an Indian single-engine, delta wing, multirole combat aircraft designed by the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) and manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the Indian Air Force (IAF) and Indian Navy. Tejas made its first flight in 2001 and entered into service with the IAF in 2015. In 2003, the aircraft was officially named &#x27;Tejas&quot;&#x27;. &quot;Currently, Tejas is the smallest and lightest in its class of supersonic combat aircraft.&quot; &quot;

Tejas is the second jet powered combat aircraft developed by HAL after the HF-24 Marut. The first Tejas squadron became operational in 2016. The No. 45 Squadron IAF - &quot;Flying Daggers,&quot; based at Sulur Air Force Station (AFS) in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, was the first to have their MiG-21 &quot;Bisons&quot; replaced with the Tejas.

Tejas has three production variants - Mark 1, Mark 1A and a trainer/light attack variant. The IAF currently has placed an order for 123 Tejas and is planning to procure 97 more. The IAF plans to procure at least 324 aircraft or 18 squadrons of Tejas in all variants, including the heavier Tejas Mark 2 which is currently being developed.

 the indigenous content in the Tejas Mark 1 is 59.7% by value and 75.5% by the number of line replaceable units. The indigenous content of the Tejas Mk 1A is expected to surpass 70% in the next four years.

==Development==
===LCA programme===
The LCA programme originated in the early 1980s. In 1983, the Government of India established the LCA project with the initial goal to develop a new light combat aircraft to replace the ageing IAF fighters, especially the MiG-21 variants, which had been the mainstay of the IAF since 1963. At one point the IAF had operated as many as 874 MiG-21s. The &quot;Long Term Re-Equipment Plan 1981&quot; noted that most of these IAF fighters were approaching the end of their service lives by the early-1990s, and that by 1995, the IAF would be 40 percent short of the aircraft needed to fill its projected force structure requirements.

In 1984, the Government of India established Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) under the aegis of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to manage the LCA programme. The ADA was entrusted with the design and development of LCA while HAL was chosen as the principal contractor. The government&#x27;s &quot;self-reliance&quot; goals for the LCA included the three most sophisticated and challenging systems: the Fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system, multi-mode pulse-doppler radar, and afterburning turbofan engine.

The project definition phase was commenced in October 1986 with France&#x27;s Dassault-Breguet Aviation as consultant. Dassault-Breguet&#x27;s expertise was mainly utilised in the design and system integration of the Tejas. In 1988, Dassault offered a hybrid fly by wire flight control system for the LCA, consisting of three digital channels and one analogue channel, with a redundant analogue channel as a back up in case the digital channels fails. But the ADA was in favour of a quadruplex digital FBW flight control system.

The design of the Tejas was finalised in 1990 as a small tailless compound delta wing design with relaxed static stability. To provide enhanced manoeuvrability it would be a &quot;control configured vehicle&quot; incorporating a digital FBW flight control system. Kota Harinarayana was the Programme Director and Chief Designer of Tejas. In 1992, a dedicated &quot;National Control Law (CLAW)&quot; team was set up by the National Aerospace Laboratories to develop India&#x27;s own state of the art FBW flight control system for the Tejas. Initially Lockheed Martin&#x27;s consultancy was sought. But it was terminated following a US embargo in response to India&#x27;s second nuclear tests in 1998. This delayed the programme partly by about 18 months. Later India indigenously developed a quadruplex digital fly-by-wire flight control system for Tejas.
The CLAW team completed the design and integration of the flight control laws with the flight control system software, with the aid of an &quot;Iron Bird&quot; test rig. The quadruplex digital fly-by-wire flight control system conducted over 50 hours of pilot testing on Iron Bird Test Rig. On 4 January 2001, on its maiden flight, the TD-1 successfully flew with an indigenous quadruplex digital FBW flight control system. The aerodynamic characterization research was conducted at the National Aerospace Laboratories&#x27; 1.2m Trisonic Wind Tunnel Facility.

Another critical technology needed for LCA was the multi-mode radar (MMR). Initially, the Ericsson/Ferranti PS-05/A I/J-band multi-function radar, also used on Saab&#x27;s JAS 39 Gripen, was intended to be used. However, DRDO decided to develop an indigenous multi-mode radar for the Tejas. HAL&#x27;s Hyderabad division and the DRDO&#x27;s Electronics and Radar Development Establishment (LRDE) laboratory were selected to jointly lead the MMR programme, and work commenced in 1997. The Centre for Airborne Systems (CABS) was responsible for the MMR&#x27;s test programme. An HAL-748 airborne surveillance aircraft was converted for this purpose. The development of multi-mode was not smooth, as it suffered some setbacks. By 2005, only two radar modes – the air-to-air look-up and look-down - were confirmed to have been successfully tested. The performance of several other modes that had been tested were suboptimal. The problem with the radar was mainly attributed to the lack of compatibility between the LRDE/HAL multi mode radar and the LRDE&#x27;s advanced signal processor module. Using an &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; foreign radar as an interim option was considered.

ADA met with success in the development of three of the five key technologies identified at the beginning of the LCA programme. The successful endeavours were mastery in the FBW flight control system, the development and manufacturing of carbon-fibre composite structures and skins, and a modern glass cockpit. The &quot;Autolay&quot; computer-aided design software developed as part of the LCA programme has been licensed to Airbus for its A380 wide-body aircraft project. The development of a multi-mode pulse-doppler radar was abandoned, off the shelf Israeli Elta EL/M-2032 multi-mode and EL/M-2052 Active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar units being selected for the Mk1 and initial Mk1a aircraft, respectively, while DRDO opted, in 2012, to develop its own Uttam AESA Radar, as of 2024 the Uttam radar is undergoing flight trials. India&#x27;s self-reliance goal oriented development for the LCA programme has considerably increased the indigenous components in Tejas and contributed to an aviation industry expansion in the country.

On 20 December 2021, Ministry of Defence (MoD) in a written reply during winter session of Rajya Sabha clarified that the HAL Tejas is no longer considered as a replacement for the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21, instead it is now part of a general IAF fleet modernisation programme.

===Prototypes and testing===

Prototype testing began in 2003, a year after the first flight of the second Technology Demonstrator (TD-2). The first prototype aircraft, PV-1, made its maiden flight in 2003. The first trainer prototype PV-5 was rolled out in 2009 and made its first flight on 26 November 2009. A total of two trainer prototypes were built and designated PV-5 and PV-06. The first naval prototype, designated NP-1, made its first flight on 27 April 2012. It was a twin-seater aircraft, while the second naval prototype, designated as NP-2, was a single seater. Both naval prototypes were used extensively for various aircraft carrier-related trials at the Shore Based Test Facility in Goa. NP-2 was used in the actual carrier trials, where it made an arrested recovery and ski-jump assisted take-off from the aircraft carrier in January 2020.
The first Limited Series Production aircraft (LSP-1) performed its maiden flight on 25 April 2007. A total of seven limited series production (LSP) aircraft were built. The LSPs were extensively used for developmental trials such as weapon testing – involving test firing of the R-73 and Python-5 close combat missiles, the I-Derby ER beyond visual range air-to-air missile and guided–unguided munition releases. The LSPs were also used for sensor trials involving integration and testing of the Israeli Elta EL/M-2032 multi-mode radar, and EL/M-2052 AESA radar, and the Indian Uttam AESA Radar and Rafael Litening targeting pod. The Uttam radar was integrated on the Tejas LSP-2 and LSP-3, and logged about 30 hours of flight testing on the Tejas alone. The high altitude trials and hot weather trials were carried out with the LSPs and the PV-3 prototype, in IOC and FOC configurations. These trials were mainly focused on assessing the performance of the various sensors and avionics on board, at temperatures ranging from below -10 degree Celsius to more than +45 degrees Celsius.

Sea trials to assess the radar performance in air-to-air and air-to-sea modes at various altitudes were carried out in 2010. Flutter vibration tests were also carried out in different configurations at high angle of attack (AoA) to assess the structural integrity across the flight envelope. LSP-4 completed the successful trial of BDL developed Counter Measure Dispensing System (CMDS) with R-73 missile on 2 December 2010. It worked well Open Architecture Mission Computer and Digital Stores Management System.

In the second half of 2012, the Tejas fleet was grounded for over three months and the ejection system had to be modified to resume flight tests by the end of 2012. In 2013, Tejas (LSP-7) conducted an inflight engine relight test at high altitude to assess the engine response on flameout, a critical parameter for operational clearance. The inflight engine relight test is crucial for single engine combat aircraft. On 15 April 2023, HAL received a flight clearance certificate for the Aircraft Mounted Accessory Gear Box (AMAGB) bearings and power take-off shaft. The Centre for Military Airworthiness and Certification (CEMILAC) also gave clearance for the pre-production of landing gear seals developed by the Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment (CVRDE) and Fluoro Carbon Seals Limited.

===Operational clearance===

In December 2006, the IAF announced that it would form an &quot;LCA Induction Team&quot; to manage the aircraft&#x27;s service introduction. The Tejas was awarded initial operational clearance-I (IOC-I) in January 2011. To ease up the process of FOC, an interim IOC-II was issued to Tejas in December 2013. The IOC-II expanded the g-limit, angle of attack and allowed the aircraft to carry precision guided munitions and close combat missiles. The IOC-II Tejas have an operational radius of . The first squadron, consisting of Tejas in IOC-II configuration, became operational in 2016. The No. 45 Squadron IAF based at Sulur Air Force Station, Coimbatore was the first to have their MiG-21s replaced by Tejas aircraft at the base.

The FOC campaign began in December 2014. Two critical parameters set by IAF for FOC clearance was expansion of angle of attack from 24 degree in IOC-II to 28 degree in FOC and inflight refueling capability. In February 2018, as part of the FOC campaign, the Tejas carried out a &quot;hot refuelling&quot; - refuelling with engine running, which shortens the turnaround time by 30% and doubles the sortie rate. In September 2018, the Tejas successfully completed its mid-air refuelling trials required for the aircraft to obtain its FOC. In January 2019, HAL received permission from CEMILAC to start production of the FOC standard Tejas.

On 20 February 2019, during the Aero India 2019 show, FOC was formally awarded to the Tejas. The HAL handed over the FOC certificate to the then Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa at the Yelahanka Air Force base. After the formal ceremoney, ACM Dhanoa stated that Tejas was &quot;ready&quot; and &quot;behaved like a true fighter&quot;. The second Tejas squadron – No.18 &quot;Flying Bullets&quot; was formed at Sulur Air Force Station on 27 May 2020 with the first four serial production FOC aircraft.

A full mission simulator (FMS) phase-1 was commissioned at Sulur Air Force Station on 23 October 2021. Phase 1 of the FMS features training in aircraft handling and full envelope flying. Phase 2 will further augment the training with focus on weapons system and advance sensors onboard Tejas.

=== Upgrades and further development ===

In May 2015, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) noted some shortcomings in the then-delivered Tejas Mark 1 IOC standard aircraft, which according to the CAG would limit the ability to survive and operation deployment of the aircraft in actual combat. A few of these shortcomings, including lack of combat endurance, were addressed in the Tejas Mark 1 FOC configuration aircraft. Tejas Mark 1 FOC is modified to perform in-flight refuelling from Ilyushin Il-78 and Sukhoi Su-30MKI. Tejas is also undergoing butt firing trials and air-to-air firing at HAL, Nashik facility with Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23.

The shortcomings, such as the increased weight and reduced speed, would be addressed in the upcoming Tejas Mark 1A aircraft by increasing the use of composites in manufacturing and reducing the supersonic drag by using more aerodynamic pylons. The MK1A will also have AESA radar, a self-protection jammer, updated avionics and electronic warfare capabilities, among other improvements. The shortcomings identified by CAG that require redesign and structural modification such as increasing internal fuel capacity, are planned to be rectified in the Tejas Mark 2.

An agreement has been signed by the Indian Air Force and the Aeronautical Development Agency to include advanced weaponry and sensors into HAL Tejas. By transferring technical know-how for the smooth integration of weapons and sensors, ADA and the IAF&#x27;s Software Development Institute (SDI) hope to empower the IAF to carry out integration and flight testing on its own.

==== Naval variant ====
The &quot;Naval LCA programme&quot; was commenced in 2003. According to ADA, the &quot;Naval LCA (N-LCA) Programme&quot; was envisaged to be completed in two phases, under Phase-1 two naval prototypes were developed - the two-seat &quot;NP-1&quot; and the single-seat &quot;NP-2&quot;, based on the Tejas Mark 1 design, to carryout carrier suitability certification and weapons integration. Under Phase 2, two single-seat prototypes were planned to be built, based on the Tejas Mark 2 design, with further design optimisation and integration of the General Electric F414 INS6 engine. The first naval prototype NP-1 was rolled out in July 2010, and made its first flight on 27 April 2012. The naval LCA has stronger landing gear to absorb the forces generated during carrier take off and arrested recovery.

In December 2014, the LCA Navy successfully made its first ski-jump assisted take off from a SBTF at . The navy variant has a distinctive flight control law mode which allows hands-free take-off.

In December 2016, the Indian Navy (IN) opted out of the programme, owing to the long delay and technical reasons – such as inadequate thrust to weight ratio of N-LCA for carrier based combat operations, and issued a fresh RFI for the procurement of 57 multi-role carrier borne fighters.

Because the technologies developed for the Tejas programme will be carried over to other platforms currently being developed by the ADA, test flying was continued.

In 2019, an LCA navy prototype successfully carried out the first arrested landing at the SBTF in Goa in day time and night time. As of December 2019, the Naval LCA programme completed 209 test flights, including 50 ski jump take-offs and 28 arrested landings.

In January 2020, the naval prototype NP-2 successfully carried out its first arrested landing and ski-jump assisted take-off from the aircraft carrier .

In July 2020, the DRDO announced that the plan to develop an LCA Mark 2 Navy had been dropped and they were working on a new carrier-borne fighter according to the Indian Navy&#x27;s &quot;multi-role carrier borne fighter requirement&quot; floated in 2016 to replace the current fleet of MIG-29K/KUB carrier-based fighters. In Aero India 2021, a new twin engine naval fighter was unveiled, the &quot;Twin Engine Deck Based Fighter&quot; (TEDBF). The experience gained in the N-LCA programme will help in the development of TEDBF.

In February 2023, the naval prototype completed its maiden landing and take-off from the indigenous aircraft carrier .

==== Tejas Mark 1A ====

The Tejas Mark 1A variant has more than 40 improvements over the Mark 1 variant. Upgraded Mark 1A features a new avionic suite centred on EL/M-2052 AESA Radar and Uttam AESA Radar developed in-house. DARE Unified Electronic Warfare Suite (UEWS), an externally mounted self protection jammer (SPJ) for enhanced survivability, in-flight refuelling capability, Onboard Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS) developed by Defence Bioengineering and Electromedical Laboratory (DEBEL) for endurance and an expanded weapon suite consisting of Astra BVRAAM and ASRAAM. Two ASRAAMs are intended for use on Tejas Mark 1A. The production variant will come equipped with dual-rack pylons with weapon systems integration. HAL will install in-house developed Combined Interrogator and Transponder (CIT) with digital map generator by Mission and Combat Systems R&amp;D Centre which helps transfer the required mission map on pilot display, an upgraded IFF+ from older identification friend or foe system. To better accommodate the pilots, cockpit floor is also reshaped. The upgraded Tejas Mark 1A will have a reduced turnaround time. Tejas Mark 1A will use indigenously developed Angad electronic warfare suite and DRDO Advanced Self Protection Jammer pod. 
BEL will supply 20 types of locally developed critical avionics and upgrades such as Digital Flight Control Computers from ADA, Air Data Computer from DRDO, Weapon Computers from ADE, Radar Warning Receiver from Combat Aircraft Systems Development and Integration Centre (CASDIC) and Head-up display from Central Scientific Instruments Organisation (CSIO) from 2023 to 2028 for ₹2,400 crore.

In order to produce the BMI Engine Bay Door for the Tejas Mark 1A, HAL and National Aerospace Laboratories inked a technology transfer agreement. For the engine bay door, where it must survive a service temperature of roughly 200 °C, NAL Advanced Composites Division is creating a manufacturing process technique that uses Carbon-BMI Prepreg to create co-cured composite structures that are very temperature resistant. On 28 March 2024, Tejas Mark 1A, equipped with the first set of Carbon-BMI Engine Bay Door assembly, successfully completed the inaugural flight from HAL facility.

On 19 April 2024, ADA delivered the first batch of Secondary Flight Control of Tejas Mk 1A which consists of an indigenously designed Leading Edge Slats and Airbrake Control Module. These flight control systems features &quot;state-of-the-art Servo-Valve based electro-hydraulic servo actuators and control modules.&quot; These development was the result of the collaboration of ADA, Research Centre Imarat (RCI) and Central Manufacturing Technology Institute (CMTI). The technology is ready to be integrated with production variants of Tejas Mk 1A as it successfully completed flight trials. These are being produced at Accessories Division, HAL, Lucknow.

Milestones

* According to HAL Chairman and Director R Madhavan, the design activity of Tejas Mark 1A is moving ahead, and the testing of subsystems will be completed by 2021. The taxi trials will commence in the first half of 2022, and the first flight of Mark 1A prototype will happen in the second half of 2022.
* On 20 May 2022, the Tejas Mark 1A prototype completed its first flight. HAL intends to obtain a certificate from Centre for Military Airworthiness and Certification (CEMILAC) within 30 months before this version enters mass production. 
* On 28 March 2024, the first production series Mark 1A aircraft (LA 5033) conducted its inaugural flight which lasted for 18 minutes. The aircraft will undergo more testing before being officially transferred to the IAF.
* The first Tejas Mark 1A, originally scheduled for delivery on 31 March 2024, may now arrive in mid 2025, as a result of the delay in obtaining new engines (F404-IN20), a Danish export ban on the Aircraft&#x27;s engine charge amplifier, delays in the delivery of software from Israel, and necessary certifications. In FY2024–25, HAL was scheduled to deliver 16 fighter jets. Afterwards, 16 jets will be produced by the Bengaluru production line and 8 by the Nashik production line. Total 87 jets are expected to be delivered by 2028.

==== Tejas Mark 2 ====
The HAL Tejas design has been further developed into the Tejas Mark 2, incorporating a more powerful General Electric F414 INS6 engine, canards and other design changes. The Tejas Mark 2, which is expected to be rolled out in 2025, will have an increased payload carrying capacity and internal fuel capacity, more external hardpoints, improved combat range, a completely redesigned cockpit, and an integrated infrared search and track (IRST) system, in addition to the AESA radar. The Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT) is developing aircraft health and usage monitoring systems (HUMS) to integrate the various sensors on board the Tejas Mark 2. The first flight of Tejas Mark 2 is expected to be in 2025. But based on previous ADA and HAL reacord can easily take to 2035.

==Design==

===Overview===
The Tejas is a single-engine multirole combat aircraft which has a tailless, compound delta wing design with &quot;relaxed static stability&quot; for enhanced manoeuvrability and agility. The Tejas is a multi-role combat aircraft and its flexibility permits it to carry out Interception, air-to-surface and anti-shipping roles in a single mission. The wind tunnel testing and computational fluid dynamics analysis have optimised the design of Tejas for minimum transonic and supersonic wave drag, as well low wing-loading.
Tejas has eight hardpoints – one beneath the port-side air-intake, one under the fuselage (centreline station) and three hardpoints under each wing, of these, three are wet hardpoints which can carry drop tanks. The hardpoint beneath the port side air-intake is dedicated to carrying sensor pods such as FLIR, IRST or laser rangefinder/designator. These can also be carried on the centreline pylon and inboard pairs of wing stations. It has an aerial refuelling probe on the starboard side of the forward fuselage. The Tejas weapon suite consists of I-Derby ER and Astra beyond visual range air-to-air missiles and R-73, Python-5 and ASRAAM close combat missiles. The Tejas has an internal 23 mm Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23 twin-barreled autocannon under the starboard side air-intake. The BrahMos-NG supersonic cruise missile is being developed for the Tejas.

The relatively smaller size, extensive use of airframe composites, the Y-duct inlet which shields the engine compressor blades, the application of radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and so on, reduces the overall radar cross-section of the aircraft.

===Airframe===
Apart from aluminium-lithium alloys and titanium alloys, carbon-fibre composite materials are used in the construction of the Tejas. The composite materials constitute 45% of the airframe by weight and 90% by surface area, the highest among contemporary aircraft. The upper and lower wing surfaces, wing spars and wing ribs are also made out of carbon-fibre composites, while the fin tip is made out of fiberglass. The extensive use of composite materials in the airframe not only makes the aircraft lighter but also gives high strength. This also reduces the number of joints or rivets, increases the aircraft&#x27;s structural integrity and lowers its susceptibility to fatigue cracks. The tailfin is a monolithic honeycomb structure, reducing the manufacturing cost by 80% compared to traditional methods. Initially the Tejas prototypes were equipped with a radome made out of Kevlar which was replaced with a quartz radome in the production aircraft.

The naval LCA has a nose droop to provide improved view for carrier landings. In addition to the elevons, the naval LCA has wing leading–edge vortex controllers (LEVCON) control surfaces that extend from the wing-root leading edge, which could be deflected to a downward angle or an upward angle to increase lift and reduce airspeed during approach. The LEVCONs also provides better low-speed handling and increase controllability at high angles of attack (AoA). The naval Tejas also has a strengthened undercarriage, stronger landing gear, and an arrestor hook system for carrier landings. The two-seat LCA Navy variant (NP-1) have aerodynamic commonality with the trainer variant.

The Secondary Flight Control of Tejas Mk 1A consists of an indigenously designed Leading Edge Slats and Airbrake Control Module. Aeronautical Development Agency, on 19 April 2024, delivered the first batch of these flight control system. These flight control systems features &quot;state-of-the-art Servo-Valve based electro-hydraulic servo actuators and control modules.&quot; The technology is ready to be integrated with production variants of Tejas Mk 1A as it successfully completed flight trials. These are being produced at Accessories Division, HAL, Lucknow.

===Avionics===
The avionics of the Tejas Mark 1 is centered around Elta EL/M-2032 radar. Its digital flight control computer developed by ADE and manufactured BEL. It has an electronic warfare (EW) suite domestically developed by Defence Avionics Research Establishment (DARE), which consists of a radar warning receiver (RWR), integrated self-protection jammer, chaff and flare dispenser system. The upgraded variant of the Tejas Mark 1, named the Tejas Mark 1A have an AESA radar, new high performance digital flight control computer (DFCC MK1A), new EW suite and updated avionics. Some of the production Mark 1A fighters will be equipped with the Elta EL/M-2052 AESA radar, while rest of the aircraft are expected to fly with the domestically developed Uttam AESA radar. The new EW system for the Mark 1A, developed by DARE known as the &quot;Unified Electronic Warfare suite&quot; (UEWS), will have electronic countermeasures and electronic counter-countermeasure capabilities, digital radio frequency memory based jamming and deception capabilities. The Tejas Mark 1A will also carry a pod-mounted self-protection jammer – the Elta ELL-8222WB. The Mark 1A will have software-defined radio-based secure communications and network-centric warfare capabilities.

The Tejas can also carry pod-based sensors such as forward looking infrared (FLIR). Currently the Tejas is cleared to carry the Rafael Litening III targeting/reconnaissance pod, while an advanced version named &quot;Litening 4I&quot; will be integrated on the Tejas. The Litening 4I pod, developed by the C4I systems division of Rafael, enables the aircraft to carry out reconnaissance, surveillance and intelligence gathering, in addition to target acquisition. The Tejas has an integrated health-monitoring system.

The Tejas has a night vision goggles compatible glass cockpit, equipped with a domestically developed head-up display (HUD), three multi-function displays, two Smart Standby Displays by Central Scientific Instruments Organization (CSIO). The Tejas has hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) arrangement to reduce pilot&#x27;s workload. The displays provide key information on a need-to-know basis, the pilot interacts with onboard systems through a multi-functional keyboard and several selection panels. The Tejas has a &quot;get-you-home&quot; panel coupled with an air data computer developed by Bharat Electronics Limited to assist the pilot in case of an emergency. The cockpit is equipped with Martin-Baker 16LG zero-zero ejection seat and &quot;canopy severance system&quot; developed by the DRDO for safe ejection. For life support, Tejas Mark 1 relies on conventional liquid oxygen LOX system, while an onboard oxygen-generation system (OBOGS) has been developed for Tejas Mark 1A. The ADA has developed virtual reality assisted cockpit simulator for Tejas, and N-LCA. Currently Tejas pilots are flying with Elbit DASH IV helmet-mounted display system.

===Flight control system===
The aerodynamic configuration of Tejas is based on a delta-wing layout with shoulder-mounted wings. The control surfaces include three-section slats on the wing&#x27;s outer leading edge while the inboard sections of the wings have additional slats to generate vortex lift over the inner wing and high-energy air-flow along the tail fin to enhance high-AoA stability. The wing trailing edge fits two-segment elevons to provide pitch and roll control. The only empennage-mounted control surfaces are the single-piece rudder and two airbrakes, located in the upper rear part of the fuselage, one each on either side of the fin. Since the Tejas is a relaxed static stability design, it is equipped with a NAL-developed full authority quadruplex digital fly-by-wire flight control system and an open architecture digital flight control computer developed by BEL. Its flight control surfaces are controlled by hybrid electro-hydraulic actuators through the digital flight control computer. The fly-by-wire flight control system of the Tejas has an advanced feature called &quot;auto low-speed recovery.&quot; This enables envelope protection at low speed and high angles of attack. It prevents the aircraft from entering into uncontrolled flight while maneuvering. Another feature is &quot;disorientation recovery function&quot;, once engaged it will recover the aircraft to an optimal altitude, airspeed and level flight. Some of the flight control laws for these features were formulated by the IIT Bombay research university.

On 19 February 2024, Tejas Mark-1A prototype LSP-7 successfully completed sortie with indigenously designed high performance Digital Flight Control Computer (DFCC). The system was developed by Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE). The latest DFCC has a quadraplex PowerPC-based processor, a fast I/O controller based on an autonomous state machine, increased computational throughput, and sophisticated on-board software that satisfies DO-178C level-A safety regulations. All important metrics and the flight controls&#x27; performance were deemed adequate during the flying test.

===Propulsion===
Developing an indigenous jet engine for Tejas was one of the five self-reliance goals identified at the beginning of the LCA Programme. A programme led by the Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE) to design and develop an indigenous powerplant, the Kaveri, was launched as early as in 1986. However Kaveri jet engine development faced some setbacks, hence the General Electric F404-GE-F2J3 afterburning turbofan engine was procured as an interim solution. The F404-F2J3 (10 units) powers the Technology Demonstrator and Prototype variants of Tejas. Since 2004, uprated General Electric F404-GE-IN20 engines are being used on LSP, Naval prototypes and Mark 1 variants of Tejas.

The Tejas Mark 1 is currently powered by the F404-IN20 engine. The Mark 1A variant will be powered by the same powerplant, while the heavier Tejas Mark 2 will be powered by a General Electric F414-INS6 engine. On 17 August 2021, HAL placed an order of for 99 F404-GE-IN20 engines.

=== Production lines ===

# HAL&#x27;s first Tejas production line is situated at Bangalore near HAL Airport. The production line was set up at a cost of , with HAL holding 50% stake and the rest held by IAF and Navy. First serial production aircraft delivered in 2015 with production rate of 8 per year.
# In March 2017, Government of India sanctioned for setting up an additional production line under Aircraft Division, HAL. This would increase the production capacity from 8 to 16. Production of sub-components like Front Fuselage, Centre Fuselage, Rear Fuselage, Wings were outsourced to private partners.
# On 5 April 2023, the then Defence Secretary Giridhar Aramane officially opened a third production line at HAL&#x27;s Nashik factory, to accelerate delivery. This brings the total production capacity from 16 to 24 aircraft annually. The production of aircraft at this plant will start from October 2024 while the first aircraft from Nashik is expected by the end of FY2024-25. As of 6 February 2025, Nashik line is operational and the first Tejas Mk1A is planned to roll out in a months or two.
# HAL also plans to setup another production line at Nashik to ramp up production capacity from 24 to 32 as reported on 10 January 2025. The line can be start production within 1.5 years of sanction.

=== First and second orders ===
On 1 October 2014, LCA-SP1 aircraft took the first flight. On 17 January 2015 the aircraft was delivered to the Indian Air Force. Left head till then flow on 5 sorties to test various equipment. Due to delays in production the cost per aircraft rose from in 2006 to in 2015. However, the aircraft was not be inducted into a squadron till 2016 until sufficient numbers were delivered by HAL. The aircraft would also require additional flight hours before induction. Expected delivery timeline was as follows: SP-2 in March, upto SP-5 by June, upto SP-8 by March 2016; completing a total of 8 aircraft.

The formation of the first Tejas-equipped squadron started in July 2011. No. 45 Squadron IAF &quot;(Flying Daggers)&quot;, the first Tejas squadron, was operationalised in July 2016. It is based in Sulur Air Force Station, Coimbatore.

When the first order was placed in 2006, it was expected that ADA would receive Initial Operational Clearance (IOC) by 2008. Induction was scheduled by December 2011. However, IOC was originally received in December 2013 and the first IOC variant was delivered in FY2016-17.

As of 11 February 2019, 12 IOC aircraft were delivered with 4 due to be delivered by March 2019. Also, on 31 December 2018, ADA has handed over Drawing Applicability List (DAL) and Equipment Standard of Preparation (SOP) documents, for FOC configuration to HAL for production. The production and delivery of 8 Tejas Trainer would start after design clearance by ADA.

The second Tejas Mark 1 squadron, Squadron 18, was formed at Sulur on 27 May 2020.

By August 2023, the delivery of all 32 single-seat Tejas Mk 1 aircraft (IOC and FOC) were completed.

The first series production trainer aircraft (LT5201) completed its maiden flight on 5 April 2023. IAF has received first LCA Tejas twin seater aircraft from HAL on 4 October 2023. Next trainer variant delivery expected by March 31.

As of 18 September 2024, 4 trainer aircraft have been delivered to IAF while the rest of 4 are to be delivered by March 2025.

As of 10 January 2025, 38 of the 40 aircraft has been delivered and the last two trainers would be delivered soon. On 11 January 2025, the last of the 40 Tejas - LT-5208 - took its first flight.

=== Third order delays ===

IAF will raise the first squadron of Tejas Mark 1A at Nal Air Force Station.

The 73 Tejas Mark 1A and 10 training aircraft were to be delivered within three years of signing of the contract that was signed on 1 February 2021. The delivery was scheduled to start on 3 February 2024, and was supposed to be finished in nine years. Initially, the delay of delivery date moved to March 2024.

However, as of March 2024, the IAF&#x27;s latest requests for software upgrades and minor design changes caused the delay in delivery timeline, as per to sources within the military and defence establishment. Also, a number of certifications were pending. The delivery of essential components that were ordered from Israel, Russia and Ukraine have also been delayed due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. All of which is impacting the production and delivery schedule.

According to reports, Ministry of Defence has asked HAL to deliver 18 Tejas Mk 1A by March 2024 and all of 180 jets within 10 years. This was necessary to negate out the shortfall in IAF&#x27;s combat squadron which is much below the sanctioned squadron strength of IAF. As per Ministry of Defence, there is a delay of more than 10 months in supply of F404-GE-IN20 engines by GE Aerospace.

No. 3 Squadron, followed by No. 23 Squadron, will be the first to operate the Mk 1A variant.

Subsequently, the delivery dates were shifted several times from February 2024 to July-end (as of May), to 15 August (as of July) while the delivery of GE F404 engines was expected to start by September–October in 2024 at the rate of up to two engines per month.

As of August, the delivery dates were again shifted to November 2024. While the first aircraft is undergoing critical flight tests and weapons trials are expected soon, the second is in high speed taxi trials phase. The next 4 units are in advanced stages of production. In fact, HAL has plans to manufacture at least 14 airframes in &quot;ready-to-go state&quot; by this fiscal year. It would take few weeks to integrate the engine into the airframe and deliver it to IAF after the start of engine delivery.

As reported in September 2024, Denmark has prohibited the export of engine charge amplifiers, which were earlier installed on Tejas Mk1, resulting in further delays in Tejas Mk 1A delivery. As a solution, HAL has assigned a Bengaluru-based company to indigenise the component. HAL is to begin testing of the component soon after its development. The engine charge amplifier is a crucial component tasked to sense engine temperature and adjust operation accordingly.

Again in September, it was reported that the Tejas Mk1A will be delivered from October 2024, as the fighter aircraft&#x27;s Israeli software integration being finished and is undergoing final trials. The delivery will begin with the category B engines, which refers to previously used or procured from GE. The F404-IN20 engine delivery has been shifted to arrive in November 2024.

As of October 2024, GE again delayed the delivery of first F404-IN20 engines until April 2025. These delays are attributed to supply chains as a South Korean firm with financial issues are unable to deliver certain components of the engine. This subsequently pushed the delivery date of first Mk1A until mid-2025. HAL has 5-6 aircraft ready for delivery. However, the primary constraint is the GE engines. India has no plans to impose penalties on GE for the delays. The Mk1A is in the final stages of trials before delivery.

As of late December, reports suggest that further critical trials of Tejas Mk1A using Category B F404 engines is to commence in January 2025 as a part of a contingency plan. The new deadline set for delivery of first aircraft is 31 March 2025. The Category B F404 engines are to be replaced once the new engines are delivered. The trials will also include Astra Mk1 air-to-air beyond visual range missiles, EL/M-2052 and indigenous Electronic Warfare Suite (radar warning receiver and advanced self-protection jammer). The aircraft will be delivered after certain certifications are done.

It was reported that the production line of GE F404 engines at Boston has been started and first units could be delivered by March 2025. GE had a timeline to deliver 6 engines in 2023-24. However, the F404 production line at Lynn, Massachusetts had been closed and led to supply chain problems during COVID-19 pandemic. These problems have been resolved. Initially, one or two engines will be delivered per month while the rate will be stabilised by 2026 after which, the delivery rate will be 24 aircraft per year and is to be enhanced to 30 units later.

As of 10 January 2025, GE had a backlog of 26 engines, while the delivery deadline of the engines and aircraft remained unchanged. The first aircraft from Nashik production line is expected to roll out in March as well. HAL also plans to setup another production line at Nashik to ramp up production capacity from 24 to 32.

As of 6 February 2025, HAL had three Tejas Mk1A aircraft “ready in the flight line” while five of them are scheduled to be ready by March-April. These aircraft can be delivered within few days once GE starts engine deliveries by March. Integration of EW Suite and radars are complete while trials of Astra missiles form these jets are expected soon. GE has &quot;promised&quot; to deliver 12 engines in 2025-26 starting in March 2025 with 20 engines to be delivered from 2026-27 onwards. Tejas delivery rate will depend on the revised engine delivery schedules. Meanwhile, Nashik line is reportedly operational and the first Tejas Mk1A is planned to roll out in one or two months. Secretary of Defence Production Sanjeev Kumar stated during Aero India&#x27;s 2025 edition that Tejas&#x27; production line has stabilized, both with HAL and GE engines, and that Tejas&#x27; supply will follow the original plan starting in 2025–2026 when 16 to 24 jets would be delivered.

==Operational history==
The Tejas Mark 1 made its international debut on 21 January 2016, at the fourth Bahrain International Airshow.

On 26 January 2017, Tejas made its maiden appearance in the 68th Republic Day parade by joining in the fly-past over the Kartavya Path (then Rajpath) in New Delhi.

In April 2018, the IAF&#x27;s entire fleet of Tejas Mark 1 aircraft participated in the Gagan Shakti 2018 exercise. It was the IAF&#x27;s largest air exercise, involving 1,100 aircraft and 15,000 military personnel. During the exercise, the Tejas were deployed to forward bases and demonstrated their reliability and precision strike capability. In 2019, six Tejas fighter jets participated in the Vayu Shakti air exercise, where it has demonstrated its &quot;swing role&quot; capability.

According to the commanding officer of No. 45 Squadron – Group Captain Samrath Dhankhar, DASH IV HMDS enables the Tejas pilot to take full advantage of high off-boresight close combat missiles, such as Python-5 and R-73.

On 18 August 2020, IAF deployed the No. 45 Squadron &quot;Flying Dagger&quot; on the western front along the Pakistani border (line of control). It was the first operational deployment of Tejas.

On 27 April 2021, Tejas Mark 1 successfully test fired Python-5 high off-boresight (HOBS) close combat missile and further validated enhanced capability of I-Derby ER (extended range) BVR missile. Both missiles scored direct hits on targets during the trial.

IAF participated in Exercise Desert Flag VIII, with five Tejas and two C-17 Globemaster III aircraft, held in UAE from 27 February to 17 March 2023. This is the first time Tejas participated in an international flying exercise outside India.

On 23 August 2023, Tejas successfully test-fired Astra Beyond Visual Range air-to-air missile off Goa coast. This is the first time when India test fire an indigenously developed BVRAAM from a homegrown fighter aircraft

In December 2023, plans were revealed to deploy the first batch of Tejas Mk 1A in the Nal airbase in Bikaner, Rajasthan. No. 3 Squadron and No. 23 Squadron, the last and current operators of MiG-21s, are expected to become the first operators of Tejas Mk1A. Both the squadrons were deployed in Nal AFS by June 2024. The first delivery of Tejas Mk 1A is expected by November 2024.

On 26 January 2024, on the occasion of 75th Republic Day of India, four Tejas took part in the parade fly-past held at Kartavya Path, New Delhi.

HAL Tejas Mk 1 participated in the first phase of Exercise Tarang Shakti 2024. The jets were escorted by a formation of four HAL Tejas Mk 1 aircraft, one of which was piloted by Vice Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal Amar Preet Singh. The exercise began with Tejas intercepting German, French and Spanish jets as a part of the training exercise. HAL Tejas was assigned to the Red Force (hostile) as well as the Blue Force (friendly) and its capabilities were proved in both the cases. The jet also received appreciation from the foreign pilots who piloted them. On 13 August, the Chief of French Air Force, General and the Chief of German Air Force Lieutenant General Ingo Gerhartz piloted HAL Tejas.

The first production aircraft of Tejas Mk1A will be showcased at Aero India 2025.

===Potential operators===
HAL proposed exporting the Tejas, with preliminary talks taking place with several friendly countries. It was reported in March 2020 that HAL is willing to set up logistic facilities in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam as part of exporting the Tejas.

====Brazil====
In September 2024, the Brazilian Air Force (FAB) has reportedly considered the adoption of the Tejas to replace their AMX and Northrop F-5 jets in service and complement the Saab JAS 39 Gripen, which is being done with a swap of Embraer C-390 Millennium. FAB wanted to acquire F-16 Fighting Falcon at first from the US, but it was rejected.

According to the FAB, the AMX is due to be retired by 2025 with the F-5s being next by 2030. In November 2024, Brazil offered to India a swap between the C-390 Millennium and the HAL Tejas, to replace the older F-5s in operation, an Indian delegation is set to visit Brazil in December 2024 to negotiate the deal.

====Congo====
In October 2024, a report suggested that the Air Force of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FAC) was interested to acquire HAL Tejas. It was reported back in August 2024 that a FAC delegation visited India to speak with HAL representatives about the Tejas.

===Failed bids===

==== Argentina ====
The Argentine Air Force had indicated its interest in possibly purchasing the Tejas, as part of its modernization initiative. HAL had offered the Tejas to Argentina, amidst other offers of the JF-17 from China and the MiG-35 from Russia. Multiple sources had also indicated that the Tejas may likely be a good option for Argentina.

However, any potential sale of the Tejas to Argentina may likely be threatened by British imposed arms sanctions, since the Tejas utilizes the British Martin-Baker MK16 IN16 GS Tejas ejection seat, along with other British-origin components — including an aerial-refueling probe and a quartz radome, both supplied by Cobham Limited. The UK has barred any sale of military-equipment consisting of British-manufactured parts to Argentina ever since the 1982 Falklands War. Argentina&#x27;s previous efforts to procure modern fighter aircraft, including the Mirage F1M, the IAI Kfir, the JAS 39 Gripen and the KAI FA-50 were scuttled due to British diplomatic pressure, since the aforementioned aircraft were found to contain UK-origin parts.

Given the nature of the Argentine-specific sanctions, the Tejas would essentially be subject to UK-scrutiny. Nevertheless, HAL reportedly stated multiple times that they are willing to accommodate Argentinian requests to retrofit the Tejas, and had offered a customised-variant of the Tejas which replaces around 50-specific components and the substitutes all major British-origin components with diplomatically suitable non-British alternatives, including possibly substituting the ejection seat with one indigenously developed and manufactured in India.
However, any customisation to the HAL Tejas would encompass considerable changes to the aircraft&#x27;s design and additional flight certification. Subsequently, there were indications that the Argentines were willing to look at the JF-17 because of concerns that the time and money required to modify the Tejas to remove non-British parts was beyond what Buenos Aires was willing to spend.

In December 2022, the Argentine government decided to abandon the decision to acquire new fighter aircraft. With President Alberto Fernandez stating in an interview that “Argentina has to allocate its resources to more important things than the purchase of military aircraft. We are in a very unequal continent, but there are no war problems and unity among countries is sought.&quot; In July 2023, Argentine newspaper &quot;La Nacion&quot; reported that Tejas had been eliminated, with the remaining options being second-hand Danish F-16 fighters or Chinese-Pakistani JF-17s, both which the bidding selection board deemed more advantageous. In March 2024, Denmark agreed to the purchase of 24 Danish F-16s by Argentina.

====Australia====
In July 2020, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) had issued a tender, seeking a new jet trainer to replace its fleet of BAE Hawk 127 trainer aircraft. According to HAL&#x27;s &quot;58th Annual Report&quot; covering 2020–2021, HAL had offered the HAL Tejas in its &quot;Lead in Fighter Trainer&quot; (LIFT) configuration to Australia&#x27;s Department of Defence (DoD) in July 2020. Other aircraft also reported to be participating in the tender were the Boeing-Saab T-7 Red Hawk, the Aermacchi M-346 Master and the KAI T-50.

However, the Australian Government rejected a government to government deal proposed by the Indian government for 35 Tejas LIFT aircraft for US $1 billion. During bilateral defence talks held in September 2021, &quot;The Indian Express&quot; reported Australia&#x27;s lack of interest in the offer. In February 2022, the Australian government decided to take up a proposal by BAE to upgrade and refurbish its Hawks with new engines and avionics, extending their lifespan until 2032.

====Botswana====
The Botswana Defence Force Air Wing had approached HAL to procure the Tejas for potentially replacing its Canadair CF-5s due to the aircraft&#x27;s age and problems of acquiring needed parts for maintenance. The BDFAW had previously considered acquiring Gripens, the F-16, KAI T-50, and the Leonardo M-346.

As of July 2024, there were reports that talks on acquiring the Tejas are suspended. In January 2025, Botswana officially ended negotiations to purchase the Tejas.

====Egypt====
During the Dubai Airshow 2021, Egyptian officials expressed their interest in procuring 70 LCA Tejas to replace 100 Hongdu JL-8s. Following the Dubai Airshow 2021, HAL and Indian Air Force officials visited Cairo and discussions were going on. As of June 2022, India has offered to set up local production facilities for the LCA Tejas and also for the Light Utility and Light Combat Helicopters in Egypt.

During Aero India 2023, it was reported that Egypt was seeking around 20 multi-role aircraft. HAL previously reported that 35 LCA Mk-1As were being offered in a contract. In August 2024, it was reported that an agreement to purchase the Chinese Chengdu J-10C, had been signed.

====Malaysia====
Malaysia had frequently indicated that it may be interested in purchasing the HAL Tejas for the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF), as part of its attempts to supplement its MiG-29 fleet; reports of Malaysian interest in procuring the aircraft date back to as early as 2019.

In March 2019, the HAL Tejas made its international debut at the Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition (LIMA); its presence reportedly generated a great deal of interest, especially by the RMAF. However, in mid-2019, HAL&#x27;s prospects of exporting the HAL Tejas to Malaysia were severely blemished, owing to diplomatic tussles between India and Malaysia. After the diplomatic skirmishes had ceased in 2020, an RMAF delegation reportedly visited HAL&#x27;s manufacturing-facility at Bangalore in 2021, to assess the suitability of the HAL Tejas. Possibly in anticipation of a potential order — reaffirming Malaysia&#x27;s interest in the aircraft.

In 2021, the RMAF formally released a tender and request for proposals for the supply of 18 light combat-aircraft - labelled as the &quot;Fighter Lead In Trainer-Light Combat Aircraft&quot; (FLIT/LCA), in an effort to supplant its ageing BAE Hawk 108/208 light-combat aircraft and its MB-339CM trainers. Six aircraft were running in the bid for the FLIT/LCA tender — the HAL Tejas MK1A, KAI FA-50, HAIC L-15, Aermacchi M-346, TAI Hürjet and Mikoyan MiG-35. Coincidentally, the JF-17 — which was reported to be a leading choice for the RMAF, did not participate in the FLIT/LCA tender.

In February 2023, the Malaysian government announced that the South Korean bid had won the tender with the Tejas failing to win the contract. Malaysia subsequently ordered 18 KAI FA-50 Block 20 aircraft worth US$920 million. The FA-50 was reportedly chosen because of it being a tried-and-tested platform in service with numerous countries while the Tejas is largely unproven and untested, with the Indian Air Force being the sole operator. Logistics issues and the FA-50 better meeting the RMAF&#x27;s FLIT/LCA requirements were also other factors.

====Nigeria====
On December 7, 2023, HAL reported that Nigeria has expressed interest in acquiring the Tejas. It was reportedly in competition with the JF-17. However in July 2024, there were reports that talks on acquiring the Tejas were suspended. In January 2025, Nigeria withdrew from negotiations to purchase the Tejas.

====Philippines====
In May 2022, India and the Philippines signed an MOU with the Philippine Aerospace Development Corporation, which mentioned the consideration of purchasing the Tejas and other Indian-made aircraft. On July 7, 2022, the Tejas was dropped from further consideration from the multi-role fighter jet (MRF) project. The F-16V Block 70/72 and the JAS-39 Gripen C/D+ are currently the main contenders for the Philippine Air Force&#x27;s MRF project.

In February 2024, HAL reported that it has offered the Tejas Mark 1A to the PADC as a naval strike platform, equipped with the BrahMos NG missile. HAL also agreed to help set up a local partnership for the assembly of the MK1A.

====Sri Lanka====
In 2018, it had been reported that Sri Lanka had shown interest in purchasing the Tejas to replace its aging fleets of IAI Kfir and Chengdu J-7 aircraft. The intention was for the acquisition of 8 to 12 aircraft to be pursued through a government-government basic agreement.

In 2021, the Sri Lankan government decided to overhaul their Kfirs instead rather than buying new aircraft, which would cost around $40 million per unit compared to $49 million in total for overhauling all five Kfirs.

====United Arab Emirates====
The Tejas had attracted interest from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with some discussions held during a visit by UAE Minister of State and Defence, Mohammed Ahmed Al Bowardi Al Falacy, during a state visit in October 2018, as part of growing defence relations between India and UAE. By May 2022, Tejas had failed to gain any further interest with the UAE placing an order for 80 Rafale F4s from France.

In February 2023, the UAE signed a deal for purchase of 12 Hongdu L-15 trainer and light combat aircraft from China, with options for another 36. UAE officials stated the L-15 order aligned with the UAE&#x27;s framework for diversifying the military&#x27;s sources of equipment.

====United States====
In December 2020, in response to a Request for Information (RFI) from the United States Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), HAL offered the &quot;Lead In Fighter Trainer&quot; variant of the HAL Tejas — classified as the &quot;HAL Tejas LIFT&quot;, to the United States Navy (USN), as part the latter&#x27;s initiative to replace its fleet of T-45 Goshawk trainer aircraft, dubbed the &quot;Undergraduate Jet Training System&quot;. Other aircraft participating in the UJTS, are the T-7 Red Hawk — offered by Boeing in partnership with Saab, and the KAI T-50A Golden Eagle — offered by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), in partnership with Lockheed Martin.

Despite being the only aircraft among the three to be reportedly capable of undertaking operations from an aircraft carrier, the prospects of the USN selecting the HAL Tejas LIFT are reportedly slim, according to multiple sources. Several reasons suggested as the cause of the LIFT&#x27;s bleak prospects in the UJTS are that HAL has refrained from partnering with a US-based company to offer the LIFT (unlike the consortiums of Boeing-Saab and KAI-Lockheed Martin, offering the T-7 and the T-50A, respectively), a lack of export orders for the type, and its delta-wing design — which makes it less-suitable for low-speed landing.

<doc id="749973" wikidata="Q6603540" url="?curid=749973" title="List of Victoria Cross recipients by campaign">
<text>The Victoria Cross (VC) is a military decoration awarded for valour &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; to members of armed forces of some Commonwealth countries and previous British Empire territories. It takes precedence over all other orders, decorations and medals, and may be awarded to a person of any rank in any service and to civilians under military command. The award was officially constituted when Queen Victoria issued a warrant under the Royal sign-manual on 29 January 1856 that was gazetted on 5 February 1856. The order was backdated to 1854 to recognise acts of valour during the Crimean War. The first awards ceremony was held on 26 June 1857, where Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in a ceremony in Hyde Park.

The first citations of the VC, particularly those in the initial gazette of 24 February 1857, varied in the details of each action; some specify date ranges while some specify a single date. The original Royal Warrant did not contain a specific clause regarding posthumous awards, although official policy was to not award the VC posthumously. Between 1897 and 1901, several notices were issued in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; regarding soldiers who would have been awarded the VC had they survived. In a partial reversal of policy in 1902, six of the soldiers mentioned were granted the VC, but not &quot;officially&quot; awarded the medal. In 1907, the posthumous policy was completely reversed and medals were sent to the next of kin of the six soldiers. The Victoria Cross warrant was not officially amended to explicitly allow posthumous awards until 1920, but one quarter of all awards for the First World War were posthumous. Three people have been awarded the VC and Bar, which is a medal for two actions; Noel Chavasse, Arthur Martin-Leake and Charles Upham. Chavasse received both medals for actions in the First World War, while Martin-Leake was awarded his first VC for actions in the Second Boer War, and his second for actions during the First World War. Charles Upham received both VCs for actions during the Second World War.

The Victoria Cross has been awarded 1,358 times to 1,355 individual recipients. The largest number of recipients for one campaign is the First World War, for which 628 medals were awarded to 627 recipients. The largest number awarded for actions on a single day was 24 on 16 November 1857, at the Second Relief of Lucknow, during the Indian Mutiny. The largest number awarded for a single action was 18, for the assault on Sikandar Bagh, during the Second Relief of Lucknow. The largest number awarded to one unit during a single action was 7, to the 2nd/24th Foot, for the defence of Rorke&#x27;s Drift (22–23 January 1879), during the Zulu War.

Since 1991, Australia, Canada and New Zealand have created their own separate Victoria Crosses: the Victoria Cross for Australia, the Victoria Cross (Canada), and the Victoria Cross for New Zealand. Only five of these separate medals have been awarded, all for actions in the War in Afghanistan; Willie Apiata received the Victoria Cross for New Zealand on 26 July 2007; on 16 January 2009 Mark Donaldson, on 24 August 2010 Daniel Keighran, on 23 January 2011 Ben Roberts-Smith, and on 13 February 2014 Cameron Baird (posthumous award), were awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia. As these are separate medals, they are not included in this list.
* 
==Notes==
*A  Between 1858 and 1881, the Victoria Cross could be awarded for actions taken &quot;under circumstances of extreme danger&quot; not in the face of the enemy. O&#x27;Hea single-handedly put out a fire in an ammunition cart, and was awarded the VC for that action. This rule was changed in 1881 to allow only acts &quot;in the presence of the enemy&quot;.
*B  628 Medals were awarded to 627 recipients. Two Bars were awarded; Noel Godfrey Chavasse was awarded the Victoria Cross and Bar for two separate actions; Arthur Martin-Leake was awarded a VC in the Second Boer War, and his Bar for actions in the First World War.
*C  182 medals were awarded to 181 recipients; Charles Upham was awarded the Victoria Cross and Bar.

<doc id="749976" wikidata="Q323511" url="?curid=749976" title="Harris Wofford">
<text>Harris Llewellyn Wofford Jr. (April 9, 1926 – January 21, 2019) was an American attorney, civil rights activist, and Democratic Party politician who represented Pennsylvania in the United States Senate from 1991 to 1995. A noted advocate of national service and volunteering, Wofford was also the fifth president of Bryn Mawr College from 1970 to 1978, served as chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party in 1986 and also as Pennsylvania Secretary of Labor and Industry in the cabinet of Governor Robert P. Casey from 1987 to 1991, and was a surrogate for Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign. He introduced Obama in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center before Obama&#x27;s speech on race in America, &quot;A More Perfect Union&quot;.

== Early life ==
Wofford was born in 1926 in Manhattan, New York City, the son of Estelle Allison (née Gardner) and Harris Llewellyn Wofford. He was born to a wealthy and prominent Southern family.

At age 11 he accompanied his widowed grandmother on a six-month world tour. They spent Christmas Eve in Bethlehem, visited Shanghai shortly after the Imperial Japanese Army captured it, spent time in India where Wofford became &quot;fascinated&quot; by Mahatma Gandhi and visited Rome, where they saw Benito Mussolini announce Italy&#x27;s withdrawal from the League of Nations and a subsequent fascist parade. While attending Scarsdale High School, he was inspired by Clarence Streit&#x27;s plea for a world government to found the Student Federalists. By the time he was 18, the organization had grown so large that &quot;Newsweek&quot; predicted he would become president.

He served in the United States Army Air Forces during the Second World War and was a 1948 graduate of the University of Chicago. After eight months on a fellowship in India, conducting a study of the recently assassinated Gandhi, he and his wife Clare returned to America. He subsequently enrolled at historically black Howard Law School, the first white male student to do so. After one year, he concluded his studies at Yale Law School, where he received his law degree in June 1954. He began his public service career as a legal assistant for Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, serving from 1957 to 1959. In 1959, he became a law professor at University of Notre Dame. He was an early supporter of the Civil Rights Movement in the South in the 1950s, accompanying Indian activist Ram Manohar Lohia on a tour of the South in 1951 and becoming a friend and unofficial advisor to Martin Luther King Jr.

== Kennedy administration ==
Wofford first met John F. Kennedy in 1947 at a party at Clare Boothe Luce&#x27;s Connecticut home. Wofford&#x27;s political career began in 1960 when Kennedy asked him to join his presidential campaign and work with Sargent Shriver on winning over the &quot;Negro vote&quot;.

When King was imprisoned shortly before the election, Wofford and Shriver persuaded Kennedy to call King&#x27;s wife, Coretta Scott King, who faced the specter of her husband sentenced to hard labor in a Georgia prison for a minor traffic violation while she was in an advanced stage of pregnancy. This prompted Martin Luther King Sr. to switch his endorsement from Richard Nixon to Kennedy without the knowledge of Ted Sorensen, Ted Kennedy and Kenneth O&#x27;Donnell. Following the phone call, Wofford and other Kennedy aides assembled a pamphlet that referenced the call, printed on blue paper and known as the &quot;blue bomb&quot;; some 2 million copies were circulated, mostly through African American churches—&quot;below the registry of the news and white culture. It had enormous influence among black voters.&quot;

In 1961, Kennedy appointed him as a Special Assistant to the President for Civil Rights. In the White House, he served as chairman of the Subcabinet Group on Civil Rights. Wofford was instrumental in the formation of the Peace Corps and served as the Peace Corps&#x27; special representative to Africa and director of operations in Ethiopia. He was appointed associate director of the Peace Corps in 1964 and held that position until 1966. He also participated in the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965. Wofford&#x27;s book &quot;Of Kennedys and Kings: Making Sense of the Sixties&quot; details his years in the civil rights movement and the creation of the Peace Corps.

== Academic career and private practice ==
In 1966, Wofford left politics to become president of the State University of New York at Old Westbury. At the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, Wofford risked his career by allowing himself to be arrested in protest of police brutality. In 1970, he became president of Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, holding that post until 1978.

In 1978, Wofford joined the law firm of Schnader Harrison Segal &amp; Lewis LLP.

== Political career ==
=== In Pennsylvania ===
After spending seven years in private law practice in Philadelphia, Wofford served as the Chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party from June to December 1986. In March 1987, he was appointed by Pennsylvania Governor Robert P. Casey as the state&#x27;s Secretary of Labor and Industry.

=== 1991 U.S. Senate special election victory ===
On April 4, 1991, Pennsylvania&#x27;s senior U.S. Senator, H. John Heinz III, died in an aviation accident, leaving his seat in the U.S. Senate open. By law, the Pennsylvania governor was required to appoint a replacement until a special election could be held for the seat. After considering several potential candidates, including Chrysler president and Allentown native Lee Iacocca, who turned down the job, Governor Casey appointed Wofford to the seat on May 8, 1991. He had previously considered running for office, but never thought the opportunity was quite right. He thus became the first Democrat to represent Pennsylvania in the Senate since Joe Clark left office in 1969.

In the special election, held in November 1991, Wofford faced Dick Thornburgh, the former Pennsylvania Governor and U.S. Attorney General under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. Candidates for this special election were chosen by the party committees because the vacancy had happened too late to set up a primary. Wofford began the campaign so far behind in the polls that most pundits assumed he had no chance of winning. Indeed, at one point his own internal polls showed him losing by over 40 points. His eventual upset victory over the former governor by ten percentage points surprised many, and was later described as a turning point for the political prospects of President George H. W. Bush.

Wofford&#x27;s campaign was run by Paul Begala and James Carville, and their dramatic success brought them to national attention. Wofford&#x27;s campaign pivoted on a promise of universal healthcare, and according to political scientist Jacob Hacker, helped propel healthcare reform into national discussion. Themes such as the economy and health care would also be crucial to Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1992 presidential election victory. In 2015, conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh complained of Wofford, &quot;Health care as a right—you know who started that line of thinking? A guy named Harris Wofford, who was a senator from Pennsylvania.&quot;

Although Clinton ultimately chose Al Gore, Wofford was a finalist for the vice presidential nomination.

=== 1994 U.S. Senate defeat ===

Wofford Narrowly lost his seat to Republican Rep. Rick Santorum, thirty-two years his junior, who defeated him by 87,210 votes. The election was part of that year&#x27;s Republican Revolution, in which many Democrats were ousted from both houses of the United States Congress. Wofford and Tennessee&#x27;s Jim Sasser were the only incumbent Senators to lose re-election in the 1994 cycle 

== Subsequent career ==

From 1995 to 2001, Wofford served as chief executive officer of the Corporation for National and Community Service, the federal agency that runs AmeriCorps and other domestic volunteer programs. 

In 2005, he met Barack Obama. The two became friends and when Obama made his speech on race in America, &quot;A More Perfect Union&quot;, Wofford introduced him.

On January 4, 2007, Wofford was present for the swearing-in of Senator Bob Casey Jr., who defeated Santorum in his bid for a third term, and on January 3, 2013, Wofford again accompanied Casey to his swearing-in for a second term on the floor of the Senate.

From 2001, Wofford served on the boards of several charities and service organizations, including America&#x27;s Promise, Youth Service America and the Points of Light Foundation. He was a trustee to the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Non-Violent Social Change. Between 2007 and 2009, Wofford was the national spokesperson for Experience Wave, a national campaign that sought to advance state and federal policies to make it easier for mid-life and older adults to stay engaged in work and community life.

Wofford was a board member of Malaria No More, a New York-based nonprofit that was launched at the 2006 White House Summit with the goal of ending all deaths caused by malaria. He served on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service. He served as a senior fellow at the Case Foundation in Washington, D.C.

From 2012 to 2015, Wofford served as a senior advisor to the Franklin Project, a policy program of the Aspen Institute that sought to make a year of service a common opportunity and expectation for young Americans.

In 2014, &quot;The New Republic&quot; featured Wofford in its 100th Anniversary issue, in a profile titled, &quot;The Man Who Was Everywhere&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Wofford was raised an Episcopalian, and converted to Catholicism in the 1980s.

In 1948, Wofford married Clare Lindgren. The Woffords later had three children. In January 1996, Clare Wofford died of acute leukemia at age 69.

In April 2016 at the age of 90, Wofford announced that he would marry interior designer Matthew Charlton, a man 50 years his junior and his companion since 2001. That month, he published an opinion piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot; entitled &quot;Finding Love Again, This Time With a Man&quot;. Wofford and Charlton married that year.

On January 21, 2019, Wofford died at age 92 in Washington, D.C., of complications from a fall. Approximately 1,000 people attended his memorial service held on March 3, 2019, in Cramton Auditorium at Howard University. The Howard University Choir performed and speakers included his husband, his brother, his children, Wayne A.I. Frederick, Tom Wolf, Timothy Shriver, Bob Casey Jr., Bill Clinton (via video), Paul Begala, Ghebre Selassie Mehreteab and Peter Yarrow (via video), among others.

== Awards ==
*In 2002, Wofford was the recipient of the John W. Gardner Leadership Award.
*In 2011, in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the Peace Corps, the National Peace Corps Association created the Harris Wofford Global Citizen Award. It is given annually to an outstanding global leader who grew up and lives in a country where Peace Corps Volunteers served and whose life was influenced by the Peace Corps. The leader should be a person whose life&#x27;s work has made a significant contribution to the world in a way that reflects the core Peace Corps values of service, peace, development, human rights, health, and understanding.
*In 2012, Wofford received the Presidential Citizens Medal.
*In 2015, Wofford was an honored speaker at the Memorial Tribute to Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., 1917–2015, President Emeritus of the University of Notre Dame, Congregation of Holy Cross and former chairperson of the United States Commission on Civil Rights.

<doc id="749983" wikidata="Q441820" url="?curid=749983" title="Roger Wolcott (Massachusetts politician)">
<text>Roger Wolcott (July 13, 1847 – December 21, 1900) was a Republican lawyer and politician from Massachusetts. He was the 36th lieutenant governor of Massachusetts from 1893 to 1897, becoming acting governor in 1896 upon the death of Governor Frederic T. Greenhalge. He was elected the 39th governor of Massachusetts in his own right in 1897, serving until 1900. He was a leading figure in the Young Republican Club, which revitalized the Massachusetts Republican Party in the 1890s.

==Early years==
Roger Wolcott was born in Boston, Massachusetts on July 13, 1847. He was the son of Joshua Huntington Wolcott (1804-1891) and Cornelia (Frothingham) Wolcott, and was descended from Connecticut Founding Father Oliver Wolcott. His father was a successful businessman, having long been associated with the textile firm of A. &amp; A. Lawrence. Roger Wolcott was first educated at a private school in Boston. After his older brother was killed in the American Civil War, the family traveled to Europe, visiting England, Switzerland, and France, during which Wolcott continued his studies.

Upon the family&#x27;s return to Boston Wolcott entered Harvard College as a sophomore, graduating in 1870. He then attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 1874, and was admitted to the Suffolk County bar the same year. He married Edith Prescott on September 2, 1874; she was the great-granddaughter of Colonel William Prescott. The couple spent a year-long honeymoon in Europe.

==Career==
Wolcott opened a law office in Boston in 1875. He became increasingly involved in the affairs of his father&#x27;s business associates, eventually being appointed to serve on a number of corporate boards. Businesses he was associated with included the Boston and Albany Railroad and the New England Trust Company. He was also involved in philanthropic organizations, serving as a member of the Boston Provident Association, and as trustee of the Eye and Ear Infirmary and the Massachusetts General Hospital. He was a member of the Massachusetts Historical Society, and an overseer of Harvard College.

Wolcott became involved in politics not long after opening his law practice, winning a seat on the Boston Common Council in 1877 which he held for three years. He served as a member of the Massachusetts Legislature (Massachusetts General Court) from 1881 to 1884, and was offered the Republican Party nomination for Mayor of Boston in 1885, but refused on account of his father&#x27;s poor health. Wolcott cared for his father until his death in 1891.

Wolcott began to assume a more prominent role in Republican circles after his father&#x27;s death. He was a founding member and the first president of the Young Republican Club, an organization designed to inject new life into the party. This organization promoted him as a potential candidate for lieutenant governor. In the 1892 state convention, Wolcott won the nomination despite opposition from some party leaders. Even though the Republican gubernatorial candidate, William H. Haile, lost to incumbent Democrat William Russell, Wolcott won his race. He served as the 36th Lieutenant Governor from 1893 to 1897, first under Russell, and then under Republican Frederic T. Greenhalge. He assumed the gubernatorial duties as Acting Governor in March 1896 as a result of the death of Greenhalge, and was later elected as the 39th Governor in November, serving from 1897 until 1900. He was reelected each year by large popular majorities.

While Governor, Wolcott approved a bill authorizing the purchase by the Boston Elevated Railway the state-owned Tremont Street Subway tunnel, but required a public referendum on the proposed purchase. When it was brought to a vote, it was defeated by a 2-to-1 margin. When the Spanish–American War broke out in 1898, Wolcott immediately put the state on a war footing, securing legislative authorization for military expenditures in just 25 minutes. The state was one of the first to supply militia troops to the war effort.

In 1899, Wolcott decided not to run for reelection. He was offered a variety of diplomatic posts by President William McKinley, but refused them, and embarked on a trip to Europe with his family in May 1900. After his return he campaigned for Republicans in the 1900 elections. He fell ill with typhoid fever in mid-November, and died in Boston on December 21, 1900.

The trustees of Milton Academy named the largest of the campus houses after Gov. Wolcott following his death in 1900.

<text>Charles Wolfe (14 December 1791 – 21 February 1823) was an Irish poet, chiefly remembered for &quot;The Burial of Sir John Moore after Corunna&quot; which achieved popularity in 19th century poetry anthologies.

==Family==

Born at Blackhall, County Kildare, the youngest son of Theobald Wolfe (1739–1799) of Blackhall and his wife (who was also his cousin) Frances (d.1811), daughter of the Rev. Peter Lombard (d.1752) of Clooncorrick Castle, Carrigallen, County Leitrim. His father was the godfather – but widely believed to be the natural father – of Theobald Wolfe Tone. He was a brother of Peter Wolfe (1776–1848), High Sheriff of Kildare; and, their father&#x27;s first cousin was Arthur Wolfe, 1st Viscount Kilwarden.

==Education==

Not long after he was born, his father died and the family moved to England. In 1801, Wolfe was sent to a school in Bath but was sent home a few months later due to his ill health. From 1802 to 1805, he was tutored by a Dr Evans in Salisbury before being sent to Hyde Abbey School, Winchester. He seems to have been exceedingly popular both at school and within his own family. In 1808, his family returned to Ireland, and the following year he was entered into Trinity College, Dublin, graduating in 1814. He had turned down the chance to read for a scholarship as he was in love with a girl and could not commit to celibacy as was then required.

==Career==

He was ordained as a Church of Ireland priest in 1817, first taking the Curacy of Ballyclog in County Tyrone before transferring almost immediately to Donaghmore, County Tyrone. There he developed a close friendship and deep respect for the Rev. Thomas Meredith, Rector of nearby Ardtrea, and a former Fellow of Trinity College Dublin. Wolfe wrote two epitaphs for Meredith, one on his memorial in the parish church of Ardtrea, and another intended for his tomb, which can both be read within Meredith&#x27;s entry.

Charles Wolfe is best remembered for his poem, &quot;The Burial of Sir John Moore after Corunna&quot;, written in 1816 and much collected in 19th and 20th century anthologies. The poem first appeared anonymously in the &quot;Newry Telegraph&quot; of 19 April 1817, and was re-printed in many other periodicals. But it was forgotten until after his death when Lord Byron drew the attention of the public to it. Wolfe&#x27;s only volume of verse, &quot;Poetical Remains&quot; appeared in 1825 with &quot;The Burial of Sir John Moore&quot; and fourteen other verses of an equally high standard.
==Death==

Wolfe remained at Donaghmore until 1820, but, rejected by the woman for whom he gave up his academic career, and with Meredith, his only real friend in County Tyrone, now dead, he moved to the South of France. Shortly before his death he returned to Ireland and lived at Cove (now Cobh), where he died at the age of 31 of consumption, which he caught from a cow. He is buried in Cobh at Old Church Cemetery. There is also a plaque to his memory in the church at Castlecaulfield, the village where he lived whilst Curate at Donaghmore, as well as a marble monument to him at St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin.

<doc id="750002" wikidata="Q2487670" url="?curid=750002" title="Cultural regions of Lithuania">
<text>Lithuania can be divided into five historical and cultural regions (called ethnographic regions). The exact borders are not fully clear, as the regions are not official political or administrative units. They are delimited by culture, such as country traditions, traditional lifestyle, songs, tales, etc. To some extent, regions correspond to the zones of Lithuanian language dialects. This correspondence, however, is by no means strict. For example, although the Dzūkian dialect is called South Aukštaitian, it does not mean that Dzūkija is part of Aukštaitija. In certain parts of some regions, dialects of other regions are spoken, while for example in Samogitia, there are three indigenous dialects (southern, northern and western Samogitian), some of which are subdivided into subdialects.

==Regions in politics==
No region, except for Samogitia, has ever been a political or an administrative entity. Throughout most of Lithuanian history the cultural regions of Aukštaitija, Suvalkija and Dzūkija where together known as the historical land of Lithuania Proper which was the core of the Lithuanian state during the Grand Duchy era. However, some work was done recently to delineate their boundaries more clearly, as there is a project to change the system of counties in Lithuania into ethnographic regions, which would be called lands (&quot;žemės&quot;). This project is also supported by the view that with the limited functions of counties, 10 of them are not needed for Lithuania. Another supporting argument is that in other countries historical territories are being revived, while in Lithuania artificially made counties exist. The project was supported by the former president Rolandas Paksas, yet now it is not clear when or if the project will be completed at all. However, Dzūkija quite recently adopted the coat of arms and emblem which would be used if the reform were to be implemented. Alytus County, which lies almost entirely within Dzūkija, adopted soon afterwards a coat of arms that is based on the Dzūkija coat of arms. Samogitia has a flag and a coat of arms dating from the time of the Duchy of Samogitia; these symbols are considerably older than the flag of Lithuania. Lithuania Minor has a flag used since the 17th century, and an anthem originating from the 19th century. However, if the reform were to be implemented, most likely there would be just four lands, not five, because most of Lithuania minor is located within the modern borders of Russia (in the Kaliningrad Oblast) and many Lithuanians were expelled from there. The relatively small remaining part is also populated mostly by relative newcomers, as much of the local population died in the Second World War or was expelled. Therefore, Lithuania minor would probably be attached to Samogitia.

Even though the regions are not political/administrative entities, most regions have their &quot;capitals&quot; (cities which are commonly considered to be capitals). These cities are not necessarily the largest in the region.

<doc id="750005" wikidata="Q6568056" url="?curid=750005" title="List of Crimean War Victoria Cross recipients">
<text>The Victoria Cross (VC) was awarded to 111 members of the British Armed Forces during the Crimean War (also known as the Russian War) that lasted from 1854 to 1856. The Victoria Cross is a military decoration awarded for valour &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; to members of armed forces of some Commonwealth countries and previous British Empire territories. The VC was introduced in Great Britain on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War. It takes precedence over all other Orders, decorations and medals; it may be awarded to a person of any rank in any service and to civilians under military command. The first ceremony was held on 26 June 1857 where Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in Hyde Park.

In 1854, the Crimean War broke out between the Russian Empire and an alliance of France, Great Britain, the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Ottoman Empire. One of the first battles of the War was the Battle of the Alma where allied forces convincingly defeated the Russian forces. The Siege of Sevastapol followed shortly after in September 1854; it was to last for a year at the cost of over 128,000 lives, three-quarters of which died from disease. After the siege at Sevastapol, the fighting mainly ceased and on 30 March 1856, after two years of action, the Russians negotiated a Peace Treaty at the Congress of Paris. The Treaty set the Black Sea as neutral territory, closing it to all warships, and prohibiting fortifications and the presence of armaments on its shores. The Crimean War led to a number of large-scale changes in the British Army. The sale of commissions came under great scrutiny during the war, especially in connection with the Battle of Balaclava, which saw the ill-fated Charge of the Light Brigade. This scrutiny eventually led to the abolition of the sale of commissions.

The dispatches of William Howard Russell during the war highlighted how many acts of bravery and valour by British servicemen went unrewarded. There was a growing feeling amongst the public and in the Royal Court that a new award was needed to recognise incidents of gallantry that were unconnected with a man&#x27;s lengthy or meritorious service. Queen Victoria issued a warrant under the Royal sign-manual on 29 January 1856 (gazetted 5 February 1856) that officially constituted the VC. The order was backdated to 1854 to recognise acts of valour during the Crimean War. The first awards ceremony was held on 26 June 1857 where Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in a ceremony in Hyde Park.

Citations for the Crimean War, particularly those in the first gazette of 24 February 1857, listed multiple actions for about a third of the recipients. The format of each citation varied between recipients, some specify the actual date, some the name of the battle and others have both sets of information.

Until 1907, it was policy not to award the VC posthumously. Between 1857 and 1901, nine notices were published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; for soldiers who would have been awarded the VC had they survived. In a partial reversal of policy in 1902, medals were sent to the next of kin of the three mentioned for the Boer War and at the same time the first three official posthumous awards, again for the Boer War, were gazetted. In 1907, the posthumous policy was completely reversed and medals were sent to the next of kin of the remaining six officers and men. As a result of the change of policy, one quarter of all awards for the First World War were posthumous but it was only in the general revision of the warrant issued in 1920 that a clause was inserted to explicitly allow posthumous awards.

<doc id="750007" wikidata="Q62837" url="?curid=750007" title="Caspar Friedrich Wolff">
<text>Caspar Friedrich Wolff (18 January 1733 – 22 February 1794) was a German physiologist and embryologist who is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of modern embryology.

==Life==
Wolff was born in Berlin, Brandenburg. In 1759 he graduated as an M.D. from the University of Halle with his dissertation &quot;Theoria Generationis&quot;, where he revived and supported the theory of epigenesis previously proposed by Aristotle and William Harvey. The paper consisted of three parts devoted to (1) development of plants, (2) development of animals, and (3) theoretical considerations. It indicated that organs are formed in differentiated layers from undifferentiated cells. Traditional and prevailing theory had speculated that organisms were already preformed in the seed (theory of preformation), that is in the human a homunculus was already sitting in the sperm. His views were not well received. Albrecht von Haller was a powerful antagonist. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, Wolff was required to practice as a field doctor in the Prussian Army. Thereafter he had difficulty entering academic life. Finally, in 1767, with help of the mathematician Leonhard Euler he obtained the chairmanship of anatomy at the St.Petersburg Academy of Sciences (now Russian Academy of Sciences). He died in Saint Petersburg.

==Research==

Wolff&#x27;s research covered embryology, anatomy, and botany. He was the discoverer of the primitive kidneys (mesonephros), or &quot;Wolffian bodies&quot; and its excretory ducts. He described these in his dissertation &quot;Theoria Generationis&quot; after observing them in his studies on chick embryos. According to Locy, since he assumed a total lack of organization in the beginning, he was obliged to make development &quot;miraculous&quot; through the action on the egg of a hyperphysical agent; from a total lack of organization, he conceived of its being lifted to the highly organized product through the action of a &quot;vis essentialis corporis.&quot; In 1768–1769, he published his best work in embryology on the development of the intestine; of which Baer said, &quot;It is the greatest masterpiece of scientific observation which we possess.&quot; Again, according to Locy, while Wolff&#x27;s investigations for &quot;Theoria Generationis&quot; did not reach the level of Marcello Malpighi’s, those of the paper of 1768 surpassed them and held the position of the best piece of embryological work up to that of Heinz Christian Pander and Karl Ernst von Baer.

Wolff’s &quot;De Formatione Intestinorum&quot; rather than his &quot;Theoria Generationis&quot; embodies his greatest contribution to embryology; in it he foreshadows the idea of germ layers in the embryo, which, under Pander and von Baer, became the fundamental conception in structural embryology—he laid the foundation for the germ layer theory. Wolff foreshadowed the germ layer theory by showing that the material out of which the embryo is constructed is, in an early stage of development, arranged in the form of leaf-like layers. Locy recognizes Wolff as the foremost investigator in embryology before von Baer.
Wolff contended that the organs of animals make their appearance gradually and that he could actually follow their successive stages of formation.(Dye)

<text>Nelson William Wolff (born October 27, 1940) is a retired American judge and Democratic
politician from San Antonio, Texas. He represented Bexar County in the Texas House of Representatives from 1971 to 1973 and the Texas Senate from 1973 to 1975. He served on the San Antonio City Council from 1987 to 1991 and then as mayor of San Antonio from 1991 to 1995. He served as Bexar county judge from 2001 until December 31, 2022.

== Early life and education ==
Wolff was born and raised in San Antonio. He earned a Bachelor of Business administration from St. Mary&#x27;s University and a Juris Doctor from the St. Mary&#x27;s University School of Law.

==Career==

Wolff is only the second person to serve as both San Antonio mayor and county judge of Bexar County. (The first was Bryan Callaghan, Jr., who became mayor in 1885 and county judge in 1892.)

With his late father and two brothers, he owned several businesses, most notably Sun Harvest Farms grocery stores and Green Fields Market, a health foods and organic grocery store in San Antonio, which Wolff sold in 2011.

Wolff has penned five books. In &quot;Challenge of Change,&quot; he describes his experience in the Texas legislature and his participation in the 1974 Constitutional Convention, of which he was instrumental in bringing about. In &quot;Baseball for Real Men&quot;, Wolff reflects on life and his love of the game. &quot;Mayor&quot; is a memoir of San Antonio politics focusing on his time in City Hall. In &quot;Transforming San Antonio&quot; (Trinity University Press) Wolff gives an insider&#x27;s view on signature economic-development projects with which he was involved: the AT&amp;T Center, a Toyota factory, the PGA Village, and the extension of the San Antonio River Walk. He also authored the book &quot;95 Power Principles: Strategies for Effective Leadership in Government,&quot; which documents the lessons learned over his decades in public service and in business.

Wolff was initially appointed to this current position in 2001 to succeed Cyndi Taylor Krier, a Republican, who resigned to accept an appointment from then Governor Rick Perry as a regent of the University of Texas System. Wolff has since been elected to this position three times. In January 2012, he announced that he would seek a fourth full term in 2014. He defeated in the general election the Republican candidate, Carlton L. Soules, a former member of the San Antonio City Council from the North Side. Known as a &quot;budget hawk&quot; while on the council, Soules since entered into an alliance with the unsuccessful 2017 San Antonio mayoral candidate Manuel Medina, the chairman of the Bexar County Democratic Party organization. The two had opposed a defunct a downtown street car project, which they considered a &quot;boondoggle.&quot;

Wolff won re-election as county judge in the general election held on November 6, 2018. He defeated the Republican nominee, Probate Judge Tom Rickhoff.

In October 2021, Wolff announced that he would not seek re-election for the position of county judge.

== Personal life ==
Since 1989, Wolff has been married to his second spouse, the former Tracy Hoag. He has four children from the first marriage to Melinda Wolff: Kevin Alan, Lyn Marie, Scott, and Matthew. He has two stepchildren through the second marriage. His oldest son from his first marriage, Kevin Wolff (born c. 1965), a Republican, served with his father on the Bexar County Commissioners&#x27; Court as the Precinct three commissioner until 2021. The two disagreed over a downtown streetcar plan favored by the father and adamantly opposed by the son. They agreed on a proposal to build a rail system with the use of eighteen miles of existing Union Pacific track from downtown San Antonio to Leon Springs.

The Nelson W. Wolff Municipal Stadium, home field of the San Antonio Missions located off U.S. Highway 90 near the intersection with State Highway 151, is named in his honor.

<text>Sir David Robinson (13 April 1904 – 10 January 1987) was a British entrepreneur and philanthropist. 

He donated £18 million to the University of Cambridge to establish a new college in his name. Robinson College, Cambridge, the newest in the university, was formally opened in 1981. 

Robinson also donated £3 million to start the Rosie Hospital, named after his mother, which is now a part of Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital in Cambridge.

Robinson was born in Cambridge, England, the third of six sons and third of nine children of Herbert Robinson, cycle shop and later garage owner, and his wife, Rosie Emily Tricker. 

He was educated at the Cambridge and County High School for Boys, which according to the &quot;Cambridge Evening News&quot; &quot;had been started in 1900 to meet the requirements of boys who are likely to follow industrial and commercial pursuits&quot; and which he left at the age of fifteen in order to work in his father&#x27;s bicycle shop in Cambridge. 

In 1930 he moved to Bedford, where he took over a garage and developed it into a large and prosperous firm. In the late 1930s, he built a business renting radios and televisions, which was commercially successful.

Robinson was also involved with horse-racing: in the late 1960s and 1970s he owned a large number of winning horses which also yielded significant profits. His racing stables, Clarehaven, was one of the biggest racing stables in England. His string of 120–150 horses was split between two trainers, Michael Jarvis and Paul Davey.

He was knighted in 1985, and died two years later in Newmarket, the centre of English horse-racing.

<text>ohGr is a Canadian industrial band formed by Nivek Ogre and Mark Walk of Skinny Puppy. Early ohGr releases incorporated hip hop and synth-pop influences, and in contrast to Skinny Puppy, utilized conventional structures and a lighter tone. Ogre noted that this direction was inspired by the pop bands he enjoyed as a child, such as The Archies. However, in releases such as &quot;Devils in my Details&quot;, ohGr has taken to a more abrasive, non-linear flavour of electro-industrial, while continuing to release pop albums such as 2018&#x27;s &quot;Tricks&quot;.

==History==

The band was officially formed in 2000, although the material for the first album, &quot;Welt&quot; dates back to the mid-nineties, having been held up due to legal trouble with American Recordings. W.E.L.T. was actually originally the title of the group (an acronym of &quot;When Everyone Learns Truth&quot;), until it was discovered that in the interval it had been taken by a Californian punk band. Al Jourgensen was also originally involved (who had the then band&#x27;s name tattooed in anticipation of the project), and only one track he collaborated on has been leaked to the public, titled &quot;Noreen&quot;. The music of that song later became industrial metal group Ministry&#x27;s &quot;The Fall&quot;, on their 1996 album &quot;Filth Pig&quot;.

ohGr&#x27;s third album titled &quot;Devils in my Details&quot; was released on October 17, 2008 in Germany, on October 20 in the United Kingdom, and on October 21 in the United States. ohGr toured in support of the album release during the autumn of 2008. At Comic-Con 2008, Ogre announced that Bill Moseley will be contributing to the new ohGr album, as a result of them becoming friends through Repo! The Genetic Opera. 

It was tentatively revealed in a chat with the band that an album of B-sides from Devils in my Details (entitled &quot;D-Sides&quot;) and an album of unreleased material from the 1990s (entitled &quot;Dfault&quot;) was due to be released. In October 2009 a link to www.wdihtf.com appeared on Skinny Puppy&#x27;s website. When users sign up to the mailing list they receive a link to the song COLLIDOSKOPE which starts with many different voices saying &quot;Welcome to Collidoskope&quot;.

As of May 10, 2011, ohGr has released a new studio album, &quot;unDeveloped&quot;. The album was a collaboration with Mark Walk, with whom the previous album was created. Also on the album was the audio from the 911 call reporting Michael Jackson&#x27;s death (Track titled &quot;crash&quot;).

In 2017, ohGr announced a PledgeMusic campaign to raise funds for their new album &quot;Tricks&quot;. The album was originally scheduled for release on October 31, 2017, but was delayed due to mastering errors. The band submitted their final mix to PledgeMusic in Spring 2018, but received no word from the company regarding payment. Without the money promised by PledgeMusic, the band released the album digitally and went on tour without any physical media to sell. Walk went to the media following reports of similar situations happening to other bands who were using PledgeMusic. According to Walk, the band had received only $40,000 of the $140,000 they had raised during the campaign and were unable to pay for the manufacturing of the products they promised fans.

==Touring==
The band toured in 2001 to support the release of their debut album &quot;Welt&quot;; the live band consisted of Nivek Ogre, Tim Sköld (bass), cEvin Key (drums, keyboards), Loki der Quaeler (keyboards), and William Morrison (guitars). 2003 saw the release of a follow-up, &quot;SunnyPsyOp&quot; (a play on the phrase &quot;sunny side up&quot; and military PsyOps). There were initially plans to tour for &quot;SunnyPsyOp&quot;, with Ministry in a festival type arrangement. These plans fell through, although much of the material from the second album had already been played live on the &quot;Welt&quot; tour.

2008 saw ohGr on tour throughout the U.S. and Canada in support of the album &quot;Devils in my Details&quot; with a live band including William Morrison returning on guitars, drummer Justin Bennett, keyboardist Jeff &quot;Squigg&quot; Smith.

In late 2011, ohGr announced a December 2011 West Coast USA and Canada tour consisting of nine dates with direct support by fellow Metropolis Records artist Left Spine Down.

==Videos==

ohGr has released three promotional videos, all directed by William Morrison. The first was a stop-motion creation for the track &quot;Cracker&quot;. The second was a live performance of &quot;Minus&quot;, filmed by Michael Condo at several venues from the 2001 tour. The third was for &quot;MaJiK&quot;, from the second album; this also employed stop-motion, and was a collaboration with artist Thomas Kuntz. &quot;Cracker&quot; and &quot;MaJiK&quot; have both been played occasionally on MTV2 and Fuse. All three have been available through ohGr&#x27;s website, and &quot;MaJiK&quot; appeared on the audio CD for &quot;SunnyPsyOp&quot;, albeit with some serious technical glitches.

<doc id="750023" wikidata="Q1676408" url="?curid=750023" title="J. Samuel White">
<text>J. Samuel White was a British shipbuilding firm based in Cowes, taking its name from John Samuel White (1838–1915).

It came to prominence during the Victorian era. During the 20th century it built destroyers and other naval craft for both the Royal Navy and export customers; they also built lifeboats and various types of commercial vessels.

There was another &#x27;White&#x27;s engineers and shipyard&#x27; of Cowes, that of William White &amp; Sons (1883 - 1929); the use of the term &#x27;White&#x27;s of Cowes&#x27; may lead to confusion.

==History==

The family had a long tradition of shipbuilding in Kent, with James White constructing the cutter &quot;Lapwing&quot; for the Royal Navy at Broadstairs in 1763–1764, as well as fast vessels for the Revenue services and fishing smacks, and even a number of West Indiamen. At least three generations of the White family business undertook shipbuilding before Thomas White, (1773–1859) the grandfather of John Samuel White, moved from Broadstairs, to East Cowes on the northern coast of the Isle of Wight in 1802, where he acquired the shipbuilding site on the east bank of the River Medina where there was already more than a century of shipbuilding tradition. In the closing years of the Napoleonic War he began work on what would become the &#x27;Thetis&#x27; Yard across the river on the West bank on the &#x27;salterns&#x27; and marsh between the Medina and Arctic roads. It opened officially on 1 October 1815. J. S. White subsequently rebuilt the east bank site which in 1825 became the Falcon Yard.
Records indicate that by the 1850s J. S. White&#x27;s docks with its steam sawmills and engine shops, and the mast and block shops, provided work for around 500 craftsmen. J Samuel White expanded still further in 1899. It rapidly became a world leader in the design and construction of small- to medium-sized naval and merchant ships, and also built numerous smaller craft, including more than 130 lifeboats for the RNLI, more than any other builder.

Sir Barnes Wallis, later famous as an aeronautical engineer, worked as a draughtsman for the company at the start of his career, before moving to Vickers to design airships.
An expansion of the yard in 1911 led to the purchase of a large 80 ton hammerhead crane from Babcock &amp; Wilcox of Renfrew, Scotland. The crane was installed in 1912 on the Cowes side of the river and still survives, it was last used in 2004, and now Grade II* listed. 

At the height of its shipbuilding activities, J. S. White had shipbuilding slipways on the eastern side of the River Medina at East Cowes and fitting-out quays, engineering works and administration offices at Cowes on the western side of the river. 

In 1922 J. S. White established the &#x27;Island Transport Co. Ltd.&#x27; with barges running from Southampton, (and initially Portsmouth) to East Cowes to carry supplies for the shipyards. Any spare capacity was used to carry general, commercial cargo. After the shipyards closed in 1965, the trade was just general cargo. The Island Transport company was sold to the Red Funnel Group in 1968.

At some time, J. S. White acquired the Henry Bannister, rope making business of Cowes.

In 1954 J. S. White acquired the shipbuilding business of William Weatherheads at Cockenzie, Scotland. the business was carried on under the name &#x27;William Weatherhead &amp; Sons (1954) Ltd&#x27; until 1965 when it was renamed &#x27;J. Samuel White (Scotland) Ltd&#x27;. 

In 1961 J. S. White acquired the postcard and greeting-card printing business of J. Arthur Dixon with production facilities at Newport, Isle of Wight and at Inverness, Scotland. The company was sold in 1974 to the Dickinson Robinson Group.

With the regular construction of turbines, boilers, steam and diesel engines, the Cowes site became an engineering works. 

With the closing of the shipbuilding section in 1965, the works on the East Cowes side of the river were sold to the British Hovercraft Corporation in 1966.

In 1968 the company received a take-over bid for the whole group of companies from the Foreign and Colonial Investment Trust; by December 1968 the take-over was complete - at this time it was reported that there were 1000 people employed over the group.

In 1971 Foreign and Colonial Investment Trust sold the company to Spectrol Holdings, a UK subsidiary of the Carrier Corporation of Syracuse, New York. 

By 1979 the company had been renamed Elliott Turbomachinery Ltd and employed almost 850 people; and the American parent company, the Carrier Corporation, was taken over by another American company, United Technologies.

In 1981 the company finally ceased trading and the sites were closed.

&quot;Sammy&quot; White built well over two thousand vessels at their various shipyards at East Cowes between 1803 and their closure in 1963.
== Naval vessels ==
An order in 1911 of six destroyers for the Chilean Navy, these destroyers were fitted with J. S. White&#x27;s own design of water-tube boiler, the White-Forster boiler. These were similar to contemporary three-drum boiler designs, but had a remarkable number of smaller tubes.

==Aircraft production==

In 1912 the company began constructing aircraft at East Cowes in a &quot;Gridiron Shed&quot; on the bank of the River Medina with Howard T. Wright as general manager and chief designer. Because of its location on the Isle of Wight the company choose the name Wight Aircraft.

Between 1912 and 1916 the company moved its aircraft manufacturing facilities across the river to Cowes and built a number of seaplanes:
*Wight Pusher Seaplane
*Wight Twin
*Wight Seaplane
*Wight Baby
*Wight Bomber
*Wight Converted Seaplane
*Wight Quadruplane
*AD Seaplane Type 1000

In 1913 the company produced a flying boat which was displayed at the London Air Show at Olympia in 1913. The company also manufactured 110 Short Type 184 aircraft designed by Short Brothers.

Through 1916–1917 the company developed the Wight Quadruplane prototype fighter. This aircraft was tested at Martlesham Heath from 1917, and was written off in 1918.

==Commercial vessels==
J. S. White&#x27;s built ships for commercial customers, including:
*&quot;Lady Forrest&quot; pilot boat built in 1903 for the Fremantle Harbour Trust in Western Australia, now preserved by the Western Australian Maritime Museum. 
*Crested Eagle, a paddle steamer built in 1925 for the General Steam Navigation Company, later requisitioned and sunk during the Dunkirk evacuation.

<text>George Tyler Wood (March 12, 1795 – September 3, 1858) was an American military officer and politician who served as the second Governor of Texas.

==Background==
Most records dealing with Wood&#x27;s personal life have been lost due to fire or other causes. As a result, many details about his life are unknown. Wood was born near Cuthbert, Georgia on March 12, 1795. His mother was Elizabeth Burris Wood. His father, whose name is unknown, died when he was five. When he was nineteen, Wood raised a company of volunteers for the Creek War and fought in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. According to tradition, Wood met Sam Houston and Edward Burleson during the campaign.

Wood operated a successful dry goods business based in Cuthbert. During a buying trip in 1837, he met a young widow named Martha Evans Gindrat, daughter of Jesse and Elizabeth (Fitzpatrick) Evans, during a stop in Milledgeville, Georgia. The two married on September 18, 1837. The marriage produced two children in addition to the three Martha brought from her previous marriage. Beyond his business interests, Wood was a member of the Georgia General Assembly from 1837 to 1838.

==Texas==
In 1839, Wood and his family moved to the Republic of Texas. After exploring the Brazos, Colorado and Trinity rivers, he selected a site near the present-day town of Point Blank in Liberty County (now in San Jacinto County). At this site he quickly built a prosperous plantation.

Wood was elected to the Congress of the Republic of Texas in 1841, representing Liberty County in the House of Representatives. In 1845, during the annexation of Texas by the United States, he represented his home county during the convention which wrote the state constitution Wood was elected to the Texas Senate following Texas&#x27;s admission to the United States. When the Mexican–American War began, he resigned his senate seat and became Colonel of the Second Regiment Texas Mounted Volunteers. During his service he was present for the capture of Monterrey.

==Governorship==
The 1847 decision of Governor James Pinckney Henderson not to seek another term left a wide-open race for his replacement. A race dominated by five candidates developed with the key issue being how to deal with the public debt. About a month before the election, one of the candidates, Isaac Van Zandt, died of yellow fever. Most of Van Zandt&#x27;s support shifted to Wood. As a result, he won the election with 7,154 votes compared to second-place finisher James B. Miller with 5,106.

When the governor took office, Texas had US$5,500,00 in outstanding bonds with no apparent means to repay the debt. To deal with the public debt, he advocated a plan to sell state land to the U.S. Federal government. The Texas Legislature did not support this plan and, after negotiations with Wood, passed a bill calling for the state Accountant and comptroller to determine the exact amount of debt before a method of payment was determined.

The Wood administration also saw an intensification of a dispute over the status of New Mexico. Texas considered New Mexico part of its territory, but the U.S. government did not recognize the claim. To strengthen its claim, the Texas Legislature created Santa Fe County and the eleventh judicial district. When the judge appointed to preside over the new district arrived in Santa Fe, he found U.S. Army soldiers already in the city who were determined to support the federal position.

Other issues Wood dealt with were organizing towns and counties, establishing court buildings, and reforming government operations. To defend the state&#x27;s western frontier, a request was sent to Congress asking for a string of forts to be constructed. Reapportionment of the state was the most contested issue to arise during Wood&#x27;s term. The coastal and central sections of the state, fearing loss of representation, opposed the proposal, while the northeastern section supported the effort. Despite the opposition, a reapportionment bill was passed by the legislature.

On February 21, 1848, Wood presided over the Texas Democratic convention, the first true political convention held in the state. This was followed by an 1849 effort to win a second term. The primary challenger to the governor was Peter H. Bell, who ran on the issues of frontier defense and the New Mexico dispute. Wood strongly defended his positions but was defeated by a margin of 10,319 votes to 8,754.

==Later life==
After leaving office, Wood returned to his farm. In addition to his plantation, he established a mercantile business in Galveston. He made unsuccessful runs to be elected Governor in 1853 and 1855. He died at his home on September 3, 1858.

<text>John Job Crew Bradfield (26 December 1867 – 23 September 1943) was an Australian engineer best known as the chief proponent of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, of which he oversaw both the design and construction. He worked for the New South Wales Department of Public Works from 1891 to 1933. He was the first recipient of an engineering doctorate from the University of Sydney, in 1924. Other notable projects with which he was associated include the Cataract Dam (completed 1907), the Burrinjuck Dam (completed 1928), and Brisbane&#x27;s Story Bridge (completed 1940). The Harbour Bridge formed only one component of the City Circle, Bradfield&#x27;s grand scheme for the railways of central Sydney, a modified version of which was completed after his death. He was also the designer of an unbuilt irrigation project known as the Bradfield Scheme, which proposed that remote areas of western Queensland and north-eastern South Australia could be made fertile by the diversion of rivers from North Queensland.

==Early life==
Bradfield was born on 26 December 1867 in Sandgate, Queensland. He was the fourth son of Maria (née Crew) and John Edward Bradfield, and also had four sisters. His father was a Crimean War veteran who had arrived in Brisbane from England in 1857. Bradfield began his education at the North Ipswich State School before winning a scholarship to Ipswich Grammar School. He was the dux of his school and won the chemistry medal at the senior public examination in 1885. The colonial government awarded him an exhibition to attend the University of Sydney, as Queensland did not have a university of its own at the time. He enrolled at St Andrew&#x27;s College and graduated as a Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) in 1889, winning the University Medal.

After graduating, Bradfield began working for the Queensland Railways Department as a draftsman under the chief engineer. He married Edith Jenkins in 1891, with whom he had five sons and a daughter. In the same year, he was retrenched due to an economic depression, and instead moved to New South Wales where he became a draftsman in the Department of Public Works. Bradfield became an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1893 and returned to the University of Sydney to complete a Master of Engineering (MEng) degree, where he won first-class honours and was again awarded the University Medal. He was a founder of the Sydney University Engineering Society and later served two terms as its president.

==Professional career==

Bradfield worked on a variety of projects during his time at the New South Wales Department of Public Works, including the Cataract Dam near Sydney and the Burrinjuck Dam across the Murrumbidgee River. In January 1909, he was promoted to the rank of assistant engineer with a salary of £400. The following year he applied unsuccessfully for the position of foundation chair of engineering at the University of Queensland. In 1913 he was appointed chief engineer for metropolitan railway construction, when he commenced his long association with Confidential Secretary, Kathleen M. Butler. In 1915 Bradfield submitted a report outlining a grand scheme for Sydney&#x27;s railways involving the electrification of the suburban railways, a city underground railway and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. World War I led to the collapse of all three proposals.

During World War I, Bradfield worked with Professor Warren and Mr A.E. Cutler to establish the first civil aviation school, where pilots were trained for overseas service.

In 1924, Bradfield was awarded the degree of Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) for a thesis titled &quot;The city and suburban electric railways and the Sydney Harbour Bridge&quot;, the first doctorate in engineering awarded by the University of Sydney. In 1935 the University of Queensland awarded him the &quot;ad eundem&quot; degree of Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.).

===Sydney Harbour Bridge and Bradfield railway scheme===

It was not until 1922 that the Bridge Bill passed through Parliament. Much of his work on the Sydney Harbour Bridge involved the assistance of his Confidential Secretary Kathleen M. Butler, who undertook work which would now be described as that of a project manager or technical adviser, involved in the checking of specifications and negotiations with tenderers and setting up the project&#x27;s London office in 1924 at Dorman Long and Co Ltd, the contractors appointed to the bridge project. 

Bradfield had a grand vision for Sydney&#x27;s railway system. Bradfield called for the provision of a network of underground city railway lines beneath Sydney&#x27;s central business district, the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and a new railway station, Central. While the central idea of an underground loop beneath the city was implemented, and stub tunnels built at designated interchanges for provision of future lines, many of his related ideas remain unimplemented. A larger network of lines was proposed for the western, eastern and southern suburbs, however most of these lines remain conceptual and have never been constructed.

The building of the bridge coincided with the construction of a system of underground railways in Sydney&#x27;s Central business district, known today as the City Circle, and the bridge was designed with this in mind. The bridge was designed to carry four lanes of road traffic, flanked on each side by two railway tracks and a footpath. Both sets of rail tracks were linked into the underground Wynyard railway station on the southern end of the bridge by symmetrical ramps and tunnels.

The eastern-side railway tracks were intended for use by a planned rail link to the Northern Beaches, though they were used for tram services from the North Shore to Wynyard station. The intention was to operate tram services until the implementation of a heavy rail service to the Northern Beaches; however, when tram services were discontinued in 1958, they were converted into extra road traffic lanes, which now serve the Cahill Expressway and a city-bound bus lane.

The Depression, and later World War II, along with the post-War growth of motor vehicle usage led to projected patronage of passenger services in Bradfield&#x27;s plan being overestimated. Parts of the city underground were constructed and exist as the present-day City Circle. Small sections were also built for additional proposed city lines, such as additional platforms at Wynyard and St James railway stations which have never been used for heavy rail transport.

In 1923, the first sod was turned on the city railway. The City Circle was constructed originally as a stub line to St James, via the Town Hall, Wynyard and towards the Harbour Bridge. It was not until 1955 that the loop was completed by the construction of Circular Quay station. A line to the eastern suburbs was eventually built, but along a different alignment to that envisaged by Bradfield, who proposed a line along Oxford Street.

Bradfield retired from the New South Wales Department of Public Works at the end of July 1933 after 42 years of service with the intention of continuing to work as a consulting engineer.

===Other works===

Bradfield was the designer and consulting engineer for the Story Bridge, Brisbane. He also designed the Cataract and Burrinjuck Dams.

In October 1938 Bradfield published a proposal (known as the Bradfield Scheme) for diverting some coastal rivers of Queensland onto the western side of the Great Dividing Range. However, it was never implemented. Bradfield designed the Circular Quay railway station. but it was not built until many years after his death.

==List of significant projects==
A number of Bradfield&#x27;s works are listed on the Australian, New South Wales, and Queensland heritage registers:

===Bridges, viaducts and other infrastructure===
===Railway stations===
==Personal life==

Bradfield married Edith Jenkins, daughter of John Ventris Jenkins, in Brisbane on 28 May 1891. They had one daughter Mary Margaret (1892–1984) and five sons: Edward (born 1893), Anthony Bailey (1895–1974), Alan (1903), Stanley George (1906–1951), and Keith Noel Everal (1910–2006). Keith (known as Bill) Bradfield, an engineer with the Department of Civil Aviation, was responsible for changes to Alexandra Canal adjacent to Sydney Airport allowing the airport to expand between 1947 and 1970.

Bradfield died at home in the Northern Sydney suburb of Gordon on 23 September 1943. A memorial service was held at St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral and he was buried at St John&#x27;s Anglican Church, Gordon beside his daughter Mary Margaret. His wife Edith died in 1954 and is interred with him.

==Honours==
Named in his honour are Bradfield highways in both Sydney and Brisbane, the Federal electorate of Bradfield, the North Shore Sewerage Bradfield Carrier in West Killara and Bradfield Senior College, a school for the creative industries in St Leonards. A footbridge in his home town of Ipswich, Queensland was named in his honour in 2010.

A Fellow of the Senate of the University of Sydney, Bradfield was awarded the Peter Nicol Russell Memorial Medal by the Institution of Engineers Australia, and appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1933.

In 1934 he was awarded the Telford Medal by the Publications Committee of the Institution of Civil Engineers of London for his paper &quot;The Sydney Harbour Bridge, and its Approaches&quot;. In July 1936 the Institution of Civil Engineers in London elected Bradfield as a member of council representing Australia. In August 1940, a plaque was placed on the Story Bridge recognising the contributions of many of those involved, including Bradfield in Brisbane. He was awarded Queensland Institute of Engineers lifetime achievement award in 2007.

The Bradfield Highway in Sydney, which is the main roadway section of the bridge and its approaches, is named in honour of Bradfield&#x27;s contribution to the bridge.

The locality of West Lindfield, the western part of Lindfield, was originally called Bradfield, between 1924 and 1977, and over that period, was named after John Bradfield. There is still a road there, called Bradfield Road.

In March 2021 it was announced that a new city centre would be named Bradfield by the New South Wales government. The advanced manufacturing and airport city will be built next to Sydney&#x27;s second airport at Bringelly. The name was selected with community input. A panel made the final decision to honour Bradfield&#x27;s lasting impact on Sydney, including his major role in the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

<text>James Wood (January 28, 1741June 16, 1813) was an officer of the Continental Army during the American Revolution and the 11th Governor of Virginia. He was an abolitionist.

==Early life==
Born in Winchester, Virginia, on January 28, 1741, Wood was the son of an immigrant of the same name who performed surveys for Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron and helped found the town. He was educated privately and became active like his father in the local parish, Christ Episcopal Church in Winchester.

==Career==
In February 1760, he was appointed Deputy Clerk of the County Court. From 1766 to 1775, he served in the Virginia House of Burgesses. He married Jean Moncure, and they had no children who lived into adulthood.

Wood was commissioned a captain of Virginia troops by the Governor, Lord Dunmore, in 1774. He took part in the Battle of Point Pleasant during Dunmore&#x27;s War and afterward negotiated the Treaty of Fort Pitt with the Shawnee Indians.

==American Revolutionary War service==
In 1776 Wood was appointed lieutenant colonel of the Frederick County Militia. In February 1777, he became commander of the 12th Virginia Regiment, and he led the regiment during the Philadelphia campaign and Monmouth campaigns of the next two years. In late 1777, he quartered at the house also occupied by the family of Sally Wister, who described him as &quot;of the most amiable of men.&quot; His regiment was redesignated the 8th Virginia Regiment in September 1778, and Wood was appointed Superintendent of the Convention Army when British prisoners from the Saratoga campaign were moved to Charlottesville, Virginia. He continued in that capacity until it was dissolved in January 1783, when he was promoted to brigadier general in the Virginia militia.

After the war, Wood became an original member of the Virginia Society of the Cincinnati.

==Politics==
From 1784 to 1796, Wood was a member of Virginia&#x27;s Executive Council.

He was chosen as an elector for the 1789 election from Hampshire District. That District consisted of Berkeley County, Frederick County, Hampshire County, Hardy County, Harrison County, Monongalia County, Ohio County and Randolph County, which cover the area which is now the eastern part of West Virginia and the northernmost county of Virginia, all within Virginia&#x27;s 1st congressional district, which also included Shenandoah County.

All ten of the Virginia electors who voted cast one of their two votes for George Washington. 5 of them cast their other vote for John Adams. 3 voted for George Clinton. 1 cast his for John Hancock. 1 cast his for John Jay. Which elector voted for which vice presidential candidate is not known.

A Federalist, in 1796, Wood was elected as Virginia&#x27;s eleventh governor and served until 1799, after previously being the Federalist gubernatorial candidate in 1794. In addition to being an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati, he was also a leading member of an early abolition society in Virginia. Wood served as President of the Society of the Cincinnati from 1802 until his death.

==Death and legacy==
Wood died in Richmond on June 16, 1813. He was buried at Richmond in St. John&#x27;s churchyard.

James Wood High School and James Wood Middle School in Frederick County, Virginia are named after the famous Revolutionary War Colonel, as is Wood County, West Virginia.

<text>M People (stylised as &quot;M&quot;People) is an English dance music band that formed in 1990 and achieved success throughout most of the 1990s. The name M People is taken from the first letter of the first name of band member Mike Pickering, who formed the group. In December 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked them as the 83rd most successful dance act of all time. As of 2021, M People have sold over 11 million records worldwide 

==Career==
===Formation===
Pickering had been a member of Factory Records dance act Quando Quango, but became more noted as one of the original DJs at The Haçienda. Paul Heard was a member of acid jazz band Ace of Clubs, and Shovell had previously been in the collective Natural Life. The original plan had been to have a roster of different singers for different songs but having been spotted by Pickering and Heard, Heather Small became the distinctive vocalist of the group. She had been in the English soul band Hot House, which had released a number of critically acclaimed records without scoring any major success.

===&quot;Northern Soul&quot; and breakthrough===
Their first release came in the form of &quot;Colour My Life&quot;, a limited white label pressing which got them some recognition, but it was the first official single &quot;How Can I Love You More?&quot; that gave them their first Top 30 hit and a following in and around the Manchester club scene, where Pickering was still DJing. Their first album &quot;Northern Soul&quot; provided other singles, including a full release of &quot;Colour My Life&quot;, &quot;Someday&quot; and &quot;Excited&quot;, followed by a re-release and repackaging of the album.

===&quot;Elegant Slumming&quot; and success===
1993 started with the re-released and remixed single from 1991&#x27;s &quot;How Can I Love You More?&quot; which was released at the end of January and provided the band with their first Top 10 single, peaking at number 8. While this single was in the chart the band were working on new material for the second album to be released that autumn; a preliminary single, &quot;One Night in Heaven&quot; was released in the summer and peaked at number 6. It provided them with a dance/pop success that set up a bigger worldwide hit with the second single, &quot;Moving On Up&quot;. The album &quot;Elegant Slumming&quot; went into the Top 5 on release and peaked at No. 2, remaining on the chart until the following summer and later winning the band a Mercury Music Prize. A further two Top 10 singles followed: &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Any Further&quot; (a cover of the Dennis Edwards song, the video for which was shot in Berlin) in December, and &quot;Renaissance&quot; which was used as the theme tune to the BBC 2 show, &quot;The Living Soap&quot;, sending the single to number 5 in the UK Singles Chart.

===&quot;Bizarre Fruit II&quot; and awards===
In 1994 and 1995, M People won the BRIT Award for Best British Dance Act, the latter as a result of the release of &quot;Bizarre Fruit&quot;. The first single from that album was &quot;Sight for Sore Eyes&quot; which climbed to number 6, helping the album to enter the UK Albums Chart and peak at No. 4 and stay in the Top 10 for four months into the following year. The second single from the album was &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;, which became their seventh consecutive Top Ten hit in two years and at the &quot;Brit Awards&quot; &#x27;95 they collaborated with Sting on his track &quot;If You Love Somebody Set Them Free&quot;. Their third single &quot;Search for the Hero&quot; was later used in the TV advertising campaign for the Peugeot 406. The song got to number 9 in the chart.

In 1995, the band embarked on their first world tour entitled the Come Again Tour and two more singles were lifted from a re-issued album: &quot;Bizarre Fruit II&quot; which charted and peaked one place higher at number 3; these singles were a remixed &quot;Love Rendezvous&quot; and &quot;Itchycoo Park&quot;. The former was the least successful single from the album charting at number 32, and the latter was a cover of The Small Faces 1967 single, which charted at number 11, although the choice of the latter song to cover drew negative comments from the media.

In the United States, their biggest success was on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, where they achieved five Top 5 singles, four of which hit number one.

After touring and promotion of &quot;Bizarre Fruit II&quot; for 18 months the band took a break in 1996. The album, having been released in November 1995, did not leave the chart until April 1997, becoming one of the biggest selling albums of the decade. They made some outdoor live UK performances called the &quot;Summer M Parties&quot; in June 1996, at Crystal Palace, Alton Towers plus a televised performance on BBC 1 on 29 June 1996 from Old Trafford, Manchester for &quot;The Crowd are on the Pitch: The Euro &#x27;96 Extravanganza&quot;, where they performed along with bands Dodgy, Madness and fellow Mancunians Simply Red and comedians Nick Hancock and Jo Brand to a crowd of 60,000 at party celebrating the Euro 1996 football championships.

===Return and &quot;Fresco&quot;===
In March 1997, lead singer Heather Small gave birth to her son. With the closure by BMG of the deConstruction label in 1996, the band founded their own record label, M People Records, to release the forthcoming album. In September they released the lead single &quot;Just for You&quot;, which peaked at number 8 on the chart and two weeks later, their album &quot;Fresco&quot;, was released and went in the UK Albums Chart at number two, going on to sell 1.1 million copies and certified platinum. The band achieved their third multi-platinum selling album and this time appeared on Jools Holland&#x27;s BBC 2 show, performing album tracks &quot;Never Mind Love&quot;, &quot;Angel St&quot; and Small also performed, solo, the million-selling charity single that she appeared on, &quot;Perfect Day&quot;.

&quot;Fresco&quot; also bore the single, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; (number 33) and went on a fifteen-date UK Tour supporting the album to rave reviews. The final single lifted off the album was &quot;Angel St&quot; which got to number 8 and earned them their tenth Top 10 chart hit in March 1998, making the band one of the most consistent hit-makers of the 1990s on both sales and airplay.

===&quot;The Best of M People&quot;===
During the middle of 1998, the band prepared for their fifth album, a compilation entitled &quot;The Best of M People&quot; which also contained three new tracks: &quot;Testify&quot;, &quot;Dreaming&quot; and a cover of the Doobie Brothers classic: &quot;What a Fool Believes&quot;. The album went on to sell 1.75 million, peaked at number 2 and was certified 3× platinum. Of the three new tracks, &quot;Testify&quot; and &quot;Dreaming&quot; were released as singles. &quot;Testify&quot; got to number 12 in October 1998 and &quot;Dreaming&quot; got to number 13 in February 1999, their eighteenth and final single to date.

After the release of &quot;The Best of M People&quot;, the band took an extended hiatus. Heather Small recorded a successful solo album: &quot;Proud&quot; and it seemed that the band had split. However, a re-packaged greatest hits album entitled &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot; and released in 2005 led the band to embark on a short promotional tour of the UK. Small continued to pursue a solo career releasing her second solo album &quot;Close to a Miracle&quot; in 2006.

M People toured once again in 2007 as part of the Forestry Commission&#x27;s 2007 Forest Tours at Delamere Forest, Cheshire; Dalby Forest, North Yorkshire Moors; Thetford Forest, Suffolk and Westonbirt Arboretum, Wiltshire to support The Forestry Commission&#x27;s social and environmental programmes. Small said: &quot;We have played in many different locations but never in forests so we’re really looking forward to doing these gigs&quot;. In addition to these gigs M People performed at the Hampton Court Festival in Surrey, London on 12 June 2007, and the Chichester Real Ale and Jazz festival on 4 July 2007. Elsewhere, they played a concert in Warsaw, Poland on 7 September 2007. The band also played some festival dates in 2008 before Small starred as a contestant in that year&#x27;s BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; in the UK.

In 2012, as part of a series of Summer Concerts in Kew Gardens from 3–8 July, M People were one of five acts performing live on each day of the five days. The other acts included Status Quo, Will Young, James Morrison and the Gipsy Kings. M People performed a 60-minute set on Wednesday 4 July supported by Chic featuring Nile Rodgers.

===2013 Greatest Hits Tour===
In April 2013, it was announced that the band would undertake an extensive fourteen date Greatest Hits Tour in October to mark 20 years since the release of the Mercury Music Prize-winning album &quot;Elegant Slumming&quot;. This was the band&#x27;s first UK Tour since 2005&#x27;s Ultimate Collection Tour, although Pickering did not take part.

===2020 box set===
In 2019, it was announced that a box set of the M People catalogue was scheduled to be released. The box set, titled &quot;Renaissance&quot;, was released in March 2020 and included all five of the group&#x27;s albums, as well as a large selection of bonus remixes and two DVDs that presented the group&#x27;s music videos and live performances from the Come Again tour. Also included was a book with notes from the band, rare photos and a handwritten copy of the lyrics to &quot;Search for the Hero&quot;.

<doc id="750048" wikidata="Q6573957" url="?curid=750048" title="List of Indian Mutiny Victoria Cross recipients">
<text>The Victoria Cross (VC) was introduced in Great Britain on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War. For the Indian Mutiny (also known as India&#x27;s First War of Independence, Revolt of 1857, or the Sepoy Mutiny) the VC was awarded to 182 members of the British Armed Forces, the Honourable East Indies Company (HEIC) and civilians under its command. The VC is the highest British honour and is awarded for valour &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot;. Created in 1856 for the British Army and Royal Navy, eligibility was extended in 1857 to members of the HEIC and in 1858 to non-military personnel bearing arms as volunteers. 

Queen Victoria created the tradition of the British monarch presenting the VC to the recipient, personally presenting 74 of the 111 awards for the Crimean War. Many VCs for the Indian Mutiny were sent to India for presentation and while there is documentation for 42 presentations, the information on 51 presentations which were likely presented in India is vague and it not known if the medal was personally presented or received by post. There were 18 Indian Mutiny VCs sent to next of kin where the award was posthumous, or the recipient died before presentation. The Queen personally presented 63 Indian Mutiny awards after the recipients returned to the UK.

The Indian Mutiny began as a mutiny of sepoys of British East India Company&#x27;s army on 10 May 1857, in the town of Meerut. It soon erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions largely in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, with the major hostilities confined to present-day Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, northern Madhya Pradesh, and the Delhi region. The rebellion posed a considerable threat to Company power in that region, and it was contained only with the fall of Gwalior on 20 June 1858. The rebellion proved to be an important watershed in Indian history; it led to the dissolution of the East India Company in 1858, and forced the British to reorganise the army, the financial system, and the administration in India. India was thereafter governed directly from London—by the British government India Office and a cabinet level Secretary of State for India—in the new British Raj, a system of governance that lasted until 1947.

Indian troops were not originally eligible for the VC, because since 1837 they had been eligible for the Indian Order of Merit—the oldest British gallantry award for general issue. When the VC was created, Indian troops were still controlled by the Honourable East India Company, and did not come under Crown control until 1860. European officers and men serving with the Honourable East India Company were not eligible for the Indian Order of Merit; the VC was extended to cover them in October 1857. The first citations of the VC varied in the details of each action; some specify one date, some date ranges, some the name of the battle and others have both sets of information. The Indian Mutiny holds the record for the most VCs won in a single day; 24 on 16 November 1857, of which 23 were at the Second Relief of Lucknow and one was for an action south of Delhi.

The original royal warrant did not address the question of posthumous awards, and a policy to avoid posthumous awards was adopted. Between the Indian Mutiny in 1857 and the beginning of the Second Boer War, the names of nine officers and men were published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; with a memorandum stating they would have been awarded the Victoria Cross had they survived. A further three notices were published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; in September 1900 and April 1901 for the Second Boer War. On 8 August 1902, as an exception to policy for the Second Boer War, a notice was published stating the Victoria Crosses were to be sent to next of kin of the three mentioned in the notices in 1900 and 1901. In the same notice the first official posthumous awards were announced. Five years later in 1907, the posthumous policy was reversed for earlier wars, and medals were sent to the next of kin of the six of nine officers and men whose names were mentioned in notices in the &quot;Gazette&quot; dating back to the Indian Mutiny. Prior to the reversal of policy It had been discovered that the crosses of three of the five Indian Mutiny memoranda names had been sent to next of kin shortly after the memoranda was gazetted. The Victoria Cross warrant was explicitly amended to allow posthumous awards in 1920, but one quarter of all awards for World War I were posthumous..

<text>Bold indicates chief judge or chief justice. The Ohio Supreme Court was created by the Ohio Constitution of 1802 with three judges, and had three or four through 1851. In 1851, the number of judges was increased to five. In 1892, the number of judges was increased to six. In 1912, the office of chief justice was created and the total number of judges was increased to seven (including the chief justice). In 1968, all the supreme court judges were re-titled as justice.

==Supreme Court Commission==

In 1875, the Constitution of Ohio was amended to provide for the Supreme Court Commission. The amendment reads in part: &quot;A commission, which shall consist of five members, shall be appointed by the governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate, the members of which shall hold office for the term of three years from and after the first day of February, 1876, to dispose of such part of the business then on the dockets of the Supreme Court, as shall, by arrangement between said commission and said court, be transferred to such commission; and said commission shall have like jurisdiction and power in respect to such business as are or may be vested in said court; and the members of said commission shall receive a like compensation for the time being, with the judges of said court.&quot;

===Commission of 1876===
On February 2, 1876, Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes appointed the following six members:
*Josiah Scott of Crawford County
*William Wartenbee Johnson of Lawrence County
*D. Thew Wright of Hamilton County
*Richard A. Harrison of Franklin County
*Henry C. Whitman of Hamilton County
*Luther Day of Portage County

Harrison refused the appointment, and Thomas Q. Ashburn of Clermont County was seated March 16, 1878. The commission sat until February 2, 1879, and &quot;assisted in bringing up the docket which had fallen behind the reasonable time for trial.&quot;

===Commission of 1883===
Governor Charles Foster appointed another commission of four men, which served from April 17, 1883 to April 16, 1885.
*George K. Nash of Franklin County
*Franklin J. Dickman of Cuyahoga County
*Charles D. Martin of Fairfield County

<doc id="750056" wikidata="Q6596635" url="?curid=750056" title="List of Second Boer War Victoria Cross recipients">
<text>The Victoria Cross (VC) is a British military honour awarded to 78 members of the British Armed Forces for action during the Second Boer War. The Victoria Cross is a military decoration awarded for valour &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; to members of the armed forces of some Commonwealth countries and previous British Empire territories. The VC was introduced in Great Britain on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War, and takes precedence over all other orders, decorations and medals. It may be awarded to a person of any rank in any service and to civilians under military command. The first ceremony was held on 26 June 1857, when Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in Hyde Park.

The Second Boer War was fought from 11 October 1899 to 31 May 1902, between the British Empire and the two independent Boer republics of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic (Transvaal Republic). After a set of failed negotiations over foreigner land rights in the territories, led by Joseph Chamberlain, both sides issued ultimatums. When the ultimatums were rejected, war was declared. The war had three distinct phases. First, the Boers mounted pre-emptive strikes into British-held territory in Natal and the Cape Colony, besieging the British garrisons of Ladysmith, Mafeking and Kimberley. The Boers then won a series of tactical victories against a failed British counteroffensive to relieve the three sieges. The second phase began after British forces under Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts, launched counteroffensives with increased troop numbers. After Natal and the Cape Colony were secure, the British were able to invade the Transvaal and the republic&#x27;s capital, Pretoria, was captured in June 1900. The third phase began in March 1900, when the Boers engaged a protracted hard-fought guerrilla warfare against the British forces. In an effort to cut off supplies to the raiders, the British, now under the leadership of Lord Kitchener, responded with a scorched earth policy of destroying Boer farms and moving civilians into concentration camps.

The British Government had expected the campaign to be over within months, and the protracted war became increasingly unpopular especially after revelations about the conditions in the concentration camps. Emily Hobhouse, a campaigner, had forced the British Government to set up the Fawcett Commission, led by suffragist Millicent Fawcett, into the conditions at the camps. Hobhouse published reports from the camps which told of thousands of deaths from disease and malnutrition. These reports helped to sway public opinion against the war. The demand for peace led to a settlement of hostilities, and in 1902, the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed. The two republics were absorbed into the British Empire, although the British were forced to make a number of concessions and reparations to the Boers. The granting of limited autonomy for the area ultimately led to the establishment of the Union of South Africa.

The original Royal Warrant, was silent on whether the VC could be awarded posthumously. From 1857 until 1897, 18 recipients were gazetted after their deaths but only 12 of the next of kin received the actual medal. In the other six cases there was a memorandum stating that they would have been recommended for the VC had they survived. By 1899, the precedent had been established that the VC could be awarded posthumously if the recommendation for the award was submitted prior to the recipient&#x27;s death from wounds. Two such awards were granted during the Second Boer War, the well known award to Frederick Roberts, the son of Lord Roberts, and to Francis Parsons. In 1900 and 1901, three memoranda were issued for Herman Albrecht, Robert Digby-Jones and David Younger stating they would have been recommended for the VC had they survived. In a partial reversal of policy restricted to the Second Boer War, it was announced in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 8 August 1902, that the next of kin of the three soldiers mentioned in memoranda would be sent medals. In the same gazette, the first three posthumous awards were gazetted to Alfred Atkinson, John Barry and Gustavus Coulson. In 1907, the posthumous policy was reversed and medals were sent to the next of kin of the remaining six officers and men. Although the Victoria Cross warrant was not amended to specifically include posthumous awards until 1920, one quarter of all awards for the First World War were posthumous.

<doc id="750062" wikidata="Q8037702" url="?curid=750062" title="Wrecking amendment">
<text>In legislative debate, a wrecking amendment (also called a poison pill amendment or killer amendment) is an amendment made by a legislator who disagrees with the principles of a bill and who seeks to make it useless (by moving amendments to either make the bill malformed and nonsensical, or to severely change its intent) rather than directly opposing the bill by simply voting against it.

An important character of wrecking amendments is that they are not moved in good faith, that is, the proposer of the amendment would not see the amended legislation as good legislation and would still not vote in favour of the legislation when it came to the final vote if the amendment were accepted. Motives for making them include allowing more debate, delaying the enactment of the legislation, or oftentimes a direct attempt to convince the bill&#x27;s legislator to withdraw said bill.

Some opponents of particular amendments will describe them as wrecking amendments because they regard the amendments as undermining the unity of the original proposal. Proponents of the amendment may seek to deny the charge by saying that the original proposal brings together different steps, and while personally they oppose all the parts, some parts are even worse than others and legislators should have an opportunity to consider them separately. 

Wrecking amendments can pick up more votes than motions against, because observers tend to focus on who voted in favour and against the Bill in the final count, rather than looking at the amendments made during the passage through the legislature.

==Examples==
*The Wyoming House of Representatives Committee of the Whole amended House Bill 0085, a proposal to study the state&#x27;s emergency preparedness, in order to kill the bill. The amendment would have required the state to consider purchasing an aircraft carrier (even though Wyoming is a landlocked state), purchasing fighter jets, establishing a military, initiating a draft, and creating a currency. Also, the creation of a currency would violate the United States Constitution.
*The US Civil Rights Act of 1964 was amended at the last minute by Rep. Howard W. Smith of Virginia to make &quot;sex&quot; as a protected class alongside race. This was regarded as a wrecking amendment by those who thought that labor unions would oppose this proposal. The author of the Bill claimed otherwise, and the Act ultimately passed with the amendment.

<text>Abberley is a village and civil parish in north west Worcestershire, England.

It is situated on the northern slopes of Abberley Hill, which is tall, between the River Severn and River Teme. The civil parish had a population of 788 in the 2021 census.

==Location==
Abberley lies halfway between Worcester and Tenbury, at the junction with the road from Worcester to Cleobury Mortimer. The parish was described in 1905 as being &quot;about six miles in length, and nowhere more than one mile in breadth&quot;. At the 2001 census, it had the youngest population of any Worcestershire village.

==The village==
Abberley is a village of three distinct parts. The oldest part, known as The Village, clusters around the 12th century and 13th century parish church of St. Michael. To the west, and divided from the Village by farmland and the Cleobury road, is The Common, where the largest part of the population lives, new housing is being added, and there is a village shop-cum-post office. Between the Village and the Common, on the Cleobury road, are the Parochial VC primary school and the Village Hall.

Overlooking the village is the third part of Abberley, The Hill, with scattered farms, houses and cottages across the steep slopes of Abberley Hill.

On the far side of Abberley Hill from the village, to the south of the Worcester-Tenbury road, lies Abberley Hall. Abberley Hill forms part of the Abberley and Malvern Hills Geopark. The Hill lies on the path of the Worcestershire Way, a long-distance hiking trail.

Abberley has two churches, a primary school, a modern village hall, and nearby a country hotel and restaurant, The Elms.
Abberley Hall School, a preparatory school set in the grounds of Abberley Hall, closed on 1 July 2023. Abberley Clock Tower is the setting for the children&#x27;s book by Gene Kemp, &quot;The Clock Tower Ghost&quot;.

==History==

The name Abberley probably relates to the 6th century Saxon chief Eobald, by way of &quot;Eobaldelega&quot;, then &quot;Eobaldsleigh&quot;. According to &quot;The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-names&quot;, Abberley is derived from &#x27;Eadbald&#x27;s wood or clearing&#x27; (&quot;Eadbald&quot; + lēah). Abberley is recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086–7 as &quot;Edboldelege&quot;, when it was held by Ralph de Tosny, and was later recorded as &quot;Albodeslega&quot; in c.1150, &quot;Abbedeslegh&quot; in 1216, &quot;Ab(b)ot(t)eley(e)&quot; in 1346-1485 and &quot;Aberley&quot; in 1480.

In 1405 Abberley Hill was at the centre of a protracted stand-off between two major armies, that of Henry IV camped on Abberley Hill itself and the primarily Welsh army of Owain Glyndŵr camped on nearby Woodbury Hill. Eventually, cut off from their supply line, the Welsh withdrew, never again to penetrate so far into England.

Abberley was in the upper division of Doddingtree Hundred.

On 10 March 1803 Colonel Henry Bromley inherited the Manorship of Abberley. As he had no son, on his death in 1836, the manor was put up for sale by his executors and bought by John Lewis Moilliet of Geneva. He built a new house, Abberley Hall, but he died in 1845 before it was completed.

Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 Abberley Parish ceased to be responsible for maintaining the poor in its parish. This responsibility was transferred to Martley Poor Law Union. 
== Churches ==

A little to the north, across the Green (developed as a Millennium project) from the village, is the large Victorian St. Mary&#x27;s church, built between 1850 and 1852. It was designed by John Jenkins Cole and enlarged by the same architect in 1877 following a fire in January 1873.

It was built to replace St. Michael&#x27;s church when the latter fell into disrepair, though the chancel of St. Michael&#x27;s was later restored and is still used for some services.

<doc id="750077" wikidata="Q464786" url="?curid=750077" title="Volkswagen Touran">
<text>The Volkswagen Touran is a car manufactured by German automaker Volkswagen since 2003 and sold in Europe and other select markets. A compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV), it fills a gap in Volkswagen&#x27;s model lineup between the Volkswagen Golf, with which it shares its platform, and the Volkswagen Sharan, its larger counterpart, which ceased production in 2022. The vehicle has been sold in Japan as the Golf Touran and the crossover-styled variant as the CrossTouran. The name &#x27;Touran&#x27; is derived from the combination of &#x27;Tour&#x27; and &#x27;Sharan&#x27;. Despite the similarity of their names, the Touran is not related to the North American market Volkswagen Routan. The vehicle is delivered in five or seven seat versions.


==First generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 1T; 2003)==

Announced back in August 2002, the Touran, whose production started in December 2002 and sales commenced in 2003, is the first Volkswagen MPV based on a Golf platform, more precisely the first vehicle on PQ35 platform. It joined Volkswagen&#x27;s existing MPV line up that included the Sharan and Caravelle (Volkswagen Bus).

Volkswagen explained the name Touran was created from the word &quot;Tour&quot;, i.e. to travel, with the addition of the end syllable from its big brother Sharan.

It can be considered an extended version of the Golf Plus, since their front ends are similar in size, while the Touran&#x27;s rear overhang is longer (and therefore a seven-seater, while the Golf Plus is a five seater).

The Touran introduced electro-mechanical steering, a first in its class and for Volkswagen. It is able to vary the weight of the steering depending on the road speed. Due to the lack of energy consumption in idle it also improves the overall efficiency of the vehicle. The Touran was the first vehicle to use Volkswagen&#x27;s 2.0 TDI engine.

The engines available at the launch included a 1.6 FSI and two diesel engines, the 1.9 TDI with and the 2.0 TDI . The engines are EURO 4 compliant, except the 1.9 TDi when paired with the DSG (direct shift gearbox). The Touran launched with a six speed manual gearbox as standard, and a DSG for the 1.9 TDI Engines.
===Safety===
The initial test of the Touran in 2003, resulted in a four star rating for adult protection. Volkswagen made slight changes to the Touran from November 2003, adding &quot;an intelligent reminder for the driver and front passenger to buckle their seat belts.&quot; This allowed the Touran to be retested the same year, scoring a single extra point, and so giving the car a five star rating for adult protection:
===Facelift (2006)===
The Touran received a facelift for the October 2006 Paris Motor Show.
====Park Assist====
The 2007 model year Touran was the first production vehicle in the Volkswagen Group to be released with the new Park Assist technology. Park Assist helps the driver parallel park the vehicle. Firstly, after having activated the feature and whilst travelling up to 30 km/h Park Assist uses sensors to attempt to identify a suitable parking spot (defined as 0.8 metres longer than the length of the vehicle).

The driver then stops ahead of the parking spot, releases the steering wheel, but continues working the gears, accelerator and brake pedal as advised by the display panels, as the Park Assist controls the steering to park the vehicle.

====CrossTouran====
At the December 2006 Bologna Motor Show, Volkswagen released the third Cross vehicle designed by Volkswagen Individual GmbH.

The CrossTouran is distinguished from a standard Touran by its 17-inch alloy wheels, redesigned plastic guards which ape a crossover vehicle, and a higher suspension/chassis setup that is optional for standard Tourans in Europe.

All CrossTouran engines are EU4 compliant.

&quot;Petrol engines&quot;
*1.6 MPI with 75 kW / 102 hp
*1.4 TSI with 103 kW / 140 hp
*2.0 TSI with 125 kW / 170 hp

&quot;Diesel engines&quot;
*1.9 TDI with 77 kW / 105 hp
*2.0 TDI with 103 kW / 140 hp
*2.0 TDI with 125 kW / 170 hp

===Second facelift (2010)===
When the vehicle was released to the markets in August 2010, the Touran was updated to the newer Golf VI looks. This included as new features compared to the previous generation the option for DCC (Volkswagen&#x27;s adaptive suspension system), Light-Assist for Xenon Headlights, an improved Park-Assist System that can also handle perpendicular park positions and updated infotainment systems. The aerodynamics of the car were also improved, the Cw improved from 0,315 to 0,307.

In late 2010, SAIC-VW released the new Touran in China. Though its front was updated to the German style, the tail keeps the design of the previous generation model. The electronic systems of this domestically produced car were upgraded as its relative in Europe. A 1.4 TSI, which can output 93 kW, was added to the new model.

New engines were available following the downsizing trend, a 1.2 with and a new 1.6 TDI with or . They replaced the 1.6 and 1.9 TDI from the previous model. The 1.2, and 1.6 TDI were also available as BlueMotion, Volkswagen&#x27;s low fuel consumption vehicle program.

In 2012, the engine was replaced with the .

===Engines===
The Touran is available with petrol, diesel and compressed natural gas (CNG) engines.
The diesel models of the Touran offer better fuel economy. Given the proper conditions, it is possible to achieve over in a diesel Touran.

The car is delivered with a five- (1.6 only) and six speed manual transmissions, Tiptronic six speed automatic transmission (in 1.6, 1.6 FSI and 2.0 FSI (2003 to 2006 only)) or the DSG twin clutch automatic transmission; the 1.4 TSI, the 1.6 FSI from 2003 to 2006, the 1.9 TDI from 2003 to 2008, and the 2.0 TDI uses the six speed version, and the 1.9 TDI since the middle of 2008 use the seven-speed dry clutch version.

As for the 2010 model, an updated version of the 2.0 TDI engine was launched with common rail technology. The engine was introduced in the Volkswagen Passat in the models from 2008.

===Touran Hy Motion and Hybrid===
The Touran Hy Motion is Volkswagen&#x27;s Hydrogen Development concept. It has a nickel-metal hydride battery which produces , it does the 0–100 km/h (0-62 mph) sprint in 14 seconds and has a top speed of .

In 2008, Shanghai-Volkswagen with Tongji University had released a Touran Hybrid, as part of the lead up to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.

A prototype of the Touran Hybrid was shown with a electric motor in conjunction with a petrol engine, the transmission will most likely be Volkswagen&#x27;s Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG).

===Minor yearly changes===
Distinguishing different model years of the model can be difficult, but there are some minor changes which can help:
*up to 10/2004, the fog lights use a projector lens, after that, it was changed to a reflector type
*for the 2008 model year, the colour of the tinted glass was changed from green to gray (change was not applied to SAIC-VW built vehicles)
*for the 2009 model year, the fog lights were changed again, this time from a round shape, to a slightly elipsoid one, the grilles surrounding them are new also.
*for the 2010 model year, the 1T2 generation, received new side rear-view mirrors, from the Golf 6
*from 10/12/2012, the 1T3 received a sound insulated front windscreen, with the rain and light sensor being moved down 10mm

===Awards and safety===
*The Touran won &quot;What Car?&quot;″s 2005 Compact Van of the Year award.
*The Touran scored a maximum five star Euro NCAP crash safety rating.

== Second generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 5T; 2015) ==

The second generation Touran was introduced at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show. It uses the Volkswagen Group MQB platform and offers increased cabin space, four new engines with 19% less fuel consumption, and an array of new advanced driver-assistance systems and infotainment options. Autoradio with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is included as an option.

Visually, the car resembles Golf Sportsvan with an elongated rear trunk. 

The drag coefficient was reduced to 0,296. 

=== China market ===

The Touran currently serves as the successor to the Volkswagen Santana in Shanghai&#x27;s taxi fleet since October 2018, as the Santana was phased out. Qiangsheng, one of the largest taxi firms in Shanghai, stated that the Touran offered greater passenger comfort over its predecessor. 100 new electric cabs were also added to the taxi fleet. The Chinese market Touran L has the same wheelbase as the european model. It is available in 280TSI and 330TSI trims with the 1.4 litre TSI, known as the CSS in China, available on 280TSI models and the 1.8 litre TSI for 330TSI models. A 5 speed manual gearbox option is available on 280TSI models along with the 7 speed direct shift gearbox. 330TSI models come standard with the latter gearbox. The Touran L came standard in 5 seater configurations only when new. Pricing in 2016 ranged between 155,800 yuan and 230,800 yuan with 7 trim levels (23,850 to 35,330 USD - January 2021 exchange rate). Trim levels were known as: 280TSI Fashion (manual and DSG), 280TSI Comfort (manual and DSG), 280TSI Elegant (DSG only), 280TSI Deluxe and 330TSI Deluxe. A 1.6 litre engine was only available for the 2018 model year under the Fashion trim level. Six-seater and seven-seater configurations were added to the range for the 2018 model year onwards.

<text>The Volkswagen Caddy is a panel van and leisure activity vehicle (M-segment) produced by the German automaker Volkswagen Group since 1979. It is sold in Europe and in other markets around the world. The Volkswagen Caddy was first introduced in North America in 1979 and in Europe in 1982. The first and second generations also had pick-up (coupe utility) variants.

The following vehicles are related to the Volkswagen Caddy and are also manufactured by the Volkswagen Group.
*&quot;Typ&quot; 14 was derived from the Volkswagen Golf Mk1,
*&quot;Typ&quot; 9K was derived from the Volkswagen Polo Mk3 (Volkswagen Caddy) / SEAT Ibiza Mk2 (SEAT Inca) platform,
*&quot;Typ&quot; 9U was rebadged Škoda Felicia pickup,
*&quot;Typ&quot; 2K was derived from the Volkswagen Touran platform with Golf Mk5 front suspension,
*&quot;Typ&quot; SB was rebadged for the third generation of the Ford Tourneo Connect since 2021.

==First generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 14; 1979)==

Released in 1979, the first Volkswagen Caddy is a coupe utility and van based on the Volkswagen Group A1 platform, shared with the small family car Volkswagen Golf Mk1.

Volkswagen &quot;Typ&quot; is: 
*147 = LHD (Left hand drive)
*148 = RHD (Right hand drive)

===Rabbit Pickup===

The Caddy came to fruition when Volkswagen of America was experimenting with Golf derivatives, developing an estate and a pickup truck with a bed. VW of America&#x27;s engineering team was led by Duane Miller, who acknowledged the initial design was completed in partnership with Sheller Globe.

Volkswagen of America was interested in the pickup, and Volkswagen released the Volkswagen Rabbit Pickup in North America, produced at the Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly Plant in Pennsylvania from 1978 to 1984. Trim levels such as LX and Sportruck were available.

In North America, the Rabbit Pickup was equipped with one of two engines: originally a 1.6-litre petrol engine, joined by a 1.5-litre diesel for 1980. These were soon replaced by a 1.6 diesel with or a 1.7 petrol engine with . One unique feature of the diesel was that it came with a five-speed gearbox, with the fifth gear, carrying a 0.76:1 ratio, labeled as &quot;E&quot; for &quot;Economy&quot;. Fuel consumption was rated at on the EPA city/highway cycles for the petrol engine with the four-speed manual and a corresponding for the five-speed diesel. Observed fuel consumption for the diesel with no load and driven at a steady in fifth gear was , dropping to at . The maximum interior width of the bed was and the rated payload was . In Canada and many other markets outside of the United States, a turbodiesel version was also available.

The first cars under the name Rabbit Pickup were sold in the United States in late 1979 for the 1980 model year, delayed from a planned spring 1979 rollout. It was not sold as the Caddy until three years later, when the model was introduced to Europe as the Caddy. Cosmetically, the North American Rabbit Pickup had rectangular headlamps, while the rest of the world received round headlamps.

The Volkswagen Rabbit Pickup competed with compact pickups, such as the Ford Courier, Datsun Truck, Toyota Hilux, Dodge Rampage and Subaru BRAT.

===Worldwide===
The Caddy nameplate was never used in North America. Its first use was in 1982, when the vehicle was released in Europe. European Caddys were built in Volkswagen&#x27;s plant TAS in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (at the time SFR Yugoslavia), between 1982 and 1992. A fibreglass-reinforced plastic box cap was available to cover the open bed, turning the Caddy into a small panel van with an enclosed of cargo volume, and it also could be used as a caravan with an appropriate in-bed unit.

The original Caddy also was produced in Uitenhage, South Africa, from 1981 until 2007, alongside the first generation Golf itself (which was sold until 2009).

Worldwide production of the first-generation &quot;Typ&quot; 14 Rabbit Pickup/Caddy totaled more than 207,000 vehicles. For the pickup truck market, Volkswagen sold the Taro, a rebranded Toyota Hilux, from 1989 to 1997; the Caddy name continued in 1995 as a slightly smaller panel van and multi-purpose vehicle developed with Škoda and SEAT.

===Engine specs===

==Second generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 9K/9U; 1996)==
Released in 1995, the Volkswagen Caddy &quot;Typ&quot; 9K, or Volkswagen Polo Caddy, was a light van, designed by Volkswagen&#x27;s Spanish subsidiary SEAT, and derived from the SEAT Ibiza 6K, on the Volkswagen Group A03 platform. The area of the cargo floor is , while the loading volume is . Typical payload is , depending on drivetrain and market specifics, and the two rear cargo doors are of a 60/40 split design. Safety features were improved from the previous generation, reflecting a changing market: Driver airbag was standard and a passenger airbag was optional, ABS and what Volkswagen called an Electronic Differential Lock (EDL) was also available. In spite of the name, EDL is not a true differential lock: sensors monitor wheel speeds, and if one is rotating substantially faster than the other (i.e., slipping), the EDL system momentarily brakes it. This effectively transfers all the power to the other wheel. Air conditioning was an available option.

It was built in Spain, at the Martorell factory of SEAT, from 1996 to 2004. Its twin, the SEAT Inca, was quickly phased out when the SEAT marque was realigned as the &quot;sporty&quot; branch of the Volkswagen Group.

It was in production in Argentina until 2008 for the Latin American market. In 2005 the Argentinian-made Caddy (called the Derby Van or Pointer Van, depending on the market) received a facelift which was never sold in Europe, with a front treatment similar to that of the Polo Classic (6K; 1999 facelift).

==Third generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 2K; 2004)==
The third generation of Volkswagen Caddy debuted at the end of 2003, at the RAI Commercial Vehicle Show in Amsterdam, with production commencing in May 2004.

The &quot;Typ&quot; 2K shares 50% of its modules with the Volkswagen Golf Mk5 and Volkswagen Touran. The new model Caddy has a more aerodynamic design, the angle of the windscreen and A pillar is more horizontal, making the dashboard bigger and the bonnet (hood) smaller.

There are two body sizes: &quot;normal&quot; and Maxi. These can both be configured as a Panel Van, a Window Panel Van, Kombi (spartan passenger version), Caddy Life (family version), and a Camping version called the Caddy Tramper or Caddy Life Camper.

A Caddy Life or Kombi seats up to five in two rows while a Caddy Life Maxi or Kombi Maxi seats up to seven in three rows. The Life version has interior trimmings like that of a conventional five seater wagon while the Kombi is a naked panel van with windows and seats. The difference in road noise between the two is described by some as substantial.

It resembles the compact MPV Touran, and is assembled at the Poznań factory in Poland. In May 2007, British Gas signed a landmark deal which saw 1,000 vans being supplied to the firm, which were fitted with a bespoke racking system and a speed limiter, designed by Siemens. The deal was renewed in September 2015.

===Caddy Life===

The Caddy Life, a seven-seat passenger oriented People Mover, debuted at the 2004 Geneva Motor Show. It comes with twin sliding doors and a payload.

Caddy Life has a flexible seating system. The two rear bench seat rows can be taken out of the vehicle altogether to give the vehicle 2850 litres of cargo room; in addition, the Caddy Life has a towing capacity.
In 2005, a Special Edition Caddy Life Colour Concept with two distinctive colours, Red Spice and Ravenna Blue, was released with upholstery fabrics, floor mats and a variety of other elements on the dash panel in the same colour as the exterior body, and a leather trimmed steering wheel, gear and handbrake lever.

===Caddy Maxi and Caddy Maxi Life===

Debuting at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles presented the Caddy Maxi Life the people mover version of the Maxi range. The Caddy Maxi range carried over all of the Caddy engine and debuted the 2.0L TDI engine producing .

The Caddy Maxi family is longer version of the Caddy with 4.2 m3 loading space, this is due to extensions of the wheelbase which measures an extended, rear overhang now , plus the growth between the sliding doors and the rear axle now at and payload is up to to on commercial versions.

The Caddy Maxi Tramper, the camping version of the Caddy Maxi, debuted at the 2008 AMI Leipzig Motor Show along with the Caddy Maxi EcoFuel Study.

The vehicle has MSRP of 250,000 Swedish krona (US$34,200 or €22,000).

===Caddy 4Motion===
At the 2008 IAA (Hannover Motor Show), Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles revealed the all wheel drive Caddy 4Motion range teamed with the 1.9 TDI engine and manual transmission.

Early in 2010, the Caddy Maxi range will receive the 4Motion drivetrain.

===Caddy in Australia===
Since its introduction in the Australian market in 2003, the Caddy range has taken the market lead for small vans, with a 42% share in 2007. Even with the more premium pricing over its competition, buyers are still willing to pay more for the TDI and DSG transmission options.

<doc id="750086" wikidata="Q4281667" url="?curid=750086" title="Marina Tsvigun">
<text>Marina Tsvigun (), or Maria Devi Christos by assumed name, (born 1960) is a religious sect leader of the New Community of Enlightened Humanity, also known as YUSMALOS or &quot;The Great White Brotherhood&quot;. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union it was one of the conspicuous New Age movements in the former republics, with about 80,000 members by official count.

== Biography ==
Tsvigun was born in 1960 in Stalino, Ukrainian SSR, USSR. She served as a functionary for the Young Communist League district committee, worked as a newspaper journalist and an editor for Donetsk textile factory radio network.
In 1990 she attended lectures by Yuri Krivonogov, the &quot;White Brotherhood&quot; co-founder, who recognized Tsvigun as a new messiah and later received the role of &quot;Higher Priest&quot; of the Great White Brotherhood.
The members were required to renounce their family ties and donate money and property to the Brotherhood. The Great White Brotherhood came into conflict with the Russian Orthodox Church.

== Arrest and imprisonment ==
Tsvigun predicted the Time of Apocalypse and the coming of the Holy Spirit on November 10, 1993. The event was supposed to be accompanied by her sermons in the Sophia Cathedral. On the appointed day, the members of the Brotherhood stormed the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv and were arrested.

According to the report of the Orthodox Church, Kyiv City Court found Tsvigun and Krivonogov guilty of violating citizens&#x27; health under the guise of religious ceremonies and seizing by force. They were sentenced to 4 and 7 years in prison. The White Brotherhood protested to the United Nations and the International Court. Six months later, in August 1997, Tsvigun was freed as a part of an amnesty on the 6th anniversary of the independence of Ukraine.

== After prison ==
After serving the term, Tsvigun changed her name and surname to Victoria Victorovna Preobrazhenskaya and married John-Peter II, a brotherhood member (real name Peter Kovalchuk). Under the name of Victoria, she started a new multidimensional project &quot;Cosmic Poliart of the Third Millennium of Victoria Preobrazhenskaya&quot; and tried to renew the Great White Brotherhood registration as a public organization, which was denied.

She continued her activities and organized &quot;The Mystic College of Isis and Her Followers.&quot;

As of November 2008, she lived in Russia, where she ran an art gallery, &quot;Dom Solntsa&quot;.

She published doctrine pamphlets &quot;The Science about Light and Its Transformation&quot; (available in Russian) and &quot;The Last Testament of the Mother of the World&quot;, both written by her in prison.

In 2011 she started a new magazine called “Victoria RA”, which is available on her website.

<doc id="750087" wikidata="Q4434136" url="?curid=750087" title="List of First World War Victoria Cross recipients">
<text>The Victoria Cross (VC) was awarded 628 times to 627 recipients for action in the First World War (1914–1918). The Victoria Cross is a military decoration awarded for valor &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; to members of armed forces of some Commonwealth countries and previous British Empire territories. It takes precedence over all other Orders, decorations and medals; it may be awarded to a person of any rank in any service and to civilians under military command. The award was officially constituted when Queen Victoria issued a warrant under the Royal sign-manual on 29 January 1856 that was gazetted on 5 February 1856. The order was backdated to 1854 to recognize acts of valor during the Crimean War. The first awards ceremony was held on 26 June 1857, where Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in a ceremony in Hyde Park.

The First World War, also known as the Great War and in the United States as World War I, was a global military conflict that embroiled most of the world&#x27;s great powers, assembled in two opposing alliances: the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance. More than 70 million military personnel were mobilized in one of the largest wars in history. The main combatants descended into a state of total war, directing their entire scientific and industrial capabilities into the war effort. Over 15 million people were killed, making it one of the deadliest conflicts in history. The proximate cause of war was the assassination on 28 June 1914 of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. Soon after, a system of alliances were activated that would see Europe at war. The Western Front saw the largest concentration of Commonwealth troops with soldiers occupying sectors of the line from the North Sea to the Orne River.

On 1 July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme, the British Army endured the bloodiest day in its history, suffering 57,470 casualties and 19,240 dead; nine Victoria Crosses were awarded for action on that day. Most of the casualties occurred in the first hour of the attack. The entire Somme offensive cost the British Army almost half a million men. The war was not just fought on land; the First World War saw major naval battles as well as the first large-scale use of military aircraft. The war at sea was mainly characterized by the efforts of the Allied Powers in blockading the Central Powers by sea. In return, the Central Powers attempted to break that blockade and establish an effective blockade of the British Isles and France with U-boats and raiders. The largest naval battle of the First World War was the Battle of Jutland which was the only full-scale clash of battleships in that war. Four Victoria Crosses were awarded for action at Jutland. The war in the air saw 19 VCs being awarded to airmen. The First World War saw significant interest in flying aces, including the German Manfred von Richthofen—also known as The Red Baron—as well as British aces such as Albert Ball, Mick Mannock and Billy Bishop, who were all Victoria Cross recipients. Hostilities ended on 11 November 1918 with the signing of the Armistice Treaty in the Compiègne Forest, but the war was not officially over until the various peace treaties were signed in 1919. By the war&#x27;s end, four major imperial powers – Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire—had been militarily and politically defeated, and the latter two ceased to exist as autonomous entities. Of the 60 million European soldiers who were mobilized from 1914 to 1918, 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured.

During the war, Britain called on its dominions and colonies, which provided invaluable military, financial and material support. The armies of the Dominions provided over 2.5 million men as well as many thousands of volunteers from the Crown colonies. The largest number of men came from the Indian sub continent, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The Indian Contingent consisted of over 130,000 men in various capabilities and served primarily in France and Belgium. Over 9000 of them died and 11 of them were awarded the VC. The Australian Imperial Force (AIF) began forming on 15 August 1914 and remained a volunteer force for the entire war. Throughout the four years of conflict, 331,814 volunteers from Australia were sent overseas with 63 VCs awarded; nine of these were given for the Gallipoli Campaign. Eleven members of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) were awarded the Victoria Cross. The Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) saw over 600,000 enlistments throughout its four-year history with 71 VCs awarded. At the outbreak of the hostilities, Newfoundland was a separate dominion and 2 soldiers from Newfoundland were awarded the Victoria Cross.

The 628 awards of the Victoria Cross given for action during the First World War account for almost half the 1356 Victoria Crosses awarded throughout its history; in comparison the Second World War saw 181 medals awarded. Noel Godfrey Chavasse was awarded the Victoria Cross and Bar, for two separate actions in the First World War on the battlefields of Mametz and Passchendaele. He died from wounds received in the second action. Arthur Martin-Leake received a Bar to his Victoria Cross for action in the First World War; he had been awarded his first Victoria Cross for action in the Second Boer War.

Of the 627 recipients 159 (25.36%) were awarded posthumously.
