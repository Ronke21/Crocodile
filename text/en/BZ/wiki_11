<text>Jean-Pierre [François] Blanchard (; 4 July 1753 – 7 March 1809) was a French inventor, best known as a pioneer of gas balloon flight, who distinguished himself in the conquest of the air in a balloon. Notable for his successful hydrogen balloon flight in Paris on 2 March 1784, Blanchard later moved to London and undertook flights with varying propulsion mechanisms. His historic achievement came on 7 January 1785, crossing the English Channel from Dover Castle to Guînes in about 2½ hours, receiving acclaim from Louis XVI and earning a substantial pension.

Touring Europe, Blanchard demonstrated his balloons and showcased the modern parachute, which he later used for a successful escape in 1793 when his hydrogen balloon ruptured. In 1792
, he conducted the first balloon flight in the Americas, witnessed by President George Washington. Married to Sophie Blanchard in 1804, Blanchard suffered a fatal heart attack in his balloon in 1808, with his widow continuing balloon demonstrations until her accidental death.

==Biography==
===1784 – Flights in Paris===
Blanchard made his first successful balloon flight in Paris on 2 March 1784, in a hydrogen gas balloon launched from the Champ de Mars. The first successful manned balloon flight took place on 21 November 1783, when Pilâtre de Rozier and the Marquis d&#x27;Arlandes took off at the Palace of Versailles in a free-flying hot air balloon constructed by the Montgolfier brothers. The first manned hydrogen balloon flight took place on 1 December 1783, when Jacques Charles and Nicolas-Louis Robert launched the first gas balloon from the Jardin des Tuileries in Paris. Blanchard&#x27;s flight nearly ended in disaster, when one spectator (Dupont de Chambon, a contemporary of Napoleon at the École militaire de Brienne) slashed at the balloon&#x27;s mooring ropes and oars with his sword after being refused a place on board. Blanchard intended to &quot;row&quot; northeast to La Villette but the balloon was pushed by the wind across the Seine to Billancourt and back again, landing in the rue de Sèvres. Blanchard adopted the Latin tag as his motto.

The early balloon flights triggered a phase of the public &quot;balloonomania&quot;, with all manner of objects decorated with images of balloons or styled &quot;au ballon&quot;, from ceramics to fans and hats. Clothing &quot;au ballon&quot; was produced with exaggerated puffed sleeves, rounded skirts, or with printed images of balloons. Hair was coiffed &quot;à la montgolfier&quot;, &quot;au globe volant&quot;, &quot;au demi-ballon&quot;, or &quot;à la Blanchard&quot;.

===1784 – Flights in London===
Blanchard moved to London in August 1784, where he took part in a flight on 16 October 1784 with John Sheldon, just a few weeks after the first flight in Britain (and first outside France), when Italian Vincenzo Lunardi flew from Moorfields to Ware on 15 September 1784. Blanchard&#x27;s propulsion mechanisms – flapping wings and a windmill – again proved ineffective, but the balloon flew some 115  km from Lewis Lochée’s military academy in Little Chelsea, landing in Sunbury and then taking off again to end in Romsey. Blanchard took a second flight on 30 November 1784, taking off with an American, Dr John Jeffries, from the behind Green Street Mayfair, London to Ingress in Kent.

===1785 – First flight over the English Channel===
A third flight, again with Jeffries, was the first flight over the English Channel, taking about 2½ hours to travel from England to France on 7 January 1785, flying from Dover Castle to Guînes. Blanchard was awarded a substantial pension by Louis XVI. The King ordered the balloon and boat be hung up in the church of Église Notre-Dame de Calais. (A subsequent Channel crossing attempt in the opposite direction by Pilâtre de Rozier on 15 June 1785 ended unsuccessfully in a fatal crash.)

===Flights in Europe===
Blanchard toured Europe, demonstrating his balloons. He holds the record of first balloon flights in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Poland. Among the events that included demonstrations of his abilities as a balloonist was the coronation of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II as King of Bohemia in Prague in September 1791.

Following the invention of the modern parachute in 1783 by Sébastien Lenormand in France, in 1785 Jean-Pierre Blanchard demonstrated it as a means of jumping safely from a balloon. While Blanchard&#x27;s first parachute demonstrations were conducted with a dog as the passenger, he later had the opportunity to try it himself when in 1793 his hydrogen balloon ruptured and he used a parachute to escape. Subsequent development of the parachute focused on making it more compact. While the early parachutes were made of linen stretched over a wooden frame, in the late 1790s, Blanchard began making parachutes from folded silk, taking advantage of silk&#x27;s strength and light weight.

===1793 – Flights in America===
On 9 January 1793, Blanchard conducted the first balloon flight in the Americas. He launched his balloon from the prison yard of Walnut Street Jail in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and landed in Deptford, Gloucester County, New Jersey. One of the flight&#x27;s witnesses that day was President George Washington, and the future presidents John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe were also present. Blanchard left the United States in 1797.

==Personal life and death==
He married Marie Madeleine-Sophie Armant (better known as Sophie Blanchard) in 1804. On 20 February 1808 Blanchard had a heart attack while in his balloon at The Hague. He fell from the balloon and died roughly a year later on 7 March 1809 due to severe injuries. His widow continued to support herself with ballooning demonstrations until doing so also killed her.

<text>40 Harmonia is a large main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by German-French astronomer Hermann Goldschmidt on March 31, 1856, and named after Harmonia, the Greek goddess of harmony. The name was chosen to mark the end of the Crimean War.

The asteroid is orbiting the Sun with a period of and a relatively low eccentricity of 0.046. It has a cross-sectional size of 107.6 km. The spectrum of 40 Harmonia matches an S-type (silicate) in the Tholen classification system, and is similar to primitive achondrite meteorites. Photometric observations at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico during 2008–09 were used to generate a light curve that showed four unequal minima and maxima per cycle. The curve shows a period of 8.909 ± 0.001 hours with a brightness variation of 0.28 ± 0.02 in magnitude. This result is compatible with previous studies.

Speckle interferometric observations carried out with the Nicholas U. Mayall Telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory during 1982–84 failed to discover a satellite companion. In 1988 a search for satellites or dust orbiting this asteroid was performed using the UH88 telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories, but the effort came up empty.

<text>Joseph Baruch (J.B.) Salsberg (November 5, 1902 – February 8, 1998) was a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Labor-Progressive member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1943 to 1955 who represented the riding of St. Andrew in downtown Toronto. He was a longtime Communist and activist in the Jewish community.

==Early life==
Salsberg was born in 1902 to Abraham and Sarah Gitel Salsberg in the small town of Lagow (Lagov, in Yiddish pronunciation), in the Opatow district of Radom in what is now Poland. He emigrated to Canada with his parents in 1913 at age 11, settling in Toronto. His father worked as a peddler to support his wife and seven children. Joseph dropped out of Landsdowne Public School after two years, at the age of 13, in order to work in sweatshops full-time for $3 a week to help support the family but continued to study at night to be a rabbi in the Orthodox tradition. His industrial experience led him to labour activism, particularly in the garment workers union where he fought for improved wages and conditions. At age 16, he informed his traditionalist parents that he was abandoning Talmudic studies in favour of a secular humanist philosophy. He joined a Labour Zionist workers&#x27; group, the Young Poale Zion, and quickly rose to leadership going to New York City to serve as general secretary of the North American group from 1922 to 1924, editing its newspaper and going on speaking tours across the continent. He returned to Toronto and became an organizer for the Hat, Cap, and Millinery Workers Union of North America and, in 1927, married Dora Wilensky who later became a social worker with Jewish Family and Child Services.

==Communist activity==
By 1926, Salsberg&#x27;s trade unionism and socialism led him to become an active member of the Communist Party of Canada. He became well known in the Jewish community, many of whose members were workers in the garment district which was concentrated around Spadina Avenue. He became vice-president of the International Hatters&#x27; Union and a member of the Communist Party&#x27;s Central Committee. He was active in a number of unionization drives across Canada.

In 1932, Salsberg became the Southern Ontario district organizer for the Workers Unity League, a communist-led group which sought to replace Canada&#x27;s traditional craft unions with industrial unions. He attained further prominence in this role; Canadian historian Irving Abella later wrote that Salsberg was known as the &quot;Commissar&quot; of Southern Ontario&#x27;s trade union movement.

==Politics==
In 1938, he was elected an alderman on Toronto&#x27;s city council representing Ward 4 (which included the largely Jewish working class neighbourhoods around Spadina Avenue and Kensington Market). He was known throughout the city for his work on social issues. Heckled by adversaries as a puppet of Joseph Stalin, Salsberg joked that &quot;You&#x27;re right. I got a telegram from Joe Stalin this morning ordering me to ask for a park for Ward 4.&quot;

In the 1943 provincial election he ran as the Labor-Progressive Party candidate in the downtown Toronto riding of St. Andrew. He defeated Liberal incumbent J.J. Glass by 5,150 votes. The Labor-Progressive Party (LPP) as the Communist Party of Ontario was known had been founded as the legal face of the Communist Party which had been banned in 1941. Salsberg was elected alongside fellow LPPer A.A. MacLeod who represented the neighbouring riding of Bellwoods. He was re-elected in 1945, 1948, and 1951.

Salsberg was a popular MPP inside and outside the house and was respected by members of all parties. He was instrumental in the introduction of the &quot;Racial Discrimination Act, 1944&quot; which he proposed as a result of posted notices banning Jews and Blacks from various swimming pools in Toronto and as a result of other cases of anti-Semitism and racism in the province. The law was one of the foundations that led to the eventual passage of the &quot;Ontario Human Rights Code&quot;.
Most of his speeches were non-ideological, and he almost never made reference to the Soviet Union during his time in the legislature. Leslie Frost, the province&#x27;s Progressive Conservative Premier from 1949 to 1961, respected Salsberg&#x27;s abilities as a parliamentarian; it has even been reported that Frost was willing to offer Salsberg a cabinet position if he defected to the Progressive Conservative Party. Frost named Salsberg Township near what is now Thunder Bay in his honour.

Salsberg was the sole communist in the Legislature after the 1951 election in which MacLeod lost his seat. Salsberg eulogized Stalin on the house floor when the Soviet leader died in 1953 and this speech was used against him in the 1955 election campaign when he was defeated by Progressive Conservative Allan Grossman.

==Break with Communism==
Salsberg had for several years been concerned with official antisemitism in the Soviet Union, and had confronted Canadian Communist leader Tim Buck on the subject as early as 1939. He remained silent on the matter for several years (in part to maintain party unity during World War II), but became increasingly troubled by ongoing anti-Semitism in the 1950s. He travelled to the USSR in 1955 and 1956, and witnessed first-hand the extent of the anti-Semitic campaign that had persecuted Jews in that country.

Salsberg attempted to personally confront Nikita Khrushchev on the matter during his second visit, but his concerns were dismissed. Also disillusioned by Soviet invasion of Hungary and Khrushchev&#x27;s Secret Speech, he resigned from the Communist Party upon his return to Canada (leading an exodus which included half the national executive). Salsberg reported back to the Labor-Progressive Party and an allied organization, the United Jewish Peoples&#x27; Order on his findings. He was suspended for a time from the leadership of the LPP as a result and, after an internal debate, left the LPP along with most of its Jewish cadre. The UJPO supported Salsberg&#x27;s findings and severed its ties with the party. Nevertheless, Salsberg and a number of his supporters continued to argue for UJPO to distance itself further from the Soviet Union until he and approximately 200 UJPO members, approximately one-third of the organization, resigned in 1959 and founded the New Fraternal Jewish Association in 1960 in which Salsberg was a leading member until his death.

==Later life==
The late 1950s were a period of tragedy for Salsberg: in addition to losing his belief in communism (and his seat in the legislature), his wife Dora died in 1959. He withdrew from political activity for a time, and sold insurance to make a living. There are reports that he was eventually able to make a small fortune through this practice.

Salsberg later rejoined the Canadian Jewish Congress (which had previously expelled its Communist members). In 1959 he and about one-third of the membership of UJPO left, feeling that the organization was not critical enough of the Soviet Union, and started a new organization called the &quot;New Fraternal Jewish Association&quot;. The NFJA was made up primarily of former Jewish Communists still interested in promoting social justice. Salsberg was also involved in a variety of cultural activities, including Yiddish-language programs.

Salsberg also returned to Labour Zionism and, in his old age, was a longtime columnist for the &quot;Canadian Jewish News&quot; until shortly before his death.

<text>Charles Butler KC (14 August 1750 – 2 June 1832) was an English Roman Catholic lawyer and miscellaneous writer.

==Biography==
Charles Butler was born in London, the son of James Butler, a nephew of Alban Butler. He was educated at Douai. In 1769 he became apprenticed to the conveyancer John Maire, and subsequently (on Maire&#x27;s death in 1773) to Matthew Duane. In 1775 he set up his own conveyancing practice and entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. He edited, with Francis Hargrave, &quot;Coke upon Lyttleton&quot;, published in 1775. Peter Bellinger Brodie was one of his students.

A 1777 pamphlet supporting naval impressments won him the patronage of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, but Butler withdrew from general political activity to press for Catholic relief. Secretary of the Catholic Committee from 1782, he was appointed by them to draft a new relief bill in 1788: despite controversy within the English Catholic community over the extent to which the Catholic condition should be assimilated to that of Protestant dissenters, a bill passed on 24 June 1791. In 1792 Butler helped found the Cisalpine Club &quot;to resist any ecclesiastical interference which may militate against the freedom of English Catholics&quot;. Relations between cisalpine Catholics, minimising the authority of the Pope over English Catholics, and vicars apostolic (especially Butler&#x27;s long-time opponent John Milner) were strained; in 1807 a Catholic Board was formed after efforts to repair relations, but Milner would censure Butler in 1822 as &#x27;a rebel to ecclesiastical authority and a public sinner&#x27;.

He had considerable practice as a conveyancer, and after the passing of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791 was the first Catholic to be called to the bar since 1688. His only appearance at the bar was in Cholmondeley v. Clinton at the House of Lords, which set a precedent for judgements on land removal. In 1832 he took silk, and was made a bencher of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

==Marriage==
Butler married Mary Eyston in 1776; they had one son (who died young) and two daughters.

==Works==
His literary activity was enormous, and the number of his published works comprises about fifty volumes. The most important of them are:
*&quot;Reminiscences&quot; (1821–1827)
*&quot;Horae Biblicae&quot; (1797), which passed through several editions
*&quot;Horae Juridicae Subsecivae&quot; (1804)
*&quot;Book of the Roman Catholic Church&quot; (1825), which was directed against Southey and excited some controversy
*lives of Erasmus, Grotius, Bossuet, Fénelon
He also edited and completed the &quot;Lives of the Saints&quot; of his uncle, Alban Butler, Fearne&#x27;s &quot;Essay on Contingent Remainders&quot; and Hargrave&#x27;s edition of Coke upon Littleton&#x27;s &quot;Laws of England&quot; (1775).

A complete list of Butler&#x27;s works is contained in Joseph Gillow&#x27;s &quot;Bibliographical Dictionary of English Catholics&quot;, vol. i. pp. 357–364.

<doc id="728273" wikidata="Q738543" url="?curid=728273" title="Uinta Mountains">
<text>The Uinta Mountains ( ) are an east-west trending mountain range in northeastern Utah extending a short distance into northwest Colorado and slightly into southwestern Wyoming in the United States. As a subrange of the Rocky Mountains, they are unusual for being the highest range in the contiguous United States running east to west, and lie approximately east of Salt Lake City. The range has peaks ranging from , with the highest point being Kings Peak, also the highest point in Utah. The Mirror Lake Highway crosses the western half of the Uintas on its way to Wyoming. Utah State Route 44 crosses the east end of the Uintas between Vernal and Manila.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Uinta&quot; derives from the Ute word &quot;Yoov-we-teuh&quot;, meaning &quot;pine forest&quot; or &quot;pine tree&quot;.

==Geology==
The Uinta Mountains are Laramide uplifted metasedimentary rocks deposited in an intracratonic basin in southwest Laurentia during the time of the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia. The marine and fluvial metasedimentary rocks in the core of the Uinta Mountains are of Neoproterozoic age (between about 700 million and 760 million years old) and consist primarily of quartzite, slate, and shale. These rocks comprise the Uinta Mountain Group, and reach thicknesses of . Most of the high peaks are outcrops of the Uinta Mountain Group. Many of the peaks are ringed with bands of cliffs, rising to form broad or flat tops. The mountains are bounded to the north and south by reverse faults that meet below the range, on the north by the North Flank fault and on the south by the Uinta Basin boundary fault.

The Uinta Mountain Group, from oldest to youngest, includes Uinta Mountain undivided quartz arenite, overlain by the Moosehorn Lake, Mount Watson, Hades Peak, and Red Shale formations. The flanks of the east-west trending Uinta Mountains contain a sequence of Paleozoic and Mesozoic strata ranging from the Cambrian Lodore Formation to the Cretaceous Mancos Shale, all of which have been tilted during the uplift of the mountain range.

The uplift of the range dates to the Laramide orogeny, about 70 to 50 million years ago, when compressive forces produced high-angle reverse faults on both the north and south sides of the present mountain range. The east-west orientation of the Uintas is anomalous compared to most of the ranges of the Rocky Mountains; it may relate to changing stress patterns and rotation of the Colorado Plateau. The Green River used to flow into the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico, but changed to the Colorado River by going through the Uintas in ways not fully understood.

The high Uintas were extensively glaciated during the last ice age, and most of the large stream valleys on both the north and south sides of the range held long valley glaciers. However, despite reaching to over in elevation, the climate today is sufficiently dry that no glaciers survived even before the rapid current glacial retreat began in the middle nineteenth century. The Uintas are the most poleward mountain range in the world to reach over without modern glaciers, and are in fact the highest mountain range in the contiguous United States with no modern glaciers. Permafrost occurs at elevations above and at times forms large rock glaciers.

Between the summits and ridgelines are wide, level basins with around 500 small lakes. One of the most popular lakes is Mirror Lake because of its good fishing, scenic views, and easy road access.
==Hydrology==

The south and east sides of the range are largely within the Colorado River watershed, including the Blacks Fork and the Duchesne River, which are tributaries of the Green River. The Green is the major tributary of the Colorado River and flows in a tight arc around the eastern side of the range. (Indeed, John Wesley Powell said the Green was the &quot;master stream&quot; where it and the Colorado River came together.)

The Bear and Weber rivers, the two largest tributaries of Great Salt Lake, are born on the west slope of the range. The Provo River, the largest tributary to Utah Lake, begins on the southern side of the range and flows west to Utah Lake, which itself drains via the Jordan River into Great Salt Lake.

Large portions of the mountain range receive over of precipitation annually. The high Uintas are snowcapped most of the year except for late July through early September. The Uinta Mountains have more than of streams and 1,000 lakes and ponds.
==Ecology==

The Uinta Mountains are part of the Wasatch and Uinta montane forests ecoregion. Nearly the entire range lies within Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest (on the north and west) and Ashley National Forest (on the south and east). The range&#x27;s highest peaks are protected as part of the High Uintas Wilderness. The forests contain many species of trees, including lodgepole pine, subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, Douglas-fir, and quaking aspen. There are also many species of grasses, shrubs, and forbs growing in the Uinta Mountains.

Fauna is typical of the central Rocky Mountains. Large grazing and browsing animals include the Rocky Mountain elk, mule deer, moose, pronghorn antelope, mountain goats, and Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep. Mammalian predators include the American black bear, mountain lion, coyotes, red fox, badger, wolverine, marten, and the long-tailed weasel. A gray wolf pack has been observed at the eastern end of the range, in Moffat County, Colorado. Raptors include bald and golden eagles, turkey vultures, various hawks and harriers, and owls including the great horned owl, great grey owl, and barn owls. Other notable large birds include the sage grouse and white-tailed ptarmigan.

==Points of interest==
The Uintas are home to Camp Steiner, the highest Boy Scout camp in the U.S., at . The camp is near mile marker 33 of the Mirror Lake Highway.

The Uinta Highline Trail traverses the entire range and is a popular backpacking trail.

Dinosaur National Monument is on the Uintas&#x27; southeast flank, on the border between Colorado and Utah.

<text>David Christy Butler (December 15, 1829 – May 25, 1891) was a U.S. political figure. He was the first governor of Nebraska, serving from 1867 until 1871. He was the first governor of Nebraska after statehood and the only Nebraska governor to be impeached.

==Biography==
Butler was born near Linton, Indiana, the eldest son of 10 children. His education was limited to the common schools and he worked at farming and cattle trading. He married twice. His first wife was Mary Pauline Smith Butler and his second was Lydia Story Butler. He and Lydia were married on January 25, 1860, and he had eight children.

==Career==
Butler was nominated for a state senate seat in Indiana in 1856, but withdrew before the election. He moved three years later to Pawnee City, Nebraska, and engaged in trading cattle until his election to the Nebraska Territorial Legislature in 1861. He was elected to the Nebraska State Senate in 1863 and won the 1866 election to become Nebraska&#x27;s first governor. During his second term (1869–1870), Butler moved the state&#x27;s capital from Omaha to present-day Lincoln.

In the spring of 1871, soon after taking office for his third term, eleven articles of impeachment were brought against him. The first charged him with misuse of some $16,000 from the state school fund. Butler had allegedly made personal use of this money to purchase lots in the new city of Lincoln. He was suspended from office by the Supreme Court and subsequently tried by the State Senate. In his impeachment trial, he was convicted on the first charge, although the remaining ten were dropped. The Supreme Court then removed him from office on June 2, 1871.

In 1877, the Legislature reviewed its action and adopted a resolution expunging the impeachment proceedings from the record. After ten years of retirement from public life, Butler was elected to the Nebraska State Senate on the Independent Ticket in 1882. Running on the Union Labor Ticket in 1888, he again sought the Governorship but was defeated.

==Death and legacy==
Following this defeat Butler retired to his home in Pawnee City, where he died on May 25, 1891, and is interred at Pawnee City Cemetery. Butler County in eastern Nebraska may have been named for him, but this is disputed, since records seem to indicate that the county was being referred to as &quot;Butler County&quot; before David Butler had served as Governor of Nebraska. Butler also may be the namesake of David City, Nebraska, but this is also disputed.

<text>Sir Milo Boughton Butler (11 August 190622 January 1979) was a Bahamian politician who served as the second governor-general of the Bahamas from 1973 to 1979. He died in office, aged 72.

==Early life and family==
Butler was born in Nassau, The Bahamas on 11 August 1905 to George Raleigh Butler and his wife Frances. He attended the George Washington School in Florida, the public school at Rum Cay, and the Boys&#x27; Central School in Nassau. At age 17, Butler began his own grocery business. On 14 October 1928, Butler married Caroline Loretta Watson. They had seven sons and three daughters.

==Career and death==
Butler entered electoral politics in 1936 as a member of the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP), when he unsuccessfully ran against Sir Harry Oakes in the Western District of New Providence. Although Butler was seen as a charismatic candidate who had the support of the working class voters, Oakes&#x27; team allegedly employed &quot;questionable&quot; means to win the election. The following year, Butler was elected to parliament following a by-election in the same constituency, relinquishing the office in 1947. 

In 1956, after the government imposed a 12-minute limit on parliamentary speeches, Butler threw the Speaker&#x27;s hourglass out of the window at the House of Assembly. He returned as a member of parliament for the Western District the same year, serving for a decade. From 1967 to 1973, he represented Bain Town. 

After the PLP emerged victorious in the 1967 general election and formed a majority government, Butler became Minister of Health and Welfare followed by Minister of Labour, Agriculture and Fisheries a year later. In 1970, he was appointed as Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, and in 1972 he became Minister without Portfolio. On 1 August 1973, Butler was appointed as the second Governor-General of the Bahamas by Queen Elizabeth II, on the recommendation of Lynden Pindling, Prime Minister of The Bahamas and leader of the PLP. He served as Governor General until his death on 22 January 1979 in Nassau. 

Butler is buried at the cemetery next to the nineteenth-century St. Matthew&#x27;s Anglican Church on Church and Shirley Streets.

On 14 November 1991, his son Milo Butler Jr. became Speaker of Parliament.

==Recognition==
In June 1972, Butler was honoured as a National Hero of the Bahamas following a Special Resolution by the Honourable House of Assembly. In 1973, he was appointed as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) by Queen Elizabeth II. In February 1975, following the Queen&#x27;s visit to Nassau, he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO). A bronze statue of Butler designed by Bahamian sculptor Randolph Johnson was unveiled on 22 January 1986 at Rawson Square in downtown Nassau. In 2018, he was posthumously awarded the Bahamian Order of National Hero (NH).

<text>William Orlando Butler (April 19, 1791 – August 6, 1880) was a U.S. political figure and U.S. Army major general from Kentucky. He served as a Democratic representative from Kentucky from 1839 to 1843, and was the Democratic vice-presidential nominee under Lewis Cass in 1848.

Born in Jessamine County, Kentucky, Butler studied law after graduating from Transylvania University. He served in the War of 1812, taking part in the Battle of the Thames and the Battle of New Orleans. After the war, he practiced law in Carrollton, Kentucky, and briefly served in the Kentucky House of Representatives. He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1839 to 1843 before running for Governor of Kentucky in 1844. He lost the 1844 gubernatorial election to Whig nominee William Owsley.

During the Mexican–American War, Butler served as a major general of volunteers. He was General Zachary Taylor&#x27;s second-in-command during the Battle of Monterrey and later succeeded Winfield Scott as the commander of American forces occupying Mexico City. The 1848 Democratic National Convention nominated a ticket of Cass and Butler, but the Whig ticket of Taylor and Millard Fillmore won the 1848 presidential election. He attended the Peace Conference of 1861, which sought to defuse the secession crisis that arose following the 1860 presidential election. During the Civil War, Butler was a War Democrat who favored the Union.

==Early life==
Butler, the son of Mildred Hawkins and Gen. Percival Butler, was born in Jessamine County, Kentucky (then Fayette County), and graduated from Transylvania University in 1812. He began the study of law with Robert Wickliffe, but his education was interrupted by the War of 1812.

==War of 1812==

===Battle of the River Raisin===
When the War of 1812 began, Butler volunteered as a private to fight the British and the Indians. He took part in the Battle of the River Raisin. During the battle, Butler and fellow soldiers defended themselves behind a fencerow. The Indians poured such an intense fire on the fencerow that when it was over Butler found that his clothes were riddled with bullets. While the British were being decimated by American riflemen behind the cover of fences from the left position of the American lines, the British placed their soldiers in the cover of a barn in front of the American positions 150 yards away. Butler volunteered to conduct a hit-and-run operation to destroy the barn to deprive the British of cover in the barn. Butler carried a firebrand in the face of steady enemy gunfire, Butler raced to the barn and set it ablaze. Butler withdrew back to the American lines to gather straw. He then raced to the barn to place the straw on the fire. With the barn destroyed, Butler safely returned to the American lines. Later, the whole American force were defeated and captured.

===Battle of the Thames===
After the British captured Butler and sent him to Fort Niagara where he remained until the British freed him on parole. He returned to Kentucky only to join the American forces that met the British and Indians at the Battle of the Thames in 1813.

===Battle of New Orleans===
Butler and his men were sent to New Orleans to assist Andrew Jackson in the city&#x27;s defense. He distinguished himself during the Battle of New Orleans. Among the men under his command was future Florida governor Richard Keith Call, who would remain lifelong friends with Butler.

==Political career==
After the end of the War of 1812, Butler returned to Kentucky, resumed his legal studies, and attained admission to the bar. From 1817 to 1844, he practiced law in Carrollton. Butler served in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1817 and 1818. From 1839 to 1843, he served as a congressman. In 1844, he received a unanimous nomination of the Democratic Party for governor. Described as the most formidable candidate that the Democrats had ever nominated for governor, Butler&#x27;s race against Whig candidate William Owsley was close. Owsley won with 59,680 votes to Butler&#x27;s 55,056.

==Mexican–American War==

When the Mexican War broke out, Butler again joined the army. On June 29, 1846, he was appointed major general of volunteers and commanded the 1st Volunteer Division in the Army of Occupation. He served as second-in-command to Zachary Taylor during the Battle of Monterrey, in which he was wounded. On February 18, 1848, he superseded General Winfield Scott as the commanding general of the American army in Mexico City. He left the service on August 18, 1848, after he had been selected as the Democratic vice presidential nominee.

==Election of 1848==
In 1848, Butler was the Democratic candidate for Vice President of the United States. At the 1848 Democratic National Convention, delegate Francis P. Blair was a leader of the movement to put Butler on the ticket with Lewis Cass, and Butler won the nomination on the first ballot over John A. Quitman and William R. King. In the general election, the ticket of Cass and Butler was defeated by Whig candidates Zachary Taylor and Millard Fillmore. Butler was the first non-incumbent Democratic vice presidential candidate to lose election.

==Later years==

Butler turned down the governorship of the Nebraska Territory when it was offered to him by President Franklin Pierce in 1854.

Politically, Butler was a moderate. Although a slaveholder, he was opposed to the extension of slavery and favored gradual legal emancipation. He stood firmly for the preservation of the Union and was a Union Democrat during the Civil War.

He was present at the peace conference of 1861, a gathering of political leaders that met in Washington, D.C., in an attempt to avert the impending American Civil War.

Butler also authored a volume of poetry entitled &quot;The Boatman&#x27;s Horn, and Other Poems&quot;.

==Death and burial==
Butler died in Carrollton, Kentucky, on August 6, 1880, at age 89. He was interred in the Butler family cemetery in Carrollton.

<doc id="728300" wikidata="Q686525" url="?curid=728300" title="Thomas &amp; Mack Center">
<text>The Thomas &amp; Mack Center is a multi-purpose arena located on the campus of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in Paradise, Nevada. It is home of the UNLV Runnin&#x27; Rebels basketball team of the Mountain West Conference.

==History==
The facility first opened in the summer of 1983. The gala grand opening was held on December 16, 1983, featuring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Diana Ross. The facility hosts numerous events, such as concerts, music festivals, conventions and boxing cards. For ring events, the capacity is 19,522; for basketball, the capacity is 18,000. The facility is named after two prominent Nevada bankers, E. Parry Thomas and Jerome D. Mack, who donated the original funds for the feasibility and land studies.

The arena underwent a major interior and exterior renovation in 1999. 2008 saw the installation of all new visual equipment, which included a 4-sided new center-hung LED widescreen scoreboard, which includes four LED advertising/scoring boards above it and a LED advertising ring below it to replace the one installed in 1995, a partial LED ring beam display covering 80% of the balcony&#x27;s rim, a new 50&#x27; LED scorer&#x27;s table display, a new shot clock system for the backboards, six wall-mounted locker room game clocks, two new custom scoreboards with fixed digital scoring and complete player stats and a new outdoor marquee LED video billboard.

In 2001, a smaller arena, Cox Pavilion, was added to the complex; the two arenas are directly connected. Cox Pavilion is used for smaller events; its main tenants are the UNLV women&#x27;s basketball and volleyball programs.

The center&#x27;s primary tenant is the UNLV men&#x27;s basketball team since 1983. The arena was nicknamed &quot;the Shark Tank&quot; after UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian, whose nickname was Tark the Shark. He won a national championship in 1990 and took the team to three additional Final Fours (four Final Fours overall). The arena ranked 4th highest in college basketball attendance during the 2012-2013 season.

The facility also hosted the Las Vegas Thunder of the now defunct International Hockey League. It was also hosted the Las Vegas Flash of the RHI in the 1993–94 season pre-season games annually in October through 2013. In 2014 and 2015 their games were played at MGM Grand, and from 2016 onward at T-Mobile Arena.

===Arena Football===
It was the former home of the Arena Football League&#x27;s Las Vegas Sting, Las Vegas Gladiators, and Las Vegas Outlaws. In 2005 and 2006, the arena hosted the Arena Football League&#x27;s ArenaBowl.

ArenaBowl XIX and ArenaBowl XX were the first two ArenaBowls to be held at a neutral site arena. In the past, the games had been played at the site of the highest seed in the playoffs.

In ArenaBowl XIX in 2005, the Colorado Crush, owned by John Elway defeated the Georgia Force on a field goal on the final play of the game. The game was ranked as one of the AFL&#x27;s 20 best games ever in league history. The following year, 2006, the Chicago Rush, owned by Mike Ditka defeated the Orlando Predators 69–61 for the Rush&#x27;s first championship in franchise history.

===Basketball===
====NBA====
The venue hosted the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, marking the first time that this game was held in a city without a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise. For the first time in NBA history, an on-campus college sports arena served as venue of an NBA All-Star Game. However, the arena had previously hosted home games for two NBA teams, the Utah Jazz and Los Angeles Lakers.

The Utah Jazz used the arena in the mid-1980s, and it was where Kareem Abdul-Jabbar broke Wilt Chamberlain&#x27;s record for points in a career in 1984. After the Rodney King riots, the Lakers used the arena in 1992 for Game 4 of their first round playoff series against the Portland Trail Blazers, which Portland won 102–76. The NBA moved the game as a result of the Los Angeles riots.
====College====
The 1994–95 Big West Conference, 1997–99 Western Athletic Conference and 2000–03 Mountain West Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournaments were held there as well. The Mountain West Conference men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball tournaments have both been played annually at the arena since 2007.

====International====
The FIBA Americas Championship 2007 was held at Thomas &amp; Mack Center from August 22 to September 2.

===Rodeo===
In late 2007, CBS filmed part of the &quot;&quot; episode, &quot;Bull&quot;, at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center, which was hosting the PBR World Finals.
Since 1985, the Thomas &amp; Mack Center has hosted the National Finals Rodeo annually each December. It also hosted the PBR World Finals from 1999 to 2015 before the event moved to the new T-Mobile Arena from the 2016 season onward; the PBR returned in 2018 to host their annual &quot;Last Cowboy Standing&quot; event. As a surprise during the 2018 PBR World Finals in November, CEO Sean Gleason announced that the PBR Last Cowboy Standing event would be hosted at Cheyenne Frontier Days in Cheyenne, Wyoming starting in 2019. This move to the world&#x27;s largest outdoor rodeo expanded on a growing partnership.

<text>Maryanne Winona Kusaka (born September 11, 1935) is an American politician, educator and former Mayor of the County of Kaua&#x27;i. She was mayor of Kauai from 1994 to 2002. A career Republican, Kusaka sought a seat in the Hawai&#x27;i State Senate in 2004 but lost to the Democratic Party&#x27;s Gary Hooser by 16,274 votes to 8,270.

Kusaka was born in Kamuela on the Big Island of Hawai&#x27;i. Her parents, George Joseph Pinho and Mary Garcia Pinho moved the family to Hana on the island of Maui, where Kusaka was raised. She has two brothers, Kirtley Pinho and Glenn Pinho, and an adopted sister, Kehaulani Quartero.

Kusaka graduated from Mid Pacific Institute in Honolulu and then attended the University of Northern Colorado to become an elementary school teacher. In 1964, Kusaka moved from Maui to Kauai. For over 33 years, Kusaka taught at various elementary schools on the island of Kauai, including at Kapaa Elementary School where she had future Kauai mayor Bernard Carvalho in her classroom. She continued teaching up until her election to the mayor&#x27;s office in 1994.

After her unsuccessful run in 2004 for the Hawai&#x27;i State Senate, Kusaka retired from politics. She continued to serve the community as president of the board of directors of the Kauai Museum.

Kusaka&#x27;s husband is Charles Yoshio &quot;Bull&quot; Kusaka. She has one son, &quot;Hawaii’s Entertainer&quot; Junior Kekuewa Jr.

<text>The are a group of volcanic islands stretching south and east from the Izu Peninsula of Honshū, Japan. Administratively, they form two towns and six villages; all part of Tokyo Prefecture. The largest is Izu Ōshima, usually called simply Ōshima.

Although usually called the &quot;Seven Islands of Izu&quot; (伊豆七島 in Japanese), there are in fact more than a dozen islands and islets. Nine among them are currently inhabited.

==Geography==

The Izu islands stretch south-east from the Izu Peninsula on Honshu and cover an area of approximately . There are nine populated islands with a total population of 24,645 people () spread over . The largest of them is Izu Oshima (8,346 inhabitants, ), the smallest Toshima (292 inhabitants, .) Of the inhabited islands, seven are traditionally referred to as the &quot;Izu Seven&quot;: Oshima, Toshima, Niijima, Kozushima, Miyakejima, Hachijojima, and Mikurajima, though Shikinejima and Aogashima are sometimes included as well.

During the Edo period, Nii-jima, Miyake-jima, and Hachijō-jima served as places of exile for criminals.

The subtropical Ogasawara Islands, which are also administratively part of Tokyo, lie further to the south. They form a far-flung archipelago of over thirty (30) islands some due south of Tokyo.

===Islands===

==Administrative divisions==
The Izu Islands are divided into two towns (Oshima and Hachijojima) and six villages (the remaining inhabited islands.) Three subprefectures are formed above the municipalities as branch offices of the metropolitan government.

All the islands (more than a dozen in total) lie within the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. The four southernmost islands are not administered under any town or village in Hachijō Subprefecture, but are unincorporated areas. Torishima is now uninhabited but is an important bird refuge.

Deserted islands between Aogashima and Ogasawara Islands, namely Bayonaise Rocks (&quot;Beyonēzu Retsugan&quot;), Smith Island (&quot;Sumisu-tō&quot;), Torishima, and Lot&#x27;s Wife (&quot;Sōfu-iwa&quot;) do not belong to any municipality, because both Hachijō Town and Aogashima Village claim administrative rights. They are directly controlled by Hachijō Subprefecture instead.

** Toshima Village: Toshima
** Niijima Village: Niijima, Shikinejima, and Udoneshima
** Kōzushima Village: Kōzushima
*Miyake Subprefecture
** Miyake Village: Miyakejima and Ōnoharajima
** Mikurajima Village: Mikurajima, Inambajima

** Aogashima Village: Aogashima
**unincorporated: Bayonnaise Rocks (&quot;Beyonēzu Retsugan&quot;), Sumisu-tō, Torishima, and Sōfu-iwa

==Demographics==
Though the population on the Izu Islands has been dropping, the pace is less dramatic than on other isolated Japanese islands.
The divergent Hachijō language is spoken on the islands.

==Infrastructure==

The primary industries are fisheries, agriculture, and tourism. The most scenic spots on the islands are crowded with tourists during summers. Popular tourist activities include swimming, scuba diving, surfing, fishing, bird watching and trekking.

Transportation between the islands, by cargo-passengers boats, jetfoils, and aircraft, is supported by harbours on all inhabited islands and five airports (small islands can be reached by helicopter).

There are 5 airports, 15 harbors, and 19 fishing ports. Flights from Tokyo take 30 minutes, while boats take 7–10 hours and jetfoils make the route in about two hours. Transportation on the islands is considered important to the quality of life, which is why about of paved main roads have been constructed to serve various kinds of vehicles.

There was no electricity on the islands before 1953, but by 1962 98% of the area was receiving electricity.

==Geology==
The islands occupy the northern portion of the Izu–Bonin–Mariana Arc which extends to the Izu Peninsula and Mount Fuji on the Honshū mainland which are northern extensions of the Izu volcanic arc. The Izu arc ends there at a tectonic triple junction.

Volcanic activity is frequent in the area. 31 people were killed when the research vessel &quot;Kaiyō Maru no 5&quot; was destroyed during the 1953 eruption of Myōjin-shō. Volcanic activity, including the release of harmful gases, forced the evacuation of Miyake-jima in 2000. Residents were allowed to return permanently to the island in February 2005 but were required to carry gas masks in case of future volcanic emissions.

To handle the various types of natural disasters threatening the region, including tsunamis, storm, floods, and volcanism, Tokyo metropolitan government has developed prevention and safety measures, including hazard maps and evacuation guidance, radios, signs, and a transport system for emergency supplies.

==Ecology==
A chain of volcanic islands, the Izu Archipelago are oceanic islands that formed relatively recently (within a few million years) without any previous connection to mainland Japan. In contrast to isolated Pacific islands, such as Hawaii and the Galápagos, the Izu Islands are located near the mainland and have thus been frequently colonized by various species by overseas dispersal from the mainland or from adjacent islands. This make them interesting for the studies of ecological and evolutionary processes.

&quot;Campanula&quot; (Bellflower) colonized the entire archipelago in a single event. Similarly, the &quot;Euhadra&quot; snails, endemic to Japan, populated the islands in a single event and all individuals on inhabited islands possess an identical haplotype. The &quot;Apodemus&quot; mice, on the other hand, colonized the islands from the mainland in two independent events.

==History==
* 680 - Izu Province was established in the form of being separated from Suruga Province. At that time, the Izu islands belonged to Kamo-gun.
* 12th century and possibly earlier – used as Japanese convict settlements.
* 1643 - Explorer Maarten Gerritsz Vries called it the &quot;De Vries Archipelago&quot;
* November 14, 1871 (December 25, 1871) --- Due to the first prefectural integration, they came under the jurisdiction of the Ashigara Prefecture.
* 1876 (Meiji 9), April 18 - Due to the second prefectural integration, they came under the jurisdiction of Shizuoka Prefecture.
* 1878 (Meiji 11), January 11 - they came under the jurisdiction of Tokyo Prefecture

<text>Hechos (Facts) is the news program of TV Azteca in Mexico, aired on its Azteca Uno network. &quot;Hechos&quot; newscasts air in the morning, at midday and at 9pm on weekdays and weekdays on Saturdays.

All three weekday editions of &quot;Hechos&quot; beat Televisa&#x27;s competing newscasts in the ratings in September 2016.

==History==
Hechos came to air in February 1994, months after the privatization of Imevisión led to the launch of Azteca as a private broadcaster.

==Editions==
Hechos airs &quot;Primera Linea AM&quot;, &quot;Hechos AM&quot;, &quot;Hechos Aquí Entre Nos&quot;, &quot;Hechos Meridiano&quot; and &quot;Hechos con Javier Alatorre&quot;.

&quot;Hechos Sabado con Carolina Rocha&quot; airs on Saturdays.

&quot;Hechos Domingo con Jorge Zarza&quot; airs on Sundays.

==Local opt-outs==
TV Azteca produces various regional news bulletins which are produced in major cities and inserted into the schedules of Azteca Uno transmitters in their respective local areas. These cover up portions of other programs and/or the national late news. These are titled &quot;Hechos (region name)&quot;, with such programs including &quot;Hechos Veracruz&quot;, &quot;Hechos Sonora Sur&quot; (covering Ciudad Obregón) and &quot;Hechos Baja California Sur&quot;. These programs also air in morning, midday and late time slots.

==Foreign adaptations==
Hechos was also produced in Chile by La Red TV when it was part of TV Azteca.

In 2017, TV Azteca launched A Más+, 7.2 national channel, replacing AzNoticias, producing 2 news programs known as Ahora Más, in afternoon and evening hours

<text>William Walton Butterworth (September 7, 1903 – March 31, 1975) was an American diplomat. He was United States Ambassador to Canada. Butterworth is best known for his work on Asian-American foreign relations, particularly during the clash of the communists and nationalists in post-war China. He was also instrumental in laying the groundwork for the European Union via his work with the European Coal and Steel Community and European Economic Community.

==Education==
Butterworth was born in New Orleans, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, on September 7, 1903. In Mercer County, New Jersey, he attended The Lawrenceville School where he graduated in 1921. He later attended New Jersey&#x27;s Princeton University, graduating in 1925. He was also a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University in England.

==Foreign Service==

He entered the Foreign Service in 1928 and began a career that encompassed 40 years of service.

His career began with a one-year stint at the State Department building in Washington. From 1929 to 1931, he was the vice consul to the Embassy in Singapore. Following brief posts in Washington and Ottawa, he was assigned to the American Embassy in London, where he served as second secretary until 1941. During World War II, Butterworth was first secretary of the American Embassy in Madrid from 1942 to 1944. Concurrently, he was in charge of operations for the United States Commercial Co. for the Iberian Peninsula, a government entity that played war games by procuring strategic war materials, including tungsten. From 1944 to 1946 he was the U.S. Embassy counselor in Madrid. From 1946 to 1947, Mr. Butterworth served as the counselor of the U.S. Embassy in Nanking, China, where he held the rank of minister and was a political advisor to George Marshall. Following his assignment in China, Butterworth returned as director for Far Eastern Affairs. He was appointed by General Marshall to be the Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs in 1950. Butterworth later served as U.S. ambassador to Sweden, U.S. representative to the European Coal and Steel Community, U.S. representative to the European Economic Community and European Atomic Energy Community. He was named a Career Ambassador on March 20, 1962, one of forty-six diplomats to hold the title.

In what would be his last posting, Butterworth was appointed by President John F. Kennedy to be the 8th U.S. Ambassador to Canada on October 4, 1962; on September 10, 1968, he would leave this posting. 

== Pan American airplane crash ==
On February 22, 1943, Butterworth and the other passengers and crew on Pan American&#x27;s Yankee Clipper crashed into the Tagus River in Lisbon, Portugal. On September 13, 1968, Butterworth was presented with the Department&#x27;s Award for Heroism, he was cited:In recognition of your courage and cool-headed resourcefulness at the crash...Although injured, you broke free of the wreckage, swam to survivors in the water and assisted them in reaching floating debris which sustained life until a rescue boat arrived Butterworth was an expert swimmer and helped other survivors despite two cracked ribs, all while keeping his briefcase full of classified documents with him. The plane crashed when the left wing touched the water during descent. Tamara Drasin and Ben Robertson, along with 22 others, were killed in the crash.

==Retirement==
After retirement in 1968, William Walton Butterworth died on March 31, 1975, of cirrhosis of the liver. While his last residence was in Mercer County, New Jersey, he was buried at Metairie Cemetery, City of New Orleans, Orleans Parish, Louisiana.

<text>The Carmen Fantasy, Op. 25, by Pablo de Sarasate is a fantasy on themes from Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; for violin and piano or orchestra, composed in 1881. A version with piano accompaniment was published in 1882. It was dedicated to Joseph Hellmesberger.

The piece contains an adaptation of the Aragonaise, Habanera, an interlude, Seguidilla, and the Gypsy Dance. Sarasate chose specifically the music with a Spanish character. A performance takes approximately 12 minutes.

The &quot;Carmen Fantasy&quot; is one of Sarasate&#x27;s best-known works and is often performed in violin competitions. Because of its delicate techniques and passion inspired by the opera, it is considered to be one of the most challenging and technically demanding pieces for the violin.

== Movements ==
The work consists of five movements.
== Orchestration ==
The orchestral version is scored for piccolo and 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani, tambourine, harp and strings. There is also an adaptation of the &quot;Carmen Fantasy&quot; with piano accompaniment.

<text>Christopher William Parkening (born December 14, 1947) is an American classical guitarist. He holds the Chair of Classical Guitar at Pepperdine University under the title Distinguished Professor of Music.

==Biography==
Parkening was born in Los Angeles, California. His cousin Jack Marshall, a studio musician active in the 1960s, introduced Parkening to the recordings of Andrés Segovia when he was 11 and encouraged his classical guitar studies. By the age of 19 he had embarked on a professional career of regular touring and recording.

Segovia has stated that, &quot;Christopher Parkening is a great artist—-he is one of the most brilliant guitarists in the world.&quot; The Washington Post stated, Christopher Parkening is “the leading guitar virtuoso of our day, combining profound musical insight with complete technical mastery of his instrument.”

At age 30, Parkening withdrew from public performances and recording seeking a respite from the demands of a professional career and a chance to pursue his hobby of flyfishing. During this period Parkening rarely played guitar choosing instead to focus his attention on his Montana ranch and trout stream. While visiting his Southern California home in winter, a neighbor invited Parkening to the Grace Community Church. Profoundly affected by this experience Parkening returned to recording and performing with a renewed sense of purpose&quot; to glorify God with his music. He then released &quot;Simple Gifts&quot;, an album of traditional Christian hymns arranged for classical guitar. His autobiography &quot;Grace Like a River&quot; was published in 2006.
Parkening has recorded over 20 albums for Angel and EMI Classics. He has been nominated twice for a Grammy Award. Notable recordings include &quot;Parkening Plays Vivaldi&quot; featuring a selection of Baroque concertos, &quot;Pleasures of Their Company&quot; with soprano Kathleen Battle, produced by Patti Laursen and nominated for the 1986 Classical Record of the Year Grammy Award as well as the world premiere recording of Peter Warlock&#x27;s &quot;Capriol Suite&quot; with the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.

As an educator, Parkening has been instrumental in cementing the guitar&#x27;s reputation and esteem within academia. He created the guitar department at the University of Southern California in 1969, when he was only 22, and he was serving as the head of the department when he first retired from public performance at age 30. During his famous sabbatical from the guitar, spent mostly fly-fishing in Montana, he agreed to found a guitar department at Montana State University, and he did what he terms a &quot;token&quot; amount of teaching at MSU during this time. He was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Music from Montana State University in 1983. He is currently Distinguished Professor of Music and Chair in Classical Guitar at Pepperdine University, where, in addition to his work with guitar majors, he also teaches a public master class. In a 2013 interview, Parkening said that he is retired from the concert stage and is focused on his family and teaching.

Christopher Parkening lives with his wife, Theresa, and their son, Luke in Southern California.

<text>Richard Totten Button (July 18, 1929 – January 30, 2025) was an American figure skater and skating analyst. He was a two-time Olympic champion (1948, 1952) and five-time consecutive world champion (1948–1952). He was also the only non-European man to have become European champion. Button is credited as having been the first skater to successfully land the double Axel jump in competition in 1948, as well as the first triple jump of any kind – a triple loop – in 1952. He also invented the flying camel spin, which was originally known as the &quot;Button camel&quot;. He &quot;brought increased athleticism&quot; to figure skating in the years following World War II. According to figure skating historian James R. Hines, Button represented the &quot;American School&quot; of figure skating, which was a more athletic style than skaters from Europe.

==Early life==
Button was born on July 18, 1929, and raised in Englewood, New Jersey. He graduated in 1947 from the Englewood School for Boys (now Dwight-Englewood School). He began skating at an early age but did not begin training seriously until the age of 12, after his father overheard him being told he would never be a good skater. Button&#x27;s father sent him to Lake Placid, New York, to train with coach Gus Lussi, who coached him throughout his competitive career.

==Career==
===Amateur===
====Early competitions====
In his first competition, the 1943 Eastern States Novice Championship, Button finished second to Jean-Pierre Brunet. In 1944, he won the Eastern States junior title which earned him the opportunity to compete at the National Novice Championships. He won the event. In 1945, his third year of serious skating, he won the Eastern States senior title and the national junior title. He was also skating pairs, and competed with Barbara Jones in junior pairs at the 1946 Eastern States Championships. They performed Button&#x27;s singles program side-by-side with minor modifications and won. This competition, where Button also competed as a single skater, led into the 1946 U.S. Championships. At age 16, Button won the 1946 U.S. Championships by a unanimous vote. According to Button, this was the first time anyone had won the men&#x27;s novice, junior, and senior titles in three consecutive years. Button went on to win six more national championships (1947–1951), tying the record set by Roger Turner, who won seven U.S. Nationals between 1928 and 1934. This win earned Button a spot at the 1947 World Championships.

====1947 World Championships====
At the 1947 World Championships, Button was second behind rival Hans Gerschwiler following the compulsory figures part of the competition, with 34.9 points separating them. He won the free skating portion, but Gerschwiler had the majority of first places from the judges, three to Button&#x27;s two. Button won the silver medal at his first World Championships. It was the last time he placed lower than first in competition. At the competition, Button was befriended by Ulrich Salchow. Salchow, who was disappointed when Button did not win, presented him with the first International Cup Salchow had won in 1901. Button later passed on this trophy to John Misha Petkevich following the 1972 Olympics and World Championships. Acknowledging that Gerschwiler had a better understanding of outdoor ice, Button decided to spend some time training outdoors on the Lake Placid club tennis courts.

====1948 European Championships====
Button faced Gerschwiler again at the 1948 European Championships. Button led after figures in points, having 749 points to Gerschwiler&#x27;s 747.8, but Gerschwiler led in placings, with 14 to Button&#x27;s 15. During the free skating, Button performed his Olympic program for the first time. He won, with 11 placings to Gerschwiler&#x27;s 18. Following this year, when North Americans took home the men&#x27;s and ladies&#x27; titles, non-Europeans were no longer allowed to enter into the European Championships. Button is the only American to have won the European Championships.

====1948 Olympics====
At the 1948 Winter Olympics, Button led Gerschwiler by a 29.6 point lead following the figures portion of the competition, having won four of the five figures. Button had been attempting the double Axel jump in practice but had never landed it. In practice on the day before the free skating event, Button landed one in practice for the first time. He decided to put it into his free skating for the next day. Button landed it in competition, becoming the first skater in the world to do so. Button received eight firsts and two seconds, for a total of 10 places. Gerschwiler had 23. That combined with the figures results gave Button the gold medal. At the age of 18 he became, and remains, the youngest man to win the Olympic gold in figure skating.

====1948 World Championships====
Button went on to win the 1948 World Championships, where he faced Gerschwiler for the last time. Button won the event. At the time, the U.S. Championships were held after the World Championships, and Button finished his season by defending his national title. In February 1948, Button, his coach, and his mother were in Prague to perform an exhibition. They were stranded there after the Communist uprising and had to be extracted by the U.S. Army. In 1949, Button won the Sullivan Award as the outstanding amateur athlete in the United States. He is one of only two male figure skaters to win this award. Evan Lysacek is the other.

====College years====
Button had intended to attend Yale University beginning in the fall of 1947, but deferred a year due to the Olympics. Although he had originally been assured that his skating would not be a problem as long as his grades were good, he was later informed that he could not continue competing if he wanted to attend Yale. On advice from people from the Skating Club of Boston, Button applied to, and was accepted at, Harvard College. Button was a full-time student at Harvard while skating competitively and graduated in 1952 and was a member of The Delphic Club, one of the University&#x27;s select &quot;Final Clubs&quot;. He went on to win every international competition he entered for the next four years.

As reigning and defending champion, as well as being the first skater to perform a double Axel and a flying camel, Button was under pressure to perform a new jump or spin every season. In 1949, he performed a 2Lo-2Lo combination. He was the winner of the James E. Sullivan Award as the top U.S. amateur athlete of 1949, becoming the first figure skater to win the award. In 1950, he performed the 2Lo-2Lo-2Lo. In 1951, he performed a 2A-2Lo combination and a 2A-2A sequence. For the 1952 Winter Olympics, Button and Lussi began working on a triple jump. They settled on training the triple loop. Button landed it for the first time in practice in December 1951 at the Skating Club of Boston, and for the first time in exhibition in Vienna following the European Championships.

====1952 Olympics====
At the 1952 Winter Olympics, Button had the lead after figures, with nine first places, over Helmut Seibt. Button&#x27;s point total was 1,000.2 to Seibt&#x27;s 957.7. During his free skate program, Button successfully landed the triple loop, becoming the first person to complete a triple jump in competition He became the third male figure skater to win two Olympic gold medals after Gillis Grafström and Karl Schäfer. He was the last man to defend his Olympic title in figure skating until Yuzuru Hanyu won his second Olympic gold in 2018. He repeated as Gold medalist, then went on to defend his titles at the 1952 World Figure Skating Championships and U.S. Championships.

===Professional===
Button decided to enter Harvard Law School in the fall of 1952. Because of the time commitments, Button retired from amateur skating that year to focus on law school. He completed a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree in 1956 and was admitted to the bar in the District of Columbia.

Following his retirement from competition, Button had a short career performing in ice shows. He signed on to skate with the Ice Capades during his law school vacations. He toured with Holiday on Ice. He co-produced &quot;Dick Button&#x27;s Ice-Travaganza&quot; for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, starring 1963 World Champion Donald McPherson, but the ice show lost money and closed after a few months.

As founder of Candid Productions, he created a variety of made-for-television sports events, including the &quot;World Professional Figure Skating Championships&quot;, &quot;Challenge of Champions&quot;, and Dorothy Hamill specials for HBO. As an actor, Button performed in such films as &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; and &quot;The Bad News Bears Go to Japan&quot; starring Tony Curtis. He appeared in television roles, including &quot;Hans Brinker&quot; and &quot;Mr. Broadway&quot;, as well as appearing in a 1995 episode of &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, voicing himself in the three-part segment &quot;All the Words in the English Language&quot;.

Figure skating historian James R. Hines said that it was in roles other than as a skater in which Button has had the greatest influence on the sport. As Hines states, &quot;Perhaps no name is better known in figure skating, a result of his visibility for more than 40 years as a commentator. ...Through that forum, he had the opportunity to champion the sport more than any other person&quot;. Hines also says that Button&#x27;s commentating career gave him a 40-year long historical perspective. Button provided commentary for CBS&#x27;s broadcast of the 1960 Winter Olympics, launching a decades-long career in television broadcast journalism. He did commentary for CBS&#x27;s broadcast of the 1961 United States Figure Skating Championships. Beginning in 1962, he worked as a figure skating analyst for ABC Sports, which had acquired the rights to the United States Figure Skating Championships as well as the 1962 World Figure Skating Championships. During ABC&#x27;s coverage of figure skating events in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, Button became the sport&#x27;s best-known analyst, well known for his frank and often caustic appraisal of skaters&#x27; performances. He won an Emmy Award in 1981 for Outstanding Sports Personality – Analyst. Although other U.S. television networks aired the Winter Olympics from the 1990s onward, Button still appeared on ABC&#x27;s broadcasts of the U.S. and World Figure Skating Championships until ABC quit televising them in 2008.

According to writer and figure skating historian Ellyn Kestnbaum, for viewers who had never viewed the sport live before seeing it on television, Button &quot;in effect educated [an] entire generation in how to watch skating&quot;.

During the 2006 Winter Olympics, Button appeared on NBC on loan from ABC to once again provide commentary on the Olympics. Also during the 2006 Winter Olympics, USA Network ran a show called &quot;Olympic Ice&quot;. A recurring segment, called &quot;Push Dick&#x27;s Button,&quot; invited viewers to send in questions which Button answered on the air. The segment proved very popular so ABC and ESPN put it into various broadcasts, most notably the 2006 Skate America, the 2007 United States Figure Skating Championships, and the 2007 World Figure Skating Championships. In late 2010, he was lead judge on &quot;Skating with the Stars&quot;, produced by BBC Worldwide, producers of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. In 2009, Button served as a judge on the CBC&#x27;s &quot;Battle of the Blades&quot; reality show. He again appeared on NBC to do commentary for 2010 Games.

==Personal life and death==
Button&#x27;s television skating debut came on &quot;We the People&quot; on April 11, 1952, when he skated on the rink at Rockefeller Center. He was a guest on the TV show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got A Secret&quot; as one of five former Olympic champions which aired October 13, 1954. In 1975, Button married figure skating coach Slavka Kohout; a son Edward and a daughter Emily were born to the couple, who later divorced. Button was a resident of North Salem, New York. He was inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 1976, the same year it was founded.

Button suffered a serious head injury on July 5, 1978, when he was one of several men assaulted in Central Park by a gang of youths armed with baseball bats. Three persons were subsequently convicted of assault for the attacks. News accounts and trial testimony indicated the assailants were intending to target gay people, but the victims were attacked at random, and that because of the random nature of the attacks &quot;... the police said there was no reason to believe the victims were homosexual.&quot;

On December 31, 2000, Button was skating at a public rink in Westchester County, New York, when he fell, fracturing his skull and causing a serious brain injury. He recovered and became a national spokesman for the Brain Injury Association of America as well as continuing his Emmy Award–winning commentary on broadcasts of the Olympic Games and on various figure-skating television shows.

Button died in North Salem on January 30, 2025, at the age of 95. His death occurred less than a day after several participants in the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, including skaters and coaches from the Skating Club of Boston with which Button had a life-long association, were killed in a mid-air collision over the Potomac River.

<doc id="728329" wikidata="Q605642" url="?curid=728329" title="Mercury-Atlas 3">
<text>Mercury-Atlas 3 (MA-3) was an unmanned spaceflight of the Mercury program. It was launched unmanned on April 25, 1961 at 16:15 UTC, from Launch Complex 14 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Mercury capsule contained a robotic &quot;mechanical astronaut&quot;. Mercury spacecraft No. 8 and Atlas No. 8 100-D were used in the mission.

The Atlas used for the flight (Missile 100D) incorporated a number of technical improvements including thicker skin to handle the added weight of the Mercury capsule and prevent a recurrence of the Mercury-Atlas 1 failure. In addition, it sported a new, transistorized telemetry unit to replace the old-fashioned system used on previous Atlas vehicles which utilized vacuum tubes, was bulky, had high power consumption, and whose signal strength tended to degrade during launch. The revamped telemetry box had first been designed for the Atlas-Centaur and quickly adapted for the Mercury program.

However, this flight would prove that the Atlas was still far from a reliable, man-rated booster. The launch proceeded normally until about T+20 seconds when the pitch and roll sequence failed to initiate and the vehicle instead just continued flying straight upward. As Mercury Flight Director Gene Kranz recalled, &quot;Seconds after the launch, a note of anxiety crept into the Welsh accent of Tec Roberts, the flight dynamics officer (FIDO) responsible for launch and orbital trajectory control, as he reported, &#x27;Flight, negative roll-and-pitch program.&#x27; A collective shudder went through everyone in the control room as the controllers absorbed the chilling significance of Roberts&#x27;s terse report. The roll-and-pitch program normally changed the initial vertical trajectory of the launch into a more horizontal one that would take the Atlas out over the Atlantic. This Atlas was still inexplicably flying straight up, threatening the Cape and the surrounding communities. The worst-case scenario would be for it to pitch back toward land or explode. The higher it flew before it exploded, the wider the &#x27;footprint&#x27; of debris scattered all over the Cape and surrounding area would be. The RSO (range safety officer) monitoring the launch confirmed the lack of a roll-and-pitch program, then continued to give the Atlas an opportunity to recover and start its track across the Atlantic. The RSO lifted the cover on the command button and watched as the Atlas raced to a fatal convergence with the limits on his plot board. At forty-three seconds after liftoff, Roberts reported, &#x27;The range safety officer has transmitted the destruct command.&#x27; We waited, not speaking, counting the seconds, listening for the telltale, muffled &quot;krump&quot; that would signal the mission was over. Carl Huss, the retro controller (RETRO), responsible for reentry trajectory planning and operations, reported, &#x27;Radar tracking multiple targets.&#x27; Roberts&#x27;s response echoed all our feelings: &#x27;Chris, I&#x27;m sorry.&#x27; We sat by the consoles, not talking for several seconds. Then, one by one, the controllers closed their countdown books and started to pack their documents.&quot;

Only 43 seconds after liftoff, Mercury-Atlas 3&#x27;s mission ended in a rain of fiery debris falling back to Earth. The escape tower activated the moment the destruct command was sent and lofted Mercury spacecraft #8 to safety. The capsule flew to an apogee of 7.2 km and downrange only 1.8 km. The flight of the Mercury capsule lasted 7 minutes and 19 seconds, most of that time descending on its parachute. The spacecraft was recovered some 20 minutes after launch in the Atlantic Ocean by a US Marine CH-37 helicopter and reused on the next flight (MA-4) as spacecraft No. 8A. One comforting fact to the Mercury team was that the flight verified the reliability of the launch escape system. This was the first Mercury-Atlas launch with a live escape tower.

Investigation of telemetry data quickly narrowed the cause of the failure to a fault somewhere in the guidance system, but the exact nature of it could not be determined. It appeared that the missile programmer either shut off completely shortly after liftoff or suffered a power outage, restarted, and then failed to execute the pitch and roll sequence. Two months after the MA-3 flight, the Atlas&#x27;s programmer was discovered buried in mud on a beach not far from the launch pad and examined. The exact cause of the failure was not determined with certainty, but several possible causes were proposed, including contamination of pins in the programmer or a transient voltage that had caused the programmer to reset itself. The programmer on the whole was found to have several serious design flaws that required correction.

<text>Cache Valley &quot;(Shoshoni: Seuhubeogoi, “Willow Valley”)&quot; is a valley of northern Utah and southeast Idaho, United States, that includes the Logan metropolitan area. The valley was used by 19th century mountain men and was the site of the 1863 Bear River Massacre. The name, Cache Valley is often used synonymously to describe the Logan Metropolitan Area, one of the fastest growing metro areas in the US per capita — both in terms of economic GDP and population.

==History==
Alongside habitation by the Shoshone and other indigenous peoples, European explorer Michel Bourdon discovered Cache Valley 1818 during a MacKenzie fur expedition. The valley was subsequently used for the second of the annual gatherings of mountain men. Many of the trappers who worked in the valley came from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, the Northwest Fur Company, and the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. The name &quot;Cache Valley&quot; was derived by the fur trappers who hid their trading goods in s in that region. The use of caches was a method used by fur traders to protect their goods from theft and damage.

Latter-day Saint William Gardner became the first Anglo-American permanent settler in 1852. Prior to the Mormon selection of the Salt Lake Valley, Jim Bridger had recommended Cache Valley due to its relative abundance of fresh water. A Mormon settler group led by Peter Maughan arrived via Box Elder Canyon (commonly referred to as Sardine Canyon) in July 1856 and additional settlers arrived on September 15.

Early Anglo-American settlers of Cache Valley took a defensive stance toward the indigenous Native Americans by creating the Cache Valley Militia. Men from the various towns in Cache Valley nicknamed &quot;minute men&quot; volunteered to drill, serve as watchmen, and to ride to the aid of other colonies at the news of attacks and skirmishes.

On January 29, 1863, an expedition from Camp Douglas, Utah to Cache Valley, the United States Army at the request of Cache Valley settlers attacked a Shoshone village in the early morning at the confluence of the Bear River and Beaver Creek (now Battle Creek) in what became known as the Bear River Massacre. Officially, numbers of Shoshone dead have varied, but estimates settle around 400-500 dead, including hundreds of women and children. This is still the largest massacre of Native American peoples by the United States government today.

==Transportation==

U.S. Highways 89 and 91 enter the valley from the southwest as one highway, and then separate in downtown Logan. US-89 goes northeast into Logan Canyon, and thence to Bear Lake, a large lake in the area. US-91 goes due northward into Idaho and to reconnect with I-15. Several state highways run through the valley: In Idaho, State Highways 34 and 36; and in Utah, SR-23, SR-30, SR-101, SR-142, SR-165, SR-200, and SR-218.

The valley is served by the Cache Valley Transit District (CVTD), a zero-fare bus system. CVTD primarily serves the Logan area however offers shuttle service to Preston.

There are two airports in the valley, the Logan-Cache Airport and Preston Airport. Neither airport provides commercial service, however Salt Lake City International Airport is within driving distance (less than 2 hours).

<text>Galápagos () is a province of Ecuador in the country&#x27;s Insular region, located approximately off the western coast of the mainland. The capital is Puerto Baquerizo Moreno.

The province administers the Galápagos Islands, a group of tiny volcanic islands that sit on the equator, famous for their unique biodiversity popularized by naturalist Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution.

==Demographics==
Ethnic groups as of the Ecuadorian census of 2010:
*Mestizo 74.5%
*White 9.7%
*Indigenous 7.0%
*Afro-Ecuadorian 5.2%
*Montubio 1.9%
*Other 1.7%

==History==

It is estimated that the islands were formed 8 million years ago as a result of tectonic activity on the seabed.
The archipelago was likely inhabited long ago: the Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl in 1963 reported that he found Inca archaeological sites and objects.
The Galapagos Islands were discovered by chance on 10 March 1535, when the Dominican friar Fray Tomas de Berlanga, Bishop of Panama, went to Peru in pursuance of an order of the Spanish monarch, Charles V, to arbitrate in a dispute between Francisco Pizarro and his subordinates after the conquest of the Inca empire. Because of a calm and strong currents, the ship of Bishop was dragged to the Galapagos. In chronicling his adventure, directed from Portoviejo Emperor Charles V on the discovery of the Galapagos Islands, Berlanga described the bleak desert conditions in the islands and the giant tortoises that inhabited them. He also described the marine iguanas, sea lions and many types of birds, emphasizing the unusual mildness of animals and expressed in the following words:
==Early explorations==

The first maps to include the islands were prepared by Abraham Ortelius and Gerardus Mercator around 1570. The islands were described as &quot;the Galopegos Insulae&quot; (Turtle Island).
The Galapagos were used by pirates hideout in English as trips to plunder Spanish galleons carrying gold and silver from America to Spain. The first known pirate to visit the islands was Richard Hawkins, in 1593. From then until 1816 many pirates came to the archipelago.

Alexander Selkirk, (1676 – 13 December 1721), also known as Alexander Selcraig, was a Scottish sailor who was the man whose adventures on the islands of Juan Fernández (explorer), () was a Spanish explorer and navigator in the Pacific regions of the Viceroyalty of Peru and Captaincy General of Chile west of colonial South America who inspired Daniel Defoe to write Robinson Crusoe, visited the Galapagos in 1708 after he was rescued from the island of Juan Fernández by the privateer Woodes Rogers. Rogers was at the archipelago to repair their ships after sacking Guayaquil.
The first scientific mission that visited the Galapagos was the Malaspina expedition, a Spanish expedition led by Alejandro Malaspina, who arrived in 1790. However, the records of the expedition were never published.

In 1793, James Colnett, (1753 – 1 September 1806) was an officer of the British Royal Navy, an explorer, and a maritime fur trade described the flora and fauna of the islands and suggested they could be used as base for the whalers operating in the Pacific Ocean. Collnet also drew the first charts of the Galapagos. These whalers captured and killed thousands of tortoises in the archipelago because the tortoises could survive for months without food or drink. The gigantic Galapagos tortoises were transported inside the holds of whaling ships. A phrase &quot;living cupboards&quot; could be desortugas would be kept alive and killed when fresh meat was required by the whaling crews. Tortoises provided fresh protein on the long journeys typical of whaling ships. Hunting of these tortoises was the cause of the large decrease of their population, and in some cases the destruction of certain species of the Galapagos Tortoise.

==Political divisions==

The province is divided in three cantons, each encompassing a number of islands. They are:

<text>Alfred Mosher Butts (April 13, 1899 – April 4, 1993) was an American architect, famous for inventing the board game &quot;Scrabble&quot; in 1938.

==Biography==
Alfred Mosher Butts was born in Poughkeepsie, New York, on April 13, 1899, to Allison Butts and Arrie Elizabeth Mosher. His father was a lawyer, and his mother a high school teacher. Alfred attended Poughkeepsie High School and graduated in 1917. He then graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in architecture in 1924.

He was also an amateur artist, and six of his drawings were acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Butts and his wife, Nina, who died circa 1979, were married for 54 years; they had no children. He died on April 4, 1993, nine days before his 94th birthday.

==Board games==
===&quot;Scrabble&quot;===
In the early 1930s, after working as an architect but now unemployed, Butts set out to design a board game. He studied existing games and found that games fell into three categories: number games, such as dice and bingo; move games, such as chess and checkers; and word games, such as anagrams. Butts was a resident of Jackson Heights, New York, and the game of &quot;Scrabble&quot; was invented there. To memorialize his importance to the invention of the game, a street sign at 35th Avenue and 81st Street in Jackson Heights is stylized using letters with their values in Scrabble as a subscript.

Butts decided to create a game that utilized both chance and skill by combining elements of anagrams and crossword puzzles, a popular pastime of the 1920s. Players draw seven lettered tiles from a pool and then attempt to form words from their letters. A key to the game was Butts&#x27;s analysis of the English language. Butts studied the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; to calculate how frequently each letter of the alphabet was used. He then used each letter&#x27;s frequency to determine how many of each letter he would include in the game. He included only four &quot;S&quot; tiles so that the ability to make words plural would not make the game too easy.

Butts initially called the game &quot;Lexiko&quot;, but later changed the name to &quot;Criss Cross Words&quot; after considering &quot;It&quot;, and began to seek a buyer. The game makers he originally contacted rejected the idea, but Butts was tenacious. Eventually, he sold the rights to entrepreneur and game lover James Brunot, who made a few minor adjustments to the design and renamed the game &quot;Scrabble&quot;.

In 1948, the game was trademarked, and Brunot and his wife converted an abandoned schoolhouse in Dodgingtown, Connecticut, into a &quot;Scrabble&quot; factory. In 1949, the Brunots made 2,400 sets and lost $450 . But the game was steadily gaining popularity, helped by orders from Macy&#x27;s department store. By 1952, the Brunots could no longer keep up with demand and asked licensed game maker Selchow and Righter to market and distribute the game. As of 2009, over 150 million sets had been sold worldwide, with between one and two million sets sold each year in North America alone.

===&quot;Alfreds Other Game&quot;===
In his 80s, Butts invented another game, titled simply &quot; Other Game&quot;, released in 1985 by Selchow and Righter. Also a tile-based game, it includes 144 letter tiles and four playing boards. Players receive 36 letters from which they try to make as many word combinations as possible. Butts called it &quot;simultaneous solitaire&quot;. It never achieved the commercial success of &quot;Scrabble&quot;. , the game has a rating of 5.5 out of 10 on the BoardGameGeek website.

<doc id="728340" wikidata="Q645695" url="?curid=728340" title="Mercury-Atlas 1">
<text>Mercury-Atlas 1 (MA-1) was the first attempt to launch a Mercury capsule and occurred on July 29, 1960 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. The spacecraft was unmanned and carried no launch escape system. The Atlas rocket suffered a structural failure 58 seconds after launch at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet (9.1 km) and 11,000 feet (3.4 km) down range. All booster telemetry signals suddenly ceased as the vehicle was passing through Max Q. Because the day was rainy and overcast, the booster was out of sight from 26 seconds after launch, and it was impossible to see what happened.

The mission was to conduct a suborbital test flight and reentry of the spacecraft. The capsule carried live separation rockets, but dummy retrorockets. Several other systems were not installed, including the cabin pressurization system and the astronaut couch. A number of Mercury engineers had voiced their objection to the launch because the weather would prevent observation of the flight. Some witnesses claimed to have heard an explosion, but this could not be verified. The capsule continued transmitting until it impacted the ocean, approximately downrange. Salvage brought the capsule, Atlas booster engines and LOX vent valve to the surface from the ocean floor. The engines showed no sign of damage except some deformation from impact with the ocean, but the vent valve and a still-attached segment of piping had noticeable fatigue cracks.

==Investigation==

Telemetry indicated that the Atlas functioned normally up to T+58 seconds and there was no sign of any problems up to that point, when a severe axial disturbance was detected. Approximately one second later, the pressure difference between the RP-1 and LOX tanks dropped to zero followed by loss of engine thrust and telemetry and the appearance of multiple objects on radar. Capsule data indicated violent movements following the loss of booster telemetry, but the Mercury otherwise continued functioning normally until impact with the ocean at around 220 seconds after launch. The automatic abort system appeared to have functioned correctly and issued a shutdown command to the Atlas&#x27;s engines the moment that it detected an abnormal situation. The parachute system did not deploy because the abort had taken place too early in the launch.
Unlike R&amp;D Atlas D missiles, Atlas 50D was not carrying a large complement of telemetry probes; only 50 measurements were taken on this flight. The Atlas appeared to be on a steady flight path when telemetry was lost at T+60 seconds, but the last 1.2 seconds of telemetry data was questionable due to open circuits in the booster following the disturbance. The capsule gyroscope data suggested that the stack had pitched over as much as 10°. There had been two separate disturbances. The first one, at T+58.5 seconds, had caused the instant loss of telemetry measurements in the forward part of the booster. The second disturbance occurred at T+59.4 seconds, following the Abort Sensing and Implementation System (ASIS)-generated engine cutoff. The propulsion system did not appear to be affected by the initial event.

==Conclusions==
The initial suspicion was that the fiberglass fairing placed on top of the capsule to sit in place of the absent LES had broken loose and punctured Atlas&#x27;s LOX tank. NASA&#x27;s Owen Maynard, who was involved in Mercury systems engineering, led the recovery of the MA-1 capsule from the sea floor (in which he performed a free-dive to find one particular missing component of the capsule). He stated in an oral history interview that his post-flight calculations showed the skin of the launch vehicle just below the spacecraft would have buckled due to the combined drag, acceleration, and bending loads which exceeded the resisting tensile stress in the skin provided by internal pressure. Maynard recalled that &quot;The problem of mating the Mercury capsule to the Atlas was far from being properly resolved at the time of MA-1.&quot; Based on that finding, NASA specified that future Mercury-Atlas launch vehicles add doublers to the skin structure in that area, and that future launch trajectories be shallowed to reduce pitch angle rate, to reduce the bending stress on the launch vehicle. In fact, Atlas 50D already had slightly thicker skin than Big Joe&#x27;s booster (Atlas 10D) but only on the RP-1 tank while the LOX tank still had the standard thin-gauge Atlas ICBM skin. This failure mode did not recur on those subsequent launches. There were also suspicions that the lack of a launch escape system had negatively affected the booster&#x27;s aerodynamic profile. Convair engineers had argued that including the LES was necessary both from an aerodynamic standpoint and for data-gathering purposes, but Mercury program officials ultimately ruled against it.

The capsule reached an apogee of and flew downrange. The flight lasted 3 minutes and 18 seconds. Capsule weight . Serial numbers: Atlas 50-D, Mercury spacecraft #4.

Pieces of Mercury spacecraft #4, used in the Mercury-Atlas 1 mission, are currently displayed at the Cosmosphere in Hutchinson, Kansas. The hatch is at the American Space Museum in Titusville, Florida.

<doc id="728342" wikidata="Q4920503" url="?curid=728342" title="Black Cat (Washington, D.C., nightclub)">
<text>The Black Cat is a nightclub in Washington, D.C., located on 14th Street Northwest in the Shaw/U Street neighborhood. The club was founded in 1993 by former Gray Matter drummer Dante Ferrando, along with a group of investors (including D.C. area native, Nirvana drummer, and future Foo Fighters leader Dave Grohl) and quickly established itself as a venue for independent music. While the Black Cat is most known for its support of indie rock, featured musical acts include metal, punk, and electronic, as well as DJ/dance nights.

The Black Cat&#x27;s &quot;Mainstage&quot; is on the second floor and has a capacity of 800, which can be scaled back to a smaller room with a capacity of 550.

Until 2019, Black Cat hosted lesser known acts on the &quot;Backstage&quot;, a smaller area on the first floor. The first floor of the club also contained a no-cover bar/lounge called the &quot;Red Room&quot;, and the &quot;Food For Thought&quot; café. Serving primarily vegetarian food, along with some meat and vegan dishes, &quot;Food For Thought&quot; is named for the Dupont Circle vegetarian restaurant – owned by Ferrando&#x27;s father, Bob Ferrando – that operated from 1973 to 1999.

It was announced in September 2018 that, by the end of the year, the venue would shrink in half and that the &quot;Backstage&quot; and &quot;Red Room&quot; would close, moving into a much smaller space upstairs in the venue due to declining interest from patrons of the venue and Ferrando saying that they are making room for one or two retail tenants that fit in better with the new landscape of the neighborhood. 
In 2001, the venue moved three doors south, from 1831 to 1811 14th Street.

The building that the Black Cat now operates in used to be a dance club called The Cage, and before that, Mattos Paints.

The Black Cat is served by the U Street station on the Washington Metro, about three blocks from the stop.

The venue has hosted many successful musical artists, the likes of which include Jeff Buckley, Bikini Kill, Death Cab for Cutie, The Cramps, The Killers, The Strokes, Elliott Smith, Molchat Doma, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.

<doc id="728359" wikidata="Q504238" url="?curid=728359" title="Loja Province">
<text>Loja Province () is one of 24 provinces in Ecuador and shares its southern border on the west with El Oro Province, on the north with El Azuay, and on the east with Zamora-Chinchipe. Founded on its present site in 1548 by Captain Alonso de Mercadillo (Spanish), the site had been previously moved and rebuilt from La Toma due to earthquakes. It also is named as &quot;Cuxibamba Valley&quot;, from the Quichua language, which means the &quot;Smiley Valley&quot;.

== Overview ==
Loja is located in a high Andean valley at an elevation of 7,300 feet (2,225 m). It had a population of 448,966 inhabitants at the 2010 census. It is recognized as being a friendly and pleasant city. This was demonstrated when Loja, both the provincial capital and one of the oldest cities in Ecuador, won a community involvement award in 2001 in recognition of the community&#x27;s ongoing effort to support and to protect the environment.

Surrounded by two rivers, the Zamora and Malacatos, Loja has a variety of microclimates. This unique position results in numerous ecological zones. Based between the humid Amazon basin and the coastal sechura desert in Peru the environment consists of páramo, cloud forest and jungle landscapes. 86% of the province is covered by hills or mountains.

Its historical buildings and colonial architecture make the city of Loja a popular tourist attraction.

Famous for the Vírgen del Cisne religious festivals it organizes in September every year, Loja is also known for its musicians. The city has a number of important music academies, including the Conservatorio Nacional de Musica, the house of the most influential musicians in Ecuador. The city is commonly referred to as the &#x27;musical capital of Ecuador.&#x27; There are also two universities, Universidad Tecnica Particular De Loja and Universidad Nacional de Loja. There is an important law school here as well.

Just south of Loja (42 km) is Vilcabamba, which is known as the Valley of Longevity. Inhabitants of this community enjoy a long life span due to its ideal climate and local hot springs. Researchers and scientists have regularly visited the town, studying its geographical conditions, climate, soil and water. Articles have even appeared in well known periodicals such as &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; and &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine, providing their own theories to the longevity of Vilcabamba&#x27;s inhabitants.

Loja is credited with being the first city in Ecuador to have acquired the means to produce electricity. Electric power was supplied to the city by the introduction of the Itaipu Hydroelectric Dam, the original structure of which was completed in 1896.

== Economy ==

A lot of investment has been made recently in the cochinilla farms that provide commodities for both the textile and cosmetic industries. La Toma historically has provided suitable conditions for many sugar plantations. Commodities such as sugar and coffee are not often grown to be exported internationally like cochinilla, but are instead bought and sold domestically.

Loja Province has seen its fair share of mining, predominantly gold and bauxite, which has consequently caused damage to the environment.

==Demographics==
Ethnic groups as of the Ecuadorian census of 2010:
*Mestizo 90.2%
*Indigenous 3.7%
*White 3.9%
*Afro-Ecuadorian 1.4%
*Montubio 0.7%
*Other 0.1%

==Government and politics==

Loja Province, much like other divisions in Ecuador, is divided into three main institutions.

* Municipio, which is elected by the population every four years and is headed by the Mayor (Jorge Bailón as of 2021)
* Prefectura, which is the government at a local level and is headed by the Prefecto. This institution is responsible for all the 16 cantons and is elected by the population every four years.
* Gobernacion delegates the work from the president which is concentrated at the national level. The candidate is elected by the president himself.

==Ecology==
The region is famous for plants, bird species, and butterflies which can often be seen in protected national parks, the most important being Podocarpus. This park is 1,463 square kilometres and has an elevation ranging from 1000 m to 3690 m. The park is home for a number of animals like bears and pumas as well as exotic birdlife. Over 40% of the park&#x27;s 3,000–4,000 plant species are endemic, unique to this area. There are also more than 600 species of birds here.

* Cherimoyas: This tasty fruit occurs naturally in Loja Province, in the localities of Amaluza, Cariamanga, Gonzanamá, and Vilcabamba. Its natural occurrence comprises altitudes of 1500 to 2000 meters of altitude. Mean optimal annual temperature for cherimoya growing in Ecuador is between 18 and 20 °C. Optimal annual precipitation is 800 – 1,000 mm.

==Cantons==

The province is divided into 16 cantons. The following table lists each with its population at the 2010 census, its area in square kilometres (km2), and the name of its canton seat or capital.

<doc id="728361" wikidata="Q812997" url="?curid=728361" title="Bear Lake (Idaho–Utah)">
<text>Bear Lake is a natural freshwater lake on the Idaho–Utah border in the Western United States. About in size, it is split about equally between the two states; its Utah portion comprises the second-largest natural freshwater lake in Utah, after Utah Lake. The lake has been called the &quot;Caribbean of the Rockies&quot; for its unique turquoise-blue color, which is due to the refraction of calcium carbonate (limestone) deposits suspended in the lake. Its water properties have led to the evolution of several unique species of fauna that occur only within the lake. Bear Lake is over 250,000 years old. It was formed by fault subsidence that continues today, slowly deepening the lake along the eastern side. In 1911 the majority of the flow of the Bear River was diverted into Bear Lake via Mud Lake and a canal from Stewart Dam, ending 11,000 years of separation between the lake and that river system.

Today the lake is a popular destination for tourists and sports enthusiasts, and the surrounding valley has gained a reputation for having high-quality raspberries.

==History==
The first known inhabitants of the Bear Lake Valley were Shoshone tribes, but the area was known to many Native Americans. The first record of Europeans seeing the lake is from 1818 when French-Canadian trappers working for the North West Company followed the Bear River upstream to the valley.

Originally named &quot;Black Bear Lake&quot; by Donald McKenzie, an explorer for the North West Fur Company who explored the lake in 1819, the name was later shortened to Bear Lake. Following his exploration of the lake, Mckenzie held what is known to be the largest rendezvous of Native Americans to take place in the Rocky Mountains. Nearly 10,000 American Indians from various tribes camped along 7 miles of Bear Lake&#x27;s north shore, trading with Mckenzie and his trapping company.

The south end of the lake, in the area of modern-day Laketown, was also the location of two of the annual Rocky Mountain Rendezvous in the summers of 1827 and 1828. Mountain men, including Jedediah Smith and Jim Bridger, gathered at this location, along with trade goods suppliers and American Indians from several different tribes. The mountain men and Indians sold their furs in exchange for various store goods and supplies, and several weeks were spent reveling in assorted amusements and liquor.

Smith&#x27;s arrival in June 1827 was especially historic, as it marked the completion of the first ever overland round-trip to California from the United States. He wrote in his journal: &quot;My arrival caused a considerable bustle in camp for myself and party had been given up as lost.&quot;

Although the lake lies relatively near the Oregon Trail, which runs north and east of the lake, and was traveled by many pioneers between 1836 and the 1850s, it seems none of them went south enough to view the lake. It was not until 1863 that Mormon pioneers led by Charles C. Rich settled in the Bear Lake Valley, but they made an agreement with Native Americans, which left most of the Utah portion of the valley in Indian possession. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints gradually moved south and established the villages of Garden City, Pickelville, and Laketown, each along the lake&#x27;s shore.

In 1911 a diversion was constructed at Wardboro, Idaho that redirected the majority of the flow of the Bear River into Bear Lake via Mud Lake. Water then exits Bear Lake via an outlet canal to rejoin the Bear River. This allows the upper 6.5 meters of Bear Lake to act as a reservoir for the Bear River, storing spring runoff for irrigation later in the year. Before the construction of this connection, Bear Lake had been isolated from the Bear River for 11,000 years, though Bear River has connected to Bear Lake naturally several times over the 250,000-year existence of the Lake.

In later years, Bear Lake became a resort and recreation area, with many developers selling lake shore and mountain view lots. The beaches of Lakota and Ideal were given to private development in the 1970s, including the Blue Water and Sweetwater developments. The State of Utah bought the far southeast beach for use as a state park, and the state also operates a marina on the lake&#x27;s west side.

== Geographic features ==
Formed in a half graben valley straddling the Idaho-Utah border, the lake has an approximate area of and sits at an elevation of along the northeast side of the Wasatch Range and the east side of the Bear River Mountains.

The lake and surrounding areas are popular summer tourist destinations. The lake has many marinas, beaches, and two tourist towns in Utah: Garden City and Laketown. It also has two state parks, each named Bear Lake State Park: one in Idaho and one in Utah. The Utah state park includes a one-half-mile-long Rendezvous Beach at the south end of the lake, the location of the 1827 and 1828 rendezvous, and a three-mile-long Cisco Beach on the east side, plus the additional campground, marina, and boat ramp areas. The Idaho state park includes north and an east unit, each with a one-mile-long beach. Bear Lake National Wildlife Refuge extends up from the north end of the lake.

===Climate===
==Native and naturalized animals==

Bear Lake has a high rate of endemism (native species not naturally found anywhere else). Several species evolved in the lake&#x27;s waters, but many went extinct after the diversion of the Bear River into the lake. Surviving known endemic species of fish include the Bear Lake strain of the Bonneville cutthroat trout, Bonneville cisco, Bonneville whitefish, Bear Lake whitefish, and Bear Lake sculpin. There have been attempts to transplant these species to other areas without success, with the exception of the Bear Lake Cutthroat Trout strain. This trout has flourished in other large bodies of cool water, including the Strawberry and Scofield reservoirs.

&quot;The Bonneville cisco eat only small aquatic invertebrates or zooplankton. They are eaten by larger fish in the lake including whitefish, Bonneville Cutthroat Trout, and introduced lake trout.&quot; Although several fish species have been introduced into the lake, those native species which survived the Bear River diversion have continued to thrive under careful management.

Water from the lake is used for irrigation in the nearby Bear Valley in southeast Idaho and for recreational fishing. The lake drains via the Bear River Outlet, completed in 1915, into the Bear River which eventually flows into the northeast portion of Great Salt Lake.

==Raspberry cultivation==
Bear Lake has become famous for the surrounding valley&#x27;s crops of raspberries and for the annual Raspberry Days festival held in Garden City to celebrate the harvest of raspberries, generally during the first week of August. This event is said to bring thousands of people from all over the world and features rodeos, parades, fireworks, dances, a craft fair, &quot;Miss Berry Princess contest&quot;, raspberry recipe cookoff, a talent show, fun run and concerts.

A majority of the originally introduced Bear Lake Raspberry plants were infected with a fungal virus during 2001 called the &quot;raspberry bushy dwarf virus&quot;. Fewer than five acres survived. The epidemic resulted in most of the large berry businesses in Garden City being wiped out. Some crop acreage was replaced by newly introduced virus-resistant plants. Although some varieties of raspberries are resistant to the virus, none produce fruit as succulent and sweet as the previously cultivated plants. The raspberry business has since been redeveloped, and raspberries are again thriving, mostly in the southern end of the valley.

== Recreation ==
One of the main reasons Bear Lake has become a popular vacation destination is due to the high amount of recreational activities and attractions that are available throughout the year.
In the summertime, swimming, water-skiing, jet-skiing, boating, and sailing draw people to the water. Tourists also pass the time exploring the local caves or golf courses or taking mountain trails on foot, bike, ATV, or horseback.
In the cooler months, hunting, snow skiing, snowmobiling, or ice fishing are common attractions.
Many people try a &quot;famous raspberry shake&quot; at one of the local restaurants, or see a play at the Pickleville Playhouse.

<doc id="728400" wikidata="Q3268711" url="?curid=728400" title="Harry F. Byrd Jr.">
<text>Harry Flood Byrd Jr. (December 20, 1914 – July 30, 2013) was an American orchardist, newspaper publisher and politician. He served in the Senate of Virginia and then represented Virginia in the United States Senate, succeeding his father, Harry F. Byrd Sr. His public service spanned thirty-six years, while he was a publisher of several Virginia newspapers. After the decline of the Byrd Organization due to its massive resistance to racial integration of public schools, he abandoned the Democratic Party in 1970, citing concern about its leftward tilt. He rehabilitated his political career, becoming the first independent in the history of the U.S. Senate to be elected by a majority of the popular vote.

==Family and education==

Byrd was born December 20, 1914, in Winchester, Virginia, the eldest child of Harry F. Byrd Sr. and his wife Anne Byrd (née Beverley). His siblings included a sister, Westwood (&quot;Westie&quot;), and two brothers, Richard Evelyn (Dick) and Beverley. The Byrds were one of the First Families of Virginia, and Byrd was a member of the Virginia Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. His uncle, Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, was a pilot and polar explorer.

In 1931, at his father&#x27;s urging, young Harry Byrd enrolled at Virginia Military Institute. Two years later, Byrd transferred to the University of Virginia, where he became a member of the St. Anthony Hall fraternity, but left before graduating due to familial obligations.

On August 9, 1941, Byrd married Gretchen Thompson. They had sons Harry and Thomas, and a daughter Beverley.

==Newspaper career and military service==
In 1935, Byrd, nicknamed &quot;Young Harry&quot;, left the University of Virginia in Charlottesville to shore up his father&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Winchester Star&quot;. He also gave up an opportunity to join a global business in Paris. The &quot;Star&quot; had been without a full-time editor since his father left to represent Virginia in the United States Senate in 1933, as the Great Depression intensified. Upon joining the paper, his father warned him, &quot;If you make too many mistakes, you&#x27;re gone.&quot; However, the father also arranged for his son to learn the publishing business under the tutelage of John Crown at the &quot;Harrisonburg Daily News Record&quot;. Within a year of assuming the helm of the &quot;Winchester Star&quot;, Byrd became its editor and publisher, although his father retained financial control and advised him on editorials.

Byrd worked with many publishers of small newspapers in Virginia, assuming leadership sometimes directly or otherwise through a seat on the paper&#x27;s board of directors. He became the publisher of the &quot;Harrisonburg Daily News Record&quot; from 1936 to 1941 and again from 1946 to 1981, and continued as a member of its board of directors until his death. Byrd later became owner of the Page Shenandoah Newspaper Corporation, which published &quot;The Page News and Courier&quot; in Luray and &quot;The Shenandoah Valley Herald&quot; in Woodstock. He left the Page Shenandoah Newspaper Corporation in 1987 and retired as Chairman of the Byrd newspapers in 2001, succeeded by his son Thomas. In all, he dedicated 78 years to publishing in one capacity or another. The entire Byrd family owned the publishing company for more than 100 years.

Shortly after his marriage, Byrd volunteered for the United States Navy during World War II and served initially in Navy Public Relations. He requested transfer to a combat position and was assigned to the Central Pacific as an executive officer with a bombing squadron of Consolidated PB2Y Coronados until mustering out in 1946. During his naval service, he rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander.

After the war, Byrd oversaw construction of a new publishing plant for the &quot;Star&quot;. He also became a director of the Associated Press and later served as its vice-president.

==Virginia state senator ==

In 1948 Byrd won election to the Senate of Virginia for the district including Winchester, the area his father previously represented. He was the third consecutive generation of the Byrd family to enter politics. His grandfather Richard Evelyn Byrd Sr. served as the Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, and his father had served as a Virginia state senator, Governor of Virginia and United States senator. Byrd had begun accompanying his father on trips during the elder&#x27;s governorship, and once remarked that &quot;I was in every county and city in the state by the time I was thirteen years old.&quot; In time Byrd became a key member in his father&#x27;s statewide political network, known as the Byrd Organization.

Byrd shared his father&#x27;s belief in fiscal restraint by government, referred to as a &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; policy. He reflected part of this populist political legacy when he stated, &quot;I am convinced we have too many laws, too much government regulation, much too much government spending. The very wealthy can take care of themselves, the very needy are taken care of by the government. It is Middle America, the broad cross section, the people who work and to whom the government must look for taxes - it is they who have become the forgotten men and women.&quot;

Byrd served in the Senate of Virginia from 1948 to November 1965, where he was Chairman of the General Laws Committee. As a major player in the Byrd Organization, he supported Massive Resistance, a movement against desegregation which his father announced and led, despite the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. In 1956, Byrd provided strong and integral support of legislation that became known as the Stanley Plan (after then-Virginia Governor Thomas B. Stanley, a Byrd Organization member). The plan required the closing of all desegregating schools, even those desegregating pursuant to court order. It was invalidated within three years by both federal courts and the Virginia Supreme Court. The plan&#x27;s legacy of racially based school closures and funding disruptions persisted in some localities until 1964, and was the nadir of the Byrd political brand.

The U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Davis v. Mann&quot; and &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; invalidated the unequal voting district apportionment relied upon by the Byrd Organization; Byrd made no plan or significant effort to reverse the organization&#x27;s decline. Indeed, Byrd from the outset was intent on forging his own political path. In the state senate, he shepherded the Automatic Income Reduction Act, which guaranteed a tax rebate or credit to citizens whenever the general fund surplus exceeded certain levels. In just three years tens of millions of dollars were returned to Virginia taxpayers. Also in 1965, redistricting occurred as required by the Supreme Court decisions. Byrd&#x27;s former 24th senatorial district, which included the counties of Clarke, Frederick and Shenandoah, as well as the city of Winchester, became the 21st District, as Loudoun County was added.

Byrd&#x27;s father fell ill and announced his retirement from the U.S. Senate in November 1965. Governor Albertis S. Harrison Jr. appointed Harry Jr. to his father&#x27;s seat, Harry Jr. duly resigned from the state senate, and was sworn into the United States Senate on November 12, 1965.

== U.S. Senator==

Byrd sought the Democratic nomination in a special election in 1966 for the balance of his father&#x27;s sixth term. He faced a strong primary challenge from a longtime opponent of Massive Resistance, fellow state senator Armistead Boothe of Alexandria, fending it off by 8,225 votes–a margin of less than a percentage point. On the same day, two of his father&#x27;s longtime allies, Senator A. Willis Robertson and Congressman Howard W. Smith, were toppled by more liberal primary challengers. Although Harry Jr. easily won the general election in November, the 1966 primaries marked the beginning of the end for the Byrd Organization&#x27;s three-decade dominance of Virginia politics.

In 1970, Byrd broke with the Democratic Party and became an independent rather than sign an oath to support the party&#x27;s undetermined 1972 presidential nominee. He explained, &quot;The Democratic National Committee is within its rights to require such an oath. I do not contest this action. I cannot, and will not, sign an oath to vote for an individual whose identity I do not know and whose principles and policies are thus unknown. To sign such a blank check would be, I feel, the height of irresponsibility and unworthy of a member of the United States Senate... I would rather be a free man than a captive senator.&quot;

Byrd then ran for a full term in the Senate in 1970 as an independent, although both major parties nominated candidates. Widely popular in the state, Byrd was elected with a majority of 54 percent against both Democrat George C. Rawlings Jr. of Fredericksburg and Republican Ray L. Garland of Roanoke. Byrd thus became the first independent to win a statewide election in Virginia, and also the first independent to win a U.S. Senate seat by a majority vote. Byrd&#x27;s move is said to have influenced Virginia political power for more than twenty years.

In 1971, he authored the Byrd Amendment to the U.S. Federal Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act. It prohibited the US government from banning the importation of any strategic material from a non-communist country as long as the importation of the same materials from communist countries was also not prohibited. While it did not single out any particular country, it had the effect–intended by its sponsors–of creating an exception in the United States embargo of Rhodesia to enable the import of chromite ore from that country. Rhodesia, run by a mostly white minority government, was unrecognized internationally and under a United Nations-led trade boycott from 1965 following its Unilateral Declaration of Independence from Britain.

He continued to caucus with the Democrats, and was allowed to keep his seniority. However, like his father, Byrd had a very conservative voting record and was a strong supporter of federal fiscal discipline, as he had been at the state level. In fact he authored, and Congress passed, a floor amendment stating, &quot;Beginning with fiscal year 1981, the total budget outlays of the Federal Government should not exceed its receipts.&quot; Consistent with this fiscal policy, Byrd was a minimalist as a producer of legislation, believing less was more. Byrd was initially a supporter of the Vietnam War, but in September 1975, he cast the deciding Senate Armed Services Committee vote against the Ford administration&#x27;s request for emergency appropriations for South Vietnam and Cambodia, effectively ending U.S. support for the war. When chairman John C. Stennis, a supporter of the war, asked Byrd if he had intended to vote no, Byrd reportedly affirmed his vote and told Stennis &quot;They have lied to me long enough.&quot;

Byrd easily won reelection in 1976 against Democrat Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. He thereby became the first senator to win election and re-election as an independent. Unlike in 1970, the Republicans did not run a candidate that year and concentrated on carrying Virginia in the presidential election, which they did, for Gerald R. Ford Jr.

Byrd&#x27;s committee assignments in the senate included the Finance Committee and Armed Services Committee. Even as a senator, Byrd contributed regular editorial content to his newspapers, blending journalism and politics.

In a 1982 interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Byrd maintained that his earlier resistance to school desegregation, including the closure of schools, was justified and helped prevent racial violence.

Byrd did not run for reelection in 1982 and returned full-time to his home in Winchester; he and his father had held the &quot;Byrd seat&quot; in the Senate for fifty consecutive years. Byrd was succeeded by Congressman Paul S. Trible, who narrowly defeated the Democratic candidate, Richard J. Davis Jr. Trible served one term. 

==Retirement==

Even with his formal retirement from the Senate, Byrd retained his interest, and his independence, in politics; he endorsed Marshall Coleman, the Republican nominee for Governor of Virginia in 1989. He publicly supported Democratic Governor Mark Warner in the 2001 Virginia gubernatorial election, although Warner sought to raise taxes and faced conservative opposition. He endorsed Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election.

Byrd enjoyed retirement at his home in Winchester, &quot;Courtfield,&quot; and time spent with his nine grandchildren and later his twelve great-grandchildren. Byrd&#x27;s wife of 48 years, Gretchen, died in 1989. He continued to serve as chairman of the board of the &quot;Star&quot; for almost twenty years. In 2003 he was named to the Virginia Communications Hall of Fame. Byrd became a lecturer at Shenandoah University, and in 1984 the business program was renamed the Harry F. Byrd Jr. School of Business. His name was removed from the business school after a unanimous vote on June 10, 2020, due to the senator&#x27;s legacy as a civil rights opponent. In 2007 Byrd completed a literary work, &quot;Double Trouble: Vignettes From A Life of Politics and Newspapering&quot;. On October 20, 2009, with the death of retired U.S. Senator Clifford P. Hansen, a Wyoming Republican, Byrd became the oldest living former senator until his death at the age of 98.

Byrd appeared in the PBS special &quot;Chasing Churchill: In Search of My Grandfather&quot;, a show by Winston Churchill&#x27;s granddaughter, Celia Sandys, in which she travels the world retracing the steps of Churchill and meeting the people he used to know. Byrd recalled experiences he had when Churchill visited his family&#x27;s home in Virginia and stayed with them for a week.

==Death==
Byrd died of heart failure on July 30, 2013, at Courtfield, his home in Winchester, Virginia. At the time Byrd was the 8th oldest individual to have served in the Senate. A tribute published shortly thereafter observed that Byrd and his father &quot;shared a name, a tradition, many political views and an abiding love of Virginia. They also shared a character articulated ... by the late Sen. Everett Dirksen, Republican of Illinois: &#x27;There are gentle men in whom gentility finally destroys whatever of iron there was in their souls. There are iron men in whom the iron corroded whatever gentility they possessed. There are men—not many to be sure—in whom the gentility and the iron were preserved in proper balance, each of these attributes to be summoned up as the occasion requires. Such a man was Harry Byrd.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="728403" wikidata="Q4706072" url="?curid=728403" title="Alan Arakawa">
<text>Alan M. Arakawa (born 1951) is an American politician who served as the fifth and seventh mayor of the County of Maui in Hawaii.

==Education==
Arakawa graduated from Maui High School and attended the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa as a business major.

==Career==
In 1984, Arakawa entered civil service as a wastewater plant worker for Maui County and eventually was promoted to supervisor in the wastewater division of the Maui County Department of Public Works. Arakawa also represented labor unions, serving as a United Public Workers chief steward and a Hawaii Government Employees Association union representative. He served on the Maui County Council in 1994, 1996, and 2000.

===Elections===
====2002 mayoral election====
Arakawa first ran for mayor in 2002. After placing second in the September 21, 2002 primary behind former Maui mayor Kimo Apana, Arakawa won the general election with 20,887 votes (50.3%).

====2006 mayoral election====
In 2006, Arakawa ran for reelection. In the primaries he faced Apana again and city councilmember Charmaine Tavares, daughter of the late mayor Hannibal Tavares. In the primary, he trailed Tavares by about 100 votes. In the general election, he was defeated by Tavares.

====2010 mayoral election====
On June 18, 2010, Arakawa filed to run for the Mayor of Maui County. He placed second in the mayoral primary election on September 18, 2010. Incumbent mayor Charmaine Tavares narrowly won the primary election with 7,307 votes, or 25.4% of the total. She defeated Arakawa by just 268 votes. Arakawa earned 7,039 votes, or 24.4% of the vote. Arakawa won 23 of Maui&#x27;s 39 election precincts, mostly in South and West Maui, while Tavares won 11 precincts in Central Maui.

Both Tavares and Arakawa qualified for the 2010 mayoral general election on November 2, 2010. The race was a rematch of the 2006 mayoral election, in which incumbent mayor Arakawa was defeated by Tavares. In the final vote tally, Arakawa defeated Tavares with nearly 59% of the vote to her 41%.

====2014 mayoral election====
In the general election on November 4, 2014, Arakawa won reelection with 25,435 votes (55.3%) over Tam Paltin.

====2018 election====
In May 2017, Arakawa announced he would run for lieutenant governor of Hawaii. But in November 2017, he changed course and said he would instead run for his former seat on the Maui County Council representing Kahului.

In the August 11 primary, Arakawa received 11,790 votes, second to community organizer Natalie &quot;Tasha&quot; Kama&#x27;s 12,712 votes. Arakawa lost to Kama in the November 6 general election by nearly 11,000 votes.

==Personal life==
Arakawa is married to Ann Arakawa, assistant professor of mathematics at the University of Hawaiʻi Maui College. They have two daughters, Jan and Jodi.

<doc id="728406" wikidata="Q499475" url="?curid=728406" title="Orellana Province">
<text>Orellana () is an inland province of Ecuador. The capital is Puerto Francisco de Orellana (also known as Coca). It was created on July 30, 1998, from part of Napo Province.

The name of the province derives from the explorer Francisco de Orellana who it is told to have sailed from somewhere near the town to the Atlantic Ocean. He did this trip several times looking for the gold city of El Dorado and in search of a rumored Nutmeg forest which at the time was a very expensive spice. During his voyages he met a ferocious tribe of Indians who attacked his ships and many among them were women. This led to the naming of the river as the Amazon river.
The province is divided in four cantons.

== Cantons ==
The province is divided into four cantons. The following table lists each with its population at the 2001 census, its area in square kilometres (km²), and the name of the canton seat or capital.

==Demographics==
Ethnic groups as of the Ecuadorian census of 2010:
*Mestizo 57.5%
*Indigenous 31.8%
*Afro-Ecuadorian 4.9%
*White 4.4%
*Montubio 1.2%
*Other 0.2%

==Economy==
Jungle composes most of the province&#x27;s territory, forcing it to rely primarily on exports of crude oil, and timber. Its second most important source of income is tourism, offering jungle exploration, indigenous encounters, and rivers. Mining is the third reliable source of income.

<doc id="728411" wikidata="Q965009" url="?curid=728411" title="Jo Byrns">
<text>Joseph Wellington Byrns Sr. (July 20, 1869 – June 4, 1936) was a U.S. politician. He served as a 14-term Democratic congressman from Tennessee, and as the 41st speaker of the United States House of Representatives.

==Early life==
Byrns was born in Cedar Hill, Robertson County, Tennessee, son of James Henry Byrns and Mary Emily Jackson. He was named for a maternal uncle, Joseph William Green Jackson, who died in the American Civil War. His great-grandfather, James Byrns, Esq., figures in the legend of The Bell Witch, and is mentioned in the Authenticated History of The Bell Witch by Martin Van Buren Ingram. The Byrns family moved to Nashville in 1885 to pursue greater educational opportunities for their children. Jo Byrns attended Fogg High School, graduating in 1887. He then enrolled at Vanderbilt University, where he won honors in English and history, actively participated in debates, and became a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He graduated with a law degree in 1890 and soon began building up a successful law practice.

== Political career ==
Byrns displayed a strong early interest in politics and was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1894 and reelected in 1896 and 1898. In 1900 he was elected to the Tennessee State Senate.

In 1902, he ran for district attorney of Davidson County, Tennessee, but was defeated—his only unsuccessful political race in 18 efforts. In 1908, Byrns received the Democratic nomination for U.S. Representative and was elected in November of that year to a term beginning March 4, 1909. He served in the House for the rest of his life.

Byrns was widely respected and his influence grew as his seniority did. He was chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee from 1928 to 1935. In 1931 he was appointed chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee and in 1933 became House Majority Leader. In 1935 he became Speaker of the House.

Byrns suffered a serious heart attack at his Washington home on the evening of June 4, 1936. The Speaker died before he could be taken to a hospital. His funeral, attended by President Franklin Roosevelt and other dignitaries, was held in Nashville. He was interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville. His son Jo Byrns Jr. later served a single term in the House but never achieved the popularity of Jo Sr.

Byrns was also an active Civitan.

== Freemasonry ==
Byrns was a Freemason and member of the Grand Lodge of Tennessee. He served as the Worshipful Master of West Nashville Phoenix Lodge #131 in 1906 and 1907.

<text>Pastaza () is a province in the Oriente of Ecuador located in the eastern jungle. The capital is Puyo, founded on May 12, 1899, with a population of 33,325. The city is now accessible by paved roads, a recent development; the main road from Baños follows the Pastaza river into the province.

The Pastaza River surges into the province from the west and as the landscape flattens, meanders on to the Napo, a tributary of the Amazon. Natural resources of Pastaza are bananas, grapefruit, tobacco, cocoa and coffee. Tea has successfully been cultivated by a few British companies, and in the mid-1980s one of the companies was honored by a visit from Princess Margaret from the royal family of Britain.

The landscape is mostly mountainous in the western part of the province and becomes relatively flat toward the east as it nears the Peruvian border with rivers and plains characterizing most of the province. The highest elevation is 1,820 meters (5,970 ft). The climate is warm and humid due to the almost 7 meters of annual rainfall (22 feet) in the parts closest to the western mountains, but with significant amounts of rainfall throughout the province. The median temperature is 18 to 24 Celsius. It is rumored that there is much gold in the rivers of Pastaza; however, to date no significant discoveries of gold have been reported.

Snakes and other venomous creatures, such as tarantulas and scorpions, are common in the province. Travellers are advised to be cautious in any trekking through the jungles, parks and trails. Some of the snakes blend extremely well even in trees, so walking sticks and/or machetes are a good precaution for hiking.

The flora of the region is spectacular. A few local parks have been developed with myriad natural orchids from the area and admittance to these parks is relatively inexpensive. Rainy day gear is advised since the rains are present almost year-round, many times in the late afternoon, but occasional all day as well. The rain is quite warm compared to those in North America.

Pastaza is the largest province in Ecuador and the richest in biodiversity. To the north of Pastaza are the provinces Napo and Orellana, to the south is Morona Santiago, to the east is the country of Peru, and to the west are the provinces Tungurahua and Morona Santiago. The total population is about 83,930 inhabitants.

<doc id="728425" wikidata="Q499456" url="?curid=728425" title="Sucumbíos Province">
<text>Sucumbíos () is a province in northeast Ecuador. The capital and largest city is Nueva Loja (normally referred to as Lago Agrio). It is the fifth largest province in the country, with an area of 18,084 km2. In 2010, it had a population of 176,472 inhabitants.

== Geography ==
Sucumbíos is bounded on the north by Colombia, on the south by Napo and Orellana, on the west by Carchi and Imbabura, on the southwest by Pichincha, and on the east by Peru. Sucumbíos is the only province in Ecuador that borders two different countries.

The province is one of the six provinces in the Amazon Region, a natural region of Ecuador.

===Orography===

The western area of the province belongs to the Eastern Andes Mountains, where most rivers in the province have their sources. The most important elevation in the province is the Reventador, an active volcano. The eastern portion of the province is part of the Amazon Basin, with high temperatures.

===Hydrography===

The main river in the province is the Aguarico River. It passes close to Nueva Loja, and empties into the Napo, on the Peruvian border. Other important rivers are the Putumayo, which marks the border with Colombia, and the Coca and Napo Rivers, in the south.

== History ==

Sucumbíos was an unexplored area, where only indigenous people lived, until oil was discovered in its soil. In 1979, after nine years of foundation, Nueva Loja became the seat of its own canton, Lago Agrio Canton, in the Napo Province. On February 13, 1989, Sucumbíos became the 21st province in the country when it separated from Napo province.

== Economy ==

The most important natural resource in the province is oil, the Lago Agrio oil field. Thus, Sucumbíos is one of the most important provinces in the country, economically.

==Demographics==
Ethnic groups as of the Ecuadorian census of 2010:
*Mestizo 75.0%
*Indigenous 13.4%
*Afro-Ecuadorian 5.9%
*White 4.5%
*Montubio 1.0%
*Other 0.2%

== Political division ==
The province is divided into seven cantons. The following table lists each with its population at the 2001 census, its area in square kilometres (km2), and the name of the canton seat or capital.

<doc id="728429" wikidata="Q165706" url="?curid=728429" title="Rodion Shchedrin">
<text>Rodion Konstantinovich Shchedrin (; born 16 December 1932) is a Soviet and Russian composer and pianist, winner of USSR State Prize (1972), the Lenin Prize (1984), and the State Prize of the Russian Federation (1992), and is a former member of the Inter-regional Deputies Group (1989–1991). He is also a citizen of Lithuania and Spain.
==Biography==
Shchedrin was born in Moscow into a musical family — his father was a composer and teacher of music theory. He studied at the Moscow Choral School and Moscow Conservatory (graduating in 1955) under Yuri Shaporin (composition) and Yakov Flier (piano). He was married to ballerina Maya Plisetskaya from 1958 until her death in 2015.

Shchedrin&#x27;s early music is tonal and colourfully orchestrated and often includes snatches of folk music, while some later pieces use aleatoric and serial techniques.

Among his works are the ballets &quot;The Little Humpbacked Horse&quot; (1955), &quot;Carmen Suite&quot; (1973), &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1971, based on the novel by Leo Tolstoy), and &quot;Lady with a Lapdog&quot; (1985); the operas &quot;Not Only Love&quot; (1961), and &quot;Dead Souls&quot; (1976, after Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s novel); piano concertos, symphonies, chamber, and piano music and other works. He composed a set of 24 Preludes and Fugues after he heard those of Dmitri Shostakovich. Also notable is his &quot;Polyphonic Notebook&quot;.

He has written five concertos for orchestra. The first, its subtitle variously translated as &quot;Naughty Limericks&quot; or &quot;Mischievous Folk Ditties&quot; — neither of which completely get the gist of the Russian original which refers to a chastushka, an irreverent, satirical kind of folk song — is by far the best known, and was the work which first established his international reputation. The second of the concertos for orchestra was subtitled &quot;Zvony&quot; (The Chimes), and was premiered by the New York Philharmonic conducted by Leonard Bernstein as one of the many commissions in honor of the orchestra&#x27;s 125th anniversary. The third is based on old music of Russian provincial circuses. The fourth, &quot;Khorovody&quot; (round dances), was written in 1989, and the fifth, &quot;Four Russian Songs&quot;, was composed in 1998.

Shchedrin is also a virtuoso pianist and organist, playing solo piano in the premieres of the first three of his six piano concertos. On 5 May 1974, Shchedrin performed as soloist in all three of his then-completed piano concertos, and the concert, with the USSR Symphony Orchestra conducted by Yevgeny Svetlanov, was recorded and released on LP, then CD. He was made a member of the Berlin Academy of Arts in 1989 and received the Russian State Prize from Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1992. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Shchedrin has taken advantage of the new opportunities for international travel and musical collaboration, and now largely divides his time between Munich and Moscow.

From 11 to 14 June 2008, Shchedrin Days took place in Armenia with the participation of Shchedrin and Maya Plisetskaya as honorary guest. Invited by Walter Fink, he was the 19th composer to be featured in the annual Komponistenporträt of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 2009. He and his wife attended the concerts which included his Russian liturgy &quot;The Sealed Angel&quot; for choir and flute, performed in Eberbach Abbey. His chamber music included &quot;Ancient Melodies of Russian Folk Songs&quot; (2007) with the cellist Raphael Wallfisch and himself at the piano, and &quot;Meine Zeit, mein Raubtier&quot; with tenor Kenneth Tarver and pianist Roland Pontinen who performed it also at the Verbier Festival.

The premiere of a German version of his opera &quot;Lolita&quot; was performed as the opening night of the Internationale Maifestspiele Wiesbaden in a production of the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden in 2011.

<text>Tungurahua (, literally &quot;Province of the Tungurahua&quot;; ) is one of the twenty-four provinces of Ecuador. Its capital is Ambato. The province takes its name from the Tungurahua volcano, which is located within the boundaries of the provinces.

==Population==
In 2011, Tungurahua had an estimated population of 581,389.
Ethnic groups as of the Ecuadorian census of 2010:
*Mestizo 82.1%
*Indigenous 12.4%
*White 3.4%
*Afro-Ecuadorian 1.4%
*Montubio 0.5%
*Other 0.1%

==Climate==
The province has a dry, temperate climate. Like all mountainous areas, the region experiences the phenomenon known as microclimates, in which small portions of the province have drastically different conditions from others due to winds and area pressure.

Generally though, Tungurahua experiences temperatures between 14 and 17 degree Celsius in the day-time, with cooler nights. At higher altitudes, conditions are much colder. Despite the area being near the Equator, mountains such as Carihuayrazo and Chimborazo are covered in snow for much of the year.

==Geography==
The province is very mountainous, containing the Tungurahua volcano near Baños, as well as bordering the Carihuayrazo and Chimborazo volcanoes to the south. Baños attracts the highest number of tourists. The principal river of the province is the Patate River, which flows to the east toward the Amazon Region.

== Political division ==
The province is divided into nine cantons which stretch from Ambato in the west to Baños in the east. The following table lists each with its population at the 2001 census, its area in square kilometres (km2), and the name of the canton seat or capital.

<doc id="728434" wikidata="Q744670" url="?curid=728434" title="Zamora-Chinchipe Province">
<text>Zamora Chinchipe (), Province of Zamora Chinchipe is a province of the Republic
of Ecuador, located at the southeastern end of the Amazon Basin, which shares borders with the Ecuadorian provinces of Azuay and Morona Santiago to the north, Loja and Azuay to the west, and with Peru to the east and south. The province comprises an area of approximately 10,559 km² and is covered with a uniquely mountainous topography which markedly distinguishes it from the surrounding Amazonian provinces. Zamora-Chinchipe is characterized and largely identified by its mining industry; indigenous ethnic groups with a rich archaeological legacy; its biodiversity; and its niche and tourist attractions, which include a number of waterfalls well-noted for their beauty. The province takes its name from the bureaucratic fusion of the Zamora and Chinchipe cantons. The provincial capital is the city of Zamora.

== History ==

Human habitation in the region is thought to date to at least 4500 BCE, and was grounded in the Mayo-Chinchipe cultural complex. In approximately 1548, Spaniards made their first contact with the region&#x27;s indigenous people. On October 4, 1549, Hernando de Barahona, accompanied by Alonso de Mercadillo and Hernando de Benavente, founded the city of &quot;Zamora de los Alcaides&quot;. Fifty years after their arrival, the Spanish were driven from the city by the Shuar revolt. In 1850, the &quot;Zamora de los Alcaides&quot; city ruins were discovered by a group of colonists. It cannot be established exactly when the first white and mixed race settlers arrived in the province, but the oldest verifiable data shows that in the late 1840s, the Chinchipe River basin was already inhabited by people arriving from the Loja Province of modern Ecuador and Peru. The migration was also made from the Ecuadorian Province of Azuay to the Yacuambi Canton, where the Saraguros and mixed race people arrived. During the Spanish Colonial period, several explorers surveyed the territory, such as the French geographer and mathematician Charles Marie de La Condamine in a 1743 expedition. In 1781, the Spanish made a second attempt at colonization in the area, lured by the exploitation of gold deposits, but they found it impossible to dominate the natives.

The current settlement known as Zamora was not permanently reestablished by white and mixed race settlers until March 12, 1921, when the Catholic church founded the &quot;Apostolic Vicariate of Zamora&quot;, after many prior attempts at colonization, each repelled by the resistance of the Shuar people. In 1911, the Zamora parish became cantonal head of the Zamora Canton of the &quot;Provincia de Oriente&quot;. On December 15, 1920, the Santiago-Zamora Province was created. It consisted of the Chinchipe, Macas, Morona and Zamora cantons. The Chinchipe and Zamora cantons were each constituted by three parishes. On January 5, 1921, the Yacuambi Canton was created for the Santiago-Zamora Province.

On July 5, 1941, Ecuador was invaded by Peru, with part of the unpopulated territory of the province in contention. A ceasefire was brokered between the Foreign Ministers of Peru and Ecuador (with the participation of the United States, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina as &quot;guarantors&quot;) capped with the signing of the Rio Protocol. The treaty officially brought an end to the state of war which had existed between Ecuador and Peru, and left part of the Ecuadorian provinces of El Oro, Loja, and Zamora-Chinchipe under Peruvian occupation. After the 1941 war, forced migration of impoverished peasants and citizens to the province was accelerated by drought in Loja Province, resulting in colonization of many areas of the Zamora-Chinchipe territory which had been theretofore uninhabited. The creation of the Zamora-Chinchipe Province was a twelve-year process which was due, in large part, to the indefatigable efforts of one Benjamin Carrión, a citizen of the Ecuadorian province of Loja, and, on November 10, 1953, Zamora-Chinchipe was designated an autonomous province, being separated from the Santiago-Zamora Province by means of a legal term issued in the Ecuadorian Official Registry No. 360.

In 1981, the tensions with Peru were rekindled by a military confrontation over the Cenepa River in the Cordillera del Cóndor. The conflict was centered in the Paquisha, Mayaycu and Manchinaza localities. By 1995 the conflict had reemerged, and in 1999 the signing of the Peace Agreement between Ecuador and Peru settled the contours of Zamora-Chinchipe&#x27;s borders with its southern neighbor.

==Demographics==
Ethnic groups as of the Ecuadorian census of 2010:
*Mestizo 80.3%
*Indigenous 15.6%
*White 2.1%
*Afro-Ecuadorian 1.4%
*Montubio 0.2%
*Other 0.4%

<text>Donald E. Belfi (January 21, 1936 – February 26, 2020) was an American lawyer, judge, and politician in Nassau County, New York.

In 1994, he presided over the trial of Long Island Rail Road shooter Colin Ferguson.

==Early life==
Born in 1936 in Brooklyn, New York, Belfi gained his BA in English from Georgetown University in 1957 and Doctor of Jurisprudence from Fordham University School of Law in 1960. At Fordham, he was selected by New York County District Attorney Frank Hogan to join his office upon graduation, as part of the Honor&#x27;s Program.

==Career==
From 1960 to 1962, he served as an Assistant District Attorney in Manhattan, and from 1962 to 1974 he served as an Assistant District Attorney in Nassau County. In 1975, he was elected to the Nassau County District Court bench on the Republican and Conservative tickets. He was re-elected in 1980 on the Democratic, Republican, Conservative, and Liberal tickets. He was elected to the County Court of Nassau County in 1984, re-elected in 1994, and ran unsuccessfully for re-election in 2004 on the Republican and Conservative tickets. After leaving public service Belfi joined the Manhattan practice of Murray, Frank &amp; Sailer LLP as senior counsel.

At his retirement from the bench on 14 February 2005, Carolyn McCarthy paid tribute to him in the House of Representatives. McCarthy&#x27;s husband and son were both shot by Ferguson in 1994.

His voluntary activities included serving as commissioner of Rockville Centre Little League, and as a member of the Knights of Columbus, the Association for the Help of Retarded Children, and the St. Agnes Cathedral Parish Council. He also contributed over 20 years to Georgetown University as both an interviewer and a recruiter for the school. His honors included the Fraternal Order of Court Officers Bench and Bar Award, the Criminal Courts Bar Association&#x27;s Norman F. Lent Award, the Fordham Law Alumni Association Distinguished Alumnus Award, the DeStefano Industries Annual Award, and the Court Officer&#x27;s Benevolent Association of Nassau County Fidelis Juris Award.

<text>The Virginia Squires were a basketball team based in Norfolk, Virginia, and playing in several other Virginia cities. They were members of the American Basketball Association from 1970 to 1976.

The team originated in 1967 as the Oakland Oaks, an ABA charter franchise based in Oakland, California. They moved to Washington, D.C. as the Washington Caps in 1969 but moved to Norfolk the following year, becoming the Squires. As a regional team, they played home games in Richmond, Hampton, and Roanoke as well as a season with Norfolk. The team folded in 1976, just a month before the ABA–NBA merger commenced.

==In Oakland ==
The Squires were founded in 1967 as the Oakland Oaks, a charter member of the ABA. The team colors were green and gold. An earlier Oakland Oaks basketball team played in the American Basketball League (1961–62) in 1962. (The short-lived league folded on December 31, 1962.)

The Oaks were owned in part by pop singer Pat Boone. There was a major contract dispute with the cross-bay San Francisco Warriors of the established National Basketball Association over the rights to star player Rick Barry. He was a former NBA Rookie of the Year who had led the Warriors to the NBA finals in the same year the Oaks had formed, but due to being angered by management&#x27;s failure to pay him certain incentive awards he felt he was due, he sat out the 1967–68 season, and the following season he joined the Oaks, leading the franchise to its one and only ABA championship in 1969.

However, even with Barry the team proved to be a very poor investment for Boone and his co-owners. Despite winning the ABA championship, the Oaks were an abysmal failure at the box office, due in large part to the proximity of the NBA Warriors who at the time were also playing some home games in Oakland (and would eventually move to Oakland in 1971). At one point they only drew 2,500 fans per game.

==In Washington==

Facing foreclosure due to a major loan from the Bank of America, Boone sold the team to Washington, D.C. lawyer Earl Foreman, who moved the team to Washington for the 1969–70 season as the Washington Caps. The team colors of green and gold were retained, but the logo was a red, white and blue rendition of the United States Capitol. They played at the Washington Coliseum. However, for reasons that remain unknown, they remained in the Western Division—forcing them on the longest road trips in the league. Attendance was no better in Washington than it was in Oakland. The Coliseum had been built in 1941, and had not aged well. In a case of exceptionally bad timing, the Caps arrived at a time when the surrounding Near Northeast neighborhood was still recovering from the 1968 race riots. Fears that the neighborhood wasn&#x27;t safe dragged down attendance. They managed to finish four games above .500, but lost in the first round to the powerful Denver Rockets.

==In Virginia==
Merger talks with the NBA were already underway entering the 1970s, but a major stumbling block was the presence of the Caps in Washington. Baltimore Bullets owner Abe Pollin wanted to move his team to Washington, but did not want the Caps there. The other ABA owners persuaded Foreman to move the Caps for the second time in as many seasons. Foreman decided to make the Caps a regional franchise, the Virginia Squires. The name choice ultimately cost the team any goodwill it might have otherwise earned from Pollin, who viewed it as a brazen attempt to pry away the loyalties of fans in Northern Virginia who otherwise mostly support Washington sports teams, and ensured his enduring opposition to Virginia ever being admitted to the NBA in a merger (to the point where the first merger plan in 1971 sought to exclude the Squires franchise unless they moved to a new location instead).

The team would be based in Norfolk and played most of their games at the Norfolk Scope and the Old Dominion University Fieldhouse. They also played home games in Hampton at the Hampton Coliseum, in Richmond at the Richmond Coliseum, and in Roanoke at the Roanoke Civic Center. However, Roanoke was dropped from the list of &quot;home&quot; cities after only one season of play there. The Squires&#x27; colors were red, white, and blue.

Rick Barry, who originally played with the inaugural Oaks, appeared on the August 24, 1970 front cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in a Squires uniform; in the accompanying article inside the magazine, Barry made several negative remarks about the Commonwealth of Virginia. (He angered Southerners by remarking that he did not want his children to grow up saying, &quot;Hi, y&#x27;all, Dad.&quot;) On September 1, 1970, the Squires traded Barry to the New York Nets for a draft pick and $200,000 (though only officially got $25,000 out of the deal). While the negative comments had been a contributing factor to the trade, it primarily came because Foreman was still bogged down by financial troubles and had to sell Barry in order to help meet his expenses instead, with the ironic part being that Barry had previously mentioned being let go for a higher value than that by comparison in $100,000.

The Squires played most of their games at Old Dominion University&#x27;s fieldhouse in their first season as a &quot;regional&quot; franchise, with other matches at the Richmond Arena, Hampton Coliseum (which was named Hampton Roads Coliseum at the time), and Roanoke Civic Center. In spite of the initial controversy surrounding Barry, the Squires finished their inaugural season in Virginia by winning the Eastern Division by 11 games. They defeated the Nets in the first round of the ABA playoffs but went on to be upset by the Kentucky Colonels.

In 1971, the Squires made what would be their biggest draft pick ever by drafting Julius Erving from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. During the 1971–72 season, Erving became an instant sensation with his scoring prowess and dazzling on-court acrobatics; the Squires defeated The Floridians in the first round of the playoffs, but lost to the New York Nets in the second round.

The 1972–73 season marked the beginning of the end for the Squires. Although blessed with a combination of Julius Erving (&quot;Dr. J&quot;) and a young George Gervin, the duo only played together late in the season. The Squires lost to their division rivals out in Kentucky during the first round of the playoffs. During the summer of 1973, Dr. J was traded along with Willie Sojourner to the Nets for George Carter and cash.

During the 1974 ABA All-Star Weekend, rumors abounded that Gervin was about to be sold to the San Antonio Spurs. These rumors became fact on January 30, when the Squires sold Gervin to the Spurs for $225,000. ABA commissioner Mike Storen tried to block the sale on the grounds that selling the team&#x27;s last true star was not in the best interest of the league. However, the sale was eventually upheld.

While the trades may have provided enough short-term financing to help keep the Squires in business, the loss of so much talent that had been acquired by the franchise (primarily with fantastic draft choices) angered the fans. The Squires&#x27; attendance fell through the floor and never recovered. The Squires&#x27; final two seasons in the ABA were seen as absolutely forgettable with losses mounting up and long-time popular coach Al Bianchi eventually being fired. The 1974–75 and 1975–76 teams only won a total of 30 games, the worst winning percentages in ABA history. The team was coming unraveled off the court as well. In 1974, Barry Parkhill sued the team after his paychecks bounced. The Squires had nearly shut down for good in February 1976 and nearly forced the ABA to complete their season with only six teams instead, but they had only managed to stay afloat thanks to a sale of advertising banners combined with a $250,000 loan from a local bank.

As it turned out, this only bought the franchise three more months of life. On May 11, 1976 — only a month after the end of the regular season and two days before the end of the 1976 ABA Playoffs — the ABA canceled the franchise after it missed a $75,000 assessment period. The Squires had no chance of being included in any merger whatsoever. Notwithstanding the Squires&#x27; poor financial situation and Pollin&#x27;s continued opposition, the NBA considered regional franchises unviable, and none of Virginia&#x27;s cities was anywhere near large enough to support an NBA team on their own accord. Nevertheless, the Squires&#x27; premature contraction cost them a chance to be compensated as part of the merger, which closed only a month later.

<text>Brixton Academy (originally known as the Astoria Variety Cinema, previously known as Carling Academy Brixton, currently named O2 Academy Brixton as part of a sponsorship deal with the O2 brand) is a mid-sized concert venue located in South London, in the Lambeth district of Brixton.

Opening in 1929 as a cinema, the venue was converted into a discotheque in 1972, then reborn as a concert hall in 1983. It is owned by the Academy Music Group (AMG), and has become one of London&#x27;s leading music venues, hosting over 50 live albums, and winning the NME Best Venue 12 times since 1994. It has been home to several notable performances, including The Smiths&#x27; last gig (December 1986), Leftfield&#x27;s June 1996 concert which set a decibel record for a live gig at 137db, and Madonna&#x27;s gig in 2000, which was watched by an online audience of 9 million.

In December 2022, two people died and others were seriously injured following a crowd crush at the door. As a result the venue was closed, with reopening subject to meeting council licensing conditions. It reopened on 19 April 2024.

==History==
The venue started as a cinema and theatre in 1929 on the site of a private garden in Stockwell Road. Designed by the architects Thomas Somerford and E. A. Stone, it was built at a cost of £250,000 as an &quot;Astoria&quot; theatre. The opening show was the Al Jolson film &quot;The Singing Fool&quot;, followed by a variety act, including Heddle Nash and Derek Oldham which was broadcast by the BBC. It had nearly 3000 seats, although the publicity for the theatre reported this as 4500. The theatre eventually closed its doors as a cinema on 29 July 1972. It was then converted into a discotheque in September 1972, known as the &quot;Sundown Centre&quot;. The club was not a success and closed down some four months later. In May 1974 planning permission was sought to demolish the Grade II listed building and replace it with a motor showroom and petrol station. However, the redevelopment scheme was scrapped. The building was kept heated after it closed, and was used as an equipment store by the Rank Organisation.

In 1981, the venue was remodelled by Sean Treacy, who later ran the entire site services, was re-opened as a rock venue called &quot;Fair Deal&quot; with a concert by UB40 and an interior restoration. The Clash played the venue in 1982 on their Casbah Club tour (30 July) but the venue closed later that year due to debt. In 1983, Simon Parkes bought the venue for £1, and re-opened it as the Brixton Academy. The academy&#x27;s success steadily grew throughout the 1980s with numerous reggae productions and it was hired out to major rock and pop acts such as The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, Dire Straits and the Police for rehearsal. The venue was also used for video shoots for Wham! (Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go) and Culture Club. Parkes would go on to write a book about his experience of running the venue, &quot;Live At The Brixton Academy: A Riotous Life in the Music Business&quot;, which was published in 2014.

In 1995, Parkes sold the theatre to Break for the Border. Under its new ownership (McKenzie Group), reinvestment started immediately, with a complete £500,000 refurbishment of the Art Deco building frontage to its original grandeur, additional facilities both front of house and backstage and a capacity increase to just under 5,000. The venue is currently run by the Academy Music Group after a rebranding in August 2004 and hosts a range of live acts and club nights. With the sale, the venue&#x27;s title was changed to Carling Academy Brixton. In 2008, naming rights were purchased for £25.5 million by the O2 brand, owned by the Spanish telecommunications company Telefónica.

Being one of the biggest non-arena music venues in London, the academy has been used by many very successful acts. It has also been voted venue of the year 12 times since 1994 in the annual NME Awards. In addition the venue has won the Music Week Award for Venue of the Year several times including 2009.

=== 2022 Asake concert crush ===
A crowd crush outside a performance by Asake on 15 December 2022 seriously injured four people, two of whom died in the following days. &quot;The Guardian&quot; cast doubt on early reports that people were trying to force their way in without a ticket. The newspaper also questioned the management of the building and its entrances. As a result of the crowd crush, Lambeth councillors met in the early hours of 22 December 2022 and decided to suspend the academy&#x27;s operating licence following the &quot;severity of events&quot; and &quot;risks to public safety&quot; from &quot;a lack of crowd control at the front doors&quot;. The licence was suspended until a full hearing on 16 January 2023, when it was suspended for a further three months.

The BBC reported that security staff were said to accept bribes to allow people in without a ticket. In April 2023 the Metropolitan Police stated that they had no confidence in the holder of the venue&#x27;s licence and that they were applying for the licence to be revoked. In September 2023, the police stated that they were not opposed to the venue reopening, but simply opposed to AMG operating it.

On 15 September 2023 Lambeth Council announced that the venue was permitted to re-open after the incident, providing they meet new licensing conditions including strengthened doors, a new security contractor and additional safety procedures. A full list of the conditions is published online by Lambeth Council.

The venue reopened on 19 April 2024.

==Notable performances==
The Smiths played their last gig here in December 1986 which was an Anti-Apartheid benefit scheduled for the Royal Albert Hall but rearranged to the Brixton Academy due to Johnny Marr being involved in a car accident.

The Ramones played their final European show at the venue on February 3, 1996, before touring for the last time in South and North America.

Madonna played a special concert at the venue in 2000, to promote the release of her album, &quot;Music&quot;. The concert was broadcast live online and was watched by a record-breaking audience of 9 million.

Artists such as The Clash, Deborah Harry, The Prodigy, Arcade Fire, Nine Inch Nails and Bob Dylan have all played five consecutive nights at the venue. In 2002, Iron Maiden played three consecutive nights as a part of charity event &quot;Clive Aid 2002&quot;. The band set the record for merchandise and ticket sales. The Mighty Boosh broke this record in 2008, with their second live show &quot;Boosh Live&quot;, playing seven consecutive nights. The xx equalled their record in March 2017, playing seven consecutive nights in support of third record &quot;I See You&quot;, becoming the first music act to reach that number.

Leftfield set the world&#x27;s decibel record for a live concert in 1996 when they reached 137db. They were summarily banned from using the same sound system at the venue after the high bass levels started disintegrating the ceiling, resulting in showers of dust and plaster. They returned in 2000 using a different sound system.

<text>Pepper Schwartz (born May 11, 1945) is an American sexologist and sociologist teaching at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, United States. She is the author or co-author of numerous books, magazines, and website columns, and is a television personality on the subject of sexuality.

Schwartz is notable for her work in the 1970s and early 1980s that culminated in the book &quot;American Couples: Money-Work-Sex&quot;, which was co-written with Philip Blumstein and surveyed lesbian couples, gay male couples and heterosexual couples.

Schwartz also serves as the Love &amp; Relationship Expert &amp; Ambassador for AARP and writes the column The Naked Truth.

==Biography==
Schwartz was born in Chicago, Illinois, into a Jewish home, the daughter of Julius J., an attorney and his wife Gertrude Schwartz. She earned a BA and an MA from Washington University in St. Louis and an MA and PhD in sociology from Yale University in 1974. While a graduate student there, she co-authored with Janet Lever the 1971 book &quot;Women at Yale,&quot; documenting the first year of co-education at that university.

Schwartz wrote the column &quot;Sex and Health&quot; for &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine for seven years. She has appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show,&quot; &quot;Dateline,&quot; and &quot;Dr. Phil,&quot; as well as on programs for the cable television network Lifetime; she currently airs as one of the relationship “experts” on the reality television show &quot;Married at First Sight&quot;. She was the 2005 president of the Pacific Sociological Association, helped create the dating website Perfectmatch.com, and is a sexuality adviser for WebMD.

Schwartz is a past president of the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality and a charter member of the International Academy of Sex Research. The book jacket for her 2007 publication &quot;Prime: Adventures and Advice on Sex, Love, and the Sensual Years&quot; described her living &quot;in Washington State, being single after a 23 year marriage, and having two children in college&quot;.

Research by Schwartz and others surveying lesbian sexuality has generated debates because the surveys stated that lesbian couples in long-term relationships have less sex than their heterosexual or gay male counterparts. The phenomenon was labeled &quot;lesbian bed death&quot;. One factor in this debate concerns how &quot;sex&quot; acts were defined in surveys.

<text>The 22nd Seanad was in office from 2002 to 2007. An election to Seanad Éireann, the senate of the Oireachtas (Irish parliament), followed the 2002 general election to the 29th Dáil. The senators served until the close of poll for the 23rd Seanad, which was 23 July 2007 for panel members and 24 July 2007 for university members.

==Cathaoirleach==
Rory Kiely (FF) was elected as Cathaoirleach. This followed a vote of Fianna Fáil senators, in which Kiely was one of four candidates for nomination to the position.

On 13 September 2002, Paddy Burke (FG) was proposed as Leas-Chathaoirleach by Jim Higgins (FG) and seconded by Michael Finucane (FG). He was elected without a division.

== Composition of the 22nd Seanad ==
There are a total of 60 seats in the Seanad. 43 Senators are elected by the vocational panels, 6 elected by universities and 11 are nominated by the Taoiseach.

The following table shows the composition by party when the 22nd Seanad first met on 12 September 2002.

<doc id="728467" wikidata="Q776881" url="?curid=728467" title="Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia">
<text>Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler–Weber–Rendu disease and Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome, is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder that leads to abnormal blood vessel formation in the skin, mucous membranes, and often in organs such as the lungs, liver, and brain.

It may lead to nosebleeds, acute and chronic digestive tract bleeding, and various problems due to the involvement of other organs. Treatment focuses on reducing bleeding from telangiectasias, and sometimes surgery or other targeted interventions to remove arteriovenous malformations in organs. Chronic bleeding often requires iron supplements, iron infusions and sometimes blood transfusions. HHT is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, and occurs in one in 5,000–8,000 people in North America.

The disease carries the names of Sir William Osler, Henri Jules Louis Marie Rendu, and Frederick Parkes Weber, who described it in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==Signs and symptoms==

===Telangiectasias===

Telangiectasia (small vascular malformations) may occur in the skin and mucosal linings of the nose and gastrointestinal tract. The most common problem is nosebleeds (epistaxis), which happen frequently from childhood and affect about 90–95% of people with HHT. Lesions on the skin and in the mouth bleed less often but may be considered cosmetically displeasing; they affect about 80%. The skin lesions characteristically occur on the lips, the nose and the fingers, and on the skin of the face in sun-exposed areas. They appear suddenly, with the number increasing over time.

About 20% are affected by symptomatic digestive tract lesions, although a higher percentage have lesions that do not cause symptoms. These lesions may bleed intermittently, which is rarely significant enough to be noticed (in the form of bloody vomiting or black stool), but can eventually lead to depletion of iron in the body, resulting in iron-deficiency anemia.

===Arteriovenous malformation===

Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs, larger vascular malformations) occur in larger organs, predominantly the lungs (pulmonary AVMs) (50%), liver (30–70%) and the brain (cerebral AVMs, 10%), with a very small proportion (&lt;1%) of AVMs in the spinal cord.

Vascular malformations in the lungs may cause a number of problems. The lungs normally &quot;filter out&quot; bacteria and blood clots from the bloodstream; AVMs bypass the capillary network of the lungs and allow these to migrate to the brain, where bacteria may cause a brain abscess and blood clots may lead to stroke. HHT is the most common cause of lung AVMs: out of all people found to have lung AVMs, 70–80% are due to HHT. Bleeding from lung AVMs is relatively unusual, but may cause hemoptysis (coughing up blood) or hemothorax (blood accumulating in the chest cavity). Large vascular malformations in the lung allow oxygen-depleted blood from the right ventricle to bypass the alveoli, meaning that this blood does not have an opportunity to absorb fresh oxygen. This may lead to breathlessness. Large AVMs may lead to platypnea, difficulty in breathing that is more marked when sitting up compared to lying down; this probably reflects changes in blood flow associated with positioning. Very large AVMs cause a marked inability to absorb oxygen, which may be noted by cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the lips and skin), clubbing of the fingernails (often encountered in chronically low oxygen levels), and a humming noise over the affected part of the lung detectable by stethoscope.

The symptoms produced by AVMs in the liver depend on the type of abnormal connection that they form between blood vessels. If the connection is between arteries and veins, a large amount of blood bypasses the body&#x27;s organs, for which the heart compensates by increasing the cardiac output. Eventually congestive cardiac failure develops (&quot;high-output cardiac failure&quot;), with breathlessness and leg swelling among other problems. If the AVM creates a connection between the portal vein and the blood vessels of the liver, the result may be portal hypertension (increased portal vein pressure), in which collateral blood vessels form in the esophagus (esophageal varices), which may bleed violently; furthermore, the increased pressure may give rise to fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity (ascites). If the flow in the AVM is in the other direction, portal venous blood flows directly into the veins rather than running through the liver; this may lead to hepatic encephalopathy (confusion due to portal waste products irritating the brain). Rarely, the bile ducts are deprived of blood, leading to severe cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts). Liver AVMs are detectable in over 70% of people with HHT, but only 10% experience problems as a result.

In the brain, AVMs occasionally exert pressure, leading to headaches. They may also increase the risk of seizures, as would any abnormal tissue in the brain. Finally, hemorrhage from an AVM may lead to intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), which causes any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness in part of the body or difficulty speaking. If the bleeding occurs into the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid hemorrhage), there is usually a severe, sudden headache and decreased level of consciousness and often weakness in part of the body.

===Other problems===
A very small proportion (those affected by &quot;SMAD4&quot; (MADH4) mutations, see below) have multiple benign polyps in the large intestine, which may bleed or transform into colorectal cancer. A similarly small proportion experiences pulmonary hypertension, a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased, exerting pressure on the right side of the heart and causing peripheral edema (swelling of the legs), fainting and attacks of chest pain. It has been observed that the risk of thrombosis (particularly venous thrombosis, in the form of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) may be increased. There is a suspicion that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency and are therefore at a slightly increased risk from infections.

==Genetics==
HHT is a genetic disorder with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Those with HHT symptoms that have no relatives with the disease may have a new mutation. Homozygosity appears to be fatal in utero.

Five genetic types of HHT are recognized. Of these, three have been linked to particular genes, while the two remaining have currently only been associated with a particular locus. More than 80% of all cases of HHT are due to mutations in either &quot;ENG&quot; or &quot;ACVRL1&quot;. A total of over 600 different mutations are known. There is likely to be a predominance of either type in particular populations, but the data are conflicting. &quot;MADH4&quot; mutations, which cause colonic polyposis in addition to HHT, comprise about 2% of disease-causing mutations. Apart from &quot;MADH4&quot;, it is not clear whether mutations in &quot;ENG&quot; and &quot;ACVRL1&quot; lead to particular symptoms, although some reports suggest that &quot;ENG&quot; mutations are more likely to cause lung problems while &quot;ACVRL1&quot; mutations may cause more liver problems, and pulmonary hypertension may be a particular problem in people with &quot;ACVRL1&quot; mutations. People with exactly the same mutations may have different nature and severity of symptoms, suggesting that additional genes or other risk factors may determine the rate at which lesions develop; these have not yet been identified.

==Pathophysiology==

Telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations in HHT are thought to arise because of changes in angiogenesis, the development of blood vessels out of existing ones. The development of a new blood vessel requires the activation and migration of various types of cells, chiefly endothelium, smooth muscle and pericytes. The exact mechanism by which the HHT mutations influence this process is not yet clear, and it is likely that they disrupt a balance between pro- and antiangiogenic signals in blood vessels. The wall of telangiectasias is unusually friable, which explains the tendency of these lesions to bleed.

All genes known so far to be linked to HHT code for proteins in the TGF-β signaling pathway. This is a group of proteins that participates in signal transduction of hormones of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily (the transforming growth factor beta, bone morphogenetic protein and growth differentiation factor classes), specifically BMP9/GDF2 and BMP10. The hormones do not enter the cell but link to receptors on the cell membrane; these then activate other proteins, eventually influencing cellular behavior in a number of ways such as cellular survival, proliferation (increasing in number) and differentiation (becoming more specialized). For the hormone signal to be adequately transduced, a combination of proteins is needed: two each of two types of serine/threonine-specific kinase type membrane receptors and endoglin. When bound to the hormone, the type II receptor proteins phosphorylate (transfer phosphate) onto type I receptor proteins (of which Alk-1 is one), which in turn phosphorylate a complex of SMAD proteins (chiefly SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8). These bind to SMAD4 and migrate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the transcription of particular genes. In addition to the SMAD pathway, the membrane receptors also act on the MAPK pathway, which has additional actions on the behavior of cells. Both Alk-1 and endoglin are expressed predominantly in endothelium, perhaps explaining why HHT-causing mutations in these proteins lead predominantly to blood vessel problems. Both &quot;ENG&quot; and &quot;ACVRL1&quot; mutations lead predominantly to underproduction of the related proteins, rather than misfunctioning of the proteins.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnostic tests may be conducted for various reasons. Firstly, some tests are needed to confirm or refute the diagnosis. Secondly, some are needed to identify any potential complications.

===Telangiectasias===

The skin and oral cavity telangiectasias are visually identifiable on physical examination, and similarly the lesions in the nose may be seen on endoscopy of the nasopharynx or on laryngoscopy. The severity of nosebleeds may be quantified objectively using a grid-like questionnaire in which the number of nosebleed episodes and their duration is recorded.

Digestive tract telangiectasias may be identified on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach and first part of the small intestine). This procedure will typically only be undertaken if there is anemia that is more marked than expected by the severity of nosebleeds, or if there is evidence of severe bleeding (vomiting blood, black stools). If the number of lesions seen on endoscopy is unexpectedly low, the remainder of the small intestine may be examined with capsule endoscopy, in which the patient swallows a capsule-shaped device containing a miniature camera which transmits images of the digestive tract to a portable digital recorder.

===Arteriovenous malformations===
Identification of AVMs requires detailed medical imaging of the organs most commonly affected by these lesions. Not all AVMs cause symptoms or are at risk of doing so, and hence there is a degree of variation between specialists as to whether such investigations would be performed, and by which modality; often, decisions on this issue are reached together with the patient.

Lung AVMs may be suspected because of the abnormal appearance of the lungs on a chest X-ray, or hypoxia (low oxygen levels) on pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas determination. Bubble contrast echocardiography (bubble echo) may be used as a screening tool to identify abnormal connections between the lung arteries and veins. This involves the injection of agitated saline into a vein, followed by ultrasound-based imaging of the heart. Normally, the lungs remove small air bubbles from the circulation, and they are therefore only seen in the right atrium and the right ventricle. If an AVM is present, bubbles appear in the left atrium and left ventricle, usually 3–10 cardiac cycles after the right side; this is slower than in heart defects, in which there are direct connections between the right and left side of the heart. A larger number of bubbles is more likely to indicate the presence of an AVM. Bubble echo is not a perfect screening tool as it can miss smaller AVMs and does not identify the site of AVMs. Often contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT angiography) is used to identify lung lesions; this modality has a sensitivity of over 90%. It may be possible to omit contrast administration on modern CT scanners. Echocardiography is also used if there is a suspicion of pulmonary hypertension or high-output cardiac failure due to large liver lesions, sometimes followed by cardiac catheterization to measure the pressures inside the various chambers of the heart.
Liver AVMs may be suspected because of abnormal liver function tests in the blood, because the symptoms of heart failure develop, or because of jaundice or other symptoms of liver dysfunction. The most reliable initial screening test is Doppler ultrasonography of the liver; this has a very high sensitivity for identifying vascular lesions in the liver. If necessary, contrast-enhanced CT may be used to further characterize AVMs. It is extremely common to find incidental nodules on liver scans, most commonly due to focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), as these are a hundredfold times more common in HHT compared to the general population. FNH is regarded as harmless. Generally, tumor markers and additional imaging modalities are used to differentiate between FNH and malignant tumors of the liver. Liver biopsy is discouraged in people with HHT as the risk of hemorrhage from liver AVMs may be significant. Liver scans may be useful if someone is suspected of HHT, but does not meet the criteria (see below) unless liver lesions can be demonstrated.

Brain AVMs may be detected on computed tomography angiography (CTA or CT angio) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA); CTA is better in showing the vessels themselves, and MRA provides more detail about the relationship between an AVM and surrounding brain tissue. In general, MRI is recommended. Various types of vascular malformations may be encountered: AVMs, micro-AVMs, telangiectasias and arteriovenous fistulas. If surgery, embolization, or other treatment is contemplated (see below), cerebral angiography may be required to get sufficient detail of the vessels. This procedure carries a small risk of stroke (0.5%) and is therefore limited to specific circumstances. Recent professional guidelines recommend that all children with suspected or definite HHT undergo a brain MRI early in life to identify AVMs that can cause major complications. Others suggest that screening for cerebral AVMs is probably unnecessary in those who are not experiencing any neurological symptoms, because most lesions discovered on screening scans would not require treatment, creating undesirable conundrums.

===Genetic testing===
Genetic tests are available for the &quot;ENG&quot;, &quot;ACVRL1&quot; and &quot;MADH4&quot; mutations. Testing is not always needed for diagnosis, because the symptoms are sufficient to distinguish the disease from other diagnoses. There are situations in which testing can be particularly useful. Firstly, children and young adults with a parent with definite HHT may have limited symptoms, yet be at risk from some of the complications mentioned above; if the mutation is known in the affected parent, absence of this mutation in the child would prevent the need for screening tests. Furthermore, genetic testing may confirm the diagnosis in those with limited symptoms who otherwise would have been labeled &quot;possible HHT&quot; (see below).

Genetic diagnosis in HHT is difficult, as mutations occur in numerous different locations in the linked genes, without particular mutations being highly frequent (as opposed to, for instance, the ΔF508 mutation in cystic fibrosis). Sequence analysis of the involved genes is therefore the most useful approach (sensitivity 75%), followed by additional testing to detect large deletions and duplications (additional 10%). Not all mutations in these genes have been linked with disease.

Mutations in the &quot;MADH4&quot; gene is usually associated with juvenile polyposis, and detection of such a mutation would indicate a need to screen the patient and affected relatives for polyps and tumors of the large intestine.

===Criteria===
The diagnosis can be made depending on the presence of four criteria, known as the &quot;Curaçao criteria&quot;. If three or four are met, a patient has &quot;definite HHT&quot;, while two gives &quot;possible HHT&quot;:
# Spontaneous recurrent epistaxis
# Multiple telangiectasias in typical locations (see above)
# Proven visceral AVM (lung, liver, brain, spine)
# First-degree family member with HHT

Despite the designation &quot;possible&quot;, someone with a visceral AVM and a family history but no nosebleeds or telangiectasias is still extremely likely to have HHT, because these AVMs are very uncommon in the general population. At the same time, the same cannot be said of nosebleeds and sparse telangiectasias, both of which occur in people without HHT, in the absence of AVMs. Someone&#x27;s diagnostic status may change in the course of life, as young children may not yet exhibit all the symptoms; at age 16, thirteen percent are still indeterminate, while at age 60 the vast majority (99%) have a definite diagnostic classification. The children of established HHT patients may therefore be labeled as &quot;possible HHT&quot;, as 50% may turn out to have HHT in the course of their life.

==Treatment==
Treatment of HHT is symptomatic (it deals with the symptoms rather than the disease itself), as there is no therapy that stops the development of telangiectasias and AVMs directly. Furthermore, some treatments are applied to prevent the development of common complications. Chronic nosebleeds and digestive tract bleeding can both lead to anemia; if the bleeding itself cannot be completely stopped, the anemia requires treatment with iron supplements. Those who cannot tolerate iron tablets or solutions may require administration of intravenous iron, and blood transfusion if the anemia is causing severe symptoms that warrant rapid improvement of the blood count.

Most treatments used in HHT have been described in adults, and the experience in treating children is more limited. Women with HHT who get pregnant are at an increased risk of complications, and are observed closely, although the absolute risk is still low (1%).

===Nosebleeds===
An acute nosebleed may be managed with a variety of measures, such as packing of the nasal cavity with absorbent swabs or gels. Removal of the packs after the bleeding may lead to reopening of the fragile vessels, and therefore lubricated or atraumatic packing is recommended. Some patients may wish to learn packing themselves to deal with nosebleeds without having to resort to medical help.

Frequent nosebleeds can be prevented in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities has been used to prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and heart disease in women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce the bleeding from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent septal perforations and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (detergent such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. This is the same procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.
It may be possible to embolize vascular lesions through interventional radiology; this requires passing a catheter through a large artery and locating the maxillary artery under X-ray guidance, followed by the injection into the vessel of particles that occlude the blood vessels. The benefit from the procedure tends to be short-lived, and it may be most appropriate in episodes of severe bleeding.

To more effectively minimize recurrence and severity of epistaxis, other options may be used in conjunction with therapies listed above. Intravenously administered anti-VEGF substances such as bevacizumab (brand name Avastin), pazopinab, and thalidomide or its derivatives (lenolidomide, pomalidomide) interfere with the production of new blood vessels that are weak and therefore prone to bleeding. Because thalidomide is a teratogen, thalidomide is considered by many to be a last resort therapy, and additionally can cause neuropathy, which can be mitigated by titrating dosages or prescribing thalidomide derivatives such as lenolidomide and pomalidomide. Pomalidomide causes a significant, clinically relevant reduction in epistaxis severity and improvement in quality of life. Nevertheless, many doctors prefer alternative VEGF inhibitors; eg bevacizumab nasal spray also significantly reduces epistaxis severity without side effects.

If other interventions have failed, several operations have been reported to provide benefit. One is septal dermoplasty or Saunders&#x27; procedure, in which skin is transplanted into the nostrils, and the other is Young&#x27;s procedure, in which the nostrils are sealed off completely.

===Skin and digestive tract===
The skin lesions of HHT can be disfiguring, and may respond to treatment with long-pulsed . Skin lesions in the fingertips may sometimes bleed and cause pain. Skin grafting is occasionally needed to treat this problem.

With regards to digestive tract lesions, mild bleeding and mild resultant anemia is treated with iron supplementation, and no specific treatment is administered. There is limited data on hormone treatment and tranexamic acid to reduce bleeding and anemia. Severe anemia or episodes of severe bleeding are treated with endoscopic argon plasma coagulation (APC) or laser treatment of any lesions identified; this may reduce the need for supportive treatment. The expected benefits are not such that repeated attempts at treating lesions are advocated. Sudden, very severe bleeding is unusual—if encountered, alternative causes (such as a peptic ulcer) need to be considered—but embolization may be used in such instances.

===Lung AVMs===
Lung lesions, once identified, are usually treated to prevent episodes of bleeding and more importantly embolism to the brain. This is particularly done in lesions with a feeding blood vessel of 3 mm or larger, as these are the most likely to cause long-term complications unless treated. The most effective current therapy is embolization with detachable metal coils or plugs. The procedure involves puncture of a large vein (usually under a general anesthetic), followed by advancing of a catheter through the right ventricle and into the pulmonary artery, after which radiocontrast is injected to visualize the AVMs (pulmonary angiography). Once the lesion has been identified, coils are deployed that obstruct the blood flow and allow the lesion to regress. In experienced hands, the procedure tends to be very effective and with limited side effects, but lesions may recur and further attempts may be required. CTA scans are repeated to monitor for recurrence. Surgical excision has now essentially been abandoned due to the success of embolotherapy.

Those with either definite pulmonary AVMs or an abnormal contrast echocardiogram with no clearly visible lesions are deemed to be at risk from brain emboli. They are therefore counselled to avoid scuba diving, during which small air bubbles may form in the bloodstream that may migrate to the brain and cause stroke. Similarly, antimicrobial prophylaxis is advised during procedures in which bacteria may enter the bloodstream, such as dental work, and avoidance of air bubbles during intravenous therapy.

===Liver AVMs===
Given that liver AVMs generally cause high-output cardiac failure, the emphasis is on treating this with diuretics to reduce the circulating blood volume, restriction of salt and fluid intake, and antiarrhythmic agents in case of irregular heart beat. This may be sufficient in treating the symptoms of swelling and breathlessness. If this treatment is not effective or leads to side effects or complications, the only remaining option is liver transplantation. This is reserved for those with severe symptoms, as it carries a mortality of about 10%, but leads to good results if successful. The exact point at which liver transplantion is to be offered is not yet completely established. Embolization treatment has been attempted, but leads to severe complications in a proportion of patients and is discouraged.

Other liver-related complications (portal hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy) are treated with the same modalities as used in cirrhosis, although the use of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt treatment is discouraged due to the lack of documented benefit.

===Brain AVMs===
The decision to treat brain arteriovenous malformations depends on the symptoms that they cause (such as seizures or headaches). The bleeding risk is predicted by previous episodes of hemorrhage, and whether on the CTA or MRA scan the AVM appears to be deep-seated or have deep venous drainage. Size of the AVM and the presence of aneurysms appears to matter less. In HHT, some lesions (high-flow arteriovenous fistulae) tend to cause more problems, and treatment is warranted. Other AVMs may regress over time without intervention. Various modalities are available, depending on the location of the AVM and its size: surgery, radiation-based treatment and embolization. Sometimes, multiple modalities are used on the same lesion.

Surgery (by craniotomy, open brain surgery) may be offered based on the risks of treatment as determined by the Spetzler–Martin scale (grade I-V); this score is higher in larger lesions that are close to important brain structures and have deep venous drainage. High grade lesions (IV and V) have an unacceptably high risk and surgery is not typically offered in those cases. Radiosurgery (using targeted radiation therapy such as by a gamma knife) may be used if the lesion is small but close to vital structures. Finally, embolization may be used on small lesions that have only a single feeding vessel.

===Experimental treatments===
Several anti-angiogenesis drugs approved for other conditions, such as cancer, have been investigated in small clinical trials. The anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab, for instance, has been used off-label in several studies. In a large clinical trial, bevacizumab infusion was associated with a decrease in cardiac output and reduced duration and number of episodes of epistaxis in treated HHT patients. Thalidomide, another anti-angiogenesis drug, was also reported to have beneficial effects in HHT patients. Thalidomide treatment was found to induce vessel maturation in an experimental mouse model of HHT and to reduce the severity and frequency of nosebleeds in the majority of a small group of HHT patients. The blood hemoglobin levels of these treated patients rose as a result of reduced hemorrhage and enhanced blood vessel stabilization.

==Epidemiology==

Population studies from numerous areas in the world have shown that HHT occurs at roughly the same rate in almost all populations: somewhere around 1 in 5000. In some areas, it is much more common; for instance, in the French region of Haut Jura the rate is 1:2351 - twice as common as in other populations. This has been attributed to a founder effect, in which a population descending from a small number of ancestors has a high rate of a particular genetic trait because one of these ancestors harbored this trait. In Haut Jura, this has been shown to be the result of a particular &quot;ACVRL1&quot; mutation (named c.1112dupG or c.1112_1113insG). The highest rate of HHT is 1:1331, reported in Bonaire and Curaçao, two islands in the Caribbean belonging to the Netherlands Antilles.

Most people with HHT have a normal lifespan. The skin lesions and nosebleeds tend to develop during childhood. AVMs are probably present from birth, but don&#x27;t necessarily cause any symptoms. Frequent nosebleeds are the most common symptom and can significantly affect quality of life.

==History==
Several 19th century English physicians, starting with Henry Gawen Sutton (1836–1891) and followed by Benjamin Guy Babington (1794–1866) and John Wickham Legg (1843–1921), described the most common features of HHT, particularly the recurrent nosebleeds and the hereditary nature of the disease. The French physician Henri Jules Louis Marie Rendu (1844–1902) observed the skin and mucosal lesions, and distinguished the condition from hemophilia. The Canadian-born Sir William Osler (1849–1919), then at Johns Hopkins Hospital and later at Oxford University, made further contributions with a 1901 report in which he described characteristic lesions in the digestive tract. The English physician Frederick Parkes Weber (1863–1962) reported further on the condition in 1907 with a series of cases. The term &quot;hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia&quot; was first used by the American physician Frederic M. Hanes (1883–1946) in a 1909 article on the condition.

The diagnosis of HHT remained a clinical one until the genetic defects that cause HHT were identified by a research group at Duke University Medical Center, in 1994 and 1996 respectively. In 2000, the international scientific advisory committee of cureHHT formerly called the HHT Foundation International published the now widely used Curaçao criteria. In 2006, a group of international experts met in Canada and formulated an evidence-based guideline, sponsored by cureHHT. This guideline has since been updated in 2020 and can be found here.

<text>Submission wrestling, also known as submission grappling, submission fighting, or simply grappling, is a martial art and combat sport that focuses on ground fighting and submission techniques. It is a hybrid discipline that incorporates elements of various martial arts such as various wrestling styles, judo, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Submission wrestling is practiced both as a competitive sport and as a training method for self-defence and mixed martial arts (MMA).

== Background ==
In ancient Greece, pankration emerged as a popular combat sport around the 7th century BCE. Pankration combined striking and grappling techniques, including joint locks and chokes, and was even included in the Olympic Games. In Japan, jujutsu became prominent in the 17th century. Jujutsu focused on using an opponent&#x27;s energy against them and included techniques like joint locks, throws, and pins.

Jigoro Kano later developed Judo in the late 19th century, incorporating many grappling techniques from jujutsu, Judo influenced the development of various grappling styles around the world in particular Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Other styles of submission grappling also emerged, such as freestyle wrestling and sambo in the Soviet Union, which blended elements of Judo and traditional wrestling. All of these grappling arts contributed to the development of submission wrestling.

== Generic term ==
Some Mixed martial arts schools and fighters may use the term &quot;submission wrestling&quot; to refer to their grappling methods while avoiding association with any one particular martial art. The label is sometimes also used to describe the tactic in mixed martial arts competition of relying primarily upon submission wrestling skills to defeat an opponent.

The term &quot;no-gi&quot; usually refers to a form of competition and training that does not use the gi, the &quot;combat kimono&quot; worn in traditional martial arts. &quot;No-gi Brazilian jiu-jitsu&quot; is often used as a synonymous of submission wrestling in some circles, thanks to this art being a primarily ground fighting and submission seeking fighting style.

== Objective ==
In submission wrestling, the primary objective is to force an opponent to submit through the application of joint locks, chokes, or other submission holds. Unlike freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling, which often involve pinning an opponent&#x27;s shoulders to the ground for victory, submission wrestling emphasises techniques that can lead to a submission such as tapping out or verbally submitting.

Submission wrestling competitions, often referred to as no-gi, grappling tournaments or submission-only events, can vary in rulesets. Some competitions allow competitors to use strikes, while others focus solely on grappling techniques. Points may be awarded for takedowns, dominant positions, and near-submissions. However, the ultimate goal is to secure a submission, which ends the match.

== Styles ==
* Catch wrestling: Also called &quot;catch-as-catch-can&quot;, the style of grappling (without the gi) originated in Lancashire, Northern England and later became the dominant wrestling style in America during the 19th century, has experienced a resurgence during recent years due to MMA popularity. Early professional wrestling was once competitive catch wrestling before the sport slowly transitioned to sportive entertainment during the mid-1920s, with amateur catch wrestling becoming Olympic freestyle and collegiate wrestling.
* Judo: A Japanese martial art focusing on high-impact throws, pins, joint locks, and chokes. It is also an Olympic sport, practiced wearing the &quot;&quot;, but has been adapted to submission wrestling purposes.
* Japanese ju-jutsu or jujutsu: An ancient art of Japanese wrestling/grappling that places a heavy emphasis on joint locks, chokes, and throws. Uses a &quot;gi&quot; traditionally.
* Sport sambo: A Soviet (Russian) style of grappling that typically uses a jacket, but without &quot;gi&quot; pants. Sambo uses leglocks, but most styles do not permit chokes.
* Brazilian jiu-jitsu: An increasingly popular martial art with primary emphasis on ground grappling. It involves training with and without a &quot;gi&quot;.
* Luta livre esportiva (pt): A Brazilian form of submission wrestling adapted from catch wrestling, trained without a &quot;gi&quot;.
* Malla-yuddha: One of the oldest practiced forms of submission/combat wrestling, originating in pre-partition India, malla-yuddha is divided into four parent techniques, each named after particular Hindu gods and legendary fighters: Hanumanti concentrates on technical and positional superiority, Jambuvanti uses locks and holds to force the opponent into submission, Jarasandhi concentrates on breaking the limbs and joints and applying tracheal chokes while Bhimaseni focuses on sheer strength.
* Pehlwani: The premier wrestling style of South Asia. It is descended from Malla-yuddha and the Persian varzesh-e bastani.
* Pankration: Originating from ancient Greece, it combines elements that today are found mainly in the punches of boxing (&quot;pygmachia&quot;) and in the kicking of many martial arts (&quot;laktisma&quot;) with moves from the also Greece-originating wrestling (pale) and joint locks, thus creating a broad fighting sport similar to today&#x27;s mixed martial arts.
* 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu: An American hybrid of no-&quot;gi&quot; Brazilian jiu-jitsu founded by Eddie Bravo, influences from American folkstyle wrestling and Jean Jacques Machado&#x27;s (a grappler with several missing digits) style of BJJ. More focus on no-gi half-guard and guard techniques that may be considered unorthodox in BJJ.
* Shoot wrestling: A Japanese martial art (without the &quot;gi&quot;) based on catch wrestling, freestyle wrestling, and Greco-Roman wrestling, which later incorporated judo, sambo, karate, and Muay Thai. The major sub-disciplines of shoot wrestling are Shooto and shootfighting, along with Combat Wrestling.
** Shooto: A Japanese martial art consisting of catch wrestling, judo, jujutsu, sambo, and kickboxing developed by professional wrestler Satoru Sayama.
** Shootfighting: A Japanese martial art consisting of Muay Thai and catch wrestling.
** Combat wrestling (ja): A style of shoot wrestling founded by elite wrestler and MMA coach Noriaki Kiguchi (ja).
* Shuai jiao: A Chinese style of wrestling that incorporates throws and &quot;chin na&quot; (joint locks).

== Hybrid styles ==

=== Combat Jiu-Jitsu ===

Combat Jiu-Jitsu (CJJ) is a submission grappling style innovated by American BJJ black belt Eddie Bravo in 2013. Following the success of his Eddie Bravo Invitational (EBI) events, Bravo decided to create a martial art aimed for self-defense that could also be used in competition. Inspired from Pancrase matches as well as from the original Gracie Challenge.

CJJ incorporates No-Gi BJJ techniques while adding open palm strikes allowing competitors to strike each other on the ground to open up the defense, CJJ matches are won by submission within the regulation period, or a winner is determined by EBI overtime rules.

First ran as competitive matches during his invitational events, starting with EBI 11 in 2017, the first Combat Jiu-Jitsu World event took place in 2018. Since then, multiple world champions have been crowned and the first team world championship took place at the end of 2022.

=== Combat Submission Wrestling ===

Combat Submission Wrestling (CSW) is a modern form of submission wrestling (and MMA system) developed by Erik Paulson, former Shooto light heavyweight champion.
It includes grappling, submissions, and striking.
It is a style that borrows elements and techniques from grappling styles including catch wrestling, Shooto, judo, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu along with striking styles such as boxing, kickboxing, and Muay Thai.

=== Hayastan Wrestling ===

Hayastan Grappling System or Hayastan Freestyle Wrestling, is a submission grappling style developed by multiple grappling black belts Gokor Chivichyan and Gene LeBell that blends elements of judo, sambo, catch wrestling, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling.
This system includes all forms of submissions, including leg locks, footlocks, kneebars, heel hooks, shoulder locks, wrist locks, neck cranks, body cranks, chokes and others.

===American Jiu-Jitsu===
American Jiu-Jitsu is a combination of wrestling and Brazilian jiu-jitsu developed in the US. The first person who was associated with this term was MMA fighter Jake Shields, who stated that it was an &quot;Americanized&quot; form of BJJ.
In 2019, Keenan Cornelius, a BJJ black belt from San Diego, founded his personal academy that he named Legion American Jiu-Jitsu (AJJ).
After that, he started to explain the style to the media, which caused a backlash from the Brazilian community, although Cornelius continued promoting his academy.

<text>Twist is an unincorporated community in Cross County, Arkansas, United States. Twist was named after a nearby plantation of the same name.

Twist was mentioned in the B.B. King song &quot;Lucille&quot; as the location of a club where he once played. It was at this club in Twist where two men started a fight over a woman named Lucille which set the place on fire. Because of this incident, King named his famous guitar Lucille.

The blues musician Little Mack Simmons (1933–2000) was born in Twist.

<doc id="728480" wikidata="Q3643648" url="?curid=728480" title="Kampfbund">
<text>The Kampfbund (&quot;Battle-league&quot;) was a league of nationalist fighting societies and the German National Socialist Party in Bavaria, Germany, in the 1920s. It included Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Party (NSDAP) and its &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), the Oberland League and the &quot;Bund Reichskriegsflagge&quot;. Hitler was its political leader, while Hermann Kriebel led its militia.

The league was created on 1–2 September 1923 at Nuremberg, where Hitler joined other nationalist leaders to celebrate Sedantag, which marked the anniversary of the Prussian victory over France in 1870. The purpose was to consolidate and streamline their agendas and also prepare to take advantage of the split between Bavaria and the central government. The impetus for this consolidation was the declaration a few days earlier by the Berlin central government announcing the end to the resistance against the French occupation of the Ruhr, whose apparent capitulation infuriated the nationalists and freebooters. The &quot;Kampfbund&quot; conducted the Beer Hall Putsch of November 1923 in Munich, Germany.

==Member affiliations==
By this time, the German Workers&#x27; Party (DAP) had changed its name to the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (NSDAP). It had grown from a fringe sect to Bavaria&#x27;s most powerful political force of 70,000 members. By 1923, the SA was the Nazi Party&#x27;s private army with about 15,000 members. A subgroup of the NSDAP was the &quot;Stoßtrupp-Hitler&quot;, a personal bodyguard unit for Hitler under the command of Joseph Berchtold. Another group was the Party&#x27;s youth group &quot;Jungsturm Adolf Hitler&quot; led by Adolf Lenk.

The Oberland League was a paramilitary organization led by Friedrich Weber. It had 4,000 armed troops, practically all disgruntled war veterans. This unit was a &quot;Freikorps&quot; unit.

The &quot;Bund Reichskriegsflagge&quot; (Imperial War Flag Society) was another private army which had many war veterans, as well. The official leader was Joseph Seydel but Ernst Röhm was really in control.

==Putsch planning==

On 26 September 1923, following a period of turmoil and political violence, Bavarian Prime Minister Eugen von Knilling declared a state of emergency and Gustav von Kahr was appointed &quot;,&quot; or state commissioner, with dictatorial powers to govern the state. In addition to von Kahr, Bavarian state police chief Colonel Hans Ritter von Seisser and Reichswehr General Otto von Lossow formed a ruling triumvirate. Hitler announced that he would hold 14 mass meetings beginning on 27 September 1923. Afraid of the potential disruption, one of Kahr&#x27;s first actions was to ban the announced meetings. Hitler was under pressure to act. The Nazis, with other leaders in the &quot;Kampfbund,&quot; felt they had to march upon Berlin and seize power or their followers would turn to the Communists. Meanwhile, on 5 October 1923 Kahr closed the Nazi paper &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; for ten days. Kahr also announced a surprise speech at the &quot;Bürgerbräu Keller&quot;.

The putsch was inspired by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s successful March on Rome, from 22 to 29 October 1922. Hitler and his associates planned to use Munich as a base for a march against Germany&#x27;s Weimar Republic government. Hitler came to the realization that Kahr sought to control him and was not ready to act against the government in Berlin. Hitler wanted to seize a critical moment for successful popular agitation and support.

The putsch was planned on 7 November in a hasty decision in Kriebel&#x27;s apartment. Not all members were notified. For the purpose of communicating, the party used two pieces of paper; one colored red meaning &quot;the real thing&quot; and the other white signifying a practice run. They chose to pass the white tag out. At the time of the putsch, only 2000 members of the &quot;Kampfbund&quot; were in Munich. On 8 November 1923, the putsch went forward, but failed.

<doc id="728481" wikidata="Q744030" url="?curid=728481" title="Transit of Mercury from Mars">
<text>A [[astronomical transit|transit]] of Mercury across the Sun as seen from Mars takes place when the planet Mercury passes directly between the Sun and Mars, obscuring a small part of the Sun&#x27;s disc for an observer on Mars. During a transit, Mercury can be seen from Mars as a small black disc moving across the face of the Sun.

Transits of Mercury from Mars are roughly twice as common as transits of Mercury from Earth: there are several per decade.

==Transit==
The Mars rovers &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot; could have observed the transit of January 12, 2005 (from 14:45 UTC to 23:05 UTC); however the only camera available for this had insufficient resolution. They were able to observe transits of Deimos across the Sun, but at 2&#x27; angular diameter, Deimos is about 20 times larger than Mercury&#x27;s 6.1&quot; angular diameter. Ephemeris data generated by JPL Horizons indicates that &quot;Opportunity&quot; would have been able to observe the transit from the start until local sunset at about 19:23 UTC, while &quot;Spirit&quot; could have observed it from local sunrise at about 19:38 UTC until the end of the transit. The rover Curiosity observed the Mercury transit of June 3, 2014, marking the first time any planetary transit has been observed from a celestial body besides Earth.
March 5, 2024: NASA released images of transits of the moon Deimos, the moon Phobos and the planet Mercury as viewed by the &quot;Perseverance&quot; rover on the planet Mars.


The Mercury-Mars synodic period is 100.888 days. It can be calculated using the formula 1/(1/P-1/Q), where P is the orbital period of Mercury (87.969 days) and Q is the orbital period of Mars (686.98 days).

The inclination of Mercury&#x27;s orbit with respect to that of Mars is 5.16°, which is less than its value of 7.00° with respect to Earth&#x27;s ecliptic.

==Simultaneous transits==
The simultaneous occurrence of a transit of Mercury and a transit of Venus is extremely rare, but somewhat more frequent than from Earth, and will next occur in the years ,  and .
On several occasions a related event is predicted: a transit of Mercury and a transit of Venus, or transit of Earth, will follow themselves, one after the other, in an interval of only several hours.

On November 28, 3867, there will be a transit of Earth and Moon, and two days later there will be a transit of Mercury.
On January 16, 18551, transits of Mercury and Venus will occur 14 hours apart.

<text>A pie chart (or a circle chart) is a circular statistical graphic which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion. In a pie chart, the arc length of each slice (and consequently its central angle and area) is proportional to the quantity it represents. While it is named for its resemblance to a pie which has been sliced, there are variations on the way it can be presented. The earliest known pie chart is generally credited to William Playfair&#x27;s &quot;Statistical Breviary&quot; of 1801.

Pie charts are very widely used in the business world and the mass media. However, they have been criticized, and many experts recommend avoiding them, as research has shown it is difficult to compare different sections of a given pie chart, or to compare data across different pie charts. Pie charts can be replaced in most cases by other plots such as the bar chart, box plot, dot plot, etc.

==History==
The earliest known pie chart is generally credited to William Playfair&#x27;s &quot;Statistical Breviary&quot; of 1801, in which two such graphs are used. Playfair presented an illustration, which contained a series of pie charts. One of those charts depicted the proportions of the Turkish Empire located in Asia, Europe and Africa before 1789. This invention was not widely used at first.

Playfair thought that pie charts were in need of a third dimension to add additional information.

Florence Nightingale may not have invented the pie chart, but she adapted it to make it more readable, which fostered its wide use, still today. Nightingale reconfigured the pie chart making the length of the wedges variable instead of their width. The graph, then, resembled a cock&#x27;s comb. She was later assumed to have created it due to the obscurity and lack of practicality of Playfair&#x27;s creation. Nightingale&#x27;s polar area diagram, or occasionally the Nightingale rose diagram, equivalent to a modern circular histogram, to illustrate seasonal sources of patient mortality in the military field hospital she managed, was published in Notes on Matters Affecting the Health, Efficiency, and Hospital Administration of the British Army and sent to Queen Victoria in 1858. According to the historian Hugh Small, &quot;she may have been the first to use [pie charts] for persuading people of the need for change.&quot;

The French engineer Charles Joseph Minard also used pie charts, in 1858. A map of his from 1858 used pie charts to represent the cattle sent from all around France for consumption in Paris.

==Variants and similar charts==

===3D pie chart and perspective pie cake===

A 3D pie chart, or perspective pie chart, is used to give the chart a 3D look. Often used for aesthetic reasons, the third dimension does not improve the reading of the data; on the contrary, these plots are difficult to interpret because of the distorted effect of perspective associated with the third dimension. The use of superfluous dimensions not used to display the data of interest is discouraged for charts in general, not only for pie charts.

===Doughnut chart===

A doughnut chart (also spelled donut) is a variant of the pie chart, with a blank center allowing for additional information about the data as a whole to be included.
 Doughnut charts are similar to pie charts in that their aim is to illustrate proportions. This type of circular graph can support multiple statistics at once and it provides a better data intensity ratio to standard pie charts. It does not have to contain information in the center.

===Exploded pie chart===
A chart with one or more sectors separated from the rest of the disk is known as an &quot;exploded pie chart&quot;. This effect is used to either highlight a sector, or to highlight smaller segments of the chart with small proportions.

===Polar area diagram===
The polar area diagram is similar to a usual pie chart, except sectors have equal angles and differ rather in how far each sector extends from the center of the circle.
The polar area diagram is used to plot cyclic phenomena (e.g., counts of deaths by month).
For example, if the counts of deaths in each month for a year are to be plotted then there will be 12 sectors (one per month) all with the same angle of 30 degrees each. The radius of each sector would be proportional to the square root of the death rate for the month, so the area of a sector represents the rate of deaths in a month.
If the death rate in each month is subdivided by cause of death, it is possible to make multiple comparisons on one diagram, as is seen in the polar area diagram famously developed by Florence Nightingale.

The first known use of polar area diagrams was by André-Michel Guerry, which he called (circular curves), in an 1829 paper showing seasonal and daily variation in wind direction over the year and births and deaths by hour of the day. Léon Lalanne later used a polar diagram to show the frequency of wind directions around compass points in 1843. The wind rose is still used by meteorologists. Nightingale published her rose diagram in 1858. Although the name &quot;coxcomb&quot; has come to be associated with this type of diagram, Nightingale originally used the term to refer to the publication in which this diagram first appeared—an attention-getting book of charts and tables—rather than to this specific type of diagram.

===Ring chart, sunburst chart, and multilevel pie chart===

A ring chart, also known as a sunburst chart or a multilevel pie chart, is used to visualize hierarchical data, depicted by concentric circles. The circle in the center represents the root node, with the hierarchy moving outward from the center. A segment of the inner circle bears a hierarchical relationship to those segments of the outer circle which lie within the angular sweep of the parent segment.

===Spie chart===

A variant of the polar area chart is the spie chart, designed by Dror Feitelson.
The design superimposes a normal pie chart with a modified polar area chart to permit the comparison of two sets of related data. 
The base pie chart represents the first data set in the usual way, with different slice sizes. The second set is represented by the superimposed polar area chart, using the same angles as the base, and adjusting the radii to fit the data. For example, the base pie chart could show the distribution of age and gender groups in a population, and the overlay their representation among road casualties. Age and gender groups that are especially susceptible to being involved in accidents then stand out as slices that extend beyond the original pie chart.

=== Square chart / Waffle chart===

Square charts, also called waffle charts, are a form of pie charts that use squares instead of circles to represent percentages. Similar to basic circular pie charts, square pie charts take each percentage out of a total 100%. They are often 10 by 10 grids, where each cell represents 1%. Despite the name, circles, pictograms (such as of people), and other shapes may be used instead of squares. One major benefit to square charts is that smaller percentages, difficult to see on traditional pie charts, can be easily depicted.

==Example==

The following example chart is based on preliminary results of the election for the European Parliament in 2004. The table lists the number of seats allocated to each party group, along with the derived percentage of the total that they each make up. The values in the last column, the derived central angle of each sector, is found by taking that percentage of 360.
*Because of rounding, these totals do not add up to 100 and 360.

The size of each central angle is proportional to the size of the corresponding quantity, here the number of seats. Since the sum of the central angles has to be 360°, the central angle for a quantity that is a fraction &quot;Q&quot; of the total is 360&quot;Q&quot; degrees.
In the example, the central angle for the largest group (European People&#x27;s Party (EPP)) is 135.7° because 0.377 times 360, rounded to one decimal place, equals 135.7.

==Use and effectiveness==

A flaw exhibited by pie charts is that they cannot show more than a few values without separating the visual encoding (the “slices”) from the data they represent (typically percentages). When slices become too small, pie charts have to rely on colors, textures or arrows so the reader can understand them. This makes them unsuitable for use with larger amounts of data. Pie charts also take up a larger amount of space on the page compared to the more flexible bar charts, which do not need to have separate legends, and can display other values such as averages or targets at the same time.

Statisticians generally regard pie charts as a poor method of displaying information, and they are uncommon in scientific literature. One reason is that it is more difficult for comparisons to be made between the size of items in a chart when area is used instead of length and when different items are shown as different shapes.
Further, in research performed at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, it was shown that comparison by angle was less accurate than comparison by length. Most subjects have difficulty ordering the slices in the pie chart by size; when an equivalent bar chart is used the comparison is much easier. Similarly, comparisons between data sets are easier using the bar chart. However, if the goal is to compare a given category (a slice of the pie) with the total (the whole pie) in a single chart and the multiple is close to 25 or 50 percent, then a pie chart can often be more effective than a bar graph.
In a pie chart with many section, several values may be represented with the same or similar colors, making interpretation difficult.
Several studies presented at the &quot;European Visualization Conference&quot; analyzed the relative accuracy of several pie chart formats, reaching the conclusion that pie charts and doughnut charts produce similar error levels when reading them, and square pie charts provide the most accurate reading.

<doc id="728503" wikidata="Q4454977" url="?curid=728503" title="Leslie Scarman, Baron Scarman">
<text>Leslie George Scarman, Baron Scarman, (29 July 1911 – 8 December 2004) was an English judge and barrister who served as a Law Lord until his retirement in 1986. He was described as an &quot;outstanding judicial figure, entrusted with the most high-profile inquiries and marked by his integrity&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Scarman was born in Streatham but grew up on the border of Sussex and Surrey. He won scholarships to Radley College and then Brasenose College, Oxford, where he read Classics, graduating in 1932 with a double first.

==Legal career==
He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1936. He remained briefless until World War II, which he spent in the Royal Air Force as a staff officer in England, North Africa, and then continental Europe. He was present with Arthur Tedder when Alfred Jodl surrendered at Reims. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1944. He returned to law in 1945, practising from chambers at 2, Crown Office Row, known since the 1970s as Fountain Court Chambers, and in the late 1940s and early 1950s he started to build the chambers&#x27; reputation for commercial litigation, together with Alan Orr and Melford Stevenson, supported by a notable clerk, Cyril Batchelor. He became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1957.

Scarman was appointed a High Court judge in 1961, assigned to the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division, transferring to the Family Division when the latter was created in 1971. On his appointment he received the customary knighthood. He joined the Court of Appeal in 1973, and was sworn of the Privy Council. On 30 September 1977, Scarman was made a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, becoming Baron Scarman, &quot;of Quatt in the County of Salop&quot;. He served in the Lords until his retirement in 1986.

He was appointed head of the Law Commission from 1965 to 1973, during which time 27 commission-inspired statutes were made law. As a judge, Scarman&#x27;s career had some controversial decisions. Although widely regarded as a liberal, he upheld the blasphemy conviction of &quot;Gay News&quot; (1979), punctured the GLC&#x27;s &quot;Fares Fair&quot; low-cost public transport policy (1981) and supported the banning of trade unions at GCHQ (1985).

He presided over the 1972 inquiry into the Northern Ireland riots of August 1969 and the public inquiry on the causes of the race riots in Brixton in 1981. He also chaired the Red Lion Square disorders (1975) and the Grunwick dispute (1977) inquiries.

==Later life==
After entering the House of Lords the more liberal aspects of his character dominated: he was chancellor of the University of Warwick and president of the British Institute of Human Rights, and worked on behalf of the Prince&#x27;s Trust, the Birmingham Six and Charter 88. Scarman was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1983. In 1991 he set up the Scarman Trust aimed at helping young people from deprived communities.

==Personal life and death==
He married Ruth Wright in 1947, with whom he had one son. He died in 2004 at his home in Westgate-on-Sea.

<text>Terich Mir (also spelled Terichmir, Tirich Mir and Turch Mir) is the highest mountain of the Hindu Kush range, and the highest mountain in the world outside of the Himalayas–Karakoram range, at above sea level. It is located in the Chitral District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.

It’s the 33rd highest peak in the world. The first recorded ascent of the mountain was on 21 July 1950 by a Norwegian-British expedition consisting of Arne Næss, P. Kvernberg, H. Berg, and Tony Streather, depicted in the documentary film &quot;Tirich Mir til topps&quot;. Tirich Mir overlooks the town of Chitral, and can be easily seen from the main bazaar. 

It is the highest mountain in the province of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa. In fact, it is the highest mountain of Pakistan outside the Gilgit-Baltistan region. 

The last village situated in Chitral District before the mountain begins is the village of Tirich. This valley begins at Soorwaht, where Tirich River meets Torkhow River from the west, up to Shagrom—the last permanent settlement of the valley. From that point onwards, there are summertime grazing pastures and shepherd huts leading up to the snout of the lower Tirich glacier, which goes further up to Tirich Concordia, where glaciers from seven sub-valleys slide down and join at the Concordia glacial confluence.

It is believed the origin of the name Tirich Mir is &quot;King of Tirich&quot; as Tirich is the name of a side valley of the Mulkhow valley of Chitral which leads up to Tirich Mir. An alternative etymology derives this name from the Wakhi language. In Wakhi, &quot;trich&quot; means shadow or darkness and &quot;mir&quot; means king, so Tirich Mir means king of darkness. It could have gotten this name as it creates long shadows on the Wakhan side of its face.

== Royalty-free access in 2024-25 ==
To commemorate the 75th anniversary of Tirich Mir’s first ascent and encourage visitors to the region, the Pakistani authorities have announced free permits in 2024-5 for both climbing and trekking Tirich Mir. 

==Climate==

The weather station above sea level lies in the Tundra climate/Alpine climate (ET) zone according to Köppen Climate Classification. On this specific altitude ( asl) we find moderately cold winters and cool summers generally above freezing. Annual mean temperature is , which puts the station well inside the range of continuous permafrost. The average temperature in the coldest month of January is and the two hottest months of July and August have mean temperatures of . Average low temperatures range from in January to in July and August. The summit has an Ice cap climate (EF) where no month has an average temperature above .

==Folklore==
According to the polytheist Kalash people who live nearby, this mountain is the domain of the goddess Krumai. She appears in the form of a wild goat, and she is associated with childbirth. In one legend, she disturbed the other gods, and was chased by Imra, who threw her into a fast river. Krumai jumped up the river and ran up the cliff, causing the cliff&#x27;s shape with her hooves. She revealed her true form and prepared a feast for the other gods, and they accepted her into their pantheon.

The Chitrali people, who are Muslim, instead believe that this mountain is the home of fairies and their fortress. No one may climb it, as doing so will bring death to the trespasser. These mountain fairies are known as &quot;Bohtan Doyak&quot;, the &quot;stone throwers&quot;.

<doc id="728513" wikidata="Q484" url="?curid=728513" title="Laziness">
<text>Laziness (also known as indolence or sloth) is emotional disinclination to activity or exertion despite having the ability to act or to
exert oneself. It is often used as a pejorative; terms for a person seen to be lazy
include &quot;couch potato&quot;, &quot;slacker&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. Related concepts include &quot;sloth&quot;, a Christian sin, &quot;abulia&quot;, a medical term for reduced motivation, and &quot;lethargy&quot;, a state of lacking energy.

Despite the famed neurologist Sigmund Freud&#x27;s discussion of the &quot;pleasure principle&quot;, Leonard Carmichael noted in 1954 that &quot;laziness&quot; is not a word that appears in the table of contents of most technical books on psychology&quot;. A 1931 survey found high-school students more likely to attribute their failing performance to laziness, while teachers ranked &quot;lack of ability&quot; as the major cause, with laziness coming in second. Laziness should not be confused with avolition, a negative symptom of certain mental and neurodevelopmental disorders such as depression, ADHD, ASD, sleep disorders, substance use disorders and schizophrenia.

==Psychology==
Laziness may reflect a lack of self-esteem, a lack of positive recognition by others, a lack of discipline stemming from low self-confidence, or a lack of interest in the activity or belief in its efficacy. Laziness may manifest as procrastination or vacillation. Studies of motivation suggest that laziness may be caused by a decreased level of motivation, lack of interest, and confidence which in turn can be caused by over-stimulation or excessive impulses or distractions. These increase the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter responsible for reward and pleasure. The more dopamine that is released, the greater intolerance one has for valuing and accepting productive and rewarding action. This desensitization leads to dulling of the neural patterns and affects negatively the anterior insula of the brain responsible for risk perception.

ADHD specialists say engaging in multiple activities can cause behavioral problems such as attention/focus failure, perfectionism, and pessimism. In these circumstances, laziness can manifest as a negative coping mechanism (aversion), the desire to avoid certain situations to counter certain experiences, and preconceived ill results. Lacanian thought says &quot;laziness is the &quot;acting out&quot; of archetypes from societal programming and negative child-rearing practices.&quot; Thomas Goetz, University of Konstanz, Germany, and John Eastwood, York University, Canada, concur that aversive states such as laziness can be equally adaptive for making change and toxic if allowed to fester. An outlook found to be helpful in their studies is &quot;being mindful and not looking for ways out of it, simultaneously to be also open to creative and active options if they should arise.&quot; They point out that a relentless engaging in activities without breaks can cause oscillations of failure, which may result in mental health issues. 

It has also been shown that laziness can render one apathetic to reactant mental health issues such as anger, anxiety, indifference, substance abuse, and depression.

===Related concepts===
==Economics==
Economists have differing views of laziness. Frédéric Bastiat argues that idleness is the result of people focusing on the pleasant immediate effects of their actions rather than potentially more positive long-term consequences. Others note that humans seem to have a tendency to seek after leisure. Hal Cranmer writes, &quot;For all these arguments against laziness, it is amazing we work so hard to achieve it. Even those hard-working Puritans were willing to break their backs every day in exchange for an eternity of lying around on a cloud and playing the harp. Every industry is trying to do its part to give its customers more leisure time.&quot; Ludwig von Mises writes, &quot;The expenditure of labor is deemed painful. Not to work is considered a state of affairs more satisfactory than working. Leisure is, other things being equal, preferred to travail (work). People work only when they value the return of labor higher than the decrease in satisfaction brought about by the curtailment of leisure. To work involves disutility.&quot;

==Literary==
Laziness in American literature is figured as a fundamental problem with social and spiritual consequences. In 1612 John Smith in his &quot;A Map of Virginia&quot; is seen using a jeremiad to address idleness. In the 1750s this sort of advocating reached its apex in literature. David Bertelson in &quot;The Lazy South&quot; (1767) expressed this as a substitution of &quot;spiritual industry&quot; over &quot;patriotic industry&quot;. Writers like William Byrd went to a great extent and censured North Carolina as land of lubbers. Thomas Jefferson in his &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; (1785) acknowledges a small portion of the people have only seen labor and identifies the cause of this indolence to the rise of &quot;slave-holding&quot; society. Jefferson raised his concerns what this deleterious system will bring to the economic system. Later by the 1800s the rise of Romanticism changed attitudes of the society, values of work were re-written; stigmatization of idleness was overthrown with glamorous notions. John Pendleton Kennedy was a prominent writer in romanticizing sloth and slavery: in &quot;Swallow Barn&quot; (1832) he equated idleness and its flow as living in oneness with nature. Mark Twain in &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; (1885) contrasts realist and romantic perspective of &quot;laziness&quot; and calls attention to the essential convention of aimlessness and transcendence that connects the character. In 20th century the poor whites were portrayed in the grotesque caricatures of early southern laziness. In Flannery O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s &quot;Wise Blood&quot; (1952) and &quot;Good Country People&quot; (1955) she depicts spiritual backwardness as the cause for disinclination to work. The lack of any social function which could be valued equally with a luxurious lifestyle was closely portrayed through lives of displaced aristocrats and their indolence. Jason Compson, Robert Penn Warren and William Styron were some of the writers who explored this perspective. The lack of meaningful work was defined as a void which aristocrats needed to fill with pompous culture; Walker Percy is a writer who has thoroughly mined the subject. Percy&#x27;s characters are often exposed to the emptiness (spiritual sloth) of contemporary life, and come to rectify it with renewed spiritual resources.

==Religion==

===Christianity===

One of the Catholic seven deadly sins is sloth, which is often defined as spiritual and/or physical apathy or laziness. Sloth is discouraged in and 2 Thessalonians, and associated with wickedness in one of the parables of Jesus in the &quot;Gospel of Matthew&quot; (). In the Wisdom books of &quot;Proverbs&quot; and &quot;Ecclesiastes&quot;, it is stated that laziness can lead to poverty (, ). According to Peter Binsfeld&#x27;s &quot;Binsfeld&#x27;s Classification of Demons&quot;, Belphegor is thought to be its chief demon.

===Islam===
The Arabic term used in the Quran for laziness, inactivity and sluggishness is كَسَل (&quot;kasal&quot;). The opposite of laziness is Jihad al-Nafs, i.e. the struggle against the self, against one&#x27;s own ego. Among the five pillars of Islam, praying five times a day and fasting during Ramaḍān are part of actions against laziness.

===Buddhism===

In Buddhism, the term &quot;kausīdya&quot; is commonly translated as &quot;laziness&quot; or &quot;spiritual sloth&quot;. &quot;Kausīdya&quot; is defined as clinging to unwholesome activities such as lying down and stretching out, procrastinating, and not being enthusiastic about or engaging in virtuous activity.

== In selected societies ==

=== Southern United States ===
From 1909 to 1915, the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hookworm Disease sought to eradicate hookworm infestation from 11 southern U.S. states. Hookworms were popularly known as &quot;the germ of laziness&quot; because they produced listlessness and weakness in the people they infested. Hookworms infested 40 percent of southerners and were identified in the North as the cause of the South&#x27;s alleged backwardness.

=== Indonesia ===
It was alleged that indolence was the reason for backward conditions in Indonesia, such as the failure to implement Green Revolution agricultural methods. But a counter-argument is that the Indonesians, living very precariously, sought to play it safe by not risking a failed crop, given that not all experiments introduced by outsiders had been successful.

==Animals==
It is common for animals (even those like hummingbirds that have high energy needs) to forage for food until satiated, and then spend most of their time doing nothing, or at least nothing in particular. They seek to &quot;satisfice&quot; their needs rather than obtaining an optimal diet or habitat. Even diurnal animals, which have a limited amount of daylight in which to accomplish their tasks, follow this pattern. Social activity comes in a distant third to eating and resting for foraging animals. When more time must be spent foraging, animals are more likely to sacrifice time spent on aggressive behavior than time spent resting. Extremely efficient predators have more free time and thus often appear more lazy than relatively inept predators that have little free time. Beetles likewise seem to forage lazily due to a lack of foraging competitors. On the other hand, some animals, such as pigeons and rats, seem to prefer to respond for food rather than eat equally available &quot;free food&quot; in some conditions.

<text>Waterloo Maple Inc. is a Canadian software company, headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario. It operates under the trade name Maplesoft. It is best known as the manufacturer of the Maple computer algebra system, and MapleSim physical modeling and simulation software.

==Corporate history==
Waterloo Maple Inc. was first incorporated under the name Waterloo Maple Software in April 1988 by Keith Geddes and Gaston Gonnet, who were both then professors in the Symbolic Computation Group, a part of the computer science department (now the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science) at the University of Waterloo.

Tim Bray served as the part-time CEO of Waterloo Maple Inc. from 1989-1990. During this period he claims in his resume that he helped save the company from one close encounter with bankruptcy by &quot;instituting financial discipline&quot;.

Gonnet left the company in 1994 after a failed attempt to purchase a controlling stake despite already owning 30% of the shares, and following protracted disagreements over the management of the company sold his remaining share in 2001.

On April 20, 1998, Waterloo Maple Inc. announced its relocation to Seagram Museum in Waterloo, which was itself the former location of the original Seagram distillery.

On March 3, 2003, Waterloo Maple Inc. announced the immediate introduction of the name Maplesoft as its primary business name.

On May 27, 2003, Maplesoft announced relocating its headquarters to Waterloo Tech Campus at 615 Kumpf Drive, North Waterloo, and expected to begin operation at the relocated site on 2003-09-02.

On July 16, 2008, Maplesoft announced Cybernet Systems Taiwan was appointed as a Maplesoft Reseller for the Commercial and Government markets.

On July 30, 2009, Maplesoft announced it has signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by Cybernet Systems Co., Ltd. In 2009-07-31, Cybernet Systems Co., Ltd. announced its acquisitions of all outstanding shares of Waterloo Maple Inc., with transaction to be executed via Cybernet Holdings CANADA, Inc, with consolidation to be completed by 2009-09-01. As a result of this acquisition, 10% of the workforce at the time (Around a dozen workers) lost their jobs.

On June 26, 2012, Maplesoft announced its entry to Modelica-based professional consulting services, which included model development and simulation services, analysis and tool development, real-time plant-model code generation, and training.

In June 2018, Maplesoft announced that it was spinning off its Möbius and Maple T.A. products to a new, independent company called DigitalEd.

On December 19, 2018, Maplesoft announced that Dr. Laurent Bernardin, COO and Chief Scientist has been appointed as new CEO and President of Maplesoft effective January 1, 2019. Dr. Bernardin succeeds former CEO, Jim Cooper who has moved to become the full-time CEO of DigitalEd, a company Maplesoft spun-off in early 2018. Dr. Bernardin was a student at ETH and was supervised by Prof. Gaston Gonnet, co-founder of Maplesoft.

<text>The Territorial Building is a government building of the Territory of Hawaii.

==Description==
The building is located at 465 South King Street in downtown Honolulu, Hawaii.
The Territorial Building was designed by the architect Arthur Reynolds, in the Classical Revival architectural style. Building started in 1925 and was finished in 1926. A four-story tower sits atop a two-story base, with decoration only in the public areas. The front includes a large stairway with double landings, with massive columns for decoration. The central lobby has a leaded glass dome depicting the seal of Hawaii.
It is also called Kekuanaoa Building after the royal politician Mataio Kekūanaōʻa (1793–1868).

The building is adjacent to Aliiolani Hale and within walking distance of the Hawaii State Capitol, Hawaii State Library, Iolani Palace and Kawaiahao Church. The area was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 as the Hawaii Capital Historic District.

The Territorial State Office Building was originally designed for the United States Federal Government to house Hawaii Territorial Administrative offices. It now hosts the primary offices of the Public Utilities Commission, the Department of the Attorney General Investigations Division, the Hawaii Criminal Justice Data Center and other state offices.

==In popular culture==
During season nine (1976) of the television series &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, Steve McGarrett and his men had their offices in the Territorial Building rather than their usual home at the Iolani Palace, which was undergoing renovations at the time. In the 2010 remake, the building facade serves as the Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series) crime lab.

<doc id="728528" wikidata="Q2816512" url="?curid=728528" title="3 Musketeers (chocolate bar)">
<text>3 Musketeers is a candy bar made in the United States and Canada by Mars, Incorporated. It is a candy bar consisting of chocolate-covered, fluffy, whipped nougat. It is similar to the global Milky Way bar as well as the American version of the Milky Way bar (only without the latter&#x27;s caramel topping).

==History==
Introduced in 1932, the 3 Musketeers Bar was the third brand produced and manufactured by M&amp;M/Mars. Originally, each bar contained three flavors—chocolate, strawberry and vanilla—hence the name, which was derived from the 1844 novel &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; by Alexandre Dumas. Rising costs and wartime restrictions on sugar saw the vanilla and strawberry pieces phased out, leaving only the more popular chocolate. The bars cost five cents when they were introduced, and they were marketed as one of the largest chocolate bars available.

To mark the 75th anniversary of the introduction of the candy bar, Mars introduced 3 Musketeers Mint, the first brand extension, in August 2007. Also in 2007, Mars produced a limited-edition &quot;Autumn Minis Mix&quot; 3 Musketeers. It featured French Vanilla, Mocha Cappuccino and Strawberry. This was followed by Cherry 3 Musketeers for 2008, and Raspberry 3 Musketeers and Orange 3 Musketeers for Easter 2008. Orange was coated in milk chocolate, while the cherry and raspberry were coated with dark chocolate. In 2019, Mars released their latest flavor, the 3 Musketeers Birthday Cake.

==Manufacturing==
The candy is made of a whipped nougat mousse formed into very large slabs, which are cut to size and enrobed in milk chocolate. The nougat chocolate center is made by whipping egg whites until they are light and frothy. Sugar syrup is then added, stabilizing the foam and creating mousse. Other flavoring ingredients are then added to the mousse to create specific flavors.

The candy is made in Chicago, Illinois; Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania; and Newmarket, Ontario.

==Marketing==
3 Musketeers was advertised on television on the 1950s-era &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; show, along with a song that Buffalo Bob Smith encouraged children to sing.

In 1998, the bar&#x27;s advertisements featured three men dressed as the legendary Three Musketeers to market the &quot;45% less fat&quot; campaign. The advertising campaign was developed by Will Vinton Studios, whose previous works include the M&amp;M&#x27;s characters, The Noid and The California Raisins. The product&#x27;s original slogan of &quot;Big on Chocolate!&quot; was expanded in these advertisements to &quot;Big on Chocolate, Not on Fat!&quot;

In 2015, Mars, Incorporated debuted a marketing campaign in the form of a YouTube channel. The campaign was developed and directed by the advertising agency Tribal Worldwide, who explained the project as an effort to establish relevancy and recognition among Generation Z. The campaign has encountered mixed reception. Many marketing insiders have described the campaign as an example of influencer marketing, whereby personalities or &quot;influencers&quot; are able to more effectively advertise to an audience that trusts them than an expensive corporate advertising campaign.

A common misconception regarding the Three Musketeers bar and Milky Way bar is that on release the two candies had their respective labels swapped in manufacturing. The explanation given is that the Milky Way bar&#x27;s three ingredients in the US (chocolate, nougat, and caramel) were originally meant to represent the three musketeers. However the Milky Way bar was released in the US in 1924, and the 3 Musketeers bar was released in the US in 1932, disproving this urban myth.

==Nutritional information==

<text>Adiabene (Greek: Αδιαβηνή) () was an ancient kingdom in northern Mesopotamia, corresponding to the northwestern part of ancient Assyria. The size of the kingdom varied over time; initially encompassing an area between the Zab Rivers, it eventually gained control of Nineveh and starting at least with the rule of Monobazos I (late 1st-century BCE), Gordyene became an Adiabenian dependency. It reached its zenith under Izates II, who was granted the district of Nisibis by the Parthian king Artabanus II () as a reward for helping him regain his throne. Adiabene&#x27;s eastern borders stopped at the Zagros Mountains, adjacent to the region of Media. Arbela served as the capital of Adiabene.

The formation of the kingdom is obscure. The first instance of a recorded Adiabenian ruler is in 69 BCE, when an unnamed king of Adiabene participated in the battle of Tigranocerta as an ally of the Armenian king Tigranes the Great (E). However, coinage implies the establishment of a kingdom in Adiabene around 164 BCE, following the disintegration of Greek Seleucid rule in the Near East. Adiabene was conquered by the Parthian king Mithridates I (E) in c. 145–141 BCE, and by at least from the reign of Mithridates II (E) served as an integral part of the Parthian realm.

Adiabenian rulers converted to Judaism from paganism in the 1st century CE. Queen Helena of Adiabene (known in Jewish sources as &quot;Heleni HaMalka&quot;, meaning &quot;Helene the Queen&quot;) moved to Jerusalem, where she built palaces for herself and her sons, Izates bar Monobaz and Monobaz II at the northern part of the city of David, south of the Temple Mount, and aided the Jews in their war with Rome. According to the Talmud, both Helena and Monobaz donated large funds for the Temple of Jerusalem. After 115 CE, there are no historic traces of Jewish royalty in Adiabene.

The Parthians were overthrown by the Sasanian Empire in 224, who by the time of Shapur I () had established their rule in Adiabene. Ardashir II is the last figure to be recorded as king of Adiabene, which implies that the kingdom was after his tenure in transformed into a province (&quot;shahr&quot;), governed by a non-royal delegate (&quot;marzban&quot; or &quot;shahrab&quot;) of the Sasanian king.

==Etymology==
The name of the state entered English from the Ancient Greek , which was derived from , &#x27; or &#x27;, in Syriac. The state was also known as &quot;Nōdšīragān&quot; or &quot;Nōd-Ardaxšīragān&quot; in Middle Persian, Նոր Շիրական, &quot;Nor Shirakan&quot;, in Armenian, and , &quot;Ḥaḏyāḇ&quot;, in Hebrew. 

==Location==
Adiabene occupied a district in Median Empire between the Upper Zab (Lycus) and the Lower Zab (Caprus), though Ammianus Marcellinus speaks of Nineveh, Ecbatana, and Gaugamela as also belonging to it. By the late 1st century CE, its borders extended as far as Nisibis. In the Talmudic writings the name occurs as . Its chief city was Arbela (&quot;Arba-ilu&quot;), where Mar Uqba had a school, or the neighboring Hazzah, by which name the later Arabs also called Arbela.

In Kiddushin 72a the Biblical Habor is identified with Adiabene, but in Jerusalem Talmud, Megillah i. 71b with Riphath. In the Targum Jonathan on Jeremiah li. 27, Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz are paraphrased by &quot;Kordu&quot;, &quot;Harmini&quot;, and &quot;Hadayab&quot;, i.e., Corduene, Armenia, and Adiabene; while in Ezekiel xxvii. 23 Harran, Caneh, and Eden are interpreted by the Jewish Babylonian Aramaic translator as &quot;Harwan, Nisibis, and Adiabene.&quot;

==Population==
Adiabene had a mixed population of Assyrians, Arabs, Arameans, Greeks, and Iranians. Adiabene was a major-speaking Syriac language kingdom. According to Pliny, four tribes inhabited the region of Adiabene: &quot;Orontes&quot;, &quot;Alani&quot;, &quot;Azones&quot; and &quot;Silices&quot;. The account of Josephus&#x27; &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; shows that there was a substantial Jewish population in the kingdom. The difficult mixing of cultures can be seen in the story of the martyrdom of Mahanuš, a prominent Iranian Zoroastrian who converted to Christianity. In later times Adiabene became an archbishopric, with the seat of the metropolitan at Arbela.

Based on names of the Adiabenian rulers, Ernst Herzfeld suggested a Sakan or Scythian origin for the royal house of the kingdom; however, later progress in Iranian linguistic studies showed that these names were common west middle Iranian names. It has been suggested that the royal house of Adiabene, after fleeing Trajan&#x27;s invasion, established the later Amatuni dynasty which ruled the area between the lakes Urmia and Van.

Adiabene was a district in Mesopotamia between upper and lower Zab and was a part of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and inhabited by Assyrians even after the fall of Nineveh. It was an integral part of Asoristan (Achaemenid and Sasanian Assyria). The region was later made a part of the Roman province of Assyria after the invasion by Trajan in 116.

According to Patricia Crone and Michael Cook, when the heartland of Assyria was back into focus in early Christianity (during the Parthian era and about six centuries after the fall of the Assyrian Empire), &quot;it was with an Assyrian, not a Persian let alone Greek, self-identification: the temple of Ashur was restored, the city was rebuilt, and an Assyrian successor state that returned in the shape of the client kingdom of Adiabene.&quot; The Jewish historian Flavius Josephus states that the inhabitants of Adiabene were Assyrians.

==History== 
===Achaemenid Persian Empire===
Under the Achaemenid Persian kings, Adiabene seems for a time to have been a vassal state of the Persian Empire. At times the throne of Adiabene was held by a member of the Achaemenid house; Artaxerxes III (king from 358 to 338 BC), before he came to the throne of Persia, had the title &quot;King of Hadyab&quot;. The Ten Thousand, an army of Greek mercenaries, retreated through Adiabene on their march to the Black Sea after the Battle of Cunaxa.

===Queen Helena&#x27;s conversion to Judaism===
According to Jewish tradition, Helena, the Queen of Adiabene converted to Judaism from paganism in the 1st century. Queen Helena of Adiabene (known in Jewish sources as ) moved to Jerusalem where she built palaces for herself and her sons, Izates bar Monobaz and Monobaz II at the northern part of the city of David, south of the Temple Mount, and aided Jews in their war with Rome. Queen Helena&#x27;s sarcophagus was discovered in 1863. A pair of inscriptions on the sarcophagus, &quot;tzaddan malka&quot; and &quot;tzadda malkata,&quot; is believed to be a reference to the provisions (tzeda in Hebrew) that Helena supplied to Jerusalem&#x27;s poor and to the Jewish kingdom in general. According to Josephus, the queen converted to Judaism together with her son Monobaz II, under the influence of two Jews. Another tradition has it that she met a Jewish jewelry merchant in Adiabene by the name of Hananiah (Ananias) or Eliezer, who told her about the people of Israel and persuaded her to join them. All historic traces of Jewish royalty in Adiabene ended around 115 CE, but these stories made huge impact on rabbinic literature and Talmud. Nominally Zoroastrian, the people of Adiabene were tolerant toward Judaism, and permitted the establishment of Jewish communities there, The Jews of Edessa, Nisibis, and Adiabene repaid them by being among the most vigorous opponents of Trajan. In late second century Christianity rapidly spread among Zoroastrians and those formerly professing Judaism. When Christianity became the official religion of the Roman empire under Constantine, the position of Adiabenian Christians was naturally exacerbated, since they were seen as potentially disaffected by the zealously Zoroastrian Sasanians.

===Hellenistic period===
The little kingdom may have had a series of native rulers nominally vassal to the Macedonian, Seleucid and later Armenian (under Tigranes the Great) empires.

===Parthian Empire===
It later became one of the client kingdoms of the Parthian empire. During the 1st century BCE and the 1st century CE, it gained a certain prominence under a series of kings descended from Monobaz I and his son Izates I. Monobaz I is known to have been allied with king Abennerig of Characene, in whose court his son Izates II bar Monobaz lived for a time and whose daughter Symacho Izates married, as well as the rulers of other small kingdoms on the periphery of the Parthian sphere of influence.

====Roman intermezzo (117–118)====
The chief opponent of Trajan in Mesopotamia during the year 115 was the last king of independent Adiabene, Meharaspes. He had made common cause with Ma&#x27;nu (Mannus) of Singar (Singara). Trajan invaded Adiabene, and made it part of the Roman province of Assyria; under Hadrian in 117.

In the summer of 195 Septimius Severus was again warring in Mesopotamia, and in 196 three divisions of the Roman army fell upon Adiabene. According to Dio Cassius, Caracalla took Arbela in the year 216, and searched all the graves there, wishing to ascertain whether the Arsacid kings were buried there. Many of the ancient royal tombs were destroyed.

===Sasanian rule===
Despite the overthrow of the Parthians by the Sasanians in 224 CE, the feudatory dynasties remained loyal to the Parthians, and resisted Sasanian advance into Adiabene and Atropatene. Due to this, and religious differences, Adiabene was never regarded as an integral part of Iran, even though the Sasanians controlled it for several centuries.

After the Roman Empire gradually made Christianity its official religion during the fourth century, the inhabitants of Adiabene, who were primarily Assyrian Christians, sided with Christian Rome rather than the Zoroastrian Sasanians. The Byzantine Empire sent armies to the region during the Byzantine–Sasanian wars, but this did nothing to change the territorial boundaries. Adiabene remained a province of the Sasanians Empire until the Muslim conquest of Persia.

The region was recorded as &quot;Nod-Ardadkhshiragan&quot; or &quot;Nod-Ardashiragan&quot; in Sasanian period.

==Bishops==
Between the 5th and the 14th centuries Adiabene was a metropolitan province of the Assyrian Church of the East. The &quot;Chronicle of Erbil&quot;, a purported history of Christianity in Adiabene under the Parthians and Sasanians, lists a number of early bishops of Erbil. The authenticity of the &quot;Chronicle of Erbil&quot; has been questioned, and scholars remain divided on how much credence to place in its evidence. Some of the bishops in the following list are attested in other sources, but the early bishops are probably legendary.

<text>The Communist Party of British Columbia is the provincial section of the Communist Party of Canada in British Columbia. From the 1945 election to the 1956 election, it was known as the Labor-Progressive Party, initially due to the Communist Party having been banned under the Defence of Canada Regulations. The party is led by Kimball Cariou, who was the long-time editor of &quot;People&#x27;s Voice&quot; before he took the leadership position in December 2020.

== Newspapers ==
In contrast to other provincial sections of the Communist Party of Canada, the Communist Party of British Columbia published many newspapers of its own for nearly six decades, including the &quot;B.C. Worker&#x27;s News&quot; (1935–1937), &quot;People&#x27;s Advocate&quot; (1937–1940), &quot;Vancouver Clarion&quot; (1940–1941), &quot;Pacific Advocate&quot; (1942–1945), and &quot;Pacific Tribune&quot; (1946–1992).

<text>The National Scrabble Association (NSA) was created in 1978 by Selchow &amp; Righter, then the makers of Scrabble, to promote their game. It coordinated local clubs and Scrabble tournaments in North America, including the National Scrabble Championship, until 2009. The last director was John D. Williams, who is co-author of the book &quot;Everything Scrabble&quot;.

In July 2009, the coordination of tournaments and competitive clubs was transferred to a new organization, North American Scrabble Players Association (NASPA), now known as NASPA Games. The NSA continued to publish &quot;Scrabble News&quot; and run programs such as the School Scrabble program.

The National Scrabble Association dissolved on July 1, 2013.

Activities of the association included:

* Organizing and promoting the National Scrabble Championship (through 2008)
* Playing an active role in Scrabble public relations, publicity and promotions
* Developing and promoting the National School Scrabble Program
* Developing and managing the ProLiteracy Worldwide Fund-Raiser Program
* Publishing 8 issues of &quot;Scrabble News&quot; each year
* Answering questions from consumers and press regarding the game&#x27;s history, rules, products, etc.
* Advising Hasbro on word games
* Monitoring the media for correct trademark use
* Co-ordinating casual Scrabble clubs

<doc id="728560" wikidata="Q594231" url="?curid=728560" title="Corfu Declaration">
<text>The Corfu Declaration () was an agreement between the prime minister of Serbia, Nikola Pašić, and the president of the Yugoslav Committee, Ante Trumbić, concluded on the Greek island of Corfu on 20 July 1917. Its purpose was to establish the method of unifying a future common state of the South Slavs living in Serbia, Montenegro and Austria-Hungary after the First World War. Russia&#x27;s decision to withdraw diplomatic support for Serbia following the February Revolution, as well as the Yugoslav Committee&#x27;s sidelining by the trialist reform initiatives launched in Austria-Hungary, motivated both sides to attempt to reach an agreement.

Pašić and Trumbić&#x27;s positions were disparate. Pašić advocated for a centralist government, while Trumbić argued for a federal state, leaving significant powers to federal units and safeguarding national rights. The resulting declaration glossed over the matter of the system of government. As a compromise, it specified only that the common Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes would be a constitutional monarchy ruled by the currently reigning Serbian Karađorđević dynasty, deferring most questions to a future Constitutional Assembly. During the discussions, which lasted 35 days, Trumbić had little support for his view from the other members of the Yugoslav Committee, who were preoccupied with the threat posed by Italy, which had been promised territory under the 1915 Treaty of London.

==Background==

During the First World War, pressure developed in the parts of Austria-Hungary inhabited by its South Slavic population – the Croats, the Serbs, the Slovenes, and the Muslim Slavs (Bosniaks) – in support of trialist reform, or the establishment of a common South Slavic state independent of the empire. This common state was meant to be achieved through the realisation of Yugoslavist ideas and unification with the Kingdom of Serbia.

Serbia considered the war an opportunity for territorial expansion. A committee tasked with determining the country&#x27;s war aims produced a programme to establish a wider South Slavic state by adding the South Slav-inhabited parts of the Habsburg lands – Croatia-Slavonia, Slovene Lands, Vojvodina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Dalmatia – to Serbia. In its December 1914 Niš Declaration, the National Assembly of Serbia announced the struggle to liberate and unify &quot;unliberated brothers&quot; as its national war aim. This contravened the interests of the Triple Entente, which favoured the continued existence of Austria-Hungary as a counterweight to the influence of the German Empire. In late 1915, combined Austro-Hungarian, German and Bulgarian forces defeated and occupied Serbia, forcing its government and remaining troops to withdraw across Albania and seek refuge on the Greek island of Corfu.

In April 1915, the Yugoslav Committee was established as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; group with no official capacity. Partially funded by the Serbian government, it consisted of intellectuals and politicians from Austria-Hungary claiming to represent the interests of South Slavs. Ante Trumbić was the Committee&#x27;s president, but Frano Supilo, the co-founder of the ruling Croat-Serb Coalition in Croatia-Slavonia, was its most prominent member. Supilo advocated for a federation consisting of Serbia (including Vojvodina), Croatia (encompassing Croatia-Slavonia and Dalmatia), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia and Montenegro.

On 30 May 1917, South Slavic members of the Vienna Imperial Council established the Yugoslav Club chaired by Slovene People&#x27;s Party president Anton Korošec. The Yugoslav Club presented the council with the May Declaration – a manifesto demanding the unification of Habsburg land inhabited by Croats, Slovenes, and Serbs into a democratic, free and independent state under Habsburg dynastic rule. The demand was made with reference to the principles of national self-determination and Croatian state right.

==Discussions at Corfu==

The May Declaration was issued while the Triple Entente was still looking for ways to achieve a separate peace with Austria-Hungary and thereby detach it from Germany. This presented a problem for the Serbian government exiled on Corfu. It increased the risk of a trialist solution for the Habsburg South Slavs if a separate peace treaty materialised, preventing the fulfillment of Serbia&#x27;s war objectives. Lacking strong Russian diplomatic backing since the February Revolution, Serbian prime minister Nikola Pašić therefore felt compelled to come to an arrangement with the Yugoslav Committee.

The Yugoslav Committee was also placed under pressure. It claimed to speak on behalf of South Slavs within Austria-Hungary, but was also openly looking after its own interests. The May Declaration presented a challenge to the Yugoslav Committee and the government of Serbia by depriving them of initiative in the South Slavic unification process. This led them both to prioritise drafting a unification programme for the South Slavic lands inside and outside Austria-Hungary.

Despite being partially funded by the Serbian government, the Yugoslav Committee disagreed with it on the method of unification and the system of government. This conflict resulted from a disagreement between Pašić and Supilo. Pašić advocated a centralised government based in Belgrade, while Supilo wanted a federation and accused Pašić of championing a Greater Serbian agenda. When Pašić invited the Yugoslav Committee for talks in May 1917, Supilo warned against discussions without determining Serbian intentions first.

Committee members learned that, under the Treaty of London, the Triple Entente had promised Italy parts of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s territory – sections of the Slovene Lands, Istria, and Dalmatia – to entice Italy to join the Entente. Most of the Committee members were from Dalmatia and saw the Treaty of London as a threat that could only be checked with Serbia&#x27;s support, prompting them to accept Pašić&#x27;s invitation to Corfu. In protest, Supilo resigned his committee membership.
Despite radically different views on the system of government in the proposed common state, a series of meetings were held from 15 June to 20 July in order to reach a consensus. The negotiating parties mistrusted each other. The Yugoslav Committee based their positions on local autonomies, legal institutions, federalism and the Croatian state right, but the Serbian government considered those positions vestiges of the struggle against the &quot;enemy&quot; (meaning Austria-Hungary). On the other hand, Pašić touted universal suffrage and simple parliamentary democracy, interpreted by Trumbić as a way to ensure the rule of the Serbs as the most populous ethnic group in the proposed state. In response to Trumbić&#x27;s demands, Pašić said that if the Croats insisted on a federation, the Serbian government would abandon the unification project in favour of the creation of Greater Serbia. After twenty-eight plenary meetings over the course of thirty-five days, differences of opinion became apparent, and no agreement on the system of government was reached. The resulting Corfu Declaration glossed over this, leaving it to the future Constituent Assembly to decide by an unspecified qualified majority – i.e. not by a simple majority vote – before being approved by the Serbian king. According to the scholar Dejan Medaković, Trumbić claimed he had to sign the Declaration as the only way for his people to be on the war&#x27;s winning side.

The Declaration stated that Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes were one &quot;tri-named&quot; people, and that the Karađorđević dynasty would reign in the new unified state, which would be organised as a parliamentary, constitutional monarchy. Finally, the Declaration stated that the new government would respect the equality of &quot;religion and alphabets&quot;, voting rights, and so forth. Trumbić proposed to establish a provisional government of the new state, but Pašić declined in order to avoid undermining the inherent diplomatic advantage Serbia enjoyed as an already-recognised state.

==Impact==
In essence, the Corfu Declaration was a political manifesto disregarded by the Serbian government with respect to the qualified majority needed to adopt a constitution, but upheld when its provisions coincided with Serbian interests. Conversely, Croatian autonomist politicians deemed the provisions on the qualified majority as a binding agreement. The Declaration was a compromise by the Yugoslav Committee and the Pašić government. It was hailed as a South Slavic &quot;Magna Carta&quot; for recognising the &quot;tribal&quot; names, three flags and religions, and two &quot;alphabets&quot;. At the same time, the Declaration limited the powers of the future Constituent Assembly by deciding on the monarchy and the specific ruling dynasty. It also decided the name of the future state as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes – following Serbian objections against the name of &quot;Yugoslavia&quot; as a Western invention designed to stamp out the name &quot;Serbia&quot;.

Trumbić was largely isolated in his opposition to the centralism championed by Pašić; most of the Yugoslav Committee sided with Pašić on the issue. While Trumbić insisted on leaving the internal affairs, education, judiciary, and economy (other than customs, currency, credit and management of state property) to federal units and asked for veto powers for the &quot;tribes&quot; in the Constitutional Assembly to ensure decision-making by consensus, Pašić rejected his ideas. Pašić favoured granting a degree of autonomy to local governments but advocated the abolition of historical lands in favour of new administrative units. Pašić let it be known that Croatian federalists may only exert some influence in Zagreb and its immediate surroundings and on the Adriatic islands largely claimed by Italy. The Declaration avoided most of these issues but referred to &quot;counties and other administrative units&quot;. That was later interpreted as a break with the historical rights of the historical provinces. Similarly, the Croatian Sabor was given no role in the Declaration. The Corfu Declaration contained no institutional safeguards of national rights. According to Ivo Banac, the Yugoslav Committee chose not to insist on those matters as it was preoccupied with the Italian threat. In Italy, the Declaration was portrayed as anti-Italian in spirit, aimed at splitting Italy from its allies and diminishing the Italian contribution to the war effort. This view was specifically advocated by Fasces of Revolutionary Action Benito Mussolini. Nationalists sought to capitalise on identifying with nationalistic positions towards the Adriatic Question by presenting the Treaty of London (with addition of Fiume (Rijeka) to Italy) as a fair territorial compromise threatened by the imperialistic thinking of the Yugoslav Committee.

International support only gradually began shifting away from the preservation of Austria-Hungary in 1917. That year, Russia sued for peace following the Russian Revolution while the United States, whose president, Woodrow Wilson, advocated the principle of self-determination, entered the war. Nonetheless, in his Fourteen Points speech, Wilson only promised autonomy for the peoples of Austria-Hungary. Preservation of the dual monarchy was not abandoned before the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918. By then, the Allies became convinced that they could not resist a Communist revolution. As Austria-Hungary disintegrated, representatives of the Serbian government and opposition, the Yugoslav Committee, and representatives of the National Council of the newly proclaimed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs in the former Habsburg lands, met for another round of negotiations in Geneva on 6–9 November 1918. At the conference, the Yugoslav Committee and the National Council persuaded Pašić to sign the Geneva Declaration renouncing the unitarist concept of the future union. However, the Serbian government quickly repudiated the Declaration. Pressed by the circumstances of Italian armed incursion, the National Council drew up instructions for its delegation to the Serbian prince regent Alexander, offering to proclaim the unification of the South Slavs and the creation of a new state. The instructions were drawn up by relying on the Corfu Declaration and the National Council&#x27;s federalist ideas.

The delegation ignored their instructions and changed the address to Alexander from specifying a federalist system of government based on the Corfu Declaration to a display of loyalty and expression of wishes. On 1 December, Prince Regent Alexander accepted the offer to proclaim unification with no constraints imposed.

<text>Oscar Nathan Straus (6 March 1870 – 11 January 1954) was a Viennese composer of operettas, film scores, and songs. He also wrote about 500 cabaret songs, chamber music, and orchestral and choral works. His original name was actually Strauss, but for professional purposes he deliberately omitted the final &#x27;s&#x27;. He wished not to be associated with the musical Strauss family of Vienna. However, he did follow the advice of Johann Strauss II in 1898 about abandoning the prospective lure of writing waltzes for the more lucrative business of writing for the theatre.

The son of a Jewish family, he studied music in Berlin under Max Bruch, and became an orchestral conductor, working at the Überbrettl cabaret. He went back to Vienna and began writing operettas, becoming a serious rival to Franz Lehár. When Lehár&#x27;s popular &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; premiered in 1905, Straus was said to have remarked &quot;Das kann ich auch!&quot; (I can also do that!). In 1939, after the Anschluss, he fled to Paris, where he received the honour of a Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. In 1940 he fled via Portugal to the United States, where he settled in Hollywood. After the war he returned to Europe, and settled at Bad Ischl, where he died. His grave is in the Bad Ischl Friedhof.

Straus&#x27; best-known works are &quot;Ein Walzertraum&quot; (&quot;A Waltz Dream&quot;), and &quot;The Chocolate Soldier&quot; (&quot;Der tapfere Soldat&quot;). The waltz arrangement from the former is probably his most enduring orchestral work. Among his most famous works is the theme from the 1950 film &quot;La Ronde&quot;.

<text>L&#x27;Oréal S.A. () is a French multinational personal care corporation registered in Paris and headquartered in Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine. It is the world&#x27;s largest cosmetics company, with activities spanning skin care, sun protection, make-up, perfume, hair care and hair color.

==History==
===Founding===
In the early 20th century, Eugène Paul Louis Schueller (1881–1957), a young French chemist, developed a hair dye formula called &quot;Oréale&quot;. Schueller formulated and manufactured his own products, which he sold to Parisian hairdressers. On 31 July 1909, Schueller registered his company, the Société Française de Teintures Inoffensives pour Cheveux (Safe Hair Dye Company of France). The company eventually became L&#x27;Oréal. In 1920, the company employed three chemists; the number of employees continued to grow with 100 by the year 1950, and 1,000 by the year 1984; as recently as 2021, there was an estimated total of 85,252 worldwide.

L&#x27;Oréal got its start in the hair-color business, but the company soon branched out into other cleansing and beauty products. As of 2020, L&#x27;Oréal markets in all sectors of the beauty business: hair color, permanents, hair styling, body and skincare, cleansers, makeup, and fragrance. The company&#x27;s products are found in a wide variety of outlets, from hair salons and perfumeries to supermarkets, health/beauty outlets, pharmacies, and direct mail.

In March 2008, L&#x27;Oréal acquired 3 Suisse&#x27;s stake, taking sole control of the company. In November 2013, L&#x27;Oréal announced that Le Club des Créateurs de Beauté would cease activity in the first half of 2014.

Since 1997, L&#x27;Oréal has been an official partner of The Cannes Film Festival. In the years of L&#x27;Oréal sponsorship, many L&#x27;Oréal beauty ambassadors walked the red carpet of the Cannes Film Festival. In 2017, L&#x27;Oréal beauty ambassadors, including Julianne Moore, Susan Sarandon, Andie MacDowell, and Eva Longoria, were responsible for the film selection for the outdoor cinema during the Cannes Film Festival.

L&#x27;Oréal&#x27;s advertising slogan, &quot;Because I&#x27;m worth it&quot;, was created by a 23-year-old English art director and introduced in 1973 by the model and actress Joanne Dusseau. In the mid-2000s, this was replaced by &quot;Because you&#x27;re worth it&quot;. In late-2009, the slogan was changed again to &quot;Because we&#x27;re worth it&quot;.

== Corporate social responsibility ==

=== Position on animal testing ===
L&#x27;Oréal has many products which are tested on animals.

Since the 1980s, L&#x27;Oréal has invested €900 million in researching alternatives to animal testing for product safety, using methods such as reconstructed skin models, such as the Episkin model at their research centres in Gerland, France, and Pudong, China.

Nevertheless, this is complicated by markets such as China, where it is difficult to sell a beauty product without animal testing. Cosmetics by brands such as The Body Shop, which refuse to do animal testing, are thus not sold in China.

In 2013, L&#x27;Oréal was part of a consortium calling on the EU to invest more in research on alternatives to animal testing.

=== Promoting new methods for plastic recycling ===
In 2020, L&#x27;Oreal announced a cooperation with French biochemistry pioneer Carbios, aiming to establish a method of dissolving plastic waste by using enzymes.

=== Ukraine war ===
In 2022, L’Oréal Paris donated €1 million ($1.09 million) to charities supporting refugees from the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. L’Oréal Paris also suspended all commercial activity in Russia, both retail and wholesale.

After the suspension, L&#x27;Oreal increased cooperation with other sites, including sanctioned ones. The company officially works in Crimea. Advertising expenses were not stopped - all investments were suspended for only 2–3 months. Now everything has been restored and even increased. The delivery of goods through Turkey and Kazakhstan was arranged.

The company also supplies hygiene products to hospitals, maternity homes, centers with forcibly displaced persons, homes for the elderly, the military, etc. L’Oréal Paris financially supports employees in Ukraine, guaranteeing the payment of wages and providing additional financial assistance, and provide accommodation for employees who are abroad and assist with temporary employment in other L&#x27;Oréal branches.

== Community involvement ==
In 2014, L&#x27;Oreal was listed 61st among 1200 of India&#x27;s most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company.

In 2008, L&#x27;Oréal was named Europe&#x27;s top business employer by the European Student Barometer, a survey conducted by Trendence that covers 20 European countries and incorporates the responses of over 91,000 students.

The L&#x27;Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science was established to improve the position of women in science by recognizing outstanding women researchers who have contributed to scientific progress. The awards are a result of a partnership between the French cosmetics company L&#x27;Oréal and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and carry a grant of US$100,000 for each laureate. The same partnership awards the UNESCO-L&#x27;Oréal International Fellowships, providing up to US$40,000 in funding over two years to fifteen young women scientists engaged in exemplary and promising research projects.

L&#x27;Oréal organises the yearly L&#x27;Oréal Brandstorm, a business game for students in 46 countries. The game is related to marketing and has a first prize of $10,000, the second prize of $5,000 and the third prize of $2500.

L&#x27;Oréal is also a founding member of the &quot;Look Good ... Feel Better&quot; project, a charity that was formed over 16 years ago to help women combat the visible side effects of cancer treatment.

L&#x27;Oréal also holds a global competition known as &quot;L&#x27;Oréal Brandstorm&quot; each year to invite students from around the world to be creative, innovative, and build their own business plans based on different topics.

In 2015, Standard Ethics Aei gave a rating to L&#x27;Oreal in order to include it in its Standard Ethics French Index.

==Controversies==

=== Involvement in fascism by L&#x27;Oréal key figures ===
L&#x27;Oréal has conceded that its founder, Eugène Schueller, was a Nazi sympathizer and antisemitic fascist. He was also a member of La Cagoule, which supported the Vichy regime, and was a violent, pro-fascist and anti-communist organisation. Eugène bankrolled La Cagoule and some meetings of La Cagoule were held at L&#x27;Oréal headquarters. Some of the criminal activities perpetrated by La Cagoule include firearms transportation, assassinating a former minister, and firebombing six synagogues.

Schueller provided financial support and held meetings for La Cagoule at L&#x27;Oréal headquarters. La Cagoule was a violent French fascist-leaning and anti-communist group whose leader formed a political party Mouvement Social Révolutionnaire (MSR, Social Revolutionary Movement), which in Occupied France supported the Vichy collaboration with the Germans. L&#x27;Oréal hired several members of the group as executives after World War II, such as Jacques Corrèze, who served as CEO of the United States operation.

Other controversy arose when Jean Frydman, a shareholder and board member of Paravision, a film subsidiary of L&#x27;Oréal, was fired. He claims that he was let go because L&#x27;Oréal wanted to avoid an Arab boycott of businesses associated with Jews. In turn, Frydman decided to expose the past of L&#x27;Oréal executives. André Bettencourt who married Schueller&#x27;s daughter, Liliane Bettencourt, and became deputy chairman for L&#x27;Oréal, wrote 60 articles for La Terre Française, an antisemitic Nazi propaganda sheet. André has admitted ownership of the propaganda but claimed he was poisoned by the Vichy regime and said, &quot;I have repeatedly expressed my regrets concerning them in public and will always beg the Jewish community to forgive me for them.&quot; André Bettencourt also sheltered Schueller and several collaborators from the French Resistance after Liberation. It was also revealed that Eugène Schueller hired Jacques Correze, who was the honorary head of L&#x27;Oréal&#x27;s U.S. affiliate, Cosmair, and was involved with La Cagoule.

Further controversy arose when it was revealed that L&#x27;Oréal had its German headquarters for over 30 years, before being sold in 1991, on land confiscated from a Jewish family during World War II. The Jewish family has been battling for restitution from the company for three generations, the latest of which is Edith Rosenfelder, a Holocaust survivor. Fritz Rosenfelder was forced to sell the house to a Nazi official, of which the family never received the proceeds of the sale. Instead, the family was deported. The Allies passed Jewish restitution legislation which states that transactions with Nazis, even if appearing to be with the owner&#x27;s consent, can be considered invalid. As the land was sold to an offshoot of L&#x27;Oréal, which was later bought out in 1961 by L&#x27;Oréal, the company claims that it is not responsible for anything that happened before then. The basis for Rosenfelder&#x27;s argument is that since the original sale was illegal, all subsequent sales are equally unlawful. There was restitution paid in 1951 to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization, though this was done without the family&#x27;s consent and none of the money ever reached the family. A book by Monica Waitzfelder, daughter of Edith Rosenfelder, published in French as &quot;L&#x27;Oréal a pris ma maison&quot; and in English as &quot;L&#x27;Oréal stole my house!&quot;, details how L&#x27;Oréal took over the Waitzfelder home in the German city of Karlsruhe (after the Nazis had engineered the removal of the family) to make it its German headquarters. Monica Waitzfelder is quoted as saying, &quot;All the other businesses which took Jewish property have since returned it, without any great debate. I don&#x27;t understand why L&#x27;Oréal should be any different from the others.&quot; A case was brought before the Supreme Court in France, but the public prosecutor ruled that there could be no trial. As of 2007, she is bringing the case to the European Court of Human Rights.

=== Garnier boycott ===
On 31 July 2014 during Operation Protective Edge launched by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in the Gaza Strip, the Israel advocacy organisation StandWithUs posted several Facebook photos of care packages, which they said were donated by Garnier Israel to female IDF soldiers. This sparked several calls to boycott Garnier and L&#x27;Oréal worldwide. Garnier disavowed the giveaway and stated on their Facebook page, “Garnier USA is aware of recent activity in social media. It is very important to us that our fans know that Garnier worldwide promotes peace and harmony and has a strict policy of not getting involved in any conflict or political matter. Garnier was astonished to discover this in social media. After investigation, the hand-out of about 500 products appeared to be part of a one-time local retailer initiative. Garnier disapproves of this initiative managed strictly at local level and is very sorry to have offended some of its fans.” 

===Animal testing===
L&#x27;Oréal began &quot;in vitro&quot; tissue testing in 1979, and does not test any of its products or ingredients on animals anywhere in the world since 1989–14 years before it was required by regulation. Controversy came from the fact that L&#x27;Oréal sells products in China, whose regulators conduct animal testing on cosmetics to be sold within its territory. Even though a ban on animal testing in China came into effect in January 2020, Chinese authorities still perform this practice for imported &quot;ordinary&quot; cosmetics.

Following L&#x27;Oréal&#x27;s 2006 purchase of The Body Shop, which does not support animal testing, The Body Shop&#x27;s founder Anita Roddick was forced to defend herself against allegations of &quot;abandoning her principles&quot; over L&#x27;Oréal&#x27;s involvement on animal testing. Calls were made for shoppers to boycott The Body Shop. L&#x27;Oréal sold The Body Shop to Brazilian group Natura Cosméticos in 2017.

===Racist discrimination lawsuits===
On 11 August 2005, the Supreme Court of California ruled that former L&#x27;Oréal sales manager Elyse Yanowitz had adequately pleaded a cause of action for retaliatory termination under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, and remanded the case for trial. The case arose out of a 1997 incident in which Jack Wiswall, then the general manager for designer fragrances, allegedly told Yanowitz to fire a dark-skinned sales associate despite the associate&#x27;s good performance. When Yanowitz refused, Wiswall pointed to a &quot;sexy&quot; blonde-haired woman and said, &quot;God damn it, get me one that looks like that.&quot; Wiswall retired as president of the luxury products division of L&#x27;Oréal USA at the end of 2006.

The company has recently faced discrimination lawsuits in France related to the hiring of spokesmodels and institutional racism. In July 2007, the Garnier division and an external employment agency were fined €30,000 for recruitment practices that intentionally excluded women of color from promoting its hair wash, &quot;Fructis Style&quot;.

L&#x27;Oréal continues to sell skin whitening products, which have been criticized as &quot;capitalising on women&#x27;s insecurities due to colourism.&quot; They advertise these controversial products, which have been criticised for promoting a colonial attitude as well as having safety concerns, on their website by claiming; &quot;Achieve clear, translucent and radiant skin. Our skin whitening products work to fade dark spots and brighten skin to give you the fair, flawless complexion you desire.&quot;

===False advertising===
In May 2007, L&#x27;Oréal was one of several cosmetic manufacturers (along with Clinique, Estee Lauder, Payot, Lancôme) ordered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia to withdraw advertising regarding the wrinkle removal capabilities of their products.

In the UK, L&#x27;Oréal has faced criticism from OFCOM regarding the truth of their advertising and marketing campaigns concerning the product performance of one of their mascara brands. In July 2007, the British Advertising Standards Authority attacked L&#x27;Oréal for a television advert on its &quot;Telescopic&quot; mascara, featuring Penélope Cruz, stating, &quot;it will make your eyelashes 60% longer.&quot; In fact, it only made the lashes look 60% bigger, by separating and thickening at the roots and by thickening the tips of the lashes. They also failed to state that the model was wearing false eyelashes.

In July 2011, the British Advertising Standards Authority took action against L&#x27;Oréal, banning two airbrushed Lancôme advertisements in the UK featuring actress Julia Roberts and supermodel Christy Turlington. The agency issued the ban after British politician Jo Swinson argued that the two ads misrepresented reality and added to the self-image problem amongst females in the UK. L&#x27;Oréal acknowledged that the photos had been airbrushed but argued that the two cosmetic products could actually produce the results depicted in the ads and that the results of the products had been scientifically proven.

In June 2014, the company reached an agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission not to make claims about its anti-aging products unless it had credible scientific evidence supporting the claims. The settlement followed an investigation by the commission into claims being made in relation to two products, which the commission described as &quot;false and unsubstantiated&quot;.

L&#x27;Oréal has a team of 400 members of staff who post content to Facebook every day, according to Marc Menesguen, the company&#x27;s chief marketing officer.

=== Patent lawsuit ===
In July 2017, the University of Massachusetts Medical filed a patent lawsuit against L&#x27;Oréal. In August 2017, Dennis Wyrzykowski and his company, Carmel Laboratories LLC, joined the lawsuit. The two parties claimed that L&#x27;Oréal&#x27;s brands used UMass&#x27; patented technology for skin creams with the chemical adenosine. In 2021, a judge found the patents invalid. In 2022, the U.S. Appeals Court reversed the decision, stating that UMass could continue to purse its lawsuit.

===Corporate misconduct===
L&#x27;Oréal was fined by Autorité de la concurrence in France in 2016 for price-fixing on personal hygiene products.

===Munroe Bergdorf===
In August 2017, L&#x27;Oréal dismissed Munroe Bergdorf, a mixed-race transgender model, after she responded to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, by stating in a Facebook post: &quot;Honestly I don&#x27;t have the energy to talk about the racial violence of white people any more. Yes ALL white people&quot;; the post was also quoted as saying that &quot;[white people&#x27;s] existence, privilege and success as a race is built on the backs, blood and death of people of colour&quot;, &quot;racism isn&#x27;t learned, it&#x27;s inherited and ... passed down through privilege&quot; and that &quot;white people&quot; ought to &quot;begin to admit that their race is the most violent and oppressive force of nature on Earth&quot;. Shortly after terminating Bergdorf, L&#x27;Oréal released a statement claiming their commitment to &quot;[support] diversity and tolerance towards all people irrespective of their race, background, gender and religion&quot; and had terminated their partnership with Bergdorf because her comments were &quot;at odds with those values&quot;.

=== Amber Heard ===
In 2018, L&#x27;Oréal Paris hired Amber Heard as a Global Ambassador, also giving a special tribute to her. In 2020, after a tape leaked of Heard admitting to having hit her ex-husband Johnny Depp, several petitions were filed requesting L&#x27;Oreal to fire her. As of June 2021, L&#x27;Oreal continued to include Heard among a team of &quot;ambassadors&quot; that also includes Kate Winslet, Jane Fonda, Elle Fanning, and French singer-songwriter Yseult. Heard was being sued in a defamation trial by Depp in which he accused her of domestic abuse. She was found to have defamed her ex-husband with malice on June 2, 2022, by a jury; Heard then appealed her case.

=== Child Labour ===
In May 2024, a BBC World Service documentary titled &quot;Perfume&#x27;s Dark Secret&quot; uncovered widespread child labor in Egypt&#x27;s jasmine fields, an essential source for fragrances used by major beauty brands, including L&#x27;Oréal. The investigation exposed that children, some as young as five years old, were engaged in the physically demanding task of picking jasmine flowers. These children worked under grueling conditions, often beginning their shifts at 3 a.m. and working in high temperatures. The documentary highlighted the poverty these children faced, with some earning as little as $1 per day, far below a living wage.

The BBC&#x27;s findings sparked global concern over labor practices in the perfume industry, particularly regarding the exploitation of children in rural areas of Egypt. The country’s jasmine flowers are a key ingredient in high-end perfumes produced by companies like L&#x27;Oréal, leading to questions about the ethical sourcing of raw materials in the beauty and fragrance sector. Despite claims by L&#x27;Oréal and other luxury brands of strict monitoring systems, the documentary suggested that these children had been overlooked by current auditing processes and that insufficient measures were in place to protect workers from exploitation.

<text>Gorf is an arcade video game released in 1981 by Dave Nutting Associates. It is a fixed shooter with five distinct levels, the first of which is based on &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and another on &quot;Galaxian&quot;. The game makes use of synthesized speech for the Gorfian robot which taunts the player, powered by a speech chip. &quot;Gorf&quot; allows the player to buy two additional lives per quarter before starting the game, for a maximum of seven lives.

The home ports omit the &quot;Galaxians&quot; stage because the Japanese developer Namco owns the rights to the franchise.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Gorf&quot; is a fixed shooter in which the players take control of an unnamed starship from the Interstellar Space Force with a mission to prevent the Gorfian Empire from conquering Earth. The ship is capable of moving freely in all directions around the lower third of the screen under the control of a joystick. This was a departure from older vertically oriented linear shooters, including &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Galaxian&quot;, which allowed only horizontal movement of the player&#x27;s ship controlled by left and right buttons. At the time, the joystick input and two-dimensional movement were still unusual enough that contemporary video game guides noted them as distinctive features of &quot;Gorf&quot;.

Gameplay consists of five distinct missions; every mission presents its own unique playstyle, but the central goal of each is to destroy all enemies. Successfully completing all five missions loops the player back to the first mission and also increases the player&#x27;s rank, which represents the current difficulty level of the game. Gameplay continues until the player loses all of their lives.

Before starting a new game, players can buy up to seven additional lives by purchasing more credits; an extra life is also granted after clearing the first five missions. Unlike similar games where the player can only shoot their weapon after an existing shot has disappeared from the screen, the ship is equipped with a laser cannon capable of firing a single vertical shot (called a &quot;quark laser&quot;) at any time, although doing so causes the previous shot to disappear.

Players can advance through the ranks of &quot;Space Cadet&quot;, &quot;Space Captain&quot;, &quot;Space Colonel&quot;, &quot;Space General&quot;, &quot;Space Warrior&quot; and &quot;Space Avenger&quot;, which increases the speed and difficulty of the game and introduces more enemy patterns. Depending on the version, the player&#x27;s current rank is displayed via a series of integrated lit panels on the cabinet.

===Missions===
# Astro Battles: A clone of &quot;Space Invaders&quot;; it is the only mission that takes place on Earth instead of space. 24 enemies attack in the classic pattern set by the original game; however, the player is protected by a parabolic force field that switches off temporarily when the player&#x27;s shots pass through it and is gradually worn away by enemy fire.
# Laser Attack: The first mission set in space, where the player must battle two formations of five enemies. Each formation contains three yellow enemies that attempt to dive-bomb the player, a white gunner that fires a single laser beam, and a red miniature version of the Gorf robot.
# Galaxians: As the name implies, this mission is a clone of &quot;Galaxian&quot;, with the key differences being the number of enemies and the way they fire at the player. Gameplay is otherwise similar to the original game.
# Space Warp: This mission places the player in a sort of wormhole, where enemies fly outward from the center of the screen and attempt to either shoot down or collide with the player&#x27;s ship. It is possible to destroy enemy shots in this level.
# Flag Ship: The Flag Ship is protected by its own force field, similar to the one protecting the player in Mission 1, and it flies back and forth firing at the player. To defeat it, the player must break through the force field and destroy the ship&#x27;s core. As with the alien ship in &quot;Phoenix&quot;, the bottom of the flag ship must be blasted away to expose the vulnerable core. If a different part of the ship is hit, the player receives bonus points, and the part breaks off and flies in a random direction, potentially posing a risk to the player&#x27;s ship. When the player successfully hits the core, the Flag Ship explodes in a dramatic display, the player advances to the next rank, and play continues on Mission One, with the difficulty increased. Later encounters with the Flag Ship on higher ranks include additional enemies during the mission.

==Development==
===Background and pre-production===
&quot;Gorf&quot; was developed by Jamie Fenton of Dave Nutting Associates (DNA). DNA had become Research and development consultants for Midway Manufacturing at the beginning of the 1970s, and had developed several arcade games such as &quot;Gun Fight&quot; (1975), a reworking of Taito&#x27;s game &quot;Western Gun&quot;. Around this period, Nutting was working on a light gun-based game where the player would attempt to shoot a character he initially christened &quot;Gorf&quot;. The game eventually developed into &quot;Desert Gun&quot; (1977).

Fenton had worked with DNA initially to work on pinball machines. She was a co-creator on some early arcade games such as &quot;The Amazing Maze Game&quot; (1976) and &quot;280 ZZZAP&quot; (1977) and led the team who created the early video game console, the Bally Astrocade. Some of the custom integrated circuits for the system were manipulated and later re-used in &quot;Gorf&quot;. This included customized LSI Framebuffer chip sets. These chips allowed for Exclusive or writing of images which allowed objects on the screen to pass in front of or behind other objects and backgrounds.

Some chips allowed for digitized speech that taunted the player with phrases like &quot;Long live Gorf!&quot; and &quot;Prepare for annihilation, Space Cadet!&quot; The speech originated in chips designed for the Bally console. Fenton recalled that &quot;Quite a few were on the blue end of the spectrum but they still had obscenity laws back then! They had to be clean but still annoying enough to serve their purpose. My favourite? &quot;Your end is near&quot;. That gets a lot of double entendres.&quot;

&quot;Gorf&quot; began as a video game adaptation of the film &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979). Fenton was initially excited on the idea of an adaptation, but abandoned the idea after reading the script for the film, and deciding that they could not draw a great idea for a video game from the script. She only used some leftover elements such as the boss flagship in &quot;Gorf&quot; resembling the USS Enterprise.

===Level design===
Fenton took over a year to develop the game with most of &quot;Gorf&quot; from home, to avoid interacting with her boss in the office. During this period in video games, most games levels required players just to do the same task but in faster time, less resources, or with more enemies. Influenced by director D.W. Griffith, Fenton felt that &quot;Gorf&quot; should be like &quot;cutting from one scene to another&quot; and desired to make a multi-episodic game.

She created three original levels, and two that borrowed from other arcade games. As Midway Manufacturing had arrangements with the Japanese companies Taito and Namco to distribute their games &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978) and &quot;Galaxian&quot; (1979) in the United States, they took creative license and used elements from each game as different-styled levels in &quot;Gorf&quot;. These scenes have slight variations on the gameplay in both games, such as the group of enemies from &quot;Galaxian&quot; swooping &quot;en masse&quot; towards the players space ship. The first level features a blue screen to represent Earth. It uses the &quot;Space Invaders&quot; elements is titled &quot;Astro Battles&quot;. Fenton explained that the name change was done in order to &quot;not promote that brand too much&quot;. The third level &quot;Galaxians&quot; with its extra s in its title attributed to being a misspelling on Fenton&#x27;s part.

The boss fight with the Gorfian flagship was in spired by the trench run scene in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). Fenton joked that &quot;back then, people would shamelessly use other people&#x27;s ideas.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Gorf&quot; field tested alongside &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980) in the United States. &quot;Gorf&quot; was published by Midway Manufacturing and distributed to arcades in the United States in February 1981.

George Gomez, who joined Midway after graduating in 1978, began work with other Midway engineers on controls and cabinets for the company, including the controller for &quot;Gorf&quot;. The game was released in three different sizes of Midway model arcade cabinets. The first was their standard model that featured graphics on the outside of the cabinet, the second being a smaller scaled model with a walnut finish made for saving space in an arcade, and the last being a cocktail table styled cabinet. At the time, the &quot;Gorf&quot; controller was unique as it had the fire button built into the pistol grip. Fenton stated the controller design was taken from a B1 Bomber that the company had designed early on in their history.

===Ports===
&quot;Gorf&quot; was coded for the Commodore 64 by programmer Eric Cotton. In April 1982, Roklan Corporation announced it would release &quot;Gorf&quot; for various home computers. Roklan developed the port for the Atari 400 and 800 computers as well as the Atari 2600 port for CBS Video Games.
CBS Video Games distributed the ports for the Atari 2600. For the port for the ColecoVision console, &quot;Gorf&quot; went through 39 changed before being accepted. Coleco&#x27;s product Evaulator, Jodi McIlroy, said that all these changes were relatively small as they were trying to make it just right before releasing it.

&quot;Gorf&quot; was released for the Atari 2600 in December 1982.
In 1983, Coleco published a version of &quot;Gorf&quot; for the ColecoVision in May while CBS published a version for the Atari 5200 in October.

In late 1982, CBS Video Games announced plans to release &quot;Gorf&quot; for the Intellivision in early 1983. The game was ported also ported to the BBC Micro, and VIC-20 by multiple developers between 1982 and 1983.

Fenton said that &quot;Galaxian&quot; was the first game Bally had lost rights to and suggested that this was the reason why ports of the game had not included the &quot;Galaxians&quot; level. The Commodore 64 port is the only one with synthesized speech—via the Magic Voice Speech module.

==Reception==
In the September 1981 issue of &quot;Play Meter&quot;, which reflected sales from July 3, &quot;Gorf&quot; made number one in &quot;Play Meter&quot; arcade charts. In the immediately preceding and following polls it was fifth and third, respectively. &quot;Gorf&quot; was described by Paul Drury in &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; as providing the distributor with its biggest arcade hit since &quot;Gun Fight&quot;. Fenton later described watching players smiling and continuously putting quarters into &quot;Gorf&quot; was &quot;better than any drug I&#x27;ve ever taken&quot;.

Reviewing the original arcade game, Mark S. Murley of &quot;Hi-Res Magazine&quot; said that the arcade version of &quot;&quot;Gorf&quot; is a powerful game, if for no other reason than the pace of the action. Many veterans of popular arcade games like &quot;Defender&quot; (1981) and &quot;Tempest&quot; quickly fall by the wayside when faced with &quot;the intensity of the various attacking buguboos&quot; in &quot;Gorf&quot;. In an overview of similar games that have followed the release of &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, the &quot;The Winona Daily News&quot; stated that it has been surpassed by similar games such as &quot;Astro Invader&quot; (1979) and &quot;Galaxian&quot; (1979), while concluding that &quot;the tops in the post-Invader generation may be &quot;Gorf&quot;&quot;.

Commenting on the arcade cabinet and device itself, Frank Seninsky of &quot;Play Meter&quot; considered the physical arcade and hardware as not being a well built arcade console, describing it as &quot;slapped together&quot;. Seninsky reported that arcade operators had service problems with the machine due to the large joystick which could bang the cabinet forward back and into a wall. The reviewer in the magazine found the machine&#x27;s art unattractive, finding the gray paint work on it was &quot;one step better than using white&quot; and the side decals arrived to arcades had chipped edges and bubbles underneath and were peeling off in a few days at an arcade location. In 1984, Academic Thomas A. DeFanti of the University of Illinois Chicago described joystick in &quot;Gorf&quot; as &quot;generally accepted as the best joystick&quot; finding its unique shape had combated players receiving temporary indentations on them from the knobs featured on most joysticks of the period.

===Ports===

For the Atari 2600 port of the game, &quot;Hi Res Magazine&quot; found the game to be a &quot;competent, de-frilled edition of &quot;Gorf&quot;&quot;, noting that it was missing elements of the arcade game, such as the scrolling message at the beginning of the game, the force field in the first level and removes a number of prompts and messages seen in the arcade game. A reviewer in &quot;The Video Game Update&quot; said that while it was not possible to port all the details from the arcade game, the developers had developed a game that played well and ultimately recommended the release. &quot;Video Games&quot; dismissed the release, noting weak challenge and graphics concluding that &quot;this cartridge truly is a dog.&quot; &quot;Electronic Fun with Computers &amp; Games&quot; said the game was not great and that its first level was a shameless rip-off of &quot;Space Invaders&quot;.

The ColecoVision version of the game, &quot;Electronic Games&quot; called it &quot;perhaps the best home edition of &quot;Gorf&quot; to date&quot; while finding its sound effects were not up to par with the arcade version. &quot;The Video Game Update&quot; also praised this port, specifically highlighting the graphics noting you could make out &quot;smiles on the faces of some invaders&quot;.

For home computers, Charlene Komar of &quot;Electronic Games&quot; said many games for the VIC-20 were &quot;not too original or exciting&quot;, while finding the VIC-20 port of &quot;Gorf&quot; to be one of the best games available for the computer noting its fast-paced gameplay. &quot;Electronic Fun with Computers &amp; Games&quot; echoed this finding that &quot;the only superiority on the part of the arcade game is that monstrous pistol-grip controller.&quot; Both the two previous reviewers and &quot;Ahoy!&quot; complimented the ports graphics. Mark S. Murley of &quot;Hi-Res Magazine&quot; said that the Atari 8-bit computer version of &quot;Gorf&quot; had &quot;survived the passage from the arcade to your home computer&quot; and that Roklan had done an exceptional job and that &quot;the look and feel of the game is superb; it stands firmly on its own as a competent and entertaining piece of software.&quot; Neil Harris of &quot;Commodore Power/Play&quot; said that along with &quot;Wizard of Wor&quot;, &quot;Gorf&quot; was one of the best video games yet. Harris said he was hesitant that the speech capabilities in the Commodore 64 version would make the game &quot;gimmicky&quot;, but said it enhanced the enjoyment of both games.

The Atari 2600 version of the game received a Certificate of Merit in the category of &quot;Best Solitaire Video Game&quot; at the 4th annual Arkie Awards, and received the &quot;1984 Best Computer Game Audio-Visual Effects&quot; award at the 5th Arkies the following year. At the 5th Arkies, the judges indicated that the Atari versions had out-polled both the ColecoVision and Commodore 64 versions of the game, and they suggested it is the game&#x27;s &quot;varied action&quot; which &quot;keeps players coming back again and again&quot;.

===Retrospective===

Some retrospective reviews of the original arcade game complimented the innovations the game. Earl Green of the online game database AllGame wrote that the speech synthesis and colorful graphics as the highlights of &quot;Gorf&quot;, and that it was &quot;historically important for being the first-ever multi-level arcade game&quot;. Spanner Spencer of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; 
praised the game for its varied gameplay, and &quot;revolutionary concepts like digitized speech (that never shuts up, but does add to the sci-fi atmosphere superbly) and the option to buy extra lives as well as extra credits&quot;

In his book &quot;The Video Game Guide&quot; (2013), author Matt Fox found the game too derivative of other similar arcade games of the era, specifically &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, &quot;Galaxian&quot;, as well as &quot;Tempest&quot; (1981) and &quot;Phoenix&quot; (1980).

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (2006) included the game in their list of the Top 200 Best Games of All Time in 2006.

==Legacy==
Along with &quot;Stratovox&quot; (1980), &quot;Taskete&quot; (1980), and &quot;Berzerk&quot; (1980), &quot;Gorf&quot; was one of the earliest video games with speech synthesis in arcade games.

Fenton&#x27;s next game, &quot;The Adventures of Robby Roto!&quot; (1981) was not as successful financially in the arcades. This led to her to work on a sequel to &quot;Gorf&quot;.
Fenton began developing a sequel titled &quot;Ms. Gorf&quot; that was coded in Forth. She used two Z80-based computers, with each handling the games code and animation respectively. The game was ultimately cancelled. Fenton described the unreleased game as &quot;like a game you create as you play it&quot;, saying it featured levels where the ship was like a paintbrush, and could create obstacles on the playfield that would speed or slow the player down player. Fenton described the game had a few levels that &quot;weren&#x27;t well defined. It never really came together as a whole narrative the way &quot;Gorf&quot; did.&quot; The code for &quot;Ms. Gorf&quot; exists on 8&quot; floppy disks labeled &quot;RIP Ms. GORF 6/82 - 8/83&quot;. A pinball table of &quot;Gorf&quot; was planned that would be a hybrid of the video game version of &quot;Gorf&quot; as well as being a pinball game. Fenton said that the project only got as far as developing a breadboard for it before the game got &quot;tied up in a patent battle&quot; and was never completed.

In 2006, 3D Stooges Software Studios released an unlicensed port of &quot;Gorf&quot; for the Atari Jaguar CD titled &quot;Gorf Classic&quot;. This version of the game is the only home version of &quot;Gorf&quot; that contains all the levels that were in the original arcade game. The release was listed as being among the best titles for the Atari Jaguar by &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; magazine in 2006 and &quot;Time Extension&quot; in 2023. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; wrote the release of &quot;Gorf Classic&quot; spurred the interest in an independent development scene for the Atari Jaguar.

<text>In mathematics, the Griess algebra is a commutative non-associative algebra on a real vector space of dimension 196884 that has the Monster group &quot;M&quot; as its automorphism group. It is named after mathematician R. L. Griess, who constructed it in 1980 and subsequently used it in 1982 to construct &quot;M&quot;. The Monster fixes (vectorwise) a 1-space in this algebra and acts absolutely irreducibly on the 196883-dimensional orthogonal complement of this 1-space.
(The Monster preserves the standard inner product on the 196884-space.)

Griess&#x27;s construction was later simplified by Jacques Tits and John H. Conway.

The Griess algebra is the same as the degree 2 piece of the monster vertex algebra, and the Griess product is one of the vertex algebra products.

<text>&#x27; (), &#x27; (), &#x27; (), &#x27; ( or  () is a Spanish legal term and concept. The word comes from Latin , an open space used as a market, tribunal and meeting place. The same Latin root is the origin of the French terms and , and the Portuguese terms and ; all of these words have related, but somewhat different meanings.

The Spanish term has a wide range of meanings, depending upon its context. It has meant a compilation of laws, especially a local or regional one; a set of laws specific to an identified class or estate (for example , comparable to a military code of justice, or , specific to the Roman Catholic Church). In many of these senses, its equivalent in medieval England would be the custumal.

In the 20th century, Francisco Franco&#x27;s regime used the term for several of the fundamental laws. The term implied these were not constitutions subject to debate and change by a sovereign people, but orders from the only legitimate source of authority, as in feudal times.

==Characteristics==


Fuero dates back to the medieval period: the lord could concede or acknowledge a &quot;fuero&quot; to certain groups or communities, most notably the Roman Catholic Church, the military, and certain regions that fell under the same monarchy as Castile or, later, Spain, but were not fully integrated into those countries.

The relations among &quot;fueros&quot;, other bodies of law (including the role of precedent), and sovereignty is a contentious one that influences government and law in the present day. The king of León, Alfonso V, decreed the Fuero de León (1017), considered the earliest laws governing territorial and local life, as it applied to the entire kingdom, with certain provisions for the city of León. The various Basque provinces also generally regarded their &quot;fueros&quot; as tantamount to a municipal constitution. This view was accepted by some others, including President of the United States John Adams. He cited the Biscayan &quot;fueros&quot; as a precedent for the United States Constitution. (Adams, &quot;A defense…&quot;, 1786) This view regards &quot;fueros&quot; as granting or acknowledging rights. In the contrasting view, &quot;fueros&quot; were privileges granted by a monarch. In the letter Adams also commented on the substantial independence of the hereditary Basque Jauntxo families as the origin for their privileges.

In practice, distinct &quot;fueros&quot; for specific classes, estates, towns, or regions usually arose out of feudal power politics. Some historians believe monarchs were forced to concede some traditions in exchange for the general acknowledgment of his or her authority, that monarchs granted fueros to reward loyal subjection, or (especially in the case of towns or regions) the monarch simply acknowledged distinct legal traditions.

In medieval Castilian law, the king could assign privileges to certain groups. The classic example of such a privileged group was the Roman Catholic Church: the clergy did not pay taxes to the state, enjoyed the income via tithes of local landholding, and were not subject to the civil courts. Church-operated ecclesiastical courts tried churchmen for criminal offenses. Another example was the powerful Mesta organization, composed of wealthy sheepherders, who were granted vast grazing rights in Andalusia after that land was reconquered by Spanish Christians from the Muslims (&quot;see Reconquista&quot;). Lyle N. McAlister writes in &quot;Spain and Portugal in the New World&quot; that the Mesta&#x27;s &quot;fuero&quot; helped impede the economic development of southern Spain. This resulted in a lack of opportunity, and Spaniards emigrated to the New World to escape these constraints.

==Aristocratic &quot;fueros&quot;==
During the Reconquista, the feudal lords granted &quot;fueros&quot; to some &quot;villas&quot; and cities, to encourage the colonization of the frontier and of commercial routes. These laws regulated the governance and the penal, process and civil aspects of the places. Often the &quot;fueros&quot; already codified for one place were granted to another, with small changes, instead of crafting a new redaction from scratch.

==Basque and Pyrenean &quot;fueros&quot;==
===Approach===
In contemporary Spanish usage, the word &quot;fueros&quot; most often refers to the historic and contemporary fueros or charters of certain regions, especially of the Basque regions. The equivalent for Occitan usage is &quot;fòr&quot;, applying to the northern regions of the Pyrenees.

The whole central and western Pyrenean region was inhabited by the Basques in the early Middle Ages within the Duchy of Vasconia. The Basques and the Pyrenean peoples—as Romance language replaced Basque in many areas by the turn of the first millennium—governed themselves by a native set of rules, different from Roman and Gothic law but with an ever-increasing imprint of them. Typically their laws, arising from regional traditions and practices, were kept and transmitted orally. Because of this oral tradition, the Basque-language regions preserved their specific laws longer than did those Pyrenean regions that adopted Romance languages. For example, Navarrese law developed along less feudal lines than those of surrounding realms. The Fors de Bearn are another example of Pyrenean law.

Two sayings address this legal idiosyncrasy: &quot;en Navarra hubo antes leyes que reyes,&quot; and &quot;en Aragón antes que rey hubo ley,&quot; both meaning that law developed and existed before the kings. The force of these principles required monarchs to accommodate to the laws. This situation sometimes strained relations between the monarch and the kingdom, especially if the monarchs were alien to native laws.

This tradition of &quot;laws before kings&quot; was enshrined in the legendary Fueros de Sobrarbe, claimed to have been enacted by king Iñigo Arista in the 850s in the pyrenean valley of Sobrarbe. Although a 13th-century fabrication, the &quot;Fueros de Sobrarbe&quot; were subsequently used as the legal foundation for most Navarrese and Aragonese &quot;Fueros&quot; from the 13th century onwards. They enshrined the traditional principle &quot;laws before kings&quot; both in Aragonese and Navarrese law, justified the right to rebel against illegal royal decisions, and legitimised the existence of specific institutions such as the Justicia de Aragón, designed to

===&quot;Fueros&quot; in the High and Late Middle Ages===
The Fueros de Sobrarbe first appear mentioned in the context of the ascension of the House of Champagne to the Navarrese throne. In 1234, when Theobald I of Champagne inherited the Navarrese throne from his uncle Sancho VII of Navarre, he was pressured by burgers and nobility alike to swear he would abide his decisions by customary law and honour their customary rights and privileges. As a result, Theobald I appointed a commission to codify said laws; this resulted in the first written general &quot;fuero&quot;, the Fuero General de Navarra, enacted in 1238 and which drew its legal foundation from the fabled &quot;Fueros of Sobrarbe&quot; to justify the king&#x27;s authority being subjected to the Fuero.

The accession of French lineages to the throne of Navarre brought a relationship between the king and the kingdom that was alien to the Basques. The resulting disagreements were a major factor in the 13th-century uprisings and clashes between different factions and communities, e.g. the borough wars of Pamplona. The loyalty of the Basques (the &quot;Navarri&quot;) to the king was conditioned on his upholding the traditions and customs of the kingdom, which were based on oral laws.

===Relations with the crown and rise of absolutism===


Ferdinand II of Aragon conquered and annexed Navarre between 1512 and 1528 (up to the Pyrenees). In order to gain Navarrese loyalty, the Spanish Crown represented by the Aragonese Fernando upheld the kingdom&#x27;s specific laws (&quot;fueros&quot;) allowing the region to continue to function under its historic laws, while Lower Navarre remained independent, but increasingly tied to France, a process completed after King Henry III of Navarre and IV of France died. Louis XIII of France failed to respect his father&#x27;s will to keep Navarre and France separate. All specific relevant legal provisions and institutions (Parliament, Courts of Justice, etc.) were devalued in 1620–1624, and critical powers transferred to the French Crown.

Since the high Middle Ages, many Basques had been born into the &quot;hidalgo nobility&quot;. The Basques had no uniform legal corpus of laws, which varied between valleys and seigneuries. Early on (14th century) all Gipuzkoans were granted noble status, several Navarrese valleys (Salazar, Roncal, Baztan, etc.) followed suit, and Biscaynes saw their universal nobility confirmed in 1525. Álava&#x27;s distribution of nobility was patchy but less widespread, since the Basque specific nobility only took hold in northern areas (Ayala, etc.). Biscaynes, as nobles, were theoretically excluded from torture and from the need to serve in the Spanish army, unless called for the defence of their own territory (&quot;Don Quixote&quot;&#x27;s character, Sancho Panza, remarked humorously that writing and reading and being &quot;Biscayne&quot; was enough to be secretary to the emperor). Other Basque regions had similar provisions.
The reach of the was not limited by the territory.
Biscayans in other parts of the Crown of Castile had extraterritoriality.
They could take the appellations in cases involving them to the (&quot;Biscay Hall&quot;) at the top court of Castile, the Chancillería de Valladolid (&quot;Court of last resort () of Valladolid&quot;).

The Castilian kings took an oath to comply with the Basque laws in the different provinces of Álava, Biscay and Gipuzkoa. These provinces and Navarre kept their self-governing bodies and their own parliaments, i.e. the &quot;diputaciones&quot; and the territorial councils/Parliament of Navarre. However, the prevailing Castilian rule prioritized the king&#x27;s will. In addition, the ever more centralizing absolutism, especially after the accession to the throne of the Bourbons, increasingly devalued the laws specific to regions and realms—Basque provinces and the kingdoms of Navarre and Aragon—sparking uprisings (Matalaz&#x27;s uprising in Soule 1660, regular &quot;Matxinada&quot; revolts in the 17-18th centuries) and mounting tensions between the territorial governments and the Spanish central government of Charles III and Charles IV, to the point of considering the Parliament of Navarre dangerous to the royal authority and condemning &quot;its spirit of independence and liberties.&quot;

Despite vowing loyalty to the crown, the Pyrenean Aragonese and Catalans kept their separate specific laws too, the &quot;King of the Spains&quot; represented a crown tying together different realms and peoples, as claimed by the Navarrese &quot;diputación&quot;, as well as the Parliament of Navarre&#x27;s last trustee. The Aragonese &quot;fueros&quot; were an obstacle for Philip II when his former secretary Antonio Pérez escaped the death penalty by fleeing to Aragon. The king&#x27;s only means to enforce the sentence was the Spanish Inquisition, the only cross-kingdom tribunal of his domains. There were frequent conflicts of jurisdiction between the Spanish Inquisition and regional civil authorities and bishops. Pérez escaped to France, but Philip&#x27;s army invaded Aragon and executed its authorities.

In 1714 the Catalan and Aragonese specific laws and self-government were violently suppressed. The Aragonese count of Robres, one strongly opposing the abolition, put it down to Castilian centralism, stating that the royal prime minister, the Count-Duke of Olivares, had at last a free rein &quot;for the kings of Spain to be independent of all laws save those of their own conscience.&quot;

The Basques managed to retain their specific status for a few years after 1714, as they had supported the claimant who became Philip V of Spain, a king hailing from the lineage of Henry III of Navarre. However, they could not escape the king&#x27;s attempts (using military force) at centralization (1719–1723). In the run-up to the Napoleonic Wars, the relations between the absolutist Spanish Crown and the Basque governing institutions were at breaking point. By the beginning of the War of the Pyrenees, Manuel Godoy took office as Prime Minister in Spain, and went on to take a tough approach on the Basque self-government and specific laws. Both fear and anger spread among the Basques at his uncompromising stance.

===The end of the &quot;fueros&quot; in Spain===
The 1789 Revolution brought the rise of the Jacobin nation state—also referred to in a Spanish context as &quot;unitarism&quot;, unrelated to the religious view of similar name. Whereas the French Ancien Régime recognized the regional specific laws, the new order did not allow for such autonomy. The jigsaw puzzle of fiefs was divided into &quot;départements&quot;, based on administrative and ideological concerns, not tradition. In the French Basque Country, what little remained of self-government was suppressed in 1790 during the French Revolution and the new administrative arrangement, and was followed by the interruption of the customary cross-border trade between the Basque districts (holding minor internal customs or duties), the mass deportation to the Landes of thousands of residents in the bordering villages of Labourd—Sara, Itxassou, Ascain—, including the imposition (fleetingly) of alien names to villages and towns—period of the National Convention and War of the Pyrenees (1793–1795).

Some Basques saw a way forward in the 1808 Bayonne Statute and Dominique-Joseph Garat&#x27;s project, initially approved by Napoleon, to create a separate Basque state, but the French invasive attitude on the ground and the deadlock of the self-government project led the Basques to find help elsewhere, i.e. local liberal or moderate commanders and public figures supportive of the &quot;fueros&quot;, or the conservative Ferdinand VII. The 1812 Spanish Constitution of Cadiz received no Basque input, ignored the Basque self-government, and was accepted begrudgingly by the Basques, overwhelmed by war events. For example, the 1812 Constitution was signed by Gipuzkoan representatives to a general Castaños wielding menacingly a sword, and tellingly the San Sebastián council representatives took an oath to the 1812 Constitution with the smell of smoke still wafting and surrounded by rubble.

During the two centuries since the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Era, the level of autonomy for the Basque regions within Spain has varied. The cry for &quot;fueros&quot; (meaning regional autonomy) was one of the demands of the Carlists of the 19th century, hence the strong support for Carlism from the Basque Country and (especially in the First Carlist War) in Catalonia and Aragón. The Carlist effort to restore an absolute monarchy was sustained militarily mainly by those whom the &quot;fueros&quot; had protected from the full weight of absolutism, due to their readiness to respect region and kingdom specific legal systems and institutions. The defeat of the Carlists in three successive wars resulted in continuing erosion of traditional Basque privileges.

The Carlist land-based small nobility (&quot;jauntxos&quot;) lost power to the new bourgeoisie, who welcomed the extension of Spanish customs borders from the Ebro to the Pyrenees. The new borders protected the fledgling Basque industry from foreign competition and opened the Spanish market, but lost opportunities abroad since customs were imposed on the Pyrenees and the coast.

===Echoes of the &quot;fueros&quot; after suppression in Spain===

After the First Carlist War, the new class of Navarre negotiated separately from the rest of Basque districts the &quot;Ley Paccionada&quot; (or &quot;Compromise Act&quot;) in Navarre (1841), which granted some administrative and fiscal prerogatives to the provincial government within Spain. The rest of the Basque districts managed to keep still for another 40 years a small status of self-government, definitely suppressed in 1876. The end of the Third Carlist War saw the Carlists strong in the Basque districts succumb to the Spanish troops led by King Alfonso XII of Spain and their reduced self-government was suppressed and converted into Economic Agreements. Navarre&#x27;s status was less altered in 1876 than that of Gipuzkoa, Biscay, and Álava, due to the separate agreement signed in 1841 by officials of the Government of Navarre with the Spanish government accepting the transformation of the kingdom into a Spanish province.

Despite capitulation agreements acknowledging specific administrative and economic prerogatives, attempts of the Spanish government to bypass them spread malaise and anger in the Basque districts, ultimately leading to the 1893–94 &quot;Gamazada&quot; uprising in Navarre. Sabino Arana bore witness to the popular revolt as a Biscayne envoy to the protests.

The enthusiasm raised by the popular revolt in Navarre against the breach of war ending agreements made a deep impact on Sabino Arana, who went on to found the Basque Nationalist Party in 1895, based in Biscay but aiming beyond the boundaries of each Basque district, seeking instead a confederation of the Basque districts. Arana, of a Carlist background, rejected the Spanish monarchy and founded Basque nationalism on the basis of Catholicism and &quot;fueros&quot; (&quot;Lagi-Zaŕa&quot;, as he called them in Basque, &quot;Old Law&quot;). The competitive, Carlist vision of fueros was laid out in 1915 by Eustaquio Echave-Sustaeta and in 1921 by Teodoro de Arana y Beláustegui.

The high-water mark of a restoration of Basque autonomy in recent times came under the Second Spanish Republic in the mid twentieth century. An attempt was made at restoring some kind of Basque self-government in the Statute of Estella, initially garnering a majority of the votes, but controversially failing to take off (Pamplona, 1932). Four years later and amid a climate of war, Basque nationalists supported the left-leaning Republic as ardently as they had earlier supported the right-wing Carlists (note that contemporary Carlists supported Francisco Franco). The defeat of the Republic by the forces of Francisco Franco led in turn to a suppression of Basque culture, including banning the public use of the Basque language.

The Franco regime considered Biscay and Gipuzkoa as &quot;traitor provinces&quot; and cancelled their &quot;fueros&quot;. However, the pro-Franco provinces of Álava and Navarre maintained a degree of autonomy unknown in the rest of Spain, with local telephone companies, provincial limited-bailiwick police forces (&quot;miñones&quot; in Alava, and Foral Police in Navarre), road works and some taxes to support local government.

The post-Franco Spanish Constitution of 1978 acknowledged &quot;historical rights&quot; and attempted to compromise in the old conflict between centralism and federalism by establishing a constitutional provision catering to historic Catalan and Basque political demands, and leaving open the possibility of establishing their own autonomous communities. The Spanish Constitution speaks of &quot;nationalities&quot; and &quot;historic territories&quot;, but does not define them. The term &quot;nationality&quot; itself was coined for the purpose, and neither Basques nor Catalans are specifically recognized by the Constitution.

After the 1981 coup d&#x27;état attempt and the ensuing passing of the restrictive LOAPA act, such possibility of autonomy got opened to whatever (reshaped) Spanish region demanded it (such as Castile and León, Valencia, etc.), even to those never struggling to have their separate identity recognized and always considering themselves invariably Spanish. The &quot;State of Autonomous Communities&quot; took the shape of administrative districts and was ambiguous as to the actual recognition of separate identities, coming to be known as &quot;café para todos&quot;, or &#x27;coffee for everyone&#x27;.

However, the provincial chartered governments (&quot;Diputación Foral&quot; / &quot;Foru Aldundia&quot;) in the Basque districts were restored, getting back significant powers. Other powers held historically by the chartered governments (&quot;Diputación&quot;) were transferred to the new government of the Basque Country autonomous community. The Basque provinces still perform tax collection in their respective territories, coordinating with the Basque/Navarrese, Spanish, as well as European governments.

Today, the act regulating the powers of the government of Navarre is the &quot;Amejoramiento del Fuero&quot; (&quot;Betterment of the Fuero&quot;), and the official name of Navarre is &quot;Comunidad Foral de Navarra&quot;, &quot;foral&quot; (&#x27;chartered&#x27;) being the adjectival form for &quot;fuero&quot;. The reactionary governmental party in Navarre UPN (2013) claimed during its establishment (1979) and at later times the validity and continuity of the institutional framework for Navarre held during Franco&#x27;s dictatorship (1936–1975), considering the present regional &quot;statu quo&quot; an &quot;improvement&quot; of its previous status.

==Private law==
While &quot;fueros&quot; have disappeared from administrative law in Spain, (except for the Basque Country and Navarre), there are remnants of the old laws in family law. When the Civil Code was established in Spain (1888) some parts of it did not run in some regions. In places like Galicia and Catalonia, the marriage contracts and inheritance are still governed by local laws. This has led to peculiar forms of land distribution.

These laws are not uniform. For example, in Biscay, different rules regulate inheritance in the &quot;villas&quot;, than in the country towns (&quot;tierra llana&quot;). Modern jurists try to modernize the foral family laws while keeping with their spirit.

==&quot;Fueros&quot; in Spanish America==
During the colonial era in Spanish America, the Spanish Empire extended &quot;fueros&quot; to the clergy, the &quot;fuero eclesiástico&quot;. The crown attempted to curtail the &quot;fuero eclesiástico&quot;, which gave the lower secular (diocesan) clergy privileges that separated them legally from their plebeian parishioners. The curtailment of the &quot;fuero&quot; has been seen as a reason why so many clerics participated in the Mexican War of Independence, including insurgency leaders Miguel Hidalgo and José María Morelos. Removal of the &quot;fuero&quot; was seen by the Church as another act of the Bourbon Reforms that alienated the Mexican population, including American-born Spaniards.

In the eighteenth century, when Spain established a standing military in key areas of its overseas territory, privileges were extended to the military, the &quot;fuero militar&quot;, which had an impact on the colonial legal system and society. The &quot;fuero militar&quot; was the first time that privileges extended to plebeians, which has been argued was a cause of debasing justice. Indigenous men were excluded from the military, and inter-ethnic conflicts occurred. The &quot;fuero militar&quot; presented some contradictions in colonial rule.

In post-independence Mexico, formerly New Spain, &quot;fueros&quot; continued to be recognized by the Mexican state until the mid-nineteenth century. As Mexican liberals gained power, they sought to implement the liberal ideal of equality before the law by eliminating special privileges of the clerics and the military. The Liberal Reform and the liberal Constitution of 1857&#x27;s abolition of those &quot;fueros&quot; mobilized Mexico&#x27;s conservatives, which fought a civil war, and rallied allies to their cause with the slogan &quot;religión y fueros&quot; (&quot;religion and privileges&quot;).

For post-independence Chile, the &quot;fuero militar&quot; also was an issue concerning the rights and privileges of citizenship.

<text>German submarine &quot;U-47&quot; was a Type VIIB U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; during World War II. She was laid down on 25 February 1937 at Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft in Kiel as yard number 582 and went into service on 17 December 1938 under the command of Günther Prien.

During &quot;U-47&quot;″s career, she sank a total of 31 enemy vessels, including the British battleship , and damaged nine more. &quot;U-47&quot; ranks as one of the most successful German U-boats of World War II.

&quot;U-47&quot; disappeared in March 1941, and the 45 crewmembers are presumed to have died. In 2016, one of the faulty torpedoes shot at HMS &quot;Royal Oak&quot; was found and identified. Her fate remains an unsolved mystery to this day. 

==Design==
German Type VIIB submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIA submarines. &quot;U-47&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two AEG GU 460/8-276 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-47&quot; was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and one C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty.

==Service history==

&quot;U-47&quot; carried out ten combat patrols and spent a total of 238 days at sea. She sank 31 enemy ships (totalling 162,769 GRT and 29,150 tons) and damaged eight more. Prior to her disappearance in March 1941, &quot;U-47&quot; lost one crewman, Heinrich Mantyk, who fell overboard on 5 September 1940.

===First patrol===
&quot;U-47&quot; was assigned to the 7th U-boat Flotilla on 17 December 1938, (the day she was commissioned). She was an operational boat in the 7th Flotilla for her entire career. &quot;U-47&quot; was sent to sea in a pre-emptive move before war broke out in September 1939; this move would enable her to engage enemy vessels as soon as the war began. She left for her first war patrol on 19 August 1939 (two weeks before the commencement of hostilities), from the port of Kiel. During her first patrol, she circumnavigated the British Isles and entered the Bay of Biscay to commence patrol of Area I. On 3 September, war was declared and &quot;U-47&quot; received orders to initiate hostilities against British ships, but none were encountered on the first day. News of the sinking of by reached Prien the following day, along with further orders to strictly adhere to the Submarine Protocol. The first ship encountered by &quot;U-47&quot; during the war was a neutral Greek freighter which Prien inspected but released unharmed. Two further neutral vessels were encountered and Prien declined to even stop them.

Just after dawn on 5 September, Engelbert Endrass – serving as first watch officer aboard &quot;U-47&quot; – spotted SS &quot;Bosnia&quot; zigzagging and in a darkened state. Prien surfaced and fired a single shot from his 88 mm deck gun to stop the ship but instead &quot;Bosnia&quot; made steam and began radioing an alert (&#x27;SSS&#x27;) along with its name and position. Prien then immediately fired an additional four rounds of which three hit the ship, prompting its crew to abandon ship. &quot;U-47&quot; rendered assistance to the crew of &quot;Bosnia&quot;, bringing them aboard the submarine and helping to set up a lifeboat which had capsized during the crew&#x27;s escape. A Norwegian vessel also arrived and took all of the survivors aboard. Following its departure, Prien fired a single torpedo which sank the ship with its load of sulfur almost immediately. The 2,407 GRT &quot;Bosnia&quot; became the second British vessel, and first freighter, sunk after &quot;Athenia&quot;.

It was later the next day when &quot;U-47&quot; encountered a larger British freighter, the 4,086 GRT SS &quot;Rio Carlo&quot;. Again, Prien opted to surface and initiate a gun attack on the merchant. While the &quot;Rio Carlo&quot; did stop moving, it nonetheless broadcast the submarine alert, prompting Prien to fire an ineffective warning shot. A further three shots from the deck gun were fired onto the bridge of &quot;Rio Carlo&quot;, upon which the broadcast ceased and the crew abandoned ship. Once the crew was away, Prien finished the vessel and sent its mixed cargo to the bottom with a single torpedo. While &quot;U-47&quot;″s crew was inspecting the lifeboats and ensuring the survivors had provisions, an aircraft appeared and &quot;U-47&quot; dived, departing the area and leaving the crew to others to rescue.

On 7 September, Prien encountered yet another British freighter, and once again initiated a surface attack on it. Attempting to escape, SS &quot;Gartavon&quot; broadcast the submarine alert, drawing fire from the deck gun. The mast and radio antenna were destroyed and the ship came about while the crew put into a lifeboat. Surprising Prien, the &quot;Gartavon&quot; crew had rigged the ship to get underway in an attempt to ram the attacking submarine. It began to make steam after its crew departed and Prien was forced to take emergency measures to avoid the vessel. After avoiding the abandoned &quot;Gartavon&quot;, Prien inspected the lifeboat and after its crew declined the offer to fetch a second lifeboat from the circling freighter, he left them; all of the crew survived. Prien refused to radio for assistance on account of the attempt to ram him. He returned to &quot;Gartavon&quot; and attempted to finish her as he had his previous victims, but the torpedo malfunctioned and Prien instead used the deck gun to wreck the ship and sink its cargo of iron ore.

During this first patrol, which ended with her arrival in Kiel on 15 September 1939, three vessels were sunk for a total of 8,270 GRT.

===Sinking of HMS &quot;Royal Oak&quot;===

On 8 October 1939, &quot;U-47&quot; began her second patrol. On 14 October 1939 (six days after leaving port), she succeeded in penetrating the Royal Navy&#x27;s primary base at Scapa Flow.
Although most of the Home Fleet was not at the base at the time, &quot;U-47&quot; managed to find a target, the battleship . Once she had spotted &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, she opened fire with her torpedoes. Her first two salvos did nothing more than sever an anchor chain. After reloading the bow tubes the last salvo of three torpedoes struck the British warship, causing severe flooding. Taking on a list of 15 degrees, her open portholes were submerged, worsening the flooding and increasing the list to 45 degrees; &quot;Royal Oak&quot; sank within 15 minutes with the loss of more than 800 men. Following the attack, Prien received the nickname &quot;Der Stier von Scapa Flow&quot; (&quot;The Bull of Scapa Flow&quot;); the emblem of a snorting bull was then painted on the conning tower of &quot;U-47&quot; and the image soon became the emblem of the entire 7th U-boat Flotilla. Prien was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross, the first sailor of a U-boat and the second member of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; to receive this decoration. The rest of the crew members were awarded the Iron Cross. Two other &quot;U-47&quot; crew members also earned the Knight&#x27;s Cross later on during World War II: the chief engineer (&quot;Leitender Ingenieur&quot;) Johann-Friedrich Wessels and 1st watch officer (&quot;I. Wachoffizier&quot;) Engelbert Endrass.

Many years later, in September 2002, one of the unexploded torpedoes that &quot;U-47&quot; had fired during the attack on &quot;Royal Oak&quot; rose to the surface from its resting place on the bottom. The unexploded torpedo, minus its warhead, gradually drifted towards the shore, where it was spotted by a crewman aboard the Norwegian tanker &quot;Petrotrym&quot;. A Royal Navy tugboat intercepted the torpedo, and after identifying it as having belonged to &quot;U-47&quot; 63 years earlier, EOD (explosive ordnance disposal) personnel discarded it a mile from shore.

===Third patrol===

Following a lavish celebration in Berlin for the sinking of HMS &quot;Royal Oak&quot; in which the crew members of &quot;U-47&quot; were received by Adolf Hitler and decorated, the boat returned to sea on 16 November 1939. Once the U-boat had left Kiel on 16 November, she headed out into the North Sea. After traveling around the British Isles into the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel, &quot;U-47&quot; sank a further three vessels, &quot;Navasota&quot; on 5 December, the Norwegian steamer MV &quot;Britta&quot; on 6 December and &quot;Tajandoen&quot; on 7 December. Following the sinking of &quot;Navasota&quot;, British destroyers briefly fired depth charges at the U-boat but she managed to safely evade the attack without any damage.

===Fourth patrol===
&quot;U-47&quot; left the port of Wilhelmshaven and began her fourth patrol on 11 March 1940. For 19 days, she roamed the North Sea in search of any Allied convoys. However, she only managed to torpedo the Danish steam merchantman &quot;Britta&quot; north of Scotland on 25 March. Following the sinking of &quot;Britta&quot;, &quot;U-47&quot; returned to Wilhelmshaven on 29 March.

===Fifth patrol===
&quot;U-47&quot;″s fifth patrol was her first one that resulted in no ships sunk. She left Wilhelmshaven on 3 April 1940, and headed once again out into the North Sea. While she did not sink any Allied vessels on her fifth patrol, around 19 April, she fired a torpedo aimed at the British battleship but the torpedo missed its target or failed to detonate upon impact. Several nearby destroyers attempted to sink the U-boat using depth charges but &quot;U-47&quot; managed to escape.

===Sixth patrol===
&quot;U-47&quot;″s sixth patrol was much more successful. Having left Kiel on 3 June 1940, she ventured out into the North Sea and operated off the southern coast of Ireland. Along with six other U-boats in Wolfpack Prien, she attacked Convoy HX 47 and sank the British SS &quot;Balmoralwood&quot; on 14 June. Within less than a month, the boat sank a further seven vessels, &quot;San Fernando&quot; on the 21st, &quot;Cathrine&quot; on the 24th, &quot;Lenda&quot; and &quot;Leticia&quot; on the 27th, &quot;Empire Toucan&quot; on the 29th, &quot;Georgios Kyriakides&quot; on the 30th, and on 2 July. The submarine returned to Kiel on 6 July after 34 days at sea and eight enemy vessels sunk.

===Seventh patrol===
&quot;U-47&quot;″s seventh patrol consisted of her travelling north of the British Isles and into the North Atlantic, south of Iceland. During a period of 30 days, she sank a total of six enemy vessels and damaged another. &quot;U-47&quot;″s first victory during her seventh patrol was the sinking of the Belgian passenger ship &quot;Ville de Mons&quot; on 2 September 1940. This was followed by the sinking of a British vessel, &quot;Titan&quot;, on 4 September and &quot;Gro&quot;, &quot;José de Larrinaga&quot;, and &quot;Neptunian&quot; on the 7th. On the 9th, &quot;U-47&quot; sank the Greek merchant ship &quot;Possidon&quot;, and on 21 September she damaged the British merchant ship &quot;Elmbank&quot;. Following these victories, on the 25th, &quot;U-47&quot; entered the French port of Lorient, which was now under German control following the decisive Battle of France.

===Eighth patrol===
&quot;U-47&quot;″s eighth patrol began on 14 October 1940 when she left her home port of Lorient. While her eighth patrol lasted ten days, she sank four enemy vessels and damaged a further two in only two days. On 19 October, &quot;U-47&quot; damaged the British vessel &quot;Shirak&quot; and sank &quot;Uganda&quot; and &quot;Wandby&quot;, both of which were British registered. The next day, the U-boat damaged the British vessel &quot;Athelmonarch&quot; and sank &quot;La Estancia&quot; as well as &quot;Whitford Point&quot;. She returned to port three days later on 23 October.

===Ninth patrol===
&quot;U-47&quot; left her home port of Lorient on 3 November 1940 and moved out into the North Atlantic in search of Allied convoys. During her ninth patrol, she damaged three ships, &quot;Gonçalo Velho&quot;, &quot;Conch&quot; and &quot;Dunsley&quot;, and sank &quot;Ville d´Arlon&quot;. &quot;U-47&quot; returned to Lorient for the last time on 6 December. On her return Kretschmer presented Adolf Hitler with a lifebelt from &quot;Conch&quot; which &quot;U-47&quot; had damaged.

===Disappearance===
&quot;U-47&quot; departed Lorient on her tenth and last patrol on 20 February 1941. She went missing on 7 March 1941 and was believed at the time to have been sunk by the British destroyer west of Ireland, when a submarine was attacked by &quot;Wolverine&quot; and . Postwar assessment showed that the boat attacked there was , which was only damaged. HMS &quot;Wolverine&quot; had made an earlier attack on a submarine at 0510 hrs, 5 minutes after &quot;U-47&quot;&#x27;s last known torpedo attack on the Whale Factory ship &quot;Terje Viken&quot;. Nothing further was heard from &quot;U-47&quot; after this time. To date, there is no official record of what happened to &quot;U-47&quot;, although a variety of other possibilities exist, including mines, a mechanical failure, a victim of her own torpedoes, or possibly a later attack that did not confirm any claims by the corvette team of and . &quot;U-47&quot; had a crew of 45 officers and men during her last North Atlantic patrol in early 1941, all of whom were presumed to have died.

===Wolfpacks===
&quot;U-47&quot; took part in one wolfpack, namely: Prien (12–17 June 1940).

==Summary of raiding history==


During her service in the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, &quot;U-47&quot; sank 30 commercial ships totalling and one warship of 29,150 tons; she also damaged eight commercial ships totalling and one warship of 10,035 tons.

<text>A zarf (plural: zarfs, zarves; ; Arabic: ) is a cup holder, usually of ornamented metal, for a coffee cup without a handle (demitasse or ).

==History==

Although coffee was probably discovered in Ethiopia, it was in Turkey around the 13th century that it became popular as a beverage. As with the serving of tea in China and Japan, the serving of coffee in Turkey was a complex, ritualized process. It was served in small cups without handles (known as &quot;fincan&quot;, pronounced /finˈd͡ʒan/), which were placed in holders known as &quot;zarf&quot; (from the ; plural , meaning &quot;container&quot; or &quot;envelope&quot;) to protect the cup and also the fingers of the drinker from the hot liquid. 

Cups were typically made of porcelain, but also of glass and wood. However, because the holder was more visible, it was typically more heavily ornamented.

When coffee began to be served in cardboard cups in the late 20th century, the zarf became disposable as well. The corrugated coffee cup sleeve was invented in 1991.

==Styles==

The zarf was often made from metal, with silver, gold, copper, and brass being the most common materials used. Others were also made of woods such as coconut, ebony or other hardwoods, or of ivory, bone, horn, or tortoiseshell. Today, &quot;zarf&quot; can be the name of a cardboard coffee cup sleeve.

Metal zarfs were sometimes filigreed, decorated with chasing, niello, engraving, or set with precious stones.

Sets of zarfs, decorated with enamel and gems, were popular across the Islamic world. During the 19th century, Enamel workshops in Geneva produced large quantities of zarf sets for this market. These were decorated with brightly coloured enamel and motifs that included musical instruments or military trophies.

Wooden zarfs, of which very few remain, were favored because of the natural aroma of the wood from which they were fashioned. They were very fragile.

Tortoiseshell, horn and ivory zarfs required special skill to make. In the first two cases, sheets of the material in question were softened in hot water and then clamped in a mold to create the required shape. Ivory was carved in the same way as wood; however, its greater value meant that more care was needed to avoid mistakes.

<doc id="728628" wikidata="Q1429863" url="?curid=728628" title="Thymoma">
<text>A thymoma is a tumor originating from the epithelial cells of the thymus that is considered a rare neoplasm. Thymomas are frequently associated with neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis; thymoma is found in 20% of patients with myasthenia gravis. Once diagnosed, thymomas may be removed surgically. In the rare case of a malignant tumor, chemotherapy may be used.

==Signs and symptoms==
A third of all people with a thymoma have symptoms caused by compression of the surrounding organs by an expansive mass. These problems may take the form of superior vena cava syndrome, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), cough, or chest pain.

One-third of patients have their tumors discovered because they have an associated autoimmune disorder. As mentioned earlier, the most common of those conditions is myasthenia gravis (MG); 10–15% of patients with MG have a thymoma and, conversely, 30–45% of patients with thymomas have MG. Additional associated autoimmune conditions include thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity, pure red cell aplasia and Good syndrome (thymoma with combined immunodeficiency and hypogammaglobulinemia). Other reported disease associations are with acute pericarditis, agranulocytosis, alopecia areata, ulcerative colitis, Cushing&#x27;s disease, hemolytic anemia, limbic encephalopathy, myocarditis, nephrotic syndrome, panhypopituitarism, pernicious anemia, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, sensorimotor radiculopathy, &quot;stiff person syndrome&quot;, systemic lupus erythematosus and thyroiditis.

One-third to one-half of all persons with thymoma have no symptoms at all, and the mass is identified on a chest X-ray or CT/CAT scan performed for an unrelated problem.

==Pathology==
Thymoma originates from the epithelial cell population in the thymus, and several microscopic subtypes are now recognized. There are three principal histological types of thymoma, depending on the appearance of the cells by microscopy:

* Type A if the epithelial cells have an oval or fusiform shape (less lymphocyte count);
* Type B if they have an epithelioid shape (Type B has three subtypes: B1 (lymphocyte-rich), B2 (cortical) and B3 (epithelial).);
* Type AB if the tumor contains a combination of both cell types.

Thymic cortical epithelial cells have abundant cytoplasm, vesicular nucleus with finely divided chromatin and small nucleoli and cytoplasmic filaments contact adjacent cells.
Thymic medullary epithelial cells in contrast are spindle shaped with oval dense nucleus and scant cytoplasm
thymoma if recapitulates cortical cell features more, is thought to be less benign.

==Diagnosis==

When a thymoma is suspected, a CT/CAT scan is generally performed to estimate the size and extent of the tumor, and the lesion is sampled with a CT-guided needle biopsy. Increased vascular enhancement on CT scans can be indicative of malignancy, as can be pleural deposits. Limited biopsies are associated with a very small risk of pneumomediastinum or mediastinitis and an even-lower risk of damaging the heart or large blood vessels. Sometimes thymoma metastasize for instance to the abdomen.

The diagnosis is made via histologic examination by a pathologist, after obtaining a tissue sample of the mass. Final tumor classification and staging is accomplished pathologically after formal surgical removal of the thymic tumor.

Selected laboratory tests can be used to look for associated problems or possible tumor spread. These include: full blood count, protein electrophoresis, antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor (indicative of myasthenia), electrolytes, liver enzymes and renal function.
===Staging===
The Masaoka Staging System is used widely and is based on the anatomic extent of disease at the time of surgery:

* I: Completely encapsulated
* IIA: Microscopic invasion through the capsule into surrounding fatty tissue
* IIB: Macroscopic invasion into capsule
* III: Macroscopic invasion into adjacent organs
* IVA: Pleural or pericardial implants
* IVB: Lymphogenous or hematogenous metastasis to distant (extrathoracic) sites

==Treatment==
Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for thymoma. If the tumor is apparently invasive and large, preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy may be used to decrease the size and improve resectability, before surgery is attempted. When the tumor is an early stage (Masaoka I through IIB), no further therapy is necessary. Removal of the thymus in adults does not appear to induce immune deficiency. In children, however, postoperative immunity may be abnormal and vaccinations for several infectious agents are recommended. Invasive thymomas may require additional treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and cisplatin).. Recurrences of thymoma are described in 10-30% of cases up to 10 years after surgical resection, and in the majority of cases also pleural recurrences can be removed. Recently, surgical removal of pleural recurrences can be followed by hyperthermic intrathoracic perfusion chemotherapy or intrathoracic hyperthermic perfused chemotherapy (ITH).

==Prognosis==
Prognosis is much worse for stage III or IV thymomas as compared with stage I and II tumors. Invasive thymomas uncommonly can also metastasize, generally to pleura, bones, liver or brain in approximately 7% of cases. A study found that slightly over 40% of observed patients with stage III and IV tumors survived for at least 10 years after diagnosis. The median age of these patients at the time of thymoma diagnosis was 57 years. 

Patients who have undergone thymectomy for thymoma should be warned of possible severe side effects after yellow fever vaccination. This is probably caused by inadequate T-cell response to live attenuated yellow fever vaccine. Deaths have been reported.

==Epidemiology==
The incidence of thymomas is around 0.13-0.26 per 100,000 people per year. Males are affected slightly less frequently than females. The typical age at diagnosis is in the 40s and 50s, though the age may range from six years to 83 years.
