<text>The Mossi or Mosi are a Gur ethnic group native to modern Burkina Faso, primarily the Volta River basin. The Mossi are the largest ethnic group in Burkina Faso, constituting 52% of the population, or about 11.1 million people. The other 48% of Burkina Faso&#x27;s population is composed of more than 60 ethnic groups, mainly the Gurunsi, Senufo, Lobi, Bobo, Bissa and Fulani. The Mossi speak the Mòoré language.

==History==
The Mossi people originated in Burkina Faso, although significant numbers of Mossi live in neighboring countries, including Benin, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, and Togo. In 2022, the estimated population of Burkina Faso was 20M+, over 11M of which are Mossi. Another 2 million Mossi live in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire.

===Origins===
According to oral tradition, the Mossi come from the marriage of a Mamprusi/Dagomba princess, Yennenga, and a Mandé hunter.

Yennenga was a warrior princess, daughter of a king, Naa Gbewaa, of present-day northern Ghana. Gbewaa&#x27;s tomb is located in Pusiga in the Upper East Region of Ghana. The story has it that while exploring her kingdom on horseback, she lost her way and was rescued by Rialé, a solitary Mandé hunter. They got married and gave birth to a son, Ouedraogo, who is recognised as the father of Mossi people.

===Mossi Empire===

Though Mossi records exist, primarily written using the Ajami script, the Mossi people&#x27;s history has largely been kept by oral tradition. This means it is impossible to assign precise origin dates. Nevertheless, historians assign the beginning of their existence as a state to the 11th century. The Mossi were able to conquer a vast amounts of territory thanks to their mastering of the horse, created a prosperous empire, and kept peace in the region until the Mossi Kingdoms were conquered by the French. The expansion of the Mossi empire was stopped in the 19th century with the initiation of intensive colonisation by the French.

===Colonial era===
French rule affected Mossi society and weakened the power of the Mossi emperor, the &quot;Mogho Naaba&quot;. Despite colonization, the Mogho Naaba was given some authority over the Mossi during the French colonial period. He is consulted today for crucial decisions, especially those affecting the destiny of society. Two great events have affected the status of the Mogho Naaba during colonization:

* During the initial phase of the French invasion, he retired to the Mamprusi kingdom with which the Mossi have always kept brotherly relations.
* In 1896, the Mogho Naaba accepted the French protectorate.

The Mossi and several other peoples played a significant role in France&#x27;s military during World War II. They constituted part of the corps in the military troops of French West Africa, known in French as the &quot;Tirailleurs Sénégalais&quot;.

==Organization of Mossi society==
The Mossi people have organised their society in an original hierarchic process in which family and state are the key elements. The Mossi people are very heterogeneous. When horsemen invaded from the south they created a political or ruling class, called Nakomse (sing. Nakoambga), and a spiritual class called Tengabisi. All chiefs come from the ruling class. The Tengabisi include Saya (smiths), Nyonyose (farmers), Yarse (weavers and merchants), and others.

The origins of the Nyonyose are diverse: In the north their ancestors were Dogon and Kurumba, in the southwest their ancestors were Lela, Nuna, Sisala and others, and in the far east they were Gurmantche. These people were united into a new ethnicity called Mossi in about 1500.

It is a mistake to describe a &quot;Nyonyosé tribe&quot; or the &quot;art of the Nyonyosé&quot; because the Nyonyose do not exist outside Mossi society. All Nyonyosé are Mossi. At the same time, it is a mistake to assume that all segments of Mossi society are culturally identical, for the differences between the Nakomsé and the Tengabisi are striking; only the Tengabisi use masks, and only the Nakomsé use figures in the context of political celebrations. The Nakomse are the political class, and the Tengabisi are the spiritual class.

===Mogho Naaba and the Nakomse===

The highest position in Mossi society is that of the Mogho Naaba, who is given executive power. The Mogho Naaba&#x27;s role is to rule the entire population and to protect the kingdom. Today, he lives in Ouagadougou, the historical capital of the Mossi Empire and present capital of Burkina Faso. Though the political dynamic of the country has changed, the &quot;Mogho Naaba&quot; is recognised by his people and has substantial authority.
Second to the Mogho Naaba come the nobles, &quot;Nakomse&quot; (“people of power”; sing. Nakoambga), who all are from the family of the Mogho Naaba, whether they be brothers, sisters, cousins, or otherwise. All dignitaries come from the Mogho Naaba&#x27;s family. The Nakomse are often assigned territories in the kingdom as governorships and rule in the name of the Mogho Naaba. As in the past, the Mogho Naaba needs the support of the “ancient ones”, his &quot;Nyon-nyonse&quot; (or &quot;gnon-gnon-sse&quot;) subjects to fully exercise his power. The &quot;Nyon-nyonse&quot; are the peoples who lived in Mossi-controlled regions before the Mossi.

Mossi society is divided vertically into two major segments: the descendants of the horsemen who conquered the peoples on the Mossi plateau are called the &quot;Nakomse&quot;, and all Mossi Napa&#x27;s (kings) come exclusively from the &quot;Nakomse&quot; class. These people use figures as political art to validate their rule over the peoples they conquered. The descendants of the ancient farming peoples who had occupied the land from the beginning of time and who, by right of first occupation, were and are the owners of the land are called the &quot;Tengabisi&quot; (“people of the earth”). These Tengabisi can be further divided into groups of smiths (&quot;Saya&quot;), groups of traders (&quot;Yarse&quot;) and, most important, groups of farmers (&quot;Nyonyose&quot;). Generally the smiths and the traders do not use masks, but the &quot;Nyonyose&quot; are the principal makers and users of masks in Mossi society.

===Craftsmen and ordinary citizens===

They constitute the larger part of the population and are all subjects of the emperor. These two groups are generally fused but have internal subdivisions, each one having its own ruling family; they perform ceremonies and other important events. Mossi people often identify with groups; hence, at all levels, there is a hierarchy in Mossi society. In everyday life, the family hierarchy is most important, and family is often directly associated with the notion of hierarchy for the Mossi.

&#x27;Mogonaba&#x27; was what Leo Frobenius was told was the appropriate term for the emperor of Mossi at Wagadugu when he visited the country in 1904–6. His is one of the few disinterested reports as he was an anthropologist and not a missionary, representative of a European company, or military. He describes a court much like a European one (he may have an anti-aristocratic bias) with nobles in intrigues over commerce, power and industry. This report alone caused disbelief in Europe as no European source had ever considered Africans to be socially like Europeans. The lack of racism in Frobenius&#x27; report and his discovery of an industrious people and what some would describe as a glorious past interested W.E.B. Du Bois in Frobenius&#x27; other writings on Africa. Rudolf Blind&#x27;s translation in English of the &quot;Voice of Africa,&quot; published by Hutchinson &amp; Co., produced some racist comments he thought necessary to conform with English sensitivities — otherwise he believed no Englishman would consider the book realistic.

An important contribution was made in the 1960s by the historian Elliott P. Skinner, who wrote at length about the sophistication of Mossi political systems in &quot;The Mossi of the Upper Volta: The Political Development of a Sudanese People.&quot; This was at a time when many African countries were gaining independence, and Skinner strongly made the point that African peoples were very clearly qualified to govern themselves.

==Language and cultural values==
Group identity and values within the Mossi and contrasted against other ethnic groups are tied first and foremost to language.

===Mossi language===

The Mossi speak the Mooré language, of the Western Oti-Volta group of languages, northwestern sub-group. It is spoken in Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Ivory Coast. This language group is part of a larger grouping, Gur languages belonging to the Niger–Congo family. In the language there are a few dialects based mainly on region. For example, there is a dialect spoken in Yatenga (Ouahigouya), another distinct dialect in the northern region, a third in the southeast in Koupela, different from a fourth dialect in the same region called Tenkodogo. Despite these regional differences, the dialects are mutually intelligible.

===Cultural values===
According to the explanations of Marie Tapsoba, the former Cultural Counsellor at Burkina Embassy in Senegal and Mossi herself, Mossi culture can be divided into four main values characteristic of the ethnic group.

====Attitude towards ancestors====
Ancestors are believed to have reached a better world from which they can influence life on earth. They can help or punish their descendants depending on their behavior. Ancestors are also the judges that have the power to allow a descendant to enter the &quot;pantheon of the ancestors&quot;. If an ancestor chooses to deny entrance, the soul of the disavowed one is condemned to run at random for all eternity. Because of these beliefs, Mossi swear by their ancestors or by the land; when they do so (which only occurs in extreme situations), it is more than symbolic — it is a call to imminent justice.

====Land====
Land is related to the ancestors, being a path by which one can access the ancestors. Even today, this notion gives a unique value to land in Mossi thought. Land is considered to be much more than simple dust and has a spiritual dimension to it. A Mossi&#x27;s life depends on his/her land, and it is essential for the family settlement.

====Family====
Family is an essential cultural element of the Mossi, who hold collectivism in high regard. Individualism does not exist in traditional Mossi culture: one&#x27;s actions and behaviors are always taken to be characteristics of one&#x27;s family. They must always ask an elder in order to do something. As a result, all are expected to act in their family&#x27;s name; thus, the family is the smallest entity in the Mossi society. Heritage is patrilineal, passed down from a father to his sons. However, when a man has no sons, women can inherit from their husbands and even from their father.

====Hierarchy====
Hierarchy is a fundamental concept for the Mossi and pervasive in their culture. The family is organised like a kingdom with its king — the husband and father, his advisor — the wife, and the people — the children. Aunts and uncles play a role by helping in the education and raising of children.

==Traditional and cultural holidays and events==

Ceremonies and celebrations pace the life of Mossi people, with each celebration having its particulars. Through them the community expresses joy or suffering, or simply fulfills duties to the memory of the ancestors.

===Mogho Naaba court===
The Friday Mogho Naaba court ceremony derives from an event when the Moro Naba&#x27;s sister fled north to the land of Yadega, the kingdom called Yatenga. As she fled north, she carried all of the amulets of power, or &quot;nam&quot;, with her. The Moro Naba had to decide whether to follow her and retrieve his sacred power objects or to remain behind to rule over his people. Three times he left his palace to mount a white horse, and three times he returned to the palace. In the end he did not pursue his sister, and to this day the kings of Yatenga claim that they hold the power of Mossi rule.

The political segment of Mossi society, the Nakomse (sing. Nakoambga), use art to validate their rule. Bridles, saddles, stirrups and other objects associated with the horse are very important. In addition, Mossi chiefs use carved wooden figures to represent their royal ancestors. These figures are displayed each year at royal festivals called &quot;na possum,&quot; when the heads of each household in the community reaffirm their allegiance and loyalty to the chief.

===Mossi Masks===
The &quot;Nyonyose&quot; (the ancient farmers and spiritual segment of Mossi society) use masks in their religious observances and rituals. The &quot;Nakomse&quot; (chief class) do not use masks. Masks in initiations and funerals is typical of all the Voltaic or Gur-speaking peoples, including the Nyonyose, Lela, Winiama, Nouna, Bwaba, and Dogon. Masks appear at burials to observe on behalf of the ancestors that proper procedures are carried out. They appear at funeral or memorial services held at regular intervals over the few years after an elder has died. Masks attend to honor the deceased and to verify that the spirit of the deceased merits admission into the world of ancestors. Without a proper funeral, the spirit remains near the home and causes trouble for his/her descendants.

Masks are carved of the wood of the &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot;, the faux kapokier. They are carved in three major styles that correspond to the styles of the ancient people who were conquered in 1500 by the invading &quot;Nakomse&quot; and integrated into a new Mossi society:

* In the north masks are vertical planks with a round concave or convex face. 
* In the southwest masks represent animals such as antelope, bush buffalo, and strange creatures, and are painted red, white and black.
* In the east, around Boulsa, masks have tall posts above the face to which fiber is attached.

Female masks have two pairs of round mirrors for eyes; small masks, representing Yali (&quot;the child&quot;) have two vertical horns. All Nyonyose masks are worn with thick costumes made of the fiber of the wild hemp, &quot;Hibiscus cannabinus&quot;. In the old days only the northern Nyonyose in Yatenga and Kaya, and the eastern people around Boulsa allowed their masks to be photographed. The people in the southwest forbade photography because it did not conform to the &quot;yaaba soore&quot;, the path of the ancestors.

Mask characters include Balinga, the Fulani woman; &quot;katre&quot;, the hyena; &quot;nyaka&quot;, the small antelope; Wan pelega, the large antelope, and many others. Masks from all three areas appear at annual public festivals such as International Art &amp; Craft Fair (&quot;Salon international de l’Artisanat de Ouagadougou&quot; or SIAO), Week of the Culture, and the Atypical Nights of Koudougou (&quot;Les Nuits Atypiques de Koudougou&quot;). Each Nyonyose family has its own mask, and they are charged with protecting the masks to this day. Masks are very sacred and are a link to the spirits of ancestors and of nature.

<text>Loesje ( , ) is an international free speech organisation started in Arnhem (Netherlands) in 1983 and went international in 1989. Its charter is to spread creativity, positive criticism, ideas, philosophical ponderings and thoughts on current events by way of short slogans on posters. The posters are signed by Loesje, which is a Dutch female name, representing &quot;a world wide collective of people who want to make the world a more positive creative place&quot;.

It is not clear how many active writers there are and also the number of people who decide to spread the posters that can be downloaded from the poster archive. The organisation cannot keep track of who spreads posters and where, partly because it is impossible to see how often a poster is downloaded (or printed at home) from the website, and partly because Loesje is not responsible for any misdeeds of individuals who paste posters on places where it is illegal.

Between 2005 and 2013, Loesje&#x27;s international headquarters were located in Berlin, but since then Loesje International has moved back to Arnhem.

==Controversy==
While Loesje aims to write texts from a positive point of view, not all posters are always appreciated. In 2012, a local Loesje group in Amsterdam created a poster with the text &quot;to honour Friso let&#x27;s go binge-drinking on Queen&#x27;s Day&quot;. Prince Friso was at that moment in coma in the hospital in London. The Dutch Loesje office distanced itself from this text, which was only published in Amsterdam.

<text>War poetry is poetry on the topic of war. While the term is applied especially to works of the First World War, the term can be applied to poetry about any war, including Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, from around the 8th century BC as well as poetry of the American Civil War, the Spanish Civil War, the Crimean War and other wars. War poets may be combatants or noncombatants.

== Ancient times ==
&quot;The Iliad&quot; is an epic poem in dactylic hexameter which is believed to have been composed by Homer, a blind Greek Bard from Ionia. It is among the oldest surviving works of Western literature, believed to have begun as oral literature. The first written form is usually dated to around the 8th century BC. The &quot;Iliad&quot; is set during the ten-year siege of the polis of Troy (Ilium), ruled by King Priam and his sons Hector and Paris, by a massive army from a coalition of Greek states led by King Agamemnon of Mycenae.

The events between the cremation of Hector and the Fall of Troy are expanded upon in the 4th century epic poem &quot;Posthomerica&quot;, by Quintus of Smyrna. In pre-Islamic Persia, the war poem &quot;Ayadgar-i Zariran&quot; (&#x27;Memorial of Zarer&#x27;) was composed; it was preserved by Zoroastrian priests after the Muslim conquest of Persia. In its surviving manuscript form, &quot;The Memorial of Zarer&quot; represents one of the earliest surviving works of Iranian literature and the only surviving epic poem in Pahlavi. Historically, Iranian epic poems such as this one were composed and sung by travelling minstrels, who in pre-Islamic and Zoroastrian times were a fixture of Iranian society.

== Early medieval period ==
Ferdowsi&#x27;s 11th century &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (&quot;Book of Kings&quot;) retells the mythical and to some extent the historical past of the Persian Empire from the creation of the world until the Muslim conquest in the 7th century. It is one of the world&#x27;s longest epic poems created by a single poet, and the national epic of Greater Iran. The &quot;Shahnameh&quot; also contains many works of war poetry.
Armenia&#x27;s national epic, &quot;Sasna Tsrer&quot; (&quot;Daredevils of Sassoun&quot;), is set during the time of the invasion of Armenia by the Caliphate of Baghdad (about 670), and focuses on the resistance of four generations within the same family, which culminates with Armenian folk hero David of Sasun driving the Muslim invaders from Armenia. It was collected and written down from the oral tradition by Fr. Garegin Srvandztiants, a celibate priest of the Armenian Apostolic Church, in 1873. The epic was first published in Constantinople in 1874. It is better known as &quot;Sasuntsi Davit&quot; (&quot;David of Sasun&quot;).

The Old English poem &quot;The Battle of Maldon&quot;, which survives only in an unfinished fragment, celebrates the battle of the same name. The Battle of Brunanburh in 937 is also celebrated by an Old English poem of the same name in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, which in 1880 was translated into modern English, in a metrical mixture of Trochees and dactyls, by Alfred Tennyson. The anti-hero Egill Skallagrímsson of &quot;Egil&#x27;s Saga&quot;, attributed to the twelfth-century bard Snorri Sturluson, is portrayed as having fought in the Battle of Brunanburh in 937 as an elite mercenary soldier for Æthelstan. 

The foundational masterpiece of Welsh poetry, &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; (), tells how Mynyddog Mwynfawr, the King of Gododdin in the Hen Ogledd, summoned warriors from several other Welsh kingdoms and led them in a campaign against the Anglo-Saxons which culminated with the Battle of Catraeth around the year 600. The narrator names himself as Aneirin and professes to have been one of only two to four Welsh survivors of the battle. 

The Brussels Manuscript of the &quot;Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib&quot;, which is believed to have been written around 1635 by Franciscan friar and historian Mícheál Ó Cléirigh, contains many Irish war poems not found elsewhere. Like the other two surviving manuscripts, the Brussels Manuscript relates the wars between the Irish clans and the Norse and Danish invaders, and celebrates the ultimate rise to power of Brian Boru as High King of Ireland.

==High medieval period==
&quot;The Song of Dermot and the Earl&quot; is an anonymous Anglo-Norman verse chronicle written in the early 13th century in England. It retells the 1170 invasion of Ireland by Diarmait Mac Murchada, the wars that followed between the invaders and Haskulf Thorgilsson, the last Hiberno-Norse King of Dublin and Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, the last High King of Ireland, and the subsequent visit to Ireland by King Henry II of England in 1172. The chronicle survived only in a single manuscript which was re-discovered in the 17th century at Lambeth Palace in London. The manuscript bears no title, but has been commonly dubbed &quot;The Song of Dermot and the Earl&quot; since Goddard Henry Orpen published a diplomatic edition under this title in 1892.

&quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot; (&quot;Слово о пълкѹ Игоревѣ&quot;), an epic poem in Old East Slavic, describes a failed raid made in the year 1185 by an army led by Prince Igor Svyatoslavich of Novgorod-Seversk against the Polovtsians (Cumans), Pagan Turkic nomads living along the southern banks of the Don River. Since its 18th-century rediscovery in a 15th-century manuscript from Yaroslavl and 1800 publication by Aleksei Musin-Pushkin, &quot;The Lay&quot; has inspired other poems, art, music, and the opera &quot;Prince Igor&quot; by Alexander Borodin. It is claimed by Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians as a national epic. As the main characters of the poem came from modern Ukraine, &quot;The Lay&quot; has had a massive influence on Ukrainian literature. &quot;The Lay&quot; also captured the imagination of the intelligentsia during the Golden Age of Russian Poetry and has had a major influence on Russian literature and culture.

In 1375, Scottish Makar, or court poet, John Barbour completed the epic poem &quot;The Brus&quot;, which celebrates the deeds of Robert the Bruce, who led the Scottish people in their Wars of Independence against Kings Edward I and Edward II of England and who ultimately became King of Scotland. Around 1488, fellow Scottish Makar Blind Harry wrote the epic poem &quot;The Wallace&quot;, about the life and death of iconic Scottish nationalist Sir William Wallace. The events of the Scottish Wars of Independence are also a regular theme in the verse of Scotland&#x27;s national poet, Robert Burns.

The 15th-century poem &quot;Zadonschina&quot;, which draws upon the same tradition of Pre-Christian Slavic war poetry as &quot;The Tale of Igor&quot;, was composed to glorify the victory of Dmitri Donskoi, Great Prince of Moscow over Mamai and the Mongols of the Golden Horde at the Battle of Kulikovo along the Don River on 8 September 1380. The poem survives in six medieval manuscripts. The author of &quot;Zadonshchina&quot; is believed to have been Sofonii (Russian: Софоний). His name as the author of the text is mentioned in two surviving manuscript copies.

==Early modern period==

The Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513, in which an English army led by the Earl of Surrey defeated and killed King James IV of Scotland and gave no quarter to an estimated 12,000 nobles and commons recruited from both the Scottish Highlands and Lowlands, is sometimes considered the end of the Middle Ages in the British Isles. By far the most famous war poem about the battle is the poem in Scots, &quot;The Flowers of the Forest&quot; by Lady Jean Elliot. In 1755, Lady Jean published the lyrics anonymously and &quot;The Flowers of the Forest&quot; was at first thought to be an ancient ballad. However, Robert Burns suspected it was an imitation, and together with Ramsay and Sir Walter Scott eventually identified the author.

The 1566 Battle of Szigetvár, in which a vastly outnumbered army of 2,300 Croatian and Hungarian soldiers in service to the Habsburg monarchy and under the command of Nikola IV Zrinski, the Ban of Croatia, defended the Hungarian fortress of the same name against an enormous Ottoman army under the command of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, has thrice been made the subject of epic poetry.

The first epic poem about the Siege was composed in Croatian by the poet Brne Karnarutić of Zadar, titled &quot;Vazetje Sigeta grada&quot; (English: &quot;The Taking of the City of Siget&quot;), and posthumously published at Venice in 1584. Karnarutić is known to have based his account very heavily on the memoirs of Zrinski&#x27;s valet, Franjo Črnko. Karnarutić is known to have drawn further inspiration from Marko Marulić&#x27;s &quot;Judita&quot;.

In 1651, Hungarian poet Miklós Zrínyi, the great-grandson of Nikola Zrinski, published the epic poem &quot;Szigeti veszedelem&quot; (&quot;The Siege of Sziget&quot;). According to Encyclopædia Britannica Online, &quot;The Siege of Sziget&quot; is &quot;the first epic poem in Hungarian literature&quot; and &quot;one of the major works of Hungarian literature&quot;. Kenneth Clark&#x27;s &quot;Civilisation&quot; describes &quot;Szigeti veszedelem&quot; as one of the major literary achievements of the 17th century. Even though John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; is often credited with resurrecting Classical epic poetry, Milton&#x27;s poem was published in 1667, sixteen years after Zrínyi&#x27;s &quot;Szigeti Veszedelem&quot;.

Another Croatian nobleman warrior-poet Pavao Ritter Vitezović wrote about the Battle. His poem &quot;Odiljenje sigetsko&quot; (&quot;The Sziget Farewell&quot;), first published in 1684, reminisces about the event without rancour or crying for revenge. The last of the four cantos is titled &quot;Tombstones&quot; and consists of epitaphs for the Croatian and Turkish warriors who died during the siege, paying equal respect to both.

=== Thirty Years War ===
In her book &quot;The Real Personage of Mother Goose&quot;, author Katherine Elwes Thomas alleges that the English nursery rhyme &quot;The Queen of Hearts&quot; is about the events that caused the outbreak of the Thirty Years War. The King and Queen of Hearts are, according to Elwes Thomas, a thinly disguised description of Elector Palatine () Friedrich V and his wife Elizabeth Stuart. The Queen&#x27;s decision to bake tarts refers to her persuasion of her Calvinist husband to accept the Czech nobility&#x27;s offer of the throne of the Kingdom of Bohemia, after the local officials of &quot;The Knave of Hearts&quot;, the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II, were overthrown in a palace coup known as the Third Defenestration of Prague.

In German poetry, the Baroque anti-war sonnets of Andreas Gryphius remain well known. Gryphius made many enemies for himself by denouncing the destruction, suffering, and needless civilian casualties left behind by the private armies of both sides in both verse form and in prose. Gryphius&#x27;s first collection of poems, Sonnete (&quot;Sonnets&quot;), was published in 1637 by Wigand Funck in Lissa, and is accordingly known as the &quot;Lissaer Sonettbuch&quot;, after the town. The collection of 31 sonnets includes some of his best known poems, such as &quot;Vanitas vanitatum, et omnia vanitas&quot;, later titled &quot;Es ist alles eitel&quot; (All is vanity), about the effects of war and the transitoriness of human life; &quot;Menschliches Elende&quot; (Human misery); and &quot;Trawrklage des verwüsteten Deutschlandes&quot; (Lament of a Devastated Germany). In 1632, Gryphius had witnessed the pillaging and burning of the Silesian town of Freystadt by the Protestant troops of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. Gryphius immortalized the sack of the city in a detailed eyewitness account titled &quot;Fewrige Freystadt&quot;, which made him many enemies.

== 18th century ==

=== Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745 ===

In the song &quot;Là Sliabh an t-Siorraim&quot;, Sìleas na Ceapaich, the daughter of the 15th Chief of Clan MacDonald of Keppoch, sings of the joy upon the arrival of Prince James Francis Edward Stuart, the indecisive Battle of Sheriffmuir and the state of uneasy anticipation between the battle and the end of the Jacobite rising of 1715.

The most iconic poem by Sìleas, however, inspired by the events of the Uprising was only completed many years later. When Ailean Dearg, the Chief of Clan Macdonald of Clanranald had been mortally wounded at the Battle of Sherrifmuir, Alasdair Dubh, 11th Chief of Clan MacDonald of Glengarry rallied the faltering warriors of Clan Donald by throwing up his Highland bonnet and crying &quot;Buillean an-diugh, tuiream a-màireach!&quot; (&quot;Blows today, mourning tomorrow!&quot;). Following Alasdair Dubh&#x27;s death (c. 1721 or 1724), he was eulogized by Sìleas in the song-poem &quot;Alistair à Gleanna Garadh&quot;, which hearkens back to the mythological poetry attributed to Amergin Glúingel and which remains an iconic and oft imitated work of Scottish Gaelic literature.

In Scottish Gaelic literature, the greatest war poet of the Jacobite rising of 1745 is Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair, a tacksman from the Clanranald branch of Clan Donald. Jacobite songs penned by Alasdair such as: &quot;Òran Nuadh&quot; – &quot;A New Song&quot;, &quot;Òran nam Fineachan Gaidhealach&quot; – &quot;The Song of the Highland Clans&quot; and &quot;Òran do&#x27;n Phrionnsa&quot; – &quot;A Song to the Prince,&quot; serve as testament to the Bard&#x27;s passionate loyalty to the House of Stuart. According to literary historian John MacKenzie, these poems were sent to Aeneas MacDonald, the brother of the Clanranald tacksman of Kinlochmoidart. Aeneas read the poems aloud to Prince Charles Edward Stuart in English translation and the poems played a major role in convincing the Prince to come to Scotland and to initiate the Jacobite Rising of 1745.

Other poems about the Uprising were written in both Gaelic and English by John Roy Stewart, who served as colonel of the Edinburgh Regiment and a close and trusted confidant of Prince Charles Edward Stuart.

The Irish poem &quot;Mo Ghile Mear&quot;, which was composed by the County Cork Bard Seán &quot;Clárach&quot; Mac Domhnaill, is a lament for the defeat of the Uprising at the Battle of Culloden. The poem is a soliloquy by the Kingdom of Ireland, whom Seán Clárach personifies, according to the rules of the &quot;Aisling&quot; genre, as a woman from the Otherworld. The woman laments her state and describes herself as a grieving widow due to the defeat and exile of her lawful King.

Poems about the Jacobite rising of 1745 have also been written in English by Sir Walter Scott, Carolina Nairne, Agnes Maxwell MacLeod, Allan Cunningham, and William Hamilton. However, even as the British upper class and the literary world were romanticizing the Uprising and the culture of the Scottish clans, the suppression of Highland Scottish culture, which had begun after the rising&#x27;s defeat, continued for nearly two centuries afterward.

=== American Revolution ===
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s 1860 poem &quot;Paul Revere&#x27;s Ride&quot; both retells and fictionalizes the efforts of Boston silversmith Paul Revere to warn Patriot militia of an imminent attack by the British Army on the night before the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775. Longfellow&#x27;s poem was first published in the January 1861 issue of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; and later included as part of Longfellow&#x27;s 1863 poetry collection &quot;Tales of a Wayside Inn&quot;.

Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x27;s 1837 poem &quot;Concord Hymn&quot; pays tribute to the Patriot militia at the Battle of Concord and famously says that they fired, &quot;The shot heard round the world.&quot;

David Humphreys wrote the first sonnet in American poetry in 1776, right before he left Yale College to fight as a colonel in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Colonel Humphreys&#x27; sonnet was titled &quot;Addressed to my Friends at Yale College, on my leaving them to join the Army&quot;.

Among the earliest known Scottish Gaelic poets in North America, is Kintail-born Iain mac Mhurchaidh, a poet from Clan Macrae, who emigrated to Moore County in the Colony of North Carolina around 1774, fought as a Loyalist during the American Revolution, and composed Gaelic war poetry there until his death around 1780.

In 1783, the year that saw the end of the American Revolution and the beginning of the Highland Clearances in Inverness-shire, Cionneach mac Cionnich, a poet from Clan MacKenzie who was born at Castle Leather near Inverness, composed the only surviving Gaelic poem of the era which takes up the Patriot, rather than the Loyalist, banner - &quot;The Lament of the North&quot;. In the poem, MacCionnich mocks the Scottish clan chiefs for becoming absentee landlords, for both rackrenting and evicting their clansmen en masse in favor of sheep, and of &quot;spending their wealth uselessly&quot;, in London. He accuses King George III both of tyranny and of steering the ship of state into shipwreck. MacCionnich also argues that truth is on the side of George Washington and the Continental Army and that the Gaels would do well to emigrate from the Highlands and Islands to the United States before the King and the landlords take every farthing they have left.

==19th century==

=== Greece ===
During the early 19th century, Albanian Muslim bard Haxhi Shehreti composed the epic poem &quot;Alipashiad&quot;. The work is inspired by and named after Ali Pasha, the governor of the Pashalik of Ioannina in Ottoman Greece, describing, in heroic style, his life, and his military campaigns. The poem is written in Demotic Greek, which Shehreti considered a far more prestigious language than Turkish or Albanian. Historically, the &quot;Alipashiad&quot; is unique in Greek poetry due to its having been written from an Islamic point of view.

The Greek War of Independence raged from 1821 to 1830 and resulted in the independence of the Greek people after more than four hundred years of rule by the Ottoman Empire. The uprising and its many predecessors also produced many great composers of war poetry. In English poetry, Lord Byron is by far the most famous of these poets. Byron travelled to Greece during the fighting and joined the Greek rebels. Byron also glorified the Greek cause in many of his poems, which continued to be widely read.

Even though he was strangled inside Nebojša Tower in Belgrade by order of Sultan Selim III of the House of Osman in 1798 while planning a Greek uprising with the assistance of Napoleon Bonaparte, the nationalist verse of Rigas Feraios helped inspire the Greek War of Independence and he remains a major figure in Greek poetry. In his poems, Feraios urged the Greek people to leave the cities for the mountains and to fight in the mountains to gain their independence.

Dionysios Solomos, another poet of the Greek War of Independence, wrote the &quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot;, which is now the Greek national anthem, in 1823, just two years after the Greeks rose against the Ottoman Empire. It is also the national anthem of Cyprus, which adopted it in 1966. Solomos is considered to be the national poet of Greece.

=== Crimean War ===
Probably the most famous 19th-century war poem is Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, which he supposedly wrote in only a few minutes after reading an account of the battle in &quot;The Times&quot;. It immediately became hugely popular, even reaching the troops in the Crimea, where it was distributed in pamphlet form.

=== American Civil War ===

As the American Civil War was beginning, American poet Walt Whitman published his poem &quot;&quot; as a patriotic rally call for the North. Whitman volunteered for a time as a nurse in the army hospitals, and his collection &quot;Drum-Taps&quot; (1865) deals with his experiences during the War.

On 18 July 1863, &quot;Die Minnesota-Staats-Zeitung&quot;, a newspaper published by and for German-speaking Forty-Eighters living in Minnesota, printed &quot;An die Helden des Ersten Minnesota Regiments&quot; (&quot;To the Heroes of the First Minnesota Regiment&quot;), a work of German poetry in tribute to the Union soldiers of the 1st Minnesota Infantry Regiment and their iconic charge from Cemetery Ridge during the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg. The poet was G. A. Erdman of Hastings, Minnesota.

Also during the American Civil War, Edward Thomas, a Welsh-language poet whose Bardic name was Awenydd, enlisted in Company E of the 2nd Minnesota Cavalry Regiment. During his service in that Regiment, Thomas wrote many Welsh poems, including &quot;Pryddest ar Wir Fawredd&quot;.

On the Confederate side, the most well-known Civil War poet is Father Abram Ryan, a Roman Catholic priest and former military chaplain to the Confederate Army. Father Ryan, who eulogized the defeated South in poems like &quot;The Conquered Banner&quot; and &quot;The Sword of Lee&quot;, is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Poet-Priest of the Confederacy,&quot; and as &quot;The Poet Laureate of the South.&quot;

=== Boer War ===
Rudyard Kipling wrote poetry in support of the British cause in the Boer War, including the well-known &quot;Lichtenberg&quot;, which is about a combatant&#x27;s death in a foreign land. Swinburne, Thomas Hardy, and others wrote also poems relating to the Boer War. Hardy&#x27;s poems include &quot;Drummer Hodge&quot;, and &quot;The Man He Killed&quot;. &#x27;&quot;Swinburne regularly donated work to the papers to rouse the spirit, from &#x27;Transvaal&#x27;, with the infamous closing line, &#x27;Strike, England, and strike home&#x27;, to &#x27;The Turning of the Tide&#x27;.&quot;

During the last phase of the war in the former Orange Free State, the Afrikaner people of Winburg taunted the Scottish regiments in the local British Army garrison with a parody of the Jacobite ballad &quot;Bonnie Dundee&quot;, which was generally sung in English. The parody celebrated the guerrilla warfare of Boer Commando leader Christiaan De Wet.

==World War I==
Published poets wrote over two thousand poems about and during the war. However, only a small fraction still is known today, and several poets that were popular with contemporary readers are now obscure. An orthodox selection of poets and poems emerged during the 1960s, which often remains the standard in modern collections and distorts the impression of World War I poetry. This selection tends to emphasize the horror of war, suffering, tragedy and anger against those that wage war.
In a 2020 article for the &quot;St Austin Review&quot; about American WWI poet John Allan Wyeth, Dana Gioia writes, &quot;The First World War changed European literature forever. The horror of modern mechanized warfare and the slaughter of nineteen million young men and innocent civilians traumatized the European imagination. For poets, the unprecedented scale of violence annihilated the classic traditions of war literature – individual heroism, military glory, and virtuous leadership. Writers struggled for a new idiom commensurate with their apocalyptic personal experience. European Modernism emerged from the trenches of the Western Front.

&quot;British poetry especially was transformed by the trauma of trench warfare and indiscriminate massacre. The &#x27;War Poets&#x27; constitute an imperative presence in modern British literature with significant writers such as Wilfred Owen, Robert Graves, Siegfried Sassoon, David Jones, Ivor Gurney, Rupert Brooke, Edward Thomas, and Isaac Rosenberg. Their work, which combined stark realism and bitter irony with a sense of tragic futility, altered the history of English literature.
&quot;Similar cohorts of war poets occupy important positions in other European literature&#x27;s. French literature has Charles Peguy, Guillaume Apollinaire, and Blaise Cendrars (who lost his right arm at the Second Battle of Champagne). Italian poetry has Eugenio Montale, Giuseppe Ungaretti, and Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio. German poetry has Georg Trakl, August Stramm, and Gottfried Benn.

&quot;These scarred survivors reshaped the sensibility of modern verse. The Great War also changed literature in another brutal way; it killed countless young writers.&quot;
From the war itself until the late 1970s, the genre of war poetry was almost exclusively reserved for male poets. This was based on an idea of an exclusive authenticity limited to the works of those who had fought and died in the war. It excluded other forms of experience in the war, such as mourning, nursing and the home front, which were more likely to be experienced by other demographics such as women. There were over 500 women writing and publishing poetry during World War I. Examples of poems by female poets include Teresa Hooley&#x27;s &quot;A War Film&quot;, Jessie Pope&#x27;s &quot;War Girls&quot;, Pauline B. Barrington&#x27;s &quot;Education&quot;, and Mary H.J. Henderson&#x27;s &quot;An Incident&quot;. In addition to giving women greater access to work, the war also gave women greater artistic freedom and space to express their identities as artists.

Serbian World War I poets include: Milutin Bojić, Vladislav Petković Dis, Miloš Crnjanski, Dušan Vasiljev, Ljubomir Micić, Proka Jovkić, Rastko Petrović, Stanislav Vinaver, Branislav Milosavljević, Milosav Jelić, Vladimir Stanimirović. and others.

===Austria-Hungary===

Géza Gyóni, a Hungarian poet with twin beliefs in socialism and anti-militarism, had unhappily served in the Austro-Hungarian Army prior to the outbreak of war in 1914. In response, Gyóni had written the great pacifist poem, &quot;Cézar, én nem megyek&quot; (&quot;Caesar, I Will Not Go&quot;). According to Peter Sherwood, &quot;Gyóni&#x27;s first, still elated, poems from the Polish Front recall the 16th century Hungarian poet Bálint Balassi&#x27;s soldiers&#x27; songs of the marches, written during the campaign against the Turks.&quot; During the Siege of Przemyśl, Gyóni wrote poems to encourage the city&#x27;s defenders and these verses were published there, under the title, &quot;Lengyel mezőkön, tábortúz melett&quot; (&quot;By Campfire on the Fields of Poland&quot;). A copy reached Budapest by aeroplane, which was an unusual feat in those days. According to Erika Papp Faber, &quot;His leaning toward Socialism and his anti-militarist attitude were, for a brief time, suspended, as he was caught up in the general patriotic fervor at the outbreak of World War I. But once he experienced the horrors of war first hand, he soon lost his romantic notions, and returned to the more radical positions of his youth, as it evident in his further volumes.&quot; One of his poems from this period, &quot;Csak egy éjszakára&quot; (&quot;For Just One Night&quot;) became a prominent anti-war poem and its popularity has lasted well beyond the end of the First World War.

Georg Trakl, an Expressionist poet from Salzburg, enlisted in the Austro-Hungarian Army as a medical officer in 1914. He personally witnessed the Battle of Gródek, fought in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, in which the Austro-Hungarian Army suffered a bloody defeat at the hands of the Imperial Russian Army. Georg Trakl is best known for the poem &quot;Grodek&quot;.
, a Jewish poet who wrote in German from Podiebrad an der Elbe in the Kingdom of Bohemia, had enlisted in the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1913. On 4 November 1917, Janowitz died of wounds received at the Battle of Caporetto. Two years after his death, a volume of Janowitz&#x27;s war poems, &quot;Aus der Erde und anderen Dichtungen&quot; (&quot;Out of the Earth and Other Poems&quot;) was published in Munich. The first complete collection of his poems, however, came out only in 1992. According to Jeremy Adler, &quot;Franz Janowitz conflicts with the received idea of the best German war poets. Neither , nor ironic, nor properly expressionistic, while he excoriated the battlefield that the whole world had become, he still preserved a Faith in nobility, innocence, and song. Forced into maturity by the war, his poetic voice never lost a certain childlike note – indeed, in some of his best poems, naivety and wisdom coexist to an almost paradoxical degree. Such poetry was fired by a vision of a transcendental realm that lay beyond conflict, but never sought to exclude death. His 25 years, the last four of which were spent in the Army, scarcely left him time to develop a wholly independent voice, but his work displays an increasing mastery of form and deepening of vision. His small &quot;oeuvre&quot; consists of &quot;Novellen&quot;, essays, aphorisms, and a handful of the best German poems connected with the Great War.&quot;

===Germany===

August Stramm, who is considered the first of the expressionists, has been called by Jeremy Adler one of, &quot;the most innovative poets of the First World War.&quot; Stramm, Adler writes, treated, &quot;language like a physical material&quot; and, &quot;honed down syntax to its bare essentials.&quot; Citing Stramm&#x27;s fondness for &quot;fashioning new words out of old,&quot; Adler has also written that, &quot;what James Joyce did on a grand scale for English, Stramm achieved more modestly for German.&quot; Stramm&#x27;s war poetry was first published by Herwarth Walden in the avant-garde literary journal &quot;Der Sturm&quot; and later appeared in the collection &quot;Tropfenblut&quot; (&quot;Dripping Blood&quot;), which was published in 1919.
According to Patrick Bridgwater, &quot;While Stramm is known to have enjoyed his peacetime role of reserve officer, he was too sensitive to have any illusions about the war, which he hated (for all the unholy fascination it held for him). On 12 January 1915, he wrote to Walden from the Western Front, &#x27;I stand like a cramp, unsteady, without a foundation, without a brace, anchored, and numb in the grimace of my will and stubbornness,&#x27; and a few months later he wrote to his wife from Galicia that everything was so dreadful, so unspeakably dreadful. Thus while he was always absolutely sure where his duty lay, he did not write a single chauvinistic war poem even at the time when nearly everybody else in Germany - or so it seemed - was doing so. Nor did he write overtly anti-war poems, which his conscience would not have allowed him to do. In retrospect it seems extraordinary that the poem &quot;Feuertaufe&quot; (&quot;Baptism by Fire&quot;) should have caused a scandal in the German press in 1915, for its only conceivable fault is its utter honesty, its attempt to convey the feeling of coming under enemy fire for the first time and its implicit refusal to pretend that the feeling in question was one of heroic excitement.&quot;

Gerrit Engelke is best known for his anti-war poem &quot;An die Soldaten Des Grossen Krieges&quot; (&quot;To the Soldiers of the Great War&quot;), a poem in rhymed dactylic hexameter modeled after the Neo-Classical odes of Friedrich Hölderlin. In the ode, Engelke urges the soldiers of all the combatant nations to join hands together in universal brotherhood. An English translation exists by Patrick Bridgwater.
Walter Flex, who is best known as the author of the war poem &quot;Wildgänse rauschen durch die Nacht&quot; and the novella &quot;Der Wanderer zwischen Beiden Welten&quot;, was a native of Eisenach, in the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, and had attended the University of Erlangen. At the outbreak of the war, Flex was working as a private tutor to a family from the German nobility. Despite weak ligaments in his right hand, Flex immediately volunteered for the Imperial German Army. Owing to Flex&#x27;s idealism about the Great War, the posthumous popularity of his writing, and the iconic status that was attached to his wartime death, he is now considered Germany&#x27;s answer to Allied war poets Rupert Brooke and Alan Seeger.

Yvan Goll, a Jewish poet from Sankt Didel, in the disputed territory of Alsace-Lorraine, wrote bilingually in both German and French. At the outbreak of war in 1914, Goll fled to Zürich, in neutral Switzerland, to evade conscription into the Imperial German Army. While there, he wrote many anti-war poems, in which he sought to promote better understanding between Germany and France. His most famous war poem is &quot;Requiem. Für die Gefallenen von Europa&quot; (&quot;Requiem for the Dead of Europe&quot;).

Stefan George, a German poet who had done his literary apprenticeship with the French Symbolist poets during the Belle Époque in Paris, still had many friends in France and viewed the Great War as disastrous. In his 1916 anti-war poem &quot;Der Krieg&quot; (&quot;The War&quot;), George attacked the horrors that soldiers of all nations were facing in the trenches. In the poem, George famously declared, &quot;Der alte Gott der schlachten ist nicht mehr.&quot; (&quot;The ancient god of battles is no more.&quot;) In his 1921 collection &quot;Drei Gesänge&quot;, George returned to the same subject matter in his poems, &quot;An die Toten&quot; (&quot;To the Dead&quot;), &quot;Der Dichter in Zeiten der Wirren&quot; (&quot;The Poet in Times of Chaos&quot;), and &quot;Einen jungen Führer im Ersten Weltkrieg&quot; (&quot;To a Young Officer of the First World War&quot;).

Reinhard Sorge, the Kleist Prize winning author of the Expressionist play &quot;Der Bettler&quot;, saw the coming of the war as an idealistic recent convert to the Roman Catholic Church. Sorge wrote many poems, many of which are in the experimental forms pioneered by August Stramm and Herwarth Walden, about both his Catholic Faith and what he was witnessing as a soldier with the Imperial German Army in France. Four days before being mortally wounded by grenade fragments during the Battle of the Somme, Sorge wrote to his wife expressing a belief that what he called, &quot;the Anglo-French Offensive&quot; was going to succeed in overrunning German defenses. Sorge died in a field hospital at Ablaincourt on 20 July 1916. Susanne Sorge only learned of his death when a letter, in which she informed her husband that she had been pregnant with their second son since his most recent furlough, was returned to her as undeliverable.

In 1920, German poet Anton Schnack, whom Patrick Bridgwater has dubbed, &quot;one of the two unambiguously great,&quot; German poets of World War I and, &quot;the only German language poet whose work can be compared with that of Wilfred Owen,&quot; published the sonnet sequence, &quot;Tier rang gewaltig mit Tier&quot; (&quot;Beast Strove Mightily with Beast&quot;). The 60 sonnets that comprise &quot;Tier rang gewaltig mit Tier&quot;, &quot;are dominated by themes of night and death.&quot; Although his ABBACDDCEFGEFG rhyme scheme is typical of the sonnet form, Schnack also, &quot;writes in the long line in free rhythms developed in Germany by Ernst Stadler,&quot; whom in turn had been inspired by the experimental free verse which had been introduced into American poetry by Walt Whitman. Patrick Bridgwater, writing in 1985, called &quot;Tier rang gewaltig mit Tier&quot;, &quot;without question the best single collection produced by a German war poet in 1914–18.&quot; Bridgwater adds, however, that Anton Schnack, &quot;is to this day virtually unknown even in Germany.&quot;

===France===
Amongst French World War I poets are the following: Guillaume Apollinaire, Adrien Bertrand, Yvan Goll, and Charles Péguy.
Upon the outbreak of war in 1914, Blaise Cendrars, a Francophone Swiss poet of partially Scottish descent from La Chaux-de-Fonds, Canton of Neuchâtel, was living in Paris and playing a major role in modernist poetry. When it began, Cedrars and Italian writer Ricciotto Canudo appealed to other foreign artists, writers, and intellectuals to join the French Army. He joined the French Foreign Legion. He was sent to the front line in the Somme where from mid-December 1914 until February 1915, he was in the trenches at Frise (La Grenouillère and Bois de la Vache). During the Second Battle of Champagne in September 1915, Cendrars lost his right arm and was discharged from the French Army.

Jean de La Ville de Mirmont, a Huguenot poet from Bourdeaux, was overjoyed by the outbreak of the war. According to Ian Higgins, &quot;Although unfit for active service, Jean de La Ville de Mirmont volunteered immediately when the war broke out, but it was only after being repeatedly turned down that he finally managed to enlist.&quot; According to Ian Higgins, &quot;It has been suggested that here at last was the great adventure he had been longing for. Certainly, the prelude to the war &#x27;interested&#x27; him, and he was keen to witness and, if possible, take part in a war which was probably going to &#x27;set the whole of Europe on fire.&#x27; His &quot;Lettres de guerre&quot; develop movingly from initial enthusiasm for the defense of Civilization and a conviction that the enemy was the entire German people, through a growing irritation with chauvinistic brainwashing and the flagrancy of what would now be called the &#x27;disinformation&#x27; peddled through the French press (so much more heavily censored than the British, he said), to an eventual admiration, at the front, for the heroism and humanity often shown by the enemy.&quot;

The Breton poet and activist Yann-Ber Kalloc&#x27;h, a former Catholic seminarian from the island of Groix near Lorient, was best known by his Bardic name of &quot;Bleimor&quot;. According to Ian Higgins, &quot;When the war came, [Kalloc&#x27;h], like so many others, saw it as a defense of civilization and Christianity, and immediately volunteered for the front. &#x27;Only Ireland and Brittany&#x27;, he writes in one poem, &#x27;still help Christ carry the cross: in the fight to reinvigorate Christianity, the Celtic peoples are in the van&#x27;. In addition, now readily fighting for France, he saw the war as the great chance to affirm the national identity of Brittany and resurrect its language and culture.&quot; Kalloc&#x27;h&#x27;s last work was the poetry collection, &quot;Ar en Deulin&quot;, which was published posthumously. According to Jelle Krol, &quot;It is not merely a collection of poems by a major Breton poet: it is a symbol of homage to Yann-Ber Kalloc&#x27;h and all those Bretons whose creative powers were cut short by their untimely deaths. Breton literature from the trenches is very rare. Only Yann-Ber Kalloc&#x27;h&#x27;s poems, some war notes written by Auguste Bocher, the memoirs recounted by Ambroise Harel and Loeiz Herrieu&#x27;s letters addressed to his wife survived the war.&quot;

===Russia===

Russia also produced a number of significant war poets including Alexander Blok, Ilya Ehrenburg (who published war poems in his book &quot;On the Eve&quot;), and Nikolay Semenovich Tikhonov (who published the book &quot;Orda&quot; (The Horde) in 1922).

The Acmeist poet Nikolay Gumilyov served in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I. He saw combat in East Prussia, the Macedonian front, and with the Russian Expeditionary Force in France. He was also decorated twice with the Cross of St. George. Gumilyov&#x27;s war poems were assembled in the collection &quot;The Quiver&quot; (1916).

Gumilyov&#x27;s wife, the poet Anna Akhmatova, began writing poems during World War I that expressed the collective suffering of the Russian people as men were called up and the women in their lives bade them goodbye. For Akhmatova, writing such poems turned into her life&#x27;s work and she continued writing similar poems about the suffering of the Russian people during the Bolshevik Revolution, the Russian Civil War, the Red Terror, and Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge.

===Australia===
Leon Gellert, an Australian poet of Hungarian descent, enlisted in the First Australian Imperial Force&#x27;s 10th Battalion within weeks of the outbreak of war and sailed for Cairo on 22 October 1914. He landed at ANZAC Cove, during the Gallipoli Campaign on 25 April 1915, was wounded and repatriated as medically unfit in June 1916. He attempted to re-enlist but was soon found out. During periods of inactivity he had been indulging his appetite for writing poetry. &quot;Songs of a Campaign&quot; (1917) was his first published book of verse, and was favourably reviewed by &quot;The Bulletin&quot;. Angus &amp; Robertson soon published a new edition, illustrated by Norman Lindsay. His second, &quot;The Isle of San&quot; (1919), also illustrated by Lindsay, was not so well received.

John O&#x27;Donnell served in the Australian Imperial Force during World War I. He arrived at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 and later fought at the Battle of the Somme. In 1918 he was invalided back to Australia, during which time he wrote the last six poems of his only poetry collection, dealing with the war from the perspective of an Australian poet.

===Canada===
John McCrae, a Scottish-Canadian poet and surgeon from Guelph, Ontario, joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force and was appointed as medical officer and major of the 1st Brigade CFA (Canadian Field Artillery). He treated the wounded during the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915, from a hastily dug, bunker dug in the back of the dyke along the Yser Canal about 2 miles north of Ypres. McCrae&#x27;s friend and former militia pal, Lt. Alexis Helmer, was killed in the battle, and his burial inspired the poem, &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;, which was written on 3 May 1915, and first published in the magazine &quot;Punch&quot;. &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; appeared anonymously in &quot;Punch&quot; on 8 December 1915, but in the index, to that year McCrae was named as the author. The verses swiftly became one of the most popular poems of the war, used in countless fund-raising campaigns and frequently translated. &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; was also extensively printed in the United States, whose government was contemplating joining the war, alongside a &#x27;reply&#x27; by R. W. Lillard, (&quot;...Fear not that you have died for naught, / The torch ye threw to us we caught...&quot;).
Robert W. Service, an English-Canadian poet from Preston, Lancashire and who had already been dubbed, &quot;The Canadian Kipling&quot;, was living in Paris when World War I broke out. Service was a war correspondent for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, but &quot;was arrested and nearly executed in an outbreak of spy hysteria in Dunkirk.&quot; He then &quot;worked as a stretcher bearer and ambulance driver with the Ambulance Corps of the American Red Cross, until his health broke.&quot; While recuperating in Paris, Service wrote a volume of war poems, &quot;&quot;, which was published in Toronto in 1916. The book was dedicated to the memory of Service&#x27;s &quot;brother, Lieutenant Albert Service, Canadian Infantry, Killed in Action, France, August 1916.&quot; In 1926, Archibald MacMechan, professor of English at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, published &quot;Headwaters of Canadian Literature&quot;, in which he praised Service&#x27;s war poetry, writing, &quot;his &quot;Rhymes of a Red Cross Man&quot; are an advance on his previous volumes. He has come into touch with the grimmest of realities; and while his radical faults have not been cured, his rude lines drive home the truth that he has seen.&quot;

In 1924, a poetic tribute to the Canadian Corps soldiers of the 85th Battalion (Nova Scotia Highlanders) was composed in Canadian Gaelic by Alasdair MacÌosaig of St. Andrew&#x27;s Channel, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. The poem praised the courage of the Battalion&#x27;s fallen Canadian Gaels and told them that they had fought better against the Imperial German Army than the English did, while also lamenting the absence of fallen soldiers from their families and villages. The poem ended by denouncing the invasion of Belgium and vowing, even though Kaiser Wilhelm II had managed to evade prosecution by being granted political asylum in the neutral Netherlands, that he would one day be tried and hanged. The poem was first published in the Antigonish-based newspaper &quot;The Casket&quot; on 14 February 1924.

===England===
The major novelist and poet Thomas Hardy wrote a number of significant war poems that relate to the Napoleonic Wars, the Boer Wars and World War I, including &quot;Drummer Hodge&quot;, &quot;In Time of &#x27;The Breaking of Nations&quot;, &quot;The Man He Killed&quot; and ‘&quot;And there was a great calm&quot; (on the signing of the Armistice, Nov.11, 1918)’: his work had a profound influence on other war poets such as Rupert Brooke and Siegfried Sassoon. Hardy in these poems often used the viewpoint of ordinary soldiers and their colloquial speech. A theme in the &quot;Wessex Poems&quot; (1898) is the long shadow that the Napoleonic Wars cast over the 19th century, as seen, for example, in &quot;The Sergeant&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;Leipzig&quot;. The Napoleonic War is the subject of Hardy&#x27;s drama in verse &quot;The Dynasts&quot; (1904–08).

At the beginning of World War I, like many other writers, Kipling wrote pamphlets and poems which enthusiastically supported the British war aims of restoring Belgium after that kingdom had been occupied by Germany together with more generalised statements that Britain was standing up for the cause of good.
For the first time, a substantial number of important British poets were soldiers, writing about their experiences of war. A number of them died on the battlefield, most famously Edward Thomas, Isaac Rosenberg, Wilfred Owen, and Charles Sorley. Others including Robert Graves, Ivor Gurney and Siegfried Sassoon survived but were scarred by their experiences, and this was reflected in their poetry. Robert H. Ross describes the British &quot;war poets&quot; as Georgian poets. Many poems by British war poets were published in newspapers and then collected in anthologies. Several of these early anthologies were published during the war and were very popular, though the tone of the poetry changed as the war progressed. One of the wartime anthologies, &quot;The Muse in Arms&quot;, was published in 1917, and several were published in the years following the war.

David Jones&#x27; epic poem of World War I &quot;In Parenthesis&quot; was first published in England in 1937, and is based on Jones&#x27;s own experience as an infantryman in the War. &quot;In Parenthesis&quot; narrates the experiences of English Private John Ball in a mixed English-Welsh regiment starting with their leaving England and ending seven months later with the assault on Mametz Wood during the Battle of the Somme. The work employs a mixture of lyrical verse and prose, is highly allusive, and ranges in tone from formal to Cockney colloquial and military slang. The poem won the Hawthornden Prize and the admiration of writers such as W. B. Yeats and T. S. Eliot.

In November 1985, a slate memorial was unveiled in Poet&#x27;s Corner commemorating 16 poets of the Great War: Richard Aldington, Laurence Binyon, Edmund Blunden, Rupert Brooke, Wilfrid Gibson, Robert Graves, Julian Grenfell, Ivor Gurney, David Jones, Robert Nichols, Wilfred Owen, Herbert Read, Isaac Rosenberg, Siegfried Sassoon, Charles Sorley and Edward Thomas.

===Ireland===
The fact that 49,400 Irish soldiers in the British Army gave their lives fighting in the Great War remains controversial in Ireland. This is because the Easter Rising of 1916 took place during the war and the Irish War of Independence began only a few months after the 11 November Armistice. For this reason, Irish republicanism has traditionally viewed Irishmen who serve in the British military as traitors. This view became even more prevalent after 1949, when Ireland voted to become a Republic and to leave the Commonwealth. For this reason, Ireland&#x27;s war poets were long neglected.

One of them was Tom Kettle. Despite his outrage over the Rape of Belgium, Kettle was very critical of the war at first. Comparing the Anglo-Irish landlord class to the aristocratic big estate owners who similarly dominated the Kingdom of Prussia, Kettle wrote, &quot;England goes to fight for liberty in Europe and for Junkerdom in Ireland.&quot; G. K. Chesterton later wrote, &quot;Thomas Michael Kettle was perhaps the greatest example of that greatness of spirit which was so ill rewarded on both sides of the channel [...] He was a wit, a scholar, an orator, a man ambitious in all the arts of peace; and he fell fighting the barbarians because he was too good a European to use the barbarians against England, as England a hundred years before has used the barbarians against Ireland.&quot; Lieut. Kettle&#x27;s best-known poem is a sonnet, &quot;To My Daughter Betty, the Gift of God&quot;, which was written and mailed to his family just days before he was killed in action.

When Francis Ledwidge, who was a member of the Irish Volunteers in Slane, County Meath, learned of the outbreak of the war, he decided against enlisting in the British Army. In response, the Unionist National Volunteers subjected Ledwidge to a show trial, during which they accused him of cowardice and of being pro-German. Soon after, Ledwidge enlisted in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. Despite his twin beliefs in socialism and Irish republicanism, Ledwidge later wrote, &quot;I joined the British Army because she stood between Ireland and an enemy common to our civilisation and I would not have her say that she defended us while we did nothing at home but pass resolutions.&quot; Until his death at the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917, Ledwidge wrote the verses published in three volumes of poetry between 1916 and 1918, while he served at the Landing at Suvla Bay, on the Macedonian front and on the Western Front.

William Butler Yeats&#x27; first war poem was &quot;On being asked for a War Poem&quot; written on 6 February 1915, in response to a request from Henry James for a political poem about World War I. Yeats changed the poem&#x27;s title from &quot;To a friend who has asked me to sign his manifesto to the neutral nations&quot; to &quot;A Reason for Keeping Silent&quot; before sending it in a letter to James, which Yeats wrote at Coole Park on 20 August 1915. When it was later reprinted the title was changed to &quot;On being asked for a War Poem&quot;. Yeats&#x27; most famous war poem is &quot;An Irish Airman Foresees His Death&quot;, which is a soliloquy by Major Robert Gregory, an Irish nationalist flying ace who was also a friend of Yeats, and the son of Anglo-Irish landlord Sir William Henry Gregory and Yeats&#x27; patroness Lady Augusta Gregory. Wishing to show restraint from publishing a political poem during the height of the Great War, Yeats withheld publication of &quot;An Irish Airman Foresees His Death&quot; until after the 1918 Armistice.
&quot;The Second Coming&quot; is a poem written by Irish poet W. B. Yeats in 1919, in the aftermath of the First World War and at the beginning of the Irish War of Independence, which followed the Easter Rising of 1916, but before David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill sent the Black and Tans to Ireland. The poem uses Christian imagery regarding the Apocalypse, the Antichrist, and the Second Coming to allegorise the state of Europe during the Interwar Period.

===Scotland===

Even though its author died in 1905, Ronald Black has written that Fr. Allan MacDonald&#x27;s Aisling poem &quot;Ceum nam Mìltean&quot; (&quot;The March of Thousands&quot;), which describes a vision of legions of young men marching away to a conflict from whence they will not return, deserves to be, &quot;first in any anthology of the poetry of the First World War&quot;, and, &quot;would not have been in any way out of place, with regard to style or substance&quot;, in Sorley MacLean&#x27;s groundbreaking 1943 volume &quot;Dàin do Eimhir&quot;.
In 1914, Scottish poet Charles Sorley, a native of Aberdeen, was living in Imperial Germany. After being briefly interned as an enemy alien at Trier and ordered to leave the country, Sorley returned to Great Britain and enlisted in the Suffolk Regiment as a lieutenant. He was killed by a German sniper during the Battle of Loos in 1915 and his poems and letters were published posthumously. Robert Graves described Charles Sorley in &quot;Goodbye to All That&quot; as &quot;one of the three poets of importance killed during the war&quot;. (The other two being Isaac Rosenberg and Wilfred Owen.) Sorley believed that Germans and British were equally blind to each other&#x27;s humanity and his anti-war poetry stands in direct contrast to the romantic idealism about the war that appears in the poems of Rupert Brooke, Walter Flex, and Alan Seeger.

The Scottish Gaelic poet John Munro, a native of Swordale on the Isle of Lewis, won the Military Cross while serving as a 2nd Lieutenant with the Seaforth Highlanders and was ultimately killed in action during the 1918 Spring Offensive. Lt. Munro, writing under the pseudonym &quot;Iain Rothach&quot;, came to be ranked by critics alongside the major war poets. Tragically, only three of his poems are known to survive. They are &quot;Ar Tir&quot; (&quot;Our Land&quot;), &quot;Ar Gaisgich a Thuit sna Blàir&quot; (&quot;Our Heroes Who Fell in Battle&quot;), and &quot;Air sgàth nan sonn&quot; (&quot;For the Sake of the Warriors&quot;). Derick Thomson – the venerable poet and Professor of Celtic Studies at Glasgow – hailed Munro as, &quot;the first strong voice of the new Gaelic verse of the 20th century&quot;. Ronald Black has written that Munro&#x27;s three poems leave behind, &quot;his thoughts on his fallen comrades in tortured free verse full of reminiscence-of-rhyme; forty more years were to pass before free verse became widespread in Gaelic.&quot;

Pàdraig Moireasdan, a Scottish Gaelic bard and &quot;seanchaidh&quot; from Grimsay, North Uist, served in the Lovat Scouts during World War I. He served in the Gallipoli Campaign, in the Macedonian front, and on the Western Front. In later years, Moireasdan, who ultimately reached the rank of corporal, loved to tell how he fed countless starving Allied soldiers in Thessalonica by making a Quern-stone. Corporal Moireasdan composed many poems and songs during the war, including &quot;Òran don Chogadh&quot; (A Song to the War&quot;), which he composed while serving at Gallipoli.

In 1969, Gairm, a publishing house based in Glasgow and specializing in Scottish Gaelic literature, posthumously published the first book of collected poems by Dòmhnall Ruadh Chorùna. The poet, who had died two years previously in the hospital at Lochmaddy on the island of North Uist, was a combat veteran of the King&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders during World War I and highly talented poet in Gaelic. According to Ronald Black, &quot;Dòmhnall Ruadh Chorùna is the outstanding Gaelic poet of the trenches. His best-known song &quot;An Eala Bhàn&quot; (&quot;The White Swan&quot;) was produced there for home consumption, but in a remarkable series of ten other compositions he describes what it looked, felt, sounded and even smelt like to march up to the front, to lie awake on the eve of battle, to go over the top, to be gassed, to wear a mask, to be surrounded by the dead and dying remains of Gaelic-speaking comrades, and so on. Others of his compositions contain scenes of deer hunting, a symbolically traditional pursuit of which he happened to be passionately fond, and which he continued to practice all his life.&quot;

===Wales===
At the outbreak of World War I, the vast majority of the Welsh populace were against being involved in the war. Throughout World War I, voluntary enlistment by Welshmen remained low and conscription was ultimately enacted in Wales to ensure a steady supply of new recruits into the armed forces. The war particularly left Welsh non-conformist chapels deeply divided. Traditionally, the Nonconformists had not been comfortable at all with the idea of warfare. The war saw a major clash within Welsh Nonconformism between those who backed military service and those who adopted Christian pacifism.
The most famous Welsh-language war poet remains Private Ellis Humphrey Evans of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, who is best known under his bardic name of Hedd Wyn. Evans wrote much of his poetry while working as a shepherd on his family&#x27;s hill farm. His style, which was influenced by romantic poetry, was dominated by themes of nature and religion. He also wrote several war poems following the outbreak of war on the Western Front in 1914. Like many other Welsh nonconformists, Hedd Wyn was a Christian pacifist and refused to enlist in the armed forces, feeling that he could never kill anyone. The war, however, inspired some of Hedd Wyn&#x27;s most noted poems, including &quot;Plant Trawsfynydd&quot; (&quot;Children of Trawsfynydd&quot;), &quot;Y Blotyn Du&quot; (&quot;The Black Dot&quot;), and &quot;Nid â’n Ango&quot; (&quot;[It] Will Not Be Forgotten&quot;). His poem, &quot;Rhyfel&quot; (&quot;War&quot;), remains one of his most frequently quoted works.

Albert Evans-Jones, a Welsh poet, served on the Salonica front and on the Western Front as a RAMC ambulance man and later as a military chaplain. After the war, he became a minister for the Presbyterian Church of Wales and wrote many poems that shocked the Welsh population with their graphic descriptions of the horrors of the trenches and their savage attacks on wartime ultra-nationalism. Also, in his work as Archdruid of the National Eisteddfod, Rev. Evans-Jones altered the traditional rituals, which were based in 18th century Celtic neopaganism, to better reflect the Christian beliefs of the Welsh people. Rev. Evans-Jones, whom Alan Llwyd considers the greatest Welsh poet of the Great War, is best known under the bardic name of Cynan. Welsh poet Alan Llwyd&#x27;s English translations of many poems by both poets appear in the volume &quot;Out of the Fire of Hell; Welsh Experience of the Great War 1914–1918 in Prose and Verse&quot;.

===United States===

Although World War I in American literature is widely believed to begin and end with Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s war novel &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;, there were also American war poets.

Alan Seeger enlisted in the French Foreign Legion while America was still neutral and became the first great American poet of the First World War. Seeger&#x27;s poems, which passionately urged the American people to join the Allied cause, were widely publicized and remained popular. According to former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, decades after Alan Seeger&#x27;s death, his poem &quot;,&quot; was a great favorite of her husband, U.S. President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who often asked her to read it aloud to him.
Joyce Kilmer, who was widely considered America&#x27;s leading Roman Catholic poet and apologist and who was often compared to G.K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc, enlisted mere days after the United States entered World War I. Before his departure, Kilmer had contracted with publishers to write a book about the war, deciding upon the title &quot;Here and There with the Fighting Sixty-Ninth&quot;. Kilmer never completed the book; however, toward the end of the year, he did find time to write prose sketches and war poetry. The most famous of Kilmer&#x27;s war poems is &quot;Rouge Bouquet&quot; (1918) which commemorates the victims of a German artillery barrage against American trenches in the Rouge Bouquet forest, near Baccarat, on the afternoon of 7 March 1918. According to Dana Gioia, however, &quot;None of Kilmer&#x27;s wartime verses are read today; his reputation survives on poems written before he enlisted.&quot;
In 1928, American poet and World War I veteran of the A.E.F. John Allan Wyeth published &quot;This Man&#x27;s Army: A War in Fifty-Odd Sonnets&quot;. B.J. Omanson recalls his first encounter with the collection, &quot;Wyeth&#x27;s sequence... was over fifty sonnets long and, reading through just a few of them at random, indicated that not only were they highly skilled, but unusually innovative as well. What was most exciting was that they were written, not in an elevated, formal tone, but in a cool, concise, dispassionate voice, spiced with slangy soldiers&#x27; dialogue, French villagers&#x27; &quot;patois&quot;, and filled with as many small particulars of life as any of the finest soldier-diaries I had read.&quot; The collection, which is written in an experimental form truly unique in the 800-year history of the sonnet, traces Wyeth&#x27;s service as a 2nd Lieutenant and military intelligence officer. 

Although &quot;This Man&#x27;s Army&quot; was highly praised by American literary critics, with the onset of the Great Depression, Wyeth&#x27;s poetry was forgotten. According to B.J. Omanson and Dana Gioia, who rescued Wyeth&#x27;s poetry from oblivion during the early 21st century, Wyeth is the only American poet of the First World War who can withstand comparison with English war poets Siegfried Sassoon, Isaac Rosenberg, and Wilfred Owen. B.J. Omanson has also found that every event that Wyeth relates in his sonnets, down to the way he describes the weather, can be verified by other eyewitness accounts as completely accurate. In response to the 2008 re-publication of &quot;The Man&#x27;s Army&quot;, British literary critic Jon Stallworthy, the editor of &quot;The Oxford Book of War Poetry&quot; and the biographer of Wilfred Owen, wrote, &quot;At long last, marking the ninetieth anniversary of the Armistice, an American poet takes his place in the front rank of the War Poet&#x27;s parade.&quot;
Inspired by Canadian poet John McCrae&#x27;s famous poem &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;, American poet Moina Michael resolved at the war&#x27;s conclusion in 1918 to wear a red poppy year-round to honour the millions of soldiers who had died in the Great War. She also wrote a poem in response called &quot;We Shall Keep the Faith&quot;.
==Russian Civil War==
During the Russian Civil War, the Russian Symbolist poet Vyacheslav Ivanov wrote the sonnet sequence &quot;Poems for a Time of Troubles.&quot;

Between 1917 and 1922, Russian poet Marina Tsvetaeva, whose husband Sergei Efron was serving as an officer in the anti-communist Volunteer Army, wrote the epic verse cycle &quot;Lebedinyi stan&quot; (&quot;The Encampment of the Swans&quot;) about the civil war, glorifying the anti-communist soldiers of the White Movement. The cycle of poems is in the style of a diary or journal and begins on the day of Tsar Nicholas II&#x27;s abdication in March 1917, and ends late in 1920, when the Whites had been completely defeated. The &#x27;swans&#x27; of the title refers to the volunteer soldiers of the White Army. In 1922, Tsvetaeva also published a lengthy monarchist fairy tale in verse, &quot;Tsar-devitsa&quot; (&quot;Tsar-Maiden&quot;).

On the other side, Osip Mandelstam wrote many poems praising the Red Army and rebuking the Whites, whom he referred to in one poem as, &quot;October&#x27;s withered leaves.&quot; However, Mandelstam, who believed deeply in the tradition that poets are the conscience of the Russian people, died in the Gulag in 1938, after being arrested for composing an epigram that both attacked and mocked Stalin.

==Spanish Civil War==

The Spanish Civil War produced a substantial volume of poetry in English (as well as in Spanish). There were English-speaking poets serving in the Spanish Civil War on both sides. Among those fighting with the Republicans as volunteers in the International Brigades were Clive Branson, John Cornford, Charles Donnelly, Alex McDade and Tom Wintringham.

On the Nationalist side, the most famous English-language poet of the Spanish Civil War remains South African poet Roy Campbell. As a recent convert to the Roman Catholic Church, Campbell was horrified to witness the violent religious persecution of Catholics as part of the wider Red Terror ordered by the Pro-Soviet leadership of Republican forces. A particularly chilling moment for Campbell was when he came across the bodies of Toledo&#x27;s Carmelite monks, whom he had befriended, after Republican forces had subjected them to execution without trial. The monks&#x27; executioners had then written in blood above their bodies, &quot;Thus strikes the CHEKA.&quot; Campbell later retold the execution in his poem &quot;The Carmelites of Toledo&quot; and finished the same poem by pointing out the role that local massacres of Roman Catholic priests, laity, and religious orders played in causing the city&#x27;s Spanish Army garrison to join Francisco Franco&#x27;s mutiny against the Second Spanish Republic and to repeatedly refuse to surrender during the Siege of the Alcázar. Of Campbell&#x27;s other poems about the War, the best are the sonnets &quot;Hot Rifles&quot;, &quot;Christ in Uniform&quot;, &quot;The Alcazar Mined&quot;, and &quot;Toledo 1936&quot;. According to Campbell&#x27;s biographer, Joseph Pearce, and his daughters Anna and Tess, Campbell&#x27;s pro-Nationalist stance has caused him, in an early version of cancel culture, to be inaccurately labeled as a Fascist and left out of poetry anthologies and college courses.

In Afrikaans literature, the best poet of the Spanish Civil War is Campbell&#x27;s close friend Uys Krige, who campaigned just as passionately for the Republican faction. In Roy Campbell&#x27;s 1952 memoir, &quot;Light on a Dark Horse&quot;, he explains Uys Krige&#x27;s Republican sympathies by the latter being, &quot;an incurable Calvinist.&quot; In 1937, Krige wrote the Afrikaans poem, &quot;Lied van die fascistiese bomwerpers&quot; (&quot;Hymn of the Fascist Bombers&quot;). Krige later recalled, &quot;I needed only a line or two, then the poem wrote itself. My hand could hardly keep pace. I did not have to correct anything. Well... that seldom happens to you.&quot; The poem condemned the bombing raids by pro-Nationalist Luftwaffe pilots of the Condor Legion. Inspired, according to Jack Cope, by Krige&#x27;s upbringing within Afrikaner Calvinism and its traditional hostility to an allegedly corrupt Pre-Reformation Church, &quot;Lied van die fascistiese bomwerpers&quot; also leveled savage attacks against Roman Catholicism.

According to Jack Cope, &quot;The poem starts on a note of military pride - the eyes of the Fascist pilots fixed on themselves in their joyful and triumphant, their holy task. The tone of bitter irony rises as the pace becomes faster, climbing to height after height of savagery and contempt. The lines of the Latin liturgy become mixed with the brutal exultation of the mercenaries raining down death from their safe altitude. The Bible itself is rolled in the blood. The lovely place-names of Spain rise in gleams above the dust and smoke. In the end the hymn becomes an insane scream of violence and bloody destruction mocking even the Crucifixion.&quot; As no Afrikaans journal dared to publish it, Uys Krige&#x27;s &quot;Lied van die fascistiese bomwerpers&quot; appeared in the &quot;Forum&quot;, a Left-leaning literary journal published in English. Krige&#x27;s poem elicited vehement condemnations from both extreme Afrikaner nationalists and from the Catholic Church in South Africa, which &quot;protested vehemently&quot; called Krige&#x27;s poem sacrilegious.

The best Spanish-language poets of the Civil War are Republican poet Federico García Lorca, Carlist poet José María Hinojosa Lasarte, and the Machado brothers. Antonio Machado wrote a poem to honor the Communist General Enrique Líster, and died a refugee in France after the defeat of the Republic. Meanwhile, his brother, Manuel Machado, dedicated a poem to the saber of the Nationalist Generalissimo Francisco Franco.

==World War II==
===Poland===
Poland&#x27;s war, both in conventional and guerrilla warfare, continued to inspire poetry long after all fighting had ceased. Czesław Miłosz has since written, &quot;Before World War II, Polish poets did not differ much in their interests and problems from their colleagues in France and Holland. The specific features of Polish literature notwithstanding, Poland belonged to the same cultural circuit as other European countries. Thus one can say that what occurred in Poland was the encounter of a European poet with the hell of the twentieth century, not hell&#x27;s first circle, but a much deeper one. This situation is something of a laboratory, in other words: it allows us to examine what happens to modern poetry in certain historical conditions.&quot;

After SS General Jürgen Stroop suppressed the Warsaw Ghetto uprising in 1943, anti-Nazi Polish poet Czesław Miłosz wrote the poem &quot;Campo dei Fiore&quot;. In the poem, Miłosz compared the burning of the Ghetto and its 60,0000 inhabitants to the burning at the stake of Giordano Bruno by the Roman Inquisition in 1600. Miłosz criticized the Polish people for just going on with their daily routines while the Ghetto was burning. He ended by urging his listeners and readers to feel outraged over the Holocaust in Poland and to join the Polish Resistance in their fight against the Nazi Occupiers.

Also in response to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, poet Hirsh Glick, who was imprisoned in the Vilna Ghetto, wrote the Yiddish poem &quot;Zog Nit Keynmol&quot;, in which he urged his fellow Jews to take up arms against Nazi Germany. Despite Glick&#x27;s own murder by the SS in 1944, &quot;Zog Nit Keynmol&quot; was set to music and widely adopted by Jewish partisans as an anthem of resistance against the Holocaust.

In 1974, Anna Świrszczyńska published the poetry collection &quot;Budowałam barykadę&quot; (&quot;Building the Barricade&quot;), about her experiences as both a combatant and battlefield nurse during the 1944 Warsaw uprising. Czesław Miłosz later wrote about Świrszczyńska, &quot;In August and September of 1944, she took part in the Warsaw Uprising. For sixty-three days she witnessed and participated in a battle waged by a city of one million people against tanks, planes, and heavy artillery... Many years later, Świrszczyńska tried to reconstruct that tragedy in her poems: the building of barricades, the basement hospitals, the bombed houses caving in burying the people in shelters, the lack of ammunition, food, and bandages, and her own adventures as a military nurse. Yet these attempts of hers did not succeed: they were too wordy, too pathetic, and she destroyed her manuscripts. (Also, for a long time the Uprising was a forbidden topic, in view of Russia&#x27;s role in crushing it). No less than thirty years after the event did she hit upon a style that satisfied her. Curiously enough, that was the style of miniature, which she had discovered in her youth, but this time not applied to paintings. Her book &quot;Building the Barricades&quot; consists of very short poems, without meter or rhyme, each one a microreport on a single incident or situation.&quot;
===Hungary===

Hungarian Jewish poet and Roman Catholic convert Miklós Radnóti was a vocal critic of the Pro-German Governments of Admiral Miklós Horthy and of the Arrow Cross Party. According to Radnóti&#x27;s English translator Frederick Turner, &quot;One day, one of Radnóti&#x27;s friends saw him on the streets of Budapest, and the poet was mumbling something like, &#x27;Du-duh-du-duh-du-duh,&#x27; and his friend said, &#x27;Don&#x27;t you understand?! Hitler is invading Poland!&#x27; And Radnóti supposedly answered, &#x27;Yes, but this is the only thing I have to fight with.&#x27; As his poetry makes clear, Radnóti believed that Fascism was the destruction of order. It both destroyed and vulgarized civil society. It was as if you wanted to create an ideal cat, so you took your cat, killed it, removed its flesh, put it into some kind of mold, and then pressed it into the shape of a cat. That&#x27;s what Fascism does, and that&#x27;s what Communism does. They both destroy an intricate social order to set up a criminally simple-minded order.&quot;

===Soviet Union===
During World War II, Anna Akhmatova witnessed the 900-day Siege of Leningrad and read her poems over the radio to encourage the city&#x27;s defenders. In 1940, Akhmatova started her &quot;Poem without a Hero&quot;, finishing a first draft in Tashkent, but working on &quot;The Poem&quot; for twenty years and considering it to be the major work of her life, dedicating it to &quot;the memory of its first audience – my friends and fellow citizens who perished in Leningrad during the siege&quot;.

In the 1974 poem &quot;Prussian Nights&quot;, Soviet dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn, a former captain in the Red Army during World War II, graphically describes Soviet war crimes in East Prussia. The narrator, a Red Army officer, approves of his troops&#x27; looting and rapes against German civilians as revenge for German war crimes in the Soviet Union and he hopes to take part in the atrocities himself. The poem describes the gang-rape of a Polish woman whom the Red Army soldiers had mistaken for a German. According to a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Solzhenitsyn wrote the poem in trochaic tetrameter, &quot;in imitation of, and argument with the most famous Russian war poem, Aleksandr Tvardovsky&#x27;s &quot;Vasili Tyorkin&quot;.&quot;

===Serbia===
Amongst Serbian poets during World War II, the most notable is Desanka Maksimović. She is well known for &quot;Krvava bajka&quot; or &quot;A Bloody Fairy Tale&quot;. The poem is about a group of schoolchildren in Occupied Yugoslavia who fall victim to the 1941 Wehrmacht war crime known as the Kragujevac massacre.

===Finland===
Yrjö Jylhä published a poetry collection in 1951 about the Winter War, in which Finland fought against Joseph Stalin and the invading Red Army. The name of the collection was &quot;Kiirastuli&quot; (Purgatory).

===Canada===

One of the most famous World War II poets in both Canadian and American poetry is John Gillespie Magee Jr., an American fighter pilot who had volunteered to fly for the Royal Canadian Air Force before America entered the Second World War. Gillespie wrote the iconic and oft-quoted sonnet &quot;High Flight&quot;, a few months before his death in an accidental collision over Ruskington, Lincolnshire, on 11 December 1941. Originally published in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, &quot;High Flight&quot; was widely distributed after Pilot Officer Magee became one of the first post-Pearl Harbor American citizens to die in the Second World War. Since 1941, Pilot Officer Maher&#x27;s sonnet has been featured prominently in aviation memorials across the world, including that for the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.

===England===
By World War II the role of &quot;war poet&quot; was so well-established in the public mind, and it was anticipated that the outbreak of war in 1939 would produce a literary response equal to that of the First World War. The Times Literary Supplement went so far as to pose the question in 1940: &quot;Where are the war-poets?&quot; Alun Lewis and Keith Douglas are the standard critical choices amongst British war poets of this time. In 1942, Henry Reed published a collection of three poems about British infantry training entitled &quot;Lessons of the War&quot;; three more were added after the war. Sidney Keyes was another important and prolific Second World War poet.

===Ireland===
Despite Ireland&#x27;s neutrality, the events and atrocities of that war did inspire Irish poetry as well.

In his 1964 poetry collection &quot;Lux aeterna&quot;, Eoghan Ó Tuairisc, an Irish-language poet from Ballinasloe, County Galway, included a long poem inspired by the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, entitled &quot;Aifreann na marbh&quot; (&quot;Mass for the Dead&quot;). The poem is an imitation of the Roman Catholic Requiem Mass, &quot;with the significant omission of &#x27;Credo&#x27; and &#x27;Gloria.&#x27;&quot; According to Louis De Paor, &quot;In the course of the poem, the glories of Irish and European civilisation, of art, literature, science, commerce, philosophy, language, and religion are interrogated and found incapable of providing a meaningful response to the apparently unlimited human capacity for destruction. In the month of &quot;Lúnasa&quot;, the Pagan Celtic God of light, on the Christian feast day of the Transfiguration, &quot;Dé Luain&quot; (Monday) becomes &quot;Lá an Luain&quot; (Doomsday), as the destructive light of atomic annihilation replaces the natural light of the sun. The poem also draws on early Irish literature to articulate Ó Tuairisc&#x27;s idea that the poet has a responsibility to intercede in the eternal struggle between love and violence through the unifying, healing, power of creative imagination. While everyone is culpable in the annihilation of Hiroshima, the poet, the word-priest, bears a particular burden of responsibility.&quot;

===New Zealand===
New Zealand&#x27;s war poets include H. W. Gretton, whose poem &quot;Koru and Acanthus&quot; is a notable work in the genre. His war diary, made whilst serving with the 2NZEF in Italy, is also an important social-historical document.

===Scotland===
Hamish Henderson a Scottish poet from Blairgowrie, Perthshire, served as an officer in the British Army Intelligence Corps during the North African Campaign. During his service, Henderson collected the lyrics to &quot;D-Day Dodgers,&quot; a satirical song to the tune of &quot;Lili Marlene&quot;, attributed to Lance-Sergeant Harry Pynn, who had served in Italy. Henderson also wrote the lyrics to &quot;The 51st (Highland) Division&#x27;s Farewell to Sicily&quot;, set to a pipe tune called &quot;Farewell to the Creeks&quot;. The book in which these were collected, &quot;Ballads of World War II&quot;, was published &quot;privately&quot; to evade censorship, but still earned Henderson a ten-year ban from BBC radio. Henderson&#x27;s 1948 poetry book about his experiences in the war, &quot;Elegies for the Dead in Cyrenaica&quot;, received the Somerset Maugham Award.

Scottish Gaelic poet Duncan Livingstone, a native of the Isle of Mull who had lived in Pretoria, South Africa, since 1903, published several poems in Gaelic about the war. They included an account of the Battle of the River Plate and also an imitation of Sìleas na Ceapaich&#x27;s early 18th-century lament, &quot;Alasdair a Gleanna Garadh&quot;, in honor of Livingstone&#x27;s nephew, Pilot Officer Alasdair Ferguson Bruce of the Royal Air Force, who was shot down and killed during a mission over Nazi Germany in 1941.

Scottish Gaelic poet Sorley MacLean was also a soldier poet who wrote about his combat experiences with the Royal Corps of Signals during the Western Desert campaign. MacLean&#x27;s most famous Gaelic war poem is &quot;Glac a&#x27; Bhàis&quot; (&quot;The Valley of Death&quot;), which relates his thoughts on seeing a dead German soldier in North Africa. In the poem, MacLean ponders what role the dead man may have played in Nazi atrocities against both German Jews and members of the Communist Party of Germany. MacLean concludes, however, by saying that whatever the German soldier may or may not have done, he showed no pleasure in his death upon Ruweisat Ridge.

Upon the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, North Uist war poet Dòmhnall Ruadh Chorùna composed the poem &quot;Òran dhan Dara Chogaidh&quot; (&quot;A Song for World War II&quot;). In the poem, Dòmhnall urged the young Scottish Gaels who were going off to fight to not be afraid and that victory over Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany would come by October 1939. On 16 November 1939, the British merchant ship &quot;S.S. Arlington Court&quot; was torpedoed and sunk in the Atlantic Ocean by the German submarine &quot;U-43&quot;. In his poem &quot;Calum Moireasdan an Arlington Court&quot; (&quot;Calum Morrison of the &quot;Arlington Court&quot;&quot;), Dòmhnall paid tribute to the courage shown by one of the survivors, a seventeen-year-old Gaelic-speaking merchant seaman from Calbost on the Isle of Lewis. Morrison had been the only survivor in his lifeboat who had known how to sail and had managed to pilot their lifeboat eastwards for five days, until he and his fellow survivors were rescued at the mouth of the English Channel. Also during the Second World War, Dòmhnall served in the Home Guard, about which he composed the song &quot;Òran a&#x27; Home Guard&quot; (&quot;The Song of the Home Guard&quot;), which pokes fun at an exercise in which a platoon from North Uist was ordered to simulate taking the airfield at Benbecula from the invading Wehrmacht. At the same time, Dòmhnall&#x27;s son Calum MacDonald served in the Merchant navy, and regularly sailed within sight of North Uist on his travels between the port of Glasgow and the United States. With this in mind, the Bard composed the poem &quot;Am Fianais Uibhist&quot; (&quot;In Sight of Uist&quot;).

Aonghas Caimbeul, a Scottish Gaelic poet, served with the Seaforth Highlanders. In his award-winning memoir &quot;Suathadh ri Iomadh Rubha&quot;, Caimbeul recalled the origins of his poem, &quot;Deargadan Phòland&quot; (&quot;The Fleas of Poland&quot;), &quot;We called them the &quot;Freiceadan Dubh&quot; (&#x27;Black Watch&#x27;), and any man they didn&#x27;t reduce to cursing and swearing deserved a place in the courts of the saints. I made a satirical poem about them at the time, but that didn&#x27;t take the strength out of their frames or the sharpness out of their sting.&quot; Caimbeul composed other poems during his captivity, including &quot;Smuaintean am Braighdeanas am Pòland, 1944&quot; (&quot;Thoughts on Bondage in Poland, 1944&quot;).

Calum MacNeacail, a Scottish Gaelic poet, served in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. In his 1946 poem &quot;Cùmhnantan Sìthe Pharis&quot; (&quot;The Paris Peace Treaties&quot;), MacNeacail praised the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and threatened the same fate against Joseph Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov if the continued refusing to cooperate with the Western Allies.

===South Africa===
In South African poetry in English, Roy Campbell wrote several poems in favor of the Allied cause during the Second World War. In one of them, Campbell expressed his elation and pride at seeing the Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal being towed into Gibraltar for repairs following combat.

In Afrikaans literature, the main war poet of the Second World War is, like in the Spanish Civil War, Uys Krige. Uys Krige served as a war correspondent with the South African Army during the Abyssinian Campaign and the North African Campaign. Krige&#x27;s collection &quot;Oorlogsgedigte&quot; (&quot;War Poems&quot;), was published in 1942.

===Wales===
Anglo-Welsh poet Alun Lewis remains one of the most well-known English-language poets of the Second World War. His first published book was the collection of poetry &quot;Raider&#x27;s Dawn and other poems&quot; (1942). Lewis&#x27; poems about his war experiences have been described as showing &quot;his brooding over his army experiences and trying to catch and hold some vision that would illuminate its desolation with meaning&quot; (see Ian Hamilton &quot;Alun Lewis Selected Poetry and Prose)

Anglo-Welsh poet Dylan Thomas also wrote about the victims of Luftwaffe bombs during the Battle of Britain and about The Holocaust in his poem &quot;A Refusal to Mourn the Death, by Fire, of a Child in London&quot;.

===United States===
Although the Second World War is not usually thought of as a poet&#x27;s war, there were American war poets.

In an interview for the documentary &quot;The Muse of Fire&quot;, U.S. Poet Laureate Richard Wilbur commented that there was a great difference between the war poets of World War I and those, like himself, who wrote and served during World War II. Wilbur explained that, unlike Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, American World War II poets believed themselves to be fighting a just war and that Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan were terrible enemies which needed to be confronted and destroyed. He did add that many World War II poets, including himself, felt sympathy for the plight of conscientious objectors.

After being thrown out of signals training and busted back to the ranks for expressing sympathy for the Communist Party of the United States of America, Richard Wilbur was shipped overseas as an enlisted man and served in the European theatre. During his war service with the 36th U.S. Division and over the decades that followed, Richard Wilbur wrote many war poems. One of Wilbur&#x27;s best-known war poems is &quot;Tywater&quot;, about the combat death in Italy of Corporal Lloyd Tywater. Another famous war poem by Richard Wilbur is &quot;First Snow in Alsace&quot;, which lyrically describes the horrors of a recent battlefield in Occupied France being covered up by the beautiful sight of new-fallen snow.

Anthony Hecht, an American poet of German Jewish ancestry, served in the European Theater as a G.I. with the 97th U.S. Infantry Division. Decades later, Hecht sought treatment for PTSD and used his war experiences as the subject of many of his poems.

American poet Dunstan Thompson, a native of New London, Connecticut, began publishing his poems while serving as a soldier in the European Theater during World War II. Thompson&#x27;s poems depict military service through the eyes of a homosexual, who is engaged in casual encounters with soldiers and sailors in Blitzed London.

Karl Shapiro, a stylish writer with a commendable regard for his craft, wrote poetry in the Pacific Theater while he served there during World War II. His collection &quot;V-Letter and Other Poems&quot; was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1945, while Shapiro was still in the military. Shapiro was American Poet Laureate in 1946 and 1947. (At the time this title was consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress, which was changed by Congress in 1985 to Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress.).

Also, while serving in the U.S. Army, the American poet Randall Jarrell published his second book of poems, &quot;Little Friend, Little Friend&quot; (1945) based on his wartime experiences. The book includes one of Jarrell&#x27;s best-known war poems, &quot;The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner.&quot; In his follow-up book, &quot;Losses&quot; (1948), he also focused on the war. The poet Robert Lowell stated publicly that he thought Jarrell had written &quot;the best poetry in English about the Second World War.&quot;

===Romania===
The Romanian-born poet Paul Celan wrote war poetry including &quot;Todesfuge&quot; (translated into English as &quot;Death Fugue&quot;, and &quot;Fugue of Death&quot;,) a German poem written by probably around 1945 and first published in 1948. It is &quot;among Celan&#x27;s most well-known and often-anthologized poems&quot;. The is regarded as a &quot;masterful description of horror and death in a concentration camp&quot;. Celan was born to a Jewish family in Cernauti, Romania; his parents were murdered during the Holocaust, and Celan himself was a prisoner for a time in a concentration camp.

===Japan===

Ryuichi Tamura who served in the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II is a major Japanese war poet. Following the war, he &quot;helped begin a poetry magazine, &quot;The Waste Land&quot;&quot; and those poets who contributed to it were &quot;the Waste Land Poets.&quot; The work of these writers was especially influenced by T. S. Eliot, Stephen Spender, C. Day-Lewis and W. H. Auden. Tamura&#x27;s first book of poems, &quot;Four Thousand Days and Nights&quot; was published in 1956.

Sadako Kurihara was living in Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, and it was then &quot;that her life was transformed from being a shopkeeper to becoming one of Japan&#x27;s most controversial poets. Her first major collection of poems, &quot;Black Eggs&quot;, published in 1946&quot;, but it was heavily censored by the American Occupation Forces Censor, because of how she dealt with the horrors following the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan. Kurihara has also &quot;taken a stand on&quot; the many Japanese war crimes that were committed during the occupation of China, &quot;the mistreatment of Koreans in Japan, and the need for a world-wide ban on nuclear weapons&quot;.
General Tadamichi Kuribayashi was the overall commander of the Japanese forces during the Battle of Iwo Jima. On 17 March 1945, the General sent his farewell message to Imperial Headquarters accompanied by three traditional death poems in &quot;waka&quot; form. Both were, according to historian Kumiko Kakehashi, &quot;a subtle protest against the military command that so casually sent men out to die.&quot; The poems and the message were heavily rewritten by Japanese military censors before being published and all anti-war sentiments were removed. Instead of describing the General and his soldiers as feeling &quot;sad&quot; to fall in battle, Japanese censors rewrote the poem to say that they died in Banzai charges. The uncensored text of both the message and the poems were only published after the Surrender of Japan.

==Later wars==

===Korean War===
The Korean War inspired the war poetry of Rolando Hinojosa, a Mexican-American poet from Mercedes, Texas, and of William Wantling.

On 28 March 1956, when BBC Scotland played a recording of a Scottish Gaelic language ceilidh by the soldiers of the King&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders during the Korean War, Dòmhnall Ruadh Chorùna, who had served in the same regiment during World War I, was listening. He later composed the poem &quot;Gillean Chorea&quot; (&quot;The Lads in Korea&quot;), in which he declared that the recording had brought back his youth. In his poem &quot;Òran an H-Bomb&quot; (&quot;The Song of the H-Bomb&quot;), he commented on the hydrogen bomb.

===Vietnam War===
The Vietnam War also produced war poets, including Armenian-American poet Michael Casey whose début collection, &quot;Obscenities&quot;, drew on his service with the Military Police Corps in the Quảng Ngãi Province of South Vietnam. The book won the 1972 Yale Younger Poets Award.

W. D. Ehrhart, a United States Marine Corps Sergeant who won the Purple Heart in the Battle of Huế during the Tet Offensive, has since been dubbed &quot;the Dean of Vietnam War poetry.&quot;

At the height of the Vietnam War in 1967, American poet Richard Wilbur composed &quot;A Miltonic Sonnet for Mr. Johnson on His Refusal of Peter Hurd&#x27;s Official Portrait&quot;.

Rob Jacques, a Vietnam-Era United States Navy veteran, has explored the tension between love and violence in war from the perspective of homosexual servicemen in his collection, &quot;War Poet&quot;, published by Sibling Rivalry Press.

Yusef Komunyakaa (formerly James Willie Brown, Jr.) served in the United States Army during the Vietnam War as an editor for the military newspaper &quot;Southern Cross&quot;. He has since used his war experiences as the source of his poetry collections &quot;Toys in a Field&quot; (1986) and &quot;Dien Cau Dau&quot; (1988).

Another poet of the Vietnam War is Bruce Weigl.

===War on Terror===

The Iraq War has produced war poets including Brian Turner whose début collection, &quot;Here, Bullet&quot;, is based on his experience as an infantry team leader with the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team. The book won numerous awards including the 2005 Beatrice Hawley Award, the 2006 Maine Literary Award in Poetry, and the 2006 Northern California Book Award in Poetry. In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Dana Goodyear wrote that, &quot;As a war poet, [Brian Turner] sidesteps the classic distinction between romance and irony, opting instead for the surreal.&quot;

Erika Renee Land is an American 21st-century war poet, 2021MacDowell Fellow and author, that served in Mosul, Iraq from 2005 to 2006. She has published two poetry collections that chronicle her experiences.

<text>Thai eggplant (, &quot;&quot;) is the name for several varieties of eggplant used in Southeast Asian cuisines, most often of the eggplant species &quot;Solanum melongena&quot;. They are also cultivated in India and Sri Lanka and feature in Sri Lankan cuisine. These golf ball-sized eggplants are commonly used in Thai cuisine, Indonesian cuisine, and in Cambodian cuisine. Some cultivars in Thailand include Thai Purple, Thai Green, Thai Yellow, and Thai White.

== Uses ==
=== Culinary ===
The green-white varieties of Thai eggplants are essential ingredients in Thai curry dishes such as in &quot;kaeng tai pla&quot;, green and red curry. They are often halved or quartered, but can also be used whole, and cooked in the curry sauce where they become softer and absorb the flavor of the sauce. They are also eaten raw in Thai salads or with Thai chili pastes (&quot;nam phrik&quot;).

Sometimes, in Thai restaurants outside of Thailand, Thai eggplants are replaced by locally available eggplants.

In Cambodian cuisine, they are often served raw with dipping sauce or cooked in stews. One of the most popular Cambodian steak sauces known as &quot;tuk prahok&quot; is made with the green-white variety ().

In the Philippines, they are used in Ilocano cuisine, specifically in the dishes of pinakbet and dinengdeng. Boiled eggplant is frequently served with soy sauce and calamansi or dipping sauces made from bagoong, a fermented fish or shrimp paste.

<doc id="743355" wikidata="Q11849" url="?curid=743355" title="2004 European Parliament election in Italy">
<text>The 2004 European Parliament election in Italy was held on 12 and 13 June 2004.

Italy&#x27;s highly fragmented party system made it hard to identify an overall trend, but the results were generally seen as a defeat for Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and a victory for the centre-left opposition coalition identified with Romano Prodi, who was President of the European Commission until 2004, and was widely expected to re-enter Italian politics at the next election.

The common list of The Olive Tree, comprising mainly the Democrats of the Left and The Daisy became the largest list, with an important psychological effect. However, expectations for this list were originally somewhat larger, and Massimo D&#x27;Alema had proclaimed that &quot;If the unity list reaches 33%, the government has to go&quot;.

While the &quot;Olive Tree&quot;&#x27;s performance was not as phenomenal as it had hoped, the test indicated a somewhat reduced support for the centre-right coalition. However, in European elections, Italians tend to vote in a more candidate-oriented way, giving their vote more easily to a candidate outside their usual party; this generally reduces the significance of these elections.

==Electoral system==
The pure party-list proportional representation was the traditional electoral system of the Italian Republic since its foundation in 1946, so it had been adopted to elect the Italian representatives to the European Parliament too. 

Two levels were used: a national level to divide seats between parties, and a constituency level to distribute them between candidates. Italian regions were united in 5 constituencies, each electing a group of deputies. 

At national level, seats were divided between party lists using the largest remainder method with Hare quota. All seats gained by each party were automatically distributed to their local open lists and their most voted candidates.

== Main parties and leaders ==
===Outgoing MEPs===
=== Summary of parties ===

==Results==


==Seats==

Seats are allocated to party lists on a national basis using an electoral quota, with the residue given to the lists with the largest excess over whole quotas. An electoral quota is then calculated for each list and used to allocate seats to each list in each of the five electoral regions.

<text>Nonresistance (or non-resistance) is &quot;the practice or principle of not resisting authority, even when it is unjustly exercised&quot;. At its core is discouragement of, even opposition to, physical resistance to an enemy. It is considered as a form of principled nonviolence or pacifism which rejects all physical violence, whether exercised on individual, group, state or international levels. Practitioners of nonresistance may refuse to retaliate against an opponent or offer any form of self-defense. Nonresistance is often associated with particular religious groups, such as Anabaptist Christianity.

Sometimes non-resistance has been seen as compatible with, even part of, movements advocating social change. An often-cited example is the movement led by Mohandas Gandhi in the struggle for Indian Independence. While in particular instances (e.g., when threatened with arrest) practitioners in such movements might follow the line of non-resistance, such movements are more accurately described as cases of nonviolent resistance or civil resistance.

==History==

Anabaptist Christianity, which emerged in the Radical Reformation of the 16th century, became defined by its adherence to the doctrine of nonresistance, which they teach is found in the Bible in Matthew 5:39: &quot;do not resist him who is evil.&quot;

The term &quot;nonresistance&quot; was later used to refer to the Established Church during the religious troubles in England following the English Civil War and Protestant Succession.

Nonresistance played a prominent role in the abolitionist movement in the 19th-century United States.

Leo Tolstoy, Adin Ballou, and Mahatma Gandhi were notable advocates of nonresistance. However, there were variations between them. Gandhi&#x27;s &quot;Satyagraha&quot; movement was based on a belief in resistance that was active but at the same time nonviolent, and he did not believe in using non-resistance (or even nonviolent resistance) in circumstances where a failure to oppose an adversary effectively amounted to cowardice. &quot;I do believe,&quot; he wrote, &quot;that where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence.&quot;

==Christian theology==
Christian nonresistance is based on a reading of the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus says:

Members of the Anabaptist Christian (Mennonite, Amish, Hutterite, Schwarzenau Brethren, River Brethren, Apostolic Christian and Charity Christian) denominations, Holiness Pacifists such as the Emmanuel Association of Churches and Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma), as well as other peace churches like the Quakers, in addition to the Moravian Church, have interpreted this passage to mean that people should do nothing to physically resist an enemy. According to this belief, only God has the right to execute punishments. Nonresistant Christians note that sacrificial love of Jesus resulted in his submission to crucifixion rather than vengeance. Anabaptist theology teaches:

The Moravian Church traditionally has taught the principle of nonresistance. In the Gnadenhutten massacre, members of the U.S. Militia murdered pacifist Moravian Christian Lenape at their settlement in Gnadenhutten (meaning &quot;Houses of Grace&quot; in the German language) and they became recognized as Christian martyrs:

To illustrate how nonresistance works in practice, Alexandre Christoyannopoulos offers the following Christian anarchist response to terrorism:

Author James R. Graham wrote, &quot;The Christian is not a pacifist, he is a non-participationist.&quot;

A main application of this theology for nonresistant Christians is to practice conscientious objection with respect to military conscription. In addition to conscientious objection, nonresistant practices of Old Order Mennonites, Amish, and Conservative Mennonites include rejection of the following civil practices (cf. 1 Corinthians 6:1–8): sue at law, lobby the government, hold government office, use the force of the law to maintain their &quot;rights&quot; .

<text>John Alfred Mandel (November 23, 1925June 29, 2020) was an American composer and arranger of popular songs, film music and jazz. The musicians he worked with include Count Basie, Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Anita O&#x27;Day, Barbra Streisand, Tony Bennett, Diane Schuur and Shirley Horn. He won five Grammy Awards, from 17 nominations; his first nomination was for his debut film score for the multi-nominated 1958 film &quot;I Want to Live!&quot;

==Early life==
Mandel was born in the borough of Manhattan in New York City on November 23, 1925. His father, Alfred, was a garment manufacturer who ran Mandel &amp; Cash; his mother, Hannah (Hart-Rubin), had aimed to be an opera singer and discovered her son had perfect pitch at the age of five. His family was Jewish. They moved to Los Angeles in 1934, after his father&#x27;s business collapsed during the Great Depression. Mandel was given piano lessons, but switched to the trumpet and later the trombone.

==Career==
Mandel studied at the Manhattan School of Music and the Juilliard School. In 1943, he played the trumpet with jazz violinist Joe Venuti. The following year, he worked with Billy Rogers and played trombone in the bands of Boyd Raeburn, Jimmy Dorsey, Buddy Rich, Georgie Auld and Chubby Jackson. In 1949 he accompanied the singer June Christy in the orchestra of Bob Cooper. From 1951 until 1953 he played and arranged music in Elliot Lawrence&#x27;s orchestra, and in 1953 with Count Basie. He subsequently resided in Los Angeles, where he played the bass trumpet for Zoot Sims.

A 1944 Band graduate of New York Military Academy, in Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York, he wrote jazz compositions including &quot;Not Really the Blues&quot; for Woody Herman in 1949, &quot;Hershey Bar&quot; (1950) and &quot;Pot Luck&quot; (1953) for Stan Getz, &quot;Straight Life&quot; (1953) and &quot;Low Life&quot; (1956) for Count Basie, as well as &quot;Tommyhawk&quot; (1954) for Chet Baker.

Mandel composed, conducted and arranged the music for numerous movie sound tracks. His earliest credited contribution was to &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; in 1958, which was nominated for three Grammy Awards. His other compositions include &quot;Suicide Is Painless&quot; (theme song for the movie and TV series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;), &quot;Close Enough for Love&quot;, &quot;Emily&quot; and &quot;A Time for Love&quot; (nominated for an Academy Award). &quot;Emily&quot; was a favorite of pianist Bill Evans and alto saxophonist Paul Desmond, both of whom included it in live performances until they died, and Evans included it in a duo recording with Tony Bennett. Mandel wrote numerous film scores, including the score of &quot;The Sandpiper&quot;. The love theme for that film, &quot;The Shadow of Your Smile&quot;, which he co-wrote with Paul Francis Webster, won the 1965 Academy Award for Best Original Song and the Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1966.

Mandel performed an interpretation of Erik Satie&#x27;s &quot;Gnossiennes #4 and #5&quot; on the piano for the film &quot;Being There&quot; (1979).

He won the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocal(s) in 1981 for Quincy Jones&#x27;s song &quot;Velas&quot;, and again in 1991 for Natalie Cole and Nat King Cole&#x27;s &quot;Unforgettable&quot;, and one year later once more for Shirley Horn&#x27;s album &quot;Here&#x27;s to Life&quot;.

In 2004, Mandel arranged Tony Bennett&#x27;s album &quot;The Art of Romance&quot;. Bennett and Mandel had collaborated before on Bennett&#x27;s &quot;The Movie Song Album&quot; (1966), for which Mandel arranged and conducted his songs &quot;Emily&quot; and &quot;The Shadow of Your Smile&quot;, and was also the album&#x27;s musical director.

&quot;Johnny Mandel, A Man and His Music&quot;, featuring The DIVA Jazz Orchestra and vocalist Ann Hampton Callaway was recorded live at Jazz at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Dizzy&#x27;s Club Coca-Cola in May 2010, and released by Arbors Records in March 2011.

In 2012, he worked on one of Paul McCartney&#x27;s most recent songs at the time, &quot;My Valentine&quot;. He provided the song with a new and original arrangement. It appeared on McCartney&#x27;s expanded version of his album &quot;Kisses on the Bottom&quot; in November of that year.

==Personal life, death and honors==
Mandel married Lois Lee in 1959, and Martha Blanner in 1972, and had a daughter, Marissa, born in 1976. Mandel was also the cousin of fellow film composer Miles Goodman.

Mandel was awarded an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music in 1993. He was inducted to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2010. He was a recipient of the 2011 NEA Jazz Masters Award. He subsequently received The Grammy Trustees Award in 2018, which is awarded by The Recording Academy to &quot;individuals who, during their careers in music, have made significant contributions, other than performance, to the field of recording&quot;.

Mandel died on June 29, 2020, at his home in Ojai, California. He was 94, and suffered from a heart ailment.

<text>Karstula is a municipality of Finland founded in 1867. It is located in the Central Finland region. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

Neighbouring municipalities are Kannonkoski, Kivijärvi, Kyyjärvi, Saarijärvi and Soini.

There are all together 159 lakes in Karstula. Biggest lakes are Pääjärvi, Enonjärvi and Vahanka.

== History ==
The name of Karstula is likely derived from the Savonian surname &quot;Karstunen&quot;, encountered around Ristiina since 1541. First records of the surname in Northern Tavastia (modern Central Finland) are from the 18th century. Karstula was initially a part of the Saarijärvi parish, acquiring chapel rights in 1775 under it. Karstula was allowed to become a separate parish and municipality in 1858, but separated later in 1887. Kyyjärvi was a part of Karstula until 1929, though it only acquired a separate parish in 1944.

=== Suomenselkä municipality ===
Kannonkoski, Karstula, Kivijärvi and Kyyjärvi planned to merge into the from January 1, 2022. Karstula, Kivijärvi and Kyyjärvi accepted the merger proposal, but Kannonkoski did not. After Kannonkoski left out of the planned merger, Kivijärvi also left out. The merger project of the remaining Karstula and Kyyjärvi failed at the Kyyjärvi municipal council meeting held on May 17, 2021, and the Ministry of Finance does not propose a forced merger either.

== Architecture ==
* A number of historical buildings (from the beginning of the 20th century) has been preserved in the village centre, representing the original countryside buildings of the region.
* There&#x27;s also a cottage designed by Alvar Aalto, though it is not listed in most Aalto&#x27;s biographies.

== Transport ==
Highway 13 between Kokkola and Lappeenranta, main road 58 between Kangasala and Kärsämäki and main road 77 between Kyyjärvi and Siilinjärvi pass through the Karstula municipality.

Karstula is served by OnniBus.com route Helsinki—Jyväskylä—Kokkola.

<doc id="743373" wikidata="Q56097" url="?curid=743373" title="Naomi Halas">
<text>Naomi J. Halas is the Stanley C. Moore Professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and professor of biomedical engineering, chemistry, and physics at Rice University. She is also the founding director of Rice University Laboratory for Nanophotonics, and the Smalley-Curl Institute. She invented the first nanoparticle with tunable plasmonic resonances, which are controlled by their shape and structure, and has won numerous awards for her pioneering work in the field of nanophotonics and plasmonics. She was also part of a team that developed the first dark pulse soliton in 1987 while working for IBM.

She is a Fellow of nine professional societies, including Optica, the American Physical Society, the International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Halas was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2014 for nanoscale engineering of optical resonances and lineshapes.

Her current research at Rice University focuses on studying light-matter interaction in plasmonic nanoparticles for applications in chemical sensing, biomedical sciences, catalysis, and energy.

==Education==
Halas received her bachelor&#x27;s degree from La Salle University in 1980. She obtained her master&#x27;s degree from Bryn Mawr College in 1984 and her doctorate from Bryn Mawr in 1987. She was a graduate research fellow at the IBM Thomas J Watson Research Center during her doctoral studies, during which time she developed the first &quot;dark pulse&quot; soliton with Dieter Kroekel, Giampiero Giuliani and Daniel Grischkowsky. A &quot;dark pulse&quot; soliton is a standing wave that propagates through an optical fiber without spreading and which consists of a short interruption of a light pulse. She was also part of the first research efforts focusing on time-domain terahertz spectroscopy during her time at IBM.

==Career and research==
Halas was a postdoctoral research fellow at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories before joining Rice University in 1990, where she now heads the nanoengineering research group bearing her name. She was appointed professor in the department of electrical and computer engineering and the department of chemistry in 1999, and three years later was named the Stanley C. Moore Professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering. In 2004, she became the director of the Laboratory for Nanophotonics at Rice. She has also been a professor in the department of biomedical engineering and the department of physics since 2006 and 2009, respectively.

===Plasmonic nanoshells===
Halas&#x27; work in the 21st century focuses on noble metal nanoshells covering semiconducting or insulating cores. Her research was the first to experimentally show that nanoshells with different dimensions and shapes have different plasmonic resonances, and that these resonances could therefore be tuned by changing nanoparticle geometries. Controlling light-matter interaction of these plasmonic nanoparticles includes applications in chemical sensing, catalysis, and energy harvesting, as well as photodynamic therapy and other biomedical applications.

In 2003, Halas and her colleague Jennifer L. West were awarded the &quot;Nanotechnology Now&quot; Best Discovery Award for their groundbreaking work to develop a cancer therapy based on metallic nanoshells. Halas also received the Innovator Award from the US Department of Defense Congressionally Directed Breast Cancer Research Program, and was awarded a four-year $3 million grant to conduct further research into the treatment.

===Other research===
Her research also looks at how to integrate plasmonic particles with other photonic systems. The Halas groups collaborates with the Energy Frontier Research Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to study using plasmonics to improve the energy harvesting properties of semiconductor quantum dots and nanocrystals. They use surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and surface-enhanced infrared absorption to develop single-molecule sensing techniques.

<text>Goshen College is a private Mennonite liberal arts college in Goshen, Indiana. It was founded in 1894 as the Elkhart Institute of Science, Industry and the Arts, and is affiliated with Mennonite Church USA. The college is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and has an enrollment of 824 students. While Goshen maintains a distinctive liberal Mennonite worldview and Mennonites make up 30 percent of the student body, it admits students of all religions.

Goshen College is home to &quot;The Mennonite Quarterly Review&quot; and the Mennonite Historical Library, a research library compiling one of the world&#x27;s most comprehensive collection of Anabaptist and Mennonite primary source material.

== History ==
&quot;Old&quot; Mennonites started the Elkhart Institute in Elkhart, Indiana, in August 1894, to prepare Mennonite youth for college. H.A. Mumaw, a practicing physician, first led the small operation with a group of 15 &quot;Old&quot; Mennonite ministers and laymen started a corporation named the Elkhart Institute Association. Lured by businessmen to relocate several miles away to Goshen, Indiana, the Institute moved in September 1903 and added a junior college course list, renaming itself Goshen College. By 1905, the Mennonite Board of Education had taken control of the college, dissolving the Elkhart Institute Association. After 1910, most of Goshen&#x27;s students were enrolled in college courses. There were attempts at founding a &quot;School of Agriculture&quot; and also a college-prep academy program.

The school was closed during the 1923–1924 school year by the Mennonite Board of Education but reopened the following year. One of many factors in closing the college was denominational tension due to modernist and fundamentalist Christian theologies of the 1920s and their impact on Mennonite theology at the school. In response to this crisis, many of Goshen&#x27;s faculty and dozens of students, frustrated with the Mennonite Board of Education&#x27;s decision, relocated to Bluffton College. 

When the institution was reopened, it was marked by the new leadership of president S.C. Yoder and dean Noah Oyer. 

The community became known as the &quot;Goshen Historical Renaissance&quot;.

During the 1940s, Goshen was one of the Mennonite Central Committee&#x27;s key places to form a &quot;relief training school&quot; that helped to train volunteers for unpaid jobs in the Civilian Public Service, an alternative to the Army. Many Mennonites chose the civilian service alternative because of their beliefs regarding Biblical pacifism and nonresistance. Young women pacifists volunteered for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs to demonstrate their patriotism; many worked in mental hospitals. Lois Gunden, a French professor at the college, volunteered for the Mennonite Central Committee and established an orphanage for refuge children of the Spanish Civil War and Jewish children from Rivesaltes internment camp. The children that she rescued were malnourished, in poor health, and had lice. She was awarded the title Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem for her efforts to care for and protect children.

In 1980, the college was granted care of Merry Lea Environmental Learning Center, a nature preserve that now offers Goshen&#x27;s master&#x27;s degree in Environmental Science.

In 1993, Harold and Wilma Good, longtime friends of the college, left their estate to Goshen. The estate, said to be worth many millions, consisted of the majority in stock of the J.M. Smucker Company. Wilma was a daughter of the company&#x27;s founder. The college sold the stock and added the funds to its endowment, more than doubling it.

The campus had a building boom in the late 1990s. The Goshen campus has increased from less than to with 18 major buildings.

== Publications ==
&quot;The Mennonite Quarterly Review&quot;, Mennonite Historical Library, Mennonite Church USA Archives, including Mennonite Central Committee archives, offices of &quot;The Mennonite&quot;, and it has numerous alumni connections with the broader Mennonite Church.

== Academics ==
Goshen College offers 46 majors and 52 minors for undergraduates. Some of the most popular programs are nursing, biology, business, communication, education, American Sign Language and environmental science. The college also offers a Master of Arts in Environmental Education, a master&#x27;s degree in intercultural leadership, and a master&#x27;s degree in nursing with two tracks: family nurse practitioner and clinical nurse leader. In 2014, Goshen College partnered with Eastern Mennonite University and Bluffton University to launch the Collaborative MBA program.

=== Study-Service Term ===

Students either spend a semester abroad or complete an intercultural experience in the United States. Goshen College&#x27;s &quot;Study-Service Term&quot; (SST) is a program which approximately 80 percent of students participate in to complete their intercultural study requirement. Service may include working at a hospital, nursing home, kindergarten, or missionary service. The college has in the past also offered a domestic SST to immerse students in the Latino culture and community in northern Indiana.

== Student life ==
=== Clubs and organizations ===

Goshen College has no official fraternities or sororities; however, many different types of clubs and organizations exist to help facilitate campus life. 

==== International students ====
The International Students Club (ISC) hosts the Coffeehouse every year, an event during which international students demonstrate their artistic talents. Students are also given the opportunity, through Global Citizenship, to individually talk about their culture, and have it published by the Goshen College newspaper.

==== Intramural athletics ====
Intramural athletics are also offered. Throughout the year, students can participate in the coed sports of outdoor soccer, volleyball, sand volleyball, kickball, ping-pong, pickleball, touch football, ultimate frisbee, wiffleball, basketball, indoor soccer, and 3-on-3 basketball.

=== Performing arts ===

Goshen College students have a variety of shows to attend in the Music Center&#x27;s Sauder Concert Hall and Rieth Recital Hall or the Umble Center, used for theatrical productions. With the addition of the Music Center to campus, the college has offered a Performing Arts Series of nationally renowned artists from across the country. Previous guests include Garrison Keillor and A Prairie Home Companion, Indigo Girls, The Wailin&#x27; Jennys, Nickel Creek, Colm Wilkinson, Chanticleer, Canadian Brass, Tokyo String Quartet, Seraphic Fire, and Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis.

=== Spiritual life ===
Although Goshen maintains that people of different faiths are welcome to the college, the school emphasizes Judeo-Christian values in regard to operation, justice, and teaching. Historically, faculty members at the school have been Christian, with a large portion adhering to Mennonite convictions.

== Athletics ==
The Goshen athletic teams are called the Maple Leafs (chosen due to the city of Goshen being referred to as &quot;The Maple City&quot;). The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Crossroads League (formerly known as the Mid-Central College Conference (MCCC) until after the 2011–12 school year) for most of its sports since the 1970–71 academic year; while its men&#x27;s volleyball competes in the Wolverine–Hoosier Athletic Conference (WHAC).

Goshen competes in 14 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, soccer, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball. Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s bowling will be added in the fall of 2023, bringing the total sports teams to 16.

On October 7, 2022, Goshen College introduced Dash, the first official mascot in school history. The name was decided in a poll amongst faculty and students. 

== Campus facilities ==
Goshen College has four dormitories, apartment living, and several small group houses. Outside the original quadrangle, Goshen&#x27;s current campus has not been the result of a single master plan. Instead, the campus has evolved eclectically from building to building as the institution grew. Four-year residency was typical until the mid-1970s, when a growing student enrollment prompted school officials to forgo building new dormitories and allow upperclassmen to live off campus. In 2005, Goshen College announced its plan to return to four-year residency. With more students on campus, the school has spent over $10 million building and renovating dorms.

The Roman Gingerich Recreation and Fitness Center was constructed in 1994 with three full-sized basketball courts, four racquetball courts, a 200-meter indoor track, climbing wall, and weight room. The fitness center is open to all students and staff, and is used by community members as well.

The $24 million Music Center, completed in October 2002, has become regionally renowned for its design and acoustics. The Music Center consists of several main sections: Sauder Concert Hall, Rieth Recital Hall, the Art Gallery, and various classrooms, practice rooms and offices. Several highlights are a central recording studio, MIDI labs, and Taylor and Boody Opus 41, a 1600-pipe tracker pipe organ, the first in the world with tempering based on alumnus Bradley Lehman&#x27;s research of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s notation. The facility was designed by Mathes Brierre Architects (design architects), Schmidt Associates (architects of record), and TALASKE (acoustics and audio consultants).

=== Sustainability ===
In 2007, then Goshen College President Jim Brenneman became a charter signatory to the American College &amp; University Presidents Climate Commitment joining with leaders of 175 other higher education institutions that have agreed to neutralize greenhouse gas emissions on their campuses. In 2008, Rieth Village at Merry Lea Environmental Learning Center of Goshen College became the first platinum-rated LEED building in Indiana. In the spring of 2013, the college took the further step of purchasing 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources through the procurement of renewable energy credits. A computerized building temperature regulation system, motion light sensors for indoor and outdoor lighting and open loop ground-source heat pumps further reduce energy consumption on campus. The campus has also converted nearly 20 percent of its lawn space to native plants and prairie restoration. Goshen College students and staff have developed a food composting system, planted a community garden, built a solar hot water collection system and continued to reduce energy consumption campus-wide. In 2014, the college earned a silver rating from the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System (STARS) report for its sustainability efforts. Through an aggressive energy reduction program and efficiency upgrades, Goshen College has reduced electric consumption by 25 percent and gas consumption by 23 percent since 2007.

=== Small Group Housing/Intentional Living Communities ===

Small Group Housing (SGH) and Intentional Living Communities (ILC) are housing options for juniors and seniors on Goshen&#x27;s campus. Started in the 1970s, SGH/ILC offers students the opportunity to live in a house arrangement, with common kitchen and living spaces. The purpose of SGH/ILC is for students to develop another living experience alternative to dormitory life. Goshen College maintains that SGH living is a privilege, and students must apply as a group to live in a residence. An application board consisting of resident directors, spiritual life, and physical plant employees review all potential candidates in the spring for the next school year. Each group must create a housing plan, division of responsibility, show examples of volunteerism, and a commitment to better the Goshen campus, as well as resolve conflict. Other factors considered in the application process include house cumulative GPA, extracurricular involvement, median age of the group, and personal faculty recommendations. Houses are then rewarded to applying groups who exemplify high academic, moral, and volunteer efforts, based on objective and subjective review.

Goshen College students have also lived in local housing not associated with the college.

=== Satellite facilities ===
Goshen College maintains Merry Lea Environmental Center in Indiana, and the J.N. Roth Marine Biology Station in Layton, Florida.

Other properties maintained by Goshen College include Witmer Woods, a arboretum with over 100 native Indiana species, and the adjacent property College Cabin (Reservoir Place), used for special events, along the Elkhart River and Millrace.

== Controversy ==

=== National anthem ===
On January 21, 2010, The President&#x27;s Council announced a change to Goshen&#x27;s long-standing policy, and thus allowing an instrumental version of the national anthem to be played prior to some college sporting events. This decision led to complaints from students, faculty, and alumni. College art professor, John Blosser, was quoted saying, “It’s obviously about a battle. It’s rather violent. It’s about using violence to conquer and that would be something that many people here would have problems with.” In response, Goshen&#x27;s Board of Directors reversed the President&#x27;s Council decision after seeking extensive input from the college community.

The incident thrust Goshen College into the national limelight that June when several reports on Fox News publicized the fact that the college refused to play the national anthem, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner,&quot; at its athletic events. Two Goshen city councilmen publicly criticized the college, with one referring to the decision as &quot;anti-American&quot; and stating that &quot;instead of living here in Goshen, they should go down and live in Cuba or Iran, then have them come back and see if their attitude has changed.&quot; The college, affiliated with Mennonite Church USA, which is traditionally a peace church, published an online fact sheet stating that &quot;historically, playing the national anthem has not been among Goshen College&#x27;s practices because of our Christ-centered core value of compassionate peacemaking seeming to be in conflict with the anthem’s militaristic language.&quot;

The college&#x27;s then president, Dr. James E. Brenneman, announced on August 19, 2011, that as an alternative, &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; would be played before select athletic events.

=== Same-sex marriage ===
Goshen, along with sister school Eastern Mennonite University (EMU), created a stir within the Christian college community in July 2015, when the two became the first Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU) member schools to add &quot;sexual orientation&quot; to their anti-discrimination policy, clearing the way for the hiring of openly gay employees. The decision created a rift in the CCCU, which lobbies, among other things, on behalf of the rights of Christian schools to hire employees who adhere to orthodox Christian teachings on marriage. Two CCCU member-schools – Union University and Oklahoma Wesleyan University (OKWU) – had already resigned from the organization in protest, and up to forty other member schools were poised to follow the lead of Union and OKWU, before Goshen and EMU voluntarily withdrew their membership from the organization.

== Notable people ==

Goshen&#x27;s motto, &quot;Culture for Service&quot; is evident in many graduates and faculty. Below is a partial list of notable people who have been associated with the college:

== Center for Intercultural Teaching and Learning ==
On October 25, 2006, Goshen College announced that it was the recipient of a $12.5 million Lilly grant to create the Center for Intercultural Teaching and Learning (CITL). The purpose of this grant was to research challenges that come with changing demographics in rural towns with small colleges. Goshen College is located in Elkhart County which had a large and rapidly growing Latino population at the time (12.6 percent of the population in 2006). Despite growing minority populations, Indiana&#x27;s minority enrollment in its colleges and universities has only increased two percent.

== Traditions ==
* Goshen&#x27;s motto, &quot;Culture for Service,&quot; was coined by president Noah E. Byers in 1903
* Goshen&#x27;s school colors, purple and white, were modeled after Northwestern University, where President Byers attended and after which he wanted to model Goshen
* One of the college&#x27;s many traditions is &quot;sampling&quot; sap from the city of Goshen&#x27;s official Maple Tree, located on campus, and &quot;testing&quot; how many more weeks of winter there will be. Professors from the science department bring out their equipment with much fanfare to determine the official length of winter. In 2006, the maple tree was removed because of disease rotting the hardwood and was replaced by a new tree, now the official maple tree of Goshen. In 2007, new president Jim Brenneman replaced this tradition (which probably resulted in the early death of the maple) with &quot;Weather or Not Day&quot;; a day celebrating Northern Indiana&#x27;s fickle weather
* Early (1925) advertisements for the college were refreshingly direct. One said &quot;Goshen [is] not the best college in the United States. But it is better than the rest for Mennonite young people.&quot;

=== College seal ===
Goshen College seal signifies the book that all alumni have signed since graduation, and the lamp signifies the enlightenment that comes with education. As a Christian school, the book also signifies the importance of word, as well as God&#x27;s call for his people to be &quot;light to the world.&quot;

They are one of 42 Anishinaabeg First Nations in Ontario that belong to the Anishinabek Nation Grand Council.

==History==
The Chippewa (also generally called Ojibwe in Canada) are an Anishinaabe-speaking indigenous nation with people within the borders of present-day Canada and the United States.

===Land dispute===

In 1942 during World War II, the federal government appropriated land at Stony Point under the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; to build a military camp, Camp Ipperwash, after offering payment to the Chippewa of Kettle and Stony Point First Nations. Their offer was rejected. The government had originally made as part of the offer a promise to return the land but continued to use it after the war. By the 1990s, it was primarily a summer training camp for cadets. Residents were evicted, and moved into the Kettle Point First Nation, with unhappy consequences and social tension.

In the 1990s, during rising political activism, band members who had ties to the Stony Point reserve began occupying parts of the base in 1993. The military withdrew entirely in 1995. On Labour Day 1995, band members barricaded part of neighbouring Ipperwash Provincial Park to promote their land claim. They said they were protecting a native burial ground and water purification plant. During a confrontation with Ontario Provincial Police at the protest, an Ojibwe (Anishinaabe) man, KSPFN band member, Dudley George, was shot and killed.

In 1997, acting Sgt. Kenneth Deane was convicted of criminal negligence causing George&#x27;s death. Native groups called for an official inquiry into George&#x27;s death, but none was launched until the provincial government changed in 2003. The Ipperwash Inquiry began in 2004 and concluded in 2006. Commissioner Sidney B. Linden delivered his report in 2007.

An Agreement in Principle, dated 1998, was never officially accepted by the First Nation, and the claim was still outstanding as of 2007. Ontario officially returned the land to the First Nation in 2009, but they will govern it together for some time, in order to manage environmental and other issues. In 2015 a $90 million land claim was settled and paid to the First Nation with respect to the Camp Ipperwash-Stony Point claim, a separate but related claim to the Ipperwash Provincial Park claim. Distributions took three forms: 1) Location ticket heirs received $150,000 for each &quot;location ticket&quot; that was extinguished in 1942, 2) $10,000 for seniors 55+ years old, and 3) $5000 for members 18–54 years old. The members under 18 years old at time of settlement had their $5000 distribution put into a collective trust account to be released upon turning 18 years of age.

The Investigation Agreement to determine the environmental impacts of the military base on the land began in 2006. The investigation will provide the basis for environmental amelioration, if necessary. In addition, Cultural, Environmental and UXO investigations are underway. The Government of Canada, along with the First Nation, is working closely with an independent contractor selected through the Public Works Canada-tendering process, as well as with special advisors with the necessary expertise to oversee the project. The cleanup may prove difficult since the base was used as a firing range for tanks. Unexploded ordnance has been found.

==Demographics==
In May 2008, the resident population was 1260, of whom about 900 members lived off the reserve. As of January 2011, the band had a total of 2219 registered members, of whom 1300 live on their own reserve, 20 live on another reserve, and 899 don&#x27;t live on a reserve. By July 2012, the number of registered members had increased to 2337, of whom 1316 live on the reserve.

==Geology==

Kettle Point is the site of a rare outcrop of an Upper Devonian shale called the Kettle Point Formation. This rock layer is exposed at the tip of the point near the shore of Lake Huron. A fragmentary fossil &quot;Dunkleosteus&quot;, named &quot;D. amblyodoratus&quot; or &#x27;blunt spear&#x27;, was found there. Spherical or ovoid concretions of rock, locally called &quot;kettles&quot;, weather out of the shale along the shoreline. To the local Anishinabek, the rare stones were thunderbird eggs. The concretions are now protected but are often found on nearby properties.

Just offshore, below the Kettle Point formation, is a layer of the Hamilton Group of shales and limestones which contains a large amount of light-coloured, high-quality chert. In stone tool technology, it is a highly prized resource. Approximately ten thousand years ago during the Lake Stanley unconformity, when lake levels were lower during the retreat of the Wisconsinian ice sheets, the chert was exposed and could be mined. Evidence of this has been found at the nearby Parkhill site dating from 7800 to 8800 BC. Kettle Point chert was dispersed to the far reaches of the region as projectile points, scrapers, and other tools.

<doc id="743386" wikidata="Q107790" url="?curid=743386" title="The Green Book (Gaddafi)">
<text>The Green Book ( &quot;&quot;) is a short book setting out the political philosophy of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. The book was first published in 1975. It is said to have been inspired in part by &quot;The Little Red Book&quot; (&quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung&quot;). Both were widely distributed both inside and outside their country of origin, and &quot;written in a simple, understandable style with many memorable slogans&quot;.

An English translation was issued by the People’s Establishment for Publication, Distribution, and Advertising, an organ of the Libyan People&#x27;s Committee, and a bilingual English-Arabic edition was issued in London by Martin, Brian &amp; O&#x27;Keeffe in 1976.

During the First Libyan Civil War in 2011, during which Gaddafi himself was killed, copies of the book were burned by anti-Gaddafi demonstrators, and monuments to &quot;The Green Book&quot; demolished.

==Influence==

=== In Libya ===
According to British author and former Greater London Council member George Tremlett, Libyan children spent two hours a week studying the book as part of their curriculum. Extracts were broadcast every day on television and radio. Its slogans were also found on billboards and painted on buildings in Libya.

=== International ===
By 1993 lectures and seminars on &quot;The Green Book&quot; had been held at universities and colleges in France, Eastern Europe, Colombia, and Venezuela.

On a state visit to Libya in 2008, socialist Bolivian President Evo Morales cited the Green Book as a major influence on his political beliefs and policies.

==Contents==
&quot;The Green Book&quot; consists of three parts and has 110 pages:
* The Solution of the Problem of Democracy: The Authority of the People (published in late 1975)
* The Solution of the Economic Problem: Socialism (published in early 1977)
* The Social Basis of the Third International Theory (published in September 1981)

=== Views ===
&quot;The Green Book&quot; rejects both capitalism and communism, as well as representative democracy. Instead, it proposes a type of direct democracy overseen by the General People&#x27;s Committee which allows direct political participation for all adult citizens.

The book states that &quot;Freedom of expression is the natural right of every person, even if they choose to behave irrationally, to express his or her insanity.&quot; &quot;The Green Book&quot; states that freedom of speech is based upon public ownership of book publishers, newspapers, television, and radio stations, on the grounds that private ownership would be undemocratic.

A paragraph in the book about abolishing money is similar to a paragraph in Friedrich Engels&#x27; &quot;Principles of Communism&quot;. Gaddafi wrote: &quot;The final step is when the new socialist society reaches the stage where profit and money disappear. It is through transforming society into a fully productive society, and through reaching in production a level where the material needs of the members of society are satisfied. On that final stage, profit will automatically disappear and there will be no need for money.&quot;

==Summary==

The following table gives a chapter-by-chapter summary of the book.

==Reception==
George Tremlett has called the resulting media dull and lacking in a clash of ideas. Dartmouth College Professor Dirk Vandewalle describes the book as more a collection of aphorisms than a systematic argument. U.S. Ambassador David Mack called the book quite jumbled, with various ideas including &quot;a fair amount of xenophobia&quot; wrapped up in &quot;strange mixture&quot;.

Writing for the British Broadcasting Corporation, the journalist Martin Asser described the book as follows: &quot;The theory claims to solve the contradictions inherent in capitalism and communism... In fact, it is little more than a series of fatuous diatribes, and it is bitterly ironic that a text whose professed objective is to break the shackles... has been used instead to subjugate an entire population.&quot;

The book caused a scandal in 1987, when West German ice hockey club ECD Iserlohn, led by Heinz Weifenbach, signed a US$900,000 advertising deal for the book.

On a 2008 visit to Libya, it was reported by Libyan state media that Bolivian President Evo Morales remarked &quot;I read the Green Book, studied it and I am enthusiastic about the thinking spelled out in the Green Book&quot;.

<doc id="743387" wikidata="Q410546" url="?curid=743387" title="Neostigmine">
<text>Neostigmine, sold under the brand name Bloxiverz, among others, is a medication used to treat myasthenia gravis, Ogilvie syndrome, and urinary retention without the presence of a blockage. It is also used in anaesthesia to end the effects of non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking medication. It is given by injection either into a vein, muscle, or under the skin. After injection effects are generally greatest within 30 minutes and last up to 4 hours.
Common side effects include nausea, increased saliva, crampy abdominal pain, and slow heart rate. More severe side effects include low blood pressure, weakness, and allergic reactions. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. Neostigmine is in the cholinergic family of medications. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholinesterase and therefore increases the levels of acetylcholine.
Neostigmine was patented in 1931. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. The term is from Greek &quot;neos&quot;, meaning &quot;new&quot;, and &quot;-stigmine&quot;, in reference to the alkaloid, physostigmine, which inspired its design. It is available as a generic medication.

== Medical uses ==
It is used to improve muscle tone in people with myasthenia gravis, and also to reverse the effects of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants such as rocuronium and vecuronium at the end of an operation.

Another indication for use is the conservative management of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, or Ogilvie&#x27;s syndrome, in which patients get massive colonic dilatation in the absence of a true mechanical obstruction.

Neostigmine is often prescribed for underactive urinary bladder.

Hospitals sometimes administer a solution containing neostigmine intravenously to delay the effects of envenomation through snakebite. Some promising research results have also been reported for administering the drug nasally in order to buy time if anti-venom is not immediately available.

== Side effects ==

Neostigmine has a wide variety of side-effects due to its action that increases acetylcholine (ACh) binding muscarinic receptors on exocrine glandular cells throughout the body, cardiac muscle cells, and smooth muscle cells. These effects include: salivation, lacrimation, diarrhea, bradycardia, and bronchoconstriction. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur earliest.

For this reason, it is usually given along with an anti-cholinergic drug such as atropine or glycopyrrolate which act only on muscarinic receptors while permitting neostigmine action at nicotinic receptors. 

Neostigmine can also induce generic ocular side effects including: headache, brow pain, blurred vision, phacodonesis, pericorneal injection, congestive iritis, various allergic reactions, and rarely, retinal detachment.

== Pharmacology ==

Acetylcholine is metabolized by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase that cleaves acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction into acetate and choline. Neostigmine is an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. Neostigmine binds to the anionic and ester site of acetylcholinesterase, which blocks the enzyme from breaking down the acetylcholine molecules before they reach the postsynaptic membrane receptors. 
Its action leads to the accumulation of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction that compete with the non-depolarizing blocker agent bound to the acetylcholine receptors. By interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, neostigmine indirectly stimulates both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors.

Unlike physostigmine, neostigmine has a quaternary nitrogen; hence, it is more polar. It does not cross the blood–brain barrier and enter the CNS. 

Neostigmine is administered intravenously. The drug should be administered when a peripheral nerve stimulator shows a second twitch is present or when the first twitch response is considerably above 10% of baseline. Peak effect is at 7 to 10 minutes. Neostigmine has moderate duration of action – usually two to four hours. It is metabolized by enzymes in the liver and excreted in the urine.

==Chemistry==
Neostigmine, which can be viewed as a simplified analog of physostigmine, is made by reacting 3-dimethylaminophenol with &quot;N&quot;-dimethylcarbamoyl chloride, which forms the dimethylcarbamate, and its subsequent alkylation using dimethyl sulfate forming the desired compound.

=== Spectral data ===

Neostigmine shows notable UV/VIS absorption at 261 nm, 267 nm, and 225 nm.

Neostigmine&#x27;s 1H NMR Spectroscopy reveals shifts at:
7.8, 7.7, 7.4, 7.4, 3.8, and 3.1 parts per million. The higher shifts are due to the aromatic hydrogens. The lower shifts at 3.8 ppm and 3.1 ppm are due to the electronic withdrawing nature of the tertiary and quaternary nitrogen, respectively.

==History ==

Neostigmine was first synthesized by Aeschlimann and Reinert in 1931 and was patented by Aeschlimann in 1933.

Neostigmine is made by first reacting 3-dimethylaminophenol with &quot;N&quot;-dimethylcarbamoyl chloride, which forms a dimethylcarbamate. Next, that product is alkylated using dimethyl sulfate, which forms neostigmine.

<doc id="743390" wikidata="Q1644576" url="?curid=743390" title="Gall Force">
<text>is a metaseries of science fiction anime OVAs by the studios Artmic and AIC, with production by Youmex. The original character designs were by Kenichi Sonoda, though these were dropped for the &quot;Gall Force: The Revolution&quot; remake. Central Park Media has licensed most of the films and OVAs with the exceptions of &quot;Ten Little Gall Force&quot;, &quot;Scramble Wars&quot;, and &quot;The Revolution&quot;.

==Background==
===&quot;Star Front Gall Force&quot;===
This was the origin and precursor to the &quot;Gall Force&quot; franchise. Originally appearing in the monthly &quot;Model Graphix&quot; magazine in Japan as a 3D photo novel using detailed models, this later set the stage for the animated films. Rabby, Patty, and Rumy were the only main Solnoid characters featured, and they were equipped with different uniforms, weapons, and vehicles than those shown in the regular Gall Force OVAs. Although it was the first-ever storyline to the &quot;Gall Force&quot; mythos proper, Star Front&#x27;s place in the official continuity has been questioned and disregarded due to contradictions between it and Eternal Story. Although it is the actual origin of the franchise, it is now seen by fans as non-canon, or an alternate timeline. Another factor that causes question is the fact that fans outside Japan never knew of the photo novel&#x27;s existence.

==Story==
The original timeline for the Gall Force series consist of four story arcs: &quot;First Story Arc&quot;, &quot;Rhea Arc&quot;, &quot;Earth Chapter Arc&quot; and &quot;New Era Arc&quot;. Within each arc there are several episodes, with the exception of &quot;Rhea&quot;.

===Original trilogy===
The first arc starts with the centuries-long war between the Paranoids and the Solnoids, the exodus of early humanity to planet Terra, and the death of the &quot;Star Leaf&quot; crew. The timeline ends with events that will lead to the &quot;Rhea Arc&quot;. The first story arc consists of three episodes;

Gall Force: Eternal Story

: In the distant past, two advanced civilizations, the amoeba-like Paranoids and the all-female Solnoids, are waging a war that has gone on for many centuries. When the Solnoid fleet leaves a battle to defend an experimentally terraformed world from the Paranoids, one damaged Solnoid ship is separated from the fleet. This ship is a Kularis-class cruiser named the &quot;Star Leaf&quot;. Aboard the ship are only seven women: Eluza; the highest ranking officer on board, second-in-command Rabby, Pilot Lufy, Officers Catty, Pony, &amp; Patty, and Ensign Rumy. After narrowly escaping a battle, the &quot;Star Leaf&quot; crew decides to continue with their orders and at planet Chaos to defend it. However, their ship is the subject of an experiment, a plan which was secretly hatched by the leaders of both races which came into fruition during the battle, and the unsuspecting crew of seven Solnoid soldiers aboard the ship is caught up in the middle. The &quot;Star Leaf&quot; crew must now defend the artificial paradise of Chaos from the Paranoid fleet and foil the plans of the Solnoid leaders.

In 1985 a previous English dub for &quot;Gall Force: Eternal Story&quot; was released by Intervision Video with an unknown cast. This dub was later included as bonus feature on Central Park Media&#x27;s DVD release.

Gall Force 2: Destruction

: Ten years later, one of the two survivors of the &quot;Star Leaf&quot;, Lufy, is recovered from space by Solnoid forces. There, she is confronted with the secret plan which had become reality in the previous episode: to genetically unite both races, codenamed the &quot;Species Unification Plan&quot;. Wracked by self-doubt, Lufy is forced to make a decision as Solnoids and Paranoids face each other in battle in the very solar system in which the new life form and the last &quot;Star Leaf&quot; survivor have established an existence—and the Solnoid army, who are unaware of the plan, intend to deploy a System Destroyer to wipe out the enemy once and for all.

Gall Force 3: Stardust War

: The destruction of the new future for Terra is averted, but Lufy and her friends find themselves in another twist: in a desolate solar system named &quot;Sigma Narse&quot;, the Solnoids and Paranoids intend to finish the war by fighting to the last by using their Planet Destroyers—which will result in the destruction of both sides, leaving them nothing but stardust in its wake (hence the title &quot;Stardust War&quot;). An encounter with the Solnoid instigator of the secret plan convinces the crew to try and walk a different path: To attempt to convince both sides to stop the senseless fighting by reminding them what they have already lost...


===Rhea Arc===

&quot;Rhea Gall Force&quot; takes place in the aftermath of the &quot;Stardust War&quot;, but before the events of &quot;Earth Chapter&quot;. In the 21st century the Earthen discovery of derelict alien technology on the Moon—which are in fact the remnants of the events in &quot;Eternal Story&quot;—ignited an arms race as the &quot;Western&quot; and &quot;Eastern&quot; blocs rushed to deploy the technology as weapons, including a form of artificial life based on the Paranoids, the MME. This artificial life turned on humanity, starting a war of extermination against their creators.

&quot;Rhea Gall Force&quot; plot summary

In the year 2084, scientist Grey Newman found and reverse-engineered the technology from a Solnoid ship found on the Moon (see &quot;Eternal Story&quot;) and unintentionally brought about the end of civilization. World War III breaks out and in the middle of battle, the human&#x27;s own alien synthezoids turn against their creators, nearly annihilating humankind.

Later in the year 2085, the remaining humans are on the run from the machines who are terminating them. In order to survive to defeat the alien machines, the human race must leave Earth, and go to Mars. Among these voyagers is one woman who bears the burden of guilt for her father&#x27;s contribution to the destruction of civilization.
===Earth Chapter ===
The &quot;Earth Chapter Arc&quot; continues the story from &quot;Rhea Arc&quot; with reincarnations of the &quot;Star Leaf&quot; crew. After the completion of Operation Exodus, the earth resistance must survive long enough for the arrival of the Mars reinforcements led by General McKenzie. It consists of three episodes.

Earth Chapter 1

:In the year 2085, the Earth is now a wasteland ruled by war machines that won an apocalyptic war. Shortly after that battle, mankind left and began new life on Mars. However, Sandy Newman and her comrades are left on Earth. While struggling to survive, the group locates an abandoned nuclear missile launch site. There they must contend with a -religious group called Geo Chris which plans to make the Earth green once more. However to defeat the war machines of the enemy known as the MME, the earth resistance must use the nuclear missiles to attack the MME&#x27;s citadel, but doing so would carry a heavy price.

Earth Chapter 2

:On Mars, the viability of the final stages of Operation Exodus is debated, with the Martian military preferring a plan to use a Plasma cannon based on ancient Solnoid technology to destroy the MME citadel and end the war in one strike. The displaced earth resistance members of Operation Exodus and their allies in the Mars military disobey orders and take a ship to earth. On earth, GORN, the leader of the MME, captures Sandy Newman in order to obtain access to Earth&#x27;s orbital weapons, which it plans to use to prevent the Martian assault. Sandy Newman and GORN must work together to prevent the Mars forces from destroying the earth&#x27;s chance of survival.

Earth Chapter 3
:The crew of the Martian vessels sent to Earth in Chapter 2 fight alongside the earth resistance in the final battles of the war with the MME. The main Mars forces have finally arrived as well, and their combined forces finally allow an assault on the MME&#x27;s Citadel. The war will soon come to an end as Sandy comes face-to-face with GORN, but in doing so the truth behind the entire conflict is revealed.

===New Era===
&quot;New Era&quot; concludes the story from &quot;Earth Chapter&quot;, but takes place about 200 years later. It consists of two episodes.

New Era Plot Summary

After centuries of war between humans and the MME machines, the humans have won the battle. However, many lives were lost and the Earth was rendered terribly damaged and unstable to live on. Shortly afterwards, mankind began to restore Earth, and a new race of cyborgs called &quot;Yumans&quot; had begun to live with the humans. In desire for a better future, humanity is now linked in one large computer network. However, a conflict between the Humans and Yumans shortly began. Considering themselves far better than the human, the Yumans began to plot a takeover. Now humanity lives separated into tightly packed arcologies built around the world, each keeping minimal contact with the other and dealing with internal problems like overpopulation.

A young scientist named Nova, influenced by revolutionary leader of the Yumans, Genova, develops his own plans to bring humanity down. Using the tools he&#x27;s acquired over the years, he awakens artificial intelligence to destroy all human life, by reprograming ev

ery computer on Earth with the GORN virus. The virus is actually a bit more than Nova predicted, due to its intent on wiping out both humans and Yumans from the solar system. With the entire system now connected once more after all the wars, GORN is able to bring his presence everywhere in his attempt to achieve his long-term goals.

GORN&#x27;s plans are not a surprise to Catty, for she has foreseen the disaster and sets her own plan into motion just before the virus strikes. Being a Yuman with heart, she leads a force of seven women into the final battle between man and machine!

==Alternate series and releases==

===&quot;Gall Force: The Revolution&quot;===
This 1996 OVA was a reimagining of the series, which replaced the amorphous Paranoids with a seemingly endless civil war between the &quot;West Force&quot; and &quot;East Force&quot; Solnoid armies. Unlike the previous OVAs&#x27; more somber and apocalyptic tones, &quot;The Revolution&quot; is a more traditional sci-fi adventure story, although it still stresses on the tragedies and wide-scale destruction caused by war. Four episodes were produced, along with one soundtrack album and a &quot;vocal collection&quot; starring the main female cast singing various songs, one of which being a &quot;remake&quot; of &quot;Disguised Spies&quot; from one of the original saga&#x27;s soundtracks.

The plot tells of the struggle between the West Force and East Force armies of the Solnoids, which threatens to escalate into total destruction of the Solnoid race as both sides search for the ultimate war weapon, the anti-matter gun. By happenstance, however, several troopers from the East Force (Eluza, Rabby, Patty, and Rumy) and the West Force (Lufy) encounter the Conch, an outlawed Solnoid anti-war organization which is trying to spread peace among the hostile parties. As they discover that the war is merely used as an insidious instrument of balance by one singular Solnoid party, the rogue Solnoid troopers unwittingly find themselves fighting for an idea completely alien to them, but which presents the only way of stopping this perpetuated madness.

===&quot;Ten Little Gall Force&quot; &amp; &quot;Scramble Wars&quot;===
The 1988 omake was an animated mockumentary detailing a behind-the-scenes look at the production of &quot;Gall Force: Eternal Story&quot; and &quot;Destruction&quot; from the First Story Arc. Characters were drawn as super deformed versions of their Eternal Story counterparts. This video maintained a comedic tone as opposed to the somewhat serious war story in the original video it was supposedly documenting.

 (released 1992) is a humorous Japanese take on &quot;Wacky Races&quot; in which characters from several major series produced by Artmic—&quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot;, &quot;Gall Force&quot;, &quot;Genesis Survivor Gaiarth&quot;, among others—compete for a trillion dollar-heavy trophy sponsored by the megacorporation Genom. The amount of this prize brings out the worst of many of the main characters, and even weapons of mass destruction are brought to bear against the competition.

&quot;Ten Little Gall Force&quot; was released along with &quot;Scramble Wars&quot; in the United States by AnimEigo on a single VHS video titled &quot;Super-Deformed Double Feature&quot;. Strangely, as of this time, these have not been released on DVD as with the other &quot;Gall Force&quot; titles and are (in their VHS release) much-sought rare collector&#x27;s items.

<doc id="743391" wikidata="Q4931971" url="?curid=743391" title="Bob Budiansky">
<text>Bob Budiansky (; born March 15, 1954) is an American comic book writer, editor, and penciller, best known for his work on Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Transformers&quot; comic. He also created the Marvel character Sleepwalker and wrote all 33 issues of that comic.

==Early life==
Budiansky was born in The Bronx, New York, where he attended public school, then went on to the State University of New York at Buffalo. He was &quot;reintroduced&quot; to comics while in college during the early 1970s. His first published work was &quot;Superrunt&quot; — a comic strip collaboration with Charles &quot;Sparky&quot; Alzamora, published in the University at Buffalo newspaper &quot;The Spectrum&quot; while he was a student there.

==Career==
Budiansky worked at Marvel Comics for approximately 20 years. He is responsible for much of the writing of the original Marvel &quot;Transformers&quot; comic, and conceived the names of most of the original Transformers, including Decepticon leader Megatron, Autobot medic Ratchet, Starscream, Sideswipe, and the Decepticon Ravage. He also wrote the vast majority of the descriptive &quot;tech spec&quot; biographies printed on the Transformers toy packages that Hasbro produced in the 1980s, giving each figure unique personality traits.

After a long hiatus from the &quot;Transformers mythos&quot;, Budiansky scripted a new adaptation of the original 1986 &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot; for IDW Publishing in 2006 in honor of the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

Budiansky is also a penciller. He drew the final years of the Johnny Blaze/Zarathos version of Ghost Rider, as well as drawing the majority of &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; covers from 1978 to 1983 and co-plotting the series with its final writer, J. M. DeMatteis. Following the cancellation of &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, Budiansky and DeMatteis continued this method of collaboration in the limited series &quot;Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner&quot;. Budiansky recalled, &quot;Marc would typically map out the story arc, discuss it with me, I&#x27;d give him feedback, maybe come up with a few extra plot twists and turns, and suggest some scenes that might juice up the story visually. ... Marc had this four-issue story arc more nailed down than some of the &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; stories we worked on together, so I think I contributed less to the &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; plots.&quot; Budiansky&#x27;s covers for &quot;Prince Namor&quot; are an early example of interlocking covers; when the covers are placed together in two rows, the backgrounds flow into each other.

From 1983 till 1996, Budiansky was on staff at Marvel as an editor. During this period, Budiansky oversaw such titles as &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, &quot;Daredevil&quot; and Spider-Man.

===Honors===
At BotCon 2010, Hasbro named Budiansky as one of the first four human inductees in the Transformers Hall of Fame for his contributions to the creation of the franchise.

==Personal life==
Budiansky married Angela Goldman in August 1991.

<text>Branko Oblak (born 27 May 1947) is a Slovenian football coach and former international player. He usually played as an attacking midfielder or deep-lying playmaker.

==Playing career==
Brane, as he is often known, started playing football at the youth team of Svoboda. In 1965 he went to Ljubljana&#x27;s more famous club, Olimpija. He made his debut on 20 May 1966 against Partizan in Belgrade, where he scored both Olimpija&#x27;s goals for a 1–2 win. He stayed with Olimpija until 1973. During that time he played 181 matches and scored 33 goals.

In 1973, he moved to Hajduk Split and stayed there for two seasons. In both seasons Hajduk won the national champion and cup winner titles. In 1975, he signed a two-year contract with Schalke 04 of the German Bundesliga for what was a world record fee for that season. In the 1976–77 season, Oblak&#x27;s second year at the club, Schalke 04 finished the league in second place, behind Borussia Mönchengladbach. In the summer of 1977, Oblak went to Bayern Munich. He stayed there for three seasons and in his final season with the club (1979–80), Bayern became the German champion. After that, Oblak played in various Austrian amateur clubs until 1987, when he retired as a football player.

During the 1945–1990 period, Oblak was among only a handful of Slovenian players, along with Srečko Katanec and Danilo Popivoda, who managed to get into the Yugoslavia national team.

Oblak&#x27;s debut for the Yugoslavia national team came in a friendly match against Romania in 1971. The same year he had the honour of playing at Pelé&#x27;s farewell match at the Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro. At the 1974 World Cup in Germany, he and his teammate Danilo Popivoda became the first Slovenians to play in a World Cup. Even more impressive is that Oblak was selected into the best squad of the World Cup. In 1976, he played at the European Championship, which was hosted by Yugoslavia. His excellent pass for the first goal in the semi-final match against Germany is still remembered among football experts. After the tournament, he retired from international football. In altogether 46 matches he scored six goals.

==Coaching career==

After retirement as a football player, Oblak started coaching at various Slovenian clubs, including three times at Olimpija Ljubljana, NK Naklo and FC Koper. He proved to be a good youth coach, so in February 2004 he was named the new Slovenia under-21 national coach. On 24 May 2004, he replaced Bojan Prašnikar as the head coach of the Slovenia national football team. The team started brightly under his guidance, with the highlight being a 1–0 over Italy (eventual World Champions) in a World Cup qualifying match. However, the team soon ran into a series of bad results, and the pressure mounted on Oblak, until finally in late 2006, he was fired from the job. He was succeeded by Matjaž Kek. In 2009, he again took the managers job at his home club NK Olimpija Ljubljana. He was relieved of his duties after only four games.

In November 2003, UEFA member football associations organized surveys to find the best national players in 50-year period of existence of UEFA. In Slovenia Branko Oblak was awarded this title, &quot;beating&quot; rivals such as Srečko Katanec and Zlatko Zahovič.

<text>Physostigmine (also known as eserine from &quot;éséré&quot;, the West African name for the Calabar bean) is a highly toxic parasympathomimetic alkaloid, specifically, a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor. It occurs naturally in the Calabar bean and the fruit of the Manchineel tree.

The chemical was synthesized for the first time in 1935 by Percy Lavon Julian and Josef Pikl. It is available in the U.S. under the trade names Antilirium and Isopto Eserine, and as eserine salicylate and eserine sulfate. Today, physostigmine is most commonly used for its medicinal value. However, before its discovery by Sir Robert Christison in 1846, it was much more prevalent as an ordeal poison. The positive medical applications of the drug were first suggested in the gold medal-winning final thesis of Thomas Richard Fraser at the University of Edinburgh in 1862.

== Medical uses ==
Physostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, can be used to treat glaucoma and delayed gastric emptying. Because it enhances the transmission of acetylcholine signals in the brain and can cross the blood–brain barrier, physostigmine salicylate is used to treat anticholinergic poisoning (that is, poisoning by substances that interfere with the transmission of acetylcholine signaling, such as atropine, scopolamine, and other anticholinergic drug overdoses). It is also used to reverse neuromuscular blocking. Physostigmine is the antidote of choice for &quot;Datura stramonium&quot; poisoning. It is also an antidote for &quot;Atropa belladonna&quot; poisoning, the same as for atropine. It has also been used as an antidote for poisoning with GHB, but is poorly effective and often causes additional toxicity, so is not a recommended treatment. It can also be used as an antidote for dimenhydrinate or diphenhydramine poisoning.

It has been shown to improve long-term memory, and was once explored as a therapy for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, but in clinical trials it was not shown to confer convincing benefits, and it led to very common moderate to severe side-effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and tremors, resulting in a high rate of withdrawal. Physostigmine&#x27;s poor tolerability led to it being abandoned in favor of later acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, three of which are currently in use: donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine. Recently, it has begun to be used in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension.

Recently, physostigmine has been proposed as an antidote for intoxication with gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB, a potent sedative-hypnotic agent that can cause loss of consciousness, loss of muscle control, and death). Physostigmine may counteract GHB by producing a nonspecific state of arousal. However, not enough scientific evidence shows physostigmine properly treats GHB toxicity. Furthermore, lower doses of GHB produce a stronger action at the GHB receptor than at the GABAB-receptor, resulting in a stimulating effect which would act synergistically with physostigmine and produce hyperstimulation when the GHB blood levels begin to drop.

Physostigmine also has other proposed uses: it could reverse undesired side effects of benzodiazepines such as diazepam, alleviating anxiety and tension. Another proposed use of physostigmine is to reverse the effects of barbiturates (any of a group of barbituric acids derived for use as sedatives or hypnotics).

== Pharmacology ==
Physostigmine acts by interfering with the metabolism of acetylcholine. It is a reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft of the neuromuscular junction. It indirectly stimulates both nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Physostigmine has an LD50 of 3 mg/kg in mice.

=== Bioactivity ===
Physostigmine functions as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Its mechanism is to prevent the hydrolysis of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase at the transmitted sites of acetylcholine. This inhibition enhances the effect of acetylcholine, making it useful for the treatment of cholinergic disorders and myasthenia gravis. More recently, physostigmine has been used to improve the memory of Alzheimer&#x27;s patients due to its potent anticholinesterase activity. However, its drug form, physostigmine salicylate, has poor bioavailability.

Physostigmine also has a miotic function, causing pupillary constriction. It is useful in treating mydriasis. Physostigmine also increases outflow of the aqueous humor in the eye, making it useful in the treatment of glaucoma.

== Side effects ==
An overdose can cause cholinergic syndrome. Other side effects may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, dizziness, headache, stomach pain, sweating, dyspepsia, and seizures. The carbamate functional group readily hydrolyses in water, and in bodily conditions. The metabolite thus formed from physostigmine and some other alkaloids (e.g. cymserine) is eseroline, which research has suggested may be neurotoxic to humans. Death can occur rapidly following overdose as a result of respiratory arrest and paralysis of the heart.

== Synthesis ==

Physostigmine has two stereocenters—the two carbons where the five-membered rings join—so any attempt at the total synthesis must pay attention to obtaining the correct stereoisomer. The 71 syntheses of physostigmine yield 33 racemic mixtures and 38 products of a single enantiomer. The first total synthesis of physostigmine was achieved by Julian and Pikl in 1935. The main goal of Julian&#x27;s formal physostigmine synthesis was to prepare the key compound (&quot;L&quot;)-eseroline (compound 10 in the adjacent diagram), the conversion of which to physostigmine would be straightforward. In one of his earlier works Julian synthesized the ring of physostigmine from 1-methyl-3-formyl-oxindole as starting material, which was discovered by Paul Friedländer. However, the starting material was expensive, and the reduction of a nitrile to an amine (similar to the reaction of compound 6 to give compound 7 in the diagram) with sodium and alcohol did not proceed in good yield. In his second work “Studies in the Indole Series III,” he had improved the yield of amine from nitrile significantly by using palladium and hydrogen. Although he succeeded in the synthesis of the target compound, the route had several drawbacks. First, the chemical resolution of compound 8 is unreliable, and the chemical resolution of &quot;rac&quot;-eserethole gives optically pure product only after eight recrystallizations of its tartrate salt. Second, the reductive amination going from compound 8 to compound 9 requires a large amount of Na. In the years since this initial work, many other groups have used a variety of approaches to construct the ring system and showcase new synthetic methods.

=== Biosynthesis ===
Physostigmine biosynthesis is proposed from tryptamine methylation and post-heterocyclization catalyzed by an unknown enzyme:


== History ==
=== The Calabar bean ===

The Efik people, living in Cross River State and the Ibibio people in Akwa Ibom State, in what is now the south-south of Nigeria, were the first to come in contact with physostigmine, the active ingredient in the Calabar bean. The Calabar bean, or chopping nut, was very prevalent in Efik culture as an ordeal poison. Individuals accused of witchcraft would drink the white, milky extract of the bean, made by crushing the bean in a mortar and soaking the remains in water. If the accused died, it was considered proof of their use of witchcraft. If they lived, usually due to vomiting up the poison, then they were declared innocent and sent free.

=== Western medicine&#x27;s discovery ===
In 1846, European missionaries arrived in what was referred to as Old Calabar, now part of Nigeria. These missionaries wrote about the use of the Calabar bean as a test for witchcraft. These beans eventually made their way back to Scotland, the home of these particular missionaries, where in 1855 Robert Christison, a toxicologist, tested the toxicity of the poison on himself by eating one. He survived to document the experience. The bean was studied throughout the 1860s by a few different Edinburgh scientists, including Douglas Argyll Robertson who wrote a paper on the use of Calabar bean extract on the eye and was the first to use it medicinally, and Thomas Richard Fraser, who researched how to best extract the active principle, which was later determined to be physostigmine. Fraser also studied the antagonism between physostigmine and atropine extremely rigorously, at a time when the concept of antagonism had little if any experimental support. Fraser&#x27;s research is still the basis of today&#x27;s knowledge about the interactions between atropine and physostigmine at many different and specific doses. Physostigmine&#x27;s first use as a treatment for glaucoma was by Ludwig Laqueur in 1876. Laqueur himself had glaucoma so, like Christison, he experimented on himself, although Laqueur was much more scientific and methodical in his self-treatment.

In the 1920s, Otto Loewi determined the biomechanical mechanism for the effects of physostigmine on the body. Loewi was studying how actions that we now consider to be controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system, were directed by chemicals. During his studies, Loewi discovered acetylcholine and that physostigmine acted by preventing acetylcholine inhibition. In 1936, Loewi was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on discovering acetylcholine and biological chemical transmitters.

Other important discoveries surrounding physostigmine were made at the University of Edinburgh in 1925. Edgar Stedman and George Barger determined the structure of physostigmine using a method called chemical degradation. In 1935 Percy Lavon Julian was later the first to synthesize physostigmine. English scientist Robert Robinson was also working on the synthesis of physostigmine, but surprisingly Julian, a relatively unknown scientist at the time, was the successful one.

In 1934, while working at St Alfege&#x27;s Hospital in London, Dr Mary Walker discovered that a subcutaneous injection of physostigmine could temporarily reverse the muscle weakness found in patients with myasthenia gravis. She had noted that the symptoms and signs of myasthenia were similar to those found in curare poisoning, and physostigmine was used as an antidote to curare poisoning at that time. Her article explaining the first case of myasthenia gravis being successfully treated with physostigmine was published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; in June 1934.

<doc id="743401" wikidata="Q263598" url="?curid=743401" title="Georgiy Gongadze">
<text>Georgiy Ruslanovych Gongadze (21 May 1969 – 17 September 2000) was a Georgian-Ukrainian journalist and film director who was kidnapped and murdered in 2000 near Kyiv. He founded the online newspaper &quot;Ukrainska Pravda&quot; along with Olena Prytula in 2000.

The circumstances of his death became a national scandal and a focus for protests against then-President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma. During the Cassette Scandal, audiotapes were released on which Kuchma, Volodymyr Lytvyn and other top-level administration officials are heard discussing the need to silence Gongadze for his online news reports about high-level corruption. Former Interior Minister Yuriy Kravchenko died of two gunshot wounds to the head on 4 March 2005, just hours before he was to begin providing testimony as a witness in the case. Kravchenko was the superior of the four policemen who were charged with Gongadze&#x27;s murder soon after Kravchenko&#x27;s death. The official ruling of suicide was doubted by media reports.

Three former officials of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry&#x27;s foreign surveillance department and criminal intelligence unit (Valeriy Kostenko, Mykola Protasov and Oleksandr Popovych) accused of his murder were arrested in March 2005 and a fourth one (Oleksiy Pukach, the former chief of the unit) in July 2009. A court in Ukraine sentenced Protasov to a sentence of 13 years and Kostenko and Popovych to 12-year terms March 2008 (the trial had begun January 2006) for the murder. Gongadze&#x27;s family believe the trial had failed to bring the masterminds behind the killing to justice. No one has yet been charged with giving the order for Gongadze&#x27;s murder.

==Early life and career==
Born in Tbilisi, at the time the capital of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union, Gongadze was the son of Ruslan Gongadze, a Georgian architect, and Olesya Korchak, a Ukrainian dentist and a native of Lviv. His parents met in Lviv, where they studied in university and eventually married. In 1967, the Gongadze family moved to Tbilisi. Georgiy was born as a twin, but his brother was kidnapped from the hospital soon after their birth. When Gongadze was six years old, his parents divorced. His father later remarried and had another son with his second wife. His mother did not remarry, and continued to live and work in Tbilisi until 1994.

During his school years, Gongadze was an outstanding athlete, and was part of the Soviet reserve Olympic team for the 100 and 200 metres. In addition to his native Ukrainian, he learned to speak Russian, Georgian, and English. In 1986 he enrolled in the Foreign Languages Institute in Tbilisi with a specialisation in English, but in 1987 he was drafted into the Soviet Border Troops, serving in Turkmenistan on the border with Iran. His mother said that she had to pay to avoid him being sent to Afghanistan to fight in the Soviet–Afghan War.

=== Dissolution of the Soviet Union ===
Around that time, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev started his reforms of perestroika and glasnost. The reforms sped up the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Trying to preserve the Soviet state, several armed and civil conflicts arose in the Soviet Union, among them the April 9 tragedy in which Soviet troops killed 20 unarmed civilians. This radicalised many Georgians, including Gongadze.

In May 1989, Gongadze was discharged from the Border Troops. He and his father both joined the national movement &quot;For Free Georgia&quot;; Georgiy became its spokesperson, while Ruslan became the leader. In 1989 and 1990, Georgiy travelled to the Baltic states and Ukraine in an attempt to drum up foreign support for Georgia&#x27;s independence from the Soviet Union. As part of his tour, in September 1989 he attended the first congress of the People&#x27;s Movement of Ukraine in Kyiv, where he represented For Free Georgia.

Gongadze also attended Chervona Ruta, the first non-communist music and youth festival, held in September 1989 in Chernivtsi. At the festival, he met Mariana Stetsko, whom he married in 1990, and settled in Lviv, where he found a job as a teacher of English and physical education. While working, Gongadze also studied at the Romano-Germanic Languages Faculty of the University of Lviv. On 24 August 1991, following the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine, the Verkhovna Rada announced that all residents of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic were considered to be citizens of Ukraine.

== Fighting in Georgia (1991–1992) ==
In 1991, the first president of Georgia, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, declared several of his former allies as &quot;enemies of the people&quot;, among them Ruslan Gongadze. Ruslan was forced to hide in the basement of a building next to the parliament in Tbilisi. In December 1991, a civil war ensued when government forces opened fire upon anti-Gamsakhurdia protestors in Tbilisi, while a militia armed by the oppositional parties counter-attacked. At the end of 1991 during the ongoing war, Georgiy Gongadze returned to his mother in Tbilisi. He led a team of medical emergency services transferring wounded to a hospital until snipers opened fire on them. On 14 January 1992, Gamsakhurdia fled Tbilisi and the conflict ended. The opposition took power, and Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister and communist leader of Soviet Georgia, was elected president. On 15 January 1992, Gongadze returned to Lviv, only to discover that his wife had left him.

== Life in Ukraine (1992–1993) ==

In 1992, Gongadze founded a Georgian Culture Association in Lviv, named after the Bagrationi dynasty, which served as an informational centre. During the registration of the organisation in government offices, Gongadze met Myroslava Petryshyn, his future second wife. The two of them wrote an article titled &quot;Tragedy of Leaders&quot; () about the Georgian Civil War, which was published in the Lviv newspaper &quot;Post-Postup&quot; in 1992. Later in 1992, Gongadze returned to Tbilisi again to visit his mother, who continued to work in a hospital as a nurse. At the time, he planned to leave political activism and start a business. However, after speaking with several people, he changed his mind, while his mother encouraged him to write about the victims of the Georgian Civil War. Gongadze received a camera from his mother, and filmed a documentary about the Georgian Civil War, entitled &quot;The Pain of My Land&quot; (). In February 1993, the film was shown on the Ukrainian channel UT-3.

In 1992, Abkhazia and South Ossetia proclaimed their independence from Georgia, and Georgia accused Russia of instigating conflicts in those regions. Soon new conflicts started. Gongadze volunteered to fight in Abkhazia, but was refused admission to military service by government authorities for being the son of Ruslan Gongadze and his role in promoting Georgian causes in Ukraine.

Gongadze returned to Lviv to perform his &quot;diplomatic mission&quot; in active support of Georgia in inter-ethnic conflicts. However, he was only able to find a marginal group of supporters willing to fight in Georgia, from the far-right Ukrainian National Assembly – Ukrainian People&#x27;s Self-Defence. Gongadze repeatedly visited UNA-UNSO gatherings in an attempt to find Ukrainians willing to fight. The UNA-UNSO, with its self-stated goal of &quot;exiling communists and criminals from Ukraine and overpowering Russian expansionism,&quot; coincided with those of Georgian nationalists fighting Russian-backed separatists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In July 1993, the UNA-UNSO battalion &quot;Argo&quot;, led by Dmytro Korchynsky arrived to Tbilisi and was ready for fight in Abkhazia.

== Return to Georgia (1993) ==

Gongadze, however, did not return to Georgia with the UNA-UNSO, but remained in Ukraine, where his father was undergoing cancer treatment in Kyiv. He did not survive treatment, and died on 5 August 1993, at the age of 49. Following his father&#x27;s death, Gongadze returned to Tbilisi to bury him. Afterwards, he began filming a new documentary, this one about Ukrainian fighters in Abkhazia. He obtained funds for the documentary by selling his military-issued AK-47.

By the time filming began, Russian-backed Abkhazian separatists had taken much of the lands they sought to control, and had encircled the region&#x27;s administrative centre, Sukhumi. In September 1993, in exchange for a ceasefire, the government of Georgia agreed to pull its troops and heavy armament from Sukhumi. However, Abkhazian forces soon broke the ceasefire and launched an assault on the city, which was protected only by an army of irregular detachments. President of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze, who also was present during the siege, appealed to the president of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, to stop the attack, but Yeltsin chose to ignore it.

On 17 September 1993, Gongadze left Tbilisi for Sukhumi to film the events. Upon arrival, he was mobilised for service in the Defense Forces of Georgia, and the following morning was at the frontlines along the Gumista River, where Abkhazian troops were conducting an assault. Gongadze was fighting in a trench when an artillery shell exploded above him, and shrapnel hit him in 26 places, including his right hand. The only thing preventing Gongadze&#x27;s death was his helmet, and two soldiers that had been next to him were killed in the explosion. The shrapnel remained in Gongadze&#x27;s body until his murder, and was later used to identify him.

Gongadze was quickly taken to a field hospital, where he brought attention to himself by requesting that someone return to the field, so that his bag of video cassettes would not be lost. In the field hospital, Gongadze also met Konstantin Alania, a local resident fighting among Georgian troops. That night, Gongadze and several other seriously wounded fighters were sent to Tbilisi on a plane shortly before the city fell to Abkhazian troops. Alania was left behind to continue fighting, and later managed to escape with some other militants, withdrawing through mountain corridors. In 1995, Alania left Georgia for Lviv, and coincidentally met Gongadze again. The two remained close friends for the remainder of Gongadze&#x27;s life.

In Tbilisi, Gongadze&#x27;s treatment continued, and he was tended to by his mother, still working in the military hospital. However, the situation remained tense due to food insecurity throughout Georgia. His mother tried to send him away from Georgia, but did not have enough money, as the government had not had enough money to pay hospital staff since December 1991. Gongadze&#x27;s mother managed to raise enough funds through friends and relatives and, after two weeks in Tbilisi, Gongadze returned to Lviv in October 1993, with his mother staying behind. In Ukraine, Gongadze finished production of his new documentary, and it was shown on Ukrainian television under the name &quot;Shadows of War&quot;.

== Life in Ukraine (1992–2000) ==
From 1996 to 1997, Gongadze worked for the Ukrainian television channel STB. He worked for the Kyiv-based radio station Kontynent, on which he had his own show called &quot;First Round with Georhiy Gongadze&quot;. His strongly independent line soon attracted hostility from the increasingly authoritarian government of President Leonid Kuchma; during the October 1999 presidential election, his commentaries prompted a call from Kuchma&#x27;s headquarters to say &quot;that he had been blacklisted to be dealt with after the election&quot;. In 1999, he was the press secretary for Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine leader Nataliya Vitrenko. Visiting New York City in January 2000 with other Ukrainian journalists, he warned of &quot;the strangulation of the freedom of speech and information in our state&quot;.

In April 2000, Gongadze co-founded a news website, &quot;Ukrainska Pravda&quot; (), as a means of sidestepping the government&#x27;s increasing influence over the mainstream media. He observed that following the muzzling of a prominent pro-opposition newspaper after the election, &quot;today there is practically no objective information available about Ukraine&quot;. The website specialised in political news and commentary, focusing particularly on President Kuchma, the country&#x27;s wealthy &quot;oligarchs&quot; and the official media.

In June 2000, Gongadze wrote an open letter to Ukraine&#x27;s chief prosecutor about harassment from the Security Service of Ukraine directed towards himself and his &quot;Ukrainska Pravda&quot; colleagues and apparently related to an investigation into a murder case in the southern port of Odesa. He complained that he had been forced into hiding because of harassment from the secret police, that he said he and his family were being followed, that his staff were being harassed, and that the SBU were spreading a rumour that he was wanted on a murder charge.

==Murder and initial investigations==
Gongadze disappeared on the night of 16 September 2000, after failing to return home. Foul play was suspected from the outset. The matter immediately attracted widespread public attention and media interest. Eighty journalists signed an open letter to Kuchma urging an investigation and complaining that &quot;during the years of Ukrainian independence, not a single high-profile crime against journalists has been fully resolved&quot;. Kuchma responded by ordering an immediate inquiry. This inquiry however, was viewed with scepticism. Opposition politician Hryhoriy Omelchenko stated that the disappearance had coincided with Gongadze receiving documents on corruption within the president&#x27;s own entourage. The Verkhovna Rada set up a parallel inquiry run by a special commission. Neither investigation produced any results.

Two months later, on 3 November 2000, a body was found in a forest in the Tarashcha Raion of Kyiv Oblast, some outside Kyiv, near the city of Tarashcha. The corpse had been decapitated and doused in acid, apparently to make identification more difficult; forensic investigations found that the acid bath and decapitation had occurred while the victim was still alive. The Russian-edited, Russian-language Ukrainian newspaper &quot;Segodnya&quot; (&quot;Today&quot;) reported that Gongadze had been abducted by policemen and accidentally shot in the head while seated in a vehicle, necessitating his decapitation (to avoid the bullet being recovered and matched to a police weapon). His body had been doused in petrol which had failed to burn properly, and had then been dumped. A group of journalists first identified it as being that of Gongadze, a finding confirmed a few weeks later by his wife Myroslava. In a bizarre twist, the corpse was then confiscated by the militsiya and resurfaced in a morgue in Kyiv. The authorities did not officially acknowledge that the body was that of Gongadze until the following February and did not definitively confirm it until as late as March 2003. The body was eventually identified and was to be returned to Gongadze&#x27;s family to be buried two years after his disappearance. However, the funeral never took place. As of 23 June 2006 Gongadze&#x27;s mother refused to accept the remains offered as it was not the body of her son. While visiting Kyiv in July 2006, Gongadze&#x27;s widow Myroslava emphasised that the funeral had now become a solemn family issue and the date of the funeral would soon be appointed.

On 28 November 2000, opposition politician Oleksandr Moroz publicised secret tape recordings which he claimed implicated Kuchma in Gongadze&#x27;s murder. The recordings were said to be of discussions between Kuchma, presidential chief of staff Volodymyr Lytvyn, and Interior Minister Yuriy Kravchenko, and were claimed to have been provided by an unnamed SBU officer (later named as Major Mykola Mel&#x27;nychenko, Kuchma&#x27;s bodyguard). The conversations included comments expressing annoyance at Gongadze&#x27;s writings as well as discussions of ways to shut him up, such as deporting him and arranging for him to be kidnapped and taken to Chechnya. Killing him was, however, not mentioned and doubt was cast on the tapes&#x27; authenticity, as the quality of the recordings was poor. Moroz told the Verkhovna Rada that &quot;the professionally organised disappearance, a slow-moving investigation, disregard for the most essential elements of investigation and incoherent comments by police officials suggest that the case was put together.&quot;

In September 2001, the American detective agency Kroll Inc., contracted by the pro-Kuchma political party Labour Ukraine, carried out a six-month investigation and concluded that Kuchma had nothing to do with the murder of Gongadze.

The affair became a major political scandal (referred to in Ukraine as the &quot;Cassette Scandal&quot; or &quot;Tapegate&quot;). Kuchma strongly denied Moroz&#x27;s accusations and threatened a libel suit, blaming the tapes on foreign agents. He later acknowledged that his voice was indeed one of those on the tapes, but claimed that they had been selectively edited to distort his meaning.

In November 2005, upon complaint of Gongadze&#x27;s widow, the European Court of Human Rights found Ukraine to violate right to life, right to effective remedy and prohibition of degrading treatment.

==Crisis and controversy==
The affair became an international crisis for the Ukrainian government during 2001, with the European Union expressing dissatisfaction at the official investigation, rumours of Ukrainian suspension from the Council of Europe, and censure from the OSCE, which described Gongadze&#x27;s death as a case of &quot;censorship by killing&quot; and castigated the &quot;extremely unprofessional&quot; investigation. Mass demonstrations erupted in Kyiv in February 2001, calling for the resignation of Kuchma and the dismissal of other key officials. He did sack the head of the SBU, Leonid Derkach, and the chief of the presidential bodyguard, Volodymyr Shepel, but refused to step down. The government invited the FBI to investigate, though it does not appear that this offer was ever taken up. The protests were eventually forcibly broken up by the police and protestors were evicted.

In May 2001, Interior Minister Yuriy Smirnov announced that the murder had been solved—it was attributed to a random act of violence committed by two &quot;hooligans&quot; with links to a gangster called &quot;Cyclops&quot;. Both of the killers were said to now be dead. The claim was dismissed by the opposition and by the government&#x27;s own Prosecutor-General, whose office issued a statement denying Smirnov&#x27;s claims.

Mass protests again broke out in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities in September 2002 to mark the second anniversary of Gongadze&#x27;s death. The demonstrators again called for Kuchma&#x27;s resignation but the protests again failed to achieve their goal, with police breaking up the protesters&#x27; camp.

The prosecutor of Tarascha Raion, where Gongadze&#x27;s body was found, was convicted in May 2003 for abuse of office and falsification of evidence. Serhiy Obozov was found guilty of forging documents and negligence in the investigation and was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison. However, he was immediately released due to a provision of Ukraine&#x27;s amnesty laws.

In June 2004, the government claimed that a convicted gangster identified only as &quot;K&quot; had confessed to Gongadze&#x27;s murder, although there was no independent confirmation of the claim. The ongoing investigation received a setback when a key witness died of spinal injuries apparently sustained while in police custody.

Gongadze&#x27;s death became a major issue in the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, in which the opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko pledged to solve the case if he became president. Yushchenko did become president following the subsequent Orange Revolution and immediately launched a new investigation, replacing the Prosecutor-General.

The Council of Europe&#x27;s Parliamentary Assembly adopted on 27 January 2009 Resolution 1645 on the investigation of crimes allegedly committed by high officials during the Kuchma rule in Ukraine – the Gongadze case as an emblematic example. This Resolution calls on the Ukrainian Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office to use all possible avenues of investigation to identify those who instigated and organised the murder of Giorgiy Gongadze.

==Arrests and trials==
===Arrest and trial of three former policemen and death of Kravchenko===
On 1 March 2005, President Viktor Yushchenko announced that the journalist&#x27;s suspected killers had been arrested. Prosecutor-General Svyatoslav Piskun announced the following day that the case had been solved, telling Ukrainian television that Gongadze had been strangled by employees of the Interior Ministry. Two of the alleged killers were said to be senior policemen working for the Interior Ministry&#x27;s Criminal Investigations Directorate (CID). Former Interior Minister Yuriy Kravchenko, one of those recorded with Leonid Kuchma in the Cassette Scandal, was also said to be under investigation. The two police colonels accused of the killing have been detained and a third senior policeman, identified as CID commander Oleksiy Pukach, was being sought on an international arrest warrant.

On 4 March, Kravchenko was found dead in a dacha in the elite residential area of Koncha-Zaspa, outside Kyiv. He had died from apparently self-inflicted gunshot wounds, though some speculated that he might have been assassinated to prevent him from testifying as a witness. Hryhory Omelchenko, who chaired the parliamentary committee that investigated the Gongadze case, told the &quot;New York Times&quot; that Kravchenko had ordered Pukach to abduct Gongadze on President Kuchma&#x27;s orders. Kuchma himself has denied this allegation but has since been interviewed by investigators. Kravchenko left an alleged suicide note: &quot;My dear ones, I am not guilty of anything. Forgive me, for I became a victim of the political intrigues of President Kuchma and his entourage. I am leaving you with a clear conscious, farewell.&quot;

In April or May 2005, Piskun released more details of the ongoing investigation. He told the press that after Gongadze was murdered, a second group disinterred him and re-buried him where he was eventually found, in the constituency of Socialist Party leader Oleksandr Moroz. According to Piskun, the aim was to undermine the government (led by Viktor Yushchenko when he was still Prime Minister). The second group was part of or allied with the United Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (SDPUo), a pro-oligarch party which had been hit hard by Yushchenko&#x27;s crackdown on corruption and therefore wanted to see his government toppled. According to the journal &quot;Ukraina Moloda&quot; (14 April 2005), the SDPUo moved Gongadze&#x27;s body to discredit President Leonid Kuchma and force early elections, which could have led to party leader Viktor Medvedchuk succeeding Kuchma.

The trial against three former policemen charged with the killing of Gongadze began on 9 January 2006. The other main suspect, ex-police officer, Oleksiy Pukach was believed to have fled abroad and therefore charged but not on trial. No-one had been charged for ordering the murder. On the day the trial started Gongadze&#x27;s widow, Myroslava Gongadze commented on the fact that government officials had yet to be punished for organising Gongadze&#x27;s murder, saying, &quot;They are known and they should be punished, just the same as those who will be sitting in the dock today&quot;.

In mid-March 2008, the three former police officers were sentenced to prison for the murder of Gongadze. Mykola Protasov was given a sentence of 13 years, while Valeriy Kostenko and Oleksandr Popovych were each handed 12-year terms. But so far the investigations have failed to show who ordered the murder.

===Arrest and trial of Oleksiy Pukach===
On 22 July 2009, Oleksiy Pukach, one of the chief suspects, was arrested in Zhytomyr Oblast. The former chief of the main criminal investigation department at the Ukrainian Interior Ministry&#x27;s foreign surveillance unit had lived in the house of Lidia Zagorulko who had told her neighbours that Pukach was the brother of her dead husband and that he was a former sea captain. Pukach had lived there with his real second name and original documents. At first it was reported and that he had implicated senior political figures in the murder and was ready to show the place where the journalist&#x27;s head was hidden, but this was denied two days after his arrest by his lawyer. According to the lawyer, Pukach was not supposed to provide this information to the investigators. Prosecutor-General Oleksandr Medvedko refused to comment whether Pukach named those who ordered the murder or not, saying a &quot;secret investigation&quot; was underway.

On 28 July 2009, Ukrainian media reported that the remains of Gongadze&#x27;s skull were found near Bila Tserkva, in a location specified by Pukach. According to the Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office they did find fragments of a skull there that may belong to Gongadze.

A request by Myroslava Gongadze to replace deputy prosecutor general Mykola Holomsha and investigator Oleksandr Kharchenko because of their insufficient professionalism and because they were unable to withstand political pressure and speculation surrounding the case was rejected on 30 July 2009. Her request to replace Pukach&#x27;s lawyer was also denied on 28 October 2009.

On 20 November 2009, Gongadze&#x27;s mother Olesya gave consent to an examination of fragments of the skull found in late July 2009, under the condition she could take fragments of the skull for private DNA examination she planned to conduct at a private foreign laboratory after the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election. In September 2010, she stated that, in her opinion, the fragments of the skull found in July 2009 had nothing to do with her son.

On 3 December 2009, Pukach&#x27;s detention was extended by two months. On 6 December 2009, Mykola Melnychenko accused Volodymyr Lytvyn of ordering the murder of Gongadze in 2000, but offered no proof to back up the claim. A spokesperson for Lytvyn dismissed the claims as part of his presidential election campaign.

The Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office of Ukraine plans to complete its investigation into the case of Oleksiy Pukach by the end of the summer of 2010.

Ukrainian Prosecutor General Oleksandr Medvedko stated on 17 June 2010 that skull fragments found near Bila Tserkva in July 2009 were those of Gongadze.

On 14 September 2010, Ukraine&#x27;s Office of the Prosecutor General issued a statement stating that prosecutors had concluded that former Interior Minister Yuriy Kravchenko had ordered Pukach to carry out the murder, and stating that Pukach had confessed to the murder. According to Gongadze&#x27;s widow, Myroslava Gongadze, &quot;Kravchenko had had no grounds for such actions&quot;; she believed that several people ordered the killing of the journalist. According to Georgiy Gongadze&#x27;s mother, Olesya, the statement was an attempt by the Prosecutor-General&#x27;s office to excuse itself for its inactivity. On 16 September 2010, Lytvyn asserted that the investigation into the murder of Gongadze confirmed his innocence in this crime.

Pukach&#x27;s trial, on allegations he strangled and beheaded Gongadze, began on 7 July 2011. It was closed to the public. On 30 August 2011, Pukach claimed that Kuchma was the one who ordered the murder. During the trial he also alleged that Lytvyn ordered the murder of Gongadze.

In December 2011, the Pechersk District Court refused to accept witness testimony of Mykola Melnychenko as he had not been authorised to gather evidence of a crime, while conducting recordings in a cabinet of the President of Ukraine.

On 29 January 2013, Pukach was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Pechersk District Court of Kyiv. Oleksiy Pukach also was stripped of his rank &quot;General of Militsiya&quot;. The court ruled Pukach had murdered the journalist on orders from Kravchenko, who was seeking a career promotion.

On 9 July 2014, Myroslava Gongadze withdrew her appeal against the sentence of Pukach, as, according to her lawyer Valentyna Telychenko, &quot;If the Court of Appeals will meet our appeal, it will be forced to simultaneously release Pukach from custody. We believe that Pukach is a killer and should serve his sentence&quot;. Telychenko blamed former First Deputy Prosecutor-General Renat Kuzmin for &quot;speculating with the Gongadze case&quot; that according to her led to &quot;exhausting Pukach&#x27;s length of stay in detention during the preliminary investigation&quot;.

===Charges against Leonid Kuchma===
The Prosecutor-General&#x27;s Office cancelled its resolution to deny opening of criminal cases against former President Leonid Kuchma and other politicians within the Gongadze case on 9 October 2010.

On 24 March 2011 Ukrainian prosecutors charged Kuchma with involvement in the murder. The decision prompted mixed reaction among the public. Former Prime Minister and the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko argued that Kuchma&#x27;s arrest was no more than a PR stunt designed to distract people from their economic woes and prop up President Viktor Yanukovych&#x27;s sagging popularity. Another theory was that Yanukovych was driven by the desire for revenge on Kuchma, who often humiliated Yanukovych and refused to use force to stop the Orange Revolution in 2004. Political analysts suggested that Yanukovych&#x27;s &quot;display of justice&quot; could also be aimed at winning credit from the West, which had criticised him for authoritarian measures.

A Ukrainian district court ordered prosecutors to drop criminal charges against Kuchma on 14 December 2011 on grounds that evidence linking him to the murder of Gongadze was insufficient. The court rejected Melnychenko&#x27;s recordings as evidence. Myroslava Gongadze appealed against this decision one week later.

First Deputy Prosecutor-General Renat Kuzmin claimed 20 February 2013 that his office had collected enough evidence confirming Kuchma&#x27;s responsibility for ordering Gongadze&#x27;s assassination. Kuchma&#x27;s reply the next day was, &quot;This is another banal example of a provocation, which I&#x27;ve heard more than enough in the past 12 years&quot;.

===2014 proposal to revisit===
On 9 July 2014, Prosecutor-General Vitaliy Yarema stated that his office would revisit investigations into high-profile cases &quot;that were dropped unlawfully&quot;, including the cases dealing with the murder of Gongadze.

==Legacy==
Gongadze was buried in the Mykola Naberezhny Church in Kyiv on 22 March 2016. Gongadze had remained unburied until then, as Olesya Gongadze, the journalist&#x27;s mother, refused to have the body interred until Gongadze&#x27;s head had been found. In 2009, according to the Prosecutor-General&#x27;s office, the remains of his skull had been found, but Olesya Gongadze refused to acknowledge that the found remains belonged to her son. Olesya Gongadze died on 30 November 2013.

Viktor Yushchenko posthumously awarded Gongadze the title Hero of Ukraine on 23 August 2005. Gongadze&#x27;s widow Myroslava Gongadze was given the &#x27;Star of the Hero&#x27; decoration by President Petro Poroshenko on 21 March 2014.

In June 2005, Kyiv&#x27;s Industrialnaya Street was renamed Georgiy Gongadze Street. Prospekt Radianska Ukrainii in Kyiv&#x27;s Vynohradar neighbourhood was renamed Prospekt Georgiy Gongadze in 2007. A monument to Gongadze and all journalists killed for their professional activities was opened in Kyiv park at Chervonoarmiyska Street in August 2008, though Gongadze&#x27;s mother was against erecting a monument until the investigation is completed. She repeated her wish &quot;to remove the monument to Gongadze&quot; after a meeting with Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych on 22 June 2010, and also added her discontent with &quot;political forces holding PR campaigns&quot; regarding the Gongadze murder case.

A literary token of respect for the work and courage of Gongadze is to be found in the novel for young adults, &quot;Fair Game: The Steps of Odessa&quot; (Spire Publishing, 2008, ) by James Watson. The book is dedicated to Giya Gongadze, and the theme of a persecuted journalist and the impact of his revelations about government corruption on his children has strong similarities to Gongadze&#x27;s own fate.

In Kyiv and Lviv, ceremonies marking the disappearance of Gongadze were held on 16 September 2010 (ten years after his disappearance).

<text>Beat juggling is a deejaying and turntablism technique in which two records are used to prolong an existing beat, or to create a new one. It is associated with the context of hip hop, but not necessarily limited to this genre.

==Definition==
Beat juggling can be defined as the art of manipulating two or more samples (e.g. drum beats, or vocal phrases), in order to create a unique composition, using multiple turntables and one or more mixers. This can involve pauses, scratching, backspins and delays. It could be seen as fingertip sampling, and the turntable and mixer combination could be seen as an instrument from which sounds are made, from the sounds of other instruments (samples). 

Despite being a classical technique in deejaying and turntablism, beat juggling isn&#x27;t limited to analogue mixing with vinyl records. It can also be achieved by digital means using Compact Disc DJ players or DJ controllers.

==History==
Beat juggling has its roots in cutting, in which a small section of a beat is looped using two copies of the same record. DJ Steve Dee as one of the earliest innovators in the mid-1980s. The technique gained widespread popularity beginning in 1990.

<doc id="743410" wikidata="Q412256" url="?curid=743410" title="Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor">
<text>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, or nAChRs, are receptor polypeptides that respond to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Nicotinic receptors also respond to drugs such as the agonist nicotine. They are found in the central and peripheral nervous system, muscle, and many other tissues of many organisms. At the neuromuscular junction they are the primary receptor in muscle for motor nerve-muscle communication that controls muscle contraction. In the peripheral nervous system: (1) they transmit outgoing signals from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cells within the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, and (2) they are the receptors found on skeletal muscle that receive acetylcholine released to signal for muscular contraction. In the immune system, nAChRs regulate inflammatory processes and signal through distinct intracellular pathways. In insects, the cholinergic system is limited to the central nervous system.

The nicotinic receptors are considered cholinergic receptors, since they respond to acetylcholine. Nicotinic receptors get their name from nicotine which does not stimulate the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors but selectively binds to the nicotinic receptors instead. The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor likewise gets its name from a chemical that selectively attaches to that receptor—muscarine. Acetylcholine itself binds to both muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

As ionotropic receptors, nAChRs are directly linked to ion channels. Some evidence suggests that these receptors can also use second messengers (as metabotropic receptors do) in some cases. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are the best-studied of the ionotropic receptors.

Since nicotinic receptors help transmit outgoing signals for the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, nicotinic receptor antagonists such as hexamethonium interfere with the transmission of these signals. Thus, for example, nicotinic receptor antagonists interfere with the baroreflex that normally corrects changes in blood pressure by sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation of the heart.

== Structure ==

Nicotinic receptors, with a molecular mass of 290 kDa, are made up of five subunits, arranged symmetrically around a central pore. Each subunit comprises four transmembrane domains with both the N- and C-terminus located extracellularly. They possess similarities with GABAA receptors, glycine receptors, and the type 3 serotonin receptors (which are all ionotropic receptors), or the signature Cys-loop proteins.

In vertebrates, nicotinic receptors are broadly classified into two subtypes based on their primary sites of expression: &quot;muscle-type&quot; nicotinic receptors and &quot;neuronal-type&quot; nicotinic receptors. In the muscle-type receptors, found at the neuromuscular junction, receptors are either the embryonic form, composed of α1, β1, γ, and δ subunits in a 2:1:1:1 ratio ((α1)2β1γδ), or the adult form composed of α1, β1, δ, and ε subunits in a 2:1:1:1 ratio ((α1)2β1δε). The neuronal subtypes are various homomeric (all one type of subunit) or heteromeric (at least one α and one β) combinations of twelve different nicotinic receptor subunits: α2−α10 and β2−β4. Examples of the neuronal subtypes include: (α4)3(β2)2, (α4)2(β2)3, (α3)2(β4)3, α4α6β3(β2)2, (α7)5, and many others. In both muscle-type and neuronal-type receptors, the subunits are very similar to one another, especially in the hydrophobic regions.

A number of electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography studies have provided very high resolution structural information for muscle and neuronal nAChRs and their binding domains.

==Binding==
As with all ligand-gated ion channels, opening of the nAChR channel pore requires the binding of a chemical messenger. Several different terms are used to refer to the molecules that bind receptors, such as ligand, agonist, or transmitter. As well as the endogenous agonist acetylcholine, agonists of the nAChR include nicotine, epibatidine, and choline. Nicotinic antagonists that block the receptor include mecamylamine, dihydro-β-erythroidine, and hexamethonium.

In muscle-type nAChRs, the acetylcholine binding sites are located at the α and either ε or δ subunits interface. In neuronal nAChRs, the binding site is located at the interface of an α and a β subunit or between two α subunits in the case of α7 receptors. The binding site is located in the extracellular domain near the N terminus. When an agonist binds to the site, all present subunits undergo a conformational change and the channel is opened and a pore with a diameter of about 0.65 nm opens.

==Channel opening==
Nicotinic AChRs may exist in different interconvertible conformational states. Binding of an agonist stabilizes the open and desensitized states. In normal physiological conditions, the receptor needs exactly two molecules of ACh to open. Opening of the channel allows positively charged ions to move across it; in particular, sodium enters the cell and potassium exits. The net flow of positively charged ions is inward.

The nAChR is a non-selective cation channel, meaning that several different positively charged ions can cross through. It is permeable to Na+ and K+, with some subunit combinations that are also permeable to Ca2+. The amount of sodium and potassium the channels allow through their pores (their conductance) varies from 50 to 110 pS, with the conductance depending on the specific subunit composition as well as the permeant ion.

Many neuronal nAChRs can affect the release of other neurotransmitters. The channel usually opens rapidly and tends to remain open until the agonist diffuses away, which usually takes about 1 millisecond. AChRs can spontaneously open with no ligands bound or can spontaneously close with ligands bound, and mutations in the channel can shift the likelihood of either event. Therefore, ACh binding changes the probability of pore opening, which increases as more ACh binds.

The nAChR is unable to bind ACh when bound to any of the snake venom α-neurotoxins. These α-neurotoxins antagonistically bind tightly and noncovalently to nAChRs of skeletal muscles and in neurons, thereby blocking the action of ACh at the postsynaptic membrane, inhibiting ion flow and leading to paralysis and death. The nAChR contains two binding sites for snake venom neurotoxins. Progress in discovering the dynamics of binding action of these sites has proved difficult, although recent studies using normal mode dynamics have aided in predicting the nature of both the binding mechanisms of snake toxins and of ACh to nAChRs. These studies have shown that a twist-like motion caused by ACh binding is likely responsible for pore opening, and that one or two molecules of α-bungarotoxin (or other long-chain α-neurotoxin) suffice to halt this motion. The toxins seem to lock together neighboring receptor subunits, inhibiting the twist and therefore, the opening motion.

==Effects==
The activation of receptors by nicotine modifies the state of neurons through two main mechanisms. On one hand, the movement of cations causes a depolarization of the plasma membrane (which results in an excitatory postsynaptic potential in neurons) leading to the activation of voltage-gated ion channels. On the other hand, the entry of calcium acts, either directly or indirectly, on different intracellular cascades. This leads, for example, to the regulation of activity of some genes or the release of neurotransmitters.

==Regulation==

===Desensitization===

Ligand-bound desensitization of receptors was first characterized by Katz and Thesleff in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.

Prolonged or repeated exposure to a stimulus often results in decreased responsiveness of that receptor toward a stimulus, termed desensitization. nAChR function can be modulated by phosphorylation by the activation of second messenger-dependent protein kinases. PKA and PKC, as well as tyrosine kinases, have been shown to phosphorylate the nAChR resulting in its desensitization. It has been reported that, after prolonged receptor exposure to the agonist, the agonist itself causes an agonist-induced conformational change in the receptor, resulting in receptor desensitization.

Desensitized receptors can revert to a prolonged open state when an agonist is bound in the presence of a positive allosteric modulator, for example PNU-120,596. Also, there is evidence that indicates specific chaperone molecules have regulatory effects on these receptors.

==Roles==
The subunits of the nicotinic receptors belong to a multigene family (16 members in humans) and the assembly of combinations of subunits results in a large number of different receptors (for more information see the Ligand-Gated Ion Channel database). These receptors, with highly variable kinetic, electrophysiological and pharmacological properties, respond to nicotine differently, at very different effective concentrations. This functional diversity allows them to take part in two major types of neurotransmission. Classical synaptic transmission (wiring transmission) involves the release of high concentrations of neurotransmitter, acting on immediately neighboring receptors. In contrast, paracrine transmission (volume transmission) involves neurotransmitters released by axon terminals, which then diffuse through the extra-cellular medium until they reach their receptors, which may be distant. Nicotinic receptors can also be found in different synaptic locations; for example the muscle nicotinic receptor always functions post-synaptically. The neuronal forms of the receptor can be found both post-synaptically (involved in classical neurotransmission) and pre-synaptically where they can influence the release of multiple neurotransmitters.

==Subunits==
17 vertebrate nAChR subunits have been identified, which are divided into muscle-type and neuronal-type subunits. Although an α8 subunit/gene is present in avian species such as the chicken, it is not present in human or mammalian species.

The nAChR subunits have been divided into four subfamilies (I–IV) based on similarities in protein sequence. In addition, subfamily III has been further divided into three types.

* α genes: (muscle), (neuronal), , , , , , , , 
* β genes: (muscle), (neuronal), , 
* Other genes: (delta), (epsilon), (gamma)

Neuronal nAChRs are transmembrane proteins that form pentameric structures assembled from a family of subunits composed of α2–α10 and β2–β4. These subunits were discovered from the mid-1980s through the early 1990s, when cDNAs for multiple nAChR subunits were cloned from rat and chicken brains, leading to the identification of eleven different genes (twelve in chickens) that code for neuronal nAChR subunits; The subunit genes identified were named α2–α10 (α8 only found in chickens) and β2–β4. It has also been discovered that various subunit combinations could form functional nAChRs that could be activated by acetylcholine and nicotine, and the different combinations of subunits generate subtypes of nAChRs with diverse functional and pharmacological properties. When expressed alone, α7, α8, α9, and α10 are able to form functional receptors, but other α subunits require the presence of β subunits to form functional receptors. In mammals, nAchR subunits have been found to be encoded by 17 genes, and of these, nine genes encoding α-subunits and three encoding β-subunits are expressed in the brain. β2 subunit-containing nAChRs (β2nAChRs) and α7nAChRs are widely expressed in the brain, whereas other nAChR subunits have more restricted expression. The pentameric assembly of nAChRs is subjected to the subunits that are produced in various cell types such as in the human lung where epithelial and muscular pentamers largely differ.

===CHRNA5/A3/B4===
An important nAchR gene cluster (CHRNA5/A3/B4) contains the genes encoding for the α5, α3 and β4 subunits. Genetic studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the chromosomal locus encoding these three nAChR genes as risk factors for nicotine dependence, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alcoholism, and peripheral arterial disease. The CHRNA5/A3/B4 nAChR subunit genes are found in a tight cluster in chromosomal region 15q24–25. The nAChR subunits encoded by this locus form the predominant nicotinic receptor subtypes expressed in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and other key central nervous system (CNS) sites, such as the medial habenula, a structure between the limbic forebrain and midbrain involved in major cholinergic circuitry pathways. Further research of the CHRNA5/A3/B4 genes have revealed that &quot;neuronal&quot; nAChR genes are also expressed in non-neuronal cells where they are involved in various fundamental processes, such as inflammation. The CHRNA5/A3/B4 genes are co-expressed in many cell types and the transcriptional activities of the promoter regions of the three genes are regulated by many of the same transcription factors, demonstrating that their clustering may reflect control of gene expression.

===CHRNA6/CHRNB3===
CHRNB3 and CHRNA6 are also grouped in a gene cluster, located on 8p11. Multiple studies have shown that SNPS in the CHRNB3–CHRNA6 have been linked to nicotine dependence and smoking behavior, such as two SNPs in CHRNB3, rs6474413 and rs10958726. Genetic variation in this region also displays influence susceptibility to use drugs of abuse, including cocaine and alcohol consumption. Nicotinic receptors containing α6 or β3 subunits expressed in brain regions, especially in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, are important for drug behaviors due to their role in dopamine release. Genetic variation in these genes can alter sensitivity to drugs of abuse in numerous ways, including changing the amino acid structure of the protein or cause alterations in transcriptional and translational regulation.

===CHRNA4/CHRNB2===
Other well studied nAChR genes include the CHRNA4 and CHRNB2, which have been associated as Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy (ADNFLE) genes. Both of these nAChR subunits are present in the brain and the occurrence of mutations in these two subunits cause a focal type of epilepsy. Examples include the CHRNA4 insertion mutation 776ins3 that is associated with nocturnal seizures and psychiatric disorders, and the CHRNB2 mutation I312M that seems to cause not only epilepsy but also very specific cognitive deficits, such as deficits in learning and memory. There is naturally occurring genetic variation between these two genes and analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other gene modifications show a higher variation in the CHRNA4 gene than in the CHRNB2 gene, implying that nAChR β2, the protein encoded by CHRNB2, associates with more subunits than α4. CHRNA2 has also been reported as a third candidate for nocturnal frontal lobe seizures.

===CHRNA7===
Several studies have reported an association between CHRNA7 and endophenotypes of psychiatric disorders and nicotine dependence, contributing to the significant clinical relevance of α7 and research being done on it. CHRNA7 was one of the first genes that had been considered to be involved with schizophrenia. Studies identified several CHRNA7 promoter polymorphisms that reduce the genes transcriptional activity to be associated with schizophrenia, which is consistent with the finding of reduced levels of a7 nAChRs in the brain of schizophrenic patients. Both nAChRs subtypes, α4β2 and α7, have been found to be significantly reduced in post-mortem studies of individuals with schizophrenia. Additionally, smoking rates are significantly higher in those with schizophrenia, implying that smoking nicotine may be a form of self-medicating.

===Notable variations===
Nicotinic receptors are pentamers of these subunits; i.e., each receptor contains five subunits. Thus, there is immense potential of variation of these subunits, some of which are more commonly found than others. The most broadly expressed subtypes include (α1)2β1δε (adult muscle-type), (α3)2(β4)3 (ganglion-type), (α4)2(β2)3 (CNS-type) and (α7)5 (another CNS-type). A comparison follows:

<text>Public Interest Watch (PIW) was established in September 2002 by Mike Hardiman. The PIW website states that the group was created &quot;in response to the growing misuse of charitable funds by nonprofit organizations and the lack of effort by government agencies to deal with the problem.&quot; In March 2006 the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that PIW received approximately 95% of its funding from ExxonMobil during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004.

==History==

PIW claims that it &quot;works to fight charitable trust abuse by exposing individual cases of abuse and advocating for stronger governmental oversight, including requirements for greater financial disclosure by charitable organizations&quot;.

In comments to the IRS on possible changes to information required to be disclosed on Form 990 for non-profit groups, PIW flagged some changes it wanted. US citizens, taxpayers and shareholders &quot;are entitled to know as much about the tax-exempt entities to which the federal government provides tax subsidies, contracts or access to policy debates as they do about publicly traded corporations,&quot; they wrote. Key changes they sought to achieve this included:
*requiring non-profits to submit with their annual return copies of all fundraising materials as a way of potentially facilitating early legal actions - such as for misleading promotion, libel, trade libel or &quot;tortious interference&quot;
*provide a list of individual financial contributors and the total annual contributions
*disclose grants to overseas organizations or individuals
*publish decision making processes
*file quarterly financial returns

PIW&#x27;s proposals echo the views advanced by Gary Johns from the Australian corporate think-tank, the Institute of Public Affairs at an American Enterprise Institute seminar. In particular, PIW proposed tax-exempt organizations disclose the &quot;(i) the nature and extent of its claims to expertise, other than membership interest; (ii) the qualifications of those who will speak or act on behalf of the organization; (iii) the research undertaken by the tax-exempt organization; and (iv) whether the research has been assessed by independent peer review.&quot;

In September 2003 PIW complained to the Internal Revenue Service claiming that Greenpeace tax returns were inaccurate and breached the law. PIW asked the IRS to investigate the complaint.

In a column filed with the Copley News Service Doug Bandow, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and James Madison Scholar with the American Legislative Exchange Council, while conceding the Greenpeace had a right to advocate its beliefs, railed against non-profit groups having a tax-deductible 501c(3) entity that can transfer funds to a non-deductible 501 c (4) entity. &quot;What they shouldn&#x27;t be able to do is manipulate the tax system to advance their agenda,&quot; Bandow complained. Bandow endorsed PIW&#x27;s claim that foundations that provided grants should verify how funds were spent.

PIW’s attack on Greenpeace was also taken up by Californian Republican Assemblyman Ray Haynes, who urged that State Attorney-General Lockyer prosecute Greenpeace under various laws, including the state&#x27;s unfair-business-practice law.

The Public Interest Watch report was also covered by Marc Levin, a lawyer and president of the American Freedom Center. After reviewing a number of incidents of damage to property attributed to the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front, Levin sought to equate Greenpeace with ecoterrorism. &quot;While these acts of ecoterror are clearly illegal, few people realize that the money used to commit many of these crimes may have been illegally laundered through tax-exempt organizations whose donors - individuals and nonprofit foundations unaware of the laundering - receive tax deductions,&quot; he wrote in the &quot;New Jersey Law Journal&quot;.

In May 2004 under interim Executive Director Lewis Fein, PIW were targeting Greenpeace once more claiming that they had found what they claimed was the &quot;secret&quot; location of the Greenpeace actions warehouse in Washington, D.C. The media release was picked up by the &quot;Washington Times&quot;.

In a letter to the editor in the &quot;Washington Times&quot;, Greenpeace&#x27;s operations manager, Bill Richardson, ridiculed PIW&#x27;s claim that the warehouse location was secret. &quot;What extraordinary detective skills it must have taken to notice the mailbox with the name &quot;Greenpeace&quot; on the front of the building. Thanks for the giggle,&quot; he wrote.

== Funding ==

In a January 2003 letter to the IRS – as well as on its website – PIW states that it &quot;has been established as a 501(c)4 nonprofit organization, which means contributions to PIW are not tax-deductible.&quot; Asked whether PIW had filed an annual return with the IRS since the organisation was formed Fein said &quot;I believe so&quot;.

On its website PIW states that &quot;initial funding for PIW has been provided by business organizations&quot;. 

(For more details on the Internal Revenue Service provisions for non-profits groups - including on the 501c(3) and 501c(4) provisions see The U.S. tax code and non profits).

==Personnel ==
*Lewis Fein, Executive Director (interim)
*Jim McCarthy, Board member
*Michael Hardiman, founding Executive Director. Resigned from PIW in January 2004 to work in Iraq as a civilian employee of the Defense Department.

In an interview, Fein said he was unable to disclose who the members of the board of directors were. &quot;With media inquiries when I have been called to discuss the board or the individual members themselves, many are with very well established biographies, I just need to clear it with them,&quot; he said.

Nor could Fein comment on whether the street address listed on their website was in fact a residential address and not an office at all. &quot;It is just standard policy that I have to apply. I’m not trying to be evasive or not answer your question. It&#x27;s just that if the board say its OK to answer these questions then I can get back to you with the information,&quot; he said. To date there has been no further information forthcoming by email.

<text>Goddard Lieberson (April 5, 1911 – May 29, 1977) was the president of Columbia Records from 1956 to 1971, and again from 1973 to 1975. He became president of the Recording Industry Association of America in 1964. He was also a composer, and studied with George Frederick McKay, at the University of Washington, Seattle. He married Vera Zorina in 1946 and with her had 2 children.

==Biography==
Lieberson was born to a Jewish family on April 5, 1911, in Hanley in Staffordshire; his father was a manufacturer of rubber shoe heels who took his family to the United States when Lieberson was a child. He studied classical piano and composition at the Eastman School of Music in the 1930s and after graduating he wrote classical concert reviews under the pseudonym &quot;Johann Sebastian&quot;. He was married to actress/dancer Vera Zorina from 1946 until his death in 1977. They had two sons: Peter Lieberson, a composer, and Jonathan Lieberson. Lieberson was noted for his personal elegance, taste and style, and was renowned as a wit, &quot;bon vivant&quot; and international traveller, whose circle of friends and acquaintances included Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Richard Rodgers, W. Somerset Maugham, Noël Coward and John Gielgud.

Lieberson began working for the CBS group of labels in 1938 – the same year the company was acquired by the CBS broadcasting empire – and he began his career at Columbia as an A&amp;R Manager. Before becoming president of the company, Lieberson was responsible for Columbia&#x27;s introduction of the long-playing record. The LP was particularly well-suited to Columbia&#x27;s long-established classical repertoire, as recorded by the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Artur Rodziński, Dimitri Mitropoulos, and Leonard Bernstein. Lieberson was also a lifelong friend of musician, recording artist, TV personality and Columbia A&amp;R manager/producer Mitch Miller, having met Miller when the two were studying music at the Eastman School of Music in the 1930s

He was promoted to president of Columbia Records from 1956 to 1971 and again from 1973 to 1975. In 1966, in a reorganization, Columbia Records became subsidiary to the newly formed CBS/Columbia Group. In 1967, Lieberson promoted Clive Davis to president of Columbia Records.

In 1977, Lieberson co-wrote and produced the CBS-TV special &quot;They Said it with Music: From Yankee Doodle to Ragtime&quot;, a salute to American songwriters throughout the ages, starring Bernadette Peters, Tony Randall, Jason Robards, Jean Stapleton and Flip Wilson, with appearances by Thurl Ravenscroft and Jimmy Griffin, a founding member of the soft-rock band Bread. The show aired July 4, thirty-seven days after Lieberson died of cancer in New York City on May 29, 1977, aged 66.

<text>Cryptococcosis is a potentially fatal fungal infection of mainly the lungs, presenting as a pneumonia, and in the brain, where it appears as a meningitis. Coughing, difficulty breathing, chest pain and fever are seen when the lungs are infected. When the brain is infected, symptoms include headache, fever, neck pain, nausea and vomiting, light sensitivity and confusion or changes in behavior. It can also affect other parts of the body including skin, where it may appear as several fluid-filled nodules with dead tissue.
It is caused by the fungi &quot;Cryptococcus neoformans&quot; or less commonly &quot;Cryptococcus gattii&quot;, and is acquired by breathing in the spores from the air. These fungi are found globally in soil, decaying wood, pigeon droppings, and in the hollows of some species of trees. Whereas &quot;C. neoformans&quot; generally infects people with HIV/AIDS and those on immunosuppressant drugs and does not usually affect fit and healthy people, &quot;C. gattii&quot; (found in some parts of Canada and the US) does. Once breathed in, the dried yeast cells colonize the lungs, where they are either cleared by immune cells, lie dormant, or cause infection and spread.
Diagnosis is by isolating &quot;Cryptococcus&quot; from a sample of affected tissue or direct observation of the fungus by using staining of body fluids. It can be cultured from a cerebrospinal fluid, sputum, and skin biopsy. Characteristic neuroimaging findings include dilated Virchow-Robin spaces, the ‘dirty CSF sign’, hydrocephalus, cryptococcomas and hazy brain base sign. Many of these findings are non-specific, but the presence of basal meningeal enhancement is significant as it is associated with the future development of cerebral infarct. Treatment is with fluconazole or amphotericin B.
Data from 2009 estimated that of the almost one million cases of cryptococcal meningitis that occurred worldwide annually, 700,000 occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and 600,000 per year died. Cryptococcosis was rare before the 1970s which saw an increase in at-risk groups such as people with organ transplant or on immunosuppressant medications. The number of cases escalated in the mid-1980s with over 80% occurring in people with HIV/AIDS. Pigeon breeders (or otherwise people who spend significant time with pigeons) are known to have a high incidence of cryptococcal infections including primary cutaneous cryptococcus due to the fungi&#x27;s association with pigeon droppings.

== Classification ==
Cryptococcus is generally classified according to how it is acquired and the site of infection. It typically begins in the lungs before spreading to other parts of the body, particularly the brain and nervous system. Skin involvement is less common.

==Signs and symptoms==
Cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, and fever are seen when the lungs are infected, appearing like a pneumonia. There may also be feeling of tiredness. When the brain is infected, symptoms include headache, fever, neck pain, nausea and vomiting, light sensitivity, confusion, or changes in behaviour. It can also affect other parts of the body including skin, eyes, bones, and prostate. In the skin, it may appear as several fluid-filled nodules with dead tissue. Depending on the site of infection, other features may include loss of vision, blurred vision, inability to move an eye, and memory loss.

Symptom onset is often sudden when lungs are infected and gradual over several weeks when the central nervous system is affected.

Signs and symptoms of cryptococcal infection may be delayed in those with HIV or AIDS. A positive cryptococcal antigen test may precede symptoms by 3 weeks in those with HIV/AIDS. Others may have re-activation of latent cryptococcal disease years later. In those with HIV, approximately 50% of people have a fever, but fever is rare in previously healthy and immunocompetent people with cryptococcosis.

== Cause ==
Cryptococcosis is a common opportunistic infection for AIDS and is particularly common among people living with AIDS in Africa. Other conditions that pose an increased risk include certain malignancies (such as lymphoma), liver cirrhosis, organ transplants, and long-term corticosteroid therapy.

Distribution is worldwide in soil. The prevalence of cryptococcosis has been increasing over the past 50 years for many reasons, including the increase in incidence of AIDS and the expanded use of immunosuppressive drugs.

In humans, &quot;C. neoformans&quot; chiefly infects the skin, lungs, and central nervous system (causing meningitis). Less commonly it may affect other organs such as the eye or prostate.

== Primary cutaneous cryptococcosis ==
Primary cutaneous cryptococcosis (PCC) is a distinct clinical diagnosis separate from the secondary cutaneous cryptococcosis that is spread by systematic infection. Males are more likely to develop the infection and a 2020 study showed that the sex bias may be due to a growth hormone, produced by &quot;C. neoformans&quot; called gibberellic acid (GA) that is upregulated by testosterone. The upper limbs account for a majority of infections. Isolates found in PCC include &quot;Cryptococcus neoformans&quot; (most common), &quot;Cryptococcus gattii&quot;, and &quot;Cryptococcus laurentii&quot;. The prognosis for PCC is generally good outside of disseminated infection.

Morphologic description of the lesions shows umbilicated papules, nodules, and violaceous plaques that can mimic other cutaneous diseases like molluscum contagiosum and Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma. These lesions may be present months before other signs of system infection in patients with AIDS.

== Pulmonary cryptococcosis ==
&quot;Cryptococcus&quot; (both &quot;C. neoformans&quot; and &quot;C. gattii&quot;) plays a common role in pulmonary invasive mycosis seen in adults with HIV and other immunocompromised conditions. It also affects healthy adults at a much lower frequency and severity as healthy hosts may have no or mild symptoms. Immune-competent hosts may not seek or require treatment, but careful observation may be important. Cryptococcal pneumonia has the potential to disseminate to the central nervous system (CNS), especially in immunocompromised individuals.

Pulmonary cryptococcosis has a worldwide distribution and is commonly underdiagnosed due to limitations in diagnostic capabilities. Since pulmonary nodules are its most common radiological feature, they can clinically and radiologically mimic lung cancer, TB, and other pulmonary mycoses. The sensitivity of cultures and the Cryptococcal (CrAg) antigen with lateral flow device on serum are rarely positive in the absence of disseminated disease. Moreover, pulmonary cryptococcosis worsens the prognosis of cryptococcal meningitis.

== Cryptococcal meningitis ==
Cryptococcal meningitis (infection of the meninges, the tissue covering the brain) is believed to result from the dissemination of the fungus from either an observed or undetected pulmonary infection. Often there is also silent dissemination throughout the brain when meningitis is present. People with defects in their cell-mediated immunity, for example, people with AIDS, are especially susceptible to disseminated cryptococcosis. Cryptococcosis is often fatal, even if treated. It is estimated that the three-month case-fatality rate is 9% in high-income regions, 55% in low/middle-income regions, and 70% in sub-Saharan Africa. As of 2009 there were globally approximately 958,000 annual cases and 625,000 deaths within three months after infection.

Although &quot;C. neoformans&quot; infection most commonly occurs as an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised people (such as those living with AIDS), &quot;C. gattii&quot; often infects immunocompetent people as well.

&quot;Cryptococcus&quot; species (both &quot;C. neoformans&quot; and &quot;C. gattii&quot;) are responsible for 68% of meningitis cases in those with HIV. Cryptococcus is considered an &quot;emerging&quot; disease in healthy adults. Though the rate of infection is clearly higher with immunocompromised individuals, some studies suggest a higher mortality rate in patients with non-HIV cryptococcal meningitis secondary to the role of T-cell mediated reaction and injury. CD4+ T cells have proven roles in the defense against &quot;Cryptococcus&quot;, but it can also contribute to clinical deterioration due its inflammatory response.

== Diagnosis ==
Symptom onset is often subacute, progressively worsened over several weeks, and delays in diagnosis are associated with increased mortality.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood antigen testing by lateral flow assay for cryptococcal antigens has a sensitivity and specificity greater than 99% for cryptococcosis. A CSF fungal culture can tell if there is a microbiological failure (failure of the fungal infections to treat the infection). CSF fungal culture has a 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity for the diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis. CSF cell analysis is characterized by increased lymphocytes, reduced protein, and reduced glucose. For any person who has cryptococcosis at a site outside of the central nervous system (e.g., pulmonary cryptococcosis), a lumbar puncture is indicated to evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for evidence of cryptococcal meningitis, even if they do not have signs or symptoms of CNS disease. Detection of cryptococcal antigen (capsular material) by culture of CSF, sputum and urine provides definitive diagnosis. Blood cultures may be positive in heavy infections. India ink of the CSF is a traditional microscopic method of diagnosis, although the sensitivity is poor in early infection, and may miss 15–20% of patients with culture-positive cryptococcal meningitis. Rapid diagnostic methods to detect cryptococcal antigen include latex agglutination testing, lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFA), or enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used on tissue specimens, with PCR having a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 98% for cryptococcal infection.

== Prevention ==
Cryptococcosis is a very subacute infection with a prolonged subclinical phase lasting weeks to months in persons with HIV/AIDS before the onset of symptomatic meningitis. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence rate of detectable cryptococcal antigen in peripheral blood is often 4–12% in persons with CD4 counts lower than 100 cells/mcL.
Cryptococcal antigen screen and preemptive treatment with fluconazole is cost-saving to the healthcare system by avoiding cryptococcal meningitis. The World Health Organization recommends cryptococcal antigen screening in HIV-infected persons entering care with CD4&lt;100 cells/μL. This undetected subclinical cryptococcal (if not preemptively treated with anti-fungal therapy) will often go on to develop cryptococcal meningitis, despite receiving HIV therapy. Cryptococcosis accounts for 20–25% of the mortality after initiating HIV therapy in Africa. What is effective preemptive treatment is unknown, with the current recommendations on dose and duration based on expert opinion. Screening in the United States is controversial, with official guidelines not recommending screening, despite cost-effectiveness and a 3% U.S. cryptococcal antigen prevalence in CD4&lt;100 cells/μL.

Antifungal prophylaxis such as fluconazole and itraconazole reduces the risk of contracting cryptococcosis in those with low CD4 cell count and high risk of developing such disease in a setting of cryptococcal antigen screening tests are not available.

== Treatment ==
Treatment options in persons without HIV infection have not been well studied. Intravenous Amphotericin B combined with flucytosine by mouth is recommended for initial treatment (induction therapy).

People living with AIDS often have a greater burden of disease and higher mortality (30–70% at 10 weeks), recommended therapy is with amphotericin B and flucytosine. Adding flucytosine to amphotericin B is associated with earlier fungal clearance and increased survival, however, it is not readily available in many lower-income regions. Where flucytosine is not available, fluconazole should be used with amphotericin. Amphotericin-based induction therapy has much greater microbiologic activity than fluconazole monotherapy with 30% better survival at 10 weeks. Based on a systematic review, the most cost-effective induction treatment in resource-limited settings appears to be one week of amphotericin B coupled with high-dose fluconazole. After initial induction treatment as above, typical consolidation therapy is with oral fluconazole for at least 8 weeks used with secondary prophylaxis with fluconazole thereafter.

The decision on when to start treatment for HIV appears to be very different than other opportunistic infections. A large multi-site trial supports deferring ART for 4–6 weeks was overall preferable with 15% better 1-year survival than earlier ART initiation at 1–2 weeks after diagnosis. A 2018 Cochrane review also supports the delayed starting of treatment until cryptococcosis starts improving with antifungal treatment.

Increased intracranial pressure is seen in about 50% of those with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis and is usually associated with a high fungal burden. Regular (often daily) lumbar punctures to lower the intracranial pressure by draining CSF are associated with reduced mortality in those with cryptococcal meningitis (with or without HIV). But in those with suspicion of non-communicating hydrocephalus (which may present as focal neurologic symptoms or impaired mentation), a CT or MRI of the brain is required before lumbar puncture to rule out hydrocephalus, due to the risk of brain herniation with lumbar puncture. Non-communicating hydrocephalus is rare in those with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis.
=== IRIS ===
Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is possible in those with cryptococcal infection, especially those with concurrent HIV starting anti-retroviral therapy. With anti-retroviral therapies for HIV, the CD4+ T-cell counts recover and the restored immune system mounts an exaggerated, hyperinflammatory response against cryptococcal infection in the body.

IRIS has a 5% incidence in those with HIV and cryptococcosis starting anti-retroviral therapy. It usually occurs within 4 weeks of starting antiretroviral therapy. The risk of IRIS is increased in those with a high fungal burden, lower CD4+ T-cell count, and lower inflammatory marker levels.

==Epidemiology==
Cryptococcosis is usually associated with immunosuppressed people, such as those with AIDs, corticosteroid use, diabetes, and organ transplant. &quot;Cryptococcus&quot; comprizes two clinically relevant species, &quot;Cryptococcus neoformans&quot; and &quot;Cryptococcus gattii&quot;. &quot;C. gattii&quot; was previously thought to only be found in tropical climates and in immunocompetent persons, but recent findings of &quot;C. gattii&quot; in regions such as Canada and Western regions of North America have challenged this initial presumption of the geographic patterns.

Data from 2009 estimated that of the almost one million cases of cryptococcal meningitis that occurred worldwide annually, 700,000 occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and 600,000 per year died. In 2014, amongst people who had a low CD4+ cell count, the annual incidence rate was estimated to be 278,000 cases. Of those, 223,100 resulted in cryptococcal meningitis. About 73% of cryptococcal meningitis cases occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa. More than 180,000 fatalities are attributed to cryptococcal meningitis, 135,000 of which occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Case fatality of cryptococcal meningitis varies widely depending on what country the infection occurs. In low-income countries, the case fatality from cryptococcal meningitis is 70%. This differs from middle-income countries where the case fatality rate is 40%. In wealthy countries the case fatality is 20%. 19% of all AIDS-related deaths are due to cryptococcal disease. Cryptococcal disease is the second leading cause of death in those with HIV/AIDS, second only to tuberculosis, which is responsible for 40% of deaths. In sub-Saharan Africa approximately a third of HIV patients will develop cryptococcosis.

=== In the United States ===
In the United States, the incidence of cryptococcosis is estimated to be about 0.4-1.3 cases per 100,000 population and 2-7 cases per 100,000 in people affected with AIDS with a case fatality ratio of about 12%. Since 1990 the incidence of AIDs-associated cryptococcosis has fallen by 90% due to the proliferation of antiretroviral therapy. The estimated prevalence of cryptococcosis cases amongst HIV patients in the U.S. is 2.8%. In immunocompetent patients cryptococcus typically presents itself as &quot;Cryptococcus gattii&quot;. Despite its rarity cryptococcus has been more commonly seen, with upwards of 20% of cases in immunocompetent people. Over 50% of cryptococcosis infections in North America are caused by &quot;C. gattii.&quot; Though &quot;C. gattii&quot; was originally thought to be restricted to subtropical and tropical regions it has become more prevalent worldwide. &quot;C. gattii&quot; has been found in over 90 people in the United States, most of these cases originating in Washington or Oregon.

=== In sub-Saharan Africa ===
Sub-Saharan Africa is the main hub for HIV/AIDS worldwide. HIV/AIDS accounts for about 0.5% of the world&#x27;s population. Remarkably, sub-Saharan Africa holds 71% of HIV/AIDs cases. Cryptococcal meningitis is a primary contributor to mortality among individuals with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Approximately 160,000 cases of cryptococcal meningitis are reported in West Africa, resulting in 130,000 deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Uganda is reported to have the highest occurrence of cryptococcus meningitis. Reflecting that, Ethiopia has the least occurrence. Presently, treatment options involve either a 7 or 14-day regimen of amphotericin-B, coupled with oral antifungal tablets or oral fluconazole. It is important to note, that amphotericin-B is not considered a treatment, as it showed not a significant reduction in the mortality rate.

== Other animals ==
Cryptococcosis is also seen in cats and occasionally dogs. It is the most common deep fungal disease in cats, usually leading to chronic infection of the nose and sinuses, and skin ulcers. Cats may develop a bump over the bridge of the nose from local tissue inflammation. It can be associated with FeLV infection in cats. Cryptococcosis is most common in dogs and cats but cattle, sheep, goats, horses, wild animals, and birds can also be infected. Soil, fowl manure, and pigeon droppings are among the sources of infection.

==History==
===Ottoman Empire===
Considered as the world&#x27;s third institution of higher learning specifically dedicated to engineering education, Istanbul Technical University (ITU) has a long and distinguished history. ITU was founded in 1773 by Sultan Mustafa III, as an important institution in the Nizam-ı Cedid reforms, as the Imperial School of Naval Engineering (Ottoman Turkish: &quot;Mühendishâne-i Bahrî-i Hümâyun&quot;), in the Kasımpaşa quarter on the Golden Horn, originally dedicated to train ship builders and cartographers for the Ottoman Navy. In 1795 the Imperial School of Military Engineering () was established in the nearby Hasköy quarter on the Golden Horn, and the scope of the school was broadened to train technical military staff for the modernization of the Ottoman Army. In 1845 the engineering function of the school was further widened with the addition of a program devoted to the training of architects. The scope and name of the school were extended and changed again in 1883, and in 1909 the school became a public engineering school which was aimed at training civil engineers who could provide the infrastructure for the rapidly developing country.

===Modern Turkey===
By 1928 the institution had gained formal recognition as a university of engineering which provided education in both engineering and architecture. In 1944 the name of the institution was changed to Istanbul Technical University and in 1946 the institution became an autonomous university with architecture, civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering faculties.

With its long history of 251 years, its modern teaching environment, and well-qualified teaching staff, Istanbul Technical University today is the personification of engineering and architectural education in Turkey. Istanbul Technical University not only played a leading role in the modernization movement of the Ottoman Empire, but has also maintained its leadership position in the changes and innovations taking place in the construction, industrialization, and technological realms during the modern days of the Turkish Republic. Engineers and architects trained at Istanbul Technical University have played significant roles in the construction of Turkey. Alumni also played a significant role in Turkish politics.

==Academics==


The structure of faculties, except the Faculty of Science and Letters, at ITU is comparable to those of &quot;schools&quot; in the U.S. institutions, where each faculty is composed of two or more departments in line with a comprehensive engineering field. For example, the Faculty of Electrical and Electronics Engineering consists of the departments of electrical engineering, robotics and autonomous systems engineering, electronics and communication engineering.

<text>Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) are acetylcholine receptors that form G protein-coupled receptor complexes in the cell membranes of certain neurons and other cells. They play several roles, including acting as the main end-receptor stimulated by acetylcholine released from postganglionic fibers. They are mainly found in the parasympathetic nervous system, but also have a role in the sympathetic nervous system in the control of sweat glands.

Muscarinic receptors are so named because they are more sensitive to muscarine than to nicotine. Their counterparts are nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), receptor ion channels that are also important in the autonomic nervous system. Many drugs and other substances (for example pilocarpine and scopolamine) manipulate these two distinct receptors by acting as selective agonists or antagonists.

== Function ==
Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter found in the brain, neuromuscular junctions and the autonomic ganglia.
Muscarinic receptors are used in the following roles:

=== Recovery receptors ===

ACh is always used as the neurotransmitter within the autonomic ganglion. Nicotinic receptors on the postganglionic neuron are responsible for the initial fast depolarization (Fast EPSP) of that neuron. As a consequence of this, nicotinic receptors are often cited as &quot;the receptor on the postganglionic neurons at the ganglion&quot;. However, the subsequent hyperpolarization (IPSP) and slow depolarization (Slow EPSP) that represent the recovery of the postganglionic neuron from stimulation are actually mediated by &quot;muscarinic&quot; receptors, types M2 and M1 respectively (discussed below).

Peripheral autonomic fibers (sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers) are categorized anatomically as either preganglionic or postganglionic fibers, then further generalized as either adrenergic fibers, releasing noradrenaline, or cholinergic fibers, both releasing acetylcholine and expressing acetylcholine receptors. Both preganglionic sympathetic fibers and preganglionic parasympathetic fibers are cholinergic. Most postganglionic sympathetic fibers are adrenergic: their neurotransmitter is norepinephrine except postganglionic sympathetic fibers to the sweat glands, piloerectile muscles of the body hairs, and the skeletal muscle arterioles do not use adrenaline/noradrenaline.

The adrenal medulla is considered a sympathetic ganglion and, like other sympathetic ganglia, is supplied by cholinergic preganglionic sympathetic fibers: acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter utilized at this synapse. The chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla act as &quot;modified neurons&quot;, releasing adrenaline and noradrenaline into the bloodstream as hormones instead of as neurotransmitters. The other postganglionic fibers of the peripheral autonomic system belong to the parasympathetic division; all are cholinergic fibers, and use acetylcholine as the neurotransmitter.

===Postganglionic neurons===

Another role for these receptors is at the junction of the innervated tissues and the postganglionic neurons in the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. Here acetylcholine is again used as a neurotransmitter, and &quot;muscarinic&quot; receptors form the principal receptors on the innervated tissue.

===Innervated tissue===

Very few parts of the sympathetic system use cholinergic receptors. In sweat glands the receptors are of the &quot;muscarinic&quot; type. The sympathetic nervous system also has some preganglionic nerves terminating at the chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla, which secrete epinephrine and norepinephrine into the bloodstream. Some believe that chromaffin cells are modified postganglionic CNS fibers. In the adrenal medulla, acetylcholine is used as a neurotransmitter, and the receptor is of the &quot;nicotinic&quot; type.

The somatic nervous system uses a nicotinic receptor to acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction.

===Higher central nervous system===

Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are also present and distributed throughout the local nervous system, in post-synaptic and pre-synaptic positions. There is also some evidence for postsynaptic receptors on sympathetic neurons allowing the parasympathetic nervous system to inhibit sympathetic effects.

===Presynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction===

It is known that muscarinic acetylcholine receptors also appear on the pre-synaptic membrane of somatic neurons in the neuro-muscular junction, where they are involved in the regulation of acetylcholine release.

==Form of muscarinic receptors==
Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors belong to a class of metabotropic receptors that use G proteins as their signaling mechanism. In such receptors, the signaling molecule (the ligand) binds to a monomeric receptor that has seven transmembrane regions; in this case, the ligand is ACh. This receptor is bound to intracellular proteins, known as G proteins, which begin the information cascade within the cell.

By contrast, nicotinic receptors form pentameric complexes and use a ligand-gated ion channel mechanism for signaling. In this case, binding of the ligands with the receptor causes an ion channel to open, permitting either one or more specific types of ions (e.g., K+, Na+, Ca2+) to diffuse into or out of the cell.

==Receptor isoforms==

=== Classification ===
By the use of selective radioactively labeled agonist and antagonist substances, five subtypes of muscarinic receptors have been determined, named M1–M5 (using an upper case M and subscript number). M1, M3, M5 receptors are coupled with Gq proteins, while M2 and M4 receptors are coupled with Gi/o proteins. There are other classification systems. For example, the drug pirenzepine is a muscarinic antagonist (decreases the effect of ACh), which is much more potent at M1 receptors than it is at other subtypes. The acceptance of the various subtypes proceeded in numerical order, therefore, earlier sources may recognize only M1 and M2 subtypes, while later studies recognize M3, M4, and most recently M5 subtypes.

===Genetic differences===
Meanwhile, geneticists and molecular biologists have characterised five genes that appear to encode muscarinic receptors, named m1-m5 (lowercase m; no subscript number). They code for pharmacologic types M1-M5. The receptors m1 and m2 were determined based upon partial sequencing of M1 and M2 receptor proteins. The others were found by searching for homology, using bioinformatic techniques.

===Difference in G proteins===

G proteins contain an alpha-subunit that is critical to the functioning of receptors. These subunits can take a number of forms. There are four broad classes of form of G-protein: Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12/13. Muscarinic receptors vary in the G protein to which they are bound, with some correlation according to receptor type. G proteins are also classified according to their susceptibility to cholera toxin (CTX) and pertussis toxin (PTX, whooping cough). Gs and some subtypes of Gi (Gαt and Gαg) are susceptible to CTX. Only Gi is susceptible to PTX, with the exception of one subtype of Gi (Gαz) which is immune. Also, only when bound with an agonist, those G proteins normally sensitive to PTX also become susceptible to CTX.

The various G-protein subunits act differently upon secondary messengers, upregulating Phospholipases, downregulating cAMP, and so on.

Because of the strong correlations to muscarinic receptor type, CTX and PTX are useful experimental tools in investigating these receptors.

The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype sectivities of a large number of antimuscarinic drugs have been reviewed.

===M1 receptor===

This receptor is found mediating slow EPSP at the ganglion in the postganglionic nerve, is common in exocrine glands and in the CNS.

It is predominantly found bound to G proteins of class Gq, which use upregulation of phospholipase C and, therefore, inositol trisphosphate and intracellular calcium as a signaling pathway. A receptor so bound would not be susceptible to CTX or PTX. However, Gi (causing a downstream decrease in cAMP) and Gs (causing an increase in cAMP) have also been shown to be involved in interactions in certain tissues, and so would be susceptible to PTX and CTX, respectively.

===M2 receptor===

The M2 muscarinic receptors are located in the heart and lungs. In the heart, they act to slow the heart rate down below the normal baseline sinus rhythm, by slowing the speed of depolarization. In humans, under resting conditions, vagal activity dominates over sympathetic activity. Hence, inhibition of M2 receptors (e.g. by atropine) will cause a raise in heart rate. They also moderately reduce contractile forces of the atrial cardiac muscle, and reduce conduction velocity of the atrioventricular node (AV node). It also serves to slightly decrease the contractile forces of the ventricular muscle.

M2 muscarinic receptors act via a Gi type receptor, which causes a decrease in cAMP in the cell, inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and increasing efflux of K+, in general, leading to inhibitory-type effects.

===M3 receptor===

The M3 muscarinic receptors are located at many places in the body. They are located in the smooth muscles of the blood vessels, as well as in the lungs. Because the M3 receptor is Gq-coupled and mediates an increase in intracellular calcium, it typically causes contraction of smooth muscle, such as that observed during bronchoconstriction and bladder voiding. However, with respect to vasculature, activation of M3 on vascular endothelial cells causes increased synthesis of nitric oxide, which diffuses to adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells and causes their relaxation, thereby explaining the paradoxical effect of parasympathomimetics on vascular tone and bronchiolar tone. Indeed, direct stimulation of vascular smooth muscle, M3 mediates vasoconstriction in diseases wherein the vascular endothelium is disrupted.
The M3 receptors are also located in many glands, which help to stimulate secretion in, for example, the salivary glands, as well as other glands of the body.

Like the M1 muscarinic receptor, M3 receptors are G proteins of class Gq that upregulate phospholipase C and, therefore, inositol trisphosphate and intracellular calcium as a signaling pathway.

===M4 receptor===

M4 receptors are found in the CNS. M4 receptors are also located in erythroid progenitor cell in peripheral tissue and modulate the cAMP pathway to regulate erythroid progenitor cell differentiation. Therapies targeting the M4 receptor treats myelodysplastic syndrome and anemia that are refractory to erythropoietin.

M4 receptors work via Gi receptors to decrease cAMP in the cell and, thus, produce generally inhibitory effects. Possible bronchospasm may result if stimulated by muscarinic agonists.

===M5 receptor===

Location of M5 receptors is not well known.

Like the M1 and M3 muscarinic receptor, M5 receptors are coupled with G proteins of class Gq that upregulate phospholipase C and, therefore, inositol trisphosphate and intracellular calcium as a signaling pathway.

==Pharmacological application==
Ligands targeting the mAChR that are currently approved for clinical use include non-selective antagonists for the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, atropine (to dilate the pupil), scopolamine (used to prevent motion sickness), and ipratropium (used in the treatment of COPD).

In 2024, the United States FDA approved the drug KarXT (Cobenfy), which is a combination drug that combines xanomeline (a preferentially acting M1/M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist) with trospium (a peripherally-restricted pan-mAChR antagonist for use in schizophrenia. In early clinical trials of moderate to high severity patients without treatment resistant history, it has demonstrated efficacy about equivalent to that of other anti-psychotics (20-point improvement in PANSS vs 10-point placebo improvement), with a notably different side effect profile (very low rates of metabolic effects, hypotension, weight changes, or EPS) with moderately reported rates of nausea and constipation. No trials have been published to date regarding use in combination with other antipsychotics, use in treatment resistant patients, or head-to-head comparisons with other medications. This is the first anti-psychotic drug approved that uses a muscarinic mechanism of action, and many others are in development.

<doc id="743437" wikidata="Q152452" url="?curid=743437" title="Gunnar Myrdal">
<text>Karl Gunnar Myrdal ( ; ; 6 December 1898 – 17 May 1987) was a Swedish economist and sociologist. In 1974, he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences along with Friedrich Hayek for &quot;their pioneering work in the theory of money and economic fluctuations and for their penetrating analysis of the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena.&quot; When his wife, Alva Myrdal, received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1982, they became the fourth ever married couple to have won Nobel Prizes, and the first and only to win independent of each other (versus a shared Nobel Prize by scientist spouses).

Myrdal is best known in the United States for his study of race relations, which culminated in his book &quot;An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy&quot;. The study was influential in the 1954 landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. In Sweden, his work and political influence were important to the establishment of the &quot;Folkhemmet&quot; and the welfare state.

==Early life and education==
Myrdal was born on 6 December 1898, in Skattungbyn, Sweden, to Karl Adolf Pettersson (1876–1934), a building contractor, and his wife Anna Sofia Karlsson (1878–1965). He took the name &quot;Myrdal&quot; in 1914 after his ancestors&#x27; farm Myr in the province of Dalarna.

There is a possibly apocryphal story about an interaction between him and Gustav Cassel, where Cassel was reported to say, &quot;Gunnar, you should be more respectful to your elders, because it is we who will determine your promotion,&quot; and he replied, &quot;Yes, but it is we who will write your obituaries.&quot;

Gunnar Myrdal graduated with a law degree from Stockholm University in 1923 and a doctorate in economics in 1927. In June 1919, he met Alva Reimer, whom he married in October 1924 and had the first of their three children in 1927.

Myrdal&#x27;s PhD thesis, &quot;The Problem of Price Formation under Economic Change&quot;, had three parts: The Basics of the Dynamic Problem of Price Formation, The Problem of the Profit of the Enterprise, and The Optimal Mode of Construction and Change, the most mathematical of the three, where he studied equilibrium of price formation under dynamic conditions.

In Gunnar Myrdal&#x27;s doctoral dissertation, published in 1927, he examined the role of expectations in price formation. His analysis strongly influenced the Stockholm school. He built on Knut Wicksell&#x27;s theories of cumulative process of endogenous money, stressing the importance of Knightian uncertainty and &quot;ex ante&quot; and &quot;ex post&quot; expectations role in the economic process.

==Early career==
Between 1925 and 1929, Myrdal studied in Britain and Germany. He was a Rockefeller Fellow and visited the United States in 1929–1930. During this period, he published his first books, including &quot;The Political Element in the Development of Economic Theory&quot; in 1930&quot;.&quot; Returning to Europe, he served for one year as associate professor in the Graduate Institute of International Studies, Geneva, Switzerland.

&quot;The Political Element&quot; is a compilation of Myrdal&#x27;s lectures presented at the University of Stockholm. It gives us the historical account of the influence of politics in the development of economic theory and the relation between them. Gunnar believed that economics would be considered a true science only when the political aspect was dissociated. It was initially written to criticize the older generation of Swedish economists such as Eli Heckscher, Gustav Cassel, and Brisman, for combining and confusing facts and values in their theories of ‘maximum welfare’, ‘price level’, and ‘national income’. But later it turned out be a general critique of the economic theory where he emphasized that economics should be objective and independent from values. He wrote that although economists claim to be scientific and objective, their conclusion from their analyses was always politically inclined. &quot;The Political Element&quot; was translated to German in 1932 and to English in 1953.

Gunnar Myrdal was at first fascinated by the abstract mathematical models coming into fashion in the 1920s, and helped found the Econometric Society in London. Later, however, he accused the movement of ignoring the problem of distribution of wealth in its obsession with economic growth, of using faulty statistics and substituting Greek letters for missing data in its formulas and of flouting logic. He wrote, &quot;Correlations are not explanations and besides, they can be as spurious as the high correlation in Finland between foxes killed and divorces.&quot; Professor Myrdal was an early supporter of the theses of John Maynard Keynes, although he maintained that the basic idea of adjusting national budgets to slow or speed an economy was first developed by him and articulated in his book &quot;Monetary Economics&quot;, published in 1932, four years prior to Keynes&#x27; &quot;General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot;.

William Barber&#x27;s comment upon Myrdal&#x27;s work on monetary theory goes like this:
Economist G. L. S. Shackle claimed the importance of Gunnar Myrdal&#x27;s analysis by which saving and investment are allowed to adjust ex ante to each other. However, the reference to &quot;ex ante&quot; and &quot;ex post&quot; analysis has become so usual in modern macroeconomics that the position of Keynes to not include it in his work was currently considered as an oddity, if not a mistake. As Shackle put it:
Gunnar Myrdal also developed the key concept circular cumulative causation, a multi-causal approach where the core variables and their linkages are delineated.

==Academic career==
Gunnar Myrdal became professor at Stockholms Högskola 1933. Myrdal was professor of economics at Stockholms Högskola for 15 years, until 1947.

He became a Social Democratic Member of Parliament from 1933, and again from 1945 to 1947 he served as Minister of Commerce and Industry in Tage Erlander&#x27;s government. During this period, he was heavily criticized for his financial agreement with the Soviet Union. At the same time he was accused of being responsible for the Swedish monetary crisis in 1947.

He coauthored with his wife, Alva Myrdal, the &quot;Crisis in the Population Question&quot; (, 1934). The work of Gunnar and Alva inspired policies adopted by the Minister of Social Affairs, Gustav Möller, to provide social support to families.

Gunnar Myrdal headed a comprehensive study of sociological, economic, anthropological and legal data on race relations in the United States funded by the Carnegie Corporation, starting in 1938. The result of the effort was Gunnar Myrdal&#x27;s best-known work, &quot;An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy&quot;, published in 1944, written with the collaboration of R. M. E. Sterner and Arnold Rose. He characterized the problem of race relations as a dilemma because of a perceived conflict between high ideals, embodied in what he called the &quot;American Creed,&quot; on the one hand and poor performance on the other. In the generations since the Civil War, the U.S. had been unable to put its human rights ideals into practice for the African American tenth of its population. This book was cited by the U.S. Supreme Court in its 1954 decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, which outlawed racial segregation in public schools. Myrdal planned on doing a similar study on gender inequality, but he could not find funding for this project and never completed it.

==World War II and after==
During World War II, Gunnar Myrdal was staunchly and publicly anti-Nazi. Together with his wife, Alva, he wrote &quot;Contact with America&quot; in 1941, which praised the United States&#x27; democratic institutions.

Gunnar Myrdal became the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in 1947. During his tenure, he founded one of the leading centers of economic research and policy development. After ten years in the position, Dr. Myrdal resigned as Executive Secretary in 1957. In 1956 and 1957, he was able to publish &quot;An International Economy, Problems and Prospects&quot;, &quot;Rich Lands and Poor&quot; and &quot;Economic Theory and Underdeveloped Regions.&quot; Myrdal was also a signatory of the 1950 UNESCO statement &quot;The Race Question&quot;, which rebuts the theories of racial supremacy and purity, and also influenced the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision. “What he knew about [United States] constitutional law we are not told nor have we been able to learn.” In 1956, Myrdal wrote the foreword for African American author Richard Wright&#x27;s &quot;The Color Curtain: A Report on the Bandung Conference&quot;.

Between 1960 and 1967, he was a professor of international economics at Stockholm University. In 1961, he founded the Institute for International Economic Studies at the University. Throughout the 1960s, he worked on a comprehensive study of trends and policies in South Asia for the Twentieth Century Fund. The study culminated in his three-volume &quot;Asian Drama: An Inquiry into the Poverty of Nations,&quot; published in 1968. In 1970, he published a companion book called &quot;The Challenge of World Poverty,&quot; where he laid out what he believed to be the chief policy solutions to the problems he outlined in &quot;Asian Drama.&quot;

Gunnar Myrdal strongly opposed the Vietnam War. In &quot;Asian Drama&quot;, Myrdal predicted that land reform and pacification would fail in Vietnam and urged the United States to begin negotiations with North Vietnam. After returning to Sweden, he headed the Swedish Vietnam Committee and became co-chair of International Commission of Inquiry Into U.S. War Crimes in Indochina. He also presided over the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, an international watchdog for the arms trade. He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.
In 1967 Myrdal received an honorary doctorate from Sir George Williams University, which later became Concordia University.

In 1971 both he and his wife received honorary doctorates from Gustavus Adolphus College in Saint Peter, Minnesota.

He shared the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences (otherwise known as the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics) with Friedrich Hayek in 1974, but argued for its abolition because he believed that economics is a “soft” science.

During 1974–1975, he served as visiting professor at NYU.

Myrdal received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1979.

==Personal life==

Myrdal married politician and diplomat Alva Myrdal in 1924, and together had son Jan Myrdal (born 1927), daughter Sissela Bok (born 1934) and daughter Kaj Fölster (born 1936). Through Fölster, he is the grandfather of Swedish economist Stefan Fölster.

Alva Myrdal was a prominent leader of the disarmament movement. She, along with Alfonso García Robles, received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1982.

Myrdal suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease and was hospitalized for two months before he died in a hospital in Trångsund, south of Stockholm, on 17 May 1987. His daughter Kaj Fölster and his grandson, Janken Myrdal, were present.

==Contributions to the philosophy of knowledge==
Gunnar Myrdal&#x27;s scientific influence was not limited to economics. Through the introduction to &quot;Asian Drama&quot; with the title &quot;The Beam in our Eyes&quot; (a biblical reference; cf. Matthew 7:1–2) he introduced the approach mentioned as scientific relativism of values. This behavioral approach is narrowly connected to behavioralism and is built on the idea that the logical gulf between &quot;is&quot; and &quot;ought&quot; is more sophisticated than just dividing premises into categories. The articles edited in &quot;Value in Social Theory&quot; underlines Myrdal&#x27;s importance to political science. As political science normally is considered more descriptive than economics, one might get the idea that Myrdal should not have dealt systematically with the values applied to economics. On the contrary, Myrdal connected social science, political science and economics as a practitioner.

Myrdal published many notable works, both before and after &quot;American Dilemma&quot; and, among many other contributions to social and public policy, founded and chaired the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Internationally revered as a father-figure of social policy, he contributed to social democratic thinking throughout the world, in collaboration with friends and colleagues in the political and academic arenas. Sweden and Britain were among the pioneers of a welfare state and books by Myrdal (&quot;Beyond the Welfare State&quot; – New Haven, 1958) and Richard Titmuss (&quot;Essays on “The Welfare State”&quot; – London, 1958) unsurprisingly explore similar themes. Myrdal&#x27;s theoretical key concept &quot;circular cumulative causation&quot; contributed to the development of modern Non-equilibrium economics.

=== Welfare world ===
Myrdal suggested that we need to evolve from the welfare state to the welfare world, which would enable the redistribution of income and wealth not only within a country but also on a global scale. During the Cold War era, In &quot;Beyond the Welfare State&quot;, he proposed the idea of the welfare world to overcome the limitations of the welfare state in the West. Myrdal&#x27;s recommendations were not accepted by international technocrats or by developing countries. However, he also thought it a more difficult task to establish the welfare world than a welfare state.

He pointed out the following limitations of the welfare state:
* Nationalism of already existing Western welfare states preventing development in underdeveloped countries.
* Other difficulties of development in the developing countries.
* Existence of the communist countries acting as a provocateur for more revolutionary transformations.

<text>In geodesy and geophysics, the Bouguer anomaly (named after Pierre Bouguer) is a gravity anomaly, corrected for the height at which it is measured and the attraction of terrain. The height correction alone gives a free-air gravity anomaly.

==Definition==
The Bouguer anomaly formula_1 defined as:

formula_2

Here, 
* formula_3 is the free-air gravity anomaly.
* formula_4 is the &quot;Bouguer correction&quot; which allows for the gravitational attraction of rocks between the measurement point and sea level;
* formula_5 is a &quot;terrain correction&quot; which allows for deviations of the surface from an infinite horizontal plane

The free-air anomaly formula_3, in its turn, is related to the observed gravity formula_7 as follows:

formula_8

where:
* formula_9 is the correction for latitude (because the Earth is not a perfect sphere; see normal gravity);
* formula_10 is the free-air correction.

==Reduction==
A Bouguer reduction is called &quot;simple&quot; (or &quot;incomplete&quot;) if the terrain is approximated by an infinite flat plate called the Bouguer plate. A &quot;refined&quot; (or &quot;complete&quot;) Bouguer reduction removes the effects of terrain more precisely. The difference between the two is called the &quot;(residual) terrain effect&quot; (or &quot;(residual) terrain correction&quot;) and is due to the differential gravitational effect of the unevenness of the terrain; it is always negative.

===Simple reduction===
The gravitational acceleration formula_11 outside a Bouguer plate is perpendicular to the plate and towards it, with magnitude &quot;2πG&quot; times the mass per unit area, where formula_12 is the gravitational constant. It is independent of the distance to the plate (as can be proven most simply with Gauss&#x27;s law for gravity, but can also be proven directly with Newton&#x27;s law of gravity). The value of formula_12 is , so formula_11 is times the mass per unit area. Using  =  () we get times the mass per unit area. For mean rock density () this gives 

The Bouguer reduction for a Bouguer plate of thickness formula_15 is
formula_16
where formula_17 is the density of the material and formula_12 is the constant of gravitation. On Earth the effect on gravity of elevation is 0.3086 mGal m−1 decrease when going up, minus the gravity of the Bouguer plate, giving the &quot;Bouguer gradient&quot; of 0.1967 mGal m−1.

More generally, for a mass distribution with the density depending on one Cartesian coordinate &quot;z&quot; only, gravity for any &quot;z&quot; is 2π&quot;G&quot; times the difference in mass per unit area on either side of this &quot;z&quot; value. A combination of two parallel infinite if equal mass per unit area plates does not produce any gravity between them.

<text>Charles George Hanna (1889–1942) was a politician from the United States. He was the forty-first mayor of Syracuse, New York (Republican, 1926–1929) and largely responsible for bringing air travel to the Syracuse Area. He acquired an airfield in Camillus, New York and renamed it Syracuse Municipal Airport in 1927. After World War II, the airport couldn&#x27;t keep up with demand, so the city took over the former Mattydale Bomber Base and renamed it Syracuse Hancock International Airport.

<doc id="743447" wikidata="Q378485" url="?curid=743447" title="Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España">
<text>() is a first-person narrative written in 1568 by military adventurer, conquistador, and colonist settler Bernal Díaz del Castillo (1492–1584), who served in three Mexican expeditions: those of Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (1517) to the Yucatán peninsula; the expedition of Juan de Grijalva (1518); and the expedition of Hernán Cortés (1519) in the Valley of Mexico. The history relates his participation in the conquest of the Aztec Empire.

Late in life, when Díaz del Castillo was in his 60s, he finished his first-person account of the Spanish conquest of the West Indies and the Aztec Empire. He wrote &quot;The True History of the Conquest of New Spain&quot; to defend the story of the common-soldier conquistador within the histories about the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. He presents his narrative as an alternative to the critical writings of Bartolomé de Las Casas, whose descriptions of Spanish treatment of native peoples emphasized the cruelty of the conquest. He also criticized the histories of the hagiographic biographers of Hernán Cortés, specifically that of Francisco López de Gómara, who Díaz del Castillo believed minimized the role of the 700 enlisted soldiers instrumental to conquering the Aztec Empire. In his eyewitness account, narrated in the first-person plural &quot;we,&quot; Díaz del Castillo strongly defends the actions of the conquistadors while emphasizing their humanity and honesty. He summarizes their actions by saying, &quot;We went there to serve God, and also to get rich.&quot;

The history is occasionally uncharitable about Cortés, whom Díaz del Castillo felt had taken most of the glory for himself while intentionally ignoring the efforts of the other Spaniards and their indigenous allies. Díaz del Castillo also criticizes some of Cortés’ decisions during the expedition as selfish or unjust, such as the torture and execution of Tlatoani (emperor) Cuauhtémoc. Like other professional soldiers who participated in the conquest of New Spain, Díaz del Castillo found himself among the ruins of Tenochtitlán only slightly wealthier than when he arrived in Mexico. The land and gold compensation paid to many of the conquistadors proved a poor return for their investment of months of soldiering and fighting across Mexico and Central America, and Díaz del Castillo expresses his discontentment and bittterness about his and the other soldiers’ treatment by the Spanish government.

Though Díaz del Castillo justifies his and the other Spaniards’ actions through the lens of a just war, he does express some regret over the destruction of Tenochtitlán, writing, &quot;When I beheld the scenes around me, I thought within myself, this was the garden of the world. All of the wonders I beheld that day, nothing now remains. All is overthrown and lost.&quot;

<text>5566 was a Taiwanese boy band, formed under Taiwanese music company, J-Star. The name is derived from their original five members (Zax Wang, Jason Hsu, Sam Wang, Rio Peng and band leader Tony Sun), working in six entertainment fields (singing, movies and dramas, hosting, modelling, commercials, and dancing). Over the course of their career, they have starred in three idol dramas: &quot;My MVP Valentine&quot;, &quot;Westside Story&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Fighting&quot;. They have also released four albums: &quot;1st Album&quot;, &quot;Boyfriend&quot;, &quot;Long Time No See&quot;, and &quot;Bravo&quot;; two compilation albums: &quot;C&#x27;est Si Bon Greatest Hits&quot;, &quot;I Love 56 - Re-emerging Legends: 5 Years Greatest Hits&quot;; and taken part in four OSTs: &quot;My MVP Valentine OST&quot;, &quot;Westside Story soundtrack&quot;, &quot;Mr. Fighting OST&quot;, and &quot;Ying Ye 3 Jia 1&quot;.

5566 disbanded in 2008, but occasionally reunited in 2014, 2016 and 2019.

==Grouping==
5566 not only work together as a group, but also individually. For instance, Sam Wang is famous for his appearances in many TV series as well as his membership in another company&#x27;s band called 183 Club, which effectively makes him the busiest 5566 member; Tony Sun and Zax Wang often have dramas to shoot; while Jason Hsu has been featured in many local promotional campaigns. Zax Wang and Jason Hsu are also hosts of SETTV&#x27;s entertainment show, Showbiz (完全娛樂 / Wan Quan Yu Le) (2002–2011). 5566 as a group has hosted TTV&#x27;s Young Guns (少年特攻隊 / Shao Nian Te Gong Dui) (2002–2007) and CTS&#x27;s Dou Zhen Ju Le Bu (鬥陣俱樂部) (2004–2005). Additionally, leader Tony Sun is also known to take part in a lot of the behind-the-scenes work at Jungiery.
not only that ,the Hunger Games,Hosted by them (2017 -?)

==History==
===Pre-debut===
Tony Sun has gained much solo experience by releasing several well-received albums in the Taiwanese dialect in the 1990s; he even gained the title of the &quot;Taiwanese little champion&quot;. However, his popularity waned when he had to fulfill his mandatory military service. Sun was signed under Jungiery since his earlier days; this was how he used his connection with the company to secure the second part of his career.

Zax Wang was a member of short-lived boyband POSTM3N. After the group disbanded, he was planning to start a cellphone shop with a colleague when Sun De Rong, Jungiery&#x27;s head, contacted him. Wang took up the deal.

Sam Wang was a national soccer player and a model before signing with Jungiery. He is also a member of another Jungiery boyband 183 Club.

Jason Hsu was originally obese and unpopular in school. However, he started appearing in several commercials when he successfully lost weight, giving him the looks of an idol. He was also a model. Jungiery offered him a contract, and he gladly accepted.

Rio Peng was known as Xiao Dao. He was playing at My MVP Valentine with another member, too.

===2002: Popularity Rise===
5566 was formed on 21 January 2002 by manager Sun De Rong (also known as Sun Zhong).

5566&#x27;s debut and sudden rise to popularity has been a controversial topic. They showcased their multiple talents in their debut interview, yet their hard work was not respected, drawing much criticism and earning them a negative nickname, &quot;Turkey&quot;, which is still used today. This continued until their first idol drama, aired on local television. The drama, featuring 5566 in the lead roles, exceeded expectations by having a higher viewership rating than several other idol dramas during that season. Not only did this drama help skyrocket 5566 to fame, it was also the driving force behind the careers of Angela Chang and Yen Hsing-su.

Due to a serious injury that he suffered during the filming of a variety show, Rio Peng was temporary pulled out from group activities to recover. Although the remaining 5566 members confirmed that Peng was still part of the group, Peng would eventually leave the group, forming his own management company, &quot;Wingman Entertainment&quot;.

In December, 5566 released their first album, which sold 240,000 copies in Taiwan. However, ever since the album was re-released in two additional versions, 5566 would become infamous for regularly repackaging their albums. This holds true till today; the &quot;Westside Story soundtrack&quot; and the &quot;Top on the Forbidden City OST&quot; are the only two albums that remain unrepackaged.

===2003: &quot;Westside Story&quot; and Peng&#x27;s Departure===
Promotional activity for their first album continued during the first few months of this year. When activities ended, 5566 temporarily bade farewell to their home country for overseas promotion in Southeast Asia. After this was finished, 5566 began work for their second idol drama, Westside Story. This drama was also well-received, and the &quot;Westside Story soundtrack&quot; complimented the drama nicely, faring well on the music charts.

2003 also saw the start of Jungiery&#x27;s marketing strategy, which was to utilize 5566&#x27;s fame to increase the popularity of other Jungiery artists. This was seen on the &quot;Westside Story soundtrack album&quot;, where a song by the now-defunct bubblegum-pop group R&amp;B and a duet between Tony Sun and Cyndi Wang were included. Both R&amp;B and Cyndi Wang became well-known artistes almost instantly.

Rio Peng, with his company &quot;Corvette Entertainment&quot; (the name Corvette was later abandoned in 2006 in favour of Wingman), formed and managed a dance group K One.

===2004: &quot;Top on the Forbidden City&quot; and &quot;In Love With A Rich Girl&quot;===
In 2004 Sam Wang played a supporting role in the drama &quot;Top on the Forbidden City&quot;. The theme song for this drama, &quot;Twist The Fate&quot;, was a collaboration between 5566 and the group managed by Peng, K-One. During the period &quot;Top on the Forbidden City&quot; was aired, 5566 began advertising for the 7-Eleven convenience store chain. 7-Eleven released special junk food and instant food varieties based on 5566&#x27;s own ideas. 5566 recorded a short jingle, C&#x27;est Si Bon, to aid this campaign.

After &quot;Top on the Forbidden City&quot; was finished, Sam Wang joined a new group called 183 Club, which fame eventually rivaled 5566 in China.

The same year, 5566 released their first compilation album, &quot;C&#x27;est Si Bon Greatest Hits&quot;. This compilation featured songs from their previous three works, and three new songs, one of which was the re-recorded full version of C&#x27;est Si Bon, which also featured 7 Flowers. The song was initially only a jingle for the 7-11 advertisement. By popular demand, verses were newly written and composed to make a full song. The ending of promotions of this Greatest Hits album also signaled the end of 5566&#x27;s core activities for the year.

2004 is also the year in which member Jason Hsu starred in his own TV series / idol drama, &quot;In Love With A Rich Girl&quot;. The other three 5566 members were featured as special guest stars in episode one.

===2005: &quot;Mr. Fighting&quot; and &quot;Long Time No See&quot;===
5566 sprang to an early start in 2005 with their new idol drama, Mr. Fighting. Unexpectedly, both the drama and the OST did not do as well as expected. Many thought 5566 was beginning to lose their grip on the entertainment industry. Jungiery&#x27;s manager, seeming to notice this and fearing that the whole J-Star group would collapse if their main pillar fell with no backups for support, then decided to shift his attention to 183 Club. After this drama, problems between Avex Taiwan and Jungiery arose, and Jungiery defected to Warner Music.

5566 also released their third album this year, &quot;Long Time No See&quot;. This album was also 5566&#x27;s first musical work released under the Warner Music label. This album featured more of Tony Sun&#x27;s vocals, as there were complaints that Zax Wang&#x27;s vocals were featured too much in their second album. Despite this, the above-mentioned decline and many fans&#x27; voicing a deterioration of quality slightly dented the album&#x27;s performance.

===2006: Hiatus===
2006 was a hiatus year for 5566&#x27;s activities. Tony Sun and Zax Wang both went to Mainland China to film their own dramas; Sam Wang along with 183 Club starred in idol drama The Magicians of Love which aired early in the year, and released an album during the summer; Jason Hsu at first stayed in Taiwan to attend various promotional campaigns, as he was still studying. Later on, Jason starred in the movie, My Sassy Teacher, and also went to the Philippines to play a role in the series, Captain Barbell.

On November 19, Zax Wang&#x27;s daughter was born. She is affectionately known to the public as &quot;Le Le&quot;. Le Le&#x27;s mother is Taiwanese entertainer Ji Qin.

5566 took part in the 41st Golden Bell Awards as award presenters and performed various songs from their OSTs.

===2007: &quot;Love Miracle 3&quot;===
To kick the year off, 5566, along with Jungiery, released a new compilation album in the Love Miracle series, Love Miracle 3. This compilation, following the tradition, included some new songs as well as selected older songs. 5566 recorded two new songs for this album, On Fire (also the Chinese theme song for the Ghost Rider film), and Red Youth Is Knocking. Jungiery martial arts group Tai Chi collaborated with 5566 in the music video of On Fire. The same group had previously collaborated with 5566 in the song &quot;One World One Dream&quot; from their third album, both vocally and visually.

In May, 5566 released a special compilation album titled I Love 56 - Re-emerging Legends: 5 Years Greatest Hits. This album did not feature any new songs and was exclusively released in the Mainland China area.

2007 was a year in which all of 5566&#x27;s members appeared as lead actors in their own individual dramas. In February, Zax Wang co-starred with Taiwanese singer Pace Wu in the drama Shi Shen (God of Cookery). The other three members made their appearances one after another in the later half of the summer holidays: Jason Hsu co-starred with &quot;Prince-Frog Couple&quot; Ming Dao and Joe Chen in idol drama Ying Ye 3 Jia 1 (Ying Ye 3+1); Tony Sun starred in the Taiwan-Mainland-Hong Kong collaboration martial arts drama The Sword and the Chess of Death; and Sam Wang starred in idol drama E Nü Ah Chu (Mean Girl A Chu). Tony also starred in a new idol drama titled Full Count (Ai Qing, Liang Hao San Huai) during fall.

On November 24, 5566 attended the 42nd Golden Bell Awards. They were award presenters like in the previous year, but did not perform.

===2008: &quot;Bravo&quot;===
5566 kicked off the new year with their fourth studio album, Bravo, which hit shelves on January 4 in Taiwan, and January 8 in Mainland China, Singapore and Malaysia regions. The title song, Bravo (喝采 / He Cai), was themed towards the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. Five hundred fans attended the first autograph session in Taiwan, but more than 1000 fans attended their first ever autograph session in Hong Kong, on January 27, 2008. Furthermore, their songs Bravo (喝采 / He Cai), Roaming In China (漫游中國 / Man You Zhong Guo), and Bright Moon (月兒光光 / Yue Er Guang Guang) have successfully made their way into Singapore&#x27;s music charts. While 5566&#x27;s fame slowly rises in Asia, Sun De Rong, 5566&#x27;s manager, has also openly stated plans to slowly withdraw from the Taiwan market and increase focus on the Mainland China market.

5566 dubbed the Chinese version of Animal Planet&#x27;s Animal Winter Olympics, also in January. The program aired on February 9 &amp; 10, respectively.

5566 was invited to The Olympics 100-Day Countdown celebration on April 30 in Beijing, China. They performed the song (英雄 / Hero) with Chris Yu, which was also the composer of the song. 5566 also performed &quot;Beijing Welcomes You&quot; with other 100 singers in front of the Forbidden City in Beijing, China. 5566 also took part in the recording and music video of the official Olympics song, &quot;Beijing Welcomes You&quot;, along with 100 other artistes from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. (Other Taiwanese artistes who took part in the recording included Wang LeeHom, Jolin Tsai, Kenji Wu KeQun, Vivian Hsu, Fan WeiQi, Lin ZhiLing, etc.)

5566 was originally appointed to be the spokespeople to promote the Taiwan team for the Beijing Olympics. However, because of political issues, they are unable to do so.

Zax&#x27;s son Yaya was born July 28, 2008, one day after Jason&#x27;s birthday.

Zax and wife Ji Qin held their wedding on 11 December 2008 at Guam Island. Their children Le Le and Ya Ya were present to witness the ceremony.

===2010: Managing new groups===
During November 2010, Jungiery Management held a press conference introducing three new groups. Tony Sun was revealed as the manager behind male group 7 km and girl group Wonder4, and being a member of the former; Zax Wang became leader of dance group Merry Monarc.

===2014 and beyond: Reunion===
January 2014 saw the on-stage reunion of 5566 when all members, less Rio Peng, appeared as special guests at a concert of fellow Taiwanese boyband, Mayday. In the collaboration, the two bands performed a medley of 5566&#x27;s and Mayday&#x27;s hit tracks. Despite sparking online debates between fans of both bands, the appearance of 5566 ignited a persistent online catchphrase - 56不能亡 (5566 cannot perish) - by fans, urging for their official comeback.

Following calls for their return, 5566&#x27;s comeback concerts were in the pipeline. However, the plans were eventually scrapped, reportedly due to Sam Wang&#x27;s conflicting pre-existing acting schedules that hindered his availability to commit.

In October 2016, 5566 formally reunited at the 51st Golden Bell Awards, to which they were invited as special guest performers. With their return, several offers were made to the band, including an invitation to host a new Taiwanese variety show - CTV&#x27;s 飢餓遊戲 (The Hunger Games). However, Sam Wang would sit out from the show due to his schedules. The three-member 5566 also headlined 2017 New Year Day&#x27;s countdown ceremony held at Taichung. In 2017, The Hunger Games was nominated for the &quot;Best Reality and Game Show&quot; award at the 52nd Golden Bell Awards, whereas in 2018, the three members were nominated for the &quot;Best Host for a Reality or Game Show&quot; award at the 53rd Golden Bell Awards for their performance in The Hunger Games.

In February 2019, the three-member 5566 held their concert, titled &quot;SINCE 5566&quot;, at the Taipei Arena (臺北小巨蛋), with Rio Peng joining in as the guest performer. Tickets to the concert reportedly sold out in 5-minutes. In July of the same year, the Singapore-arm of the concert was held at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.

<doc id="743451" wikidata="Q5126491" url="?curid=743451" title="Clarence E. Hancock">
<text>Clarence Eugene Hancock (February 13, 1885 – January 3, 1948) was an American attorney and politician from New York. He was most notable for his service as a U.S. Representative from 1927 to 1947.

A native of Syracuse, New York, Hancock graduated from Wesleyan University (1906) and New York Law School (1908), then practiced law in Syracuse. A veteran of the Pancho Villa Expedition and World War I, Hancock went on to serve as Syracuse&#x27;s corporation counsel from 1926 to 1927. A Republican, in 1927 Hancock won a special election for the U.S. House. He was reelected every two years from 1928 to 1944, and served from November 8, 1927, to January 3, 1947.

Hancock did not run for reelection in 1946 because of declining health. He died in Washington, D.C., on January 3, 1948, and was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Syracuse.

==Early life==
Hancock was born in Syracuse, New York, on February 13, 1885, the son of Martha (Connelly) Hancock and Theodore E. Hancock. Theodore Hancock was an attorney and political figure who served as New York Attorney General from 1894 to 1898. Clarence Hancock attended Syracuse&#x27;s Madison School and graduated from Syracuse Central High School. He then attended Wesleyan University, from which he graduated in 1906, and New York Law School from which he received his LL.B. in 1908. After completing law school, Hancock was admitted to the bar and practiced in Syracuse.

==Military service==
As a member of the New York National Guard&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Regiment, Hancock attained the rank of sergeant and served on the Mexican border during the 1916 Pancho Villa Expedition. During World War I, he served in France with the 104th Machine Gun Battalion, a unit of the 27th Division, and attained the rank of captain as commander of the battalion&#x27;s Company D. He subsequently served as an assistant to the division&#x27;s judge advocate, J. Leslie Kincaid. The 27th Division commander, John F. O&#x27;Ryan, cited Hancock for bravery during combat at Jonc de Mer Ridge, near Le Cateau-Cambrésis, France, on October 18, 1918. During the fighting, Hancock personally conducted front line reconnaissance to determine the best locations to emplace his guns. While under fire throughout the battle, he maintained liaison with the Infantry units his company supported in order to enable their attack. For his heroism, Hancock received the Citation Star. When this award was converted to the Silver Star in 1932, Hancock&#x27;s decoration was upgraded the new award.

==Legal career==
Hancock was Syracuse&#x27;s corporation counsel from 1926 to 1927. In addition, he was a longtime member of Wesleyan University&#x27;s board of trustees and the board of directors of the &quot;Syracuse Journal&quot; newspaper. Hancock was a member of the Onondaga County Bar Association, New York State Bar Association, and Syracuse Chamber of Commerce. From 1928 to 1948, Hancock served as a director of Syracuse&#x27;s Merchants National Bank and Trust Company.

In addition to his legal career, Hancock was also involved in civic and charitable endeavors, including serving as president of the Syracuse Music Festival Association. In addition, he was vice commander of his American Legion post. Hancock was also an athlete, and was a member of the Sedgwick Farm Club (tennis), Cazenovia Club (golf and tennis), Onondaga Golf and Country Club (golf), and Skaneateles Country Club (golf). Hancock was also a member of several social organizations, including Syracuse&#x27;s University Club and the Century Club of Syracuse.

==Member of Congress==
In 1927, Hancock was a successful Republican candidate in a special election for the United States House of Representatives. He was reelected nine times, and served from November 8, 1927, to January 3, 1947. As a member of Congress, Hancock opposed President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. He served on the Judiciary and Naval Affairs Committees and was also chair of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee&#x27;s speaker&#x27;s bureau. In addition, he served as head of the party&#x27;s eastern speaker&#x27;s bureau for the 1936 elections.

==Death and burial==
Hancock did not run for reelection in 1946 because of ill health. He died in Washington, D.C., on January 3, 1948. Hancock was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Syracuse.

==Family==
In 1912, Hancock married Emily W. Shonk (1885–1974) of Plymouth, Pennsylvania. They were the parents of a son, John S. Hancock (1914–2007), a veteran of World War II who pursued a banking career in Syracuse.

Hancock&#x27;s brother Stewart Freeman Hancock (1883–1966) was a prominent Syracuse area attorney. Hancock&#x27;s nephew Stewart F. Hancock Jr. was a judge of the New York Court of Appeals.

==Legacy==
Syracuse Hancock International Airport and the co-located Hancock Field Air National Guard Base are both named in Hancock&#x27;s honor. After his death, Hancock&#x27;s family donated his papers to Syracuse University. They were later transferred to the State University of New York at Albany. Hancock&#x27;s papers, titled Clarence E. Hancock Papers, 1929–1946, are now part of the state university&#x27;s M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections.

<doc id="743458" wikidata="Q5530572" url="?curid=743458" title="Lightning arrester">
<text>A lightning arrester (alternative spelling lightning arrestor) (also called lightning isolator) is a device, essentially an air gap between an electric wire and ground, used on electric power transmission and telecommunication systems to protect the insulation and conductors of the system from the damaging effects of lightning. The typical lightning arrester has a high-voltage terminal and a ground terminal. When a lightning surge (or switching surge, which is very similar) travels along the power line to the arrester, the current from the surge is diverted through the arrester, in most cases to earth.

In telegraphy and telephony, a lightning arrester is placed where wires enter a structure, preventing damage to electronic instruments within and ensuring the safety of individuals near them. Smaller versions of lightning arresters, also called surge arresters, are devices that are connected between each conductor in power and communications systems and the earth. These prevent the flow of the normal power or signal currents to ground, but provide a path over which high-voltage lightning current flows, bypassing the connected equipment. Their purpose is to limit the rise in voltage when a communications or power line is struck by lightning or is near to a lightning strike.

If protection fails or is absent, lightning that strikes the electrical system introduces thousands of kilovolts that may damage the transmission lines, and can also cause severe damage to transformers and other electrical or electronic devices. Lightning-produced extreme voltage spikes in incoming power lines can damage electrical home appliances or even cause death.

Lightning arresters are used to protect electric fences. They consist of a spark gap and sometimes a series inductor. Such type of equipment is also used for protecting transmitters feeding a mast radiator. For such devices the series inductance has usually just one winding.

Lightning arresters can form part of large electrical transformers and can fragment during transformer ruptures. High-voltage transformer fire barriers are required to defeat ballistics from small arms as well as projectiles from transformer bushings and lightning arresters, per NFPA 850.

==Components==
A potential target for a lightning strike, such as an outdoor television antenna, is attached to the terminal labeled A in the photograph. Terminal E is attached to a long rod buried in the ground. Ordinarily no current will flow between the antenna and the ground because there is extremely high resistance between B and C, and also between C and D. The voltage of a lightning strike, however, is many times higher than that needed to move electrons through the two air gaps. The result is that electrons go through the lightning arresters rather than traveling on to the television set and destroying it.

A lightning arrester may be a spark gap or may have a block of a semiconducting material such as silicon carbide or zinc oxide. &quot;Thyrite&quot; was the trade name used by General Electric for the silicon carbide composite used in their arrester and varistor products. Some spark gaps are open to the air, but most modern varieties are filled with a precision gas mixture, and have a small amount of radioactive material to encourage the gas to ionize when the voltage across the gap reaches a specified level. Other designs of lightning arresters use a glow-discharge tube (essentially like a neon glow lamp) connected between the protected conductor and ground, or voltage-activated solid-state switches called varistors or MOVs.

Lightning arresters used in power substations are large devices, consisting of a porcelain tube several feet long and several inches in diameter, typically filled with discs of zinc oxide. A safety port on the side of the device vents the occasional internal explosion without shattering the porcelain cylinder.

Lightning arresters are rated by the peak current they can withstand, the amount of energy they can absorb, and the breakover voltage that they require to begin conduction. They are applied as part of a lightning protection system, in combination with air terminals and bonding.

<text>U.S. Highway 138 (US 138), commissioned in 1926, is an east–west U.S. Highway in Colorado and Nebraska that travels predominantly northeast to southwest, paralleling the South Platte River and Interstate 76 (I-76). Similarly to the spurs of the former US 66 and US 99, US 138 is an orphan route. US 38 was commissioned in 1926, but US 6 was extended over it to Long Beach, California (it was subsequently truncated to Bishop, California in 1964). Therefore, US 138 still meets its former parent route&#x27;s path.

==Route description==
===Colorado===
U.S. 138 begins in Sterling at U.S. 6 and Business Loop 76. It goes northeast and intersects Colorado State Highway 113 southwest of Iliff. It becomes more easterly as it goes through Iliff, Proctor and Crook, where it intersects Colorado State Highway 55. It continues on to Sedgwick, where it meets Colorado State Highway 59. After passing through Ovid, it then meets U.S. Highway 385 west of Julesburg, and they overlap into Julesburg. Also in Julesburg, U.S. 138 intersects Colorado State Highway 11. U.S. 138 then leaves Julesburg going northeast and enters Nebraska.

===Nebraska===
Shortly after entering Nebraska, U.S. 138 intersects Interstate 80. It continues east from I-80 and enters Big Springs. At Big Springs, U.S. 138 turns north and ends at U.S. Highway 30.

==History==

The western terminus is in Sterling, Colorado, where it met U.S. Route 38 from 1926 to 1931 (US 38 became U.S. Route 6); the eastern terminus is at U.S. Route 30 north of Big Springs, Nebraska. US 138 is an example of a &quot;child&quot; route that has long outlived its &quot;parent&quot;; before U.S. Route 99 was decommissioned in 1964, US 138 was the only US route to not have a &quot;parent&quot; route.

<doc id="743466" wikidata="Q106950729" url="?curid=743466" title="CREB">
<text>CREB-TF (CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein) is a cellular transcription factor. It binds to certain DNA sequences called cAMP response elements (CRE), thereby increasing or decreasing the transcription of the genes. CREB was first described in 1987 as a cAMP-responsive transcription factor regulating the somatostatin gene.

Genes whose transcription is regulated by CREB include: &quot;c-fos&quot;, BDNF, tyrosine hydroxylase, numerous neuropeptides (such as somatostatin, enkephalin, VGF, corticotropin-releasing hormone), and genes involved in the mammalian circadian clock (PER1, PER2).

CREB is closely related in structure and function to CREM (cAMP response element modulator) and ATF-1 (activating transcription factor-1) proteins. CREB proteins are expressed in many animals, including humans.

CREB has a well-documented role in neuronal plasticity and long-term memory formation in the brain and has been shown to be integral in the formation of spatial memory. CREB downregulation is implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and increasing the expression of CREB is being considered as a possible therapeutic target for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. CREB also has a role in photoentrainment in mammals.

==Subtypes==
The following genes encode CREB or CREB-like proteins:
* CREB1 ()
* CREB2 renamed ATF4 ()
* CREB3 ()
* CREB5 ()
* CREB3L1 ()
* CREB3L2 ()
* CREB3L3 ()
* CREB3L4 ()

==Structure==
CREB proteins are activated by phosphorylation from various kinases, including PKA, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases on the Serine 133 residue. When activated, CREB protein recruits other transcriptional coactivators to bind to CRE promoter 5’ upstream region. Hydrophobic leucine amino acids are located along the inner edge of the alpha helix. These leucine residues tightly bind to leucine residues of another CREB protein forming a dimer. This chain of leucine residues forms the leucine zipper motif. The protein also has a magnesium ion that facilitates binding to DNA.

===cAMP response element=== 
The &quot;cAMP response element &quot;(CRE) is the response element for CREB which contains the highly conserved nucleotide sequence, 5&#x27;-TGACGTCA-3’. CRE sites are typically
found upstream of genes, within the promoter or enhancer regions. There are approximately 750,000 palindromic and half-site CREs in the human genome. However, the majority of these sites remain unbound due to cytosine methylation, which physically obstructs protein binding.

==Mechanism of action==
A generalized sequence of events is summarized as follows: A signal arrives at the cell surface, activates the corresponding receptor, which leads to the production of a second messenger such as cAMP or Ca2+, which in turn activates a protein kinase. This protein kinase translocates to the cell nucleus, where it activates a CREB protein. The activated CREB protein then binds to a CRE region, and is then bound to by CBP (CREB-binding protein), which coactivates it, allowing it to switch certain genes on or off. The DNA binding of CREB is mediated via its basic leucine zipper domain (bZIP domain) as depicted in the image. Evidence suggests the β-adrenoceptor (a G-protein coupled receptor) stimulates CREB signalling.

==Function in the brain==
CREB has many functions in many different organs, and some of its functions have been studied in relation to the brain. CREB proteins in neurons are thought to be involved in the formation of long-term memories; this has been shown in the marine snail &quot;Aplysia&quot;, the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, in rats and in mice (see CREB in Molecular and Cellular Cognition). CREB is necessary for the late stage of long-term potentiation. CREB also has an important role in the development of drug addiction and even more so in psychological dependence. There are activator and repressor forms of CREB. Flies genetically engineered to overexpress the inactive form of CREB lose their ability to retain long-term memory. CREB is also important for the survival of neurons, as shown in genetically engineered mice, where CREB and CREM were deleted in the brain. If CREB is lost in the whole developing mouse embryo, the mice die immediately after birth, again highlighting the critical role of CREB in promoting neuronal survival.

==Disease linkage==
Disturbance of CREB function in the brain can contribute to the development and progression of Huntington&#x27;s disease.

Abnormalities of a protein that interacts with the KID domain of CREB, the CREB-binding protein, (CBP) is associated with Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome.

There is some evidence to suggest that the under-functioning of CREB is associated with major depressive disorder. Depressed rats with an overexpression of CREB in the dentate gyrus behaved similarly to rats treated with antidepressants. From post-mortem examinations it has also been shown that the cortices of patients with untreated major depressive disorder contain reduced concentrations of CREB compared to both healthy controls and patients treated with antidepressants. The function of CREB can be modulated via a signalling pathway resulting from the binding of serotonin and noradrenaline to post-synaptic G-protein coupled receptors. Dysfunction of these neurotransmitters is also implicated in major depressive disorder.

CREB is also thought to be involved in the growth of some types of cancer.

== Involvement in circadian rhythms ==
Entrainment of the mammalian circadian clock is established via light induction of PER. Light excites melanopsin-containing photosensitive retinal ganglion cells which signal to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT). Excitation of the RHT signals the release of glutamate which is received by NMDA receptors on SCN, resulting in a calcium influx into the SCN. Calcium induces the activity of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, resulting in the activation of PKA, PKC, and CK2. These kinases then phosphorylate CREB in a circadian manner that further regulates downstream gene expression. The phosphorylated CREB recognizes the cAMP Response Element and serves as a transcription factor for Per1 and Per2, two genes that regulate the mammalian circadian clock. This induction of PER protein can entrain the circadian clock to light/dark cycles inhibits its own transcription via a transcription-translation feedback loop which can advance or delay the circadian clock. However, the responsiveness of PER1 and PER2 protein induction is only significant during the subjective night.

=== Discovery of CREB involvement in circadian rhythms ===
Michael Greenberg first demonstrated the role of CREB in the mammalian circadian clock in 1993 through a series of experiments that correlated phase-specific light pulses with CREB phosphorylation. In vitro, light during the subjective night increased phosphorylation of CREB rather than CREB protein levels. In vivo, phase shift-inducing light pulses during the subjective night correlated with CREB phosphorylation in the SCN. Experiments by Gunther Schutz in 2002 demonstrated that mutant mice lacking the Ser142 phosphorylation site failed to induce the clock regulatory gene mPer1 in response to a light pulse. Furthermore, these mutant mice had difficulty entraining to light-dark cycles.

<text>Bass Highway is an 87 kilometre highway in Victoria, Australia, running along the coasts of Western Port and Bass Strait, between Lang Lang and Leongatha via Wonthaggi. A good portion of the highway serves as a gateway from Melbourne to Phillip Island. It was named due to its proximity to Bass Strait.

==Route==
Bass Highway commences at the interchange with South Gippsland Highway at Lang Lang and heads in a southerly direction as a four-lane, dual-carriageway road along the eastern coast of Western Port Bay, through Grantville, to the turn-off to Phillip Island) at Bass. Bass Highway then narrows to a two-lane, single carriageway semi-rural highway, continuing in a south and then south-easterly direction along the Bass Strait coast through Wonthaggi to Inverloch, before turning north-easterly to eventually terminate at the intersection with South Gippsland Highway and Strzelecki Highway at Leongatha. 

==History==
The passing of the &quot;Country Roads Act of 1912&quot; through the Parliament of Victoria provided for the establishment of the Country Roads Board (later VicRoads) and their ability to declare Main Roads, taking responsibility for the management, construction and care of the state&#x27;s major roads from local municipalities. Inverloch-Leongatha Road from Inverloch to Leongatha, and Inverloch-Wonthaggi Road from Inverloch to Wonthaggi, were declared Main Roads on 10 November 1913, and (Main) Coast Road from Lang Lang to Anderson (and continuing west to San Remo), was declared a Main Road on 7 September 1914.

The passing of the &quot;Highways and Vehicles Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of Victoria provided for the declaration of State Highways, roads two-thirds financed by the State government through the Country Roads Board. Bass Highway was declared a State Highway in the 1947/48 financial year, from South Gippsland Highway near Nyora via Anderson, and Dalyston to Wonthaggi (for a total of 30 miles), subsuming the original declaration of (Main) Coast Road as a Main Road; before this declaration, the roads were also referred to as Anderson–Dalyston Road and Dalyston–Wonthaggi Road. In the 1959/60 financial year, its eastern end was extended from Wonthaggi to Inverloch, subsuming the original declaration of Inverloch-Wonthaggi Road as a Main Road. The passing of the &quot;Transport Act of 1983&quot; updated the definition of State Highways; the highway was extended east one last time from Inverloch to Leongatha in December 1990, subsuming the original declaration of Inverloch-Leongatha Road as a Main Road and completing its present-day alignment at this stage.

Bass Highway was signed as State Route 181 between Lang Lang and Wonthaggi in 1986, later extended with the road to Leongatha in 1990. With Victoria&#x27;s conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in the late 1990s, this was replaced by route M420 between Lang Lang and Grantville, A420 between Grantville and the Phillip Island turn-off at Anderson, and B460 between Anderson and Leongatha. A duplication project improving the quality of the road upgraded the A420 allocation to M420 in 2013, now running the entire way between Lang Lang and a new link road to Phillip Island in south-western Bass.

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: in 2004, VicRoads re-declared the road as Bass Highway (Arterial #6710) between South Gippsland Highway in Lang Lang and Leongatha.

===Duplication towards Phillip Island===
A project to duplicate Bass Highway from Lang Lang to Bass (east of Phillip Island) commenced in the late 1990s, addressing the high traffic demand of the route and recent crash history. It was constructed in seven stages, with Stage 7 of the project from Woolmer Road to Phillip Island Road completed in 2013.

The benefits of this project include:

*reduced travel times to Phillip Island which hosts some of Victoria&#x27;s favourite tourist and sporting attractions 
*eliminating the roundabout at Anderson, and providing a direct route between Melbourne and Phillip Island 
*bypassing a winding section of Phillip Island Road and providing two added lanes along Bass Highway. This will help address the crash history in this area. There have been 13 crashes in a recent five-year period. 
*an overpass, which will be constructed near Netherwood will provide smoother and safer movements at the connection of the Bass Highway and the new link road, for Phillip Island and Wonthaggi-bound traffic 
*helping traffic to exit Phillip Island after major events such as the MotoGP

The project was completed in 2013.

<doc id="743469" wikidata="Q1051540" url="?curid=743469" title="Tom Fletcher">
<text>Thomas Michael Fletcher (born 17 July 1985) is an English musician, composer, author and vlogger. He is one of the lead vocalists and rhythm guitarist of British pop rock band McFly, in addition to being the group&#x27;s founder.

In his 20-year career as a professional songwriter, Fletcher has written 10 UK number one singles and 21 top-ten singles. He is credited as having written songs for One Direction, Busted, the Vamps and 5 Seconds of Summer.

== Early life ==
Fletcher was born on 17 July 1985, in Harrow, London. He attended the Sylvia Young Theatre School in London, where, at the age of 13, he met Giovanna Falcone, whom he would later marry in 2012. He has a younger sister, Carrie Hope Fletcher, who is a musical theatre actress. When he was 10 years old, Fletcher starred as the main role in &quot;Oliver!&quot; at the London Palladium alongside Jim Dale as Fagin. He then went on to do a documentary about HIV for schools and starred in a commercial. In 1995, Fletcher made a small appearance in the video for the Mike + The Mechanics single &quot;Over My Shoulder&quot;. When Fletcher was a schoolchild, he was schoolmates with Busted bassist Matt Willis.

== Musical career ==
At a very young age, Fletcher began writing music commercially. He originally auditioned for band Busted, but lost out on the place to Charlie Simpson after the record label Island Records decided the band should be a trio rather than a four-piece; Fletcher states that he was in the band &quot;for about 24 hours.&quot; This led to a job with the band&#x27;s songwriting team, mainly because of the label&#x27;s intrigue with his writing talents, Fletcher then got to know Busted band member James Bourne, which would then lead to a strong songwriting relationship between the two. He has since stated that it was Bourne who taught him &quot;how to structure a pop hit&quot;.

=== McFly ===

During the writing project for Busted&#x27;s second album &quot;A Present for Everyone&quot;, Fletcher was asked by the record label if he was available to film auditions for a new band, V. It was at this time that he and Danny Jones met for the first time; Jones went to the audition mistaking the band to be a Busted-esque band, rather than the conventional, all-singing, all-dancing, boy band for which they were intended. Impressed with Jones&#x27;s style, Fletcher invited him to write with him and Bourne. When writing projects for Busted had come to an end, the two began collaborating for their own (as yet unnamed) band, and, eventually, moved into the InterContinental Hotel in London for two months to concentrate on writing together. During this time together Fletcher and Jones wrote most of their first album, &quot;Room on the 3rd Floor&quot;. Bassist Dougie Poynter and drummer Harry Judd were subsequently recruited via a classified advertisement. Fletcher came up with the idea to name the band after Marty McFly, the main character from his favorite film &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. McFly then rose to fame after Busted helped launch them by inviting them to be the opening act on their tour in March 2004.

In 2004, McFly made it into the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, beating the Beatles&#x27;s record for &quot;the youngest band to have a debut album go straight to number one&quot;. Fletcher has written the majority of McFly&#x27;s songs with Jones and Poynter, with occasional contributions by Judd; Bourne has also assisted with songwriting on occasions. As of 15 November 2010, McFly have released five studio albums and two compilation albums. A greatest hits album entitled &quot;Memory Lane: The Best of McFly&quot; which includes a number of B-sides from earlier albums, original demos of well known tracks as well as three new singles, was released in November 2012. As well as being the founding member of McFly, Fletcher plays rhythm guitar, shares lead vocals with Danny Jones, and sometimes undertakes the role of ukulele player and pianist.

Fletcher has written or co-written 10 UK number-one singles: &quot;Crashed the Wedding&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s David?&quot;, and &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; for Busted; and &quot;Five Colours in Her Hair&quot;, &quot;Obviously&quot;, &quot;All About You,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll Be OK&quot;, &quot;Please, Please&quot;, &quot;Star Girl&quot;, and &quot;Transylvania&quot; for McFly. He co-wrote eight of the songs on &quot;A Present for Everyone&quot;, as well as all but one (&quot;Not Alone&quot;, written by Jones) of the tracks on McFly&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Room on the 3rd Floor&quot;. He is the primary writer on the majority of tracks on all seven of the band&#x27;s albums. Of McFly&#x27;s four members, he has &quot;the most songwriting credits and therefore the most money&quot;.

Fletcher wrote &quot;On a Rainbow&quot;, the official song of the 2012 Summer Olympics&#x27; mascots Wenlock and Mandeville. The song features vocals from him and his sister Carrie Hope Fletcher. He also wrote the song &quot;I Want&quot; for One Direction&#x27;s debut album &quot;Up All Night&quot;, and co-wrote (with Dougie Poynter and Danny Jones) &quot;I Would&quot; for their second album &quot;Take Me Home&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Where You Belong&quot; for their third album &quot;Midnight Memories&quot;. He has co-written several songs with James Bourne including &quot;Chills in the Evening&quot;, recorded by V. He also co-wrote &quot;High Hopes&quot; along with all four members of the Vamps for their debut album, &quot;Meet the Vamps&quot;. Fletcher is also credited as having co-written the 5 Seconds of Summer track &quot;Try Hard&quot;. The song was originally released on YouTube on 1 June 2013, and in 2014 featured as a B-Side to their hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;. He also cowrote the song &quot;Own This Town&quot; with the British band Chapter 13 for their &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; semi-final performance.

==Children&#x27;s books==
Fletcher released his first children&#x27;s book in 2012. Co-written with band-mate Dougie Poynter, &quot;The Dinosaur that Pooped Christmas&quot; sold more than 72,000 copies and became the most popular debut children&#x27;s book of 2012. A follow-up titled &quot;The Dinosaur that Pooped a Planet&quot; was released on 29 August 2013.

Fletcher released his first solo novel, &quot;The Christmasaurus&quot;, on 6 October 2016, about a young boy called William Trundle who goes on a magical adventure on Christmas Eve. On 6 October 2017, a musical version of the book, entitled &quot;The Christmasaurus: Musical Edition&quot;, was released. On 21 March 2019, Fletcher released his second novel and released a Lead single from the soundtrack to &quot;THE CREAKERS: THE MUSICAL EDITION &quot; called &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Out The Light&quot; (featuring Chapter 13) from &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, along with a music video.

Fletcher released &quot;The Christmasaurus and the Winter Witch&quot; in October 2019, a sequel to his first solo novel &quot;The Christmasaurus&quot;. In November 2020, a series of Fletcher&#x27;s books appeared in McDonald&#x27;s Happy Meals as activity packs, including stickers. In 2020, he also released &#x27;The Danger Gang&#x27; a debut novel bestseller, also releasing an audiobook read by Harry Potter star, Tom Felton. The book is about a boy named Franky who moves house.

==Other work==
In 2008, Fletcher contributed to the short story anthology &quot;Wow! 366&quot;. Fletcher and the other members of McFly released their memoir &quot;Unsaid Things... Our Story&quot; in the autumn of 2012.

In June 2011, Fletcher appeared on the ITV game show &quot;The Cube&quot; and became the third person to win £100,000. He gave the money to Comic Relief and BIRT. Later that year, he appeared as a gorilla for bandmate Dougie Poynter to ask five questions for the celebrity chest on episode 11 of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. He was also there to greet Poynter on the red carpet after he had won the series. In 2013, he took part in &quot;All Star Family Fortunes&quot; and &quot;All Star Mr and Mrs&quot;. All four members of McFly played &quot;Celebrity Deal or No Deal&quot; for charity in 2012 as well. In November 2013, he appeared on &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; with Emma Willis. Fletcher has been a guest on &quot;Celebrity Juice&quot; a total of three times. In 2016, he was a judge on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Lorraine&quot;″s competition to find a new children&#x27;s author.

Fletcher has a strong YouTube audience with just over 633,000 subscribers. He was a frequent vlogger, filming his daily life and his life while he was on tour with McFly. He stopped regularly vlogging after the birth of his third child Max.

Between September and November 2021 Fletcher was a contestant on the nineteenth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; partnered with professional dancer Amy Dowden. On 21 November they were the eighth couple to be eliminated from the contest, after a dance-off against Rhys Stephenson and Nancy Xu. In 2024 Fletcher featured as a coach on thirteenth series of &quot;The Voice UK&quot; alongside Danny Jones in a duo chair.

On 12 December 2023, it was announced that Fletcher will write the music and lyrics for &quot;&quot; based on the Paddington Bear stories by Michael Bond and the film series. The musical is currently in development and planned to premiere in the UK in 2025.

== Personal life ==
On 18 April 2011, Fletcher became engaged to his schoolmate and longtime girlfriend Giovanna Falcone. They were married on 12 May 2012. In January 2013, Fletcher uploaded a video to YouTube, titled &quot;My Wedding Speech&quot;, in which he sang to the tunes of several of McFly&#x27;s most successful songs during his speech: the video has received over 24 million views.

Giovanna is also a YouTube vlogger and an author. Her books, &quot;Billy and Me&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re the One That I Want&quot;, &quot;Christmas with Billy and Me&quot;, &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot;, and &quot;Dream a Little Christmas Dream&quot; are published by Penguin&#x27;s Michael Joseph. She also released a book in 2017 about motherhood titled, &quot;Happy Mum, Happy Baby&quot;. She also blogs weekly for &quot;Hello!&quot; magazine.

It was announced on Fletcher&#x27;s YouTube channel on 29 October 2013 that the couple were expecting their first child, with a video titled, &quot;We Have Some News...&quot;. In March 2014 their son was born. Fletcher announced on 3 September 2015, again on YouTube, that his wife Giovanna was expecting their second child, by means of a video entitled &#x27;Player 2&#x27;. In February 2016 their second son was born. During both pregnancies, Fletcher and his wife Giovanna took pictures every day throughout the nine months of pregnancy. They created another YouTube video to announce the arrival of their first son, which has over 16 million views. On 3 March 2018 it was announced that their third child was due in September, but their third son was born in August 2018.

Fletcher&#x27;s younger sister is Carrie Hope Fletcher, an actress, author, singer and YouTube vlogger. Carrie joined him to produce the 2012 Olympic Mascot song, &quot;On a Rainbow&quot;. Carrie also joined as a part of the cast of &quot;The Christmasaurus Live&quot;, a live production of Tom&#x27;s debut children&#x27;s novel of the same name. She played the part of Brenda Payne and sang two solo songs, &quot;Thin Ice&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Been a Good Girl&quot;.

In McFly&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Unsaid Things&quot;, Fletcher discussed his diagnosis of bipolar disorder, which he has stated was a great influence over McFly&#x27;s second album, &quot;Wonderland&quot;. He has also described his struggles with his eating disorder, weight, and obsessive dieting.

In June 2021, Fletcher and his wife apologised for using the government scheme to furlough an employee. Fletcher and wife Giovanna released a statement on social media clarifying that the money had been returned and admitted that &quot;it was a huge error of judgement.&quot;

<doc id="743475" wikidata="Q3848604" url="?curid=743475" title="Accumulation by dispossession">
<text>Accumulation by dispossession is a concept presented by the Marxist geographer David Harvey. It defines neoliberal capitalist policies that result in a centralization of wealth and power in the hands of a few by dispossessing the public and private entities of their wealth or land. Such policies are visible in many western nations from the 1970s and to the present day. Harvey argues these policies are guided mainly by four practices: privatization, financialization, management and manipulation of crises, and state redistributions.

==Practices==

===Privatization===
Privatization and commodification of public assets have been among the most criticized and disputed aspects of neoliberalism. Summed up, they could be characterized by the process of transferring property from public ownership to private ownership. According to Marxist theory, this serves the interests of the capitalist class, or bourgeoisie, as it moves power from the nation&#x27;s governments to private parties. At the same time, privatization generates a means for profit for the capitalist class; after a transaction they can then sell or rent to the public what used to be commonly owned, or use it as capital through the capitalist mode of production to generate more capital.

The 2022 World Inequality Report, a four-year research project organized by the economists Lucas Chancel, Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez, and Gabriel Zucman, shows that &quot;the world is marked by a very high level of income inequality and an extreme level of wealth inequality&quot; and that these inequalities &quot;seem to be about as great today as they were at the peak of western imperialism in the early 20th century.&quot; According to the report, the bottom half of the population owns 2% of global wealth, while the top 10% owns 76% of it. The top 1% owns 38%.

=== Mass incarceration ===
Several scholars have linked mass incarceration of the poor in the United States with the rise of neoliberalism. Sociologist Loïc Wacquant and Marxist economic geographer David Harvey have argued that the criminalization of poverty and mass incarceration is a neoliberal policy for dealing with social instability among economically marginalized populations. According to Wacquant, this situation follows the implementation of other neoliberal policies, which have allowed for the retrenchment of the social welfare state and the rise of punitive workfare, whilst increasing gentrification of urban areas, privatization of public functions, the shrinking of collective protections for the working class via economic deregulation and the rise of underpaid, precarious wage labor. By contrast, it is extremely lenient in dealing with those in the upper echelons of society, in particular when it comes to economic crimes of the upper class and corporations such as fraud, embezzlement, insider trading, credit and insurance fraud, money laundering and violation of commerce and labor codes. According to Wacquant, neoliberalism does not shrink government, but instead sets up a &quot;centaur state&quot; with little governmental oversight for those at the top and strict control of those at the bottom.

===Financialization===
The wave of financialization that set in the 1980s is facilitated by governmental deregulation which has made the financial system one of the main centers of redistributive activity. Stock promotions, Ponzi schemes, structured asset destruction through inflation, asset stripping through mergers and acquisitions, dispossession of assets (raiding of pension funds and their decimation by stock and corporate collapses) by credit and stock manipulations, are, according to Harvey, central features of the post-1970s capitalist financial system. That aspect relies entirely on the fact that the quantity of money in circulation and therefore demand levels and price levels are controlled by the boards of directors of privately owned banks.

Those boards of directors are also on boards of corporations and any number of other legal vehicles who are also profiting from asset price swings. At the heart of accumulation by dispossession is the private control of the quantity of money supply that can be manipulated for private gain, which includes creating unemployment or restive conditions in the population. This process is well documented in English history as far back as prior to the founding of the Bank of England and before that in the Netherlands. The process works well with or without a central bank and with or without gold backing. The details are also manipulated from time to time as needed to satisfy popular rage or apathy.

===Management and manipulation of crises===

By creating and manipulating crises, such as by suddenly raising interest rates, poorer nations can be forced into bankruptcy, and agreeing to such deals like that of the structural adjustment programs can yield more damages to those nations. Harvey reasoned that this is authorized by parties such as the U.S. Treasury, World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

===State redistributions===
The neoliberal nation-state is one of the most important agents of redistributive policies. Even when privatization or commodification appear to be profitable to the lower class, in the long run it can affect the economy negatively. The state seeks redistributions through a variety of things, like changing the tax code to profit returns on investment rather than incomes and wages (of the lower classes).

==Examples==
Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s program for the privatization of social housing in Britain was initially seen as beneficial for the lower classes which could now move from rental to ownership at a relatively low cost, gain control over assets and increase their wealth. However, housing speculation took over following the transfers (particularly in the prime central locations), and low-income populations were forced out to the periphery. Ultimately, the new homeowners were also borrowers and paid portions of their yearly income as interest on long-term mortgages, effectively transferring a portion of their wealth to the owners of banks with licenses to create debt money from fractional reserves. Thatcher&#x27;s council privatization scheme increased the potential number of borrowers in the UK by up to 20% of UK residents who lived in council housing at the end of the 1970s. Contemporary examples include attempts to deprive people of land in places like Nandigram in India and eMacambini in South Africa.

Privatization is the process of transferring public assets from the state to the private companies. Productive assets include natural resources, such as earth, forest, water, and air. Such are assets that states have used to hold in trust for the people it represents. To privatize them away and sell them as stock to private companies is what Harvey calls accumulation by dispossession.

State redistributions can be in the form of contracts given to power groups: for large infrastructures, services paid by the state and carried out by private enterprise, defense developments, research projects. One would have to find out if those contracts serve public good in a fair way or if they sustain a power structure. Also, the granting of licenses for all sorts of state sanctioned activities can turn out as unfair wealth distribution. Another important redistribution channel is by State supported financing of private enterprise activities.

==Relation to Marxism==
Harvey links these practices to what Karl Marx called original or primitive accumulation, and ties these to examples from the real world. He therefore draws on the theory of ongoing primitive accumulation by Rosa Luxemburg as laid out in The Accumulation of Capital. The neoliberal modernity is, according to Harvey, a modernity in which dispossession plays a large role and in which the capital class is gaining power at the expense of the labour class.

<text>Anisomycin, also known as flagecidin, is an antibiotic produced by &quot;Streptomyces griseolus&quot; which inhibits eukaryotic protein synthesis. Partial inhibition of DNA synthesis occurs at anisomycin concentrations that effect 95% inhibition of protein synthesis. Anisomycin can activate stress-activated protein kinases, MAP kinase and other signal transduction pathways.

==Pharmacology==
Anisomycin interferes with protein and DNA synthesis by inhibiting peptidyl transferase or the 80S ribosome system.

Anisomycin is also mentioned as a potential psychiatric drug, as it may inhibit the consolidation of new context-specific long-term memories, as well as long time consolidated memories rendered labile through reactivation.

Injection of anisomycin into the hippocampus has been proposed for selective removal of memories.

==Biosynthesis==
Because of anisomycin&#x27;s wide use as a protein synthesis inhibitor, there have been many studies centered on the biosynthesis of anisomycin. One study by Butler in 1974 proposed possible precursors to this natural product. Fermentation of &quot;Streptomyces&quot; with labeled amino acids was followed by a degradation of the radioactive anisomycin and deacetylanisomycin products to determine the locations of the labeled carbons. Although its pyrrolidine-based structure suggests that it is derived from proline, the results from the experiments indicated that tyrosine, glycine, methionine, and acetate are the primary precursors for the biosynthesis of anisomycin. Tyrosine and, to a limited degree, phenylalanine, contribute to C-2 of the pyrrolidine ring. Methionine is likely responsible for the methylation of the hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring as S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Glycine or acetate account for C-4 and C-5 on the pyrrolidine ring. It was noted that deacetylanisomycin was a prominent product in the first few days of fermentation, suggesting that acetylation of the C-3 hydroxyl group by acetyl Co-A is the final step in the biosynthesis of anisomycin. The source of the nitrogen within the ring and C-3 were undetermined. However, C-3 is not likely to be provided by the carboxylic acid group of tyrosine because tracking of radioactivity indicated that tyrosine undergoes decarboxylation during fermentation.

== Other uses ==
Anisomycin is used as a component of Martin Lewis agar, an &quot;in vitro&quot; diagnostic product which is used extensively in the United States for the selective isolation of &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot; and &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot;. The antimicrobial can also be used in buffered charcoal yeast extract media for the selective isolation of &quot;Legionella&quot; species.

<doc id="743479" wikidata="Q2304505" url="?curid=743479" title="South Gippsland Highway">
<text>South Gippsland Highway is a partially divided highway connecting the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne through the South Gippsland region of in Victoria, Australia to the town of Sale. The highway serves as a gateway from Melbourne to many attractions including Wilsons Promontory and Phillip Island as well as being an important road for farmers in Gippsland.

==Route==
South Gippsland Highway commences at the intersection with Princes Highway in Dandenong, and heads in a south-eastly direction as a four-lane, dual-carriageway road towards the northern shores of Western Port Bay, through Cranbourne and Tooradin, until it reaches the interchange with Bass Highway to Phillip Island outside Lang Lang, after which it is entirely an undivided rural highway. It continues in an southeasterly direction through Nyora, Korumburra, Leongatha, Foster, Welshpool and Yarram, before heading north and eventually terminating at a roundabout with Princes Highway at Sale.

==History==
The passing of the &quot;Country Roads Act of 1912&quot; through the Parliament of Victoria provided for the establishment of the Country Roads Board (later VicRoads) and their ability to declare Main Roads, taking responsibility for the management, construction and care of the state&#x27;s major roads from local municipalities. (Main) South Gippsland Road was declared a Main Road, from Korumburra to Leongatha, on 10 November 1913; (Main) Coast Road was declared a Main Road, from Dandenong to Lang Lang, on 1 December 1913; and Sale-Yarram Road was declared a Main Road, from Sale via Longford to Stradbroke, on 23 March 1914;

The passing of the &quot;Highways and Vehicles Act of 1924&quot; provided for the declaration of State Highways, roads two-thirds financed by the State government through the Country Roads Board. South Gippsland Highway was declared a State Highway in 1933, cobbled together from roads between Dandenong and Nyora, and between Sale and Yarram (for a total of 83 miles), subsuming the original declarations of (Main) Coast Road, (Main) South Gippsland Road and Sale-Yarram Roads as Main Roads. In 1939, another section between Foster through Welshpool to Yarram was added, along the former Foster-Yarram Road. In the 1947/48 financial year, another section between Nyora via Korumburra and Leongatha to Meeniyan was added, along the former Loch-Nyora Road, Bena-Korumburra Road and Korumburra-Leongatha Roads. In the 1965/66 financial year, the last section between Meeniyan and Foster was added, completing its present-day alignment at this stage.

Conversion to dual carriageways at the western end began in 1975, initially between South Gippsland Freeway and Cranbourne; a distance of 17 km. The final link in the duplication of the highway between Dandenong and Bass Highway opened in the early 1990s between Princes Highway and Pound Road. 

South Gippsland Highway was signed as State Route 180 between Dandenong and Sale on 13 December 1985, the first road in Victoria signed with a State Route, and later a concurrency with Metropolitan Route 12 between Greens Road and Pound Road through Dandenong South; with Victoria&#x27;s conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in the late 1990s, this was replaced by route M420 between Lynbrook and Lang Lang, B440 between Lang Lang and Sale (which was upgraded to A440 when highway upgrades along South Gippsland Highway raised the quality of the road in 2003), and unallocated (excluding the short stretch of Metro Route 12) between Dandenong and Dandenong South. The western section of the South Gippsland Highway between the intersection of the Koo Wee Rup Bypass and the Princes Highway is gradually being renumbered to A21 and B21 following the completion of major works on Koo Wee Rup Road in 2024. The upgrade has included the rerouting of M420 to the upgraded route.

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; through the Parliament of Victoria granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: VicRoads re-declared the road in 2004 as South Gippsland Highway (Arterial #6580), from Dandenong South to Sale.

===Timeline of upgrades and duplication===
*1961 – Whitelaw By-pass Road: 2.5 miles just north of Korumburra completed as a 2-lane, single-carriageway road, replacing a narrow winding route 3.5 miles long consisting of portions of Bena-Korumburra and Warragul-Korumburra Roads, eliminating two railway crossings, costing A£65,000.
*1975 – Conversion to dual carriageways at the western end began in 1975, between the South Gippsland Freeway and Cranbourne; a distance of 17 km.
*1987 – Duplication works completed on three sections. Cranbourne to Five Ways, Tooradin to Dalmore Road, and Monomeith Road to Bass Highway.
*1989 – 3 km of dual carriageways opened between Manks Road and Lynes Road, Tooradin in December 1989.
*1990 – 3 km of dual carriageways opened between Lynes Road, Tooradin and Dore Road in April 1990. At this stage, ’27 km of the planned 32 km length of duplication between Cranbourne and Bass Highway has now been completed’.
*1990/1991 – Duplication of 6 km south of Tooradin completed at a cost of $A9.9m. No exact date was given, however VicRoads Annual Reports cover the previous financial year. This completed the duplication of the highway between Cranbourne and the Bass Highway. An interesting anomaly is that the kilometre lengths quoted in this annual report and the previous annual report do not match!
*1991/1992 – 2.8 km duplication opened between Princes Highway and Pound Road. This was the final link in the duplication of the highway from the Princes Highway to Bass Highway, Again, no exact date was given, however VicRoads Annual Reports cover the previous financial year.

===Level crossing elimination===
The Gippsland railway line crossing just south of the intersection with Princes Highway in Dandenong South was removed in 3 August 2021. The contract was awarded in March 2020, with construction starting in October 2020 on a new road bridge over the rail line on an alignment just east of the original level crossing to a new intersection with Princes Highway; construction was completed and the new alignment was opened to traffic in 3 August 2021.

<text>A cast recording is a recording of a stage musical that is intended to document the songs as they were performed in the show and experienced by the audience. An original cast recording or OCR, as the name implies, features the voices of the show&#x27;s original cast. A cast recording featuring the first cast to perform a musical in a particular venue is known, for example, as an &quot;original Broadway cast recording&quot; (OBCR) or an &quot;original London cast recording&quot; (OLCR).

Cast recordings are (usually) studio recordings rather than live recordings. The recorded song lyrics and orchestrations are nonetheless identical (or very similar) to those of the songs as performed in the theatre. Like any studio performance, the recording is an idealized rendering, without audible audience reaction. 

==History==
The British were the first to create cast recordings, and they were also the first to create original London cast recordings of shows that had already opened on Broadway, but had not been recorded with their original Broadway cast. This led to the odd situation of having, for example, a 1928 recording of the London cast of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, but no recording with the actual 1927 Broadway cast, and a recording of the London cast of Sigmund Romberg&#x27;s &quot;The Desert Song&quot;, but not of the 1926 Broadway cast - even though both of these shows are Broadway musicals, rather than British ones.

Prior to the development of original cast recordings, there had been recordings of songs from musicals, and collections of several such songs, and recordings of songs performed by cast members; but they were recordings of &quot;songs&quot;, that is, they were recorded as stand-alone show tunes rather than representations of a (more or less) complete musical.

The first American original cast recording as we know it was an early experimental LP of program transcriptions of selections from &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;, a 1931 revue starring Fred and Adele Astaire. It was not widely released.

The following year, Jack Kapp produced an album of songs from &quot;Show Boat&quot; timed to the 1932 Ziegfeld revival. This album featured Helen Morgan and Paul Robeson doing their songs from the show but used studio cast singers for the leads.

As the 1930s progressed, Liberty Music Shop in New York City made mini albums of songs from the Ethel Merman musical comedies &quot;Red Hot and Blue&quot; and &quot;Stars in Your Eyes&quot;. These were more like personality recordings, since the arrangements were not the ones heard in the theatre.

The first complete so-called original cast album was Marc Blitzstein&#x27;s 1938 album of songs from &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; although these were recorded with just piano accompaniment and not the show&#x27;s orchestra. In 1984, the original recordings from &quot;Very Warm for May&quot; (1939) were discovered and issued on an LP. However, these recordings were not made with the original orchestrations.

RCA Victor had made an album of the key songs from &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; using the theatre orchestra but featuring Met opera singers Lawrence Tibbett and Helen Jepson singing the songs. Decca riposted with another album of the same highlights sung by the actual stars of the original production, although recorded five years after the premiere. When a revival was staged in 1942, Decca issued a second album of some of the secondary songs from the opera by the revival cast and later combined these two albums onto one LP and called it the &quot;original cast recording&quot;. Decca also issued an album of songs from the all-soldier revue &quot;This Is the Army&quot; by Irving Berlin.

Finally in 1943, came Decca&#x27;s recording of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;. It not only featured the original cast, but the show&#x27;s original chorus, all accompanied by the same orchestra heard in the show, playing the music in the original Robert Russell Bennett orchestrations and conducted by the show&#x27;s original conductor, Jay Blackton. The show was the biggest hit Broadway had experienced up until that time and people who could not get tickets bought the album. It would eventually sell over 1 million copies as a set of 78-rpm records, and millions more on LP and Compact Discs.

Decca soon began recording every hit musical that came along including &quot;One Touch of Venus&quot;, &quot;Carmen Jones&quot;, &quot;Carousel&quot;, and &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;. Soon, all the other record companies were bidding for the rights to record Broadway shows with their original casts.

Capitol recorded &quot;St. Louis Woman&quot; in 1946, and RCA Victor recorded &quot;Brigadoon&quot; in 1947. Although Decca abandoned the cast album field in the mid-1950s, Capitol and Victor actively bid for recording rights. Sometimes problems arose as when RCA Victor signed on to record the 1950 musical &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; even though the show&#x27;s star, Ethel Merman was then under exclusive contract to Decca Records. This resulted in two albums of the score being released: Merman with a studio cast on her label, while the rest of the Broadway cast made an album for RCA Victor with Dinah Shore singing the Merman role.

The label that would dominate the field until the late 1970s, however, was Columbia. They began by issuing an album of the 1946 revival of &quot;Show Boat&quot; followed by the original Broadway cast of &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; in 1947. A year later the label introduced LP records and used the format for two best sellers: &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; and &quot;South Pacific&quot;, both recorded and released in 1949.

Under the leadership of Columbia&#x27;s Goddard Lieberson, the label&#x27;s cast recordings came to define the genre. Columbia Masterworks produced the original cast recordings of such shows as &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Camelot&quot;. Lieberson also recorded important shows that had failed at the box office including &quot;Candide&quot; and &quot;Anyone Can Whistle&quot;. In 1956, he recorded Frank Loesser&#x27;s musical &quot;The Most Happy Fella&quot;, which had so much music that it had to be released as a 3-LP set, an almost unheard of venture for an original cast album in the 1950s.

A 1970 documentary by D. A. Pennebaker, &quot;Original Cast Album: Company&quot; gives a straightforward view of the making of a cast recording. It shows how the recording studio looks, how performers are arranged, and how the director behaves. The cast feels the pressure of delivering a definitive performance, with a degree of perfection beyond that ever required on stage, under a time limit imposed by the high cost of studio time.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s it was not uncommon for cast albums to become best sellers. &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, &quot;The Music Man&quot;, &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, and &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; all reached the #1 position on the Billboard magazine best-sellers chart. As popular music split away from the traditional Tin Pan Alley song stylings of Broadway and Hollywood, and rock music became the dominant pop culture form, show albums began selling less well, albeit with exceptions like the rock musical Hair, which as of January 2024 is the last cast album to chart at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. (The cast albums for &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; and &quot;Hamilton&quot; both peaked at No. 3.) Also, as radio and TV moved away from showcasing Broadway numbers the ability for a show to reach an audience beyond the traditional Broadway fans lessened.

Today few show albums even appear in the Billboard top 200, and the rare breakout hit like &quot;Wicked&quot; receives no radio airplay.

New boutique labels such as PS Classics and Ghostlight release many of the cast albums of recent Broadway hits. With the recent merger of Sony Music (formerly Columbia Records) and BMG Music (formerly RCA Victor), many older editions of cast recordings are being deleted and newly remastered editions are being released.

==Technical limitations==
A 10-inch 78-rpm disc could hold about minutes of music per side. A 12-inch 78-rpm could last minutes. Early albums had to severely abridge selections to fit the format. With LP cast recordings, usually released as single discs, it was not rare for compromises to be made to fit the recording within the forty-to-fifty-minute time limit. For example, reprises, or minor songs might not be included.

By the 1980s, the rise of the compact disc with its 74-minute recording capacity (which was increased to 80 minutes in the 1990s) resulted in improvements in cast recordings, which were now usually capable of including all songs, the full overture and entr&#x27;acte, and, when appropriate, lead-in dialogue to the songs.

In recent years, some cast recordings have been recorded live, in recording studios incorporated into the theater concerned. Otherwise, live recordings tend to trade sound quality for freshness and immediacy.

==Alternate versions==
It is often the case that many cast recordings may be made for the same show. In addition to the recording of the cast of the original production, later high-profile productions may also produce cast recordings: for example, a recording by the cast of the first London production of a show that originated on Broadway, or of the first Broadway cast of a show that originated off-Broadway, or of the cast of a revival produced many decades later than the original production.

For some musicals created before cast recordings became the norm, studio cast recordings are all that exist to document the original productions&#x27; orchestrations. Such studio cast recordings have been made of many early musical comedies by the Gershwins (George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin), Vincent Youmans, and Rodgers and Hart.

==Terms==
Original cast: the premiere or original cast of the production (original Broadway cast; original London cast; original Toronto cast; original Australian cast, etc.). This can (rather confusingly) include revivals as well as first productions. Less misleading in this last case is &quot;Revival Cast&quot;.

Studio cast: assembled by a record company. In the early days, the studio cast singers were often lesser known performers with good singing voices, usually joined by one fairly well known star. Mary Martin made a number of studio cast recordings for Columbia in the early 1950s including &quot;Babes in Arms&quot;, &quot;Girl Crazy&quot;, and &quot;Anything Goes&quot;. More recent studio albums have tended to be note-complete recreations of the original orchestrations, often with well-known singers (not infrequently from the world of opera rather than musical theatre) taking the leads: such as EMI&#x27;s recordings of &quot;Brigadoon&quot; and &quot;Show Boat&quot;.

The performers who appear in Broadway shows sing the score live each night. When a Broadway cast album is made, it is (as a rule) recorded in a studio and produced with the home listener in mind (although live recordings of the original cast are not unknown). While it is strictly correct (if misleading) to call a movie soundtrack a &quot;cast recording&quot; since it does record the performances of the film cast, it is even more misleading, not to mention incorrect, to call any recording a &quot;soundtrack&quot; that has no connection with a motion picture or recorded television production.

Soundtrack albums fill a very similar function for films with music. Soundtrack and cast albums sometimes have much in common, especially when the film concerned is a motion picture version of an original stage musical, and it often makes sense for record shops to put the two genres in the same section. But the cast album of a stage musical is very specifically not a soundtrack.

==Major label cast albums==

===Decca===
Decca Broadway, known from the 1940s until the 1990s simply as Decca Records, is the label that began the trend in North America. They released 78-rpm album sets of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;A Connecticut Yankee&quot;, &quot;One Touch of Venus&quot;, &quot;Carmen Jones&quot;, &quot;Bloomer Girl&quot;, &quot;Song of Norway&quot;, &quot;Carousel&quot;, &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, &quot;Call Me Mister&quot;, and &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot;. Many of these were transferred to LP in 1949–1950 although sometimes songs were abridged or left out completely. The label added more titles to their cast album library in the early 1950s: &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot;, &quot;Wonderful Town&quot;, &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot;, &quot;On Your Toes&quot;, and &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;. In 1968, Decca issued a 2-LP set of the London cast of &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, an album which featured almost the complete show (the Broadway cast album had been recorded by Kapp Records).

In 1949, Decca began to re-release the best-selling of these albums on LP and in the late 1950s began offer electronically enhanced for stereo editions.

The label was out of the business of recording new cast albums by the end of the 1950s. Decca was bought by MCA and in the early 1970s many of these titles were re-released on the MCA label, all using the fake stereo masters.

MCA released many of their classic shows on CD in the 1990s, going back to original master discs and tapes to generate excellent sounding (and complete) remasters of the originals. When MCA and Polygram were merged into the new Universal Music Group, a new label, Decca Broadway, was born. Decca Broadway has re-mastered and reissued virtually every cast album in the old Decca catalogue including many rare titles that had not been available in almost 50 years. Decca Broadway has also recorded recent hits including: &quot;Wicked&quot;, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Spamalot&quot;, &quot;Seussical&quot;, and &quot;Spring Awakening&quot;. It has not, however, released the London cast album of &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; on CD, perhaps because it contains most of the dialogue from the show, and the film version is readily available on DVD. &quot;Wicked&quot;, in particular has been a big seller for the label and continues to sell well. Although they are being selective about what they record, Decca Broadway plans to continue making cast albums, including the Mel Brooks musical &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; and Andrew Lippa&#x27;s &quot;The Addams Family: A New Musical&quot;. Although some of the slower-selling catalog titles have been deleted, many remain available as downloads.

===Capitol===
Capitol recorded &quot;St. Louis Woman&quot; in 1946, mainly because lyricist Johnny Mercer was one of the label&#x27;s founders. It wasn&#x27;t until the 1950s, however, that the label began bidding for cast album rights. Their first few choices were generally not big hits: &quot;Flahooley&quot;, &quot;Top Banana&quot;, &quot;Three Wishes for Jamie&quot;, and the revival of &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot;. They finally got a hit show in 1953 with Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Can-Can&quot;, which remained in print until the end of the LP era. Recordings featuring the film casts of three Rodgers and Hammerstein films (&quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;Carousel&quot;, and &quot;The King and I&quot;) were also released on Capitol during the 1950s, all earning RIAA gold record awards. An even bigger hit came along in 1957 with &quot;The Music Man&quot;, which reached the #1 spot on the Billboard charts and stayed there for 12 weeks. It was also the label&#x27;s first stereo cast album. They scored another bestseller in 1964 when Barbra Streisand&#x27;s label Columbia Records passed on recording &quot;Funny Girl&quot;. Capitol recorded it, and the album became a million seller. Without a TV/radio network affiliation (such as Columbia had with CBS and RCA with NBC) Capitol sometimes had to content themselves with &quot;also-ran&quot; shows. The 1960s found them with recording rights to a number of minor hits: &quot;No Strings&quot;, &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot;, and &quot;Golden Boy&quot; but mostly they got flop shows: &quot;Sail Away&quot;, &quot;Kwamina&quot;, &quot;The Gay Life&quot;, &quot;Skyscraper&quot;, &quot;Walking Happy&quot;, and &quot;Zorba&quot;. They did record Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s Broadway debut as a composer with &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;, but in 1971 they came under fire for refusing to record the complete score of Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot; as a 2-LP set. The label executives complained that &quot;cast albums don&#x27;t sell&quot; ignoring the ongoing success of &quot;Funny Girl&quot; and &quot;The Music Man&quot; and the fact that many of their shows had been outright flops. &quot;Follies&quot; was truncated to a single LP missing four songs and abridging many of the others. It would be Capitol&#x27;s last original cast album.

EMI&#x27;s classical division took over the Capitol Broadway cast catalogue in 1992 and reissued all 40 of the cast albums on the Broadway Angel label. The CDs were well packaged with booklets containing detailed notes and production photos. Although only a half dozen of these releases are still in print as of October 2007, most of the deleted titles have been reissued by DRG keeping the scores available for collectors.

Broadway Angel has recorded some recent shows such as: &quot;Crazy for You&quot;, &quot;Passion&quot;, &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, and &quot;Curtains&quot;, the 1994 Broadway revival of &quot;Carousel&quot;, as well as the Bernadette Peters revivals of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; and &quot;Gypsy&quot;.

In 2013, Universal Music Group acquired EMI and with it Angel and Capitol Broadway catalogues.

===RCA Victor===
RCA Victor entered the cast album field in 1947 with two hits and a miss: &quot;Brigadoon&quot;, &quot;High Button Shoes&quot;, and Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Allegro&quot;. &quot;Brigadoon&quot; was a big seller and remains in print on CD today. &quot;High Button Shoes&quot; was a hit show but the album did not do well. RCA&#x27;s budget label, Camden, reissued it on LP in 1958 and Victor re-released it in 1965. At that time they also did the first LP transfer of &quot;Allegro&quot;.

As the LP era dawned, Victor competed with Columbia for cast album rights. Their first LP release was Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; but because the star Ethel Merman was under contract to Decca, she was replaced on Victor&#x27;s album by Dinah Shore. The album was a failure and was out of print until Red Seal reissued it in 1977. Victor did better with &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot;, and &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;, but had their share of flops: &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Make a Wish&quot;, &quot;Hazel Flagg&quot;, and &quot;Pipe Dream&quot;, along with minor hits &quot;Me and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Happy Hunting&quot;, &quot;New Girl in Town&quot;, &quot;Jamaica&quot;, &quot;Redhead&quot;, &quot;Take Me Along&quot;, &quot;Do Re Mi&quot;, &quot;Wildcat&quot;, and &quot;Milk and Honey&quot;.

In the 1960s, Victor did better with the Tony Award winners &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;, &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, and &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. They hit the top of the charts with &quot;Hair&quot; in 1968. During this time it also released five of the cast albums from the Music Theatre of Lincoln Center revivals, &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; with Patrice Munsel, &quot;Show Boat&quot; with Barbara Cook, Constance Towers, Stephen Douglass, David Wayne, and William Warfield, &quot;Kismet&quot; with Alfred Drake, &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; with Ethel Merman, &quot;Carousel&quot; with John Raitt, and &quot;The King and I&quot; with Rise Stevens and Darren McGavin.

In 1976, Thomas Z. Shepard left Columbia Records for RCA&#x27;s Classical division and under his guidance RCA Red Seal eclipsed Columbia as the dominant label for cast albums. Shepard recorded Sondheim&#x27;s scores for &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot;, &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;, &quot;Sunday in the Park With George&quot;, and &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot;, the 1977 Broadway revival recording of &quot;The King and I&quot;, as well as the hits &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;42nd Street&quot;, and &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;.

In 1985, Shepard staged an all-star concert to make a complete recording of Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot;. When pre-production costs escalated, label president Jose Menendez wanted to cancel the recording. Shepard held his ground and won the battle. The 2-LP set was a bestseller and made profit within a month of release. Early in 1986 Shepard resigned and went to MCA.

With the rise of compact discs in the late 1980s, RCA was bought out by BMG. At this time Bill Rosenfield used RCA Victor to re-release the label&#x27;s vast catalogue of show albums on CD and to record new shows including: &quot;Into The Woods&quot;, &quot;Jerome Robbins&#x27; Broadway&quot;, &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;, &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;Steel Pier&quot;, &quot;Ragtime&quot;, &quot;Fosse&quot;, &quot;The Full Monty&quot;, &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot;, &quot;Urinetown&quot;, and &quot;Avenue Q&quot;. During this time RCA Victor also released the cast recordings for the Broadway revivals of &quot;Anything Goes&quot; (1987), &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1992), &quot;Chicago&quot; (1996), &quot;Candide&quot; (1997), &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1998), &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1998), &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot; (1999), and &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; (2002).

Many of the older, more obscure titles were deleted in 1999–2000 but the catalogue remains active. The merger between Sony and BMG in 2004 has resulted in a new label called Masterworks Broadway and now that Sony has taken over the entire operation they have started allowing outside companies such as DRG to re-release many of the rarer cast albums from the combined Columbia and RCA Victor catalogues.

===Columbia===
Columbia&#x27;s first original Broadway cast album was the 1946 revival of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, soon followed by an album of &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;. In 1948 Columbia introduced the Lp to the record market and soon offered LP editions of their 78-rpm sets. The first cast album recorded as an LP was Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;, which was a big hit on records and was followed by the blockbuster Rodgers and Hammerstein musical &quot;South Pacific&quot;. The producer of these albums was Goddard Lieberson, who brought unquestionable taste and skill to translating a Broadway show to records. He didn&#x27;t just record the songs. It was his goal to make the album an enjoyable listening experience for home listeners who, quite often, had not even seen the shows. Recorded in an old converted church on 30th street in New York City, Columbia&#x27;s albums had a lush, open, spacious sound. When stereo came along in the late 1950s, Lieberson used stereo placement to enhance the performances but avoided any gimmicks. As a result, Columbia&#x27;s albums of &quot;Kismet&quot;, &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;, &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;, and &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; remain classics in the field.

In 1956, Lieberson persuaded CBS to put up the entire capitalization for Lerner and Loewe&#x27;s &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. This ensured that Columbia got the cast album rights and that CBS held all film and TV rights to the property. The show was the biggest hit of the decade, selling out for nearly 6 years on Broadway. The original cast album reached #1 on the Billboard charts, and stayed on the charts for nine years. Because the Broadway cast had been recorded only in monaural, when the cast opened it in London Columbia re-recorded it in stereo. The label later offered the film soundtrack and a 1976 20th anniversary revival cast albums as well as recordings in French, Italian, Spanish and Hebrew.

The profits from the &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; album financed many of Columbia&#x27;s subsequent original cast and classical recordings.

The label recorded Frank Loesser&#x27;s near sung-through musical &quot;The Most Happy Fella&quot;, virtually complete and issued it as a 3-record set as well as a single Lp of highlights. Lieberson made sure that important scores were recorded even if the shows were not box office successes. Thanks to his foresight the original casts of &quot;Candide&quot;, &quot;Anyone Can Whistle&quot;, and &quot;Goldilocks&quot; are preserved.

Columbia recorded as many hits as they did flops - &quot;Gypsy&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, &quot;Camelot&quot;, &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;, &quot;Mame&quot;, &quot;1776&quot;, &quot;Cabaret&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;Company&quot;, &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;, and &quot;Annie&quot;.

In the 1980s, the label began to withdraw from the cast album field as RCA began to dominate it. Sony bought CBS records in the late 1980s and began reissuing many older cast albums on the Sony Broadway label in 1991–94 and later the Sony Columbia Broadway Masterworks labels. The few, mainly obscure flops, that Sony chose not to reissue were farmed out to DRG and other specialty labels.

The merger between Sony and BMG in 2004 has resulted in a new label called Masterworks Broadway and now that Sony has taken over the entire operation they have started allowing outside companies such as DRG to re-release many of the rarer cast albums from the combined Columbia and RCA Victor catalogues. Masterworks Broadway has also launched a new website offering the combined Victor and Columbia catalogues.

<text>On Liberty is an essay published in 1859 by the English philosopher John Stuart Mill. It applied Mill&#x27;s ethical system of utilitarianism to society and state. Mill suggested standards for the relationship between authority and liberty. He emphasized the importance of individuality, which he considered a prerequisite to the higher pleasures—the &quot;summum bonum&quot; of utilitarianism. Furthermore, Mill asserted that democratic ideals may result in the &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;. Among the standards proposed are Mill&#x27;s three basic liberties of individuals, his three legitimate objections to government intervention, and his two maxims regarding the relationship of the individual to society.

&quot;On Liberty&quot; was a greatly influential and well-received work. Some classical liberals and libertarians have criticized it for its apparent discontinuity with &quot;Utilitarianism&quot;, and vagueness in defining the arena within which individuals can contest government infringements on their personal freedom of action. The ideas presented in &quot;On Liberty&quot; have remained the basis of much political thought. It has remained in print since its initial publication. A copy of &quot;On Liberty&quot; is passed to the president of the British Liberal Democrats as a symbol of office.

Mill&#x27;s marriage to Harriet Taylor Mill greatly influenced the concepts in &quot;On Liberty&quot;, which was published shortly after she died.

==Composition==
According to his autobiography, &quot;On Liberty&quot; was first conceived as a short essay in 1854. As the ideas developed, the essay was expanded, rewritten and &quot;sedulously&quot; corrected by Mill and his wife, Harriet Taylor Mill. After suffering a mental breakdown and eventually meeting and subsequently marrying Harriet, Mill changed many of his beliefs on moral life and women&#x27;s rights. Mill states that &quot;On Liberty&quot; &quot;was more directly and literally our joint production than anything else which bears my name.&quot;

The final draft was nearly complete when his wife died suddenly in 1858. Mill suggests that he made no alterations to the text at this point and that one of his first acts after her death was to publish it and to &quot;consecrate it to her memory.&quot; The composition of this work was also indebted to the work of the German thinker Wilhelm von Humboldt, especially his essay &quot;On the Limits of State Action&quot;. Finally published in 1859, &quot;On Liberty&quot; was one of Mill&#x27;s two most influential books (the other being &quot;Utilitarianism&quot;).

==Overview==
===Introduction===
John Stuart Mill opens his essay by discussing the historical &quot;struggle between authority and liberty,&quot; describing the tyranny of government, which, in his view, needs to be controlled by the liberty of the citizens. He divides this control of authority into two mechanisms: necessary rights belonging to citizens, and the &quot;establishment of constitutional checks by which the consent of the community, or of a body of some sort, supposed to represent its interests, was made a necessary condition to some of the more important acts of the governing power.&quot; Because society was—in its early stages—subjected to such turbulent conditions (i.e. small population and constant war), it was forced to accept rule &quot;by a master.&quot; However, as mankind progressed, it became conceivable for the people to rule themselves. Mill admits that this new form of society seemed immune to tyranny because &quot;there was no fear of tyrannizing over self.&quot; Despite the high hopes of the Enlightenment, Mill argues that the democratic ideals were not as easily met as expected. First, even in democracy, the rulers were not always the same sort of people as the ruled. Second, there is a risk of a &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; in which the many oppress the few who, according to democratic ideals, have just as much a right to pursue their legitimate ends.

In Mill&#x27;s view, tyranny of the majority is worse than tyranny of government because it is not limited to a political function. Where one can be protected from a tyrant, it is much harder to be protected &quot;against the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling.&quot; The prevailing opinions within society will be the basis of all rules of conduct within society; thus there can be no safeguard in law against the tyranny of the majority. Mill&#x27;s proof goes as follows: the majority opinion may not be the correct opinion. The only justification for a person&#x27;s preference for a particular moral belief is that it is that person&#x27;s preference. On a particular issue, people will align themselves either for or against that issue; the side of greatest volume will prevail, but is not necessarily correct. In conclusion to this analysis of past governments, Mill proposes a single standard for which a person&#x27;s liberty may be restricted:

That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant... Over himself, over his body and mind, the individual is sovereign.

Mill clarifies that this standard is solely based on utility, not on natural rights. According to Mill, children and &quot;barbarian&quot; nations are benefited by limited freedom. Just despots, such as Charlemagne and Akbar the Great, were historically beneficial to people not yet fit to rule themselves.

J. S. Mill concludes the Introduction by discussing what he claimed were the three basic liberties in order of importance:

#The freedom of thought and emotion. This includes the freedom to act on such thought, i.e. freedom of speech
#The freedom to pursue tastes (provided they do no harm to others), even if they are deemed &quot;immoral&quot;
#The freedom to unite so long as the involved members are of age, the involved members are not forced, and no harm is done to others

While Mill admits that these freedoms could—in certain situations—be pushed aside, he claims that in contemporary and civilised societies there is no justification for their removal.

===Of the liberty of thought and discussion===
In the second chapter, J. S. Mill attempts to prove his claim from the first chapter that opinions ought never to be suppressed. Looking to the consequences of suppressing opinions, he concludes that opinions ought never to be suppressed, stating, &quot;Such prejudice, or oversight, when it [i.e. false belief] occurs, is altogether an evil; but it is one from which we cannot hope to be always exempt, and must be regarded as the price paid for an inestimable good.&quot; He claims that there are three sorts of beliefs that can be had—wholly false, partly true, and wholly true—all of which, according to Mill, benefit the common good:

Mill spends a large portion of the chapter discussing implications of and objections to the policy of never suppressing opinions. In doing so, Mill explains his opinion of Christian ethics, arguing that, while they are praiseworthy, they are incomplete on their own. Therefore, Mill concludes that suppression of opinion based on belief in infallible doctrine is dangerous. Among the other objections Mill answers is the objection that the truth will necessarily survive persecution and that society need only teach the grounds for truth, not the objections to it. Near the end of Chapter 2, Mill states that &quot;unmeasured vituperation, enforced on the side of prevailing opinion, deters people from expressing contrary opinion, and from listening to those who express them.&quot;

===On individuality as one of the elements of well-being===
In the third chapter, J. S. Mill points out the inherent value of individuality since individuality is &quot;ex vi termini&quot; (i.e. by definition) the thriving of the human person through the higher pleasures. He argues that a society ought to attempt to promote individuality as it is a prerequisite for creativity and diversity. With this in mind, Mill believes that conformity is dangerous. He states that he fears that Western civilization approaches this well-intentioned conformity to praiseworthy maxims characterized by the Chinese civilization. Therefore, Mill concludes that actions in themselves do not matter. Rather, the person behind the action and the action together are valuable. He writes:

===On the limits to the authority of society over the individual===
In the fourth chapter, J. S. Mill explains a system in which a person can discern what aspects of life should be governed by the individual and which by society. Generally, he holds that a person should be left as free to pursue his own interests as long as this does not harm the interests of others. In such a situation, &quot;society has jurisdiction over [the person&#x27;s conduct].&quot; He rejects the idea that this liberty is simply for the purpose of allowing selfish indifference. Rather, he argues that this liberal system will bring people to the good more effectively than physical or emotional coercion. This principle leads him to conclude that a person may, without fear of just punishment, do harm to himself through vice. Governments, he claims, should only punish a person for neglecting to fulfill a duty to others (or causing harm to others), not the vice that brought about the neglect.

J. S. Mill spends the rest of the chapter responding to objections to his maxim. He notes the objection that he contradicts himself in granting societal interference with youth because they are irrational but denying societal interference with certain adults though they act irrationally. Mill first responds by restating the claim that society ought to punish the harmful consequences of the irrational conduct, but not the irrational conduct itself which is a personal matter. Furthermore, he notes the societal obligation is not to ensure that each individual is moral throughout adulthood. Rather, he states that, by educating youth, society has the opportunity and duty to ensure that a generation, as a whole, is generally moral.

Where some may object that there is justification for certain religious prohibitions in a society dominated by that religion, he argues that members of the majority ought make rules that they would accept should they have been the minority. He states, &quot;unless we are willing to adopt the logic of persecutors, and say that we may persecute others because we are right, and that they must not persecute us because they are wrong, we must beware of admitting a principle of which we should resent as a gross injustice the application to ourselves.&quot; In saying this, he references an earlier claim that morals and religion cannot be treated in the same light as mathematics because morals and religion are vastly more complex. Just as with living in a society which contains immoral people, Mill points out that agents who find another&#x27;s conduct depraved do not have to socialise with the other, merely refrain from impeding their personal decisions. While Mill generally opposes the religiously motivated societal interference, he admits that it is conceivably permissible for religiously motivated laws to prohibit the use of what no religion obligates. For example, a Muslim state could feasibly prohibit pork. However, Mill still prefers a policy of society minding its own business.

===Applications===
This last chapter applies the principles laid out in the previous sections. He begins by summarising these principles:

====Economy====
Mill first applies these principles to the economy. He concludes that free markets are preferable to those controlled by governments. While it may seem, because &quot;trade is a social act,&quot; that the government ought intervene in the economy, Mill argues that economies function best when left to their own devices. Therefore, government intervention, though theoretically permissible, would be counterproductive. Later, he attacks government-run economies as &quot;despotic.&quot; He believes that if the government ran the economy, then all people would aspire to be part of a bureaucracy that had no incentive to further the interests of any but itself.

====Preventing harm====
Next Mill investigates in what ways a person may try to prevent harm. He first admits that a person should not wait for injury to happen, but ought try to prevent it. Second, he states that agents must consider whether that which can cause injury can cause injury exclusively. He gives the example of selling poison. Poison can cause harm. However, he points out that poison can also be used for good. Therefore, selling poison is permissible. Yet, due to the risk entailed in selling poison or like products (e.g. alcohol), he sees no danger to liberty to require warning labels on the product. Again, Mill applies his principle. He considers the right course of action when an agent sees a person about to cross a condemned bridge without being aware of the risk. Mill states that because the agent presumably has interest in not crossing a dangerous bridge (i.e. if he knew the facts concerned with crossing the bridge, he would not desire to cross the bridge), it is permissible to forcibly stop the person from crossing the bridge. He qualifies the assertion stating that, if the means are available, it is better to warn the unaware person.

With regard to taxing to deter agents from buying dangerous products, he makes a distinction. He states that to tax solely to deter purchases is impermissible because prohibiting personal actions is impermissible and &quot;[e]very increase of cost is a prohibition, to those whose means do not come up to the augmented price.&quot; However, because a government must tax to some extent in order to survive, it may choose to take its taxes from what it deems most dangerous.

====Repeat offences to public through private action====
Mill expands upon his principle of punishing the consequences rather than the personal action. He argues that a person who is empirically prone to act violently (i.e. harm society) from drunkenness (i.e. a personal act) should be uniquely restricted from the drinking. He further stipulates that repeat offenders should be punished more than first time offenders.

====Encouraging vice====
On the subject of fornication and gambling, Mill has no conclusive answer, stating, &quot;[t]here are arguments on both sides.&quot; He suggests that while the actions might be &quot;tolerated&quot; in private, promoting the actions (i.e. being a pimp or keeping a gambling house) &quot;should not be permitted.&quot; He reaches a similar conclusion with acts of indecency, concluding that public indecency is condemnable.

====Suicide and divorce====
Mill continues by addressing the question of social interference in suicide. He states that the purpose of liberty is to allow a person to pursue their interest. Therefore, when a person intends to terminate their ability to have interests it is permissible for society to step in. In other words, a person does not have the freedom to surrender their freedom. To the question of divorce, Mill argues that marriages are one of the most important structures within society; however, if a couple mutually agrees to terminate their marriage, they are permitted to do so because society has no grounds to intervene in such a deeply personal contract.

====Education====
Mill believes that government run education is an evil because it would destroy diversity of opinion for all people to be taught the curriculum developed by a few. The less evil version of state run schooling, according to Mill, is that which competes against other privately run schools. In contrast, Mill believes that governments ought to require and fund private education. He states that they should enforce mandatory education through minor fines and annual standardised testing that tested only uncontroversial fact. He goes on to emphasise the importance of a diverse education that teaches opposing views (e.g. Kant and Locke). He concludes by stating that it is legitimate for states to forbid marriages unless the couple can prove that they have &quot;means of supporting a family&quot; through education and other basic necessities.

====Conclusion====
J. S. Mill concludes by stating three general reasons to object to governmental interference:
# if agents do the action better than the government.
# if it benefits agents to do the action though the government may be more qualified to do so.
# if the action would add so greatly to the government power that it would become over-reaching or individual ambition would be turned into dependency on government.

He summarises his thesis, stating:

==Reception==

&quot;On Liberty&quot; was enormously popular in the years following its publication. Thomas Hardy recalled later in life that undergraduates in the 1860s knew the book almost by heart. Criticisms of the book in the 19th century came chiefly from thinkers who felt that Mill&#x27;s concept of liberty left the door open for barbarism, such as Thomas Carlyle, James Fitzjames Stephen and Matthew Arnold.

In more recent times, although &quot;On Liberty&quot; garnered adverse criticism, it has been largely received as an important classic of political thought for its ideas and accessibly lucid style. Denise Evans and Mary L. Onorato summarise the modern reception of &quot;On Liberty&quot;, stating: &quot;[c]ritics regard his essay &quot;On Liberty&quot; as a seminal work in the development of British liberalism. Enhanced by his powerful, lucid, and accessible prose style, Mill&#x27;s writings on government, economics, and logic suggest a model for society that remains compelling and relevant.&quot; As one sign of the book&#x27;s importance, a copy of &quot;On Liberty&quot; is the symbol of office for the president of the Liberal Democrat Party in England.

The historian Peter Marshall described &quot;On Liberty&quot; as &quot;one of the great classics of libertarian thought&quot;, due to its exaltation of individual freedoms.

===Contradiction to utilitarianism===
Mill makes it clear throughout &quot;On Liberty&quot; that he &quot;regard[s] utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions&quot;, a standard he inherited from his father, a follower of Jeremy Bentham. Though J. S. Mill claims that all of his principles on liberty appeal to the ultimate authority of utilitarianism, according to Nigel Warburton, much of the essay can seem divorced from his supposed final court of appeals. Mill seems to idealize liberty and rights at the cost of utility. For instance, Mill writes:

This claim seems to go against the principle of utilitarianism, that it is permissible that one should be harmed so that the majority could benefit.

Warburton argues that Mill is too optimistic about the outcome of free speech. Warburton suggests that there are situations in which it would cause more happiness to suppress truth than to permit it. For example, if a scientist discovered a comet about to kill the planet in a matter of weeks, it may cause more happiness to suppress the truth than to allow society to discover the impending danger.

While David Brink concedes that Mill&#x27;s apparently categorical appeal to rights seems to contradict utilitarianism, he points out that Mill does not believe rights are truly categorical because Mill opposes unrestrained liberty (e.g. offensive public exposure).

Furthermore, David Brink tries to reconcile Mill&#x27;s system of rights with utilitarianism in three ways:

# Rights are secondary principles to the Greatest Happiness Principle
# Rights are incomparable goods, justifying their categorical enforcement
# Liberty is a good. Thus, those who suppress it are worthy of punishment. Rights deal with the value of punishing/protecting others&#x27; interference with liberty, not the actual protection of liberty

===Narrow focus===
Some thinkers have criticised Mill&#x27;s writing for its apparent narrow or unclear focus in several areas. Mill makes clear that he only considers adults in his writing, failing to account for how irrational members of society, such as children, ought to be treated. Yet Mill&#x27;s theory relies upon the proper upbringing of children. Plank has asserted that Mill fails to account for physical harm, solely concerning himself with spiritual wellbeing. He also argues that, while much of Mill&#x27;s theory depends upon a distinction between private and public harm, Mill seems not to have provided a clear focus on or distinction between the private and public realms.

===Religious criticism===
Nigel Warburton states that though Mill encourages religious tolerance, because he does not speak from the perspective of a specific religion, some claim that he does not account for what certain religious beliefs would entail when governing a society. Some religions believe that they have a God given duty to enforce religious norms. For them, it seems impossible for their religious beliefs to be wrong, i.e. the beliefs are infallible. Therefore, according to Warburton, Mill&#x27;s principle of total freedom of speech may not apply.

===Conception of harm===
The harm principle is central to the principles in &quot;On Liberty&quot;. Nigel Warburton says that Mill appears unclear about what constitutes harm. Early in the book, he claims that simply being offensive does not constitute harm. Later, he writes that certain acts which are permissible and harmless in private are worthy of being prohibited in public. This seems to contradict his earlier claim that merely offensive acts do not warrant prohibition because, presumably, the only harm done by a public act which is harmless in private is that it is offensive.

Warburton notes that some people argue that morality is the basis of society, and that society is the basis of individual happiness. Therefore, if morality is undermined, so is individual happiness. Hence, since Mill claims that governments ought to protect the individual&#x27;s ability to seek happiness, governments ought to intervene in the private realm to enforce moral codes.

<doc id="743487" wikidata="Q782278" url="?curid=743487" title="Nafpaktos">
<text>Nafpaktos () or Naupactus, is a town and a former municipality in Nafpaktia, Aetolia-Acarnania, West Greece, situated on a bay on the north coast of the Gulf of Corinth, west of the mouth of the river Mornos.

It is named for Naupaktos (, Latinized as &quot;Naupactus&quot;), an important Athenian naval station in the Peloponnesian war. As a strategically crucial possession controlling access to the Gulf of Corinth, Naupaktos changed hands many times during the Crusades and the Ottoman–Venetian Wars. It was under Venetian control in the 15th century, and came to be known by the Venetian form of its name, Lepanto. It fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1499 and was used as a naval station by the Ottoman Navy in the 16th century, being the site of the decisive victory by the Holy League in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. Except for a brief period of Venetian control in 1687–1699, Lepanto remained under Ottoman control until Greek independence in 1829.

The modern municipality was incorporated in 1946, and later merged into the larger Nafpaktia municipality in the 2010 reform. &quot;Nafpaktos&quot; is now both the name of a municipal unit within Nafpaktia and of the town proper within the Nafpaktos unit. 
The municipal district has an area of , with a population close to 20,000 .

The town is northeast of Antirrio, northeast of Patras, east of Missolonghi and southeast of Agrinio. The Greek National Road 48/E65 (Antirrio – Nafpaktos – Delphi – Livadeia) passes north of the town. It is the second largest town of Aetolia-Acarnania, after Agrinio.

==Name==
The ancient name &quot;Naupaktos&quot; (Ναύπακτος) means &quot;boatyard&quot; (from ναύς &quot;naus&quot; &quot;ship&quot; and πήγ- &quot;pêg-&quot; &quot;to fix, fasten&quot;). It was later Latinized as &quot;Naupactus&quot;. By the late medieval period, the local name had evolved into &quot;Nepahtos&quot; (Νέπαχτος), &quot;Epaktos&quot; or &quot;Epahtos&quot; (Έπακτος, Έπαχτος). By the &quot;Franks&quot; (Latins) it was called &quot;Neopant&quot;, &quot;Nepant&quot; or &quot;Lepant&quot;. French sources of the 14th century give &quot;Nepant&quot; or &quot;Neopant&quot;; Venetian sources have &quot;Nepanto&quot; or &quot;Lepanto&quot;.

The name was adapted in Ottoman Turkish from Greek Νέπαχτος as &quot;Aynabahti&quot; or &quot;İnebahtı&quot;.

The original ancient name was revived in modern Greece in the 19th century.

==History==

===Antiquity===
In Greek legend, Naupactus is the place where the Heraclidae built a fleet to invade the Peloponnese.

In Classical Antiquity, it was an important town of the Locri Ozolae and the best harbour on the northern coast of the Corinthian Gulf. The town was situated just within the entrance of this gulf, a little east of the promontory Antirrhium. It is said to have derived its name from the Heracleidae having here built the fleet with which they crossed over to Peloponnesus.

Though Naupactus was indebted for its historical importance to its harbour at the entrance of the Corinthian gulf, it was probably originally chosen as a site for a city on account of its strong hill, fertile plains, and copious supply of running water. After the Greco-Persian Wars it fell into the power of the Athenians, who settled there the Messenians, who had been compelled to leave their country at the end of the Third Messenian War in 464 BCE, and during the Peloponnesian War it was the headquarters of the Athenians in all their operations in Western Greece, and the scene of the Battle of Naupactus in 429 BCE. After the Battle of Aegospotami the Messenians were expelled from Naupactus, and the Locrians regained possession of the town. Afterwards it passed into the hands of the Achaeans, from whom, however, it was wrested by Epaminondas. Philip II of Macedon gave it to the Aetolians, and hence it is frequently called a town of Aetolia. The Aetolians vigorously defended Naupactus against the Romans for two months in 191 BCE. Ptolemy calls it a town of the Locri Ozolae, to whom it must therefore have been assigned by the Romans after Pliny&#x27;s time.

Pausanias saw at Naupactus a temple of Poseidon near the sea, a temple of Artemis, a cave sacred to Aphrodite, and the ruins of a temple of Asclepius. The Roman playwright Plautus mentions Naupactus in his comedy &quot;Miles Gloriosus&quot; as the destination of an Athenian master (Pleusicles) who is on a diplomatic mission to the city.

Naupactus is mentioned in the 6th-century list of Hierocles, but it was destroyed by an earthquake in 551/2, during the reign of Justinian I.

===Medieval and early modern history===
The town and its hinterland were hit by an epidemic coming from Italy in 747/8 and almost deserted. From the late 9th century, probably the 880s, it was capital of the Byzantine &quot;thema&quot; of Nicopolis. At the same time, its bishopric was elevated to a metropolis. During the 9th–10th centuries, the town was an important harbour for the Byzantine navy and a strategic point for communication with the Byzantine possessions in southern Italy.

A rebellion of the local populace, which led to the death of the local &quot;strategos&quot; George, is recorded during the early reign of Constantine VIII (r. 1025–28). In 1040, the town did not take part in the uprising of Peter Delyan, and although attacked by the rebel army, alone among the towns of the theme of Nicopolis, it resisted successfully. St. Nicholas of Trani is recorded as having departed for Otranto in 1094 from the port. The history of the town over the next two centuries is obscure; during the visit of Benjamin of Tudela in 1165, there was a Jewish community of about 100 in the town.

Following the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire after the Fourth Crusade, it became part of the Despotate of Epirus. Under its metropolitan, John Apokaukos, the see of Naupactus gained in importance and headed the local synod for the southern half of the Epirote domains. In 1294, the town was ceded to Philip I, Prince of Taranto as part of the dowry of Thamar Angelina Komnene. The ruler of Thessaly, Constantine Doukas, attacked Epirus in the next year and captured Naupactus, but in 1296 handed most of his conquests back to the Angevins, and Naupactus became a major Angevin base on the Greek mainland.

In 1304 or 1305, the Epirotes recovered Naupactus during a war with the Angevins, but handed it back when peace was concluded in 1306. The town briefly became part of the Serbian Empire during the 1350s.
In 1361 the town was captured by the Catalans of the Duchy of Athens. In 1376 or 1377 it fell to John Bua Spata, an Albanian despot of Arta. 
It was briefly occupied Knights Hospitaller in 1378, and, now wedged between the expanding lands of the Count of Cephalonia Carlo I Tocco and the Ottoman possessions, sold to the Republic of Venice by Paul Spata in 1407.

After 1449, the town was an isolated Venetian exclave in Ottoman territory, as the Ottomans completed their conquest of the rest of Epirus and Aetolia-Acarnania. The town was important to Venice, as it secured their trade through the Corinthian Gulf, and the Republic took care to erect strong fortifications to secure its possession. In the end, the fortress fell to the Ottomans in 1499, during the Second Ottoman–Venetian War.
Under the Ottomans, Naupactus was known as &quot;Aynabahtı, İnebahtı&quot; and was the seat of an Ottoman province. In 1521 (Hijri 927) the town had 509 Christian, 84 Jewish, and 28 Roma households. The mouth of the Gulf of Lepanto was the scene of the great sea battle in which the naval power of the Ottoman Empire was nearly completely destroyed by the united Spanish, Papal, and Venetian forces (Battle of Lepanto, October 7, 1571). In 1687 it was recaptured by the Venetians, but was again restored to the Ottomans in 1699, by the Treaty of Karlowitz. Among those who fought in the Battle of Lepanto was Miguel de Cervantes, the most famous Spanish writer; there is a statue located at the port, in his honour.

===Modern history===
Nafpaktos became part of independent Greece in March 1829.
It was incorporated as a commune in 1912 and as an independent municipality in 1946. In the 1997 reform, 
Nafpaktos municipality was enlarged by the incorporation of 13 communes. In the 2010 reform, Nafpaktos municipality was merged with five other municipalities to form Nafpaktia municipality, and the town of Nafpaktos proper is now a communal district within the &quot;Nafpaktos&quot; municipal district of Nafpaktia municipality.

Naupactus suffered damage from the 2007 Greek forest fires.

==Ecclesiastical history==

The metropolitan see of Naupactus depended on the pope of Rome until 733, when Leo III the Isaurian annexed it to the Patriarchate of Constantinople.

The zealous youth St. Nicholas of Trani after a failed attempt at the mortifications of cenobitic life at the Hosios Loukas monastery in Boetia set sail in the spring of 1094 on a pilgrimage to Rome for the Solemnity of Sts. Peter and Paul. His pious habit of evangelizing the sailors with constant proclamations (in Greek &quot;kerygma&quot; from κηρύσσω, meaning &quot;to cry or proclaim as a herald&quot;) of the phrase Kyrie Eleison according to legend, led them to throw him overboard. He made it ashore in Italy, but was not hospitably received and died some months later aged just 19. Miraculous cures led to him being publicly acclaimed as worthy of veneration by the Bishop of Trani at the Council of Bari in 1098.

Under Frankish rule, there were about 20 archbishops in the 14–15th centuries. The city remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic church.

The see was attached to the Church of Greece after the Greek War of Independence. It was suppressed in 1900, replaced by the see of Acarnania and Naupactia, whose seat is at Missolonghi.

==Residents==
Today the population is about 19,768 people according to the 2011 census. Residential homes align with the Gulf of Corinth over a length of about and a width of about . The port divides the beachfront in two parts. The Western part is called Psani, while the Eastern part Gribovo. Naupactus sits on a shoulder of a mountain range on the north while farmlands dominate the western part. It used to be on the GR-48/E65 linking Antirrio and Amfissa; now it is bypassed to the north at the elevation of above sea level. The bypass has contributed significantly in lowering the number of heavy trucks passing through the narrow streets of the town.

<text>Alexander Heinrich Rudolph von Kluck (20 May 1846 – 19 October 1934) was a German general during World War I.

== Early life ==

Kluck was born in Münster, in Westphalia on 20 May 1846.
He was the son of architect Karl von Kluck and his wife Elisabeth, née Tiedemann. He was a pupil at a school called Paulinum in his hometown of Münster.

In 1874 he married Fanny von Donop (1850–1938); they had three sons and one daughter.

== Military career ==

He enlisted in the Prussian army in time to serve in the seven-week Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and the Franco-Prussian War, where he was wounded twice in the Battle of Colombey-Neuilly, and awarded the Iron Cross (second class) for bravery. He was made a general of infantry in 1906, and in 1913 was appointed Inspector General of the Seventh Army District.

=== World War I ===

With the outbreak of World War I, Kluck was placed in command of the German First Army. According to the Moltke revisions of the Schlieffen Plan, the First Army was part of the strong right wing and positioned on the outer western edge of the German advance through Belgium and France. This western flank was to advance alongside Karl von Bülow&#x27;s Second Army to Paris. Upon reaching Paris in concert, the First and Second armies were to threaten Paris from both the west and east.

After fighting the British at Mons and Le Cateau, the First Army pursued Lanrezac&#x27;s French Fifth Army during the great retreat. However, thirty miles from Paris and anticipating an encounter with the French Fifth Army (commanded by Lanrezac), the cautious Bülow halted his Second Army&#x27;s advance and ordered Kluck&#x27;s direct support. Kluck had recently been placed under Bülow&#x27;s command when the latter was appointed to command the German right wing. Kluck protested this order to Bülow and Moltke, as he preferred to move past Lanrezac&#x27;s left flank, but was overruled and ordered to support Bülow&#x27;s attack on Lanrezac. By this time, the aggressive Kluck had advanced his First Army well south of von Bülow&#x27;s position to 13 miles north of Paris. On August 30, Kluck decided to wheel his columns to the east of Paris, discarding entirely the Schlieffen Plan. Although frustrated by Bülow&#x27;s caution, on 31 August Kluck turned his army southeast to support the Second Army. In so doing, Kluck created a 30-mile gap in the German line extending toward Bülow&#x27;s stalled Second Army. Critically, the move exposed Kluck&#x27;s right flank in the direction of Paris where (unknown to Kluck) General Michel-Joseph Maunoury&#x27;s new Sixth Army was deployed. The French learned of Kluck&#x27;s change in course on September 3 thanks to reports from Allied aircraft, and this was independently confirmed by radio intercepts. The following events were critical to the future course of the war.

On 5 September, Maunoury attacked Kluck&#x27;s right (west) flank, marking the opening of the First Battle of the Marne. Kluck parried the blow by borrowing two corps in the space between the First and Second army. A surprise attack on 8 September by Franchet D&#x27;Esperey&#x27;s (who had replaced Lanrezac) Fifth Army against Bülow&#x27;s Second widened the gap which the British Expeditionary Force marched to exploit.

Kluck telegraphed von Moltke on the night of 8 September that the decisive victory would be won the following day. Instead, on 9 September a representative of the German Headquarters, Hentsch, considered the situation of Bülow&#x27;s Army as very dangerous and ordered a retreat of all the armies, even though by that time Kluck had overcome most of his own problems. Ian Senior dismisses as a &quot;myth&quot; the claim in the German Official History that Kluck might have triumphed on 9 September. In fact the BEF was already over the Marne and Quast&#x27;s attack against Maunoury&#x27;s Sixth Army had failed, and suggests that this may be why Kluck avoided meeting Hentsch directly.

The Germans retreated in good order to positions forty miles behind the River Aisne. There, the front would remain for years in the form of entrenched positions as World War I continued.

Kluck and Bülow&#x27;s lack of coordination and the ensuing failure to maintain an effective offensive line was a primary contribution to the failure of the Schlieffen Plan which was intended to deliver a decisive blow against France. Instead, the long stalemate of trench warfare was ready to begin. Many German experts hold Kluck and especially his chief of staff, Hermann von Kuhl, in the highest esteem. Germany could have won the Battle of the Marne, they think, if only Bülow had matched the courageous initiatives of Kluck&#x27;s Army, although this doesn&#x27;t explain the near encirclement of his army. The British at the time called him &quot;old one o&#x27;clock&quot;.

“In great and dangerous operations one must not think but act”, was Kluck&#x27;s favourite quote of Julius Caesar’s.

== Retirement and later life ==

Toward the end of March 1915, while inspecting an advanced portion of his troops, he was struck by shrapnel, which caused seven wounds and seriously injured his leg. Shortly afterward, he received the Order Pour le Mérite at the hospital. In October 1916 the &quot;Militär Wochenblatt&quot; reported that Kluck had been placed on half-pay, in accordance with his request to be allowed to retire. His son, Lieutenant Egon von Kluck, was killed early in 1915.

General von Kluck wrote of his participation in the War in the volume entitled &quot;Führung und Taten der Erste&quot; (1920). His post war memoirs, &quot;The March on Paris and the Battle of the Marne&quot;, were published in 1920. Kluck died in Berlin in October 1934 and was buried at the Stahnsdorf South-Western Cemetery.

==In popular culture==
Kluck was mentioned in a bawdy British army song (whose lyrics were written to the tune of the traditional folk-song &quot;The Girl I Left Behind Me&quot;), which in the original ran:
:&quot;Kaiser Bill is feeling ill,
:The Crown Prince he&#x27;s gone barmy.
:We don&#x27;t give a fuck for old von Kluck
:And all his bleedin&#x27; army.&quot;

It was later reported styled in censored form, that is, in less offensive but wholly inaccurate language from a historical point of view. It is unclear if &quot;crown prince&quot; referred to Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria or Wilhelm, German Crown Prince, both army commanders for the duration of the war, though Wilhelm generally fought opposite the French.

Kluck is mentioned in Episode 2, “The Little Pink Book / Field Trip,” of Season 1 of the American animated comedy television series, &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; Arnold&#x27;s grandmother, upon seeing her distraught grandson, says, “I haven’t seen you this down since von Kluck swept through Belgium back in August ‘14.”

<doc id="743491" wikidata="Q510554" url="?curid=743491" title="Kojak">
<text>Kojak is an American action crime drama television series starring Telly Savalas as the title character, New York City Police Department Detective Lieutenant Theophilus &quot;Theo&quot; Kojak. Taking the time slot of the popular &quot;Cannon&quot; series, it aired on CBS from 1973 to 1978.

In 1999, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked Theo Kojak number 18 on its 50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time list.

==Production==
The show was created by Abby Mann, an Academy Award–winning film writer best known for his work on drama anthologies such as &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot; and &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;. Universal Television approached him to do a story based on the 1963 Wylie-Hoffert murders, the brutal rape and murder of two young professional women in Manhattan.

Owing to poor and corrupt police work and the prevailing casual attitude toward suspects&#x27; civil rights, the crimes in the Wylie-Hoffert case were pinned on a young African American man, George Whitmore Jr., who had been arrested on a separate assault charge. After illegally obtaining a confession, the police had the suspect all but convicted until a second investigation by a different team of detectives exonerated the suspect and identified the real killer, Richard Robles, who was convicted in 1965 and sentenced to life in prison.

Mann developed the project as a gritty police procedural, but with a subtext focusing on institutionalized prejudice and the civil rights of suspects and witnesses. The result was a 1973 made-for-TV movie, &quot;The Marcus-Nelson Murders&quot;. The opening and closing titles of the film emphasized the point that it was a fictional account of the events that led to the creation of Miranda rights by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1966. Selwyn Raab&#x27;s book &quot;Justice in the Back Room&quot; provided Mann with some of his inspiration for the story of &quot;The Marcus-Nelson Murders&quot;, and the series subsequently included a credits reference to having been &quot;suggested by a book by Selwyn Raab&quot;.

Savalas starred in &quot;The Marcus-Nelson Murders&quot; as a police detective whose last name was spelled &quot;Kojack&quot;. The film served as a pilot for the &quot;Kojak&quot; television series. Kojak himself was a composite character, based on a number of detectives, lawyers, and reporters who were involved in the Wylie-Hoffert murder case.

==Plot==
===Series===
The series is set in the New York City Police Department&#x27;s Eleventh Precinct (the building shown was actually Ninth Precinct), Manhattan South Patrol Borough. The series was also filmed in New York City.

The show revolved around the efforts of the tough and incorruptible Lieutenant Theophilus (&quot;Theo&quot;) Kojak (Telly Savalas), a bald, dapper, New York City policeman, who was fond of Dum-Dums and of using the catchphrases, &quot;Who loves ya, baby?&quot; &quot;Quit ya bellyaching&quot;, and &quot;Cootchie-coo!&quot;. Kojak was stubborn and tenacious in his investigation of crimes—and also displayed a dark, cynical wit, along with a tendency to bend the rules if it brought a criminal to justice.

In the context of the script, Kojak&#x27;s was seen as typical squad room humor, which was picked up later in the TV drama &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;. Savalas described Kojak as a &quot;basically honest character, tough but with feelings—the kind of guy who might kick a hooker in the tail if he had to, but they&#x27;d understand each other because maybe they grew up on the same kind of block.&quot; Kojak&#x27;s Greek American heritage, shared by actor Savalas, was featured prominently in the series.
In the early episodes of the series, he is often seen smoking cigarettes. Following the 1964 Surgeon General&#x27;s Report on smoking, cigarette commercials were banned from American television in 1971, and public awareness of the dangers of cigarette smoking increased dramatically during the 1970s. To cut down on his own habit, Kojak began using lollipops as a substitute. The lollipop made its debut in the Season 1 episode &quot;Dark Sunday&quot;, broadcast on December 12, 1973; Kojak lights a cigarette as he begins questioning a witness, but thinks better of it and sticks a lollipop (specifically, a Tootsie Pop) in his mouth instead. Later in the episode, Kevin Dobson&#x27;s character Crocker asks about the lollipop and Kojak replies, &quot;I&#x27;m looking to close the generation gap.&quot; Although Kojak continued to smoke, as he was frequently seen lighting a cigarillo, the lollipop eventually became his identifying characteristic; in fact, when the series debuted a new opening montage in season five, Kojak is seen both lighting a cigarillo and popping a lollipop into his mouth.

His longtime supervisor was Capt. Frank McNeil (Dan Frazer), a man who never seemed to know what was going on. Later in the series, McNeil was promoted to Chief of Detectives in Manhattan. Kojak is the commander of the Manhattan South Precinct&#x27;s detective squad. His squad includes one of his favorite employees, young plainclothes officer, Det. Bobby Crocker (Kevin Dobson). Detective Stavros, played by Telly&#x27;s real-life brother George Savalas, used the name &quot;Demosthenes&quot; as his screen credit during the first two seasons. George Savalas, under his real name, also received a Production Associate credit during the first season and a Production Assistant credit for the second season. Detective Saperstein (Mark Russell), and Detective Rizzo (Vince Conti), all gave Kojak support. Roger Robinson appeared in 12 episodes as Detective Gil Weaver.

Although the show primarily focused on Kojak&#x27;s police work, it occasionally veered into other areas of the character&#x27;s lives, such as the first-season episode &quot;Knockover&quot; which included a subplot involving Kojak romancing a (much younger) female police officer. In 1976, crime writer Joe Gores received an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Episode in a TV Series Teleplay for the third-season episode &quot;No Immunity for Murder&quot; (first aired November 23, 1975).

The show was canceled after five seasons in 1978, due to falling ratings. Reruns of &quot;Kojak&quot; became successful in syndication and on TV Land.

===TV movies===
Years after the series ended, Savalas reprised the role in two CBS TV movies, &quot;Kojak: The Belarus File&quot; (1985) (an adaptation of the John Loftus book &quot;The Belarus Secret&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (1987) (based on Dorothy Uhnak&#x27;s novel &quot;The Investigation&quot;). Kojak is not a character in either book. Dan Frazer, George Savalas, Mark Russell and Vince Conti made their final appearances in &quot;The Belarus File&quot;.

In 1989, ABC revived the series again with five additional TV movies. These films saw now-Inspector Kojak lead the NYPD&#x27;s Major Crimes Squad. Andre Braugher was cast as Winston Blake, a young detective assigned to Kojak&#x27;s command. Kevin Dobson returned for the fourth film &quot;It&#x27;s Always Something&quot;.

Telly Savalas and Dan Frazer are the only cast members to appear in every episode of the original series. Kevin Dobson appeared in all but two episodes, while George Savalas appeared in all but three.

Two main title themes were used for the show. The somewhat better-known first &quot;Kojak&quot; theme, in two distinct arrangements, is the work of Billy Goldenberg, who scored the first two episodes of the series (Goldenberg also scored the series&#x27; pilot movie). The first of these two arrangements was used for episodes 1-27. The second of these two arrangements was used for episodes 28–96. Kim Richmond scored the series&#x27; third episode. John Cacavas composed the second main title theme used for the show&#x27;s fifth and final season. In addition, Cacavas composed the music score beginning with the series&#x27; fourth episode and continued throughout the remainder of the series.

Goldenberg&#x27;s first &quot;Kojak&quot; theme had lyrics, written by Bill Dyer. The song, entitled &quot;We&#x27;ll Make It This Time (Theme From Kojak)&quot; was performed by Sammy Davis Jr. on his 1976 album &quot;The Song And Dance Man&quot;.

==Cars==
Kojak drove an unmarked police car. A 1973 Buick Century police detective car with full wheel covers and a 1974 Buick Century 455 badged sedan with small wheel covers were used. Both cars were dark brown (GM Nutmeg Poly). The 1973 grille (section above the bumper) has three horizontal bars while the 1974 has five horizontal bars. A blue 1974 Century sedan was also featured. Later in the series, the brown Century was replaced by a 1975 copper color model. The New York orange with dark blue lettered license plate on the brown police detective car was 383-JDZ.

==Episodes==

&quot;Kojak&quot; aired for five seasons on CBS, from 1973 to 1978 for a total of 118 episodes. In the United Kingdom, the series premiered on 24 August 1974 on BBC1. In 1985, seven years after the series ended, Telly Savalas returned to play Kojak in seven TV movies beginning with &quot;Kojak: The Belarus File&quot;. The first two were aired by CBS and the latter five were aired on ABC as part of their &quot;ABC Saturday Mystery Movie&quot; theme block. His character was promoted to the rank of captain, and later inspector. Andre Braugher co-starred as Det. Winston Blake, and for one TV movie, &quot;Kojak: It&#x27;s Always Something&quot;, Kevin Dobson returned as Bobby Crocker, now an assistant district attorney. Guest stars in these TV movies included Angie Dickinson, Marcia Gay Harden, Max von Sydow, Jerry Orbach and Suzanne Pleshette.

==Broadcast history and Nielsen ratings==
==Remake==

In March 2005, a new &quot;Kojak&quot; series debuted on the USA Network cable channel and on ITV4 in the UK. In this re-imagined version, African-American actor Ving Rhames portrays the character. The series only lasted one season.

===Film===
David and Leslie Newman&#x27;s original script for &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot; featured a cameo appearance by Savalas as Kojak, with Superman mistaking him for Lex Luthor and accidentally capturing him. This scene was written out of the film after Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz became involved and shifted the film towards a less campy and more serious tone.

Universal Pictures is planning to make a film version of Kojak, with Neal Purvis and Robert Wade to write the script for the film. Vin Diesel will star as Kojak and produce the film with Samantha Vincent. Philip Gawthorne was hired to construct a new draft for the film.

On June 19, 2015 it was reported in media outlets that playwright Philip Gawthorne is on board for the new Kojak movie being written for Universal. &quot;Kojak&quot; is being produced by Diesel&#x27;s Universal-based One Race Films with Scott Stuber and Dylan Clark. Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, the writing team behind James Bond films including &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; and &quot;Skyfall&quot;, joined the project in 2012 to write a previous draft.

<text>Vila Nova de Gaia (; ), or simply Gaia, is a city and a municipality in Porto District in Norte Region, Portugal. It is located south of the city of Porto on the other side of the Douro River. The city proper had a population of 178,255 in 2001. The municipality has an area of and a population of 303,824 inhabitants in 2021, making it the most populous municipality in Norte Region, and the third most populous in the country, after Lisbon and Sintra. Gaia along with Porto and 16 other municipalities make up the Porto metropolitan area.

The city contains many cellars (locally known as &quot;caves&quot;) where port wine is stored and aged. These cellars have become a major tourist attraction.

==History==

=== Origins and roman era ===
The territory of Vila Nova de Gaia has been inhabited since at least 100,000 years ago, as evidenced by Middle Paleolithic archaeological findings. This presence continued through the Chalcolithic period, marked by the construction of barrows, and the Bronze Age, as demonstrated by the settlement at Alto da Vela in Gulpilhares. During the Iron Age, hillforts (castros) were established, including the Castro do Monte Murado in Pedroso, where two bronze plaques inscribed with Latin text (tesserae hospitales) were found. These plaques record a hospitality pact between the Turduli Veteres, the local ethnic group and the newly arrived Romans.

Under Roman rule, the area, known as Cale, gained strategic importance due to its location near the mouth of the Douro River and the road connecting Olisipo (Lisbon) and Bracara Augusta (Braga). Fortified settlements such as the Castles of Gaia Crestuma were established to control trade along the river. Cale likely originated from a preexistent Celtic settlement.

During this time, most of the population likely resided south of the Douro River, with a smaller settlement on the northern bank around a deep-water port in what is now Porto&#x27;s Ribeira neighbourhood. This northern settlement, known as Portus Cale (the &quot;port&quot; of Cale), grew in prominence over time due to the thriving Douro River trade, attracting the clergy and the merchant class.

=== Middle Ages and early modern period ===
Between the 5th and 7th centuries, under the rule of the Suebi and Visigoths, the region&#x27;s largest population centers were Portucale Castrumantiqum (Gaia) and Portucale Castrumnuovum (Porto). Christianity became firmly established in the area during this period, particularly after the arrival of Martin of Braga in 550, as evidenced by paleochristian remains found in the castles of Gaia and Crestuma.

In the 8th century, the Moorish invasions shifted the frontier between Islamic and Christian territories to the Douro River. With the constant raids and counter-raids, the town of Cale, or Gaia, was deserted and most of its inhabitants took refuge in Porto in the North side of the river. This era also saw the emergence of the &quot;Lenda de Gaia&quot; (Legend of Gaia), a late medieval legend set in the 10th century.

Following the Christian reconquest of the Douro&#x27;s southern bank after 1035, semi-abandoned fertile lands were resettled by colonists from the north, who were drawn by favorable feudal contracts. The combined cities of Porto and Gaia were often referred to in contemporary documents as &quot;villa de Portucale.&quot; The Leonese County of Portucale (Condado Portucalense), centered on this region, would eventually expand and gain independence, forming the Kingdom of Portugal.

By the 13th century, Vila Nova de Gaia was an established administrative and judicial territory, known as the jurisdiction (julgado) of Gaia. It encompassed the parishes of Arcozelo, Avintes, Canelas, Canidelo, Grijó, Guetim, Gulpilhares, Madalena, Mafamude, Olival, Oliveira do Douro, Perosinho, Santa Marinha, São Félix da Marinha, Seixezelo, Serzedo, Valadares, Vilar de Andorinho, and Vilar do Paraíso. In 1255, King Afonso III granted a royal charter (foral) to the settlement at the Castle of Gaia, hoping to promote the area as an harbour for cargo entering the river. Later, in 1288, King Denis and Queen Elizabeth issued a charter for the nearby lower settlement, known as Burgo Velho do Porto, renaming it Vila Nova de Rey, with the intent of concentrating the wine trade Gaia. In 1302, King Denis also established a fair in Vila Nova de Rey.

During this period, significant institutions were founded, including the in 1345 by Maria Mendes Petite. Medieval Gaia also had ties to Portugal&#x27;s first university, the University of Coimbra, as the abbot of the church of St. Marinha (igreja de Santa Marinha) renounced certain revenues to support its establishment. Additionally, King Pedro I briefly established the municipality of Canidelo in 1363 in honor of his beloved Inês de Castro, though it was dissolved in 1375.

Following the 1383-1385 interregnum, the municipalities of Gaia and Vila Nova de Rey were integrated into the broader Porto Territory (Termo do Porto), an administrative division governed from Porto. While the municipalities retained some local governance, much of their administrative, judicial, and ecclesiastical control shifted to Porto. During this period, Gaia would also lose control over the wine trade, to the city of Porto. In 1518, King Manuel I issued a new foral, reaffirming the administrative structure of Vila Nova de Gaia while codifying its municipal privileges and duties. During this period, the territory of the municipality was under the influence of a combination of noble families, such as the Cernaches and the Sás, the king and religious institutions, such as the Diocese of Porto and the , which founded the Monastery of Serra do Pilar. This arrangement continued until the reorganization of municipal territories in the 19th century.

Vila Nova de Gaia served as a hub for sailors and merchants involved in Atlantic trade routes and connections with Brazil and North America. Some historians argue that famed explorer Ferdinand Magellan may have been born in Gaia, alongside navigator , who played a role in Francis Drake&#x27;s circumnavigation of the globe. Several exporting companies had warehouses in Gaia and from 1777, Vila Nova de Gaia became the official storage site for all wine and port wine exporters, following the reforms of the Douro Wine Company.

=== 19th century reforms and industrialization ===
In the early 19th century, Vila Nova de Gaia experienced significant upheaval during the French Invasions, particularly the second invasion, which caused widespread damage and hardship. Following the expulsion of the French, British forces exerted influence over Portugal, dominating commerce and connections with the royal court in Brazil. This period of foreign dominance set the stage for the Liberal Revolution of 1820, organized in part within Gaia&#x27;s wine cellars and erupting in neighboring Porto. In 1832, during the Siege of Porto, the Serra do Pilar Monastery in Gaia played a crucial role in defending the city against Miguelist troops. The monastery&#x27;s strategic importance persisted, leading to its transformation into a military barracks, a role it continues to fulfill today. In 1836, the Vila Nova de Gaia municipality contained 9,541 households, 1490 of which were in the Vila Nova de Gaia parish.

This period would also lead to significant territorial reforms and the creation of the modern Vila Nova de Gaia municipality in 1832, merging the former Vila Nova de Rey and Gaia municipalities. Vila Nova de Gaia regained municipal autonomy in 1834, following the dissolution of the Porto Territory in 1821. Between 1832 and 1836, Avintes, Grijó, Crestuma and Sandim were raised to municipalities, following the Mouzinho da Silveira territorial reforms, but they were ultimately incorporated to the Gaia municipality. The later two had previously been under Santa Maria da Feira&#x27;s jurisdiction. The municipality continued to experience reforms in the 20th and 21st centuries. In 1928, the parish of Guetim was transferred to the municipality of Espinho, while Lever was annexed to Vila Nova de Gaia. In 1952, Afurada and its surrounding area were separated from Santa Marinha to form a new parish. In 2013, an administrative reform would reorganize the 24 parish into 15 subdivisions, including the reuniting of the central parishes of Afurada and Santa Marinha.

The 19th century brought significant development, with the emergence of the ceramics, cooperage, textiles, metalworking, and vehicle construction industries and the continuation of traditional activities of shipbuilding and milling. Exports of agricultural goods to Brazil and the Northern Europe increased, such as wine, cork, olive oil, livestock and vegetables. Cultural associations emerged such as business, sports, and musical clubs, as well as local chapters of political parties, syndicates and cooperatives. Educational institutions were founded and museums were inaugurated such as the Azuaga Museum and Casa Museu Teixeira Lopes. Granja beach also became a popular destination, of easy access upon the arrival of the railways.

The transportation network improved significantly, assisting transport of raw goods and exports. The royal road between Coimbra and Vila Nova de Gaia was improved and the Dom Luís I Bridge opened in 1886. In 1864, the Linha do Norte railway reached and later Porto upon the construction of Maria Pia Bridge in 1877. At the end of the 19th century, the Leixões port was inaugurated.

In the 20th century, urban development transformed Vila Nova de Gaia. The construction of Avenida da República and the new city council (Câmara municipal) building in 1916 redefined the city&#x27;s center. In 1984, Gaia was raised to city status.
